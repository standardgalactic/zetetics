Semiconductor Devices for High-Speed Optoelectronics
Providing an all-inclusive treatment of electronic and optoelectronic devices used in
high-speed optical communication systems, this book emphasizes circuit applications,
advanced device design solutions, and noise in sources and receivers. Core topics cov-
ered include semiconductors and semiconductor optical properties, high-speed circuits
and transistors, detectors, sources, and modulators. It discusses in detail both active
devices (heterostructure ﬁeld-effect and bipolar transistors) and passive components
(lumped and distributed) for high-speed electronic integrated circuits. It also describes
recent advances in high-speed devices for 40 Gbps systems. Introductory elements are
provided, making the book open to readers without a speciﬁc background in optoelec-
tronics, whilst end-of-chapter review questions and numerical problems enable readers
to test their understanding and experiment with realistic data.
Giovanni Ghione is Full Professor of Electronics at Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy.
His current research activity involves the physics-based and circuit-oriented modeling
of high-speed electronic and optoelectronic components, with particular attention to
III-N power devices, thermal and noise simulation, electrooptic and electroabsorption
modulators, coplanar passive components, and integrated circuits. He is a Fellow of the
IEEE and has authored or co-authored over 200 technical papers and four books.

Preface
The development of high-speed ﬁber-based optical communication systems that has
taken place since the early 1970s can be really considered as a technological wonder. In
a few years, key components were devised (such as the semiconductor laser) with the
help of novel technological processes (such as epitaxial growth) and found immediate
application thanks to the development of low-loss optical ﬁbers. New compound semi-
conductor alloys (namely, InGaAsP) were ready to provide their potential to emit the
right wavelengths needed for long-haul ﬁber propagation. When electronic repeaters
seemed unable to provide a solution to long-haul propagation, ﬁber ampliﬁers were
developed that allowed for all-optical signal regeneration. And the list could be contin-
ued. A miracle of ingenuity from a host of researchers made it possible to assemble this
complex puzzle in a few years, thus bringing optoelectronic technology to a consumer
electronics level.
Increasing the system capacity by increasing the transmission speed was, of course,
a main concern from the early stages of optical system development. While optoelec-
tronic devices behave, on the electronic side, in a rather conventional way up to speeds
of the order of 1 Gbps, for larger speeds (up to 40 Gbps and beyond) RF wave propa-
gation has to be accounted for in designing and modeling optoelectronic devices. When
speed increases, the distributed interaction between RF and optical waves becomes a
useful, sometimes indispensable, ingredient in many optoelectronic devices, like mod-
ulators and (to a lesser extent) detectors. Similarly, the electronic circuits that interface
light sources, modulators, and detectors should provide broadband operation up to
microwave or millimeter-wave frequencies, thus making it mandatory to exploit com-
pound semiconductor electronics (GaAs- or InP-based) or advanced Si-based solutions
(like SiGe HBT integrated circuits or nanometer MOS processes).
Increasing speed beyond the 10 Gbps limit by improving device performance, how-
ever interesting it is from the research and development side, may in practice be less
appealing from the market standpoint. The ultimate destiny of optoelectronic devices
(such as sources, modulators, and detectors) optimized for 40 Gbps (or even faster) sys-
tems after the post-2000 market downturn still is uncertain, and research in the ﬁeld
has followed alternative paths to the increase of system capacity. At the same time,
new application ﬁelds have been developed, for instance in the area of integrated all-Si
optical signal processing systems, and also for integrated circuit level high-capacity
communications. However, the development of high-speed optoelectronic devices has
raised a number of stimulating (and probably lasting) design issues. An example is the

xiv
Preface
principle of the distributed interaction between optical and RF waves, which is com-
mon to a variety of high-speed components. Another relevant theme is the co-design
and the (possibly monolithic) integration of the electronic and optoelectronic compo-
nents of a system, not to mention the critical aspects concerning device packaging and
interconnection in systems operating at 40 Gbps and beyond.
Taking the above into account, it is not surprising that the main purpose of the present
book is to provide a kind of uniﬁed (or, perhaps, not too widely separated) treatment
of high-speed electronics and optoelectronics, starting from compound semiconduc-
tor basics, down to high-speed transistors, ICs, detectors, sources and modulators. Part
of the material was originally developed for a number of postgraduate and Master
courses, and therefore has the ambition (but also the limitation) of providing a treat-
ment starting from the very basics. It is hoped that this justiﬁes both the presence of
introductory material on semiconductors and semiconductor optical properties, and a
treatment of high-speed electronics starting from a review of transmission lines and
scattering parameters. From this standpoint, the text attempts to be as self-contained
as possible. Of course, the choice of subjects is somewhat inﬂuenced by the author’s
personal tastes and previous research experience (not to mention the need to keep the
page count below 500): some emphasis has been put on noise, again with an attempt
to present a self-contained treatment of this rather difﬁcult topic, and many important
optoelectronic components have not been included (to mention one, semiconductor opti-
cal ampliﬁers). Yet another innovative subject that is missing is microwave photonics,
where of course the RF and microwave and optoelectronic worlds meet. Nevertheless,
the text is (in the author’s opinion, at least) different enough from the many excellent
textbooks on optoelectronics available on the market to justify the attempt to write it.
I wish to thank a number of colleagues (from Politecnico di Torino, unless otherwise
stated) for their direct or indirect contribution to this book. Ivo Montrosset provided
many useful suggestions on the treatment of optical sources. Incidentally, it was under
the guidance of Ivo Montrosset and Carlo Naldi that (then an undergraduate student)
I was introduced to the basics of passive and active optoelectronic devices, respectively;
this happened, alas, almost 30 years ago. Helpful discussions with Gian Paolo Bava and
Pierluigi Debernardi (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche) on laser noise, with Simona
Donati Guerrieri on the semiconductor optical properties and with Fabrizio Bonani and
Marco Pirola on active and passive high-speed semiconductor electronic devices and
circuits are gratefully acknowledged. Michele Goano kindly revised the sections on
compound semiconductors and the numerical problems, and provided useful sugges-
tions on III-N semiconductors. Federica Cappelluti prepared many ﬁgures (in particular
in the section on photodetectors), initially exploited in lecture slides. Finally, Claudio
Coriasso (Avago Turin Technology Center, Torino) kindly provided material on inte-
grated electroabsorption modulators (EAL), including some ﬁgures. Additionally, I am
indebted to a number of ME students who cooperated in research, mainly on lithium
niobate modulators; among those, special mention goes to F. Carbonera, D. Frassati, G.
Giarola, A. Mela, G. Omegna, L. Terlevich, P. Zandano. A number of PhD students also
worked on subjects relevant to the present book: Francesco Bertazzi (now with Politec-
nico di Torino) on EM modeling of distributed electrooptic structures; Pietro Bianco,

on high-speed modulator drivers; Federica Cappelluti, on electroabsorption modulator
modeling; Gloria Carvalho, on EAL modeling; Antonello Nespola (now with Istituto
Superiore Mario Boella), on the modeling of distributed high-speed photodetectors.
Part of the thesis work of Antonello Nespola and Federica Cappelluti was carried out
within the framework of a cooperation with UCLA (Professor Ming Wu, now at Univer-
sity of California, Berkeley). Finally, I gratefully recall many helpful discussions with
colleagues from the industry: among those, Marina Meliga, Roberto Paoletti, Marco
Romagnoli, and Luciano Socci.

1.1
Introducing semiconductors
Single-crystal semiconductors have a particularly important place in optoelectronics,
since they are the starting material for high-quality sources, receivers and ampliﬁers.
Other materials, however, can be relevant to some device classes: polycrystalline or
amorphous semiconductors can be exploited in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar
cells; dielectrics (also amorphous) are the basis for passive devices (e.g., waveguides
and optical ﬁbers); and piezoelectric (ferroelectric) crystals such as lithium niobate are
the enabling material for a class of electrooptic (EO) modulators. Moreover, polymers
have been recently exploited in the development of active and passive optoelectronic
devices, such as emitters, detectors, and waveguides (e.g., ﬁbers). Nevertheless, the
peculiar role of single-crystal semiconductors justiﬁes the greater attention paid here
to this material class with respect to other optoelectronic materials.
From the standpoint of electron properties, semiconductors are an intermediate
step between insulators and conductors. The electronic structure of crystals generally
includes a set of allowed energy bands, that electrons populate according to the rules
of quantum mechanics. The two topmost energy bands are the valence and conduction
band, respectively, see Fig. 1.1. At some energy above the conduction band, we ﬁnd the
vacuum level, i.e., the energy of an electron free to leave the crystal. In insulators, the
valence band (which hosts the electrons participating to the chemical bonds) is separated
from the conduction band by a large energy gap Eg, of the order of a few electronvolts
(eV). Due to the large gap, an extremely small number of electrons have enough energy
to be promoted to the conduction band, where they could take part into electrical con-
duction. In insulators, therefore, the conductivity is extremely small. In metals, on the
other hand, the valence and conduction bands overlap (or the energy gap is negative),
so that all carriers already belong to the conduction band, independent of their energy.
Metals therefore have a large conductivity. In semiconductors, the energy gap is of the
order of 1–2 eV, so that some electrons have enough energy to reach the conduction
band, leaving holes in the valence band. Holes are pseudo-particles with positive charge,
reacting to an external applied electric ﬁeld and contributing, together with the electrons
in the conduction band, to current conduction. In pure (intrinsic) semiconductors, there-
fore, charge transport is bipolar (through electrons and holes), and the conductivity is
low, exponentially dependent on the gap (the larger the gap, the lower the conductivity).
However, impurities can be added (dopants) to provide large numbers of electrons to

the conduction band (donors) or of holes to the valence band (acceptors). The resulting
doped semiconductors are denoted as n-type and p-type, respectively; their conductiv-
ity can be artiﬁcially modulated by changing the amount of dopants; moreover, the dual
doping option allows for the development of pn junctions, one of the basic building
blocks of electronic and optoelectronic devices.
1.2
Semiconductor crystal structure
Crystals are regular, periodic arrangements of atoms in three dimensions. The point
set r deﬁning the crystal nodes, corresponding to the atomic positions (Bravais lattice)
satisﬁes the condition r = ka1 + la2 + ma3, where k,l, m are integer numbers and a1,
a2, a3 are the primitive vectors denoting the primitive cell, see Fig. 1.2. Bravais lattices
can be formed so as to ﬁll the entire space only if the angles α1, α2, α3 assume values
from a discrete set (60◦, 90◦, 120◦, or the complementary value to 360◦). According to
the relative magnitudes of a1, a2, a3 and to the angles α1, α2, α3, 14 basic lattices can be
shown to exist, as in Table 1.1. In semiconductors, only two lattices are technologically
important at present, i.e. the cubic and the hexagonal. Most semiconductors are cubic
(examples are Si, Ge, GaAs, InP. . . ), but some are hexagonal (SiC, GaN). Both the cubic
and the hexagonal structure can be found in carbon (C), where they are the diamond and
graphite crystal structures, respectively.
Three kinds of Bravais cubic lattices exist, the simple cubic (sc), the face-centered
cubic (fcc) and the body-centered cubic (bcc), see Fig. 1.3. The cubic semiconductor
crystal structure can be interpreted as two shifted and compenetrated fcc Bravais
lattices.
Let us consider ﬁrst an elementary semiconductor (e.g., Si) where all atoms are equal.
The relevant cubic lattice is the diamond lattice, consisting of two interpenetrating

The Miller index notation
The Miller indices are a useful notation to denote planes and reference directions
within a lattice. The notation (h, k,l), where h, k, l are integers, denotes the set of
parallel planes that intercepts the three points a1/h, a2/k and a3/l, or some multiple
thereof, while [h, k,l] in square brackets is the direction orthogonal to plane (h, k,l).

Examples of planes and directions according to the Miller notation.
Additionally, {h, k,l} is a family of planes with symmetries and ⟨h, k,l⟩is the related
direction set. In cubic lattices, the primitive vectors coincide with the Cartesian axes
and a1 = a2 = a3 = a, where a is the lattice constant; in this case, we simply have
[h, k,l] ≡hx + ky + lz where x, y andz are the Cartesian unit vectors.
To derive the Miller indices from the plane intercepts in a cubic lattice, we normalize
with respect to the lattice constant (thus obtaining a set of integers (H, K, L)), take the
reciprocal (H−1, K −1, L−1) and ﬁnally multiply by a minimum common multiplier
so as to obtain a set (h, k,l) such as h : k : l = H−1 : K −1 : L−1. Notice that a zero
index corresponds to an intercept point at inﬁnity. Examples of important planes and
directions are shown in Fig. 1.5.
Example 1.1: Identify the Miller indices of the following planes, intersecting the coor-
dinate axes in points (normalized to the lattice constant): (a) x = 4, y = 2, z = 1;
(b) x = 10, y = 5, z = ∞; (c) x = 3.5, y = ∞, z = ∞; (d) x = −4, y = −2, z = 1.
We take the reciprocal of the intercept, and then we multiply by the minimum com-
mon multiplier, so as to obtain an integer set with minimum module. In case (a),
the reciprocal set is (1/4, 1/2, 1), with minimum common multiplier 4, leading to
the Miller indices (1, 2, 4). In case (b), the reciprocals are (1/10, 1/5, 0) with Miller
indices (1, 2, 0). In case (c), the plane is orthogonal to the z axis, and the Miller indices
simply are (1, 0, 0). Finally, case (d) is similar to case (a) but with negative intercepts;
according to the Miller notation we overline the indices rather than using a minus sign;
we thus have (1, 2, 4).

1.2.2
The diamond, zinc-blende, and wurtzite semiconductor cells
The cubic diamond cell includes 8 atoms; in fact, if we consider Fig. 1.6, the corner
atoms each contribute to eight adjacent cells, so that only 8/8 = 1 atom belongs to the
main cell. The atoms lying on the faces belong half to the main cell, half to the nearby
ones, so that only 6/2 = 3 atoms belong to the main cell. Finally, the other (internal)
4 atoms belong entirely to the cell. Therefore, the total number of atoms in a cell is
1 + 3 + 4 = 8. In the diamond cell, each atom is connected to the neighbours through
a tetrahedral bond. All atoms are the same (C, Si, Ge...) in the diamond lattice, while in
the so-called zinc-blende lattice the atoms in the two fcc constituent lattices are different
(GaAs, InP, SiC. . . ). In particular, the corner and face atoms are metals (e.g., Ga) and
the internal atoms are nonmetals (e.g., As), or vice versa.
In the diamond or zinc-blende lattices the Miller indices are conventionally deﬁned
with respect to the cubic cell of side a. Due to the symmetry of the tetrahedral atom
bonds, planes (100) and (110), etc. have two bonds per side, while planes (111) have
three bonds on the one side, two on the other. Moreover, the surface atom density is
different, leading, for example, to different etch velocities.
Some semiconductors, such as SiC and GaN, have the hexagonal wurtzite crystal
structure. Hexagonal lattices admit many polytypes according to the stacking of succes-
sive atom layers; a large number of polytypes exists, but only a few have interesting
semiconductor properties (e.g. 4H and 6H for SiC). The wurtzite cell is shown in
Fig. 1.7, including 12 equivalent atoms. In the ideal lattice, one has

Some properties of semiconductor lattices are shown in Table 1.2.1 It can be
noted that wurtzite-based semiconductors are often anisotropic (uniaxial) and have two
dielectric constants, one parallel to the c-axis, the other orthogonal to it.

Ferroelectric crystals
Ferroelectric materials have a residual spontaneous dielectric polarization after the
applied electric ﬁeld has been switched off. The behavior of such materials is some-
what similar to that of ferromagnetic materials. Below a transition temperature, called
the Curie temperature Tc, ferroelectric materials possess a spontaneous polarization
or electric dipole moment. The magnitude of the spontaneous polarization is greatest
at temperatures well below the Curie temperature, and approaches zero as the Curie

temperature is approached. Ferroelectric materials are inherently piezoelectric; that is,
in response to an applied mechanical load, the material will produce an electric charge
proportional to the load. Similarly, the material will produce a mechanical deformation
in response to an applied voltage. In optoelectronics, ferroelectric materials are particu-
larly important because of the excellent electrooptic properties, i.e., the strong variation
of the material refractive index with an applied electric ﬁeld. The crystal structure is
often cubic face-centered, and the material is anisotropic and uniaxial. The most impor-
tant ferroelectric crystal for optical applications is probably lithium niobate, LiNbO3
(LN for short); some other materials (such as barium titanate) belonging to the so-
called perovskite class are also sometimes used. The crystal structure of perovskites
is face-centered cubic. Above the Curie temperature, the crystal is strictly cubic, and
positive and negative ions are located in the cell so as to lead to zero dipole moment.
Below the Curie temperature, however, a transition takes place whereby positive and
negative ions undergo a shift in opposite directions; the crystal structure becomes tetrag-
onal (i.e., the elementary cell height a3 is different from the basis a1 = a2) and, due
to the charge displacement, a net dipole moment arises. Table 1.3 shows a few prop-
erties of ferroelectric crystals, namely the spontaneous polarization Ps and the Curie
temperature [2].
1.2.4
Crystal defects
In practice, the crystal lattice is affected by defects, either native (i.e., not involv-
ing external atoms) or related to nonnative impurities. Moreover, defects can be point
defects (0D), line defects (1D), surface defects (2D), such as dislocations, and vol-
ume defects (3D), such as precipitates. Native point defects are vacancies, see Fig. 1.8,
and self-interstitials, while interstitials are nonnative atoms placed in the empty space
between the already existing lattice atoms. Substitutional defects involve an external
atom, e.g., a dopant, which replaces one native atom. Typically, dopants act as donors
or acceptors only if they are in a substitutional site; if they are in an interstitial site, they
are inactive (chemically inactivated).2
2 Dopants can also be electrically inactivated when they are not ionized.

Semiconductor electronic properties
1.3.1
The energy–momentum dispersion relation
A crystal is a periodic arrangement of atoms; since each positively charged nucleus
induces a spherically symmetric Coulomb potential, superposition yields in total a
periodic potential U(r) such as
U(r) = U(r + L),
where L = ka1 + la2 + ma3. In such a periodic potential, electrons follow the rules of
quantum mechanics, i.e., they are described by a set of wavefunctions associated with
allowed electron states. Allowed states correspond to allowed energy bands, which col-
lapse into energy levels for isolated atoms; allowed bands are separated by forbidden
bands. Low-energy electrons are bound to atoms, and only the two topmost allowed
bands (the last, being almost full, is the valence band; the uppermost, almost empty,
is the conduction band) take part in carrier transport. As already recalled, the vac-
uum level U0 is the minimum energy of an electron free to move in and out of the
crystal.
Electrons in a crystal are characterized by an energy–momentum relation E(k), where
the wavevector k is related to the electron momentum p as p = ¯hk. The dispersion
relation E(k) is deﬁned in the k space, also called the reciprocal space; it is generally
a multivalued function, periodic in the reciprocal space, whose fundamental period is
called the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (FBZ). A number of branches of the dispersion relation
refer to the valence band, a number to the conduction band; the total number of branches
depends on the crystal structure and is quite large (e.g., 12 for the conduction band and
8 for the valence band) in wurtzite semiconductors.
In cubic semiconductors, the FBZ is a solid with six square faces and eight hexagonal
faces, as shown in Fig. 1.9. Owing to symmetries, only a portion of the FBZ, called
the irreducible wedge, actually includes independent information; all the rest can be
recovered by symmetry. Important points in the FBZ are the center ( point), the X
point (center of the square face), and the L point (center of the hexagonal face).
The full details of the dispersion relation are not essential for understanding low-
energy phenomena in semiconductors; attention can be restricted to the branches

describing low-energy electrons in the conduction band (around the conduction band
edge Ec) and high-energy electrons (low-energy holes) in the valence band (around
the valence band edge Ev). Valence band electrons are more efﬁciently described in
terms of pseudoparticles (the holes) related to electrons missing from the valence band.
Holes behave as particles with positive charge and potential energy opposite to the elec-
tron energy, so that the topmost branches of the dispersion relation (i.e., the branches
describing low-energy holes) deﬁne the valence band edge.
As a relevant example, let us discuss the dispersion relation for a direct-bandgap
semiconductor, GaAs. The term direct bandgap refers to the fact that the minimum
of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band (both located in the 
point) correspond to the same momentum ¯hk, in this case ¯hk = 0. The dispersion rela-
tion shown in Fig. 1.10 is simpliﬁed, in the sense that only the lowest branch of the
conduction band is shown, while three branches of the valence band appear, the heavy
hole (HH), the light hole (LH), and the split-off band. Light and heavy hole bands are
degenerate, i.e., they share the same minimum in the  point, and they differ because
of the E(k) curvature near the minimum, which corresponds to a larger or smaller hole
effective mass. The split-off band enters some transport and optical processes but can
be neglected in a ﬁrst-order treatment. The conduction band has the lowest minimum at

10
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
the  point, and two secondary minima at the L and X points. The main gap is 1.42 eV,
while the secondary gaps are 1.72 eV (L point) and 1.90 eV (X point). Only a section of
the dispersion relation is presented, running from the L point to the  point (the center
of the FBZ), and then from the  point to the X point and back to the origin through the
K point.
Since electrons and holes have, at least in the absence of an applied ﬁeld, a Boltz-
mann energy distribution (i.e., their probability to have energy E is proportional to
exp(−E/kBT ), where kBT = 26 meV at ambient temperature), most electrons and
holes can be found close to the conduction band and valence band edges, respectively.
Consider now the lowest minimum of the conduction band or highest maximum in
the valence band; the dispersion relation can be approximated (around the  point) by
a parabola as
En −Ec ≈¯h2k2
2m∗n
,
Ev −Eh ≈¯h2k2
2m∗
h
,
where m∗
n and m∗
h are the electron and hole effective masses.3 Therefore, the electron
kinetic energy En −Ec or hole kinetic energy Ev −Eh (assuming the valence band
edge energy Ev and the conduction band edge energy Ec to be the energy of a hole
or of an electron, respectively, at rest) have, approximately, the same expression as the
free-space particle kinetic energy, but with an effective mass m∗
n or m∗
h instead of the
in vacuo inertial mass m0. If the minimum is not located in the center of the ﬁrst BZ
(as for the conduction band of indirect bandgap semiconductors) the momentum (in a
dynamic sense) can be deﬁned “with respect to the minimum,” so that the following
approximation applies:
En −Ec ≈¯h2 k−kmin
 2
2m∗n
.
The effective mass can be evaluated from the inverse of the curvature of the dispersion
relation around a minimum or a maximum. In general, the approximating surface can
be expressed as

which is an ellipsoid; the coordinate system coincides with the principal axes. If the
three effective masses are equal, the ellipsoid degenerates into a spherical surface, and
we say that the minimum is spherical, with isotropic effective mass. This typically
happens at  point minima. In indirect-bandgap semiconductors, the constant-energy
3 Corrections to the parabolic approximation accounting for nonparaboliticity effects can be introduced (e.g.,
in the conduction band) through the expression:
Ek (1 + αEk) = ¯h2k2
2m∗n
,
where Ek is the electron kinetic energy En −Ec and α is a nonparabolicity correction factor.

.
Due to degeneracy, the valence bands have a more complex behavior near the valence
band edge, but can anyway be approximated with isotropic masses; however, since the
heavy and light hole populations mix, a properly averaged effective mass has to be
introduced; the same remark applies for electrons with anisotropic effective mass. The
averaging law is related to the application, and is not unique; we can therefore have an
effective mass for transport and also (as discussed later) an effective mass for the density
of states that follow different averaging criteria. Concerning the density of states mass
(denoted with the subscript D), we have for the electrons

The above expression refers to the general case of ellipsoidal minima with multiplicity

conduction band we have simply
m∗
n,D = m∗

while for the rotation ellipsoid case in Si (where 6 equivalent minima are present in the
FBZ) we obtain

while of course m∗

quantum well, see Section 1.7). Concerning the effective masses for transport, since on
average the electron moves along all three principal directions with the same probability,
we have that the transport or conductivity average electron mass is given by

For holes, the situation is more complex, since heavy and light holes exist. It can be

1.3.2
The conduction and valence band wavefunctions
Electrons and holes belonging to the conduction and valence bands are character-
ized, from the standpoint of quantum mechanics, by a wavefunction. According to the
Bloch theorem, wavefunctions in a periodic potential (e.g., a crystal) can be generally
expressed as
ψk(r) = exp(−jk · r)uk(r),
(1.1)
where uk(r) is a periodic function in the crystal space, such as uk(r) = uk(r + L), L
being a linear combination (with integer indices) of the primitive lattice vectors. The
functional form of the wavefunction in (1.1), called the Bloch wave, ensures that the
probability associated with the wavefunction is indeed a periodic function in the crystal
space. For k ≈0 (e.g., near the  point) one has ψk(r) ≈u0(r), where u0(r) follows
single-atom-like wavefunctions (s-type or p-type, see Fig. 1.11).
Since the detailed spatial behavior of wavefunctions is relevant to optical properties,
we recall that conduction band wavefunctions are, near the  point, s-type, i.e., they
have a probability distribution with spherical constant-probability surfaces. On the other
hand, the valence band wavefunctions are p-type, i.e., they are even with respect to two
orthogonal directions and odd with respect to the third, see Fig. 1.11. For instance,
px is even with respect to the y and z axes and odd with respect to the x axis. The
detailed shape of the wavefunctions is much less important than their property of being
even in all directions (the s-type wavefunction) or odd with respect to one direction.

Direct- and indirect-bandgap semiconductors
A simpliﬁed version of the dispersion relation, including the main conduction band
minima and valence band maxima, is often enough to explain the electronic and opti-
cal behavior of a semiconductor. Such an example is shown in Fig. 1.12(a), for GaAs:
the coincident maxima and minima in the  point make this semiconductor a typical
example of direct-bandgap material. Direct-bandgap semiconductors are particularly
important in optics, because they are able to interact directly with photons; in fact, those
can provide an energy of the order of the energy gap, but negligible momentum. To pro-
mote an electron from the valence to the conduction band, an energy larger than the gap
has to be provided, but, in GaAs, negligible momentum, since the valence band maxi-
mum and conduction band minimum are both at k = 0. Since the interaction involves
only one electron and one photon, the interaction probability is high.
Silicon, the most important semiconductor in electronics, is an example of an
indirect-bandgap semiconductor, i.e., a material in which the valence band maximum
and conduction band minimum occur at different values of k, see Fig. 1.12(b). In par-
ticular, the main conduction band minimum is close to point X but within the FBZ, and
six minima exist in the FBZ. The electron energy around such minima can be expressed
as a function of the transverse (e.g., orthogonal to (100)) and of the longitudinal (e.g.,
parallel to (100)) wavenumbers:
En ≈Ec + ¯h2k2

.
In Si, the electron–photon interaction leading to band-to-band processes requires a sub-
stantial amount of momentum, which has to be supplied by a further particle, typically
a lattice vibration (phonon). The multibody nature of the interaction makes it less

probable, and therefore the interaction strength is lower. Typically, direct-bandgap semi-
conductors are able to absorb and emit light; indirect-bandgap semiconductors absorb
light (albeit less efﬁciently) but are unable to operate as high-efﬁciency light emitters,
particularly in lasers. Germanium (Ge), see Fig. 1.12(c), is an indirect-bandgap semi-
conductor; the lowest conduction band minimum is at point L, but a direct bandgap
exists with a higher energy (0.9 eV) at point . As a result, the main transport properties
of Ge are typical of an indirect-bandgap material, but optical properties are inﬂuenced
by the fact that high-energy photons can excite electrons directly from the valence band
to the direct minimum. Some of germanium’s optical properties (e.g., the absorption)
exhibit both indirect- and direct-bandgap semiconductor features, depending on the
photon energy.
In the above materials, the central minima can be characterized by isotropic or quasi-
isotropic (as for the valence band) effective masses, while indirect bandgap minima are
typically anisotropic and have to be described in terms of a longitudinal and transverse
effective mass. A summary of the effective masses and other band properties in Si and
GaAs is shown in Table 1.4.
Many III-V semiconductors have a bandstructure similar to GaAs. InP, see
Fig. 1.13(a), has a slightly lower bandgap, but a larger difference between the cen-
tral and the lateral minima. This has important consequences on transport properties,
since it increases the electric ﬁeld at which the electrons are scattered from the cen-
tral minimum (characterized by high mobility, i.e., high electron velocity with the same
applied electric ﬁeld) to the lateral minima (with low mobility). This ultimately leads to
a decrease of the average electron velocity with increasing ﬁeld, see Fig. 1.14. The max-
imum velocity is larger in InP than in GaAs, allowing for the development of electron
devices (such as transistors) with superior properties in terms of maximum speed. The
peak electron velocity (corresponding to the onset of the negative differential mobil-
ity region) occurs at a ﬁeld Em related to the energy difference E between the  and

but with lower energy gap. For certain compound semiconductors, such as AlAs, see
Fig. 1.13(c), the central minimum is higher than the lateral minima, thus making the
material of indirect-bandgap type. InAs and AlAs are not particularly important per
se, but rather as the components of semiconductor alloys. Some additional compound

provided (referring to intrinsic material) are therefore indicative.
Compound semiconductor families are classiﬁed according to the chemical nature
of the metal and nonmetal components. If the metal component belongs to group III
and the nonmetal to group V, we obtain a III-V compound. Examples of III-V com-
pounds are GaAs, InP, GaSb, InAs (direct bandgap) and AlAs, GaP (indirect bandgap).
III-V compounds with nitrogen such as GaN, InN, AlN are often referred to as III-
N compounds. III-V compounds are probably the most important semiconductors for
high-frequency electronics and optoelectronics. II-VI compounds include CdTe, HgTe,

ZnS, CdSe, ZnO (direct bandgap; note that HgTe has a negative bandgap and therefore
has a metal rather than semiconductor behavior). IV-IV compounds are SiC and SiGe,
both of them of indirect bandgap type. Finally, I-VII semiconductor compounds also
exist, such as AgI and CuBr.

Carrier densities in a semiconductor
1.4.1
Equilibrium electron and hole densities
According to the picture drawn so far, a simpliﬁed representation of the semiconductor
bandstructure includes two energy bands, the valence and conduction bands, separated
by the energy gap Eg. Some electrons have large enough energy to be promoted from the
valence to the conduction band, leaving behind positive charges called holes. Both elec-
trons and holes can interact with an external electric ﬁeld, and with photons or other par-
ticles. Further details of the bandstructure are introduced in Fig. 1.1, such as the electron
afﬁnity qχ, i.e., the distance between the conduction band edge and the vacuum level
U0, and the ionization I0, i.e., the distance between the valence band edge and the vac-
uum level. The electron and hole populations n and p depend on the number of electron
and hole states per unit volume in the two bands (density of states Nc and Nv, respec-
tively, both functions of the energy), and on how those states are populated as a function
of the energy. According to statistical mechanics, electrons and holes follow at equi-
librium the Fermi–Dirac distribution,5 while the out-of-equilibrium distribution can be
often approximated, in optoelectronic devices, by the so-called quasi-Fermi distribution.
In the effective mass approximation, the density of states (DOS) in a 3D (bulk)
semiconductor can be shown to be
Nc(E) ≡gc(E) = 4π

whose behavior is shown in Fig. 1.15. Owing to the effect of heavy holes, the valence
band DOS typically is larger than the conduction band DOS.

tion statistics are expressed as

The Boltzmann approximation applies, in fact, if the distance between E and EF is

conduction or valence bands, and this condition is violated; in such cases, the full
Fermi–Dirac statistics has to be used.
The behavior of the two Fermi–Dirac distributions for electrons and holes is shown
in Fig. 1.16. Integrating the product between the density of states and the statistical
distributions (with the Boltzmann approximation) over all energies (i.e., from Ec to

The intrinsic concentration as a function of the temperature for Si, Ge, GaAs, InP and
GaN is shown in Fig. 1.17. With increasing T , the intrinsic concentration increases
exponentially; this is one of the main limitations in high-temperature semiconductor
operation, since when the intrinsic concentration is of the order of the doping, doping
becomes ineffective.
In equilibrium conditions, the product of the concentrations n and p does not depend
on the position of the Fermi level, and is equal to the square of the intrinsic concentration
(mass action law):
np = n2
i .

1.4.2
Electron and hole densities in doped semiconductors
The mass action law also holds for doped semiconductors. A semiconductor can be
doped with a donor (density ND), an element able to provide an additional electron
when substituting an atom of the native semiconductor lattice. Examples of donors in Si
are As and P (both belonging to group V, and therefore with an extra electron in the outer
shell vs. Si). The additional electron is weakly bound to the donor (ionization energy
into the conduction band of the order of 10 meV for shallow donors) and therefore can
easily be ionized and enter the conduction band, thus participating in conduction.6 In
this case, the semiconductor is called n-type. Semiconductors can also be doped with
acceptors (concentration NA). For instance, Si atoms have 4 electrons in the outermost
shell; acceptors (e.g., B, a group III element) have 3 electrons in the outermost shell
(i.e., one electron less than the substituted native atom) and can therefore attract an
electron from the valence band, leaving behind a hole (again with a ionization energy
of the order of 10 meV). The semiconductor in this case is called p-type.
If donors and acceptors are fully ionized one has, also taking into account the mass
action law (1.8):
n ≈N +
D ≈ND,
p ≈n2
i /ND n-type semiconductor
p ≈N −
A ≈NA,
n ≈n2
i /NA p-type semiconductor.
In a doped semiconductor, the carrier concentration evolves with temperature according
to a three-region behavior; the relevant intervals are the freeze-out, the saturation, and
the intrinsic range.
At extremely low temperature, most carriers do not have enough energy to ionize into
the conduction band, and the carrier population decreases with T well below the value
n ≈ND (freeze-out range). The intermediate range (called the saturation range), cor-
responding to normal device operation, begins at a temperature such as (3/2)kBT ≈20
meV, i.e., T ≈150 K (this is just an indicative value, since the donor or acceptor ion-
ization energy depends on the doping and semiconductor materials), and ends at a
temperature such as ni(T ) ≈ND (in n-type Si with ND = 1015 cm−3 this corresponds
to T ≈200oC). In the saturation range, n ≈ND or p ≈NA; the maximum operat-
ing temperature increases with increasing gap. Finally, above the saturation range we
ﬁnd the intrinsic range: at high temperature the intrinsic concentration becomes large
enough to ﬂood the semiconductor with electrons not originating from the donors (or
holes not originating from the acceptors).
6 A donor or acceptor introduces an isolated energy level in the forbidden band. Shallow donors have an
energy level ED close to the conduction band edge (typically a few meV), while for shallow acceptors
the energy level EA is close to the valence band. Deep donors and acceptors have energy levels close to
the center of the gap and act more as electron or hole traps (or recombination centers) than as dopants,
since their ionization (or electrical activation) is low. Ionized dopants follow electron- or hole-like Fermi
statistics: donors are almost 100% activated if the Fermi level is below the donor level, while acceptors are
almost 100% activated if the Fermi level is above the acceptor level. This implies, for example, that a deep
donor is not ionized in an n-type semiconductor, and even the activation of shallow donors ultimately drops
for extremely large n-type doping, since for increasing donor concentration the Fermi level ﬁnally becomes
larger than the donor level.

1.4 Carrier densities in a semiconductor
21
From the expressions for the electron and hole densities, the Fermi level can easily
be evaluated. In n-type semiconductors, the Fermi level increases vs. EFi, becom-
ing closer to the conduction band edge, while for p-type semiconductors the Fermi
level decreases and becomes closer to the valence band edge. For very high dop-
ing (e.g., in excess of 1019 cm−3), donors and acceptors cannot be assumed to be
100% ionized (or electrically activated) any longer, but their ionization is related to the
very position of the Fermi level and typically decreases, as already remarked, when
the Fermi level becomes larger than the donor or smaller than the acceptor energy
level.
In a degenerate semiconductor, the Fermi level (or the quasi-Fermi level out of equi-
librium) is very close to the conduction or valence band edges or even falls within one
of the two bands. Typically, a semiconductor cannot be made degenerate by doping, but
degeneracy is a condition that can be achieved out of equilibrium (e.g., in a direct-bias
pn junction under high carrier injection).
1.4.3
Nonequilibrium electron and hole densities
To address the out-of-equilibrium statistics in a simpliﬁed way, we note that deviations
from thermodynamic equilibrium may imply two quite different consequences: dis-
equilibrium between the electron and the hole populations, and disequilibrium in carrier
populations due to an applied (electric) ﬁeld.
In equilibrium, the electron and hole populations follow the mass action law, any
deviation from this being compensated for by generation–recombination (GR) processes
whereby electron–hole (e-h) pairs are generated or disappear by recombination. The
excess charge n′ or p′ (with respect to equilibrium) is removed according to the time
behavior
n′(t) = n′(0) exp(−t/τn),
with a characteristic time (called the excess lifetime, τn or τh for electrons and
holes, respectively) whose order of magnitude can range from a few milliseconds to
nanoseconds according to the restoring mechanism. Recombination processes basi-
cally involve an exchange of energy and momentum with other particles, e.g., phonons
(lattice vibrations, corresponding to the so-called thermal GR process), photons (radia-
tive GR), other electrons and holes (Auger recombination and impact generation).
If the carrier population deviation with respect to equilibrium is maintained by an
external cause (e.g., a photon ﬂux leading to radiative generation of e-h pairs) the
resulting out-of-equilibrium condition can be characterized by a slightly modiﬁed
form of the equilibrium probability distribution (called the quasi-Fermi distribu-
tion).
A second nonequilibrium situation derives from the effect of an applied electric
ﬁeld. While the average carrier velocity is zero at equilibrium, and therefore the
carrier distribution in the velocity space is symmetrical with respect to the origin,
application of an electric ﬁeld leads to an increase of the average velocity and to a
nonsymmetrical velocity distribution. For very large ﬁelds, the change in shape of

22
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
the distribution with respect to the equilibrium may become dramatic and a simple
quasi-Fermi approach will not be sufﬁcient. However, this form of extreme ﬁeld–carrier
disequilibrium is not essential in the analysis of most optoelectronic devices, and there-
fore a simpliﬁed discussion based on the static carrier velocity–ﬁeld properties will
sufﬁce.
To describe electron–hole imbalance with respect to the equilibrium, we there-
fore introduce the so called quasi-Fermi statistics, where the single Fermi level is
replaced by two separate quasi-Fermi levels EFn and EFh according to the following
formulae:
fn(E, EFn) =

where the relevant Boltzmann approximations have also been introduced. Within the
Boltzmann approximation the carrier densities become

while the mass action law can be modiﬁed to allow for a difference in the two quasi-
Fermi levels (in equilibrium EFn = EFh = EF):

(1.11)
In particular,
np > n2

for EFn > EFh (carrier injection)
np < n2

In the degenerate case, the Boltzmann approximation is invalid and we have to express
the charge density with the help of special functions (the Fermi–Dirac integrals):

A summary of some possible equilibrium bandstructures is shown in Fig. 1.19; notice
that the n-type and p-type degenerate cases are purely theoretical, since increasing
the doping level beyond a certain level makes EF > ED or EF < E A, thus decreas-
ing the donor or acceptor activation. This implies that the degenerate condition cannot
practically be obtained at equilibrium. Finally, Fig. 1.20 concerns examples out of
equilibrium; degeneracy arises in these cases from the high-injection condition.

1.5
Heterostructures
Crystals with different lattice constants grown on top of each other by epitaxial tech-
niques are affected by interface defects called misﬁt dislocations. Such defects operate
as electron or hole traps, and therefore the resulting structure is unsuited to the develop-
ment of electron devices. However, if the lattice mismatch between the substrate and the
heteroepitaxial overlayer is low or zero, an ideal or almost ideal crystal can be grown,
made of two different materials. The resulting structure is called a heterostructure, and,
since the electronic properties of the two layers are different, we also refer to it as a het-
erojunction. The material discontinuity arising in the heterojunction leads to important
electronic and optical properties, such as conﬁnement of carriers (related to the discon-
tinuity of the conduction or valence bands) and conﬁnement of radiation (due to the
bandgap discontinuity and to the related refractive index step).
Heterostructures can be lattice-matched (if the two sides have the same lattice con-
stant) or affected by a slight mismatch (indicatively, the maximum mismatch is of the
order of 1%), which induces tensile or compressive strain. In this case, we talk about
pseudomorphic or strained heterostructures, see Fig. 1.21. A small amount of strain in
the heterostructure can be beneﬁcial to the development of electronic or optoelectronic
devices, since it leads to additional degrees of freedom in the band structure engineer-
ing, and in many cases allows for an improvement of the material transport or optical
properties.
A double heterojunction made with a thin semiconductor layer (the thickness
should be typically of the order of 100 nm) sandwiched between two layers (e.g.,
AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs) creates a potential well in the conduction and/or valence band
and is often referred to as a quantum well (QW). A succession of weakly interacting

quantum wells is called a multi quantum well (MQW); if the MQW has many layers,
with signiﬁcant overlapping between the wavefunctions of adjacent wells, we ﬁnally
obtain a superlattice (SL). The artiﬁcial periodicity imposed by the superlattice over the
natural periodicity of the crystal introduces important modiﬁcations in the electronic

Semiconductor alloys
Heterostructures are largely based on semiconductor alloys. The idea behind alloys is
to create semiconductors having intermediate properties with respect to already exist-
ing “natural” semiconductors. Among such properties are the lattice constant a and the
energy gap Eg. In several material systems, both a and Eg approximately follow a lin-
ear law with respect to the individual component parameters. The motivation to tailor
the lattice constant is of course to achieve lattice matching to the substrate; tailoring the
energy gap gives the possibility to change the emitted photon energy, thus generating
practically important wavelengths, such as the 1.3 or 1.55 μm wavelengths needed for
long-haul ﬁber communications (since they correspond to minimum ﬁber dispersion and
absorption, respectively, see Fig. 1.22). Examples are alloys made of two components
and three elements (called ternary alloys: e.g., AlGaAs, alloy of GaAs and AlAs) and
alloys made of four components and elements (called quaternary alloys, e.g., InGaAsP,
alloy of InAs, InP, GaAs, GaP). By proper selection of the alloy composition, semicon-
ductor alloys emitting the right wavelength and matched to the right substrate can be
generated.

In order to quantitatively deﬁne an alloy, we have to consider that compound semi-
conductors (CS) are polar compounds with a metal M combined with a nonmetal N
in the form M N. Two different CSs sharing the same metal or nonmetal give rise to a
ternary alloy or compound:
(M1N)x (M2N)1−x =M1x M2(1−x)N,
e.g., AlxGa1−xAs
(M N1)y (M N2)1−y =M N1y N2(1−y),
e.g., GaAsyP1−y,
where x and 1 −x denote the mole fraction of the two metal components, and y and
1 −y denote the mole fraction of nonmetal components. Four different CSs sharing
two metal and two nonmetal components yield a quaternary alloy or compound. In the
following formulae, M and m are the metal components, N and n are the nonmetal
components, and α + β + γ = 1:
(M N)α (Mn)β (mN)γ (mn)1−α−β−γ = Mα+βm1−α−β Nα+γ n1−α−γ
= Mxm1−x Nyn1−y
(e.g., InxGa1−xAsyP1−y).
Most alloy properties can be derived from the component properties through (global
or piecewise) linear interpolation (Vegard law), often with second-order corrections
(Abeles law); examples are the lattice constant, the energy gap, the inverse of the
effective masses, and, in general, the bandstructure and related quantities. Varying the
composition of a ternary alloy (one degree of freedom) changes the gap and related
wavelength, but, at the same time, the lattice constant; in some cases (AlGaAs) the
two components (AlAs and GaAs) are already matched, so that alloys with arbitrary Al
content are lattice matched to the substrate (GaAs).
On the other hand, varying the composition of a quaternary alloy (two degrees of
freedom) independently changes both the gap and the lattice constant, so as to allow for
lattice matching to a speciﬁc substrate, e.g., InGaAsP on InP.

Evolution of the bandstructure of AlGaAs changing the Al content from 0 to 1.
The Vegard or Abeles laws must be applied with care in some cases. As an example,
consider the AlxGa1−xAs alloy and call P an alloy parameter, such as the energy gap.
The Vegard law can be written as:
P(x) = (1 −x)PGaAs + x PAlAs;
by inspection, this yields a linear interpolation between the two constituent parameters.
However, this law fails to accurately reproduce the behavior of the AlGaAs energy gap
because GaAs is direct bandgap, and AlAs is indirect. To clarify this point, let us con-
sider the simpliﬁed bandstructure of the alloy as shown in Fig. 1.23. We clearly see that
the main and secondary (X point) minima have the same level for x = 0.45; for larger
Al mole fraction, the material becomes indirect bandgap. Since the composition depen-
dence is different for the energy levels of the  and X minima, a unique Vegard law
fails to approximate the gap for any alloy composition, and a piecewise approximation
is required:
Eg ≈1.414 + 1.247x,
x < 0.45
Eg ≈1.985 + 1.147(x −0.45)2,
x > 0.45.
The same problems arise in the InGaAsP alloy, since GaP is indirect bandgap; thus, a
global Vegard approximation of the kind
PInGaAsP = (1 −x)(1 −y)PGaAs + (1 −x)yPGaP + xyPInP + x(1 −y)PInAs
(by inspection, the approximation is bilinear and yields the correct values for the four
semiconductor components) may be slightly inaccurate.
1.6.1
The substrate issue
Electronic and optoelectronic devices require to be grown on a suitable (typically, semi-
conductor) substrate. In practice, the only semiconductor substrates readily available
are those that can be grown into monocrystal ingots through Czochralsky or Bridgman

28
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
techniques – i.e., in order of decreasing quality and increasing cost, Si, GaAs, InP, SiC,
and a few others (GaP, GaSb, CdTe). Devices are to be grown so as to be either lattice
matched to the substrate, or slightly (e.g., 1%) mismatched (pseudomorphic approach).
The use of graded buffer layers allows us to exploit mismatched substrates, since it dis-
tributes the lattice mismatch over a larger thickness. This approach is often referred to
as the metamorphic approach; it is sometimes exploited both in electronic and in opto-
electronic devices. Metamorphic devices often used to have reliability problems related
to the migration of defects in graded buffer layers; however, high-quality metamorphic
ﬁeld-effect transistors with an InP active region on a GaAs substrate have recently been
developed with success.
1.6.2
Important compound semiconductor alloys
Alloys are often represented as a straight or curved segment (for ternary alloys) or
quadrilateral area (for quaternary alloys) in a plane where the x coordinate is the lattice
constant and the y coordinate is the energy gap; see Fig. 1.24. The segment extremes
and the vertices of the quadrilateral are the semiconductor components. In Fig. 1.24
some important alloys are reported:
• AlGaAs, lattice-matched for any composition to GaAs, direct bandgap up to an Al
mole content of 0.45.
• InGaAsP, which can be matched either to GaAs or to InP substrates; InP substrate
matching includes the possibility of emitting 1.55 or 1.3 μm wavelengths;7 the alloy
is direct bandgap, apart from around the GaP corner, whose gap is indirect.
• InAlAs, which can be lattice matched to InP with composition Al0.48In0.52As.
• InGaAs, a ternary alloy matched to InP with composition Ga0.47In0.53As; it is a
subset of the quaternary alloy InGaAsP.
• InGaAsSb, the antimonide family, a possible material for long-wavelength devices,
but with a rather underdeveloped technology vs. InGaAsP.
• HgCdTe, a ternary alloy particularly relevant to far infrared (FIR) detection owing to
the very small bandgap achievable.
• SiGe, an indirect bandgap alloy important for electronic applications (heterojunction
bipolar transistors) but also (to a certain extent) for detectors and electroabsorption
modulators;
• III-N alloys, such as AlGaN and InGaN, with applications in short-wavelength
sources (blue lasers) but also in RF and microwave power transistors. AlGaN can
be grown by pseudomorphic epitaxy on a GaN virtual substrate; GaN has in turn no
native substrate so far, but can be grown on SiC, sapphire (Al2O3) or Si. The InGaN
alloy is exploited in optoelectronic devices such as blue lasers and LEDs, besides
being able to cover much of the visible spectrum.8
7 InGaAsP lattice-matched to InP can emit approximately between 0.92 and 1.65 μm.
8 The InN gap is controversial, and probably is much smaller than the previously accepted value around 2
eV. The nitride data in Fig. 1.24 are from [8], Fig. 3.

Since GaN, AlN, and InN have the wurtzite (hexagonal) crystal structure, an equiva-
lent lattice constant aC,eq has to be deﬁned for comparison with cubic crystals, so as to
make the volume of the wurtzite cell VH (per atom) equal to the volume of a cubic cell
(per atom); taking into account that the wurtzite cell has 12 equivalent atoms, while the
cubic cell has 8 equivalent atoms, we must impose:

Bandstructure engineering: heterojunctions and quantum wells
Although the bandstructure of a semiconductor depends on the lattice constant a, which
is affected by the operating temperature and pressure, signiﬁcant variations in the band-
structure parameters cannot be obtained in practice. Nevertheless, semiconductor alloys

30
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
enable us to generate new, “artiﬁcial” semiconductors with band properties intermedi-
ate with respect to the components. A more radical change in the bandstructure occurs
when heterojunctions are introduced so as to form quantized structures. A deep varia-
tion in the density of states follows, with important consequences in terms of optical
properties (as we shall discuss later, the absorption proﬁle as a function of the photon
energy mimics the density of states). Moreover, strain in heterostructures allows for fur-
ther degrees of freedom, like controlling the degeneracy between heavy and light hole
subbands.
Heterojunctions are ideal, single-crystal junctions between semiconductors having
different bandstructures. As already recalled, lattice-matched or strained (pseudomor-
phic) junctions between different semiconductors or semiconductor alloys allow for
photon conﬁnement (through the difference in refractive indices), carrier conﬁnement
(through potential wells in conduction or valence bands), and quantized structures such
as superlattices, quantum wells, quantum dots, and quantum wires. An example of a het-
erostructure band diagram is shown in Fig. 1.25, where the band disalignment derives
from application of the afﬁnity rule (i.e., the conduction band discontinuity is the afﬁn-
ity difference, the valence band discontinuity is the difference in ionizations). In many
practical cases, however, band disalignments are dominated by interfacial effects and do
not follow the afﬁnity rule exactly; for instance, in the AlGaAs-GaAs heterostructure
one has
|Ec| ≈0.65Eg,
|Ev| ≈0.35Eg.
(1.14)
More speciﬁcally, the valence and conduction band discontinuities as a function of the
Al fraction are (in eV) [1]:
|Ev| = 0.46x
|Ec| =
 0.79x,
x < 0.41
0.475 −0.335x + 0.143x2,
x > 0.41.
According to the material parameters, several band alignments are possible, as shown in
Fig. 1.26; however, the most important situation in practice is the Type I band alignment
in which the energy gap of the narrowgap material is included in the gap of the widegap
material.

Heterojunctions can be made with two n-type or p-type materials (homotype hetero-
junctions) so as to form a pn junction (heterotype heterojunctions). Often, the widegap
material is conventionally denoted as N or P according to the type, the narrowgap mate-
rial as n or p. According to this convention, a heterotype heterojunction is, for example,
Np or nP and a narrowgap intrinsic layer sandwiched between two widegap doped
semiconductors is Ni P.
Single or double heterostructures can create potential wells in the conduction and/or
valence bands, which can conﬁne carriers so as to create conducting channels (with
application to electron devices, such as ﬁeld-effect transistors), and regions where
conﬁned carriers achieve high density and are able to recombine radiatively. In the
second case, the emitted radiation is conﬁned by the refractive index step associ-
ated with the heterostructure (the refractive index is larger in narrowgap materials).
An example of this concept is reported in Fig. 1.27, a Ni P structure in direct bias
that may operate like the active region of a light-emitting diode or a semiconductor
laser.
Carriers trapped by the potential well introduced by a double heterostructure are con-
ﬁned in the direction orthogonal to the well, but are free to move in the two other
directions (i.e., parallel to the heterojunction). However, if the potential well is very
narrow the allowed energy levels of the conﬁned electrons and holes will be quantized.
The resulting structure, called a quantum well (QW), has a different bandstructure vs.
bulk, where sets of energy subbands appear (see Fig. 1.28). Also the density of states is
strongly affected.
The quantum behavior of carriers in narrow (conduction or valence band) potential
wells originated by heterojunctions between widegap and narrowgap semiconductors
can be analyzed by applying the Schrödinger equation to the relevant particles (elec-
tron or holes) described in turn by a 3D effective mass approximation. Solution of the
Schrödinger equation enables us to evaluate the energy levels and subbands, given the
well potential proﬁle. In a rectangular geometry, we start from bulk (3D motion possible,

no conﬁnement) and obtain, by progressively restricting the degrees of freedom of the
particle, the so-called reduced dimensionality structures corresponding to:
1. Conﬁnement in one direction (x): particles are conﬁned along x by a potential well
but are free to move along y and z (quantum well).
2. Conﬁnement in two directions (x and y): particles are conﬁned along x and y, but
they are free to move along z (quantum wire).
3. Conﬁnement in three directions (x, y, z): particles are entirely conﬁned and cannot
move (quantum dot).
For a quantum well deﬁned in a Cartesian space, the particle (electron or hole) wave-
function can be expressed, in the effective mass approximation, as the product of three
factors:9
ψ(x, y, z) = φ(x) exp

−jky y

exp (−jkzz) .
(1.15)
9 The effective mass approximation implies that, in the absence of the well, the particle is completely free,
i.e., it behaves like a free electron with proper effective mass. The approximate total electron wavefunction
of a conﬁned electron is therefore the product of the electron Bloch function and the envelope wavefunction.

1.7 Bandstructure engineering: heterojunctions and quantum wells
33
For a particle at rest (ky = 0, kz = 0) the wavefunction reduces to φ(x), called the
envelope wavefunction, to be derived from the solution of the 1D Schrödinger equation
with the well potential proﬁle U(x). Notice that, independent on the kinetic energy
of the particle, the probability (corresponding to the particle distribution in space) is
always:
|ψ(x, y, z)|2 = |φ(x)|2 ,
i.e. the particle density only depends on the shape of the envelope wavefunction φ(x),
and in particular only depends on the x coordinate. The envelope wavefunction therefore
provides a picture of the particle distribution in the well. From the allowed energies Ei
we can express the total particle energy as
E = Ek + Ei = Ei +
¯h2
2m∗(k2
y + k2
z ),
where Ek is the particle kinetic energy. This expression holds for all values of i;
therefore the quantum well introduces in the conduction or valence bands a subband
structure; in each subband the dispersion relation is, at least approximately, parabolic,
but, contrarily to the 3D case, the particle motion occurs in the plane (y, z) only. Parti-
cles therefore form a 2D gas, i.e. a population able to move in a 2D space only. We
suppose that the effective mass is isotropic and (for simplicity) independent of the
subband considered.
For a quantum wire (QWire), we have a similar situation: the particle wavefunction
can be written in the form
ψ(x, y, z) = φ(x, y) exp (−jkzz) ,
where φ(x, y) satisﬁes a 2D Schrödinger equation with proper energies Ei j. The
particle energy can therefore be written as
E = Ek + Ei j = Ei j +
¯h2
2m∗k2
z ,
i.e., the dispersion relation is parabolic in kz, starting from one of the allowed ener-
gies Ei j. Finally, a quantum dot only exhibits ﬁnite-energy states with energy Ei jk, in
which the particle cannot move along any spatial direction (but can undergo radiative
recombination and intersubband transitions).
1.7.1
Carrier density and density of states in a quantum well
We want now to evaluate the sheet density ns (cm−2) of the electrons trapped in a
conduction band QW (a similar treatment would apply to holes in a valence band QW),
on the basis of the system Fermi level EF. As usual, we can exploit the product of the
density of states in the 2D system (QW) multiplied by the Fermi–Dirac distribution fn,
see (1.4):
dns(E) = g2D(E) fn(E)dE,

34
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
where g2D(E) is the QW density of states (per unit surface). Assuming that the
QW energy levels are El, l = 1, 2, 3... and that each energy level has an associated
wavefunction
ψl(x, y, z) = φl(x) exp(−jky y) exp(−jkzz),
we immediately notice that the carrier distribution depends only on x according to the
probability |φl(x)|2. We suppose that the wavefunction is normalized with respect to
the total concentration per unit surface of the electrons belonging to each subband (hav-
ing minimum energy El). The total density of states can be obtained by summing the
densities relative to each subband:
g2D(E) =

l
gl(E).
To evaluate gl, we suppose that the 2D electron gas is enclosed in a (large) poten-
tial well with inﬁnitely high barriers placed in y = 0, y = L y and z = 0, z = Lz, with
L y, Lz ≫W, where W is the QW thickness. Quantization in the transversal plane only
allows for the (positive) wavenumbers

where an isotropic effective mass has been introduced. The number of allowed states
with E < Ek can be derived, taking into account that only positive wavevectors are
considered, by dividing the area of one quarter of the circle with radius √2m∗Ek/¯h of
the (kx, ky) plane by the area associated with each state, i.e., π2/(Lx L y). With a further
factor 2 accounting for the spin, we ﬁnally obtain

Contrary to the 3D case, we do not have to invoke the Boltzmann approximation to
obtain a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. The above expression
is therefore valid for both degenerate and nondegenerate cases.
A sketch of the QW DOS showing the electron and the hole density of states is
shown in Fig. 1.29. In the valence band the DOS actually follows a composite staircase

the state ordering with increasing hole energy is HH1, LH1, HH2, LH2, etc. In both
staircases the position of steps is variable, but the step size is the same for each kind of
particle (electrons, heavy holes, light holes). In general, the fundamental level for heavy
and light holes will be different (E1lh ̸= E1hh), thus removing the degeneracy between
HH and LH typical of 3D systems.

the directions x and y, while it is quantized in z, we can express the total wavefunction as
ψ = φ(z)ψx(x)ψy(y).

In the above expression the conduction band edge Ec is taken as the reference energy
(since we assumed U = 0 in the well). The total wavefunction is thus
ψ = φ(z)ψx(x)ψy(y) = A sin(kzz) exp(−jkxx) exp(−jky y),
which can be normalized, for example, by imposing that the total probability is unity:

Wavefunctions in the well therefore are either even or odd with respect to the center of

Carrier density and density of states in a quantum wire
The density of states nl(E) of a quantum wire can be evaluated in a similar way. In the
1D case, we can write
dnl(E) = g1D(E) fn(E)dE,
where g1D(E) is the number of states per unit length and unit energy interval. The
energy levels Ei j of the wire, obtained through a solution of the 2D quantum problem,
can be conveniently ordered through a single integer index l as El, l = 1, 2, 3... such as
El < El+1; each energy level has the associated wavefunction ψl(x, y, z):
ψl(x, y, z) = φl(x, y) exp(−jkzz)
with envelope wavefunction φl(x, y). The carrier distribution in the plane orthogonal to
the wire direction follows the probability |φl(x, y)|2, which we assume as normalized
with respect to the total concentration of the electrons in subband l. Also in this case,
the total state density can be obtained by summing contributions from all individual
subbands:
g1D(E) =

l
gl(E).
To evaluate gl we artiﬁcially limit the QW through potential barriers located in x = 0,
x = Lz. Quantization allows for the positive wavenumbers:
kz = n π

The number of states N(E) with kinetic energy Ek < E can be evaluated by considering
the states in the interval [0, Ek], where
Ek =

Since the corresponding kz value is √2m∗Ek/¯h, the number of allowed states having
energy < Ek can be obtained from the ratio of √2m∗Ek/¯h and the length associated
with each state, which is π/Lz; also accounting for the spin we ﬁnally obtain

1.7.3
Superlattices
Molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) allows several, almost monoatomic, layers to be grown
in a controlled and orderly way. The resulting structure is a MQW or, for a large number
of (coupled) wells, a superlattice. From the electronic standpoint, N coupled QWs cause
the N-fold splitting of the system energy levels, ﬁnally leading to subbands, in much
the same way as coupled atoms merge their individual energy levels into crystal energy
bands.11 An example of such a subband structure is shown in Fig. 1.33. Superlattices are
therefore a kind of artiﬁcial 3D medium allowing for new features – e.g., low-energy
transitions between subbands can be exploited to absorb (emit) long-wavelength IR.
Superlattices can also be obtained by a periodic arrangement of QWires or QDs.
1.7.4
Effect of strain on bandstructure
Tensile or compressive strain changes the semiconductor bandstructure in several ways.
A ﬁrst consequence concerns the lattice constant becoming larger (tensile isotropic
10 The QD density of states is purely indicative, since the position and area of each δ function depends on the
dot shape. In real structures, the density of states has ﬁnite peaks due to linewidth-broadening mechanisms.
11 The basic differences between a MQW and a superlattice is the well number (typically small or large) and
above all in the coupling between the wavefunctions of neighboring wells. If the coupling is weak almost
isolated energy levels are generated rather than subbands.

strain) or smaller (compressive isotropic strain); since the energy gap is inversely pro-
portional to the lattice constant (at least in a direct bandgap material: in indirect bandgap
semiconductors local trends can mask this simple effect), Eg increases with compres-
sive strain and decreases with tensile strain. Moreover, strain eliminates the degeneracy
of HH and LH states, leading (in 3D) to heavier (compressive uniaxial strain) or lighter
(tensile uniaxial strain) holes. Such effects are shown in Fig. 1.34.
In a QW, the situation is even more complex, since the equivalent gap (i.e., the dis-
tance between the fundamental levels in the conduction and valence bands) changes.
However, degeneracy is usually already removed without strain (the ﬁrst heavy hole
subband being typically on top, as already remarked).
Proper tensile strain can bring back degeneracy, which, in some optoelec-
tronic devices (e.g., in electroabsorption modulators or detectors) allows for

42
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
polarization-independent operation, see p. 407. The ﬁrst light hole subband can be also
brought on top by tensile strain, thus reducing the hole density of states effective mass.
This makes it easier, at least in theory, to achieve population inversion and therefore
positive gain, with advantages in QW laser threshold condition, see p. 287.
1.8
Semiconductor transport and generation–recombination
1.8.1
Drift and diffusion
Under the application of an external electric ﬁeld, electrons and holes experience a
driving force that increases their average velocity. Electrons and holes under equilibrium
condition (no applied ﬁeld) at a temperature T have a Fermi–Dirac (Boltzmann) energy
distribution, with average (kinetic) energy Eave ≈3kBT/2 (39 meV at 300 K). This
means that, although the velocity or momentum distribution is symmetric with respect
to the origin (i.e., carriers have zero ensemble average velocity), the root mean square
(r.m.s.) carrier velocity (also called the thermal velocity) is extremely high (of the order
of 107 cm/s). In the presence of an applied ﬁeld, the ensemble average velocity assumes
a value proportional to the electric ﬁeld:
vn,ave = −μnE,
vh,ave = μhE,
where μn and μh are the electron and hole mobilities, measured in cm2 V−1s−1. The
low-ﬁeld mobility depends on the interaction with lattice vibrations (phonons), impuri-
ties, etc., and typically decreases with increasing doping and increasing temperature (at
least, at ambient temperature and above). For very large ﬁelds (values around 10 kV/cm,
depending on the semiconductor) the average velocity saturates:
vn,ave →vn,sat,
vh,ave →vh,sat,
where the saturation velocities have magnitude around 107 cm/s. The motion of elec-
trons and holes due to the application of an electric ﬁeld is called the drift motion and
gives rise to the drift (conduction) current density:
J n,dr = −qnvn,ave = qnμnE
(1.20)
J h,dr = qpvh,ave = qpμhE.
(1.21)
As already remarked, the average carrier velocity is generally limited by scattering with
phonons and impurities. However, for extremely small time (picoseconds) or space (≪
1 μm, also depending on material) scales, electrons and holes can experience ballistic
motion, i.e., motion unaffected by collisions. In such conditions, the average carrier
velocity can be substantially higher in the presence of strong electric ﬁelds than the
static saturation velocity. Such effect is called velocity overshoot and plays a role in
increasing the speed of transistors such as nanometer-gate ﬁeld-effect transistors.

1.8 Semiconductor transport and generation–recombination
43
Electrons and holes also exhibit diffusion due to concentration gradients, yielding the
diffusion current densities
J n,d = q Dn∇n,
J h,d = −q Dh∇p,
where Dn and Dh are the electron and hole diffusivities, respectively. At or near equi-
librium the diffusivities and mobilities follow the Einstein relation Dα = (kBT/q)μα,
α = n, h.
The electron velocity–ﬁeld curves of a few semiconductors are shown in Fig. 1.14. In
compound semiconductors such as GaAs, InP, and InGaAs (lattice matched to InP) the
electron velocity–ﬁeld curve is nonmonotonic: at low electric ﬁeld, electrons are mainly
in the  minimum of the conduction band, but with increasing ﬁeld they are ultimately
scattered into the indirect-bandgap minima, where their velocity is lower. As a result, the
average velocity decreases. This happens for electric ﬁelds of the order of 3 kV/cm in
GaAs where the energy difference is about 300 meV, but for larger ﬁelds in InP where
a larger energy difference is involved. The saturation velocity is, however, similar in
all semiconductors, including Si, which has a monotonically increasing velocity with a
much lower initial (low ﬁeld) mobility. The hole mobility in compound semiconductors
is similar to (or even worse than) the hole mobility in Si, and therefore n-type (or npn)
transistors are preferred for high-speed applications.
1.8.2
Generation and recombination
Generation–recombination (GR) of carriers is described by generation and recombina-
tion rates for electrons and holes (Gn for the number of electrons generated per unit time
and volume, Rn for the number of electrons recombining per unit time and volume, and
similarly for holes) and by the electron and hole net recombination rates:
Un = Rn −Gn,
Uh = Rh −Gh.
In many conditions, moreover, Un = Uh. This always happens in DC stationary con-
ditions, and whenever the GR process is band-to-band, i.e., involves direct transitions
between the valence and conduction bands. In such a case, generation of an e-h pair
immediately causes the increase of the electron and hole populations. However, GR can
take place through intermediate traps or recombination centers, acting as electron or
hole reservoirs; in such cases, the instantaneous net recombination rates of electrons
and holes can be different in time-varying conditions. Since the net recombination rate
should vanish in equilibrium, in many cases we can write
Un = rn(pn −n2
i ),
where the recombination term is proportional to pn and the generation term to n2
i . From
a physical standpoint, the pn dependence suggests that recombination involves a col-
lision process whose probability increases with increasing electron and hole densities.
Very often the recombination rate rn pn can be conveniently expressed in terms of a
lifetime τ. For deﬁniteness, let us consider the electron (excess) density n; the excess
electron lifetime is deﬁned by the rate equation

44
Semiconductors, alloys, heterostructures
dn′
dt ≈−n′
τn
,
(1.22)
where in principle the electron lifetime τn depends inversely on the carrier population
(τn = 1/rn p). However, τn is constant for excess minority carriers (electrons) in a p-
type semiconductor (where p ≈NA; same for the dual case of an n-type semiconductor
with excess holes). The lifetime deﬁnition implies (at least, if τn is constant) an excess
electron population exponentially decreasing with time,
n′(t) = n′(0) exp(−t/τn),
and is deﬁned as the average time between the carrier (electron–hole pair) creation and
the carrier recombination, i.e.,
⟨t⟩=

n′(t) dt =

As already recalled, GR mechanisms can be phonon-assisted or thermal, photon-
assisted or radiative (optical), and, ﬁnally, assisted by other electrons or holes. More-
over, generation and recombination can occur through interband transitions (direct
mechanisms), or through indirect mechanism assisted by intermediate trap levels in the
forbidden band. In direct-bandgap semiconductors, direct optical GR is typically the
dominant mechanism, whereas in indirect-bandgap semiconductors trap-assisted GR
can be a stronger competitor to the weaker optical GR.12
The spatial evolution of excess carrier densities (for deﬁniteness, we consider excess
electrons with density n′) in a region with negligible electric ﬁeld is dominated by the
carrier GR and diffusion; solution of the continuity equation for the diffusion current in
the presence of carrier recombination modeled according to the lifetime approximation
(1.22) yields for n′(x) the exponential solution
n′(x) = A exp(−x/Ln) + B exp(x/Ln),
where A and B are determined from the boundary conditions and Ln is the (excess)
electron diffusion length. A similar solution holds for excess holes, with Lh the (excess)
hole diffusion length. From the continuity equation we obtain
Lα =
	
Dατα,
α = n, h.
1.8.3
Trap-assisted (Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination
Consider a semiconductor with a trap density Nt, and suppose that traps introduce, in the
forbidden gap, a discrete energy level Et. Thermal carrier transitions from the valence to
the conduction bands are made easier by the trap level, since two successive transitions
with E ≈Eg/2 (if the trap level is at midgap) are much more probable than a single
transition with E = Eg. A detailed analysis shows that, in stationary conditions, the
net trap-assisted recombination rate can be expressed as
12 In indirect-bandgap semiconductors the optical GR is also phonon-assisted, and therefore (partly) thermal.

Trap-assisted GR is called Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) generation–recombination. The
coefﬁcient g is an nondimensional parameter, called the trap degeneracy factor, and EFi
is the intrinsic Fermi level, close to midgap. Expression (1.23) can be simpliﬁed under
some important conditions.
Consider ﬁrst a doped semiconductor, e.g., n-type, and suppose r SRH

Since ni ≪n, the minimum lifetime is obtained for a trap energy near midgap; such a
minimum lifetime will be given by (1.24). The lifetime is independent of semiconductor
doping and decreases for increasing trap density. Midgap traps are often called recombi-
nation centers, owing to their ability to cause recombination in a semiconductor and to
reduce the thermal lifetime vs. the intrinsic material. Similar remarks apply to the elec-
tron lifetime in a p-doped semiconductor. A second important case concerns the role of
SRH recombination as a competitor to radiative recombination in high-injection con-
ditions. Suppose now that for quasi-neutrality n ≈p and assume for simplicity again

thermal velocity vth and the electron or hole trap cross section σn or σh:
r SRH
cn

r SRH
ch
= vthσh.
Trap cross sections are of the order of 10−15 cm2 in Si for electrons and holes while,
for III-V materials, σn ≈10−14 cm2, σh ≈10−13 cm2. Finally, the thermal velocity is
vth = √3kBT/m∗, with order of magnitude vth ≈107 cm/s.
Trap-assisted recombination is a strong competitor of radiative recombination in
indirect-gap semiconductors. In fact, consider that in Si we have
r SRH
c
≈105 m/s · 10−17 m2 = 10−12 m3/s,
so that, for a middle-gap trap density as low as Nt = 1014 cm−3, one obtains
τ SRH
0
=
1
10−12 · 1020 = 10 ns,
a value close to the radiative lifetime in indirect-bandgap semiconductors. The situation
is much more favorable in direct-bandgap semiconductors, where the radiative lifetime
is lower.
1.8.4
Auger recombination and generation by impact ionization
The electron- or hole-assisted recombination is called Auger recombination, and the
related rate is proportional to p2n or pn2, implying proportionality not only with respect
to the colliding populations (electrons and holes) but also to the population of the energy
suppliers. Due to this dependence, the Auger recombination is important (and is indeed
an unwanted competitor of the radiative recombination) in high-injection devices like
semiconductor lasers. The inverse process of the Auger recombination is the genera-
tion by impact ionization. In high-ﬁeld conditions (i.e., for ﬁelds of the order of 100
kV/cm), electrons and holes gather enough energy from the electric ﬁeld between
two successive scattering events (i.e., collisions with phonons, impurities or – less
important – other carriers) to be able to interact with another electron and promote
it to the conduction band. Each electron or hole is therefore able to generate, over a
certain length, a number of electron–hole pairs, that undergo in turn the same process
(energy increase, scattering and e-h pair generation). The resulting chain can lead to
diverging current, i.e., to avalanche breakdown in the semiconductor. Avalanche break-
down occurs for electric ﬁelds of the order of the breakdown ﬁeld, which increases
exponentially with the material gap; see Fig. 1.35.

avalanche generation of electron–hole pairs to amplify the photocurrent.

Semiconductor optical properties

Modeling the interaction between EM waves and the semiconductor
The interaction between an electromagnetic (EM) wave and a semiconductor can be
analyzed at several levels. EM waves can be described as classical ﬁelds (i.e., in terms
of the electric and magnetic ﬁeld) or, according to quantum mechanics, as a set of pho-
tons traveling with the speed of light. The crystal’s response to the EM wave may be
modeled in terms of macroscopic parameters such as the permittivity and permeabil-
ity (the macroscopic picture of the interaction) or with reference to the microscopic
interaction mechanisms between carriers and photons, leading to photon absorption
or emission (spontaneous and stimulated) and, correspondingly, to electron–hole (e-h)
pair generation or recombination (the microscopic picture). Moreover, we can look
at the interaction between the EM wave and the semiconductor from two closely
related viewpoints: the EM wave standpoint, yielding the wave absorption and gain,
and the semiconductor standpoint, leading to the e-h generation and recombination
rates.
Figure 2.1 presents a summary of the EM spectrum with decreasing energy and
increasing wavelength. Two frequency (energy) bands are of main interest for high-
speed optoelectronic applications.
The ﬁrst band concerns the semiconductor sources, whose energy ranges from the
near infrared to the UV (roughly 3 octaves, from 0.5 eV to 4 eV). Semiconductor energy
gaps cover the same interval. The second band is the frequency range corresponding
to radiofrequencies and microwaves (up to 40 GHz) or even millimeter waves, up to
300 GHz, where the spectra of the modulating and/or detected electrical signals carried
by an optical transmission system are found. Electronic devices and circuits for high-
speed optoelectronic systems operate in this range.
The visible spectrum (from 700 to 400 nm, see Table 2.1), is relevant to several appli-
cations, also involving, as might be expected, human vision, but in fact most telecom
systems work at lower frequencies, around 800 nm (“ﬁrst window” of optical ﬁbers)
or around 1300 and 1550 nm (“second window” and “third window” of optical ﬁbers),
see Fig. 1.22. As already noted, the second and third windows correspond to minimum
dispersion and attenuation, respectively.

The macroscopic view: permittivities and permeabilities
We recall now a few macroscopic properties of the interaction between the EM
wave and matter. Assuming the electric ﬁeld E (V/m) and the magnetic ﬁeld H
(A/m) as causes, the effects produced in the interacting material are the dielectric
displacement vector D (C/m2) and the magnetic induction B (tesla, T), respec-
tively. In a linear, memoriless (or nondispersive) isotropic medium the instantaneous

54
Semiconductor optical properties
value of the cause is directly proportional to the instantaneous value of the effect,
so that1
D(t) = ϵE(t),
B(t) = μH(t),
where ϵ is the dielectric permittivity (farad per meter, F/m) and μ is the magnetic perme-
ability (henry per meter, H/m). Vacuum (or free space) is a particularly simple example
of a linear, nondispersive medium, with parameters
ϵ = ϵ0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F/m,
μ = μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m.
The permittivity and permeability can in turn be expressed in terms of the in vacuo
parameter as
ϵ = ϵrϵ0,
μ = μrμ0,
where ϵr is the relative permittivity and μr is the relative permeability. In all cases
considered here, μr = 1, i.e., the medium is nonmagnetic. The material refractive index
(or index of refraction) is nr = √ϵr.
For time-varying harmonic ﬁelds (i.e., having time dependence exp(jωt)) we asso-
ciate to the electrical ﬁelds the complex phasors D(ω) and E(ω) such that
E(t) =
√
2 Re

E(ω) exp(jωt)

,
D(t) =
√
2 Re

D(ω) exp(jωt)

.
The two phasors are related by a complex, frequency-dependent dielectric permittiv-
ity as
D(ω) = ϵ(ω)E(ω) = (ϵ′ −jϵ′′)E(ω),
where the imaginary part is related to material losses. In a dispersive material, the com-
plex dielectric permittivity varies with frequency. With the complex permittivity we can
associate a complex refractive index nr = √ϵr, whose imaginary part is associated with
losses:
nr(ω) = n′
r(ω) −jn′′
r (ω).
In general, EM waves interact with all the electric charges or dipoles in a medium,
including (with decreasing mass) molecules, atoms, and electrons. With increasing fre-
quency, each of those interactions ceases in turn to be effective at a certain cutoff
frequency, above which the relevant contribution to the dielectric response vanishes.
Moreover, close to each cutoff frequency losses have a peak. The resulting overall
behavior is qualitatively as shown in Fig. 2.2.
Since the permittivity describes the frequency-domain response of a causal system
(where the input is the electric ﬁeld and the output the dielectric displacement ﬁeld),
1 Given an independent variable x (the cause) and a dependent variable y (the effect) we say that the relation
between x and y is memoriless (y(t) = f (x(t))) when the instantaneous value of y depends only on the
instantaneous value of x. If this does not hold true, the relation is called dispersive or with memory and
formally we write y(t) = f (x(t), d/dt).

it has to satisfy to a set of integral relations between the real and imaginary parts of

where P denotes the principal part. Since the real and imaginary parts of the permittivity
are related, the real part can be derived from measurements of the imaginary part and
vice versa. Moreover, a variation of the real part (due, e.g., to the electrooptic effect,
see Section 6.3.1) implies a variation of the imaginary part (i.e., of the absorption),
and vice versa. This has a signiﬁcant impact on the spurious frequency modulation
(chirp) of electroabsorption modulators (EAMs) and of directly modulated lasers, see
Section 6.8.3 and 5.12.3.

An example of the resulting behavior is shown in Fig. 2.3 for the normalized value
ϵ = 2ϵ0 at low frequency; removing the step discontinuity by modeling the permittivity
variation through a continuous function, the singularity in the imaginary part peak also
disappears. In general, a variation of the real part corresponds to a peak in material
losses.
In a lossy medium, the phasor associated with the electric ﬁeld of a plane wave (i.e.,

for a generic EM wave) propagating in the z direction is

where α = 2¯α is the absorption. The absorption coefﬁcient α is always associated with
the same symbol as the attenuation (denoted only in this chapter as ¯α). Absorption and
attenuation can be expressed in natural units (m−1 or Np/m, Neper per meter) and in

Pop(0) = 10 log10 eαz = 4.343αz →α|dB/m = 8.686 ¯α|Np/m ,
i.e., attenuation and absorption in dB/m are expressed by the same number. Remember
that the value in dB/m must not be used in connection with exp(−αz) or exp(−αz)
expressions; the following conversion formulae can be used (α is the attenuation, α the
absorption):
α|dB/m = 8.6859 α|Np/m
α|dB/m = 4.3429 α|Np/m = 8.6859 α|Np/m
α|Np/m = 0.1151 α|dB/m = 11.51 α|dB/cm
α|Np/m = 0.2303 α|dB/m = 0.2303 α|dB/m = 23.03 α|dB/cm .
2 In discussing the microscopic interaction between photons and electrons the photon energy is, however,
always related to the free space wavelength, which for simplicity will be denoted in that context as λ.

Semiconductor optical properties
2.2.1
Isotropic vs. anisotropic media
The D and E ﬁelds are parallel only in isotropic materials. In an anisotropic medium,
D and E will, in general, have different directions. This can be modeled by introducing
the permittivity as a matrix, i.e., as the Cartesian representation of a tensor:
D = ϵ · E →
⎛
⎝
Dx
Dy
Dz
⎞
⎠=
⎛
⎝
ϵxx
ϵxy
ϵxz
ϵyx
ϵyy
ϵyz
ϵzx
ϵzy
ϵzz
⎞
⎠
⎛
⎝
Ex
Ey
Ez
⎞
⎠.
In all media considered, the permittivity matrix is symmetrical, i.e., ϵi j = ϵ ji. It can be
shown that a proper choice of the rectangular reference system (the principal axes) leads
to a diagonal permittivity matrix. The permittivity tensor is diagonal in an isotropic
medium for any orientation of the Cartesian axes; moreover, all diagonal values are
equal, i.e., ϵ = ϵ I, where I is the identity matrix. In an anisotropic medium the repre-
sentation of the permittivity tensor in the principal axes can assume different features,
according to whether all diagonal values are different, or two are equal and one is
different. We have three possible cases:
1. All diagonal values are different, i.e.
ϵ =
⎛
⎝
ϵxx
0
0
0
ϵyy
0
0
0
ϵzz
⎞
⎠.
In this case, the medium is biaxial.
2. Two diagonal values are equal: assume for instance that ϵxx = ϵyy = ϵo (the ordinary
permittivity), while ϵzz = ϵe (the extraordinary permittivity). In this case, we have
ϵ =
⎛
⎝
ϵo
0
0
0
ϵo
0
0
0
ϵe
⎞
⎠.
The z axis is the optical or extraordinary axis, while any direction in the plane
orthogonal to z is the ordinary axis. Therefore, the medium is isotropic with respect
to rotations in the plane orthogonal to the optical axis. In this case, the medium is
uniaxial.
3. All diagonal values are equal:
ϵ =

In this case, the medium is isotropic. All cubic semiconductors are isotropic.
A summary of the cases considered is shown in Fig. 2.4.

2.3
The microscopic view: EM wave–semiconductor interaction
At a microscopic level, an EM wave with frequency f is interpreted as a collec-
tion of photons of energy E ph = h f = ¯hω. Photons are zero-mass particles, traveling
with speed c0/nr. Photons have momentum p = ¯hk, where k is the propagating wave
wavevector;3 the magnitude of the momentum is 2π/λ. Always at a microscopic level,
semiconductors are containers of charged particles (electrons and holes) that interact
with the EM wave photons. The interaction can be visualized as a collision or scattering
process; the possibility of interaction is quite obvious, since charged particles in motion
are subject to the Coulomb force (EM wave electric ﬁeld) and to the Lorentz force (mag-
netic ﬁeld of the EM wave). However, the semiconductor response is peculiar when
compared with the response of a generic dielectric material due to the presence of band-
to-band processes. In fact, the useful semiconductor response is dominated by the ability
of radiation to cause band-to-band carrier transitions with corresponding emission or
absorption of a photon.
A useful relation exists between the EM wave photon energy and the related
wavelength; since λf = c0 one has
E ph = h f = hc0
λ
= 4.136 × 10−15 eV s · 2.998 × 108 m/s
λ|μm × 10−6 m
= 1.24
λ|μm
eV.
(2.1)
Therefore, wavelengths of the order of 1 μm are associated with energies of the order
of 1 eV, which in fact correspond to “typical” semiconductor bandgaps.
In the EM wave–semiconductor interaction, three cases are possible according to the
value of E ph vs. the energy gap Eg:
1. E ph < Eg, as in RF, microwaves, and far infrared (FIR): the interaction is weak
and does not involve band-to-band processes, but only the dielectric response and
interband processes (e.g., the so-called free electron/hole absorption);
3 For brevity the wavevector k is often referred to as momentum, in particular when discussing particles.

60
Semiconductor optical properties
2. E ph ≈Eg and E ph > Eg, as in near infrared (NIR), visible light, and ultravio-
let (UV): light interacts strongly through band-to-band processes leading to the
generation–recombination of e-h pairs and, correspondingly, to the absorption–
emission of photons;
3. E ph ≫Eg, as for X rays: high-energy ionizing interactions take place, i.e., each
photon causes the generation of a high-energy e-h pair, which generates a large num-
ber of e-h pairs through avalanche processes. This case is exploited in high-energy
particle and radiation detectors, but it is outside the scope of our discussion.
Optical processes leading to band-to-band transitions involve at least one photon and
one e-h pair. At a microscopic level, there are three possible fundamental processes:
1. Photon absorption (and e-h pair generation): the photon energy (momentum conser-
vation is discussed later) is supplied to a valence band electron, which is promoted
to the conduction band, leaving a free hole in the valence band. Because of the
absorption process, the EM wave decreases its amplitude and power.
2. Photon stimulated emission (and e-h pair recombination): a photon stimulates the
emission of a second photon with the same frequency and wavevector; the e-h pair
recombines to provide the photon energy. The emitted photon is coherent with the
stimulating EM wave, i.e., it increases the amplitude of the EM ﬁeld and the EM
wave power through a gain process.
3. Photon spontaneous emission (and e-h pair recombination): a photon is emitted
spontaneously; the e-h pair recombines to provide the photon energy. Since the
emitted photon is incoherent, the process does not imply the ampliﬁcation of an
already existing wave, but rather the excitation of an EM ﬁeld with a possibly
broad frequency spectrum (if many photons are incoherently emitted in a speciﬁc
bandwidth).
The three processes are shown in Fig. 2.5, Fig. 2.6, and Fig. 2.7, respectively. Note
that absorption and stimulated emission are in fact the same process with time reversal.
The rules of the photon–electron interaction are established by quantum mechanics
through the so-called perturbation theory. According to the perturbation theory, the
interaction must satisfy two sets of rules. The ﬁrst set is quite obvious and coincides with

classical collision rules, i.e., the conservation of the total energy and momentum from
before to after the interaction. The second set is less obvious and consists of the so called
selection rules, according to which some interactions are in fact not allowed (i.e., their
probability, or interaction strength, is zero), although they satisfy energy and momentum
conservation. Selection rules derive from a detailed quantum-mechanical treatment of
the system before and after the interaction, including the particle wavefunctions in the
initial and ﬁnal states (e.g., the electron wavefunctions in the valence and conduction
bands).

where the summation extends to all particles involved in the interaction in the initial and
ﬁnal states (namely, electrons and photons). Holes are not explicitly taken into account,
as long as their energy and momentum do not vary in the process. Moreover, energies

and momenta are evaluated with respect to an absolute reference, not a local reference
to the conduction band minimum or valence band maximum.
To make explicit examples of energy and momentum conservation we refer to a few
important cases:
1. Absorption of a photon through a direct process, i.e., a process involving only
electrons and photons. One has
E f = Ei + E ph,
k f = ki + k ph,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the conduction band, Ei is the initial
energy of the electron in the valence band, E ph is the energy of the absorbed photon
(similarly for momenta). We can equivalently write
E f i = E f −Ei = E ph = h f,
k f i = k f −ki = k ph = 2π
λ
kph,
implying that the changes in energy and momentum of the electron are supplied by
the absorbed photon.
2. Spontaneous or stimulated emission of a photon through a direct process, i.e., a
process involving only electrons and photons. One has:
E f + E ph = Ei,
k f + k ph = ki,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the valence band, Ei is the initial
energy of the electron in the conduction band, E ph is the energy of the emitted photon
(similarly for momenta). We can equivalently write
Ei f = Ei −E f = E ph = h f,
ki f = ki −k f = k ph = 2π
λ
kph,
implying that the changes in energy and momentum of the electron are supplied to
the emitted photon.
Direct processes typically involve a photon energy of the order of the energy gap Eg,
which photons in the NIR and visible ranges are able to provide, see (2.1). However, the
amount of momentum a photon can supply is indeed very small if the wavelength is in
the micrometer range. To clarify this point, remember that electron momenta are deﬁned
in the reciprocal space, whose fundamental cell is the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (FBZ). We can
assume as a large electron momentum one corresponding to the distance between the
center of the FBZ (the  point, where the maximum of the valence band is found) and
the periphery of the FBZ (close to the minimum of the conduction band in indirect-gap
semiconductors). Such a distance, see Fig. 1.9, is of the order of
ke,max ≈π
a ,
where a is the lattice constant, of the order of 0.5 nm. Since the photon wavelength is of
the order of 1 μm we conclude that

or kph ≪ke,max. Thus, the momentum difference between the initial and ﬁnal states
caused, in a direct transition, by the photon momentum, is altogether negligible.
Direct transitions are possible in direct-bandgap semiconductors, where electron and
hole states are available near the point  with negligible momentum difference; see
Fig. 2.8(a).
In indirect bandgap semiconductors, such as Si, radiative transitions involve a large
momentum variation, which is indeed of the order of π/a, see Fig. 2.8(b). Such a
momentum cannot be provided by photons, and the transition is possible only by involv-
ing other particles, the phonons, having low energy but comparatively large momentum.
Phonons are quantized elastic waves carrying mechanical energy (in the form of sound
or heat) through the crystal.
In the presence of one or more phonons, the possible interaction mechanisms mul-
tiply, since a photon can be emitted or absorbed through the help of an emitted or
absorbed phonon. Let us denote as Eφ = hF the phonon energy (F is the phonon fre-
quency), as kφ = 2π/ the phonon momentum ( is the phonon wavelength). We have
four possible cases:
1. Absorption of a photon through an indirect process, i.e., a process involving electrons
and photons but also phonons. The phonon can be absorbed or emitted.
a. Phonon absorption:
E f = Ei + E ph + Eφ,
k f = ki + k ph + kφ,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the conduction band, Ei is the
initial energy of the electron in the valence band, E ph is the energy of the absorbed
photon and Eφ is the energy of the absorbed phonon (similarly for momenta).

64
Semiconductor optical properties
b. Phonon emission:
E f + Eφ = Ei + E ph,
k f + kφ = ki + k ph,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the conduction band, Eφ is the
energy of the emitted phonon, Ei is the initial energy of the electron in the valence
band, E ph is the energy of the absorbed photon (similarly for momenta).
2. Emission of a photon through an indirect process, i.e., a process involving electrons
and photons but also phonons. The phonon can be absorbed or emitted.
a. Phonon absorption:
E f + E ph = Ei + Eφ,
k f + k ph = ki + kφ,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the conduction band, E ph is the
energy of the emitted photon, Ei is the initial energy of the electron in the valence
band, and Eφ is the energy of the absorbed phonon (similarly for momenta).
b. Phonon emission:
E f + E ph + Eφ = Ei,
k f + k ph + kφ = ki,
where E f is the ﬁnal energy of the electron in the conduction band, E ph is the
energy of the emitted photon, Eφ is the energy of the emitted phonon, Ei is the
initial energy of the electron in the valence band (similarly for momenta).
Since indirect interactions are many-body processes, their probability of occurrence
is smaller than for direct processes. In particular, the emission efﬁciency of an indirect-
bandgap semiconductor is low enough to make (at least at present) the realization of
devices based on stimulated emission, like lasers, extremely critical (indirect-bandgap
light-emitting diodes, LEDs, working with spontaneous emission, are feasible but have
low efﬁciencies). On the other hand, devices based on the absorption process, like pho-
todetectors, can still be realized through indirect-bandgap semiconductors, albeit with
inferior performance with respect to direct-bandgap materials.
Concentrating on the indirect (phonon-assisted) photon absorption process, we can
express the energy or momentum difference between the ﬁnal (conduction band)
electron state and the initial (valence band) electron state as
E f i = E ph ± Eφ ≈E ph,
ki f = k ph ± kφ ≈±kφ,
where the upper sign corresponds to phonon emission and the lower sign to phonon
absorption. Phonon absorption slightly decreases the minimum energy a photon must
have in order to be able to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction
band, i.e., it slightly decreases the absorption threshold energy with respect to Eg. On
the other hand, phonon emission slightly increases the absorption threshold energy with
respect to Eg.
If we compare a direct and an indirect transition, see Fig. 2.9, we see that the momen-
tum (the wavevector k) that the phonon should provide is typically of the order of π/a,
since, as already mentioned, indirect conduction band minima are located at or near the
boundary of the FBZ (while the valence band maximum is always located in point ).

Schematic dispersion relation of phonons in a cubic crystal; only the section from the  to the L
point is shown. The parameter EφR is the Raman phonon energy.
The question is, of course, whether the phonon can be a high-momentum particle
while preserving a low enough energy to make it compatible with the total energy
balance of the process, which is dominated by the large photon energy.
As already recalled, phonons are mechanical waves in the crystal. Taking into account
that vibrational waves can be longitudinal (i.e., the matter displacement occurs parallel
to the propagation direction) or transverse (the displacement occurs orthogonal to the
propagation direction) and that two vibrational modes are possible according to whether
nearby atoms oscillate in or out of phase (these are referred to as the acoustical [low
energy] phonons and the optical [high energy] phonons), we have, in a cubic crystal,
four possible vibrational modes, the longitudinal/transverse, optical/acoustic phonons
(denoted as LA, TA, LO, TO, see Fig. 2.10). Since the crystal space supporting lat-
tice vibrations is the same periodic space in which the electron motion takes place, the
phonon dispersion relation is deﬁned in the same reciprocal space as for the electrons,
i.e., the FBZ, see Fig. 2.10. The maximum value for the phonon momentum within the

66
Semiconductor optical properties
FBZ is therefore of the order of π/a. However, the phonon energy is small: while optical
phonons have a maximum energy (called the Raman phonon energy, EφR) of the order
of 60 meV in Si and 35 meV in GaAs, the maximum energies for the acoustic phonons
are Eφ,TA(L) ≈20 meV in Si and ≈10 meV in GaAs, Eφ,LA(L) ≈50 meV in Si and
≈30 meV in GaAs; notice that the acoustical phonon energy vanishes at the  point. A
phonon with k = π/a will have propagation constant and wavelength
kφ = 2π
 = π
a → = 2a.
However, the dispersion relation of acoustic phonons can be approximated, at low
momentum, as
F = vs
 ,
where vs ≪c0 is the velocity of sound in the medium. The maximum phonon energy
will be
Eφ = hF = hvs
 ≈hvs
2a .
Taking into account that the energy of a photon with wavelength λ is E ph = h f =
hc0/λ, and that vs is of the order of 104 m/s in a solid while c0 = 3 × 108 m/s, we have,
assuming 2a ≈1 nm, λ ≈1 μm, that
Eφ

30.
For a photon energy of 1 eV this means a phonon energy near 33 meV. Note that the total
phonon momentum and energy need not be necessarily carried by just a single phonon,
but also by two or more phonons. It is clear, however, that a low number of phonons
together can have at the same time a large momentum and a low enough energy with
respect to the photon energy.
Example 2.2: Consider an indirect-bandgap semiconductor with Eg ≈1 eV; suppose
that a photon is absorbed and that an acoustic phonon (emitted or absorbed) provides
the momentum difference. Assuming for the phonon energy Eφ = 30 meV, evaluate the
absorption shift in energy and wavelength.
We have that the minimum photon energy is E ph = 1000 ± 30 meV where the upper
sign is for phonon emission, the lower sign for phonon absorption. Taking into account
that λ = 1240/E μm, where the energy is in meV, we have that, in terms of wave-
length, the absorption edge for absorption is λ1 = 1240/1030 = 1.2038 μm for phonon
emission, and λ2 = 1240/970 = 1.2783 μm for phonon absorption. The total shift is
λ2 −λ1 = 74.5 nm.
Assuming a monotonic behavior of the dispersion relation of the valence and conduc-
tion bands (e.g., the parabolic band approximation in a direct-bandgap semiconductor),

energy and momentum conservation lead to the following conclusion: having assigned
the photon energy, the initial and ﬁnal electron states (i.e., their energy and momentum)
are uniquely determined. To show this, we use a simple parabolic model for the valence
and conduction bands and assume vertical transitions (same momentum in the initial
and ﬁnal states, or negligible photon momentum). To ﬁx the ideas, assume that the ini-
tial state is in the valence band, the ﬁnal state in the conduction band (as in the case of
absorption), see Fig. 2.11. The initial and ﬁnal energies satisfy the dispersion relations
for the valence and conduction bands, with ki = k f = k:

The minimum photon energy occurs when k = 0 and is equal to the energy gap:

Ei = Ev,
E f = Ec.
Therefore, Eg can be referred to as the absorption edge.
2.3.2
Perturbation theory and selection rules
According to quantum theory, the state of a system subject to time-independent forces
is described by the solution of the Schrödinger equation with given Hamiltonian H0
(related to total energy, e.g., of electrons and holes):
H0ψ(r, t) + j¯h ∂ψ(r, t)
∂t
= 0,
where ψ(r, t) is the particle wavefunction and the Hamiltonian is related to the total
particle energy as
H0 = −¯h2
2m ∇2 + V (r).
(2.3)
The ﬁrst term in (2.3) is the quantum version of the kinetic energy, the second term the
potential energy. A time-dependent (small) external force (here associated with an EM
ﬁeld, i.e., to a photon) can be described as perturbation of the Hamiltonian:
H0 →H0 + H′.
The perturbed solution can be expressed (according to perturbation theory) as linear
combination of unperturbed states; if the perturbing force is time-varying (in our case,
harmonic) the probability of ﬁnding a particle belonging to the system (which was in
the initial state i) in the ﬁnal state f increases linearly with time. The per unit time (and
sometimes per unit volume) transition probability from the initial to the ﬁnal state is the
scattering rate w f i, see Fig. 2.12. If the time duration of the interaction and size of the
interaction region are suitably large, quantum theory also suggests that the scattering
rate is zero if energy and momentum are not conserved.
Given a certain amount of cause (e.g., optical power, photons, . . . ) the strength of
the effect (e.g., the number of electrons promoted per unit time from the valence to
the conduction band through photon absorption) depends on the magnitude of the

scattering rate w f i. Perturbation theory shows that the scattering rate is proportional
to the magnitude square of the so-called matrix element M f i:
M f i =

r
ψ∗
f (r) · H′(r, ∇r) · ψi(r) dr,
(2.4)
where ψ f (r) and ψi(r) are the ﬁnal and initial state wavefunctions, respectively,
H′(r, ∇r) is the perturbation Hamiltonian, and ∇r is the gradient operator (operating
on ψi). For an EM wave, the perturbation Hamiltonian is
H′ ∝A · ∇r ∝∂
∂ξ ,
where A is the EM wave vector potential (in a plane wave, A is parallel to the electric
ﬁeld and orthogonal to the propagation direction, see e.g. [10]) and ξ is the coor-
dinate along the direction of the vector potential. In other words, the perturbation
Hamiltonian operates on the initial state wavefunction as a directional derivative oper-
ator, with direction parallel to the EM ﬁeld polarization. From the Bloch theorem (see
Section 1.3.2), wavefunctions in a crystal are the product of a periodic function of space
and of an atom-like wavefunction; near the  point of the FBZ, such wavefunctions
can be approximated by their even or odd atom-like component (s-type or p-type for
the conduction and valence band, respectively, see Fig. 1.11). Since a spatial deriva-
tive operator turns an even function of space into an odd function and vice versa, the
integral kernel can, in some cases, be an odd function of space, leading to an identi-
cally zero matrix element in (2.4). For brevity, we will conﬁne the discussion to some
representative examples.
Consider, for example, an initial s-type state and a ﬁnal px-state, which is odd along
x, even along y and z. The two states can be synthetically described (assume functions
are real for simplicity) as
s(x, y, z) = e(x)e(y)e(z),
px(x, y, z) = o(x)e(y)e(z),
where e is a (generic) even function, o an odd function of the argument. Assume, for
instance, that the perturbation Hamiltonian is ∝∂/∂x. The application of H′ on the

70
Semiconductor optical properties
initial state leads to an odd function of x; multiplying by the ﬁnal px state we globally
obtain an even function of x (and also of y, z):
M f i ∝

∂x

e(x)e(y)e(z)

dx dy dz =
 
o(x)e(y)e(z)
2 dx dy dz.
In this case the kernel is even, and M f i ̸= 0.
On the other hand, consider an initial s-type state and a ﬁnal py-state, which is odd
along y, even along x and z; assume again that the perturbation Hamiltonian is ∝∂/∂x.
The application of H′ to the initial state leads to an odd function of x; multiplying by
the ﬁnal py state, which is even along x, we have
M f i ∝

= 0 × 0 × K = 0.
Thus, the integral kernel is an odd function of x, an odd function of y, and an even
function of z. In this case, therefore, the integral is zero and M f i = 0. Generalizing
the above result, it can be shown that, given an electric ﬁeld directed along ξ, the only
interaction possible is between pξ states and s states; for all other p states the matrix
element is zero.
We can conclude that, while optical transitions must satisfy energy and momen-
tum conservation, some transitions that are possible from this standpoint have in
fact zero strength, i.e., zero matrix element. Selection rules state that the initial and
ﬁnal state pair must have an “even”–“odd” or “odd”–“even” nature to allow for a
transition.
In bulk semiconductors, the matrix element depends on sets of states (initial or ﬁnal)
of the s and p type. It can be shown that, for any ﬁeld polarization, there is always
some interacting set of initial and ﬁnal states (see Section 2.3.3); the matrix element
is never zero and turns out to be polarization independent. This also occurs because
light and heavy holes are degenerate and therefore contribute in a similar way to the
transition.
The situation changes in quantum wells, since in this case the p-type or s-type wave-
functions are multiplied by the envelope wavefunction ψ(z) (see (1.15) and suppose
conﬁnement takes place along z; if the QW is an epitaxial structure, z is orthogonal to
the stratiﬁcation), which can in turn be even or odd (typically even in the fundamen-
tal state, then alternately odd and even; in an asymmetric well the envelope functions
will be only approximately even or odd). The presence of the envelope wavefunction
alters the parity of the initial or ﬁnal state wavefunctions, but only along the direc-
tion parallel to the QW stratiﬁcation. Moreover, in a QW the degeneracy of light
holes (LH) and heavy holes (HH) is removed and the different composition of the

two wavefunctions, see (1.2) and (1.3), becomes effective in making the interaction
polarization-dependent.
To introduce a speciﬁc example, let us recall some more vocabulary on radiative
transitions. We talk about intraband transitions when the initial and ﬁnal states are in the
same band (e.g., conduction band or valence band); and of interband transitions if they
are in different bands (e.g., initial conduction band, ﬁnal valence band). In a quantum
well we also have subbands, thus we have intrasubband transitions when the initial
and ﬁnal states are in the same subband, and intersubband transitions when they are
in different subbands (e.g., initial and ﬁnal in two different subbands of the conduction
band, or one in a subband of the conduction band, the other in a subband of valence
band); for some examples see Fig. 2.13. Note that intraband or intrasubband transitions
are never direct, while intersubband transitions typically are, both if the two subbands
belong to the same band (conduction or valence) and if they belong to two different
bands (conduction and valence).
To discuss selection rules in a quantum well, consider a symmetrical QW where
the envelope wavefunctions ψi(z) are even or odd according to the index (the fun-
damental state i = 1 is even in z, the second state is odd, and so on). The enve-
lope wavefunctions are slowly varying in z with respect to the conduction and
valence subband s- and p-like wavefunctions (periodic in the crystal lattice). To
obtain the total subband wavefunctions near the  point, valence (HH and LH)
and conduction band wavefunctions are multiplied by ψi(z), leading to the total
wavefunctions:
φi,c(x, y, z) = ψc
i (z)s(x, y, z),
i = 1, 2 . . .
φi,vξ(x, y, z) = ψv
i (z)pξ(x, y, z),
i = 1, 2 . . . ,
ξ = x, y, z.
The matrix element of the transition between a valence band p state and a conduction
band s state can therefore be expressed as

can in principle be different from zero even if the two envelope wavefunctions do not
have the same index, because they refer to two different potential proﬁles (valence and
conduction band wells); however, if the two wells are similar, or approximated, for
example, by an inﬁnite well, I ≈δi j, i.e., M f i is not negligible only if the two indices
are equal.
We can conclude that the element matrix is zero unless two conditions are met:
• The indices of the envelope wavefunctions in the valence and conduction bands are
both even or odd (1-1, 2-2, but also in general 1-3, etc.); however, while the 1-1, 2-2,
etc. interaction is strong, the 1-3, etc. interaction is typically very weak.
• The interaction caused by an electric ﬁeld polarized in the direction ξ involves the
valence band state pξ.
In general, if the ﬁrst condition is met, the interaction will have a different weight
according to the ﬁeld polarization. This happens because, while the LH states include
all possible pξ wavefunctions, in the HH states one of these (pz) does not appear, see
(1.3) and (1.2). For HH states, therefore, the matrix element for a z-polarized ﬁeld is
zero, while LH states react (albeit with a different strength) to all polarizations. Since in
a QW LH and HH states are not degenerate (and therefore the relevant interactions have

a different minimum photon energy), a global polarization sensitivity of the allowed
transitions results.
In summary, the allowed transitions between subbands in different bands are of the
kind 1-1, 2-2, 3-1, etc. (i.e., the subband indices must be both even or odd), but strong
transitions are typically with equal indices; the forbidden transitions are 1-2, 2-1, 1-4,
etc. (i.e., the subband indices must be one even and the other odd); this is apparently the
opposite of bulk rule (even–even, odd–odd rule), but is in fact the same rule, account-
ing for the envelope wavefunctions (see Fig. 2.14). On the other hand, intersubband
transitions within the same band (conduction or valence) obey the even–odd rule as in
bulk, thus 1-2 is allowed, 1-3 is forbidden, and so on. Allowed intersubband transitions
(1-2, etc.) will, however, have low strength (at least in a symmetric well) due to the
orthogonality of the envelope wavefunctions belonging to the initial and ﬁnal states.
As an example of the polarization sensitivity arising in a QW from the removal of
the degeneracy between HH and LH bands, consider a QW with wells orthogonal to
the z axis. The TE polarization (electric ﬁeld orthogonal to z) will cause both LH-C
and HH-C transitions, while the TM polarization (electric ﬁeld along z) will only cause
LH-C transitions (C stands for conduction band). The relative transition strengths (also
referred to as oscillator strengths) can be shown to be (see e.g. [11], Section 9.5):
• for TE polarization, 3/4 for HH-C, 1/4 for LH-C,
• for TM polarization, 0 for HH-C, 1 for the LH-C.
Consider for instance the QW in Fig. 2.14; suppose that the fundamental (lowest
photon energy) transition is between the HH1 band and the conduction band; HH-C
transitions correspond to an absorption process. Assuming that the photon energy is
larger than the HH-C transition threshold but lower than the LH-C transition threshold,
only a TE ﬁeld will interact (through the HH-C transition), while the TM ﬁeld interac-
tion strength will be zero. As a consequence, the TE ﬁeld (parallel to the stratiﬁcation)
will be absorbed by the QW, while the TM ﬁeld (orthogonal to the stratiﬁcation) will
be unaffected. A qualitative example of the resulting absorption and refractive index
proﬁles is shown in Chapter 6, Fig. 6.34 (right).

Total scattering rates
Quantum mechanics enables as to evaluate the scattering rates (i.e., the probability of the
transition, or the number of transitions per unit time, between an initial and a ﬁnal state,
see Fig. 2.12) for the three fundamental processes—spontaneous emission, stimulated
emission, and absorption. The scattering rates can be shown to assume the following
forms:4
wsp
em = wδ(E f −Ei + ¯hω)
wst
em = wn phδ(E f −Ei + ¯hω)
wabs = wn phδ(E f −Ei −¯hω),
where w (dimension J m3 s−1) is proportional to the matrix element M f i describing
the interaction strength, and is the same for all processes; for the expression in a bulk
semiconductor, see (2.6). The δ function is a placeholder for energy conservation (it
states that in a direct process the electron energy variation is equal to the photon energy),
while n ph is the average photon number, related to the photon density ρph as
ρph = n ph
V ,
where V is the crystal volume considered. The photon density is in turn related to the
EM wave power as

4 See [4], Section 4.3 and in particular (4.51), (4.54) and (4.55). The absorption scattering rate can be derived
through the Fermi golden rule via a semiclassical approach; the stimulated emission follows from time
reversal, but in order to derive spontaneous emission the thermodynamic equilibrium condition must be
enforced. A direct evaluation of the scattering rates requires, on the other hand, the so-called second quan-
tization process. The square magnitudes of the integrals appearing in (4.51), (4.52) of the quoted reference

The scattering rates deﬁned so far yield the transition probabilities between two exist-
ing states which are properly populated (the initial state is full, the ﬁnal state is empty,
according to the exclusion principle). Therefore, they do not take into account:
• The availability (i.e., the density) of initial and ﬁnal states having the proper energy;
it can be shown that this corresponds to a weight called the joint density of states
(JDS) of the valence and conduction bands, Ncv(¯hω):8

of energy conservation. A variable change into energy introduces as the Jacobian the JDS.

Thus, to obtain the total absorption scattering rate Wabs we multiply wabs by the joint
density of states Ncv, and by the probability that the initial state (valence band) is ﬁlled
by an electron (empty of a hole: 1 −fh) AND the ﬁnal state (conduction band) is empty
of an electron (probability 1 −fn); this, because of the exclusion principle.
Similarly, to obtain the total emission scattering rate Wem = Wsp

The macroscopic view: the EM wave standpoint
The photon–semiconductor interaction is described, macroscopically, by parameters
characterizing the behavior of an EM wave traveling through the semiconductor. These
are the complex dielectric constant ϵ(h f ) = ϵ′ −jϵ′′ and, equivalently, the complex
propagation constant γ = ω√ϵμ0 = ¯α + jβ. The absorption coefﬁcient can, in the
presence of stimulated emission, become negative, corresponding to gain g and to
net gain g = g −α. In modeling the interaction between the EM wave and the semi-
conductor, this can be deﬁned as the EM wave standpoint. From the semiconductor
standpoint, on the other hand, the interaction with the EM wave can be characterized by
the radiative recombination rate Ro, the radiative generation rate Go or the net radiative
recombination rate Uo = Ro −Go.
We will now relate the microscopic behavior (scattering rates) to the macroscopic
parameters of the EM wave (absorption, gain, net gain). Let us assume that the electric
ﬁeld in the medium propagates as a (monochromatic) plane wave

Pop = Pop(0) exp(−2¯α) ≡Pop(0) exp(−αz),
where we have denoted by ¯α the ﬁeld attenuation, while α = 2¯α is the absorption coef-
ﬁcient. Describe the EM wave as a set of traveling photons (photon gas); the photon
density ρph must satisfy, in steady state, the continuity equation:

The ﬁrst term in the r.h.s. (including the stimulated emission and absorption rates) is
proportional to ρph, while the second term is an incoherent source, associated with
spontaneous emission. While the ﬁrst term will lead to gain or loss of radiation, the
second term does not contribute to increasing or decreasing the power of an EM wave

propagating in the medium, but rather generates photons propagating in random direc-
tions. For this reason, we do not consider the second term when evaluating the material
absorption or gain.
In the presence of absorption or gain, the photon density increases or decreases
exponentially in the propagation direction:
ρph(x) = ρph(0) exp(−αx) exp(gx),
where α is the absorption, g is the gain due to stimulated emission. Substituting in (2.26)
we readily identify
α = nr

wNcv(1 −fn)(1 −fh)
(2.27)
g = nr

wNcv fn fh.
(2.28)
Finally, the net gain g = g −α can be expressed as
g = nr
c0
wNcv fn fh −nr
c0
wNcv(1 −fn)(1 −fh) = nr
c0
wNcv( fn + fh −1).
To understand when the net gain is positive and when, in contrast, absorption prevails
leading to negative net gain, we have to consider the occupation probabilities fn and fh.
In “ordinary” conditions, the occupation probability of the conduction and valence
band states is described by the Boltzmann tail of the Fermi–Dirac statistics, i.e., both
occupations are ≈0. In such conditions, the net gain is negative and absorption prevails.
On the other hand, the occupation probability increases in the presence of large injec-
tion of electrons and holes, until all valence and conduction band states are full, so that
fn and fh may be close to 1 (at least, in a certain carrier energy range). Now, radiative
recombination is fostered and stimulated emission prevails, leading to positive gain.
Due to the effect of stimulated emission and gain, a semiconductor can amplify the
light traveling through it, as in optical ampliﬁers and lasers.
The condition for positive net gain can be expressed in terms of the electron and hole
quasi-Fermi levels as follows. Taking into account that
g = nr

Semiconductor optical properties
Since the minimum allowed electron–hole energy difference is En −Eh = Eg, the
positive gain condition (called the population inversion condition: notice that this
condition has nothing to do with the inversion condition in a MOS system) is
EFn −EFh > Eg.
In inversion conditions np ≫n2
i ; this only happens in a forward biased pn junction
or heterojunction. Conversely, in a depleted region np ≪n2
i and therefore absorption
prevails.
2.4.1
The semiconductor gain energy proﬁle
The qualitative behavior of g(E ph), taking as a parameter the concentration of the
injected carrier populations (for simplicity assume quasi-neutrality, n ≈p), can be
obtained as follows. We start from (2.29) and approximate the Fermi distribution at
0 K as a step function. For E ph < Eg, the joint density of states is zero and g = 0. If
the population inversion condition is not met (n < ninv), on the other hand, fn(E ph) ≈
fh(E ph) ≈0 for all photon energies, and
g(E ph) ≈−nr
c0
wNcv(E ph) = α(E ph)
∀E ph.
Let us assume now that, for a given carrier injection corresponding to population inver-
sion (n > ninv), fn(E ph) ≈fh(E ph) ≈1 for E ph < E0 (where E0 = EFh + EFn +
Eg), while fn(E ph) ≈fh(E ph) ≈0 for E ph > E0; then
g(E ph) ≈nr
c0
wNcv(E ph),
E ph < E0
g(E ph) ≈−nr
c0
wNcv(E ph) = α(E ph),
E ph > E0.
Thus, the gain is positive and proportional to the joint density of states up to E0, while
the absorption is proportional to the joint density of states for E > E0. For increas-
ing population injection, E0 increases, leading to the qualitative behavior shown in
Fig. 2.15 for a bulk material (above) and a quantum well (below), with staircase density
of states (for simplicity, exciton resonances, see Section 2.4.3, were not considered). In
the energy range considered we have also assumed that w is weakly dependent on the
photon energy.
For temperatures above 0 K the gain proﬁle vs. the photon energy can be evaluated
numerically. As already stated, the inversion population condition is implemented in a
direct-bias pn junction or double heterojunction where quasi-neutrality holds (p ≈n).
From n = p and the photon energy ¯hω, we derive the initial and ﬁnal electron energy
and the electron and hole quasi-Fermi levels. More explicitly, in (2.29) we express the
Fermi distributions (2.12) and (2.13) by setting En −EFn = (En −Ec) −(EFn −Ec),
EFh −Eh = (EFh −Ev) −(Eh −Ev). The terms EFn −Ec and EFh −Ev can be
approximated as a function of the population density n ≈p through the Joyce–Dixon
formulae (1.12) and (1.13), while En −Ec and Eh −Ev are derived from the photon

As an example, the resulting gain proﬁle g(¯hω, n = p) of an AlGaAs/GaAs double
heterostructure is shown in Fig. 2.16. The net gain is zero for photon energies below
Eg because of the zero joint density of states; it increases for photon energies above
Eg and then decreases again as a function of ¯hω, since at high energy fewer and fewer
states are available. A larger n = p corresponds to larger gain, for small n = p the gain
is negative, i.e., absorption prevails.
Gain in QW structures follows a similar behavior but, as already remarked, the shape
of gain vs. the photon energy is different due to the presence of the staircase density of
states. A qualitative picture at 300 K is shown in Fig. 2.17.
The gain proﬁle g = nrc−1

energy En and Eh selectively recombine to emit (through stimulated emission) pho-
tons with energy ¯hω = En −Eh. In high injection conditions (corresponding to high
photon concentration and emitted optical power) the carrier lifetime is in the picosec-
ond range and the restoring mechanisms of the quasi-Fermi distribution (typically,
phonon scattering), whose characteristic time constants are around 1 ps, are unable to

the stimulated carrier lifetime and therefore the dynamic of lasers; see Section 2.5.1.

The semiconductor absorption energy proﬁle
In a depleted region (e.g., a pn junction in reverse bias) fn ≈fh ≈0 and absorption
prevails; by expanding w from (2.10), one has from (2.29) for direct-bandgap bulk
semiconductors (we assume bulk material, unpolarized light):

to the energy E p ≈20 eV, see (2.8). For GaAs, E p ≈22.71 eV, for InP E p ≈17 eV,
see [12] for example. The overall behavior of the absorption coefﬁcient is dominated by
the JDOS,9 since the 1/¯hω term becomes signiﬁcant for energies at which the effective
mass approximation breaks down. Making explicit JDOS in (2.31), one has

bandgap semiconductors, the absorption proﬁle increases sharply for h f > Eg, due to
the 	
¯hω −Eg term, see Fig. 2.18. Such a behavior dominates the absorption proﬁle
close to the absorption edge in compound semiconductors like GaAs, InP, CdTe, and
GaN, see Fig. 2.20.
In indirect-bandgap semiconductors, the photon absorption requires the emission or
absorption of one or more phonons. This weakens the interaction strength (due to the
multibody interaction), and changes the absorption threshold. Denoting by Eφ the aver-
age phonon energy (meV at ambient temperature), the total absorption is α = αe + αa,

9 A subtle point concerns what kind of hole effective mass has to be exploited in the deﬁnition of the reduced
mass: mlh, mhh or some average. A possibility is to separately consider the HH and LH contributions, see
e.g. [13], Section 4.2. Alternatively, an average hole mass can be assumed, which is often taken as mhh
(for k ̸= 0 the HH-C transition dominates).
10 This value results from a reduced GaAs mass m∗r = 0.065m0.

Second-order perturbation theory yields (see e.g. [4], Section 4.5)
αe ∝(¯hω −Eg −Eφ)2,
¯hω > Eg + Eφ
αa ∝(¯hω −Eg + Eφ)2,
¯hω > Eg −Eφ.
Since Eφ increases with T , the absorption cutoff is also temperature dependent.
The overall behavior of the absorption coefﬁcient vs. the photon energy is shown
in Fig. 2.19; the phonon contribution shifts the absorption edge to lower energies.
The theoretical behavior is conﬁrmed by experimental data (for Si see, e.g., [14]);
above threshold, the absorption coefﬁcient has a temperature sensitivity of the order
of 0.2 cm−1/K. In direct-bandgap semiconductors, on the other hand, the absorption
edge depends only on temperature through the temperature variation of the energy gap
(Eg increases with decreasing T , leading to a blue shift in the absorption edge).
The indirect bandgap behavior can be affected by the presence of secondary direct
minima, as in Ge, where the main minimum is indirect, but a direct ( point) min-
imum exists, see Fig. 1.12(c), so that for h f < 0.66 eV, absorption is negligible; for
0.66 < h f < 0.9 eV, the material behaves as an indirect-bandgap material, absorption
is low and increases slowly vs. the photon energy; for h f > 0.9 eV, ﬁnally, the dominant
process is direct, and absorption increases sharply. Such a composite behavior is shown
in Fig. 2.20.
2.4.3
The QW absorption proﬁle
In a QW, conduction and valence subbands exist. Conduction band subbands can be
labeled, according to increasing minimum energy, as C1, C2, etc. Valence band sub-
bands include both heavy and light hole subbands, which generally are nondegenerate.
In an unstrained QW, typically the ﬁrst valence band sublevel is HH1, the second is
LH1 and then HH2, LH2, etc. follow. The resulting absorption proﬁle inherits the stair-
case behavior of the QW JDOS, but only the steps relative to allowed transitions having

ordering of subbands is not represented exactly. The staircase proﬁle of the absorption
is shown in Fig. 2.22; the absorption edge is shifted with respect to the bulk material
value. However, the measured absorption proﬁle of a QW differs from the ideal stair-
case proﬁle because sharp transitions are enhanced and overlap with a new effect, the
exciton resonance peaks. Such peaks can also be detected in bulk materials, but only at
low temperature, while in QW they appear at ambient temperature and can be strongly
modulated by an applied electric ﬁeld.11
11 Excitons also change the theoretical absorption proﬁle near the absorption edge, leading to absorp-
tion enhancement for E ph > Eg. For a more detailed treatment on excitons, see, for example, [11],
Section 13.3 and references therein.

Qualitative picture of exciton levels in the semiconductor density of states.
Excitons can be introduced in a simpliﬁed way as follows. The electron and hole
charges are −q and q, respectively. An electron and a hole therefore experience
Coulomb attraction in real space, leading to a weak form of bond similar, in princi-
ple, to the (strong) bond existing between the hydrogen nucleus and the hydrogen atom
electron. While in the hydrogen atom the binding energy is large (more than 10 eV), the
weak (typically less than 10 meV in bulk semiconductors) electron–hole bond is broken
at ambient temperature, where the average energy of particles is of the order of 40 meV.
A weakly bound e-h pair is called an exciton. Excitons can be shown to introduce a
set of closely packed discrete levels in the forbidden band of the semiconductor, see
Fig. 2.23, plus an additional continuum set of states that merge with the conduction
band state density.
The position of the exciton levels can be explained from the fact that a small amount
of energy breaks the exciton, bringing the bound electron into the conduction band.
The exciton level can therefore be understood as an energy level immediately below the
conduction band, in much the same way as a shallow donor level is located immedi-
ately below the conduction band edge. In such conditions, an ionization energy of the
order of 10 meV is enough to promote an electron trapped in the shallow level into the

so that at room temperature Ex ≈kBT and the fraction of nonionized excitons is

Excitons can interact with photons having energies immediately below the absorp-
tion edge Eg, thus creating strong absorption peaks and an increase of the absorption
proﬁle for E ph ≈Eg. Such peaks appear close to the absorption edge energy in bulk
semiconductors or close to each staircase step in the QW response, and merge with the
step due to the effect of ﬁnite linewidth.
In a bulk material like GaAs, exciton peaks disappear at ambient temperature and are
only visible at low T , see Fig. 2.24 [15]. In a quantum well, however, the binding energy
of excitons is substantially larger; in fact, it can be shown that, in this case, the binding
energy of the fundamental exciton state is

where Eg,eff is the effective gap (i.e., the distance between the fundamental level in the

out to be four times larger than in the bulk semiconductor, thus in GaAs, for example,
making the exciton effect signiﬁcant at room temperature also. In fact, in the QW the
exciton resonant peaks also do not disappear at T = 300 K [16] [17]; see Fig. 2.25 for
the proﬁle at ambient and low temperature. Exciton peaks are particularly important
in the design of QW electroabsorption modulators, since they are strongly modulated
in energy and amplitude by the application of an electric ﬁeld. Due to the different
oscillator strengths relative to the HH and LH interactions with conduction band states,
the QW absorption proﬁle is also polarization dependent; a qualitative behavior for TE
and TM polarizations is shown in Fig. 6.34.

2.4.4
Spontaneous emission spectrum
The spontaneous emission spectrum describes the spectral distribution of the EM energy
radiated by the semiconductor (at or outside equilibrium) due to photon spontaneous
emission. It can be derived by summing the spontaneous emission scattering rate over
all possible photon states satisfying energy conservation. To this end, we select as a vol-
ume a cube with side L and apply to the photons the so-called pseudo-quantization, i.e.,
we require that the photon wavenumber satisfy the resonance condition along x, y, z:
k ph = l 2π
L x + m 2π
L y + n 2π
L z,
where l, m, n are integers; the space allocated to each state is (2π)3/2L3 = 4π3/V ,
where the factor 2 accounts for the presence of two polarization states (TE and TM).
Summing over all photon wavevectors, and taking into account that Wsp
em(k ph) =
Wsp
em(kph), and that kph = ω/c, we express the total spontaneous emission rate per unit
volume, Rsp

see Fig. 2.26. In high-injection conditions the spectrum broadens; see Example 2.5.
For further details on the spontaneous emission linewidth in low- and high-injection
(nondegenerate and degenerate) conditions, see Section 5.2.5.
Example 2.5: Evaluate the spontaneous emission spectrum in GaAs, for different carrier
densities, assuming quasi-neutrality. Assume τ0 ≈0.5 ns.
We exploit for rsp

erate and nondegenerate semiconductor, and we evaluate the joint density of states from
(2.11). For GaAs, assume m∗

the Joyce–Dixon approximation (1.12) and (1.13). The resulting behavior is shown in
Fig. 2.27; for each density the spectrum is normalized with respect to the maximum.
Notice that for low carrier density the spectral width is of the order of 1.8kBT but
increases in high injection.

interested in the amount of spontaneous emission falling in the laser cavity photon states, rather than in the
whole spontaneous emission spectrum.

Equation (2.38) relates the spontaneous emission spectrum (with reference to a speciﬁc

(as in laser diodes, where population inversion occurs) that the separation of the quasi-
Fermi levels is larger than the gap (EFn −EFh > Eg), while ¯hω ≈Eg, the exponential
turns out to have a negative argument, possibly large in absolute value, due to the small
value of kBT ; we therefore have nsp > 1 but typically nsp ≈2 −3.

to satisfy the equilibrium condition, the number of photons absorbed by the material and
the number of photons generated by spontaneous emission must be (energy by energy)
related.
2.5
The macroscopic view: the semiconductor standpoint
From the EM wave standpoint, absorption and stimulated emission cause wave attenua-
tion or ampliﬁcation, respectively, while spontaneous emission can be interpreted as an
incoherent photon source term not leading to the ampliﬁcation of an incident EM wave.
From the semiconductor standpoint, absorption and emission (stimulated and sponta-
neous) correspond to generation and recombination, respectively, of e-h pairs. Deriving
the semiconductor optical or radiative generation and recombination rates (i.e., the
number of electrons and holes generated or recombined per unit time and volume)
corresponding to the interaction with a monochromatic EM wave with speciﬁc prop-
agation constant k is indeed straightforward, since each photon absorption event
corresponds to the generation of an e-h pair, and each photon emission corresponds
to the recombination of an e-h pair. It follows that:
• The generation rate Go equals the absorption rate (per unit volume) Wabs.
• The recombination rate Ro equals the emission rate (per unit volume) Wem.
• The net recombination rate Uo equals the rate difference Wem −Wabs.

the spontaneous recombination rate (per unit volume) for a speciﬁc k-state, Go is the
generation rate.
For Rst
o (¯hω) and Go(¯hω), we can assume that photons are single-energy or narrow-
band (as in a laser, where photons may belong to a speciﬁc k-state, or in a photodetector
illuminated by a single-frequency optical beam); if the material is illuminated by an
optical signal with assigned spectral content, the generation (or stimulated recombi-
nation) rates can be integrated over the photon energy proﬁle, i.e., over the spectral
distribution of Pop. Spontaneous generation, on the other hand, is intrinsically broad-
band, as discussed in Section 2.4.4. The total associated spontaneous recombination rate
should, therefore, account for the (broad) spontaneous emission spectrum, which also
includes the photon density of states (2.32).
To further clarify this point, we note that recombination rates can refer to a single
speciﬁc photon k-states, or to all photons having a certain energy, or to all possible pho-
ton states, integrated over the energy spectrum. In discussing stimulated recombination,
we typically refer to a speciﬁc photon state, as in a laser cavity, and denote the relevant
recombination rate as Rst
o . Concerning spontaneous recombination, we must distinguish
several relevant cases according to the following notation:
• Rsp
o is the total spontaneous recombination rate per unit volume, integrated over all
possible photon states and energies; it coincides with the total spontaneous emission
rate per unit volume. Rsp
o is obtained by integrating, over all photon energies, rsp
o .
• rsp
o is the spontaneous recombination rate per unit volume accounting for all photon
states of given energy; it coincides with the spontaneous emission spectrum (2.34).
• rsp
o ≡Wsp
em is the spontaneous recombination rate for a speciﬁc photon state; it
coincides with the scattering rate for spontaneous emission.

2.5 The macroscopic view: the semiconductor standpoint
95
• rsp
o V −1 ≡Rsp
o is the spontaneous recombination rate per unit volume for a speciﬁc
photon state.16
To express rsp
o
we directly exploit (2.34) and we assume, for the moment, that the
semiconductor is nondegenerate, e.g., is in low injection conditions. Taking into account
(1.9), (1.10), (1.11) and expressing Ee −Eh in terms of the photon energy ¯hω we have,
in the Boltzmann approximation:
fn(Ee, EFn) fh(Eh, EFh) = e

(2.44)
The energy behavior of the low-injection spontaneous recombination spectrum coin-
cides with the spontaneous emission spectrum and is therefore shown in Fig. 2.26. The
total spontaneous recombination rate Rsp
o deﬁned above can be recovered by integrat-
ing over all photon energies; note that, in the nondegenerate case, the total rate will be
proportional to pn, i.e., it follows the elementary law Rsp
o,ND ∝pn.
2.5.1
Carrier radiative lifetimes
In the lifetime approximation the recombination rates are expressed as
Rn = n
τn
,
Rh = p
τh
,
where Rn = Rh for band-to-band processes. In general, however, lifetimes will depend
on the carrier population and a constant lifetime can be only deﬁned in small-signal
conditions and (often) in low-injection conditions.17 However, many optoelectronic
devices (e.g., semiconductor sources) operate in high injection, quasi-neutrality con-
ditions (n ≈p); in this case, the lifetime concept can be still applied, but τ will depend
on the carrier concentration.
In fact, in nondegenerate conditions we have
Rn = rn pn ≈rnn2 = n
τn
16 The symbol Rsp
o
will be exploited in the analysis of lasers; we will approximate Rsp
o ≈βk Rsp
o , where
βk ≪1 is the spontaneous emission factor, see (5.60) and (5.61).
17 Low injection occurs in a semiconductor when the excess minority carrier concentration is much larger
than the equilibrium concentration, while the majority carrier concentration is practically at the equilibrium
condition, e.g., in an n-type material n ≈ND, p ≈p′, p′ excess hole concentration.

96
Semiconductor optical properties
where rn is a proper recombination coefﬁcient and quasi-neutrality has been assumed;
in this case,
τn =
1
rnn ,
i.e., the lifetime depends inversely on the carrier concentration.
Let us now discuss the lifetime associated with recombination due to spontaneous
and stimulated emission of photons.
We start by considering the emission of photons having a speciﬁc energy and
wavenumber, and extend the treatment to the case of spontaneous emission, where
a broad emission spectrum is involved. The discussion is done in two steps: nonde-
generate semiconductors (i.e., the Fermi levels are within the forbidden gap, and the
Boltzmann statistics hold); and degenerate semiconductors (the Fermi levels are within
the conduction and valence bands, the injection level is high, and the Fermi statistics
must be used).
Using the Boltzmann approximation for densities and substituting for the JDS and for
n and p, the following expression is obtained for the net radiative recombination rate of
a nondegenerate semiconductor, in the presence of a photon wave with assigned energy
and momentum (single-photon state), see (2.43):

In thermodynamic equilibrium, Uo,ND vanishes if two conditions are met: the photon
number follows the Bose–Einstein statistics (2.24), and the carrier equilibrium condition

photons are near equilibrium (i.e., the net recombination rate is zero only when equilibrium holds for
photons and carriers).
19 The notation for the recombination rates was also formally extended to lifetimes.

As already recalled, the spontaneous lifetime deﬁned here (τ sp

frequency and propagation vector photons; to obtain the total recombination rate Rsp
o
(and the total spontaneous lifetime τ sp
n ) we integrate the recombination (emission) spec-
trum (2.34) over all photon energies. In the nondegenerate case rsp

Apparently, from (2.48) we have that τ sp
n,ND →0 for n →∞. The paradox of zero life-
time for extremely large carrier densities can be removed by accounting for degeneracy.
In the degenerate case, we can obtain an approximate expression of the lifetime asymp-
totic value by assuming the quasi-Fermi distributions at 0 K, and quasi-neutrality; we
obtain (see Example 2.7) for the recombination rate Rsp

(2.49)
since the second term in square brackets in (2.49) is typically ≪1.21 With this
approximation, the spontaneous radiative lifetime under degenerate conditions tends
to the constant value τ sp
n,D = τ0. The spontaneous radiative lifetime τ0 can therefore be
assumed as the limiting value of the lifetime due to spontaneous emission for very large
population densities.

Semiconductor optical properties
For stimulated lifetime, a similar result is obtained. In fact, from (2.43) one has
Rst
o = gPop
¯hω
but the (maximum) gain is approximately proportional to the carrier density as g ≈an,
where a is the differential gain, so that the stimulated lifetime becomes
1
τ st
n
= aPop
¯hω ,
(2.57)
i.e., for large carrier injection, the stimulated lifetime is constant with respect to the
charge density but decreases with increasing optical power. This implies that τ st
n can
be typically decreased below the value of spontaneous lifetime, with consequences for
the relative speed of devices operating on stimulated emission (lasers) rather than on
spontaneous emission (LEDs).
For increasing optical power, however, gain compression has to be taken into account.
Since the optical power is proportional to the photon density ρph, see (2.5), as Pop =
¯hω(c0/nr)ρph, we can from (2.30) approximate the gain for large carrier densities as
g ≈

is of the order of 1 ps, corresponding to a cutoff frequency 1/(2πτ st

160 GHz. This purely indicative value at least suggests that the dynamics related with
stimulated emission is much faster than that associated with spontaneous emission.
Example 2.8: Evaluate the GaAs spontaneous lifetime as a function of the population
density, assuming quasi-neutrality.
We can evaluate Rsp
o from (2.50) and then compute the lifetime as τn (¯hω) = n/Rsp
o .
The integral in (2.50) has to be performed through numerical quadrature. To relate the
population density to the quasi-Fermi levels we can exploit the Joyce–Dixon formu-
lae which are, however, slightly inaccurate for very high densities; a more accurate
approach is the Nilsson approximation [20]. For GaAs, we assume m∗

High-speed semiconductor devices
and circuits
3.1
Electronic circuits in optical communication systems
As well as optoelectronic devices such as optical sources, modulators (electrooptic
or electroabsorption), optical ampliﬁers and detectors, high-speed optical communi-
cation systems also include dedicated electronic circuits and subsystems. Although
most of these are in the low-speed digital sections of the system, and can therefore
be implemented with conventional Si-based technologies, some strategic components
and subsystems operate at the maximum system speed, e.g., at 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps,
often with rather demanding requirements in terms of noise or output voltage (current
driving) capabilities. Since high-speed digital data streams are ultimately transmitted
and received in baseband, high-speed (high-frequency) subsystems must also possess
ultrawide bandwidth. Relevant examples are the driver ampliﬁers of lasers or modula-
tors (in direct or indirect modulation systems, respectively), and the detector front-end
ampliﬁers.
The enabling technologies in high-speed circuits for optoelectronic systems are the
same as found in RF, microwave and millimeter-wave analog integrated circuits. In
these domains, silicon-based (CMOS or bipolar) electronics with conventional inte-
grated circuit (IC) approaches are replaced, at increasing frequency, by ICs based
on SiGe or III-V compound semiconductors (GaAs or InP). Such circuits exploit, as
active devices, advanced bipolar transistors (heterojunction bipolar transistors, HBTs)
or heterostructure-based ﬁeld-effect transistors (such as the high electron mobility
transistors, HEMTs).
Besides active devices, high-speed circuits also include passive (distributed or con-
centrated) elements. Examples of distributed components amenable to monolithic
integration are planar transmission lines such as the microstrip and the coplanar lines
on semiconductor substrates. The transmission line theory also enables one to read-
ily introduce, as a typical high-frequency modeling and characterization tool for linear
multiports, the scattering parameters.
3.2
Transmission lines
Transmission lines (TXLs) are a convenient model for 1D wave propagation;
besides their direct importance as high-speed circuit components, the analysis of

3.2 Transmission lines
105
TXLs is also useful because they are also a basic building block in electro-
optic distributed components, such as traveling wave photodiodes or distributed
modulators.
Two parallel ideal conductors (one is the active or signal conductor, the other the
return or ground conductor) surrounded by a homogeneous, lossless medium, see
Fig. 3.1(a), support a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) propagation mode in which
both the electric and the magnetic ﬁelds lie in the line cross section and are orthogo-
nal to the line axis and wave propagation direction. In such a TEM TXL, the electric
ﬁeld can be rigorously derived from a potential function that satisﬁes the Laplace equa-
tion in the line cross section. The transverse electric potential is uniquely determined
by the conductor potentials, or, assuming the ground conductor as the reference, by the
signal line potential v(z, t), where z is parallel to the line axis and propagation direc-
tion. Under the same conditions, the transverse magnetic ﬁeld is related to the total
current i(z, t) ﬂowing in the signal conductor. From the Maxwell equations, v and i
can be shown to satisfy the partial differential equation system (called the telegraphers’
equations):

where L is the per-unit-length (p.u.l.) line inductance and C is the p.u.l. line capacitance.
The telegraphers’ equations are compatible with the voltage and current Kirchhoff equa-
tions applied to the lumped equivalent circuit of a line cell of inﬁnitesimal length, see
Fig. 3.1(b). The p.u.l. parameters have a straightforward meaning – they correspond to
the total series inductance of the unit-length cell and to the total capacitance between
the two conductors in the unit-length cell.
The circuit model can be extended to account for losses by introducing a series
p.u.l. resistance R (associated with ohmic losses in the conductors) and a parallel p.u.l.
conductance G (associated with the dielectric losses in the surrounding medium), see
Fig. 3.1(c). In fact, series losses cause small longitudinal ﬁeld components, thus mak-
ing the ﬁeld distributions slightly different from the ideal TEM pattern; however, the
TXL model can be heuristically extended to cases in which the propagating mode is
not exactly TEM due to the presence of metal losses, or because the cross section is
inhomogeneous (i.e., it includes materials with different dielectric permittivities). In the
latter case, we say that the structure supports a quasi-TEM mode. Quasi-TEM propa-
gation can be approximately modeled as a TXL with frequency-dependent propagation
parameters. In both the TEM and quasi-TEM cases the operating bandwidth is wide,
ranging from DC to an upper frequency limit associated with the onset of high-order
modes or sometimes to limitations related to line losses, and the frequency dispersion
of the propagation parameters (due to modal dispersion in the quasi-TEM case but also
to ohmic losses) is low, at least in the high-frequency range.

Undistorted propagation is typical of lossless TXLs, where the signal phase velocity
is frequency independent. For lossy lines the telegraphers’ equations can be modiﬁed,
by inspection of the related equivalent circuit, as

In this case, propagation is no longer undistorted and the simple solution outlined so far
is not generally valid. The lossy case can be conveniently addressed in the frequency
domain, i.e., for time-harmonic v and i. We assume now that the time-domain solution

where α is the line attenuation,2 γ = α + jβ is the complex propagation constant,
Z0 is the (now possibly complex) characteristic impedance, and V ± is a constant to
be determined from initial and boundary conditions. In general, an arbitrary solution
v(z, t) (i(z, t)) can be associated with a phasor V (z, ω) (I (z, ω)), resulting from the
superposition of forward and backward propagating waves V ±(z, ω) (I ±(z, ω)).
For time-harmonic signals, system (3.6), (3.7) becomes

(3.10)
d
dz I (z, ω) = −(jωC + G)V (z, ω).
(3.11)
Substituting V ± and I ± from (3.8) and (3.9) we obtain, for the complex propagation
constant γ and the complex characteristic impedance Z0:

V ±(z, ω)
I ±(z, ω) = ±

jωC + G ≡±Z0.
(3.13)
The dispersive behavior of the line is thus apparent already when the p.u.l. parameters
are frequency independent; in fact, R, L, and G are themselves frequency dependent
because of the presence of metal and dielectric losses. Equations (3.12) and (3.13)
can be written in a more compact and general form by introducing the series p.u.l.
impedance Z = R + jωL and p.u.l. admittance Y = G + jωC of the line as

In a lossless or lossy line, power is transmitted by forward and backward waves in
the positive and negative z direction, respectively. The net power transmitted in the
positive z direction is in fact (assume for simplicity that the characteristic impedance is

i.e., the net power can be decomposed into a forward and backward (or incident and
reﬂected) power. Forward power is absorbed in the positive z direction with an absorp-
tion equal to 2α, while backward power is absorbed in the negative z direction with the
same characteristic length (the line absorption length) Lα = (2α)−1.
3.2.1
RG, RC, and high-frequency regimes
The line parameters have been assumed so far to be frequency independent. In fact, the
presence of lossy metals and dielectrics implies that L, R, and G depend on the operat-
ing frequency. Due to the ﬁnite metal conductivity, electric and magnetic ﬁelds penetrate
the line conductors down to an average thickness called the skin penetration depth δ:
δ =

2
μσω =

1
πμσ f ,
(3.15)
where μ ≈μ0 = 4π × 10−7 H/m is the metal magnetic permeability (we assume
conductors to be nonmagnetic). If δ is much smaller than the conductor thickness, the
current ﬂow is limited to a thin surface layer having sheet impedance3
Zs(ω) = Rs + jXs = 1 + j
σδ

2σ .
(3.16)
Thus, the high-frequency p.u.l. resistance follows the law
R( f ) ≈R( f0)

f
f0
,
while the high-frequency p.u.l. inductance can be split into two contributions: the
external inductance Lex (related to the magnetic energy stored in the dielectric
surrounding the line), and the frequency-dependent internal inductance Lin (related to
the magnetic energy stored within the conductors). Since the corresponding reactance
Xin( f ) behaves as Xin( f ) ≈Xin( f0)√f/f0, one has
L( f ) = Lex + Lin( f ) ≈Lex + Lin( f0)

f0

f →∞Lex.
At high frequency, therefore, the total inductance can be approximated by the external
contribution. For different reasons, the p.u.l. conductance will also be frequency
dependent; in fact, this is associated with the complex permittivity of the surrounding
dielectrics ϵ = ϵ′ −jϵ′′ = ϵ′ 

Y = jωϵ A
h = jωϵ′ A
h + ωϵ′′ A
h = jωC + ωC tan ¯δ = jωC + G(ω),
where the conductance scales linearly with frequency, i.e., G(ω) = (ω/ω0)G(ω0).
(We assume that the loss angle is weakly dependent on frequency.) The result can be
generalized to a transmission line with transversally homogeneous (or inhomogeneous)
lossy dielectrics, where in general
G( f ) ≈f
f0
G( f0),
i.e., the line conductance increases linearly with frequency. Materials characterized
by heavy conductor losses (such as doped semiconductors), on the other hand, have
frequency-independent conductivity.
In a lossy line, the propagation parameters γ and Z0 are real at DC and very low
frequency:
α + jβ ≈

Z0 ≈


since in this case the line works as a resistive distributed attenuator. In an intermediate
frequency range jωC + G ≈jωC, while jωL + R ≈R in most lines because typically
series losses prevail over parallel losses. The line performances are therefore dominated
by the p.u.l. resistance and capacitance (RC regime), with parameters

In the RC regime the line is strongly dispersive and the characteristic impedance is com-

where Z0l is the impedance of the lossless line, αc ∝√f and αd ∝f are the conduc-
tor and dielectric attenuation, respectively (usually αc ≫αd in the RF and microwave
range), and βl is the propagation constant of the lossless line. Therefore, in the high-
frequency regime a wideband signal with little or no low-frequency content propagates
undistorted, apart from the signal attenuation. The onset of the high-frequency regime
depends on line parameters; integrated structures with micrometer-scale dimensions can
operate in the RC range for frequencies as high as a few gigahertz. Moreover, the impact
of losses is related to the length of the TXL; in short structures (like those arising in
some distributed optoelectronic devices) signal distortion can be modest even though
the line operates under very broadband excitation.

The reﬂection coefﬁcient and the loaded line
The voltage and current phasors in a TXL are, in general, a superposition of forward
and backward waves:
V (z) = V +(z) + V −(z) = V +

of the line at section z, (z):
(z) ≡V −(z)
V +(z) = V −
0
V +
0
exp (2γ z) = 0 exp (2γ z) ,
(3.21)
where 0 = (0). In terms of the reﬂection coefﬁcient (3.19), (3.20) become
V (z) = V +(z) [1 + (z)] = V +
0 e−γ z 

(3.23)
At a section z the V/I ratio, which can be interpreted as the line input impedance
Z(z), can be now expressed as
Z(z) = V (z)
I (z) = Z0
1 + (z)
1 −(z) = Z0
1 + 0e2γ z
1 −0e2γ z ;
(3.24)
conversely,  can be uniquely derived from the normalized impedance ζ(z) = Z(z)/
Z0 as
(z) = Z(z) −Z0
Z(z) + Z0
= ζ(z) −1
ζ(z) + 1.
(3.25)
Using the reﬂection coefﬁcient, we can readily decompose power into an incident and
reﬂected component as
P(z) = P+(z) −P−(z) = P+(z)

1 −|(z)|2
.
Consider now a line closed on a load ZL at z = zL (Fig. 3.2) and assume we want
to evaluate the input impedance in section z, z < zL. The load imposes the boundary
condition V (zL)/I (zL) ≡Z(zL) = ZL, which becomes
(zL) ≡L = ZL −Z0
ZL + Z0
= ζL −1
ζL + 1,
(3.26)
with ζL = ZL/Z0. From (3.21) we have
0 = Le−2γ zL →(z) = Le2γ (z−zL).

Input impedance of a loaded transmission line.
The input impedance at section z (such as zL −z = l, l = line length) can therefore be
expressed as
Zi = Z(z) = Z0
1 + (z)
1 −(z) = Z0
1 + Le−2γl
1 −Le−2γl .
Expanding the load reﬂection coefﬁcient and expressing the exponential in terms of
hyperbolic functions we obtain
Zi = Z0
ZL cosh(γl) + Z0 sinh(γl)
ZL sinh(γl) + Z0 cosh(γl).
Notice that for l →∞, Zi →Z0 independent of the load. For a lossless line, however,
the input impedance is periodic vs. the line length, with periodicity λg/2 (due to the tan
function)
Zi = Z0
ZL + jZ0 tan(βl)
Z0 + jZL tan(βl).
In particular, if the load is a short (ZL = 0) or an open (YL = 0) we have
Zi(ZL = 0) = jZ0 tan(βl)
Zi(YL = 0) = −jZ0 cot(βl) ;
a reactive load is therefore obtained, alternatively inductive and capacitive according to
the value of the line electrical angle φ = βl = 2πl/λg. Finally, it can readily be shown
by inspection than the input impedance of a shorted lossy line for l →0 is Zi ≈jωLl +
Rl, while the input impedance of a short line in open circuit is Zi ≈(jωCl + Gl)−1.
Equations (3.24) and (3.25) establish a biunivocal correspondence between (normal-
ized) impedances and reﬂection coefﬁcients. Impedances with positive real part map
into the unit circle of the  plane || = 1; in fact, denoting ζ = r + jx, for reactive
impedances (ζ = jx) one has
(z) = jx −1
jx + 1 →|| = 1.
On the other hand, real impedances map onto the real  axis,  = 0 corresponding to
Z = Z0 (impedance matching condition), while Z = 0 corresponds to  = −1 (short
circuit) and Y = 0 corresponds to  = 1 (open circuit). The image of the r = const. and
x = const. lines within the  plane unit circle is a set of circles and circular segments,
often referred to as the Smith chart; see Fig. 3.3.

3.2.3
Planar integrated quasi-TEM transmission lines
The practical implementation of hybrid or monolithic integrated circuits on a dielec-
tric or semiconductor substrate typically requires that the TXL have an inhomogeneous
cross section (partly air, partly dielectric) rather than a uniform dielectric as in coaxial
cables and striplines; see Fig. 3.4. Due to the nonuniform cross section of the line, the
propagation mode is quasi-TEM rather than TEM. This implies that the phase velocity
is weakly dependent on frequency, at least for frequencies well below the onset of the
ﬁrst higher-order propagation mode. In quasi-TEM lines an effective permittivity ϵeff
can be introduced, such as
λg =
λ0
√ϵeff
= λ0
neff
,
v f =
c0
√ϵeff
= c0
neff
,
where neff = √ϵeff is the effective refractive index and c0 the velocity of light in vacuo.
The quasi-TEM line propagation parameters can be expressed in a more convenient
way by introducing the in-air (or in-vacuo) p.u.l. capacitance and inductance, La and
Ca, deﬁned as the parameters of a (TEM) line with homogeneous cross section and
ϵ = ϵ0. For such a line we have
v f =
1
√LaCa
= c0 →La =
1
c2
0Ca
,
(3.27)
since the phase velocity of a TEM mode equals the velocity of light in the dielec-
tric medium. However, assuming that the line cross section does not include magnetic
media, the p.u.l. line inductance does not depend on the dielectric properties of the line
cross section, i.e., L ≡La. In a lossless or low-loss (high-frequency approximation)
line we can therefore write

The effective permittivity therefore is a proper “average” value of the cross section per-
mittivity. Moreover, (3.27) suggests that a high-inductance line is a low-capacitance
line and vice versa, while from (3.28) a high-capacitance line has low impedance and
vice versa. Low- and high-impedance lines can be immediately recognized from their
high- and low-capacitance characteristics, e.g., a microstrip with a wide signal conduc-
tor (W/h ≫1) has high C and Ca, low Z0, while a narrow microstrip (W/h ≪1) has
low C and Ca, high Z0.
3.2.4
Microstrip lines
In the most common planar transmission line, the microstrip, see Fig. 3.4(c), the sig-
nal conductor lies on a dielectric substrate backed by a ground plane. Propagation
is quasi-TEM due to the inhomogeneous cross section (partly air, partly dielectric).
Microstrip lines on composite semiconductor substrates can be exploited in distributed
optoelectronic components, such as traveling-wave photodiodes or electroabsorption
modulators; in such cases, the analysis becomes complex due to the inhomoge-
neous, lossy substrate. Also in the simplest case of a low-loss dielectric substrate, no
closed-form expressions exist for the characteristic parameters (impedance, effective
permittivity and losses); however, several approximations are available in the literature;
see, e.g., [21], [22].
An example of the behavior of the characteristic impedance and effective refrac-
tive index vs. the normalized strip width W/h is shown in Fig. 3.5. As anti-
cipated, the impedance decreases with increasing W/h; in hybrid circuit substrates (e.g.,
ceramic, such as alumina, ϵr ≈10) or semiconductor substrates (ϵr ≈13), Z0 ranges
from 120 to 25 . Typical semiconductor substrate thicknesses are between 500 and 100
μm; the minimum strip width is limited by the resolution of lithographic processes and
(above all) by the increase of ohmic losses to ≈30 μm, while for W/h ≫1 spurious
(lateral) resonances arise, thus limiting the maximum width. The frequency dispersion
of the effective permittivity can be approximated by ﬁtting formulae, such as

where ψ ∝h f √ϵr −1. Equation (3.30) yields increasing effective permittivity with
increasing frequency, with asymptotic value ϵeff →ϵr for f →∞. Since the onset of
the ﬁrst higher-order mode occurs for frequencies such as ψ ≈1, a small substrate
thickness h is required for high-frequency operation.
An example of conductor and dielectric attenuation behavior vs. the line aspect ratio
is shown in Fig. 3.6; the conductor attenuation αc is higher for narrow strips, while
it decreases for wider strips. The dielectric attenuation increases for increasing strip
width, since in this case an increasing fraction of the electric ﬁeld energy is in the
substrate.
3.2.5
Coplanar lines
While in microstrip lines the impedance depends on the substrate thickness, thus requir-
ing careful technological control of this parameter, in coplanar waveguides (CPWs) on
a thick substrate the line impedance only depends on the strip width W = 2a and on the
lateral ground plane spacing W + 2G = 2b, where G is the gap width, and can therefore
be accurately controlled by lithographic processes. Moreover, under such conditions
the high-frequency effective permittivity is independent of the line impedance. Accord-
ing to a rather conservative estimate, such favorable properties occur if the substrate
thickness h is of the order of the ground plane spacing 2b.
CPWs are at present quite popular in millimeter-wave monolithic integrated
circuits; moreover, they are exploited as a building block in a number of distributed

where the parameter Rs = √ωμ/2σ is the skin-effect surface resistance (σ is the met-
allization conductivity, μ is the metal magnetic permeability). The impedance range of
a CPW on ceramic or semiconductor substrates is similar to the microstrip case; see
Fig. 3.7. However, both very narrow and very wide lines exhibit high conductor losses.
In fact, for a →0 the line resistance diverges, and so does the conductor attenuation;
for a →b the line impedance Z0 →0, and therefore αc ≈R/2Z0 →∞. Conductor
losses obviously depend on the CPW size, which is reduced down to a = 5 μm in
some electrooptic components (e.g., lithium niobate modulators). In such cases, the
line thickness can be increased to reduce ohmic losses; however, in the high-frequency
(high-speed) regime the line resistance depends on the conductor periphery rather than
on the conductor area, due to the skin effect, thus making conductor thickening less
effective than in low-speed operation.
3.3
The scattering parameters
Consider a linear, nonautonomous (i.e., without independent sources) two-port
network in the frequency domain. The port voltage V = (V1, V2)T and current

118
High-speed semiconductor devices and circuits
I = (I1, I2)T phasors are related as
V = ZI,
(3.34)
where Z is a 2 × 2 complex matrix called the impedance matrix. Similarly, we can
deﬁne Y = Z−1 as the two-port admittance matrix. In the same way as we charac-
terize a one-port through its reﬂection coefﬁcient rather than its impedance, we can
describe a two-port (or, in general, an N-port) through the scattering matrix. In fact,
consider that any voltage and current can be uniquely decomposed (also in a lumped-
parameter circuit) into a forward and backward component, which are conveniently
normalized as
Vi =
	
R0iai +
	
R0ibi,
Ii =
ai
√R0i
−
bi
√R0i
.
The parameters (dimension W1/2) ai and bi are the forward and backward power waves,
while R0i is the normalization resistance (or impedance) of port i. The two relations can
be inverted to provide the power waves from the total voltages and currents as
ai =
1
2√R0i
Vi +
√R0i
2
Ii,
bi =
1
2√R0i
Vi −

Ii.
If the voltages and currents are replaced in (3.34) by the power waves, on deﬁning
a = (a1, a2) and b = (b1, b2) we derive the representation:
b = Sa,
(3.35)
where S is the scattering matrix of the two-port. Although the normalization impedances
can be different for each port, typically they are chosen all equal (R0i = R0), often
with the default value R0 = 50 . In this case, the scattering matrix is related to the
impedance matrix as
S = (Z−R0I)(Z+R0I)−1,
(3.36)
where I is the identity matrix. For a one-port, (3.36) clearly reduces to (3.25), i.e.,
S ≡.
To appreciate the advantages of the scattering matrix representation, we can conve-
niently expand (3.35) in scalar form as
b1 = S11a1 + S12a2
b2 = S21a1 + S22a2;
thus, the scattering matrix elements are, by deﬁnition,

Loading conditions for measuring (a) S11 and S21 and (b) S12 and S22.
The condition ai = 0 can be achieved by properly loading port i; see Fig. 3.8. In fact,
loading port i with a resistance R0i implies Vi = −R0i Ii (the current positively enters
the port), i.e.,
ai =

Thus, S11 is the reﬂection coefﬁcient seen at port 1 when port 2 is closed on the
normalization resistance, S21 is the transmission coefﬁcient between ports 1 and 2
under the same conditions, and similarly for S22 and S12. From a practical standpoint,
measuring the scattering matrix elements is easier and more convenient than measur-
ing the impedance or admittance matrix elements. Indeed, the scattering matrix and
power wave description also applies for structures in which voltages and currents do
not, strictly speaking, exist (such as a non-TEM metal or dielectric waveguide, as an
optical ﬁber). Moreover, ideal wideband matched loads can be far more easily imple-
mented than short or open circuits (required for the Y or Z parameter characterization,
respectively). Finally, most high-speed transistors happen to be unstable when closed
on reactive terminations, thus making the direct measurement of Z or Y parameters
virtually impossible.

where |ai|2 is the incident power into port i, and |bi|2 the reﬂected power from port i.
If a two-port is lossless, the total power entering the two-port is zero, i.e., P1 + P2 = 0;
this implies
P1 + P2 = a · aT ∗−b · bT ∗= a ·

· aT ∗= 0,
where I is the identity matrix. Setting ST ∗= S† we obtain
S†S = I,
i.e., the scattering matrix is Hermitian. Finally, the scattering matrix of a reciprocal
two-port (N-port) is symmetric, Si j = Sji.

120
High-speed semiconductor devices and circuits
Assume now that a two-port is connected to a generator with internal impedance Zg
at port 1 and to a load with impedance ZL at port 2.5 From circuit theory one immedi-
ately obtains that, if the generator and load are directly connected, the maximum power
transfer from the generator to the load occurs when ZL = Z∗
g (conjugate matching or
power matching conditions). In this case the power delivered to the load is the generator
available power Pav:
Pav =
Eg

,
where Eg is the phasor associated with the generator open-circuit voltage (normalized
with respect to the effective value). A dual expression holds for a generator with short-
circuit current Ag and internal admittance Yg = Gg + jBg:
Pav =
Ag
2
4Gg
.
(3.37)
If we assume now that the generator and load are connected through the two-port
(which could be the model of a linear ampliﬁer), maximum power transfer occurs when
port 1 and port 2 are conjugately matched:
Zin = Z∗
g,
ZL = Z∗
out,
(3.38)
where Zin and Zout are the input and output impedance of the two-port when loaded
at port 1 with Zg and at port 2 with ZL, respectively. Conditions (3.38) can be also
expressed in terms of reﬂection coefﬁcients as
g = ∗
in(S, L),
L = ∗
out(S, g),
(3.39)
where S is the two-port scattering matrix. The load and generator reﬂection coefﬁcients
that simultaneously meet (3.39) yield maximum power transfer between the generator
and the load. However, conjugate matching is not always possible, but only if the two-
port is unconditionally stable (i.e. if
in,out
 < 1 for any
L,g
 < 1).6
Power matching corresponds to the maximum power transfer between a load and
a generator connected by a two-port (e.g., an ampliﬁer). This is an optimum con-
dition in narrowband systems; however, in wideband design and in the presence of
distributed components (such as transmission lines) another matching approach (often
called impedance matching) is preferred, since it allows minimization of reﬂections
and the related signal distortion. For the sake of deﬁniteness, consider a lossless trans-
mission line with real characteristic impedance Z0, and load and generator resistances
Rg and RL; the transfer function between the load voltage VL and the genera-
tor voltage Eg can be evaluated from (6.24) and (6.25) taking into account that
5 In the present chapter we use Zg to avoid confusion with the symbol G as the initial of “gate”; elsewhere
the generator impedance will be denoted by ZG.
6 In what follows, we will assume that the active components considered (in particular, the ampliﬁers) are
unconditionally stable; this is also a convenient choice in wideband design. For a discussion on stability
issues see e.g. [25].

and no multiple reﬂections take place between the generator and the load. However,
if both the generator and the load are mismatched the response shows magnitude and
phase ripples, as shown in Fig. 3.9; those lead to signal distortion and should therefore
be reduced or eliminated by properly terminating the distributed element. Note that
generator and load impedance matching with a line having real Z0 also corresponds to
the power-matching condition.
3.4
Passive concentrated components
Passive components for high-speed hybrid and monolithic integrated circuits can be
either distributed or concentrated (or lumped). Distributed components are based on
single or multiconductor (coupled) transmission lines; TXLs can be exploited to design
impedance-matching sections, ﬁlters, reactive equalizers, directional couplers, and other
low-loss components. The typical size of distributed components at centerband is a frac-
tion of the guided wavelength (e.g., λg/4); thus, such components have a comparatively

large size. Moreover, the design based on distributed components is often narrowband.7
Finally, low-loss TXL components are reactive and cannot therefore be exploited in
resistors, attenuators, or other dissipative components.
Lumped capacitors, resistors, or inductors are implemented in hybrid and integrated
circuits according to several approaches. Such components have small size with respect
to the operating wavelength and can be potentially wideband. However, losses typi-
cally limit the operating bandwidth of reactive components (capacitors and, above all,
inductors).
Many lumped components can be integrated monolithically on semiconductor sub-
strates. Integrated inductors can be realized through short, high-impedance transmission
lines or, more conveniently, as spiral inductors; see Fig. 3.10. Since no magnetic cores
are available for frequencies above a few hundred megahertz, all RF inductors are in
air, with rather low inductance values.8 The maximum inductance of planar integrated
spiral inductors is of the order of 100 nH; however, the larger the inductance, the larger
is the parasitic capacitance and therefore the smaller is the resonance frequency. Spiral
inductors can be exploited for bias T design or for low-Q ﬁlters. Integrated capacitors
usually follow the so-called MIM (metal insulator metal) approach, where a ﬁrst-level
metal is exploited as a ground plane, a suitable insulator (silicon dioxide, silicon nitride,
polymide) acts as a dielectric, and the second-level metal is the signal conductor. Finally,
integrated resistors can be obtained through high-resistivity metals or low-doping lay-
ers. Examples of integrated resistors and capacitors are shown in Fig. 3.10. Integrated
lumped elements allow one to obtain concentrated forms of components such as direc-
tional couplers, power dividers, matching sections; such lumped versions typically
have a reduced size with respect to the distributed ones, but also higher losses and a
lower-frequency operation range.
7 An important exception is given by the so-called traveling-wave design where impedance matched TXLs
are exploited. Relevant examples are distributed ampliﬁers and traveling-wave optoelectronic components
such as distributed photodiodes and modulators.
8 Some attempt has been made recently to increase the inductance through the use of magnetic conductors,
e.g., permalloy. The approach has some advantages in the RF range, but is complex from the technological
standpoint.

(b) coplanar broadband chip resistor up to 40 GHz on ﬁred alumina substrate; (c) chip capacitor;
(d) chip inductor; (e) ultrabroadband conical inductor.
Discrete lumped components can be externally inserted into hybrid integrated circuits
(i.e., circuits where the substrate is dielectric, and the active semiconductor devices are
not monolithically integrated), usually as surface-mount chip resistors, inductors, or
capacitors. Chip resistors are commonly exploited as external loads in a number of
integrated optoelectronic components; see Fig. 3.11(b) where a coplanar resistor made
of two resistors in parallel (the lateral pads are connected to the ground plane, the central
pad to the active conductor) is realized by depositing a NiCr high-resistivity alloy on a
ﬁred alumina substrate
Chip resistors are obtained by deposing a resistive thin ﬁlm over a dielectric (e.g.,
ceramic) chip. Wrap-around or ﬂip-chip contacts are then added, allowing for surface
mounting (SM) on a microstrip or coplanar circuit. An example of such structures
(shown bottom up) can be found in Fig. 3.11(a); the side size of the component is
often well below 1 mm. Chip capacitors can be obtained by depositing a dielectric layer
(e.g., SiO2) on a conductor or semiconductor (e.g., Si); the dielectric layer is then coated
with metal so as to deﬁne the external contacts, which can be surface mounted through
ﬂip-chip (i.e., by connecting the component upside down); see Fig. 3.11(c).
While chip resistors can be properly manufactured so as to achieve spectacular
bandwidths (e.g., from DC to millimeter waves), thus making it possible to provide
ultrabroadband matched terminations in traveling-wave components (such as 40 Gbps
distributed electrooptic modulators), broadband inductors are difﬁcult to obtain because
of the increase of losses with frequency and the upper limitation related to the LC res-
onant frequency. The quality factor of RF and microwave inductors typically peaks

124
High-speed semiconductor devices and circuits
in a very narrow band, with maximum values well below 102. An example of an RF
and microwave chip inductor is shown in Fig. 3.11(d); achievable inductance values
typically decrease with increasing operating frequency.
However, ultrabroadband bias Ts (see Section 3.4.1) for optoelectronic devices, and
the related electronic circuitry and instrumentation, require broadband inductors as RF
blocks. Conical inductors (Fig. 3.11(e)) are a particular technology allowing for very
broadband behavior, due to a strong reduction of the parasitic capacitance and to the
scaling invariance of the design (see, e.g., [26]).
3.4.1
Bias Ts
Most electronic or optoelectronic devices have to be properly DC biased at the input
and output. DC bias is typically imposed under the form of a DC voltage applied
through an (almost) ideal DC voltage source. The total applied voltage is therefore
v(t) = VDC + vRF(t), where the second contribution is the (zero-average) signal volt-
age. However, v(t) cannot be applied by a single generator including VDC in series with
vRF(t), because the DC and RF generator impedances should be different (e.g., 50 
for the RF, ≈0 for the DC), and the impedance of a DC source is beyond control at
RF. The easiest way to implement such a separation between the DC and RF parts is
through a 3-pole component called the bias T because of its shape; see Fig. 3.12(a). The
operation of the bias T is trivial if the capacitors and inductor values are assumed to be
very large; in this case, we can analyze the structure in two limiting cases: DC ( f →0)
and RF ( f →∞). In DC, C1 and C2 are open and L is a short; thus, the RF signal is
blocked by the open C1 while the DC bias is connected to the output through L (acting
as a DC short). C2 is open and does not interfere with the DC path. At RF, C1 and C2
are shorted while L is an open circuit, thus blocking the DC signal from reaching the
output. At the same time, the RF signal is shorted to the input, but cannot reach the DC
bias node (DC IN) because of the RF blocking inductor. C2 adds an additional RF block,
shorting the RF signal to ground; it could be omitted in an ideal design with arbitrarily
large component values. In Fig. 3.12(b) two bias Ts are exploited to bias the input and
output of a ﬁeld-effect transistor.
In practice, however, the bias T has to be realized with ﬁnite-valued components.
This leads to two operating bands, the “DC” in the interval 0 < f < f1 and the “RF”
in the interval f2 < f < ∞. The bias T design becomes difﬁcult if f1 is very close to
f2 and f2 is low, as in many wideband ampliﬁers for optical communication systems or
instrumentation; see Example 3.1.
Example 3.1: Suppose a bias T is connected to the input of a FET as in Fig. 3.12(b); for
simplicity, the FET input is considered as an open circuit, while the DC bias generator
(VG) internal impedance is negligible. Using a simple structure with C2 = 0, ﬁnd the
C1 ≡C and L values such as f1 = 100 kHz and f2 = 10 MHz. As a condition, impose
that in the “DC” range the input impedance seen from RF IN is |Zin| > 1 k (so that
the RF generator is effectively decoupled from the device input in the “DC” range),

while in the “RF” range the input impedance seen from RF IN is again |Zin| > 1 k
(implying that the path through the blocking inductor L to the DC generator is an open
circuit in the “RF” range). Repeat for (b) f1 = 100 kHz, f2 = 1 GHz and for (c) f1 =
100 kHz, f2 = 200 kHz.
Taking into account that the FET input is an open circuit, we can select the LC circuit
so that the series resonance is between f1 and f2. At low frequency, the impedance
seen between the RF input and the DC input (which is shorted to ground; remember
that the internal impedance of the DC source is assumed as negligible) will be large and
capacitive (the inductor is almost a short in this range), and at high frequency will be
large and inductive (the capacitor is almost a short in this range). This yields the two

stant ( f1 is in fact constant), the inductance becomes extremely large if the transition
between “DC” and “RF” is narrow. In such cases, more complex circuit schemes have
to be exploited to allow for reasonably valued components.
3.5
Active components
High-speed circuits exploit as active components both ﬁeld-effect (FET) and bipo-
lar junction transistors (BJT), implemented in several conventional and compound
semiconductor technologies. Si-based MOSFETs with nanometer gate length have
demonstrated microwave and even millimeter-wave operation; such devices are not
well suited to high-power (high breakdown voltage) applications, but can be conve-
niently exploited, for example, in receiver stages with some noise penalty in comparison
with compound semiconductor technologies. Compound semiconductor FETs based on
GaAs and InP substrates are currently implemented as high electron mobility transistors
(HEMTs) in lattice-matched (LMHEMT) or pseudomorphic (PHEMT) form. Although
conventional, Si-based bipolar transistors are limited to RF operation, heterojunction
bipolars (HBTs) in compound semiconductor technologies (GaAs or InP) or based on
the SiGe material system have shown good performances up to millimeter waves. HBTs
are characterized by features similar to the conventional bipolars, i.e., larger current
density and current driving capability with respect to FETs.
3.5.1
Field-effect transistors (FETs)
High-speed ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs) are based on a conducting channel whose
current (driven by the potential difference between the drain and source electrodes) is
modulated by the potential applied to the control electrode (the gate), which is iso-
lated from the channel (by a metal-oxide-semiconductor junction in MOSFETs or by a
reverse-biased Schottky junction in compound semiconductor FETs); see Fig. 3.13.
The ﬁrst high-speed ﬁeld-effect transistor able to operate at microwave frequencies
was the GaAs-based MESFET (metal-semiconductor FET), in which the channel is a
layer (implanted or epitaxial) of highly doped bulk semiconductor. A simpliﬁed cross
section of a high-breakdown-voltage MESFET is shown in Fig. 3.14; in such devices,

ky contact, thus reducing its cross section and, as a consequence, the total device current.
Recessed-gate power MESFETs exhibit drain breakdown voltages in excess of 20 V
and can still be exploited for frequencies up to 10 GHz; in high-performance appli-
cations they have generally been replaced by heterojunction-based FETs (HEMTs and
PHEMTs).
The qualitative behavior of the DC characteristics of the MESFET can be derived
by inspection of Fig. 3.15. Suppose that most of the VDS potential difference falls in
the active channel located underneath the Schottky gate; for low VDS, the potential
difference between the gate and each point in the conducting channel is almost con-
stant; as a consequence, the channel potential φch increases linearly from the grounded
source to the drain, but the depletion region is uniform along the gate, and the chan-
nel cross section is constant. In such a condition (Fig. 3.15(a)) the device behaves
as a variable resistor; the resistance depends on the applied VGS. For VGS = VTH
(the threshold voltage) the conducting layer is completely depleted and the channel
conductance is zero. Increasing VDS, the local potential difference between the gate
and the channel becomes more and more nonuniform (Fig. 3.15(b)) and, as a conse-
quence, the channel cross section narrows from the source to the gate, giving rise to a
nonlinear channel potential distribution. For large enough VDS (Fig. 3.15(c)) the elec-
tric ﬁeld at the drain edge of the gate increases so as to lead to velocity saturation of

the carriers (this happens in GaAs for electric ﬁelds ε much larger than a critical ﬁeld
εc ≈3.2 kV/cm). Beyond this point, the channel current approximately saturates, and
for larger VDS the saturation point is displaced toward the source, leading to a small
decrease in the length of the nonsaturated (ohmic) part of the channel (Fig. 3.15(d));
this causes a small increase of the drain current ID, which turns out to be more evi-
dent in short-gate devices (e.g., with gate length Lg < 0.5 μm). In materials where the
velocity saturation effect is less abrupt than in GaAs (e.g., in Si), current saturation is
due to the channel pinchoff, that is, it takes place at a voltage VDS such that the cross
section of the conducting channel vanishes at the drain edge of the gate.
In conclusion, the FET output characteristics (at the input no DC current is absorbed
since the gate is isolated) have a linear region for low VDS, a triode region where the
drain conductance begins to decrease, and ﬁnally, beyond a certain knee voltage, the
saturation region, where the drain current is approximately independent of VDS. In an
n-channel FET, decreasing VGS increases the amount of channel depletion and therefore
leads to a lower current. For very large VDS and/or large currents, breakdown occurs
in the form of a sometimes catastrophic increase of the drain current. In high-speed
Schottky gate FETs the breakdown voltage is low in the on-state (high current) and
high in the off-state (low current, device at threshold). The resulting DC characteristics
are qualitatively shown in Fig. 3.16; note that the ID corresponding to VGS = 0 is often
referred to as IDSS; since the gate is a Schottky barrier, the maximum VGS is limited
by the Schottky barrier built-in voltage; indicative values are 0.6–0.7 V for GaAs and
0.9–1 V for AlGaAs. The soft breakdown effect shown in Fig. 3.16 is a peculiarity of
HEMTs and PHEMTs, due to a substrate charge injection mechanism; it is considerably
alleviated by technology optimization.

FET DC model
A simpliﬁed analytical model for the DC current of any FET can easily be devel-
oped according to the channel pinchoff saturation mechanism; current saturation due
to carrier velocity saturation will be discussed in Section 3.5.4.

φch is the channel potential. In general, Qch(x) depends on the potential difference
between the gate and section x of the channel:
Qch(x) = Qch (VGS −φch(x)) .

For increasing VDS, (3.42) yields a current that ﬁrst increases linearly (linear region),
then begins to saturate (triode region) to ﬁnally reach a maximum IDs for VDS = VDSS,
corresponding to channel pinchoff at x = Lg, and therefore to current saturation. From
(3.42) the saturation voltage VDSS reads
VDSS = VGS −VTH;

Although saturation in compound semiconductor FETs is typically due to velocity sat-
uration, the above model can serve as a simple analytical tool to explore some of the
main features of different classes of high-speed FETs.
3.5.3
FET small-signal model and equivalent circuit
The analog operation of transistors often corresponds to small-signal conditions, i.e., a
small-amplitude signal source is superimposed on the DC bias. The small-signal device
response can be approximated by a linear, frequency-dependent model, e.g., under the
form of the admittance or scattering matrix. (FETs often operate in common source
conﬁguration, i.e., the source is signal grounded, the gate acts as the input and the
drain as the output.) It is, however, useful to associate with the small-signal behavior
a circuit model (the small-signal equivalent circuit), whose elements can be physi-
cally mapped into the FET structure as shown Fig. 3.17 (for simplicity, we refer to a
MESFET, but the approach is readily extended to other FET families). The external
parasitic resistances RS, RD, RG appear here as access resistances of the source, drain,
and gate terminals, respectively, while the intrinsic resistance RI is the resistance of
the ohmic part of the channel. The capacitances CGS and CGD derive from partitioning
the total capacitance associated with the gate depletion region, while CDS is mostly a
geometrical capacitance between drain and source. The other elements of the equivalent

differentiating the ID(VGS, VDS) relation as

DS = ∂ID

.
The transconductance gm is the device ampliﬁcation between the input driving voltage
(the voltage v∗applied between the intrinsic gate and the channel, across the deple-
tion region) and the output (drain) current. The parameter τ describes an additional
phase delay between the driving voltage v∗and the generated current gmv∗; it is often
associated with the delay that carriers experience drifting below the gate contact, thus
justifying the name transit time. A more readable form of the equivalent circuit, in which
also some external inductive parasitics have been added, is shown in Fig. 3.18.
The parameters of the equivalent circuit can be exploited to derive two ﬁgures of
merit related to the device speed or, equivalently, to the maximum operating bandwidth:
the cutoff frequency fT and the maximum oscillation frequency fmax.

Evaluating the cutoff frequency (a) and the maximum oscillation frequency (b) of a FET.
The cutoff frequency fT is the frequency at which the short-circuit current gain of
the transistor has unit magnitude. Such a parameter can be estimated from measure-
ments, either directly or from extrapolation; however, a straightforward connection to
the equivalent circuit parameters is possible if a simpliﬁed intrinsic equivalent circuit is
exploited in the analysis. By inspection of Fig. 3.19(a) one has (we assume harmonic
generators and phasor notation)
ID =
gm

i.e., imposing |ID/IG| = 1 at ωT = 2π fT ,
fT =

.
The maximum oscillation frequency is the frequency at which the maximum available
power gain (MAG, the ratio between the available power at the device output and the
generator available power) is unity. Since the MAG decreases with frequency, for f >
fmax the device becomes passive and cannot provide gain even if it is power-matched
at the input and output (i.e., if Zg = Z∗
in, ZL = Z∗
out, thus leading to maximum power
transfer). Again, fmax can be related to the parameters of a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit;
some extra elements have to be added to avoid singular values in the output available
power and in the input power. Assuming that the output is power matched, the output
available power will be (see (3.37)):
Pav,out = g2

However, if the input is power matched, the generator reactance compensates for the
CGS reactance, Rg = RG + RI and the gate current is

The available power gain Gav = Pav,out/Pav,in corresponds to the MAG, because
power matching is implemented at the input; moreover, it coincides (since the output
is also matched) with the operational power gain Gop = Pout/Pin. The condition to be
imposed to evaluate fmax is

Since RDS ≫RG + RI (typically by one order of magnitude), fmax > fT unless the
input resistance is high. Equation (3.44) also holds for bipolar transistors in common
emitter conﬁguration with the substitutions RG →RB (the base resistance), RDS →
RC E (the collector–emitter output resistance).
3.5.4
High-speed FETs: the HEMT family
High-speed ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs) today exist in a number of technologies based
both on Si and on compound semiconductors. Deep scaling down to nanometer gate
lengths of Si-based MOSFETs has made available transistors with cutoff frequencies
in the millimeter wave range; due to the comparatively high gate input resistance, the
maximum oscillation frequencies are in fact less outstanding. Heterostructure FETs are
currently manufactured on several compound semiconductor substrates: GaAs, InP and
also GaN. Devices of choice for high-speed electronic and optoelectronic applications
are the GaAs- or InP-based pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (PHEMT)
and, in the future, the GaN HEMT (mainly for high-power or high-voltage applications).
The basic building block of heterojunction FETs is the so-called modulation doped
heterojunction, consisting of a highly doped (n-type) widegap layer on top of an intrinsic
narrowgap layer; see Fig. 3.20. In a modulation doped heterostructure in equilibrium,
the doped layer (supply layer) donors are ionized, and therefore transfer their electrons
into the conduction band potential well, originated by the bandgap discontinuity. A thin
conducting channel is generated and conﬁned in the interface well, in a way that is not
dissimilar to the MOS surface inversion channel. Moreover, the electrons in the potential
well suffer little or no impurity scattering, since the narrowgap material is undoped; this
leads to an improvement in the channel electron mobility with respect to FETs (like the
MESFET) exploiting a doped channel.9 A last important advantage of the modulation
doped approach is the possibility of making the doped widegap layer (supply layer)
thin, but highly doped, thus reducing the distance between the controlling gate and
9 Huge mobility increases that led to the (historical) name of the HEMT can, however, be detected only
at cryogenic temperature, where phonon scattering becomes ineffective and the mobility is dominated by
impurity scattering; at ambient temperature, phonon scattering prevails and the mobility advantage is less
dramatic.

the channel. Since electrons in the channel are conﬁned in the vertical direction, the
modulation doping heterojunction typically is a QW for the channel electrons, which
form a charge sheet often referred to as a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG).
The (conventional) HEMT, shown in Fig 3.21, is a Schottky gate FET where a reverse
bias applied to the gate electrostatically modulates the 2DEG. The supply layer is typi-
cally AlGaAs (widegap), while the substrate is semi-insulating GaAs (narrowgap). The
AlxGa1−xAs layer has an Al fraction x between 23% and 30%; larger Al fractions
would be desirable to increase the conduction band discontinuity Ec and the channel
conﬁnement; unfortunately, for x > 30% the AlGaAs supply layer develops a trap level
(the so-called DX centers) which actually limits the effectiveness of the doping. In order
to decrease the surface impurity scattering from the donors in the supply layer, a thin
undoped AlGaAs spacer layer is epitaxially grown between the GaAs substrate and the
doped supply layer.
State-of-the art HEMTs are based on a double heterostructure, wherein a narrowgap
material is sandwiched between the widegap substrate and the widegap supply layer.
The resulting rectangular (rather than triangular) conduction band QW has superior
conﬁnement properties and may also have better transport performance than in the con-
ventional HEMT. According to whether the narrowgap layer is lattice-matched or in
a strained (tensile or compressive) condition, we have the LMHEMT (lattice-matched
HEMT) or the PHEMT (pseudomorphic HEMT).

Energy gap–lattice constant diagram for the AlGaAs, the InGaAsP and the InAlAs alloys.
Several material systems and modulation doping techniques in the supply layer
(including δ doping instead of uniform doping) can be exploited in PHEMTs. Rep-
resentative examples are:
• The GaAs-based PHEMT, where the supply layer is doped AlGaAs, the channel is
In1−xGaxAs with low indium content (see the black dot close to GaAs in the energy
gap–lattice constant diagram in Fig. 3.22), and the substrate is GaAs. Due to the
strained (pseudomorphic) channel, the conduction band discontinuity is increased,
thus improving the conﬁnement and sheet carrier density in the conducting channel.
The potential barrier between the channel and the substrate is low, however.
• The InP-based PHEMT, for which several choices exist. Taking into account that
Al0.48In0.52As and Ga0.47In0.53As are lattice matched to InP, a possible lattice-
matched structure with an Al0.48In0.52As supply layer (doped), a Ga0.47In0.53As
channel (undoped), and an InP substrate (undoped) is shown in Fig. 3.23. Imple-
menting the channel through a pseudomorphic layer of Ga0.47−xIn0.53+xAs, x small,
we increase the bandgap discontinuity toward both the supply layer and the substrate,
thus obtaining a PHEMT with improved performances.
The GaN-based HEMT has a conventional HEMT structure made of a widegap sup-
ply layer of AlGaN grown on an undoped GaN substrate. A peculiar feature of the
AlGaN/GaN system is the presence of a piezoelectrically induced electron charge in the
interface QW, even without any supply layer doping. The AlGaN-GaN HEMT therefore
has excellent properties in terms of channel charge, which can be further improved by
intentional doping.
InP-based PHEMTs are probably the devices of this class offering the best per-
formance in terms of high cutoff and maximum oscillation frequencies, with record

values well into the millimeter-wave range. GaAs-based PHEMTs offer some advan-
tages in terms of breakdown voltage (which can be pushed into the 10–20 V range) but
are conﬁned to applications below 50–60 GHz. However, the superior development of
the GaAs technology and lower cost with respect to InP make this the device of choice
for many applications, e.g., in 40 Gbps systems. An example of a GaAs-based PHEMT
structure is shown in Fig. 3.24; note the asymmetric placement of the gate, typical of
power devices and aimed at decreasing the maximum ﬁeld in the drain–gate region, i.e.,
at increasing the breakdown voltage.
A comparison between a number of competing Si-based and III-V based FET
technologies is shown in Fig. 3.25 [6], [27], [28]. Experimental data suggest that InP-
based pseudomorphic or lattice-matched HEMTs have record cutoff frequency; GaAs
PHEMTs, while slightly inferior, perform better than GaAs MESFETs. Si-based NMOS
exhibit very high cutoff frequencies for nanometer gate lengths, but the corresponding
fmax is often compromised by the large input resistance. One may note that, for decreas-
ing gate length, the Si penalty related to the lower initial mobility is somewhat mitigated
by the fact that nanometer-scale MOSFETs operate in velocity saturation conditions. In
this respect, the large threshold ﬁeld for velocity saturation in InP is a signiﬁcant advan-
tage over GaAs or Si. An alternative approach to direct growth on InP substrates, which
would considerably decrease the device cost, has been proposed under the name of
the metamorphic approach. In general, metamorphic devices are grown on substrates
mismatched with respect to the active region (GaAs or even Si; see e.g., [29]); properly
designed buffer layers have to be interposed in order to avoid defects. As a simple exam-
ple, an InP-based HEMT can be grown on a GaAs substrate topped by a graded InGaAs
epitaxial buffer leading from the GaAs to the InP lattice constant. Recently, metamor-
phic HEMTs (MHEMTs) have shown good reliability and performances comparable to
lattice-matched or pseudomorphic HEMTs.

The carrier density hosted by the interface potential well of a modulation doped struc-

the equilibrium band structure shown in Fig. 3.26. The complete analysis will be omitted
here; we only remark that increasing the Fermi level EF with respect to Ec(0) causes
an increase of the Ec slope in 0+ and therefore an increase of the QW surface electric
ﬁeld in 0+, Es. However, from the Gauss law, this is related to the total surface charge
density ns in the potential well:
Es = q

EF −Ec(0) ≈ans,
(3.46)
where a is a ﬁtting parameter of the order of 10−17 eV m2; in MKS units the parameter
has to be expressed as qa, where q is the electron charge.
The sheet carrier density ns can be modulated by acting on the external bias of a
reverse-biased Schottky junction connected to the supply layer. Denote by d the thick-
ness of the supply layer, by ds the thickness of the spacer layer (meant to screen the
channel carriers from surface donor scattering); if the Schottky barrier reverse bias is
increased the Ec(0+) slope decreases, leading to a decrease of ns; conversely, if the
Schottky negative bias is reduced, the slope increases, thus increasing the sheet carrier
density ns. The threshold voltage VTH corresponds to the (ﬂatband) condition in which
Ec(0+), and therefore the channel charge, vanishes; the increase in ns is, however, lim-
ited by the fact that, for positive Schottky contact (gate) bias, the supply layer ultimately
ceases to be depleted, thus decoupling the population ns from the gate control. Thus, ns
vanishes at threshold, then increases to saturate at a value nss; such behavior is shown
in Fig. 3.27.
In order to relate the gate bias VG to the sheet electron concentration ns, the Poisson
equation can be suitably solved in the depleted supply layer plus spacer. Taking into
account the jump condition in 0,
Ec(0−) = Ec(0+) + Ec,
and the boundary condition in −d,
Ec(−d) = qVbi −qVG + EF,

Starting from the charge control relation (3.49) and assuming, more realistically, that
the drain current saturation is due to velocity saturation rather than to channel pinchoff,
we can easily develop an approximate model for the drain current. To this end, assume
a simpliﬁed piecewise velocity–ﬁeld curve for the electrons, in which abrupt saturation
occurs for the threshold ﬁeld Eth ≈vn,sat/μn0, where μn0 is the low-ﬁeld mobility.

High-speed semiconductor devices and circuits
The drain current can be obtained by assuming that velocity saturation takes place
at the drain edge of the gate (x = Lg) for VDS = VDSSv. In the velocity saturated region
the current is
IDs = Wvn,satqns = Wvn,sat
ϵ
d + d [VGS −VDSSv −VTH],
where W is the gate periphery, since VGS −VDSSv is the potential difference between
gate and channel at x = Lg in velocity saturation conditions. Since the current must be
continuous from the ohmic to the velocity-saturated part of the channel, we should have

For short gate devices we can approximate the maximum transconductance (at VGS =

The expression for gm in (3.53) suggests a major advantage of PHEMTs over MESFETs
and other FETs: the fact that gm can be increased by reducing the supply layer thickness
d (and increasing its doping) without compromising the current (as would happen in a
MESFET due to the thinner active layer) or introducing extra impurity scattering due to
the increase in doping. The cutoff frequency can be readily interpreted in terms of the
transit time of electrons below the gate, τt.

High-speed heterojunction bipolar transistors
Conventional bipolar transistors are based on two pn junctions with a common side,
leading to the so-called pnp and npn dual structures. In the npn device (preferred for
analog applications due to the superior transport properties of electrons with respect to
holes) the np emitter–base junction is in forward bias and injects electrons into the thin
p-type base layer. A small fraction of such electrons recombine in the base, attracting
holes from the base contact to sustain e-h pair recombination and thus giving rise to a
small base current IB. Most of the electrons injected from the emitter are swept by the
electric ﬁeld in the reverse-bias base–collector junction, so as to be ultimately collected
by the collector contact as the collector current IC = −IB −IE = −αIE (we assume
all currents are positive entering). The parameter α < 1 (but close to 1) is denoted as
the common base current gain. We thus have, solving for IC:
IC =
α
1 −α IB = βIB,
β =
α
1 −α ≫1,
where β is the common emitter current gain. The common base current gain α can be
shown to be expressed as the product of two factors:
α = γ b,
where γ < 1 is the emitter efﬁciency, b < 1 is the base transport factor. The emitter
efﬁciency γ accounts for the fact that, in an npn transistor, the emitter current has two
carrier components – electrons injected from the emitter into the base and holes injected
from the base into the emitter. The latter component is useless, since it is not ﬁnally
collected by the collector, and does not contribute to current gain. The parameter γ < 1
is the ratio between the useful component of IE and the total emitter current and should
therefore be made as close as possible to unity. On the other hand, the base transport
factor b is the fraction of injected electrons that successfully travel through the base to
reach the collector. To achieve a large current gain β, α (and therefore both γ and b)
should be almost unity.
The base transport factor b can be optimized by making the base thickness (length)
as small as possible (in conventional transistors, with respect to the carrier diffusion
length in the base), or, equivalently, by making the transit time of minority carriers
in the base (electrons in an npn) much smaller than the minority carriers’ lifetime
in the base. Epitaxial growth allows reduction of the base thickness to the nanome-
ter scale (although this of course increases the base distributed resistance, unless the
emitter width is reduced through self-aligning techniques similar to those exploited in
submicrometer CMOS gate technology).
Optimization of the emitter efﬁciency γ traditionally required the emitter–base junc-
tion to be strongly asymmetrical, with NDE ≫NAB. Assume for completeness that a
bandgap difference Eg = EgE −EgB may exist between the emitter and the base; it
can be shown that

where DhE is the hole diffusivity in the emitter, DnB is the electron diffusivity in the
base, WB and WE are the base and emitter thickness, respectively, and Nvα (Ncα) are the
effective valence (conduction) band state densities in the emitter or base (α = E, B). In
a conventional, homojunction bipolar Eg = 0 and NαE = NαB, α = c, v; taking into
account that DhE ≈DnB (the hole diffusivity is in fact lower, but of the same order of
magnitude as that of the electrons) and that WB < WE (but again with similar orders of
magnitude), the only way to have γ close to unity is to set
NAB

i.e., to make the emitter doping much larger (e.g., one order of magnitude) than the base
doping. Since the base doping should be larger than the collector doping,10 we ﬁnally
have the conventional bipolar design rule NDE ≫NAB > NDC. Assuming b ≈1 and
using the Einstein relation D = (kBT/q) μ, we have from (3.54)

which will be exploited in the rest of the discussion.
As in ﬁeld-effect transistors, two ﬁgures of merit can be introduced to character-
ize the bipolar transistor speed: the cutoff frequency fT and the maximum oscillation
frequency fmax. Faster transistors can generally be obtained by scaling down the device
geometry and scaling up the doping level. Increasing the doping level is mandatory
in order to properly scale the junction depletion region sizes (roughly, dopings scale
as l−2, where l is some characteristic dimension, so that a size scaling down of 100
corresponds approximately to an increase in the doping level of a factor of 100). Con-
ventional, homojunction bipolars are, unfortunately, affected by basic limitations if the
cutoff frequency has to be pushed beyond a few gigahertz. In fact, the increase in the
doping level in the emitter (the region with the highest doping in the whole device) leads
to the so-called bandgap narrowing effect, whereby the material gap decreases slightly
for high doping according, or example, to the Lanyon–Tuft model [30], [31]:
EgE =

where ϵs is the semiconductor permittivity, NαE is the donor or acceptor emitter doping,
T is the absolute temperature, and EgE is the emitter gap decrease. For Si at ambient

10 This is typically needed for two purposes: decreasing the width of the base depletion layer in the base–
collector junction and its sensitivity to the applied VC E: this minimizes the so-called Early effect and as a
consequence the small-signal output resistance of the transistor, increasing the breakdown voltage of the
base–collector junction and therefore the transistor’s maximum output power.

with the doping in cm−3 units. At NDE ≈1 × 1019 cm−3 the bandgap narrowing is of
the order of 100 meV; since, from (3.55),
β(NDE) ≈β(0) exp

−EgE
kBT

,
where β(0) is the low-doping current gain, we immediately see that even a small
bandgap narrowing leads to a decrease in the common emitter current gain. Another
important point to consider is the fact that the low base doping required by the condi-
tion NDE ≫NAB implies a high value for the input base distributed resistance, which
in turn compromises the transistor fmax. In conclusion, homojunction bipolars have lim-
ited space for optimization for operation above a few gigahertz because this would need
to increase the base doping to reduce the input resistance, which would imply extremely
large emitter dopings, leading in turn to emitter bandgap narrowing.
A possible way out of this stalemate is obtained by a bipolar design where the
bandgap of the base is different (in particular, smaller) than the emitter bandgap. In
this case we can satisfy the condition
NAB
NDE
exp

−Eg
kBT

≪1
by exploiting a suitably large Eg, even if NAB ≈NDE. This allows a decrease in the
base resistance and, as a consequence, an increase in fmax (of course, the emitter width
also has to be scaled down to submicrometer size to reduce the base resistance). The
band diagram of a heterojunction bipolar transistor in the forward active region (i.e.,
when the emitter–base junction is in forward bias and the base–collector junction is in
reverse bias) is shown in Fig. 3.28. The increase in the emitter efﬁciency can also readily
be interpreted in terms of a potential barrier opposing the hole back-diffusion into the
emitter; in fact, the global effect of the heterojunction is related to the entire bandgap
difference Eg, which also has an inﬂuence on the relative intrinsic concentrations. In
the example shown, the base and collector are narrowgap and the base–emitter hetero-
junction is abrupt; alternative designs can be obtained through a graded base–emitter
heterojunction and by using a widegap collector.
3.5.6
HBT equivalent circuit
Bipolar transistors (both conventional and heterojunction) are junction-based devices
for which a few fundamental theoretical relations hold, at least approximately. In the
direct active region (we refer to a npn device) the emitter current follows the junction
law vs. the driving voltage VBE:

The intrinsic base has been denoted as B′, as opposed to the external (extrinsic) base
contact. Due to the input junction structure, the input capacitance of the bipolar, CBE, is
the capacitance of a forward-biased pn junction, and therefore appears in the equivalent
small-signal circuit in parallel to G B′E = R−1
B′E. Addition of other parasitic capacitances
and inductances, together with the output resistance RC E arising from the weak depen-
dence of IC on VC E (the so-called Early effect) ﬁnally leads to the equivalent circuit in
Fig. 3.29. The distributed base resistance RBB′ models the resistive path between the
transistor input and the intrinsic base (the base current ﬂows in the narrow base layer
orthogonal to the collector and emitter current densities); due to the very small base
thickness such a resistance tends to be large (therefore negatively affecting the device
fmax) unless the base is suitably doped and the emitter is very narrow. The bipolar cutoff
frequency

increases with the collector bias current, but for high values of IC saturation occurs
due to high-injection effects, which causes a drop of the transistor current gain β. In
conclusion, the cutoff frequency typically exhibits a maximum vs. IC, and decreases
for low and high IC values. Plotting IC and IB as a function of VBE in semilog scale we
obtain the result shown in Fig. 3.30: for low currents IB is mainly due to leakage effects
and the base current may be larger than the collector current. In an intermediate range

hundreds of gigahertz and maximum oscillation frequencies of the order of 1 THz.
3.5.7
HBT choices and material systems
Heterojunction bipolar transistors can be implemented in a variety of material systems.
III-V-based HBTs exploit either GaAs or InP substrates. For the GaAs-based device,
the widegap emitter is obtained through lattice-matched AlGaAs (another choice is to
exploit lattice-matched InGaP); in AlGaAs the Al content must be kept below 30% since
above this value a trap level (the DX centers) appears in the widegap material, leading

or InGaAs (pseudomorphic), while the collector, subcollector, and substrate are GaAs.
A simpliﬁed example of GaAs-based epitaxial HBT structure is shown in Fig. 3.31.
Although the GaAs-based technology is well consolidated, still better performance
can be obtained with InP-based devices, thanks to the larger bandgap difference between
the emitter and the base. Typical devices have an InAlAs emitter, a lattice-matched
or pseudomorphic InGaAs base, and an InP collector, subcollector, and substrate. An
example of epitaxial structure is reported in Table 3.1 [32].
Of particular interest are HBTs exploiting Si substrates. The SiGe alloy is a narrow-
band material, which can be epitaxially grown over a Si substrate in pseudomorphic
form. In fact, the Si1−xGex alloy exhibits a lattice mismatch with respect to Si equal
to ≈4x%, where x is the Ge fraction. An example of advanced SiGe HBT is shown
in Fig. 3.32; the only SiGe layer is the narrowgap base; the device is made with a
self-centered polysilicon emitter process and deep trench isolation between neighboring
devices. SiGe HBTs are an interesting alternative to other high-speed transistors for
low-power analog circuits and digital circuits, although the process is more complex
than for CMOS-based circuits. SiGe bipolars can reach millimeter wave operation,

but with low breakdown voltages (below 3 V; the breakdown voltage decreases
with increasing cutoff frequency, see Ch. 6, Fig. 6.61), while GaAs-based (and, to
a lesser extent, InP-based) transistors exhibit larger breakdown voltages and power
densities.
Finally, the advent of HBTs has made it possible to extend mixed bipolar-FET process
such as the BICMOS (where bipolars are SiGe HBTs) but also HBT-HEMT integra-
tion, as shown in Fig. 3.33 [33]. Depletion-mode HEMTs (D-HEMTs) are in the on
state for VGS = 0, while enhancement-mode HEMTs (E-HEMTs) are in the off state
for VGS = 0 and begin to conduct for VGS > 0. The integration of D-HEMTs and
E-HEMTs is important in applications such as fast logical circuits (e.g., multiplexers
and demultiplexers for 40 Gbps operation).
3.6
Noise in electron devices
In real circuits, all electrical signals are affected by small-amplitude random ﬂuctuations
(the noise); noisy signals can be modeled as the superposition of an ideal, noiseless

148
High-speed semiconductor devices and circuits
signal, and of a zero-average stochastic process. Since noise is a signal with nonzero root
mean square (r.m.s.) value, it is associated, at a circuit level, with power exchange. Noise
power depends on the second-order statistical properties of the signal ﬂuctuations, such
as the autocorrelation function, the power spectrum, the r.m.s. value, or the quadratic
mean. For simplicity, we will assume all devices considered to be linear or in small-
signal operation. In large-signal conditions the treatment becomes more involved, since
noise sources are modulated by the instantaneous working point.
3.6.1
Equivalent circuit of noisy N-ports
A noisy one-port can be modeled by adding to a noiseless equivalent circuit a ran-
dom voltage or current source, according to a series (Thévenin) or a parallel (Norton)
approach; see Fig. 3.34. The one-port available noise power can be obtained by integrat-
ing the available noise power spectrum pn( f ) (W/Hz) over the operating bandwidth,
and is related to the open-circuit voltage or short-circuit current power spectra Sen( f )
(V2/Hz) or Sin( f ) (A2/Hz) as follows:

where R and G are the one-port internal resistance or conductance.
The equivalent circuit of noisy two-ports, see Fig. 3.35, includes two correlated ran-
dom voltage or current sources; the noise model therefore consists of the two-port
small-signal parameters (e.g., the impedance, admittance or scattering matrix), and
of the generator’s power (real) and correlation (complex) spectra. For the series and

3.6 Noise in electron devices

3.6.2
Noise models of active and passive devices
Semiconductor noise is associated with ﬂuctuations of the carrier velocity and popula-
tion. Diffusion noise is a general term addressing ﬂuctuations associated with transport
(reducing to thermal noise at or near thermodynamic equilibrium), while generation–
recombination (GR) noise refers to population ﬂuctuations associated with optical,
thermal, or avalanche (Auger) GR mechanisms. In some cases, noise models exist relat-
ing the noise behavior to the DC or small-signal parameters of the device. Examples
are passive circuits, diodes, and, with some added complexity, bipolar and ﬁeld-effect
transistors.
According to the Nyquist law, the (white, i.e., frequency-independent) power spectra
of the open-circuit noise voltage or short-circuit noise current of a resistor are
Svn( f ) = 4kBT R V2/Hz,
Sin( f ) = 4kBT G A2/Hz,

where B is the system bandwidth (B ≈Br, the bit rate). For a passive RLC one-port,
the generalized Nyquist law holds:
Svn(ω) = 4kBT Re [Z(ω)] V2/Hz,
Sin(ω) = 4kBT Re [Y(ω)] A2/Hz,
where Z and Y are the one-port impedance and admittance, respectively.
Diffusion and GR noise from junction devices (like diodes and bipolar transistors)
can be modeled through a shot noise model according to which noise is described by
a Poissonian process, whose power spectrum is proportional to the process mean (DC)
value according to Campbell’s theorem [34]. For a diode, the power spectrum of the
short-circuit noise current is
Sin(ω) = 2q (ID + 2I0) ≈2qID,
where ID is the total diode current and I0 the reverse saturation current. Note that in
reverse bias ID = −I0 and Sin(ω) = 2qI0. This model also holds in photodiodes, where
the total reverse current is dominated by the photocurrent IL, while I0 ≡Id is the dark
current. The bipolar transistor noise is also described by a shot noise model.
For ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs), compact noise models exist relating the short-
circuit gate and drain current ﬂuctuation power and correlation spectra to a set of small-
signal parameters. An example is the so-called PRC or Cappy high-frequency noise
model for the intrinsic FET noise [35], yielding

the parameters P, R, and C are measured (the default value is the ambient temperature
or, more exactly, T0 = 290 K). The circuit also includes thermal noise models for the
parasitic resistances. The parameters P, R, and C can be considered as ﬁtting factors; P
(also called β in MOSFET modeling) has an ideal value P = 2/3 in long-gate devices;
for R the ideal value is R = 5/4, while C expresses the correlation magnitude (typically
C ≈0.6 −0.7).11 The imaginary correlation spectrum implies that short-circuit gate
and drain current ﬂuctuations are in quadrature due to the capacitive coupling of channel
current ﬂuctuations to the gate. At low frequency, the gate noise spectrum SiGn and the
correlation spectrum SiGniDn become negligible, and only the output drain noise (white)
is signiﬁcant. A simpliﬁed intrinsic circuit, neglecting parasitics, is shown in Fig. 3.37.

3.7 Monolithic and hybrid microwave ICs and OEICs

3.7
Monolithic and hybrid microwave integrated circuits
and optoelectronic integrated circuits
High-speed electronic integrated circuits (ICs) can be implemented through two com-
plementary approaches, the hybrid IC and the monolithic IC. Integrated circuits oper-
ating in the microwave range (i.e., up to 30–40 GHz or 40 Gbps) are often denoted as
(monolithic) microwave integrated circuits, (M)MICs.
In the hybrid approach, the circuit is realized on a dielectric substrate, integrating all
distributed components and, possibly, some lumped components (which may, however,
also be inserted as discrete lumped elements through wire bonding or surface mount
techniques). In the hybrid approach, the semiconductor active elements are inserted as
lumped components and connected again through wirebonding or surface mount.
On the other hand, monolithic circuits integrate all active and passive elements on
a semiconductor substrate. While hybrid circuits often exploit distributed components
based on transmission line approaches, at least for narrowband applications, in mono-
lithic circuits the lumped approach is preferred, owing to the possibility of reducing the
circuit size (lumped components are much smaller than the guided wavelength, while
distributed elements, as already recalled, have characteristic sizes of the order of λg/4 at
centerband). Monolithic integrated circuits can be based on GaAs, InP, or Si substrates
and as active elements may exploit FETs or bipolars (typically HBTs).
According to the transmission medium used, we may have microstrip or coplanar
integrated circuits. Microstrip circuits are more compact in size due to the lower ground
plane, but require a precise control of the dielectric thickness, while coplanar circuits
are preferred at very high frequency (mm waves) or, as in mixed optoelectronic circuits,
because the coplanar waveguide is immediately compatible with the layout of some
optoelectronic devices (e.g., electrooptic modulators). Microstrip circuits in fact only
allow for straightforward connection of series elements (parallel elements are required
to reach the lower ground plane, often by etching a hole in the substrate, the so-called
via hole), while a coplanar circuit allows for the connection of both series and parallel
elements. Finally, the on-wafer high-frequency characterization requires connection of
the integrated circuit to the measurement setup through coplanar probes; to this purpose,
coplanar ground planes must be made available (e.g., through via holes) at the circuit
input and output.
A ﬁnal step toward monolithic integration is the integration of electronic circuits
with optoelectronic devices, leading to the so-called optoelectronic integrated circuits
(OEICs). In practice, the development of OEICs is conﬁned to a few speciﬁc com-
ponents, such as detectors and the related front-end ampliﬁer stages. In such cases,
the monolithic integration drastically reduces the interconnection parasitics; however,
the implementation of OEIC integration is fraught with problems associated with the
difﬁculty of realizing both transistors and optoelectronic components on the same semi-
conductor substrate with possibly different epitaxial layer structures. A few techniques
for realization of OEICs are reported in Fig. 3.38; the regrowth option allows us to
achieve the maximum degree of freedom in terms of the E and OE epitaxial structure,
but can create reliability problems, while in cases (a) and (b) etching is required to

remove the extra layers in the OE part. Note that most OE devices are junction devices
requiring doped layers, while E devices should be grown on a semi-insulating substrate.
In some cases, the same epitaxial structure can be used for the E and OE parts (see
Fig. 3.38(b)), with some compromise on layer optimization. Note that optoelectronic
integration with long-wavelength detectors or sources also requires the use of InP-based
electronics rather than of the more convenient GaAs-based electronics.
A qualitative example of the layout of a hybrid or monolithic integrated circuit in
microstrip or coplanar technology can be introduced as a simple, single-stage open-loop
ampliﬁer with two lumped bias Ts and input and output matching section. Figure 3.39
presents two possible circuit implementations, with distributed matching sections (a),
typically (but not necessarily) hybrid, or with lumped matching sections (b), usually
monolithic. Figure 3.39 (a) also shows the equivalent circuit of two microstrip to coaxial
connectors, modeled through a low-pass ﬁlter.
Figure 3.40 shows a simpliﬁed hybrid microstrip implementation of the single-
stage ampliﬁer, in which the input and output matching sections have been separately
realized on two different ceramic substrates. The active device is introduced in pack-
aged form and exploits as the ground plane (and also as the heat sink) a ridge
in the metal package. Bias Ts are implemented using as series inductors the par-
asitic wire bonding inductance; chip capacitors connected to the package as the
ground are also part of the bias T. The same ampliﬁer can be implemented in
monolithic form, as shown in Fig. 3.41, through lumped input and output matching
sections. Via holes are used quite liberally to provide local grounding, in addi-
tion to the ground pads needed for the input and output coplanar connectors. The
circuit shown is unpackaged. Finally, Fig. 3.42 shows a coplanar waveguide mono-
lithic implementation exploiting distributed matching sections. Due to the typically
small size of MMICs, such a solution is realistic only if the frequency is high
enough to make distributed elements compact, e.g., for millimeter wave opera-
tion. While coplanar waveguides easily allow for open- and short-circuit line stubs
(i.e., short pieces of transmission lines for the implementation of the distributed
matching sections), the layout is globally less compact, and ground planes have
to be connected together by air bridges to suppress spurious modes where the
two ground planes are at different potentials. Both in the microstrip and in the
coplanar layout, a source air bridge is used in the active component. The active device

Both hybrid and monolithic integrated circuits are typically packaged (in a metal
or dielectric enclosure) and connected to other subsystems through electrical con-
nectors. RF connectors are often coaxial, with diameter decreasing with increasing
frequency, and they correspond to microstrip–coaxial transitions. Sometimes, unpack-
aged MMICs are directly connected to a hybrid circuit that is in turn packaged, as shown
in Fig. 3.43.
A few coaxial to microstrip transitions ordered by increasing frequency operating
range are shown in Fig. 3.44. Soldered connectors can be used up to a few gigahertz,

is B = 1 Hz and compute the NF at low frequency and at fT /2.

Detectors
4.1
Photodetector basics
Photodetectors (PDs) are the ﬁrst block in the system receiver chain.1 Their purpose is
to convert an optical (analog or digital) signal into an electrical signal, typically a current
(the photocurrent, iL). The physical mechanism at the basis of semiconductor detectors
is the optical generation of electron–hole (e-h) pairs through the absorption of incident
photons. Photogenerated e-h pairs are then separated and collected to the external circuit
by an electric ﬁeld. Such a collecting ﬁeld can be induced by an external voltage bias
in a reverse-biased junction (as in pn, pin, and Schottky detectors), or in bulk (as in
photoconductors). In some cases, a third step (after photogeneration and collection) is
present: the photocurrent is ampliﬁed through external or built-in gain processes.
In the absence of illumination, detectors still have an output current, the dark cur-
rent id. The photocurrent is often linearly related to the input optical power pin(t)
as iL(t) = Rpin(t), where R is the detector responsivity (A/W); however, for large
input optical power the generated photocarriers ultimately screen the collecting electri-
cal ﬁeld, leading to current saturation. Since the photocurrent depends on the amount of
photogenerated carriers and, therefore, on the material absorption proﬁle vs. the wave-
length λ of the modulated optical carrier, the responsivity will depend on λ, R = R(λ),
with bandpass behavior. However, the optical bandwidth of most detectors is wide.
Finally, the quasi-static, memoriless relation iL = Rpin holds only when the optical
power varies slowly with time, or, for time-harmonic input optical power, with a mod-
ulation frequency lower than the device cutoff frequency. When the input power varies
too rapidly with time, the output current does not follow its instantaneous value, because
of low-pass or delay mechanisms, such as the effect of the device capacitance and the
effect of the transit time that photocarriers experience before being collected. We can
therefore deﬁne, in small-signal conditions and for a harmonic input optical power, a
frequency domain (complex) responsivity R(ω) relating the amplitude and phase of the
small-signal photocurrent component at ω to the amplitude and phase of the harmonic
input optical power. The function R(ω) is typically low-pass.
1 The input optical signal may be optically ampliﬁed before detection by a semiconductor optical ampliﬁer
(SOA); this closely corresponds to the architecture of RF receivers, where the ﬁrst function is low-noise
ampliﬁcation, followed by signal demodulation through a mixer or (in the simplest case) an envelope
detector. Photodetectors in direct detection receivers operate, in fact, as envelope detectors.

4.2 Photodetector structures
159
The output of the PD is a current, i.e., from the electrical standpoint the PD is a
high-output impedance device. In order to drive the receiver circuits connected to the
detector, the PD current has to be converted into a voltage through a load resistance
or, better, a transimpedance ampliﬁer (TIA) providing power ampliﬁcation. Besides the
photocurrent and dark current, the PD also generates an output noise current, that can
be modeled, in junction devices, according to a shot noise approach. PD noise can be
negligible composed with the noise from the front-end ampliﬁer, or dominant; in the
former case the receiver operates in the thermal noise limit, in the latter it operates in
the shot noise limit.

Photodetector structures
Photogenerated carriers are collected by an electric ﬁeld E, induced by an applied volt-
age in a bulk semiconductor or in a reverse-bias junction. Possible semiconductor-based
detector structures are:
• Bulk: photoresistors (photoconductors);
• pn junction-based: pn photodiodes, pin photodiodes, avalanche photodiodes
(APD), phototransistors;
• Metal–semiconductor

semiconductor–metal (MSM) photodiodes.
Among nonsemiconductor device choices, we have vacuum detectors and organic
detectors (somewhat similar to semiconductor detectors), which will not be discussed
here.
In photoconductors (Fig. 4.1(a)), photocarrier generation takes place in a neutral or
lightly doped bulk semiconductor, i.e., in a resistive region. The photogenerated excess

carrier density modulates the conductivity, thus leading to current modulation under
constant bias voltage. Carriers are removed to the external circuit by the almost uni-
form electric ﬁeld induced by the voltage bias. The device turns out to have high gain,
but the bandwidth is limited by the photocarrier lifetime. The dark current is very high
(but can be capacitively decoupled from the load) and (thermal) noise is typically large;
notice that the photoresistor is always working in the thermal noise limit. Photoconduc-
tors are simple, low-speed devices, not very well suited for high-performance telecom
applications.
Junction-based devices exploit the photocarrier generation in a reverse-bias pn, pin,
or Schottky junction. Photocarriers are removed to the external circuit by the junction
reverse electric ﬁeld, thus increasing the diode reverse saturation current (which, in
the absence of illumination, is the dark current). A somewhat naive implementation of
the concept is the pn photodiode, see Fig. 4.1(b); owing to the very small width of the
depletion region, photons are also absorbed in the adjacent diffusion regions, leading
to poor frequency response, limited by transit time and lifetime (besides RC capacitive
effects). As for other junction photodetectors, the dark current is small and noise is
mainly shot noise.
Optimization of the photodiode structure leads to pin photodiodes (Fig. 4.1(c)),
in which e-h generation occurs in a large intrinsic region sandwiched between high-
doping layers. The width of the intrinsic layer can be made large enough with respect
to the absorption length to render the related photocurrent contribution dominant over
the photocurrent originating from the diffusion regions; moreover, in Pi N heterostruc-
ture devices the doped layers are widegap and do not absorb light altogether at the
operating wavelength. Photocarriers are removed to the external circuit by the almost
uniform electric ﬁeld induced in the intrinsic region by the applied reverse bias. The
frequency response is limited by transit time and RC effects; noise is shot noise and the
dark current is low. The pin photodiode is a high-performance device, with achievable
bandwidths in excess of 40 GHz; due to the unit gain, the sensitivity is not outstanding.
Figure 4.2(a) shows a simpliﬁed scheme of the avalanche photodiode (or APD). In the
version shown, the structure is a pin diode to which an additional pn junction has been
added with a highly doped n side. Photogenerated electrons in the intrinsic layer are
removed to the high-ﬁeld region associated with the n+ p junction depletion layer, and
undergo avalanche multiplication. From the standpoint of responsivity, the APD can be
interpreted as a pin device to which a photocarrier gain (multiplication) block has been
added. The increase in responsivity is, however, obtained at the expense of increased
noise (multiplied shot noise and excess noise) and a reduction of bandwidth (due to the
additional delay introduced by the avalanche buildup). Despite the increase in noise,
the larger responsivity typically leads, at least in a thermal noise-limited receiver, to a
better (i.e., smaller) sensitivity. APDs were traditionally implemented in Si or Ge, but
in recent years more advanced heterostructure devices based on InGaAs have appeared
as competitors of pin photodiodes, at least up to 10 Gbps.
In phototransistors (Fig. 4.2(b)) photocarriers are generated in the base of a bipolar or
heterojunction bipolar transistor. The resulting base current is ampliﬁed by the transistor
common emitter current gain β, thus leading to an output collector current IC ≈βRPin

sistor has high gain, shot noise of the ampliﬁed collector current (but no excess noise
as in APDs); the bandwidth used to be limited by the low cutoff frequency of con-
ventional bipolar transistors but, at least in the laboratories, high-speed heterojunction
phototransistors reach speeds in excess of 10 Gbps.
Schottky or MSM detectors are based on Schottky (metal–semiconductor) junctions
in reverse bias (Fig. 4.2(c)); the operation is somewhat similar to that of pn or pin
diodes (although an additional photogeneration mechanism is introduced by carriers
photoexcited from the metal into the semiconductor) and the device structure is sim-
pler; however, illumination of the device area is an issue, due to metal absorption, thus
requiring interdigitated electrode structures. Moreover, the frequency response is often
affected by slow tails, which make the device less appealing for high-speed applications.
4.3
Photodetector materials
While the collection of photogenerated e-h pairs requires an electric ﬁeld to be applied
to photocarriers – a step whose implementation depends on the detailed device struc-
ture – the very possibility of carrier generation is related to the material absorption
proﬁle and, in particular, to the absorption threshold, i.e. the minimum energy photons
must have to be absorbed. From (2.1), absorbed photons must satisfy the condition:
E ph = ¯hω ≥Eg
−→λ [μm] ≤
1.24
Eg [eV].
Both direct-bandgap (GaAs, InGaAs, InP,. . . ) and indirect-bandgap (Si, Ge) semi-
conductors can be exploited in PDs; direct-bandgap materials typically have higher
absorption, which results in smaller absorption volumes and higher speed.

Absorption coefﬁcients of some direct-bandgap (InP, GaAs) and indirect-bandgap (Ge, Si)
semiconductors and comparison between the absorption lengths of Si and GaAs at the same
distance from the absorption edge; note the Ge composite behavior.
In fact, the exponential decrease of the optical power in the absorption region can be
expressed as
Pin(x) = Pin(0) exp(−αx) = Pin(0) exp(−x/Lα),
(4.1)
where Lα = 1/α is the absorption length, i.e., the distance wherein light attenuates by a
factor exp(−1) = 0.37 or −10 log10 (0.37) = 4.31 dB. To absorb light almost entirely,
the thickness d of the detector’s active (or absorption) region must be suitably larger
than Lα, or at least d ≈Lα. Considering the absorption length of typical direct-bandgap
and indirect-bandgap detectors (see Fig. 4.3), we see that in a direct-bandgap material
the thickness of the absorption region should be d ≈1 μm, while in indirect-bandgap
materials (e.g., in Si) d ≈100 μm. A large d corresponds to a high transit time, the
delay with which photocarriers are collected; this is a major limitation to the detector
speed.
In junction-based detectors (pn, pin and Schottky), however, the (depleted) absorp-
tion region acts as a capacitor, whose capacitance C ∝d−1 limits the detector speed,
due to RC cutoff. Increasing d, the transit-time-limited speed decreases, while the RC-
limited speed increases, thus leading to the need for a design trade-off, see Section 4.9.5.
Si-based detectors are typically limited by transit time, while in direct-bandgap
detectors a compromise is sought between transit time and RC cutoff.
Example 4.1: Compare the transit times for a direct-bandgap detector (assume α1 ≈
104 cm−1) and an indirect-bandgap detector (α2 ≈102 cm−1). Suppose that photocarri-
ers travel at saturation speed (v ≈107 cm/s).
We assume αL ≈1 or L = Lα = 1/α, with a transit time τ = L/v = 1/αv.
In the two cases considered, we obtain τ1 = (α1v)−1 = (104 · 107)−1 = 10 ps;

4.3 Photodetector materials
163
τ2 = (α2v)−1 = (102 · 107)−1 = 1 ns. The transit-time-limited bandwidth will be of
the order of fT = (2πτ)−1, i.e., fT 1 = (2πτ1)−1 = (2π · 10−11)−1 = 16 GHz and
fT 2 = (2πτ2)−1 = (2π · 10−9)−1 = 0.16 GHz, respectively.
To introduce an overview on the practically important photodetector materials, let
us consider the relation between the energy gaps of two semiconductors operating as
the emitter and the receiver in the same optical link. Since the emitted photon energy
is of the order of the emitting material energy gap Eg,e, this has to be larger than
the receiver material energy gap Eg,r, i.e., Eg,e ≥Eg,r. In principle, detectors have
a wide optical bandwidth, but this is limited by the behavior of the responsivity versus
the photon energy; such behavior suggests that the photon energy should be suitably
larger than the receiver gap, but not too large. Figure 4.4 shows the energy gap of
many relevant semiconductors and semiconductor alloys as a function of the lattice con-
stant, and includes three horizontal lines, one corresponding to AlGaAs/GaAs emission
(around 0.8 μm) and the others to InGaAsP emission (1.3 and 1.55 μm, exploited in
long-haul optical systems). AlGaAs/GaAs sources can exploit, as a receiver, materials
such as Si, Ge, and GaAs- or InP-based alloys. For long-wavelength sources (1.3 and
1.55 μm), possible receiver materials are Ge (or SiGe with a small Si fraction), InGaAs,
InGaAsP, InGaAsSb, and CdHgTe. Due to the relative immaturity of antimonides
and of CdHgTe, the receiver materials of choice are, in this case, InGaAs and (to a
certain extent) Ge. Si-based receivers cannot be exploited at all for long-wavelength
detection.

The most popular material for 1.55 and 1.3 μm high-performance detectors is prob-
ably InGaAs. This ternary alloy is a direct-bandgap material, with tunable Eg; it can
be grown through lattice-matched heteroepitaxy on InP substrates, with composition
In0.53Ga0.47As; in this case, of course, the bandgap is uniquely deﬁned. The corre-
sponding direct-bandgap quaternary alloy (InGaAsP) can be grown lattice-matched to
InP substrates, with variable gap. Although InGaAsP is the material of choice for long-
wavelength sources, in PDs the ternary alloy is usually preferred. Antimonide-based
alloys, such as the direct-bandgap ternary AlGaSb, can be grown on GaSb; however,
the technology of antimonides (including the quaternary InGaAsSb) is not competitive
at present with the InP technology.
Detectors for short-haul (e.g., local area network, LAN) applications (0.8 μm wave-
length) can be based on AlGaAs/GaAs. This direct-bandgap (up to 45% Al mole
fraction) ternary alloy can be grown lattice-matched on GaAs substrates and has a
mature technology and a comparatively low cost. Due to the very similar avalanche
ionization coefﬁcients of electrons and holes, however, this material is not well suited
to avalanche detectors; see Section 4.12. Silicon used to be a material of choice for
0.8 μm detectors, and obviously has the advantage of mature technology and low
cost, besides being well suited to avalanche detector design due to the very different
hole and electron avalanche ionization coefﬁcients. However, the comparatively low
absorption conﬁnes silicon to low-speed applications, at least if conventional (vertical)
photodetector structures are used.
Germanium is an indirect bandgap material (Eg,i ≈0.66 eV) with a larger direct
bandgap (Eg,d ≈0.8 eV). The corresponding absorption edge wavelengths are
λi ≈1.24
0.66 = 1.87 μm,
λd ≈1.24
0.8 = 1.55 μm.
The secondary, direct absorption edge therefore allows for the detection of long-
wavelength radiation (in particular 1.3 μm). The substrate technology is mature enough
and the avalanche coefﬁcients of electrons and holes are quite different (so that good
quality, low noise avalanche detectors can be developed). Emerging SiGe technologies
have given this material interesting perspectives for integration on a Si substrate; unfor-
tunately, Si-rich alloys, with low mismatch with respect to the Si substrate, have optical
properties close to those of Si. Ge-rich alloys, on the other hand, exhibit large mismatch
with the Si substrate, and the related growth technology on Si substrates still poses
problems.
HgCdTe (cadmium mercury telluride, also called MERCAD or MERCATEL) is a
ternary alloy whose components are a semiconductor (CdTe) and a compound with
metal bandstructure (HgTe). Assuming that a metal has negative energy gap (i.e., the
valence band edge is above the conduction band edge, and the two bands overlap), the
MERCAD gap can be tuned down to almost zero, making this material a suitable alloy
for FIR detection. The substrate of choice is CdTe. Despite the complex technology, this
material still is very popular for FIR detectors (much less for long-wavelength com-
munication detectors), although the small gap and resulting large intrinsic population
require low-temperature operation.

4.3.1
Extrinsic and QW detectors
The detectors discussed so far, called intrinsic detectors, are based on band-to-band
absorption processes, and their responsivity vanishes for photon energies below the
material absorption edge Eg. This limitation can be somewhat overcome in the so-called
extrinsic detectors. Bulk extrinsic detectors make use of low-energy transitions between
trap levels and the conduction or valence band, and can therefore detect FIR radia-
tion, albeit with low responsivity (Fig. 4.5, left). The same result can be achieved by
exploiting low-energy intersubband transitions, as in quantum well (QW) detectors; see
Fig. 4.5, right. Compared with low-gap HgCdTe FIR detectors, the QW solution allows
for a larger energy gap, and therefore is able to relax constraints on low-temperature
operation related to the need to lower the intrinsic carrier concentration (however, low-
T operation is also needed to suppress background noise). Another promising area for
QW intersubband detectors based on widegap semiconductors (e.g., GaN) may be the
development of long-wavelength receivers.

Photodetector parameters
4.4.1
PD constitutive relation
From the electrical standpoint, photodetectors are one-ports with a second (optical)
input port. Assume that the (modulated) input optical power around wavelength λ is
pin(t) and that the output current is iP D (including the photocurrent iL and the dark
current id); the PD is generally characterized by the constitutive relation
iP D(t) = f

pin(t), vP D(t); d
dt , λ

,
(4.2)
where vP D is the detector voltage, and λ is the wavelength of the optical carrier (inﬂu-
encing the material absorption and therefore the amount of generated photocarriers).
The time derivative implies that the relation between pin, vP D and the output current
iP D will not, in general, be memoriless. In fact, as already mentioned, the photocurrent
response vs. pin is lowpass and, moreover, detectors typically include reactive electri-
cal elements (such as junction capacitances and stray inductances). The output current
(taken as positive entering, see Fig. 4.6, left) can be decomposed as
iP D = iL + id,

In DC stationary conditions we have
IP D = f (Pin, VP D; 0, λ) = IL + Id,
where Id = f (0, VP D; 0, λ) is the DC dark current, IL = f (Pin, VP D; 0, λ) −Id is
the DC photocurrent.
Equation (4.2) implies that, in general, the relation between the photodiode current
and the optical power is nonlinear (i.e., the photocurrent is not simply proportional
to the input optical power) and dispersive or with memory (according to the already-
mentioned low-pass behavior). However, for a slowly varying pin(t), (4.2) reduces to a
memoriless (quasi-static) relation that can be often linearly approximated as
iP D(t) = iL + id ≈R(λ, vP D)pin(t) + id(vP D),
(4.5)
where R is the photodetector responsivity, in general (as already mentioned) a function
of the optical carrier wavelength, but also, in some devices (e.g., in avalanche detectors),
of the photodiode output voltage. In many detectors (e.g., photodiodes in reverse bias),
both the dark current and the responsivity are, however, virtually independent of vP D,
and the dark current (the diode reverse saturation current) is small, so that
iP D(t) = R(λ)pin(t) + Id ≈R(λ)pin(t).
The linear dependence for the photocurrent iL, see Fig. 4.6, right, typically holds
for input optical powers Pin < Pin,sat where Pin,sat is the saturation optical power at
which the photocurrent saturates at IL,sat (the total photodetector current saturates at
IP D,sat = IL,sat + Id ≈IL,sat). The decrease in the responsivity at high optical power
and the ultimate saturation (Fig. 4.6, right) is due to device-speciﬁc intrinsic effects
(e.g., space-charge screening of the electric ﬁeld collecting photocarriers); however, the
total photodetector current can also saturate due to the circuit loading conditions.

4.4 Photodetector parameters

4.4.2
Responsivity and quantum efﬁciency
The detector photocurrent (and therefore the responsivity) can in principle be derived
by integrating the optical generation rate Go, see (2.43), over the device active volume:
IL = q

V
Go(r, Pin) dr.
From IL the device responsivity can in turn be obtained as
R = IL
Pin
or Rdiff = dIL
dPin
.
The ﬁrst deﬁnition is called the incremental responsivity, the second the differential
responsivity; they coincide if the current–power characteristic is linear, see (4.5).
A more elementary derivation of Go can, however, be useful to derive an ideal, best-
case limit to the detector sensitivity. As a ﬁrst step, we directly relate Go to the optical
power as follows. Differentiating (4.1) with respect to x and deﬁning 4Pin = Pin/A as
the optical power density (W/m2), with A the detection area, we have
d4Pin(x)
dx
= −α 4Pin(x) →Energy lost due to absorption
t · V
= −4Pin
x
= α 4Pin.
Dividing by the photon energy E ph = ¯hω, we obtain
(Energy lost) / (t · V )
Photon energy ¯hω
= α 4Pin
¯hω = Number of photons absorbed
t · V
= Number of e-h pairs generated
t · V
= Go.
That is,
Go = α 4Pin
¯hω ,
(4.6)
where Go is the optical generation rate associated with the external photon ﬂux, i.e.,
the number of e-h pairs generated per unit time and volume. Equation (4.6) coincides
(with Pop ≡4Pin) with the result in (2.43), derived from perturbation theory. Since the
optical power density decreases exponentially with x, the same behavior is followed by
the optical generation rate:
Go(x) = α 4Pin(x)
¯hω
= α 4Pin(0)
¯hω
exp(−x/Lα) = Go(0) exp(−x/Lα).
Assume now that all the incoming optical power is absorbed, and all of the generated
e-h pairs are collected as a current ﬂowing in the external circuit (each photogenerated
e-h pair, once collected in the external circuit, causes one electron to ﬂow through it).

where Pin(0) is the incident power. From this simpliﬁed model, it follows that the
photocurrent indeed depends linearly on Pin(0) through the responsivity R:
IL = q
¯hω Pin(0) = RPin(0).
(4.7)
Using power and current densities, we similarly have JL = R4Pin(0). The responsivity is
thus measured in A/W (as the current–power ratio, or, equivalently, the current density–
power density ratio).
The above analysis is based on the assumption that each incident photon generates an
electron in the external circuit, and leads to an ideal, best-case value for the responsivity.
From (4.7) one has
R = q
¯hω =
q
E ph
,
(4.8)
holding when all of the incident photons are absorbed and converted into the exter-
nal short-circuit current. In such best-case conditions, the responsivity has a maximum
Rmax as a function of the photon energy that can be derived as follows: for photon ener-
gies below the absorption threshold, the responsivity is zero; assuming a sharp increase
of α above threshold, from (4.8) one has that R is maximum for E ph ≈Eg, i.e.,
Rmax ≈q
Eg
=

Eg [eV] ≈λ[μm]
1.24 .
(4.9)
For E ph > Eg, the responsivity ideally decreases with increasing E ph as
R(E ph) ≈Rmax
Eg
E ph
,
according to the behavior in Fig. 4.7; for energies close to the threshold, the responsivity
approximately follows the absorption coefﬁcient, while for higher energies it decreases
as the inverse of the photon energy.2
2 From a physical standpoint, the decrease of responsivity with increasing photon energy is related to the fact
that an energetic photon having an excess energy with respect to the threshold ≈Eg still generates just
one electron–hole pair, the extra energy being dissipated through phonon emission, i.e., heat. For example,
a photon with E ph = 2Eg still generates the same current as a photon with E ph ≈Eg, at the expense of
twice the optical power; as a consequence, the responsivity is one half of the maximum value at E ph ≈Eg.

Ideal maximum responsivity 1/Eg[eV] vs. energy gap and corresponding wavelength.
Due to the inverse dependence of Rmax on the energy gap, see Fig. 4.8, very large
maximum responsivities are achieved in far infrared detectors; for long-wavelength
infrared detectors for optical communications the maximum responsivity has an order
of magnitude of 1 A/W. Responsivities in excess of the maximum ideal value can be
achieved in devices with internal gain.
In real devices, the number of electrons ﬂowing in the external circuit can be substan-
tially lower than the number of incident photons, leading to a responsivity smaller than
the ideal value given by (4.8). This happens because the incident light has to undergo a
number of steps before being converted into a current, see Fig. 4.9:

3. Part of the power is absorbed in regions of where it does not contribute to useful
output current.
4. Part of the power is transmitted through the PD without being absorbed.
5. Finally, part of the power is absorbed and yields a useful current component.
Additional detector ﬁgures of merit are the internal quantum efﬁciency ηQ and the
external (or device) quantum efﬁciency ηx. The internal quantum efﬁciency is deﬁned as
ηQ =
generated pairs
photons reaching the active region;
typically ηQ ≈1. On the other hand, ηx is directly related to the responsivity, since
ηx =
collected pairs
incident photons =
IL/q
Pin/¯hω = ¯hω
q R < ηQ.
(4.10)
In general, ηx ≤1 in the absence of gain. If we assume ideal operation ηx = 1 ≡ηQ
and we obtain again (4.8) and (4.9).
The responsivity of real devices is smaller than the ideal value, but clearly exhibits the
theoretical bandpass behavior versus the operating wavelength. An example is reported
in Fig. 4.10, referring to a Si pin photodiode and a Pi N InGaAs photodiode.3 The
measured responsivity shows an abrupt increase corresponding to the absorption edge,
and then decreases with increasing energy. For the InGaAs Pi N diode, the abrupt fall
of the responsivity at short wavelength is due to the fact that, for such energies, absorp-
tion also takes place in the surrounding cladding widegap layers, in particular in the
upper cladding layer (producing no useful output current). Both devices exhibit a very
large optical bandwidth, well in excess of 200 nm. The same remark applies to a Ge
photodiode realized with an innovative Ge on Si process [38]; Fig. 4.10 also shows,
for comparison, the maximum responsivity Rmax of an ideal detector with unit external
efﬁciency, see (4.9); the ideal value is remarkably close to the peak responsivity of real
devices. From the material standpoint, InGaAs offers excellent properties at long wave-
length (1.55 and 1.3 μm), and so does Ge; Si, as already remarked, is only effective at
short wavelength, e.g., around 0.8 μm.

4.4.3
PD electrical bandwidth and equivalent circuit
The responsivity concept can readily be extended to describe the detector frequency
response, assuming that the device operates linearly (or is linearized, e.g., around a
DC condition). We start from the constitutive relation in (4.2), for brevity dropping the
wavelength dependence:
iP D(t) = f

pin(t), vP D(t), d
dt

.
We separate the DC and signal component (the subscript 0 denotes the DC working
point):
Pin = Pin,0 + ˆpin(t),
VP D = VP D,0 + ˆvP D(t),
IP D = IP D,0 + ˆıP D(t),
and, assuming sinusoidal modulation of light, we associate phasors with the signal
components as follows:
ˆpin(t) = Re

where the second and third terms are the small-signal photocurrent ˆıL and dark current

where R(ω) is the (complex) small-signal responsivity, YP D(ω) the detector small-
signal admittance. The phasor associated with ˆıP D(t) is therefore
ˆIP D(ω) = YP D(ω) ˆVP D(ω) + ˆIL(ω),
where the signal photocurrent phasor ˆIL(ω) is linearly related to the signal optical power
phasor as
ˆIL(ω) = R(ω) ˆPin(ω).
In the linearized model, ˆIP D = ˆIL for ˆVP D = 0; thus, ˆIL is often referred to as the
short-circuit photocurrent (i.e., the photocurrent of the detector whose small-signal load
is a short).
The complex responsivity R(ω), describing the detector small-signal frequency
response, is typically a low-pass function of the modulation frequency; see Fig. 4.11.
Narrowband photodetectors can, however, be designed for analog applications (i.e.,
for detecting analog narrowband signals modulating an optical carrier). A normalized
responsivity r(ω) can be deﬁned from

The above (intrinsic) cutoff frequency refers to the short-circuit photocurrent and is
therefore independent of the detector loading. Transit time, avalanche buildup delay,
phototransistor current gain high-frequency cutoff are typically accounted for in the
intrinsic cutoff frequency. On the other hand, the overall detector response is also
affected by the load impedance and by parasitic (extrinsic) elements. The main load-
related cutoff mechanism is the RC cutoff, caused by the combined effect of the device
internal and extrinsic capacitance with the load resistance.4
A quantitative evaluation of the total cutoff frequency can be based on the simpli-
ﬁed equivalent circuit of the photodetector in Fig. 4.12. In the frequency domain, the
photodetector can be modeled by the current–voltage phasor relation:
IP D(ω) =

Y i
P D(ω) + Y x
P D(ω)

VP D(ω) + IL(ω),
where IL = R(ω)Pin is the short-circuit photocurrent component at ω (modeled as a
current source), Y i
P D is the detector intrinsic admittance, and Y x
P D is the detector par-
asitic (usually capacitive) admittance. The above representation leads directly to the
circuit in Fig. 4.12, left. The load impedance ZL (modeling, for example, the input
capacitance or resistance of a front-end ampliﬁer) clearly adds to the detector capacitive
and resistive loading, and therefore inﬂuences the bandwidth of the loaded detector. As
already mentioned, we include in the frequency-dependent responsivity R(ω) intrinsic
cutoff effects only, while the RC cutoff is handled at a circuit level. Assuming ZL = RL
and a total detector capacitance CP D, the current on the load IRL = −IP D will be

Since in junction-based detectors the DC current is small (dark current) and often
bias-independent, in the ﬁrst approximation the detector large-signal model is sim-
ply the parallel of a capacitive (sometimes nonlinear) admittance with two current
generators modeling the photocurrent iL (linearly dependent on the optical power)
and the dark current id (often negligible); see Fig. 4.12, right. Other effects, such
as a voltage-dependent photocurrent (due, e.g., to a voltage-dependent internal gain)
or a nonlinear detector input admittance (as in pn photodiodes), can be readily
implemented at a circuit level, as well as more complex parasitic networks includ-
ing series connector resistances, wire inductances and distributed transmission line
elements.
4.4.4
Photodetector gain
In some detectors (e.g., pn and pin photodiodes), the number of collected pairs is
approximately equal to the number of generated pairs. However, certain detectors have
internal gain mechanisms whereby the number of collected pairs may be much larger
than the number of generated pairs. The internal gain implies the ampliﬁcation AI of
the photocurrent that would have been (in theory) generated if no gain were present
(called the primary photocurrent). If we deﬁne a comparison ideal device with primary
photocurrent only and responsivity R|AI =1, we have
R = AI R|AI =1 .
Examples of photodetectors with gain are the avalanche photodiode (due to the
avalanche multiplication of carriers), the phototransistor (due to the transistor current
gain), and also the photoresistor. Apart from intrinsic mechanisms, photodetector gain
can also be obtained by cascading the detector with active blocks:
• in front of the detector, as an optical ampliﬁer (e.g., a semiconductor optical
ampliﬁer, SOA);
• after the detector, as an electronic front-end ampliﬁer, possibly integrated with the
detector into an integrated receiver.
4.5
Photodetector noise
The short-circuit photocurrent is affected by random ﬂuctuations, i.e., by noise.
Photodetector noise is the result of noise in the input light (e.g., laser noise, see
Section 5.13.4, plus additional noise from optical ampliﬁers) converted into current,
plus the contribution of the detector; see Fig. 4.13. We neglect for the moment the

resented, from a circuit standpoint, as a zero-average noise current in superimposed on

A simpliﬁed equivalent circuit of the detector including noise generators is shown in
Fig. 4.14. In many cases, the power spectrum is white (i.e., constant with frequency) and
i2n = Sin B,
where B is the system bandwidth (B ≈Br, the bit rate).
Detector noise can be modeled as thermal noise (in photoresistors), shot noise (in
photodiodes and phototransistors), or multiplied shot noise (in avalanche detectors).
For photoresistors we have, from the Nyquist law, Sin = 4kBT G, where kB is the Boltz-
mann constant, T the operating temperature, and G the photoresistor conductance; the
r.m.s. value of the noise current is
in,rms =

i2n =

5 Converted input noise is light noise transformed into electrical (current) noise by detection. In the ideal
case, light noise is only affected by the shot noise deriving from the corpuscular nature of light; conversion
of such a light quantum noise leads to the so-called quantum noise limit of the receiver.

176
Detectors
In photodiodes operating with constant current IP D the shot noise model yields the
power spectrum:
Sin = 2qIP D = 2qIL + 2qId = 2qRPin + 2qId ≈2qRPin.
(4.11)
If the photodiode operates in small-signal conditions (as in an analog link), the shot
noise process is second-order stationary and (4.11) applies, where IP D is the photodiode
bias current. In digital operation, the photodiode current ideally assumes two values
corresponding to the one and zero levels (e.g., 0 for the low level and IL for the high
level), and the shot noise process becomes nonstationary. However, for realistic bit rates
a quasi-stationary approximation can be made, and a slowly varying power spectrum
with average value between 2qIL + 2qId and 2qId ≈0 can be assumed as the noise
spectrum. The r.m.s. noise current for the high level is therefore
i2n = 2qIL B + 2qId B ≈2qRPin B,
neglecting the shot noise contribution of the dark current, and the averaged value (over
high and low states, assuming 50% probability) is i2n/2.
Noise is obviously a major concern in detectors, owing to their position as the ﬁrst
block in the receiver chain, and affects the receiver sensitivity S, i.e., the minimum input
power needed to achieve a desired SNR (signal to noise ratio) at the receiver output.
Neglecting input laser noise, the detector output SNR can be expressed as the ratio of
the signal and noise available powers. We refer here to a digital link, with a simple
intensity modulation (IM) scheme. In the high state, the input power is Pin and the
detector current I 2
P D ≈I 2
L; in the low state, the input power is zero and I 2
P D = I 2
d ≈0.
We can now compute the photodiode output SNR, averaging both the output available
detector signal and noise powers and assuming a detector output conductance G P D
(which actually simpliﬁes out) as follows:6

where we have neglected the dark-current shot noise. The averaged SNR is therefore
simply the SNR in the high level; we will exploit this result in what follows without
further discussion.
Since in a loaded detector the SNR is also inﬂuenced by the noise (typically thermal)
introduced by the front-end ampliﬁer stage, (4.12), corresponds to an ideal case (called
the shot noise limit) in which the detector load is noiseless and the SNR increases as the
photocurrent, i.e., as the optical power. Suppose now that we consider the load thermal
noise contribution as a noise current in,L in parallel to the photodiode noise current in,
such as

n,L =
	
4kBT Gn B,
6 The discussion holds for a digital modulation scheme, or for an analog, large-signal, modulation scheme
where the signal amplitude is comparable to the bias; in (strictly) small-signal analog modulation, noise is
established by the DC working point and the r.m.s. noise current is independent of the signal current.

where the SNR increases as the square of the optical power. This condition is the thermal
noise limit of the detector. From the desired SNR, the sensitivity S can be obtained
directly; in the shot noise limit one has
S = 2q B
R SNR,
i.e., the sensitivity increases as the bandwidth or the bit rate.
The SNR and the sensitivity can be considered as system-level ﬁgures of merit for
the receiver. More speciﬁc device-level noise parameters are:
• The noise equivalent power, NEP or PN E P, deﬁned as the optical input power yield-
ing a short-circuit SNR equal to one. The NEP deﬁnes the detector noise ﬂoor, since
in such conditions the detector output SNR is unity. In the short-circuit case, the load
is RL = 0 and therefore iL,n = 0; thus, the device operates in the shot noise limit,
and we must impose
SNR =
I 2
L
2qIL B + 2qId B =
R2P2
N E P
2qRPN E P B + 2qId B = 1,
from which PN E P can be derived; we also have two limiting cases according to
whether the photocurrent is larger or smaller than the dark current (remember that
in these conditions the input optical power and therefore the photocurrent is very
small):
– Shot-noise-limited NEP: PN E P = 2q B/R;
– Dark-current-limited NEP: PN E P = √2qId B/R.
• The photodetector detectivity, deﬁned as the inverse of the NEP:
D =

NEP.
Moreover, the speciﬁc detectivity (D∗) is deﬁned, in the dark current limit, by
normalizing with respect to the device area A and the bandwidth:
D∗=

NEP .
Finally, an optics-independent speciﬁc detectivity (D∗∗) can be deﬁned with refer-
ence to the numerical aperture of the optical system NA:
D∗∗= D∗· NA.

devices and front-end ampliﬁer choices.

Photodiodes
In general, the DC photodiode current can be modeled, taking into account the Shockley
junction diode law (yielding the dark current) and the photocurrent IL = RPin, as
IP D = RPin −I0

exp

−VP D
ηVT

−1

,
where the current positive sign is taken in the reverse direction (i.e., the forward current
is negative, the photocurrent is positive). VP D is the reverse bias voltage, I0 is the reverse
saturation current; see Fig. 4.15. The thermal voltage is VT = kBT/q = 26 mV at T =
300 K, and η is the ideality factor (1 ≤η ≤2). For VP D/ηVT ≫1 (i.e., in reverse bias)
one has
IP D ≈RPin + Id.
That is, the photodiode current is proportional to the input power, and Id = I0 is the
dark current. The region in which IP D > 0, VP D > 0 is the photodiode region; see
Fig. 4.15. If the device is under weak direct bias (VP D < 0), the photocurrent may domi-
nate IP D > 0; this is the photovoltaic region, in which the device acts as a power source,
i.e., converts the input optical power into electrical power. In this region, the applied bias
is negative but the current is positive, leading to a net power ﬂow from the photodiode
to the external circuit. The photovoltaic region is the operation mode of the photodi-
ode as a solar cell. However, the signal properties of the photodiode degrade, since the
photocurrent is increasingly masked by the direct current; moreover, the responsivity
will rapidly saturate for increasing input optical power. Finally, in the direct region the

photocurrent is masked by the large direct current, and net electrical power is absorbed –
an operation mode unsuited to both telecom and energy applications.
In practical cases, of course, the photodiode has to be connected to a load, rather than
to an ideal voltage source; linearity of the current–power response of the loaded device
is preserved until the instantaneous device working point is in the photodiode region, but
(extrinsic) current compression and saturation arise as soon as the input optical power
increases so as to bring the instantaneous working point into the photovoltaic region.
4.7
The pn photodiode
A pn photodiode usually has a thin p-type, highly doped layer lying on the device
surface, on top of a n-type, less doped substrate; see Fig. 4.16. The total photocur-
rent results from e-h pairs generated in both the depletion region and the n-side and
p-side diffusion regions, whose equivalent width is of the order of the diffusion length
in the two sides, Lnp = 	Dnpτn for electrons in the p side (where Dnp is the electron
diffusivity, τn the electron lifetime), Lhn = √Dhnτh for holes in the n side (where Dhn
is the hole diffusivity, τh the hole lifetime); see Section 1.8.2. Let us assume for simplic-
ity that the optical generation rate is uniform and equal to Go along the photodiode;7
the total DC current (see (4.24), evaluated for ω = 0 and with Go ≈Gon ≈Gop) is
IL = q A

Go dx + ILp + ILn ≈q AGo(W + Lnp + Lhn).

optical power, a frequency-domain small-signal analysis shows (see (4.24), with Go ≈

Thus, the additional response proportional to 4Lnp + 4Lhn exhibits a cutoff frequency of
the order of the inverse of the lifetime, and the whole response has a double cutoff (low
frequency, proportional to the inverse of the lifetime; high frequency, associated with
transit time and capacitance effects), as shown in Fig. 4.17. From a system standpoint,
this is quite an inconvenient response, and the device speed is practically limited by the
device lifetime (with maximum cutoff frequencies of the order of 100–200 MHz)
4.7.1
Analysis of the pn photodiode response
To evaluate the pn photodiode total current, we assume that the diode has an abrupt
doping proﬁle, with junction plane at x = 0. The p-type side has uniform doping NA
and extends (ideally) from −∞to 0; the n-type side extends from 0 to +∞. Across
the junction plane, a depletion (space-charge) region hosts a dipole layer supporting,
in equilibrium (i.e., for zero applied bias), the built-in voltage Vbi. The space-charge
region extends from −x p (p side) to xn (n side). By imposing equilibrium conditions
and the Boltzmann statistics, the built-in voltage can be derived, as a function of the
side dopings and of the intrinsic semiconductor concentration, as9
8 Remember that (4.13) holds when the absorption length is larger than the total equivalent absorption width,
i.e., when α(W + Lnp + Lhn) < 1. For arbitrary α, (4.13) would lead to an unphysical result, larger than
the ideal limit in (4.9).
9 The pn junction theory is covered in all textbooks on electron devices, see, e.g., [31].

To evaluate the photocurrent, assume for simplicity that the photogeneration term is
constant in the two sides and in the depletion region and assumes, respectively, values
Gop (p side), Gon (n side), and Go (depletion region). This assumption will be conve-
niently removed in the analysis of the pin photodiode. Minority carriers in excess with
respect to the thermodynamic equilibrium condition (corresponding to zero applied bias
and no illumination), i.e., excess electrons in the p side, excess holes in the n side, fol-
low the electron and hole continuity equations, respectively. In the two sides we assume
quasi-neutrality (i.e., negligible electric ﬁeld), and carrier recombination is modeled by
the lifetime approximation. Assuming that the structure is one-dimensional along x, the
time-domain continuity equations read

To evaluate the current, let us express the total current density −JP D (taken as posi-
tive outgoing from the p side) as the sum of drift Jn,dr and diffusion Jh,d currents of
electrons and holes (taken as positive in the positive x direction):
−JP D = Jn,dr + Jn,d + Jh,dr + Jh,d.
However, in the n side the drift current of the minority carriers (holes) is negligible, and
so is the drift electron current density in the p side; we thus have
Jn ≈Jn,d for x ≤−x p (p side)
Jh ≈Jh,d
for x ≥xn (n side).
In the depletion region, only the optical generation term is considered (thermal genera-
tion is neglected) and the continuity equations for the electron and hole current densities
can be expressed as

−x p
Go dx ≈−qWGo,
i.e.,
Jn(xn) = Jn(−x p) −qWGo.
We can now conveniently express the total current (which is independent of x) in a
section corresponding to the depletion region edges; e.g., in point xn,
−JP D = Jn(xn) + Jh(xn) = Jn(−x p) −qWGo + Jh(xn)
= Jn,d(−x p) + Jh,d(xn) −qWGo,
since
Jn(−x p) = Jn,d(−x p),
Jh(xn) = Jh,d(xn).
We obtain the same result evaluating the current in −x p. Expressing all current densities
as a function of the excess charge gradients (see Section 1.8.1), we ﬁnally have

a positive contribution to the total detector current IP D for large negative applied volt-
age VA. From (4.24) the photocurrent IL is found to include three contributions, the ﬁrst
two referring to the diffusion regions, the last (typically much smaller) to the depletion
region. Although the diffusion contribution apparently enhances the photocurrent, in
fact this contribution rapidly decreases with increasing speed of the input optical sig-
nal, with a characteristic time given by the lifetime (in a direct-gap semiconductor, of
the order of 1 ns, much larger in indirect-gap semiconductors). As a result, the overall
device response exhibits an early cutoff (due to lifetime) plus a very high-frequency
transit-time or RC cutoff.

4.8
The pin photodiode
To improve the frequency response and the high-frequency efﬁciency, the depletion
region width W should be made much larger than the width of the diffusion region.
However, in the pn diode this would require impractically large reverse voltages. An
obvious solution is to interpose a lightly doped or intrinsic region between the p and
n layers that is completely depleted in reverse bias and whose electric ﬁeld is almost
constant (since the space charge is negligible). The resulting structure is the pin pho-
todiode, see Fig. 4.18 (above); by proper design W ≫Lhn + Lnp, making diffusion
photocurrents negligible. Additionally, exploiting compound semiconductors and het-
erojunction devices, the slow part of the response can be suppressed altogether through
NpP or Ni P structures, where N or P as usual denote widegap semiconductors (e.g.,
AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs or InP/InAlAs/InP); in this way, no absorption at all takes place
in the external regions and the related current contribution vanishes.
Compound semiconductor pin structures (usually Pi N) are today probably among
the best component available for 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps systems, although for 10 Gbps
application a competition exists with avalanche photodiodes. Cutoff frequencies in
excess of 80 GHz have been demonstrated. Usually, a compromise must be reached
between speed and responsivity (efﬁciency); the device speed is dominated by transit

structures such as traveling-wave waveguide photodiodes; see Section 4.10.2.
4.8.1
The pin photocurrent, responsivity, and efﬁciency
The depletion region of a pin photodiode in reverse bias supports a constant electric
ﬁeld and linearly varying energy bands. In fact, from Poisson’s equation we have
d2φ
dx2 = −q
ϵ (N +
D −N −
A + p −n) ≈0
if we neglect the intrinsic region background doping and assume that the generated
photocharge is negligible or quasi-neutral. This implies that φ is a linear function of
position and, therefore, so is the conduction band edge Ec = −qφ + C, where C is an
arbitrary constant; see Fig. 4.18 (below). The main contribution to the photocurrent is
given by the drift current associated with carriers generated inside the intrinsic depleted
region; secondary contributions (which disappear in heterojunction devices) come from
the diffusion regions. Due to the large width of the depletion region W, the optical
generation rate will be nonuniform, according to the law
Go(x) = ηQ
Pin (1 −R)
Ah f
αe−αx = Go(0)e−αx,
where ηQ is the intrinsic quantum efﬁciency, Pin the total incident power on the left
(upper) photodiode facet, A is the detector area, h f is the photon energy, α is the
material absorption, and R is the power reﬂectivity of the upper surface.
The analysis of the DC pin current IP D (taken as positive outcoming from the p
terminal; the sign is opposite to currents deﬁned positive along the positive x axis)
follows the same ideas as for the pn photodiode, i.e., the decomposition of the total
current in electron (drift and diffusion) and hole (drift and diffusion) components. The
device current is constant in x and can be expressed as
−IP D = In(x) + Ih(x) = In,dr(x) + In,d(x) + Ih,dr(x) + Ih,d(x).
We consider a structure with a surface p+ layer and an n+ substrate. The depletion
region begins approximately in x = Wp and extends until x = W + Wp. In the p+
region the electron (minority carrier) current is diffusion only, while in the n+ region
the hole current is diffusion only. Thus,
−IP D = In,d(Wp) + Ih(Wp) = In(W + Wp) + Ih,d(W + Wp).
(4.25)
Multiplying the electron continuity equation (4.21) on the depletion region by the diode
area A,
dIn
dx = −q AGo,
and integrating over the depletion region, we obtain
In(W + Wp) −In(Wp) ≈In(W + Wp) −In,d(Wp) = Ii,

(4.28)
where the ﬁrst contribution includes the diffusion current from the surface layer; the
second contribution, the (photogenerated) drift current from the intrinsic layer; the third
contribution, the diffusion current from the substrate. In the diffusion currents, we have
both photocurrent and dark current components.
Carrying out the integration in (4.27) and expressing the optical generation rate Go

Concerning the diffusion contributions, we have to solve the same excess carrier equa-

different boundary conditions.
In practical structures, the highly doped surface side p+ is very thin, i.e., Wp ≪Lα,

The diffusion contributions to currents are much slower than the drift contributions in
dynamic operation, and should be reduced to optimize the high-speed response. This can
be immediately achieved in heterojunction devices, where the substrate layer below the
absorption region is widegap and therefore does not appreciably absorb light. To maxi-
mize ηx, we must also require that the thickness of the top layer be much smaller than
α−1, or that the top layer again be widegap, i.e., transparent to the incoming light. For
high-speed, high-efﬁciency photodiodes αWp →0 and αLhn →0, so that the external

Conventional pin photodetector structures
Most high-performance pin detectors for long-wavelength communication systems
exploit vertically illuminated structures with InGaAs absorption layers. An example of
a diffused surface illuminated pin with planar layout and top ring electrodes is shown
in Fig. 4.19 together with a mesa version where the lateral sides are etched and the free
surface is properly passivated to avoid large dark currents. In the planar structure, the
intrinsic or n−-type (also called ν-type) absorption layer is followed by an n-doped InP
epitaxial buffer grown on the n-type InP substrate. In some cases, as in the structure
shown in Fig. 4.20(b), the intrinsic absorption layer is followed by a nonabsorbing drift
layer. The pn junction is obtained through diffusion, thus separating the junction from
the hetero-interface; diffusion also allows the junction not to extend to the device sur-
face. The ring electrode (p-contact) is clearly visible, while the n+ layer is conﬁned
(rectangular footprint) to the device area; the external coplanar electrodes are deposited
on a semi-insulating (S.I.) InP layer to decrease the parasitic capacitance and losses. The
same device can also be realized with illumination from the bottom; the ring electrode
10 Equation (4.33) holds when αWp is small, since photocurrent generation in the top layer is explicitly
neglected.

is then substituted by a circular electrode. In this case, for reasons related to the car-
rier speed and resulting transit time limited bandwidth, the preferred epitaxial structure
would be with n+ surface layer and p+ bottom layer.
A guard ring, see Fig. 4.35, can be put around the pn junction to prevent breakdown
due to the high ﬁeld generated at the edge of the diffused region and reduce the device
junction capacitance; however, this solution is more common in avalanche photodiodes
due to the potentially high operating voltages and ﬁelds.
4.9
The pin frequency response
Four main mechanisms limit the speed of pin photodiodes under dynamic excitation:
1. the effect of the total diode capacitance, including the depleted region diode
capacitance and any other external parasitic capacitance;
2. the transit time of the carriers drifting across the depletion layer of width W;

190
Detectors
3. the diffusion time of carriers generated outside the undepleted regions (mainly in
homojunction devices);
4. the charge trapping at heterojunctions (in heterojunction devices).
Transit time effects are negligible in pn junction photodiodes owing to the small
depletion region width, but become a dominant mechanism in pin devices. Transit time
and RC cutoff are thus the main limitations in practical, technology-optimized pin
photodiodes.
4.9.1
Carrier diffusion and heterojunction charge trapping
Photogenerated carrier diffusion in the cladding layers introduces into the device
response a slow component, already discussed in the treatment of the pn junction diode.
In pin devices, such a component is potentially marginal due to the large value of W,
but can be detected as a slow time constant in the time response; see Fig. 4.21. The
diffusion current component can be minimized in homojunction devices by cladding
the intrinsic layer between heavily doped layers; in this case, the carrier mobility μ
decreases owing to strong impurity scattering and the diffusivity D decreases (remem-
ber D/μ = kBT/q). Addition of recombination centers leads at the same time to a
decrease in the carrier lifetime τ, ﬁnally implying a decrease in the diffusion length
L =
√
Dτ (remember that the diffusion component depends on αL; see (4.33)). In
compound semiconductor devices, making the top and/or bottom layers from a widegap
material ultimately prevents absorption in the cladding layers.
Heterojunction pin detectors can be affected by charge trapping at heterojunctions,
related to the valence and/or conduction band discontinuities introduced there. Con-
sider, for instance, an InP/InGaAs/InP Pi N photodiode, in which the active region is
the ternary InGaAs layer. Charge trapping can be minimized by not letting the two junc-
tions between doped and intrinsic materials (in particular the surface junction) coincide
with the heterojunctions. In this way, for example, the Pi junction becomes a Ppi
junction, where the homojunction and heterojunction are very close to the top window
layer. From a technological standpoint, this can be obtained by diffusion of a p-type
dopant into the intrinsic layer. Another possible technique, less common in practical

devices, is inserting a thin quaternary layer or a superlattice graded bandgap layer at the
hetero-interface. Another point to be considered is the need to remove the pi junction
from the surface of the device, in order to avoid surface trapping effects; this can be
obtained in mesa-type structures also by keeping the junction entirely inside the device
volume.
4.9.2
Dynamic pin model and space-charge effects
In order to analyze the dynamics of the electrons and holes photogenerated in the intrin-
sic region, let us consider a time-domain model including the 1D continuity equations
for electrons and holes:
∂p
∂t = −p −p0
τb
+ Gop(x, t) −1
q
∂Jh
∂x
(4.36)
∂n
∂t = −n −n0
τb
+ Gop(x, t) + 1
q
∂Jn

(4.37)
τb is the excess carrier lifetime, p0 and n0 are the equilibrium carrier densities, and the
electron and hole current densities are
Jh = qvh (E) p −q Dh
∂p
∂x
Jn = qvn (E) n + q Dn
∂n
∂x ,
where vn and vh are the ﬁeld-dependent electron and hole drift velocities. The above
equation must be then coupled to the Poisson equation:
∂E
∂x = ρ
ϵs
,
where ρ is the total charge density (evaluated neglecting the background doping in the
intrinsic region, i.e., as ρ = qp −qn).
In the intrinsic region, photogenerated carriers, under the effect of the electric ﬁeld
induced by the applied bias, assume opposite drift velocities, so that electrons and
holes separate. Since their drift velocities are in principle different in absolute value,
some charge imbalance arises, which in turn perturbs (screens) the driving electric
ﬁeld.
We will assume that such space charge effects are negligible, i.e., that the driving
electric ﬁeld is the external ﬁeld only, and that all diffusion currents are negligible.
Among diffusion currents we also include those in the depletion region; in low-ﬁeld
conditions one has (e.g., for holes):
Jh = qvh (E) p −q Dh

where we have assumed that the injected charge in the intrinsic region is approxi-

192
Detectors
contribution is negligible when |VA| ≫kBT/q = 26 mV at ambient temperature, a con-
dition that is again typically met in practical devices. Moreover, we will also assume
that the transit time of drifting photogenerated carriers, τdr (deﬁned as the average time
photocarriers need to reach the external contact), is ≪τb, so that carriers cannot recom-
bine during their drift to the external circuit. Finally, the electric ﬁeld is assumed high
enough to saturate the carrier velocity (this approximately means E ≥10 kV/cm, i.e.,
E ≥1 V/μm for InGaAs, a condition that is easily obtained in practical devices where
W ≈μm).
Neglecting space charge effects is legitimate when the incident optical power is small;
increasing Pin inevitably leads to an increase of the space charge ρ in the intrin-
sic region; the external electric ﬁeld is screened by the space charge and becomes
nonuniform, thus decreasing the photocarrier driving force; eventually, the photocur-
rent saturates. To approximately evaluate the impact of the space charge effect, assume
that vn ≈vh ≈v or, in the low-ﬁeld approximation, μn ≈μh ≈μ; moreover, n ≈p;
it follows that
JL = Jh + Jn ≈qμhE0 p + qμnE0n ≈2qμE0n = 2qvn,
where E0 is the electric ﬁeld induced by the applied bias. The charge density |ρ| = qn =
qp associated with the electrons or holes is
|ρ| ≈
JL
2μE0
= JL
2v .
If we assume, somewhat inconsistently, that, due to the displacement of photogenerated
carriers, such a charge density also acts as an uncompensated density in the Poissons
equation, we have
∂E
∂x = ρ
ϵs
=
JL
2μϵsE0

where E is the extra ﬁeld induced by uncompensated space charge. Integrating over the
intrinsic layer (and assuming constant current density) we obtain
E =
JLW
2μϵsE0
= JLW
2ϵsv .
(4.38)
Therefore, the electric ﬁeld induced by the space charge E is negligible with respect to
the external ﬁeld E0 if (low-ﬁeld case):
E =
JLW
2μϵsE0
≪E0 →|E0| ≫

JLW
2μϵs
,
or if (velocity-saturation case):
E = JLW
2ϵsv ≪E0 →|E0| ≫JLW
2ϵsv .
The above criteria permit estimation of the photodetector saturation power.

4.9 The pin frequency response
193
Example 4.2: Consider an AlGaAs/GaAs pin photodiode with area A = 200 μm2. The
active region thickness is W = 2 μm, and the device responsivity is R = 0.5. Assuming
an applied reverse voltage of 4 V, a low-ﬁeld mobility μ = 3000 cm2V−1s−1 and a sat-
uration velocity v = 107 cm/s, evaluate the optical saturation power as the input power
for which the ﬁeld induced in the intrinsic region by the external voltage is E0 = 10E,
where E is given by (4.38). Assume ϵs = 13ϵ0.
An applied voltage of 4 V leads to an internal ﬁeld on the intrinsic GaAs layer:
E0 =
4
2 × 10−4 cm = 2 × 104 V/cm
corresponding to a theoretical low-ﬁeld velocity,
v = μE0 = 3000 · 2 × 104 = 6 × 107 cm/s ≫v.
Therefore we should use the expression for saturated velocity,
|E0| = 10 · JLW
2ϵsv = 10 · R4PinW

→4Pin = 2ϵsv |E0|

leading to an input optical power
Pin = A4Pin = 46.02 × 107 · 200 × 10−12 = 92 mW.
4.9.3
Transit time analysis and transit time-limited bandwidth
Let us go back to the pin photocurrent analysis; neglecting the diffusion currents, as
stated, and assuming constant electric ﬁeld. System (4.36), (4.37) becomes
∂p
∂t = Go(x, t) −1
q
∂Jh
∂x

(4.40)
where
Jh = qvh,sat p,
Jn = qvn,satn.
(4.41)
For simplicity, the coordinate system is chosen so that x = 0 corresponds to the p+i
junction, x = W to the in+ junction. Since the system is linear, we can assume
harmonic optical incident power at the modulation angular frequency ω,
pin(t) = Pin(ω)ejωt,
and work in the frequency domain. Substituting (4.41) in (4.39) and (4.40), we obtain

(4.43)
with boundary conditions p(W) = 0, n(0) = 0. In fact, in the reverse-bias p+i junction
(x = 0), the total minority (electron) carrier density is zero, and so is the minority (hole)
carrier density in the reverse bias in+ junction in x = W. Since the system is also linear
in x, we look for an exponential trial solution in the homogeneous associate (we start
from the hole equation)
jωp′(x) = −vh,sat
dp′(x)

(4.44)
under the form
p′(x) = Aejkx.
Substituting into (4.44), we obtain
jωAejkx = −vh,satk Aejkx →k = −jω
vh,sat
.
We now express the solution of the complete equation (4.42) as p1 + p2, where p2 is a
particular solution of (4.42).
We assume as a trial solution p2 = B exp(−αx), so that
p(x) = p1 + p2 = Ae

The expression of the pin frequency response is rather complex, and the cutoff fre-

Notice that f3dB,tr is the so-called transit time-limited cutoff frequency, which
depends, in this approximation, on the transit time of the minority carriers gener-
ated in the most illuminated part of the intrinsic region, i.e., close to the p+ surface
side; in the present case, such carriers are the electrons.
For a diode illuminated from the back (n+ side), one would have instead
f3dB,tr = 0.443vh,sat
W .
Since holes are slower than electrons, illumination should rather come from the p+
side to maximize the device speed.
Assuming, on the other hand, that both carriers have the same transit time we obtain
the approximate expression
f3dB,tr ≈
1
2.2τt
,
where τt is the electron or hole transit time.
• The diode is thin (αW ≪1); in this case, the generation of pairs along the i
layer is almost uniform and the frequency response is limited by both carriers; an
approximation of the cutoff frequency is given by [40]:
f3dB,tr = 3.5¯v

In practice, the difference between the thin and thick diode approaches may be slight
if the electron and hole saturation velocities are similar. Consider, for instance, the
example in Fig. 4.22, where the active region width is 1.5 μm and the absorption varies
from the thin to the thick diode condition; the transit-time cutoff frequency f3dB,tr, eval-
uated numerically from (4.48), undergoes a variation of 10% in the whole range, with a
maximum around αW = 2.
Independent of the kind of approximation made, the transit time-limited cutoff fre-
quency increases with decreasing W. In the example shown in Fig. 4.23, where α is
varied between 0.01 and 100 μm−1 and both the thin and the thick formulae are used,
together with the general expression for the response, we see that the cutoff frequency is
inversely proportional to W and almost independent of α. Values in excess of 100 GHz
can be obtained for very thin diodes, but in that case the responsivity will be very
low due to the low efﬁciency. Such a speed–efﬁciency trade-off will be discussed in
Section 4.9.5.

Bandwidth–efﬁciency trade-off
In a vertically illuminated photodiode, optimization of the external quantum efﬁciency
suggests W ≫Lα = 1/α ; moreover, the detection area A should be large in order to
improve coupling with the external source (e.g., an optical ﬁber). However, increasing
W increases the RC-limited bandwidth (since it decreases the junction capacitance) but
decreases the transit time-limited bandwidth. Increasing the device area has no inﬂuence
on the transit time-limited bandwidth but makes the capacitance larger and therefore
decreases the RC-limited bandwidth. Keeping the device area A constant, we therefore
have f3dB,RC ∝W but f3dB,tr ∝1/W. Since f3dB < min( f3dB,RC, f3dB,tr), the total
bandwidth is dominated by f3dB,RC ∝W (low W) or f3dB,tr ∝1/W (large W). The
total bandwidth then ﬁrst increases as a function of W, then decreases; f3dB therefore
has a maximum, which shifts toward smaller values of W and larger cutoff frequencies
with decreasing A. At the same time, the efﬁciency always increases with W. As a con-
sequence, high-frequency operation (high f3dB) requires small-area diodes, with small
W and increasingly poor efﬁciency.
An example of the trade-off between speed and efﬁciency is presented in Fig. 4.25,
showing the efﬁciency (we assume zero surface power reﬂectivity) and the bandwidth
of an InGaAs pin photodiode with circular illuminated area. Only the intrinsic junc-
tion capacitance is considered; in a real high-speed device as much as 50% of the total
capacitance may derive from parasitics. From Fig. 4.25, we see that 40 Gbps operation
requires diodes with diameter as low as 20 μm; the resulting efﬁciency is lower than

ties around 0.7–0.9 A/W and have active region thicknesses W < 1 μm. Devices with
top or bottom illumination are possible (bottom illumination allows increase in the
active device area, since this is not partly covered by a ring contact).

Advanced pin photodiodes
Although conventional (vertical) pin photodiodes can today achieve bandwidths well in
excess of 40 Gbps, such structures are close to the limit performances. Their main limi-
tation, i.e., the efﬁciency–bandwidth trade-off, can be overcome by properly modifying
the device design.
From a physical standpoint, the efﬁciency–bandwidth trade-off originates from the
fact that photons and photogenerated carriers run parallel. This implies that increasing
the thickness of the absorption layer (and, therefore, the efﬁciency) automatically leads
to an increase of the transit time. However, if the angle between the power ﬂux and the
collected photocarrier path is made larger than zero, the absorption region can be made
wider while preserving a low transit time. Alternatively, if photons are made to cross
the active region several times, absorption can be high even with a low value of the
photocarrier transit time.
The ﬁrst idea is implemented in the refracting facet photodetector (RFPD, Fig. 4.26,
inset) [41]. Using a refracting facet, the angle of the light crossing the active region, φ
(Fig. 4.26, inset), is decreased from the value π/2 (typical of a conventional structure),
and the efﬁciency can be optimized by increasing the length of the light path in the active
region. Photocarriers to be collected travel vertically, following a path shorter than that
of the photons. Moreover, photons are reﬂected by the top layer, thus doubling the

while the carrier transit time will of course be related to W. The improvement in the
efﬁciency vs. the angle θ following from (4.50) is shown in Fig. 4.26. In practice, the
RFPD operation is made more critical by the coupling of the light source (e.g., a ﬁber)
with a slanted surface; moreover, the efﬁciency is decreased by the ﬁnite reﬂectivity of
the top metal layer. In the above remarks, we have neglected the effect of refraction at
the heterojunctions.
In resonant cavity detectors, light is made to cross the absorption layer several times
by inserting such a layer in a vertical optical resonator conﬁned by front and back Bragg
reﬂectors (a grating obtained by stacking several semiconductor layers of low and high
refractive index, see Section 5.8.4). This solution increases the efﬁciency but, since the
cavity is resonant, the optical bandwidth is narrow.

Waveguide photodiodes
In waveguide photodiodes, the photon ﬂux and the photocarriers’ motion are
orthogonal. Light is guided by an optical waveguide made of an intrinsic narrow-
gap semiconductor layer, sandwiched between two highly doped widegap layers

(see Fig. 4.27). Applying a reverse bias voltage, photocarriers are collected by the doped
layers after a very short transit time (the waveguide height is typically d < 1 μm); as
the waveguide length can be designed so that W ≫Lα, the majority of photons are
absorbed, without affecting the transit time. Since the width a of the waveguide and
of the top electrode is a ≈2−5 μm, the capacitance is low, so that high-frequency
operation is not compromised by RC cutoff either. A disadvantage of the waveguide
approach is the fact that the optical ﬁeld is not completely conﬁned by the narrowgap
waveguide core, but partly extends into the widegap cladding, where absorption is neg-
ligible; the waveguide effective absorption is therefore a properly averaged value αeff =
ovα, where ov < 1 is the overlap integral and α is the core absorption. The overlap
integral is a relative measure of the optical ﬁeld energy within the absorbing part of the
optical waveguide, vs. the total energy:

where the absorption layer extends from z = 0 to z = d and Eop is the optical ﬁeld. The
same concept is exploited in laser modeling; see Section 5.5.1.
Denoting by d the active (absorption) region thickness, by a the junction width,
and by W the optical waveguide length (see Fig. 4.27), the photodiode external device

An example of waveguide photodiode structure is shown in Fig. 4.27. In practice, the
intrinsic bandwidth of such structures can be designed well in excess of 40 GHz, but it
is somewhat limited by parasitics; moreover, the total efﬁciency tends to decrease due to
coupling losses between the external medium (e.g., the optical ﬁber) and the waveguide.
Finally, such structures suffer from earlier power saturation with respect to conven-
tional photodiodes, due to the very small cross section. Lateral waveguiding is usually
obtained by including the active region in a ridge. A similar arrangement is exploited
in electroabsorption modulators, which basically are waveguide photodetectors with
variable absorption; see Section 6.8.
4.10.2
Traveling-wave photodetectors
The high-speed operation of waveguide photodiodes is mainly limited by RC cutoff;
further bandwidth improvements can be obtained by turning the RF electrodes into a
transmission line. This can be done by properly feeding the signal from one end of
the structure (see Fig. 4.28) and by loading the other end with a matched load; the
detector becomes a nonconventional coplanar waveguide, continuously loaded by the
pin reverse-biased capacitance. The resulting traveling-wave or distributed photode-
tector (TWP) is able, at least in theory, to overcome the RC limitations of the simple
lumped-parameter waveguide photodiode [42]. TWPs are also interesting as an exam-
ple of devices wherein the interaction between the optical and RF signal is distributed;
a similar principle will also be applied in distributed electrooptic and electroabsorption
modulators.
To simplify the treatment, suppose that the transmission line is terminated, at both
sides (generator and load), on the characteristic impedance. The distributed photodi-
ode extends from z = 0 to z = W (see Fig. 4.28, right); let us consider an inﬁnitesimal
slice of the photodiode between z and z + dz. Such a slice excites an inﬁnitesimal small-
signal current at t, proportional to the optical power that crosses at t section z. However,

the optical signal entering the photodiode at z = 0 crosses section z after a delay
t0 = z/vo, where vo is the phase velocity of the optical signal. Such a delay translates,
in the frequency domain, into a phase shift exp(−jωt0) = exp(−jωz/vo) = exp(−jβoz),
where βo = ω/vo (ω is the angular frequency of the optical signal modulation). There-
fore, the parallel photocurrent excited by light at section z, taking into account power
attenuation and phase shift, is

To further simplify the problem, let us suppose that the transmission line is lossless.

have, neglecting RF losses and introducing the source term related to the photocurrent,
dIL/dz:

where Z0 = √L/C (see (3.5)), is the line characteristic impedance. The DC bias gener-
ator connected at the input behaves as a short for the sinusoidal photocurrent generated
along the line. Taking into account the load (Z0 at both sides), the boundary conditions
(b.c.) in x = 0 and x = W are therefore
V (0) = −Z0I (0),
V (W) = Z0I (W);
Substituting into the b.c. set the expressions for V (z) (4.55) and I (z) (4.56) we obtain

which corresponds to one half of the conventional waveguide pin responsivity; see

a lumped one, but with two loads (that are in parallel in DC), so that half of the

An example of the frequency response (4.57) as a function of the normalized fre-
quency βW is shown in Fig. 4.29; note that the sinc behavior appears only for very
low values of ovαW (corresponding to low efﬁciency). Decreasing the velocity mis-
match leads of course to lower values of βW at a given frequency, i.e., to an increase
of the bandwidth.
For exact velocity matching, the bandwidth is (theoretically) inﬁnity, even though in
practice RF losses limit the bandwidth in the synchronous condition as well. The 3 dB

can play a role is of the order of only a few absorption lengths.
While the DC photocurrents on the generator and load impedances are equal, the

In fact, the interaction between the optical wave and the regressive RF wave entering the
load in x = 0 is always counterpropagating (i.e., the two wave velocities are opposite in
sign), and synchronous coupling is never achieved. In distributed photodiodes limited
by velocity mismatch, the load in z = W will draw the majority of the photocurrent;
this conclusion is not necessarily true, however, if the speed is limited by transit time.
In any case, matching the detector at both sides (generator and load) imposes a 50%
penalty on the efﬁciency (although it increases the detector bandwidth).
Example 4.3: Consider a photodetector of length W = 50 μm, active region thickness
d = 0.25 μm (permittivity ϵr = 13), width a = 4 μm. The waveguide absorption length
is Lovα = 30 μm. Assume for the RF velocity vm = 1.2 × 108 m/s, for the optical
velocity vo = 0.9 × 108 m/s; the photocarrier drift velocity is ¯v = 1 × 107 cm/s. The
characteristic impedance of the line is Z0 = 20  and the photodetector is matched at
both ends on Z0. Evaluate the detector bandwidth in concentrated and distributed forms,
taking also into account the effect of the carrier transit time. Evaluate the efﬁciency of
the distributed and waveguide detectors and compare with a conventional, vertically
illuminated detector.
Let us consider ﬁrst the transit time cutoff frequency. Since light is illuminating the
active region almost uniformly, the generation of e-h pairs along the i layer is approxi-
mately constant, and the frequency response is limited by both carriers; we can exploit
the expression for the transit-time limited bandwidth:
f3dB,tr = 3.5¯v
2πd =
3.5 · 1 × 105
2π · 0.25 × 10−6 = 223 GHz.
Concerning the bandwidth of the distributed detector, we have (we assume from the
data that the absorption region is long)
f3dB,d = ovα

2π · 30 × 10−6 · 0.9 × 108 · 1.2 × 108

using the same approach as in (4.49):
f −2
3dB ≈f −2

3dB,d.
(4.58)
We obtain f3dB = 221 GHz (distributed detector) and f3dB = 137 GHz (waveguide
detector). The total cutoff frequency for the photocurrent on the generator is instead
f3dB = 172 GHz. Although f ′
3dB,d ≪f3dB,d, at high frequency also the current on the
generator matched resistance is therefore far from being negligible. For the efﬁciency
we have, neglecting reﬂections and coupling loss and considering only the photocurrent
on the load:

In the vertical case we have considered the total photocurrent in both the generator
and the load. In conclusion, the efﬁciency of the distributed and waveguide detectors
is the same while the bandwidth of the distributed detector is almost twice that of the
waveguide device. In both cases the efﬁciency is much larger than for the vertical case.
4.10.3
Velocity-matched traveling-wave photodetectors
In practical implementations, the ideal version of the traveling-wave photodetector is
affected by heavy RF losses; moreover, obtaining velocity matching is critical. The RF
velocity depends in fact on the kind of quasi-TEM transmission line exploited in the dis-
tributed detector. While the optical refractive index is close to the active material index,
the microwave effective index can be lower (due to quasi-TEM averaging between the
air and the dielectric, see (4.59)) or, in some structures, much larger (and also strongly
frequency-dependent) because of the slow-wave effect; see Section 6.10.
To decrease RF losses, probably the most important limitation to high-speed opera-
tion, periodically loaded distributed detectors have been proposed; see an example in
Fig. 4.30, where the RF line is a quasi-TEM coplanar stripline (a TXL made of two par-
allel coplanar conductors, one acting as the ground plane) periodically loaded with pin
photodiodes. Owing to the wider RF conductors vs. the design in Fig. 4.28 (where the
signal conductor width is a few micrometers), the RF losses decrease dramatically and
the effective length of the detector can be increased. However, over such a long struc-
ture, velocity matching becomes an issue. In fact, while the RF permittivity in a bulk
semiconductor is larger than the optical permittivity, in the coplanar stripline exploited
for the design of Fig. 4.30 the RF effective index is typically lower than the optical
effective refractive index, due to the air–dielectric quasi-static averaging; see (4.59).
Assume that the optical permittivity is ϵo, and that the RF permittivity of the semicon-
ductor is ϵRF > ϵo. For a coplanar stripline, as for a coplanar waveguide, the effective
line permittivity is, from (3.32)

However, the coplanar stripline in Fig. 4.30 is periodically loaded with the (shunt)
lumped capacitances of the detectors. Such capacitances do not appreciably alter the
low-frequency current density pattern in the RF electrodes and the associated magnetic
ﬁeld distribution, since they behave as open circuits. The p.u.l. line inductance L is
therefore almost unchanged, and so is the in vacuo capacitance C0 ∝L−1 (3.27); at
the same time, the average p.u.l. capacitance is increased due to the capacitive loading
effect of the junctions. The effective permittivity of a uniform line of length W can be,
in fact, expressed as the ratio between the total capacitance and the capacitance in air,
the former including the shunt (junction) loading capacitance on the length W, C j:
ϵeff,l = CW + C j
C0W
= C
C0
+ C j
C0W = ϵeff + ϵl.
By properly selecting the amount of loading, the additional contribution ϵl can be cho-
sen so that ϵeff + ϵl = ϵo. In conclusion, capacitive loading decreases the RF velocity, so
that velocity matching can be obtained, by careful design, over a wide frequency range.
The resulting structure, called a velocity-matched traveling-wave detector (VMTWD)
[43] as opposed to the simple traveling-wave detector (TWD), can achieve bandwidths
well in excess of 100 GHz.

Uni-traveling carrier photodiodes
Uni-traveling carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs) are a high-speed evolution of conven-
tional, vertically illuminated pin photodiodes [44]. In the conventional pin, absorption
takes place in the intrinsic layer, where electrons and holes are generated. The tran-
sit time is negatively affected by the lower velocity of holes vs. electrons; moreover,
if the absorption layer thickness is reduced to improve the transit time, the efﬁciency

and the RC-limited bandwidth decrease. UTC-PDs overcome such limitations in two
ways. Firstly, photons are absorbed in a p layer where the ﬁeld is low, but holes are col-
lected by the p contact, while electrons quickly diffuse into an intrinsic or n−high-ﬁeld
drift region, where they undergo quasi-ballistic (i.e., not affected by scattering events)
motion to the collector. Due to the very thin absorption layer, the transit time depends
only on the electron drift through the intrinsic layer, while holes do not play a role;
however, due to quasi-ballistic motion, the electron transit time is low. Secondly, the
electron drift layer is thick enough to limit the diode capacitance, thus increasing the
RC-limited bandwidth.
Figure 4.31 shows the band diagram and layer structure of a long-wavelength UTC-
PD grown on a InP substrate. Note the InGaAsP electron barrier layer and the hole
barrier introduced by the InGaAs–InP valence band discontinuity. Typical absorption
layers are thin in order not to decrease the response speed due to diffusion in the
neutral absorption layer, with reported widths of the order of 100–200 nm, leading to
rather poor responsivities (around 0.15 mA/mW); backside illumination is exploited to
improve the photon collection and avoid photons being absorbed by the electron barrier
layer. UTC-PDs developed by NTT Photonics Labs have demonstrated record perfor-
mances for 1.55 μm detectors, with 3 dB bandwidth of 310 GHz [45]. The estimated
average electron velocity is of the order of 3 × 107 cm/s, thus demonstrating velocity
overshoot effects and quasi-ballistic transport in the drift region. With respect to dis-
tributed and waveguide photodetectors, UTC-PD have a much simpler, vertical structure
and comparable speed; typical responsivities are lower, however.

Avalanche photodiodes
Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) exploit the avalanche multiplication of photogenerated
carriers through impact ionization to amplify the detector current and improve the
device sensitivity. A larger photocurrent (for the same illumination level) is obtained

with respect to pin photodiodes, but also higher noise. In principle, the device includes
two regions: the generation region (low to medium electric ﬁeld) and the multiplica-
tion region (high ﬁeld). The two regions can be physically the same, as in conventional
APDs (see Fig. 4.32), or can be separated (SAM-APD: separate absorption and multi-
plication APD). In the APD shown in Fig. 4.33 the avalanche is triggered by electrons;
the dual case (avalanche triggered by holes) is also possible; see Fig. 4.34.
The structure of the conventional APD is a pin diode in reverse bias, with negligible
minority carrier diffusion currents at the edges of the depletion region, i.e., Jh(0) = 0
(n+ side) and Jn(W) = 0 (p+ side). The width of the avalanche and photogeneration
region is W ≡Wabs ≡Wav; see Fig. 4.32. As already mentioned, photocarrier genera-
tion takes place in a high-ﬁeld region, where, at the same time, avalanche multiplication
by impact ionization occurs.
In the SAM-APD the absorption region is intrinsic, and multiplication takes place
either in an n+ p junction at the device left-hand side, see Fig. 4.33, or in a np+ junction
at the device right-hand side, see Fig. 4.34. In the ﬁrst case (Fig. 4.33), the hole current

at the left-hand side depletion edge is negligible, Jh(0) = 0, while the electron current
at the beginning of the avalanche region is Jn(Wav) = Jpin, where Jpin is the primary
current photogenerated by the absorption region alone. In the second case (Fig. 4.34),
the electron current at the right-hand side depletion edge is negligible, Jn(Wav) = 0,
while the hole current at the beginning of the avalanche region is Jn(0) = Jpin, where
Jpin is the primary current photogenerated by the absorption region alone.
Although the device analysis shows that the responsivity increases with increasing
avalanche multiplication, which is, in turn, larger if the hole and electron ionization
coefﬁcients are similar (i.e., if both carriers contribute to the avalanche process), large
values of the multiplication factor are inconvenient because they increase noise and
decrease speed. Optimum noise and speed are achieved when the avalanche process
is almost unipolar: this happens when the ionization coefﬁcient of the avalanche-
triggering carrier is much larger than the ionization coefﬁcient of the other carrier.
For some materials, this condition is met naturally; it can be artiﬁcially introduced
through bandstructure engineering and the use of superlattices. From the technolog-
ical standpoint, early APDs were Si- or Ge-based homojunction devices, with large
operating voltages (e.g., in excess of 50 V). Today, InP-based long-wavelength APDs
are available, and also the operating APD voltage has considerably decreased, thanks
to device downsizing. Examples of APD structures are shown in Fig. 4.35; note the
guard ring introduced into the junction. The structure is typically vertical (top or bottom
illuminated), although waveguide APDs also have been proposed.
4.11.1
Analysis of APD responsivity
In order to evaluate the APD responsivity, we ﬁrst consider the avalanche process in a
region of width W, in which no photogeneration is present. Avalanche may originate
from hole injection in x = 0 or electron injection in x = W; the result is exploited to
analyze the two SAM-APD cases. The analysis of the conventional SAM (less impor-
tant, since the structure does not allow the absorption and avalanche regions to be
independently optimized and moreover, as discussed later, it exhibits larger noise) is

carried out assuming that photogeneration is present in the avalanche region, but no
carrier injection in x = W and x = 0.
Let us ﬁrst consider a DC stationary condition, in which avalanche generation is
triggered, in a region of length W and electric ﬁeld E(x), by the injection of a hole
current in x = 0 and an electron current in x = W (i.e., the avalanche region extends
from 0 to W).
From the electron and hole continuity equations, and neglecting all generation and
recombination phenomena apart from avalanche multiplication, we have
dJn
dx = −αh Jh −αn Jn
(4.60)
dJh
dx = αh Jh + αn Jn.
(4.61)
For large electric ﬁelds, carrier currents are mainly drift currents, not diffusion currents.
In this case, the electron and hole currents have the same sign, and (4.60) and (4.61)
imply that Jh increases with increasing x (from left to right) while Jn increases with
decreasing x (from right to left).
Taking into account that the current density J = Jn(x) + Jh(x) is constant vs. x, we
can derive a single equation, for example, in the hole current density. Eliminating the
electron current density from (4.60), we obtain
dJh
dx −(αh −αn)Jh = αn J.
(4.62)
As boundary conditions for system (4.60) and (4.61), we assign a hole current incident
from 0−, Jh(0), and an electron current incident from W +, Jn(W). To solve (4.62),
we actually only need the ﬁrst boundary condition (as appropriate for a ﬁrst-order
equation).
Since αn and αh are generally functions of x in the presence of a nonuniform electric
ﬁeld, (4.62) is a ﬁrst-order linear equation with variable coefﬁcients of the kind

From (4.65) we see that, in the presence of a ﬁnite injected electron or hole current,
the total current becomes larger (if Mh, Mn > 1), and can diverge due to the carrier
avalanche generation. The condition J →∞corresponds to D →0 in (4.65); however,

The divergence condition can be equivalently formulated as In,ion = 1 or Ih,ion = 1;
however, In,ion is more appropriate to describe electron injection from x = W. If one of
the two injected currents vanishes, we say that the avalanche multiplication is triggered
by holes (Jh(0) ̸= 0, Jn(W) = 0) or triggered by electrons (Jh(0) = 0, Jn(W) ̸= 0).
We consider now some simplifying cases. If the two avalanche ionization coefﬁcients
are equal (αn = αh), the ionization integrals become

so that the avalanche condition is simply

(4.70)
Condition αn ≈αh is approximately veriﬁed in some compound semiconductors, while
in Si the ionization rates are signiﬁcantly different. In many cases we can approximately
assume that the avalanche ionization coefﬁcients are different but constant over the
avalanche region. In this case, the ionization integrals simplify as follows:

4.11 Avalanche photodiodes

We now apply the above approach to the analysis of the conventional APDs and
SAM-APDs. For the electron-triggered SAM-APD shown in Fig. 4.33, we set Jh(0) = 0
in (4.65), and thus J = Mn Jpin, where Jpin = Jn(W); thus, the equivalent pin current
in multiplied by a factor Mn > 1,12 so that the APD responsivity will be

,
where Rpin is the responsivity of the equivalent pin.
For the hole-triggered SAM-APD shown in Fig. 4.34, we set Jn(W) = 0 in (4.65),
and thus J = Mh Jpin, where Jpin = Jh(0); thus, the equivalent pin current is multi-
plied by a factor Mh > 1, so that the APD responsivity will be

SAM-APD = MhRpin = Mh
qηQ

.
With respect to the pin, the avalanche photodiode is therefore characterized by a larger
responsivity, possibly larger than the ideal, material-dependent, value deﬁned in (4.9).
To model the conventional APD, see Fig. 4.32, we now ﬁnally consider the case where
in the avalanche region photogeneration occurs, while there is no current injection in
x = 0 and x = W. For simplicity, we assume that the optical generation rate is uniform;
the resulting multiplication factor Mo will however be exploited (as an approximation),
see (4.80), also in cases where the W > Lα and therefore the equivalent pin response
is described by (4.35). Introducing the optical generation in (4.60) and (4.61),
dJn
dx = −αh Jh −αn Jn −qGo
(4.74)
dJh

(4.75)
we have, accounting for the constant total current,
dJh
dx −(αh −αn)Jh = αn J + qGo.
(4.76)
As boundary conditions, we have Jh(0) = 0 and Jn(W) = 0. From the linear equation
template (4.63), we identify b(x) = αn J + qGo, thus obtaining the solution:

(4.79)
In the conventional APD, the equivalent pin responsivity is therefore multiplied by
Mo > 1:
RAPD = MoRpin.
(4.80)
Thus, in both the conventional APD and the SAM-APD the responsivity is enhanced due
to the effect of avalanche multiplication. From a technological standpoint, the SAM-
APD allows for separate optimization of the avalanche region and of the absorption
region, while in the conventional APD the high-ﬁeld avalanche region width should be
W > Lα; as a result, the APD voltage may be very large, unless compound semicon-
ductors are used. The separate optimization of the avalanche region thickness and of
the absorption region length can be carried out in principle by exploiting waveguide
photodetector structures; see Section 4.14.
In all cases considered, the APD multiplication factor (Mn, Mh or Mo) increases with
increasing voltage; the resulting V–I characteristics are shown in Fig. 4.36, which can
also be ﬁtted by assuming for the multiplication factor (Mo, Mn or Mh) the empirical
expression

To compare, from the standpoint of the avalanche multiplication effectiveness, the
conventional APD and the SAM-APD with electron injection, we plot the multiplication
factors Mo and Mn as a function of the product αnW; see Fig. 4.37. The behavior of the
multiplication factors is similar, although, for khn = 0, Mn > Mh. In fact, in this case
one has
Mn = eαnW > Mo = eαnW −1
αnW
,
while for khn = 1,
Mo =
1
1 −αnW = Mn.
From Fig. 4.37 we see that for khn ≤1 the electron-triggered SAM-APD multiplication
factor is generally larger than for the conventional APD. From a physical standpoint this

220
Detectors
is because in the SAM-APD the whole primary photocurrent (from the most effective
avalanching carrier, the electrons) is injected entirely at the edges of the avalanche
region, while in the conventional APD the photocurrent injection takes place only grad-
ually within the avalanche region (also acting as the absorption region). To optimize the
multiplication factor in a SAM-APD the avalanche triggering (injected) carrier should
be in principle the one with the larger ionization coefﬁcient. If, on the other hand,
khn = 1, we have Mo = Mh = Mn, i.e., all structures are equivalent concerning the
multiplication factor.
4.12
Noise in APDs and pins
The short-circuit current ﬂuctuation spectrum of a pin diode can, as already remarked,
be modeled as shot noise according to (4.11). Neglecting the dark current, we have that
the power spectrum of the noise current in (see Fig. 4.14) can be expressed as
Sin,pin = 2qIL = 2qRpin Pin.
Taking into account that in the APD the (primary) photocurrent generated by the
equivalent pin is multiplied by M = Mn, Mh or Mo:
iL,APD = MiL,pin,
we would expect ﬂuctuations to be ampliﬁed according to the same law. Since the power
spectrum of the process y = Ax is Sy = |A|2 Sx, this would imply the power spectrum
of the APD current ﬂuctuations to be Sin,APD = M2Sin,pin. Unfortunately, the avalanche
multiplication of carriers generates additional noise with respect to the simple multipli-
cation of the shot noise associated with the primary photocurrent. We can therefore
write
Sin,APD = M2FSin,pin = 2qM2FRpin Pin = 2qM FRAPDPin,
where F = F(M) > 1 is the excess noise factor. The evaluation of the excess noise
factors in the conventional and SAM-APD cases is carried out in detail below in
Section 4.12.1;13 we here summarize the main results and discuss the noise behavior
vs. the material parameters, in particular the ratio khn (4.73) and knh = 1/khn.
The short-circuit noise currents for the three cases (conventional APD, SAM-APD
electron or hole triggered), neglecting the dark current, can be expressed as follows. For
the APD we have
So
δi = 2qIL MoFo(Mo)
(4.81)
13 We follow the classical approach of McIntyre [46]. The resulting analysis is quasi-static, i.e., it assumes
that carriers injected in a high-ﬁeld region immediately ionize according to the local ﬁeld; this approxima-
tion is inaccurate when considering extremely thin avalanche regions, (see, e.g., [47]), where the presence
of a dead space becomes signiﬁcant.

A comparison of the different APD solutions from the standpoint of noise shows that
the excess noise factor increases if the electrons and holes have similar ionization coef-
ﬁcients. Let us concentrate on the electron-triggered avalanche case; for khn = 0, the
excess noise factor is minimum, while it increases for increasing khn and for increas-
ing Mn; see Fig. 4.38. Concerning the conventional APD case, the behavior is similar,
though the excess noise factor Fo tends to be larger, with the same multiplication factor,
than the excess noise factor Fn. In general, for low values of khn, the SAM-APD is able
to reach low values of the excess noise factor independent of gain, while this is not the
case for conventional APDs; see Fig. 4.39, where the Fo and Fn are plotted together as
a function of αnW. The larger excess noise factor Fo for low khn is evident.
SAM-APDs therefore, beside allowing to optimize the width of the absorption region
so that Wabs > Lα without requiring unrealistically large driving voltages, are also
potentially less noisy than conventional APDs; moreover, in SAM-APDs the avalanche
region can be implemented with a larger gap material.
Concerning materials for APDs, the suitability of compound semiconductors for
which khn ≈1 should be discussed. Asymptotic high-ﬁeld values for GaAs are αn =
1.9 × 105 cm−1, αh = 2.22 × 105 cm−1, making the ratio close to one; GaAs and also
AlGaAs therefore are not particularly well suited to APD development. In0.53Ga0.47As
has the asymptotic values of αn = 2.27 × 106 cm−1, αh = 3.95 × 106 cm−1; this would
suggest that for very high ﬁeld, hole injection devices are a more convenient choice.

Independent of the material, however, low-voltage operation leads to low multiplication
factor, but also to low excess noise.
4.12.1
Analysis of APD noise
Estimating the excess noise factor requires a microscopic-level analysis. We start
by remarking that both optical and avalanche generation lead to ﬂuctuations in the
carrier population, and therefore in the current density. Fluctuations originating in

4.12 Noise in APDs and pins

section x of the avalanche photodetector are propagated to the external circuit through
a multiplication process, leading to their ampliﬁcation. We ﬁrst have to characterize the
local ﬂuctuations from a statistical standpoint and, then to evaluate their propagation to
the overall device current ﬂuctuations.
Consider, ﬁrst, the statistical characterization of ﬂuctuations in section x. From the
hole continuity equation we have, introducing ﬂuctuations as random source terms
according to the Langevin approach (see Section 5.13)
dJh
dx = αh Jh + αn Jn + qGo + γh + γn + γo,
where γh, γn, γo are zero average random processes that express the ﬂuctuations in
the avalanche generation of holes and electrons, and in the optical generation, respec-
tively. Since the total current is constant, the electron current continuity equation does
not add independent information, also considering that the noise source terms corre-
spond to direct (interband) process, and that, as a consequence, population ﬂuctuations
in the conduction and valence bands are fully correlated (i.e., the same ﬂuctuation source
appears in both continuity equations). Note that we have here made an approximation
in neglecting the time dynamics of the avalanche process; since the microscopic noise
sources are modeled by a white process, the resulting current ﬂuctuations will also be
white.
To model the second-order statistical properties of γh, γn, γo, we assume that
(particle) generation and recombination can be described by a Poissonian process
x(t) = X + δx(t) in the particle number, where X is the average value and δx(t) the
zero-average ﬂuctuation; the related (charge) GR process will be qx(t). The power spec-
trum of (particle) number ﬂuctuations δx(t) will follow the Campbell theorem, i.e.,
Sδx = 2X. More speciﬁcally, consider now that ﬂuctuations γh, γn, γo in the generation
rate refer to generated charge per unit time and volume; the corresponding (average)
particle generation rates are (αh Jh) /q, (αn Jn) /q, (qGo) /q, respectively. Since the
power spectrum of qδx(t) is q2Sδx, we have14

where the Dirac delta δ(x −x′) accounts for spatial uncorrelation of the noise sources
in points x and x′, and Kγi denotes the local noise source.
Since the continuity equations are linear (also with respect to forcing terms and
boundary conditions), we can exploit superposition and analyze a template continuity
equation pair of the kind
dJh

(4.93)
dJn
dx = −αh Jh −αn Jn −γ,
(4.94)
where γ is a unit amplitude impulsive source located in x′, γ (x) = δ(x −x′), and
there is no injection at the region ends (Jh(0) = Jn(W) = 0). The two equations are
not independent, since the total current is constant; however, introducing the electron
continuity equation makes it easier to impose the boundary conditions. Thus, impos-
ing constant total current J and with boundary conditions Jh(0) = Jn(W) = 0 and
assuming γ (x) = δ(x −x′), we have the set
dJh(x, x′)
dx
= (αh −αn) Jh(x, x′) + αn J + δ(x −x′)
(4.95)
dJn(x, x′)

= (αh −αn) Jn(x, x′) −αh J −δ(x −x′).

Integrating (4.95) from x′−to x′+ we obtain a jump condition for the hole current
density that will be exploited further on:
 x′+

dJh(x, x′)
dx
= Jh(x′+, x′) −Jh(x′−, x′) = 1.
(4.97)
We can now solve (4.95) and (4.96) for x ̸= x′ (i.e., an equation without the impulsive
forcing term) according to the approach already developed in Section 4.11.1.
Let us split the domain into two parts, x < x′ and x > x′; for x < x′ solution of

4.12 Noise in APDs and pins

The impulsive term in (4.93) and (4.94) causes a variation of the total current density J;
since J is constant, such a variation will be position-independent. Let us denote the total
current density induced by a unit source in x = x′ as J ≡M(x′); this, in fact, coincides
with the multiplication factor already discussed in the APD responsivity analysis.16
To simplify the treatment, from now on we will assume that ionization coefﬁcients
are constant. In this case, the expressions of the hole current density in (4.98) and (4.99)
reduce to

From the jump condition (4.97) we can now derive the value of the total current density
ﬂuctuation J ≡M(x′) induced by an unit impulsive current density source in x = x′:
M(x′) = (αn −αh) e(αn−αh)x′
αn −αhe(αn−αh)W
= (1 −khn) eαn(1−khn)x′
1 −khneαn(1−khn)W .
(4.100)
For electron injection in W or hole injection in 0, M(x′) reduces to the already
introduced electron and hole multiplication factors deﬁned in (4.71) and (4.72), i.e.,
M(W) = Mn, M(0) = Mh.
We now evaluate the output current ﬂuctuations as a function of the local noise source

will be

(4.101)
We now apply (4.101) separately to discuss three cases: the conventional APD, the
SAM-APD with electron-triggered avalanche, and the SAM-APD with hole-triggered
avalanche.
16 From the dimensional standpoint, a δ source in the continuity equation has the value of 1 A m2 m−1; since
the resulting induced current variation will be M · 1 A/m2, M is actually adimensional.

In the conventional APD, both avalanche and optical generation take place in the
absorption region; in this case one has, exploiting (4.101) and superposition:

In the electron-triggered SAM-APD there is no optical generation in the multiplica-
tion region, only avalanche generation; however, there is injection of a noisy primary
photocurrent from the absorption region. This corresponds to an equivalent generation
noise source in x = W, such as

In the SAM-APD with hole-triggered avalanche, as in the dual electron-triggered
case, there is no optical generation contributing to noise, only avalanche, and injec-
tion of a noisy hole current in x = 0; this corresponds to an equivalent generation noise
source in x = 0 such as

The APD frequency response
Let us consider for simplicity a SAM-APD with electron-triggered avalanche, absorp-
tion region width Wabs, avalanche region width Wav. We assume with this structure
khn ≤1. The frequency response can be approximately expressed in terms of the delay

4.13 The APD frequency response
229
that carriers undergo before being collected. Such delays are related to several factors
(note that we mention only intrinsic effects, leaving extrinsic RC-cutoff to a circuit-level
analysis):18
• The electron transit time in the absorption region:
τtr = Wabs/vn,sat.
• The avalanche buildup time (or avalanche delay), which can be expressed as
τA ≈r (khn) MnWavkhn
ve
,
(4.104)
where r (khn) is a slowly varying function of khn such as r (1) = 1/6, r(0) = 1, and
ve is an effective velocity deﬁned as
ve =
vn,satvh,sat
vn,sat + vh,sat
.
Expression (4.104) is actually valid if Mnkhn > 1, see [48], [49], [50].
• The transit time of avalanche-generated holes:
τtr,Ah = Wabs + Wav
vh,sat
.
From the above partial delays, we can approximately derive the total delay of a SAM-
APD as
τ = τtr + τA + τtr,Ah = Wabs
vn,sat
+ MnWavkhn
vn,sat
+ Wabs + Wav
vh,sat
implying that the total delay is minimized if khn ≪1, i.e., if the ionization coefﬁcient of
the avalanche triggering carrier is much larger than the ionization coefﬁcient of the other
carrier. On this basis, the intrinsic cutoff frequency can be approximately expressed as
fT ≈
1
2.2τ .
Due to the additional delay mechanisms, the APD is typically slower than the pin;
moreover, the device response is faster when only the avalanche triggering carriers (e.g.,
electrons) ionize. In fact, if both electrons and holes have the same ionization probabil-
ity, an electron pulse injected into the high-ﬁeld region generates holes which, instead of
simply being collected in the p-side, in turn generate secondary electrons, whose delay
before collection is of course larger than the delay of the electrons directly generated
by the initial pulse. Secondary electrons generate new holes, and so on; if the multipli-
cation factor is ﬁnite, the process ﬁnally dies out with a slow tail. As a result, a larger
number of carriers is collected with respect to the khn = 0 case (and, indeed the multi-
plication factor is larger), but such carriers will be collected over a longer time interval,
18 The analysis of the APD avalanche region frequency response is straightforward but lengthy, and the
formulae presented are just an approximation of a transit time-like cutoff. For a complete discussion see
[48], [49], [50].

leading to an output current pulse with a large spread in time. This ﬁnally amounts to a
slower response.

Advanced APD structures
Due to internal gain, APDs are able to reach spectacular efﬁciencies; however, the addi-
tional delay introduced by the avalanche process typically leads, at least in conventional
(vertically illuminated) APDs, to lower cutoff frequency vs. pin photodiodes. The APD
speed can be improved by applying some of the solutions already investigated in the
development of high-speed pins, namely, the use of resonant structures [51], [52] and
of waveguide photodiodes [53], [54]. In both cases, the absorption layer can be made
thinner with respect to vertically illuminated structures, thus reducing the transit time
and globally improving the device speed (which, however, remains inferior to that of
the equivalent pin).
In [51] a resonant-cavity AlGaAs–GaAs–InGaAs SAM-APD (RCAPD) is presented
with a peak ηx = 80%, achieved with a 35 nm thick In0.1Ga0.9As absorption region;
the low-gain bandwidth was 20 GHz; operation is in the ﬁrst window. An optimized
RCAPD structure developed by the same research group is presented in [52]. The struc-
ture has a number of additional layers besides the thin (35 nm) In0.1Ga0.9As absorption
layer and the 80 nm Al0.2Ga0.8As undoped avalanche layer, to improve the ﬁeld pro-
ﬁle (see Fig. 4.40(a)); bottom reﬂection is provided by a λ/4 AlGaAs/GaAs 20-layer
stack, while the top reﬂector is a p+ Al0.2Ga0.8As layer grown to a suitable thick-
ness to make the cavity resonant at the desired wavelength (not explicitly speciﬁed,
but around 0.8 μm). The measured 3 dB bandwidth in the low-gain regime (multipli-
cation factor down to 2, achieved with a reverse bias around 10 V) is 33 GHz, while

the gain–bandwidth product in the high-gain regime is 290 GHz. The resulting external
quantum efﬁciency in the low-gain, high-speed regime is not speciﬁed.
Waveguide avalanche photodiodes (WAPD) can be obtained both in conventional and
in the SAM version. In conventional WAPDs photons are injected in the absorption
region, which also operates as the avalanche multiplication region, parallel to the junc-
tion plane. High efﬁciency can therefore be obtained, as in waveguide pins, without
increasing the photogenerated and multiplied carriers’ transit time. Better results can
be obtained in SAM-WAPDs, where the waveguide absorption layer is followed by
an avalanche layer. A long-wavelength (1.55 μm) SAM-WAPD was proposed in [53],
exploiting a 200 nm InGaAs absorption layer sandwiched between two 100 nm InAl-
GaAs guiding layers (the waveguide) and an external 150 nm InGaAs avalanche layer
lattice-matched to the InP substrate. The detector is built on a mesa structure with length
10–100 μm. The low-gain bandwidth was reported as 28 GHz, with a maximum exter-
nal quantum efﬁciency of 16% and a maximum gain–bandwidth product of 320 GHz.
However, the maximum ηx was not in fact achieved with the high-bandwidth device,
for which coupling losses reduced the efﬁciency down to 5%.
More recently, an InAlAs/InGaAs WAPD was presented in [54], see Fig. 4.40(b);
the waveguide structure consists of an InAlAs/InGaAs core region sandwiched between
upper p+ and a lower n+ InAlGaAs guiding layers. The InGaAs absorption layer is
500 nm thick and is separated from the 100 nm thick InAlAs multiplication layer by
a 20 nm InAlAs ﬁeld buffer layer (intended to improve the RF ﬁeld distribution). The
overall thickness of the optical guiding layers is 700 nm and was designed to improve
the multimode coupling efﬁciency. The waveguide mesa was 6 μm wide and 20 μm
long. The measured low-gain detector bandwidth was 35 GHz with responsivities in the
range 0.73–0.88 A/W at 1.3 μm and 1.55 μm, respectively, corresponding to external
efﬁciencies around 70% in both cases; the overall receiver sensitivity (the receiver also
included a transimpedance front-end ampliﬁer) was −19 dBm at 40 Gbps.
In conclusion, high-speed APDs still exhibit frequency responses that are not com-
parable with fast pins; however, the gain–bandwidth products obtained are promising
and further optimization could make APDs the devices of choice also above 10 Gbps.

Concluding remarks on high-speed PDs
Standard high-speed photodetectors are vertically illuminated structures whose perfor-
mances are limited by the bandwidth–efﬁciency product: high speed is obtained at
the expense of reduced responsivity. In waveguide photodetectors the speed and efﬁ-
ciency issues are decoupled, but the speed limitation in terms of RC and transit time
cutoff remains; efﬁciency can be high, though in practice coupling losses are critical
due to the small waveguide cross section, but cutoff frequencies of the order of 100
GHz can be obtained with proper design. To completely overcome the RC-cutoff lim-
itation, traveling-wave detectors have been proposed, in which the main limitation is
velocity mismatch; however, (vertical) transit time may also again become important
at extremely high speed. Due to the high losses and poor velocity match of simple

distributed detectors, periodically loaded distributed detectors have been developed to
further increase the speed. Such detectors also have the advantage of a larger absorption
volume and therefore of lower saturation power.
High-speed APDs are based on vertical geometries similar to those exploited in pins.
Despite being slower than pins of similar structure, during the last few years compound
semiconductor APDs have gained popularity for applications in the 10 Gbps range, due
to the better sensitivity when included in a receiver dominated by the front-end ampliﬁer
white noise (usually referred to as “front-end thermal noise”). Advanced waveguide
APDs have also been developed, with performances in the 40 Gbps range.
In Fig. 4.41 we show a few examples of the performances of high-speed detectors
[40]. VPD is the conventional vertically illuminated pin; WGD is the waveguide pho-
todetector; TWP the traveling-wave photodetector; RCE-PD is the resonant cavity enh-
anced photodetector; RFPD the reﬂecting-facet photodetector; WAPD the waveguide
APD. Two vertical APD examples are also shown for comparison. For some structures,
a multimode waveguide was exploited as a guiding device. Top results in terms of speed
are achieved by TWPs, with efﬁciencies of the order of 40%; however, both waveguide
detectors and VPDs (with a somewhat decreased efﬁciency) have comparable perfor-
mances. WAPDs show promising performances in terms of efﬁciency and speed. It may
be concluded that the real need for traveling-wave detectors is still to come in the appli-
cation ﬁeld, while waveguide detectors may be an asset for photonic integrated circuits
bringing together passive components based on waveguiding structures and detectors.

The photodiode front end
The (weak) photodetector output signal current can be converted into a voltage through
a load resistor and then ampliﬁed by a front-end preampliﬁer stage; in high-speed
receivers, conversion and ampliﬁcation are typically integrated in a transimpedance

Detectors
ampliﬁer (TIA) providing both power gain and current–voltage conversion. The usual
photodiode bias point is at negative voltage and negative current, to optimize linearity,
dynamic range and dark current. Detectors can be capacitively coupled to the load or
TIA front-end to suppress the dark current and other DC current components. Before
discussing some possible front-end choices, we consider the equivalent signal and noise
circuit exploited in the detector model.
4.16.1
Photodetector and front-end signal and noise model
A photodiode equivalent circuit has already been introduced, see Fig. 4.14. The internal
admittance is mainly reactive, due to the photodiode capacitance CD. The deterministic
current generator includes the photocurrent iL (in small-signal phasor form IL) and the
dark current Id (often neglected), while the random generator in models the current
ﬂuctuations. We will here conﬁne the treatment to the pin and APD cases.
As already discussed, the noise in pin detectors is intrinsic shot noise, plus some
thermal noise arising from parasitics that we will neglect for simplicity. One has,
therefore,
Sin,pin = 2q (IL + Id) .
In APD photodiodes, we have multiplied and excess shot noise; for the SAM-APD with
electron-triggered avalanche the noise current power spectrum is, from (4.84),
Sin,APD = 2qIAPDMn Fn
where the multiplication factor Mn and the excess noise factor Fn are reported in (4.85)
and (4.86). Similar expressions hold for the other cases.
The front-end ampliﬁer input can be modeled in turn as an impedance Zi; the front-
end noise can be approximately represented through a parallel current noise generator
according to the scheme in Fig. 4.14 where RL →Zi.
4.16.2
High- and low-impedance front ends
Let us initially consider a front end made of a load resistor with resistance Ri, connected
to a high-input-impedance voltage ampliﬁer. In such a case, we can approximate Zi =
Ri. Suppose, for simplicity, that the ampliﬁer noise is negligible and that only the load
resistor (thermal) noise is signiﬁcant. It can easily be shown that the choice of the load
resistance directly impacts on the receiver performance in terms of bandwidth, noise,
and input linear dynamic range.
In fact, high load resistance implies low noise but low bandwidth B; low input resis-
tance implies high bandwidth but also high noise. Concerning the input dynamic range
in which the device operates linearly, this is wide for low input resistance and narrow
for large input resistance.
To simplify the discussion, we will exploit a simple bias scheme in which the DC
bias resistance is the same as the signal resistance. The two resistances can actually be
decoupled by use of proper bias Ts (see Section 3.4.1).

High-impedance front-end ampliﬁer: load line (left) and stage simpliﬁed structure with equalizer
(right).
In low-impedance front ends (see Fig. 4.42) the load resistance Ri, and there-
fore the time constant RiCD, are small, leading to a wide RC-limited bandwidth
(remember that other, intrinsic, limitations to bandwidth exist, such as the transit
time). However, the Nyquist noise generated by the load is large, since it is pro-
portional to Gi = 1/Ri. As a result, this conﬁguration is rather noisy. However, the
large slope of the load line of the photodiode allows for a wide linear dynamic
range of input optical power (intrinsic saturation effects may also limit the receiver
dynamics).
In high-impedance front ends (see Fig. 4.43) the load resistance Ri is high, and there-
fore the time constant RiCD is large, leading to narrow RC-limited bandwidth. The
front-end stage may behave like an integrator, thus requiring an equalization stage to
be inserted after the ampliﬁer to reshape the waveform. The Nyquist noise generated
by the load is small, however, since it is proportional to Gi = 1/Ri. As a result, this
conﬁguration is slow, but has low noise. A further disadvantage is related to the small
slope of the load line, which leads to a limited linear dynamic range in the input optical
power.
The frequency response of the low- and high-input impedance stages can be ana-
lyzed from the equivalent circuit of Fig. 4.44, in which the high-impedance ampliﬁer
is modeled as an input capacitance and an output voltage-controlled voltage generator.

where ωTi = 2π fTi is the intrinsic PD cutoff frequency. The total PD cutoff (includ-

The extrinsic cutoff frequency usually dominates, leading to the behavior shown in
Fig. 4.45 for low- and high-input-impedance front ends, respectively. In the high-
impedance case, the ampliﬁer behaves like an integrator, and a derivative equalizing
block is needed in cascade to the ampliﬁer to restore the signal.
4.16.3
Transimpedance ampliﬁer front ends
A far better compromise between bandwidth, dynamics, and noise requirements is
achieved through the transimpedance ampliﬁer (TIA) front end. The purpose of the TIA
is to turn an input current into an output voltage; due to the input current drive, the input
impedance is typically low and the gain (the transimpedance Zm) has the dimension of
an impedance. TIAs can be implemented through voltage ampliﬁer stages with parallel
resistive feedback; see Fig. 4.46 (right). Let A be the open-loop voltage ampliﬁcation;
from the analysis, the TIA input impedance is

Ri ≈R f /A,
where R f is the feedback resistance. For large gain, the input resistance is low, yielding
high linear dynamic range and high bandwidth. However, the input noise resistance can
be shown to be equal to R f , thus yielding low parallel thermal noise (“cold resistance
stage”).19 Let us analyze ﬁrst the transimpedance cutoff frequency and response. From

19 The name “cold resistance” comes from the fact that the r.m.s. noise current can be expressed as
√4kBT Gn where Gn = 1/R f ; alternatively we can associate the noise current to the input conductance
Gin ≈A/R f but with a noise temperature Tn = T/A as √4kBTnGin . In this second case we can imag-
ine that the input conductance has low noise because its noise temperature is low (from which comes the
idea of “cold resistance”).

which is typically large owing to the ampliﬁcation factor. In conclusion, the trans-
impedance stage exhibits low input impedance and high extrinsic bandwidth, without
the trade-off required by high- or low-impedance stages.
To justify the noise properties of transimpedance stages, we evaluate the effect of the
noisy feedback resistor by computing the total noise voltage at the output and inter-
preting it as the result of an input noise generator inin (the “input referred current
noise generator”) to be compared to the input noise generators in the high- and low-
impedance cases. For simplicity, we assume that the ampliﬁer introduces no additional
noise due to active elements, though in fact this may be signiﬁcant, as discussed later,
(see Section 4.16.4).
In order to carry out the computation, we consider the circuit as excited by the noise
generator of R f , Inf (power spectrum 4kBT/R f ); the corresponding nodal equations
of the circuit in Fig. 4.48 (all other deterministic or noise current generators have been
disconnected, i.e., replaced by an open circuit) are

We have evaluated the input and output noise voltages induced by the feedback noise

but, taking into account (4.105), we obtain that the input generator coincides with the

i.e., the input noise generator has r.m.s. short-circuit current equal to

Thus, the noise input resistance is equal to the low-frequency input impedance Rin, mul-
tiplied by the ampliﬁcation A; in other words, the low input impedance is not obtained
at the price of a larger noise conductance.
4.16.4
High-speed transimpedance stages
In high-speed (high-frequency) transimpedance ampliﬁer (TIA) stages, noise from the
ampliﬁer active elements cannot be neglected with respect to feedback resistor noise.
We assume that the TIA noise can be referred to the input as a noise current generator
in parallel to the photodetector. This is just an approximation, since a complete input-
referred model can be shown to require two correlated series voltage and a parallel
current input generators, (see e.g. [36]); however, the series voltage generator is less
important due to the low input impedance of the stage, and will be neglected.
The power spectrum of the input-referred current noise generator in,T I A will be
shown to include an f 2 component, see (4.106), besides a 1/f (ﬂicker) component
which will be neglected in the analysis. The f 2 component can be attributed to the
drain or collector noise of the front-end ampliﬁer referred to the input.
To evaluate the power spectrum of in,T I A we shall separately take into account the
effect of the ampliﬁer and of the feedback resistor. We will consider a simple one-
stage FET ampliﬁer whose noise behavior is dominated by the drain (output) current
generator.
The FET equivalent circuit considered is shown in Fig. 4.49, where Ci is the gate–
source capacitance, and gmVin is the short-circuit drain current. Note that this form of
the TIA actually requires a ﬁnite load to operate as a transimpedance ampliﬁer, since
the output circuit is a current generator. The drain noise current generator inD has power
spectrum SiDniDn ≈4kBTgm P; see (3.56). We want now to identify the input genera-
tor in,T I A leading to the same short-circuit noise current as the output generator inD.
From Fig. 4.49(above), we have inout = inD while from Fig. 4.49(below), we obtain in
the frequency domain, considering only the input generator in,T I A and suppressing the
output generator inD,

Front-end SNR analysis and pin–APD comparison

FE = 4kBTgn B is the quadratic mean of the FE
input referred noise current. For PD noise, reference is made for the moment to a con-
ventional pin. For low input optical power, the photodiode noise is negligible and the
SNR is in the thermal noise limit, where it increases as the square of the optical power:
SNR ≈
R2P2
in
4kBTgn B .
On the other hand, at high input optical power, the FE noise becomes negligible and the
SNR is in the shot noise limit, where it depends only linearly on the optical power:

For extremely high Pin, the laser relative intensity noise (RIN) dominates. However,
most links work (in practice) in the thermal noise limit or, at best, near the onset of
the shot noise-limited regime.21 An example of the overall behavior of the link SNR is
shown in Fig. 4.51. For simplicity the laser RIN has been kept constant and independent
of the input power.
The receiver sensitivity S is the minimum input power (averaged between 0s and
1s for a digital link) required to yield, with a given detection scheme (e.g., intensity
modulation, direct detection: IM-DD), an SNR or bit error rate (BER) complying with

Comparing with the pin case, we have RAPD = Rpin Mn, i.e.,

Apparently, the APD sensitivity is always worse than the pin sensitivity since the
excess noise factor Fn (see Fig. 4.52) is always Fn > 1 (the lowest values are obtained
for khn →0). However, this result holds only if both detectors work in the shot noise
regime.
A more complete analysis shows that the APD may be superior if the detector is
working in a thermal noise-limited link.

Therefore, in the limit of a large multiplication factor the APD sensitivity ﬁnally
becomes worse than the pin sensitivity; again, the avalanche coefﬁcient ratio should
be kept as small as possible. Since, for intermediate values of the multiplication factor,
thermal noise prevails and the APD is increasingly better for increasing Mn, while for
extremely large values we are again in the shot noise limit, an optimum value of the
multiplication factor exists that yields the minimum value of the SAPD/Spin ratio. As
shown in Fig. 4.53, which was derived assuming a speciﬁc value for thermal noise (FE
noise equal to 100 times the pin noise for input power equal to the pin sensitivity), the
sensitivity ratio becomes < 1 (i.e., favorable to the APD) and exhibits a well-deﬁned
minimum that is deeper for low value of khn. Of course, the physical realization of
extremely low khn values may be difﬁcult.
In conclusion, the pin has better sensitivity than the APD in the shot noise limit; in
the thermal noise limit or in intermediate cases, APDs have better sensitivity, despite the
higher noise, due to the larger responsivity. A theoretical optimum value for the multipli-
cation rate exists, and more favorable conditions are reached anyway when decreasing
khn. Large multiplication factors should, however, be avoided because they may lead to
a reduction of the bandwidth.

An example is shown in Fig. 4.54, where the SNR of a link with APD and pin
receiver is plotted as a function of the input power. For low power (thermal noise limit)
the APD is superior, while for high power (shot noise limit) the pin ﬁnally prevails (i.e.,
has a larger SNR).
APD sensitivities are typically better than pin sensitivities, but the device is slower.
The choice may also be dictated by the application: the SNR required by digital vs.
analog systems (e.g., CATV, microwave photonics) systems is much lower (e.g., ≈17
dB vs. ≈40 dB), so that digital systems may work in the thermal noise limits with lower
SNR, while analog systems, which require higher SNR, may work at or near the shot
noise limit and therefore can better exploit pin devices.

Front-end examples
Several hybrid and OEIC (optoelectronic integrated circuit) TIA implementations have
been presented so far with different technologies (conventional bipolar transistors,
HBTs, FETs, HEMTs, PHEMTs, more recently MOS). Alternative solutions to the
front-end stage are the hybrid solution (photodiode externally connected to an integrated
TIA) and the OEIC solution where both the photodiode and the TIA are integrated on
the same chip. Moreover, the detector gain can be introduced, not only through APDs,
but also by amplifying the input optical signal through a SOA. Figure 4.55 reports the
performances of a number of detector-TIA receivers with different technologies appear-
ing mainly before 2000 [56]; see also [57], Table 1, 2 and 3, [58] and [59]. The ﬁgure

A few commercial TIA products are reported in [60], Table 5.2, with a single-ended
or differential topology. The products (which appeared before 2005) are listed according
to the speed (2.5, 10, and 40 Gbps). Technologies include for the 2.5 Gbps products Si
BJTs, SiGe HBTs, and GaAs MESFETs and HEMTs; at higher speed HBTs (SiGe
and GaAs) dominate, with some examples of GaAs HEMT. The r.m.s. noise current

GHz electrical bandwidth. More recently, both 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps
transceivers in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS 0.13 μm technology were presented
[61], showing that nanometer-scale NMOS devices can also play a role in high-speed
optical receivers.
Although the monolithic integration of a detector with the transimpedance ampli-
ﬁer appears to be a promising process, in practice this approach is fraught with a
number of technological problems – mainly compatibility between the electron and
optoelectronic device process ﬂow. An example of monolithic 40 Gbps InP-based
pin-HBT integration is shown in Fig. 4.56, with the layer breakdown shown in
Fig. 4.57 [56]. Note that the transistor collector layer is also exploited for the pin
active region. The HBT preampliﬁer includes a low-input-impedance common-base
stage, followed by a TIA closed on a common emitter buffer; two designs were imple-
mented, with bandwidth of 30 GHz or 50 GHz, respectively, with a gain difference of
about 7 dB.

An example of the InP-based layer structure of the 40 Gbps receiver stage, integrat-
ing a coplanar MIM (metal–insulator–metal) detector with an InAlAs–InGaAs PHEMT
front-end ampliﬁer, is shown in Fig. 4.58 [62]. Epitaxial regrowth was exploited in this
case to realize the MSM photodiode. The circuit layout is shown in Fig. 4.59.
More recently, monolithic integration of long-wavelength receivers explored all-Si
solutions, based on combining nanometer CMOS processes with Ge-based photodiodes
monolithically grown on a Si substrate. Germanium-on-Si photodetectors have been
demonstrated in the past, see [63], [38], and integration of a Ge detector with the already
mentioned 130 nm CMOS process was achieved [64] for a 10 Gbps transceiver, with a
sensitivity around −15 dBm. The all-Si transceiver implementation also requires that a
Si-based modulator be available.
In general, monolithic integration should introduce beneﬁts for high-speed receivers,

allows for bandwidth improvements. For applications below 10 Gbps, performance
advantages are probably low, but cost beneﬁts associated with large volume production
could be an asset of monolithic integration.

Hybrid and monolithic front-end solutions
Figure 4.60 shows the sensitivity vs. bit rate of a number of hybrid and integrated
receiver solutions. The hybrid, OEIC and APD best ﬁts are from [57], Fig. 3, and refer to
pre-1998 results; they suggest that hybrid receivers are superior to integrated receivers
for speeds lower than 10 Gbps, inferior for high speed; APD-based hybrid receivers
nevertheless, show sensitivities 10 dB better (typically) than pin based receivers. More
recent results reported in Fig. 4.60 point out that high-speed OEIC receivers may out-
perform the 1998 best ﬁt, but also that impressive results can be obtained through
photo-HBT based OEICs and APD hybrids. In [59] a 40 Gbps pin-MHEMT receiver

is implemented in both hybrid and monolithic form, and the OEIC implementation
is found to have a larger gain (7 dB) and a wider bandwidth (6 GHz), conﬁrming the
conclusions in [57] at least for speeds well in excess of 10 Gbps.
In concluding the comparison between the pin and the APD photodiode, we should
mention that other possible competitors to these solutions exist. Ampliﬁcation of the pri-
mary photocurrent can take place by an avalanche mechanism, but another possibility is
ampliﬁcation within a phototransistor. HBT-based phototransistors have shown promis-
ing performances in the laboratory in terms of speed, but of course such devices require
a compromise between transistor and photodetector active region design. A completely
different approach is to move ampliﬁcation from the electrical to the optical domain,
inserting an optical ampliﬁer (e.g., a SOA, semiconductor optical ampliﬁer) between the
ﬁber output and the pin input. The resulting solution can be competitive with respect to
the APD in terms of sensitivity.

Sources
5.1
Optical source choices
Two solid-state optical sources are currently available, the light-emitting diode (LED)
and the laser diode (LASER stands for light ampliﬁcation by the stimulated emis-
sion of radiation). LEDs have poor spectral purity and low speed under direct
modulation, and are therefore unsuited to long-haul or high-speed communication
systems.
Lasers, on the other hand, have at least one order of magnitude narrower linewidth
than LEDs and, under direct modulation, can reach bit rates in excess of 10 Gbps
(albeit with some deterioration of the spectral purity due to the spurious frequency
modulation or chirp associated with the amplitude modulation). Lasers are therefore
well suited for long-haul and high-speed applications, although indirect modulation
is required to achieve bit rates in excess of 10 Gbps over long distances (e.g., L >
10 km).
5.2
Light-emitting diodes
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are based on electron–hole (e-h) pair recombination in
a forward-biased pn junction or heterojunction, leading to spontaneous photon emis-
sion. Due to the emission mechanism, the LED output spectrum is comparatively broad
(with a total width at half power of the order of 1.8kBT ≈47 meV at ambient tem-
perature), or, in terms of wavelength, about 50 nm (or 500 Å) with respect to a central
wavelength around 1 μm. The spectral purity of LEDs is therefore low with respect to
lasers, whose linewidth is at least one order of magnitude narrower. At the same time,
the LED maximum modulation speed is of the order of 100 Mbps, about two orders
of magnitude slower than the laser direct modulation response. From the standpoint of
optical communication systems (operating in the near infrared), the LED is therefore
conﬁned to short-distance, low-speed links. However, a number of important applica-
tions exist for visible and also UV light LEDs, such as displays and lighting (automotive
and domestic). Developments in the latter area have been fostered by GaN-based blue-
light LEDs, which have in turn allowed for the development of white-light LED-based
sources.

Principle of homojunction (a) and heterojunction (b) LEDs.
5.2.1
LED structures
Homojunction LEDs exploit a directly biased pn junction. In forward bias, excess car-
rier populations are injected into the two junction sides; carriers recombine (radiatively
or nonradiatively) both in the two diffusion, low-ﬁeld, regions and in the space-charge
region; see Fig. 5.1(a). In the homojunction LED the emitted photons can, however, be
absorbed back by the material, since the photon energy is larger than the material gap.
As a consequence, photons emitted toward the substrate are mostly absorbed, while
those emitted toward the device upper surface can escape and be coupled to an exter-
nal medium (if they are not absorbed ﬁrst or reﬂected by the upper device surface). To
increase the device efﬁciency, therefore, photons must be mostly emitted near the sur-
face; this can be obtained by means of an asymmetric junction where the (thin) surface
layer is less doped than the substrate; in this way, excess carrier injection takes place
mainly from the substrate into the surface layer. In the structure shown in Fig. 5.1(a),
pn+ doping allows surface generation to be maximized. Homojunction LEDs can be
diffused or epitaxial.
In heterojunction LEDs carriers are injected, in direct bias, into a narrowgap material
sandwiched between two widegap layers, e.g., an AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs heterojunc-
tion or InAlAs/InGaAs/InP heterojunction. Injected excess carriers radiatively recom-
bine, emitting photons; see Fig. 5.1(b). In heterojunction LEDs the photons emitted
by the narrowgap layer cannot be absorbed by the widegap cladding; photons emitted
toward the substrate can be recovered, e.g., through mirrors, thus improving the device
efﬁciency.
LEDs can also be classiﬁed according to the direction along which the output beam
is emitted with respect to the junction plane. Vertical emission LEDs, also called Burrus
LEDs [70] are well suited to coupling with wide-core multimode optical ﬁbers (with
core widths of the order of 50–100 μm) due to the large emission area (see Fig. 5.2(a)).

Heterojunction LEDs: (a) vertical AlGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs LED with a substrate Bragg mirror;

Many high-performance LEDs are, on the other hand, edge-emitting structures (see
Fig. 5.2(b)) needing lateral coupling and alignment with the optical ﬁber. Edge-emitting
LEDs closely resemble Fabry–Perot lasers in which the cavity quality factor is low due
to the lack of mirrors. In some heterojunction edge-emitting LEDs, high injection condi-
tions enable the onset of gain in the narrowgap material, thus allowing emitted photons
to undergo multiplication through stimulated emission. The resulting device, called a
superradiant LED (or superluminescent LED [71]), shows an increase in the optical
power and also spectral narrowing (due to the fact that the gain spectrum is narrower
than the spontaneous emission spectrum).
5.2.2
Homojunction LED power–current characteristics
The homojunction LED is a pn junction where radiative recombination dominates over
nonradiative effects. Following the Shockley model, the total junction current can be
written as the sum of three contributions, arising from recombination in the two injection
sides (to deﬁne the structure, we suppose that the p side is on the surface, while the
substrate is n+) and in the space charge region. Let NA be the doping of the (surface) p
side, ND the doping of the (substrate) n side, and Lnp and Lhn the diffusion lengths of
electrons in the p side and holes in the n side, respectively:
Lnp =
	
Dnτn,
Lhn =
	
Dhτh,
where Dn and Dh are the electron and hole diffusivities, τn and τh are the carrier
total lifetimes. The current contribution from electron injection from the substrate into
the surface layer is denoted as In0, while the current contribution from hole injec-
tion from the top layer into the substrate is denoted as Ih0. Finally, the current arising
from generation and recombination in the space-charge region is IGR. The total diode
current is
ID = In0 + Ih0 + IGR,

In the above expressions, A is the device area, W is the space charge region width, τ is
an equivalent lifetime for carriers in the space charge region, ni is the semiconductor
intrinsic density, and VA is the applied voltage. The GR component is small, due to the
reduced width of the space charge region in direct bias, and will be neglected in the rest
of the discussion, i.e.,
ID ≈In0 + Ih0.
Since photons emitted in the substrate side are typically lost by absorption, only In0 is
a useful LED current component. We deﬁne the LED injection efﬁciency ηi as the ratio
of the useful current (injected into the p side) to the total current:

The injection efﬁciency ηi can be maximized making the junction asymmetric, with
ND ≫NA; of course the p and n sides can be interchanged (i.e., the surface side can
be low-doping n-type, the substrate high-doping p-type).
Let us now evaluate the optical generation associated with the current component In0.
Since the photon generation rate (per unit time and volume) coincides with the (excess)
minority carrier radiative recombination rate (per unit time and volume), we have, in
the lifetime approximation and considering injected electrons in the surface p layer:

is the radiative efﬁciency, i.e., the ratio between the optical power generated by the
LED and the optical power the device would generate (with the same bias current ID) if
recombination were entirely radiative. Finally, photon losses also arise because photons
are reﬂected by the semiconductor–air interface with power reﬂection coefﬁcient R. The
transmission efﬁciency is the ratio between the transmitted and the generated optical
power and therefore coincides with the transmission coefﬁcient T = 1 −R:
ηt = 1 −R.
For normal incidence on a semiconductor–dielectric interface, the power reﬂection
coefﬁcient is
R =

nr1 −nr2
nr1 + nr2

where nr1 is the semiconductor refractive index, nr2 is the external dielectric refractive

is also called the LED slope efﬁciency.1 For high power level, the linear relation no
longer holds, mainly due to device heating (which in turn decreases the thermal lifetime)
and, in high injection, to Auger recombination. The power–current LED characteristics
therefore saturates at high current and power.
5.2.3
Charge control model and modulation bandwidth
The asymmetric homojunction LED can be conveniently modeled through a more intu-
itive charge-control approach. Introducing the excess electron charge −Qn stored in the
p side of the diode, we have2

i.e., the current In0 supplies the charge ﬂow needed to replace the total charge recom-
bined per unit time in the diffusion region. However, the total charge is also related to
the radiated power (we neglect reﬂections) as
Pout = ¯hω
q
Qn
τn,r
.
Thus, including reﬂection losses and taking into account (5.8), (5.4) and (5.5), we obtain
again the power–current relation in (5.6).
The charge control approach can be exploited to evaluate the LED modulation
response. For simplicity we assume ID ≈In0; we can extend the static charge control
equation to time-varying conditions as
dqn(t)

with cutoff frequency associated with the carrier total lifetime:
f3dB =

Since the radiative lifetime decreases with increasing charge injection to reach an
asymptotic value τo (the spontaneous radiative lifetime), the modulation bandwidth
depends on the LED bias. Assuming the dependence
τn ≈τn,r = K

where K is a proper constant, we have

The LED bandwidth therefore increases as the square root of current, to reach the limit-
ing value f3dB,M = 1/(2πτo). For GaAs, the maximum modulation bandwidth is of the
order of 300 MHz. Although the limiting value is material dependent, LEDs are anyway
conﬁned to applications below 1 Gbps.
5.2.4

The charge control model can be applied to the heterojunction LED as follows. Assum-

3 As discussed in detail in Section 6.2.3, the modulation response can make reference to the signal optical
output power (optical deﬁnition) or to the electrical power originated by detecting the signal output power
through a photodetector, proportional to the square of the optical power (electrical deﬁnition). The “optical”
response is therefore |m(ω)| and in dB (called dBo), 10 log10(|m(ω)|); the “electrical” response is |m(ω)|2
and in dB (called dBe), 20 log10(|m(ω)|). The 3 dB bandwidth corresponds to |m(ω)| = 1/2 for the optical
deﬁnition and to |m(ω)| = 1/

where d is the active layer thickness and −Qn is the total electron charge stored in the
narrowgap active layer, equal to the total hole charge (Qn = Qh) for quasi-neutrality.
The total LED current is approximated with the GR contribution in the narrowgap layer,
while diffusion currents in the cladding layers have been neglected.
The output optical power will be, taking into account (5.5) and (5.8):

where ηx = ηtηr is the device external efﬁciency. In heterojunction LEDs the injection
efﬁciency (as deﬁned in homojunction devices) is ideally 1, but in this case also photons
emitted toward the substrate can be lost, thus decreasing the efﬁciency. Backside mirrors
(cleaved or based on Bragg reﬂectors, see Section 5.8.4) can be exploited to recover the
photon ﬂux directed toward the substrate.
As in homojunction LEDs, the charge control analysis can be extended to the dynamic
regime, obtaining the same results for the modulation response (5.9) and bandwidth.
Quantum well (QW) LEDs are heterojunction LEDs with d ≪1 μm; the charge
control analysis still holds, with an injected electron charge:
Qn = q Ans,
where ns is the sheet carrier density in the QW. The charge-control model enables us
to directly relate the output power to the bias current. The voltage–current character-
istic in heterojunction LEDs still qualitatively follows the Shockley law; however, the
diode current in direct bias is mainly recombination current in the narrowgap material
rather than a diffusion current as in homojunction LEDs, with implications for the diode
threshold and ideality factor.

LED emission spectrum
The spontaneous emission spectrum rsp

much larger than the low-injection value. At high injection, however, the LED may
become superradiant or superluminescent, thus implying that part of the spontaneous
emission spectrum is affected by gain, and that the resulting total spectrum will follow
the narrower gain spectrum. Other effects, such as nonparabolic bands, can play a role
in narrowing the LED emission. As an example, in the superradiant LED analyzed in
[71] the linewidth reduces from 20 nm to 9 nm when increasing the LED current from
750 mA to 1.5 A (emission is around 0.87 μm); see [71], Fig. 12.
In QW heterojunction LEDs the emission spectrum follows a staircase density
of states, where exciton peaks are also present; in fact, in low-injection condi-
tions the Roosbroeck–Shockley relation (2.41) suggests that the emission spectrum is
proportional to the absorption spectrum, where resonance peaks appear:

5.2.6
LED materials
Since the LED emission spectrum is concentrated around the semiconductor energy
gap, the material of choice depends on the application. Visible LEDs (with emis-
sion between 400 and 700 nm) exploit materials with a comparatively large gap.
Examples of visible LED materials are the GaAs1−xPx alloy, covering red, orange,

and yellow colours, and GaN based alloys, covering green, blue, and violet. Since
GaAs1−xPx is indirect bandgap for x > 0.5, the problem arises of exploiting indirect-
bandgap materials for spontaneous emission. Due to the high radiative lifetime and
low radiative efﬁciency, indirect-bandgap materials are characterized by very low exter-
nal efﬁciencies, unless the material is doped with an impurity (e.g., nitrogen) called
an isoelectronic impurity, whose effect is to improve radiative processes without lead-
ing to acceptor or donor behavior (isoelectronic means that the number of external
electrons of the impurity is the same as for the hosting material). Isoelectronic dop-
ing improves the radiation efﬁciency of indirect-bandgap compound semiconductors
by about two orders of magnitude, although this is always much lower than in direct-
bandgap alloys. While the InGaN alloy covers the visible range from green to blue,
UV LEDs require AlGaN, with a wider bandgap. Applications of UV LEDs include
monitoring of contaminants and ambient-temperature portable water puriﬁcation
systems.

emission.
5.3
From LED to laser
Both the LED and the laser diodes exploit radiative recombination of electron–hole
pairs in a forward-biased junction to emit light. However, LEDs are based on sponta-
neous emission, implying broad linewidth (of the order of 2kBT ) and narrow modulation
bandwidth, well below 1 GHz. The dominant emission mechanism in lasers is stimu-
lated emission: photons of a speciﬁc energy and wavenumber stimulate the emission
of coherent photons (with the same energy and wavenumber), thus leading to EM
wave ampliﬁcation; all e-h pairs recombine to generate coherent photons, and narrow
linewidth results. At the same time, the lifetime associated with stimulated emission can
be shorter, for high photon density, than the spontaneous radiative lifetime τ0; thus, the
laser can achieve modulation bandwidths as wide as 20–30 GHz.
In summary, stimulated emission is the key to improving the LED spectral purity
and modulation bandwidth or speed. To turn a LED into a laser, however, we need a
mechanism able to foster stimulated rather than spontaneous recombination at a certain
photon energy, i.e., a frequency-selective structure such as an optical resonator or cavity.
The optical cavity is compatible with a discrete set of photon states, whose density is
large within the cavity, and which operate as positive feedback with respect to stimulated
emission.4
4 The coupling of a gain block (the junction where stimulated emission occurs) and a frequency-selective
feedback block makes the laser somewhat similar to an electronic oscillator, whose basic components are
an ampliﬁer and a frequency-selective feedback loop.

Scheme of the Fabry–Perot cavity laser.
In the simplest cavity lasers, the Fabry–Perot (FP) lasers, the cavity and the junction
are completely integrated, as shown in Fig. 5.5.5 The pn junction is typically imple-
mented through a Pi N heterostructure, in which the narrowgap central portion acts
as the active layer (where stimulated emission occurs through e-h pair recombination),
while the two external widegap (cladding) layers, having slightly lower refractive index
than the active region, contribute to the vertical conﬁnement of the optical ﬁeld. The
cavity optical ﬁeld can be described as a superposition of waves guided (in the direc-
tion orthogonal to the junction plane) by the narrowgap layer, and reﬂected back and
forth from the two polished faces (lateral faces are typically roughened to suppress
the so-called transversal resonances). A forward-bias current is fed into the junction
and injected carriers recombine, sustaining the photon density inside the cavity and
compensating for photon losses due to absorption in the cladding and, above all, to per-
meable (i.e., non-perfectly-reﬂecting) mirrors. The mirror power reﬂectivity (r is the
ﬁeld reﬂectivity), deﬁned at normal incidence by the refractive index step with respect
to air:

is typically ≪1 (for example, R = (
√
13 −1)2/(
√
13 + 1)2 = 0.32 for a GaAs–air
interface); therefore, many photons escape the cavity, allowing the laser ﬁeld to be
coupled with an external propagation medium (e.g., an optical ﬁber). Since the ﬁeld
distribution on the mirror faces is narrow across and broad parallel to the heterojunc-
tion, the far-ﬁeld laser radiation pattern (proportional to the spatial Fourier transform

the vertical plane. In summary, the double heterojunction enables, in the vertical direc-
tion, carrier conﬁnement (due to the heterojunction potential wells in the conduction
and valence bands) and photon conﬁnement (due to the higher refractive index of the
active layer vs. the cladding).
The cavity feedback makes stimulated emission dominant only when the photon den-
sity in the cavity is large enough. Consider the laser block scheme in Fig. 5.6. The
junction hosts two radiative recombination mechanisms, spontaneous and stimulated;
we neglect for the moment other competing nonradiative processes, such as thermal and
Auger recombination. The diode current injects carriers recombining in either radiative
mechanism according to the relative lifetimes. For low current, the carrier density in the
junction is small, and so is the phonon density in the cavity. In this region, spontaneous
emission dominates over stimulated emission and the laser works as a LED, according
to the ﬂow scheme shown by the thick arrows in Fig. 5.6(a). The output power near
the laser emission wavelength is small, because most photons are emitted on a broad
spectrum.

Sources
Increasing the current density, the photon density in the cavity allowed modes
increases. Correspondingly, the stimulated lifetime (inversely proportional to the cavity
mode photon density) decreases, becoming smaller than the spontaneous lifetime. The
feedback loop identiﬁed by the thick arrow in Fig. 5.6(b) now becomes dominant
and typical laser operation starts. Above the laser threshold – corresponding to self-
sustaining oscillations where the photons lost in one cycle are replaced by the photons
generated by stimulated emission – the laser spectrum narrows. A small fraction of car-
riers still recombine spontaneously, emitting incoherent photons and thus contributing
to the laser phase noise and ﬁnite linewidth.
Above threshold, the number of carriers injected per unit time (i.e., the junction cur-
rent) is approximately equal (with unit quantum efﬁciency, i.e., neglecting nonradiative
recombination processes) to the number of photons generated per unit time within the
cavity; in steady-state conditions the photon density N remains constant because gen-
erated photons are lost at a rate N/τph where τph (the photon lifetime) is the average
survival time of a photon before it leaves the cavity through the mirrors or is absorbed;
we assume here that the ﬁrst mechanism, called mirror or end loss, is dominant. Mirror
loss is the source of the output optical power, which is therefore proportional to the
input electric current. At very high input current densities, however, the radiative efﬁ-
ciency of the laser decreases, due to nonradiative (e.g., Auger) recombination processes
competing with the stimulated recombination, self-heating, and gain compression, so
that the laser output power ﬁnally saturates.
Taking into account that the total number of photons generated is anyway propor-
tional to the input current both in the LED-like and in the laser regime (below and
above threshold), it is clear that the different slope of the laser power-current char-
acteristics (see the insets in Fig. 5.6), also called slope efﬁciency, depends on the
fact that the laser concentrates, around a narrow linewidth all the photons generated,
which are emitted on a broader bandwidth in the LED. FP lasers have linewidths of the
order of 2–3 nm (20–30 Å), at least one order of magnitude narrower than typical LED
linewidths.
5.4
The Fabry–Perot cavity resonant modes
Let us consider in more detail the operation of the FP cavity laser. The cavity length is
L and the cavity width W (along x and y axes, respectively, see Fig. 5.5). The active
region thickness is d; the front and back cavity edges are cleaved so as to act as a pair
of ﬂat parallel mirrors, while the lateral faces (across y) are treated to minimize lateral
reﬂections. The optical ﬁeld can be TE or TM (electric ﬁeld parallel or perpendicular
to the stratiﬁcation; see Fig. 5.7). Due to the refractive index step between the active
layer and the surrounding widegap cladding layers, the optical ﬁeld is conﬁned in the
active region, and extends into the cladding with exponentially decreasing tails. Reso-
nant modes are characterized by a longitudinal (x) ﬁeld pattern, similar to that shown in
Fig. 5.5, i.e., the cavity length L is an integer multiple of a half-wavelength (we assume
that the cavity facets are ideal mirrors). In the y direction the optical ﬁeld may exhibit

transversal resonances, depending on the cavity width W and on the treatment of the
lateral facets.
Concerning the cavity mode polarization, TE modes typically have better overlap
integral ov (see Section 5.5.1) and better vertical (z) conﬁnement of the optical ﬁeld;
the mirror reﬂectivity is also slightly better for TE polarization.
The FP cavity is 3D; however, in the vertical (z) direction, only the fundamental
mode (with one maximum) is excited. Since the ﬁeld distribution can be factorized as
X(x)Y(y)Z(z), we refer to transversal and longitudinal modes with reference to func-
tions X and Y, respectively; in particular, modes with many oscillations in the transverse
direction (x) are higher-order transversal modes.
5.4.1
Analysis of the TE slab waveguide fundamental mode
The laser-active region, sandwiched between two cladding layers, is an example of
three-layer slab waveguide. In most advanced laser structures, however, the conﬁne-
ment of the optical ﬁeld occurs not only in the vertical (z) direction but also in the
lateral (y) direction, due to either a refractive index variation (index-guided lasers) or to
a variation of gain (gain-guided lasers). The closed-form analysis of the propagation in
the slab waveguide is, however, useful to introduce a number of important parameters
and to provide explicit analytical approximations for them. Propagation in more com-
plex structures where the refractive index varies in the cavity cross section as n(y, z)
often has to be analyzed by numerical techniques; however, the propagation parameters
can always be expressed through the help of a modal effective refractive index, neff,
already introduced in the analysis of quasi-TEM waveguides; see Section 3.2.
Let us consider now the analysis of the slab waveguide optical ﬁeld in terms of TE
and TM modes. For the more important TE case, the electric ﬁeld can be expressed as
Ey(x, z) = E(z) exp(−jβx),
i.e., the ﬁeld is polarized in the stratiﬁcation plane. The corresponding wave equation
yields

where k0 is the free-space propagation constant and n is the refractive index. Suppose
now, for simplicity, that the slab waveguide is symmetrical, with active region refractive
index n1 and cladding index n2 < n1; the active region extends between z = −d/2 and
z = d/2 and the cladding is unbounded. The fundamental mode electric ﬁeld is even in
z; since the wave equation is linear, we look for exponential or sinusoidal solutions:
E(z) = A exp(−α2z),
z > d/2
E(z) = B cos(α1z),
−d/2 < z < d/2
E(z) = A exp(α2z),
z < −d/2.

Longitudinal and transversal cavity resonances
Let us denote the cavity side lengths as L = Lx and W = L y; assume an oscillating
(TE or TM) ﬁeld pattern:
E(x, y, z) = E0(z) sin(kxx) sin(ky y).
The modal distribution E0(z) was already analyzed in detail for the TE polarization.
Assuming for simplicity  = −1 for the mirror reﬂectivity, the total electric ﬁeld on the
mirrors is zero and the resonance condition follows as
kx Lx = nπ,
kyL y = mπ,
where m and n are integers. For modes with effective refractive index neff, the following
dispersion relation arises (the ﬁeld is assumed as a plane wave in the (x, y) plane):

where typically n ≫m since many oscillations arise in the longitudinal direction but
only a few (or, hopefully, just one) in the transversal direction. Indeed, let us initially
assume that no oscillations exist in the transversal direction; the electric ﬁeld is constant
along y, a condition compatible with roughened lateral surfaces imposing homogeneous
Neumann boundary conditions on the ﬁeld. Condition (5.17) then reduces to

Therefore, having assigned an “excited interval” around λ0, where the lasing mode will
fall, the mode index will be
n ≈2neffLx
λ0
.
For a cavity with typical length of 100 μm, effective refractive index neff ≈3, emission
wavelength in vacuo λ0 ≈1 μm, this amounts to n ≈600. A high-order longitudinal
mode is therefore excited in common (edge-emitting) lasers, while for vertical emission
lasers (VCSELs) the mode order can be much lower due to the reduced cavity length.
Correspondingly, the resonant frequencies are
fn = n
c0
2neffLx
.
It is important to evaluate the spacing between two successive resonant wavelengths.
We have
λ0n = λ0n −λ0(n+1) =

2neffLx = 2neffLx
n (n + 1) ≈λ0n

and therefore
λ0n ≈2neffLx

The corresponding, uniform, frequency spacing will be
fn = fn+1 −fn = [(n + 1) −n]
c0
2neffLx
=

Since λ0n fn = c0, by differentiation we obtain

onant condition of the transversal modes can be evaluated perturbatively from the

Example 5.3: Suppose L = 200 μm, W = 50 μm, neff = 3.3, excitation wavelength

The longitudinal mode spacing λ0n is typically smaller than the FP laser linewidth;
thus, more than one longitudinal mode is usually excited. Consider now some transver-
sal modes around the longitudinal mode selected; we have, in general,

λ0,1650,2 = 799.991 nm.
Transversal modes are therefore close to the longitudinal (fundamental) one, and
are usually all excited, contributing to undesirable features in the laser emission and
coupling to external media. Higher-order transversal modes are inconvenient from the
standpoint of the laser linewidth, but also of the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern. Odd-order

transversal modes have a paraxial zero in the far-ﬁeld radiation pattern, and there-
fore are poorly coupled with an optical ﬁber. Higher-order even modes tend to be less
directional and therefore their coupling to an optical ﬁber deteriorates; see Fig. 5.9.
transversal mode suppression can be achieved by making the cavity width W narrow,
ideally ≈λ0/neff.

Material and cavity gain
Stimulated emission, and therefore cavity gain, is the key to laser operation. However,
the optical ﬁeld extends also to the cladding, i.e., outside the active region of thickness
d where gain is present; see Fig. 5.10. To account for this, an effective gain, called the
cavity gain gc, can be introduced. The cavity gain is related to the material gain in the
active region by the relation
gc = ovg,

index, weighted by the overlap integral:
neff ≈ovn1.
If material gain is small, this can be interpreted as a (small) perturbation of the imag-
inary part of the active region complex refractive index nr = nr1 −jnr2 from 0 to
nr2 ≡n1:

The FP laser from below to above threshold
Let us now summarize a few points from the previous discussion. In the FP cavity, a
total current I is injected in forward bias, corresponding to a current density J = I/A,
A being the junction area. Holes and electrons build up in the active layer with den-
sities n ≈p (because of quasi-neutrality), and positive net gain results over a certain
energy interval. At the same time, photon losses occur due to absorption in the cladding
(denoted as αloss), and to the effect of mirrors (referred to as mirror loss or end loss).
Mirror loss, however concentrated in space, can in turn be expressed in terms of an
equivalent absorption αm, as discussed later. Within the cavity, a suitable modal spec-
trum exists, with longitudinal modes and (if any) clusters of closely spaced transversal
modes around them.
Suppose that the current density is much lower than the threshold density required
for lasing, J ≪Jth; also the electron (hole) concentration in the active region will be
lower than the threshold value, n ≪nth, and the gain will be lower than the total loss
αloss + αm. In such conditions, the laser operates like a LED, with a broad emission
spectrum dominated by spontaneous emission; see Fig. 5.12(a).

The laser gain proﬁle and photon emission from below to above threshold.
Increasing the current density will cause the electron density (and, as a consequence,
the material and cavity gain) to increase. When the gain almost compensates for the
total losses, the photons belonging to the cavity modes close to the gain maximum
begin to experience positive feedback from stimulated emission. The corresponding
lifetime decreases, so that more and more e-h pairs recombine by stimulated emis-
sion. At threshold, losses and gain are equal, and the output spectrum narrows; see
Fig. 5.12(b).
Above threshold, increasing current injection does not cause an appreciable increase
of the electron density above nth; this happens because the corresponding increase of the
optical power density in the cavity reduces the carriers’ stimulated lifetime. A certain set
of modes (among which one can be dominant: in FP lasers, however, many longitudi-
nal modes are typically excited) stimulates the e-h pair recombination, thus subtracting
photons to the other modes and to spontaneous recombination, which remains as an
incoherent noise background. In this way, only a few FP cavity lines are above thresh-
old (with different amplitudes) while the others are quenched and below threshold; see
Fig. 5.12(c).
5.6.1
The threshold condition
The FP laser threshold condition can be derived by considering that, at threshold, laser
oscillations are self-sustaining. This means that two conditions are simultaneously met:
• The optical wave recovers the initial phase after a round-trip in the cavity, corre-
sponding to cavity resonance.
• The optical wave recovers the initial amplitude after a round-trip in the cavity; this
means that the cavity net gain is zero, i.e., the cavity gain equals the cavity losses
(mirror or end loss, loss external to the active region or at least not accounted for in
the active region material net gain).

Figure 5.13
Round-trip phase and amplitude evaluation of FP cavity threshold condition.
We can follow the electric ﬁeld through a cavity round-trip, as shown in Fig. 5.13.
We ﬁrst consider a cavity with unequal ﬁeld mirror reﬂectivities r1 and r2.6 The round-
trip begins at point 1, immediately before the mirror. Following reﬂection from the
mirror, the ﬁeld amplitude is multiplied by the mirror reﬂectivity r1 (point 2). The ﬁeld
then travels through the cavity, experiencing a total ﬁeld attenuation and gain 1
2(αloss −
g)L (remember that the power absorption and gain must be divided by 2 to obtain the
corresponding ﬁeld parameters). At the same time, a phase delay builds up, proportional
to kx L. After reﬂection from the second mirror (point 3 to 4 in Fig. 5.13), the round-trip
is closed at point 5 with a further amplitude and phase variation. We now require that
the amplitude and phase should be the same at points 1 (beginning of round-trip) and 5
(end of round-trip).
For simplicity, we will assume now that the mirror reﬂectivities are equal
(r1 = r2 = r) and that r2 = |r|2 = R (real, power reﬂectivity; we assume that the phase
of r is π – a different phase would lead to a small variation of the resonance condition).7
The round-trip consistency condition yields
E0 = RE0 exp (−αloss L + govL + j2kx L) ,
(5.24)
but the phase term vanishes, since
kx L = 2πnr
λ0
× n λ0
nr
= n × 2π.
Therefore, from (5.24) we obtain
1 = exp (−αloss L + govL + log R) →−αloss L + govL + log R = 0;
6 This situation is common in practice, since one of the facets is treated so as to emit a low signal, exploited
for monitoring purposes.
7 The case of unequal complex reﬂectivities is trivial, since the phases are included in the resonance
conditions, while the equivalent power reﬂectivity is Req = |r1r2|.

and αloss, as already stated, is the absorption in the cladding. The mirror loss or
end loss acts like a concentrated loss equivalent to a distributed absorption such as
−αm L = log R. Note also that the transparency condition g(¯hω)ov = 0 (often close
to the threshold in the presence of very low mirror loss, as in VCSELs).
5.6.2
The emission spectrum
As already mentioned, below threshold the laser emission is similar to the LED
broadband spectrum. Increasing the device current initially brings the device into a
superradiant LED regime, with some spectral narrowing due to the onset of stimu-
lated emission. Above threshold, the spectrum is narrowed but, still, a few FP cavity
lines are excited. Some data relative to a GaAs/AlGaAs based FP laser are shown in
Fig. 5.14 [74].

Below threshold a LED-like behavior dominates, with a FWHM linewidth of the
order of 50 meV or 60 nm (around 1.3 μm). Near threshold, we have superradiant LED
behavior, with a shift of the maximum around the gain maximum and linewidth around
20 nm (200 Å). Above threshold, we ﬁnd typical laser behavior, with envelope linewidth
(see inset in Fig. 5.14) around 1 nm or 10 Å; note, however, that the single-line linewidth
is of the order of 1 Å. We shall return later to the cause of the ﬁnite linewidth of the laser,
even in the case where multiple longitudinal resonances are suppressed.
5.6.3
The electron density and optical power
Below threshold, increasing the current increases the junction electron density n (and
therefore the gain); recombination is, however, dominated by the spontaneous life-
time, which decreases with increasing injected charge to ﬁnally reach a limiting value
τ0. Above threshold, stimulated recombination prevails for some cavity modes; this
leads to smaller stimulated lifetimes vs. spontaneous recombination, which is therefore
reduced to a background noise. Always above threshold, the current increases but the
junction injected charge density remains approximately constant to the threshold value
(n ≈nth); however, the increase of the optical power leads to a decrease of the stimu-
lated lifetime; this allows the optical output power and the current density to increase,
even with a junction charge density approximately constant to the threshold value.
Finally, the slope efﬁciency dPout/dI increases after threshold because the emission
spectrum becomes narrowband. Such behavior is summarized in Fig. 5.15.
In practice, the behavior of the laser spectrum above threshold is considerably more
involved. Laser heating leads to a variation of the gain spectrum (e.g., due to a variation
of the energy gap vs. temperature) and also to a variation of the cavity size and refrac-
tive index (with a shift of the cavity resonant modes). As a consequence, the emission
spectrum shifts and mode hopping can occur (i.e., the dominant mode can change with
increasing optical power).

The total lifetime at threshold τn,th can be approximately assumed of the order of 4τ0

The photon lifetimes
A useful parameter in laser modeling is the photon lifetime τph, that is, the average
lifetime of a photon between its emission and loss (due to external loss or to mirror
loss). We deﬁned the equivalent total loss of the cavity in (5.25) and (5.26) as
αt = αloss + 1
L log R−1 = αloss + αm.

5.6.6
Power–current characteristics from photon lifetimes
An alternative expression for the power–current characteristics of the laser above thresh-
old (5.30) can be derived in terms of the photon lifetimes. Let us consider as the output
power the power associated with the cavity modes above threshold; such power will be
negligible at threshold and below. Assuming that all carriers injected into the junction
recombine, emitting coherent photons, and that such photons are either absorbed in the
cladding or emitted through the mirrors, we have the balance equation for the excess
current vs. the threshold current:

However, the output power corresponds to photons disappearing through mirrors with a

Equations (5.36) and (5.30) are equivalent, see Example 5.7.
A best-case estimate of the laser slope efﬁciency dPout/dI can be derived by consid-
ering an ideal situation, in which each e-h pair recombining in the active region above
threshold leads to the stimulated emission of a photon, which is then radiated out of the
cavity. Assuming that such e-h pairs are related to the extra current vs. the threshold,
I −Ith, one has
E ph · I −Ith
q

or, approximating ¯hω ≈Eg,
Pout ≈Eg
q (I −Ith) ,
(5.37)
which yields an ideal slope efﬁciency, independent of the speciﬁc laser structure and
only dependent on material properties. For low external loss, τph ≈τm and (5.36)
coincides (assuming ¯hω ≈Eg) with (5.37). Notice that, in all the expressions con-
sidered, we have of course neglected power saturation, thus yielding a constant slope
efﬁciency.
5.7
The laser evolution: tailoring the active region
The evolution of the laser active region is brieﬂy summarized in Fig. 5.16. Early
semiconductor lasers exploited homojunctions,8 providing little conﬁnement to carri-
ers (whose concentration decreases away from the junction because of diffusion). The
increase in the carrier concentration around the junction, due to carrier injection in
direct bias, leads to a small variation of the refractive index (weakly proportional to
the free carrier concentration). Low carrier and photon conﬁnement required extremely
high threshold currents and led to very short laser average time to failure, even at low
operating temperature.
A fundamental step toward the development of practical semiconductor lasers was
achieved with the introduction of heterojunctions (initially simple, and then double),
providing strong conﬁnement of injected carriers together with photon conﬁnement
through the refractive index increase in the low-gap (active) region. To decrease the
threshold current Ith with the same amount of threshold charge density, the thickness d
of the active region was progressively decreased. Below a certain thickness (a few hun-
dred nanometers), however, two effects arise. First, the low-gap active region becomes a

quantum well (QW), with a change (usually an improvement) in the bandstructure and
optical properties. On the other hand, the overlap integral becomes increasingly small,
due to the poor photon conﬁnement provided by the increasingly thin QW. To improve
photon conﬁnement, the QW was embedded in another double heterojunction, realized
with a material of intermediate gap between the active layer and the cladding (e.g., the
active layer is GaAs, the optical conﬁnement layer is Al0.1Ga0.9As, and the cladding
is Al0.3Ga0.7As, all lattice matched); this provided separate conﬁnement to carriers and
the optical ﬁeld. As a further step, nonuniform refractive index proﬁles were exploited in
the so-called GRINSCH (graded index separate conﬁnement heterostructure) lasers, so
as to optimize the overlap integral. Furthermore, multiple QW (MQW) lasers were intro-
duced, typically providing separate conﬁnement to electrons and photons, to increase
the output laser power while preserving the same advantages as provided by simple
QW structures.
In summary, the evolution of the laser active region was in the direction of improving
the vertical conﬁnement of electrons, holes, and photons, at the same time exploiting
the potential advantages or features offered by QWs in terms of optical properties.
Before discussing this point, however, we have to mention that lateral conﬁnement
should also be improved with respect to the conventional FP solution. The two main
approaches (gain-guided and index-guided lasers) will be discussed in Section 5.8.2
and Section 5.8.3.
5.7.1
Quantum-well lasers
Introducing a QW leads to a change in the material gain properties, which become
polarization dependent. Moreover, in the QW the degeneracy between the two topmost
hole bands (HH and LH) is removed. Typically, the HH band is topmost in unstrained
wells; tensile strain can reestablish degeneracy and even bring the LH band on top: this

would decrease the hole effective mass and density of states, thus leading to an improve-
ment in gain, and therefore in the threshold current. However, compressive strain is also
beneﬁcial since it reduces the valence band discontinuity and the hole escape lifetime,
thus improving the injection efﬁciency. Another advantage of the QW approach is a
reduction of Auger rates [4]. Finally, QW lasers are the ultimate step in decreasing the
active-region laser thickness to reduce the threshold current density.
Decreasing the active region thickness in a conventional or QW laser initially leads
to a decrease of the threshold current. Assume, as an approximation, that the material
gain depends linearly on the carrier density; the threshold gain can be approximated as
gth = Kovnth, where K is a suitable constant. Using the classical expression for the
threshold current we obtain

meaning that, for large d, the threshold current decreases with decreasing d, while for
small d we ultimately have

d ,
i.e., the threshold current increases for decreasing d, as shown in Fig. 5.17.
Example 5.4: A double heterojunction laser with λ0 = 1.3 μm has an InP cladding with
n1 = 3.2 and an InGaAsP intrinsic layer, thickness d, with refractive index n2 ≈3.55.
Assuming a threshold gain gth = 4000 cm−1 and a threshold electron density nth = 1 ×
1018 cm−3, junction area A = 300 × 5 μm2, estimate the threshold current as a function
of d. Assume τ0 = 0.7 ns.

Blending the two asymptotic behaviors we obtain the result shown in Fig. 5.17. The
minimum threshold current is around 25 mA corresponding to a current density of
1.6 kA/cm2 for an optimum thickness around 200 nm.
In the above analysis, we have assumed that the active layer sheet density can be
given a quasi-3D expression as nd, where n is the active layer 3D concentration.
In fact, the electron density of a QW exhibits quantum features, such as a density
proﬁle (orthogonal to the stratiﬁcation) proportional to the squared magnitude of the
subband envelope wavefunction. The electron sheet density relative to each subband
can be denoted by n2D, and, assuming for simplicity that only the ﬁrst subband is
involved in the laser action, the threshold laser current can be now more conveniently
expressed as

The already discussed behavior is, however, found when decreasing the QW thickness.
In typical QW lasers, the emitted power density is increased through the use of MQW
structures (but this, also leads to a higher current density).
The gain spectra of QWs exhibit slightly different features with respect to the bulk,
due to the different joint density of states (JDOS), which is a step-like function, each
step corresponding to an allowed transition between subbands. The energy behavior of
gain in bulk was shown in Fig. 2.16 (for GaAs); the gain envelope globally follows the
JDOS proﬁle. In a QW the gain proﬁle vs. energy, shown in Fig. 2.17, clearly exhibits
features inherited from the QW JDOS; notice that increasing the electron density leads
to a deeper modiﬁcation of the gain proﬁle, which exhibits peaks. Quantum wire and

quantum dot gain spectra are even more deeply modiﬁed due to the strongly resonant
JDOS behavior found in such structures.
A further degree of freedom in gain proﬁle engineering ﬁnally originates from the
use of strained or pseudomorphic QWs, which may allow for polarization-independent
emission. In fact, strained QWs can lead to an alignment or disalignment of the valence
subband level, as shown in Fig. 5.18. The interaction strength of the light holes (LH) and
heavy holes (HH) with the electron subband is different, however, and turns out to be
polarization dependent (from the computation of the corresponding matrix elements).

QW with sheet carrier density ns = 3 × 1012 cm−2 [11]. Three cases are considered:
(a) QW with compressive strain, Ga mole fraction x = 0.41, well width L = 4.5 nm;
(b) lattice-matched QW, Ga mole fraction x = 0.47, well width L = 6 nm; (c) QW
with tensile strain, Ga mole fraction x = 0.53, well width L = 1.5 nm. In all cases
the structure was designed so as to obtain the lowest band-edge transition wave-
length close to 1.55 μm (energy ≈0.8 eV). The gains were normalized to a total
length of 20 nm including the QW width L and the InGaAsP barrier widths [11]. In
cases (a) and (b) the C1-HH1 transition is dominant, and the TE polarization gain
prevails. In case (c) tensile strain equalizes the HH1 and LH1 levels, and the TM
polarization gain is slightly prevalent (note that, with the same interaction strength,

light holes are characterized by a lower density of states effective mass and therefore
more easily reach the population inversion condition). Equalization of the gain spectra
in a strained QW structure also corresponds (in the absence of current injection) to
the equalization of absorption proﬁles, which can be exploited, as already remarked,
in the realization of polarization-independent electroabsorption modulators or wave-
guide photodiodes.
5.7.2
Laser material systems
The material choice for the laser active region is related to the emission wavelength
and therefore to the speciﬁc application. Material systems for the laser are somewhat
similar to those exploited in the LED. The early development of lasers in the 1970s
was mainly driven by the AlGaAs/GaAs material system, with emission wavelengths
around 0.8 μm. Long-haul ﬁber communications stimulated the development in the
1980s of long-wavelength lasers, emitting at 1.3 and 1.55 μm in the regions of min-
imum ﬁber dispersion and attenuation, respectively. Such lasers were based on InP
technology and, in particular, on the InGaAsP material system. In the same years, the
introduction of CD players brought GaAs-based lasers into the consumer market, with a
drive toward reducing the wavelength into the visible region (e.g., red) in DVD players
to increase storage density. In the 1990s, InP-based lasers gradually became commer-
cially available, while new material systems were investigated to achieve emission in
the blue (0.4 μm wavelength). This was ﬁnally achieved by exploiting the widegap
InGaN/GaN material system, opening the path to new applications, such as DVD sys-
tems with dramatically increased capacity (25 Gb per single-layer disc). On the other
hand, extralong-wavelength emission was sought by exploiting, rather than band-to-
band transitions, intersubband effects in multiquantum well (the so-called quantum
cascade lasers, also suited for terahertz emission). As a last point, we may mention
the quest for the Si laser – announced in recent years, but in the form, for the moment,
of an optically pumped device based on the Raman effect [75]. For datacom and tele-
com applications, however, AlGaAs/GaAs and InGaAsP/InP today remain the main
players.
5.8
The laser evolution: improving the spectral purity and stability
Early semiconductor lasers exploited Fabry–Perot cleaved cavities with rather large lat-
eral dimension W. Several longitudinal and transversal modes were excited, making
the linewidth one order of magnitude better than in LEDs, but still poor for long-haul
applications.
Partial suppression of the higher-order transversal modes was ﬁrst achieved by inject-
ing current only in a stripe, thus causing a reduction of the lateral cavity size due to
the so called gain guiding effect (only part of the laser offered gain and was therefore
able to support the lasing action). Gain guiding was then replaced by more efﬁcient
index-guided structures, with just one transversal mode.

5.8 The laser evolution: improving the spectral purity and stability
291
On the other hand, single longitudinal mode lasers required either the coupling of
two Fabry–Perot cavities (as in cleaved coupled cavity or C3 lasers),9 or making use of
a different mirror approach, based on distributed reﬂection from a diffraction grating,
rather than on concentrated reﬂection by a cleaved mirror. Distributed reﬂectors have
nonﬂat reﬂection coefﬁcients vs. wavelength, and therefore more effectively suppress
spurious longitudinal modes.
Gratings can be either integrated into the cavity as in DFB (distributed-feedback)
lasers, or can be placed outside of the cavity, as in DBR (distributed Bragg reﬂector)
lasers. External distributed mirrors involve additional complexities in the technology,
but their reﬂecting properties are immune from the change in the laser bias current.
DBR lasers therefore have better line stability and, if the external mirrors are suit-
ably polarized with currents, the emitted wavelength can be changed, leading to tunable
lasers.
Transition from the FP to the DFB and DBR lasers also leads to an improvement of
the temperature stability of the emitted wavelength, but, if stringent requirements are
imposed on this parameter, the laser has to be thermally stabilized through a Peltier
cell, leading to expensive packaging and high-cost devices, such as those exploited
in long-haul WDM (wavelength division multiplexing) systems. In recent years, how-
ever, market demand has been pushing more on short-length links supported through
low-cost, integrated modules not needing temperature stabilization; this has in turn
fostered the development of uncooled lasers exploiting material systems with reduced
temperature sensitivity, like AlGaInAs alloys [76].
5.8.1
Conventional Fabry–Perot lasers
Conventional Fabry–Perot lasers have a simple manufacturing process; a pn hetero-
junction is grown epitaxially, and then cut so as to create bars approximately as long
as the ﬁnal cavity. End-facet cleaving along proper crystal planes allows the creation
of the end mirrors, while the lateral sides are roughened so as to obtain a non-
mirroring surface. However, due to the impossibility of laterally cleaving the cavity
down to a few micrometers, the FP cavity is wide enough to excite many transversal
modes (besides many longitudinal modes); see Fig. 5.19(a). Transversal mode excita-
tion leads to poor coupling with the ﬁber, while the excitation of many longitudinal
modes causes poor spectral purity (typically of the order of 1–3 nm) and current- and
temperature-dependent spectral emission.
5.8.2
Gain-guided FP lasers
A ﬁrst step toward improving the FP cavity laser resulted from conﬁning the cur-
rent injection to a narrow stripe. In its simplest form, the resulting stripe laser has a

passivated upper surface, while current ﬂow is limited to the unpassivated metal stripe;
see Fig. 5.19(b). Owing to the current injection, the region lying below the ohmic
contact has higher carrier concentration than the rest of the device and exhibits gain.
Since the current density also spreads laterally, the boundary between the gain region
and the region without gain is not sharp. Moreover, the gain is not laterally uniform due
to the inhomogeneous current injection. Lasing takes place only in the central region
with gain (gain guiding) but, due to the nonuniform gain and refractive index, the optical
ﬁeld wavefronts bend so as to give rise to multiple longitudinal modes (while higher-
order transversal modes are effectively suppressed). No strong lateral conﬁnement is
provided by this structure to the optical ﬁeld or to carriers. Due to the multiple lon-
gitudinal modes excited, gain-guided lasers often exhibit kinks in the power–current
characteristic, caused by the mode transition (Fig. 5.20); this also leads to a change in
the emission wavelength.
5.8.3
Index-guided FP lasers
Further improvements to the laser structure were introduced by lateral conﬁnement
of photons through a refractive index step (index-guided laser) and/or of the carriers
through an insulating interface and/or a potential well associated with a heterojunc-
tion. A ﬁrst example of index-guided structure is the ridge laser (Fig. 5.21), in which
the current density is injected through a ridge structure that increases the effective
refractive index of the slab dielectric waveguide section lying below it, so as to con-
ﬁne the ﬁeld in the region below the ridge. Although the gain proﬁle is laterally not
uniform, the consequence is less dramatic due to the improved lateral optical ﬁeld
conﬁnement.
Better results can be obtained by creating a nonuniform lateral structure, either
by passivation, or by epitaxial regrowth of a widegap material around the central
active region. In both cases the structure is referred to as the buried laser (or buried

for an epitaxially regrown device.
In index-guided structures, the active region is limited by barriers that laterally con-
ﬁne both carriers and photons. In such structures, the carrier concentration and, to some
extent, also the photon density, can be considered as uniform in the lateral direction.
The access region is often wedge-shaped in order to decrease the parasitic series resis-
tance of the diode. Although the laser has more than one longitudinal mode excited,
mode hopping as a function of the excitation current and of the temperature is avoided
(Fig. 5.20). Despite the absence of mode hopping, the output wavelength changes with
increasing current, for example, due to the change in refractive index associated with

spectrum is smaller than for gain-guided lasers.
5.8.4
Distributed-feedback (DFB and DBR) lasers
Single (longitudinal) mode lasers are achieved with the help of mirror (diffraction) grat-
ings (see Fig. 5.23), which substitute cleaved mirrors, or provide additional feedback.
In DFB or distributed-feedback lasers (see Fig. 5.24(a)), the grating is integrated with
the gain region, while gratings are external in DBR or distributed Bragg reﬂector lasers
(see Fig. 5.24(b)).
The distributed mirror concept was introduced in the early 1970s [77]. While a
cleaved mirror acting on the basis of the refractive index step has a reﬂection coefﬁ-
cient that is (almost) independent of the operating wavelength, the grating reﬂection
coefﬁcient can be strongly frequency dependent. If the distributed reﬂector is properly
designed, side modes see a larger mirror or end loss with respect to the central mode,
and therefore are below threshold.
A diffraction grating (see Fig. 5.23) can be created within or outside the active region
of the laser by properly etching a periodic corrugation (with a submicrometer step
related to the reﬂection peak) through a photoresist mask exposed by electron-beam

lithography (EBL) or other deep-UV processes. Interference-based techniques can be
used to avoid the use of deep submicrometer lithography. Once the surface of the wide-
gap material has been suitably etched, the epitaxial growth continues with a narrowgap
material, thus directly creating a grating adjacent to the laser active region, which acts
as a periodic perturbation of the refractive index within the active region.
To introduce the grating operation, suppose that a slab waveguide mode interacts with
a grating of periodicity  (Fig. 5.23); each step of the grating causes a small amount
of reﬂection. Reﬂections from two following grating periods have a phase difference,
φ; this leads to constructive interference from all reﬂected contributions (and therefore
large overall reﬂection) only if
φ = kl = 2k = 4π 
λ = 2nπ →λ = 2
n .
The above condition, with n = 1, is referred to as the Bragg condition, and dictates that
the grating period must be one-half of the laser (guided) wavelength; λB = 2 is also
called the Bragg wavelength of the grating.10 Higher-order reﬂections with n > 1 are
sometimes used to relax lithography requirements, which can become very severe, e.g.,
for blue lasers, where the wavelength is around 400 nm. Two successive Bragg condi-
tions (e.g., with n = 1 and n = 2 ) correspond to a large wavelength interval. Compare
the Fabry–Perot resonance condition nλ/2 = L with the Bragg condition nλ/2 = ; in
both cases we obtain that
|λ|
λ

n ,
10 Another interpretation of the grating operation sees the grating as a scatterer that imparts to the photons a
momentum kg, converting the forward wave into a reﬂected wave:
−k = k −kg →kg = 2π
 = 2k = 4π
λ →λ ≡λB = 2.
Of course, this again corresponds to the deﬁnition of the Bragg wavelength.

296
Sources
but since L ≫, the corresponding value of n is about 1000 for the FP cavity, while
it is only 1 for the grating. The spacing between two consecutive Bragg conditions is
therefore several orders of magnitude larger than the spacing between two FP cavity
modes. This, however, does not necessarily imply that grating-based lasers are safely
single-mode, since the detailed analysis of a grating reveals that, around each of its
Bragg resonances, the mirror reﬂectivity may have a comparatively wide bandwidth.
For the sake of simplicity, consider ﬁrst the grating as a distributed mirror external
to the gain region (the corresponding structure is the DBR laser). The analysis shows
that, around a Bragg condition (e.g., that corresponding to n = 1), the grating reﬂection
coefﬁcient can be expressed as [37]
r =
−jκL sinh(γ L)
γ L cosh(γ L) + jβL sinh(γ L),

around the zero detuning condition has the approximate width |βL| ≈2κL; for
|βL| > 2κL the reﬂectivity drops and the mirror loss increases.
If the grating is present together with a cleaved cavity (as in DBR lasers, see
Section 5.8.5), proper design of the grating is able to suppress lasing of all FP cav-
ity modes but one, thus making laser operation single-mode. In fact, for a FP cavity
mode we have
2kL = 2nπ.
Therefore, if kn corresponds to the central FP mode, the nearby FP side modes have nor-
malized detuning ±βL = kn±1L −knL = ±π. To decrease the grating reﬂectivity of
the side modes (thus increasing their end loss), we therefore need to impose 2κLg < π,
where Lg is the grating length.
In DFB lasers, gain and distributed reﬂection occur in the same region, and the anal-
ysis of the threshold condition is more involved. In fact, the threshold condition now
corresponds to the solution of the following transcendental equation [37]:
γ L cosh(γ L) + j

sinh(γ L) = 0,
where gth is the (cavity) threshold power net gain and

.
Note that the threshold net gain corresponds to the sum of the external and mirror loss
(or end loss, as it is more appropriately called in this context), approximately equivalent
to the end loss. As usual, β is the detuning with respect to the Bragg condition; see
(5.39). Although one might have expected that a solution exists for zero detuning (i.e.,
for the Bragg wavelength), this is not the case for the simple uniform grating introduced
here. In fact, with zero detuning we should have

but the hyperbolic tangent of a real argument is always < 1. Therefore, no solution
exists for zero detuning; however, having established, for example, the coupling κ, we
can numerically analyze the threshold condition so as to obtain the detuning–gain pairs
that satisfy it. The evolution of the solutions in the plane (g0L, βL) for different
values of the normalized coupling κL is shown in Fig. 5.26; the (cavity) ﬁeld gain is
g0 = gth/2 and the normalized coupling corresponding to dots is κL = 0.5, 1, 2, 5. Two
symmetric solutions exist for positive and negative detuning, having the same possibility
for lasing.
Note that this result has been obtained by assuming that the FP mirror reﬂection is
entirely suppressed (i.e., that the cavity facets are transparent, only distributed reﬂection
takes place). From Fig. 5.26, it is clear that for high gain, low coupling the separa-
tion between the two solutions is the same as for Fabry–Perot side modes; besides, the

additional side solutions, with larger detuning, have a small gain penalty.11 In such con-
ditions, the DFB laser is not markedly superior to the FP, even if the introduced gain
penalty somewhat suppresses higher-order longitudinal modes. However, increasing the
coupling, the two main lines increase their distance and the gain penalty (related to the
larger end loss) of higher-order longitudinal modes becomes large enough to effectively
suppress secondary-mode lasing.
In conclusion, while in FP lasers the mirror loss is the same for all longitudinal modes
(Fig. 5.27), in the DFB laser side modes have a larger mirror loss and therefore cannot
lase. The two symmetrical lasing modes are, however, practically inconvenient; one of
them can be effectively suppressed either by introducing dissymmetries into the gain
proﬁle or in the reﬂecting FP-like facets, or by introducing an appropriate phase shift in
the center of the grating (λ/4 shift DFB lasers). Quarter-wavelength shifting also leads
to a dominant lasing mode with zero detuning.

Neglecting the last term (solutions with high gain g0L or low detuning βL), the mode spacing is the same

on the other hand, βL ≈π/√g0L, corresponding to the external curves in Fig. 5.26.

A schematic example of a DFB laser is shown in Fig. 5.24 (a); the template is

besides the cavity, distributed feedback is achieved through a grating in the active region
interface. The qualitative behavior of the emission spectrum of a /2 = λg/4 shifted
DFB laser is compared in Fig. 5.28 (dashed line) to the spectrum of a conventional, ideal
DFB laser (continuous line). With the quarter-wavelength grating, we obtain a dominat-
ing central mode with zero detuning and good suppression of additional transversal
(side) modes.
5.8.5
DBR and tunable DBR lasers
In DBR (distributed Bragg reﬂector) lasers, the distributed mirrors are external to the
active region. Figure 5.24(b) shows the principle of the implementation. In a DBR
laser (or, at least, in its simplest form) gratings operate as mirrors, with no gain.
The reﬂection coefﬁcient (5.38) of the grating is frequency-dependent, and a proper
choice of the grating length and coupling coefﬁcient allows for selecting a single lon-
gitudinal mode. In certain cases, gratings can be totally external and extremely long
(e.g., in an optical ﬁber), thus leading to very small linewidths. With respect to the
DFB implementation, DBR lasers are more critical to manufacture and less com-
pact, but external gratings are more stable than internal ones (not being inﬂuenced
by bias or modulation current), thus leading to improved line stability. Finally, the
grating reﬂection coefﬁcient can be modulated by an external current, thus making
the laser tunable. Tunable lasers typically have a more complex structure, including
tunable mirror sections and phase sections; one of the laser facets can be a conven-
tional cleaved mirror; see Fig. 5.29. Tunable lasers have several applications, not only
telecom, but also in measurement systems; their tuning range varies according to the

5.8.6
Vertical cavity lasers
The laser structures discussed so far are edge emitters – light is emitted in the junction
plane. Due to the aperture ﬁeld pattern, the radiation diagram is not circular; this makes
coupling with a ﬁber more critical. Vertical emission lasers, similar to vertical emission
(or Burrus) LEDs, have better ﬁber coupling owing to the circular emitting area, which
translates into a circular far-ﬁeld beam. However, vertical emission requires mirrors par-
allel to the junction plane, which can be manufactured, according to the DBR approach,
as diffraction gratings made by stacks of quarter-wavelength layers. The resulting cav-
ity and mirror properties, however, are more critical than in conventional edge-emitting
lasers. In fact, vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have a short cavity that
requires large gain and very low mirror loss (e.g., 99.9%) to achieve lasing. Highly
reﬂecting mirrors require, in turn, thick semiconductor stacks, with large series par-
asitic resistance. Because of the above issues, the development of VCSELs has been
fraught with a number of technological and design problems. A comparative simpliﬁed
picture of the typical layout of an edge-emitting Fabry–Perot laser and of an array of
VCSELs is shown in Fig. 5.30; note that the small size of a VCSEL makes it well suited
to manufacturing arrays of emitters.
In the VCSEL, the divergence of the laser beam is inversely proportional to the beam
size at the source, i.e., the smaller the source, the larger the divergence. The typi-
cal length of the cavity is 1–3 λ; due to this, the Fabry–Perot cavity mode spacing is
very large, and the cavity reﬂectivity is entirely dominated by DBR mirrors, which are

a difference in refractive index (e.g., a heterostructure MQW). VCSELs are currently
manufactured in several wavelengths (1300, 1550, and 850 nm; mature VCSELs are,
however, in the short wavelength range) and exhibit some appealing features, such as
an easier integrated technology with respect to edge emitters, easier testability, and
therefore lower cost.
An example of VCSEL mirror and cavity structure is reported in Fig. 5.31; both
dielectric and semiconductor stacks can be used as external Bragg reﬂectors. Note that,
unlike in edge-emitting DBR lasers, the mirror characteristics potentially change as a
function of the emitted power, since, as in DFB lasers, the bias current is, in fact, injected
through the reﬂector stacks.

5.8.7
Quantum dot lasers
The laser structures discussed so far exploit bulk semiconductors or quantum wells. A
number of advantages are expected from the use of zero-dimensionality structures, i.e.,
quantum dots (QDs). Since the density of states of a QD is a set of delta functions of the
carrier energy, see Section 1.32, we also expect the absorption and gain proﬁles to be
pulse-like or, allowing for some linewidth broadening mechanism, a set of broad pulses
centered around each of the QD energies. When compared with conventional or QW
structures, QDs have many favorable characteristics, such as higher differential gain
(i.e., variation of gain with respect to the carrier density), and thus a larger modulation
bandwidth, lower chirp, better spectral purity, low threshold current, and low sensitivity
to the operating temperature. In order to be effective, the size of QDs should be as small
as 10–100 nm. Nanometer-scale dots exhibit an atom-like behavior that makes them
quite similar to the molecules exploited in gas and solid-state conventional lasers.
In practice, however, the introduction of QDs into a manufacturable and effective
structure is fraught with many difﬁculties, see [78]. QDs can be implemented through
a potential well conﬁned in all directions; nevertheless, conﬁnement should not prevent
current injection into the QD, but should be strong enough (with potential barriers of
the order of 100 meV or more) not to allow carriers to escape the dots by thermalizing
into the bulk. Finally, since a single QD cannot provide signiﬁcant output power, QDs
have to be suitably manufactured into QD arrays. QD arrays are a kind of 2D or 3D
superlattice (according to whether QDs are distributed in a plane or in a volume); how-
ever, the QD array should be extremely uniform in terms of QD size and spacing, since
in nonuniform or random QD arrays, with a broad distribution of QD sizes, the density
of states is smeared and the advantages of the QD optical properties are lost. QD arrays
made through etching, as sets of circular pillars exhibit good uniformity but are affected
by heavy surface effects.
The present technology of QD lasers is based on the self-assembling of 2D arrays
of dots, made of a narrowgap material grown on a widegap substrate (e.g., InAs on
GaAs). InAs nanodots are grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a GaAs substrate; in
a ﬁrst stage of the epitaxial deposition, InAs (lattice mismatched vs. GaAs) aggregates
in a set of pyramidal structures whose height and width are in the nanometer range
(e.g., 10–20 nm base, 2–3 nm height, with a spacing around 100 nm between structures).
InAs growth is stopped at this early nucleation stage and an epitaxial growth of GaAs
is performed, which is able to planarize the structure leaving, at the end, a set of almost
uniformly sized square pyramidal dots of narrowgap InAs embedded into a thin layer
of GaAs. Several techniques have been developed to improve the uniformity of QD
spacing and also to allow for the growth of regular QD stacks making a 3D QD array;
see Fig. 5.32.
One of the major interests in QD lasers is in the area of low-cost directly modulated
lasers for 10 Gbps (and maybe above) applications not needing temperature stabiliza-
tion and therefore expensive packaging. Due to the reduced chirp, such devices could
be competitive with respect to lasers integrated with electrooptic or electroabsorption
modulators. An example of recent QD laser development is a temperature-insensitive

The laser temperature behavior
The laser emission is temperature dependent: gain spectra generally depend on the
active material temperature: increasing the ambient temperature, but also the dissipated
power in the junction, leads to a shift in the gain spectrum. As a consequence, cavity
modes experience a shift, due to the temperature dependence of the effective refractive
index and, in a Fabry–Perot cavity, to the change in size of the cavity. In Fabry–Perot
cavities, this leads both to temperature sensitivity of the emission spectrum and to the
so-called mode hopping (i.e., the dominant mode changes with changing temperature).
This increases the temperature sensitivity of the emitted wavelength up to values of the
order of 4 Å/K. Mode hopping, on the other hand, is avoided in single-longitudinal-
mode lasers such as DFB lasers, leading to a reduction of the temperature sensitivity to
values of the order of 1 Å/K (see e.g., [4], Section 10.7).
Another important issue is the variation of the threshold current with tempera-
ture. Since the temperature increase favors nonoptical recombination processes, gain
decreases, leading to larger threshold currents and to a corresponding shift of the
power–current relation. The temperature dependence of the threshold current follows
an Arrhenius-like law with characteristic temperature T0:
Ith(T ) ≈Ith(Tr) exp

T −Tr
T0

;
Tr is the reference temperature. Particular material systems (including quantum dot-
based-structures) can be implemented to decrease the temperature sensitivity.
Example 5.5: The threshold current of a laser is measured at different temperatures:
Ith(T1) = 61 mA, T1 = 20 ◦C
Ith(T2) = 67 mA, T2 = 35 ◦C
Ith(T3) = 75 mA, T3 = 50 ◦C
Ith(T4) = 85 mA, T4 = 65 ◦C.

5.10
Laser linewidth
The laser linewidth can be decreased by suppression of extra transversal and longitudi-
nal modes, but, ultimately, single-mode lasers also have a ﬁnite linewidth. Single-mode
emission is, in fact, affected by phase ﬂuctuations (phase noise), which broaden the
laser output spectrum.
Fluctuations in the laser intensity and phase are caused by ﬂuctuations in the cavity
photon number and carrier active region population. Phase ﬂuctuations seem to be par-
ticularly related to the spontaneous emission of noncoherent photons; in fact, while
stimulated emission generates photons in phase with incident photons, spontaneous
emission within the laser bandwidth creates photons with random phase. However, pop-
ulation ﬂuctuations leading to ﬂuctuations in the number of coherent photons, besides
causing intensity ﬂuctuations, also play a role in originating phase ﬂuctuations, since
they cause ﬂuctuations in the cavity gain and therefore, via the Kramers–Kronig rela-
tions, in the cavity effective refractive index neff. This causes in turn the cavity resonant
frequency (and therefore the emission frequency) to ﬂuctuate, thus broadening the
output spectrum. Such an indirect broadening mechanism is proportional to a factor
αH deﬁning the relative variation of nr versus the gain; αH is called the linewidth
enhancement factor or the Henry alpha factor, and reads
αH = dnr
dni
≈nr
ni
,
(5.40)
where nr and ni are the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index, respectively (ni
can be associated with gain or with losses). The same factor also occurs in the analysis of
the frequency chirp of lasers under amplitude modulation and in the chirp modeling of
electrooptic and electroabsorption modulators, from which comes the alternative name
of Henry chirp factor. The relevant analysis is presented in Section 5.10.1; a more com-
plete treatment (based on the Langevin approach), discussed in Section 5.13.5, leads to
the same results.
The laser linewidth resulting from the two mechanisms outlined above (emission of
incoherent photons and linewidth enhancement caused by population ﬂuctuations), also
called intrinsic laser linewidth, can be shown to be (see (5.74) in Section 5.10.1)

where Pout is the total output laser power.
Apparently, a further, extrinsic limitation to the laser linewidth is imposed by the
resonator (i.e., the laser cavity). The resonator-limited linewidth, also called cavity
linewidth, is, however, typically larger than the intrinsic linewidth, due to the low qual-
ity factor Q of semiconductor laser cavities. In fact, the cavity linewidth can be derived
from the deﬁnition of the cavity quality factor Q = f/f , where f is the cavity
FWHM bandwidth. One has immediately
ω = ω
Q .
(5.41)
However, the cavity quality factor is deﬁned as
Q = ω ×

(5.42)
where n ph is the total photon number in the cavity and τph is the photon lifetime, i.e.,
the average time between the photon emission and its absorption or escape from the
cavity through the mirrors; see (5.33) and Section 5.6.5. From (5.41) and (5.42) we
obtain
ω = ω
Q =
1
τph
,
and, deﬁning such a bandwidth as the cavity linewidth fc:
fc =
1
2πτph
.
The cavity linewidth can be extremely narrow if the cavity length is very large or the
mirrors are of high reﬂectivity. However, in semiconductor lasers the quality factor of
the cavity is low enough (low reﬂectivity mirrors and short cavity) to make the laser
linewidth dependent on or limited by intrinsic mechanisms; see Example 5.6.12
Laser linewidth requirements vary signiﬁcantly according to the application. In
the datacom and telecom ﬁeld, ﬁber dispersion limits the length–bandwidth prod-
uct of the link; moreover, the signal bandwidth is usually dominated by the source
linewidth, unless very pure laser sources are used. According to the application, the
required laser linewidth may vary. For single-wavelength local area network (LAN)
links, the 20–30 Å (2–3 nm) linewidth typical of FP lasers is adequate and sometimes
12 An intuitive explanation of the linewidth narrowing with respect to the cavity linewidth can be derived by
taking into account that in the presence of gain we have the approximate dynamic equation for the photon
density:

where the equivalent lifetime is much larger than τph. Thus, the effective cavity Q is actually increased
by the gain mechanism.

the 300–500 Å (or more) linewidth typical of LEDs can sufﬁce. Long-haul single-
frequency links (with spans up to 100 km) cannot be implemented through FP lasers
but require 1–2 Å (0.1–0.2 nm) linewidths that can be achieved by DFB lasers. Finally,
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) long-haul applications exploiting several car-
riers impose further requirements on the line stability, thus needing DFB or DBR lasers
with temperature control.

The cavity linewidth is, therefore, much larger than the actual laser linewidth.
5.10.1
Linewidth broadening analysis
We present here a classical treatment of the laser phase noise, leading to expression
(5.74) for the laser linewidth.13 The analysis is based on a number of steps, which we
will brieﬂy summarize here. We start by postulating that the optical ﬁeld intensity I
and phase φ are affected by ﬂuctuations, δI and δφ, respectively. Phase ﬂuctuations
originate both directly from spontaneous emission events, and indirectly from intensity
ﬂuctuations.14 Intensity ﬂuctuations are, in fact, related to population ﬂuctuations in the
cavity, which in turn cause a ﬂuctuation in the gain and, because of the Kramers–Kronig
relations, in the cavity effective index and ﬁeld phase. Population ﬂuctuations are not
introduced directly, but, rather, a dynamic model for the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld is developed
in order to relate δφ to δI through the αH parameter. Then, the phase and amplitude
13 The treatment closely follows the Henry papers [80], [81]. An alternative discussion of laser noise
according to the Langevin approach is presented in Section 5.13.5.
14 In the Henry theory of linewidth broadening, intensity ﬂuctuations caused by stimulated emission are not
mentioned explicitly; the ﬁnal result obtained is, however, consistent with the Langevin model in which
ﬂuctuations are caused by both spontaneous and stimulated emission. It should be taken into account that
the spontaneous and stimulated emission rates are anyway proportional through the photon number.

5.10 Laser linewidth
307
ﬂuctuations derived by adding to the ﬁeld a single photon with random phase are evalu-
ated, and it is shown that the average rate of this photon emission should coincide with
the spontaneous emission rate. Finally, the total δφ deriving from direct and indirect
phase ﬂuctuations is obtained and its second-order statistical properties are evaluated,
assuming that δφ has Gaussian statistics. This allows the autocorrelation and power
spectrum of the ﬂuctuating ﬁeld to be estimated in the form a Lorentzian.15 An addi-
tional analysis allows us to express the power spectrum FWHM as in (5.74). The
analysis of intensity ﬂuctuations will not be completed in the present section and the
treatment is left to Section 5.13.4.
We start from the electric ﬁeld E(x, t) (x is the longitudinal direction) of the cavity
dominant mode. We assume that the ﬂuctuations of E can be described by an envelope
E0(t), slowly varying with time, as16
E(x, t) ≈E0(t) exp(−jkx + jωt).
(5.43)
The cavity propagation constant is jk = jωneff/c0, where neff is the (generally complex)
cavity effective index and c0 is the free space light velocity. The perturbed ﬁeld E(x, t)
should satisfy the 1D wave equation:

In a laser cavity, ni accounts for the gain gc = ovg, the mirror loss αm, and the external
loss αloss; since α = 2α = αloss + αm −gc we immediately obtain
ni = c0
2ω (αloss + αm −gc) .
At and above threshold the gain and losses compensate, i.e., ni = 0. However, car-
rier populations ﬂuctuations induce a ﬂuctuation δni in ni, so that ni + δni ≈δni =
(c0/2ω) (αloss + αm −gc). Because of the Kramers–Kronig relations, δni will imply a
ﬂuctuation δnr in the real part, such as
αH = δnr

the effect of spontaneous emission and the related ﬂuctuations (the r.h.s. term is clearly
connected to absorption and stimulated emission); we will introduce this missing term
at a further stage, after having expressed E0 in terms of a normalized intensity I and a
phase φ:

where we have denoted as δφ′ the phase ﬂuctuation proportional to the amplitude
ﬂuctuation δI through δnr (it vanishes, in fact, if αH = 0).

neous emission, including in (5.49) the spontaneous emission rate rsp

Before exploiting (5.54), we evaluate the effect of the addition, to the unperturbed
ﬁeld, of a single photon with random phase. The amplitude ﬂuctuations δI can be con-
sidered as the collective result of this process (see note 17, p. 311), which, however,
also leads to the phase ﬂuctuation δφ′′. We call this ﬂuctuation direct, to distinguish
it from phase ﬂuctuations related to the amplitude ﬂuctuations in (5.53). Suppose that

time t, a number of photons with random phase adds to the initial ﬁeld, with
a rate:

o = Vacβk Rsp
o ≈Vacβkn/τ sp

into the lasing mode k);18 Rsp
o ≈n/τ sp
n
is the electron spontaneous recombination
rate per unit volume, where n is the cavity electron concentration; τ sp

taneous lifetime. In what follows we will also exploit the electron spontaneous
recombination rate (per unit volume) leading to spontaneous emission into the lasing
mode k:

(5.61)
The total number of photons emitted within the laser bandwidth at t is therefore rsp

ergodic (i.e., time and ensemble averages coincide) and denoting the time average
of a(t) as ⟨a⟩and the ensemble average as a, we can now derive the average phase
17 According to the present approach, intensity ﬂuctuations are derived from a ﬁeld analysis rather than
from a photon number analysis. This implies that the equivalent emission rate considered is associated
with spontaneous emission only (see, e.g., [82], Ch. 7). In fact, intensity or photon number ﬂuctuations
introduced this way also account for stimulated emission. Section 5.13 introduces a different approach
to photon number ﬂuctuations, in which δI also derives from ﬂuctuations in the stimulated emission; as
shown in Example 5.8, the two approaches are completely equivalent.

E(t) =
	
I (t)ejφ(t)ejωt =
	
I (t)ejδφ(t)ejω0t,
where ω0 takes into account the constant frequency deviation from (5.64). To obtain the

where we have neglected amplitude ﬂuctuations. Since δφ(t) is stationary,19 the sta-
tistical properties of δφ(t + τ) −δφ(t) are independent of t and therefore coincide
with those of δφ(τ) −δφ(0) ≡δφ(τ), assuming the phase in t = 0 as the reference
phase.
The time average ⟨exp (jδφ(τ))⟩can be now evaluated (from ergodicity) as an

A more suitable formulation can be derived from (5.71) by expressing the ﬁeld inten-

Pout ≈h f n ph

5.11
Laser dynamics and modulation response
A digital data stream can be transmitted through a ﬁber by switching the source on
(ones) and off (zeros), i.e., through the direct modulation of the laser. In LEDs, direct
modulation leads to low maximum speed or modulation bandwidth, limited to a few
hundred Mbps. The situation is potentially better in lasers, due to the expected beneﬁts
from stimulated emission, leading to a shorter carrier lifetime vs. the spontaneous life-
time. However, on–off (or large-signal) laser modulation can be carried out in two ways:
(a) both the zero and the one levels are above threshold; (b) only the one level is above
threshold, while the zero level is below (see Fig. 5.33, left). The second alternative is
inefﬁcient from the standpoint of speed, since, before turn-on, the laser is dominated by
spontaneous recombination; the turn-on time delay is, therefore, of the order of magni-
tude of the spontaneous lifetime. To model large-signal operation above threshold, let
us consider a simpliﬁed situation in which the laser undergoes small-signal modulation
with respect to a bias point above threshold (Fig. 5.33, right).

We anticipate here some conclusions of the analysis. Laser dynamics is generally
described by a dynamic system in the electron and photon densities, that is (at least)
second order. Such a system is nonlinear, but can be linearized for small-signal analysis.
Second-order systems, however, allow for an oscillatory behavior of the solution; we
therefore expect that such a resonant behavior will be found both in the time-domain
on–off switching and in the small-signal response.
Assuming a small-signal resonant behavior, i.e., a low-pass transfer function
(between the input laser current and output power) described by two complex conjugate
poles, the cutoff frequency will be decreasing (as the stimulated lifetime) with increas-
ing photon density and increasing current. In general, this leads to a faster dynamics
than for the LED, with record cutoff frequencies of the order of 30–40 GHz. The the-
oretical (intrinsic) maximum modulation frequency, however, is ultimately limited (as
the stimulated lifetime) by gain compression. Moreover, laser amplitude modulation
implies spurious phase and frequency modulation, denoted as chirp. Chirp leads to
source broadening and limits the practical modulation speed to about 10 Gbps. Direct
laser modulation cannot so far cover long-haul applications, for which external modula-
tion is needed. A qualitative example of large-signal laser dynamic response to a current
pulse (from below threshold) is shown in Fig. 5.34; the initial delay can be suppressed
if the laser is driven by a pulse from above threshold.
The laser small-signal frequency response (see Section 5.12) is described by the

where τn is the total electron lifetime resulting from spontaneous and nonradiative
recombination, and τph is the photon lifetime (5.31); nr = neff is the lasing mode effec-
tive index, Nk0 is the DC photon density of the lasing mode. The parameter dg/dn
is the variation of gain with respect to the carrier density (differential gain); by plot-
ting the maximum gain as a function of the electron density we can derive the linear
approximation
gmax(n) ≈a(n −ntr),
where a is the differential gain and ntr is the transparency charge density; see Fig. 5.35
for an example referring to bulk GaAs.
Since the DC photon density is proportional to the output power, and therefore to the
DC bias current, the resonant frequency (and therefore the laser bandwidth) increases
with the square root of bias current according to the law
fr ∝
	
I −Ith.
However, for large current and photon densities the 3 dB cutoff frequency tends to satu-
rate. Taking into account that the maximum 3 dB bandwidth is achieved when 2ωr = γ
and is equal to the resonant frequency fr, we ﬁnd that the theoretical intrinsic maximum
corresponds to the value (see (5.109)):

The laser modulation bandwidth (see also (5.76)) is therefore positively affected by a
large value of the differential gain, while it is limited by gain compression also for van-
ishingly small photon lifetime. Gain compression has, however, a positive inﬂuence on

the response damping, as seen from (5.77); note that the damping enhancement pro-
vided by gain compression is constant for a given structure, i.e., it does not depend
directly on laser bias.
Although f3dB,max can, in theory, be as high as 100 GHz, in practice the maximum
modulation bandwidths are in the range 20–40 GHz. Moreover, further effects tend to
limit the laser speed under direct modulation, like transport effects (see e.g., [83], Sec-
tion 5.6) and the effect of package and chip parasitics. Figure 5.36 shows the equivalent
circuit of a junction laser, where the package and chip parasitics introduce low-pass ﬁl-
tering. External parasitics can, in practice, limit the frequency response of the laser.
Careful RF design has to be implemented to allow the laser to approach the ideal
intrinsic response.
As already recalled, the laser amplitude modulation also implies spurious phase
(frequency or wavelength) modulation (chirp). Chirp ultimately arises because the
laser current modulation changes the gain proﬁle, but also (from the Kramers–Kronig
relations) the real part of the refractive index. The relative variation n′/g =
(nr/n) / (g/n), where n is the carrier population and n′ is the real part of the
material refractive index, is expressed again through the Henry parameter αH, which we
have already introduced as the line enhancement factor. Common values of this param-
eter are 3–6 in lasers. In Fig. 5.37 a typical plot of the gain vs. the photon energy is
shown; note that the differential gain (proportional, with a constant n, to the abso-
lute variation of the gain g) has a maximum for energies slightly above the maximum
gain energy. Owing to the proﬁle of the real refractive index variation (resulting from
Kramers–Kronig) we obtain that the chirp parameter is typically positive in lasers, apart
from high energies for which it may become negative.
The Henry parameter is related to the frequency deviation according to the following
relation, already introduced in the discussion of the linewidth, see (5.45) and (5.52):

Effect of positive (a) and negative (b) chirp on the transmission of an optical pulse in a

The meaning of positive and negative chirp parameter is further illustrated in Fig. 5.38.
Since the frequency deviation is proportional (through αH) to the relative amplitude
variation with time, a positive αH implies that, in the presence of a square amplitude
pulse, the frequency deviation is positive (blue shift) on the rising pulse front and nega-
tive (red shift) on the settling pulse front; negative chirp leads to the opposite behavior.
In optical ﬁbers operating at 1.5 μm wavelength, the group refractive index ng typi-
cally increases with λ; red shift therefore increases ng and decreases the group velocity;

blue shift, on the contrary, increases the group velocity.20 If we consider the pulse as
traveling in space, positive chirp leads to a fast (blue shift) pulse head and slow (red
shift) pulse tail; this implies pulse broadening and negatively adds to the effect of ﬁber
dispersion. Negative chirp, on the other hand, leads to a slow pulse head and to a fast
pulse tail; the resulting pulse compression can compensate for ﬁber dispersion. In con-
clusion, a controlled amount of negative chirp can be often favorable to system design,
while positive chirp is detrimental. Lasers are characterized by a somewhat large pos-
itive chirp, and therefore their direct modulation does not allow for high speed and/or
long distance ﬁber links.

The chirp is therefore proportional to the injected charge variation and to the input
current modulation amplitude i(t). A larger amplitude leads to a larger chirp, as shown
in Fig. 5.39 [84], and so does a larger modulation frequency.
The chirp introduced so far is denoted as transient chirp, since the frequency devi-
ation vanishes in DC steady-state conditions. However, if we apply a current step to a
laser, the ﬁnal frequency will be slightly different with respect to the initial one, mainly
due to the effect of gain compression; the resulting chirp is called adiabatic chirp and
is an (unwanted) peculiarity of lasers under large-signal modulation.
5.12
Dynamic large-signal and small-signal laser modeling
In this section, we develop a simple, single-mode, laser dynamic model, which will be
exploited to derive DC properties (already analyzed on a heuristic base) and a small-
signal frequency-domain model, yielding the laser frequency response. The laser chirp
can be also derived as a result of the small-signal analysis.
It is convenient to recall a number of deﬁnitions and parameters, which will be
exploited in the following discussion:
• Nk is the photon density of the k-th mode (the dominant lasing mode); NP ≡n ph is
the total photon number in the k-th mode.
• n ≈p (n electron concentration) holds in the active region (quasi-neutrality); N is
the total electron number in the active region.
• d is the thickness of laser active region.
• g(¯hωk) ≈a(n −ntr)(1 + ϵcNk)−1 is the (maximum) material gain as a function of
the electron density, accounting for gain compression.
• ov is the overlap integral.
• nr ≡neff is the effective refractive index of the lasing mode.
• c0 is the speed of light in vacuo.
• βk is the spontaneous emission factor for mode k; it describes the amount of the
spontaneous emission spectrum falling within the linewidth of the lasing mode.
• τr ≡τ sp
n
is the spontaneous radiative lifetime.
• τnr is nonradiative electron lifetime (thermal and Auger); it typically depends on the
electron concentration.
• τph is photon lifetime due to losses outside the active region (αloss) and mirror
(or end) loss, see (5.31). The total lifetime can be split into the external loss (5.32)
and mirror (5.33) contributions as τ −1
ph = τ −1
loss + τ −1
m .
• J is the injected current density.

The deﬁnition of the electron density n and of photon density Nk requires some care.
In the present model n is an average value, with reference to the (almost constant) carrier
density in the active region. Given N as the total electron number in the active region,
we therefore simply deﬁne
n = N/Vac,
(5.80)
where Vac = Ad is the active region volume. Concerning the photon density Nk, this
can be interpreted as the average density of photons in the active region. Taking into
account that the local photon density nk is proportional to the energy of the optical
ﬁeld, we can assume (AR stands for active region, C for the whole cavity):

Let us now introduce two conservation equations (or rate equations), one for the
charge (electron) density n ≈p, the other for the photon density Nk. The charge control

The source term for the photon density associated with stimulated emission is, apart
from the weight ov, the same as the stimulated recombination term in the electron
density rate equation. The same remark holds for the spontaneous emission term (pro-
portional to the nonradiative recombination term in the electron density rate equation

i.e., neglecting gain compression we have γ ≈τphω2
r . The parameter dg/dn|n0 is the
differential gain including the effect of gain compression. We thus see that improve-
ments in the differential gain (obtained, e.g., in QW devices) lead to a higher cutoff
frequency under direct modulation. Taking into account (5.94), we obtain from (5.106)
that the resonant frequency increases with the DC current as

However, a limit to the increase of resonant frequency (and also to the laser cutoff
frequency) with increasing current originates from gain saturation. In fact, according to
the electrical deﬁnition of the 3 dB bandwidth (see Section 6.2.3), this is deﬁned by the
equation:

Under such conditions we have f3dB,max = fr (the response is monotonically decreas-

For τ st

ton lifetime of 1 ps, such a value is still of the order of 100 GHz. However, practical
values of the K parameter (around 0.2–0.6 ns, see, e.g., [11], Section 11.2.1) lead to
maximum cutoff frequencies between 20 and 40 GHz.
5.12.3
Chirp analysis
A variation of the carrier density modulates the cavity gain, but also (due to the
Kramers–Kronig relation) the (effective) complex cavity refractive index neff = nr −
jni. Since the power of the cavity optical ﬁeld propagating in the x direction can be
written as

(5.111)
Typical values of αH are, as already recalled, 3–6 in lasers. From (5.103) we see that
(at least in small-signal conditions) the charge variation increases with the modulating
current intensity and modulation frequency; therefore, a larger chirp is expected for a
larger intensity modulation and modulation speed.
From system (5.102), second equation, and taking into account that the output power
Pout is proportional to the charge density, i.e., Pout ∝Nk0, Pout(ω) ∝Nk(ω), and

Equation (5.112) can be exploited to analyze chirp in two conditions.
In the presence of a fast-varying optical power, the ﬁrst term dominates and leads to
transient chirp. In fact, from (5.111) and (5.112), neglecting Nk, the frequency chirp

which corresponds again to the standard deﬁnition of the Henry parameter in small-
signal conditions, see (5.78) with pout ≡pout. Equations (5.113) or (5.78) can also be
extended to the large-signal regime to deﬁne a time-domain (large-signal) chirp param-
eter; moreover, taking into account that the output optical power is related to the laser
current i(t) through the slope efﬁciency, a ﬁnal expression for the chirp in terms of
time-varying and DC laser currents can be derived as in (5.79).
Chirp in large-signal conditions includes a further effect: due to the dependence of the
emission wavelength on the input current, the high and low digital levels typically cor-
respond to slightly different frequencies. Applying, for instance, a current step leading
the laser from the 0 to the 1 logical state, transient chirp occurs, as already described;
however, the asymptotic frequency deviation is not zero because the 1 state emission
frequency and the 0 state emission frequency are different. Such a residual, steady-state
chirp is called the adiabatic chirp. Adiabatic chirp can be derived taking into account,
from (5.112), that, even in steady-state DC conditions a variation of the bias current
leads to a variation of the photon density Nk and therefore (because of gain compres-
sion) to a decrease of gain that has to be compensated through an increase of the carrier
density n. The resulting frequency deviation will be

and is proportional, as expected, to the gain compression factor ϵc.
5.13
Laser relative intensity noise
The analysis of the laser linewidth in Section 5.10.1 has already stressed that the
(spontaneous and stimulated) emission of photons leads to both phase and amplitude
ﬂuctuations in the optical ﬁeld, and therefore in the output power. Fluctuations in
stimulated emission were associated with gain ﬂuctuations, in turn caused by carrier
population ﬂuctuations. In the present section the issue is addressed anew starting from
the large-signal dynamic system (5.88), (5.89). The ﬂuctuation problem can be treated
according to a well known mathematical formulation (called the Langevin approach), in

5.13 Laser relative intensity noise
331
which random ﬂuctuations of the carrier and photon densities originated by random pho-
ton generation events (and the related carrier recombination events) appear as forcing
terms in the dynamic system for the averages of such quantities.21 Since ﬂuctuations
are small perturbations of the averages, these can be derived through a small-signal
approach, which already led to system (5.102). The procedure consists of the following
steps:
1. Identify the random process describing photon density ﬂuctuations and evalu-
ate its second-order statistical properties (the self-correlation function and power
spectrum). This is called the Langevin source for the photon density ﬂuctuations.
2. Do the same for the carrier density ﬂuctuations and derive the statistical properties
of the corresponding Langevin source (and of its correlation to the Langevin source
for photons).
3. Apply the two random processes introduced above as the Langevin sources to the
small-signal laser dynamic system and obtain, from its solution, the second-order
statistical characterization of the average photon and carrier density ﬂuctuations;
such characterization is suitably derived in the frequency domain as the power (and
correlation) spectrum.
For simplicity, the analysis will be carried out exploiting a small-signal model where
gain compression is neglected (ϵc ≈0). Expressions including gain compression can be
found in [83], Section 5.5.
5.13.1
Analysis of Langevin sources
Let us consider again the electron and photon density rate equations, where, for the sake
of the noise analysis, we separate the contributions due to absorption and stimulated

the absorption α so that the net gain is g = g −α):

The electron and photon populations can be readily interpreted as reservoirs, that are
ﬁlled or emptied by a number of processes listed above. Spontaneous and stimulated
21 For the Langevin analysis of the laser noise based on the photon and carrier rate equations, see, e.g., [83].

332
Sources
radiative processes contribute, at the same time, to emptying the electron reservoir and
ﬁlling the photon reservoir.
Let us consider ﬁrst a simpliﬁed case, in which two particle reservoirs exist with
populations na and nb (populations here are numbers, not densities). Each reservoir
has a generation and a recombination rate (numbers per unit time), as deﬁned by the
following equations:
dna
dt
= Gaa + Gab −Raa −Rab
(5.117)
dnb
dt = Gbb + Gba −Rbb −Rba.
(5.118)
The terms Rii, Gii describe the recombination and generation rates of each reservoir
by itself, while Ri j = G ji deﬁnes the particle transfer a →b or b →a; therefore,
Gab = Rba and Gba = Rab. Moreover, from DC steady-state we obtain
Gaa + Gab −Raa −Rab = Gaa + Rba −Raa −Rab = 0
(5.119)
Gbb + Gba −Rbb −Rba = Gbb + Rab −Rbb −Rba = 0.
(5.120)
Let us now introduce a way to consider the random nature of the generation and
recombination processes, in which particles appear or disappear, respectively, at random
times ti, leading to a ±1 variation of the particle population. Consider, for simplicity, a
single carrier population n affected by an average generation rate G; if generation events
happened at regular intervals, n(t) would be an increasing staircase function of time.
Generation at random times, however, implies that n(t) is affected by ﬂuctuations δn(t)
with respect to the (statistical) average value n, so that n(t) = n + δn(t). The ﬂuctuation
δn(t) is a zero-average random process assuming positive or negative integer values,
so that its time derivative can be expressed as a sum of Dirac delta functions having
(with the same probability) weight αi = ±1. According to the Langevin approach, the
effect of ﬂuctuations on the evolution of n can be derived by adding to the average
dynamic model dn/dt = G a forcing term Fn(t) (the Langevin source) equal to the
time derivative of δn(t):
Fn(t) ≡dδn(t)
dt
=

i
αiδ(t −ti).
(5.121)
The overall dynamic equation for the total population n can be therefore written as
dn
dt = G + Fn(t),
where the Langevin random source gives rise to the ﬂuctuation δn, while the average of
the right-hand side G leads to the average value n (linearly increasing with time). The
above equation can be linearized (if needed, e.g., if G depends on n) with respect to
the average value, so that the response to the Langevin source (small with respect to the
average forcing term) can be recovered through small-signal analysis. The second-order

5.13 Laser relative intensity noise

statistical properties of the zero-average Langevin source (⟨Fn⟩= 0) can be derived
from the autocorrelation function

since generation or recombination events at different times are uncorrelated, and
α2
i = 1. Taking into account that δ(t −ti)δ(t −τ −ti) ̸= 0 only if t −τ = ti and at
the same time t = ti, i.e., with τ = 0, we can write
δ(t −ti)δ(t −τ −ti) = δ(τ)δ(t −ti),

where the summation is extended to all generation events occurring over T . Thus, the
autocorrelation function of Fn is
Rnn(τ) = Gδ(τ),
(5.122)
and by Fourier transforming we immediately derive the white power spectrum of Fn,
Snn(ω), as
Snn(ω) = G.
The power spectrum of the ﬂuctuations associated with the generation process is there-
fore equal to the average value of the generation rate. This result was expected, since Fn
is a Poisson process (like shot noise); the above property is also known as Campbell’s
theorem (see e.g., [34]).
Let us now extend the Langevin source technique to system (5.117) and (5.118) by
introducing the relevant Langevin sources associated with each generation and recom-
bination process (denoted as ki j, k = r, g, i, j = a, b, for a process with average rate
Ki j, K = R, G) and the total Langevin sources Fa and Fb:

where
Fa(t) = gaa(t) + rba(t) + raa(t) −rab(t)
Fb(t) = gbb(t) + rab(t) + rbb(t) −rba(t).
Note that contributions corresponding to particle transitions a →b have the same value
in the total Langevin sources Fa and Fb, but opposite sign (while a particle disappears
from reservoir a, it appears in reservoir b). Since all terms in Fa and Fb are uncorrelated,
the auto- and mutual correlation functions of Fa(t) and Fb(t) can readily be shown to
be expressed as
Raa(τ) = ⟨Fa(t)Fa(t −τ)⟩= (Gaa + Rba + Raa + Rab) δ(τ)
= 2 (Gaa + Rba) δ(τ)
Rbb(τ) = ⟨Fb(t)Fb(t −τ)⟩= (Gbb + Rab + Rbb + Rba) δ(τ)
= 2 (Gbb + Rab) δ(τ)
Rab(τ) = ⟨Fa(t)Fb(t −τ)⟩= −⟨rba(t)rba(t −τ)⟩−⟨rab(t)rab(t −τ)⟩
= −(Rba + Rab) δ(τ),
where we have taken into account the model equation (5.122) along with (5.119)
and (5.120), yielding Gaa + Rba = Raa + Rab and Gbb + Rab = Rbb + Rba. The
corresponding power and correlation spectra are
Saa(ω) = 2 (Gaa + Rba)
Sbb(ω) = 2 (Gbb + Rab)
Sab(ω) = −(Rba + Rab) .
In other words, the power spectrum of the ﬂuctuations in each reservoir is twice the
total generation or recombination rate (equal in steady state) while the correlation spec-
trum is equal to (minus) the sum of the common transition rates (i.e., involving both
reservoirs).
Let us now go back to the laser dynamic system (5.115), (5.116). In order to derive in
a more straightforward way the relevant Langevin sources and their statistical properties
we start, however, by expressing system (5.115), (5.116) in the total photon and electron
numbers, denoted as NP and N. If V is the modal volume of photon mode k, with
density Nk, and Vac = A · d is the active-region volume (by deﬁnition, Vac = ovV ,
see (5.80) and (5.81)) we have NP = V Nk, and N = Vacn. Thus, multiplying (5.115)
by Vac and (5.116) by V , the dynamic system becomes

Example 5.8: Show that the autocorrelation function of the photon number ﬂuctua-
tion Langevin source (5.131), can also be directly obtained from the treatment in
Section 5.10.1, provided that we consider, as the generation process, only spontaneous
emission.
From the analysis in Section 5.10.1 we found that the emission of a single pho-
ton with random phase θi leads to a photon number ﬂuctuation δI = 2

I cos(θi) +

I cos(θi); see (5.57). Note that with this simpliﬁcation the ensemble aver-
age of δI is zero. Using the template equation for the deﬁnition of the Langevin

source FI as

unit time, after a time T the total emission number will be rsp

distributed, ⟨FI⟩= 0. The autocorrelation function of FI reduces to

since emission events occurring at different times are completely uncorrelated. Taking

therefore conclude that the Langevin source for photon number ﬂuctuations can be
derived by considering as “equivalent” ﬂuctuation events the spontaneous emissions
only.
5.13.2
Carrier and photon population ﬂuctuations
According to the Langevin approach to ﬂuctuation analysis, we start from the dynamic
system with random Langevin sources (5.132), (5.133) and evaluate the small-signal
response to Fn and Fk (deﬁned in (5.134) and with power and correlation spectra
(5.135), (5.136) and (5.137)), setting to zero all deterministic forcing terms (such as the
small-signal current source). This is equivalent to rewriting the small-signal dynamic

system (5.102) with zero impressed current density but including the Langevin sources;
the notation is also suitably modiﬁed by introducing the ﬂuctuations δn(ω) and δNk(ω),
and gain compression has been neglected (ϵc = 0, δc = 1):

5.13.3
Output power ﬂuctuations
On the basis of the above discussion, the photon density in the cavity can be modeled
as a random process with average Nk0 and ﬂuctuation δNk:
Nk(t) = Nk0 + δNk(t),
where the ﬂuctuation has the Fourier representation (5.141) as a function of the
Langevin sources Fn and Fk. The cavity output power depends on the photon ﬂux

transmitted by the mirrors. Since photons disappear from the cavity because of the
mirror loss with a lifetime τm (mirror loss lifetime), the average transmitted power is
related to the average photon number as
Pout = ¯hω V Nk0
τm
.
However, the ﬂuctuation in the instantaneous output power, denoted for brevity as
δP(t), does not depend only on the cavity photon density ﬂuctuations δNk. In fact, the
exterior of the cavity can be considered as another reservoir fed by an average “photon
generation rate” V Nk0/τm. Since photons escape the cavity through mirrors at random
times, mirror transmission is a cause of ﬂuctuations in the number of transmitted pho-
tons, which again can be modeled through a shot noise approach. Let us deﬁne such
power ﬂuctuations in terms of the random process Fpn(t), with autocorrelation Rpn(τ)
(pn stands for partition noise due to mirrors). Expressing the random processes in terms
of particle number ﬂuctuations we have, from the Campbell theorem,

, the process Fk = FP/V , see (5.134), is the Langevin force for pho-
ton density ﬂuctuations. The only part physically correlated with Fpn is the ﬂuctuation
related to mirror losses. Reducing Fk and Fpn to particle number ﬂuctuations we con-
clude that the correlated part is indeed the same process, with average value V Nk0/τm

ﬂuctuation in the output power. Substituting into (5.145) SδNkδNk(ω) from (5.144) and

H →0 the power spectrum of power ﬂuctuations cannot be lower than ¯hωPout; this

the laser signal is then detected by a photodetector. In the ON state the laser power is
Pout and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at the detector output (assuming the detector is
noiseless) is given by

i.e., the low-frequency value of RIN decreases vs. Pout, at low power, by 30 dB per
decade. At high power, on the other hand, the RIN decreases vs. Pout by 10 dB per
decade, ultimately reaching the shot noise limit. It can readily be shown that the RIN
increases from a low-frequency plateau, peaks at the resonance frequency ωr and then
decreases to the shot noise limit at very high frequency. If we assume that the shot
noise contribution is negligible at low frequency, the peak and low-frequency RIN are
proportional, and the peak RIN decreases with increasing power. Since the resonant
value is typically much larger than the low-frequency value, bandwidth limitations are
required at the receiver to limit the effect on the laser noise.22

is clearly visible and for very large frequency the RIN decreases down to the shot
noise limit. The small-signal response and the RIN response are closely related as far
as the peak is concerned, see Fig. 5.41; notice that the resonant frequency increases
with the laser power, but also the damping factor. For the largest power we notice a

Phase noise and linewidth from the Langevin approach

of the Langevin approach. From (5.111) we have, replacing ﬁnite differences with
differentials:
d f = αH
4π ova c0
nr
dn.
(5.152)
Interpreting variations as ﬂuctuations (d f →δf ) and taking into account that frequency
ﬂuctuations are proportional to the derivative of phase ﬂuctuations δφ, we can obtain
from (5.152) a rate equation for δφ:
dδφ(t)
dt
= 2πδf (t) = αH
2 ova c0
nr
δn(t) + Fφ(t).
where the ﬁrst term in the r.h.s., proportional to δφ, is related to the modulation of
the cavity effective index, while the Langevin force Fφ(t) expresses single-photon
ﬂuctuations. In the frequency domain we have
δf (ω) = αH
4π ova c0
nr
δn(ω) + 1
2π Fφ(ω).
(5.153)
We now analyze the Langevin force Fφ. From the linewidth analysis, we already found
that photon ﬂuctuations lead to a direct phase ﬂuctuation δφ′′ and to an indirect contri-
bution δφ′ related to amplitude ﬂuctuations via the Henry parameter. We do not consider
the latter contribution δφ′, because this is included, see (5.153), in the term proportional
to δn(t). We already found that (see (5.59) with a slightly different notation)
δφ′′ ≈

where θ is a uniformly distributed random angle and I is the photon number. The
Langevin term corresponding to a set of spontaneous photon emissions (stimulated
emissions are coherent and do not cause direct phase ﬂuctuations) is therefore

o /Vac is again the recombination rate per unit volume leading to

tude variations are coherent, and therefore yield zero-phase variation; conversely,
ﬁeld ﬂuctuations providing only phase variations are in quadrature, and therefore
lead to zero-magnitude ﬂuctuation; thus, the phase and amplitude (or photon num-
ber) ﬂuctuations are uncorrelated. Similarly, carrier number ﬂuctuations are uncor-
related with direct phase ﬂuctuations related to the Langevin force Fφ. Taking into

But, how does the frequency behavior of the frequency ﬂuctuations spectrum (and in
particular the resonant peaks) impact on the laser spectral output shape and linewidth?
We start from the expression of the optical ﬁeld power spectrum:
SE(ω) =
 ∞
−∞
RE(τ) exp(−jωτ) dτ.
The autocorrelation RE(τ) can be expressed, neglecting intensity noise, as in (5.67);
combining (5.67) and (5.68), in the hypothesis that δφ is gaussian, we obtain that RE(τ)
can be expressed as a function of the process variance σδφ:
RE(τ) = Iejω0τe−σδφ/2.
(5.156)
We can generally write the variance σδφ as follows:
σδφ(τ) =
(
δφ2)
= ⟨[δφ(t + τ) −δφ(t)] [δφ(t + τ) −δφ(t)]⟩

−2 ⟨δφ(t + τ)δφ(t)⟩

where Rδφδφ(τ) is the autocorrelation function of δφ. The related power spectrum
can be derived from the power spectrum of frequency ﬂuctuations (5.155) as Sδφδφ =
ω−2Sδf δf . Taking into account that

The variance therefore exhibits a ﬁrst term increasing with |τ|, which has already been
derived in the simpliﬁed analysis (see Section 5.10.1, Eq. (5.65)). The Langevin tech-
nique further suggests the presence of a damped oscillatory component (note that the
constant term is such as to lead to σδφ(0) = 0).
Example 5.11: Evaluate the integral A in (5.157) by contour integration.

as already derived in Section 5.10.1.
The effect of the oscillatory component of σδφ(τ) cannot be readily expressed in
closed form, since the resulting integral does not admit a representation in terms of
elementary functions.
Considering, however, that the kernel of the integrand includes the exponential of an
oscillating function, we can assume that the effect on the resulting power spectrum SE
is somewhat similar to the spectrum of a frequency-modulated signal with modulation
frequency ωR. Qualitatively, the power spectrum will have a Lorentzian shape around
ω0 plus sidebands corresponding to ω0 ± kωR with k integer. However, the sideband
amplitude is typically very small, so that the linewidth is, in practical cases, unaffected,
as shown in Fig. 5.42 [81]; note that the resonance peaks decrease with increasing laser
power, while the displacement of the peaks increases, consistent with the fact that ωR
increases with increasing output power.

Modulators
6.1
Light modulation and modulator choices
LEDs and lasers biased at a constant current emit CW (continuous wave) light with
constant average optical power. To transmit information we need to modulate the light
source by changing its amplitude and/or phase. For simplicity, we will consider only
intensity modulation (IM), where digital or analog information is associated with the
light’s instantaneous power. In digital IM, binary symbols are associated with intervals
of high (ON state) or low (OFF state) optical power; the power ratio between the ON
and OFF states is the extinction or contrast ratio (ER or CR), while the maximum
bit rate (maximum bandwidth) of the modulation process is the modulation speed (or
modulation bandwidth).
Light modulation can be internal (direct) or external (indirect). Direct modulation
is based on the modulation of the instantaneous bias point of the light source (LED or
laser); the solution is compact, since no additional external device is required, but has
worse extinction ratio and a higher chirp (i.e., spurious frequency modulation associ-
ated with the intensity modulation) than indirect modulation schemes. The modulation
bandwidth is very limited (below 1 Gbps) in LEDs, much wider (up to 10 Gbps in the
ﬁeld) for lasers.
External (indirect) modulation requires an additional (sometimes large and sepa-
rately packaged) voltage-driven device, the light modulator, acting as a light switch;
see Fig. 6.1. The advantages are a higher extinction ratio, lower chirp (ideally zero in
some devices), and higher bit rate (above 40 Gbps).
Several solutions exist for the external modulation; the devices of choice today are
the electrooptic modulator (EOM) and the electroabsorption modulator (EAM). Both
EAMs and EOMs are able to achieve high-speed operation; commercially available
devices exist for 40 Gbps systems. Among less conventional modulator choices we
mention the current-driven variable-gain semiconductor optical ampliﬁers (SOAs); the
resulting amplitude modulator has large chirp and the contrast ratio is dominated by the
gain control dynamics, but, the modulator is active, i.e., it can provide power ampliﬁ-
cation. In what follows, however, attention will be focused on conventional EOM and
EAM modulator approaches.

Electrooptic modulators exploit the modulation of material’s refractive index induced
by an electric ﬁeld.1 The electric ﬁeld is induced by a voltage applied to a semiconduc-
tor junction in reverse bias, or to an electrode system deposited on a dielectric having
electrooptic properties. Although several possible applications of this principle in
speciﬁc devices exist, the most popular today is the Mach–Zehnder (MZ) interfero-
metric modulator, in which IM is carried out through the constructive or destructive
interference of two phase-modulated beams. EOMs can be implemented with several
electrooptic materials: piezoelectric (perovskites), semiconductor (GaAs, InP, SiGe),
and more recently polymers and Si. Compared with EAMs, EOMs generally have lower
chirp, higher optical saturation power, and wider optical bandwidth (up to 100 nm); the
same device can thus modulate different WDM channels. The optical insertion loss is
typically low, since the absorption of the material is negligible (not always, however, in
semiconductor modulators). Perovskite-based modulators exhibit interaction lengths up
to 1–2 cm and are therefore large, packaged devices, with little perspective for integra-
tion; the on–off voltage is typically high (5 V for high-speed devices), thus requiring a
complex high-speed, wideband ampliﬁer as a driver. Semiconductor EOMs are smaller
(down to 500 μm) and can be integrated (with some difﬁculty) with the laser source in
the so-called EOL (electrooptic integrated laser).
Electroabsorption modulators are based on the modulation of the material absorp-
tion by an electric ﬁeld, typically induced by a voltage applied to a semiconductor pin
junction in reverse bias. In the ON state, absorption is low and light travels almost unaf-
fected through the device; in the OFF state, absorption is high and the EAM operates as
a photodiode with a long active region, so that the unabsorbed light escaping from the
device is negligible. Absorption modulation can occur in bulk semiconductors through
the Franz–Keldysh effect (FKE) or in a quantum well (QW) via the quantum conﬁned
Stark effect (QCSE). Owing to the greater strength of the QCSE, QW-based modu-
lators have better extinction ratio than bulk modulators. EAMs generally have larger
chirp than EOMs; moreover, while in the latter chirp is dominated by the device geom-
etry, in EAMs (as in lasers) it is uniquely determined by the material properties. The
EAM optical bandwidth is moderately narrow for FKE-based devices (typical values
1 The refractive index variation can also be induced by injected charge; this effect was exploited in the design
of Si-based electrooptic modulators, see Section 6.6.2.

Modulators
are around 10 nm, but record 40 nm bandwidths have also been demonstrated in EAMs
integrated with tunable lasers, see [85]) and very narrow, single-channel, for QCSE-
based devices. QCSE-based EAMs are small (interaction length below 500 μm) and
potentially have lower on–off voltages (e.g., 2 V or less). Integration with the source
is possible and highly convenient in QCSE-based EAMs, where the optical bandwidth
is closely matched to the speciﬁc source; this device, also referred to as the EAL or
electroabsorption integrated laser, is gaining increasing popularity due to its superior
performance vs. direct modulation, which is obtained while preserving the source’s
compactness.
From a physical standpoint, both EAMs and EOMs exploit the modulation of the
material refractive index induced by the E-ﬁeld; in EOMs the modulation of the real
part nr is used, whereas EAMs are based on the modulation of the imaginary part ni.
However, nr and ni are related via to the Kramers–Kronig relations, and so is their vari-
ation in the presence of an applied ﬁeld. Such an interdependence is the basic cause of
chirp in EAMs (as in lasers), since in this device intensity modulation implies a certain
amount of phase modulation. In EOMs, on the other hand, the absorption coefﬁcient is
so low (both in the perovskite and in the semiconductor case) that its variation has no
appreciable inﬂuence on the device performance; in such devices chirp originates from
the device geometry and dissymmetry.
6.2
Modulator parameters
Modulators (electrooptic or electroabsorption) are characterized by a number of system
parameters; some of these can be speciﬁc to the digital or analog nature of the IM. In
digital IM, the optical carrier is modulated by a baseband bit sequence whose frequency
bandwidth ideally extends from DC (or a few hundred kHz) to a maximum frequency
B related to the baseband bit rate Rb; for simplicity we will assume B ≈Rb. In analog
IM, on the other hand, an analog, often narrowband, signal modulates the optical carrier.
Analog IM is in principle compatible with a modulating system having narrow mod-
ulation bandwidth but high central frequency; digital IM requires instead a modulating
system whose bandwidth ranges approximately from DC to Rb.2 Moreover, analog
modulation should ideally be a linear process; since practical modulators are not linear,
analog operation typically occurs under small-signal conditions. Modulator linearity
and distortion are important parameters in analog IM, less so in digital IM.
6.2.1
Electrooptic (static) response
The electrooptic response, also called the transmission characteristics or switching
curve, is the ratio of the output and input light intensity or power vs. the electrical
2 In practice, however, special-purpose, narrowband analog modulators are uncommon, and wideband
devices are typically exploited both for digital and analog modulation.

.
Typical EOM and EAM responses are shown in Fig. 6.2. In EOMs the response is
periodic vs. the input voltage, while in EAMs it is ideally monotonic (however, in real
devices the response often has a broad minimum, and then increases for large values of
Vin). A number of characteristic parameters can be derived from T (Vin).
The off-state voltage, VOFF (often called Vπ with reference to EOM operation, see
Section 6.4.2) is the voltage required to turn off the input light at the output with a
speciﬁc extinction or contrast ratio ER > 1 (see later); i.e., in natural and log units:
T (VON)/T (VOFF) = ER
T (VON)|dB −T (VOFF)|dB = ER|dB = 10 log10 ER.
The on-state voltage VON (often VON ≈0) corresponds to maximum transmission. In
practice T (VON) < 1, since the modulator is affected by a residual modulator loss in
the ON state called the optical insertion loss Lop:
Lop = Pout(VON)
Pin
≡T (VON).
Finally VSW = VOFF −VON ≈VOFF is the on–off voltage, also called the switching
voltage.
The extinction ratio or contrast ratio ER > 1 or ER|dB > 0 (also referred to as CR)
is the ratio of the ON state output light intensity to the OFF state output light intensity. It
describes the ability of the modulator to switch the input light down to a speciﬁc level.
Due to the response periodicity, for the EOM the extinction ratio is uniquely deﬁned as
ER|dB = T (0)|dB −T (Vπ)|dB .

360
Modulators
In EAMs, the extinction ratio increases with VOFF; therefore, VOFF refers to a speciﬁc
ER (e.g., we deﬁne VOFF@7 dB, meaning the OFF voltage that yields an extinction ratio
of 7 dB).
6.2.2
Dynamic response
The dynamic large-signal response is the electrooptic modulator response when the
input signal is time-varying and has arbitrary amplitude. Since the static modulator
response is not strictly linear, see Fig. 6.2, and modulator structures typically include
memory effects, the modulator large-signal dynamic response should generally be mod-
eled by a dynamic nonlinear system; this implies that the response changes according to
both the speed and the amplitude of the input driving signal. In digital applications, the
large-signal response is often represented in terms of the output eye diagram with dif-
ferent input signal speeds. In most practical cases, the dynamic response has a low-pass
frequency behavior, i.e., the modulator response deteriorates with increasing input bit
rate. In order to rigorously deﬁne the frequency-domain response, we can conveniently
investigate the modulator behavior in linear, small-signal operation.
6.2.3
Small-signal frequency response
To deﬁne the small-signal modulator frequency response, assume a (small-signal) sinu-
soidal input voltage at angular frequency ω (the modulation frequency) superimposed
to a bias voltage Vin,DC:
vin(t) = Vin,DC +vin(t) = Vin,DC + Re
Vin exp (jωt)

,
where Vin is the phasor associated with the small-signal input voltage. Since the system
operates, according to the small-signal assumption, in linearity, the optical instanta-
neous output power will have a DC and a harmonic modulation component at ω, as
Pout(t) = Pout,DC + pout(t) = Pout,DC + Re
Pout exp (jωt)

.
Pout is a complex phasor, whose phase expresses the phase difference between the
input voltage and the output (small-signal) modulation component of the optical power;
see Fig. 6.3. The complex transfer function M(ω) = Pout/Vin can be assumed as the
small-signal frequency response of the modulator, often normalized (considering only
the magnitude) to the low-frequency or DC value as m(ω) = |M(ω)/M(0)|.
The limit value M(0) can be derived from linearizing the DC electrooptic response.
In fact, in quasi-static conditions (DC, low frequency) where memory effects are
negligible, we have (vin(t) = Vin,DC +vin(t))

See Fig. 6.3 for the meaning of ̸ M. The modulation frequency response m(ω) is usu-

only the amplitude of the response is considered:
m(ω) =

The modulation response m(ω) is often described in log units, according to two dif-

deﬁnition of m(ω); in natural units we have, assuming a frequency-independent input
voltage Vin,

Thus, the electrical and optical deﬁnitions are related as mel(ω)|dB = 2 mop(ω)

According to another common notation, the optical deﬁnition is expressed in dBo
(optical dB) and the electrical deﬁnition in dBe (electrical dB). One has, therefore,
mel,op(ω)

dB ≡m(ω)|dBe,dBo ,
respectively; it follows that
m(ω)|dBe = 2 m(ω)|dBo .
6.2.4
Optical and electrical modulation bandwidth
From m(ω) the bandwidth can be derived, according to the optical (electrical) deﬁni-
tion of the response, as the modulation frequency f3dB,op ( f3dB,el) at which the optical
(electrical) response has a 3 dB decay with respect to the low-frequency value:

(6.5)
From the deﬁnition we see that an optical 3 dB bandwidth corresponds to an electrical
6 dB bandwidth, while an electrical 3 dB bandwidth corresponds to an optical 1.5 dB
bandwidth. Due to the low-pass modulator behavior, the optical 3 dB bandwidth is wider
than the electrical 3 dB bandwidth.

6.2 Modulator parameters
363
6.2.5
Chirp
The chirp, or instantaneous frequency deviation, is the spurious frequency modulation
f of the intensity-modulated output light with respect to the input light. Usually, the
frequency deviation is expressed through the help of the Henry parameter αH, see (5.40)
and (5.52). In large-signal conditions the Henry parameter generally is a function of
time, while it is constant (and bias point dependent) in small-signal operation. The EOM
chirp depends only on device geometry, while in EAMs chirp depends, as in lasers, on
material parameters. However, while digitally modulated lasers exhibit both transient
and adiabatic chirp (Section 5.12.3), EAMs have only transient chirp; moreover, the
EAM Henry parameter is typically smaller than in lasers.
6.2.6
Optical bandwidth
The optical bandwidth (not to be confused with the optical deﬁnition of the modulation
bandwidth) is the photon wavelength range on which the modulator operates within
speciﬁcations.
6.2.7
Electrical or RF input matching
The RF input matching is deﬁned in terms of the modulator input reﬂection coefﬁcient,
seen from the electrical input port:
in = Zin −ZG
Zin + ZG
,
where Zin is the modulator input impedance and ZG is the generator impedance (here
real, often 50 ). From the power reﬂection coefﬁcient |in|2 one can also deﬁne
the RF input insertion loss, i.e., the power loss resulting from the input reﬂection
1 −|in|2. Typical design values for the power input reﬂection coefﬁcient are below
−10 dB or |in| ≈
√
0.1 = 0.32. Note that input matching can be a difﬁcult problem in
modulators, owing to their broadband behavior.
6.2.8
Linearity and distortion
Analog modulators can be characterized in terms of signal distortion caused by the
nonlinearity of the electrooptic response T (vin). The response can be expanded in power
series of vin around a bias point and a number of ﬁgures of merit can be deﬁned, related
to the generation of harmonics in the presence of a sinusoidal single-tone input signal
(harmonic distortion), or to the generation of intermodulation products in the presence
of two or more closely spaced sinusoidal input signals (intermodulation distortion).3
3 Given two input tones f1 and f2, the intermodulation products (IMPs) are output frequencies m f1 ± nf2
where m and n are integers. Third-order IMPs with a minus sign (2 f1 −f2 and 2 f2 −f1) are particularly
important since they fall close to the signal bandwidth, and are the main cause of nonlinear distortion.

364
Modulators
The intermodulation distortion also deﬁnes the upper limit of the spurious-free dynamic
range (SFDR).4
6.3
Electrooptic modulators
Electrooptic modulators are based on the modulation of the material refractive index
from the electric ﬁeld, induced by an applied input voltage. A simpliﬁed setup is shown
in Fig. 6.5, consisting of a capacitor, whose dielectric is a slab of electrooptic mate-
rial. In static conditions, the input voltage applied to the capacitor is Vin = VG, and the
related electric ﬁeld has magnitude E = VG/h, where h is the distance between the
metal plates. The induced index variation n ∝E ∝VG linearly modulates the phase
of the optical wave crossing the capacitor, with a phase variation φ ∝VG. Amplitude
modulation can be obtained from phase modulation by making two phase-modulated
beams interfere constructively or destructively. This is the principle of the Mach–
Zehnder modulator; other solutions include polarization-based modulators, where the
applied ﬁeld changes the ﬁeld polarization and an output polarizer blocks the optical
ﬁeld in the OFF state, and directional coupler modulators, where the applied ﬁeld
changes the state of an optical directional coupler from transmission (ON state) to
coupling (OFF state).
Several electrooptic materials are available for implementing electrooptic modu-
lators: ferroelectric crystals having piezoelectric properties, such as lithium niobate
(LiNbO3, often denoted as LN, probably the most important material today), lithium
tantalate, barium titanate, in bulk or thin ﬁlm; semiconductors (GaAs and InP);
and ﬁnally electrooptic polymers. Silicon-based modulators have been proposed for
exploiting the refractive index change resulting from charge injection.
Semiconductors exhibit a weaker electrooptic effect than ferroelectric crystals, but the
related structures are able to enhance the induced electric ﬁeld due to junction effects
(i.e., the applied voltage acts across a very short distance, as in the intrinsic region of
a pin structure). Moreover, QW and MQW structures can be exploited to tailor the
material response. In the next sections, we will focus on the implementation of the
phase modulation part of the device in different materials; the Mach–Zehnder amplitude
modulator structure will be discussed in Section. 6.4.
Since the phase modulation structure in Fig. 6.5 is, from the electrical standpoint,
a capacitor, the modulation bandwidth is limited by the RC cutoff (the resistance is
the generator resistance RG). Concentrated structures achieve in practice, with realistic
driving voltages, speeds of only a few Gbps; high-speed modulators are based on a
distributed, traveling-wave approach (see Section 6.5).
4 The SFDR is the input power or voltage interval in which the system operates with a signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) compatible with the system speciﬁcations (lower limit), and with acceptable distortion (upper limit).
Several deﬁnitions of the upper limit are available (e.g., the input power at which the intermodulation level
at the system output equals the noise output level).

Lithium niobate electrooptic modulators
Lithium niobate (LiNbO3) is an anisotropic uniaxial crystal (for the properties of lithium
niobate and other electrooptic materials, see, e.g., [55], Table 9.2). The material permit-
tivity is a tensor (whose rectangular components can be assembled in a 3 × 3 matrix),
which becomes diagonal when the reference system corresponds to the crystal princi-
pal axes. Since the crystal is uniaxial, one of the principal axes (called the optical or
extraordinary axis) is ﬁxed, while the two other axes (called the ordinary axes) can be
chosen arbitrarily in the plane orthogonal to the optical (extraordinary) axis. In such a
reference frame (let x and y be the ordinary axes, z the extraordinary axis), the dielectric
permittivity is a diagonal matrix:
ϵ = ϵ0ϵr = ϵ0

where
ϵx = n2

ϵz = n2

The two refractive indices no and ne are the ordinary and extraordinary indices, respec-
tively. Due to material dispersion, the RF or microwave values and the optical values
are quite different. At RF:
ϵxm = n2
om = 43 →nom =
√
43 = 6.56
ϵzm = n2
em = 28 →nem =
√
28 = 5.29.
The optical values, on the other hand, are much lower:
noo = 2.35,
neo = 2.25.

Modulators
A further effect to be considered is the strong frequency dispersion that LN exhibits
(due to its piezoelectric nature) from DC to RF:
ϵx DC = n2
oDC = 85 →noDC =
√
85 = 9.22 ≫nom = 6.56
ϵzDC = n2
eDC = 29 →neDC =
√
29 = 5.38 ≈nem = 5.29.
At low frequency piezoelectricity increases the dielectric response, but at RF and above
the associated mechanical effects are under cutoff, leading to a marked dispersion of
the dielectric parameters. This may cause an anomalous modulator response at low-
frequency (e.g., in the MHz range).
Due to the electrooptic effect, the elements of the (relative) permittivity matrix ϵr, ϵi j,
are a function of the applied ﬁeld components Ek. Such a function can be conveniently
expressed by expanding the variation of 1/ϵi j in power series as

optic tensor r (dimension 3 × 3 × 3, 27 components), and si jkl are the elements of the
quadratic electrooptic tensor s (dimension 3 × 3 × 3 × 3, 81 components). Since in LN
the linear electrooptic effect (also called the Pockels effect) dominates over the quadratic
effect (also called the Kerr effect), we will focus on the former and write

where we have associated, with each element of the relative permittivity matrix, a refrac-
tive index such as ϵi j = n2
i j, and have further assumed that the variation is small, so that
it can be obtained by applying derivation rules. The linear electrooptic tensor elements
satisfy reciprocity, independently of the applied ﬁeld; this implies ri jk = r jik, so that
only 18 elements out of 27 are independent. To simplify the notation, the contracted
index representation is introduced: the 18 independent elements are assembled into a
3 × 6 matrix by contracting the ﬁrst two indices i j into a unique index i according to
the rules:
i j = 11 →i = 1
i j = (23, 32) →i = 4
i j = 22 →i = 2
i j = (31, 13) →i = 5
i j = 33 →i = 3
i j = (21, 12) →i = 6.

(6.7)
Let us now consider the LN case in detail. We express the permittivity in the prin-
cipal axis reference system and associate the indices (1, 2, 3) with the rectangular axes
(x, y, z), where z is the optical or extraordinary axis, and x, y are the ordinary axes.
Due to LN crystal symmetry, most of the elements in r are zero, some are equal; the
only nonzero elements have values:5
r13 = r23 = 9 pm/V
r33 = r51 = r42 = 30 pm/V
r22 = −r12 = −r61 = 6.6 pm/V.
In general, an applied ﬁeld will change all the components of the permittivity matrix,
thus leading to a change of the principal axes. We conﬁne the analysis to the case rele-
vant to applications and assume that the applied ﬁeld is directed along the optical axis,
i.e., that Ez ≡E3 ̸= 0 while both Ex = E1 = 0 and Ey = E2 = 0. In this case, consid-
ering only the nonzero elements of r, (6.7) yields (for clarity, we partly revert to the
expanded index notation in rectangular coordinates):
nxx = nyy = no = −n3
o
2 r13Ez
nzz = ne = −n3
e
2 r33Ez
nyz = nxz = nxy = 0.
With such a choice of the applied electric ﬁeld, the off-diagonal elements of the per-
mittivity matrix are always zero, and the principal axes do not vary with respect to the
zero-ﬁeld case. Moreover, the largest element r33 is exploited, leading to a variation of
the extraordinary index ne; the ordinary index no exhibits a smaller variation.
The applied ﬁeld conﬁguration described above can be implemented in LN mod-
ulators by properly arranging the optical waveguide and electrode settings. Optical
waveguides can be realized in a LN substrate by diffusion of titanium (Ti) at 1000◦C
for 4–10 hours. The Ti diffusion slightly increases the LN refractive index, yielding a
waveguide with approximate Gaussian refractive index proﬁle. Typical diffusion widths
are of the order of 5–10 μm, leading to a comparable optical mode spot size in the
waveguide plane. Concerning the waveguide orientation with respect to the crystal axes,
two solutions can be implemented:
• In the Z-cut conﬁguration, the optical axis is orthogonal to the crystal surface and
the waveguide axis is parallel to the x or y axes (remember that such ordinary axes
are arbitrary); see Fig. 6.6(left). The optical mode polarization is transverse magnetic

the modal refractive index is nT M ≈ne. Application of a RF electric ﬁeld along the

• In the X-cut conﬁguration, the optical axis is parallel to the crystal surface and
orthogonal to the waveguide axis; see Fig. 6.6(right). The waveguide axis runs along
x (or y), while the crystal surface is orthogonal to y (or x), respectively. The opti-
cal mode polarization is transverse electric (TE); i.e., the electric ﬁeld polarization
is again along the optical axis, this time horizontal. In such conditions, the modal
refractive index is nT E ≈ne. Application of a RF electric ﬁeld along the z axis (par-
allel to the optical ﬁeld and to the crystal surface) leads to a variation of the modal
refractive index:

the same as in the Z-cut case. The Y-cut conﬁguration is of course equivalent to the
X-cut one.
The Z-cut and X-cut conﬁgurations appear to be altogether equivalent from the stand-
point of the optical waveguide; however, the RF electrode setting needed to create a
properly oriented electric ﬁeld is different. In fact, in Z-cut substrates the optical ﬁeld
must interact with a perpendicular RF ﬁeld, so that both the coplanar waveguide (all
electrodes on the crystal surface) and the microstrip (one electrode on the surface, a
ground plane on the crystal bottom) conﬁgurations are possible. On the other hand, in
X-cut substrates the interaction is with the parallel component of the microwave ﬁeld,
so that only a coplanar electrode conﬁguration is feasible. The RF ﬁeld lines and opti-
cal waveguide position are sketched in Fig. 6.7 for the Z-cut and X-cut conﬁgurations,
respectively. In the Z-cut case, the optical ﬁeld must interact with the vertical electric
ﬁeld, and therefore the waveguide position is below the RF electrode. In this way, the
ﬁeld strength is maximum, but at the same time a dielectric buffer must be inserted
between the optical waveguide and the metal electrode to avoid large optical losses in

the TM mode. As discussed in Section 6.6, introduction of a dielectric buffer is also
needed to improve the synchronous coupling between the RF and optical mode in a dis-
tributed modulator. In the X-cut case, the waveguide has to interact with the horizontal
ﬁeld, so that it must be located between the electrodes. No dielectric buffer is needed in
principle to avoid losses, but the ﬁeld strength is somewhat lower than in the Z-cut case.
Notice that both the X-cut and Z-cut conﬁgurations are polarization dependent, i.e., the
interaction requires TE or TM polarized ﬁelds. From a system standpoint, this implies
that the polarization of the input optical signal or carrier has to be established through a
polarization-maintaining (PM) ﬁber.
The Z-cut conﬁguration has approximately a 30% advantage over the X-cut one in
terms of interaction strength; however, Z-cut operation is affected by problems con-
nected with static induced charge: due to the piezoelectric nature of the material, a
static charge is induced on the free surfaces orthogonal to the optical axis. In the Z-cut
conﬁguration, a layer of induced charge slowly builds up on the top surface, where elec-
trodes are located; the induced static ﬁeld is superimposed on the applied bias, leading
to long-term ﬂuctuations in the bias point that may compromise the device operation
and reliability. In the X-cut conﬁguration, on the other hand, charge buildup occurs on
the two lateral surfaces (the LN edges), which are contacted by the device package and
can be suitably metallized so as to short induced ﬁelds. In the X-cut conﬁguration, there-
fore, charge build up is ineffective and the bias point does not experience slow drifts.
Suppression of the bias drift can be obtained in the Z-cut conﬁguration by depositing a
resistive layer, called the charge bleed layer, on the top surface; the layer redistributes
the excess induced charge, while its resistance is large enough not to compromise RF
operation and biasing. Charge bleed layers can be implemented, for example, through
polysilicon sputtering.
A last point to be considered is the fact that both the RF and optical ﬁeld inten-
sity are nonuniform over the interaction region. To relate the external applied voltage
to the variation of the modal refractive index, we introduce the overlap integral mo
between the microwave and optical ﬁelds. Consider, the wave equation for the modal
electric ﬁeld (assume, for example, the TE mode; the same treatment applies for

This is equivalent to postulating a uniform equivalent RF ﬁeld Ez = −moVA/G. The
overlap integral is equal to unity if the ﬁeld is uniform (as in a parallel-plate conﬁgura-
tion, in which the gap coincides with the distance between the two plates). For the TM
ﬁeld, the principle is the same but the relevant overlap integral may be different due to
the different optical ﬁeld pattern.
A concluding remark concerns the RF propagation characteristics of a coplanar elec-
trode conﬁguration deposited on LN substrate. Such a coplanar waveguide supports
a quasi-TEM propagation mode, in which the electric and magnetic ﬁelds lie almost
entirely in the transverse plane. The refractive index in the transmission line cross sec-
tion (corresponding to the plane determined by the ordinary and extraordinary axes both
in the Z-cut and in the X-cut conﬁgurations) is anisotropic, but the quasi-TEM mode
effective microwave propagation index nm is given simply by7

(6.11)
The RF index nm is therefore much larger than the optical refractive index nT E/T M ≡
no ≈2.2. Since the RF phase velocity is about twice as large as the optical phase
velocity, nm must be suitably decreased in order to achieve synchronous coupling in
distributed modulators; see Section 6.6.
6 The deﬁnition of the overlap integral is consistent with (5.18), introducing the same parameter for a dielec-
tric slab waveguide, where n (in the laser case, the variation is related to the material gain) is assumed as
uniform in the active region.
7 The parameters of a coplanar waveguide on a semi-inﬁnite dielectric substrate, such that two principal axes
are parallel and perpendicular to the dielectric surface, respectively, with permittivities ϵ1 and ϵ2, can be
shown to coincide with the parameters of the same waveguide on an equivalent isotropic substrate with
ϵ = √ϵ1ϵ2, see [86].

6.3.2
Semiconductor electrooptic modulators
GaAs- and InP-based Mach–Zehnder modulators have been developed both in discrete
form and integrated with a source. For the sake of brevity, let us conﬁne the treatment
to GaAs. GaAs is isotropic, with microwave relative permittivity ϵm ≈13, microwave
refractive index nm ≈
√
13 = 3.61, and optical refractive index no ≈3.4. Due to crystal
symmetry, most of the elements in the linear electrooptic tensor of GaAs are again zero,
many are equal, and the only nonzero elements have values (at λ = 0.8 μm)
r41 = r52 = r63 = 1.2 pm/V.
By inspection of (6.6), only the nondiagonal elements of the permittivity matrix change
when applying an electric ﬁeld; i.e., the material becomes anisotropic. For simplicity
we refer here to two practically exploited electrode conﬁgurations, shown in Fig. 6.9. In
conﬁguration (a), the semiconductor is grown along the z direction, while the optical TE
ﬁeld is polarized along the y′ direction; the applied electric ﬁeld is vertical (along z). In
conﬁguration (b), the growth is again along z, and the polarization and the applied ﬁeld
are both along y′. In the primed reference system, we have z′ = z, while the other axes
are rotated by π/4 with respect to the unprimed axes x, y (deﬁned along the crystal
directions). In both cases, the guiding structure includes a double AlGaAs-GaAs het-
erostructure providing vertical photon conﬁnement. Doped junctions can be exploited
to enhance the effect of the applied voltage.
In an anisotropic material, the identiﬁcation of the principal axes can be carried out
through the help of the index ellipsoid, deﬁned by the equation

The TE mode experiences a modal index variation of −nV (along y′); in the same
conditions, the TM mode (vertical polarization) is unaffected. The refractive index also
varies along x′, so that the optical waveguide could also be deﬁned orthogonal to that
direction. The resulting modulator is therefore polarization dependent, and similar to a
LN Mach–Zehnder modulator.
The case in Fig. 6.9(b), is more complex, since an electric ﬁeld parallel to the TE
ﬁeld makes the material biaxial, with principal axes having nonzero projection on both
the TE and the TM modes. The resulting mode coupling leads to mode conversion: a
TE input mode is converted after a certain length into a TM mode with opposite phase,
and vice versa. In a Mach–Zehnder conﬁguration, under applied voltage Vπ, the TE
components in each arm are converted to TM, with opposite sign at the output (destruc-
tive interference), while the TM components are converted into TE components with

opposite sign (destructive interference again); moreover, it can be shown that the effec-
tive variation of modal index is 2nV , i.e., the conﬁguration is twice as effective as
the one with vertical electric ﬁeld [87]. The resulting modulator is therefore polariza-
tion independent. A more detailed representation of the two structures is shown in
Fig. 6.10 [88].
To compare, at a material level, the relative merits of LN and of GaAs, we should
consider that the material ﬁgure of merit is n3
0r, rather than r alone. From this stand-
point, in LN n3
0r ≈2.23 · 30 = 320 pm/V, while in GaAs n3
0r ≈3.43 · 1.3 = 51 pm/V.
However, the electrooptic potential of GaAs can be enhanced in several ways. First, QW
or MQW structures with excitonic effects at room temperature can lead to an increase of
the r coefﬁcient with respect to bulk. Secondly, junction effects (which cannot of course
be implemented in LN) allow enhancement of the applied ﬁeld with the same applied
voltage. To make a comparison, imagine applying the same voltage on a coplanar elec-
trode pair with separation G = 10 μm (about the minimum allowed by the optical spot
size in Ti-diffused waveguides) and on a pin junction with intrinsic layer of thickness
d = 0.5 μm; a factor of 20 in favor of GaAs arises, so that GaAs turns out to be 3–4
times better than LN. In practice, this advantage is shown by the comparative lengths
of LN-based modulators (about 10 mm) and of GaAs- or InP-based modulators (about
1 mm in bulk modulators and even less in QW structures). However, since the realiza-
tion of semiconductor-based modulators is fraught with many technological difﬁculties,
this solution is less signiﬁcant than the LN-based one for applications.
More recently, all-silicon modulators were developed exploiting the refractive index
variation associated with charge injection; some further details and structure examples
are provided in Section 6.6.2.
6.3.3
Polymer modulators
Polymer-based electrooptic modulators have promising properties, although material
degradation in the long term is still a practical problem in system applications. Polymers
can be made electrooptic by means of chromophore molecules, characterized by large
dipole moments and optical nonlinearity. Chromophores can be activated in a polymer
through a process called high-temperature poling, whereby chromophores are aligned
by a strong applied electric ﬁeld in a heated polymer. The randomly aligned dipole
moments keep their alignments after cooling and result in a polymer having macro-
scopic electrooptic properties that can be expressed in terms of a linear electrooptic

tric ﬁeld is vertical, like the poling ﬁeld, and parallel to the optical ﬁeld); the situation
is somewhat similar to LN modulators in the Z-cut conﬁguration and microstrip elec-
trodes. The corresponding r33 can be as large as 20–60 pm/V, and the refractive index
is around 1.6. Owing to the microstrip conﬁguration (see Fig. 6.11 [89]), and to the
low refractive index, the optical and microwave refractive indices are similar, leading to
very efﬁcient synchronous coupling in traveling-wave modulators. From a system stand-
point, polymer modulators are comparable to LN modulators concerning bandwidth and
driving voltages, but their lifetime and practical use is still impaired by long-term poly-
mer degradation. The material ﬁgure of merit is n3
0r ≈1.63 · 20 = 81 pm/V, somewhat
similar to GaAs.

The Mach–Zehnder electrooptic modulator
The Mach–Zehnder amplitude modulator is based on the constructive or destructive
interference of two phase-modulated beams generated by splitting the input optical
beam into two parts, each running in a separate optical waveguide; see Fig. 6.12. An
electric ﬁeld is applied to each arm of the modulator through a set of coplanar or
microstrip electrodes; the electrode cross section design depends on the material and
on the optical ﬁeld polarization. The applied RF ﬁeld causes the two optical beams
to be phase modulated before recombination in the output optical combiner. At zero
applied voltage and RF ﬁeld, the two beams reach the combiner with equal phase and
recombine constructively. When the applied voltage is equal to Vπ, the two recombin-
ing optical ﬁelds have a phase difference of π, and in the output arm of the combiner a
higher-order, below threshold mode is radiated, leading to zero output optical power.
The ﬁeld proﬁles in the combiner are shown qualitatively in Fig. 6.12. Due to the
conversion of phase modulation into amplitude modulation through beam interference,
we can call this class of modulators interferometric modulators.

6.4.1
The lumped Mach–Zehnder modulator
The basic building block of the Mach–Zehnder interferometric modulator (Fig. 6.13) is
the phase modulator section. We assume that the electrooptic material is LN; for semi-
conductors, the treatment is similar. Suppose that the optical waveguide lies between a
ground plane and an electrode at potential VA (this is the case for the upper modulation
section in a Mach–Zehnder modulator; see Fig. 6.12); the electric ﬁeld will be directed
toward the negative z axis (consider, e.g., an X-cut case, Fig. 6.6). The phase difference
induced by VA over an interaction region of length L, with respect to the case in which
VA = 0, can be expressed as8

where no is the TE or TM modal index. The phase variation φ is therefore a lin-
ear function of the applied voltage. In the symmetric Mach–Zehnder conﬁguration, the
voltages applied to the two phase modulation sections (upper and lower, see Fig. 6.12)
induce, in the upper and lower waveguides, RF ﬁelds with opposite direction. Since the
dominant electrooptic effect is linear, the modal index variation will also be equal in
magnitude in the upper and lower modulation sections, but with opposite sign. If we
assume that the central electrode in Fig. 6.12 is at VA, while the upper and lower strips
are grounded, the phase variations of the upper and lower arms will add, so that the
phase difference between the optical ﬁelds at the end of the phase modulation section
will be

In the symmetric case, φU = −φL. When |φU −φL| = π, the optical ﬁelds in

exp(jφ), see (6.12).

6.4.2
Static electrooptic response
The DC electrooptic response of the modulator can be derived as follows. Suppose that
the input splitter is matched at port 1 (the input) and at the two outputs (ports 2 and 3);
suppose that the two output ports are isolated. Neglecting losses, the scattering matrix
of the splitter can be expressed by inspection as
Ssp =

√α ejφsp
√
1 −α ejφsp
√α ejφsp

⎠.
The parameter α accounts for the power asymmetry of an asymmetrical splitter; if α =
1/2 the splitter is symmetrical. Note that Ssp satisﬁes the lossless condition SspS†
sp = 1.
Similarly, the scattering matrix of the combiner with input ports 2 and 3 and output
port 1 is Sc = Ssp. Assume that the incident optical power wave into port 1 is a1; the
transmitted power waves at ports 2 and 3 will be
b2 = √αejφspa1,
b3 =
√
1 −αejφspa1.
Assuming that the upper and lower arms are perfectly matched, the power waves at
the combiner inputs, a′

3 (lower arm), are

(6.14)
where the additional factor η accounts for the optical insertion loss of the modulator.
Let us now conﬁne the treatment to a modulator with a symmetrical splitter, but with
possibly asymmetrical upper and lower arms. The case is practically important since
it corresponds to the ordinary (non-dual-drive) Z-cut modulators, due to the different
overlap integrals.
From (6.14) we have, for α = 1/2,
T (Vin) = η
2 [1 + cos(φU −φL)] .
Deﬁne now as VπU and Vπ L the voltages (applied to the upper and lower arms,
respectively) for which φU = π, φL = −π. We have

Lumped modulator dynamic response
Suppose now that the generator open-circuit voltage vA(t) is time-varying; to evaluate
the modulator response we express the input voltage vin(t), see Fig. 6.13, as a function
of vA(t), taking into account the input equivalent circuit including the generator resis-
tance RG and the modulator input capacitance C (the circuit considered is the same as
in Fig. 6.42, in which the gray box is removed, the stray inductances are not considered,
RL →∞, and Cpad is the modulator capacitance). The effect of other elements, such

as a modulator output load resistance and parasitic stray inductances and capacitances,
can easily be accounted for at circuit level. In general, we can conveniently work in the
frequency domain and relate the modulator input voltage phasor Vin (ω) to the generator
voltage phasor VA (ω) through a low-pass transfer function H(ω) as
Vin (ω) = H(ω)VA (ω) ,
where H(0) = 1. Assuming that (6.15) holds for time-varying input voltages, we can
associate with the upper and lower phase modulation section phase delays a proper
phasor φα(ω), α = U, L. Applying the same input voltage to the upper and lower
phase modulator sections, we therefore obtain

In dynamic conditions, the relation between the phase delay and the input voltage is
linear but dispersive (with low-pass behavior). Taking into account that the relation
between the phase delay and the output power (6.17) is nonlinear but memoriless, we
can ﬁnally express the dynamic modulator response as

9 From a system standpoint, the modulator can be decomposed into a dispersive linear system (the phase
modulation sections) in cascade with a nonlinear memoriless system (the combiner). Such a decomposition
can be conveniently exploited to generate system-level CAD models for electrooptic modulators, see [90].

Modulators
To express the overall frequency response of the modulator, we assume small-signal
operation with respect to a DC working point, i.e.,
vA(t) = VA,DC +vA(t),
vin(t) = Vin,DC +vin(t),
where vA(t), vin(t) are small-signal components. Linearizing around Vin,DC we obtain

since H(0) = 1, and coincides with the frequency response of the phase modulation

φα(0) = H(ω),
α = U, L.
This is by no means surprising, since the phase modulation section is the only dispersive
block in the modulator.
6.4.4
Efﬁciency–bandwidth trade-off in lumped MZ modulators
To increase the modulator efﬁciency (i.e., the modulator’s ability to be operated by
a generator with a reduced available power and open-circuit voltage), Vπ should be
decreased. The product Vπ L is, however, constant for a given geometry, see (6.16),
and can be minimized by increasing the overlap integral, reducing the gap G, and
improving the material properties; once Vπ L has been minimized, Vπ can be decreased
only by increasing the modulator length L. Unfortunately, increasing L reduces the
lumped modulator bandwidth, since it increases the input capacitance. For the sake
of deﬁniteness, let us consider a coplanar modulator and denote as C0 the per-unit-
length capacitance of the central strip with respect to the two ground planes; RG is

Following the deﬁnition of the optical bandwidth, we ﬁnd instead:
f3dB,op =

2π RGCin

L .
Independently of the deﬁnition considered, it is clear that increasing the modulator
length decreases the on–off voltage but also decreases the modulator bandwidth. As
shown in Example 6.1, with realistic input voltages (of the order of 5 V), the bandwidth
of a lumped modulator is unsuited to applications with speed above 1 Gbps.
Example 6.1: Evaluate the product f3dB,opL for a X-cut LN modulator with “typi-
cal” parameters. Assume as a goal Vπ ≈5 V, with r33 = 30 pm/V, ne = neo = 2.25,
λ0 = 1.55 μm, mo = 0.5, RG = 50 , and suppose that the gap is kept to a minimum
value to allow the optical waveguide to be deﬁned between the central electrode and
ground plane (G = 10 μm). Furthermore, assume that the central electrode width is
W = 20 μm to ensure decoupling between the two optical waveguides.
We have

2 · 2.253 · 30 × 10−12 · 0.5 = 4.5 × 10−2 V m = 4.5 V cm.
To evaluate the bandwidth, we need to compute the capacitance of the central strip with
respect to the two lateral coplanar ground planes. The capacitance per unit length can
be expressed, from (3.29) and (3.31), as
C0 =

We can therefore conclude that a modulator with suitable Vπ (requiring a length of
the order of 1 cm) has a bandwidth of the order of 1 GHz (take into account that the
capacitance can be somewhat reduced by means of thick electrodes and the use of low-
permittivity dielectric layers).
6.5
The traveling-wave Mach–Zehnder modulator
As discussed in Section 6.4.4, the bandwidth of a LN concentrated modulator having
realistic on–off voltage (≈5 V) is of the order of 1 GHz cm. Reducing the modulator
length leads to an increase of the bandwidth, but also of the switching voltage Vπ. The
efﬁciency–bandwidth trade-off, however, can be substantially improved by making use
of a distributed rather than of a concentrated (lumped) modulator structure, as shown
in Fig. 6.15. In the distributed or traveling-wave modulator the RF structure works as
a transmission line rather than as a concentrated capacitor. The RF signal is fed from
the RF input through a coaxial connector (shown in idealized form), and propagates on
the coplanar waveguide (CPW) through the interaction length, inducing an electric ﬁeld
that travels together with the optical signal. The optical and RF ﬁelds therefore undergo
synchronous interaction (as long as their phase velocities are the same). The coplanar
transmission line is terminated by an RF load, which may be connected (internally or
externally) to an output coaxial connector. Note that an optical ﬁber is also pigtailed at
the optical input and output of the modulator.

6.5.1
Mach–Zehnder traveling-wave modulator dynamic response
In Section 6.4.3 we have shown that, since the optical combiners and dividers are mem-
oriless components, the modulator small-signal frequency response coincides with the
frequency response of the phase modulation section. We now analyze the phase modula-
tion frequency response of the traveling-wave modulator on the basis of the distributed
interaction between the RF and the optical ﬁelds. The RF waveguide is a quasi-TEM
transmission line, whose voltage can be expressed as a superposition of forward and
backward (reﬂected) waves:
vm(z, t) = V +ejω(t−z/vm)−αmz + V −ejω(t+z/vm)+αmz
(6.19)
where vm is the RF phase velocity, αm is the RF attenuation, and V + and V −are com-
plex constants to be determined from the generator and load conditions. The RF voltage
vm(z, t) in (6.19) is expressed as a complex signal; the corresponding real signal can
be obtained as Re(vm). Suppose now that an optical wave is traveling in the forward
direction (positive z) with group velocity vo,10 entering the line (z = 0) at time t0. At
t1 > t0 the optical wavefront is at z = (t1 −t0)vo, i.e., t1 = t0 + z/vo. The time t2 at
which the optical wavefront reaches the end of the interaction region will therefore be
t2 = t0 + L/vo, where L is the length of the interaction region see Fig. 6.16.
While traveling along the line, the optical wave experiences, due to the effect of the
RF ﬁeld, a local variation of the refractive index n; for the sake of generality we will
assume that n is complex, n = nr −jni. Let us call such a variation n = nr −jni,
10 For a monochromatic laser beam entering the modulation region, vo should rather be interpreted as the
phase velocity; however, as soon as phase modulation takes place, the optical signal becomes a narrowband
modulated signal and the wavefront propagation velocity should be the group velocity. See also [91].

where a is a proper constant. The total amplitude and phase variation of the optical ﬁeld
can be recovered by integrating n as seen by the optical ﬁeld while traveling along the

t(z) = t0 + z/vo = t2 −L/vo + z/vo.

vm(L, t) = im(L, t)ZL,
(6.23)
where ZG (ZL) are the generator (load) impedance, respectively (typically real), and
VA is the open-circuit generator voltage. To this end, the line voltage and current can be

6.5.2
Analysis of the TW Mach–Zehnder modulator response
The frequency response of the distributed Mach–Zehnder modulator is dominated by
the following main factors:
1. The velocity mismatch between the optical and RF propagating waves, related to
the index mismatch nmo = nm −no. This parameter has an inﬂuence on u+ and
therefore on F(u+).
2. The impedance mismatch between the load, the transmission line, and the generator.
3. The RF losses of the modulator line.
In order to single out the effect of each factor, consider ﬁrst the modulation response
m1(ω) of a lossless modulator (αm = 0) with a matched load and generator (ZL =
ZG = Z0). From (6.31) we obtain
m1(ω) = |F(u+)| =

and the frequency response is dominated by the velocity mismatch between the RF and
optical signals. With zero velocity mismatch, m1(ω) = 1, independent of frequency, and
the bandwidth is ideally inﬁnite. For ﬁnite velocity mismatch, the behavior is shown in
Fig. 6.17 for L = 11 mm; the relative mismatch is deﬁned as % =

The velocity mismatch-dependent modulator electrical and optical bandwidth can be
evaluated by imposing (6.4) and (6.5) to m1(U); we obtain U3dB,op = 1.89, U3dB,el =

Taking into account that L ≈1 cm to obtain Vπ ≈5 V, we have that the velocity
mismatch for 10 Gbps operation (optical bandwidth) is nmo = 1.8. For a coplanar
modulator on a LN niobate one has nmo = nm −no = 4.22 −2.2 ≈2. Thus, even
without accounting for losses, a straightforward modulator without any structure opti-
mization aimed at improving synchronous coupling can cover 2.5 Gbps applications but
can hardly satisfy 10 Gbps speciﬁcations.
RF losses cause a decrease of the bandwidth and the ﬁlling of response zeros, see
Fig. 6.18. Since the RF signal line cross section is very small (e.g., the width and thick-
ness are of the order of 10 μm), and skin effect losses increase anyway as √f , conductor
losses can be a major limitation to the high-speed modulator operation.
Assuming synchronous coupling and input and output impedance matching, the RF
loss-limited response m2(ω) is, from (6.31),


dB = 6.393 dB.
The total line attenuation at the frequency corresponding to the bandwidth is there-
fore 6.9 dB for the optical bandwidth and 6.4 dB for the electrical 3 dB bandwidth. As
an example, in order to allow for 40 Gbps operation, the (loss-limited) 3 dB optical
bandwidth of a 1 cm long modulator should satisfy the constraint
αm(40 GHz)L|dB = 6.897 dB →αm(40 GHz)|dB = 6.897 dB/cm;
i.e., the 1 GHz loss should be
αm(1 GHz)

40 GHz
1 GHz = 6.897 dB/cm →αm(1 GHz) = 6.897
√
40
= 1.1 dB/cm.
This is a very low value, considering the small line cross section of modulator lines.
Finally, assume that no losses are present and that the velocities are matched; the
effect of impedance mismatch can be better understood by separating the phase delay
into two contributions:
φ(ω) = φ+(ω) + φ−(ω),
where φ+(ω) is the phase modulation due to codirectional coupling, i.e., the coupling
between the RF forward-traveling wave and the optical mode, while φ−(ω) is the
phase modulation due to contradirectional coupling, i.e., the coupling between the RF
backward or reﬂected wave and the forward-traveling optical wave. From (6.27) we
obtain

Impedance mismatch leads to ripples in the frequency response; see Fig. 6.19.
Complete mismatch is achieved with an open-circuit or short-circuit modulator.
The open-circuit modulator has a narrowband low-pass response, somewhat similar to
the response of a lumped modulator, while the short-circuit modulator has zero efﬁ-
ciency at DC (due to the cancellation of co- and counterpropagating responses) and
exhibits a resonant peak at higher frequency; see Fig. 6.20. Shorted resonant modulators
can sometimes be used for narrowband operation, since they increase their efﬁciency

narrowband modulators, which could be suited to narrowband transmission of an analog
signal over an optical ﬁber, are the phase reversal modulators [92].
Phase reversal modulators can be realized by periodically reversing the sign of the
applied electric ﬁeld. The optical signal therefore alternately undergoes variations of
the refractive index with opposite sign. This is easily obtained with a Z-cut substrate,

as shown in Fig. 6.21 (for the sake of simplicity, only the phase modulation section is
shown).
The operation of the phase reversal device can be explained as follows. At low
frequency the phase delay of the RF signal is very low, so that, integrating phase vari-
ations of opposite sign over the modulator length, the net result is zero (Fig. 6.22(a)).
With increasing frequency the RF signal ﬁnally undergoes a large phase delay, assum-
ing, at a certain frequency f0, alternate positive and negative sign over the modulator
length; at that frequency the phase variation of the RF wave and the phase variation
in the periodic structure compensate, leading to an overall phase shift of the optical
signal (Fig. 6.22(b)). Thus, the response of the modulator is zero at low frequency,
while it exhibits a resonant peak around f0; see Fig. 6.23 for a simpliﬁed example
with only two reversal sections. It may be noted that the response peak occurs at
the same frequency at which a zero response occurs in the absence of phase rever-
sal. The resulting device is clearly suited to the transmission of narrowband analog
signals only.

Modulators
If we bias the modulator at Vin = Vπ/2, then cot = 1 and chirp can be made positive
or negative (see Fig. 5.38) by proper design of the modulator arms. If the two arms are
unbalanced, the amount of chirp can be varied somewhat by changing the bias point with
respect to Vin = Vπ/2. If, on the other hand, the modulator is completely symmetrical
(as in X-cut Mach–Zehnder modulators on LN) the chirp is identically zero, indepen-
dent of the bias voltage. Z-cut modulators have nonzero chirp, which can conveniently
be designed to be negative to (partly) compensate for ﬁber dispersion.
On the other hand, variable-chirp modulators can be obtained in principle by exploit-
ing two separate driving voltages for the upper and lower arms. The relevant structure,
called a dual-drive modulator, will be discussed in Section 6.6.1. Dual-drive modulators
typically have a symmetrical structure (VπU = Vπ L = 2Vπ) but the upper and lower
phase modulation sections are controlled by different voltages. Suppose we work under
small-signal conditions and apply a symmetrical bias to the two modulator arms;13 we
have
vinU,L(t) = Vin +vinU,L(t),
vinU(t) = VU f (t),
vinL(t) = VL f (t),

High-speed electrooptic modulator design
Achieving high-speed electrooptic modulators for 10 Gbps or 40 Gbps requires the use
of traveling-wave structures. However, a large (more than 100%) velocity mismatch
naturally exists between the optical and RF velocities in a coplanar LN modulator
(see (6.11) and the following discussion), so that the RF structure has to be properly
optimized in order to reduce the microwave refractive index and improve the velocity
matching with the optical signal. Common recipes for LN are the use of low-permittivity
(e.g. SiO2) thin (<1.5 μm) buffer layers interposed between the coplanar electrodes and
the substrate, the increase of the electrode thickness through electroplating to store more
RF energy in air rather than in the high-permittivity LN substrate, and the use of ridge
optical waveguides to optimize the overlap integral.
13 Note that in a X-cut modulator the applied voltage in the center conductor induces opposite ﬁelds in the
upper and lower waveguides; in a dual drive Z-cut modulator, see Fig. 6.25(d), opposite driving voltages
have to be imposed to obtain opposite ﬁelds. In order to use the same notation as in the single-drive case,
the driving voltage in the lower arm has been assumed with a minus sign, so that equal external driving
voltages can again induce an opposite phase delay.

6.6 High-speed electrooptic modulator design
395
For semiconductor modulators, the situation is reversed, since for GaAs the effective
permittivity of a coplanar waveguide is ≈(1 + ϵr)/2 = 7, corresponding to an RF index
nm =
√
7 = 2.65. On the other hand, the optical refractive index is no ≈3.4. To achieve
synchronous coupling, the RF index should be increased (i.e., the RF wave made slower)
through the use of proper RF slow-wave structures. A similar issue was discussed in the
context of velocity-matched traveling-wave photodetectors, see Section 4.10.3.
Reducing the RF line losses is also a must, since line losses are a major limiting
factor to operation beyond 40 GHz. Losses can be partly decreased through electrode
thickening and shaping, but, due to the skin effect, improvements are somewhat lim-
ited, and record attenuations are of the order of 0.3 dB/cm at 1 GHz [93]. Finally, the
switching voltage should be kept low (typically 5 V or less) by reducing the line gap
and sometimes placing the waveguide in a ridge or other special structure to increase
the interaction with the RF ﬁeld. In semiconductor modulators the use of junctions
allows enhancement of the applied ﬁeld in the active region; typical switching voltages
are, however, similar to those of LN-based devices. Reducing the switching voltage is
important in high-speed operation, since it makes the design of the driver stage less
critical.
Finally, 50  impedance matching would be highly desirable, since this would sim-
plify the design of driver stages (wideband matching is virtually impossible). This
goal is less difﬁcult to achieve in LN traveling-wave modulators, whose typical line
impedances are of the order of 40–50 , while in semiconductor modulators very often
the impedance level is signiﬁcantly lower.
To investigate together the velocity matching and loss requirements for high-speed
operation, we consider again the frequency response of a distributed modulator for the
impedance-matched case, and we consider together losses and velocity mismatch. From
(6.31), the response can be written in the form
m(ω) = exp(−u′
+/2)

sinh(u+/2)
u+/2
 ,
where
u+ = u′
+ + ju′′
+ = αm L + jω(nm −no)L
c0
.
We now plot the 3 dB bandwidth (electrical in this case) as a function of the normal-
ized velocity mismatch neffL and of the total loss at 1 GHz, α0m L (assuming that
αm ∝√f due to the skin effect). The result, shown in Fig. 6.24, indicates that two
regions exist, the ﬁrst (horizontal lines) is limited by velocity mismatch, the second
(vertical lines) by losses. With the present technology, 40 Gbps modulators can be man-
ufactured but require total RF losses less than 1 dB over the interaction region and
velocity mismatch of the order of 0.4 over an interaction length of 1 cm. Increasing
speed appears far more demanding in terms of attenuation requirements than in terms
of velocity matching.

6.6.1
Lithium niobate modulators
Due to the easier technology and the lack of piezoelectrically induced static charge
problems, X-cut modulators have been the initial choice for LN. Figure 6.25 shows a
few solutions to the interaction region, implemented through coplanar RF distributed
electrodes. Solution (a) is an unbuffered X-cut modulator which, due to large velocity
mismatch between the RF and optical modes, has a better modulation bandwidth than
the lumped modulator but cannot achieve 10 Gbps operation. Reduction of the veloc-
ity mismatch is possible through the use of a low-permittivity dielectric buffer (silicon
oxide but also polymers have been exploited to this end) and of metal electrodes thick-
ened through electroplating. Solution (c) is a Z-cut modulator, characterized by better

6.6 High-speed electrooptic modulator design

efﬁciency, nonzero chirp, and the need to include a conductive buffer to handle the static
charge accumulation problem. Finally, (d) is an example of dual-drive solution, in which
each phase arm is driven by a different voltage level. The implementation shown is in
Z-cut technology and is symmetrical; the dual-drive Z-cut conﬁguration has a moderate
margin in terms of modulation efﬁciency.
Example 6.2: Suppose (as a rule of thumb) that a single-drive Z-cut modulator
(Fig. 6.25(c)) has a 30% advantage over an X-cut single-drive modulator of similar
technology (Fig. 6.25(a)) in terms of on–off voltage, because of the superior overlap
integral of the optical waveguide located below the signal conductor. What will be the
advantage for a Z-cut dual-drive (Fig. 6.25(d))?
In the single-drive Z-cut we have VπU ̸= Vπ L; denoting by VπU the voltage required
for π phase shift in the waveguide located under the center (signal) conductor and by
Vπ L the voltage required for π phase shift in the waveguide located under the ground
plane, we have that the switching voltage for the Z-cut is
VOFF,Z =
VπU Vπ L
VπU + Vπ L
≈0.7VOFF,X
where VOFF,X is the switching voltage for the X-cut. We assume approximately that
VπU < 2VOFF,X < Vπ L (the modulating action is typically more effective for the central
conductor) and that, in particular,
VπU ≈2αVOFF,X,
Vπ L ≈2VOFF,X
α
,
with α < 1. Substituting we have
VOFF,Z =
α
1 + α2 2VOFF,X ≈0.7VOFF,X →α = 0.41.
In the dual-drive conﬁguration, on the other hand, we have VπU = Vπ L = 2αVOFF,X;
thus the related on-off voltage V DD
OFF will be
V DD
OFF = αVOFF,X ≈0.41VOFF,X.
Therefore the Z-cut dual-drive has a 60% advantage over the single-drive X-cut
conﬁguration, or about half of the on–off voltage.
An example of realistic modulator cross section for a X-cut buffered conﬁguration is
shown in Fig. 6.26; the thick Au electrode technology can be based on electroplating
through mask, or on electroplating followed by etching (see, e.g., [94], Section II C).
X-cut modulators can very well cover 10 Gbps applications and are able to reach
the 40 Gbps goal with modulation voltages of the order of 5 V; Z-cut modulators have
superior performances in terms of efﬁciency but may have inferior chirp; moreover, the
static charge buildup issue requires additional complexities, such as the deposition of
charge bleed layers. Both in X-cut and in Z-cut conﬁgurations, a number of solutions

have been tried, as shown in Fig. 6.27, to reduce the modulation voltage and decrease
the line effective index (at the same time increasing the line characteristic impedance).
The best LN modulator performances have probably been achieved through Z-cut
modulators where the optical waveguides are located in ridge structures. An example
of this design approach is shown in Fig. 6.28 [95]; the characteristic impedance is
50 , the microwave effective index 2.2, and the length–bandwidth and length–on-off
voltage products are B3dB,el L = 90 GHz cm and Vπ L = 10 V cm, respectively. For
5 V operation a 2 cm modulator is needed whose electrical bandwidth exceeds 45 GHz.

The RF attenuation presented (0.3 dB/cm at 1 GHz) is one of the lowest achieved in
this kind of structure.
In conclusion, the LN modulator is well qualiﬁed as a high-speed device. On this
mature technology are based many commercially available products that can meet the
requirements of long-haul links up to 40 Gbps. However, further progress toward speeds
in excess of 40 Gbps appears to be difﬁcult without introducing entirely new elements
into the design.
6.6.2
Compound semiconductor, polymer, and silicon modulators
Mach–Zehnder semiconductor (GaAs or InP-based) interferometric modulators have
been studied extensively and have been developed to the market stage. Many semicon-
ductor modulators exploit a TE optical mode with vertical RF applied ﬁeld; the active
region is a thin, undoped, bulk GaAs layer. Moreover, most high-speed devices are
traveling-wave, with slow-wave electrodes aimed at improving the velocity matching to
the optical signal [96]. An example is the Mach–Zehnder GaAs modulator developed
by GEC-Marconi [97], see Fig. 6.29. The RF signal travels on two coplanar strips (one
acting as the ground plane) loaded with T-shaped electrodes (T-rails). T-rails have the
purpose of capacitively loading the transmission line, thus decreasing the phase velocity,
through a set of lumped capacitors; moreover, T-rails apply the RF signal to the active
region where the optical waveguide is located. The connection between the striplines
and the center T-rails is made through a series of airbridges. In the active region, a
ﬂoating internal backplane obtained by means of an n-doped layer allows the two ridge
optical waveguides, located immediately below the T-rails (see Fig. 6.29(below)), to
interact with two RF electric ﬁelds having opposite directions, thus creating the same
push–pull effect as in a symmetric LN modulator. The splitter and combiner are real-
ized through MMI (multimode interference) combiners and dividers, which are more
compact and integrable than conventional adiabatic transitions. The modulator ﬁgures
of merit are B3dB,el L = 53 GHz cm and Vπ L = 7.5 V cm, respectively, comparable
to those of the best LN modulators; 40 Gbps operation is also achieved with driving
voltages of about 5 V.

Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
Integration with the laser source is a possible advantage of the semiconductor mod-
ulator when compared to the LN solution. A few examples of lasers with integrated
modulators have been proposed so far; see, e.g., Fig. 6.30 for a lumped 10 Gbps Mach–
Zehnder InP modulator integrated with a DFB laser [98]. The modulator waveguide
is placed in the central part of a PpN structure with a MQW; the modulator exhibits
negative chirp.
With respect to other integrated solutions, the Mach–Zehnder modulator certainly
has some performance advantage (i.e., in terms of chirp) but also has the disadvantage
of large size when compared to the source. On the other hand, integration allows the
modulator efﬁciency to be improved through the use of MQW structures, which exploit
exciton resonances and therefore have a narrow optical bandwidth, that must be tuned
to a speciﬁc source.
Example 6.3: Evaluate the Henry parameter in the modulator shown in Fig. 6.30. The
intensity has Pout = 0.9 −0.1 = 0.8 in arbitrary units with an average power Pout =
0.4 and the increasing pulse has a risetime of t ≈500 ps. The frequency deviation
(maximum) is f = −5 GHz.

Polymer-based modulators appear (from the standpoint of material properties) as a
promising substitute to LN-based devices; performances are comparable to the best LN
modulators (electrical bandwidth of 40 GHz with on–off voltage less than 4 V; optical
insertion loss of 6 dB, zero chirp), with slightly inferior optical power-handling capabil-
ities. As already mentioned, long-term stability and the need for hermetic packages is a
major problem in polymer-based devices.
During the last few years, the prospect of monolithically integrating an optical
transceiver (apart from the laser source) on a Si substrate has fostered research in
the area of Si-based modulators. In Si, the linear electrooptic effect is zero because
of crystal symmetries, and the only way to modulate the material refractive index is
through the so-called plasma dispersion effect, related to the density of free carriers in
the semiconductor. Such an effect, besides being rather weak (and therefore requiring
long interaction lengths in a MZ conﬁguration), can be implemented in a forward-
bias pn junction, in a reverse-bias pin junction, or in a MOS junction exploiting an
inversion channel [99]. The main problems with some Si-based conﬁgurations are the

switching times, often disappointing due to the limits posed by the minority carrier
lifetime.
A 10 Gbps modulator was implemented by INTEL researchers in the MOS technol-
ogy [100]; see Fig 6.31(a). The structure is made of n-type Si with an upper rib of p-type
Si obtained through epitaxial lateral overgrowth; between the two Si regions there is a
thin insulating layer. Positive bias applied to the p-type Si leads to charge accumula-
tion in the interface, with a change of the refractive index. The structure operates as
the phase shift block in a MZ modulator (note that no push–pull operation is strictly
possible).
More recently, a 40 Gbps modulator with 30 GHz electrical bandwidth was obtained,
again by INTEL researchers [101]. The phase modulator section makes use of a reverse-
bias pn junction, see Fig 6.31(b); the reduced capacitance allows for larger speed. The
interaction length is 1 mm, and the driving voltage exploited in the device measure-
ment was 6 V peak-to-peak superimposed on a 3 V bias; the switching voltage was
estimated as 4 V cm. To reduce the driving voltage without increasing the interaction
length, alternative approaches, such as the use of photonic crystal waveguides, were
also proposed, with a much shorter interaction length (80 μm) [102]. Other solutions
for Si-based modulators exploited SiGe-Si QW and MQW structures (see [99] and
references therein).
6.7
Electroabsorption modulator physics
Electroabsorption modulators (EAMs) exploit the variation in the semiconductor opti-
cal absorption caused by an applied electric ﬁeld. EAMs can be based on two physical
mechanisms: the Franz–Keldysh effect, FKE, or photon-assisted tunneling, typical of
bulk semiconductors; or the quantum conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE), occurring in quan-
tum wells. The QCSE also implies the modulation of excitonic absorption. The FKE
is weaker, but the resulting optical bandwidth is wider (though not as wide as in
EOMs); on the other hand, the QCSE is stronger but optically narrowband. In practice,
QCSE-based modulators are able to modulate a single channel and, therefore, more
conveniently appear as devices integrated with the laser source.

6.7 Electroabsorption modulator physics
403
6.7.1
The Franz–Keldysh effect (FKE)
Consider the band structure of a bulk, direct-bandgap semiconductor in the absence of
an applied electric ﬁeld. To promote a transition from the conduction to the valence
band, a photon is needed with an energy larger than the gap Eg. An applied ﬁeld, see
Fig. 6.32, causes the bands to bend; now, a photon with E ph < Eg can virtually bring
the electron very close to the conduction band edge; further motion in the real space,
made possible by tunneling through a thin and possibly low potential barrier, allows the
electron to be promoted to the conduction band.
From a macroscopic standpoint, the application of an external ﬁeld allows the mate-
rial to absorb photons having energy lower than the absorption edge ≈Eg. Below the
absorption edge, an energy interval exists where α ≈0 without applied ﬁeld, but α ≫0
in the presence of an applied ﬁeld; in such a wavelength range, light switching can be
carried out by applying to the absorption region of the device a voltage large enough to
induce an electric ﬁeld leading to a signiﬁcant variation of the absorption.
The absorption proﬁle resulting from the FKE in the presence of an applied ﬁeld
is shown qualitatively in Fig. 6.33. The ripples in the absorption proﬁle are such as
to have constant area below the α curve with respect to the zero-ﬁeld case. The FKE is
typically rather weak, and requires electric ﬁelds of the order of E > 105 V/cm to obtain
signiﬁcant variations of α; it is optically rather wideband and polarization insensitive.

corresponding to JDOS steps. Note the QW dichroism (i.e., polarization sensitivity); the relative
interaction strength for the TE mode is (1/4, 3/4) for the LH and HH transitions, while for the
TM mode this is (1, 0) for the LH and HH transitions, respectively.
6.7.2
The quantum conﬁned Stark effect (QCSE)
Quantum wells exhibit a band structure with several subbands in the conduction and
valence bands. Let us denote the conduction band levels as C1, C2...and the valence
band levels (which split into heavy and light hole levels) as HH1, HH2. . . and LH1,
LH2. . . . Selection rules only allow some of the transitions between levels to occur, and,
moreover, make the transition interaction strengths generally different for TE or TM
polarized photons. The QW absorption proﬁle is inherited from the staircase-shaped
joint density of states (JDOS), see Section 2.4.3, although only the steps corresponding
to allowed transitions are considered, see Fig. 6.34; the weight of each step will be
different for different polarizations.
The effect of excitons (see Section 2.4.3), which can be detected in quantum wells
at room temperature, play a signiﬁcant role in the QW optical properties. Excitons are
bound states involving one electron and one hole, and their binding energy is larger
in a QW than in the bulk; they interact with photons, leading to absorption peaks
immediately below each step of the JDOS; see Fig. 6.34.
Due to the combined effect of polarization-sensitive selection rules, QW show, even
in the absence of an electric ﬁeld, a marked dichroism, i.e., a different absorption
and refractive index proﬁle for each polarization; see Fig. 6.34(right) for the qualita-
tive behavior. Since the interaction strength of the C1−HH1 transition is zero for TM
polarization, the ﬁrst step of the JDOS is missing from the absorption response to TM
polarization, and so is the associated exciton peak.
Application of an external ﬁeld causes the QW bands to bend, exactly as in the bulk
case; band bending leads to three effects:
• The energy levels involved in the transitions become closer due to the shift in the
QW potential proﬁle; see Fig. 6.35 for an example referring to the C1−H1 transition
(H1 stands for HH1 or LH1 depending on the subband ordering, which may change

in strained QWs). As a consequence, the absorption edge is red-shifted toward lower
energies.
• The exciton levels undergo a certain amount of energy shift.
• The envelope wavefunctions of the valence and conduction band states change, lead-
ing to a modulation of the transition interaction strength. For very large ﬁelds we
expect the interaction strength to decrease, due to the decreasing overlap between
the two wavefunctions.
We can express the photon energy as
E ph = ¯hω = Ee1
h1 −Eex,
where Ee1
h1 is the energy difference between the C1 and H1 levels, and Eex is the exciton
binding energy (of the order of 10 meV). The intersubband transition energy can be
decomposed as
Ee1
h1 = Eg + Ee1 −Eh1,
where Ee1 is the level of C1 above the conduction band edge, Eh1is the level of H1
below the valence band edge Ev (Eh1is therefore negative). It can be shown that the
transition energy decreases with the applied ﬁeld, according to a quadratic law:

10−3 is a dimensionless constant, see [11], Section 13.4.6. An example of the energy
shift for a 9.5 nm GaAs/AlGaAs QW is shown in Fig. 6.36. For applied ﬁelds of the
order of 100 kV/cm, corresponding to a potential difference V = 100 × 103 · 102 ·
9.5 × 10−9 ≈100 mV across the QW, the shift is of the order of 10 meV.
A second contribution to the absorption edge shift is caused by the change in the
exciton binding energy; see Fig. 6.37 for an example referring to a GaAs QW [104].
For increasing applied ﬁeld, the binding energy decreases slightly, i.e., excitons get
closer to the state energy levels; this partly counteracts the shift of the energy levels,

but, for small QW thicknesses, the variation is about one order of magnitude less than
for Ee1
h1.
Let us consider now the total effect resulting from the application of an electric ﬁeld.
Since typical QW structures are Pi N junctions, the applied voltage causes the junction
to be in reverse bias (exactly as in a pin photodiode). The resulting almost uniform ﬁeld
in the intrinsic region decreases the intersubband transition energy and the magnitude
of the exciton binding energy (due to decreased Coulomb interaction between elec-
tron and hole). As the overall effect, the absorption spectrum is red-shifted to longer
wavelengths. With increasing applied ﬁeld, we also observe a quenching of the peak
absorption at the exciton resonance due to decreased electron–hole overlap. Variations
in the absorption proﬁle are ﬁnally inﬂuenced by the different interaction strength of

the transitions between the heavy and light hole valence band levels and the electron
conduction band levels. We recall that the predicted relative oscillator strengths are
• for TE polarization, 3/4 (C1−HH1), 1/4 (C1−LH1),
• for TM polarization, 0 (C1−HH1), 1 (C1−LH1).
An example of normalized absorption spectra (derived as the material transmission
in log scale) is shown in Fig. 6.38 [105]; the dichroism also exists in the presence of an
applied ﬁeld, and the effect of exciton absorption resonant peaks and their quenching
with increasing ﬁeld is clearly visible. Due to the exciton peaks, large variations of the
absorption can be obtained at comparatively low ﬁelds, but only for a very narrow range
of optical wavelengths.
Dichroism may be a limitation in EAMs, at least in discrete (nonintegrated) devices,
since it requires the incoming light to be polarized in a speciﬁc TE or TM state.
Polarization-insensitive devices can be developed by removing dichroism through the
use of stressed QWs.
In the presence of applied stress, the QW bandstructure (as the bulk bandstructure)
modiﬁes in two ways: compressive (tensile) stress leads to a decrease (increase) of
the lattice constant, and therefore to an increase (decrease) of Eg; in the bulk, stress
causes heavy and light holes to lose their degeneracy, while in a quantum well it
changes the relative alignments of the heavy and light hole levels. As a result, we
have the situation shown in Fig. 6.39; tensile strain can lead to an alignment of the
LH1 and HH1 energies, by which the polarization anisotropy is suppressed or, at least,
reduced. Introduction of tensile strain in the wells limits the total thickness of the
MQW (to avoid misﬁt dislocations); however, this effect can be compensated by using
a compressively-strained barrier.
A ﬁnal effect concerns the dependence of the absorption proﬁle on the carrier den-
sity. Ideally, EAMs operate with almost zero carrier density: the conduction band is
supposed to be empty, and the electric ﬁeld is uniform and unperturbed by space-charge
effects. However, photogenerated carriers recombine or are swept out of the undoped
(absorption) region with an average lifetime τt, which can be considered as a transit

where Pop is the incident optical power and A is the device cross section. The resulting
carrier density is therefore
n = α Popτt
A¯hω .
With increase in the optical power, the carrier density in the absorption region increases.
Beyond a certain level, optical power saturation may occur due to two effects: ﬁrst,
generated photocarriers screen the applied external RF ﬁeld, thus leading to a decrease
of absorption; second, emission begins to play an important role due to band ﬁlling, thus
counteracting the effect of absorption and reducing the effective absorption coefﬁcient.
As a result of both effects, absorption will decrease with increasing optical power.
The mechanisms that limit the disappearance time τt are, in bulk modulators, charge
trapping at heterojunctions (e.g., InGaAsP/InP), and in QWs, the accumulation of holes
in the well (due to their higher mass). Bandgap engineering is needed to lower the
relevant band offset and reduce τt. Note that the same problem occurs in photodiodes

(see Section 4.9.2), where, however, the input optical power is low enough to make
power saturation effects often less signiﬁcant.14
6.8
Electroabsorption modulator structures and parameters
Early electroabsorption modulators exploited pin vertical structures similar to vertical
photodiodes, with short active (absorption) MQW region (1 μm), and large diameter
(50–100 μm) [106]; an example of the structure cross section is shown in Fig. 6.40(a).
In this vertical design, due to the small thickness of the absorbing stack (similar to the
absorption region of a vertical photodetector), the FKE is too weak to cause signiﬁcant
contrast ratio, and the exploited physical mechanism was the QCSE.
To overcome these limitations, practical EAM structures are based on wave-
guide approaches (similar to those exploited in waveguide photodetectors, see Sec-
tion 4.10.1); that is, the active region is an optical waveguide with applied electric ﬁeld
orthogonal to the optical mode propagation. Such structures allow the absorption region
to be long enough in the OFF state, without compromising the driving voltage. An
example is shown in Fig. 6.40(b); the pin structure is designed to form a slab wave-
guide, with typical thickness of the intrinsic absorption region d = 0.1−0.5 μm. The
total length L of the absorption region can be comparatively large (L = 50−300 μm).
Due to the small value of d, the applied ﬁeld can be large even with a low reverse bias;
typical switching voltages can be as low as 1.5−2V . Both the FKE and the QCSE can
be employed as the absorption modulation mechanism.

connected to the optical source. Photodiode saturation is a major concern, however, in applications such
as the optical generation of microwaves or millimeter-waves, where the optical input power should be
maximized to increase the output RF power.

EAM static response
The transmission characteristics of an EAM can be derived from the optical mode
absorption αo = ovα, where α is the material absorption in the active region and ov
is the overlap integral, see Section. 5.5.1 and (5.18).15 The RF ﬁeld is almost uni-
form in the active region, inducing a uniform variation of α and negligible variation in
the cladding. Assuming an input and output insertion loss Lop < 1, the transmis-
sion characteristics over a uniform device of length L and input voltage Vin can be
expressed as16

The resulting transmission curve is shown in Fig. 6.41; the ON and OFF state losses
are TON,OFF = T (VON,OFF) and the extinction or contrast ratio is ER= TON/TOFF or
ER|dB = TON|dB −TOFF|dB. Note that in QCSE-based devices the response typically
increases again at large applied voltages, due to the weaker overlap between the initial
and ﬁnal states involved in the absorption process.
From the standpoint of material and structure optimization, a trade-off exists between
the extinction ratio and the ON state residual transmission loss. In fact, we have

15 The overlap integral takes into account here the fact that the optical ﬁeld also extends outside of the
active region, where the absorption variation occurs; it is therefore similar in all respects to the parameter
exploited in laser analysis. We assume here that the electric ﬁeld is uniform in the active region, contrary to
what happens in LN-based EOMs, where the overlap integral takes into account the nonuniform RF ﬁeld
distribution.

Apparently, large contrast or extinction ratios can be achieved by increasing the length
L of the EAM; however, this also increases losses in the ON state. To increase the ER
without compromising the ON state losses, the parameter to be optimized is α/α0,
i.e., the relative variation of the absorption from the ON to the OFF state. Typi-
cal ON transmission losses are in the range 10–20 dB / mm, while in practical cases
α/α0 ≈3–10.
Example 6.4: Suppose the ON loss is 10 dB/mm and α/α0 = 5, with an additional
insertion loss Lop of 1.5 dB. What extinction ratio can we achieve, and what is the
device length, assuming we accept an overall ON insertion loss of 3 dB?


dB = 5 · 1.5 = 7.5 dB.
Moreover, the ON loss excluding Lop is 1.5 dB, which is achieved over a length L =
150 μm.
The ON state transmission loss K pl mainly consists of absorption in the wave-
guide in the ON state (equal to ovαo, where αo is the active region absorption) but
also of free-carrier absorption in the cladding layers (α f c):
α0 ≈ovαo(VON) + (1 −ov) α f c.
Absorption in the widegap cladding layers is due to the free carrier effect, and
increases with increasing doping (a particularly critical effect in p-doped layers).
The residual absorption in the active region, on the other hand, can be reduced by
increasing the difference between the operating wavelength and the absorption peak
(or absorption edge) of the material, i.e., by detuning the operating wavelength with
respect to the emission wavelength of the material; see Section 6.8.2. Large detuning
implies low loss in the ON state, but also poor extinction ratio.

6.8.2
Lumped EAM dynamic response
The dynamic response of lumped EAMs can be evaluated by considering the electric
equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 6.42. From the electrical standpoint, the EAM is a
reverse-bias pin junction or heterojunction. The intrinsic equivalent circuit of the EAM
includes the series parasitic resistance Rs and the junction capacitance C j:
C j = ϵrϵ0A
d
= ϵrϵ0wL
d
,
where A is the junction area, w is the junction width, L is the active region length, d
is the active layer thickness, and ϵr is the permittivity of the narrowgap intrinsic active
region. The photoresistance R0 originates from the photocurrent Iph generated by the
EAM.17 In general, the absorption depends on the voltage applied to the junction; we
therefore have
Iph = Iph(Vj),
where Vj is the voltage applied to C j (across the active region), i.e., the driving voltage
of the average ﬁeld that modulates the absorption. The presence of the photocurrent can
lead to fairly complex effects, since a large photocurrent is able to change the device bias
point by counteracting the effect of the external generator; this is indeed a further cause
of optical power saturation. Assume, however, that the bias effect of the photocurrent is
negligible; we have from (4.29),

i.e., the small-signal photocurrent can be interpreted as the current in a conductance

the OFF state, small in the ON state. The equivalent circuit in Fig. 6.42 ﬁnally includes
some extrinsic, parasitic elements (Lw, the parasitic connector inductance, and Cpad,
the external parasitic capacitance), the generator and the load resistance.
The evaluation of the dynamic EAM response cannot generally be performed in
closed form, since the equivalent circuit includes, in principle, nonlinear elements such
as the photocurrent conductance (and also, to a smaller extent, the junction capacitance).
We therefore conﬁne the analysis to the small-signal case, and assume that the gener-
ator voltage has a DC and signal component: vG(t) = VG +vG(t); as a consequence,
the junction voltage can be decomposed as v j(t) = Vj +v j(t), where
Vj = VG

We associate the phasors VG(ω) and Vj(ω), respectively, withvG(t) andv j(t); neglect-

Finally, from the deﬁnition of the electrical and optical modulator bandwidth we
immediately have
f3dB,el =
1
2π ReqC ,
f3dB,op =
√
3
2π ReqC .
With decreasing RL, Req decreases, thus leading to a wider bandwidth. At the same
time, however, the DC efﬁciency decreases (it is 50% for a matched resistor, 100% for
an open load); the same effect occurs in LN modulators if we connect them to a matched
load. Due to the rather small areas and low capacitance, lumped EAMs can readily cover
10 Gbps applications; for higher speed, distributed, traveling-wave modulators can be
again introduced, see Section 6.9.
The design of EAMs has to face similar trade-offs as the EOM design. From the
absorbing material viewpoint, we should maximize α/α0 and increase the sensitivity
of the absorption to the electric ﬁeld, and therefore to the applied voltage, α/V .
The parameter α/α0 depends on the difference between the EAM operating wave-
length and the material absorption edge. Such a difference is often expressed through
the detuning energy, i.e., the difference between the energy of the photons emitted
by the source E ph and the absorption edge energy of the EAM material, EEAM. For
E ph > EEAM, the zero-ﬁeld absorption α0 is large and therefore α/α0 is small;
the detuning E = EEAM −E ph should therefore be positive. For very large detun-
ing, however, α vanishes and therefore α/α0 is also small; α/α0 typically has a
maximum for intermediate values of detuning.
Optimization of the optical and RF structures required, on the other hand, several
trade-offs. Reducing the intrinsic layer thickness di increases the electric ﬁeld with
the same driving voltage, thus improving the switching voltage, but at the same time
increases the EAM capacitance (thus reducing the bandwidth) and leads to poorer cou-
pling with the optical ﬁber. Increasing the length L again improves the switching voltage
and the extinction ratio, at the expense of the ON state loss and of the bandwidth (due
to the increased capacitance).
6.8.3
EAM chirp
While in interferometric electrooptic modulators chirp is dominated by the geometry,
the EAM chirp depends on material properties. Due to the Kramers–Kronig relations,
varying the imaginary part of the refractive index (i.e., losses), leads to a variation of the
real part, thus introducing spurious phase modulation. EAM chirp is typically lower than
for directly modulated lasers, and can in principle be reduced and properly tailored (e.g.,
made negative) by selecting the bias point. Assuming a complex refractive index n =
nr −jni and taking into account that the complex propagation constant of the optical
wave is

which corresponds to the system-level deﬁnition of αH already introduced in the dis-
cussion of laser chirp, see (5.78). The Henry parameter αH is therefore related to the
material characteristics and depends on the applied voltage (in small-signal conditions,
on the DC bias) and on the detuning energy. An example of chirp behavior in an
InGaAsP/InGaAsP QW is shown in Fig. 6.43 [107].
The parametric plot of the variation in the real and imaginary parts of the complex
refractive index (the parameter is the applied bias) yields a curve whose slope is the
chirp parameter αH. Before the maximum the chirp parameter is positive, it is zero in
the maximum, and then becomes negative. On the lower horizontal axis the absolute
transmission over L = 100 μm is also shown. On the right, the chirp parameter is plot-
ted as a function of the reverse applied voltage. For low bias voltage the chirp is large
and positive, then it becomes zero, and ﬁnally negative; negative chirp is a desirable
condition for transmission over a dispersive ﬁber, since it allows for compensating dis-
persion, see p. 320. The input bias voltage can be adjusted so as to make chirp small
or negative; however, this corresponds to rather large ON-state attenuations. On the
whole, chirp in EAMs can be substantially better than in directly modulated lasers, but
LN modulators are certainly superior from this standpoint.

To estimate the bandwidth expected from a lumped parameter EAM, let us con-
sider a structure with typical dimensions (e.g., w ≈2 μm, L = 200 μm, d = 0.3 μm).

more than one order of magnitude larger than the bandwidth of lumped LN EOMs.
Lumped EAMs are thus able to cover applications at least up to 10 Gbps. However,
increasing the speed up to 40 Gbps and beyond may make the design critical, thus sug-
gesting in this case also the use of traveling-wave, distributed structures, in which the
RF electrodes are designed as quasi-TEM transmission lines, running parallel to the
optical waveguide and supporting a modulating microwave signal which co-propagates
with the optical signal. Also in this case, as in traveling-wave electrooptic modulators,
no RC limitation to the bandwidth exists, and the device length can be increased with-
out sacriﬁcing speed. An example of distributed EAM structure is shown in Fig. 6.44.
The structure of the active region is similar to that in the waveguide modulator, see
Fig. 6.40(b), only the RF structure acts as a transmission line.
The modulation response of distributed EAMs can be derived, in small-signal con-
ditions, following the same approach as for the distributed electrooptic modulator
analysis; see Section 6.5. Since the RF transmission line is nonlinear (due to the volt-
age dependence of the junction capacitance and the photoresistance), we cannot readily
separate the system into a linear part with memory and a memoriless nonlinear part, as

small-signal case.
The RF voltage on the transmission line is expressed as
vm(z, t) = V +ejω(t−z/vm)−αmz + V −ejω(t+z/vm)+αmz,
where the RF or microwave phase velocity vm can be derived from the pseudo-lumped
equivalent circuit of an inﬁnitely short transmission line cell, shown in Fig. 6.45.
The per-unit-length line parameters can be associated with the following physical
mechanisms:
• Rpul is the skin-effect series resistance of the metal layers (/m).
• Lpul is the conductor per unit length inductance (H/m).
• Rs is the pin region series resistance, ·m.

• C j(Vj) is the junction capacitance, F/m, which weakly depends on the junction
applied voltage Vj.
• Cpul is the external parasitic capacitance, F/m.

voltage.

where we have again introduced the linear dependence on the local RF voltage through
the parameter a (now imaginary), as already done in (6.20) in the discussion of the
frequency response of the distributed EOM. We can now relate ni to α (the variation
in absorption), since

The total amplitude variation experienced by the optical ﬁeld at the modulator output,
E(t2), will be derived by considering again, as in the EOM distributed analysis, the
voltage seen by the optical wave traveling through the interaction region (we neglect, as
already stressed, the phase variation):

The small-signal frequency response of a distributed EAM is formally equivalent to
the response of a traveling-wave electrooptic modulator, as can be seen by evaluating
|H(ω)/H(0)| from (6.27); therefore, the alternative response from (6.31) can also be
exploited. In practice, however, many differences arise. First, the high optical resid-
ual insertion loss limits actual EAM lengths to a few hundred μm; besides, the RF

420
Modulators
propagation loss is much higher than in dielectric-based electrooptic modulators due
to the heavily doped layers (typically 10 dB/cm at 1 GHz against 0.3 dB/cm in LN).
Finally, the velocity mismatch is fairly large, but the structure is so short that this is
often no important limitation to the bandwidth; due to the small thickness of the intrinsic
layer, lines with characteristic impedance much lower than 50  are typically obtained.
Despite such limitations, traveling-wave modulators have shown signiﬁcant advantages
in terms of bandwidth over lumped EAMs.
6.10
Electroabsorption modulator examples
An example of a lumped-parameter, high-speed EAM is shown in Fig. 6.46 [108]. The
guiding structure is based on an intrinsic InGaAs/InAlAs MQW, sandwiched between
a p-type InAlAs layer and an n-type layer of the same material. The substrate is n-
type InP. The length of the modulation region of this QCSE-based modulator is varied
between 50 and 150 μm, leading to the normalized transfer characteristics shown in
Fig. 6.47 (left). The contrast ratio increases from 10 dB at 3 V reverse bias to over 30 dB,
but at the same time also the ON-state insertion loss increases with the length. Note
that the transmission curve grows again after the minimum, due to the weaker QCSE
when the driving voltage becomes large, caused by the decrease in overlap between
the valence and conduction band QW wavefunctions. Figure 6.47 (right) shows the
frequency response normalized with respect to the low-frequency value; for the shortest
device the electrical bandwidth is in excess of 30 GHz.

fornia at Santa Barbara (UCSB) [109], [110]. The bulk InGaAsP absorption layer
operates through FKE, and the EAM parameters are: L = 200 μm, w = 3 μm, d ≈

the RF line; the refractive index exhibits the slow-wave effect, typical of transmission
lines including semiconductors. Owing to such an effect, the RF index nm exhibits
strong low-frequency dispersion and is much larger than the refractive index of the
material (about 7 at high frequency against
√
13 = 3.6).
A simpliﬁed explanation of the slow-wave effect, which makes the synchronous cou-
pling between the optical and RF waveguide more critical, is as follows. In a Pi N
structure, the electric ﬁeld is completely conﬁned in the intrinsic layer, due to the charge
screening effect taking place in the doped surrounding layers. However, the magnetic
ﬁeld permeates the doped layers, unless the frequency is so high that the skin effect
prevents the EM ﬁelds from penetrating doped layers altogether, see Fig. 6.50. While
the line capacitance is the capacitance of the intrinsic layer only, the line inductance
is (approximately) the inductance of the line without semiconductors (i.e., where only
the metal electrodes are present). However, the inductance of such a line is equal to the
inductance in air L0, and is related to the in-air capacitance C0 as L0 = 1/

as the structures in air and with dielectrics differ not only because of the different
dielectric constant but also because of the different geometry.
Apart from the slow-wave effect, the EAM line losses are very high and the
impedance level low, see Fig. 6.49. Note the large imaginary part of the characteris-
tic impedance, typical of a RC line behavior (i.e., a line where the dominant parameters
are the series resistance and the parallel capacitance, see Section 3.2.1).
By injecting the RF signal so as to make it co-propagate or counter-propagate with
respect to the optical signal, the distributed operation can be experimentally detected. In
fact, measured data show that for the co-propagating TW-EAM the optical bandwidth
is around 35 GHz, while in the counter-propagating case it is reduced to 20 GHz. The
expected large reduction in the bandwidth conﬁrms that the modulator operates as a
traveling-wave structure. The switching voltage with 10 dB extinction is 3 V; the smaller
extinction associated with a larger length with respect to the MQW structure can be
associated with the weaker FKE; however, the optical bandwidth is wider.

6.10.1
Integrated EAMs (EALs)
MQW EAMs typically have to be tailored to a speciﬁc laser source, due to the very nar-
row optical bandwidth. Since directly modulated lasers have poor chirp characteristics
(αH is always positive and somewhat large, e.g., 3–5), integration of a DFB laser with
an EAM appears as an interesting solution to increase the potential of the modulated
source for high-speed, long-distance transmission. Integrated lasers and EAMs (called
EALs or EMLs) are a commercial solution available today for transmission speed up
to 10 Gbps. Moreover, EAM are similar in size to the source, in contrast to electrooptic
semiconductor modulators, which are typically much larger than the source.
The development of EALs has to overcome a number of difﬁculties. Excellent iso-
lation must be provided both electronically and optically between the source and the
modulator; moreover, the two epitaxial layers should not be exactly the same, but some
detuning is needed to allow the EAM to operate properly. Figure 6.51 shows some
solutions for integration. In the butt-joint approach, the EAM is obtained by epitaxial
regrowth, and the structures can be independently optimized; however, the morphol-
ogy of the interface between the two is critical. In the selective area growth (SAG)
process the epitaxial growth takes place in both structures, but silicon dioxide layers
are deposited parallel to the DFB area; see Fig. 6.52(a). The presence of such layers
induces a slightly different composition (e.g., a larger In fraction) and thickness of the
epitaxial layers, which leads to a different Eg and therefore to detuning. An example is
shown in Fig. 6.52(b), where the SAG region (DFB) and the Field region (EAM) clearly
exhibit detuning (namely, the absorption edge of the unbiased EAM is at slightly higher
energy and lower wavelength than the DFB emission; note that the photoluminescence
peak energy is slightly lower than the absorption edge and shifts with the absorption
edge). Finally, the two structures can be derived from an identical layer, operating in
direct or reverse bias; in this case the growth is easier but a strong compromise must
be made between the two devices. An example of a 10 Gbps EAL developed by Avago
Technologies is shown in Fig. 6.53; the EAM is isolated both optically and electrically
from the laser, which operates in CW conditions. The structure chirp can be made posi-
tive or negative by varying the bias voltage; the resulting chirp typically is one order of
magnitude less than in a directly modulated laser [111].
Figure 6.54 ﬁnally shows a schematic picture of the traveling-wave EAL from NTT
[112]. In the traveling-wave mode the device exhibits a bandwidth larger than 40 GHz,
which reduces to 10 GHz in the lumped conﬁguration; see Fig. 6.55. Very-high speed

devices can therefore be realized, whose main limitation probably remains the higher
chirp with respect to the corresponding LN electrooptic modulators.
6.11
Modulator and laser biasing
Electrooptic and electroabsorption modulators typically require a bias voltage to be
superimposed onto the signal (digital or analog). In analog EOMs, biasing for maximum
linearity is at Vπ/2, while in digital applications, according to the signal generated by
the driver, the bias point can be at 0, Vπ/2, Vπ, corresponding to an amplitude of the zero
and one levels of (0, Vπ), ±Vπ/2, (−Vπ, 0), respectively. Several options are available
for implementing the bias circuit.
In EOMs, the RF and DC modulator inputs can be separated by implementing an
additional DC electrode in the phase modulation section. This solution is shown in
Fig. 6.56; the device length increases, but there is no need for a bias T (see Section 3.4.1)
separating the DC and the RF inputs. Note that the DC electrode has no requirements
on bandwidth (and also slightly weaker constraints on the applied voltage level); thus,
the length of the DC bias section can be different (typically smaller, to reduce the total
device length) with respect to the length of the modulating section. Increasing the DC
bias allows shortening of the DC electrode and the total device length.
Alternatively, the modulator can be driven by a single input including both the signal
and the bias. In this case, a bias T is needed, which can be external (see Fig. 6.57),
integrated into the modulator or, more commonly, integrated with the driver. The RF
load should be in any case DC blocked to avoid power dissipation and damage.
Bias Ts for high-speed modulators with ultrawide bandwidths (ranging, e.g., from
30 kHz to 40 GHz or from 50 kHz to 65 GHz) are available from several manufacturers;
often, such devices are also exploited for instrumentation. A sketch of a bias T is shown
in Fig. 6.58. Wideband discrete bias Ts are large and expensive devices, mainly due
to the need to offer enough DC blocking (between the RF and the DC inputs) and RF

shorting (between the DC input and the DC output) at a very low frequency (e.g., 30
kHz) but with technologies able to work also at the upper frequency (e.g., 40 GHz).
Wideband bias Ts often use a multiband design exploiting different component values
and technologies.
Laser diodes are in principle current-driven devices, implying that a high-impedance
DC current source should be used. Also, for lasers a bias T can be exploited to make
the device AC-coupled only; this allows reduction of the required bias supply value.
Typical laser bias currents are of the order of 10–100 mA; see [60], Ch. 8.
Due to the complex technology, wideband bias Ts are rarely integrated with the EAM,
EOM or laser, and a preferred solution is integration within the device driver. Modulator
drivers typically offer (for 10 Gbps or even 40 Gbps applications) peak-to-peak output
signal voltages up to 3 V, with bias control ranging, for example, from −10 to 5 V. Such
drivers are conceived for EAMs or for Mach–Zehnder LN modulators with optimized
driving voltages (typically 3 V or less at 10 Gbps, sometimes down to 2 V). However,

difﬁculties arise in drivers for LN 40 Gbps modulators, where typical input voltages are
of the order of Vπ ≈5 V or more.
6.12
Modulator and laser drivers
The modulator or laser driving stage at large integrates a few basic functions, such
as data multiplexing (MUX) from lower speed into the maximum channel speed (2.5,
10, 40 Gbps), data retiming and/or reshaping, modulator or laser biasing, and ﬁnally the
driver – see Fig. 6.59 for a simpliﬁed example of the driving stages for a MZ modulator.
The multiplexer-driver architecture is typically differential, to suppress common-mode
interferers and also, sometimes, to drive differential mode modulators (such as dual-
drive modulators).
The driver includes in principle three stages: (i) a pre-driver, often exploited as a
buffer to decouple the input capacitance of the driver and to provide logical level shift-
ing; typical pre-driver architectures include emitter- or source-follower stages; (ii) a
driver, whose purpose is to provide the switching voltage; and (iii) the driver ampli-
ﬁer, whose output is the input data stream with a suitably large driving voltage (for
modulators, 1.5–3 Vpp in EAMs, 3–6 Vpp in LN EOMs). Conventional solutions for
the driver stage can readily be derived from the so-called current-mode logic gates, see
Fig. 6.60(a), in which the driving voltage swing is able to alternately drive the two tran-
sistors of the differential pair in the off and on states, thus obtaining at the stage output
two complementary voltage levels.18 The ideal current source IM can be practically
implemented through a current mirror or other equivalent circuitry. Current-mode logic
gates have a limited input and output logical swing; with a bipolar implementation the
input swing could be of the order of 300 mV.
Figure 6.60(a) shows a current-mode gate loaded by a dummy load R′
D and by an
EAM connected to the output through a two-port including interconnects and the driver
18 The topology of current-mode gates is differential, similar to emitter coupled logics (ECL), see, e.g., [113].

ampliﬁer. The dummy load is introduced for symmetry; impedance matching must be
ensured (at least in the EAM bandwidth) at the “out” node, see Fig. 6.60(a), to avoid
multiple reﬂections between this node and the device. In a high-speed implementation
50  matching could be required. The EAM is shown as AC-coupled, with a bias T
made of an inductive block (the RF choke RFC) and a DC blocking capacitor (BC).
The frequency response of a directly coupled EAM (i.e., without a driver ampliﬁer)
can be improved by putting in series with the back termination resistor 2R′
D a peaking
inductor. In Fig. 6.60(b) the driven device is a distributed Mach–Zehnder modulator AC
coupled to an input bias T. We assume again that the device (itself a transmission line) is
impedance matched at the input and output to the load R′
L in order to suppress multiple
reﬂections leading to distortion (see Section 3.3.1). Finally, Fig. 6.60(c) shows an AC-
coupled laser; the bias supply is modeled as a current source, while the loading resistor
is in series (due to the low laser series impedance). Note that, due to the possibly large
laser DC current (e.g., around 100 mA), the voltage drop on the back termination could
be large (e.g., 5 V for a back termination of 50 ) and possibly incompatible with the
minimum voltage drop on the laser (of the order of 1.5–2 V).
From the standpoint of the implementation, the driver chain of high-speed systems
exhibits two critical points. First, the digital technology of the last MUX must be ade-
quate for the ﬁnal channel speed. 40 Gbps digital technology is limited by the material
choice (SiGe, GaAs, perhaps InP) and by the logical family (typically HBT emitter cou-
pled logic (ECL) or FET direct coupled FET logic (DCFL)). In very high-speed logic
families the output logic swing is low, e.g., 300–500 mV, and therefore direct driving
of the modulator or laser may be unfeasible. Secondly, the modulator driver ampliﬁer
must incorporate a number of conﬂicting requirements, mainly wideband operation,19
high maximum frequency but at the same time high output voltage. The required gain
depends on the modulator technology and on the output swing of the current mode
driver; for 40 Gbps systems exploiting LiNbO3 devices it can be as high as 27 dB, with
a ±1dB ﬂatness. The acceptable group delay is speciﬁc to the system standard and can
be of the order of ±10 ps on the whole band. The electrical bandwidth can range from
0.7Br to 1.3Br where Br is the bit rate; for 50 Gbps systems this means a bandwidth
from 60–100 kHz to more than 50 GHz.
While at 2.5 Gbps, and perhaps 10 Gbps, Si-based ICs may still provide a suitable
solution, for 40 Gbps operation the enabling technologies are SiGe, GaAs, and InP.
However, SiGe HBTs, though able to cover the 40 Gbps range, exhibit decreasing
device breakdown voltages with increasing cutoff frequency. An empirical rule for this
application is that the cutoff frequency should be 3–4 times the maximum operation
frequency; this leads to breakdown voltages of the order of 2 V for the SiGe technol-
ogy; see Fig. 6.61 [6]. SiGe drivers are therefore adequate as EAM drivers, but are
critical as LN MZ drivers for 40 Gbps EOMs. A considerably larger breakdown volt-
age, compatible with LN MZ modulator operation, is obtained with InP HBTs and,
19 Modulator drivers typically are not DC-coupled but exhibit a lower cutoff frequency that should be low
enough not to affect the bit rate. Values are standard-dependent, e.g., 64 kHz for 2.5 Gbps and 257 kHz for
10 Gbps SONET systems, respectively, see [60], Section 6.2.6.

even better, with GaAs-based HBTs. III-V FETs (in particular, PHEMTs) exhibit break-
down voltages in excess of 5 V (InP) and 10 V (GaAs), which allow 40 Gbps drivers to
be implemented in such technologies, with GaAs as a preferred material. A promis-
ing material for high-voltage applications could also be gallium nitride (GaN), whose
frequency performances are not, at least for the moment, adequate for 40 Gbps appli-
cations. In conclusion, 40 Gbps driver ampliﬁers for stages (like the MZ modulators on
LN) requiring large peak-to-peak voltages still are technologically demanding.
6.12.1
The high-speed driver ampliﬁer
Broadband ampliﬁers can be obtained through conventional open-loop or feedback cir-
cuit approaches. Resistive feedback applied to a high-gain ampliﬁer is a simple way
to achieve ﬂat gain over a broad frequency band; however, the open loop gain of the
ampliﬁer should be suitably larger than the gain with feedback at the maximum oper-
ating frequency. This is a difﬁcult requirement for 40 Gbps drivers, which often need
alternative broadbanding approaches.20 A number of circuit recipes for broadbanding
may be based on the compensation of the load capacitance through some inductive
element connected to the load (inductive peaking).
An interesting alternative approach, allowing broadband operation up to a frequency
that can, in theory, exceed the device cutoff frequency (but is, in practice, only somewhat
larger than fT /2), consists in turning the ampliﬁer into a distributed, traveling-wave
structure. This solution is called the distributed ampliﬁer, and will be discussed here,
for simplicity, in terms of a single-ended structure. Differential implementations are also
possible. The distributed ampliﬁer is also interesting from the standpoint of the operat-
ing principle, since it is an example of an electronic ampliﬁer exploiting a distributed or
quasi-distributed interaction, yielding wideband operation.

Continuous distributed ampliﬁer.
A somewhat idealized structure for the distributed FET (e.g., PHEMT) ampliﬁer is
made of an input (gate) transmission line connecting, in a continuous way, the input of
each inﬁnitesimal device cell. The output (drain) transmission line collects the current
injected by the transconductance generator. In the simpliﬁed model shown in Fig. 6.62,
the input line includes only a distributed per-unit-length (p.u.l.) inductance LG and a
distributed p.u.l. capacitance CG (mainly associated with the input gate–source capac-
itance). The output line includes the transconductance current generators (Gm = gm/L
is the p.u.l. device transconductance, gm being the total transconductance and L the
gate periphery) of p.u.l. current GmVG(z), and a p.u.l. inductance and capacitance LD
and CD.

Line attenuations αG and αD are for the moment neglected. Assume that the gate line
is matched at the input and output; the line input impedance will be Z0G and there-
fore VG(0) = Eg/2. Assume VG(0) = Vin as the line input voltage; since the line is
matched, only the forward-propagating wave exists, so that VG(z) = Vine−jβGz. On
the drain line, distributed transconductance current generators are present, of value
GmVG(z). We can therefore write the transmission line equations for the drain line
(by applying the Kirchhoff voltage and current laws to a transmission line cell of
length dz) as

The ampliﬁcation is maximum and becomes frequency-independent if the coupling
between the gate and drain lines is synchronous, i.e., if
βG = βD →LDCD = LGCG.
In this case, we have
|AV | = Z0Dgm

,
(6.41)
independent of frequency. If we account for losses in the drain and gate lines through
the attenuations αD and αG, the response becomes frequency-dependent also in case
of synchronous coupling; moreover, increasing the gate periphery L increases the
transconductance gm, but this effect is ultimately countered by the increase of the total
line attenuation, so that an optimum gate periphery exists:
Lopt = log (αD/αG)
αD −αG
.
In practice, distributed ampliﬁers are made with a number of discrete devices con-
nected on the inputs and outputs by delay lines, as shown in Fig. 6.63. The main
motivations for this design are the difﬁculty of achieving synchronous coupling in a
continuous device (due to the fact that the device input capacitance CGS typically is
much larger than the output capacitance CDS), and the large losses induced in the input
line by the extremely thin gate electrode. With the discrete setup, on the other hand, the
output line can be capacitively loaded so as to improve velocity matching (or the line
length can be properly increased to compensate delays), and losses can be decreased

due to the wider conductors used (typically 100 μm against less than 1 μm as in the
gate ﬁngers).
If we approximate the delay lines as LC discrete cells, the resulting gate and drain
lines become quasi-distributed structures known as artiﬁcial lines. In such structures,
the electrical behavior is similar to that of a transmission line for frequencies below a
cutoff frequency given by
fC =

where we have assumed that the two lines are velocity matched and have the same
characteristic impedance (and thus, the same p.u.l. parameters). In such conditions the
low-frequency voltage gain becomes
|AV (0)| = Z0
4 ngm,
where ngm is the total device transconductance, n being the number of cells. The gain–
bandwidth product will therefore be
|AV (0)| fC = Z0

in other words, the distributed structure increases the gain–bandwidth product with
respect to the single cell. In practice, the bandwidth obtained so far deteriorates fur-
ther because of the effect of the input and output line RF losses. Also in the discrete
cell case, there is an optimum cell number; in practice, FET-based distributed ampliﬁers
rarely exceed 10 cells.
Owing to the need for broadbanding the available devices as much as possible, a quite
popular conﬁguration in the design of distributed ampliﬁers for optoelectronic applica-
tions is the cascode cell conﬁguration. The cascode transistor conﬁguration (Fig. 6.64)
is, for a bipolar, a common emitter stage connected to a common base stage. The same
conﬁguration can be implemented in FETs with a common source and common gate
stage. The cascode conﬁguration decreases the internal feedback capacitance and there-
fore improves the device stability and bandwidth when compared to the conventional

stage. The two main consequences of the cascode conﬁguration are the broadbanding
and the more resonant response.
An example of high-speed MZ modulator driver cascode distributed ampliﬁer for
40 Gbps systems developed by Fujitsu is shown in Fig. 6.65 [114], [115]. The tech-
nology is a 0.15 μm InGaAs/GaAs PHEMT; the ampliﬁer is able to provide 6 V
peak-to-peak output voltage with a gain around 14 dB; the 3 dB electrical bandwidth
is 45 GHz. The electrical response is shown in Fig. 6.66.
In conclusion, the present transistor technology allows the development of high-
voltage, broadband ampliﬁers to be exploited as LN modulator drivers; however, the
distributed ampliﬁer solution is expensive in terms of enabling technology, circuit cost,
and power dissipation (ultrawideband ampliﬁers are typically class A ampliﬁers, with
rather poor efﬁciency; moreover, closing the ampliﬁer on a 50  matched load, a 5 V
peak-to-peak output with a square-wave behavior translates into a 250 mW average
power, with a dissipated power of 2.5 W assuming overall 10% efﬁciency). The devel-
opment of low-driving-voltage modulators is also fostered by the opportunity to reduce
the requirements on this component or eliminate it altogether in favor of a direct digital
driver.
