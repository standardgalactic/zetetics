Preface 
The book systematically expounds the main results obtained by the author in the 
ﬁeld of design and optimization of high-speed integrated circuits (ICs) and their 
standard blocks (heterogeneous ICs, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog con-
verters, input/output cells, etc.) operating in non-standard conditions (deviations of 
technological process parameters, supply voltage, ambient temperature, etc.). The 
proposed methods are based on machine learning and consider effects of different 
external and internal destabilizing factors (radiation exposure, self-heating, 
nonideality of the power source, input signals, interconnects, power rails, etc.). 
The main goals of most proposed methods and solutions of design and optimi-
zation of high-speed ICs are to improve important parameters and characteristics 
(performance, power consumption, occupied area on the die, transmitting and 
receiving data quality and accuracy) of circuits and reduce the effects of 
non-standard operating conditions and different types of destabilizing factors. 
The book is anticipated for scientists and engineers specializing in the ﬁeld of IC 
design and optimization as well as for students and postgraduate students studying 
disciplines related to IC design.

Introduction 
Over the past 60 years, the semiconductor industry has evolved according to 
Moore’s law, which has allowed to have metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) tran-
sistors or their different modiﬁcations (FinFET, GAA (Gate All Around), etc.) with 
channel lengths up to several nanometers. Leading companies/manufacturers, such 
as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), Global Foundries 
(GF), and Samsung, have already developed 7, 5, and 3-nanometer technologies of 
IC fabrication. In the coming years, it is even possible to move to transistors with 
several Angstrom sizes. At present, already produced ICs contain more than hundred 
billions of active devices in ICs. Taking the planned transition to several Angstrom 
size technologies in the near future into account, the number of circuit components 
will soon increase signiﬁcantly and can reach up to trillion. Such kind of fast 
developments have led to the enormous changes of the main parameters and 
characteristics of ICs. 
Fast developments in semiconductor industry ﬁrst affected the performance of 
ICs. The productivity of ICs drastically increased because the small size of transis-
tors decreases their parasitic parameters and allows to have more functional blocks 
on the same area. That is why the operating frequencies of ICs have also increased, 
reaching dozens of GHz. 
In addition to high-speed operation of contemporary ICs, the speed of transmis-
sion of information between them is also growing drastically. Modern electronic 
systems include different ICs, which are located independently of each other in the 
same Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and perform various functions. These ICs are in 
constant communication with each other and exchange processed information. 
Signiﬁcant increase in the volume of transmitted data between different ICs dictates 
the necessity of high-speed transmission of information between them. Currently, 
the speed reaches up to 256 and 512 Gbit/s. For accurate operation of the entire 
electronic system, it is necessary to ensure correct transmission of information 
between different ICs of the system. Therefore, there is need to design special 
basic blocks in ICs that will ensure transmission and reception of information 
throughout the system. Such function is performed by specially designed input/
ix

output (I/O) cells implemented in ICs. I/O cells are one of the most important 
components of contemporary ICs. The new standards of information transmission 
by I/O cells are aimed at increasing speed. For example, 4th generation Universal 
Serial Bus (USB) devices provide 40 Gbps data transfer speed, while 1st generation 
USB standard provided only 12 Mbit/s speed. Among the modern data transmission 
standards are Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express, Serial Advanced 
Technology Attachment (ATA), Double Data Rate (DDR), low-power DDR, High-
Deﬁnition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), etc. These standards have many varieties 
that operate at different frequencies. They also differ from each other in their 
application. For example, DDR standard provides communication between com-
puter core and external devices. Low-power DDR standard provides communication 
in modern smart phones. In the mentioned standards, information is transmitted 
sequentially using two transmission lines. Such choice of the number of transmission 
lines is related to the advantages of differential signal. It allows getting two-times 
increase in the signal level as well as avoiding the inﬂuence of common component 
of noise.

Introduction
Development of high-speed ICs and their different blocks (in particular, I/Os) 
have led to strict requirements for IC reliability and need to develop means of 
designing ICs that work in non-standard operating conditions. Disruption of IC 
operation can directly or indirectly lead to serious economic losses, environmental 
damage, or threats to human life. The reduction in transistor sizes led to thinning of 
oxide layer of transistor gates which allowed reducing their threshold voltage. The 
low threshold voltage, in turn, allowed reducing supply voltages of ICs, leading to 
the reduction of power consumption. The development of technological process has 
made it possible to reduce the distance between metal layers, leading to an increase 
in the density of interconnects. In case of closer wires, the mutual capacitances 
between them increase. Large capacitances lead to an increase in the noise level. In 
modern ICs, the value of the supply voltage has become several hundred millivolts, 
and noises reach tens of millivolts. An increase in noise and a decrease in the value of 
the supply voltage led to a decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. This reduces the 
noise immunity of modern ICs and can lead to unwanted changes in the character-
istics of circuits, up to functional failure. The new generation I/O cells are faster and 
work with lower supply voltages, which signiﬁcantly complicates the processes of 
data reading and transfer. It should be noted that as a result of reducing the supply 
voltage, ICs become sensitive to external and internal destabilizing factors, and due 
to the increase in speed, the transmission line begins to signiﬁcantly suppress the 
transmitted data which makes data processing even more difﬁcult. Currently, there 
are also high-precision IC types which provide extremely high reliability. They are 
mainly used in medical ﬁelds, space equipment, etc. Since the loss of data in the 
above areas can lead to great damage, I/O cells in high-precision ICs are equipped 
with systems to increase the reliability of data transmission and reading. With the 
increase of data transfer rates, deviations of timing parameters of data become an 
extremely important problem. In modern I/O cells, the fastest data change time 
reaches picoseconds. In that case, even small deviations of timing parameters can 
lead to data error. The main obstacles to increasing the speed of data transmitted in

I/O cells and their lossless transmission are process-voltage-temperature deviations, 
the inﬂuence of transmission lines, deviations caused in transmitter sub-connections, 
etc. The increase in operating frequencies, the density of transistors and intercon-
nects per unit area, and the reduction of the thickness of the oxide layer have made 
the inﬂuence of undesirable phenomena of self-heating and aging on the operation of 
ICs more tangible. It leads to complications in the IC design process. The develop-
ment of ICs and their different blocks operating in non-standard conditions becomes 
a critical issue. There is a need to develop new methods of designing ICs that operate 
under non-standard conditions, which will reduce self-heating and aging phenomena 
on the operation of circuits while increasing the noise immunity and efﬁciency. 
Introduction
xi
Thus, an extreme need arises for the development of design and optimization 
methods of high-speed ICs and their separate blocks. For example, the design of 
means to restore the distorted signal has become extremely relevant at present, 
because due to the increase in the amount of data processed in high-speed systems, 
in order to meet the demand for increasing the speed of their transmission, the speed 
of reception of sequential information is limited by the amplitude-frequency char-
acteristics of the channel. Another example is that, as a result of changes in external 
factors, the deviation of transistor parameters and the increase in the effect of aging 
phenomena have led to decrease in the efﬁciency of calibration nodes and equalizers 
included in ICs, which can even lead to functional failures. From another side, the 
development of design methods for ICs that will work under non-standard operating 
conditions has become an extremely important challenge. As an example, one of the 
most relevant problems in the creation of modern ICs is the development of signal 
transmission calibration means, which can signiﬁcantly improve their main param-
eters and contribute to further increase in the speed of I/O cells. 
The existing means of design and optimization of high-speed ICs are not able to 
solve the mentioned problems since they are oriented at larger technology nodes and 
other operating conditions. A series of reasons exist that make it difﬁcult to apply the 
existing means and available methods of design and optimization of high-speed ICs 
in contemporary real IC design practice. For example, experimental studies of 
existing means of increasing the speed of receiving sequential information and the 
results of their analysis show that they do not completely solve the problems in ICs 
and have several time limitations that are unacceptable from the point of view of 
practical application. That circumstance dictates the need to develop more effective 
means of the mentioned class. The existing means of designing ICs working in 
non-standard operating conditions are based on calibration algorithms and are 
oriented at technological processes of larger sizes. In addition, the possibility of 
sudden changes in temperature and voltage after calibration and the increased 
inﬂuence of aging phenomena typical of modern technologies are not taken into 
account. This indicates that the latter do not meet modern requirements, and the need 
to develop new solutions to increase stability and reliability of ICs has arisen. 
Research of existing approaches and means of signal transmission systems in ICs 
shows that although they provide signiﬁcant improvement in speed, data transmis-
sion and reading reliability, and power consumption, from the point of view of

efﬁciency, the latter do not meet the modern requirements for practical design. Such 
kind of examples are too many.

Introduction
The development of means of design and optimization of high-speed ICs has now 
become a decisive part in the process of IC design. The problems, solved during 
design and especially the optimization of high-speed ICs, require huge amount of 
computations because of enormous number of components and options of consid-
ering versions of designing circuits and their operating modes. From this point of 
view and taking into account current rise of machine learning (ML), connected with 
the occurrence of big data and more powerful computing resources in the last few 
years, ML methods and tools can be considered as most suitable during design and 
optimization of high-speed ICs. 
This monograph is devoted to description of the developed new principles, 
methods, and circuit solutions for design and optimization of high-speed ICs, 
based on ML. In the monograph different effective new principles, methods, solu-
tions, and means of design and optimization of high-speed ICs are proposed. For 
example, effective approaches from the point of view of timing limitations for the 
development of means to increase speed of sequential information reception of ICs 
have been proposed. The embedded nodes and the structure of their architecture 
allow to signiﬁcantly increase data transfer and processing frequencies in case of 
increasing the area occupied on the die and power consumption within the permis-
sible limits. Methods of IC design that work in non-standard operating conditions 
have been proposed which meet modern requirements and, at the expense of 
increasing the occupied area and power consumption within the permissible limits, 
signiﬁcantly reduce the deviations caused by changes in external and internal 
destabilizing factors and aging phenomena. Principles and methods of developing 
signal transmission calibration means in ICs have been proposed, which allow to 
signiﬁcantly improve their main technical characteristics and parameters: speed, 
reliability of data transfer and reading, power consumption. 
The author expresses deep gratitude to his PhD students Manvel Grigoryan, 
Hakob Kostanyan, Karen Khachikyan, Arman Atanesyan, Taron Kaplanyan, and 
Suren Abazyan, who have participated in the development of described means. 
The author would also like to thank his colleague Ruzanna Goroyan who assisted 
in the preparation of this monograph.

Importance of Means to Accelerate Transfer 
of Information Between Integrated Circuits 
It is difﬁcult to imagine the operation of modern electronic systems without inte-
grated circuits (ICs), which are located independently of each other and perform 
various functions [1–5]. Despite this, ICs are in constant communication with each 
other and exchange processed information [6, 7]. Over time, the reduction of the 
minimum channel length of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) 
transistors allows to include a larger number of components in an IC and increase 
their functions [8]. Thus, the amount of processed and transmitted data increases. 
For the accurate operation of the entire system, it is necessary to ensure the correct 
transmission of information between different ICs of the system [9, 10]. Therefore, 
there is a need to design special basic working blocks in ICs that will ensure the 
transmission and reception of information throughout the system. Such a function is 
performed by specially designed input-output (I/O) cells implemented in ICs [11– 
13]. Currently, there are many structures of I/O cells that are used in various systems. 
Over time, the continuous scaling of the channel of CMOS transistors has led to 
an increase in data transfer rates, as well as a decrease in supply voltages. Therefore, 
due to the I/O cells in ICs, the new standards of information transmission are aimed 
at increasing speed. For example, fourth-generation Universal Serial Bus (USB) 
devices provide 40 Gbps data transfer speed, while ﬁrst-generation USB standard 
provided only 12 Mbit/s speed [14]. Among the modern data transmission standards, 
Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) Express, Serial Advanced Technology 
Attachment (ATA), double data rate (DDR), low-power DDR, and High-Deﬁnition 
Multimedia Interface (HDMI) standards are also notable [15–19]. The above stan-
dards also have many varieties that operate at different frequencies.

Data transmission standards also differ from each other in their application. For 
example, the DDR standard provides communication between the computer core 
and external devices, and the low-power DDR standard provides communication 
between modern smartphones. 
In the above standards, information is transmitted sequentially using two trans-
mission lines. Such a choice of the number of transmission lines is related to the 
advantages of the differential signal [20]. It allows to get a two-time increase in the 
signal level, as well as to avoid the inﬂuence of the common component of noises. 
Although there are special I/O cells that use the parallel method of data transfer [21– 
23], the sequential method is considered more preferable. This is due to the increase 
in the cost of the system as a result of adding additional channels during parallel 
transmission. The parallel transmission method also leads to an inevitable increase in 
the surface area of the IC due to the need for additional nodes for signal transmission, 
reception, and restoration. 
Special blocks generating and processing a clock signal are an important part of 
special I/O cells performing the function of sequential information transmission and 
reception in ICs [24–26]. In general, three types of architectures with clock signal are 
distinguished in I/O cells: common, transmitted, and embedded [27–29]. 
In the case of a common clock signal architecture, there is one main quartz 
generator that provides exchange of reference clock signal to two functioning ICs 
(Fig. 1.1). 
Such a structure requires providing equal-length interconnects to reduce the phase 
shift between the clock signals provided to two ICs. The architecture with a common 
clock signal allows to provide up to 100 Mb/s speed, so it is designed for low-power 
systems. 
In the case of architecture with a transmitted clock signal, the transmitting IC 
provides a reference clock signal to the receiver (Fig. 1.2). 
Necessity rises to add an additional routing between the transmitter and receiver 
nodes in the system to ensure the transmission of the clock signal. Such an

architecture is used in both processor-memory and multiprocessor communication 
interfaces. However, the disadvantage of the system is the limitation of the trans-
mitted clock signal speed due to the frequency characteristics of the transmission 
channel. Since the channel has a characteristic similar to a low-pass ﬁlter, it 
signiﬁcantly affects the transmitted clock signal by distorting its duty cycle and 
causes rise/falls to form at different times [30, 31]. There is also a need to design 
special fundamental blocks that will perform function of equalization for clock 
signal [32].

In the embedded clock signal architecture, there are basic blocks that provide 
reference clock signal and are present at both the receiver and transmitter (Fig. 1.3). 
This architecture is used in “mesochronous” and “plesiochronous” systems 
[33, 34]. At the receiver, the frequency and optimal phase position of the clock 
signal are obtained from the input data stream. To perform the above function, 
special clock data recovery (CDR) blocks are designed, which can use the output 
signal of phase-locked loop (PLL) as a reference clock signal [35–40]. Such a 
structure provides higher performance and lower cost for the overall system, but 
increases the problems that rise during the design.

I/O cells consist of the transmitter and receiver nodes as well as special cells that 
provide reference voltage and current and perform system setup (Fig. 1.4) [41–49]. 
The transmitter and receiver are connected by a channel. It includes all the 
components by which information is exchanged and is made up of wires and via 
connections (Fig. 1.5).

Fig. 1.6 Microstrip and strip line structure of conductors in channels 
Fig. 1.7 Structure of straight and backdrilled inter-level vias 
Conductors in channels can be of two types: microstrip and strip line (Fig. 1.6) 
[50, 51]. 
Although the strip line structure of wires is more complicated and implies higher 
costs during the manufacturing process, it allows to signiﬁcantly avoid the noise 
caused by the effect of interconnects which is even more fundamental in the case of a 
differential signal. 
There are also two types of vias located on the printed circuit board: straight and 
backdrilled (Fig. 1.7) [52–54]. 
Straight inter-level vias add extra zeros to the overall channel transfer function 
and increase the amount of signal distortion. This can be avoided if their isolated 
parts are removed at an additional stage during the manufacturing process. As a 
result, the cost of the system increases, but a more linear characteristic of the channel 
is obtained. 
Increasing the speed of information exchange standards implemented by modern 
high-speed I/O cells makes the presentation format with centralized parameters of 
the channel impermissible [55–57], because such an approach does not take into 
account the following:
•
Voltage drops in wires
•
Changing magnetic ﬁeld
•
Bias currents
•
Conduction currents due to dielectric imperfection

Fig. 1.8 A long line structure with distributed parameters 
Therefore, increasing the frequency of the supply voltage is a necessary condition 
for presenting the channel as a long line with distributed parameters. It is made up of 
a large number of r0, g0, L0, and C0 components (Fig. 1.8). 
R0 and g0 are conditioned by thermal and dielectric losses, and L0 and C0 
components model the interactions of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds between the 
conductors. It is convenient to consider such lines, the above-mentioned primary 
parameters of which are constant along the entire line [58]. Such lines are called 
homogeneous. Applying Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws, the differential equations for 
a homogeneous line can be obtained:

ð1:2Þ 
From the differential equations it follows that V(x,t) and I(x,t) are functions 
containing two variables, so the transmitted signal has a wave nature, and reﬂections 
are observed in case of line mismatch. The wave impedance of a homogeneous line 
is determined by the following formula: 
Z0 = V x

ð1:3Þ 
In modern technologies, the conventional unit of 50 Ohm is chosen as the optimal 
value of wave resistance in the intermediate range of the smallest losses and the 
largest transmitted power [59]. The reﬂection coefﬁcients at the transmitter (Kt) and 
receiver (Kr) nodes are determined as follows: 
Kt = Rout - Z0 
Rout þ Z0 ,
ð1:4Þ

þ

Kr = Rinput - Z0 
Rinput 
Z0 ,
ð1:5Þ 
where Rout corresponds to the output resistance of the conducting node and Rinput 
corresponds to the input resistance of the receiving node. Therefore, resistance 
termination blocks (RTBs) are designed, which provide a resistance value of 50 Ω, 
regardless of supply voltage, temperature, and technological deviations [60–63]. To 
ensure such accuracy, external resistors placed outside the IC are often used, the 
accuracy of which varies in the range of ±3%. 
There are four basic resistance termination architectures [58]:
•
Non-terminated architecture
•
Termination only in transmitter
•
Termination only in the receiver
•
Termination both in the transmitter and receiver 
In the ﬁrst case, there is no RTB in either the transmitter or receiver. Such an 
architecture is designed for low-power systems and works with rather short channels. 
It allows to save the area on the die due to the absence of RTBs, but it limits the 
performance of the system. Only the architecture with the RTB implemented in 
transmitter is intended for medium-performance systems, but in this case, the value 
of the output voltage of the transmitter is established in two stages, for a period twice 
the delay time of the channel. When the RTB is implemented only at the receiver, 
ideally the signal is no longer reﬂected back to transmitter. However, technological 
deviations and non-ideality of the system exclude the precise setup of the resistance 
value, which leads to reﬂections that do not fade in the transmitter. Two-way built-in 
RTB ensures minimal reﬂections and increases system reliability. It is the best 
architecture to avoid reﬂections. However, in this case, there is a loss of the signal 
level twice at the expense of the resulting voltage divider. Such a loss is compensated 
by a differential signal transmission option. This is the reason why modern high-
speed systems use an architecture with a built-in bidirectional RTB and send the 
signal in a differential form. 
The presence of R0 and g0 components in a channel is conditional to both thermal 
and skin effect and dielectric absorption [64, 65]. As a result of the skin effect, the 
functional resistance of the conductor decreases as the frequency increases: 
R fð  Þ = Rh 
f 
f s 
,
ð1:6Þ 
where fs is the frequency when the predominant part of the current passes through 
half of the area of the wire and Rh corresponds to the resistance of the wire in case of 
a constant signal. Therefore, the losses due to the resistive component in coordinated 
long lines can be represented by the following formula:

/R = R 
2Z0 = Rh 
2Z0 
f 
f s 
:
ð1:7Þ 
It follows from the above formula that the losses due to the skin effect are a 
function of the frequency and increase along with its increase. 
The effect of dielectric absorption is due to the phenomenon of free dipoles 
absorbing thermal energy. When a direct concentrated electric ﬁeld is applied, the 
free dipoles change their direction and absorb thermal energy. 
The dielectric absorption effect in aligned long lines can be estimated by the 
following formula: 
/D = G  Z0 
2 
= π  f  C  tan δD 
L 
C :
ð1:8Þ 
As can be seen from the obtained formula, the losses due to dielectric absorption 
are directly proportional to the frequency. 
Calculation of losses due to skin effect and dielectric absorption gives a rather 
accurate picture to estimate losses of terminated long line (Fig. 1.9). 
The obtained graph shows that the signal in long lines is suppressed as the 
frequency increases. Summarizing, it can be noted that the increase of the operating 
frequency is limited by the frequency characteristics of long lines. Therefore, there is 
a need to restore the transmitted signal in the receiver before the reading process. To 
perform this function, special equalizers are designed in the transmitter and receiver, 
which will provide equalization of the signal in the operating frequency range. 
It is also noteworthy that the four-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) of 
signal transmission is used in modern sequential information transmission standards 
[66–72]. It allows to get the same speed, but reduce the frequency of signal 
transmission twice.

That is, an arbitrary signal transmitted by I/O cells can be analyzed into an inﬁnite 
or ﬁnite number of sinusoidal signals with different frequencies (Fig. 1.10). 
Considering that the frequency characteristics of long lines decrease nonlinearly 
as the frequency increases, it can be said that different harmonic components of the 
transmitted signal are modiﬁed to different extents. 
Therefore, the equalizer, built into the transmitter, should amplify the high-
frequency components of the signal and ensure full equalization of the signal in 
the operating frequency range (Fig. 1.11) [76–78]. 
Equalization of the fundamental harmonics of the signal is an important condi-
tion, because high-frequency components are considered as noise. Therefore, it is 
necessary to increase the operating frequency and gain of the equalizer in that 
domain. 
To estimate signal distortions, it is convenient to use the eye diagram [79–83]. It 
represents the superposition of all transmitted bits, which is obtained as a result of 
dividing the transmitted data by its paragraph size. The advantage of the method is 
that it allows to estimate the timing parameters of a signal of arbitrary length by 
means of a graphical representation. Below are the amplitude-frequency character-
istics of a 17-inch-long channel and the eye diagram of a signal transmitted at 5 GHz 
(Fig. 1.12). 
The eye diagram shows that the signal is completely distorted and cannot be read 
at the receiver. In addition to the equalizer, implemented in the receiver node, a 
digital ﬁlter with a ﬁnite impulse response of several orders is applied in the

transmitter node, which is able to perform signal equalization to some extent 
(Fig. 1.13) [84–87].

As it can be seen from the eye diagram, the transmitted signal can be recovered 
using a sufﬁciently accurate operating comparator. However, technological devia-
tions and design difﬁculties do not allow using the mentioned method in more high-
performance systems. Therefore, there is an inevitable demand for the development 
and design of information recovery means at the receiving node. Thus, the design of 
means of increasing the speed of sequential information reception and processing in 
the receiving node is one of the problems of modernizing IC development.

1.1.2 
Current State and Issues of Existing Means 
of Increasing the Speed of Receiving Sequential 
Information in an Integrated Circuit 
In systems containing multiple ICs, various measures are used to ensure error-free 
transmission and reception of data. Their application depends on the standard of 
signal transmission, as well as on the physical dimensions and amplitude-frequency 
characteristics of the channel in PCB. Small distortions caused by a sufﬁciently short 
channel can be recovered even by means of an analog receiver block (ARB) 
[88, 89]. Such a choice may also be due to the low frequency of the signal 
transmitted in the system. Although various low-frequency communication systems 
still exist today, the increase in speed due to modern signal transmission standards 
has led to the need to design new methods [90]. However, the technical qualiﬁca-
tions of modern standards require that their implementation in the systems also 
provides the possibility of low-power operation [14–19]. Therefore, the effective-
ness of the means depends on the technical conditions of the speciﬁc system. 
The main parameters of the means of receiving sequential information are the 
maximum operating frequency and gain, the linearity of the implemented nodes, the 
area occupied by the IC, its power consumption, and, of course, the cost of the 
system. It is also necessary to take into account the inﬂuence of the noise sources of 
the node or nodes introduced in the system, which is even more fundamental in the 
case of the application of four-level amplitude modulation for signal transmission, 
because in this case the signal voltage reserves are reduced. It is also often necessary 
to apply several measures together in order to achieve the desired outcome. 
Existing Methods to Increase the Speed of Continuous Time Linear Equalizer 
(CTLE) 
The channel has a characteristic of a low-pass ﬁlter, and as the frequency increases, 
the signal distortions become more fundamental. Therefore, there is a need to design 
a special basic block in the receiver node, which will have a high-pass ﬁlter 
characteristic and will be able to perform signal equalization [91, 92]. 
In one of the well-known approaches, it is proposed to use active and passive 
continuous time linear equalizer (CTLE) [93]. A passive CTLE is a combination of 
high- and low-pass ﬁlters made up of resistors and capacitors (Fig. 1.15) [94, 95]. 
The transfer function of the circuit is: 
H sð  Þ = 
R2 
R1 þ R2 
1 þ R1  C1  s 
1 þ R1R2 
R1þR2  C1 þ C2
ð
Þ  s ,
ð1:11Þ 
where R1, R2, C1, and C2 correspond to passive CTLE resistor and capacitor values. 
It can be seen from the transfer function that it has one zero and one pole, which are 
determined as follows:

ð1:13Þ 
where As is the ampliﬁcation of the system to ωzero frequency and Aa is the gain of the 
circuit in the range above ωpole frequency. It can be seen from (1.12) that the gain of 
the passive CTLE at low frequencies depends only on the ratio of resistances and 
does not affect it in the high frequency range. It is determined by the capacitance 
ratio. This allows to apply different ratios for the above components and get a 
positive change in the gain as the frequency increases. To evaluate this change, the 
ratio between Aa and As is considered. 
Aa 
As =

ωzero = R1 þ R2

ð1:14Þ 
However, it follows from (1.13) that the absolute value of the gain is smaller than 
1 both at low and high frequencies. Therefore, passive CTLE partially solves the 
signal equalization problem and cannot provide sufﬁcient gain. 
Active CTLE consists of two proportional differential branches connected by a 
resistor and capacitor (Fig. 1.16) [96]. They are designed to suppress the 
low-frequency harmonics of the signal. 
The transfer function of the circuit is determined by:

are the feedback resistance and capacitance, respectively.

ð1:16Þ 
The formula characterizing the dependence of the maximum value of the circuit gain 
is determined below: 
Aa = gm  Rload:
ð1:17Þ 
At sufﬁciently low frequencies, when the complex resistance of Cf is sufﬁciently 
greater than the resistance of Rf, it can be neglected and the circuit observed as a 
degraded common-source ampliﬁer. Therefore, the gain of the circuit in the low 
frequency range is: 
Ah = gm  Rload 
1 þ gmRf=2 :
ð1:18Þ 
Obviously, there will be a difference in the gain at low and high frequencies. To 
estimate this, the relative gain (RG) parameter is introduced, which is determined by 
the following formula: 
RG = ωpole1 
ωzero = 1 þ gmRf=2:
ð1:19Þ 
A high value of RG makes it possible to perform signal equalization in the case of 
longer channels, when the recovery of its high-frequency components becomes more 
fundamental. But no less important is the possibility of changing the RG, which 
allows to restore the signal, coming from different channels.

CTLE RG is controlled by a binary code (Fig. 1.17). 
The C1 capacitor, implemented in the presented structure, provides greater 
reliability against noises caused by power buses and increases their suppression 
factor. It allows to ﬁlter the relevant harmonics of the noises and as a result keep the 
gate-source voltage of the M1 transistor constant. Since the M1 transistor is a current 
source in the differential branch, its constant current value ensures the reduction of 
the vibration caused by the noise of the power supply jitter of the entire system. 
The system also includes a binary code-driven resistance and capacitance matrix 
(RCM) (Fig. 1.18).

diagram of the sequential 
information processing 
algorithm in the receiver 
It is a combination of code-controlled high-pass and low-pass ﬁlters that allow the 
overall system gain and therefore the RG to be changed. Thus, the implemented 
RCM allows to solve the problem of working with different channels. However, this 
is done due to the reduction of the gain in the low frequency range, which after 
equalization setup leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the output signal. 
Thus, reception and processing of sequential information at the receiver node is 
performed in phases and by adjusting the RCM control codes (Fig. 1.19). 
In the ﬁrst stage, due to feedback, system setup is performed, during which the 
optimal codes for signal reception are selected. Then, the noise from the supply 
voltage is ﬁltered out of the equalized signal, and the sequential information is 
converted to parallel. 
To evaluate the performance of the system, frequency analysis was performed 
and its amplitude-frequency characteristics were obtained for all possible codes 
(Fig. 1.20). 
It can be seen from Fig. 1.20 that the introduction of the controlled RCM in the 
system does not affect the maximum gain and allows to control its value at low 
frequencies. There is also the possibility to control the ωzero frequency, which allows 
to perform optimal system setup when using different channels. 
However, the results are strongly dependent on the technological process, as well 
as on the change of supply voltage and temperature. All corner cases of CTLE 
frequency parameters with embedded RCM are summarized in Table 1.1 
Simulation of power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) was also performed, the 
characteristics of which for typical and worst cases are shown in Fig. 1.21. 
The obtained results of PSRR indicate that its absolute value is about 35% more 
than the amount required by the USB standard [14].

Thus, the presented method of increasing the speed allows to increase the 
frequency of the transmitted signal. However, the equalization of the signal using 
the method ensures a lower level of the output signal, which makes the problem of its 
processing in the next node more fundamental. Therefore, the applied method cannot 
completely solve the proposed problems. 
Existing Methods to Increase the Speed of the Decision Feedback Equalizer 
(DFE) 
An increase in the frequency of the transmitted signal leads to an increase in the 
effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI). In the case of ISI, the value of the voltage in 
each level of the transmitted signal is determined by the superposition of the 
previous and next bits. Therefore, there is an inevitable requirement to design and 
implement new nodes for signal recovery and processing. In one of the well-known 
approaches, it is proposed to introduce a decision feedback equalization circuit 
(DFE), which is a digital ﬁlter with ﬁnite impulse response, after the CTLE in the 
receiver node [97, 98].

Means to Accelerate Transfer of Information Between Integrated Circuits
For even and odd taps of transmitted information, two branches are implemented, 
the selection of which is made using multiplexers. Since feedback timing parameters 
are a primary concern in DFEs implemented in modern high-speed I/O cells, it was 
decided to use the output of the multiplexers as the control signal of the parallel 
branch [99]. As a result, the formed feedback coefﬁcient (H1) is added 
(or subtracted) to the input signal, and the decision is made already taking into 
account the digital value of the previous bit. 
Figure 1.24 shows the architecture of comparators implemented in a 1-tap DFE. 
The presence of N1a and N1b transistors provides isolation between input and 
output signals. And N3a and N3b transistors isolate the input pair from the clock 
signal. Thus, the above-mentioned transistors increase the noise resistance of the 
system.

The Idp and Idn reference currents are controlled by digital-to-analog converters 
(DACs) (Fig. 1.25). 
Reference current control provides capability to adjust the difference between the 
output voltages caused by the non-ideality of the manufacturing process. The 
experimental results prove that the current DAC can compensate the deviation 
voltage up to 50 mV. 
Transient simulation was performed to evaluate the performance of the system, 
and the obtained results were summarized in eye diagrams (Fig. 1.26).

Fig. 1.27 2 (a) and 4 (b) PAMs 
The simulation results prove that the architecture of the proposed receiver, which 
consists of a CTLE and a 1-tap DFE, allows to realize sequential information 
reception at a frequency of 5 GHz. 
Thus, the implementation of a 1-tap DFE in the receiver allows to compensate the 
noise caused by ICI and to increase the transmission frequency of the signal. 
However, even with the use of multi-tap DFE, the speed of signal transmission is 
limited by the speed of the elements in the system. Therefore, the applied method has 
clear limitations, and there is a problem of designing an architecture with elements 
with higher speed. 
Existing Methods to Increase the Speed of Reception of Sequential Information 
Using Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) 
PAM2 has been used for signal transmission for decades. However, the amplitude-
frequency characteristics of the channel show that the increase in the frequency of 
the signal is limited by practically irreversible distortions. For this reason, over time, 
they also started to use PAM4, which allows to transmit twice as much information 
at the same signal frequency [100, 101] (Fig. 1.27). 
In the case of PAM4, each signal level corresponds to 2 bits of information. 
Therefore, the same data transmission speed can be obtained by using twice lower 
frequency. However, such an approach leads to a reduction of the voltage reserve 
between two neighboring levels, which further tightens the noise immunity 
requirements. 
Figure 1.28 shows the architecture of a PAM4-enabled receiver. 
In the ﬁrst stage, equalization of distorted signal is implemented using the CTLE. 
Then, the embedded three comparators, which have different offsets, perform a 
signal level check. The checked values are stored in subsequent triggers, which are 
controlled by the synchronizing signal generated by the embedded PLL. The values

stored in the triggers are transformed from thermometric to unary code by means of a 
decoder.

In order to perform a three-stage comparison, a voltage shifting ampliﬁer (VSA) 
and an output buffer were used. M1/M2 and M3/M4 transistors embedded in VSA 
are not differential pairs, because the reference currents in their branches (I1~I4) are 
different (Fig. 1.29). Such a structure ampliﬁes the signal with the appropriate 
amplitude and provides only its variable component so that the output buffer 
makes the right decision. 
Figure 1.30 shows the results of transient simulation. 
The complete system results are presented in Table 1.2.

Thus, the method of using the PAM4 of the signal makes it possible to signiﬁ-
cantly increase the speed of data transfer. The architecture of the presented receiver 
allows to perform PAM4 signal reception, processing, and transformation into a 
binary code. However, when using the method, there is a need to design a high-
precision and high-speed three-level comparator, as the voltage margin between 
adjacent signal levels decreases. In the case of such an architecture, the speed of the 
receiving node is also limited by the use of nodes implemented in the comparator. 
1.1.3 
Proposed Approaches to Increase the Speed 
of Receiving Sequential Information in an Integrated 
Circuit 
The existing methods and approaches to increase the speed of receiving sequential 
information in an integrated circuit do not fully meet its current requirements. 
Therefore, the development of new solutions and methods continues to be a current 
issue. Based on this, the following approaches have been proposed: 
1. Implementation of a neg-C circuit, controlled by a current DAC in CTLE 
(Fig. 1.31). 
Such an architecture will ensure a decrease in the output complex resistance of the 
CTLE and, therefore, an increase in the bandwidth of the entire system. This, in turn, 
will increase the gain of the system at operating frequencies. In order to ensure the 
same gain in the entire operating range of the output signal, there will be an 
inevitable need to adjust the linearity of the implemented circuits. Adjustment of 
the thermometric branches in the current DAC will ensure the linearity of the output 
current and exclude the loss of the code. And in neg-C circuit, the linearity setup 
system controlled by the constant component of the signal will ensure the uniform 
change of its currents in the differential branches. As a result, with an increase in the 
area occupied on the die and the power consumption within the permissible limits, 
such an architecture will allow to equalize the signal with a higher frequency and a 
larger output operating range.

2. Building DFE architecture with specially designed high-speed comparators 
(Fig. 1.32). 
The proposed comparator architecture will provide low input capacitance and 
faster output signal switching. After switching, the voltage difference caused by 
charge diffusion of different levels of output signals and in the channels of transistors 
that function as a switch will be adjusted by a special system controlled by the clock 
signal. It will also allow to reduce the offset in the system. Thus, the proposed DFE 
architecture, due to the nonsigniﬁcant increase in power consumption, will reduce 
the timing constraints of the entire system and allow to increase the frequency of the 
received signal.

3. Application of higher-speed receiver architecture, operating with PAM4 
(Fig. 1.33). 
In order to reduce the timing constraints during the process of determining the 
order of the equalized signal at the receiver, it is recommended to use four propor-
tional branches that will work in sequence. The sample-hold blocks in them, which 
work with a synchronous signal with a uniform phase shift, will record the level of 
the signal in the given branch until the end of the given order decision. Therefore, in 
the case of using such an architecture, due to the increase in the area occupied on a 
die within the permissible limits, it will be possible to reduce the timing constraints 
of the system by four times. 
The above-mentioned approaches are aimed at increasing the speed of data 
transfer. They will allow to perform equalization of the signal with a higher 
frequency and reduce the time limitations of data processing. 
Conclusions 
1. The design of means for restoring the distorted signal has become extremely 
relevant at present, because due to the increase in the amount of data processed in 
high-speed systems, in order to meet the demand for increasing the speed of their 
transmission, the speed of reception of sequential information is limited by the 
amplitude-frequency characteristics of the channel. 
2. Experimental studies of the existing means of increasing the speed of receiving 
sequential information and the results of their analysis show that they do not 
completely solve the problems in integrated circuits and have a number of time 
limitations that are unacceptable from the point of view of practical application. 
That circumstance dictates the need to develop more effective means of the 
mentioned class. 
3. Effective approaches from the point of view of time limitations for the develop-
ment of means of increasing the speed of sequential information reception in 
integrated circuits have been proposed. The embedded nodes and the structure of 
their architecture provide an opportunity to signiﬁcantly increase data transfer 
and processing frequencies in the case of increasing the area occupied on the die 
and power consumption within the permissible limits.

Information in an Integrated Circuit 
1.2.1 
Method to Increase the Speed of Receiving Sequential 
Information with the Use of a Circuit with Negative 
Capacitance in Continuous Time Linear Equalizer 
(CTLE) 
The discussions of the means to increase the speed of CTLE and the research on its 
application prove that it has clear limitations and cannot fully meet the modern 
standards of data transfer. Built-in RCM enabled higher-frequency signal equaliza-
tion, reducing the output operating range. 
In order to implement equalization of the transmitted signal with a higher 
frequency, it has been proposed to design and include at the output of the CTLE a 
binary code-controlled negative capacitance circuit (neg-C circuit). The simplest 
neg-C circuit consists of a capacitor and two transistors connected with positive 
feedback (Fig. 1.34) [102]. 
The positive feedback in the system allows to obtain a negative value of the 
complex resistance. The impedance of a neg-C circuit is: 
Zeq = - 1 
sC 
gm þ s Cgate - source þ 2C 
gm - sCgate - source 
,
ð1:20Þ 
where gm is the conductance of the feedback transistor and Cgate-saource is the gate-
source parasitic capacitance of that transistor. 
In order to control the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the neg-C circuit, as  
well as to exclude the inﬂuence of the common mode component of the current on 
the CTLE, it is proposed to apply the following architecture (Fig. 1.35) [103]. 
To make the reference current controllable with a digital code, it is recommended 
to use an 8-bit current DAC (Fig. 1.36). The choice of its range is determined by the 
saturation margin of the current sources in the neg-C circuit.

Fig. 1.36 Architecture of equalization with embedded neg-C circuit 
As the reference current changes, the gm of M1 and M2 transistors increases, 
which leads to ampliﬁcation of the effect of the formed positive feedback and, 
therefore, to the increase in the absolute value of the complex resistance of the 
neg-C circuit. This allows to increase the maximum value of the CTLE gain and the 
bandwidth. 
For a typical case, the amplitude-frequency characteristics of the system and the 
values of the main parameters in the case of all codes of ADC control are presented 
in Fig. 1.37 and Table 1.3. 
The amplitude-frequency characteristics of the system were also measured in the 
slow and fast cases (Figs. 1.38 and 1.39). 
The obtained results show that in the case of a typical corner, the implemented 
neg-C circuit allows to increase the gain of the system to approximately 10 dB for a 
signal with a frequency of 5 GHz. 
In order to get a complete picture of the system, its amplitude-frequency charac-
teristics were also considered in the case of all possible conﬁguration options of 
RCM (Fig. 1.40).

As a result of frequency analysis, measurements show that as a result of a 
complete setup of the system, its RG can be increased up to ~15 dB. There is also 
a possibility to increase its bandwidth up to ~5 GHz. 
The parameters describing the performance of the system were measured in the 
worst corner cases (Table 1.4). 
In order to evaluate the noise immunity of the overall system, noise simulation 
was performed, and in the worst corner case, its mean square value at the CTLE 
output was measured (Fig. 1.41).

Fig. 1.42 Stability characteristics of the system in a typical case 
In order to evaluate the stability of the neg-C circuit, frequency analysis was 
performed (Figs. 1.42 and 1.43). 
However, all the above results were obtained in the case of small signal simula-
tion, so it is necessary to evaluate the linearity of the system. 
The linearity of ampliﬁers is measured with a 1 dB compression point 
(Fig. 1.44) [104]. 
The 1 dB compression point is the input signal amplitude level in the result of 
which the gain is 1 dB less than the nominal value. However, the level of the output 
signal at that point is also important. It must be high enough to include the input 
operating range of the next node. Since the CTLE is followed by a decision feedback 
equalizer (DFE) and operates with an input signal amplitude of up to 150 mV, the 
output signal amplitude should be no less than 150 mV for a 1 dB compression 
point [68]. 
The M1 and M2 transistors included in the neg-C circuit have the same dimen-
sions and provide the same current in the differential branches at the same voltage 
drop. In the presence of a variable component of the input voltage, the voltages 
controlling them change, which allows for faster switching due to positive feedback. 
However, at low values of the voltage, the M1 and M2 transistors appear in cut-off 
mode, and the amount of deviation with respect to the constant component between 
the differential branches is violated. 
It is recommended to connect M3 and M4 transistors parallel to M1 and M2 
transistors, which will be controlled only by the constant component of the input 
signal (Fig. 1.45).

Fig. 1.44 1 dB compression point 
During the simulation, a sinusoidal signal was given to the input of the CTLE, the 
amplitude of which starts to increase over time (Fig. 1.46). 
As it can be seen from the graph of currents of M1 and M2 transistors, they 
increase and decrease unevenly (Fig. 1.47).

Fig. 1.46 Input and output signals of the system 
The presence of M3 and M4 transistors weakens the effect of positive feedback, 
but ensures the stability of the current of differential branches. As a result, the 
currents of the differential branches increase and decrease in the same proportion, 
which ensures the linearity of the entire system. 
1 dB compression point measurements were made before and after using the 
method (Figs. 1.48 and 1.49). 
In order to evaluate the change of the gain of the system, frequency analysis was 
also performed, the results of which are summarized in Table 1.5. 
The linearity of the system also depends on the implemented current DAC. In the 
case of an ideal linear current DAC, each increase in the order of the controlling 
digital code corresponds to an increase in the output current by the corresponding 
amount of LSB – last signiﬁcant bit (LSB) [105]. In general, for an N-bit current 
DAC, the LSB is determined by:

Fig. 1.51 As a result of “Monte Carlo” simulation, the DNL of the current DAC 
CMOS transistors operating in the saturation mode are used as a current source. 
Branch currents are determined by selecting transistor sizes. 
Since the nominal currents of the thermometric branches are eight times larger 
than the size of the LSB, the inaccuracies caused by the technological process in 
them signiﬁcantly reduce the nonlinearity of the system. 
As a result of “Monte Carlo” simulation, the DNL of the current DAC was 
measured (Fig. 1.51). 
The obtained results indicate that there is a possibility to have DNL up to three 
LSB. It is an unacceptable value, because in that case the current sources included in 
the neg-C circuit deviate from the operating mode. It is recommended to reduce the 
currents of the thermometric branches and obtain a negative DNL when switching 
them (Fig. 1.52) [106]. 
The obtained results show that the maximum value of DNL after applying the 
method is less than one LSB (Fig. 1.53). 
Thus, a CTLE setup system providing signal equalization was proposed. The 
proposed system is based on the reference current control of neg-C circuit including 
positive feedback, which is implemented by the current DAC. The ability to adjust 
the system with a digital code provides signal equalization for different channels and 
data transmission frequencies. Neg-C circuit and current DAC linearity setup 
methods are proposed, which ensure the saturation condition of the current source

transistors and, therefore, the increase in the output operating range of the overall 
system. The proposed system provides approximately two times faster signal equal-
ization. When using the proposed method, compared to existing solutions, its power 
consumption increases slightly, approximately 10%.

Method to Increase the Speed of Receiving Sequential 
Information with the Use of a High-Speed Comparator 
with Low Input Capacitance in the Decision Feedback 
Equalizer (DFE) 
The performance of DFE is limited by timing parameters of cells in it [68]: 
tcl2out,c þ tdeltime,mul þ tstime,t < 2 UTI,
ð1:24Þ 
tcl2out,t 
tdeltime,adder 
tstime,c < 1 UTI,
1:25 
where tcl2out,c is the delay from the comparator clock signal to the output, tdeltime,mul 
is the multiplexer delay time, tstime,t is the trigger setup time, tcl2out,t is the delay from 
the trigger clock signal to the output, tdeltime,adder is the adder delay time, tstime,c is the 
trigger setup time, and UTI is the unit time interval. To reduce tcl2out,c, it was 
proposed to use a circuit of a high-speed comparator with low input capacitance 
(Fig. 1.54) [107]. 
In the recovery phase, the np and nn wires connect to the supply voltage through 
the Mr1 and Mr2 transistors and close the M9 and M10 transistors. At the same time, 
M11 and M12 transistors reset the potentials of fp and fn wires. Therefore, a value 
corresponding to the supply voltage is formed at the outputs. This allows reducing 
the dependence of the comparator on the supply voltage at this stage.

Fig. 1.55 Offset voltage in the result of Monte Carlo simulation for a typical case 
In the comparison stage, the M1 and M2 transistors start discharging the np and 
nn wires. The difference in the input signal provides different current values in the 
differential branches. M5, M6, M7, and M8 transistors are used to form the output 
signal. 
The constant current induced by M3 and M4 transistors provides faster switching 
of the output signal. 
Comparator offset was measured in the result of Monte Carlo simulation 
(Figs. 1.55 and 1.56). 
Timing simulations were performed on the existing and proposed comparators 
(Fig. 1.57). 
The obtained results indicate that the delay time of the comparator has decreased 
by about 36%. However, due to the transistors added to it, the total system area on 
the die has increased by approximately 11%. 
Timing simulation of the proposed comparator with changes in technological 
process, temperature, and supply voltage has been carried out (Fig. 1.58). 
A receiver architecture composed of a dual-cascade CTLE and a DFE is proposed 
[104, 105]. Timing simulation of the whole system was performed (Figs. 1.59 and 
1.60). 
In order to evaluate the noise immunity of the system, “Monte Carlo” simulation 
was performed (Figs. 1.61 and 1.62). 
As a result of the implementation of the proposed comparators, the layout of the 
DFE increased by about 8% (Fig. 1.63)  [104, 105].

Thus, an architecture consisting of a two-stage CTLE and a 1-tap DFE providing 
signal equalization was developed. Its operation is based on low-input high-speed 
comparators that operate on odd and even data branches in parallel. The digital value 
of the previous bit determines the amount of inﬂuence of the adder in a given branch, 
as well as the selection of the correct branch. It allows to reduce the ICI caused by the 
channel and perform correct data processing.

The use of the proposed comparators reduced the timing constraints in DFE by 
about 35%. As a result, at the expense of a slight increase in the area occupied on a 
die and an almost 16% increase in power consumption, twice-higher-speed system 
was obtained.

1.2.3 
Method to Increase the Speed of Receiving Sequential 
Information Due to Processing of the Signal 
Transmitted by Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4), 
Conditioned by Parallel Branches 
As discussed in Sect. 1.1, PAM4 signal transmission enables to increase the amount 
of received data by two times at the same frequency. It is recommended to apply four 
identical branches in parallel after the CTLE in the receiver, in which the value of the 
signal will be captured by means of sample-hold (S/H) blocks (Fig. 1.64). 
Instead of the previously considered three-state comparator, a system consisting 
of three comparators was used, the negative inputs of which are provided with 
reference voltages [108]. The outputs of the system are transformed into a binary 
code by means of a decoder. As a result, sequential signal processing and parallel 
representation transformation are performed. 
In comparators, in order to exclude wrong reading of the signal due to deviations 
of the duty cycle of clock signal, it was adjusted using duty cycle regulator (DCR) 
(Fig. 1.65) [109]. 
Due to the negative feedback in the system, the duty cycle detector (DCD) 
converts the offsets of the output signals from their average value into a control 
voltage, which is applied to the input of the regulator. Due to this, the constant 
voltage components of the input signals are equalized. Then the output signal duty 
cycle is setup. The received incomplete differential signal is converted into a fully 
differential signal by means of the CML-CMOS buffer. 
The constant component of the input voltage in DCR is determined by means of a 
voltage divider consisting of resistors (Fig. 1.66). The input capacitance provides 
ﬁltering of the constant component of the signal.

Fig. 1.65 Architecture of implemented DCR 
Fig. 1.66 DCR architecture 
A special self-adjustment method (Fig. 1.67) [110] was introduced in order to 
setup the deviation of rise/fall of the output signals of the CML-CMOS buffers due 
to process deviations. 
DCD is a dual-cascade differential ampliﬁer system (Fig. 1.68). 
In order to evaluate the speed and accuracy of the system, timing simulation was 
performed (Figs. 1.69 and 1.70). 
After DCR setup, the duty cycle error of the clock signal is less than 0.05% 
(Fig. 1.71). 
In order to evaluate the noise immunity of the system, frequency analysis was 
performed (Figs. 1.72 and 1.73). 
Timing simulation of the entire system was performed (Figs. 1.74 and 1.75). 
The complete results of the system are summarized in tabular form (Table 1.6).

results 
Thus, a receiver architecture providing equalization and processing of the signal 
transmitted by PAM4 was developed. Including four identical and parallel operating 
branches, it allows to perform signal modiﬁcation and present it in a binary code 
more quickly. Correction of duty cycle of the clock signal for the control of 
comparators has been made to eliminate the erroneous reading of the distorted signal 
due to it. In the DCR output buffers, a self-adjusting system for correcting signal rise/ 
falls has been implemented. High-speed comparators with low input capacitance 
were also used for signal processing. 
The application of the proposed multi-branch architecture, compared to the 
previous method, made it possible to increase the speed of data transfer by about 
50%. The area of the receiver on a die increased by only ~12.2%.

Conclusions 
1. Effective approaches from the point of view of time limitations for the develop-
ment of means to increase the speed of sequential information reception in 
integrated circuits have been proposed. The embedded nodes and architecture 
structure underlying them provide an opportunity to signiﬁcantly increase data 
transfer and processing frequencies in the event of an increase in the area 
occupied on the die and power consumption within the permissible limits.

2. A binary code-controlled neg-C implemented system in the continuous time 
linear equalizer (CTLE) was proposed, which, due to positive feedback and 
linearity setup, provides approximately two times faster signal equalization at 
the expense of only 11% increase in the area occupied on the semiconductor 
crystal. 
3. A method to increase the speed of decision feedback equalizer (DFE) was 
proposed, which, due to the introduction of high-speed comparators with low 
input capacitance, increases the frequency of data processing by about two times, 
with only a 16% increase in power consumption. 
4. A method of constructing a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) transmitted 
signal processing system has been developed, which, due to data storage and 
parallel branch processing, increases the data transfer rate by approximately 50% 
with an approximately 12.2% increase in the area of the receiver on a semicon-
ductor crystal.

Need for Design Methods of Integrated Circuits, 
Working Under Non-standard Operating Conditions 
It is known that over the past 60 years, the semiconductor industry has evolved 
according to Moore’s Law [1], which has allowed to have metal-oxide-semiconduc-
tor (MOS) transistors with channel lengths up to 3 nm [2]. All this has led to an 
increase in the productivity of ICs, because the small size of transistors allows to 
have more functional blocks on the same area. Along with all this, the operating 
frequencies of ICs have also increased, reaching tens of GHz [3–5]. Such data 
transfer speeds have allowed the development and improvement of such technolog-
ical directions and industries as automotive electronics [6], Internet of Things [7], 
artiﬁcial intelligence [8], and virtual reality devices [8]. This ensures continuous data 
transfer without human-human or human-computer interaction [9]. During the 
simulation stage, there is a need to observe the phenomena of voltage and temper-
ature drift [10], because during the operation of ICs, drastic changes in external 
conditions are possible even after the calibration stage [11]. Such improvements, as 
well as the greater involvement of high-speed devices in human life, have led to the 
tightening of requirements for IC reliability and the need to develop means of 
designing ICs that work in non-standard operating conditions. Disruption of IC 
operation can directly or indirectly lead to serious economic losses, environmental 
damage, or threats to human life. 
The reduction in sizes led to thinning of the oxide layer of transistor gates, which 
allowed to reduce their threshold voltage [11, 12]. The low threshold voltage, in turn, 
allowed to reduce the supply voltages of ICs, leading to the reduction of power 
consumption [13–16]. The development of the technological process has made it

possible to reduce the distance between metal layers, leading to an increase in the 
density of interconnects [17, 18]. In the case of closer wires, the potential connec-
tions between them increase [19]. Large capacitances lead to an increase in the noise 
level (Fig. 2.1) [20–23]. In modern circuits, the value of the supply voltage has 
become several hundred millivolts, and noises reach tens of millivolts [24–26].

Fig. 2.1 Capacitance between the lines 
An increase in noise and a decrease in the value of the supply voltage led to a 
decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio. This reduces the noise immunity of modern ICs 
[27, 28] and can lead to undesirable changes in the voltage characteristics of circuits, 
up to functional failure. 
The increase in operating frequencies, the density of transistors and interconnects 
per unit area, and the reduction of the thickness of the oxide layer have made the 
inﬂuence of the undesirable phenomena of self-heating [29] and aging [30] on the 
operation of ICs more tangible. Under the inﬂuence of self-heating and electric ﬁeld, 
the charge carriers can acquire such kinetic energy that will allow them to appear in 
the oxide layer of the gate, being absorbed in it. This process is known as the 
phenomenon of hot carriers injection (HCI) [31], the effect of which is great during 
switching of transistors (Fig. 2.2) [32]. The phenomenon of bias temperature insta-
bility (BTI) occurs when a constant voltage is applied to the terminals of the 
transistor (Fig. 2.2) [32]. 
A high potential difference between the gate and the rest of the terminals causes 
damage to the oxide layer, which is recoverable over time. The continuity of BTI and 
HCI phenomena leads to a change in the properties of the oxide layer of transistors 
and its parameters, as well as a decrease in the lifetime of ICs [33–35]. Modern 
standards require ICs to meet a minimum 10-year life span limitation, which further 
increases the role of aging phenomena. Factory-provided transistor aging models are 
used to assess the effect of BTI and HCI phenomena on circuit performance. As a 
result of the simulation, changes in the threshold voltage and current value of 
transistors in the saturation region are observed [36, 37]. Taking into account the 
ﬁelds of application of current ICs, as well as the operating temperature of automo-
tive electronics standards up to 150 °С and a larger range of offset value [38–41], the 
mentioned phenomena can play a decisive role from the point of view of IC 
functionality.

Fig. 2.2 Occurrence of HCI, BTI, self-heating phenomena during the operation of the transistor 
Along with the reduction of the supply voltages, the amplitudes of the signals 
applied to the inputs of the comparators also decreased [42]. Systems with a small 
amplitude compared to the constant component of the voltage require operational 
ampliﬁers (OpAmp) with high sensitivity and gain. The sensitivity is characterized 
by the minimum difference between inputs required for switching. Ideally, for any 
voltage difference between the inputs greater than 0, the output of the comparator 
should be switched. The minimum voltage difference between the inputs, at which 
switching occurs at the output of the comparator, is called the offset voltage 
(Fig. 2.3) [43, 44]. 
The main causes of offset are errors in technological process, asymmetry of 
layout, and aging phenomena [45–47]. 
In modern ICs, the value of offset reaches tens of millivolts, which is a challenge 
for design companies. The circuit of the ampliﬁer with a folded cascode belongs to 
the series of well-known structures providing a high value of gain in comparators 
[48] (Fig. 2.4).

Fig. 2.4 View of the OpAmp with folded cascode 
The simulation results show the presence of offset voltage up to 35 mV due to 
aging of the OpAmp in the off state in the case of different scenarios of input signals 
(Table 2.1). 
It follows from the above that the increase in operating frequencies and noises and 
the development of the technological process have led to a number of complications 
in IC design process. Taking into account the greater involvement of ICs in human 
life every year, the possibility of drastic changes in operating conditions, and the 
strict technical requirements for ICs, the development of ICs operating in 
non-standard conditions becomes a challenge. There is a need to develop new 
methods of designing ICs that operate under non-standard conditions, which will 
reduce the effect of offset of input signals in comparators, self-heating, and aging 
phenomena on the operation of circuits, increasing the noise immunity and efﬁ-
ciency of digital and analog cells.

Existing Design Methods of Integrated Circuits, 
Working Under Non-standard Operating Conditions 
In order to solve the problems mentioned in the previous sub-chapter, new methods 
and means have been developed in recent years, the use of which contributes to 
increasing the stability and uninterrupted operation of ICs. It was possible to achieve 
all this by introducing digital subsystems that ensure self-regulation of circuits. The 
use of digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters allows to introduce calibra-
tion algorithms [49], which, taking into account the operating conditions of the 
blocks, can ensure the optimal values of resistances, current, voltage, and other 
parameters at individual nodes of circuits by changing the code. Similar algorithms 
make it possible to achieve the minimum change of gain, delay, signal jitter, and 
other important parameters of the circuit. Among the mentioned solutions are the 
methods of reducing the offset with digital control [50] and automatic reset in 
comparators [51] in IC receivers, as well as the method of continuous data reception 
through digital delay lines [52–55]. 
The Method of Reducing Offset in Comparators 
It is known that offset is one of the important factors limiting the accuracy of 
comparators and OpAmps [56]. Used primarily in analog circuits, these elements 
are one of their most sensitive components. One of the complications in the design of 
comparators is the provision of saturation and high gain of circuit transistors and 
symmetry of layout [57]. These three factors have quite a large inﬂuence on the value 
of the offset. An unbalanced layout can cause differences in resistance and capac-
itance values between comparator branches, leading to an increase in offset [58–60]. 
The two-cascade comparators used in current ICs are able to provide a low offset 
value, having a low supply voltage value and high noise immunity [56]. A small 
value of offset voltage can be achieved for two reasons: 
1. The offset of the ﬁrst cascade (Fig. 2.5) [56] is canceled by the input offset storage 
circuit. 
2. The offset of the second cascade (Fig. 2.6) [56] is reduced due to the high gain of 
the ﬁrst cascade. 
The ﬁrst cascade is a dynamic ampliﬁer that ampliﬁes the difference of the input 
signals by discharging the differential junction [56].

64

Design Methods of Integrated Circuits, Working Under Non-standard. . .
Fig. 2.5 The ﬁrst cascade of the comparator 
Fig. 2.6 The second 
cascade of the comparator 
The second cascade represents another dynamic ampliﬁer connected to the 
switch [56]. 
The outputs of the ﬁrst cascade feed the second cascade, which, due to the 
positive feedback of the ﬂip-ﬂop, generates a logic zero or one at the output. The 
input offset storage circuit consists of sw and rst control signals and C+/C- capac-
itances. M7 transistor functions both as a switch and as a current source to increase 
the gain of the second cascade. The principle of operation of the comparator 
(Fig. 2.7) [56] is divided into two parts: reset and comparison. The offset voltage 
cancellation is done in the ﬁrst stage. 
Four control signals (rst, clk1, clk2, sw) are used to ensure the operation of the 
comparator at different stages. The clk2 signal is responsible for the comparison 
stage, and the other three are responsible for canceling the offset. First, the input

switches are connected through the rst signal. The In+ and In- points are connected 
to the O+ and O- points, respectively, and are charged up to the VDD value of the 
supply voltage (Fig. 2.8a) [56]. The clk1 signal turns on the M6 transistor, 
discharging С+/C- potentials (Fig. 2.8b) [56]. As the input M0 and M1 transistors 
pass into the subthreshold range, the I+/I- currents decrease sharply. The rst signal is 
turned off, and the offset is stored in С+/C- capacitors (Fig. 2.9a) [56].

Fig. 2.8 A simpliﬁed view of the operation of the comparator in the reset phase 
O+ and O- points are connected to VDD; at the same time the sw signal is turned 
off to register input signals (Fig. 2.9b) [56]. A comparison of input signals is made 
through the discharge of O+ and O- points (Fig. 2.9c) [56]. 
Then, the O+ and O- points, connected to the inputs of the second cascade, form 
the outputs of the general system (Fig. 2.10)  [56]. The main reason for the offset of 
the ﬁrst cascade is the asymmetry of M1 and M2 transistors. It is canceled during the 
reset phase. During the discharge process, the gate and output of input transistors are 
connected together. Therefore, under the inﬂuence of the current ﬂowing through

them, the voltage applied to the gate will increase, which in turn will cause it to 
shrink. Due to such negative feedback, the current values of the input transistors will 
get closer to each other.

After the input transistors pass into the subthreshold range, the difference in these 
currents is less than 1 nA. After the rst signal is turned off, the value of the current for 
the input transistors has the following dependence on the gate-source voltage (2.1) 
[56]: 
Ids = 2nβU2 
⊺e 
VG - Vth

ð2:1Þ 
where Ids is the value of the current ﬂowing through the input transistors, n is the 
slope coefﬁcient of the current graph in the subthreshold range, Vgs is the gate-source 
voltage, Vth is the threshold voltage of the transistor, and UT (2.2) and β (2.3) are the 
current and thermal voltage coefﬁcients, respectively; 
β = μCox W 
L
ð2:2Þ 
UT = kT

ð2:3Þ 
where μn is the charge carrier mobility, Cox is the capacitance per unit area of the 
transistor gate insulator, W and L are the width and length of the transistor channel, 
k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature [56, 61]. After the 
reset phase, the voltage stored in С+/C- potentials is determined by the expression 
given in (2.4) [57]: 
Vg  Vth þ nUT ln 
Ids

ð2:4Þ 
From Eq. (2.4), it follows that asymmetries arising from β and Vth are also stored 
and canceled before the comparison stage. 
The Method of Offset Reduction Using a Digital Control Circuit 
in Receivers of Integrated Circuits 
Advances in IC manufacturing, as well as innovative engineering solutions, have 
made it possible to have data transmission systems reaching tens of GHz 
[62, 63]. Such systems require efﬁcient communication between multiple ICs for 
accurate operation of the entire system. For this, high-speed transmitter-channel-
receiver (TCR) (Fig. 2.11)  [63] systems of data transfer were developed. At the 
transmitter node, the parallel-to-serial data conversion (PSC) circuit converts the 
incoming parallel data to serial data for transmission over the channel. At the output 
of the receiver, the data is parallelized by means of a serial-to-parallel conversion

(SPC) circuit. In the ideal case, the channel represents a short circuit between 
transmitters and receivers [63].

The non-ideality of channel parameters—low bandwidth [64] and noises [65]— 
affect the accuracy of data reception at the input of the receiver. As it is well known, 
the transmission characteristic of the channel has a low-frequency character [66], 
which leads to distortions of the transmitted data depending on their frequency. To 
solve the mentioned problems, data equalizers [67–72] are used in both transmitters 
and receivers, which have opposite characteristics to the channel in order to neu-
tralize its losses. The equalizer used at the input of the receiver (Fig. 2.12)  [67]

consists of a differential pair, the two branches of which are connected to each other 
by resistors and capacitors. The feature of the circuit is that depending on the 
frequency of the input data, the gain takes different values. At low frequencies, the 
behavior of the circuit is similar to that of a source-degraded ampliﬁer, and at high 
frequencies, a common-source ampliﬁer.

where s is a complex variable and gm is the conductance of the transistor. 
From the amplitude-frequency characteristic of the system obtained as a result of 
the simulation, it is clear that the circuit weakens the low and strengthens the high 
frequencies (Fig. 2.13). Thus, the system, having a characteristic opposite to the 
channel, is able to provide equalized data at the input of the receiver. In order to 
reduce the level of signals to logic zero and one, one or more cascade ampliﬁers are 
used after the equalizer [73, 74]. 
To estimate the degree of signal distortion, the eye diagram is used. It is obtained 
by cutting the data signal according to the clock signal and superimposing these parts 
on each other (Fig. 2.14) [75]. 
The distorted data signal causes the eye diagram to close. A small gap in the 
diagram leads to a smaller storage of signal timing parameters: jitter, duration, and 
amplitude of rise/falls.

Fig. 2.14 Obtaining an eye diagram 
The presence of an offset between the output signals of a node can lead to 
incorrect switching or loss of bits. The value of the offset voltage can be determined 
by calculating the difference between the outputs of the circuit when the input 
signals are equal. In modern ICs, analog-digital self-regulating blocks are used to 
reduce the offset between the outputs of the equalizer [76, 77]. Their purpose is to 
provide a minimum voltage difference between the outputs by changing the code for 
an input single-ended signal. The most well-known method consists of a DAC and a 
differential pair, which, by connecting to the outputs of the equalizer, reduces the 
offset due to the insertion of additional current (Fig. 2.15). 
DAC represents resistors connected in series and MOS switches controllable by 
code (Fig. 2.16). The latter, depending on the digital code and the reference voltage 
value [78, 79], output the analog voltage caused by the connection of resistors. By 
increasing the bit-rate of the DAC, it is possible to increase the accuracy of the 
system at the expense of reducing the step of the analog voltage [79]. The resulting 
analog voltage is supplied to M1 and M2 transistors (Fig. 2.15), whose connected 
current source can either match the temperature-independent current supplied to 
DAC or differ from it by being connected to a circuit with a constant conductivity to 
keep the gain stable during the operation. 
The calibration algorithm works in the following sequence: at the beginning point 
b) (Fig. 2.18), being connected to the point providing the smallest voltage of DAC, is 
kept constant. The code changes from maximum to minimum and vice versa 
(Fig. 2.18). During that time, the voltage of point a) starts to decrease from the 
high voltage value of DAC in a minimal step, equaling to point b) (Fig. 2.17).

In the next stage, with the same logic, the voltage of point b) increases and 
decreases from the beginning, keeping the voltage of point a) constant. At the end, 
the voltage of point a) increases, keeping point b) ﬁxed (Fig. 2.18). 
During calibration, the inputs of the node are connected to each other so that it is 
possible to measure the offset. The required code value is selected during output 
switching. After that, the calibration is considered complete, and sequential data can 
be accepted.

A Method of Continuously Receiving Sequential Data Using Digital Delay 
Lines 
One of the most important parameters of modern ICs is performance [80]. Taking the 
current operating frequencies into account, the requirement to have a clock signal 
with a stable frequency inside ICs increases [81]. Increasing operating frequencies

has led to shorter signal periods, which means that the negative impact of signal jitter 
and drift during data transmission has increased. In modern systems, as a generator 
of a constant clock signal, the PLL is used (Fig. 2.19). It is a self-calibrating system, 
the output frequency of which is a multiple of the input frequency. Powered by a 
clock generator, the frequency of which is several tens of megahertz, PLL allows to 
have a clock signal reaching tens of GHz in ICs. The phase-frequency detector 
(PFD) included in its structure is intended for matching the phases of input and 
output signals. By registering the phase difference, it generates output voltages that 
control the charge pump (CP). Depending on the output voltage of the CP, the 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) changes the frequency of the output signal. The 
ratio of the frequencies of the input and output signals is determined by means of a 
frequency divider (FD) (Fig. 2.19). 
2.1

73
Fig. 2.19 A simpliﬁed block diagram of a PLL 
Such a structure of the clock signal generator occupies a large area and does not 
allow to use it in different parts of ICs [82]. The clock signal is transmitted to other 
parts of the IC by buffering (Fig. 2.20) [83]. 
The main purpose of buffering is to restore the signal from distortion. Connec-
tions, having their own parasitic resistances and making capacitive connections with 
neighboring wires, slow down the signal rise/falls, affect the duty cycle, and can 
cause jitter and signal delay [84] (Fig. 2.21). This interferes with the parallel 
operation of different parts of ICs. 
Elements used for signal buffering contain simplest inverters in their structure 
[85]. Depending on the conditions of the external environment, the timing charac-
teristics of inverters can be changed, because they affect the operation of transistors. 
Temperature ﬂuctuations lead to a change in the threshold voltage of transistors, 
which affects the value of the charge and discharge current of the output load of 
inverters. Fluctuations in the supply voltage, affecting the value of the gate-source 
voltage, also lead to a change in timing parameters of inverters. 
In order to solve the mentioned problems in modern ICs, programmable digital 
delay lines (DDL) are used (Fig. 2.22)  [86, 87]. Consisting of sequentially connected

delay buffers, the circuit allows code to control the overall line delay by enabling or 
disabling the appropriate number of elements.

Similar circuits are also used for uninterrupted reception of sequential data. It is 
possible to control the clock signal using DDLs. Depending on the external condi-
tions, the calibration algorithm selects the appropriate code, placing the rise/fall of 
the clock signal in the middle of the data signal, for the most accurate sampling. 
Thanks to shifting of the clock signal, it is possible to sample the data with both rise 
and fall (Fig. 2.23). The most important parameters of DDLs are the total delay 
interval of the line and the system step per code unit change. 
Table 2.2 shows the simulation results for the main DDL parameters.

The maximum step bias from the standard value is 0.03 MM, which is 1.5% of the

which does not exceed 12% of the period.

Existing Problems of Design Methods of Integrated 
Circuits, Working Under Non-standard Operating 
Conditions 
Existing means to design ICs that operate in non-standard operating conditions 
improve the accuracy of circuits, providing a certain stability against external 
factors. However, the development of the technological process, the reduction of 
signal-to-noise ratio, the increase in the effect of aging phenomena, as well as the 
sharp change of external conditions during IC operation give rise to challenges and 
difﬁculties, which are impossible to solve with existing methods in some cases. 
Below are the shortcomings and problems of the existing means of designing ICs 
that operate in non-standard conditions. 
Existing Problems of Offset Reduction Method in Comparators 
The main difﬁculty in using the offset reduction method in comparators is ensuring 
the symmetry of the switched used. It is necessary that the clock signals used for 
switching have a 50% duty cycle (Fig. 2.24); otherwise, it will lead to a difference in 
the times when the switches are on and off. Such a deviation of the clock signal can 
lead to incomplete discharge or charging of capacitors, which will mean there is a

ð
residual offset at the input of the comparator. In case of mismatch of several clock 
signals used in the system, the accuracy of the method decreases. 
2.1

77
Fig. 2.25 In the ideal case, 
the dissipation of the 
accumulated charge in the 
channel 
Taking into account the operation of circuits in non-standard operating conditions 
and sharp changes in temperature and voltage, ensuring such a value of duty cycle is 
a great challenge and requires a lot of effort for designers [88]. 
In addition to the mentioned drawback, there is another problem, which is due to 
the dissipation of the accumulated charge in the transistor channel when the switches 
are off. Since MOS transistors are used as a switch, the value of charge, diffused to 
the source and drain of the transistor when they are off, will depend on the resistance 
values of these pieces. If the resistances are equal, the accumulated charge will be 
divided and dispersed in two pieces. Taking into account the non-idealities of the 
technological process, it is not possible to ensure the uniform dispersion of the 
charge. The charge diffused into the potential will cause a change in the actual offset 
of the system stored in it (Fig. 2.25). 
The amount of charge accumulated in the channel can be controlled by changing 
the physical dimensions of the transistor (2.6). Reducing the length and width of the 
gate will reduce its capacitance and reduce the amount of accumulated charge. 
Qr = CoxWLVG‐Vth
ð
Þ
2:6Þ 
From the expression (2.7) it follows that it is not possible to reset the amount of 
accumulated charge to zero. On the other hand, reducing the size of the transistor 
will reduce the current passing through it and increase the charging and discharging 
times of the capacitor. This can cause the system to slow down. There are methods 
for reducing the residual offset caused by switch asymmetry, but their implementa-
tion requires increasing the circuit area and adding additional clock signals, while 
not completely solving the offset problem. Using capacitors in input cascade leads to 
an increase in the size of layout and can affect comparator bandwidth. 
Considering the above-mentioned shortcomings, there is a need to develop new 
methods that will reduce the offset in the comparators without increasing the size of 
the circuit and having a negative impact on the stability of the system.

The Existing Problems in Offset Cancellation Method Based on Digital 
Calibration Circuit, for Input Stage of a Receiver 
The main purpose of the receiver is to restore the distorted data signal after the 
channel. After eliminating the unwanted effect of the channel, only the signal is 
transmitted to the remaining blocks of the receiver. The presence of offset in the 
equalizer can lead to incorrect processing of the received signal, resulting in possible 
data loss. The operation of modern systems in non-standard conditions implies 
drastic temperature changes. The temperature dependence of transistor parameters 
can affect their state. Transition of the transistors from saturation mode to triode or 
off mode will cause the entire system to fail. 
The simulation results show that in the method of offset reduction through the 
digital control circuit in IC receivers, the offset change as a result of temperature drift 
reaches up to 27 mV (Fig. 2.26d) (Table 2.3).

Fig. 2.27 Circuit, 
describing the operation of 
the system 
As mentioned above, the circuit can be powered by both temperature-independent 
and constant-conductance reference current sources. In the ﬁrst case, the maximum 
offset of the system after calibration is 4 mV (Fig. 2.26a). In the second case, the 
maximum offset value is 2.2 mV (Fig. 2.26b). 
In the ﬁrst case, the offset change as a result of temperature drift is less than 
10 mV (Fig. 2.26c), but in this case the system gain also depends on temperature. 
The problem is that in the case of temperature-independent power supply and low 
calibration code, the circuit works as a differential ampliﬁer (Fig. 2.27). Since the 
gain of the ampliﬁer depends on the temperature, during the temperature drift there is 
a deviation of the state of the system from the calibrated state, therefore, also an 
offset change. In the case of high codes, only one of the M1 and M2 transistors 
works. Current ﬂows through one branch. Since it is independent of temperature, the 
offset change of the system is less. But even then, the change in the state of the 
transistors causes the offset to increase. 
When fed from a constant-conductance circuit, the offset change is larger for 
higher codes. Since the current ﬂows through only one branch and has a strong 
dependence on the temperature, the offset value also changes when the latter 
ﬂuctuates. At low codes, the differential pair works, and since it is fed from a 
constant-conductance circuit, the system conductance, and thus the gain, remains 
constant. In this case, the offset change is less. M1 and M2 transistors also cause a 
change in offset, because as a result of a change in temperature, there is a change in 
their threshold voltage and current in the saturation region. 
The above described phenomena reduce the sensitivity of the system, reducing 
the efﬁciency of the calibration. Taking into account the shortcomings of the 
method, there is a need to develop new calibration mechanisms that will increase 
the quality characteristics of current ICs and ensure the minimum change of the 
offset value during the temperature drift.

Existing Problems in the Method of Continuous Reception of Sequential 
Data Using Digital Delay Lines 
As it is known, as the temperature increases, the threshold voltage of the transistor 
decreases, which leads to an increase in the current in the saturation region (2.7).

where ΔL is the amount of channel shortening due to modulation. 
An increase in the value of the supply voltage also leads to an increase in the 
current of the transistor in the saturation region, because the difference in the gate-
source potentials increases (2.7). The speed of charging and discharging of the 
output load of the inverters and the input-output delay are directly related to the 
value of the current. In the case of small currents, the delay value is higher and vice 
versa. Therefore, varying the supply voltage and temperature individually or simul-
taneously can affect the total line delay value. Deviation of the signal by more than 
one unit range (UR) can result in missampling of the data signal. To check the effect 
of the above-mentioned phenomena on the operation of the circuit, after the DDL 
calibration phase, changes in temperature and supply voltage value were made. The 
temperature change was made gradually: ±25 °C, ±50 °C, and ±100 °C compared to 
the standard value of 25 °C. The value of the supply voltage has changed ±30 mV 
compared to the value of 800 mV. Simulation results show a small change in the 
DDL step, at most 0,016 MM. Since all the inverters are affected in the same way by 
changes in external conditions, the step change between them is small. The total 
DDL delay, which is the sum of the delays of all inverters, has undergone a larger 
change. The maximum change is 0.61 MM. The difference between the maximum 
and minimum delays of the line increased from 0.44 MM to 1.08 MM, which is more 
than half of the signal period (Table 2.4). 
Considering the increase in the frequency value in ICs, which has led to the 
reduction of the period of signals, similar changes in the line modulation can lead to 
an error in the reception of successive data. 
The above changes caused by external conditions have a negative effect on the 
total delay cost of DDLs. Delay changes reduce the accuracy of calibration algorithm 
when operating the circuit under non-standard conditions. Taking all this into 
account, there is a need to develop new methods and measures for calibrating the 
DDL delay value, which will ensure the stability of the main parameters of the DDL 
after calibration, depending on the changes in external conditions. This will allow 
uninterrupted reception of sequential data in the case of circuit operation under 
non-standard conditions.

Principles of Increasing the Stability of Integrated 
Circuits, Working Under Non-standard Operating 
Conditions 
Taking into account the requirements for ICs, working in non-standard operating 
conditions and the unacceptable deviations caused by changes in temperature and 
supply voltage in existing methods due to aging of transistors and changes in 
threshold voltage, there is a need to develop new solutions and methods aimed at 
increasing the stability and efﬁciency of circuits. The following principles are 
suggested: 
2.2 
Reduction of Offset Value Caused by aging Phenomena 
Through Adding Transmission Gates and Transistor 
Switches in Comparators 
Simulation results for one of the well-known structures of the described OpAmp 
showed that it has an input offset of up to 35 mV as a result of aging in the off state. 
The described method successfully reduced the offset value, but its implementation 
required a signiﬁcant increase in area due to the addition of a second comparator 
cascade, the need for several clock signals for which a 50% duty cycle had to be 
provided, and capacitors that caused the circuit stability issues. It is recommended to 
keep the inputs of the circuit closed and ensure the minimum potential difference 
between the terminals of the remaining transistors due to the addition of transmission

gates and MOS switches in the structure of the OpAmp, due to the minimum 
increase in area, because, as mentioned, in this case, the effect of aging phenomena 
is less.

2.3 
Incorporation of the Current DAC in the Method 
of Offset Reduction Through the Circuit with Digital 
Control of IC Receiver 
Taking the offset increase into account caused by the change in the parameters of the 
transistors feeding the outputs of the equalizer in the described method, it is 
recommended to eliminate them and use a current DAC instead of the DAC 
consisting of a circuit and resistors. Such a change, due to the reduction of the 
area occupied on a semiconductor crystal and the minimal increase in power 
consumption, allows the outputs of the circuit to be fed directly from the current 
DAC, the transistors of which have a greater saturation reserve and are stable during 
temperature changes. 
2.4 
Implementation of Negative Feedback in DDLs 
Due to implementation of negative feedback, it is proposed to minimize the changes 
in the delays of the inverters used in the DDL circuit. One of the delay elements is 
used as a sensor in the new circuit to sense changes in external conditions. Its input 
voltages, which are also connected to DDL, are controlled by injecting additional 
current through feedback operation. The change in the threshold voltage of transis-
tors, at the expense of neutralizing them with the voltage applied to the gate, 
minimizes the delay deviations (Fig. 2.28). 
2.4.1 
Conclusions 
1. As a result of changes in external factors, the deviation of transistor parameters 
and the increase in the effect of aging phenomena have led to a decrease in the 
efﬁciency of the calibration nodes and equalizers included in integrated circuits, 
which can even lead to functional failures. Therefore, the development of design 
methods for integrated circuits that will work under non-standard operating 
conditions has become an extremely important challenge. 
2. The existing means of designing integrated circuits working in non-standard 
operating conditions are based on calibration algorithms and are oriented to 
technological processes of larger sizes. In addition, the possibility of sudden

changes in temperature and voltage after calibration and the increased inﬂuence 
of aging phenomena typical of modern technologies are not taken into account. 
This indicates that the latter do not meet modern requirements, and the need to 
develop new solutions for increasing the stability and reliability of integrated 
circuits has arisen. 
3. Approaches of IC design that work in non-standard operating conditions have 
been proposed, which will meet modern requirements and, at the expense of 
increasing the occupied area and power consumption within the permissible 
limits, will signiﬁcantly reduce the deviations caused by changes in external 
conditions and aging phenomena. 
2.5 
Design Methods of Integrated Circuits, Working Under 
Non-standard Operating Conditions 
The problems described in Sect. 2.1 witness about the shortcomings in IC design 
methods working under non-standard operating conditions. The increase in the 
involvement of ICs and the impact of aging phenomena in them and the sharp 
changes in voltage and temperature during the operation of devices have led to 
tightening the requirements towards IC reliability. Designers are forced to solve the 
problems that are present in the existing means or to develop methods to increase IC 
stability. Below are the proposed means of designing ICs, working under non-

standard operating conditions, which solve the existing shortcomings in the existing 
methods, meeting the contemporary requirements.

2.5.1 
Method of Reducing Offset, Caused by Aging 
Phenomena in Comparators 
As mentioned above, one of the common comparator circuits has an offset problem 
caused by aging of the circuit in the off state. The proposed offset reduction method 
required the presence of capacitors, several clock signals, a second ampliﬁer cas-
cade, as well as switches. The problems related to IC stability, the complexity of 
ensuring the 50% duty cycle of the clock signal, and the dissipation of the charge 
when the switches are turned off caused a residual offset in the system. In order to 
avoid these defects, a method of offset reduction caused by aging phenomena in 
comparators was proposed [89]. 
Comparing the parameters of transistors in the on and off state of the comparator 
as a result of aging for 10 years, it becomes clear that the main reason for the 
occurrence of offset is the change in their threshold voltage. The maximum delta 
threshold was observed in the case of input transistors (Table 2.5) [89]. 
The effect of BTI and HCI phenomena on the input transistors is smaller when 
they are closed. Due to the addition of transmission gates TG1 and TG2, it is possible 
to cut off the inputs of the comparator and further control them in the off state of the 
circuit. D1 and D2 transistors have been added to control the inputs of the circuit. If 
they are open, the input transistors are in a closed state (Fig. 2.29) [89]. 
After the changes, the maximum offset of the comparator in the case of different 
input scenarios was 8 mV (Fig. 2.30). 
The change in the threshold voltage of input transistors has decreased, reaching 
131 ms. At the same time, there is still a change in the threshold voltage up to 
191 mV in the circuit (Table 2.6) [89]. 
To reduce the changes in the threshold voltage of the current source M9 and M7 
and M8 transistors, D3, D4, and D5 switches were added (Fig. 2.31) [89]. In the off 
state of the circuit, the D5 switch is open. The source terminals of M1 and M2 
transistors, being connected to the supply voltage, provide a zero potential difference 
with respect to the gate. At the same time, the potential difference between all 
terminals of M9 transistor is zero, which leads to a reduction in the effect of aging 
phenomena. D3 and D4 switches ensure the discharge of outputs of M7 and M8 
transistors to the ground when the circuit is off.

lengths of the channel of the added transistor switches were chosen as small as 
possible. 
Monte Carlo simulation was performed for typical offset and worst cases 
(Figs. 2.33 and 2.34) in order to check the effect of technological deviations on 
the operation of the circuit after modiﬁcations.

The maximum offset value for typical and worst cases was 10.1 mV and 
12.64 mV, respectively (Table 2.7). 
A comparison of transistor parameters due to gain, offset, and aging was made 
with the results of the initial circuit under temperature conditions up to 150 °C 
(Table 2.8) [89]. 
Thus, at the expense of the 4.82% increase in the area of the described compar-
ator, the proposed method ensures an 11.6 times reduction of the offset caused by the 
aging of the circuit. The area of the circuit has increased due to the addition of extra 
transistors and transmission gates. The gain of the comparator did not decrease as a 
result of modiﬁcations. The method does not require addition of extra outputs, since 
the transistors and transmission gates are controlled by the signals used to turn off 
the circuit. 
2.5.2 
Method of Reducing the Offset Caused by Sharp 
Fluctuations in Ambient Temperature in the Receiver 
In the described method, the output offset of the receiver increased as a result of 
temperature ﬂuctuations. The threshold voltage of M1 and M2 transistors was

changing. Both cases of choosing the current sources feeding the system had their 
drawbacks. A method is proposed [90] in order to avoid the changes of the offset.

The following changes have been made in the circuit: 
1. To avoid voltage-current-voltage conversions, the pair of M1 and M2 transistors 
was added [90]. 
2. The structure of the DAC consisting of resistors was replaced by the current DAC 
(Fig. 2.7)  [90] (Fig. 2.35).

A similar structure allows to connect current DAC directly to the outputs of the 
equalizer (Fig. 2.36) [90]. 
To simulate the case of getting voltages equal to the gates of M1 and M2 
transistors and to keep the logic of calibration algorithm the same, an always-on 
current DAC was added. In order to ensure the symmetry of the branches in the 
layout, a disconnected DAC was added. In this way, it is possible to avoid the 
occurrence of additional offset in the output of the circuit. A similar structure allows

the use of a temperature-independent reference current source for powering the 
circuit. It reduces the offset dependence on the current during sudden temperature 
changes.

Fig. 2.37 Offset of an equalizer 
In order to check the performance of the proposed method, one of the inputs was 
given an offset of 50 mV, and calibration algorithm was applied (Fig. 2.37) [90]. 
Before starting the calibration phase, the two inputs of the equalizer are brought 
close to each other from values of 50 and 100 mV. In the case of equality of inputs, 
the difference of the output branches will be exactly the offset. During calibration 
(Fig. 2.38)  [90], the inputs of the equalizer are equalized to zero (Fig. 2.39). 
Changing the code leads to an increase in the value of the current given to branches. 
The two points of intersection of the outputs correspond to the minimum offset 
value. In the case of those points, the calibration code is ﬁxed, after which the 
arithmetic mean is subtracted from them. The resulting outcome is considered the 
offset cancellation code corresponding to the given conditions.

After deciding the code, the inputs of the node are brought together again. In this 
case, at the point of their intersection, the output offset already has a signiﬁcantly 
smaller value (Fig. 2.40) [90]. 
As a result of the operation of calibration algorithm, the output offset was in 
decimal mV. The offset change due to the -40 to 150 °C thermal drift of the 
proposed method was 1.42 mV [90]. It was possible to achieve such a small change 
in the offset as a result of the application of the current DAC. The transistors used in 
it have a fairly large supply of saturation. Delta threshold as a result of the change in 
temperature does not cause a change in the state of transistors. In this approach the 
range of offset calibration is more linear, because the voltage is obtained directly on 
resistors of the equalizer (Fig. 2.41)  [90]. 
To evaluate the effect of technological deviations on the proposed method, Monte 
Carlo veriﬁcation was performed at 4.5 sigma range. Before using the method, the

maximum value of offset was 4 mV in the range of ±4.5 sigma (Fig. 2.42) [90]. After 
the changes in the circuit, the maximum offset value in the worst and typical cases 
was 1.2 mV and 0.92 mV, respectively (Table 2.9) (Figs. 2.43 and 2.44) [90]. 
92

Fig. 2.40 Offset value after calibration 
Thus, the replacement of DAC of resistors allowed to reduce the area of the circuit 
by 43.2% at the expense of refusing from transistor-resistor structure (Table 2.10) 
[90]. The current DAC occupies a smaller area, consisting only of MOS transistors. 
The power consumption increased by 7.2% due to the always-on power supply 
branch. 
The obtained results prove that the proposed solution is effective in terms of 
reducing the output offset of the equalizer. Due to the reduction of the area and the 
increase of the power consumption, the method allows to achieve an offset of about 
19 times the reduction in case of sharp changes in temperature.

2.5.3 
Method of Reducing the Offset Caused by Sharp 
Voltage and Temperature Fluctuations in Digital Delay 
Lines 
In the described method, the timing parameters of DDL deviated during temperature 
and voltage ﬂuctuations. This was due to the change in the threshold and gate-source 
voltages of transistors in inverters. 
This led to deviations in the charge and discharge times of output loads, which 
affected the DDL delay. 
To avoid the above problem, a method based on negative feedback is proposed 
[91]. To sense temperature and voltage changes, an additional delay element was 
added to which feedback was applied (Fig. 2.17) [91]. In order to accurately measure 
changes in external conditions on the line, it is recommended to place the additional 
delay element in the physical design as close to the DDL as possible (Fig. 2.45). 
The input and output of the added delay element are connected to the phase 
detector (PD). It represents an XOR circuit and is designed to capture delay deviation

due to changes in external conditions. The PD output is connected to a low-pass ﬁlter 
(LPF), which works as an integrator (Fig. 2.46) [91].

The LPF output is connected to a conductance OpAmp (COpAmp) (Fig. 2.47), 
which compensates for the change in delay by injecting additional current into the 
circuit that generates the delay controlling voltages (DCL) (Fig. 2.48) [91]. 
Depending on the external conditions, the number of appropriate mirrors is 
selected by the code in the COpAmp circuit. Then, depending on the number of 
mirrors, the total COpAmp current used to obtain the output voltages is determined. 
First, Vp and Vn voltages are given to the pMOS of the delay element, then to the 
gates of the nMOS transistors. By changing the gate-source voltage, the current 
ﬂowing through the transistors is controlled. Depending on the value of the current, 
the delay of the circuit changes. The calibration process is considered complete. 
After calibration, the threshold voltage of transistors changes during changes in 
temperature and voltage. This affects the value of the current ﬂowing through the 
mirrors, leading to offset of Vp and Vn. Since the code is already ﬁxed, the number 
of connected mirrors cannot be changed. By injecting additional current at the

Fig. 2.53 In a typical case, the distribution of DDL delay 
To verify the effectiveness of the method, Monte Carlo check was performed in 
the worst and typical cases [91] (Figs. 2.53 and 2.54). 
The delay distribution is linear and satisﬁes the ±4.5 sigma range of technological 
deviations. After the changes made, the operation of the circuit was checked for 
changes in voltage and temperature. Changes in external conditions were applied 
after calibration was completed to verify the operation of negative feedback. The 
maximum range of DDL delay was 0.47 MM at -30 mV deviation of the supply 
voltage (Table 2.12) [91]. 
Thus, due to changes in temperature and supply voltage, the DDL delay range has 
been reduced by 56.04%, from 1.08 MM to 0.47 MM. It was possible to achieve all 
this due to the 23.1% increase in the area occupied on the die, because the negative 
feedback circuit was introduced. The circuit satisﬁes the Monte Carlo technological 
deviation range of ±4.5 sigma. The COpAmp has sufﬁcient PSRR to suppress power 
jitter noises. 
In summary, it can be said that the proposed method is effective in reducing 
deviations in DDLs operating under non-standard conditions.

Conclusions 
1. Approaches of IC design, working in non-standard operating conditions, have 
been proposed, which meet modern requirements and, due to the increase of the 
occupied area and power consumption within the permissible limits, have signif-
icantly reduced the deviations caused by changes in external conditions and aging 
phenomena.

2. A method of reducing the offset caused by aging phenomena in comparators has 
been developed, in which, due to the addition of extra transmission gates and 
digital switches, the operating conditions of transistors in the off state of the 
circuit have been improved, and the offset has decreased by about 11 times, due to 
a maximum increase of 4.8% of the area. 
3. A method of reducing the offset caused by sharp ﬂuctuations in ambient temper-
ature of IC receiver was designed, in which, due to the use of current DAC, it was 
possible to reduce the offset change of the equalizer by a maximum of 19 times, 
with a 43.2% decrease in the area occupied on the die and due to the 7.2% 
increase in power cost. 
4. A method for reducing deviations caused by sharp voltage and temperature 
ﬂuctuations in DDLs was created, in which, due to the introduction of negative 
feedback, it was possible to reduce the delay interval of DDL due to changes in 
external conditions by 56.04%—at the expense of 23.1% growth in area.

Chapter 3 
Signal Transmission Calibration Systems 
in Integrated Circuits 
3.1 
General Issues of Signal Transmission Calibration 
Systems in Integrated Circuits 
3.1.1 
Importance of Signal Transmission Calibration Means 
in Integrated Circuits 
I/O [3] cells are one of the most important components of contemporary ICs [1] 
(Fig. 3.1) [2]. They ensure lossless reading and transmission of data and also process 
the transmitted signal. 
It should be noted that I/O cells can generally work in bidirectional mode, which 
means that the same I/O cell can both read the data and transmit it (Fig. 3.2). 
Currently, there are many types of I/O cells [4], which have different applications, 
as a result of which the power supply voltage of I/O cells and the data transfer rates 
can be different. For example, double data rate (DDR) [5] nodes provide data 
transfer between the computer core and RAM [6]. There is also low-power DDR 
(LPDDR) [7], which is used in devices that require high power efﬁciency, such as 
mobile phones, modern laptops, and tablet computers. Another type of I/O cell is the 
Universal Serial Bus (USB) [8], which is used to transfer data and provide power 
between computers. Currently, high-bandwidth memories (HBM) [9] are also used, 
which provide data transfer between computer core and three-dimensional synchro-
nous dynamic random access memory [10] (3SDRAM). Multimedia special I/O cells 
are also used [11, 12], for example, high-deﬁnition multimedia interface, which 
allows to transmit high-quality video data and audio data (Table 3.1) [13]. 
From Table 3.1 it can be noticed that the new generation I/O cells are faster and 
work with lower supply voltages, which signiﬁcantly complicates the processes of 
data reading and transfer. It should be noted that as a result of reducing the supply 
voltage, ICs become sensitive to external and internal noise [14], and due to the 
increase in speed, the transmission line begins to signiﬁcantly suppress the trans-
mitted data, which makes data processing even more difﬁcult.

Currently, there are also high-precision IC types [15], which provide extremely 
high reliability. They are mainly used in different ﬁelds. Since the loss of data in the 
above areas can lead to great damage, I/O cells in high-precision ICs are equipped 
with systems to increase the reliability of data transmission and reading [16]. 
In ICs, I/O cells are connected via transmission lines [17], which contain capac-
itive and inductive components [18]. They signiﬁcantly suppress the signal ampli-
tude and cause distortions (Fig. 3.3) [19]. 
It should be noted that the wave resistance value of the transmission line is 
usually equal to 50 Ω [20]. 
Due to the suppressive properties of transmission lines and wave reﬂections, it is 
difﬁcult to further increase the speed of ICs [21]. These reﬂections occur when the 
resistances of the transmitter and the receiver are not matched, which signiﬁcantly 
reduces the reliability of the transmitted data, leading to even data loss (Fig. 3.4). 
Depending on the degree of matching of transmitter and receiver resistances, the 
wave reﬂection coefﬁcients will be different. For the general case, this coefﬁcient is 
determined by the following formula [22]:

In modern I/O cells, data transfer rates can reach Gbps (Fig. 3.5) [23], which 
signiﬁcantly complicates data reading. In that case, prevention of transmission line 
distortions becomes an even more important issue. For example, in ﬁfth-generation 
double data rate nodes [24] (DDR5), the data transfer rate is 6.4 Gbps. 
Reading a signal of such view (Fig. 3.6) requires special methods, the use of 
which will neutralize these distortions and allow lossless data reading [25–27].

In summary, the factors that hinder the process of increasing the speed of I/O cells 
and accurate data transmission, which causes a great demand for the development of 
means of regulating the transmission of signals, are:
.
The large set of I/O cells and various operating requirements towards them
.
Negative effect of the transmission line on signal transmission
.
Increasing the performance of I/O cells
.
High reliability of signal processing required for high-precision ICs. 
3.1.2 
Importance of Developing Signal Transmission 
Calibration Means in Integrated Circuits 
In modern ICs, signal transmission calibration systems are mainly composed of I/O 
cells, the sub-nodes of which aim to increase the quality of data transmission and 
reading. The main components of the mentioned I/O cells are the transmitter and the 
receiver (Fig. 3.7) [28]. 
The data transmitted from the core is preprocessed in digital logic (DL) node. The 
latter implements the supply of control signals, determines the operating mode of I/O

cell, as well as forms the signals characterizing the state of system’s supply voltage 
and input signal.

Fig. 3.8 Input and output signals of a level shifter 
Since the transmitted data and the core have different supply voltage values, a 
level shifter is used (Fig. 3.8)  [29]. It should be noted that there is also a high-to-low 
level shifter, used in the receiver.

Fig. 3.9 Control of the speed of rise/fall times of transmitted data 
The data, passing through the input node, is transferred to the output buffer 
(OB) [30], which is connected to the transmission line. The OB contains high-
power buffers connected to each other in parallel, through which data is transmitted 
as lossless as possible. Depending on the operating mode of I/O cell, it may be 
required to provide different values of the output resistance of the transmitter. In that 
case, the DL node forms calibrating signals, as a result of which some of the OB 
nodes are connected or disconnected and change the value of the output resistance. 
Since the OB has a large input capacitance, the transmitted data is pre-ampliﬁed by a 
pre-buffer (PB) [31]. It consists of buffers that are connected to the current support 
system (CSS) [32]. The latter supplies additional current to buffers, as a result of 
which it is possible to control the speeds of rise/fall times of the transmitted data 
(Fig. 3.9), which are also controlled by DL node. 
CSS can provide different values of speed of rise/fall times of the output signal. It 
depends on the type of I/O cell as well as the length of the transmission line. All these 
nodes aim to increase the reliability of the transmitted data as much as possible to 
reduce the impact of the transmission line. The latter has two types of models: for 
lossless and lossy transmission lines. The wave impedance for a lossless line is 
determined by the following formula [33]: 
Z0 = 
L

ð3:4Þ 
and for the line with loss it is determined by the following formula [33]:

where R is the resistance of the transmission line, G is the conductance of the

the transmission line. 
To avoid signal distortion (Fig. 3.10), it is extremely important that the output 
resistance of the transmitter, the wave impedance, and the input resistance of the 
receiver are coordinated [34, 35]. 
Rout = Z0 = Rin,
ð3:6Þ 
However, impedance matching becomes difﬁcult in the case of process-voltage-
temperature (PVT) deviations [36], as a result of which the transmitter’s output and 
receiver’s input impedance values deviate, causing wave reﬂections and causing 
transmitted data error. Fig. 3.11 shows the effect of temperature change on the 
resistance value. 
In order to neutralize the inﬂuence of PVT deviations, termination system 
(TS) [37] is used, which allows to keep the transmitter output and receiver input 
resistance values unchanged. The TS compares the value of the resistance outside the 
IC with high accuracy (±2% accuracy) with the output resistance, which changes 
during the PVT variations [38–40]. If deviations are detected, some of the compo-
nent buffers of the OB are connected on or off in parallel with the OB of the 
transmitter, as a result of which the value of the output resistance of the OB decreases 
or increases. By performing this process, it is possible to reach the target resistance 
value and avoid wave reﬂections as a result of its mismatch (Fig. 3.12). It should be 
noted that the TS is also used to match the input resistance in the receiver. Thus, the 
signal, passing through the transmission line, begins to be read at the data receiver 
(DR) [41], which is composed of high-frequency receivers [42, 43]. Depending on

the type of I/O cells, it may consist of cascades of several receivers. It aims to 
amplify the data at its target frequency and suppress other frequencies as much as 
possible, which will restore the data distorted by the transmission line.

These receivers usually work in reference voltage comparison or differential 
modes. In reference voltage comparison mode, the reference voltage is applied to 
the negative input of the receiver, and the transmitted data is applied to the other 
input. That reference voltage is supplied from a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in 
the receiver [44, 45]. In this mode, the receiver presents a comparator and, in cases of 
values higher than the reference voltage, generates logic “1” at the output, and in 
cases of values lower than the reference voltage, logical “0” signals (Fig. 3.13). It 
should be noted that ideally, the value of the reference voltage should be equal to half

the amplitude of the transmitted data, so that the signal is transmitted to the core as 
evenly as possible.

In the differential mode, signals deviated 180 degrees are applied to the receiver 
inputs (Fig. 3.14)  [46]. In this mode, the receiver is more noise-immune, because 
noises contained in the input data are not transmitted to the output.

Problems of Developing Signal Transmission Calibration Means 
in Integrated Circuits and Their Measurements 
With the increase of data transfer rates, deviations of timing parameters of data 
become an extremely important problem [47]. In modern I/O cells, the fastest data 
change time reaches ps [48]. In that case, even small deviations of timing parameters 
can lead to data error. The most common way of measuring timing parameters of a 
signal is the eye diagram (Fig. 3.15) [49], through which the size of the signal jitter, 
voltage levels, as well as the main timing parameters are observed. The rectangle 
depicted in the diagram is called the eye opening, the horizontal side of which 
corresponds to the time margin of the data, and the vertical side to the voltage 
corresponds to the amplitude of the data. 
Another important timing parameter is the signal duty cycle which is determined 
by the following formula [50]: 
D = T1 
Tp * 100%,
ð3:7Þ 
where D is the duty cycle of signal, T1 the duration of the logical “1” range of the 
signal, and Tp the period of the signal. 
For an ideal case, the signal duty cycle should be equal to 50%. It means that the 
durations of logic “1” and logic “0” of the signal are equal, and the signal has a 
proportionally periodic view. Mainly, duty cycle deviations are caused by the 
asymmetry of rise/falls of the signal [51], which in turn is caused by transmission 
line effects [52] and PVT deviations [53]. 
Another important timing parameter of the data is jitter (Fig. 3.16) [54–57]. It can 
be represented as the sum of signal deviations, reﬂections, data-dependent interfer-
ence [58], noises affecting the data, and delays. It is generally calculated for a given 
unit period. The common jitter consists of two main components: deterministic [59] 
and arbitrary jitters (Fig. 3.17) [60]. 
The occurrence of deterministic jitter is not accidental; it has clear reasons and is 
usually periodic. It means that the jitter can be repeated at one or more frequencies. It 
consists 
of 
two 
subgroups: 
data-dependent 
and 
periodic 
jitters. 
Symbolic

interference [61] is a type of data-dependent jitter observed during data transmission. 
For example, when transmitting sequential data “00001” and “"11101,” their last 
switching jitters may be different. It is caused by reﬂections and frequency losses of 
the transmission line (Fig. 3.18). The latter can be described by the following 
formula [62]:

where y(t) is the signal formed at the receiver input, h(t) is the impulse response of 
the transmission line, Ts is signal period, and χ[n] is the data being sent. 
It can be observed that the response of the transmission line is different for the 
“0001” and “1011” data, so at the data “1011” a distorted signal is formed at the 
input of the receiver. Such distortions can lead to data loss, resulting in system 
crashes. Therefore, it is extremely important to ensure lossless data transfer. 
Thus, one of the most relevant problems in current I/O cells is the development of 
means of signal transmission calibration, which will enable to signiﬁcantly improve 
the reliability of data transmission, as well as to reduce the negative effects of the 
transmission line. 
3.1.3 
Current State and Issues of Design Methods of Signal 
Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated 
Circuits 
The demand for the design of signal transmission calibration systems [63] in ICs is 
conditioned by difﬁculties of data transmission and reading caused by the increase in 
speeds in I/O cells [64].

122
3
Signal Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated Circuits
In addition, modern ICs are more sensitive to PVT deviations [65]. Under these 
conditions, accurate data processing is extremely difﬁcult and can often cause 
system failures, which is a critical issue in high-precision ICs that operate in highly 
sensitive environments and require high data processing accuracy. The development 
of signal transmission calibration means will allow not only to signiﬁcantly increase 
the reliability of data transmitted in the high frequency range, but also to signiﬁcantly 
reduce the design time. 
The increase in the reliability of transmitted data is conditioned by the use of 
signal transmission calibration means [66], due to which it will be possible to 
neutralize the negative effect of the transmission line, and they will be more stable 
to wave reﬂections, and it will also be possible to neutralize signal distortions caused 
by PVT deviations [66–70]. 
The reduction of design time is conditioned by the increase in data reliability as a 
result of the use of signal transmission calibration means [71–74]. Currently, the 
design of I/O cells is a rather long-lasting process, because the design is carried out 
with consideration of all possible deviations, as well as testing I/O cells under the 
conditions of possible PVT deviations [75, 76]. It should be noted that in this case it 
is often not possible to ensure the required performance of I/O cells in all cases. 
Signal Reading Problems Caused by Wave Reﬂections at the Receiver 
As it was mentioned, one of the most important timing parameters of reading signal 
is its duty cycle [77]. In an ideal case, it should be equal to 50%, but due to wave 
reﬂections, noises, and PVT deviation, it can deviate, causing data reading error 
[78]. To solve this problem, wide-range duty cycle calibration system (Fig. 3.19) 
[79] is used in receivers. 
The latter calibrates the deviations of duty cycle by controlling the current of 
NMOS and PMOS transistors connected to the input buffer. These transistors are 
controlled by the control signal Vcontrolling formed at the output of the operational 
ampliﬁer. Depending on the value of this voltage, the current of NMOS and PMOS 
transistors connected to the input buffer increases or decreases, as a result of which it 
is possible to control the duty cycle of the input signal. The indicated control voltage 
Vcontrolling is formed from the difference in the values of the voltages applied to the 
inputs of the differential ampliﬁer. A voltage equal to half of the supply voltage is 
applied to the positive input of the differential ampliﬁer, which corresponds to a 
signal with a duty cycle of 50%, and the output of the RC ﬁlter is connected to the 
other input [80]. The RC ﬁlter integrates the input data, as a result of which the 
resulting voltage value corresponds to the duty cycle of the signal. 
For example, in the result of integrating a signal with an amplitude of 1 V and a 
duty cycle of 50%, 0.5 V is obtained, and a signal with a duty cycle of 60% 
corresponds to 0.6 V. Thus, by applying these two voltages to the inputs of the 
operational ampliﬁer, it is possible to detect the direction of the deviation of duty 
cycle and correct it as a result of current support. However, this method has low 
accuracy, and at high frequencies, it is not possible to ensure accurate calibration of 
duty cycle.

Problems Caused by Data Distortions at the Transmitter Sub-node 
As a result of increase in data transfer rate, the input capacitances of sub-blocks in 
I/O cells begin to signiﬁcantly suppress the transmitted data. A key part of that 
capacitance is the gate-source capacitance of a MOS transistor. In particular, high-
speed data transmission in level shifters (LP) becomes difﬁcult using the classical 
structure. For this reason, high-frequency LPs are used (Fig. 3.20) [81], in which the 
input node is the output of a MOS transistor [82], in order to reduce the effect of its 
gate-source capacitance. 
High-frequency LSs with such a structure are used in almost all modern I/O cells, 
but the disadvantage of this structure is that it distorts the data. As a result of LP 
being the drain of the input transistor, the rise/fall of the transmitted data at the 
interconnection points “A” and “B” are distorted (Fig. 3.21). The distorted data of 
this form is transmitted to the output, as a result of which the signal’s duty cycle is 
violated, as well as large jitter of data occurs [83, 84]. 
These deviations affect the time margin of the transmitted data and in some cases 
even cause data losses. Therefore, it is obvious that such a structure of LS limits the 
further increase of data transfer rate. 
Problems Caused by PVT Deviations in Transmitter Sub-nodes 
Modern I/O cells must provide full performance under various PVT conditions. 
However, PVT deviations cause current, output resistance, and voltage deviations 
[85, 86], which negatively affects the transmitted data and can even cause system

error. For this reason, the current support system (CSS) is used (Fig. 3.22) [87], 
which provides additional current support and corrects the deviated rise/falls of the 
transmitted data. 
124

CSS contains imitation of output buffer that is connected in parallel to the main 
output buffer. It can amplify rise/falls by applying “PMOS ampliﬁcation” and 
“NMOS ampliﬁcation” signals (Fig. 3.23). 
Thus, it is possible to recalculate the deviations of the transmitted data, but the 
disadvantage of this system is that it does not perform rise/fall equalization during 
data transmission, as a result of which IC reliability is signiﬁcantly reduced.

Signal Transmission Calibration Problems Caused by Transmission 
Lines 
The increase in data speeds signiﬁcantly complicates the process of their transmis-
sion. In particular, the transmission line’s property to suppress the signal can cause

data loss, which limits further increases in data transfer rates. For this reason, signal 
equalization methods are used [88–90], which partially neutralize the negative effect 
of the transmission line. In general, the essence of the equalization method is similar 
to the operation of the ﬁnite impulse response ﬁlter; the input signal, passing through 
the delay element, is superimposed on the original input signal. As a result, a new 
type of signal is formed, which is ampliﬁed in high frequency ranges (Fig. 3.24)  [91]. 
126

Signal Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated Circuits
Fig. 3.24 Signal equalization method in transmitters 
In modern I/O cells, the equalization method of signal amplitude modulation 
(SAM) is widely used, which is implemented by means of an “XOR” logic cell. 
Input and clock generated width modulation signals are applied to its inputs, as a 
result of which an already equalized signal is formed (Fig. 3.25) [91]. Moreover, 
depending on the value of duty cycle of the clock SAM, it is possible to reduce the 
inter-symbol interference of the signal. 
Depending on the parameters of the transmission line, it is also possible to choose 
such a value of duty cycle of clock SAM, in the case of which the inter-symbol 
interference of the transmitted signal will be minimal. The value of this duty cycle 
can be calculated using the function of signal period (TS) and channel time constant 
(TC) of the transmission line [91].

The disadvantage of this equalization method is that it is very difﬁcult to 
accurately calculate the duty cycle in different PVT conditions, which leads to the 
error of the transmitted data. It is obvious that these equalization methods are not 
applicable for high-precision ICs, because they do not ensure high reliability of the 
transmitted data.

Fig. 3.25 Working principle of the SAM equalization method 
Thus, the main obstacles of increasing the speed of data transfer in I/O cells and 
its lossless reading are PVT deviations, transmission lines, and inaccuracies caused 
by transmitters. In order to eliminate them, it is necessary to design signal transmis-
sion calibration systems. The research of the existing approaches and means of 
developing their design means shows that they do not meet the modern requirements 
for practical design from the point of view of efﬁciency. 
Design Principles of Signal Transmission Calibration Systems 
in Integrated Circuits 
It follows from the above written that currently used signal transmission calibration 
systems do not take power consumption problems into account, and they do not 
provide the required reliability of data transmission and reading, so they are not 
applicable in high-precision ICs and limit the further increase in the speed of I/O 
cells. 
In particular:
.
The wide-range duty cycle calibration system used in the receiver has low 
accuracy. Its use in case of high signal frequencies is not possible to ensure the 
exact calibration of duty cycle which can cause an error in the data that are read.
.
The high-frequency level shifters used in the transmitter can distort the transmit-
ted data, which complicates the accurate transmission of data. These deviations 
affect the time margin of the transmitted data and in some cases even cause data 
losses. Therefore, it is obvious that such a structure of level shifters limits further 
increase of data transfer rate.
.
The current support systems used in the transmitter do not perform rise/fall 
calibration during signal transmission, as a result of which the reliability of 
integrated circuits is signiﬁcantly reduced.
.
It is difﬁcult to calibrate the deviations due to wave reﬂections using signal width 
modulation equalization methods, which leads to the error of the transmitted data.

128

Signal Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated Circuits
It is obvious that these equalization systems are not applicable to high-precision 
integrated circuits, because they do not provide high reliability of the 
transmitted data. 
Thus, taking into account the existing problems, the following principles are 
proposed for the design of signal transmission calibration means:
.
To design a new duty cycle calibration system, which will allow to implement 
calibration of duty cycle during signal transmission, as a result of which it will be 
possible to ensure high reliability of the read data.
.
To implement a new high-frequency level shifter architecture in the transmitter, 
which will not distort the transmitted signal and will ensure high reliability of the 
transmitted data.
.
To reduce the dependence on process-voltage-temperature deviations in the 
current support node through the current control system and to implement the 
equalization of signal rise/falls during the operation of integrated circuits through 
its new structure, as a result of which the reliability of the transmitted data will 
increase signiﬁcantly.
.
To implement such a method of equalization system that will allow to reduce the 
effect of the transmission line and increase the reliability of reading the 
transmitted data. 
Thus, principles of developing signal transmission calibration means have been 
proposed, which will allow to signiﬁcantly improve their main technical character-
istics and parameters: speed, reliability of data transmission, and reading. 
Conclusions 
1. One of the most relevant problems in the creation of modern integrated circuits is 
the development of signal transmission calibration means, which can signiﬁcantly 
improve their main parameters and contribute to further increase in the speed of I/ 
O cells. 
2. The main obstacles to increasing the speed of data transmitted in I/O cells and 
their lossless transmission are process-voltage-temperature deviations, the inﬂu-
ence of transmission lines, and deviations caused in transmitter sub-connections. 
Development of signal transmission calibration means is an effective way to 
eliminate them. 
3. Research of existing approaches and means of signal transmission systems in 
integrated circuits shows that although they provide a signiﬁcant improvement in 
speed, data transmission and reading reliability, and power consumption, from 
the point of view of efﬁciency, the latter do not meet the modern requirements for 
practical design. 
4. Principles of developing signal transmission calibration means in integrated 
circuits have been proposed, which will allow to signiﬁcantly improve their 
main technical characteristics and parameters: speed, reliability of data transfer 
and reading, and consumed power.

3.2.1 
Method of Detection and Self-Regulation of Duty Cycle 
Deviations in High-Speed Integrated Circuits 
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, deviations in the signal duty cycle at the receiver can 
reduce the reliability of the read data, causing system failures. One of the main 
factors of their occurrence are PVT deviations, which can appear both before the 
transmission of the signal and during its transmission (Fig. 3.26). However, currently 
used duty cycle calibration systems are mostly applied before the signal transmission 
process. That is the reason that deviations during signal transmission are not taken 
into account, and the reliability of the system decreases signiﬁcantly. 
Thus, it is obvious that in order to increase the reliability of I/O cells, deviations 
during signal transmission should also be taken into account. 
The proposed duty cycle calibration system (Fig. 3.27 [92]) detects and calibrates 
the duty cycle deviations during the entire operation of the I/O cell. 
In modern I/O cells, the processing of the transmitted data is carried out by 
reading the data around the reference voltage. It is supplied either through the 
DAC in the receiver [93] or through the external DAC. The proposed calibration 
system, detecting deviations in the duty cycle of the signal, modiﬁes the input code 
of the internal DAC of the receiver and leads to a change in the reference voltage. As 
a result, calibration of the duty cycle of the received signal occurs.

It should be noted that such a structure allows not to interrupt the data transfer 
process and carry out the calibration in parallel, neutralizing the duty cycle devia-
tions caused by PVT deviations and other reasons. 
The purpose of using the RC integrator (Fig. 3.29) is to obtain the constant 
voltage level of the received signal, which expresses the value of the duty cycle. It 
consists of a classic RC integrator circuit and an analog repeater. The analog repeater 
is designed on the basis of operational ampliﬁer and aims to keep the value of the 
integrated voltage constant. 
Thus, in this way, it is possible to obtain the value of the duty cycle (Fig. 3.30) 
and detect its deviations. For example, integration of a signal with an amplitude of 
1 V and a duty cycle of 50% will result in a constant signal voltage level of 0.5 V, 
and in the case of a duty cycle of 40%—0.4 V. 
It can be noticed that the integration process does not happen instantaneously. In 
order to establish a voltage corresponding to duty cycle at the output of the

integrator, ~50 ns is required, which determines the duration of one system calibra-
tion cycle. The latter is calculated for the PVT in which the conﬁrmation time is the 
longest.

Signal Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated Circuits
Fig. 3.31 Structure of 
used ADC 
In the calibration system, the ADC (Fig. 3.31) is used to generate digital codes 
corresponding to the output voltages of the integrator and RVDN. 
It should be noted that the voltage provided by RVDN (Fig. 3.32) is equal to half 
of the amplitude of the received signal, that is, to 50% of the duty cycle. As a result 
of this process, digital codes are formed, one of which is equal to the value of the 
duty cycle at the given moment of the signal, and the other is equal to the value of 
50% of duty cycle. Since there is a power-to-ground current path in the RVDN, a 
PMOS transistor is used to reduce the leakage current. It opens when the ADC is 
supplied with a voltage equivalent to 50% of the duty cycle. The supply of these 
voltages is carried out by means of an analog multiplexer, which selects one of the 
outputs of the RVDN or the integrator and connects it to the ADC. 
A digital logic cell is used to detect deviations, which compares the output codes 
of the ADC. After the comparison operation, it supplies the DAC node with a new 
input code, as a result of which the reference voltage of the receiver changes and the 
duty cycle of the received signal is calibrated. This process continues until the duty 
cycle reaches the target 50%. It should be noted that the accuracy of the system can 
be improved by increasing the bitness of the ADC, which contributes to the detection 
of smaller deviations in the duty cycle.

Estimation of Duty Cycle Deviation Detection and Efﬁciency 
of Self-Calibration Method 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a high-frequency 
receiver was designed using a SAED 28 nm [97] technological process. Simulations 
were also performed under 27 PVT conditions, when the frequency of the received 
signal is 2133 MHz, which corresponds to the LPDDR4 standard. During simula-
tions, the received signal previously contained ±15% duty cycle deviations, which 
the system calibrated (Fig. 3.33). 
From the simulation results, it can be seen that the system calibrated the signal 
duty cycle to 50.1% within 3 μs. It can be noticed that a signiﬁcant improvement of 
the duty cycle is already registered after 1 μs of the system operation. In particular, at 
1.55 μs, the value of the duty cycle becomes 51.8%, and already at 2.25 μs, it 
becomes 50.9%. 
The system digitizes reference and integrated voltage values at 25 ns intervals, 
since the signal integration process takes 50 ns for the slowest PVT condition. 
Therefore, the duration of one system calibration cycle is also equal to 50 ns. 
Thus, the sel signal updates the constant voltage level of the signal corresponding 
to duty cycle, and after the completion of each calibration cycle, it gets closer to the 
target value of the duty cycle (Fig. 3.34). 
The simulation results (Table 3.2) show that the calibration system can work 
effectively in different PVT conditions. In the worst PVT condition, the system 
calibrated duty cycle, reaching it to 50.5%. 
In general, it was possible to calibrate the pre-biased duty cycle signals for 
different PVT conditions and correct the duty cycle in the range of 49.7–50.5%.

Simulations showed that the system consumes a maximum power of 3.95 mW, 
which allows it to be used in low-power ICs. It should be noted that the proposed 
structure allows the calibration of the duty cycle to be carried out in the range of 
40–60% deviations. That range was chosen taking into account the range of possible 
deviations of the duty cycle in modern ICs.

The results show that the duty cycle calibration time is almost the same for 
different PVT conditions and does not depend on the direction of deviations 
(Fig. 3.35). 
The proposed mixed-signal system is applicable to both periodic signal and data 
sequences. For this purpose, a simulation was carried out for the PRBS5 data 
sequence with a frequency of 2133 MHz (Figs. 3.36 and 3.37). 
While reading of the above data, the system changed the reference voltage of the 
receiver, as a result of which it became possible to restore the crossing point of the 
eye diagram.

Method of Increasing the Reliability of High-frequency 
Data in Transmitters 
As it was mentioned, as a result of the increase in the data transfer rate, the input 
capacitances of sub-blocks in I/O cells begin to signiﬁcantly suppress the transferred 
data. For this reason, in high-frequency LS (Fig. 3.38) [101], the output of a MOS 
transistor is used as an input to reduce the effect of its gate-source capacitance. 
As a result of this structure, distortions of the transmitted data appear; in partic-
ular, step-like segments appear during the signal rise/fall. The latter signiﬁcantly 
reduces the reliability of the transmitted data and negatively affects its time margin. 
Since LSs are used in almost all I/O cells, it is obvious that in order to increase the 
reliability of the data transmitted in the I/O cell, the signal distortion properties of 
high-frequency LSs should be neutralized.

Signal Transmission Calibration Systems in Integrated Circuits
Fig. 3.39 The structure of the rise/fall correction system 
Thus, a new high-frequency LS structure was designed, in which a rise/fall 
correction system was introduced (Fig. 3.39) [102], which allows to calibrate the 
signal jitter and duty cycle deviations, as well as reset the rise/fall target speeds. 
The rise/fall correction system was implemented using digital logic cells. Its input 
node is the XOR, the transmitted data is applied to one of its inputs, and the delayed 
version of that data is applied to the other input. Thus, XOR creates pulse signals 
during the difference of inputs (Fig. 3.40) [103]. This signal informs about signal 
switches, during which the system should amplify the rise/fall times of the transmit-
ted data. Since the system is implemented using digital logic cells, it occupies a small 
area. 
For proper processing of the output signal of XOR, a frequency divider 
implemented on the basis of the DFF [103] was used, which is switched during 
rise times at the output of the XOR. As a result, pulse-shaped signals are formed at 
the output of the rise/fall correction node (Fig. 3.41). 
The frequency divider supplies these signals to MOS transistors in high-
frequency LS, which open during switching (Fig. 3.42) and provide additional 
current to the interconnection points “а” and “b.” 
The rise/fall correction node is connected in parallel to LS (Fig. 3.43), thus not 
interfering with the data transfer process.

It should be noted that when the switching of the input signal occurs at one of the 
“a” or “b” interconnection points, P4 and P5 MOS transistors are in the open state 
(Fig. 3.44). In all other conditions, they are closed. 
Thus, the proposed rise/fall correction system calibrates the distorted signals, 
increasing the reliability of transmitted data.

Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Method of Increasing the Reliability 
of High-frequency Data in Transmitter Sub-nodes 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of rise/fall correction system, a high-frequency 
LS was designed, as well as a signal correction node. Simulations were also 
performed at 27 PVT conditions for SAED 28 nm technology [97]. The measure-
ments were carried out for two cases: when the rise/fall correction system is on and 
when it is off. The simulation results, without the use of the correction system, are 
presented in Table 3.4.

It can be observed that without the application of the correction system, the output 
signal of the high-frequency LS contains a large jitter (10.83 ps), which occurs at a 
slow PVT condition of 1.14 V, 125 ° C (Fig. 3.45). 
In the case of using the correction system, the step-like sections at the 
interconnecting points “a” and “b” disappear (Fig. 3.46). 
The simulations showed that when using the system, the step-like sections 
disappear in all PVT conditions (Fig. 3.47). 
The simulation results of high-frequency LS in the case of using the correction 
system are presented in Table 3.5. 
It can be noticed that the jitter of the output signal is signiﬁcantly reduced when 
using the system. The system also calibrated the duty cycle values; before using the 
system, the duty cycle values ranged between 48.7% and 51.1%, and after the system 
was applied, the range decreased signiﬁcantly, reaching 49.55–50.5% (Fig. 3.48).

Thus, the designed rise/fall correction system signiﬁcantly improves the reliabil-
ity of the transmitted signal in the transmitter. Simulations of the proposed system 
showed that it calibrates the duty cycle deviations by 39.5% and also reduces the 
jitter by about twice. However, it increases the area of the high-frequency LS in the 
transmitter by 12%. 
3.2.3 
Method of Calibration of Asymmetries of Rise/Fall 
Times of High-frequency Signals 
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, when the speed of the transmitted signal increases, the 
calibration of data deviations becomes difﬁcult. The main sources of these deviations 
are PVT deviations, supply voltage ﬂuctuations, as well as noise. All the mentioned 
factors cause asymmetries of the transmitted signal rise/fall times, which signiﬁ-
cantly reduce the reliability of I/O cells (Fig. 3.49). 
In order to eliminate deviations, CSSs are used, which supply additional current 
to the pre-buffer (PB) sub-nodes, as a result of which the rise/fall times are equalized 
[104]. Deviations can occur during the operation of I/O cell, but currently used CSSs 
do not calibrate the asymmetries of rise/fall times during data transmission. 
The proposed rise/fall asymmetry calibration system allows correction of devia-
tions during the entire operation of the transmitter (Fig. 3.50). The transmitted data is 
divided into two taps, one of which connects to the calibration system and the other 
to the PB. 
Fig. 3.49 Asymmetry of rise/fall times in the transmitter

3.2
Design Principles of Signal Transmission Calibration Systems. . .
145
Fig. 3.50 Placement of the calibration system in the transmitter 
This structure allows uninterrupted data transfer and calibration during I/O cell 
operation. The calibration system is clocked by the fVCO signal supplied from the 
voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) in the IC. The purpose of the system is to detect 
the asymmetry of rise/fall times during data transmission, after which to provide 
additional current to the output node of the PB. It should be noted that deviations can 
occur both in the case of increasing and decreasing rise/falls. For this reason, the 
system detects in advance the direction of deviation of rise/falls and ampliﬁes the 
NMOS or PMOS cascades of the PB output and calibration rise/falls in the given 
direction. The main components of calibration system (Fig. 3.51) are the input logic 
cell, integrator, comparators, and logic cell. 
The input logic cell separates one period from the transmitted signal, which is 
then processed to perform the rise/fall time duration calculation. The processing of 
that signal is carried out by means of an integrator (Fig. 3.52), which slows down the 
part of one period of the transmitted signal and allows to calculate the duration of 
rise/fall times. 
The slowed signal is supplied to two comparators, the reference voltage of one of 
which corresponds to 90% of the supply voltage, and the other to 10%. This allows 
forming signals informing about the start and end of switching of the input signal at 
the output of the comparators (Fig. 3.53). 
For the comparison of high-frequency signals, the clocked comparator (Fig. 3.54) 
was used in the calibration system [105]. 
Signals informing about the start and end of switching of the input signal are 
supplied to a logic cell that counts the durations of rise/fall times and forms the 
PMOS and NMOS control signals. The latter are connected to the output transistors 
of PB. They turn off or on the PB’s output PMOS or NMOS cascades, resulting in 
changes in the rise/fall speeds. The logic cell (Fig. 3.55) calculates the speed of the

input rise/falls and registers it in registers, after which it detects the direction of 
deviation using digital comparators. Then the control node supplies the PMOS and 
NMOS control signals, respectively. This operation is performed until the rise/fall 
durations of the transmitted signal are equal.

It should be noted that the calculation of the speed of the rise/fall times of the 
transmitted signal occurs through fVCO signal, increasing the frequency of which will 
improve the accuracy of the system. The frequency selection of the fVCO signal was 
made taking into account the integration duration of the signal. 
The speed should be sufﬁcient to perform the calculation during the change of 
rise/fall times. 
Thus, with the help of the proposed calibration system, it is possible to correct the 
asymmetries of rise/fall times during the signal transmission, reducing jitter of the 
signal. 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of Calibration Method of Asymmetries 
of Rise/Fall Times of High-frequency Signals 
A high-frequency transmitter was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
calibration system for the asymmetry of signal rise/fall times. The simulations 
were carried out in 27 PVT conditions using a signal corresponding to the DDR4 
standard. It should be noted that for the evaluation of the performance of the 
calibration system, the rise/falls of the input signal of the transmitter were 
pre-biased in order to simulate the real deviations. Input signals containing signif-
icant deviations were applied to the input of the transmitter, which are presented in 
Table 3.6.

Fig. 3.56 The process of calibration of a signal containing deviations 
In the case of slow PVT, the asymmetry of the initial rise/fall times of the input 
signal of the transmitter was 24.8 ps (Fig. 3.56), which is quite a large bias and can 
cause signiﬁcant oscillation and jitter in the back buffer (BB). 
It can be noticed that the asymmetry of the rise/fall times of the input signal is 
corrected during three periods through the calibration system, making only 1.6 ps 
(Fig. 3.57). It should be noted that the operation of the system does not depend on the 
direction of deviations, and it does not interrupt the process of transmission of 
signals. 
The calibration accuracy of rise/fall asymmetry can be increased by selecting the 
sizes of additional PMOS and NMOS transistors in the output node of the PB. It 
should be noted that the time for the calibration process is different in the case of 
other PVTs, but it does not exceed ﬁve periods. The values of calibrated rise/falls as 
a result of the system application are presented in Table 3.7. 
A comparison with modern rise/fall asymmetry calibration systems was also 
carried out, which conﬁrmed the effectiveness of the proposed system (Table 3.8). 
Thus, the calibration system of designed rise/fall asymmetries signiﬁcantly 
reduces the effect of PVT deviations, as a result of which the reliability of the 
transmitted signal increases. Simulations of the proposed system showed that it 
calibrates the asymmetries of the signal rise/falls, reaching it to 1.2%, and also 
reduces jitter. However, it increases the current consumed in the PB node, which 
is 2.26 mA for the worst case.

Calibration Method of Signal Distortion Caused by 
Transmission Line 
As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, the transmission line signiﬁcantly suppresses the trans-
mitted signal, causing inaccuracies and data losses (Fig. 3.58). It should be noted 
that, even with a coherent line, the transmission line still suppresses the signal, 
reducing its amplitude and also slowing down the speed of the signal rise/fall times. 
The proposed system (Fig. 3.59) [106] reduces the effect of the transmission line. 
It supplies additional current to the output buffers, as a result of which the signal rise/ 
fall speeds are improved, and it becomes possible to neutralize the losses caused by 
the transmission line. The designed system is applicable in high-frequency I/O cells 
and does not interrupt the data transmission process in the transmitter. 
In order to carry out signal calibration in the proposed system, a slew rate control 
ampliﬁer (Fig. 3.60)  [107] was designed, which was implemented using an “XOR” 
logic cell and a frequency divider. It is placed in the node of the transmitter, and 
during the signal transmission it carries out the ampliﬁcation of its output signal.

The input signal is applied to one of the inputs of XOR, and its delayed version to 
the other. As a result, a pulse signal is formed at the output of the “XOR,” which gets 
a logical 1 value during rise/fall times of the input signal (Fig. 3.61)  [105]. It should

be noted that the signal delay node was implemented using sequentially connected 
buffers.

Since the XOR should work at high signal frequencies and have a low delay, the 
following structure of XOR was chosen (Fig. 3.62) [107]. 
In order to ensure ampliﬁcation of PMOS and NMOS nodes in BB, it is necessary 
to divide the output signal of “XOR” into two taps (Figs. 3.63 and 3.64) [107]. 
For this purpose, the frequency of the output signal of the XOR is reduced twice 
by means of a DFF. As a result of this, two signals are formed: PMOS and NMOS 
ampliﬁcation, through which additional current is supplied to the BB during

switching of the input signal. It should be noted that the proposed signal supplies 
additional current from the BB to the transmission line only during signal transitions 
and is switched off in its static regions to avoid consuming additional current. It is 
also possible to control the operation of the proposed system and BB using the 
enable signal <1:0>, and if necessary, turn them off (Table 3.9).

Evaluation of Effectiveness of Calibration Method of Signal Distortion 
Caused by Transmission Line 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, the high-frequency transmitter 
and slew rate control system were designed. The design was carried out for a 
32/28 nm technology, and simulations were also carried out under basic PVT 
conditions. They were implemented using a 1.2 V supply voltage corresponding to 
the DDR4 [106] standard and a 1200 MHz data transfer rate. It should be noted that 
the output resistance of the BB corresponding to the DDR4 standard is equal to 32 Ω, 
and the values of the two matching resistors at the end of the transmission line are 
120 Ω (Fig. 3.65). Two cases were compared to evaluate the efﬁciency of the 
system—the signal passes through the transmission line when the system is off 
and when it is on. 
When the system is off, the transmission line signiﬁcantly suppresses the ampli-
tude of the transmitted signal, as well as the speed of its rise/fall times. In particular,

for the typical case, the high constant voltage level of the signal decreases by 
200 mV from the target value (Fig. 3.66).

For other PVTs, the signal amplitude is also suppressed, and for the slow case, the 
DC signal voltage level is reduced by 260 mV (Fig. 3.67). 
Measurements of signal jitter and the speed of rise/fall times were also carried out 
when the proposed system was turned off (Table 3.10). 
Thus, it can be noticed that the structure of BBs currently used signiﬁcantly limits 
the further increase in signal transmission speed. As a result of using the proposed 
system, it was possible to reduce the inﬂuence of the transmission line and improve 
the amplitude of the transmitted signal and the speeds of rise/fall times (Fig. 3.68). 
It can be noticed that when the system is used, the speed of the signal rise/fall 
times increases drastically, and the signal approaches the target value of its constant 
voltage level. The signal also improves in the case of other PVT conditions 
(Fig. 3.69). 
It should be noted that the system connects additional resistors to the BB during 
switching, only then supplying additional current from the BB to the transmission 
line. In the static areas of the signal, this current is absent, as a result of which the 
consumed current decreases. Jitter measurements were also carried out, which 
conﬁrmed that the signal jitter is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the proposed system 
(Table 3.11). 
The use of the system also helps to increase the opening of the eye diagram of the 
signal (Figs. 3.70 and 3.71). Its horizontal opening increases by 13% and vertical by 
10%.

Thus, through the designed calibration system, it is possible to reduce the effect of 
the transmission line, as a result of which the speed of the signal rise/fall times 
increases by 50%, the horizontal and vertical openings of the signal eye at the end of 
the transmission line increase by 13% and 10%, respectively, as well as signal jitter 
is reduced by 20.7%. However, the proposed system increases the area of BB by 
13%.

Conclusion 
1. Principles of development of signal transmission calibration means in integrated 
circuits have been proposed, which allow to signiﬁcantly improve their main 
technical characteristics and parameters: speed, reliability of data transmission 
and reading, consumed power, etc. 
2. A self-calibration method for detection of deviations in the duty cycle of the 
signal has been developed, in which, due to reading the data through the applied 
digital nodes, it signiﬁcantly improves the reliability of the data and the calibra-
tion duty cycle with an accuracy of ±0.5% at the expense of the increase of 
consumed power of the receiver by only 3.95 mW. 
3. A method of increasing the reliability of high-frequency data in the sub-nodes of 
the transmitter was proposed, which, due to the supply of additional current, 
calibrates the deviations of the duty cycle in the voltage converter by 39.5% and 
also reduces the jitter twice at the expense of increasing the area of the high-
frequency voltage converter in the transmitter by 12%. 
4. A calibration method for the asymmetry of high-frequency signal rise/falls has 
been developed, which signiﬁcantly reduces the effect of process-voltage-tem-
perature deviations, as a result of which the asymmetry of the rise/falls is 
calibrated, reaching 1.2%; the jitter is also reduced at the expense of the 
pre-buffer, increasing the consumed current by 2.26 mA. 
5. A transmission line-induced signal distortion calibration method was proposed, 
which reduces the effect of the transmission line, as a result of which the speed of 
the transmitted signal rise/fall times increases by 50%, the horizontal and vertical 
openings of the signal eye increase by 13% and 10%, respectively, as well as the 
signal jitter is reduced by 20.7% due to the 13% increase in output buffer area.

Importance of Means to Improve the Linearity 
of Signal’s Analog-to-Digital Conversion 
with Self-Calibration 
Nowadays, it is impossible to imagine the operation of modern electronic devices 
without 
digital-to-analog 
(DAC) 
and 
analog-to-digital 
(ADC) 
converters 
[1, 2]. DACs and ADCs are fundamental working blocks in many complex inte-
grated circuits (ICs), and the accuracy of their operation directly depends on the 
whole system [2–4]. The working drawbacks of these blocks can lead to system 
errors. Therefore, the ﬁrst task is to design IC as per technical parameters. But in 
many cases, even a precisely designed circuit does not provide accurate operation 
after manufacturing, the reason of which is precisely the manufacturing inaccuracies 
and not the errors, made at the design stage [5–8]. To present the problem in more 
detail, the simplest DAC, the Kelvin divider or r-string DAC, is considered [9– 
12]. The N-bit version of this DAC contains 2N series equal resistors and 2N 
switches, typically of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) con-
struction, connected between the resistors and the output (Fig. 4.1) [9]. Depending 
on the digital code, the corresponding voltage is transferred through switches at the 
output, forming an analog signal. One of the advantages of this DAC is the 
monotonic transfer function, which is caused by the resistors connected in series, 
and even if one of the resistors is short-connected, the voltage is distributed among 
the remaining resistors, and the error is not signiﬁcant. A problem can arise when the 
values of resistors differ from each other, leading to nonlinear operation of the 
circuit. 
Usually, at the design stage, the values of series resistors are chosen equal, but 
due to random deviations and inaccuracies as a result of manufacturing process, they

deviate from the nominal, as a result of which the nonlinearity of the circuit increases 
[9, 13–16].

Fig. 4.1 r-String DAC 
The main parameters characterizing the linearity of ADCs and DACs are differ-
ential (DNL) and integral (INL) nonlinearities [9]. In an ideal case, when non-
linearities are absent in the operation of DAC, the increment of the digital code 
should correspond to a voltage increase in the analog output equal to one least 
signiﬁcant bit (LSB), and in the case of an ADC, a change in the input voltage of 
1 LSB should correspond to a switching from one value of the digital code to the 
next one. The DNL error is deﬁned as the maximum deviation of the switching from 
the ideal 1 LSB size in the transfer function. The ideal DAC transfer function without 
linearity error (Fig. 4.2) has a monotonic view, and the view of the nonlinear DAC 
transfer function is non-monotonic (Fig. 4.3) [9]. 
The numerical code is represented in the decimal system. The linear transfer 
function of the ADC will have an ideal stepwise view, and the transfer function with 
linearity error will have a non-monotonic view (Fig. 4.4). 
A DNL error can lead to missing code and voltage [9]. When DNL is less than 
one 1 LSB for at least one of the switches, then DNL is considered non-monotonic 
and the transfer function contains one local maximum or minimum. When DNL is 
greater than 1 LSB, the problem of monotonicity does not arise, but such a trans-
mission characteristic is also not so desirable (Fig. 4.5) [9]. 
In many DAC applications, it is unacceptable to have a non-monotonic transfer 
function, as this can lead to a complete failure of the circuit, especially in cases where

the DAC is part of a negative feedback system, and its non-monotonicity can make 
the feedback positive. The DNL of the DAC is deﬁned as the deviation of the 
switching from the ideal 1 LSB size in the transfer function (4.1) [9, 17, 18].

The INL of a DAC for a given code is the difference between the available

An INL error can also lead to code loss. DNL and INL are mainly caused by 
technological deviations and inaccuracies in the manufacturing process. Usually, the 
deviation of discrete electrical elements (resistors, capacitors, etc.) from the nominal 
value after the manufacturing process is not very large and does not exceed 1%, but 
the situation is different in ICs. In ICs, after manufacturing, the deviation of the 
parameters of separate cells can reach up to ±25% from the nominal [19, 20]. DACs 
and ADCs, manufactured with such deviations, have signiﬁcant nonlinearity errors 
and often code loss due to a large DNL or INL error. 
Using the example of the r-string DAC, the effect of deviations in the physical 
parameters of electrical components on the system performance caused by 
manufacturing is considered. In the r-string DAC, such deviations are carried mainly 
by resistors and switches, which have a CMOS structure. Their parasitic parameters, 
such as parasitic capacitance and resistance, also deviate from the nominal values 
during manufacturing process, which in turn affects the delay of switch, leading to 
inaccuracies in the operation of a circuit. 
Thus, even precisely designed ICs, which fully meet speciﬁcation requirements at 
design stage, inevitably suffer deterioration of operating parameters as a result of 
manufacturing, the cause of which is the manufacturing itself. In particular, 
nonlinearity errors in DACs and ADCs increase, which can lead to system malfunc-
tion and as a result reduce the percentage of the output of operating circuits. 
However, after the end of manufacturing process, it is not possible to correct the 
operating parameters of the latter, so the development of self-calibration deviation 
correction systems in the IC is an important issue. 
4.1.2 
Need for Means to Improve the Linearity of Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Self-Calibration 
The problems discussed and proposed in Sect. 4.1.1, as already mentioned, cannot 
be completely solved at the design stage. For this reason, it is necessary to develop 
and introduce such means that will allow correcting errors and deviations in the 
manufacturing process by self-calibration after manufacturing, to have a precisely 
operating circuit. The problem is challenging, because the semiconductor industry is 
one of the fastest growing directions of the economy. The growth of problems in the 
sector also creates the need to have compatible solutions. Thus, ICs with embedded 
self-calibration systems are in high demand because, in addition to solving the 
problem of improving IC operating parameters, they simultaneously increase the 
number of operating circuits, reducing production costs. However, developing such 
systems is not an easy task.

•
It is very difﬁcult, if not impossible, to have complex testing and measurement 
systems in an IC, considering area/power consumption ratio.
•
Such embedded systems, in turn, have inaccuracies and may cause additional 
errors. Therefore, the proposed solutions should be as error-free as possible, or the 
errors should be less signiﬁcant.
•
Testing, measurement, and subsequent self-calibration should be performed in 
the order of minimum steps, because the more complex the system, the longer the 
self-calibration time, and the design of such a system requires more resources. 
Thus, the development of self-calibration DACs and ADCs means of increasing 
the linearity is a very necessary and, at the same time, difﬁcult task. 
4.1.3 
Causes of Nonlinearity Occurrence in Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion and the Importance 
and Necessity of its Reduction in Flash ADCs 
Another well-known circuit is discussed, where again due to manufacturing devia-
tions and inaccuracies, deterioration of the quality of the circuit operation up to 
complete failure can occur. Flash ADC is the fastest and simplest ADC in structure 
[21–24]. This ADC allows to digitize 2n number of voltage values through 2n-1 
number of comparators. At the output, the digital code is generated during one stage. 
The speed of the ﬂash ADC depends only on comparators and to some extent on a 
decoder (Fig. 4.6) [21]. 
The reference voltages, applied to comparators, are obtained by a series resistors. 
A chain of resistors is connected between positive and negative reference voltages 
(or between the positive voltage and zero). A 2n-1-bit output code (thermal code) is 
formed at the output of comparators, which is converted into an N-bit digital output 
code by means of a decoder with 2n inputs. Out of the 2n inputs of the decoder, only 
2n-1 have comparators [21]. 
The number of comparators used in a ﬂash ADC is exponentially dependent on 
the number of bits in the output digital code. Therefore, the use of ﬂash ADCs in 
systems requiring high bit is not very appropriate. In practice, the bit limit of ﬂash 
ADCs does not exceed 8 bits [25–27]. The main advantage of ﬂash ADC is speed. 
One of its disadvantages is the large area it occupies [28]. 
In this circuit, as in the case of the r-string DAC, the manufacturing inaccuracies 
mainly affect the deviation from the nominal value of resistors, as well as the 
linearity of comparators, which leads to nonlinearity of ﬂash ADC. 
If the deviation of resistors represents a deviation from the nominal value, then 
the linearity in case of a comparator is due to several factors. To present the problem 
more clearly, the simplest comparator (Fig. 4.7) [29–33] is considered. 
The main function of a comparator is to compare two reference voltages: when 
one voltage exceeds the other, the output of the comparator switches. Comparators

are basically high-gain OpAmps without feedback. The input-output characteristic 
of the comparator is given in Fig. 4.8 [34].

Offset is the input differential voltage when the comparator output voltage is zero. 
In the case of an ideal comparator, the offset is equal to zero [34–40]. The accuracy 
of the ﬂash ADC is practically dependent on matching the resistors and the linearity 
of the comparators. As already mentioned, the reference voltages are obtained by 
means of a voltage divider, and the value of the reference voltage generated by every 
ith resistance can be determined by the formula (4.3)  [21]:

An ideal comparator assumes a change in the output voltage level only when the 
voltage values of the inputs equal each other, but in practice the comparator has an 
offset error and the condition does not occur. In case of offset, the condition (4.4) 
needs to be met for switching the output of the comparator to “1” or “0” [21]. 
Vout = 1, when V ≥V þ Voffset, Vout = 0, when V < V þ Voffset: 
ð4:4Þ 
From the expression (4.4), it is possible to obtain the voltage value of the 
switching point of the i-th comparator (4.5) [35]. 
Vsp, i = Vi þ Voffset
ð4:5Þ 
The offset causes nonlinearity in the overall ﬂash ADC; as a result, there is a DNL 
and INL error and, in some cases, even missing code (Fig. 4.9) [9]. 
Comparators are usually designed so that the offset error is minimal, and even if 
there is a nonlinearity error, the DNL or INL does not exceed 1 LSB, so that there is 
no missing code. However, random deviations after the manufacturing process lead 
to a non-monotonic transfer function due to the offset error and thus missing code. 
To avoid such a problem, it would be appropriate to have a self-calibration offset 
system implemented, which would allow to correct the offset error and therefore 
have a monotonic transfer function, avoiding missing code. 
Thus, the operating parameters of ﬂash ADCs are inevitably degraded after the 
manufacturing process. Basically, the nonlinearity of the transfer function in ﬂash 
ADCs is caused by the deviation of the values of series resistors of reference voltages 
from the nominal, as well as the nonlinearity of comparators. The reasons for 
nonlinearity of comparators are offset and ampliﬁcation errors.

The system embedded in the observed circuit can also improve the operating 
parameters of the degraded circuit by means of self-calibration. The principle circuit 
of the current DAC is presented in Fig. 4.10 [41–46]. It consists of current sources of 
different weights which are connected to the output by a controlled code and provide 
the appropriate current at the output. 
Transistors with metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure serve as a current

where Ids is the source-drain current of the n-th transistor, Vgsn is the gate-source 
voltage of the n-th transistor, Vth is the threshold voltage of the transistor, and λ is the 
channel length modulation coefﬁcient. The formula is for an ideal case when the 
parameters and currents of transistors have no deviations. 
As in the case of other circuits, there are deviations in the physical parameters of 
transistors during the manufacturing process. Physical parameters such as oxide 
thickness, threshold voltage, transistor channel width, and general IC area changes 
lead to circuit performance degradation [41]. Especially in the case when proper 
equalization of transistors is not done during the physical design stage of IC, as a 
result, the sizes of transistors differ from the values set at the beginning of the design, 
and therefore, the current deviates from the nominal values, and the output current 
has an incorrect value. Basically, there are three types of deviations: conductance 
(B), threshold voltage (V), and channel length modulation coefﬁcient (λ) [41]. Devi-
ations can be presented in the following form (4.7):

where ΔB, ΔV, and  Δλ are the deviation sizes of conductivity, threshold voltage, and 
channel length modulation coefﬁcient. In the saturation mode of M0 transistor, the

Thus, the deviation of the current source from the nominal can be represented as a

Such a deviation current will lead to nonlinearity of the current DAC; thus, 
reducing the self-calibration deviation current in DACs of similar current will lead 
to an improvement in the linearity of the overall DAC. 
Thus, the main cause of nonlinearity in current DACs is the deviations of the 
current values of the current sources from the nominal value. The main causes of 
INL and DNL are current sources with large weight—thermometric branches of the 
current. 
4.1.5 
Causes of Nonlinearity Occurrence in Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion and the Importance 
and Necessity of Its Reduction in Pipeline ADCs 
Another very popular and widely used ADC in modern ICs is the pipeline ADC. It is 
mainly used in such functions, when the operating frequencies do not exceed 
100 MHz. This ADC is slower compared to a ﬂash ADC, but it has a clear advantage 
in terms of bits. In case of the same area its bit is greater. The simplest pipeline ADC 
consists of N cascades, each of which receives B bit. In order to obtain a B-bit signal, 
the input analog signal in each cascade is ﬁrst selected and stored by a sample-hold 
(S/H) device, then exposed to coarse quantization (digitization) by means of a 
sub-range ADC (Fig. 4.13) [47]. The analog voltage is then restored by a 
sub-DAC, after which the quantized signal is subtracted from the input signal to 
yield the quantization error. To bring the quantization error to full-scale voltage 
range, the error is multiplied by 2B - 1 which is performed by OpAmp (Fig. 4.14) 
[47–50]. The obtained voltage is applied to the input of the next cascade, which has 
exactly the same structure. Timing and digital correction is done for the obtained B

bits by a synchronization and digital error correction device, after which a Y-order 
digital output corresponding to the input analog signal is obtained.

Fig. 4.14 Structure of one cascade 
A few important features can be noted here. The larger B is, the smaller N is, that 
is, with a smaller number of cascades, the presented operation can be performed. A 
large choice of B will reduce the size and power consumption of ADC, but the 
requirements for inter-cascade devices will become stricter [51–54]. 
It should be noted that if B is chosen equal to the ADC bits, there will be a ﬂash 
ADC whose bit is not so large. Another feature is that by using the well-known 
synchronization and digital error correction method, the requirements on the 
sub-ADCs are signiﬁcantly eased, allowing the use of comparators with low accu-
racy and power. On the other hand, since there is a S/H device in each cascade, it is 
necessary to have an OpAmp with a fast output assertion, which will lead to an 
increase in power and size, and on which the performance of the ADC will 
mainly depend. So, for example, a 12-bit pipeline ADC will look as shown in 
Fig. 4.15 [55–59]. 
The reason for the inaccuracy can be the deviations of the S/H device and the 
offset error of the OpAmp. 
Low-bit ADCs and DACs have some nonlinearity and other deviations, too. 
Inaccuracies and errors are presented in Table 4.1 [60]. Inaccuracies, such as the 
nonlinearity of ADCs and the offset of OpAmps, can be corrected by digital error 
correction means and offset error compensation methods, respectively [61]. Thus, 
the above-mentioned inaccuracies are mainly causes of general ADC linearity error. 
To see the effects of nonlinearity, consider an ADC cascade that contains a 2-bit 
ADC and assume that the bits of all other cascades are inﬁnitely large. Figs. 4.16 and 
4.17 show the I/O characteristics of an ideal 2-bit ADC [60, 62–65]. The switching 
points are determined by the ADC subconverter, and the switching magnitude 
depends on the DAC and the OpAmp gain. The switching points of ADC are 
0 and ± 1/2Vref. and their respective DAC output levels ±1/4Vref. and ± 3/4Vref.

particularly by affecting the magnitude in the case of different codes. 
Due to the inaccuracy, the output does not correspond to the switching range of 
the next cascade, so the overall ADC has nonlinearity, and there are positive and 
negative DNLs in the transfer function (Figs. 4.18 and 4.19) [60]. 
OpAmp gain error causes the output to be greater or less than the switching range 
of the next cascade, depending on whether the gain of the ampliﬁer is greater or less 
than the ideal gain [60].

Thus, gain error leads to a negative DNL if the gain of the ampliﬁer is less than 
the ideal (Figs. 4.20 and 4.21), and a positive DNL if the gain is greater than the gain 
of the ideal ampliﬁer (Figs. 4.22 and 4.23) [60]. 
Thus, OpAmps are the main source of nonlinearity in pipeline ADCs. Offset or 
gain errors in OpAmps cause DNL and INL of the entire ADC to increase. All

discussed ADCs and DACs inevitably suffer from performance degradation, and it is 
clearly necessary to have solutions that will signiﬁcantly improve the performance of 
the presented converters, allowing to have uninterrupted operating IC.

Existing Means to Improve the Linearity of Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Self-Calibration 
Many methods currently exist to reduce the nonlinearity that occurs in all presented 
ADCs and DACs. The application of methods depends on the speciﬁc type of ADC 
and DAC and, in particular, on the function they will perform in IC. The efﬁciency of

the means and the accuracy of the nonlinearity reduction are also chosen based on 
the speciﬁc function. The main parameters are the area occupied on the total IC, 
power consumption, as well as the ﬁnancial limitations. 
4.1
General Issues to Improve Linearity of Signal’s Analog-to-Digital. . .
183
Such means in turn have inaccuracies and may cause additional errors. Therefore, 
the proposed solutions should be as accurate as possible and as linear as possible. It 
is also very important that self-calibration of the system is performed in the sequence 
of minimum steps, because the accuracy of the system also depends on the number 
of steps: the smaller the sequence of steps, the less the total effect of the errors made 
in each step. 
The nonlinearity reduction is done by feedback through embedded systems, the 
purpose of which is to measure the nonlinearity error and reduce the nonlinearity 
error with the intended accuracy through a speciﬁc algorithm. Deviated parameters 
(current, offset, parameters of electrical elements) are corrected by auxiliary devices: 
calibration DACs, additional current sources, and preampliﬁers. Typically, the 
testing and measurement algorithm is implemented using a ﬁnite state machine 
(FSM). In many cases, the FSM also performs a calibration function. 
4.1.7 
Existing Methods for Reducing Nonlinearity 
in Flash ADCs 
As mentioned, the ﬂash ADC is the fastest ADC and contains a large number of 
comparators that insert offset error, resulting in deterioration of linearity. One of the 
proposed solutions to increase the linearity of this ADC is observed. The presented 
ﬂash ADC (Fig. 4.24) consists of a track and hold ampliﬁer (THA), a reference 
voltage generator matrix, four-cascade preampliﬁers, comparators, an encoder, a 
calibration feedback circuit, and an output cascade. Cascaded preampliﬁers are 
designed to increase the difference between the reference voltage and the input 
voltage to overcome the offset error of comparators. Interpolation allows to generate 
intermediate points of intersection with zero. Therefore, it is not necessary to 
compare the input with the 255 reference voltages; at the same time, the number 
of preampliﬁers decreases, saving a large area. The ﬁrst two cascades generate 
33 zero-crossing points, which are corrected by the calibrating circuit. The interpo-
lation performed by means of resistors is performed in the second and third cascades, 
as a result of which the remaining points of intersection with zero are obtained [66]. 
A pseudo-differential no-feedback THA (Fig. 4.25) is introduced to prevent the 
signal-to-noise ratio from increasing [66]. The pseudo-differential p-type MOS 
(p-MOS) source repeater is usually used as a repeater in succeeding preampliﬁers 
because it has high linearity and good offset characteristics [66–70]. 
However, due to the short channel, there are problems such as the reduction of the 
output voltage range of ADC, and in order to have the same accuracy, it is necessary 
to increase the power consumption.

Cascading current sources and the use of long-channel transistors can improve the 
output voltage range, resulting in increased linearity, but they may require larger 
voltage drops and also affect speed [70–74]. To soften this drawback, the gates of 
M2 and M4 transistors are connected together instead of connecting the input signal 
to the reference voltage (Fig. 4.25). Here, M2 and M4 operate as dynamic current

sources for M1 and M3 source repeaters [66]. As the input Vip increases, ID1 
decreases due to the decrease of source-drain voltage of M2 transistor. However, 
the complementary Vin input decreases due to ID1 current. This approach increases 
the gain of the ampliﬁer. A similar structure provides a parallel opportunity to 
improve signal rise/fall times without consuming static power. Thus, the gain, gain 
bandwidth product, and the slew rate are improved by 20, 40, and 30%, 
respectively [66].

In CMOS ﬂash ADCs, circuit element mismatches and manufacturing inaccura-
cies cause offset errors in comparators and preampliﬁers. Averaging methods can 
partially solve the problem and increase the linearity of ADC; however, long-
channel transistors are still required in preampliﬁers, and degradation of linearity 
is inevitable. To solve this problem, a calibration circuit is proposed, which cali-
brates the reference voltage by means of correction currents in such a way that offset 
errors caused by preampliﬁers and comparators are neutralized. The part marked 
with dotted lines in Fig. 4.24 is responsible for the self-calibration process. The 
digital code generator generates codes corresponding to the ideal ADC output, which 
are transferred to calibration input generator. The calibration input generator con-
tains precision-valued resistors and can provide linearity equal to 10-bit. Φ1c and 
Φ2c keep cal.ip and cal.in when Φ1 and Φ2 turn off Vip and Vin (Fig. 4.25). The 
ADC quantizes the calibration input instead of the actual input. The correction 
currents are then determined by comparing the output of the ADC with the ideal 
code based on the amount of error obtained. The range of current correction is 
determined by the bit rate of the control counter and the discrete current source 
outside IC. A similar circuit allows nonlinearity correction up to ±10 LSB with a 
correction step of 0.2 LSB (Fig. 4.26) [66]. After calibration, the calibration inputs 
are switched to ADC inputs, and the circuit returns from calibration mode to 
operating mode. The maximum calibration time is 0.12 ms [66]. 
The offsets are also calibrated as a result of comparison. The offset errors of the 
third and fourth cascade preampliﬁers and comparators are not corrected. The circuit 
was run for 24 h, after which the deviations of the parameters were checked, which 
did not undergo signiﬁcant changes. In order to test the proposed circuit, a sinusoid 
with a frequency of 2.3 MHz and a holding speed of 1.25 GS/s was taken as an input 
analog signal. Without self-calibration, the INL of ADC was measured, and in the 
worst case it is equal to 3.3 LSB. After the self-calibration mode, the INL of the 
circuit is reduced up to 1.1 LSB, and the DNL is reduced to 1.3 LSB [66]. 
Thus, the system of linearity increase with self-calibration in ﬂash ADC partially 
solves the problem of nonlinearity reduction, because the values of INL and DNL are 
still greater than 1 LSB, and therefore, missing loss will inevitably occur, which is 
unacceptable. In addition, the proposed solution occupies a large area, and the self-
calibration algorithm consists of a large number of successive steps, as a result of 
which additional errors in each successive step lead to a large error in total.

Existing Methods for Reducing Nonlinearity 
in Current DACs 
The main cause of nonlinearity in current DACs is the mismatch of current source 
transistors to each other, which leads to deviation of currents from nominal values. 
Current deviation is a static error, so it is corrected once when the circuit is switched 
on. There are many approaches to solving the problem. The most general view of the 
solution is presented (Fig. 4.27)  [5, 75–80]. Current deviation error correction 
methods are based on three main operations: self-checking or self-error measure-
ment, providing a correction process with a feedback circuit or algorithm, and the 
self-calibration operation implemented by it. The deviation current correction range 
of each tuning DAC (reg DAC) is determined by the maximum possible thermal 
current deviation, and the LSB size of the tuning DAC determines the tuning 
accuracy. Note that the LSB step size should be small enough to ensure the necessary 
linearity. With such DACs, it is possible to correct both negative and positive current 
deviations. A 1-bit ADC is used to ﬁnd the current error, which itself is already 
linear. Only the input deviation error of the current is inevitable, Ioffset [5, 76].

The input deviation error is corrected in two stages (Fig. 4.28) [5, 76]. During 
phase A (φA), the temporary current source, Itemp, is calibrated according to the 
reference current, Ibinref. 
Ioffset is also held; during phase B the reference current is applied to the input of 
the comparator to calibrate Itherm. Itherm is calibrated according to the temporary 
current Itemp while correcting the input deviation current of the comparator, Ioffset 
(4.13). 
φA : Itemp: ≈Ibinref - Ioffset, φB : Itherm: ≈Itemp: þ Ioffset ≈Ibinref
ð4:13Þ 
During the two stages of calibration, Ioffset is eliminated. The quantization error 
occurring during each cycle is controlled to reduce. For Itemp to be always set 
according to positive quantization error of Ibinref, a polarity check is performed 
after state V3, while a check is performed after state V6 to make sure that Itherm(i) 
is calibrated according to Itemp, but already with a negative quantization error. 
Such a sequence of operations allows to control the distribution of quantization 
error and reduce the post-calibration error [5]. In calibration process, the total current 
of the binary weighted current sources, plus an empty current source with one LSB 
weight, is selected as the reference current source for comparison. This approach 
practically eliminates the DNL error when converting from binary to thermometric 
codes. Then calibration is done only for thermometric branches of the current, since 
their effect on the linearity of the DAC is much more signiﬁcant compared to the 
binary branch currents. INL was measured before and after using the method. Before 
self-calibration, INL of the circuit >1.3 LSB, after calibration INL < 0.4 LSB

(Fig. 4.29)  [5]. The reason for the remaining nonlinearity is the non-calibrating 
binary part of the circuit.

Thus, the presented system of self-calibration of the linearity of the current DAC 
shows signiﬁcant results; in particular, it reduces the DNL and INL of the system to 
the extent that the missing codes in the system are absent. The nonlinearity error 
suppression range of the proposed number is rather small, and the system is effective 
in suppressing small linearity errors and therefore does not completely solve the 
problems presented.

4.1.9 
Existing Methods for Reducing Nonlinearity 
in Pipeline ADCs 
A high gain OpAmp with negative feedback allows for precise operation by reducing 
the nonlinearity present in non-feedback circuits. The gain of a simple feedback 
circuit can be calculated using the following formula: 
Acl = 
A 
1 þ Aβ = 1 
β
1 
1 þ 1=Aβ ,
ð4:14Þ 
where β is the feedback coefﬁcient and A is the gain of the OpAmp. For an ideal 
OpAmp, when the gain is inﬁnitely large, Acl is equal to 1/β [81]. However, Acl is 
smaller compared to 1/β. If  β is reduced, Acl can be equalized to the desired value. In 
pipeline ADCs, the residual voltage is ampliﬁed by feedback multiplier DACs 
(MDACs). The gain error caused by the small gain of the OpAmp can be corrected 
on the account of feedback coefﬁcient [81–90]. 
Figure 4.30 shows an MDAC with a calibration capacitor (Ccal), the size of the 
capacitance of which can be controlled by digital means. During the holding phase, 
eight capacitors (Ch) control the input. Both Ccal and feedback capacitance (Cf) are 
discharged, connecting to the DC voltage. During the ampliﬁcation stage, the 
sub-DAC’s digital output Cf is connected to either +Vref or -Vref. Through the 
error overlap method, Cf gets equal to 2Cs; therefore, it has an inter-cascade gain

equal to 4. Ch is enabled as a negative feedback capability and C as a positive 
feedback capability. Thus, the ampliﬁcation of MDAC is given by the following 
formula:

where Cp is parasitic capacitance and Voffset is the offset of OpAmp, and Av is 
inter-cascade gain of MDAC and is expressed by: 
Av = 
8Cs 
Cf þ 8CsþCf þCcalþCp

ð4:16Þ 
It is desirable that Av is equal to 4. By controlling Ccal, gain equal to the desired 
value of 4 can be obtained. The self-calibration functional diagram of pipeline ADC 
is shown in Fig. 4.31 [81]. 
The OpAmp of the last cascade MADC is assumed to have sufﬁcient gain to meet 
the sub-ADC requirements and provide sufﬁcient accuracy. Therefore, it does not 
need to be calibrated, it is assumed to be ideal. 
The calibration process starts from the penultimate MADC. 1/8 Vref voltage is 
injected into the calibrating MADC during the hold phase. 
During the ampliﬁcation stage, the feedback MADC ampliﬁes 1/8 Vref by Av 
times, and the ideal MADC holds the output of the calibrated MADC, then the ideal 
MADC subtracts 3/8 Vref voltage and also ampliﬁes it four times. If the gain of the 
MADC in calibration stage is 4, then the output voltage of the ideal MADC should 
be equal to 1/2 Vref. The output of the ideal MADC is compared to 1/2 Vref voltage

using a calibration comparator. The output of the comparator is then stored in a 
sequential approximation register which digitally controls Ccal capacitor size. After a 
few cycles, the calibration information stored in the register will set the gain of the 
MADC in calibration stage to 4. Then the previous MADC appears in the self-
calibration phase and so on until all MADCs are calibrated and the gain error is 
minimized. Fifty-six cycles of the self-calibration process are needed to calibrate 
three MADCs. The entire self-calibration process takes 168 cycles [81, 91–99]. In 
Eq. 4.15 (8Cs + Cf + Ccal + Cp) Voffset/ 8Сs component that occurs due to offset error 
of the OpAmp does not hinder the operation of the circuit because it is neutralized 
due to the application of the overlap method. Ideal MADCs work as analog signal 
converters that amplify the signal and give a stabilized value at the output. The 
deviation voltage of the OpAmp leads to a deviation of the voltage value at the 
output, which then serves an input to the other cascades and can lead to an error in 
self-calibration process. The input deviation error is stored in a register so that the 
deviation error can be reduced. Analog self-calibration methods usually require 
accurate reference sources. Cs in the ﬁrst MADC is designed to have less than 
0.1% deviation, and 1/8 Vref input voltage can be generated by the MADC if it is 
used as a switching capacitor as shown in Fig. 4.32. The inputs of the MADC 
in calibration stage are connected to +Vref, -Vref, and Vgnd with 4Cs, 3Cs, and Cs 
capacitors, respectively; thus, the total input voltage is equal to 1/8 Vref [81, 100– 
109]. 
4.1

191
Fig. 4.31 Functional diagram of pipeline ADC self-calibration 
To use the offset hold method, the offset of the OpAmp is held when the ampliﬁer 
is in feedback. During the ampliﬁcation phase +Vref and -Vref are connected to the 
input with 4Cs capacitors to get zero voltage (Fig. 4.33). Cf and Ccal are connected 
to the positive and negative outputs of the OpAmp, respectively. For an ideal 
MADC, all 8Cs capacitors store the initial MADC output in the hold phase 
(Fig. 4.34). The offset of the OpAmp is also stored. Then, in the ampliﬁcation 
phase, +Vref, -Vref, and Vgrnd are connected to the input with 5Cs, 2Cs, and Cs 
capacitors, together generating 3/8 Vref voltage (Fig. 4.35). The residual voltage is 
ampliﬁed by a feedback circuit [81]. 
Before the calibration process, the INL and DNL of the circuit are 1.7/-1.0 LSB 
and + 15.6/-15.2 LSB, respectively. After calibration, INL and DNL are equal to 
0.7/-0.6 LSB and 0.8/-0.9 LSB, respectively (Fig. 4.36)  [81].

Thus, the presented self-calibration linearization reduction method signiﬁcantly 
reduces the nonlinearity of pipeline ADC by reducing the INL and DNL errors to 
such values that missing loss is not observed experimentally. However, the imple-
mentation of the method presupposes the presence of such elements in the system, 
the linear parameters of which are ideal, and their implementation is practically very 
difﬁcult, if not impossible. Therefore, the question of developing other means 
remains relevant.

Principles to Improve the Linearity of Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Self-Calibration 
The existing means and approaches for improving the linearity of ADCs and DACs 
with self-calibration do not fully meet currently formed requirements. Therefore, the 
development of new means and solutions is relevant. Thus, the following principles 
are proposed:

194
4
Methods to Improve Linearity of Signal’s Analog-to-Digital Conversion. . .
1. Introduce feedback in ﬂash ADC, which will reduce the offset error of common 
comparators by means of auxiliary DACs, FSM, and preampliﬁer. This will allow 
to reduce the nonlinearity of the whole system. 
2. Add a feedback system to the current DAC, which, by comparing the currents of 
the current sources with a larger current source deviating less from the nominal 
one, will allow to calibrate the currents of the latter, thus making it possible to 
reduce the nonlinearity of the DAC. 
3. Introduce an ampliﬁer offset error system in pipeline ADC, which will allow to 
reduce the nonlinearity of the latter, thus increasing the linearity of ADC. 
The mentioned principles will allow to reduce the errors, made in manufacturing 
process and, therefore, to increase yield percentage of working circuits, reducing 
manufacturing costs. 
4.2 
Conclusions 
1. Deterioration of operating parameters in digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital 
converters leads to an unacceptable increase in nonlinearity errors. Taking into 
account the impossibility of eliminating deviations in the parameters of integrated 
circuits of the speciﬁed class after the end of manufacturing process, the devel-
opment of embedded self-calibration deviation correction systems has become 
important at present. 
2. The analysis of the existing means of improving the linearity of analog-to-digital 
conversion by self-calibration shows that, although an attempt was made to 
eliminate the main causes of offsets and ampliﬁcation errors, the degree of 
correction of deviations does not meet modern requirements. For this reason, it 
became necessary to develop new means of building embedded systems of 
correction of deviations with self-calibration. 
3. Principles of development of means for improving the linearity of the analog-to-
digital conversion with self-calibration are proposed, which, unlike the known 
solutions, are more effective from the point of view of reducing the nonlinearity. 
Systems with built-in feedback allow to ensure a sufﬁcient reduction of deviated 
parameters in case of an increase in the area occupied on the die and the 
calibration time within the permissible limits.

Methods of Improving the Linearity of Signal’s 
Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Self-Calibration 
4.3.1 
Method of Reducing the Nonlinearity 
with Self-Calibration by Correcting the Offset Error 
of Comparators in Flash Analog-to-Digital Converters 
From the discussion in Sect. 4.1 it follows that the existing measures do not 
completely satisfy and do not solve the existing problems, and even if they solve 
them partially, they require large-scale resources in terms of area and power. 
The self-calibration ﬂash ADC linearity improvement method discussed in Sect. 
4.1 required large area and, despite that, did not solve certain problems, such as the 
preampliﬁer offset problem, which also leads to linearity degradation. The discussed 
ﬂash ADC circuit largely solved the accuracy issue of reference voltages by 
matching them to the expected voltage values, using multiple components in the 
feedback circuit such as registers, ideal code generators, error detectors, as well as 
discrete linear elements for matching, such as the debug input generator. To obtain 
reference voltages and reduce the effect of offset error, a large number of pre-
ampliﬁers are used, which in turn have offset error and therefore increase the 
nonlinearity of the overall system. 
In order to reduce the drawbacks listed above, a method is proposed, for the 
implementation of which a traditional 8-bit ﬂash ADC is used. A ﬂash ADC uses a 
voltage divider with linear resistors to obtain reference voltages [110–118]. Then the 
reference voltages are applied to the inputs of comparators, where they are compared 
with the input signal, and when the reference voltage coincides with the value of the 
input signal, there is a corresponding digital signal at the output of the comparator 
(Fig. 4.37). The code received at the output of the comparators is thermometric; that 
is why a thermometric-to-unary code converter is connected at the output. Flash 
ADC contains 2n - 1 comparators (Fig. 4.38). The comparator is a simple telescopic 
ampliﬁer with high gain, whose output cascade is a common-source single-cascade 
ampliﬁer [119]. As it was mentioned in Sect. 4.1, due to the offset error of ampliﬁers, 
the nonlinearity in the circuit increases and is the main cause of the nonlinearity. This 
problem was not completely solved in the past, but the consequences of the error 
were corrected, which did not give the desired result. 
A circuit (Fig. 4.39) was proposed to reduce the offset error of the comparator, the 
main idea of which is to use one preampliﬁer at the input of the comparator instead of 
multiple preampliﬁers, which will reduce the input offset error of the comparator 
through feedback [119]. 
The offset error correction circuit of the comparator has two operating modes: 
calibration and operating. In the calibration mode, the inputs of the circuit are 
connected together by means of a switch. Calibration is done using calibration 
DACs and a successive approximation algorithm. The algorithm is implemented 
using FSM [119].

Calibration DAC consists of binary weight current sources to which a register is 
connected (Fig. 4.40). The register allows to save the current values obtained as a 
result of calibration. During the calibration stage with calibration DACs, the voltage 
at the output of the preampliﬁer is established, in the case of which the input offset of 
the comparator is reduced as much as the calibration DAC allows. Then the circuit is

brought to the actual operating mode, where the input offset is reduced. The FSM is 
connected to the next comparator and the same process is performed until the offset 
error of all comparators is reduced to possible minimum. Thus, the linearity of the 
overall system increases. Two types of preampliﬁers are used because there is a wide 
voltage range in the system. The presented circuit is used for voltages from Vref to

Fig. 4.43 DNL before calibration 
In the calibration DAC, the current values of the current sources are set to 
neutralizing the maximum possible offset value, with an added 10% margin. 
INL and DNL measurements were taken before (Figs. 4.43 and 4.44) and after 
(Figs. 4.45 and 4.46) calibration to evaluate the effectiveness of calibration. INL 
decreased by about 70% and DNL by 73%. The nonlinearity error is less than 1 LSB; 
therefore, no missing code was observed [119]. 
The presented simulation results correspond to the worst case with the largest 
deviation in the manufacturing process, and the correction of the operating param-
eters was performed in the speciﬁed case. The complete results of DNL and INL are 
given in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. 
The layout of the designed ﬂash ADC is presented in Fig. 4.47. 
An external clock signal was used for FSM switching. Correction and equaliza-
tion of duty cycle of the clock signal to the nominal value of 50% was made, so that it 
does not cause additional inaccuracies. The correction was made using duty cycle 
corrector (DCC) (Fig. 4.48) [120]. 
The DCC consists of a duty cycle detector (DCD), a duty cycle regulator (DCR), 
and a CML-CMOS buffer. Having received the control signal Vc, the DCR equalizes 
the constant voltage components of the input signals due to the negative feedback. 
DCD detects the deviation of CMOS signals from the average value. Then the DCR 
calibrates the duty cycle of the signal, having at the output a clock signal with a duty 
cycle close to the nominal, but not fully differential (Fig. 4.49). Then it brings 
CML-CMOS signal into full differential form. It consists of a differential ampliﬁer, 
the inputs of which are connected to capacitors to ﬁlter the constant component of

components of the voltage at the input to the CML-CMOS buffer. The CML-CMOS 
buffer (Fig. 4.50) is necessary to obtain a fully differential signal [120].

One of the constituent parts of the DCD is the differential ampliﬁer, which 
ensures the stability of the circuit with feedback, the high operating frequency, and 
the large-scale duty cycle correction layer. A schematic view of the DCD is shown in 
Fig. 4.51 [120]. 
As shown in Fig. 4.51, DCD contains a coupled circuit that improves the 
accuracy and performance of the circuit. Then the differential ampliﬁer and ﬁlters 
provide the control voltages. The control voltages are connected to the DCR by 
feedback and calibrate the duty cycle until it is as close to the nominal value as 
possible [120].

Thus, duty cycle, close to the nominal, is obtained, and therefore, the clock signal 
does not cause an error in the operation of the circuit. A neg-C circuit was used to 
reduce parasitic capacitances and their effects [121]. 
Figures 4.52 and 4.53 show power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and common

providing DNL and INL less than 1 LSB, due to which no missing loss is observed. 
Compared to previous approaches, the efﬁciency of the system is higher. The 
proposed method has 12% higher calibration time.

4.3.2 
Method of Reducing the Nonlinearity 
with Self-Calibration by Correcting the Current 
Deviation Error of Current Sources in Current 
Digital-to-Analog Converters 
As discussed in Sect. 4.1, current source mismatches in current DACs cause the 
DAC transfer function to be nonlinear. In order to solve the problem, in most of the 
existing circuits, a comparison is made with the calibrated current and the total 
currents of all the binary currents. As a result of comparison, the value of the 
calibrated thermometric current source is equalized to the total current of binary 
weighted current sources. The idea of this method is that the currents of all thermo-
metric branches are equal to the nominal value, and the transfer function is more 
monotonous in the thermometric part. The basis of the method is the idea that the 
deviations of separate binary weight current sources in different directions lead to the 
fact that the value of the total current is close to the nominal, ideal value of the 
thermometric current. But the circuit has a drawback [17]. In case that the deviations 
of binary weighted transistors are in one direction, the current deviation is also in one 
direction, and therefore a deviation from nominal occurs. A method was proposed to 
avoid the problem (Fig. 4.54). 
It is known that the larger physical dimensions of the electrical component, the 
smaller the deviation of its electrical parameters from the nominal. Taking into 
account the above, it is possible to use a large-scale transistor as a reference current 
source, the current of which will be equal to the nominal value, and it will itself be 
compared with the currents of thermometric branches, and according to its current, 
the correction of the current of the thermometric branches will be made. Monte Carlo 
simulations were performed to evaluate the current deviations of binary weighted 
transistors and a single large current source (Figs. 4.55 and 4.56) [17]. 
The current of the large current source deviates from the nominal by ±10%, and 
the total current of the binary weight transistors—±25%; therefore, in the process of
Fig. 4.54 Characteristic of 
the method

calibrating the thermometric current sources, a large-scale transistor should be used 
as a reference current, and not the total current of binary weight transistors. There 
will be an increase in linearity, in particular an improvement of DNL and INL in the 
thermometric part. Compared to the previous method, the INL error will be smaller, 
because the current of thermometric branches will be less deviated from the nominal 
value, which follows from the presented results [17].

The comparison and equalization between currents is performed using a 1-bit 
ADC and FSM, in which the FSM algorithm represents a successive approximation 
algorithm. A 1-bit ADC is itself already linear and therefore is not a source of 
nonlinearity. In addition, to calibrate the weights of the currents, current calibration 
DACs are connected to thermometric branches, which, being in feedback with the

To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a comparison was made with the 
previous method. Nonlinearity parameters INL and DNL were measured (Tables 4.4 
and 4.5). The results and the layout of DAC are shown in Figs. 4.58, 4.59, 4.60, 4.61, 
and 4.62 [17]. 
Thus, an embedded means of increasing the linearity of the current DAC was 
proposed. The embedded system compares the values of the current sources of the 
current DAC with the nominal current and performs current matching through 
feedback. As a result of current matching, the linearity of the current DAC increases. 
The comparison was made with a large current source, the current of which does not

Means of Reducing System Nonlinearity 
with Self-Calibration by Increasing the Linearity 
of Comparators in Pipeline Analog-to-Digital 
Converters 
As discussed in Sect. 4.1, the three main causes of nonlinearity in pipeline ADCs are 
ampliﬁer gain error, ampliﬁer offset error, and nonlinearity in sub-DACs or ADCs. 
Basically, in the previous works the ampliﬁcation error of the ampliﬁers was 
corrected, but the other two were neglected; however, quite signiﬁcant results were 
obtained. The ampliﬁers are designed with high precision and their frequency 
parameters are mainly deviated by parasitic capacitances, the effect of which is 
reduced by the negative capacitance circuit [61, 121]. 
In the proposed method, the offset error of the ampliﬁers undergoing calibration 
is corrected by feedback (Fig. 4.63). 
Correction of offset error is performed in two stages by means of switches. 
During the ﬁrst stage, g1 and g2 are connected to the capacitor, and g3 disconnects 
the input from the output. The input offset (4.17) is established on the capacitor.

4.3
Methods of Improving the Linearity of Signal’s Analog-to-Digital. . .
211
Fig. 4.64 Application of offset correction method in pipeline ADC 
Vc = 
A 
A þ 1 Voffset
ð4:17Þ 
During the second stage, g3 is connected to the capacitor, and g1 and g2 are 
disconnected from the capacitor. Thus, when a signal is applied to the input of the 
ampliﬁer, Vc voltage on the capacitor is added to it, which is equal to the input offset. 
Therefore, the offset error is eliminated and the linearity of the ampliﬁer is increased. 
The method is applicable to all cascade ampliﬁers (Fig. 4.64). 
As a result of applying the method, the linearity of pipeline ADC will increase. 
After applying the method, simulations were performed. Measurements of INL and 
DNL were made before (Figs. 4.65 and 4.66) and after (Figs. 4.67 and 4.68) 
application of the method. The system reduces the nonlinearity of the ADC by 
approximately 2.5 times (Table 4.6). 
Thus, a means of improving the linearity of pipeline ADC with self-calibration 
has been developed. By reducing the system, the offset error of the ampliﬁers 
increases the linearity of the overall system. The implementation of the tool was 
carried out with the introduction of as few auxiliary elements as possible, and 
compared to the existing solutions, it has greater efﬁciency, and less area is required 
for the implementation of the method. This method is also universal and can be used 
in pipeline ADCs with different structures with minimal modiﬁcations. The system 
effectively reduces the nonlinearity of the ADC by about 2.5 times. Compared to the 
previous method, it does not reduce the gain error.

Conclusion 
1. Principles of development of means for improving the linearity of analog-to-
digital conversion with self-calibration have been proposed, which, unlike the 
known solutions, are more effective in terms of reducing nonlinearity. Systems 
with built-in feedback allow to ensure a sufﬁcient reduction of deviated param-
eters in case of an increase in the area occupied on the die and calibration time 
within the permissible limits. 
2. An integrated system for improvement of the linearity of a ﬂash analog-to-digital 
converter with self-calibration has been proposed, in which, due to the inclusion 
of a feedback preampliﬁer and auxiliary digital-to-analog converters for calibra-
tion, the nonlinearity parameters were reduced approximately three times, at the 
expense of only 12% increase in calibration time. 
3. An integrated system for improving the linearity of a digital-to-analog converter 
with self-calibration has been proposed, in which, due to the comparison and 
calibration of currents of power sources, the nonlinearity parameters were 
reduced by 20–25%, in the case of an increase of only 5% of the occupied area. 
4. A means of improving the linearity of a pipeline analog-to-digital converter with 
self-calibration has been proposed, in which, due to the implementation of the 
ampliﬁer offset error reduction system, the nonlinearity parameters were reduced 
approximately 2.5 times. Compared to the previously existing method, the gain 
error does not decrease.

Importance of Design Means for High-performance 
Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits 
Currently, in the period of development of high-performance computing systems, 
the number of multi-core integrated circuits (ICs), which is vital in these systems, is 
constantly increasing [1]. The number of transistors used in ICs and logarithmic 
dependence in different periods (Fig. 5.1) [2] increases by a nonlinear law. 
The development of ICs is progressing according to Moore’s law [3]. With each 
change in the technological process, the number of transistors in ICs is doubled, and 
the power consumption is maintained on the account of reducing the supply voltage. 
However, it is not possible to constantly reduce it in order to limit the increase of the 
leakage current of transistors [4]. And because of these problems, it became neces-
sary to introduce the possibility of parallelism of operations performed through IC in 
order to ensure the growth of computing performance [5–8]. 
On the other hand, the performance of processor systems directly depends on 
temperature and power consumption [9]. In order to limit the dissipating thermal 
energy that can be turned off, as well as the temperature increase as a result, energy 
consumption control mechanisms are used, the principle of which is the limitation of 
the maximum frequency of IC [10]. The latter causes a drop in performance [11]. To 
overcome this limitation, multi-core central processor units (CPUs) were created, 
which made it possible to have more than one computing core in one IC [12]. Over 
the years, since the number of IC cores, power consumption, and frequency changes 
(Fig. 5.2) [2], when the maximum frequency value in ICs approached 4–5 GHz, and 
the power consumption reached 100–150 W, multi-cores began to be designed.

Single-core CPUs are not scalable from an architectural perspective. It is not 
possible to increase performance along with power consumption. However, multi-
core architectures can be expanded up simply by increasing the number of cores. 
This is also conﬁrmed by Polak’s principle [13], according to which the performance 
of the core changes according to the square law depending on the complexity of the 
implementation. Along with the complexity of the implementation, the power 
consumption and core area increase. Multi-core system performance increase 
(MSPI) is limited by the percentage of the sequential program in the total one and 
is determined by the following formula [14]:

5.1
General Issues of Designing Means for High-performance. . .
223
MSPI = 
1 
seq% þ 1 - seq%
ð
Þ=N
ð
Þ
ð5:1Þ 
where N is the number of cores. The higher the percentage of the sequential program 
in the total one, the lower the MSPI saturates, depending on the number of cores. 
As mentioned above, multi-core CPUs also provide parallelism at the instruction 
execution level. For example, a processor consisting of two cores in the case of the 
same frequency can provide up to twice higher performance compared to a single-
core processor [15, 16]. Currently, single-core processors are used only in systems 
where there is no need for high computing power. 
The architectures of multi-core processors in turn have certain limitations. Inter-
connection logic circuits in processors limit the bandwidth of data transfer between 
cores. The larger the number of cores, the larger interconnection circuit is needed 
to ensure the connection between them [17, 18]. For example, in order to provide 
more than eight cores in one IC, one needs to have a network in IC instead of 
interconnection [19]. 
There are two types of multi-core ICs. The ﬁrst are processors that have several 
cores and a ﬁrst- or second-level shared cache memory [20]. The above examples 
belong to this class. The second is those ICs where there are hundreds or thousands 
of cores that are logically connected to each other through a network [21]. In these 
systems, groups of several cells can form clusters. Clusters usually consist of one or 
more cores, and these cores have shared memory. An example of such ICs is graphs 
processor units (GPUs) [22]. GPUs are used to display an image on a monitor by 
processing parallel three-dimensional objects. In order to solve this problem, GPUs 
are designed with small computing cores. These cores are not as compatible as 
processors, but enable the programmer to perform mathematical calculations and 
perform them in parallel [23]. Current GPUs include tens of thousands of cores. 
However, such systems also have certain limitations. Here, all cores are identical and 
perform the same type of operations. 
Along with all this, there is a limit to the number of concurrently operating cores 
[24]. When all cores are in active mode at the same time, the power consumption of 
IC increases signiﬁcantly [25]. Its increase leads to such temperature values, in 
which the efﬁciency of IC operation decreases. This problem is solved by limiting 
the number of concurrently active cores or by reducing the operating frequency. In 
both cases, IC performance decreases. 
One of the existing solutions to these limitations as problems is the application of 
heterogeneous systems, when computing cores of different types and with instruc-
tions or data parallelism are used [26]. A heterogeneous IC can consist of cores with 
the same instruction set but different microarchitectures, or cores with different 
instruction sets, or cores-accelerators that do not have an instruction set [27]. And 
special-purpose cores allow to ensure higher performance compared to compatible 
cores at the same power cost. Thus, when performing calculations using heteroge-
neous ICs, it is possible to achieve greater productivity while maintaining power 
consumption, or in the case of a lower value of the latter, while maintaining 
performance.

Heterogeneous systems are used in telecommunications, space devices, 
cryptocurrency computing, and other ﬁelds. For example, for hashing calculations 
of cryptocurrencies, such systems are used, which make it possible to perform the 
calculations in parallel [28]. In computers, in order to increase the performance of 
parallel calculations, programmers use computing power of GPUs. The presented 
graph (Fig. 5.3) shows the increase in performance when applying a heterogeneous 
system in molecule simulation applications [29]. 
Simulation was performed on a network of parallel processors (Fortran CPU) and 
through a heterogeneous system (CPU/GPU). As seen from the dependence of the 
number of molecules and the simulation time (Fig. 5.4), its time is reduced by 
87 times when performing simulation through a heterogeneous system [29].

In summary, the factors that cause the demand for the design of heterogeneous 
ICs can be mentioned. 
Flexible architecture. Heterogeneous ICs are multi-core computing systems; for the 
implementation of which it is necessary to design special-purpose and compatible 
cores. Compatible cores will enable complex algorithms to be implemented at the 
programming level, and special-purpose cores for low-power and high-
performance calculations. Optimal resource allocation will ensure maximum 
performance. 
Compatibility and reduction of power consumption. As mentioned above, improving 
compatibility leads to increase in power consumption. For this reason, heteroge-
neous ICs are used to relieve the burden of cores in VLSI. The improvement of 
design problems of the latter and the availability of ﬂexible architecture contrib-
ute to the reduction of IC compatibility and the complexity of the implementation 
of cores, which in turn leads to the reduction of power consumption. 
Reduction of design time. The design of special ICs, depending on the ﬁeld of 
application, may have different features due to the presence of different comput-
ing nodes and interfaces. And with a ﬂexible architectural heterogeneous IC 
design tool, design time can be signiﬁcantly reduced by using common interfaces 
and conﬁgurable components. 
Structure of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits 
There are four types of processor systems according to Michael Flynn’s classiﬁca-
tion [30]:
•
Single instruction, single data (SISD)
•
Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD)
•
Multiple instruction, single data (MISD)
•
Multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) 
SISD—systems with this architecture consist of one single-core processor that 
executes one instruction at a time, and data is read from one memory [31]. The SISD 
architecture (Fig. 5.5) corresponds to Von Neumann architecture. Such architectures 
have parameters for executing asynchronous instructions [32]. Pipelined or 
superscalar processors are implemented with SISD architecture. Instructions are 
received from the control unit, decoded and executed by the processor, which 
reads the data, processes it according to the instruction, and records it in memory. 
Superscalar processors are CPUs with instruction-level parallelism. Unlike the 
classic Von Neumann architecture, which can execute one instruction during one 
period of the clock signal, superscalar processors have the ability to execute more 
than one instruction in one clock cycle [33]. This is done in the CPU by integrating 
more than one instruction execution units, the operation of which is independent of 
each other and in parallel. It is important to note that each instruction execution unit 
is not a separate processor. The single-core superscalar processor belongs to the 
SISD class [34].

Fig. 5.5 SISD architecture 
Fig. 5.6 Execution of superscalar processor instructions 
As seen from the instruction execution graph of a single-core superscalar proces-
sor consisting of two instruction execution units over time (Fig. 5.6), instruction 
execution is pipelined and consists of several stages. These stages are instruction 
fetch (IF), instruction decoding (ID), instruction execution (IE), memory access 
(MA), and data writeback (DWB). 
SISD architectures are now being used in microprocessor systems, where power 
consumption requirements take priority over performance. This architecture is quite 
simple in terms of implementation, which makes it cheap to manufacture, but 
uncompetitive in terms of performance compared to other architectures [35]. 
SIMD—CPUs designed with this architecture execute the same instruction by 
applying the operation corresponding to the instruction on multiple data. Data is 
divided into streams here. Instructions are executed in parallel or sequentially. In 
order to use instructions in parallel, it is necessary to have many processor nodes in a 
given processor system [36]. Sequential instruction execution is also pipelined, as in 
the case of SISD. Circuits designed with this architecture are divided into two 
groups:

5.1
General Issues of Designing Means for High-performance. . .
227
•
Vector processor (VP).
•
Pipelined SIMD processor (PSP). 
VPs contain multiple cores, and each core has its own cache memory and register 
ﬁle (Fig. 5.7) [37]. Each VP core is compatible and capable of running different 
instructions. Instructions are executed in parallel. The number of simultaneous 
instructions is limited by the number of cores. The structure of one core of VP is 
presented in Fig. 5.7 [38]. 
The components of the VP core are algebraic logic unit (ALU), central control 
unit (CCU), and cache memory and register ﬁle (RF). CCU is doing instruction 
fetch, decoding, and managing data ﬂow. Cache memory is an intermediate unit 
between RF and system memory (RAM). The structure of VP consisting of four 
cores is presented in Fig. 5.8 [39]. 
It can be seen from the diagram that the same instruction is sent to all VP cores 
(VPC) at the same time, and the processed data is read from the data array in parallel. 
The execution of the below assembly program over time using VP is presented in 
Fig. 5.9 [38].

core VP

instructions by quad-core 
pipelined SIMD processor 
As it can be seen, different cores execute the same instruction at the same time. 
The same instruction set is executed in a different way through pipelined SIMD 
processor. Unlike VP, pipelined SIMD processor cores are not mutually exclusive, 
and each core executes one unique instruction. Execution of the above-mentioned 
program by pipelined SIMD processor [38] is presented in Fig. 5.10. 
As shown, with pipelined SIMD processor, the instructions are executed sequen-
tially, and unlike VP, the same instructions are executed in the same core, different 
instructions are executed at the same time. 
The advantage of the pipelined SIMD processor architecture compared to VP is 
that the cores are not compatible and execute unique instructions, due to which they 
are simpler from a structural point of view, occupy small area, and have low power 
consumption. To increase the performance of the pipelined SIMD processor, the 
number of cores executing the same instructions is increased [40]. 
SIMD architectures are used in GPU ICs, video processing applications, machine 
learning, as well as heterogeneous ICs [41]. 
ICs with the MISD architecture execute different instructions on the same data. 
They are not widely used in consumer electronics and are mainly used in space 
systems where the probability of errors is high and the same processing is performed 
by more than one core [42]. The structure of the MISD processor is presented in 
Fig. 5.11 which is done for the purpose that the failure of one circuit in space devices 
does not affect the overall system. 
Processors with the MIMD structure consist of compatible cores, each of which in 
turn has a separate instruction array and data array. Due to their structure, these ICs 
provide maximum performance, but in other parameters they are inferior to all the

above-mentioned architectures [43]. As seen from the MIMD structure (Fig. 5.12), it 
consists of independent cores that receive independent instructions and perform 
operations based on an independent data stream or data stream in shared 
memory [44].

computers, and SoCs of smartphones. They are suitable for multi-ﬂow applications 
and data-intensive tasks [35]. 
Design Issues of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits 
The most important issues for the design of heterogeneous ICs are:
•
Implementation of a ﬂexible or conﬁgurable architecture
•
Data transfer issues between clock domains
•
Implementation of data transfer interfaces 
The ﬁrst step in the design of heterogeneous ICs is the choice of architecture. It 
exclusively depends on the ﬁeld of application of the given heterogeneous IC, in

particular, on the modern computing requirements in that ﬁeld. For example, net-
work devices are mainly smart systems that require processing of data stream 
supplied by sensors but have very strict requirements in terms of power consump-
tion. Here, power consumption is preferred over the above requirements. It is 
desirable to choose such an architecture, which will consist of one or more ASIP 
cores [45]. In another example, in the case of video processing performed in cloud 
systems, the advantage is given to performance requirements, because these systems 
have constant power supply and external cooling devices [46]. In order to obtain 
maximum performance, it is advised to choose an architecture that provides high 
parallelism at the data and instruction level. In conclusion, the choice of architecture 
strongly depends on the ﬁeld of application, and in order to reduce the design time, 
there is a need to create a software environment that will enable the generation of a 
heterogeneous IC with the required architecture from the existing design tools. In 
those design means, depending on technical requirements, it is necessary to realize 
the optimal data ﬂow and ensure the interconnections between the components with 
appropriate interfaces [47]. 
230

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Another important task is to meet power consumption requirements. For this, it is 
necessary that the implemented IC has low power consumption modes, when the 
main computing cores are in an inactive state, and the central control unit, whether 
automatic or CPU, should have a wide operating frequency range. By lowering the 
frequency, the supply voltage and therefore the power consumption can be reduced. 
In addition to low-power operating modes, a heterogeneous IC should have a 
low-performance mode, when both cores and computing nodes operate at low 
frequencies, which also leads to a decrease in power consumption [48]. 
Based on the requirements of power consumption and the characteristics of the 
structure of heterogeneous ICs, an important design issue is to ensure uninterrupted 
and as fast as possible data transfer between domains that are asynchronous to each 
other. Computing cores can have different operating frequencies. 
Thus, one of the most relevant problems of modern IC creation is the develop-
ment of heterogeneous IC system design tools to signiﬁcantly improve their main 
parameters and shorten the design period. 
5.1.2 
Current State and Issues of Design Means 
for High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated 
Circuits 
The demand for designing high-performance heterogeneous integrated circuits is 
increasing sharply. This growth is due to the increase in the amount of data in various 
ﬁelds. The number of pixels in camera matrices increases with the development of 
technological processes, and in the ﬁeld of video processing, the data of each pixel 
needs to be processed. Therefore, as the number of pixels increases, so does the 
amount of data that must be processed, passing that data through various digital logic

ﬁlters, converting one image representation format to another, and so on. The 
processing of that data involves performing mathematical operations on the pixel 
data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, matrix multiplication, 
etc. These operations are expensive in terms of power consumption and require 
parallel processing of video image to be able to meet today’s strict requirements 
[49]. Currently, IC systems of mobile phones are integrating ASICs to perform video 
processing. As mentioned above, the increase in the amount of data requires the 
development of tools for designing heterogeneous architectures. 
5.1
General Issues of Designing Means for High-performance. . .
231
An inseparable part of heterogeneous architectures are control units of data 
transfer interfaces. These interfaces can be used both for data transfer between 
internal nodes and between devices externally connected to ICs. One of the widely 
used interfaces is universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) [50]. It is 
designed to transfer data between external devices. UART interface is used in such 
devices in which data transfer speed does not play a primary role [51]. However, this 
interface is not ﬂexible in terms of application. The operating frequency is ﬁxed and 
does not change over time. Basically, devices equipped with UART interface are 
used with default settings and are not subject to change. Such interfaces are used to 
exchange data between control registers in heterogeneous ICs (and not only) [52]. 
Each processor node in computer systems must be connected to the shared system 
memory through a common switch. The connection between system memory and 
heterogeneous IC should be optimized without additional applications and efﬁ-
ciently. In modern ICs, the connection between RAM and other constituent nodes 
is provided by the AMBA AXI interface [53]. 
In heterogeneous ICs, each node has its own external interfaces, and depending 
on the operating mode, their frequencies are different, and clock signals are asyn-
chronous [54]. Circuits with asynchronous clock signals form asynchronous clock 
domains, between which the data transfer must be carried out through synchronizers. 
Synchronizers are digital circuits that provide lossless data transfer from one clock 
domain to another but cause additional delay. When using a classical synchronizer, 
this delay increases with the reduction of technological process and the increase of 
the frequency in IC which leads to a decrease in data throughput and 
performance [55]. 
Data Transfer Problems Between Component Parts in High-performance 
Heterogeneous ICs 
Heterogeneous ICs have many control units, the operating mode of which is based 
on the values of their control registers. As mentioned above, with the increase in the 
number of cores in heterogeneous ICs, their structure becomes more complicated, as 
the logic circuit of the interconnect increases. Part of it is the interfaces providing 
data transfer between cores and the programming of control registers. Programming 
of control registers is not a frequent process and is not performed in active operating 
mode. It is performed once after the circuit is released or before entering or exiting 
low power mode. However, even in these problems, modern ICs implement parallel

interfaces with 32-bit resolution, which occupy a large area on the die. It is 
recommended to use UART interface for programming the control registers in ICs, 
through which only one bit is needed for one-way data transfer [56]. It is widely used 
for data transfer between different devices [57].

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
A UART is a computing device hub designed to communicate with other digital 
devices. A node transmits data sequentially. 
The parameters that characterize the UART are:
•
Full bidirectional data exchange (sequential transmission and reception of data 
independently of each other)
•
Asynchronous data exchanges
•
Large performance range
•
Provision of 5-, 6-, 7-, and 8-bit long packets
•
Provision of 1 or 2 “end” bits
•
Provision of even or odd parity bit
•
Data loss detection
•
Packet structure mismatch error detection
•
Protection against false “start” bit 
The UART interconnection circuit is presented in Fig. 5.13, where RX is the 
receiver and TX is the transmitter [58]. 
In the structure of the presented UART controller, two main constituent parts are 
divided by dotted lines: transmitter and receiver (Fig. 5.14). And the control registers 
are common. The receiver consists of a node that detects the negative edge of the 
voltage on the UART RX line; a clock signal generator, the frequency of which is 
determined by the value written in control registers; a module that reads 1 bit; a 
control block; and an RX memory for temporarily storing the received data. The 
transmitter consists of a TX memory that temporarily stores the data to be sent; a 
node that generates the clock signal, which is structurally similar to the 
corresponding node of the receiver; and a control logic node that controls the

UART TX line. The transmitter supports the same packet format as the transmitter 
and can detect packet structure error, data loss error, and parity bit error.

233
Fig. 5.14 Structure of UART controllers 
The clock signal generators of the receiver and the transmitter do not differ from 
each other in structure. The only difference is the different control signals. In other 
words, these nodes work independently of each other, which ensures full two-way 
data ﬂow. 
The clock signal generator represents a counter, the maximum value of which 
determines the corresponding output of the control register. Depending on this value, 
the maximum value of the counter changes, and when it is reached, the counter resets 
to zero. The operating frequency of the UART is determined by the maximum value 
of this counter. In terms of frequency selection, the UART controller has 20 operat-
ing states.

Fig. 5.15 UART packet structure 
The operating states of the UART controller and performance, corresponding to 
these states, the maximum value of the clock signal generator counter, corresponding 
to each state are presented in Table 5.1. 
A single transaction packet consists of a single symbol consisting of eight data 
bits and matching bits (“start” and “end”). The packet may also contain a redundant 
parity bit. The UART accepts packets with all possible options of parameters listed 
below as true:
•
1 “start” bit
•
Data bit 5, 6, 7, or 8
•
Odd or even parity bit or its absence
•
1, 1.5, or 2 “end” bit 
The packet begins with the “start” bit, followed by the least signiﬁcant data bit. 
After that, the remaining data bits are transmitted sequentially, up to a maximum of 
eight, ending with the most signiﬁcant bit. If the parity bit is present in the packet, the 
data bits are followed by the parity bit, followed by the “end” bit. When a complete 
packet is sent, it may be immediately followed by a new packet, or a wait state will 
be established on the line. All possible packet formats are depicted in Fig. 5.15. Bits 
in square brackets may be present or vice versa [58].
•
St—“start” bit, logical “0”
•
(n)—data bits (5–8 bits)
•
P—parity bit (even or odd)
•
Sp—“end” bit, always logical “1”
•
IDLE—standby state, always logical “1”

5.1
General Issues of Designing Means for High-performance. . .
235
Packet formats are also determined by control registers. 
As seen in the packet, there is a parity bit. The parity bit is calculated as follows: 
XOR logic operation is performed with all data bits, XOR logic operation is also 
performed with the obtained with logic 1 or 0 value. It depends on the value of the 
control registers. The parity bit depending on the data bits is calculated by the 
following formulas: 
Peven = dn - 1  . . .  d2  d1  d0  0 
Peven = dn - 1  . . .  d2  d1  d0  0
ð5:2Þ 
In (5.2), Peven—parity bit is calculated by logical 0; Podd—parity bit is calculated 
by logical 1; and dn is the n-th bit of data. 
If a parity bit is active in the packet, it is inserted between the last data bit and the 
ﬁrst “end” bit. 
Although the UART interface is widely used to transfer data between different 
devices, it has some drawbacks. The data transfer speed is limited to 1 Mbps and 
does not have enough ﬂexibility. 
Data Transmission Problems Between Clock Domains 
in High-performance Heterogeneous ICs 
Modern heterogeneous ICs have different external interfaces [59]. Each external 
interface is synchronous, consisting of data bits, control bits, and clock signals 
[60]. Each interface is formed by its own clock domain. Data transfer from one 
clock domain to another is characterized by clock domain crossing (CDC) [61]. 
Data transfer from one domain to another is impossible without matching circuits. 
Various problems may occur during CDC depending on the parameters of clock 
signals. Frequency and phase are important parameters of clock signals. The 
mismatch between two different domains leads to a violation of timing parameters 
for establishing and maintaining DFFs. Violation of these timing parameters causes a 
metastable state in DFF output [62]. 
An example of connection of two ﬂip-ﬂops is presented, where CDC occurs 
(Fig. 5.16). Here, DFF1 is clocked by clk1 clock signal (CS) and DFF2 by clk2 clock 
signal. 
If clk1 and clk2 signals are synchronous with each other, then all timing param-
eters will be preserved, and the data In1 will be transmitted losslessly to Out2 of 
DFF2. However, if clk1 and clk2 signals are asynchronous, TCC occurs, and for a 
certain period, a violation of the conﬁrmation and maintenance time parameters may 
occur at Out1 of DFF2. 
An example of connecting two DFFs where CDC is generated is presented in 
Fig. 5.16. Here, DFF1 is clocked by clk1 clock signal (CS) and DFF2 by clk2 clock 
signal.

metastability due to CDC 
If clk1 and clk2 signals are synchronous towards each other, then all timing 
parameters will be preserved, and In1 data will be transmitted losslessly to Out2 of 
DFF2. However, if clk1 and clk2 signals are asynchronous, CDC occurs, and for a 
certain period, a violation of the conﬁrmation and maintenance timing parameters 
may occur at Out1 of DFF2. 
This will cause a metastable state at the Out2. A timing diagram is presented in 
Fig. 5.17 where a CDC violation occurs and a metastable state occurs at the 
Out2 [63]. 
In case of metastability, the output of the ﬂip-ﬂop is uncertain and can be read as a 
logic 1 or a logic 0 by the fetching circuit. In addition to functional failure, another 
problem arises. The duration of the metastable state is also uncertain. Depending on 
technological parameters used and the frequency of the circuit, this duration can vary 
from a few percent of the reading CS to the size of a whole paragraph or more. In the 
latter case, it can cause metastability in the outputs of sequentially connected ﬂip-
ﬂops, which also leads to the failure of the entire circuit. There are two concepts to 
describe CDC: destination and endpoint. The source domain is the one that transmits 
the data, and the endpoint domain is the one that reads the data. Another problem 
arises when the CS frequency of the source domain is higher than that of the 
destination domain. The phenomenon of data loss in case of CDC violation is 
presented in Fig. 5.18 [64].

dual-ﬂop synchronizer 
To solve the above problems and avoid metastability, synchronization circuits are 
used. A well-known matching circuit is the multi-ﬂop synchronizer. A dual-ﬂop 
synchronizer is presented in Fig. 5.19 [65]. 
The operating principle of that circuit is to ﬁlter the metastability. As shown in 
Fig. 5.20, here also a metastable state occurs at the output of DFF2. However, it will 
not be transferred to the output of clk3 if a logic 1 or a logic 0 is asserted in Out2 at 
the next positive edge of clk2. The timing diagram of the matching process is 
presented.

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
As it can be seen, the Out3 of DFF3 does not go into a metastable state due to 
CDC and does not cause a behavioral failure of the circuit. If the frequency of clk2 
clock signal is high enough, and the duration of metastable state at the output of 
DFF2 exceeds the duration of the period of clk2, then a metastable state transition is 
also possible at the output of DFF3. In modern ICs, clock signal frequencies reach 
several GHz, and in order to avoid CDC problems, three-stage/four-stage synchro-
nizers are used. 
There is a formula to calculate the probability of a CDC failure. It describes the 
time between failures and is a function depending on many variables, including 
source-destination clock frequency and destination-domain clock frequency. In 
every IC design problem, it is important to calculate the mean time between failure 
(MTBF) for an arbitrary signal crossing the CDC boundary. Failure means that the 
signal passing through the synchronizing ﬂip-ﬂop goes into metastable state and 
remains in metastable state until the next positive edge of the fetching clock signal. 
This causes a metastable state at the input of the fetching circuit in the endpoint. The 
MTBF is calculated by the following formula [66]: 
MTBF = 
e 
th 
τ 
f d  f cs  Tm 
ð5:3Þ 
where th is the necessary setup time of data (s), τ time constant of latch (s), fd data 
change frequency (Hz), fcs clock frequency of destination domain (Hz), and Tm meta-
stability duration(s). 
Implementation Issues of High-performance Heterogeneous IC 
Architecture 
Heterogeneous IC architectures represent one or more CPUs and noncomplex 
computing cores or accelerators. Among the mentioned architectures, SIMD or 
MIMD architectures are used in heterogeneous ICs [47]. SISD processors or their 
grouping are intended to implement non-computational functions or the part of the 
program that does not need acceleration. 
Accelerators are designed to perform computational operations or processes, 
providing improvements in power consumption or performance parameters as well 
as operations with big data. When designing heterogeneous architectures, it is 
important to consider the following: by what kind of interfaces the accelerators 
and processors are connected to each other, and how the data transfer between them 
is organized. 
One approach to designing heterogeneous architectures is to integrate the accel-
erator directly into the processor core and transfer data through internal registers. 
These types of heterogeneous ICs are called application-speciﬁc instruction pro-
cessors (ASIPs). This approach provides acceleration of the implementation of

algorithms and low power consumption, but it is not compatible and is used in 
limited problems. The architecture of ASIP core is shown in Fig. 5.21 [67]. 
5.1
General Issues of Designing Means for High-performance. . .
239

Fig. 5.22 Components and structure of FPGAs 
Another design approach is to have accelerators with more complex architectures 
in ICs that are compatible and capable of performing various computational opera-
tions. Here, the processor and accelerators are connected to each other through 
special packages. The processor is also a control unit for accelerators. 
Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) also play an important role in modern 
heterogeneous systems [68]. FPGAs (Fig. 5.22) were originally used for prototyping 
of digital ICs. However, along with the development of the structure of FPGAs, their 
ﬁelds of application also developed. For example, FPGAs are used in consumer 
devices. Sometimes, using FPGA in various devices is more affordable and efﬁcient 
than producing application-speciﬁc ICs for these devices, but in terms of operating 
frequency and power consumption parameters, ICs surpass FPGAs [69]. 
FPGAs, unlike ICs, are limited by their operating frequency. Modern FPGAs can 
have an operating frequency of 1–1.5 GHz, and in areas where process 
parallelization leads to increased performance, FPGAs are widely used. 
FPGAs enable programmers to design circuits at a high abstraction level using the 
OpenCL library [70], which signiﬁcantly reduces design time. However, with this 
method, the design is not efﬁcient in terms of resource use and power consumption.

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Fig. 5.23 Heterogeneous IC architecture 
There are also architectures that are designed on the following principle: data 
exchange between accelerators and the processor is carried out through a common 
cache memory. In addition to cache, dynamic memory is also used as shared 
memory [71]. 
An example of heterogeneous IC architecture is presented in Fig. 5.23 [38]. At a 
high level of abstraction, the aforementioned heterogeneous IC consists of CPUs, 
GPUs, FPGAs, coherent interconnects (CI), last level cache (LLC), dynamic random 
access memory (DRAM) interconnect, dynamic memory control unit, and external 
DRAMs. Central processors can consist of 1 or more cores, with a maximum of 16. 
They, in turn, have L1 cache (1 MB). The cores have a common L2 cache (2 MB). 
A GPU consists of hundreds or thousands of computing cores (CPUs). GPUs, like 
CPUs, have a total of L2 cache. They provide data ﬂow between LLC and processing 
nodes. Between LLC and L2 cache is CI, which solves the problem of cache memory 
coherence. In this heterogeneous IC, there is also an embedded FPGA, which makes 
it possible to perform calculations speciﬁc to the given problem. External DRAMs 
are used to buffer large amounts of data. 
Thus, the above-discussed methods ensure the design of heterogeneous ICs, but 
their application leads to limitations for implementing an even more effective design. 
In particular, data transfer between component parts is carried out by means of 
reliable parallel power rails. However, as mentioned in Sect. 5.1.1, the presence of a 
large number of parallel power rails contributes to the complexity of interconnects 
between them, which reduces the number of additional cores installed in IC. Clock 
domain crossing solutions ensure lossless data transfer from one domain to another, 
but cause additional delays in the process, which negatively affects performance. 
The structure of heterogeneous ICs discussed above provides high performance, but 
circuits with such architecture are not compatible and only solve a certain problem.

5.1.3 
Principles of Design Means for High-performance 
Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits 
Taking into account the above-discussed architectures of modern heterogeneous ICs 
and their implementation methods, it can be concluded that they are applicable, but 
there are certain shortcomings, including:
•
Provision of data transfer between components in heterogeneous IC. In the 
solutions discussed above, data transmission is carried out using parallel power 
rails, which lead to a high density of power rails at the design stage, which in turn 
complicates the structure of the entire interconnect. As a result, the number of 
cores integrated into the IC decreases, which in turn leads to a decrease in 
performance.
•
As a result of the presence of multiple clock domains in heterogeneous ICs, CDC 
problems arise. In particular, when transferring data from one clock domain to 
another, a metastable state occurs in the output of the fetching FFs. The solutions 
discussed above require delaying the multiple clock signal periods by means of 
synchronizers which contributes to reducing the performance of the entire system.
•
The choice and design of heterogeneous IC architectures is unique depending on 
technical requirements and the ﬁeld of application. That is, they are not ﬂexible, 
and their design is a time-consuming process; in addition, creating a veriﬁcation 
environment in the process of designing digital systems also requires additional 
time, which leads to an increase in the cost of designing heterogeneous ICs. 
To solve these problems, the following design principles have been proposed for 
heterogeneous ICs.
•
Implementation of data transfer between components in heterogeneous ICs. It is 
proposed to carry out this process through a modiﬁed UART interface, in which 
the transfer of control data will be carried out, which will ensure ﬂexibility 
depending on the operating mode. The application of the proposed principle 
will simplify the structure of interconnects, but will lead to an increase in the 
area of components.
•
Data transfer approach between clock domains. New circuits for synchronizing 
data transfer between clock domains and corresponding behavioral models have 
been proposed. Application of the proposed nodes within CDC boundaries will 
result in additional delay reduction at the expense of additional area consumed.
•
Heterogeneous IC architecture. It is proposed to develop such an architecture of 
heterogeneous IC, which will be structurally and behaviorally compatible, and the 
design process will be simpliﬁed. Namely, the proposed architecture will be 
generative depending on the technical task. Due to the compatibility of the 
proposed architecture, the area of heterogeneous IC will increase in comparison 
to ASIC, with the same performance for solving unique problems.

Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits 
5.2.1 
Method for Improving Data Transfer Between 
Components in High-performance Heterogeneous 
Integrated Circuits 
In heterogeneous ICs, depending on the operating mode of cores, one core can have 
high frequency of the clock signal, the other—low one. These cores have the same 
data transfer function and interfaces based on the respective instructions. These 
interfaces complicate the logic function of the interconnect and limit the number 
of cores in the IC. In order to solve these problems, it is proposed to carry out data 
transmission between cores through a serial ﬂexible modiﬁed UART interface. 
As already mentioned, one of the interfaces used for data transfer in ICs is UART, 
which is widely used due to its simplicity and ﬂexible parameters. UART has 
transmit and receive lines for data transfer. The applicability of an interface, for 
example, in computer or network systems, is due to the fact that it is common to 
many devices, but the data structures change from device to device due to differ-
ences in their transfer rates and packet parameters. Due to its ﬂexibility, the interface 
has a very wide applicability in processor and microprocessor systems, too. The 
devices in which UART is used are conﬁgured so that it is possible to transfer data 
through them. However, the user needs to implement special settings for satisfactory

interface performance depending on the implementation environment. To solve this 
problem, the UART modiﬁcation mechanism is proposed, which enables a self-
calibration process to be carried out through UART units, as a result of which its 
parameters will be detected. Since the modiﬁed UART was used to transfer data 
between the internal components of a heterogeneous IC, its performance was 
signiﬁcantly increased due to the reduction in physical size of transistors. It would 
not be possible to implement it for data transfer outside IC. Currently, self-calibra-
tion UART controllers exist, but their disadvantage is that only the speed parameter 
is detected during the self-calibration process. They are not capable of detecting the 
number of data bits in the packet and the method of calculating the parity bit. A new 
instruction set is proposed to implement the proposed UART modiﬁcation. 
5.2

UART controllers in different devices have different parameters. They are:
•
Wide performance range—300 bps - 1 Mbit/s
•
5, 6, 7, and 8 data bits in one packet
•
1, 1.5, and 2—“end” bits
•
Calculation of parity bit by odd or even method. 
It can be seen from the above that the UART packet can have various structures. 
Data transfer with UART interface is carried out through one line. This is done by 
sequential, bit-by-bit shifting. From the perspective of each device, one line is for 
transmission and one line is for reception. The transmission TX line is connected to 
the receiver of the other device, and the reception RX line is connected to the 
transmitter of the other device (Fig. 5.13). The transmitter and receiver lines are 
independent and asynchronous. 
However, devices supporting this interface do not have a dynamic control 
method, which means that it is not possible to dynamically change the data transfer 
rate, packet structure, and parity bit calculation method, which affects the ﬂexibility 
of the interface. 
To solve the above-mentioned problems, a modiﬁed UART interface control unit 
(CU), which has the ability of dynamic self-calibration, is proposed [72]. In the 
process of self-calibration, UART controllers in various devices can detect the data 
transfer rate of the transmitter, the structure of the packet, and the logic of the parity 
bit calculation. 
The operation of a typical UART is not based on this. In it, both sides of the 
transmission have the same speed, and the transmission frequencies are independent 
of each other. The modiﬁed UART interface is based on “master-slave” transmis-
sion, as in the Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. The software of the “master” 
UART unit determines when the self-calibration process should start. It starts with 
the release signal, which corresponds to the logical value “0” (Fig. 5.24). The 
duration of this signal depends on the value of the pre-set minimum speed setting. 
The minimum UART speed is set to 300 bps. For reset, it is necessary to transmit the 
logical value “0” to the “master” node, equivalent to the duration of 11 bits of time. 
At a bandwidth of 300 bit/s, the duration of the signal will be 36.6 ms. 
“Slave.” The control unit detects the reset signal, after which it transmits an 8-bit 
data packet to the “master” control unit, but the parity bit is missing there. That

packet is designed for data bandwidth decoding. The data value in the packet should 
be 0xAA (0b10101010) (Fig. 5.25). During data reception, the “master” control unit 
decodes the UART speed parameter of the “slave” control unit. If the “slave” control 
unit does not respond to the reset signal, then an attempt is made through the 
“master” control unit to carry out the self-calibration process two more times. 
After three failed processes, the “master” control unit switches to standard UART 
operation mode at minimum speed. 
244

Fig. 5.25 Speed decoding process in modiﬁed UART 
After restoring the value of the speed parameter, the “master” control unit 
performs further transmission accordingly. With this mechanism, the “slave” control 
unit informs at what speed it can receive a transmitted packet. A new instruction has 
been announced to detect the rest of parameters for the UART bus transfer. After 
reset and receiving the packet intended for restoring performance, the “slave” control 
unit transmits a packet for determining the parameter of the amount of data 
(Fig. 5.26).

5.2
Methods of Design for High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
245
Fig. 5.26 The process of decoding the amount of data in a modiﬁed UART 
The ﬁrst two data in the received packets correspond to the instruction identiﬁ-
cation bits. The corresponding value of the instruction for the amount of data per 
packet is 2’b01. The next two bits determine the value of the data amount parameter. 
They are:
•
2’b00—5 bits of data in one packet
•
2’b01—6 bits of data in one packet
•
2’b10—7 bits of data in one packet
•
2’b11—8 bits of data in one packet 
After receiving the value of the amount of data parameter, the “slave” control unit 
passes it to the next packet to determine the number of “end” bits. Its instruction 
identiﬁcation value is 2’b10 (Fig. 5.27). 
The second and third bits in the received packet determine the number of “end” 
bits. Their corresponding values are:
•
2’b00—1 end bit
•
2’b01—1.5 end bits
•
2’b10—not applicable
•
2’b11—2 end bits 
The parity bit mode is determined in the same way. Its corresponding instruction 
identiﬁcation value is 2’b11 (Fig. 5.28). The values corresponding to the second and 
third bits are:
•
2’b00, 2’b10—the packet does not contain a parity bit.
•
2’b01—even mode of parity bit.
•
2’b11—odd mode of parity bit.

Fig. 5.27 Process of decoding the number of “end” bits in a modiﬁed UART 
Fig. 5.28 Process of decoding the parity bit mode in a modiﬁed UART 
After the decoding of all parameter values, the “slave” control unit can decide to 
end the self-calibration process by sending an instruction, the identiﬁcation value of 
which will be 2’b00, or change the values of some parameters by sending respective 
instructions. 
With the mechanism mentioned above, the “slave” control unit transmits the 
calibration parameters to the “master” control unit. A further extension of the 
modiﬁed UART allows the transmitter to modify the packet structure and speed 
parameters of the receiver via a special packet. That extension represents the 
independence of the transmit and receive lines in terms of packet parameters and

transmission speed. That is, the “master” control unit transmits the data at one speed, 
and the “slave” control unit at another. The same applies to packet parameters. 
5.2

Fig. 5.29 Forced performance change in a modiﬁed UART. 
After the reset, the transmitter immediately transmits the performance calibration 
packet, based on which the performance parameter is reset in the receiver based on 
this data (Fig. 5.29). For example, the core is in high-performance mode and trans-
fers data at a speed of 200 Mbps. Before going into low power mode, the core 
changes the performance setting to 9600 bps by the above mechanism and goes into 
low power mode. After that, the “slave” control unit restores the data with a 
bandwidth of 9600 bps. After the reset, the slave control unit’s receiver is clocked 
at the maximum possible frequency, due to which every possible performance 
parameter is restored (300 bit/s to 200 Mbit/s). Thus, each transmitter can change 
the performance parameter of the receiver. However, after this process, the trans-
mitter performance of the “slave” control unit does not change, and it can change the 
corresponding parameter of the “master” control unit with the same mechanism. 
Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Method for Improving the Means 
of Data Transfer Between Components in High-performance 
Heterogeneous ICs 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method presented in Sect. 5.2.1, a logic 
circuit of interconnect between two cores was designed. It is implemented by means 
of adapters between special-purpose clock domains. Then, the same problem was 
solved using the proposed modiﬁed UART, and the area and performance parame-
ters were evaluated. 
In order to evaluate the accuracy of the behavioral description of the logic circuit 
of data transfer between two cores, its testing environment was created (Fig. 5.30). 
Data processed in heterogeneous ICs is not transferred between cores, or it happens

when both cores are in the same power consumption mode. In that case, both cores 
are clocked with the same clock signal. 
248

Fig. 5.31 Input interface of a synchronizer 
However, there is often a transfer of instructions or conﬁguration data from one 
core to another. The transfer of instructions can occur when the cores are in different 
power consumption modes and are clocked by asynchronous signals. That is why 
synchronizers are used. 
In this case, the observed circuit implements 8-bit instruction transmission. The 
data ﬂow is organized in a clock domain from “A” to “B.” In addition to 8-bit direct 
data, control signals are also transmitted and in both directions. Feedback is neces-
sary to transmit the response, which means that the sent instruction has been received 
at the endpoint “B” clock domain. The instructions transmitted for simulation are 
stored in the input instruction array and passed to the synchronizer one by one. The 
interface between them consists of an 8-bit bus, valid, and handshake signals 
(Fig. 5.31).

Fig. 5.32 Signals of synchronizers 
The source-domain synchronizer can buffer up to eight instructions, at the 
expense of internal FIFO memory. The command is transmitted with toggle valid 
signal. As soon as an instruction is read from memory, a switching signal is 
generated and transmitted to the destination domain. The instruction is considered 
valid when switching occurs. That signal is transmitted to destination through a 
sequential synchronizer. The instruction data is not synchronized at the expense of 
delay time constraint (5.4). 
T max:delay = 2  Tdest clk - Tsetup:
ð5:4Þ 
The acknowledgment signal is transmitted from the destination to the source 
domain, the synchronization of which is also done by switching (Fig. 5.32). 
From the circuit above, it is obvious that eight parallel buses are used to transmit 
8-bit data. Below is a solution using a modiﬁed UART. 
The following changes were made to implement the modiﬁed UART:
•
To improve the area, provision of packets in different formats has been elimi-
nated. The number of data bits in one packet is 8, the parity bit is absent, and 1 bit 
is used to transfer “end.” In heterogeneous ICs, different cores are in a single IC, 
and there is no need to support different data packet formats. In contrast to the 
interconnection outside IC, the inﬂuence of external noises on the internal 
connections in heterogeneous ICs is minimal. That is why there is no need for a 
parity bit. Redundant internal counters have been removed from the circuit.

•
To improve power consumption, clock signal modiﬁcation interface has been 
added. Depending on the power consumption mode, the input clock signal 
changes. For example, in low-power mode, it is blocked or has a low frequency 
of the order of MHz. For the classical UART implementation, the frequency of 
the clock signal does not change during operation, and the speed is determined 
only by maximum values of internal counters. Due to the added interface in the 
modiﬁed UART, it changes according to the frequencies of the cores in 
IC. Moreover, the number of clock signal frequencies is adjustable. 
Detection of performance is implemented when the input clock signal frequency of 
the circuit is 2 GHz. At maximum performance, the data transfer speed with UART 
clock is 200 Mb/s (Table 5.2). 
For behavioral veriﬁcation of the receiver, its testing environment was created 
(Fig. 5.33). It consists of UART transmitter veriﬁcation intellectual property (VIP), 
clock signal change control unit, clock signal generator (CSG), and transmitted data 
receiver (DR).

Fig. 5.34 Changing the clock signal in a modiﬁed UART 
In a modiﬁed UART, the receiver’s ﬁnite state machine (FSM) has two additional 
states that are anticipated for switching of input clock signal. 
Those states are:
•
WAIT_CLK_SWITCH—the modiﬁed UART receiver waits for the logical one 
value from validation signal from clock signal change control domain.
•
CALC_BAUD_RATE—performance parameter recovery is carried out using a 
counter clocked at a frequency of 2 GHz. 
To switch its input clock, UART receiver modiﬁes its clock select (clk_sel) 
output and waits for clock switch done (clk_switch_done) signal assertion 
(Fig. 5.34). 
The data rate calculation is performed when receiving the input data 0x55. The 
duration of one logical 0 bit is calculated using a counter clocked at 2 GHz 
(Fig. 5.35), after which it again changes the code of the clock signal accordingly 
(from 200 to 100 Mb/s) and goes to state of waiting for valid/done signal assertion. 
The start of the packet is detected by the negative edge of the line (Fig. 5.36). 
The receiving bus passes through a two-stage synchronizer, and single clock 
signals are generated from the positive and negative edges from the received signal. 
After that, reception of sequential data begins, and the check of the “end” bit is 
carried out (Fig. 5.37). 
In case of its wrong value, it is accepted as a reset instruction, and the process of 
changing the clock signal and performance starts (Fig. 5.38). After the change of the 
clock signal, respective new packets are received (Fig. 5.39). 
The transmitter and receiver of the modiﬁed UART perform synchronization of 
clock signals independently of each other (Fig. 5.40). 
From the logic synthesis result of the modiﬁed UART transmitter (Fig. 5.41), it 
becomes clear that this circuit can be clocked by a synchronizing signal up to 
2.12 GHz.

Fig. 5.36 Detecting the start of the packet on a modiﬁed UART 
The logic synthesis of the receiver showed that its maximum operating frequency 
is 2.996 GHz (Fig. 5.42). 
Thus, the area occupied by the logic circuit of the modiﬁed UART is 74.85% 
more than the area of the core interconnection synchronizer, due to which the 
number of interconnection buses between the cores has decreased by 8 times 
(Table 5.3). Compared to the classic UART control unit, the area of the modiﬁed 
UART has decreased by approximately 48%. The increase in the area of the core 
when using the modiﬁed UART was only 2.25%.

Method for Improving Data Transfer Between Clock 
Domains in High-performance Heterogeneous 
Integrated Circuits 
As it was already mentioned above, in various IC systems, in order to ﬁnd out how 
appropriate it is to use a two-stage synchronizer for the solution of the given 
problem, it is necessary to calculate the MTBF. In case of failure, as a result of

switching of the transmitted signal, a metastable state occurs at the output of the ﬁrst 
cascade of the synchronizer. It remains in the metastable state for one complete 
period of the clock signal and causes a metastable state at the output of the second 
cascade, too. It can also cause a metastable state in the receiving clock domain. In 
this case, the behavior of the circuit is violated due to the uncertain values of signals. 
A variety of factors affect the MTBF, but the clock signal and data change frequen-
cies are decisive.

Often, in designs clocked at ultra-high frequencies, the MTBF of a two-stage 
synchronizer is not sufﬁcient to solve the problem, which is why three-cascade or 
even four-cascade synchronizers are used. However, in those architectures where the 
occupied area has a decisive role, their use is not advisable.

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Fig. 5.43 Circuit of a synchronizer 
The architecture of the proposed synchronizer (Fig. 5.43), in contrast to the 
approaches discussed above, is based on the use of an analog signal comparator 
instead of additional cascades to detect the metastable state at the output of the ﬁrst 
cascade [63]. 
In case that the output signal of the ﬁrst cascade is not in a metastable state, it is 
directly transmitted to the destination domain input. Otherwise, the input value of the 
ﬁrst cascade is passed instead. The synchronizer with the proposed architecture 
consists of an input ﬂip-ﬂop, a NAND cell, and a multiplexer. It is also important 
that the comparators detect the metastable state due to the reference voltages. If the 
value obtained at the output of the ﬁrst cascade is in the voltage range of 0.3–0.8 V, 
the synchronizer considers it metastable. This condition distinguishes which signal 
the proposed circuit selects and transmits to the output. 
Two cases are discussed below: when the signal is stable and when it is in a 
metastable state. 
In the ﬁrst case, it is assumed that the stable signal has reached the domain. In this 
case, the output of the comparator will be “01” or “10,” depending on the value of 
the input voltage, greater than 0.8 V or less than 0.3 V, respectively. The role of 
comparators here is that the value passing through the NAND element, which is the 
input data of the multiplexer, is a clear logical “1.” As a result, the signal from the 
ﬁrst clock domain will be transferred to the output. 
In the other case, when the value of the received voltage is in the range of 
0.3–0.8 V, the output of the comparators will be the logical value “11,” which will 
be transferred to the input of the NAND cell. The latter, in turn, will transfer the 
value “0” to the input of the multiplexer. As a result, the output of the receiving clock 
domain will be directly connected to the input, which will make it possible to avoid 
the transition of a metastable state at the output of ﬂip-ﬂop. 
There are strict constraints on certain timing paths of the circuit, which ensure that 
the fetching ﬂip-ﬂops do not appear in metastable state (5.6). These paths are the 
output delay of a synchronizer and the input-to-output delay of the ﬁrst cascade.

When a metastable state is detected at the output of the ﬁrst cascade by an analog 
comparator, the multiplexer transfers the input signal to the output. In that case, 
when the required delay is not provided, a metastable state can occur in the 
destination domain at the output of the fetching ﬂip-ﬂop.

ð5:6Þ 
where Tin.out.del. is the delay from the input to the output of the synchronizer during 
the switching of the ﬁrst cascade, Tmax.met. is maximum metastable state duration, 
Tmin.out.del. is the minimum output delay, and Tsetup and Thold are the timing param-
eters for setup and hold times of fetching ﬂip-ﬂop at destination. Respective time 
constraints must be given to logic synthesis tool so that the circuit operates without 
failure in the result. 
In digital circuits, a two-stage synchronizer is the basis for the design of synchro-
nizers with complex structures. Based on the proposed circuit, to design complex 
synchronizers, its behavioral model was proposed in the “Verilog” hardware 
description language [73]. It is adjustable, so the setup and hold timing parameters 
of the ﬁrst cascade which is inside, depending on the library cell, can be changed. It 
can also change the delay time of output buffers. These timing parameters can be 
changed randomly within certain limits to detect errors during the simulation. 
In case of violation of setup and hold timing parameters, an undeﬁned X value is 
introduced into the simulation model at the output of the ﬁrst cascade ﬂip-ﬂop. This 
mechanism is implemented to simulate metastability. The X value can be passed to 
read ﬂip-ﬂops during simulation. To simulate this, a random logic value of 1 or 0 is 
passed to their input. The duration of metastability is also adjustable. 
In the proposed model, the necessary timing parameters are embedded, which 
makes it possible to detect functional errors caused by CDC during the RTL 
simulation stage and ﬁx them. 
Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Method for Improving Data 
Transfer Between Clock Domains in High-performance Heterogeneous 
Integrated Circuits 
The two-stage synchronizer (Fig. 5.44) is considered the simplest circuit for syn-
chronizing 1-bit signals. Due to the peculiarity of its structure, the data is delayed by 
time corresponding to one period. In case that there is a metastable state in the output 
of the ﬁrst cascade, then it must be established within the time corresponding to one 
period, so that there is no metastable state in the output of the second cascade. If the 
signal is setup, the second cascade will transmit a setup signal with a logic value of 
1 or 0 and thereby prevent the transfer of an unstable signal to more sensitive 
components of IC, the combinational cells. The two-stage synchronizer is a well-

known and frequently used circuit in the market. It is not used for fast-to-slow CDCs 
and can only be used for single-bit data signal synchronization.

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Fig. 5.44 Structure of a feedback synchronizer 
A feedback synchronizer is widely used to transfer the entire data stream from one 
domain to another. As shown above, this problem can be solved by using a two-stage 
synchronizer for each bit of data stream. However, this method will lead to occupy-
ing a large area when there is a 128-bit bus and two additional synchronizers for each 
bit. In addition to the problem of large circuit area, this method can also lead to data 
loss in case some bits take the new changed value and the rest take the previous value 
of data. Instead, having a certain time loss, a synchronizer based on the principle of 
feedback is used (Fig. 2.21). 
Instead of using a two-stage circuit to synchronize each bit of the data bus, the 
source domain transmits an additional validation signal along with placing the data 
on the bus. That signal passes through the two-stage synchronizer to the destination 
domain, and there, upon detecting its active level, the data is read, and the feedback 
control circuit sends back the receive signal, which is in turn synchronized to the 
source domain, again through the two-stage synchronizer. 
An asynchronous FIFO is used to transfer data from one domain to another 
asynchronously. Each of domains has its own CS. The source domain and the 
destination domain receive and read the data with their CSs, respectively (Fig. 5.45). 
There are some limitations to consider for this synchronizer. The ratio of read and 
write speeds should be compatible with the ratio of CS frequencies, so that data loss 
can be avoided as a result. The FIFO must not go into an overﬁlled or underﬁlled 
state. 
The complex synchronizers discussed above are designed using the proposed 
mixed-signal circuit and compared with classical approaches. “SAED 14 nm”

technological library was used [74]. Complex synchronizers are designed using 
Verilog device description language. 
5.2

Fig. 5.45 Asynchronous FIFO memory structure 
Simulations were performed for two cases discussed above: in the presence of a 
metastable state of the signal (Fig. 5.46) and in the presence of a stable signal 
(Fig. 5.47). 
In the ﬁrst case of simulation, the clock signals of receiving clock domains, as 
well as the transmitted data, are presented. When data is transferred from one domain 
to the next, it creates a metastable state (v(meta)) (Fig. 2.23), violating the setup and 
hold times. When metastable signal passes through comparators, a comparison of the 
current voltage level occurs, outside or within the range of 0.3–0.8 V. In this case, 
since the condition of metastability occurs, the signal “11” is obtained at the output 
of comparators, which is transferred to NAND cell. As a result, the multiplexer 
selection signal changes from 1 to 0. Therefore, the multiplexer connects the input of 
the domain to the output, which eliminates the problem of generating a metastable 
state. 
When a stable signal (v(meta)) is obtained in the receiving clock domain 
(Fig. 5.47), the values “01” and “10” corresponding to the stable state are obtained 
at the output of comparators. In this case, the multiplexer selection signal was 
received as a logic “1.” In this case, the synchronizer designed by the proposed 
method only transmits the received signal to the output with a certain delay in order 
to exclude data failure at the destination domain. 
From the simulation results of the behavioral model, the metastable state is clearly 
visible at the output of the ﬁrst cascade, which is marked as X signal (Fig. 5.48). 
After the metastable state is completed, its output switches to logic 0 value. After a 
respective delay, the output of the circuit also switches. As it can be seen, the output 
of the reading ﬂip-ﬂop in the destination domain is stable. In this case, the input of 
the synchronizer passes to the output and does not cause a violation of setup and hold 
timing parameters.

Fig. 5.46 Simulation results by presence of metastable state 
In the other, the case is considered when the changed input signal does not pass to 
the output of the circuit (Fig. 5.49). Here, the output of the ﬁrst cascade goes into a 
metastable state, and the multiplexer transmits the data coming from the source 
domain with a certain delay. As a result, a small jitter occurs. In case that the 
necessary timing delays are present in the circuit, this is not transmitted to the 
destination domain at the time of reading, due to which functional failures do not 
occur. In case that the frequencies of clock signals of source and destination domains 
are close, the delay of the output of the circuit in case of two consecutive 
missamplings can be at most two periods. 
The designed synchronizer was compared with the classical two-stage circuit 
(Fig. 5.50). From the simulation result, it can be seen that a time gain of at least one 
clock signal period was recorded. When using three or more cascades, the number of 
beneﬁted periods increases, which leads to increased performance in complex IC 
systems.

A modiﬁed pulse signal synchronizer is designed using the proposed mixed-
signal synchronization element. It carries out the transmission of the pulse signal 
generated in the source domain to destination domain. The complexity of the design 
arises when the pulse signal is transmitted from a clock circuit with a fast frequency 
to a slow one. Due to the lack of an active edge of the slow clock signal, the signal 
generated at the source may not be read and will not be generated at the destination 
domain. That is why feedback is used from the destination domain to the source 
domain. Due to the small delay of clock signals of the proposed synchronizer, the 
modiﬁed pulse synchronizer transmits the pulse signal at least one period earlier than 
the classical one (Fig. 5.51).

In addition to the occupied area, the proposed synchronizer has an advantage, that 
is, when using it, the periods of the additional clock signal are not lost, compared to 
the method of using cascades. This advantage can be decisive in designs, operating 
at ultra-high frequencies, where a period of one or two clocks can be used for clock 
synchronization of other data processing nodes. In the case of the proposed 
approach, in contrast to the use of cascades, it is possible to reduce the area occupied 
by the system and increase the performance. 
However, in the proposed synchronizer, comparators are used, which are refer-
ence voltage-controlled, switching differential ampliﬁers. That is why the power 
consumption increases when using the method. 
Thus, simulations were performed in the case of a clock signal with a frequency 
of 2 GHz. At such frequency, in the case of using a three-stage synchronizer, 
18 more transistors are used compared to the proposed method. Compared to the 
two-stage circuit, the proposed circuit occupies an average of 21% more area, but 
when three or more cascades are used, the area saving is at least 30%. 
5.2.3 
Implementation Method of the Architecture 
in High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated 
Circuits 
As mentioned above, modern heterogeneous IC implementation methods are com-
plex from the design point of view and inﬂexible depending on the problem. 
Therefore, there is a need to create a new architecture of heterogeneous ICs, 
which, depending on the problem and the ﬁeld of application, will be adjustable 
and simple from the point of view of being embedded in other systems. 
The architecture with a high abstraction level of the proposed heterogeneous IC 
consists of (Fig. 5.52):

The proposed circuit is connected to IC system through the bus of interconnection 
of peripheral nodes (Fig. 5.53). In a given heterogeneous IC, the CPU executes 
instructions, sent from the software. It generates unique instructions for the proposed 
circuit and controls interrupts. It communicates with the internal registers of the 
circuit with the proposed architecture through the bus of interconnection of periph-
eral nodes. 
Internal cores are computing nodes with RISC architecture. They process 32-bit 
data. Each CPU has an internal RF which consists of 32 common use registers. Data 
and instruction memories are separated. The number of internal cores can be from 
4 to 16, depending on the circuit creation settings. 
The memory control unit is responsible for downloading data and instructions 
and generating instructions corresponding to the direct memory access node. It also

provides an interface to an external static RAM (SRAM). It cooperates with the 
queuing unit and special instruction processor provides the process of writing/ 
reading their data.

The queuing unit distributes the implementation of instructions/tasks, coming to 
an IC. It performs synchronization of CPUs available for data and their processing. 
In the process of data processing, it performs time allocation of computing resources. 
Through it, in the case of big data, processing of the latter is performed from an 
optimal timing perspective. The queuing node generates speciﬁc instructions for 
the CPUs. 
The special instruction processor executes the IC-speciﬁc instructions that are 
generated and received by software in the operating system (OS). 
The power consumption control unit is responsible for selecting the clock signal 
frequencies. Depending on the operating mode of the IC, it can switch to low power 
consumption modes. This unit performs the selection of clock signal frequencies 
corresponding to these modes. 
Control registers are based on ﬂip-ﬂops. They are the control and status registers 
through which the software in the OS controls IC operation. 
“Master” AXI/AHB direct memory access control unit provides data reading or 
recording from system memory. 
“Slave” AXI/AHB register address control unit establishes communication 
between OS software and control/status registers.

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Fig. 5.54 Interrelation of CRB and buffers in system memory 
Fig. 5.55 CRB structure 
External cache memory is for instruction/data buffering. Those domains are 
separate. 
The entire operation of a circuit is controlled by a specially designed software 
(SDS) in the OS (Fig. 5.54). It prepares data in system memory and generates 
computing request blocks (CRBs). Each CRB contains a system memory pointer 
to a block of data and instructions to be processed, as well as four control bits 
(Fig. 5.55). As it can be seen, each CRB can deal with a 64 KB data buffer and a 
4 KB instruction buffer. Each core has an area in cache memory of appropriate size, 
given to instructions and data. 
In order to reduce the load on the cache memory, three external static memory 
devices are used. 
The ﬁrst one is designed for high abstraction level IC units to buffer and process 
CRBs. Its size is adjustable and determined by the parameters selected by the user. 
The second and third ones are the instruction and data buffers, respectively, the sizes 
of which are determined by the number of cores:

5.2
Methods of Design for High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
267
Ins:buf = Ncore  4 KB  
data:buf = Ncore  64 KB
ð5:7Þ 
Before the circuit can start its operation, it must go through the initialization 
process, which is issued by SDS in the form of instructions. These instructions are 
processed and implemented by the INS. During this process, internal registers and 
core resources are adjusted. 
After the initialization process is completed, SDS prepares the CRBs and issues 
their reading and execution process with appropriate instructions, updating the 
CRB’s internal pointer. In order to read and process the CRB, it is necessary that 
chain bit has logical 1 value. Otherwise, that CRB is closed by the device and ends. 
The SDS is informed about the status of the CRB through the interrupt mechanism 
implemented in the circuit. It is used if the interrupt bit in the corresponding CRB has 
a logic 1 value. Otherwise, the SDS should periodically read the CRB. After 
completing its processing, the circuit registers a logic 0 value in the chain ﬁeld. 
Buffers of different domains can be connected to each other by registering a 
logical 1 value in the next ﬁeld. 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of Implementation Method 
of the Architecture of High-performance Heterogeneous ICs 
To evaluate the performance of the proposed architecture, a video processing 
platform on a high-performance FPGA was designed. Video processing was 
performed on that platform, and its performance compared to video resolution was 
studied. The same problem was solved using the proposed heterogeneous IC, and its 
effectiveness was compared. In case of FPGA implementation, dynamic memory is 
used to buffer video image data, and data is recorded there with a specially designed 
interface (Fig. 5.56) [75].

Design of High-performance Heterogeneous Integrated Circuits
Fig. 5.57 Reading an image from external dynamic memory 
Fig. 5.58 Architecture of a video image processing circuit designed on FPGA 
After the full image data is received in the read buffer, it is read and processed 
(Fig. 5.57). 
After reading, the image is transformed from the red-green-blue (RGB) color 
range to the color-saturation-brightness (CSB) range, undergoes all the appropriate 
processing and corrections there, and is converted back to the RGB range. Then it is 
displayed on the monitor. 
From the structure of the designed system, it can be seen that it has four clock 
domains (Fig. 5.58). They are the corresponding domain of the clock signal received 
from the image reading interface from the camera, the domain of the external 
DRAM, the domain of the output image extraction interface, and the domain of 
the reference clock signal. 
From the results of the research, it can be seen that the operating frequency of the 
circuit increases with the increase of the resolution of the video resolution 
(Fig. 5.59). 
In case of maximum frequency, it is possible to provide 60 Hz video processing 
with a resolution of 1920 × 1200 (Fig. 5.60). Research shows that at an operating

frequency of approximately 200 MHz, the designed circuit is able to provide the 
same amount of data processing as a 60 Hz video stream. Along with reducing the 
resolution of the video image, the frequency of the possible supporting video stream 
increases.

Fig. 5.60 Dependence of video frequency and supporting resolution 
The same data processing algorithm is implemented using the circuit with the 
proposed architecture. However, there are certain differences in terms of receiving 
data and extracting processed data. In the case of heterogeneous ICs, the image data 
is located in the system memory and there is no need for additional buffering. They 
are read using DMACU (Fig. 5.61). After reading data, instructions are read for 
cores with the same mechanism. After processing data, they are recorded in the 
system memory (Fig. 5.39). In addition to reading instructions and data, the same 
process is carried out for CRBs by means of DMACU (Fig. 5.62). 
The CRB is read and buffered in the appropriate range in external cache memory. 
This is then read from there by the queue unit, which in turn decodes and 
generates instructions for the DMACU to read the array of instructions and data 
from system memory (Fig. 5.63).

Fig. 5.61 Data reading through DMACU 
Fig. 5.62 Post-recording of data via DMACU 
In order to perform post-recording of data, it is read from the data area of the static 
memory and transferred to the DMACU through the memory control unit (MCU) 
(Fig. 5.64). It, in turn, implements the data post-recording process. 
The circuit is designed for a maximum frequency of 2 GHz. It has the ability to 
conﬁgure and select the number of cores from 4 to 16. There are strict requirements

for the frequency of MCU and DMACU. Their bandwidth should be equal to the 
sum bandwidth of the cores. Otherwise, the waiting process in the core arbitration 
process will take a long time, which will lead to a decrease in performance. The 
number of gates used in one core is approximately 24,000. The area of the total 
circuit is approximately 210,000 gates. 
5.2

Fig. 5.63 CRB recording, read in cache 
From the results of logical synthesis of the circuit (Fig. 5.65), the dependence of 
the number of cores and the used gates can be seen. The dependence is almost linear 
due to the presence of extra-core units. They occupy almost four core areas. 
However, in case of further scaling, the area of cores will dominate compared to 
them. 
From the comparison it can be seen that the video image processing circuit, 
designed on FPGA, is close to the proposed circuit in the case of four-core conﬁg-
uration (Fig. 5.66). In all other cases, the increase in area is multiple, even compared 
to the initial area (Table 5.4). 
From the performance results it can be seen that the performance increases with 
the increase in the number of cores (Fig. 5.44).

As it can be seen from the results, a further increase in the number of cores leads 
to a sharp increase in area, but the increase in performance is not relevant (Fig. 5.67). 
Thus, a method for the implementation of the architecture of heterogeneous ICs 
was created, which, due to the use of queuing, memory control, and direct memory 
waiting units and a special instruction, provides a 32.48% increase in speed in the 
video image processing process at the expense of an 11.008% increase in area.

Conclusions 
1. A method of improving the means of data transfer between components in 
heterogeneous integrated circuits has been proposed, which, due to the modiﬁed 
architecture, provides an eightfold reduction in the number of interconnect buses 
between cores, at the expense of an increase in the area spent in the core by 
2.25%. 
2. A method for improving the means of data transfer between clock domains in 
heterogeneous integrated circuits has been proposed, which, due to the mixed-
signal architecture, provides an increase in performance of at least 50% at the 
expense of an average of 21% additional area. 
3. A method of implementing the architecture of heterogeneous integrated circuits 
was proposed, which, due to the use of queuing, memory control and direct

Cells

6.1.1 
Importance of Design of Digital Integrated Circuits 
by Improving the Characteristics of Digital Cells 
It is known [1] that standard cell (SC) libraries are currently widely used in IC design 
process. Any digital circuit (DC) to some extent includes digital ICs, such as simple 
logic operation; sequential, high-speed, power-saving, input/output (I/O) signal 
control; and other cells. 
As a result of the wide use of SC libraries, in order to increase efﬁciency and 
reduce errors in the design process of their components, a large number of additional 
conditions are proposed. Standard cells repeatedly go through the stages of design, 
improvement, and optimization during the entire process of their creation (Fig. 6.1). 
During the creation of SC library cells, in addition to basic design rules, such as 
design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic design (LVS), special atten-
tion is also paid to a number of other characteristics of SCs, such as:
.
Compatibility of power supply and grounding cables with future designs
.
Static and dynamic power consumption
.
Routability
.
Access to I/O cells
.
Compatibility with other logical cells 
In addition to the main libraries of SCs, which comply with the design rules and 
are optimized according to speciﬁcations, libraries with different heights (Fig. 6.2) 
and threshold voltages (Fig. 6.3) are also developed for the same technological 
process.

The use of SCs with different threshold voltages and heights, dense I/O cells, 
different layout optimizations, and different power and supply structures in the same 
design leads to additional difﬁculties:
.
Incompatibility of power supply network in the case of cells with different heights
.
Errors arising from placement of cells
.
Reducing routability of I/O cells

Large area of the design

High power consumption of the design 
The requirements for efﬁcient IC design are: 
Optimization of standard I/O cells: This is done in important steps by modifying the 
structure to obtain SCs with better characteristics in the result of further increas-
ing the routability of the design and saving routing resources, as well as checking 
the I/O cells of already designed and optimized cells to avoid design problems for 
the creation of inter-cell distance rules (ICR) of the design. 
Minimization of circuit area: The simultaneous use of SCs with different heights in 
one design, as experience shows [2, 3], signiﬁcantly reduces the area of the 
circuit, because, mainly for reasons of performance, circuits use cells with a 
large height more often, which in turn leads to an increase of circuit area. 
Power consumption optimization: Just as in the case of using cells with different 
heights, the use of lower cells in some places reduced the area of the circuit, so the 
use of high cells on critical paths leads to optimization of power consumption of 
the circuit, due to which, however, a decrease in performance may be observed. 
Summing up, it should be noted that due to the widespread use of digital cells in 
the process of designing integrated circuits, optimization of their parameters is 
important. Therefore, the improvement and optimization of characteristics of digital 
cells, which are one of the important issues of the present, are the most important 
challenge for the effective design of ICs.

Current State and Issues of Design of Digital Integrated 
Circuits by Improving the Characteristics of Digital 
Cells 
Effective development of ICs by improving the characteristics of digital cells is 
currently one of the current design problems. Improving the characteristics of digital 
cells includes various directions, the most popular of which are increasing the 
performance of cells, improving routability and accessibility of I/O cells, reducing 
dynamic and static power consumption, etc. 
There are a number of well-known methods for effective development and 
optimization of ICs by improving SC characteristics [2–13], which can be divided 
into two main groups: pre-design [4–9] and post-design [2, 3, 10–13]. Among the 
most popular methods currently available are:
.
Prediction and optimization of standard I/O cell accessibility using deep learning 
(DL) algorithms [4]
.
Optimization of design results by using SCs with different heights in the same 
design [14]
.
Due to the use of SCs with low power consumption, optimization of the power 
consumed in the design [15]
.
Addition of extra metals by calculating timing parameters of the circuit [16] 
Prediction and Optimization of Accessibility of Standard I/O Cells Using Deep 
Learning Algorithms 
Currently, the large number of IC design rules and the complexity of the required 
checks lead to the demand for the use of ML algorithms in evaluation and optimi-
zation of the accessibility of standard I/O cells. In the case of different methods [17– 
19], using ML and DL techniques, SC I/O accessibility is estimated with high 
accuracy, and approaches to improve it are proposed, such as SC ﬂoorplan optimi-
zation, creation of placement distance rules, generation of routing ﬁles, etc. 
One of the methods of evaluation and optimization of the accessibility of standard 
I/O cells of ML is the prediction of violation of design rules (DRV) based on their 
pattern [4, 20]. The peculiarity of this approach is that it is the ﬁrst one that takes the 
pattern of I/O cells as a feature for the estimation of DRV. 
The proposed approach can generally be divided into three main steps:
.
Creation of data for the ML process
.
Model training
.
Detailed model-driven placement 
Two ML models are considered: I/O pattern recognition (PR) and design-speciﬁc I/O  
pattern recognition (DSPR), of which I/O takes only I/O patterns as the only input data, 
and DSPR includes more design rules to increase prediction accuracy. Later, model-
driven placement places the cells in such areas that no design problems arise [21]. Here, 
self-named training data is needed to perform supervised learning. Therefore, 
pre-designed designs and their DRC results are used in learning process (Fig. 6.4)  [4].

6.1
General Issues in Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving. . .
283
Fig. 6.4 Learning and 
placement processes 
After generating the ML learning graph data, according to the method, a training 
data set is created from each DRC error place, centered on the short-circuit error 
section of the second metal layer (M2). In general, to apply the I/O pattern, a given 
section of the design is taken as m x n, where m is double of the unit height (UH) and 
n is equal to UH (Fig. 6.5) [4]. 
Then the received image is divided into pixels, the height and width of which are 
chosen according to the minimum distance of the ﬁrst metal layer (M1), so that one 
pixel does not include two different M1 I/O cells [22, 23]. Then the value of each 
pixel is calculated, taking into account how much of it is occupied by the I/O cell

(Fig. 6.6) [4, 24], after which the processed information is transferred to the speciﬁcs 
generation module (SGM).

SGM represents a DL network consisting of two packet and two maximum 
unifying layers. The two packet layers separate the key speciﬁcs of I/O cell patterns, 
while the maximum unifying layers are used to reduce the number of speciﬁcs. After 
the speciﬁcs of I/O cells are extracted, they are smoothed and passed to the input of 
the classiﬁcation algorithm. It represents a fully connected neural network and a 
sigma function. 
The sigma function is considered the last layer of the classiﬁcation algorithm, 
which scales the output value of the neural network between 0 and 1. Such scaling 
directs the model to understand whether a given I/O pattern will cause M2 short 
connection [25–28]. 
After the PR model is obtained, using DSPR, the presented approach helps the 
detailed placement tool to prevent receiving problematic pattern not to have short-
connection circuit of M2. DSPR consists of three main steps:

6.1
General Issues in Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving. . .
285
.
Creation of placement ICR
.
Creation of routing constraints (RC) by dynamic programming
.
Speciﬁcation of cell movement 
The ICRs generated during cell placement are described by the required number 
of distance locations (RNL) (6.1) [4, 29]: 
RNL Am 
i , An 
j 
= k :
ð6:1Þ 
Equation (6.1) [4] describes the RNLs in the ICR between the i-th (Am 
i ) cells with 
“m” direction and the j-th (Am 
i ) cells with “n” direction. As a result of the method 
operation, the placement of cells is continuously changed in a stepwise manner until 
the probability of a short circuit predicted by the M2 model for the placed cells is less 
than 0.5 (Fig. 6.7) [4]. 
This method of evaluation and optimization of accessibility of standard I/O cells 
based on ML is fast and reliable, but has some disadvantages, namely:
.
Application of a large number of sample designs for training ML model, since the 
effectiveness of the model directly depends on the amount of data used for 
training.
.
Need to train the model in case of any change in cell ﬂoorplan and/or I/O cells 
because in this case the application of the previous model may lead to an incorrect 
result.
.
RNL iterative addition of ICRs during design.
.
Only M2 short-circuit fault prediction using PR and DSPR, because after having 
the pattern of standard I/O cells, it is possible to predict more design rule 
violation.
.
In the process of creating a ML model, the training data, placed and routed 
designs, are entered as graphical data. 
This results in necessity to perform the step of extracting the pattern of I/O cells 
from graphical data. 
Taking into account the above, other methods aimed at improving the accessibil-
ity of cell pins were further developed, which, in addition to predicting and 
correcting errors at M2 metal level, also perform routability optimization at other 
metal levels, estimate the cost of the circuit, and improve IC characteristics by using 
SCs of different heights. 
Optimization of Design Results by Using Standard Cells with Different Heights 
in the Same Design 
It is known [14, 30, 31] that by using cells with different heights in the same design, 
certain parameters of the designed circuit are improved, namely:
.
As a result of the use of cells with greater height, due to the increase in power 
consumption and the increase in area, it is possible to obtain a faster circuit.

Fig. 6.7 Short circuit probabilities by cell position
.
As a result of the use of cells with a smaller height, at the expense of deterioration 
of performance, it is possible to get a more dense and power-saving design 
(Fig. 6.8) [3]. 
In addition to deterioration of performance, cells with a small height have one 
more disadvantage. Such cells are more likely to have routability and I/O cells’ 
accessibility issues because they include fewer routing paths due to their small size. 
Such cells can be drawn wider. In order to obtain a larger fan out, such an approach 
will increase the parasitic capacitances (PC) of gates and interconnects, which will 
lead to excessive power consumption and increased area [32]. 
Taking the mentioned problems into account, it can be said that the use of high 
and low SCs in the same design can have a positive effect on IC performance in

places where it is more important, and in places that require denser placement, it is 
possible to use low cells.

287
Fig. 6.8 Probabilities of cell performance and area ratio by position 
There are various methods to improve the applicability of cells of different 
heights in the same design [14, 30, 31]. According to one such method [3], the 
main emphasis is placed especially on cells that differ from each other in height by 
not a full measure. 
The application of this method starts by taking register transfer level (RTL) 
description of ready design, the timing parameters, logical and physical models of 
SC library, technological information including different heights of cells, area of 
placement and routing (P&R) part, and the aspect ratio of the design as input ﬁles. 
The ﬁnal goal of the method’s work is the orderly arrangement of logical cells on 
rows corresponding to their height. In addition to placement, the goal of the method 
is to obtain the smallest possible area and power consumption of the design under the 
conditions of the same performance [33–36]. 
In addition to the ones listed above, some other checks and conditions are also 
applied during the PR of the design to improve the performance of the method, 
namely:
.
In order to ensure manufacturability, each fragment of SC placement with a 
certain height should have a minimum height of two units [37, 38].
.
In order to ensure the continuity of nwell, each fragment must consist of an even 
number of rows [39].

288
6
Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving the Characteristics. . .
Fig. 6.9 Combining cells with different heights
.
Each fragment must match the structure of metals and polysilicon layer (poly) in 
the design.
.
The horizontal distance between two fragments should be at least 4 units.
.
There should be enough distance in the vertical direction between two fragments 
so that the power and grounding buses of SCs of the ﬁrst and second fragments do 
not touch each other (Fig. 6.9)  [3]. In Fig. 6.9 [3], the minimum inter-metal 
distance (MID) of M2 is 64 nm, and the thicknesses of buses are 45 nm and 
64 nm, respectively, in the case of low and high cells. In this case, even though 
the difference in the widths of buses is smaller than the MID, the minimum 
distance d must be 64 nm in order to fall on routing paths of metals.
.
Divider cells should be placed to maintain minimum horizontal and vertical 
distances. 
According to the method, at the beginning of the operation, the RTL description 
is taken, and the gate level description (GLD) design is synthesized using SC logic 
descriptions with different heights. Before starting the P&R of design process, the 
layout exchange format (LEF) ﬁle of physical description of cells is modiﬁed in 
order to break the closed loop of uncertainty between the ﬂoorplan and the height of 
the cells. The heights of all cells are changed to be equal to cells with the smallest

height, but the previous values are preserved. The modiﬁed LEF ﬁle is written to the 
computer’s memory as mLEF (modiﬁed LEF). Such an approach eliminates uncer-
tainties and allows using the current industrial P&R means for further processes 
according to the method [40]. As the initial SC logical descriptions are used during 
placement, P&R tools estimate and optimize the design with high accuracy. With 
this method, no conditions speciﬁc to the use of SCs with different heights are 
applied during primary placement, so that P&R tool freely selects the most suitable 
cells for area and timing parameters from libraries of SCs with different heights. 
Thus, the high cells are used in time-critical parts, and the low cells are used in area-
critical parts.

289
Fig. 6.10 Regular placement of cells of different heights 
After the ﬁrst stage of placement, the placement area is divided according to SCs 
with a speciﬁc height, taking into account the area of dividing cells. In this process, 
the cell height values are restored to their original value [41–43]. Then, there are two 
ways to adjust the placement of cells:
.
By cell movement
.
By changing the height of the cell 
The placement of the cells is considered regular if each of them is in the range of 
height, anticipated for it (Fig. 6.10) [3]. 
After the initial placement of cells is completed, the operation of the method can 
be divided into three stages:
.
Division of ﬂoorplan and deﬁnition of areas
.
Placement and regulation by calculating timing parameters
.
Conversion from mLEF ﬁle to original LEF ﬁle 
The method of optimizing the design results by using the presented standard cells 
with different heights in the same design is highly effective in placing and legalizing 
cells, but it also has drawbacks, such as:
.
Changing the cell description ﬁle with the LEF extension, as a result of which the 
ﬁles are modiﬁed two times, and according to the method description, such a 
change should be made during the execution of each design.
.
Creation of separate placement sections for cells of each height, as a result of 
which the physical design of a circuit is divided into parts in which cells of 
different heights are placed at a certain distance from each other.

Fig. 6.11 Power consumption in CMOS circuits
.
After the initial routing and segmentation, the second routing is needed, the 
reason being that the modiﬁed mLEF ﬁle is used ﬁrst, then the detailed placement 
needs to use the original LEF ﬁle, too. 
Due to these reasons, methods were later developed to ensure the applicability of 
SCs with different heights in the same design, while predicting the power consump-
tion of the circuit and selecting optimal cells to obtain better results. 
Standard Cell Library Characteristics Extraction with Optimal Power Con-
sumption Using a Neural Network 
As it is known [15, 44, 45], power consumption in circuits can be divided into two 
groups (Fig. 6.11) [19]—dynamic and static. 
The power consumption in ICs is highly dependent on the power consumption of 
SCs, so to ensure low power consumption, cells need to be as optimal as possible. 
Currently, there are various methods for reducing SC power consumption [20– 
24]. Some of them [15, 43] are based on the reduction of power consumption during 
the design of circuits, while others [44, 45] are based on ensuring their low 
consumption at the initial stage of SC design. 
One of the SC power consumption reduction methods [15] is noteworthy, which 
by applying the DL technique to an already ready SC library, as a result, returns 
more suitable SC library and the most acceptable constraints to the given design. 
In general, the library selection process for a design with optimal/near-optimal 
power consumption of the described method [15] can be divided into three main 
parts (Fig. 6.12) [15]:
.
Training of power consumption estimation model
.
Estimation of power consumption
.
Library optimization 
According to the method, presented in Fig. 6.12 [15], some input data are ﬁrst 
read, namely, the different SC libraries, descriptions of several circuits, frequencies

of circuits, and power consumption of each of circuits. The input information is then 
given to power cost estimation module, which includes a DL network. At the end of 
the training, in order to estimate the power consumption of any design, there is a 
need to provide the method with the SC library, the description of the new circuit, 
and the required frequency as input data. Information about the SC library here 
includes:

Supply voltages 
The power consumption estimation model includes a two-layer neural network, 
one hidden and one output layer (Fig. 6.13) [15]. Data input into a neural network is 
performed with n number of input features, and data output is performed with y 
output features. SC library data and circuit information are considered as input 
features for model training. The output of the model is the total power consumption 
of the circuit. 
DL model is presented in the following way [15]: 
f x
ð  Þ = W0 * h1 þ b0,
ð6:2Þ 
where f(x) and h1 are the results of output and hidden layers, respectively, W is the 
weight matrices, and b is the initial orientation values of layers. A neural network 
also contains a non-everywhere differential nonlinear continuous activation 
function [15]:

The TensorFlow library [25] was used to build the power estimation model. The 
model uses the adaptive moment estimation (Adam) Stochastic optimization algo-
rithm to reduce the number of errors between the actual and predicted values [26]. In 
order to exclude over-adaptation, the method of omitting some neurons during 
training is also used [27]. 
After getting power consumption estimation model, according to the method, the 
description of the most optimal/near-optimal library is searched among the imported 
libraries. All 24 imported libraries are used in parallel for this process and are given 
power estimation model as input data. According to the method, all libraries are 
checked in a simple step-by-step way, and as a result the selected library is returned 
(Fig. 6.14)  [15].

Evaluating the Efﬁciency of Standard Cell Library Characteristics Extraction 
Method with Optimal Power Consumption Using a Neural Network 
2020 training examples were used to evaluate the performance of SC library 
characteristics extraction method with optimal power consumption using a neural 
network. Each training data includes six columns: ﬁve input data and one 
output data. 
The used libraries have the following parameters (Table 6.1) [15]:
.
Heights of SC libraries expressed by the number of routing paths: 7, 9, 12, and 14
.
The ratio of P and N domains in cells: 1, 2, and 3
.
Supply voltages: 0.8 V and 1.2 V 
After obtaining library parameters, nine conditional circuits were synthesized 
using them, the operating frequencies of which were selected from the range of 
0.1–1 GHz. Then, training data was generated from the set of ISCAS-89 [46] test 
circuits, their timing parameters were calculated, and those designs, the difference of 
which from the required value was less than 0, were removed from the data list 
(Table 6.1) [15]. 
In order to adjust the weights and initial values of neural network, the input data 
were randomly divided in the ratio of 80:20 as training and testing data, respectively. 
In order to evaluate the ﬁnal efﬁciency of the model, the mean square error (MSE) 
(6.4)  [15] and the determination coefﬁcient (DC) (6.5)  [15] are calculated:

As a result of model formation with ten different train-test data, the average value 
for MSE was 0.304, and 0.962 for DC. 
Three new circuits from ISCAS-89 [29]—s526, s713, and s15850—were used for 
model validation. As a result of simulation, two different values of power consump-
tion were obtained as a result of synthesis with target frequencies. In the end, the 
MSE values were calculated again, according to which:

Good results were obtained for s526 and s713, 0.227 and 0.096, respectively.
.
A relatively large value of 1.230 was obtained for s15850. 
As a result of evaluations, the following became clear. 
With the library where the supply voltage is 0.8 V and the cell height is minimal, 
optimal designs are obtained in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 500 MHz. 
Although reducing the supply voltage can reduce power consumption, it also 
slows down the circuit, resulting in timing violations. Therefore, libraries with a 
high supply voltage (1.2 V) and a large cell height are suitable for designing high-
frequency circuits, between 700 MHz and 1 GHz. 
At the end of the operation of the described method, the generalized data are

Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving the Characteristics. . .
With the method of extracting the characteristics of the library of standard cells 
with optimal power consumption using a neural network, it is possible to extract the 
optimal library for the given design with a high degree of accuracy. However, it has 
certain disadvantages, namely:
.
To extract the optimal library information, a large number of libraries are read, 
which may have many parameters. Along with changing the parameters, it is 
necessary to change the ML model and retrain the whole system [50, 51].
.
The method does not work with similar high accuracy in the case of different 
circuits of the same order.
.
The method essentially does not optimize the circuit and/or cells in the case of 
optimization at a given frequency [52].
.
Not only is the optimization/calculation of timing parameters not included in the 
optimization process, but also those libraries that violate one or another timing 
value are ignored during the calculation [16]. 
In order to eliminate the listed drawbacks, approaches to reduce IC power 
consumption by optimizing the characteristics of digital cells were further devel-
oped, which, in addition to reducing the total power consumption of circuits, also 
reduce the number of libraries needed for optimization process and optimize timing 
parameters of the circuit. 
A Method of Adding Additional Metals by Calculating Timing Parameters of a 
Circuit 
Currently, additional limitations are imposed during IC manufacturing due to the 
very small size of circuits being produced [53–58]. In addition to the fact that the 
manufactured circuit must have accurate DRC, LVS results, parasitic characteristics 
in the acceptable range, sufﬁcient timing parameters, low power consumption, etc., it 
is important that it also meets special manufacturing rules. Among the methods 
aimed at increasing performance in designs are:
.
Addition of cells without logic
.
Increasing the size of interconnections where possible
.
Addition of additional metals
.
Veriﬁcation and optimization of antenna effect
.
Limitation of the minimum area of layers 
Some of the listed methods do not have huge effect on the operation and timing 
parameters of a circuit, while others have quite an effect and can lead to deterioration 
of timing, power, and other parameters. 
The addition of additional metals is one of the methods that has a great impact on 
timing parameters of a circuit. The expediency of using this method is conditioned 
by several circumstances, namely:
.
Ensuring the manufacturability of the circuit for advanced technological

Ensuring regular equalization of a circuit 
Although the addition of additional metals is inevitable in current IC design and 
manufacturing processes, it leads to parasitic elements—capacitances that negatively 
affect circuit performance, power consumption, and timing parameters. 
Metals added to a circuit can generally cause three types of parasitics: area, side, 
and edge. 
Area capacitances arise when two conductors are located in different metal layers, 
and their projections on the ground surface overlap each other (Fig. 6.15) [53]. 
In Fig. 6.15, metal C creates parasitic capacitances with metals A and B, respec-
tively, CAC and CBC, as well as in metals A and B itself, CAB. In general case, the 
parasitic Cm capacitance, created by metals in metal layers l1 and l2 with cross-
sectional area s, is calculated by (6.6) [53], where P12 is the area capacitance per unit 
area and is a function of s. 
C12 = P12 sð Þ × s:
ð6:6Þ 
Side capacitance can occur between two conductors that are in the same metal 
layer and have horizontal overlapping (Fig. 6.16) [53]. 
In Fig. 6.16 [53], C1 and C2 are, respectively, the capacitances created by metals 
A and B with metal C, and C3 is the reciprocal capacitance of metals A and B. The 
side capacitance Cs is calculated by (6.7)  [53], where l is the length of overlap of 
metals and Pl(d) is the capacitance per unit length, depending on distance d between 
metals.

Edge capacitance can occur between conductors that are located on different 
metal layers, have overlap of parallel edges, but do not have overlap of area pro-
jections (Fig. 6.17) [53]. 
In Fig. 6.17, metal C together with metals A and B create edge capacitances C1 
and C2, and A and B together create capacitance C3. In general case, the capacitance 
Ce between layers l1 and l2 is calculated by (6.8) [53], where P12(d) and P21(d) are 
the edge capacitances per unit length depending on distance d between metals. 
Ce = P12 d

The capacitance of a circuit to the ground point of all wires is called “equivalent” 
and can be calculated by analyzing the network using the conductance matrix. 
Thus, the metals added to circuits for these purposes lead to additional parasitic 
characteristics and deterioration of timing parameters; therefore, when adding these

metals, it is necessary to monitor timing parameters and optimize them to avoid 
problems [59].

Fig. 6.18 Main operation of the method 
Currently, there are many methods of adding additional metals with the reduction 
of parasitic characteristics, which reduce the parasitic capacitances and/or speed up 
the operation of the circuit by using certain algorithms [60–62]. 
One of such methods is the introduction of additional metals by calculating 
timing parameters (TCMI) [53]. In this method, the input information is a graphical 
description of an already placed and routed design, on which it introduces additional 
metals, reducing the equivalent capacitance of the circuit in both extreme and 
remaining wires. 
The main operation of the described method can be divided into four processes 
(Fig. 6.18) [53]:
.
Creation of ﬁllable domains
.
Target density planning
.
Synthesis of common additions
.
Minor changes after addition 
The method of getting parasitic extraction embedded in the method contributes to 
the rapid extraction of the equivalent capacitance during the creation of complemen-
tary domain and planning processes of target density. 
Creation of ﬁlling domains is the ﬁrst operating process of the method. Since the 
input physical descriptions contain only locations of wires, it is necessary to separate 
the polygons to be ﬁlled corresponding to input wires given from such a design. The 
domains to be ﬁlled are those in which the addition of metals does not cause 
violations of the minimum distance of metals compared to the wires already in the 
circuit. At the beginning of the process of creating domains, the dimensions of the 
given wires are widened by the method in the amount of the minimum distance of 
metals, and then the coordinates of polygons limiting the remaining free spaces are 
taken. The resulting polygons generally have a rather complex structure with many

corners and sometimes holes inside. Because of this, it is necessary to perform one 
more step: converting polygons to rectangles [31]. It should be noted that the quality 
of subsequent addition of additional metals is highly dependent on the underlying 
conversion, as a result of which the improved method of converting polygons to 
rectangles (IPRC) is used during this process. It iteratively considers each given 
vertex and efﬁciently creates rectangles [31].

Fig. 6.19 Uniting domains to be ﬁlled 
Later, the IPRC method transforms into direction-speciﬁc polygons-to-rectangles 
(DPRC) method, where the images are described as “wide” and “high” rectangles 
depending on the preferred routing direction of a given metal layer, in the horizontal 
and vertical directions, respectively. Then, on the basis of the obtained results, the 
vertical and horizontal revision algorithm is applied, which unites the domains to be 
ﬁlled, which have a common side with each other (Fig. 6.19) [53]. 
The performed veriﬁcations have shown that, compared to IPRC method, DPRC 
signiﬁcantly increases the upper limit of metal density and allows introducing better 
solutions in the future, which is important especially in the case of introducing 
additional metals in lower metal layers. 
The next step in the described method is to plan the target density. In general, for 
efﬁcient calculation of minimum metal density, the selected veriﬁcation window is 
taken with dimensions w x w and shifted to area of the circuit by w 
2 step. To satisfy 
such a veriﬁcation, it is advisable to divide the circuit by w 
2 × w 
2 when adding the 
additions and immediately apply the minimum metal density condition to obtained 
windows. However, on the other hand, larger window sizes are more efﬁcient for 
synthesis of additions, in terms of providing greater ﬂexibility in adding additions 
and splitting local additions. Therefore, in the described method, instead of using the 
above subwindows, a new approach is described: target density planning, which 
creates a window-speciﬁc density value in each window, taking into account two 
conditions:

6.1

.
Reduction of capacitances with decisive wires
.
Reduction of the overall capacitance of the circuit 
Assume a W window system consisting of m × n Wij subwindows is given, where 
1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, (6.9) [53] will work for planning the target 
density.

Equation (6.9) [53] consists of two parts (6.11 and 6.12) [53], where the ﬁrst part 
contributes to reducing the target density in deterministic and/or multiwired 
windows.

Actually wc should be smaller than wnc to ensure a lower ﬁlling density in 
windows with high criticality. In addition, e provides larger densities in the neigh-
borhood of critical windows. Part 2 of (6.12)  [53] contributes to maintaining the 
minimum difference between the maximum density value and the planned density 
value. Such planning of target densities creates initial values for all windows in a 
more optimal and ﬂexible way, but, as can be seen from the formulas, they are not 
usually linear, so in their solution, it is advisable to add certain additional parameters 
to ensure linearity (6.13–6.16)  [53].

After creating the target densities, synthesis of metal additions is performed (i.e., 
additional metal layers that do not contain logical connections are added to free 
places of the circuit). The additions created at this stage are of particular importance 
in preventing the deterioration of timing parameters of the circuit, because they are 
responsible for the emergence of additional capacitances in the circuit. The most 
important points to be calculated in the process of creating additions can be consid-
ered [32–34]:
.
Prevention of occurrence of areal capacitances between decisive wires and 
implemented additions
.
Increasing possible metal distance between additions and other conductors
.
Prevention of inserting additions in the middle of two parallel conductors
.
Reduction of parallel linear length between additions and parallel conductors 
After creating the initial values of variables in the algorithm for creating general 
additions, according to the difference between the windows and the maximum 
possible densities, the windows are classiﬁed in descending order. Then, the oper-
ation of iterative addition is performed on them (Fig. 6.20) [53]. 
Fig. 6.20 Iterative ﬁlling algorithm

6.1

303
After completion of additions, the algorithm of detailed review of additions also 
causes a considerable improvement, in which the algorithm for calculating the 
Euclidean distance between the domains to be ﬁlled and the decisive wires performs 
the main function. 
When an optimal addition of ﬁllings is performed in the circuit in the result of 
synthesis of common additions, it is still possible to have certain additions that are 
not so optimally arranged and create large reciprocal capacitance with decisive 
wires. In order to solve such problems, small local changes with computation of 
timing parameters are made in the described method. This process can be divided 
into two parts:
.
With the calculation of timing parameters: transfer of additions
.
With the calculation of timing parameters: displacement of additions 
During the transfer of additions by calculating timing parameters, those additions 
that have a great effect on timing parameters are moved to domains with less effect. 
Here, the effect of ﬁlling in the given range on decisive wires and their equivalent 
capacitance is calculated. In the transfer process, |Ai - Ai1| difference is deﬁned 
where Ai is the original area of additions and Ai1 is the one obtained as a result of the 
change. If the speciﬁed difference is greater than the speciﬁed minimum value, then 
the change is considered acceptable; otherwise, the previous value is maintained. 
In the case of displacement of additions by calculating timing parameters, the 
method tries to ﬁnd a more suitable location for each addition, reducing the decisive 
capacitance. Here, a one-way movement is made either in the direction of x-axis or in 
the direction of y-axis. 
The presented method creates and places the metal ﬁllers with high precision and 
also optimizes the equivalent capacitances between them and the critical wires. 
However, this method also has certain disadvantages, namely:
.
No attention is paid to routing of the SC signals, but only decisive wires are 
considered. However, SC signals are also of great importance in the circuit design 
process, and the lack of speciﬁc requirements for them can lead to certain losses.
.
In the case of creating additions, the voltage drop of the circuit is not calculated, 
which, in general, depends on the equivalent capacitance of the circuit, and as a 
result of improving the capacitance, it can also be improved. 
Thus, a review of existing methods known from the literature shows that although 
they optimize SC libraries with a high degree of accuracy and generate optimal 
libraries for doing various designs, they still have limited coverage and/or do not 
optimize SCs sufﬁciently. 
In particular,
.
IC I/O accessibility checking algorithms partially/incompletely ﬁx SC library 
cells, as a result of which later, during IC design, cases of violation of design rules 
derived from SCs increase.
.
Methods of using cells with different heights in the same design to reduce power 
consumption make a large number of changes in the SC description ﬁles with the

condition of later post-modiﬁcation and create new ML models for each design, 
resulting in an increase in design time and the number of description ﬁles. In 
addition, when choosing the optimal library from the point of view of power 
consumption for a given circuit, a large number of libraries are used, which leads 
to the extension of the time of the tools, and the human factor in the design 
process increases.
.
Methods of creating metal ﬁllings do not take into account the possible voltage 
drop during their creation and are not aimed at improving it, while their addition 
to the design can signiﬁcantly improve the results of IC voltage drop and reduce 
the resources spent on it later. 
For the reasons listed, with the improvement of the characteristics of digital cells, 
there is a need to develop new principles and means of effective IC design, which, 
taking into account the issues presented above, will allow to optimize circuits. 
6.1.3 
Proposed Principles for Efﬁcient Design of Integrated 
Circuits by Improving the Characteristics of Digital 
Cells 
Thus, in order to solve the aforementioned problems, the following principles are 
proposed for the effective design of integrated circuits by improving the character-
istics of digital cells: 
Unlike the methods known from the literature, which optimize several layers, 
optimize all metal layers. Since the methods known from the literature optimize 
only some metal layers, not considering the other layers, it is proposed to create 
an environment for checking and optimizing the accessibility of I/O pins. 
The latter will check the I/O pins by creating special matching cases for cells and 
mark those cells that have accessibility problems. The main difference of this 
approach, compared to existing methods, is that all cells are collected in one 
complete design and combined according to a special pattern (Fig. 6.21), as a result 
of which an opportunity is created to check the routability of cells in dense place-
ment conditions in cases of different directions of cells. 
Using the ML algorithm, possible problems will be predicted as a result of cell 
routing, and inter-cell distance rules necessary for their solution will be created. In 
this case, the main difference compared to existing means is that the multi-class 
classiﬁcation method is used during the training of ML model, which makes it 
possible to check and optimize other metal layers as well (Fig. 6.22) [35]. 
The use of ﬁller cells created by ML during the placement of cells with different 
heights. This method, in contrast to the methods known from the literature, in the 
case of placement of cells with different heights, uses ﬁller cells created by ML.

Fig. 6.23 Connection of metal ﬁllers to power and grounding wires 
As a result of this, it is possible to place the cells, without a big change in total IC 
area without violating the rules of power and grounding buses and main layers 
(Fig. 6.23). 
The addition of metal ﬁttings connected to the power and grounding grid for IC 
design process. Since metal additions increase the overall capacitance of the 
circuit, but have an important effect on other stages of IC design, it is possible 
to optimize the voltage drop on the power and grounding of the circuit when 
adding them. The main difference of this method from the others is that the metal 
additions added to the circuit are connected to the power and ground wires 
(Fig. 6.24), as a result of which the inﬂuence of rapidly changing signal wires 
in the design on the other wires is reduced, improving the voltage drop. Such a 
change signiﬁcantly reduces the voltage drop at the expense of a certain deteri-
oration of timing parameters. 
By improving the characteristics of digital cells, the proposed principles of 
effective design of integrated circuits will allow to signiﬁcantly improve the main 
technical characteristics and parameters of SCs: power consumption, designability, 
and parasitic characteristics.

Conclusions 
1. Development of effective integrated circuit design tools by improving the char-
acteristics of digital cells is relevant, as it can signiﬁcantly improve the main 
parameters and characteristics of digital integrated circuit designs based on them. 
2. Analysis of the existing approaches and means of developing means of effective 
design of integrated circuits by improving the characteristics of digital cells 
shows that in the latter, the important circuit parameters, designed based on 
them, power consumption, voltage drop in the power supply, routability, etc., 
are not sufﬁciently optimized. However, from the point of view of practical 
requirements of the design of modern digital integrated circuits, this degree of 
optimization is not enough, and especially from the point of view of efﬁciency, 
there is a need to develop new methods, algorithms, and software tools that are 
signiﬁcantly superior to the existing ones. 
3. By improving the characteristics of digital cells, the principles of effective design 
of integrated circuits have been proposed, which, at the expense of machine time 
costs and nonsigniﬁcant deterioration of timing parameters and area of the 
designed integrated circuit, allow to signiﬁcantly improve the main parameters 
of integrated circuits designed based on them: power consumption, voltage drop 
in power supply, routability, etc.

Methods of Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by 
Improving the Characteristics of Digital Cells 
As mentioned in Sect. 6.1, the accessibility of standard I/O pins plays an extremely 
important role in IC design process. Its improvement leads to easier circuit routing 
and reduced DRC violations. Two methods are used to improve the accessibility of 
standard I/O cells: relatively simple and predictive and optimizing with the use of 
ML algorithms. 
6.2.1 
Method of Optimizing the Accessibility of Standard I/O 
Cells 
Optimization of I/O cell accessibility to SCs with an experimental design [63] is a  
relatively simple approach to check a ready SC library and mark cells with poor I/O 
access. This approach is used to cover the I/O accessibility of cells in a simple 
design, as well as to achieve performance compared to the I/O veriﬁcation method 
[64]. Another advantage of this veriﬁcation is that at the end of the design, it is 
possible to perform a single DRC and LVS on one ﬁnal design ﬁle. 
The operation of the method starts by reading logical and physical descriptions of 
relevant libraries, a simple RTL description, and the technology ﬁle (Fig. 6.25).

experimental design

309
Fig. 6.26 An excerpt from the generated interconnect ﬁle 
The purpose of reading a simple RTL description is to make it possible to connect 
the generated second circuit to it and implement the ﬁnal LVS. 
One of the most important parts of the method’s operation is the creation of 
interconnections. At this stage, all cells of all libraries read are taken, ﬁve different 
instances of the same cell are created, and their I/O cells are randomly connected to 
each other. At the end, the corresponding symbols “center,” “right,” “left,” “top,” 
and “bottom” are added to the resulting ﬁve copies of the same cell, which will guide 
the tool to make the correct placement in later stages. 
The ﬁnal interconnect ﬁle contains the cell name, symbol, and connection order 
(Fig. 6.26). 
Depending on the number of cells in the library, the circuit obtained during the 
creation of interconnect ﬁle may include between 5 and 10 thousand cells (Fig. 6.27). 
In the next stage, placement is done keeping the signs of the cells, after which the 
cells are placed in groups on the entire area (Fig. 6.28). 
After the regular placement of cells, the design of the ﬁle according to their 
interconnects is performed. At the end of this process, a rather dense routing of cell I/ 
O cells is ensured (Fig. 6.29), which makes it possible to easily identify problematic 
cells and I/O cells in conditions of larger routing paths. 
After the cells are designed, production-oriented changes (ORCs) are performed 
on the project, and ﬁnal ﬁles are written, on which DRC and LVS are performed. As 
a result, cells with a large number of DRC violations are marked as problematic cells 
from the point of view of placement and routing [65]. 
Thus, using the method of optimizing accessibility of standard I/O cells with an 
experimental design, it is possible to identify possible problems arising during their 
routing through special combinations of cells, at the same time, without limiting the 
number of metal layers passing through the veriﬁcation process [66].

Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Method of Optimizing Accessibility 
of Standard I/O Cells with an Experimental Design 
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method for optimizing 
accessibility of standard I/O cells with an experimental design, the SAED 14 nm 
educational design kit with a gate width of 14 nm and containing no intellectual 
property was used [67]. At the initial stage of performance evaluation, the library 
was divided into three smaller parts, which included 50, 100, and 200 cells, respec-
tively. While adding cells to the new libraries, the rules of Boolean algebra and 
digital design are respected for the purpose of synthesizing any RTL description with

the resulting libraries. Then, with the new libraries obtained, three types of designs 
with simple RTL description, I/O accessibility veriﬁcation algorithm, and applica-
tion of the presented method were made. DRC and LVS checks were performed on 
the circuits obtained at the end of the design.

Fig. 6.30 Comparison of veriﬁcation process times of existing and proposed methods 
According to the experimental results, as a result of using the proposed method, 
the cell library veriﬁcation speed increased by approximately 5784.3 s or approxi-
mately 9.4 times compared to the I/O cell veriﬁcation method (Fig. 6.30). Under the 
conditions of the proposed placement of cells, the number of cases of their matching

increased by approximately 67 or approximately 59.2% compared to the experimen-
tal design with a simple RTL description (Fig. 6.31).

Fig. 6.31 Comparison of cases of cell matching of existing and proposed methods 
Thus, as a result of the application of the proposed method for optimizing 
accessibility of SC I/O cells in experimental design, it is possible to obtain an 
average speedup of approximately 9.4 times for cell veriﬁcation compared to I/O 
veriﬁcation algorithm and approximately 59.2% more matching cases compared to a 
design with a simple RTL description. It also makes it possible to check all metal 
layers instead of a single metal layer. 
6.2.2 
Enhanced Method for I/O Cell Accessibility Prediction 
and Design Optimization with Proposed Machine 
Learning 
In order to predict the accessibility of I/O pins of SCs in the mid-design phase and to 
increase their routability during design, an enhanced method of I/O cell accessibility 
prediction and design optimization with machine learning is proposed. The operation 
of this method can generally be divided into three parts (Fig. 6.32). They are:
.
Extraction of I/O coordinates from designs

ML model training

Creation of horizontal and vertical ICRs for SCs

Extraction of I/O coordinates from designs is one of the ﬁrst and most important 
steps of the proposed method, because the accuracy of later-created ML model 
depends on the mentioned coordinates. Therefore, it is necessary that, on the one 
hand, the extracted coordinates are accurate, and on the other hand, they contain 
quite simple information, taking into account the speed of further processes. To 
extract I/O coordinates from design, the method ﬁrst reads various designs in the 
memory, along with their corresponding DRC results. Then, using the simple 
commands of placement and routing tools, it extracts the reference name of the 
used cells [68], the metal layer creating I/O cells, and their coordinates. The obtained 
results are saved in a predetermined special format (Table 6.4). As during the 
extraction of I/O pins, not the topological description of design but the design library 
[69] and simple commands of placement and routing tool are used, this process does 
not take much time to perform. 
After extracting the I/O coordinates, the proposed method creates a ML model to 
predict the problematic cells. As a result of model operation, it is possible to identify 
at most seven types of DRC violations:

In order to optimize the training time of the model, each of the listed violations 
can be turned off individually, deactivating the prediction made on it. 
The ML model consists of two nodes: extraction of characteristics and classiﬁ-
cation (Fig. 6.33). 
Four neural layers are used for characteristics extraction. The ﬁrst one represents 
the packet layer, followed by maximum merging, second packet, and second max-
imum merging layers (6.17):

Both packet layers have training weights, the values of which change depending 
on the presence of DRC violations in the given segment. In the next step, the 
extracted characteristics are passed to the classiﬁcation node. This node multi-

classiﬁes the input data according to several labels. A one-versus-all type of multi-
layer classiﬁcation is used here [70, 71]. To apply the one-versus-all type of 
classiﬁcation, the entire data set is divided into eight separate groups, with the 
training group labeled as “1” and all others as “0.” In this case, when the data is 
entered into the classiﬁcation algorithm, it goes through the process of binary 
classiﬁcation, and in the case of a predicted violation, a “positive” value is generated, 
and in the case of all others, a negative value (6.18).

When the cells that have the probability of DRC occurrence during routing are 
separated from the design, the proposed method then creates ICRs for them to 
prevent the given violation. Later, these ICRs can be used in any design made 
with these cells. To prevent DRC violations, the method calculates the existing 
distance of I/O cells of problematic cells and then, reading the technology informa-
tion, adds an ICR value such that the probability of this violation will be less than 
0.5. For example, for cells U1 and U2 in Fig. 6.34, the method predicted a short 
circuit of M1, after which, to avoid the problem, it created an ICR in the amount of 
2 units. 
When the cells that have the probability of DRC occurrence during routing are 
separated from designs, the proposed method then creates ICRs for them to prevent 
the violation. 
Later, these ICRs can be used in any design made with these cells.

During ICR creation, cell directions are considered to avoid excessive constraints. 
As a result, the process of creating ICRs can be represented by (6.19): 
ICR C1,x, C2,y = A
ð6:19Þ 
where C1,x represents the ﬁrst cell in the X direction and C2,y is the second cell in the 
Y direction. The necessary distance between them is deﬁned by A number. 
Thus, as a result of the application of the ML model, it is possible to predict and 
later also avoid routing problems arising during a speciﬁc arrangement, as well as to 
have a larger number of metal layers to be checked. 
Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Proposed Machine Learning Enhanced 
I/O Cell Accessibility Prediction and Design Optimization Method 
SAED14nm [67] libraries were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the above 
method. With them, designs were carried out, in which the density of cells varies 
in the range of 30–40%. In this technological process, the number of cells for each 
threshold voltage is approximately ~1000. The number of ML data taken from 
designs was approximately 6000, which was then divided into training and testing 
lists with a ratio of 70:30. The system on which checks were made has the following 
parameters: 2 cores with a frequency of 2.4 GHz, Linux operating system. Then the 
obtained results were compared with simple design methods presented in [63] 
(Table 6.5). 
From the point of view of metal layers different from M2, the simple design 
approach and the presented method were also compared (Table 6.5). 
The accuracy of the ML model for all DRC types was also calculated using (6.20) 
(Table 6.6). 
accuracy = 
TP þ TN 
TP þ TN þ FP þ FN × 100%:
ð6:20Þ 
The values given in (6.15) have the following physical meaning:
.
TP—number of correctly predicted DRC errors
.
TN—number of correctly predicted error-free DRCs
.
FN—number of incorrectly predicted DRC errors
.
FP—number of incorrectly predicted error-free DRCs 
Thus, according to experiments, by applying the proposed machine learning 
enhanced I/O cell accessibility prediction and design optimization method, it is 
possible to predict seven types of DRC violations in different metal layers. The 
application of the method allows to reduce the existing DRC violations in the design 
by approximately 47%, but as a result of the application of ML, the tool processing 
time increases by approximately 23% (Table 6.7).

6.2.3 
Optimization Method of Standard Cells for Digital 
Integrated Circuit Designs with Different Cell Heights 
As already mentioned above, the use of cells with different heights in the same 
design increases the circuit performance and reduces its power consumption. Logical 
synthesis tools are easily able to choose the height cell during synthesis process with 
the greatest possible accuracy, which provides maximum performance and minimum 
power consumption on the given time path (Fig. 6.35). The main problem of such 
synthesis of circuits is that later the physical placement and routing tool does not 
have the capability to perform the necessary synthesis with such ease.

Fig. 6.36 The ﬂow of optimizing SCs when doing design of cells having different heights 
A method for increasing the accessibility of cells with different heights in the 
same design is proposed [72], which, by modifying the GDS ﬁle of physical 
description of cells in the given library, makes it possible to place them regardless 
of their height. The ﬂow of the proposed method (Fig. 6.36) mainly consists of two 
parts: changing the power and grounding buses of SCs and implementing the design 
with modiﬁed cells [73–75]. 
Basically, SCs have the same structure of power and grounding buses [76]. Such 
a structure allows for easy connection of cells to circuit-level power and grounding 
grid during the design phase when placing the cells next to each other. And when 
combining cells in vertical direction, they are placed straight and upside down, 
sharing the given power or grounding bus [77–79]. 
When SCs of different heights are placed next to each other, the arrangement of 
their power and ground buses, as well as many other main layers, does not match 
correctly, which makes such placement impossible (Fig. 6.37). 
As described, the combination of cells with different heights is unacceptable from 
the point of view of cell placement approaches and power and grounding buses [80– 
82]. The proposed approach to solve these problems, using ML algorithms, modiﬁes 
the power and grounding grid of SCs as well as creates special ﬁller cells for correct 
placement of cells with different heights. 
The operation of the method begins with reading GDS description of SC library 
and separating layers used for placement and routing. The collected information is 
then processed into ML algorithm for reading and storage. 
In the next stage, the ML model, reading the previously prepared information, 
speciﬁes the metals belonging to power and grounding grid [83]. In this process, the

g
basic patterns of metal layers are also extracted: minimum distance, minimum angle 
length, minimum distance of the same wire, etc. Then, on those cells, where it is 
possible to add additional power and grounding metals, according to the method, 
following the rules, they are added. In general, it is possible to change the power and 
ground buses on cells in cases of which: 
320
6
Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving the Characteristics. . .
Fig. 6.37 Complications arising when combining cells of different heights
.
There are no signal and/or power and grounding wires in the speciﬁed areas.
.
The addition of power and grounding wires does not lead to violation of rules of 
metal layers.
.
All minimum distance rules are kept.
.
The additional supply and grounding buses are of the same type as the cell’s 
buses.
.
Added layers intersect with M1 and M2 routing paths. 
All the cells, whose structure and the view of power and grounding buses do not 
correspond to the mentioned points, are left out of the change process [84, 85]. 
Another important circumstance for the change of SCs is the selection of their 
placement limit. Current placement and routing tools determine the legal location of 
cells when placing them, depending on their starting point [86, 87]. For this reason, 
in order to be able to place the modiﬁed cell using placement and routing tools, their 
starting point is raised and aligned with the starting point of the small height cells 
(6.21).

Fig. 6.38 Additional cells to be created 
After the corresponding changes in the power and grounding grids, three types of 
ﬁlling cells are created (Fig. 6.38) for ﬁlling the lines in places of matching. These 
ﬁlling cells have two main uses:
.
Keep one minimum distance between high and low cells
.
Fill the free lines after placement and routing processes 
If the free area is greater than one minimum distance, the ﬁlling cells can be 
combined. 
The ﬁles created as a result of method operation are of three types: GDS 
descriptions of modiﬁed ﬁlling cells and added ﬁlling cells and the list of cells that 
have not been modiﬁed. 
In order to design with the obtained library, ﬁrst, using the initial logical descrip-
tion of cells, a logical synthesis is performed. As the logic synthesis tool tries to 
reduce circuit area and increase performance, it will select the required cell from the 
given libraries. 
In the physical design phase, the minimum size of the placement grid is chosen 
according to the cells with the lowest height. After that, the circuit-level power and 
grounding buses are created. They are mostly M2 or higher metal layers. Then 
placement and routing is done, and then ﬁlling of empty places using the SC library 
and ﬁlling cells, created according to the method. 
Thus, by using the proposed method, it is possible to apply them in the same 
design as a result of changing the physical descriptions of SCs with different heights. 
During the operation of this method, only GDS descriptions of SC library are 
modiﬁed, and then, using standard tools, placement and routing are performed.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, three designs were performed 
with libraries of 9T (low) and 12T (high) heights. At the end of the implementation

of designs, the physical and timing parameters of obtained circuits were compared 
(Table 6.8).

Thus, as a result of using the proposed method, it is possible to obtain approx-
imately 19% optimization in circuit area and approximately 14.3% optimization in 
timing parameters, compared to circuits designed with only 12T and only 8T 
libraries, respectively. However, as a result of the changes made, the time spent 
for placement and routing increased by approximately 27%, and the power con-
sumption increased by only 13%. 
6.2.4 
“Sleep Mode” Integration Method of Cells Using 
Neural Network for Low-Power Designs 
As mentioned earlier, IC power consumption has two component parts: dynamic and 
static. One of the options used to reduce power consumption [14] is to disconnect 
SCs that are not currently used in the circuit from the power supply and grounding 
grid. Thus, the given part of the circuit will have as low power consumption as 
possible (there will be a certain amount of consumption due to leakage currents). 
However, implementing this approach requires either special libraries or more 
complex design steps. 
In order to overcome the described challenges, the method of integration of “sleep 
mode” in SCs using a neural network is proposed [88]. The operation of this method 
(Fig. 6.39) can be divided into ﬁve main parts:
.
Creation of format of input ﬁles and reading
.
Extraction of technology-speciﬁc parameters with the DL algorithm
.
Creation of special cells
.
Indication of cells to be changed
.
Changing cells and extracting ﬁnal ﬁles

Methods of Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving. . .
323
Fig. 6.39 Operating principle of “sleep mode” integration method in SBs using a neural network 
Fig. 6.40 Circuit of cell connection 
According to this method, all cells that can be optimized are disconnected from 
the main power source. Their connection is provided by special cells. That is, 
conditional “false” supply and grounding buses occur, the cells of which are 
connected (Fig. 6.40). 
In the ﬁrst step, the proposed method reads the GDS description of the SC library 
and extracts the coordinates of metals, interconnects, and blocking layers from it 
[89]. The output information of this stage is the positions of different layers and, if 
any, the names of I/O cells attached to them. The information is then given to a data 
extraction algorithm, which includes a three-layer DL model. The ﬁrst of the layers 
is the input layer, followed by two hidden layers and one output layer [90]. The 
output layer of the model returns the min values extracted for the following metal 
rules: distance, overlap, edge distance, area, and U-distance. These data are later 
used in the process of creating special types of cells [91, 92].

324

Fig. 6.41 Control cell views 
The creation of special cells is the next stage of the proposed method. At this 
stage, the method, using the extracted values, creates special power and grounding 
control cells, which can be of three types (Fig. 6.41):
.
P-MOS and N-MOS control
.
P-MOS control, N-MOS ﬁlling
.
P-MOS ﬁlling, N-MOS control 
In the next step, the method reads the cells of the SC library one by one and marks 
those that have the characteristics of the change. They are:
.
SC has a power and/or ground connection close to the edge.
.
No large amount of routing barriers and metals near cell edges. 
For the cells that meet the mentioned requirements, the power and grounding grid 
is changed, and special cells are added [93]. If the power and grounding connections 
of the cell are located on one side of it, then only one special cell is added; otherwise, 
according to the appearance of the connections, two cells are added (Fig. 6.42). After 
that, the SC initial power and ground connections are disconnected and connected to 
the control cell. 
At the end, the GDS description containing all the cells of the library is written, 
including the modiﬁed ones. 
Thus, the proposed method changes the appearance of the initial SCs of the 
library through the DL network and integrates the “sleep mode” control into them. In 
the future, the use of such cells in designs will provide an opportunity to manage the 
connection of cells to power and grounding grid, thus reducing static and dynamic 
power consumption. 
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Cell “Sleep Mode” Integration Method Using 
Neural Network for Low-Power Designs 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, designs with two libraries of different 
heights were implemented. One of them is 12T high; the other is 8T. In the 
completed designs, the cells were used in one case without the proposed change,

in the other case, including it. According to the results (Table 6.9), high-height cells 
have greater capabilities for change, but the optimization in power consumption is 
approximately 5–6% greater for low-height cells. According to the obtained results, 
the total power consumption can be reduced by approximately 12%, but due to the 
added special cells, the area of circuits increases by approximately 5–28%, and the 
timing parameters deteriorate by approximately 16% on average.

Thus, as a result of using the proposed method, it is possible to obtain an average 
power consumption saving of approximately 12% at the expense of approximately 
5–28% increase in area and approximately 16% deterioration of timing parameters. 
6.2.5 
Method of Adding Metal Fillers for Digital IC 
Design Flow 
As already mentioned in Sect. 6.1, the addition of extra metals in the circuit is 
extremely important for increasing its productivity. However, this process causes an 
increase in the overall parasitic capacitance of the circuit, which affects its perfor-
mance and speed. On the other hand, during circuit operation, it is important to have 
a small value of voltage drop across its buses, because, otherwise, the connected 
voltage from high-level power and ground buses will drop greatly before reaching 
the SCs [94].

According to those listed, it is important to be able to add extra metals to the 
circuit while paying attention to the voltage drop on its buses [95]. 
For the implementation of the mentioned function, the method of adding metal 
additions in IC design process is proposed [96, 97], by which it is possible to add 
metals to the already completed circuit, considering and optimizing the voltage drop. 
The steps of the proposed approach can be broadly divided into four main groups:
.
Separation of domains to be ﬁlled.
.
Detection of overlaps of domains of power and grounding wires to be increased.
.
Reducing the voltage drop, increase metals and interconnects.
.
Calculating the target density, add additions. 
For the proposed method, in the ﬁrst stage, the graphic description of the already 
placed and routed circuit is the input data, and the coordinates of the domains, where 
the minimum distance violations will not occur as a result of adding metal ﬁllers, are 
the output data. To obtain this result, ﬁrst, a routing blocking layer is drawn on the 
entire area of the circuit, then the layer is cut with the minimum distance accuracy in 
the areas where there are routed metals (Fig. 6.43). The routing barriers obtained in 
this process have a rather complex structure. They consist of different pieces and 
have a non-standard appearance. For this reason, they go through another process 
and are divided into “long” and “high” quadrangles [53]. The coordinates of the 
resulting quadrilaterals are saved as domains to be ﬁlled, and the routing constraints 
are deleted [97, 98].

barriers

328

Design of Digital Integrated Circuits by Improving the Characteristics. . .
When the coordinates of the areas to be ﬁlled are already known, the next step is 
to identify the power and/or grounding wires located near them or crossing them. It is 
important for this process that the rectangle to be ﬁlled in:
.
The area meets the minimum requirements of the given metal layer.
.
The width and length should be greater than the sum of dimensions of minimum 
thickness and distance for the given metal layer. 
All ﬁllable quadrilaterals that meet the speciﬁed conditions are marked as possi-
ble power and grounding domains. 
In the next step, already marked domains are given a special attribute—“owner.” 
This indicates which wire the speciﬁed domain should be connected to later: power 
or ground. In order to connect the domain metals to any wire, it is important that:
.
It is close to the given wire or has overlap.
.
Its addition does not lead to maximum density problems. 
Since one power or ground wire may be adjacent to or overlap multiple ﬁller 
metals, a wire-to-delta distance is deﬁned between the wire and the center of gravity 
of the ﬁller domain. The ﬁller domains are then classiﬁed by delta distance. After 
that, the method physically connects the power and ground wires to metals of the ﬁll 
domain, according to the already mentioned “owner” characteristic. To maintain the 
total density, the method also records the current metal density in memory 
[99, 100]. At the end, additions are added to the remaining free domains to maintain 
the minimum density rules by calculating timing conditions [53]. At the end of the 
design, the output information is the physical description of the design containing 
metal ﬁllings (Fig. 6.44).

Thus, as a result of using the proposed method, it is possible to add additional 
metals to the already placed and routed circuit. Added metals are attached to the 
power or ground wires, as appropriate. This makes it possible to reduce the voltage 
drop in the circuit due to the creation of a protective effect on the wires. 
Evaluating the Effectiveness of Adding Metal Filler Method for IC Design Flow 
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, ﬁve types of designs were 
implemented, using three different methods: standard, presented in [53], and using 
the proposed method. All experiments were performed on a Linux machine with 
4 cores each at 3.4 GHz. The general comparative results are given in Table 6.10. A  
comparison of voltage drop values of the circuit was also made for standard and 
recommended approaches (Table 6.11). 
Thus, using the method of adding metal ﬁllers for IC design ﬂow, it is possible to 
obtain an approximate 11.9% reduction in the voltage drop on the power and ground 
wires of the circuit. However, as a result of added metal additions, the overall circuit 
capacitance increases by approximately 4.4%, and the tool process time increases by 
27.8% as a result of additional processes. 
Conclusions 
1. A method of improving access to I/O standard cells with an experimental design 
was proposed, in which case, due to special logical synthesis, placement, and 
routing using all cells in the library, a reduction of veriﬁcation time by approx-
imately 9.4 times was obtained, at the expense of only 11.2% reduction of 
matching cases. 
2. An enhanced machine learning I/O cell accessibility prediction and design opti-
mization method was proposed, in which, due to consideration of inter-cell 
distance constraints, the number of design rule violations decreased by approx-
imately 47% at the expense of approximately 23% increase in machine time. 
3. A method of optimizing standard cells for designs with elements of different 
heights has been developed, in which, due to their simultaneous application, an 
average optimization of approximately 14.3% of timing parameters of the circuit 
has been obtained, at the expense of only approximately 12.8% loss in power 
consumption. 
4. A “sleep mode” integration method based on low-power design and the use of 
neural networks was proposed, in which, due to the introduction of a controlled 
power network of cells, an average reduction of approximately 12% of power 
consumption was provided at the expense of approximately 5–28% increase in 
IC area. 
5. A method of adding metal ﬁllers to the design of integrated circuits was devel-
oped, in which, due to the connection of special ﬁller layers to power and ground 
buses, an average voltage drop reduction of approximately 11.9% was obtained at 
the expense of an approximately 4.4% increase in the parasitic capacitance of the 
circuit.
