The aim of Synthese Library is to provide a forum for the best current work in the 
methodology and philosophy of science and in epistemology, all broadly under-
stood. A wide variety of different approaches have traditionally been represented in 
the Library, and every effort is made to maintain this variety, not for its own sake, but 
because we believe that there are many fruitful and illuminating approaches to the 
philosophy of science and related disciplines. 
Special attention is paid to methodological studies which illustrate the interplay of 
empirical and philosophical viewpoints and to contributions to the formal (logical, 
set-theoretical, mathematical, information-theoretical, decision-theoretical, etc.) 
methodology of empirical sciences. Likewise, the applications of logical methods 
to epistemology as well as philosophically and methodologically relevant studies in 
logic are strongly encouraged. The emphasis on logic will be tempered by interest in 
the psychological, historical, and sociological aspects of science. In addition to 
monographs Synthese Library publishes thematically uniﬁed anthologies and edited 
volumes with a well-deﬁned topical focus inside the aim and scope of the book 
series. The contributions in the volumes are expected to be focused and structurally 
organized in accordance with the central theme(s), and should be tied together by an 
extensive editorial introduction or set of introductions if the volume is divided into 
parts. An extensive bibliography and index are mandatory.
