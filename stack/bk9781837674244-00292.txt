s Orbital
An s orbital is an atomic orbital with l ¼ 0. A consequence of it having
no angular momentum and therefore no angular nodes is that it has
nonzero probability amplitude at the nucleus. An s orbital has a
spherical boundary surface centred on the nucleus (Figure S.1). If it
belongs to a shell with quantum number n, it has n – 1 radial nodes.
s Orbital
A s orbital is a molecular orbital that has cylindrical symmetry and
therefore zero orbital angular momentum around the internuclear
axis of the atoms it joins (Figure S.2). Two electrons in a s orbital with
paired spins constitute a s bond. In valence bond theory, a s bond
arises from the pairing of electrons in atomic orbitals with cylindrical
symmetry about the internuclear axis.

Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy
Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is the study of surfaces with
atomic resolution by making use of the ability of electrons to tunnel
across a narrow gap. In one variety of the technique, a platinum,
rhodium, or tungsten needle with a fine point is attached to a
piezoelectric ceramic rod, which expands and contracts in response to
an applied potential diﬀerence. Electrons tunnel across the gap be-
tween the needle tip and the surface and the resulting current is
monitored. In the adaptation atomic force microscopy (AFM), the force
between needle point and atoms on the surface is monitored and
interpreted in terms of the variation in height of the surface. An ad-
vantage of AFM over STM is that the surface need not be electrically
conducting.
Scattering Cross-section
In collision theory, the scattering cross-section (or collision cross-section, s)
is the area presented by a target molecule to an incoming projectile
molecule such that a ‘collision’ is counted if the centre of the latter
molecule passes through the area. If the diameters of the two molecules
treated as hard spheres are dA and dB (Figure S.3), then
s ¼ pd2;
d ¼ 1
2 (dA þ dB)
In molecular beam studies, the diﬀerential scattering cross-section, s,
is the constant of proportionality between the intensity of molecules,
dI, that are scattered and the intensity of the incident beam, I, the
number density of target molecules, N , and the path length, dx,
through the medium:
dI ¼ sIN dx

Schrödinger Equation
The Schrödinger equation is a (partial) diﬀerential equation for calcu-
lating the wavefunctions of quantum mechanical systems. The time-
dependent Schrödinger equation is
bHC(r; t) ¼ iˉh @C(r; t)
@t
where bH is the Hamiltonian operator for the system (and r stands
for the spatial coordinates of all the particles in the system). It is used
to calculate the variation with time of the wavefunction. If the
Hamiltonian is independent of time, the wavefunction can be calcu-
lated from the time-independent Schrödinger equation:
bHc(r) ¼ Ec(r);
C(r; t) ¼ c(r)eiEt=ħ
In each case the wavefunction must satisfy the appropriate initial (in
time) and boundary (in space) conditions. The time-independent
equation can be regarded as an eigenvalue equation in which the
wavefunction is the eigenfunction and E is the corresponding eigen-
value of the Hamiltonian operator.
The time-independent equation is normally written in the position
representation, and for a particle of mass m in a one-dimensional
region where its potential energy is V(x) is

þ V(x)c(x) ¼ Ec(x)
In three dimensions
 ˉh2

In certain cases (among them when V ¼ 0 or is centrosymmetric), the
partial diﬀerential equation can be separated into ordinary diﬀer-
ential equations. See spherical polar coordinates for the form of the
laplacian operator (r2) in cartesian and spherical polar coordinates.
For examples of the solutions of the Schrödinger equation; see
harmonic oscillator, hydrogenic atoms, and particle in a box. Many-
electron systems must be solved numerically: see self-consistent
field.

Schultze–Hardy Rule
The empirical Schultze–Hardy rule states that hydrophobic colloids are
flocculated most eﬃciently by ions of opposite charge type and high
charge number.
Second Law of Thermodynamics
The Second law of thermodynamics has a variety of formulations. Two
observation-based statements (Figure S.8) are
1. Kelvin statement: no process is possible in which the sole result is
the absorption of heat from a reservoir and its complete con-
version into work.
2. Clausius statement: no process is possible in which the sole result
is the transfer of energy from a cooler to a hotter body.
These formulations inspired the introduction of the entropy as a
state function and the equivalent statement of the Second law in the
form:
3. A spontaneous process in an isolated system is accompanied by
an increase in entropy.
A spontaneous process is one that can occur without work needing to
be done in the surroundings to bring it about. This statement leaves
open the possibility that in one region of the isolated system there
might be a decrease in entropy, provided that elsewhere in the system
the entropy increases in compensation.
The molecular interpretation of the thermodynamic statement is
based on the identification of entropy with molecular disorder: an
increase in disorder can stem from the chaotic dispersal of matter

and the chaotic dispersal of energy. Thus, the Second law is an ex-
pression of the view that chaotic dispersal is natural and that the
emergence of order is unnatural.
Second-order Reaction
A second order reaction is one with a rate, v, proportional to the square
of the concentrations of the reactants, A:
v ¼ kr A
½ 2
A reaction between the reactants A and B is overall second-order if its
rate law is
v ¼ kr A

the particles (their volume divided by their mass). For spherical mol-
ecules of radius a that obey Stokes’ law in a solvent of viscosity Z,
f ¼ 6pZa

Selection Rule
A selection rule is a specification of the allowed spectroscopic transi-
tions of an atom or molecule. A gross selection rule is a statement
about the general properties that a molecule must possess in order to
undergo a certain class of transitions. Thus, the gross selection rule
for rotational transitions is that a molecule must be polar, and for
rotational Raman transitions a molecule must have an anisotropic
polarizability. A specific selection rule is a statement about the changes
that may occur in terms of quantum numbers or other labels of the
states of an atom or molecule. The following specific selection rules
are often encountered for transitions that occur by an electric dipole
mechanism:
1. Atomic transitions: Dl ¼ 1; DL ¼ 0, 1; DS ¼ 0; DJ ¼ 0, 1
2. Vibrational transitions (infrared and Raman): Dv ¼ 1
3. Rotational transitions (microwave, branch structure of vibra-
tional transition): DJ ¼ 0, 1

4. Rotational transitions (Raman): Dl ¼ 0, 2 for linear rotors;
Dl ¼ 0, 1, 2; DK ¼ 0 for symmetric rotors
5. Electronic transitions: g-u and u-g (the Laporte selection rule).
In most cases these rules can be traced to the spin (S ¼ 1) of the
photon and the conservation of angular momentum. They are es-
tablished by considering the relevant transition dipole moment and
noting the criteria for it to be nonzero either by using the properties of
the relevant mathematical functions or in terms of group theory. In
the latter case, the transition dipole moment is zero unless the inte-
grand spans the fully symmetric irreducible representation of the
molecular point group.
Self-consistent Field Method
A self-consistent field method (an SCF method) is an iterative com-
putational procedure that continues until certain calculated prop-
erties remain unchanged in a cycle (to within a predetermined
criterion). It is commonly applied to the numerical solution of the
Schrödinger equation for many-electron atoms and molecules,
when it is commonly referred to as a Hartree–Fock method (HF
method, or HF-SCF method). The method typically begins by pro-
posing the wavefunctions to be used in the calculation (such as
various atomic orbitals with variable parameters or linear combin-
ations with variable coeﬃcients). The potential energy of all the elec-
trons is calculated using the electron distribution characteristic of that
basis and a numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation is found for
one of the electrons. The procedure is continued for all the electrons in
the molecule and a refined set of orbitals is obtained. The refined set of
orbitals will in general diﬀer from the original orbitals, and the pro-
cedure is continued until no significant change occurs in the course of
one iteration. At that stage, the orbitals are self-consistent and are ac-
cepted as the best solution for the system.
Semi-empirical Method
In a semi-empirical method, certain integrals that occur in a numerical
solution of the Schrödinger equation for a many-electron system are
either ignored (according to various criteria) or approximated by
empirical data. For instance, various integrals may be adjusted to
optimize the calculation of enthalpies of formation.

Separation of Variables
In the separation of variables procedure, a partial diﬀerential equation
in several variables is separated into a series of (possibly linked) or-
dinary diﬀerential equations in each variable. For example, a two-
dimensional particle-in-a-box system for which the wavefunctions
depend are functions of x and y, can be expressed as c(x,y) ¼ c(x)c(y)
and the Schrödinger equations for c(x) and c(y) solved separately.
Similarly, the system of a proton and an electron can be separated
into equations for the translational motion of the centre of mass of
the joint system and another for the motion of a particle with a re-
duced mass around that centre of mass. Moreover, the latter motion,
which is described by the wavefunction c(r,y,f) can be separated
further into radial and angular factors: c(r,y,f) ¼ c(r)c(y)c(f), each
of which satisfies an ordinary diﬀerential equation; in this case the
three solutions are linked and consequently the quantum numbers
that arise have ranges of values that depend on each other (for in-
stance, l ¼ 0, 1,. . ., n  1). The viability of the separation of variables
procedure depends on the form of the potential energy of the system.
Shell
The shell of an atom consists of all the n2 orbitals with the same
principal quantum number, n. A closed shell is a shell in which all the
orbitals are doubly occupied by electrons. This definition is some-
times relaxed when d orbitals are available and incompletely
occupied.
Shielding
Shielding is the modification of a field. An important example is the
role of inner-shell electrons in shielding the electric field due to the
nucleus of an atom. Thus, an electron (the ‘test electron’) in a many-
electron atom is repelled by all the other electrons, and its net
attraction to the nucleus is thereby reduced. Note that the other
electrons do not actually ‘shield’ the field of the nucleus: they simply
provide an opposing contribution to the total experienced by the test
electron. If the shielding electrons are distributed spherically, and the
test electron is at a radius r, then it experiences a net repulsion only
from the electrons within a sphere of radius r (Figure S.10). The net

attraction to the nucleus is expressed by replacing the actual nuclear
charge, Ze, by the eﬀective nuclear charge, Zeﬀe. See penetration.
Singlet and Triplet States
A singlet state is an atomic or molecular state with total electron spin
quantum numbers S ¼ 0, MS ¼ 0; a triplet state is one with S ¼ 1,
MS ¼ 0, 1. The spin wavefunctions for two electrons in these states
are as follows:
MS ¼ 1
MS ¼ 0
MS ¼ þ1

21=2 {a(1)b(2) þ b(1)a(2)}
a(1)a(2)
Figure S.11 shows the vector model representations of these
combinations.
Singlet states of two electrons (and therefore with ‘paired’ spins) are
commonly represented as km and triplet states (with two ‘unpaired’
electrons) as mm. An atom with a singlet term has one level ( J ¼ L) and
one with a triplet term, provided L40, has three levels ( J ¼ L þ 1,
L, L  1).
A triplet term of a given configuration is typically lower in energy
than the singlet term of the same configuration. See Hund’s rules.
Electric dipole transitions between singlets and triplets are forbidden.
Transitions between them are enabled by spin–orbit coupling. See
intersystem crossing and phosphorescence.

Smectic Phase
A smectic phase is a liquid-crystalline mesophase in which molecules
are ordered in two dimensions but not in a third (Figure S.12).
Solubility
The solubility of a substance in a specified solvent is the concentration
of solute in a saturated solution. A saturated solution is one in which
the dissolved and undissolved solute are in dynamic equilibrium. For

solute in terms of its mole fraction is given by

practice, the identity of the solvent is also important. The solubility
curves in Figure S.13 are labelled with the value of DfusH-/RTf.

where the aJ are the (dimensionless) activities in a saturated solution.
In elementary applications, the activities are replaced by [J]/c-:

This approximation is particularly hazardous in solutions of electro-
lytes as the interactions between ions are so strong.
Space Quantization
Space quantization is the restriction of the component of an angular
momentum to discrete values mjh, with mj ¼ j, j  1,. . ., j, and
therefore in the vector model with the vector representing the angular
momentum at discrete angles to the z-axis.

Spin
Spin is the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle. Each funda-
mental particle has a characteristic, unchangeable spin, with spin
quantum number s. The magnitude of the spin is {s(s þ 1)}1/2h and its
z-components are msh, with ms ¼ s, s – 1,. . ., s. The spin of nuclei is
specified similarly, with quantum numbers I and mI. Fundamental
particles and nuclei with integer spin quantum number are bosons;
those with half-integer spin quantum number are fermions. Particles
with nonzero spin and nonzero mass have a magnetic moment;
particles with spin quantum number greater than 1
2 may also have an
electric quadrupole moment.
Electrons and protons have s ¼ 1
2 and therefore ms ¼ 1
2. Those with
ms ¼ þ1
2 are commonly denoted either m or a; those with ms ¼ 1
2 are
likewise denoted wither k or b. See photon, for its spin properties.
The total spin angular momentum of a many-electron atom is de-
noted S, MS, with S obtained by using a Clebsch–Gordan series. See
singlet and triplet states.
Spin Correlation
Spin correlation is the quantum mechanical tendency for electrons
with parallel spins to stay apart. If two electrons are in spatial
orbitals ca and cb with parallel spins (aa, for instance), then ac-
cording to the Pauli principle, their overall antisymmetrical wave-
function is
c(1; 2) ¼ {ca(r1)cb(r2)  ca(r2)cb(r1)}a(1)a(2)
This function approaches zero as r2 - r1, so there is zero probability
of finding the electrons in the same region of space. See Hund’s
rules.

Spin Echo
A spin echo is a pulse of magnetization that arises when individual
nuclear magnetic moments come back into phase after having dis-
persed after an earlier pulse. To produce a spin echo, a pulse of
magnetic field is applied in the x-direction and the magnetization
vector is rotated through 908 into the xy-plane (Figure S.16). The in-
dividual spins fan out on account of their slightly diﬀerent Larmor
frequencies. After an interval, a 1808 pulse is applied in the y-dir-
ection. Now the spins begin to regroup and reassemble into a mag-
netization vector that give a pulse, the echo, in a detector. The
amplitude of the echo decays exponentially with a time constant
equal to the transverse relaxation time, T2.
Spin–Orbit Coupling
Spin–orbit coupling is the magnetic interaction between the spin and
orbital angular momenta of an electron in an atom or molecule. The
contribution to the Hamiltonian that represents the interaction has
the form
bHso ¼ hc(~A=ˉh2)bl  bs
where ~A is the spin–orbit coupling constant (here, a wavenumber). The
interaction removes the degeneracy of levels with diﬀerent total an-
gular momenta. In a hydrogenic atom when the spin, orbital, and
total angular momentum quantum numbers are s, l, and j, the

energies of the levels of the term
2{l}j, the eigenvalues of the
Hamiltonian, are
El;s;j ¼ 1
2 hc~A{ j( j þ 1)  l(l þ 1)  s(s þ 1)}
and the constant for a hydrogenic atom of atomic number Z is
~A ¼
Z4e2ˉh
16p2e0m2

where a is the fine-structure constant and ~RN is the Rydberg constant.
For a many-electron atom the energies of the levels of the term
2S11{L}J are similarly of the form
EL;S;J ¼ 1
2 hc~A{ J( J þ 1)  L(L þ 1)  S(S þ 1)}
with ~A now a characteristic of the atom. A general rule is that the
lowest level of an atom of a given term is the level with the lowest
value of J (Figure S.17). The opposite is true for an atom with a shell
that is more than half full, when the lowest level is that with the
highest value of J.
The spin–orbit coupling constant increases strongly with atomic
number, so it is most important in heavy atoms. Spin–orbit coupling is
also responsible for the process of intersystem crossing and the
breakdown of the selection rule DS ¼ 0 in electronic transitions.
Spin–Spin Coupling
Spin–spin coupling is a coupling between nuclear spins; it gives rise to
the fine structure of NMR spectra. The interaction between nuclei A
and B is commonly written
bHspin–spin ¼ h( J=ˉh2)bIA  bIB

with J here a frequency. When only the z-components of the nuclear
spin angular momenta need be considered, their energies (the
eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian with only the bIzAbIzB term remaining)
are
E ¼ hJmI;AmI;B
If J40, the lower energy is obtained if the spins are antiparallel (that
is, the mI have opposite signs).
The coupling constant for nuclei A and B that are separated by N
bonds is denoted NJAB. Its magnitude depends on a variety of factors
as well as the value of N. These factors include the angles that the
intervening bonds make with each other (see Karplus equation) and
the hybridization of the intervening atoms. The mechanism of
coupling is a combination of the non-Coulombic interaction between
electrons and the bond and spin correlation: see polarization
mechanism.
Spontaneous Process
A spontaneous process is a change that can occur without an external
agency having to do work to bring it about. Spontaneity in thermo-
dynamics is a tendency which might not be realized in practice due to
kinetic considerations. A process is spontaneous if the total entropy
change that accompanies it is positive: DStotal40. At constant tem-
perature and pressure, a spontaneous process is accompanied by a
decrease in Gibbs energy (of the system): DGo0. See also Einstein
coeﬃcients.
Standard Ambient Temperature and Pressure
Standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP) is 298.15 K and
1 bar. Distinguish it from standard temperature and pressure (STP)
which is 0 8C and 1 atm.

Standard potentials are also widely called standard reduction potentials
to distinguish them from an earlier definition as standard oxidation
potentials (which have the opposite sign). The standard potential of

A standard potential is an indication of the relative reducing power of
the redox couple in that Red1 has a thermodynamic tendency to reduce
Ox2 if E-(Ox1; Red1) is more negative than E-(Ox2; Red2). Standard
potentials are used to predict the equilibrium constant of the corres-
ponding cell reaction:

Standard State
The standard state of a substance (denoted -) is the pure substance at 1
bar. For a gas, the standard state is a hypothetical state in which the
fugacity of the gas is 1 bar and is behaving perfectly. For a solute, the
standard state is at unit activity and behaving perfectly. Properties of a
species in its standard state and changes in which all the participants are
in their standard states are denoted X- and DX-, respectively. The
advantage of these somewhat obscure definitions is that all the

deviations from ideality due to molecular and ionic interactions are
carried by the fugacity coeﬃcient or the activity coeﬃcient, respectively.
The biochemical standard state (denoted -0) includes the requirement
that pH¼ 7. For a reaction of the form Aþ np H1(aq)-B the two
standard values of the reaction Gibbs energy are related by
DrG-0 ¼ DrG- þ 7npRT ln 10
Stark Eﬀect
The Stark eﬀect is the removal of the degeneracy of the rotational
states of polar molecules by the application of an electric field. It can
be used to determine the electric dipole moment of a molecule. Stark
modulation is the modulation of the rotational energy levels of polar
molecules by the application of an oscillating electric field and is used
in the detection of rotational transitions.
Stark–Einstein Law
The Stark–Einstein law states that one photon is absorbed by each
molecule responsible for the primary photochemical process. The law
fails when the intensity of radiation is very high.
State Function
A state function, X, is a thermodynamic property that depends only on
the current state of the system and is independent of its previous
history. State functions include the internal energy and the entropy
and properties derived from these properties, such as the enthalpy
and Gibbs energy. The diﬀerentials, dX, of state functions are exact in
the sense that the integral between two specified states is independ-
ent of the path of integration and therefore

basic concept used to evaluate averages is the ensemble, a collection of
hypothetical replications of the system, and the evaluation of the
partition function, a function that contains all the thermodynamic
information about the system. In certain idealized cases, the partition
function can be calculated from computed or spectroscopic prop-
erties of the molecules that constitute the system. See partition
function and ensemble.
Steady-state Approximation
The steady-state approximation of chemical kinetics is that the con-
centrations of all intermediates in a proposed reaction mechanism
are low and constant throughout the main part of the reaction. By
setting d[I]/dt ¼ 0, where I is an intermediate, the diﬀerential equa-
tion for its net production is turned into an algebraic equation which
can be used to formulate the overall rate law corresponding to the
proposed mechanism.
Sticking Probability
The sticking probability, s, is the proportion of collisions with a surface
that successfully lead to adsorption:
s ¼ rate of adsorption on the surface
rate of collision with the surface
In simple cases the sticking probability decreases with the extent of
surface remaining uncovered and s p 1y, where y is the fractional
coverage of the surface (Figure S.18).

Stoichiometric Coeﬃcient and Number
A stoichiometric coeﬃcient, n, is the (positive) dimensionless
coeﬃcient in a balanced chemical equation. A stoichiometric
number, nJ, is the signed, dimensionless coeﬃcient for the par-
ticipant J, with positive signs for products and negative signs for
reactants. More formally, the nJ are the numbers in the chemical
equation written as

where sJ is the chemical formula of J.
Stoichiometric Point
The stoichiometric point (formerly the closely related equivalence point)
of a titration is the point at which the stoichiometric quantity of
titrant has been added to the analyte solution. It should be dis-
tinguished from the end point, the point at which an indicator
changes colour.

Stopped-flow Technique
In the stopped-flow technique, reagents are impelled into a mixing
chamber as a piston in the chamber is withdrawn suddenly. The
composition of the chamber is then monitored. The technique is used
to study fast reactions.
Structure Factor
A structure factor, Fhkl, is the sum of the scattering factors, fi, of all the
atoms in a unit cell weighted by a phase factor that depends on their
location:
Fhkl ¼
X
i
fieifi(hkl);
fi(hkl) ¼ 2p(hxi þ kyi þ lzi) ¼ 2ph  r
The intensity of the {hkl} reflection is proportional to |Fhkl|2. For the
interpretation of diﬀraction intensities in terms of electron density in
the unit cell, see Fourier synthesis and the phase problem.
Sublimation
Sublimation is the direct conversion of a solid into a vapour. The re-
verse of sublimation is vapour deposition. The enthalpy of sublimation
is the sum of the enthalpies of fusion and vaporization at the same
temperature:
DsubH T
ð Þ ¼ DfusH T

temperature but with a density comparable to that of a normal liquid.

A supercritical fluid has properties that are intermediate between
those of a liquid and a gas.
Superfluid
A superfluid is a liquid phase of matter that flows without viscosity.
The only known examples are helium-4 and helium-3. The transition
to the superfluid phase occurs below the l-transition temperature
(Figure S.19).
Superposition
In quantum mechanics, a superposition is the addition of the prob-
ability amplitudes of an event. If the possible outcomes of obser-
vations of the event are described by the wavefunctions ci, then the
superposition is the linear combination
c ¼
X
i
cici
and the probability that the event described by ci will be observed is
proportional to |ci|2. The description of multiple possible outcomes in
terms of a superposition is a principal diﬀerence of quantum mech-
anics from classical mechanics, for in the latter it is the probabilities
that are added, not their amplitudes. The superposition of amplitudes
allows for the possibility of interference between them.
The most common application of superposition in chemistry is in
the construction of molecular orbitals as linear combinations of
atomic orbitals (LCAO) and, in valence bond theory, of resonance
hybrids.

Surface Reconstruction
Surface reconstruction is the modification of the structure of a solid
at and close to its surface, perhaps due to the attachment of an
adsorbate.
Surface Tension
The surface tension, g, of a liquid is the constant of proportionality
between the work, dw, required to create a surface and the area cre-
ated, ds:
dw ¼ gds
The dimensions of g are those of energy/area and it is normally re-
ported in either J m2 or (equivalently) N m1. At constant tempera-
ture, the work of surface formation is equal to the change in
Helmholtz energy, dA, of the system:
dA ¼ gds
For applications, see capillary action and the Kelvin equation.
svedberg (the unit)
The svedberg (Sv) is a non-SI unit encountered in sedimentation
studies of macromolecules: 1 Sv ¼ 1013 s. It is commonly used to
report the value of the sedimentation constant, S.
Symmetry Operation and Symmetry Element
A symmetry operation is an action that leaves an object apparently
unchanged. Examples are rotations, reflections, and inversions.
Translation is a symmetry operation for an infinite crystal. A symmetry
element is the point, line, or plane with respect to which the operation
is carried out. Examples are:

Reflection

Symmetry Number
A symmetry number, s, is a factor included in the high-temperature form
of a partition function to correct for the limitation on the occupation of
rotational states imposed by the Pauli principle. It is equal to the order of
the rotational subgroup of the molecular point group (in eﬀect, allowing
for that number of indistinguishable orientations); for a regular tetra-
hedron (Figure S.20), s ¼ 12. The high-temperature rotational partition
function of a homonuclear diatomic molecule is kT/hc~B if the Pauli
principle is ignored but kT/shc~B with s ¼ 2 when it is taken into account.
Symmetry Species
A symmetry species (in general, G) is the label of the irreducible rep-
resentation of a molecular point group. The letters A and B are used to
label one-dimensional irreducible representations: A is used if the
character of the principal rotation is þ1 and B is used if it is 1. The
label E denotes a two-dimensional irreducible representation and T
denotes a three-dimensional irreducible representation. In icosa-
hedral point groups, G and H are used for four- and five-dimensional
irreducible representations.
Symmetry-adapted Linear Combination
A symmetry-adapted linear combination (SALC) is a weighted sum of
atomic orbitals that is a basis for an irreducible representation of the

molecular point group (Figure S.21). Molecular orbitals are con-
structed from the overlap of an SALC with orbitals of the same sym-
metry species on other atoms. For instance, the SALC cH1sA þ cH1sB in
H2O has A1 symmetry in the C2v molecular point group and is used to
form molecular orbitals with cO2s and cO2pz, both of which have A1
symmetry.
Synchrotron Radiation
Synchrotron radiation is the high-energy electromagnetic radiation
generated by electrons moving at high speed in a circle (and therefore
ceaselessly accelerating). The radiation extends into the ultraviolet
and X-ray regions and has a higher intensity than can be achieved by
conventional sources.
System and Surroundings
In thermodynamics, a system is the object of interest, such as a gas or
a reaction mixture. The surroundings are the rest of the universe, and
often emulated by a large water bath. The classification of systems is
based on the properties of the boundary that separates them from
their surroundings (Figure S.22):
Boundary
Classification of the system
Permits neither matter nor energy to pass
Isolated
Permits energy to pass but not matter
Closed
Permits energy and matter to pass

A boundary is diathermic if it allows energy to pass as heat but
adiabatic if it does not.

Systematic Absence
In X-ray crystallography, a systematic absence is the absence of re-
flections that follow a simple rule relating to the values of the indices
hkl (Figure S.23). For example, the diﬀraction pattern from a cubic
I (bcc) lattice can be constructed from that from a cubic P lattice by
striking out all reflections with odd values of h þ k þ l. For a cubic
F (fcc) lattice, the only reflections present are those with h, k, and l all
even or all odd.
