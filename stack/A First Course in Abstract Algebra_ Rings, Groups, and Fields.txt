Preface
Traditionally, a ﬁrst course in abstract algebra introduces groups, rings, and ﬁelds, in that
order. In contrast, we have chosen to develop ring theory ﬁrst, in order to draw upon the
student’s familiarity with integers and with polynomials, which we use as the motivating
examples for studying rings.
This approach has worked well for us in motivating students in the study of abstract
algebra and in showing them the power of abstraction. Our students have found the process
of abstraction easier to understand, when they have more familiar examples to base it
upon. We introduce groups later on, again by ﬁrst looking at concrete examples, in this
case symmetries of ﬁgures in the plane and space and permutations. By this time students
are more experienced, and they handle the abstraction much more easily. Indeed, these
parts of the text move quite quickly, which initially surprised (and pleased) the authors.
This is the third edition of this text and signiﬁcant changes have been made to the second
edition. Both comments from adopters and our own experiences have prompted this. The
biggest change is in moving the section on Unique Factorization (now Section VII) further
back in the book reﬂecting that for many teaching a ﬁrst course, this topic is optional.
Doing so necessitated reorganizing the introduction of ideals. Now Sections I, II, and III
form the core material on rings, integral domains, and ﬁelds.
Sections IV and V contain the basic group theory material. We have compressed the
motivating examples of symmetries of the plane and of space into one chapter, following it
with a more detailed treatment of permutations, our other motivating example for abstract
groups. Section VI introduces more topics in group theory including new chapters on the
Sylow theorems. Sections VIII, IX, and X remain sections on Constructibility, Vector Spaces
and Field Extensions, and Galois Theory; the latter contains much edited material and many
new exercises.
The diagram below roughly indicates the dependency of the large sections.

Descriptions of Sections
Section I (Numbers, Polynomials, and Factoring) introduces the integers Z, and the
polynomials Q[x] over the rationals. In both cases we emphasize the idea of factoring into
irreducibles, pointing out the structural similarities. We also introduce the rings of integers
modulo n in this section. Induction, the most important proof technique used in the early
part of this text, is introduced in Chapter 1.
In Section II (Rings, Domains, and Fields) we deﬁne a ring as the abstract concept

Preface
encompassing our speciﬁc examples from Section I. We deﬁne integral domains and ﬁelds
and then look at polynomials over an arbitrary ﬁeld. We make the point that the important
properties of Q[x] are really due to the fact that we have coeﬃcients from a ﬁeld; this gives
students a nice example of the power of abstraction. An introduction to complex numbers
is given. We also introduce ideals in this section.
Section III (Ring Homomorphisms and Ideals) has as its main goal the proof of the Fun-
damental Isomorphism Theorem. Section III also includes a chapter about the connection
between maximal ideals and ﬁelds, and prime ideals and domains. There is also an optional
chapter on the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
Section IV (Groups) begins with two chapters on concrete examples motivating abstract
groups: symmetries of geometric ﬁgures (in the plane and in space) and permutations. We
then deﬁne abstract groups and group isomorphisms and consider subgroups and cyclic
groups.
Section V (Group Homomorphisms) deﬁnes group homomorphisms with one of its goals
the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for groups. Cayley’s and Lagrange’s theorems are
presented in this section.
Section VI (Topics from Group Theory) explores three topics: the alternating group,
the Sylow theorems, and solvable groups. The latter is needed in Section X. We use groups
acting on sets to prove the Sylow theorems, which provides not only a very accessible method
of proof but also experience with permutations from a slightly diﬀerent perspective.
In Section VII (Unique Factorization) we explore more general contexts in which unique
factorization is possible. Chapter 33 concludes with the theorem that every principal ideal
domain is a unique factorization domain. In the interest of time, many instructors may wish
to skip the last two chapters of this section.
Section VIII (Constructibility Problems) is an optional section that is a great example of
the power of abstract algebra. In it, we show that the three Greek constructibility problems
using a compass and straightedge are impossible. This section does not use Kronecker’s
Theorem and is very computational in ﬂavor. It does not depend on knowing any group
theory and can be taught immediately after Section III, if the instructor wishes to delay
the introduction of groups.
We revisit the impossibility proofs in Section IX (Vector Spaces and Field Extensions),
where we give enough vector space theory to introduce students to the theory of algebraic
ﬁeld extensions. Seeing the impossibility proofs again, in a more abstract context, empha-
sizes the power of abstract ﬁeld theory.
Section X develops Galois Theory with the goal of showing the impossibility of solving
the quintic with radicals. This section depends heavily on Section IX, as well as Chapters
27 and 30.
Each chapter includes Quick Exercises, which are intended to be done by the student as
the text is read (or perhaps on the second reading) to make sure the topic just covered is
understood. Quick Exercises are typically straightforward, rather short veriﬁcations of facts
just stated that act to reinforce the information just presented. They also act as an early
warning to the student that something basic was missed. We often use some of them as
a basis for in-class discussion. The exercises following each chapter begin with the Warm-
up Exercises, which test fundamental comprehension and should be done by all students.
These are followed by the regular exercises, which include both computational problems and
supply-the-proof problems. Answers to most odd-numbered exercises that do not require
proof are given in the Hints and Answers section. Hints, of varying depth, to odd-numbered
proof problems are also given there.
Historical remarks follow many of the chapters. For the most part we try to make use
of the history of algebra to make certain pedagogical points. We ﬁnd that students enjoy
ﬁnding out a bit about the history of the subject, and how long it took for some of the

Preface
xv
concepts of abstract algebra to evolve. We’ve relied on such authors as Boyer & Merzbach,
Eves, Burton, Kline, and Katz for this material.
We ﬁnd that in a ﬁrst (or second) course, students lose track of the forest, getting
bogged down in the details of new material. With this in mind, we’ve ended each section
with a short synopsis that we’ve called a “Nutshell” in which we’ve laid out the important
deﬁnitions and theorems developed in that section, sometimes in an order slightly altered
from the text. It’s a way for the student to organize their thoughts on the material and see
what the major points were, in case they missed them the ﬁrst time through.
We include an appendix entitled “Guide to Notation,” which provides a list of mathe-
matical notations used in the book, and citations to where they are introduced in the text.
We group the notations together conceptually. There is also a complete index, which will
enable readers to ﬁnd theorems, deﬁnitions, and biographical citations easily in the text.
Notes for the Instructor
There is more material here than can be used in one semester. Those teaching a one-
semester course may choose among various topics they might wish to include. There is
suﬃcient material in this text for a two-semester course, probably more, in most cases.
The suggested track through the text for a one-semester course is to tackle Sections I
through V (except possibly Chapter 16). We consider these chapters as the core ideas in the
text. If time permits, one could include topics from Section VI, VII, VIII, or a combination,
as to your taste.
A second semester could pick up wherever the ﬁrst semester left oﬀwith the goal of
completing Section X on Galois Theory, or else ﬁnish the remaining topics in the text.
We assume that the students using the text have had the usual calculus sequence; this
is mostly an assumption of a little mathematical maturity, since we only occasionally make
any real use of the calculus. We do not assume any familiarity with linear algebra, although
it would be helpful. We regularly use the multiplication of 2 × 2 matrices, mostly as an
example of a non-commutative operation; we ﬁnd that a short in-class discussion of this
(perhaps supplemented with some of our exercises) is suﬃcient even for students who’ve
never seen matrices before. We make heavy use of complex numbers in the text but do not
assume any prior acquaintance with them; our introduction to them in Chapters 8 and 10
should be quite adequate.
Instructors may contact the publisher for an Instructor’s Manual which contains answers
to all of the exercises, including in-depth outlines for proof problems.
Acknowledgments
Each of us has spent over thirty-ﬁve years studying, reading, teaching and doing schol-
arship in abstract algebra, and thinking about the undergraduate course in this subject.
Over the course of that time we have been inﬂuenced importantly by many textbooks on
the subject. These books have inspired us to think about what topics to include, the order
in which they might be presented, and techniques of proof and presentation. Both of us took
courses from I. N. Herstein’s text Topics in Algebra. We’ve had many occasions to look into
the classic works by Van der Waerden and Jacobson. We’ve taught and learned from texts
by such authors as Goldstein, Fraleigh, Burton, and Gallian. Burton’s text on elementary
number theory and the Maxﬁelds’ little book on Galois theory have also been important.
We oﬀer our thanks here to those mentioned, and the many inﬂuences on our approach we
cannot trace.
We owe considerable gratitude to the many people who have helped us in writing this
book. We have discussed this book informally with many of our colleagues, immeasurably
shaping the ﬁnal product. Special mention should be made of Mike Westmoreland and

Chapter 1
The Natural Numbers
All mathematics begins with counting. This is the process of putting the set of objects
to be counted in one-to-one correspondence with the ﬁrst several natural numbers (or
counting numbers):
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, · · · .
We denote by N the inﬁnite set consisting of all these numbers. Amazingly, despite the
antiquity of its study, humankind has barely begun to understand the algebra of this set.
This introduction is intended to provide you with a fund of examples and principles that
we will generalize in later chapters.
1.1
Operations on the Natural Numbers
We encounter no trouble as long as we restrict ourselves to adding natural numbers, be-
cause more natural numbers result. Accordingly we say our set is closed under addition.
However, consider what happens when we attempt to subtract a natural number a from b,
or, equivalently, we seek a solution to the equation a+x = b in the unknown x. We discover
that our set of natural numbers is inadequate to the task. This naturally leads to the set of
all integers, which we denote by Z (for ‘Zahlen,’ in German):
· · · −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, · · · .
This is the smallest set of numbers containing N and closed under subtraction.
It is easy to make sense of multiplication in N, by viewing it as repeated addition:
na = a + a + · · · + a.
|
{z
}
n times
This operation is easily extended to Z by using the sign conventions with which you are
probably familiar. Why minus multiplied by minus needs to be plus is something you might
reﬂect on now. We will return to this question in a more general context later.
We now have a whole new class of equations, many of which lack solutions: ax = b. This
leads to division, and to the rational numbers Q, which are precisely the quotients of one
integer by another. The reason why we don’t allow division by 0 is because if we let a = 0
and b ̸= 0 in the equation above, we obtain 0 = 0x = b ̸= 0. Why 0x = 0 is another question
you might reﬂect on now – we will return to this later too.
But to address the algebra of Q takes us too far aﬁeld from our present subject. For the
present we shall be more than satisﬁed in considering Z and its operations.

1.2
Well Ordering and Mathematical Induction
A fundamental property of N (which has a profound inﬂuence on the algebra of Z) is that
this set is well ordered, a property that we state formally as follows, and which we shall
accept as an axiom about N:
The Well-ordering Principle Every non-empty subset of N has a least element.
For any subset of N that we might specify by listing the elements, this seems obvious,
but the principle applies even to sets that are more indirectly deﬁned. For example, consider
the set of all natural numbers expressible as 12x + 28y, where x and y are allowed to be
any integers. The extent of this set is not evident from the deﬁnition. Yet the Well-ordering
Principle applies and thus there is a smallest natural number expressible in this way. We
shall meet this example again, when we prove something called the GCD identity in the
next chapter. (See also Exercise 9.)
Suppose we wish to apply the Well-ordering Principle to a particular subset X of N. We
may then consider a sequence of yes/no questions of the following form:
Is 1 ∈X?
Is 2 ∈X?
...
Because X is non-empty, sooner or later one of these questions must be answered yes.
The ﬁrst such occurrence gives the least element of X. Of course, such questions might not
be easily answerable in practice. But nevertheless, the Well-ordering Principle asserts the
existence of this least element, without identifying it explicitly.
The Well-ordering Principle allows us to prove one of the most powerful techniques of
proof that you will encounter in this book. (See Theorem 1.1 later in this chapter.) This is
the Principle of Mathematical Induction:
Principle of Mathematical Induction Suppose X is a subset of N that satisﬁes the
following two criteria:
1. 1 ∈X, and
2. If k ∈X for all k < n, then n ∈X.
Then X = N.
The Principle of Mathematical Induction is used to prove that certain sets X equal the
entire set N. In practice, the set X will usually be “the set of all natural numbers with
property such-and-such.” To apply it we must check two things:
1. The base case: That the least element of N belongs to X, and
2. The bootstrap: A general statement which asserts that a natural number belongs to
X whenever all its predecessors do.
You should ﬁnd the Principle of Mathematical Induction plausible because successively
applying the bootstrap allows you to conclude that
2 ∈X, 3 ∈X, 4 ∈X, · · · .
When checking the bootstrap, we assume that all predecessors of n belong to X and

Chapter 1: The Natural Numbers
5
must infer that n belongs to X. In practice we often need only that certain predecessors of
n belong to X. For instance, many times we will need only that n−1 belongs to X. Indeed,
the form of induction you have used before probably assumed only that n −1 was in X,
instead of all k < n. It turns out that the version you learned before and the version we
will be using are equivalent, although they don’t appear to be at ﬁrst glance. We will ﬁnd
the version given above of more use. (See Exercise 17.)
Before proving the Principle of Mathematical Induction itself, let us look at some simple
examples of its use.
Example 1.1
A ﬁnite set with n elements has exactly 2n subsets.
Proof by Induction:
Let X be the set of those positive integers for which this is
true. We ﬁrst check that 1 ∈X. But a set with exactly one element has two subsets,
namely, the empty set ∅and the set itself. This is 2 = 21 subsets, as required.
Now suppose that n > 1, and k ∈X for all k < n. We must prove that n ∈X.
Suppose then that S is a set with n elements; we must show that S has 2n subsets.
Because S has at least one element, choose one of them and call it s. Now every subset
of S either contains s or it doesn’t. Those subsets that don’t contain s are precisely
the subsets of S\{s} = {x ∈S : x ̸= s}. But this latter set has n −1 elements, and so
by our assumption that n −1 ∈X we know that S\{s} has 2n−1 subsets. Now those
subsets of S that do contain s are of the form A ∪{s}, where A is a subset of S\{s}.
There are also 2n−1 of these subsets. Thus, there are 2n−1 + 2n−1 = 2n subsets of S
altogether. In other words, n ∈X. Thus, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
any ﬁnite set with n elements has exactly 2n subsets.
2
Notice that this formula for counting subsets also works for a set with zero elements
because the empty set has exactly one subset (namely, itself). We could have easily in-
corporated this fact into the proof above by starting at n = 0 instead. This amounts to
saying that the set {0, 1, 2, · · ·} is well ordered too. In the future we will feel free to start an
induction proof at any convenient point, whether that happens to be n = 1 or n = 0. (We
can also start induction at, say, n = 2, but in such a case remember that we would then
have proved only that X = N\{1}.)
Example 1.2
The sum of the ﬁrst n positive odd integers is n2. That is,
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2n −1) = n2, for n ≥1.
Proof by Induction:
In this proof we proceed slightly less formally than before
and suppress explicit mention of the set X.
 Quick Exercise.
What is the set X in this proof?

Because 2 · 1 −1 = 12, our formula certainly holds for n = 1. We now assume that the
formula holds for k < n and show that it holds for n. But then, putting k = n −1, we
have
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2(n −1) −1) = (n −1)2.
Thus,
1 + 3 + 5 + · · · + (2(n −1) −1) + (2n −1)
=
(n −1)2 + (2n −1)
=
n2,
which shows that the formula holds for n. Thus, by the Principle of Mathematical
Induction, the formula holds for all n.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Students new to mathematical induction often feel that in verifying (2) they are assuming
exactly what they are required to prove. This feeling arises from a misunderstanding of the
fact that (2) is an implication: that is, a statement of the form p ⇒q. To prove such a
statement we must assume p, and then derive q. Indeed, assuming that k is in X for all
k < n is often referred to as the induction hypothesis.
Mention should also be made of the fact that mathematical induction is a deductive
method of proof and so should not be confused with the notion of inductive reasoning dis-
cussed by philosophers. The latter involves inferring likely general principles from particular
cases. This sort of reasoning has an important role in mathematics, and we hope you will
apply it to make conjectures regarding the more general principles that lie behind many of
the particular examples which we will discuss. However, for a mathematician an inductive
inference of this sort does not end the story. What is next required is a deductive proof that
the conjecture (which might have been veriﬁed in particular instances) is always true.
1.3
The Fibonacci Sequence
To provide us with another example of proof by induction, we consider a famous sequence
of integers, called the Fibonacci sequence in honor of the medieval mathematician who
ﬁrst described it. The ﬁrst several terms are
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, · · · .
You might have already detected the pattern: A typical element of the sequence is the sum
of its two immediate predecessors. This means that we can inductively deﬁne the sequence
by setting
a1
=
1,
a2
=
1, and
an+2
=
an+1 + an, for n ≥1.
This sort of inductive or recursive deﬁnition of a sequence is often very useful. However,
it would still be desirable to have an explicit formula for an in terms of n. It turns out that
the following surprising formula does the job:
an = (1 +
√
5)n −(1 −
√
5)n
2n√
5
.
At ﬁrst (or even second) glance, it does not even seem clear that this formula gives integer
values, much less the particular integers that make up the Fibonacci sequence. You will
prove this formula in Exercise 13. The proof uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
because the Fibonacci sequence is deﬁned in terms of its two immediate predecessors. We
now prove another simpler fact about the Fibonacci sequence:
Example 1.3
an+1 ≤2an, for all n ≥1.
Proof by Induction:
This is trivially true when n = 1. In the argument which
follows we rely on two successive true instances of our formula—as might be expected

Chapter 1: The Natural Numbers
7
because the Fibonacci sequence is deﬁned in terms of two successive terms. Conse-
quently, you should check that the inequality holds when n = 2.

We now assume that ak+1 ≤2ak for all k < n, where n > 2. We must show that
this inequality holds for k = n. Now
an+1 = an + an−1 ≤2an−1 + 2an−2,
where we have applied the induction hypothesis for both k = n −1 and k = n −2. But
because an−1 + an−2 = an, we have an+1 ≤2an, as required. 2

Well Ordering Implies Mathematical Induction
We now prove the Principle of Mathematical Induction, using the Well-ordering Principle.
Theorem 1.1 The Well-ordering Principle implies the Principle of Mathematical Induc-
tion.
Proof:
Suppose that X is a subset of N satisfying both (1) and (2). Our strategy for
showing that X = N is ‘reductio ad absurdum’ (or ‘proof by contradiction’): We assume
the contrary and derive a contradiction.
In this case we assume that X is a proper subset of N, and so Y = N\X is a non-empty
subset of N. By the Well-ordering Principle, Y possesses a least element m. Clearly m ̸= 1 by
(1). All natural numbers k < m belong to X because m is the least element of Y . However,
by (2) we conclude that m ∈X. But now we have concluded that m ∈X and m /∈X; this
is clearly a contradiction. Our assumption that X is a proper subset of N must have been
false. Hence, X = N.
2
The converse of this theorem is also true (see Exercise 16).
1.5
The Axiomatic Method
Our careful proof of the Principle of Mathematical Induction from the Well-ordering Princi-
ple is part of a general program we are beginning in this chapter. We wish eventually to base
our analysis of the arithmetic of the integers on as few assumptions as possible. This will be
an example of the axiomatic method in mathematics. By making our assumptions clear and
our proofs careful, we will be able to accept with conﬁdence the truth of statements about
the integers which we will prove later, even if the statements themselves are not obviously
true. We eventually will also apply the axiomatic method to many algebraic systems other
than the integers.
The ﬁrst extended example of an axiomatic approach to mathematics appears in The
Elements of Euclid, who was a Greek mathematician living circa 300 B.C. In his book he
developed much of ordinary plane geometry by means of a careful logical string of theorems,

based on only ﬁve axioms and some deﬁnitions. The logical structure of Euclid’s book is
a model of mathematical economy and elegance. So much mathematics is inferred from so
few underlying assumptions!
Note of course that we must accept some statements without proof (and we call these
statements axioms)—for otherwise we’d be led into circular reasoning or an inﬁnite regress.
One cost of the axiomatic method is that we must sometimes prove a statement that
already seems ‘obvious’. But if we are to be true to the axiomatic method, a statement we
believe to be true must either be proved, or else added to our list of axioms. And for reasons
of logical economy and elegance, we wish to rely on as few axioms as possible.
Unfortunately, we are not yet in a position to proceed in a completely axiomatic way.
We shall accept the Well-ordering Principle as an axiom about the natural numbers. But
in addition, we shall accept as given facts your understanding of the elementary arithmetic
in Z: that is, addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In Chapter 6, we will ﬁnally be able
to enumerate carefully the abstract properties which make this arithmetic work. The role
of Z as a familiar, motivating example will be crucial.
The status of division in the integers is quite diﬀerent. It is considerably trickier (because
it is not always possible). We will examine this carefully in the next chapter.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the natural numbers N and emphasized the following facts
about this set:
• N is closed under addition;
• Multiplication in N can be deﬁned in terms of addition, and under this deﬁnition N
is closed under multiplication;
• The Well-ordering Principle holds for N.
We then used the Well-ordering Principle to prove the Principle of Mathematical Induc-
tion and provided examples of its use.
We also introduced the set Z of all integers, as the smallest set of numbers containing
N that is closed under subtraction.

the cow back and remove another cow. (We can do so because n > 1.) The remaining

Chapter 2
The Integers
In this chapter we analyze how multiplication works in the integers Z, and in particular
when division is possible. This is more interesting than asking how multiplication works in
the rational numbers Q, where division is always possible (except for division by zero).
We all learned at a very young age that we can always divide one integer by another
non-zero integer, as long as we allow for a remainder. For example, 326 ÷ 21 gives quotient
15 with remainder 11. The actual computation used to produce this result is our usual long
division. Note that the division process halts when we arrive at a number less than the
divisor. In this case 11 is less than 21, and so our division process stops. We can record the
result of this calculation succinctly as
326 = (21)(15) + 11, where 0 ≤11 < 21.
2.1
The Division Theorem
The following important theorem describes this situation formally. This is the ﬁrst of many
examples in this book of an existence and uniqueness theorem: We assert that something
exists, and that there is only one such. Both assertions must be proved. We will use induction
for the existence proof.
Theorem 2.1
Division Theorem for Z
Let a, b ∈Z, with a ̸= 0. Then there exist
unique integers q and r (called the quotient and remainder, respectively), with 0 ≤r < |a|,
such that b = aq + r.
Proof:
We ﬁrst prove the theorem in case a > 0 and b ≥0. To show the existence of q
and r in this case, we use induction on b.
We must ﬁrst establish the base case for the induction. You might expect us to check
that the theorem holds in case b = 0 (the smallest possible value for b). But actually, we
can establish the theorem for all b where b < a; for in this case the quotient is 0 and the
remainder is b. That is, b = a · 0 + b.
We may now assume that b ≥a. Our induction hypothesis is that there exist a quotient
and remainder whenever we attempt to divide an integer c < b by a. So let c = b −a. Since
c < b we have by the induction hypothesis that c = aq′ + r, where 0 ≤r < a. But then
b = aq′ + r + a = a(q′ + 1) + r, where 0 ≤r < a.
We therefore have a quotient q = q′ + 1 and a remainder r.
We now consider the general case, where b is any integer, and a is any non-zero integer.
We apply what we have already proved to the integers |b| and |a| to obtain unique integers
13

14
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
q′ and r′ so that |b| = q′|a| + r′, with r′ < |a|. We now obtain the quotient and remainders
required, depending on the signs of a and b, in the following three cases:
Case (i): Suppose that a < 0 and b ≤0. Then let q = q′ + 1 and r = −a −r′. Note ﬁrst
that 0 ≤r < |a|. Now
aq + r = a(q′ + 1) + −a −r′ = aq′ + a −a −r′
= aq′ −r′ = −(|a|q′ + r′) = −|b| = b,
as required.
You can now check the remaining two cases:
Case (ii): If a < 0 and b ≥0, then let q = −q′ and r = r′.
Case (iii): If a > 0 and b ≤0, then let q = −q′ −1 and r = a −r′.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that the quotients and remainders speciﬁed in Cases (ii) and
(iii) actually work. 
Now we prove the uniqueness of q and r. Our strategy is to assume that we have two
potentially diﬀerent quotient-remainder pairs, and then show that the diﬀerent pairs are
actually the same. So, suppose that b = aq+r = aq′+r′, where 0 ≤r < |a| and 0 ≤r′ < |a|.
We hope that q = q′ and r = r′.
Since aq + r = aq′ + r′, we have that a(q −q′) = r′ −r. Now |r′ −r| < |a|, and so
|a||q −q′| = |r′ −r| < |a|. Hence, |q −q′| < 1. Thus, q −q′ is an integer whose absolute value
is less than 1, and so q −q′ = 0. That is, q = q′. But then r′ −r = a · 0 = 0 and so r′ = r,
proving uniqueness.
2
You should exercise some care in applying the Division Theorem with negative integers.
The fact that the remainder must be positive leads to some answers that may be surprising.
Example 2.1
For example, while 326 divided by 21 gives quotient 15 and remainder 11, −326 divided
by 21 gives quotient −16 and remainder 10, and −326 divided by −21 gives quotient
16 and remainder 10.
We say an integer a divides an integer b if b = aq for some integer q. In this case, we
say a is a factor of b, and write a|b. In the context of the Division Theorem, a|b means that
the remainder obtained is 0.
Example 2.2
Thus, −6|126, because 126 = (−6)(−21). Note that any integer divides 0, because
0 = (a)(0).
2.2
The Greatest Common Divisor
In practice, it may be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd the factors of a given integer, if it is large.
However, it turns out to be relatively easy to determine whether two given integers have
a common factor. To understand this, we must introduce the notion of greatest common
divisor: Given two integers a and b (not both zero), then the integer d is the
greatest

Chapter 2: The Integers
15
common divisor (gcd) of a and b if d divides both a and b, and it is the largest positive
integer that does. We will often write gcd(a, b) = d to express this relationship.
For example 6 = gcd(42, −30), as you can check directly by computing all possible
common divisors, and picking out the largest one. Because all integers divide 0, we have
not allowed ourselves to consider the meaningless expression gcd(0, 0). However, if a ̸= 0, it
does make sense to consider gcd(a, 0).
 Quick Exercise.
Argue that for all a ̸= 0, gcd(a, 0) = |a|.

But why should an arbitrary pair of integers (not both zero) have a gcd? That is, does
the deﬁnition we have of gcd really make sense? Note that if c > 0 and c|a and c|b, then
c ≤|a| and c ≤|b|. This means that there are only ﬁnitely many positive integers that could
possibly be the gcd of a and b, and because 1 does divide both a and b, a and b do have
at least one common divisor. This means that the gcd of any pair of integers exists (and is
unique).
To actually determine gcd(a, b) we would rather not check all the possibilities less than
|a| and |b|. Fortunately, we don’t have to, because there is an algorithm that determines the
gcd quite eﬃciently. This ﬁrst appears as Proposition 2 of Book 7 of Euclid’s Elements and
depends on repeated applications of the Division Theorem; we call it Euclid’s Algorithm.
We present the algorithm below but ﬁrst need the following lemma:
Lemma 2.2 Suppose that a, b, q, r are integers and b = aq + r. Then gcd(b, a) = gcd(a, r).
Proof:
To show this, we need only check that every common divisor of b and a is a
common divisor of a and r, and vice versa, for then the greatest element of this set will be
both gcd(b, a) and gcd(a, r). But if d|a and d|b then d|r, because r = b −aq. Conversely, if
d|a and d|r, then d|b, because b = aq + r.
2
We will now give an example of Euclid’s Algorithm, before describing it formally below.
This example should make the role of the lemma clear.
Example 2.3
Suppose we wish to determine the gcd of 285 and 255. If we successively apply the
Division Theorem until we reach a remainder of 0, we obtain the following:
285
=
255 · 1 + 30
255
=
30 · 8 + 15
30
=
15 · 2 + 0
By the lemma we have that
gcd(285, 255) = gcd(255, 30) = gcd(30, 15) = gcd(15, 0),
and by the Quick Exercise above, this last is equal to 15.
Explicitly, to compute the gcd of b and a using Euclid’s Algorithm, where |b| ≥|a|, we
proceed inductively as follows. First, set b0 = b, a0 = a, and let q0 and r0 be the quotient
and remainder that result when b0 is divided by a0. Then, for n ≥0, let bn = an−1 and
an = rn−1, and let qn and rn be the quotient and remainder that result when bn is divided
by an. We then continue until rn = 0, and claim that rn−1 = gcd(b, a). Setting aside for
a moment the important question of why rn need ever reach 0, the general form of the
algorithm looks like this:

16
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
b0
=
a0q0 + r0
b1
=
a1q1 + r1
...
bn−1
=
an−1qn−1 + rn−1
bn
=
anqn + 0
We can now formally show that Euclid’s Algorithm does indeed compute gcd(b, a):
Theorem 2.3 Euclid’s Algorithm computes gcd(b, a).
Proof:
Using the general form for Euclid’s Algorithm above, the lemma says that
gcd(b, a) = gcd(b0, a0) =
gcd(a0, r0) = gcd(b1, a1) =
gcd(a1, r1) = · · · =
gcd(an−1, rn−1) = gcd(bn, an) =
gcd(an, 0) = an = rn−1.
It remains only to understand why this algorithm halts. That is, why must some remain-
der rn = 0? But ai+1 = ri < |ai| = ri−1. Thus, the ri’s form a strictly decreasing sequence of
non-negative integers. By the Well-ordering Principle, such a sequence is necessarily ﬁnite.
This means that rn = 0 for some n.
2
We have thus proved that after ﬁnitely many steps Euclid’s Algorithm will produce the
gcd of any pair of integers. In fact, this algorithm reaches the gcd quite rapidly, in a sense
we cannot make precise here. It is certainly much more rapid than considering all possible
common factors case by case.
2.3
The GCD Identity
In the equations describing Euclid’s Algorithm above, we can start with the bottom equation
bn−1 = an−1qn−1 + rn−1 and solve this for gcd(b, a) = rn−1 in terms of bn−1 and an−1.
Plugging this into the previous equation, we can express gcd(b, a) in terms of bn−2 and an−2.
Repeating this process, we can eventually obtain an equation of the form gcd(b, a) = ax+by,
where x and y are integers. That is, gcd(b, a) can be expressed as a linear combination
of a and b. (Here the coeﬃcients of the linear combination are integers x and y; we will use
this terminology in a more general context later.)
Example 2.4
In the case of 285 and 255 we have the following:
15
=
255 −30(8)
=
255 −(285 −255 · 1)(8)
=
255(9) + 285(−8)

Chapter 2: The Integers
17
This important observation we state formally:
Theorem 2.4
The GCD identity for integers
Given integers a and b (not both
zero), there exist integers x and y for which gcd(b, a) = ax + by.
 Quick Exercise.
Try using Euclid’s Algorithm to compute
gcd(120, 27),
and then express this gcd as a linear combination of 120 and 27.

What we have described above is a constructive (or algorithmic) approach to expressing
the gcd of two integers as a linear combination of them. We will now describe an alternative
proof of the GCD identity, which shows the existence of the linear combination, without
giving us an explicit recipe for ﬁnding it. This sort of proof is inherently more abstract
than the constructive proof, but we are able to conclude a bit more about the gcd from
it. We will also ﬁnd it valuable when we generalize these notions to more general algebraic
structures than the integers.
Existential proof of the GCD identity:
We begin by considering the set of all linear
combinations of the integers a and b. That is, consider the set
S = {ax + by : x, y ∈Z}.
This is obviously an inﬁnite subset of Z. If the GCD identity is to be true, then the gcd
of a and b belongs to this set. But which element is it? By the Well-ordering Principle, S
contains a unique smallest positive element which we will call d.
 Quick Exercise.
To apply the Well-ordering Principle, the set S must contain at least
one positive element. Why is this true?

Since d ∈S, we can write it as d = ax0 + by0, for some particular integers x0 and y0.
We claim that d is the gcd of a and b.
To prove this, we must ﬁrst check that d is a common divisor, that is, that it divides
both a and b. If we apply the Division Theorem 2.1 to d and a, we obtain a = dq + r. We
must show that r is zero. But
r = a −dq = a −(ax0 + by0)q = a(1 −qx0) + b(−qy0),
and so r ∈S. Because 0 ≤r < d, and d is the smallest positive element of S, r = 0, as
required. A similar argument shows that d|b too.
Now suppose that c > 0 and c|a and c|b. Then a = nc and b = mc. But then ax + by =
ncx+mcy = c(nx+my), and so c divides any linear combination of a and b. Thus, c divides
d. But because c and d are both positive, c ≤d. That is, d is the gcd of a and b.
2
Example 2.5
Thus, the gcd of 12 and 28 is 4, because 4 = 12 · (−2) + 28(1) is the smallest positive
integer expressible as a linear combination of 12 and 28. We referred to this example
when introducing the Well-ordering Principle in the previous chapter; see Exercise 1.9.
We conclude from this proof the following:
Corollary 2.5 The gcd of two integers (not both zero) is the least positive linear combina-
tion of them.

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic
We are now ready to tackle the main business of this chapter: Proving that every non-zero
integer can be factored uniquely as a product of integers that cannot be further factored.
This theorem’s importance is emphasized by the fact that it is usually known as the Fun-
damental Theorem of Arithmetic. It ﬁrst appears (in essence) as Proposition 14 of Book 9
in Euclid’s Elements.
We ﬁrst need a formal deﬁnition. An integer p (other than ±1) is irreducible if whenever
p = ab, then a or b is ±1. We are thus allowing the always possible ‘trivial’ factorizations p =
(1)(p) = (−1)(−p). We are not allowing ±1 to be irreducible because it would unnecessarily
complicate the formal statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that we make
below. Because 0 = (a)(0) for any integer a, it is clear that 0 is not irreducible. Finally,
notice that if p is irreducible, then so is −p. This means that in the arguments that follow
we can often assume that p is positive.
The positive integers that are irreducible form a familiar list:
2,
3,
5,
7,
11,
13,
17, · · · .
You are undoubtedly familiar with these numbers, under the name prime integers, and it
may seem perverse for us to call them ‘irreducible’. But this temporary perversity now will
allow us to be consistent with the more general terminology we’ll use later.
We reserve the term ‘prime’ for another deﬁnition: An integer p (other than 0 and ±1)
is prime if, whenever p divides ab, then either p divides a or p divides b. (Notice that when
we say ‘or’ here, we mean one or the other or both. This is what logicians call the inclusive
‘or’, and is the sense of this word that we will always use.)
Example 2.6
For instance, we know that 2 is a prime integer. For if 2|ab, then ab is even. But a
product of integers is even exactly if at least one of the factors is even, and so 2|a or
2|b.
The prime property generalizes to more than two factors:
Theorem 2.6 If p is prime and p|a1a2 · · · an, then p|ai for some i.
Proof:
This is Exercise 5. Prove it using induction on n.
2
For the integers, the ideas of primeness and irreducibility coincide. This is the content
of the next theorem.
Theorem 2.7 An integer is prime if and only if it is irreducible.
Proof:
This theorem asserts that the concepts of primeness and irreducibility are equiva-
lent for integers. This amounts to two implications which must be proved: primeness implies
irreducibility, and the converse statement that irreducibility implies primeness.
Suppose ﬁrst that p is prime. To show that it is irreducible, suppose that p has been
factored: p = ab. Then p|ab, and so (without loss of generality) p|a. Thus, a = px, and
so p = pxb. But then 1 = xb, and so both x and b can only be ±1. This shows that the
factorization p = ab is trivial, as required.
Conversely, suppose that p is irreducible, and p|ab. We will suppose also that p does not

Chapter 2: The Integers
19
divide a. We thus must prove that p does divide b. Suppose that d is a positive common
divisor of p and a. Then, because p is irreducible, d must be p or 1. Because p doesn’t divide
a, it must be that gcd(p, a) = 1. So by the GCD identity 2.4, there exist x and y with
1 = ax + py. But then b = abx + bpy, and because p clearly divides both abx and bpy it
thus divides b, as required.
2
Again, it may seem strange to have both of the terms ‘prime’ and ‘irreducible’, because
for Z we have proved that they amount to the same thing. But we will later discover more
general contexts where these concepts are distinct.
We now prove half of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:
Theorem 2.8 Every non-zero integer (other than ±1) is either irreducible or a product of
irreducibles.
Proof:
Let n be an integer other than ±1, which we may as well suppose is positive. We
proceed by induction on n. We know that n ̸= 1, and if n = 2, then it is irreducible. Now
suppose the theorem holds true for all m < n. If n is irreducible already, we are done. If
not, then n = bc, where, without loss of generality, both factors are positive and greater
than 1. But then by the induction hypothesis both b and c can be factored as a product of
irreducibles, and thus so can their product n.
2
For example, we can factor the integer 120 as 2 · 2 · 2 · 3 · 5. Now (−5) · 2 · (−2) · 3 · 2 is
a distinct factorization of 120 into irreducibles, but it is clearly essentially the same, where
we disregard order and factors of −1. The uniqueness half of the Fundamental Theorem
of Arithmetic asserts that all distinct factorizations into irreducibles of a given integer are
essentially the same, in this sense. To prove this we use the fact that irreducible integers
are prime.
Theorem 2.9
Unique Factorization Theorem for Integers
If an integer x = a1a2 · · · an = b1b2 · · · bm where the ai and bj are all irreducible, then n = m
and the bj may be rearranged so that ai = ±bi, for i = 1, 2, · · · , n.
Proof:
We use induction on n. If n = 1, the theorem follows easily.


So we assume n > 1. By the primeness property of the irreducible a1, a1 divides one of
the bj. By renumbering the bj if necessary, we may assume a1 divides b1. So, because b1 is
irreducible, a1 = ±b1. Therefore, by dividing both sides by a1, we have
a2a3 · · · an = ±b2 · · · bm.
(Because b2 is irreducible, so is −b2, and we consider ±b2 as an irreducible factor.) We now
have two factorizations into irreducibles, and the number of ai factors is n −1. So by the
induction hypothesis n −1 = m −1, and by renumbering the bj as necessary, ai = ±bi for
i = 1, 2, · · · , n. This proves the theorem.

A Geometric Interpretation
As we have indicated already, both Euclid’s Algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of
Arithmetic have their origins in the work of the Greek geometer Euclid. It is important to
note that Euclid viewed both of these theorems as geometric statements about line segments.

20
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
To understand this requires a deﬁnition: A line segment AB measures a line segment
CD, if there is a positive integer n, so that we can use a compass to lay exactly n copies
of AB next to one another, to make up the segment CD. In modern language, we would
say that the length of CD is n times that of AB, but this notion of length was foreign to
Euclid.
Euclid’s Algorithm can now be viewed in the following geometric way: Given two line
segments AB and CD, can we ﬁnd a line segment EF, which measures both AB and CD?
In the diagram below, we see by example how Euclid’s Algorithm accomplishes this.
AB
CD
CD
CD
E1F1
CD
E1F1
E2F2
E1F1
E2F2E2F2
We can recapitulate this geometry in algebraic form, which makes the connection with
Euclid’s Algorithm clear:
AB = 3CD + E1F1,
CD = 1E1F1 + E2F2,
E1F1 = 2E2F2.
Thus, AB and CD are both measured by E2F2. In fact, CD = 3E2F2 and AB = 11E2F2.
In modern language, we would say that the ratio of the length of AB to the length of CD
is 11/3. Note that in this context Euclid’s Algorithm halts only in case this ratio of lengths
is a rational number (that is, a ratio of integers). In fact, it is possible to prove that the
ratio of the diagonal of a square to one of the sides is irrational, by showing that in this
case Euclid’s Algorithm never halts (see Exercises 14 and 15).
Euclid’s proposition that is closest to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says
that if a number be the least that is measured by prime numbers, it will not be measured
by any other prime number except those originally measuring it. This seems much more
obscure than our statement, in part because of the geometric language that Euclid uses.
Euclid’s proposition does assert that if a number is a product of certain primes, it is then
not divisible by any other prime, which certainly follows from the Fundamental Theorem,
and is indeed the most important idea contained in our theorem. However, Euclid lacked
both our ﬂexible notation, and the precisely formulated tool of Mathematical Induction, to
make his statement clearer and more modern. It wasn’t until the eighteenth century, with
such mathematicians as Euler and Legendre, that a modern statement was possible, and
a careful proof in modern form did not appear until the work of Gauss, in the early 19th
century.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we examined division and factorization in Z. We proved the Division Theorem
by induction and then used it to obtain Euclid’s Algorithm and the GCD identity. We deﬁned
the notions of primeness and irreducibility and showed that they are equivalent. We then
proved the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which asserts that all integers other than
0, 1, −1 are irreducible or can be factored uniquely into a product of irreducibles.

Chapter 3
Modular Arithmetic
In this chapter we look again at the content of the Division Theorem 2.1, only this time plac-
ing our primary interest on the remainders obtained. By adopting a slightly more abstract
point of view, we will be able to obtain some new insight into the arithmetic of Z.
3.1
Residue Classes
For any positive integer m and integer a, the residue of a modulo m is the remainder
one obtains when dividing a by m in the Division Theorem. (We will frequently write ‘mod
m’ for ‘modulo m’.)
Example 3.1
The residue of 8 (mod 5) is 3. The residue of −22 (mod 6) is 2.
Of course, many integers have the same residue (mod m). Given an integer a, the set of
all integers with the same residue (mod m) as a is called the residue class (mod m) of
a and denoted [a]m.
Example 3.2
For instance,
[3]5 = {. . . , −12, −7, −2, 3, 8, . . .},
and
[−22]6 = {. . . , −22, −16, −10, −4, 2, . . .}.
If [a]m = [b]m we say that a and b are congruent modulo m, and write a ≡b (mod m).
We simplify this notation to a ≡b, if it is clear what modulus m is being used.
Our intention in this chapter is to deﬁne addition and multiplication on these residue
classes to give us interesting new number systems. Before doing this we will explore more
about the classes themselves.
Notice that [3]5 consists of the list of every ﬁfth integer, which includes 3. That is,
[3]5 = {. . . , 3 + (−3)5, 3 + (−2)5, 3 + (−1)5, 3 + (0)5, 3 + (1)5, . . .}.
And similarly, [−22]6 consists of the list of every sixth integer, which includes −22. Our
ﬁrst theorem asserts that this is always true.
Theorem 3.1 [a]m = {a + km : k ∈Z}.
25

26
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Proof:
We must show that two inﬁnite sets are in fact equal. Our strategy is to show that
each of these sets is a subset of the other. For that purpose, suppose that
x ∈{a + km : k ∈Z}.
Then x = a + k0m for some k0 ∈Z. Suppose the residue (mod m) of a is r. That is, when
we divide a by m, we have remainder r. But then a = qm + r, where 0 ≤r < m and q is
some integer. Then
x = a + k0m = qm + r + k0m = (k0 + q)m + r.
But this means that the residue of x modulo m is r, and so x ∈[a]m. Thus,
{a + km : k ∈Z} ⊆[a]m.
Now let x ∈[a]m. In other words, x has the same residue (mod m) as a. Suppose that
the common residue of x and a modulo m is r, and so x = q1m + r and a = q2m + r. Then
r = a −q2m and so
x = q1m + a −q2m = (q1 −q2)m + a.
That is, x ∈{a + km : k ∈Z}, proving the theorem.
2
As our examples above suggest, this theorem says that elements in a given residue class
(mod m) occur exactly once every m integers. So, if x ∈[a]m, the next larger element
in [a]m is x + m. Hence, any m consecutive integers will contain exactly one element of
[a]m. Thus, there are exactly m residue classes (mod m), and we can choose representatives
from each class simply by picking any set of m consecutive integers. For example, we could
certainly choose the m integers 0, 1, 2, · · · , m −1 (which are of course exactly the possible
remainders from division by m). Indeed, with this conventional and convenient choice of
representatives we can specify the m distinct residue classes as [0], [1], . . . , [m −1]. These m
residue classes then partition the integers, meaning that each integer belongs to exactly
one of these classes, and if distinct classes intersect, they are in fact equal. Alternatively,
this means that
Z = [0] ∪[1] ∪[2] ∪· · · ∪[m −1],
and the sets in this union are disjoint from one another pairwise.
In particular, we have that
Z
=
[0]4 ∪[1]4 ∪[2]4 ∪[3]4
=
{. . . , −4, 0, 4, 8, . . .} ∪{. . . , −3, 1, 5, 9, . . .} ∪
{. . . , −2, 2, 6, 10, . . .} ∪{. . . , −1, 3, 7, 11, . . .}.
The next theorem provides a very useful way of determining when two integers are in the
same residue class. Indeed, we will use this characterization more often than the deﬁnition
itself.
Theorem 3.2 Two integers, x and y, have the same residue (mod m) if and only if x−y =
km for some integer k.
Proof:
First, suppose x ≡y (mod m). Then x = k1m + r, and y = k2m + r for some
integers k1 and k2 and 0 ≤r < m. But then x −y = (k1 −k2)m.
Conversely, suppose x−y = km, for some integer k with x = k1m+r1 and y = k2m+r2,
where 0 ≤r1 < m and 0 ≤r2 < m. Then
km = x −y = (k1 −k2)m + r1 −r2,

Chapter 3: Modular Arithmetic
27
which implies that r1 −r2 = (k −k1 + k2)m. Now, because r1 and r2 are both non-negative
integers less than m, the distance between them is less than m. That is, |r1 −r2| < m. So,
−m < r1 −r2 < m. But we have just shown that r1 −r2 is an integer multiple of m. Hence,
that multiple is 0. Therefore, r1 −r2 = 0 or r1 = r2.
2
Example 3.3
We have [18]7 = [−38]7 because 18 −(−38) = 56 = (7)(8).
We now consider the set of all residue classes modulo m. We denote this set by Zm.
That is,
Zm = {[0], [1], [2], · · · , [m −1]}.
Be careful to note that we are considering here a set of sets: Each element of the ﬁnite set
Zm is in fact an inﬁnite set of the form [k]. While this construct seems abstract, you should
take heart from the fact that for the most part, we can focus our attention on particular
representatives of the residue classes, rather than on the entire set.
3.2
Arithmetic on the Residue Classes
We are now ready to deﬁne an ‘arithmetic’ on Zm which is directly analogous to (and indeed
inherited from) the arithmetic on Z. By an ‘arithmetic’ we mean operations on Zm that we
call addition and multiplication.
To add two elements of Zm (that is, two mod m residue classes) simply take a repre-
sentative from each class. The sum of the two residue classes is deﬁned to be the residue
class of their sum. For instance, to add [3]5 and [4]5, we pick, say, 8 ∈[3]5 and 4 ∈[4]5. But
[8 + 4]5 = [2]5, and so [3]5 + [4]5 = [2]5. Note that any other choice of representatives would
also yield [2]5.
 Quick Exercise.
Try some other representatives of these two residue classes, and see
that the same sum is obtained. 
It is vitally important that this deﬁnition be independent of representatives chosen, for
otherwise it would be ambiguous and consequently not of much use. We will shortly prove
that this independence of representatives in fact holds. Before we do so, we ﬁrst observe
that we can deﬁne multiplication on Zm in a similar way.
More succinctly, the deﬁnition of the operations on Zm are:
[a]m + [b]m
=
[a + b]m
[a]m · [b]m
=
[a · b]m.
Thus, [4]5[3]5 = [12]5 = [2]5.
 Quick Exercise.
Try some other representatives of these two residue classes, and see
that the same product is obtained. 
We now check to see that these deﬁnitions are well deﬁned. That is, if one picks diﬀerent
representatives from the residue classes, the result should be the same. You have seen that
this worked in the example above for addition and multiplication in Z5 (at least for the
representatives you tried).

28
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Proof that operations are well deﬁned:
To show addition on Zm is well deﬁned,
consider [a] and [b]. We pick two representatives from [a], say x and y, and two representa-
tives from [b], say r and s. Now we must show that [x + r] = [y + s]. But x, y ∈[a] implies
x −y = k1m, for some integer k1. Likewise, r −s = k2m, for some integer k2. So,
x + r −(y + s) = x −y + r −s = (k1 + k2)m.
In other words, [x + r] = [y + s], which is what we wanted to show.
The proof that multiplication on Zm is also well deﬁned is similar and is left as Exercise
9.
2
We now have an ‘arithmetic’ deﬁned on Zm. To avoid cumbersome notation, it is common
to write the elements of Zm as simply 0, 1, . . . , m −1 instead of [0], [1], . . . , [m −1]. So, in
Z5, 3 + 4 = 2 and 2 + 3 = 0. (Thus, −2 = 3 and −3 = 2.) Bear in mind that the arithmetic
is really on residue classes. For the remainder of this chapter we will not omit the brackets,
although later we often will.
Example 3.4
A ﬁrst simple example of this arithmetic is in the case where m = 2. We then have
only two residue classes. In fact, [0]2 is precisely the set of even integers and [1]2 is
the set of odd integers. The addition and multiplication tables for Z2 are given below.
The addition table may be simply interpreted as ‘The sum of an even and an odd is
odd, while the sum of two evens or two odds is even.’ The multiplication table may be
interpreted as ‘The product of two integers is odd only when both integers are odd.’

Properties of Modular Arithmetic
It is illuminating to compare the arithmetic on Zm with that on Z. Later in the book (in
Chapter 6) we will meet a common abstraction of arithmetic on Z and on Zm that will
enable us to pursue this general question in more detail. For now we intend only to suggest
a few of the ideas we will meet more formally later.
Arithmetic in Z depends heavily on the existence of an additive identity or zero. Zero
has the pleasant property in Z that 0+n = n, for all integers n. Note that in Zm the residue
class [0] plays the same role because [0] + [n] = [0 + n] = [n].
Also, each integer n has an additive inverse −n in Z, an element which when added
to n gives the additive identity 0. This is the formal basis for subtraction, which enables us
to solve equations of the form a + x = b in Z (by simply adding −a to both sides). Notice
that additive inverses are available in Zm as well. For,
[k] + [m −k] = [k + m −k] = [m] = [0],

Chapter 3: Modular Arithmetic
29
and so [m −k] = [−k] serves as the additive inverse of [k]. Consequently, we can always
solve equations of the form [a] + X = [b], where here X is an unknown in Zm.
 Quick Exercise.
Solve the equation [7]12 +X = [4]12 in Z12, by using the appropriate
additive inverse. 
We can conveniently summarize the additive arithmetic in Zm for a particular m in
addition tables. (We have addition tables for m = 5 and m = 6 below.) Note that these
tables reﬂect the fact that every element of these sets has an additive inverse. (How?)

What about multiplication? In Z the integer 1 serves as a multiplicative identity,
because 1 · n = n for all integers n, and clearly [1] plays the same role in Zm.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. 
A multiplicative inverse in Zm may be deﬁned analogously to the way we have deﬁned an
additive inverse: [a] is the multiplicative inverse of [n] if [a][n] = [1]. The disadvantage
of Z as opposed to Q is that no elements have multiplicative inverses (except 1 and −1).
The consequence is that many equations of the form ax = b are not solvable in the integers.
But what about in Zm? Consider the following multiplication tables for our examples Z5

multiplication tables Z5 and Z6
Notice the remarkable fact that in Z5, every element (other than [0]) has a multiplicative
inverse. For example, the multiplicative inverse of [3] is [2], because [3][2] = [1]. Thus, to
solve the equation [3]X = [4] in Z5, we need only multiply both sides of the equation by
the multiplicative inverse of [3] (which is [2]) to obtain
X = [2][3]X = [2][4] = [3].
On the other hand, [3] has no multiplicative inverse in Z6, and there is in fact no solution
to the equation [3]X = [2] in Z6.
 Quick Exercise.
Solve the equation [4]X = [10] in Z11. Then argue that this equation
has no solution in Z12. 
We have gone far enough here to illustrate the fact that the arithmetic in Zm shares
similarities with those of Z, but also has some real diﬀerences (which depend on the choice
of m).

Historical Remarks
The great German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) ﬁrst introduced the idea
of congruence modulo m into the study of integers, in his important book Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae. Gauss made important contributions to almost all branches of mathematics
and did important work in astronomy and physics as well, but number theory (the study
of the mathematical properties of the integers) was his ﬁrst love. The Disquisitiones was
a landmark work, which systematized and extended the work on number theory done by
Gauss’s predecessors, Fermat and Euler. Gauss’s introduction of the notion of congruence
is a good example of the way in which an eﬀective and eﬃcient notation can revolutionize
the way a mathematical subject is approached.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the residue class [a]m of a modulo m (for a positive integer m)
and characterized the elements of such classes. We then considered the set Zm of the m
residue classes and deﬁned an arithmetic on this set. We proved the following facts about
this arithmetic:
• Addition and multiplication are well deﬁned;
• Zm has an additive identity [0] and a multiplicative identity [1];
• All elements in Zm have additive inverses, but not all elements have multiplicative
inverses.
Warm-up Exercises

and multiplication tables for Z3. Which elements of Z3 have multiplicative inverses?

Exercises
1. Repeat Warm-up Exercise a for modulo 8.
2. Determine the elements in Z15 that have multiplicative inverses. Give an example of
an equation of the form [a]X = [b] ([a] ̸= [0]) that has no solution in Z15.
3. In Exercise c you determined the additive inverse of [13] in Z28. Now determine its
multiplicative inverse.
4.
(a) Find an example in Z6 where [a][b] = [a][c], but [b] ̸= [c]. How is this example
related to the existence of multiplicative inverses in Z6?
(b) Repeat this in Z10.
5. If gcd(a, m) = 1, then the GCD identity 2.4 guarantees that there exist integers u and
v such that 1 = au + mv. Show that in this case, [u] is the multiplicative inverse of
[a] in Zm.
6. Now use essentially the reverse of the argument from Exercise 5 to show that if [a]
has a multiplicative inverse in Zm then gcd(a, m) = 1.
7. According to what you have shown in Exercises 5 and 6, which elements of Z24 have
multiplicative inverses? What are the inverses for each of those elements? (The answer
is somewhat surprising.)
8. Repeat the previous exercise for Z10. Give the multiplication table for those elements
in Z10 that have multiplicative inverses and ﬁnd an [n] such that all these elements
are powers of [n].
9. Prove that the multiplication on Zm as deﬁned in the text is well deﬁned, as claimed
in Section 3.2.
10. Prove that if all non-zero elements of Zm have multiplicative inverses, then multiplica-
tive cancellation holds: that is, if [a][b] = [a][c], then [b] = [c].
11. Consider the following alternate deﬁnition of addition of residue classes in Zm, by
deﬁning the set
S = {x + y : x ∈[a], y ∈[b]}.
Prove that S = [a] + [b] (as deﬁned in Section 3.2); thus, we could have used the
deﬁnition above to deﬁne addition in Zm.
12. By way of analogy with Exercise 11, one might try to deﬁne the multiplication of
residue classes in Zm by considering the set
M = {xy : x ∈[a], y ∈[b]}.
Prove that M ⊆[a][b]. Then choose particular m, a, b to show by example that this
containment can be proper (that is, M ⊂[a][b]).

Chapter 4
Polynomials with Rational Coeﬃcients
In Chapter 2 we proved that every integer (̸= 0, ±1) can be written as a product of ir-
reducible integers, and this decomposition is essentially unique. These irreducible integers
turn out to be those integers that we call primes. To summarize, in that chapter we proved
the following important theorems:
• The Division Theorem for integers (Theorem 2.1),
• Euclid’s Algorithm (which yields the gcd of two integers) (Theorem 2.3),
• The GCD identity that gcd(a, b) = ax + by, for some integers x and y (Theorem 2.4),
• Each non-zero integer (̸= ±1) is either irreducible or a product of irreducibles (Theo-
rem 2.8),
• An integer p is irreducible if and only if p is prime (that is, if p|ab, then either p|a or
p|b) (Theorem 2.7), and
• Each non-zero integer (̸= ±1) is uniquely (up to order and factors of −1) the product
of primes (Theorem 2.9).
4.1
Polynomials
In this chapter we turn our attention to another algebraic structure with which you are
familiar – the polynomials (with unknown x) with coeﬃcients from the rational numbers
Q. In this chapter and the next we discover that this set of polynomials obeys theorems
directly analogous to those we have listed above for the integers.
We denote the set of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients by Q[x]. Let’s be careful to
deﬁne exactly what we mean by a polynomial. A polynomial f ∈Q[x] is an expression of
the form
f = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn + · · ·
where ai ∈Q, and all but ﬁnitely many of the ai’s are 0. We call the ai’s the coeﬃcients
of the polynomial. When we write down particular polynomials, we will simply omit a term
if the coeﬃcient happens to be zero. Thus, such expressions as 2 + x,
4
7 + 2x2 −1
2x3, and
14 are all elements of Q[x]. Henceforth, when we wish to write down a generic polynomial,
we will usually be content with an expression of the form f = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn.
This means that we’re assuming that am = 0, for all m > n. It may of course be the case
that some of the am for m ≤n are 0 too.
We say that two polynomials are equal if and only if their corresponding coeﬃcients
are equal. Thus, 2 + 0x −x2, 2 −x2 + 0x3, and 2 −x2 are all equal polynomials. The ﬁrst
two polynomials are simply less compact ways of writing the third.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
For the most part we deal with polynomials with rational coeﬃcients, but sometimes
we wish to restrict our attention to those polynomials whose coeﬃcients are integers; we
denote this set by Z[x]. Of course Z[x] is a proper subset of Q[x].
Note that x is a formal symbol, not a variable or an indeterminate element of Q. This
is probably diﬀerent from the way you are used to thinking of a polynomial, which is as a
function from Q to Q (or from R to R). This is not how we think of them here – we think
of a polynomial as a formal expression. In fact, if we consider polynomials with coeﬃcients
taken not from Q but some other number system, two of these new polynomials can be
equal as functions but not as polynomials.
 Quick Exercise.
Consider polynomials with coeﬃcients from Z2 – denoted by Z2[x],
naturally. Show that the three diﬀerent polynomials x2 + x + 1, x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1, and
1 are indeed the same function from Z2 to Z2. (Two functions are equal if they have the
same value at all points in their domain.) 
We will nearly always think of polynomials in the formal sense. To emphasize this point
of view, when we speak of a particular polynomial we will denote it by a letter like f, rather
than writing f(x). The one time we wish to consider a polynomial as a function in this
chapter will be made explicit, and then we will refer to it as a polynomial function.
The degree of a polynomial is the largest exponent with corresponding non-zero coeﬃ-
cient. So, a polynomial of degree 0 means the polynomial can be considered an element of
Q (sometimes called a scalar). Of course, the zero polynomial has no non-zero coeﬃcients.
To cover this special case conveniently, we say that its degree is −∞. We will denote the
degree of a polynomial f by deg(f).
4.2
The Algebra of Polynomials
We can add, subtract, and multiply polynomials in the ways with which you are already
familiar: If f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn and g = b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm (let’s suppose n > m),
then
f + g
=
(a0 + b0) + (a1 + b1)x + · · ·
+(am + bm)xm + am+1xm+1 + · · · + anxn.
The diﬀerence, f −g, is similarly deﬁned. The deﬁnition of product is more diﬃcult to
write down abstractly; the following deﬁnition actually captures your previous experience
in multiplying polynomials:
f · g = a0b0 + (a0b1 + a1b0)x + · · · +
X
i+j=k
(aibj)xk + · · · + (anbm)xn+m.
That is, the coeﬃcient of xk is the sum of all the products of the coeﬃcients of xi in f with
the coeﬃcients of xj in g where i and j sum to k.
Example 4.1
If f = 3 + x4 −2x5 + x6 + 2x7 and g = −1 + 3x + x2 + 4x6, then the coeﬃcient of x6
in f · g is 3 · 4 + 1 · 1 + (−2) · 3 + 1 · (−1) = 6.

Chapter 4: Polynomials with Rational Coeﬃcients

How is degree aﬀected when we add or multiply polynomials? Your previous experience
with polynomials suggests the right answer, which is contained in the following theorem.
Theorem 4.1 Let f, g ∈Q[x]. Then
a. deg(fg) = deg(f)+deg(g), where it is understood that −∞added to anything is −∞.
b. deg(f + g) is less than or equal to the larger of the degrees of f and g.
Proof:
We prove part (a) ﬁrst. We consider ﬁrst the case where one of the polynomials
is the zero polynomial. Now, it is evident that 0g = 0, for any polynomial g. Thus,
−∞= deg(0) = deg(0g) = −∞+ deg(g),
as required.
We thus may as well assume that neither f nor g is the zero polynomial; suppose that
deg(f) = n and deg(g) = m. Then f = anxn +f1, where an ̸= 0 and deg(f1) < n. Similarly,
g = bmxm + g1, where bm ̸= 0 and deg(g1) < m. By the deﬁnition of multiplication of
polynomials, the coeﬃcient on xn+m is anbm, and this is not zero because neither factor is.
But all remaining terms in the product have smaller degree than n + m, and so
deg(fg) = n + m = deg(f) + deg(g),
as required.
 Quick Exercise.
You prove part (b). Also show by example that the degree of a
sum of polynomials can be strictly smaller than the larger of the degrees. Hint: Take two
polynomials with the same degree. 
2
An important particular case of the ﬁrst part of this theorem is this: If a product of two
polynomials is the zero polynomial, then one of the factors is the zero polynomial.
 Quick Exercise.
Prove this, using the theorem. 
4.3
The Analogy between Z and Q[x]
We will now begin to prove the theorems analogous to those proved about natural numbers
and integers and summarized above. (Actually, in this chapter, you will do some of the
proving.) You should notice, as you proceed through this chapter and the next, that not
only are the theorems similar, but so are the proofs. (You will probably even be able to
anticipate some theorems.) This suggests that the integers share properties with Q[x] that
give rise to these theorems – in particular, unique factorization. Later, we will be able to
identify these properties and prove unique factorization in a more general setting. This
process of generalization is indeed a common theme in mathematics – one sees that A and
B both have property C. What is shared by A and B that forces property C on both? For
now, we are content to consider the concrete example of Q[x] and try to build more insight
before getting abstract.
Before starting, recall that the proof technique used for most of the important theo-
rems for natural numbers is induction. When considering polynomials, we also frequently
use induction, but on the degree of the polynomial. Note that since the set of degrees of
polynomials is {−∞, 0, 1, 2, . . .}, which is well ordered, induction may be used.
We now start, as with the integers, with the Division Theorem.

36
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Theorem 4.2
Division Theorem for Q[x]
Let f, g ∈Q[x] with f ̸= 0. Then there
are unique polynomials q and r, with deg(r) < deg(f), such that g = fq + r.
Before proving this theorem, we look at an example.
The actual computation for producing q and r, for given polynomials f and g, is just
long division. For example, let f = x2 + 2x −1 and g = x4 + x2 −x + 2.
x2 −

x2 + 2x −1 x4 +

x + 2
−2x3 −4x2 +
2x
6x2 −
3x + 2
6x2 + 12x −6
−15x + 8
Hence, q = x2 −2x + 6 and r = −15x + 8. That is,
x4 + x2 −x + 2 = (x2 + 2x −1)(x2 −2x + 6) + (−15x + 8).
 Quick Exercise.
Find q and r as guaranteed by the Division Theorem for g = x5+x−1
and f = x2 + x. 
Proof of the Division Theorem:
We ﬁrst prove the existence of q and r, using induction
on the degree of g. The base case for induction in this proof is deg(g) < deg(f). If this is
the case, then g = f · 0 + g. So, q = 0 and r = g satisfy the requirements of the theorem.
We now assume that f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn and g = b0 + b1x + · · · + bmxm, and
m = deg(g) ≥deg(f) = n. Our induction hypothesis says that we can ﬁnd a quotient and
remainder whenever the dividend has degree less than m.
Let h = g−(bm/an)xm−nf. This makes sense because m ≥n. Note that the largest non-
zero coeﬃcient of g has been eliminated in h, so deg(h) < deg(g). Hence, by the induction
hypothesis, h = fq′ + r, where deg(r) < deg(f). But then,
g
=
fq′ + r + (bm/an)xm−nf
=
f(q′ + (bm/an)xm−n) + r.
Thus, q = q′ + (bm/an)xm−n and r serve as the desired quotient and remainder.
Now we prove the uniqueness of q and r by supposing that g = fq + r = fq′ + r′, where
deg(r) < deg(f) and deg(r′) < deg(f). We will show that q = q′ and r = r′.
So, because fq + r = fq′ + r′, we have that f(q −q′) = r′ −r. Because deg(f) > deg(r)
and deg(f) > deg(r′), we have deg(f) > deg(r′ −r). But deg(f(q −q′)) ≥deg(f), unless
f(q −q′) = 0. Hence, deg(f(q −q′)) > deg(r′ −r) unless both are the zero polynomial. But
this must be the case, and so f(q −q′) = 0, forcing q −q′ = 0 and r′ −r = 0, proving
uniqueness. 2
4.4
Factors of a Polynomial
We now make some deﬁnitions analogous to those we made for Z. We say a polynomial
f divides a polynomial g if g = fq for some polynomial q. In this case we say that f is

Chapter 4: Polynomials with Rational Coeﬃcients
37
a factor of g, and write f|g. In the context of the Division Theorem, f|g means that the
remainder obtained is 0. For example, (x2 + 1)|(2x3 −3x2 + 2x −3), because
2x3 −3x2 + 2x −3 = (x2 + 1)(2x −3).
Notice that any polynomial divides the zero polynomial because 0 = (f)(0).
Suppose now that a is a non-zero constant polynomial, and f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn
is any other polynomial. Then a necessarily divides f because
f = (a)
a0
a + a1
a x + a2
a x2 + · · · + an
a xn
.
In Exercise 11 you will prove that the converse of this statement is true.
4.5
Linear Factors
In practice, it may be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd all the factors of a given polynomial. However,
the following theorem shows how to determine factors of the form x −a, where a ∈Q.
Note carefully that the next theorem and its corollary are the only times in this chapter
where we think of a polynomial as a function. For f ∈Q[x] and a ∈Q, we deﬁne f(a) to be
the result that ensues when we replace x in f by a, and then apply the ordinary operations
of arithmetic in Q to simplify the result. Thus, if f = 1
3x2 −2x + 1 and a = 2, then
f(2) = 1
3(2)2 −2(2) + 1 = −5
3.
This deﬁnition obviously gives us a function f(x) which is deﬁned for all rational numbers.
Of particular interest to us is the case when f(a) = 0. We say a ∈Q is a root of f ∈Q[x]
if f(a) = 0. Thus, 2
3 is a root of g = 3x3 + 19x2 −11x −2, because g
  2

= 0.
Theorem 4.3
Root Theorem
If f is a polynomial in Q[x] and a ∈Q, then x −a
divides f if and only if a is a root of f.
Proof:
If x −a divides f, then f = (x −a)q, and so
f(a) = (a −a)q(a) = 0.
Conversely, suppose f(a) = 0. Using the Division Theorem 4.2, we write f = (x−a)q+r
where deg(r) < deg(x −a) = 1. But deg(r) < 1 means deg(r) = 0 or −∞; that is, r ∈Q.
Thus, when we view r as a function, it is a constant function. We might as well call this
constant r. Hence, f(a) = (a −a)q(a) + r. But, the left-hand side is 0 while the right-hand
side is r. Hence, r = 0, and so x −a divides f.
2
Example 4.2
Consider the polynomial
f = x4 + 2x3 + x2 + x −2.
We can conclude that f has a factor of x + 2 because f(−2) = 0. We need not go
through the trouble of long division to verify the fact.

38
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
In general, evaluating f(a) is a simpler operation than dividing f by x−a, although the
latter does have the advantage of giving the factorization if indeed x −a is a factor.
 Quick Exercise.
Check to see whether x + 2 is a factor of the following polynomials:
x3 −4x, x2 + 2x −1, and x100 −4x98 + x + 2. 
Notice that the Root Theorem 4.3 allows us to determine when any given linear factor,
ax + b (a ̸= 0), divides a polynomial f, because ax + b is a factor if and only if x + b
a is a
factor, and the Root Theorem says that this last is a factor if and only if −b
a is a root.
 Quick Exercise.
Let f ∈Q[x] and a ̸= 0. Prove that ax + b divides f if and only if
x + b
a divides f. 
Corollary 4.4 A non-zero polynomial f of degree n has at most n distinct roots in Q.
Proof:
We proceed by induction on the degree of f. If f is non-zero and degree 0, then
clearly f has no roots.
Suppose the corollary holds for polynomials with degree smaller than n, and f has
degree n > 0. If f has no roots, the theorem is proved. So, assume f has at least one
root, call it a. Then by the Root Theorem 4.3, x −a divides f. That is, f = (x −a) · g.
But deg(g) = deg(f) −1. And so, by the induction hypothesis, g has at most n −1 roots.
Because any root of f other than a must also be a root of g, f can have no more than n
roots altogether.
2
4.6
Greatest Common Divisors
We now turn our attention to ﬁnding greatest common divisors of two polynomials, par-
alleling our development for the integers. Notice that we didn’t say the greatest common
divisor. We will ﬁnd some diﬀerences from the integers here.
If f and g are two polynomials in Q[x] (not both zero), then a polynomial d in Q[x] is
a greatest common divisor (gcd) of f and g if it satisﬁes the following two criteria:
1. d divides both f and g (d is a common divisor), and
2. If a polynomial e divides both f and g, then deg(e) ≤deg(d); that is, d has largest
degree among common divisors.
Notice that according to this deﬁnition x + 1 is a gcd for x2 −1 and x2 + 4x + 3, but so are
−1
2x −1
2, −x −1, and 20x + 20. This is unlike the integer case, where we have a unique gcd
for any pair of integers (not both zero). In fact, for polynomials, we have inﬁnitely many
distinct gcds. For if a is any non-zero rational number and d is a gcd of f and g, then so
is the polynomial ad. This follows because ad is also a common divisor of f and g, and has
the same degree as d.
 Quick Exercise.
Argue that x + 1 is indeed a gcd of x2 −1 and x2 + 4x + 3 as are the
other polynomials listed. 
As with the integers, Euclid’s Algorithm, when applied to polynomials, yields a gcd. (As
you might expect, the arithmetic is messier.)

Chapter 4: Polynomials with Rational Coeﬃcients
39
Example 4.3
As an example of this, consider the polynomials
x6 −x5 + 7x4 + 5x2 + 9x −21
and
2x4 −x3 + 5x2 −3x −3.
By repeatedly applying the Division Theorem 4.2 we obtain the following:
(x6 −x5 + 7x4 + 5x2 + 9x −21) =

 Quick Exercise.
Apply Euclid’s Algorithm to the polynomials
x3 −3x2 + 5x −3 and x4 −2x3 + 4x2 −2x + 3. 
We state formally in the next theorem that Euclid’s Algorithm gives gcds in the polyno-
mial case. You should notice that the proof of this theorem is nearly identical to the proof
of the corresponding theorem (Theorem 2.3) for integers.
Theorem 4.5
Euclid’s Algorithm produces a GCD
In Euclid’s Algorithm for polynomials f and g, the last non-zero remainder is a greatest
common divisor for f and g.
Proof:
The proof of this fact for the integers depended on a lemma, which remains true
in this context. Namely, we observe that if f = gq +r, then d is a gcd of f and g if and only
if d is also a gcd of g and r. (As before, this follows because in fact every common divisor
of f and g is also a common divisor of g and r, and vice versa.)
 Quick Exercise.
Show that d is a gcd of f and g exactly if d is a gcd of g and r,
following the proof of Lemma 2.2, if necessary. 
We proceed by induction on the number of steps required for Euclid’s Algorithm to
terminate. If Euclid’s Algorithm takes one step, f = gq and so d = g, which is clearly a gcd
of f and g in this case.
So suppose Euclid’s Algorithm takes n (> 1) steps to obtain d with the ﬁrst two steps
being
f
=
gq0 + r0
g
=
r0q1 + r1
Performing Euclid’s Algorithm on g and r0 also yields d; the process is exactly the last

40
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
n −1 steps of Euclid’s Algorithm for f and g. But then by the induction hypothesis, d is a
gcd of g and r0, and so, by the lemma, d is a gcd of f and g.
2
We observed above that if d is a gcd of f and g, then so is any non-zero scalar multiple
of d. The converse is also true. That is, if d is any gcd of two polynomials, then all the gcds
are simply scalar multiples of d. This follows from the next theorem.
Theorem 4.6 If d is the gcd of f and g produced by Euclid’s Algorithm and e is another
common divisor of f and g, then e divides d.
Proof:
The proof of this theorem is nearly identical to the proof that Euclid’s Algorithm
produces a gcd. The only real addition is that we also check that e divides what it is
supposed to. Again, we use induction on n, the number of steps in Euclid’s Algorithm when
obtaining d.
If Euclid’s Algorithm takes one step, then f = gq, and so d = g. Clearly, if e divides f
and g(= d), then e divides d.
Now, suppose Euclid’s Algorithm takes n(> 1) steps to obtain d, with the ﬁrst two steps
being
f
=
gq0 + r0
g
=
r0q1 + r1.
Because r0 = f −gq0, if e divides f and g, e also divides r0. Now d is also the gcd of
g and r0 obtained from Euclid’s Algorithm. The process is the last n −1 steps of Euclid’s
Algorithm for f and g. So, by the induction hypothesis, because e divides g and r0, it also
divides d.
2
An important consequence of this theorem is that any two gcds of two given polynomials
are just scalar multiples of one another.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that if e and d are two gcds of polynomials f and g, then d
and e are scalar multiples of one another. 
Finally, we have the GCD identity for Q[x].
Theorem 4.7
GCD identity for polynomials
If d is a gcd of polynomials f and
g, then there exist polynomials a and b so that d = af + bg.
Proof:
The proof is Exercise 8 (or 9).

Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the set Q[x] of all polynomials with rational coeﬃcients and
described the arithmetic of this set. In direct analogy with Z, we proved the Division The-
orem, Euclid’s Algorithm, and the GCD identity. In addition, we described the relationship
between the roots of a polynomial and its linear factors; this relationship is called the Root
Theorem.

2. Divide the polynomial x2 −3x + 2 by the polynomial 2x + 1, to obtain a quotient and
remainder as guaranteed by the Division Theorem 4.2. Note that although x2 −3x+2

means that there is no Division Theorem for Z[x].
3. By Corollary 4.4 we know that a third-degree polynomial in Q[x] has at most three
roots. Give four examples of third-degree polynomials in Q[x] that have 0, 1, 2, and 3

number!)
4. Your example in the previous exercise of a third-degree polynomial with exactly 2
roots had one repeated root; that is, a root a where (x −a)2 is a factor of the
polynomial. (Roots may have multiplicity greater than two, of course.) Why can’t a
third-degree polynomial in Q[x] have exactly 2 roots where neither is a multiple root?

7. Let f ∈Q[x]. Recall from Exercise 4 above that a rational number a is a repeated
root of f if (x −a)2 is a factor of f. Given f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, we deﬁne the
formal derivative of f as f ′ = nanxn−1 + (n −1)an−1xn−2 + · · · + a1. Prove that a

Chapter 5
Factorization of Polynomials
We have already seen the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which says that every integer
(other than 0, 1, and −1) can be uniquely factored into primes. We wish to come up with
a corresponding theorem for the set Q[x] of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients.
5.1
Factoring Polynomials
We note ﬁrst that uniqueness of factorization cannot be as nice for polynomials as for
integers because any factorization in Q[x] can be adjusted by factoring out scalars. The
following example shows what we mean:
x2 −4
=
(x + 2)(x −2)
=
1
2x + 1

(2x −4)
=
(2x + 4)
1
2x −1

,
and so on.
But there is a close connection, after all, between the factors x + 2 and 1
2x + 1. Namely,
they diﬀer by only a scalar multiple. In fact, we will obtain uniqueness of factorization
for polynomials, up to scalar multiples. We now head toward this result. The ﬁrst order
of business is to deﬁne irreducible polynomials in a way analogous to our deﬁnition of
irreducible integers.
A polynomial p is irreducible if
a. p is of degree greater than zero, and
b. whenever p = fg, then either f or g has degree zero.
In other words, an irreducible is a non-scalar polynomial, whose only factorizations involve
scalar factors. We are thus regarding such factorizations as x + 1
2 = 1
2(2x + 1) as trivial,
just as we regard factorizations such as 3 = (−1)(−3) as trivial in the integer case. So,
a non-trivial factorization of a polynomial is one that has at least two non-scalar factors.
We say that a polynomial is reducible if it does have a non-trivial factorization. Thus,
x4 + 2x2 + 1 is reducible.
 Quick Exercise.
Why is x4 + 2x2 + 1 reducible?

Which polynomials in Q[x] are irreducible? One immediate consequence of the deﬁnition
is that all polynomials of degree one are irreducible because if p is of degree 1 and p = fg,
then exactly one of f and g has degree 0, and is consequently a scalar.
43

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Are there any others? Consider the polynomial f = x2 + 2. If this polynomial had a
non-trivial factorization x2 + 2 = gh, then both g and h would be degree one factors. But
then the Root Theorem tells us that x2+2 would have a rational root. But f(q) = q2+2 ≥2
for all rational numbers q, and so f can have no roots.
Consider next the polynomial x2 −2. By the same reasoning, if this polynomial were
reducible, it would have a root, and so there would exist a rational number q so that q2 = 2.
There is no such rational number, as you probably know. The fact that
√
2 is an irrational
number is a very famous theorem, ﬁrst proved by the ancient Greeks. You will prove it (and
more) in Exercise 13 (see also Exercise 2.14). Thus, x2 −2 is irreducible.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that x4 + 2 is irreducible in Q[x], taking your lead from the
discussion of x2 + 2 above.

 Quick Exercise.
Show that x3 −2 is irreducible in Q[x]. Hint: If x3 −2 were reducible,
then it would have a linear factor. You may assume (see Exercise 13) that there is no rational
number r so that r3 = 2.

These examples suggest that there are many irreducible polynomials in Q[x], and indeed
there are, of arbitrarily high degree. (See Exercise 12.) It would be diﬃcult to describe them
all, however.
Note that we are interested only in factors which belong to Q[x] (for the time being, at
least). Thus, x2 −2 is irreducible in Q[x], even though we can factor it if we allow ourselves
to use real numbers as coeﬃcients:
x2 −2 =

x −
√
2
 
x +
√
2

.
In Chapter 10 we will discuss factorization of polynomials over the real numbers R and the
complex numbers C.
We now claim that every polynomial can be factored into irreducibles:
Theorem 5.1 Any polynomial in Q[x] of degree greater than zero is either irreducible or
the product of irreducibles.
Proof:
Prove this in a similar way to the proof for the corresponding theorem for the
integers, Theorem 2.8. This proof is Exercise 1.
2
5.2
Unique Factorization
The previous theorem is the ﬁrst half of the unique factorization theorem that we want for
Q[x]. Recall that to obtain the uniqueness of factorization in Z, we required the concept of
a prime integer. We now make the analogous deﬁnition: a polynomial p (with degree bigger
than 0) is prime if whenever p divides fg, then p divides f or p divides g.
We claim that x −2 is a prime polynomial. Suppose that x −2 divides the product fg.
Then by the Root Theorem 4.3, 2 is a root of fg, and so f(2)g(2) = 0. But f(2) and g(2)
are rational numbers, and the only way a product of rational numbers can be zero is if at
least one of the factors is zero. That is, f(2) (or g(2)) is zero, and so 2 is a root of f (or
g). Notice that this argument could be modiﬁed to show that any degree one polynomial is
prime.

Chapter 5: Factorization of Polynomials
45
 Quick Exercise.
Modify the argument in the previous paragraph to prove that all
degree one polynomials in Q[x] are prime.

But we need not pursue any further examples because the concept of prime polynomial
turns out to be equivalent to that of irreducible polynomial. This situation is what we
discovered for Z, and the proof is the same:
Theorem 5.2 A polynomial in Q[x] is irreducible if and only if it is prime.
Proof:
Prove this, again taking your lead from the proof of Theorem 2.7, the analogous
result for the integers. This proof is Exercise 2.
2
Corollary 5.3 If p is an irreducible polynomial that divides
f1f2 · · · fn,
then p divides one of the fi.
Proof:
Prove this. This proof is Exercise 3.
2
So, for both Z and Q[x], primeness and irreducibility are equivalent. Be warned that we
will eventually examine structures where this is not the case. It is thus important to keep
these deﬁnitions straight.
Finally, we come to the unique factorization theorem for polynomials. It is similar to
the unique factorization theorem for integers, except we must account for the fact that
we can always factor out scalars, as noted above. Accordingly, we ﬁrst make the following
convenient deﬁnition.
Two polynomials f and g are called associates if there is a non-zero scalar a such that
f = ag. For instance, x2 −3 and 2x2 −6 are associates. Note that any two non-zero scalars
are associates.
 Quick Exercise.
Describe the set of all associates of the polynomial x2 −3 (there are
inﬁnitely many).

Theorem 5.4
Unique Factorization Theorem for Polynomials
If h is a poly-
nomial in Q[x], and
h = f1f2 · · · fn = g1g2 · · · gm,
where the fi and gj are all irreducible, then n = m and the gj may be rearranged so that fi
and gi are associates, for i = 1, 2, . . . n.
Before we prove this theorem, let’s look at an example. Consider the polynomial h =
2x3 + 3x2 + 5x + 2. Now h can be factored into irreducibles as (2x + 1)(x2 + x + 2) or as
(x + 1
2)(2x2 + 2x + 4), or an inﬁnite number of other ways. But, of course, 2x + 1 and x + 1
2
are associates, as are x2 + x + 2 and 2x2 + 2x + 4.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that the factors of h given above are really irreducible.

Proof:
We use induction on n, the number of factors fi of h. If n = 1, the theorem follows
easily. (Right?) So, we assume n > 1. By the primeness of the irreducible f1, f1 divides one
of the gj (see the Corollary 5.3). By renumbering the gj, if necessary, we may assume f1
divides g1. So, because g1 is irreducible, af1 = g1, for some non-zero scalar a. That is, f1 and
g1 are associates. Therefore, by dividing both sides by f1, we have f2f3 · · · fn = ag2g3 · · · gm.
(Because g2 is irreducible, so is ag2, and we consider ag2 as an irreducible factor.) We now

46
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
have two factorizations into irreducibles and the number of fi factors is n −1. So, by the
induction hypothesis, n −1 = m −1 and, by renumbering the gj if necessary, fi and gi are
associates for i = 2, 3, . . . , n. (Actually, we have that ag2 is an associate of f2. But then g2
is also an associate of f2.) This proves the theorem.
2
Notice that the proof of this theorem is nearly identical to the proof of the corresponding
Theorem 2.9 for Z. We had only to handle the problem of associates. By now, you should
have seen this similarity with all the theorems in this chapter and might be wondering the
reason for it. We will eventually ﬁnd a close connection between the integers and Q[x] that
explains this similarity.
5.3
Polynomials with Integer Coeﬃcients
We close this chapter by discussing the relationship between Q[x] and Z[x]. You should
ﬁrst note that some of the theorems we have proved about Q[x] are false when we restrict
ourselves to polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. In particular, the Division Theorem is
false for Z[x]. To see this, merely try to divide x2 + 7x by 2x + 1: the Division Theorem
4.2 for Q[x] provides us with the unique quotient 1
2x + 11
4 and remainder −11
4 . These are
not elements of Z[x], and so no such quotient/remainder pair can exist in Z[x]. (See also
Exercise 4.2.)
Similarly, the GCD identity fails in Z[x]. Consider the polynomials 2 and x; a gcd for
these polynomials is 1. But we cannot write 1 as a linear combination of 2 and x in Z[x].
 Quick Exercise.
Show that we cannot write 1 as a linear combination of 2 and x.
Hint: Suppose that 1 = 2f + xg, where f, g ∈Z[x], and consider the constant term of the
right-hand side of the equation.

It is thus not surprising that we look to Q[x] (rather than Z[x]) for our analogue to
Z. However, the news is not all bad. For it turns out that if a polynomial with integer
coeﬃcients can be non-trivially factored into polynomials with rational coeﬃcients, then it
can be factored into polynomials with integer coeﬃcients; this result is known as Gauss’s
Lemma.
For example, consider 2x2 + 3x −2. Because 1
2 is a root, we have that
2x2 + 3x −2 =

x −1
2

(2x + 4).
This is a factorization in Q[x]. But by adjusting scalars, we can obtain the factorization
2x2 + 3x −2 = (2x −1)(x + 2)
in Z[x].
The idea of the proof below is essentially that of the example we’ve just given, although
it is a bit messy to carry it out in general. Some readers may want to skip this proof on a
ﬁrst reading.
Theorem 5.5
Gauss’s Lemma
If f ∈Z[x] and f can be factored into a product
of non-scalar polynomials in Q[x], then f can be factored into a product of non-scalar
polynomials in Z[x]; each factor in Z[x] is an associate of the corresponding factor in Q[x].

Chapter 5: Factorization of Polynomials
47
Proof:
Suppose f ∈Z[x], and f = gh, where g, h ∈Q[x]. We can assume that the
coeﬃcients of f have no common factors (other than ±1), or else we factor out the greatest
common divisor of those coeﬃcients, apply the following, and then multiply through by the
gcd. So, suppose that
g
=
an
bn
xn + an−1
bn−1
xn−1 + · · · + a0
b0
, and
h
=
cm
dm
xm + cm−1
dm−1
xm−1 + · · · + c0
d0
where the ai’s, bi’s, ci’s, and di’s are all integers and each fraction is in lowest terms.
Multiply the ﬁrst equation by the product B of the bi’s. We get
Bg = A′
nxn + A′
n−1xn−1 + · · · + A′
0.
Now divide by the greatest common divisor A of the A′
i’s, yielding
(B/A)g = Anxn + An−1xn−1 + · · · + A0,
which is a polynomial in Z[x] whose coeﬃcients have no common divisor (other than ±1).
Do likewise to the second equation, yielding
(D/C)h = Cmxm + Cm−1xm−1 + · · · + C0,
which again is a polynomial whose coeﬃcients have no common divisor (other than ±1).
Because f = gh, we get
BDf = (AC)((B/A)g)((D/C)h).
(5.1)
Because the coeﬃcients of f have no common divisor, we see that BD is the gcd of the
coeﬃcients of BDf. Because AC is a common divisor of the coeﬃcients of this polynomial
(as we see by looking at the right side of equation 5.1) we have that AC|BD. Let E =
BD/AC, which is an integer. We have
Ef = (Anxn + An−1xn−1 + · · · + A0)(Cmxm + Cm−1xm−1 + · · · + C0).
(5.2)
We need only show that E = ±1 to be done, because then f has been written in the required
form. If E ̸= ±1, then let p be a prime factor of E. Remember that all the Ai’s have no
common factor and all the Ci’s have no common factor. Therefore, there is a smallest i such
that p ̸ |Ai and a smallest j such that p ̸ |Cj. We now compute the coeﬃcient of xi+j. From
the left side of equation 5.2 we see that this coeﬃcient is divisible by E, and hence by p.
From the right side, the coeﬃcient is
i−1
X
k=0
AkCi+j−k +
i+j
X
k=i+1
AkCi+j−k + AiCj.
In the ﬁrst sum, each of Ak is divisible by p because those k are less than i. In the second
sum, each Ci+j−k is divisible by p because those i + j −k are less than j. But AiCj is not
divisible by p. Hence, the entire coeﬃcient cannot be divisible by p, which is a contradiction.
So it must be that E = ±1 as desired.
2
We can rephrase Gauss’s Lemma in the following way: To see whether a polynomial in
Z[x] can be factored non-trivially in Q[x], we need only check to see if it can be factored
non-trivially in Z[x]. This latter is presumably an easier task.

48
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
For example, consider the case of cubic equations. If a cubic polynomial in Z[x] can be
factored non-trivially in Z[x], one of the factors must be a degree one polynomial ax + b,
where a and b are integers. This implies that the polynomial must have a root −b
a in Q. But
we can limit the possibilities for a and b, which in turn limits which roots are possible. For
a speciﬁc example of this, consider the polynomial 3x3 + x + 1. We wish to factor this into
irreducibles in Q[x] or determine if the polynomial is itself irreducible. If 3x3 +x+1 factors
in Q[x], then, by Gauss’s Lemma, it factors in Z[x] and in fact must have a linear factor
in Z[x]. The only possible such factors are of the form (3x ± 1) or (x ± 1), in order that
the leading and trailing coeﬃcients be correct. But this implies that the polynomial has a
root of ±1/3 or ±1, which, by inspection, is not the case. We conclude that 3x3 + x + 1 is
irreducible in Z[x], and hence in Q[x].
The argument above can be generalized to obtain a valuable tool for factoring in Z[x],
known as the Rational Root Theorem.
Theorem 5.6
The Rational Root Theorem
Suppose that f = a0 + a1x + · · · +
anxn is a polynomial in Z[x], and p/q is a rational root; that is, p and q are integers, q ̸= 0,
and f(p/q) = 0. We may as well assume also that gcd(p, q) = 1. Then q divides the integer
an, and p divides a0.
Proof:
You will prove this in Exercise 6.
2
 Quick Exercise.

 Quick Exercise.
Is 3x3+2x+1 irreducible in Q[x]? Is x3−3x+4? Is 2x3+7x2−2x−1?

Another important tool when considering factorization is the following suﬃcient condi-
tion for a polynomial being irreducible in Z[x].
Theorem 5.7
Eisenstein’s Criterion
Suppose that f ∈Z[x], and
f = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn.
Let p be a prime integer, and suppose that
1. p divides ak, for 0 ≤k < n,
2. p does not divide an, and
3. p2 does not divide a0.
Then f is irreducible in Z[x].
Proof:
Once again, you will prove this theorem in Exercise 16.
2
Example 5.1
It is quite evident that the Eisenstein criterion implies that the polynomial x5 +5x+5
is irreducible in Z[x], by using p = 5. But note that the criterion does not directly
apply to the polynomial x5 + 5x + 4. However, you will discover in Exercise 15 how to
apply the criterion to show that this is in fact an irreducible polynomial.
Notice that although Eisenstein’s criterion is phrased as a theorem about irreducibility
in Z[x], Gauss’s Lemma 5.5 implies that such a polynomial is also irreducible in Q[x].

Chapter 5: Factorization of Polynomials
49
Example 5.2
Consider the polynomial
f = 1
3x4 + 2
9x3 + 4x2 −2
5x + 2 ∈Q[x].
We wish to conclude that f is irreducible in Q[x]. By multiplying through by 45, we
obtain the element
g = 45f = 15x4 + 10x3 + 140x2 −18x + 90 ∈Z[x].
Note that we could apply the Rational Root Theorem to g to conclude that it has no
roots in Q; it would be tedious to carry out the details. However, we can in fact apply
Eisenstein’s Criterion (with p = 2) to reach the strictly stronger conclusion that g is
irreducible in Z[x]. But then Gauss’s Lemma says that g is in fact irreducible in Q[x],
and so f is irreducible in Q[x] too.
Historical Remarks
In the last two chapters we have given a systematic account of the theory of Q[x], the set
of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients, giving due emphasis to its similarity to Z. We
have consequently emphasized a formal, algebraic approach to Q[x], which probably seems
foreign to your previous experience with polynomials.
The pieces of this theory were put together over a number of centuries, beginning in
earnest with the 16th and 17th-century French algebraists Vi`ete and Descartes and cul-
minating in the work of Gauss. This development was relatively slow, primarily for two
reasons. First of all, algebraic notation at the time of Vi`ete was cumbersome and not stan-
dardized. Algebra ﬂows much more easily when our notation is clear and eﬃcient. Secondly,
in the 17th century people had little agreement about the nature of numbers. Doubts were
cast on the ‘reality’ and utility of irrational numbers, complex numbers, and even negative
numbers. We’ll discuss this issue more in Chapter 10. The process by which the number
system which we use was standardized and widely accepted was long and diﬃcult. The
lesson from history is clear: It takes a lot of hard work to become comfortable with the
elegant point of view of a modern mathematician!
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we considered factorization in Q[x] and proved that a polynomial is irre-
ducible if and only if it is prime, and we used this fact to prove the Unique Factorization
Theorem for Polynomials. We then proved Gauss’s Lemma, which describes the relationship
between factoring in Z[x] and in Q[x]. We concluded by considering two important tools
useful in factoring in Z[x], called the Rational Root Theorem and Eisenstein’s Criterion.

Section I in a Nutshell
This section examines the integers (Z), the integers modulo m (Zm), and polynomials with
rational coeﬃcients (Q[x]). These structures share many algebraic properties:
• Each has addition deﬁned and the addition is commutative.
• Each has multiplicative deﬁned and the multiplication is commutative.
• Each has an additive identity (0 for Z, [0] for Zm, and the zero polynomial for Q[x]).
• Each has a multiplicative identity (1 for Z, [1] for Zm, and the polynomial 1 for Q[x]).
• All elements have additive inverses, but not all elements have multiplicative inverses.
Furthermore, Z and Q[x] have some notion of ‘size’. The size of an integer is given by
its absolute value, while the size of a polynomial is given by its degree.
This notion of size along with their similar algebraic properties, allow us to prove a
series of parallel theorems for Z and Q[x]:
(Theorem 2.1) Division Theorem for Z: Let a, b ∈Z with a ̸= 0. Then there exist unique
integers q and r with 0 ≤r < |a| such that b = aq + r.
(Theorem 4.2) Division Theorem for Q[x]: Let f, g ∈Q[x] with f ̸= 0. Then there are
unique polynomials q and r with deg(r) < deg(f) such that g = fq + r.
These Division Theorems allow us to develop Euclid’s Algorithm, which is a method to
compute the gcd of two integers (Theorem 2.3) or polynomials (Theorem 4.5).
We then developed the notion of an irreducible integer and irreducible polynomial: An
integer (polynomial) p is irreducible if ̸= ±1 (deg(p) > 0) and whenever p = ab, then either a
or b is ±1 (either a or b has degree 0). There is also a shared notion of primeness: An integer
(polynomial) is prime if p is not 0, 1, or −1 (deg(p) > 0) and whenever p divides ab, then
either p divides a or p divides b. For Z and Q[x], the idea of primeness and irreducibility
are one and the same: (Theorems 2.7 and 5.2). An integer (polynomial) is irreducible if
and only if it is prime. This equivalence enables us to prove the Fundamental Theorem
of Arithmetic, and its analogue for polynomials: Every integer (other than 0, 1, or −1) is
irreducible or a product of irreducibles (Theorem 2.8). Similarly, any polynomial in Q[x]
of degree greater than 0 is either irreducible or the product of irreducibles (Theorem 5.1).
Both of these factorizations are unique:
(Theorem 2.9) If an integer x = a1a2 · · · an = b1b2 · · · bm where the ai and bj are all
irreducible, then n = m and the bj may be rearranged so that ai = ±bi for i = 1, 2, . . . , m.
(Theorem 5.4) If the polynomial p = f1f2 · · · fn = g1g2 · · · gm where the fi and gj are all
irreducible, then n = m and the gj may be rearranged so that fi and gj are associates (that
is, non-zero scalar multiples of one another), for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Finally, we examined the polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, Z[x]. Unfortunately, there
is no Division Theorem for Z[x] and no GCD identity. However, Z[x] does have some inter-
esting factorization properties:
(Theorem 5.5) Gauss’s Lemma If f ∈Z[x] and f can be factored into a product of non-
scalar polynomials in Q[x], then f can be factored into a product of non-scalar polynomials
in Z[x].
(Theorem 5.6) Rational Root Theorem Suppose f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈Z[x] and
p, q ∈Z with q ̸= 0, gcd(p, q) = 1 and f(p/q) = 0. Then q divides an and p divides an.
52

(Theorem 5.7) Eisenstein’s Criterion Suppose f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn ∈Z[x], and p is a
prime where (1) p divides ak for 0 ≤k < n, (2) p does not divide an, and (3) p2 does not
divide a0. Then f is irreducible in Q[x].

Chapter 6
Rings
In the previous chapters we have examined several diﬀerent algebraic objects: Z, Q[x],
and Zm (for integers m > 1). You are also probably aquainted with the larger sets of real
numbers, R, and complex numbers, C. In each of these cases we have a set of elements,
which is equipped with two operations called addition and multiplication. Each of these
is an example of an abstract concept called a ring. In this chapter we will give a general
deﬁnition of this concept and look at some basic properties and examples.
6.1
Binary Operations
Before we can do this, we must understand better what we mean by an ‘operation’ deﬁned
on a set. A binary operation on a set S is a function ◦: S × S 7→S, where
S × S = {(s, t) : s, t ∈S}
is the set of all ordered pairs with entries from S. Thus, ◦is a function that takes ordered
pairs of elements from S to elements of S.
If you think about it, that is exactly what an operation like addition (on Z) does: It
takes an ordered pair of elements (such as (4, 6)), and assigns to that pair another element
(4 + 6 = 10).
Because we wish to make this function ◦look like our more familiar operations like
addition or multiplication, we write the image of an element (s, t) in S × S, under the
function ◦as s ◦t.
Thus, addition and multiplication on the set Z (or for that matter on Zm, Q[x], Q, or
even the natural numbers N) are binary operations. Notice that although in our discussion
above we were using the notation ◦for our generic binary operation, we are perfectly happy
to denote addition by + as usual. Subtraction is a binary operation on the ﬁrst four of these
sets but is not a binary operation on N because the function −is not deﬁned on such pairs
as (3, 4).
Similarly, division is not a binary operation on any of our sets considered so far because
of zero: The function ÷ has no image deﬁned for such ordered pairs as (1, 0). However, ÷ is
a binary operation on the sets Q+ of strictly positive rational numbers, and Q∗of non-zero
rational numbers.
For a rather diﬀerent example of a binary operation, consider any nonempty set S and
deﬁne s ◦t = s. That is, ◦assigns the ﬁrst entry to any ordered pair it is given.
 Quick Exercise.
Which of the following are binary operations?
1. Matrix multiplication, on the set of all 2 × 2 matrices.
2. a ◦b = a + b + ab, on the set Z.
3. Dot product, on the set of all vectors in the plane.
57

4. Cross product, on the set of all vectors in space.
5. A ∩B, on the set of all subsets of {1, 2, 3, 4}.
6. a ◦b =
√
ab, on the set R.
7. a ◦b =
√
ab, on the set R+, the set of all positive real numbers. 
Note the crucial importance of both the set on which the operation is deﬁned, as well
as the operation itself. A function can be a binary operation only if it gives a value for all
possible ordered pairs in the set. We often say a set is closed under an operation if this
is the case. Thus, N is closed under addition and multiplication but is not closed under
subtraction or division.
You might already suspect that because the deﬁnition of binary operation is so general,
we should reserve terms like ‘addition’ and ‘subtraction’ for very special binary operations
which obey nice rules. This is precisely what we do when we deﬁne a ring.
6.2
Rings
A ring R is a set of elements on which two binary operations, addition (+) and multiplica-
tion (·), are deﬁned that satisfy the following properties. (The symbols a, b, and c represent
any elements from R.)
(Rule 1) a + b = b + a
(Rule 2) (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
(Rule 3) There exists an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a
(Rule 4) For each element a in R, there exists an element x such that a + x = 0
(Rule 5) (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
(Rule 6) a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c , (b + c) · a = b · a + c · a
Let’s introduce some terminology to describe these rules: Rule 1 says that addition is
commutative, and Rules 2 and 5 say that addition and multiplication, respectively, are
associative. Rule 3 says an additive identity (or zero) exists, and Rule 4 says that
each element of the ring has an additive inverse. Finally, Rule 6 says that multiplication
distributes over addition on the right and the left.
We will usually write ab instead of a · b.
What are some examples of rings?
Example 6.1
The integers Z, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication. The properties
listed above should all be familiar facts about arithmetic in the integers.
Example 6.2
The rational numbers Q, with the usual addition and multiplication. Once again, we
rely on our previous experience with arithmetic to check that all these properties hold.

Chapter 6: Rings
59
Example 6.3
Z6, the integers modulo 6. In Chapter 3 we constructed what we mean by this set
and deﬁned operations + and · on it. Let’s check that addition in Z6 is commutative:
By the deﬁnition of addition in Z6, [a]6 + [b]6 = [a + b]6. But because addition in
Z is commutative, [a + b]6 = [b + a]6. And so (again by the deﬁnition of addition),
[a]6 + [b]6 = [b + a]6 = [b]6 + [a]6, as required.
The proof we just performed was admittedly tedious. Note that it could have been
paraphrased as follows: Addition in Z6 is deﬁned in terms of addition in Z, and because
addition in Z is commutative, so is addition in Z6.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the other ﬁve ring axioms are satisﬁed by Z6. Note
that we have already discussed the existence of the additive identity and additive
inverses for Z6 in Chapter 3. 
Example 6.4
Zm, the integers modulo m, for any integer m > 1, with the addition and multiplication
deﬁned in Chapter 3. The proofs in Example 6.3 certainly work for any m.
Example 6.5
The set {0}, where 0 + 0 = 0 · 0 = 0. This is the world’s most boring ring, called
the zero ring. Because our set has only a single element, and any computation we
perform gives us 0, all six axioms must certainly hold.
Example 6.6
The polynomials with rational coeﬃcients, Q[x], with the addition and multiplication
we deﬁned in Chapter 4. When we add polynomials, we just add corresponding coeﬃ-
cients (x2 terms added together, etc.). But then, because addition of rational numbers
is commutative and associative, it follows that addition of polynomials is commutative
and associative. The polynomial 0 clearly plays the role of the additive identity in
Q[x], and we can obtain an additive inverse for any polynomial by changing the sign
of every term (this amounts to just multiplying by -1).
Thus, to show that Q[x] is a ring, it remains only to prove that multiplication is
associative, and that it distributes over addition. Because the multiplication of poly-
nomials is diﬃcult to describe formally (even though it is very familiar), formal proofs
that Rules 5 and 6 are satisﬁed by Q[x] are exceedingly tedious. We consequently omit
them here, and refer you to Exercises 21 and 22.
Example 6.7
The polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, Z[x], with the addition and multiplication
as in Chapter 5. We ﬁrst note that whenever we add or multiply two polynomials with
integer coeﬃcients, we get another one. That is, this set is closed under addition and
multiplication. Because the rational polynomials satisfy Rules 1, 2, 5, and 6, it is quite
evident that Z[x] does too because Z[x] ⊆Q[x]. Rule 3 holds because the polynomial
0 ∈Z[x], and Rule 4 holds because multiplying a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients
by -1 gives more integer coeﬃcients.

Example 6.8
The set of all even integers, which we abbreviate as 2Z, together with ordinary addition
and multiplication.
 Quick Exercise.
Use an argument modelled on that we used for Example 6.7 to show
that 2Z is a ring. 
Example 6.9
Let Z × Z be the set of ordered pairs with integer entries. That is,
Z × Z = {(a, b) : a, b ∈Z}.
Deﬁne addition and multiplication point-wise; that is,
(n, m) + (r, s)
=
(n + r, m + s)
(n, m) · (r, s)
=
(nr, ms).
Then Z × Z is a commutative ring. You will verify the details in Exercise 13.
Example 6.10
Let R and S be arbitrary rings, and let R × S be the set of ordered pairs with ﬁrst
entry from R, and second entry from S. Then if we deﬁne addition and multipication
point-wise (as in Example 6.9), we have created a new ring, called the direct product
of the rings R and S. You will check the details, and further generalize this, in Exercise
15.
 Quick Exercise.
Write out the addition and multiplication tables for the direct prod-
uct ring Z2 × Z3. 
It might also be worthwhile to provide a few examples of sets equipped with two oper-
ations, which are not rings:
Example 6.11
The set N of natural numbers, equipped with the usual addition and multiplication.
This structure satisﬁes Rules 1, 2, 5, and 6, but Rules 3 and 4 are false.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that these assertions are true. 

Chapter 6: Rings
61
Example 6.12
The set Z, with the usual addition, and the operation ◦deﬁned by a ◦b = a. This
structure satisﬁes the ﬁrst ﬁve rules. Furthermore, ◦distributes over addition from the
right, because
(b + c) ◦a = b + c = b ◦a + c ◦a.
However, ◦does not distribute over addition from the left. To see this, we need only
provide an example:
2 ◦(3 + 4) = 2 ̸= 2 + 2 = 2 ◦3 + 2 ◦4.
Thus, Z equipped with these operations is not a ring.
Let us now look a little more carefully at the rules determining a ring. Rules 1, 2,
5, and 6 specify that addition and multiplication are to satisfy certain nice properties
(thus distinguishing them from general binary relations). These properties are universal
statements applying to all elements of the ring. Thus, addition is required to be commutative
and associative, multiplication is to be associative, and multiplication should distribute over
addition. Note that we do not require that multiplication be commutative. If that is the
case, we say that we have a commutative ring. The rings in Examples 6.1–6.9 are all
commutative. Example 6.13 below is a non-commutative ring.
Rule 3 is quite diﬀerent. It asserts that an element of a particular kind (the additive
identity) exists in the ring. Without Rule 3, the empty set would qualify as a ring. Rule
4 speciﬁes that additive inverses exist for each element we ﬁnd in the ring, but it certainly
does not require that a ring have any other elements than 0, because 0 + 0 = 0 means that
0 is its own additive inverse. We already saw in Example 6.5 that a ring can consist of the
additive identity only.
Example 6.13
Let M2(Z) be the set of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries. We equip this set with
the usual addition and multiplication of
matrices. (In case you have not seen these
operations before, or don’t remember them well, we have relegated a discussion of them
to Exercises 6 and 7.) Note that when we add or multiply two matrices with integer
entries, we obtain another one, and so this set is closed under the operations. We claim
that M2(Z) is a ring:
Rules 1 and 2 follow easily because they hold in Z. The zero of M2(Z) is
 0

,
which can easily be veriﬁed. The additive inverse of
 a

is
 −a

. That
multiplication is associative and that the distributive laws hold are left as Exercise 7.
But note that M2(Z) is not commutative. For example,

The previous example shows the relevance of the ring concept to students of linear
algebra. Our ﬁnal example of the chapter connects algebra to the study of calculus and
analysis:

62
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 6.14
Let C[0, 1] be the set of real-valued functions deﬁned on the closed unit interval [0, 1] =
{x ∈R : 0 ≤x ≤1}, which are continuous. Deﬁne the sum and product of two
functions point-wise: (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x) and (fg)(x) = f(x)g(x). You can use
theorems from calculus to show that this set is a commutative ring. (See Exercise 9.)
6.3
Arithmetic in a Ring
We can now begin to talk about the arithmetic in an arbitrary ring. The following theorem
shows some of the simple arithmetic operations we’re used to doing in Z, which we can now
perform in an arbitrary ring:
Theorem 6.1 Suppose R is a ring, and a, b, c ∈R.
a. (Additive cancellation) If a + b = a + c, then b = c.
b. (Solution of equations) The equation a + x = b always has a unique solution in R.
c. (Uniqueness of additive inverse) Every element of R has exactly one additive inverse.
d. (Uniqueness of additive identity) There is only one element of R which satisﬁes the
equations z + a = a, for all a; namely, the element 0.
Proof:
We will proceed very carefully from the rules deﬁning a ring for the ﬁrst of these
proofs, and then argue less formally. The reader is invited to ﬁll in the careful details.
 Quick Exercise.
Fill in the details for the proofs below of parts (b), (c), and (d) of
the theorem.

(a): Suppose that R is a ring, a, b, c ∈R, and a + b = a + c. By Rule 4, we know there
exists an element x ∈R for which a + x = 0. By Rule 1 we know that 0 = a + x = x + a.
We can now add x to both sides of our given equation, to obtain x + (a + b) = x + (a + c).
By two applications of Rule 2, we then have that (x + a) + b = (x + a) + c. But then we
have 0 + b = 0 + c, and so by Rules 1 and 3, we conclude that b = c, as required.
(b): We will now proceed less formally than in the proof for (a). Note that x = d + b
will do the job, where d is an additive inverse of a. Suppose that e is some other solution
to the equation. Then a + e = a + (d + b), and so, by the Additive Cancellation property,
e = d + b. Thus, our solution is unique.
(c): Suppose a has two additive inverses: say x and y. Then a + x = 0 = a + y, and so,
by the Additive Cancellation property, x = y.
(d): This is left as Exercise 2.
2
Note well that although additive cancellation holds in any ring (by part (a) of Theorem
6.1), multiplicative cancellation can certainly fail. For instance, we have already seen that in
Z6, 3·2 = 3·4 (= 0), but 2 ̸= 4. Because the axioms in the deﬁnition of a ring require less of
multiplication, we should expect fewer nice properties for multiplication than for addition.
There are other familiar properties from arithmetic that hold in an arbitrary ring. For
example, multiplication by 0 always gives 0, and minus times plus is minus. We leave these
for you to prove (see Exercises 1, 3, and 4).

Chapter 6: Rings
63
A very careful reader may still be concerned about the rigor of the proof we oﬀered
above for part (a). How can we justify adding x to both sides of the given equation? First
of all, note that elements x + (a + b) and x + (a + c) exist in the ring, because the ring is
closed under addition. The fact that they are equal follows, not from one of our rules for
rings, but rather from a property of equality, known as the Substitution Rule for Equality.
This says that if a = b (that is, if a and b are identical elements of the ring), then we can
safely replace any appearances of a in an expression by b and get a new expression equal
to the old. This is actually a rule of logic, rather than of ring theory, and in this book we
have made no attempt to carefully axiomatize the rules of logic, since this would take us
too far aﬁeld from algebra. In proofs you write you should feel free to use the ordinary
properties of equality with which you have been long familiar, including the Substitution
Rule. In particular, note that
1. a = a, for all a (reﬂexivity),
2. if a = b then b = a (symmetry), and
3. if a = b and b = c, then a = c (transitivity).
(A relation satisfying these three properties is called an equivalence relation.)
6.4
Notational Conventions
Because additive inverses are unique, we can thus denote the additive inverse of element a
by the unambiguous notation −a.
You should exercise some care in using this notation, however. We are not interpreting
−a as meaning the product of −1 and a. In an arbitrary ring we have no guarantee that
there exist such elements as −1 or 1 (see Example 6.8).
We can now make sense of subtraction in an arbitrary ring, simply by interpreting a −b
as a + (−b). In Exercise 5, you will show that subtraction in an arbitrary ring obeys rules
like those found in Z.
Here are some further handy notational conventions: For n ∈N and ring element a,
na = a + a + . . . + a and an = a · a · . . . · a, where a appears n times on the right-hand side
of the equations. Thus, 3a is shorthand for a + a + a, and a4 is shorthand for a · a · a · a.
Care must be exercised in the use of these conventions. For example, in 2Z, we can write
2 + 2 + 2 = 3(2),
and interpret this as a calculation inside 2Z, even though there is no element 3 belonging
to the ring.

The Set of Integers Is a Ring
In Chapters 1 and 2 we relied on your previous experience with the integers when dealing
with arithmetic and admitted that this was a ﬂaw if we were attempting to make a careful
axiomatic development of the properties of the integers. We now have the language necessary
to rectify this logical ﬂaw by stating carefully what we’ve been assuming all along.
Axiom of Arithmetic The integers Z under ordinary addition and multiplication is a
ring.
This axiom (together with the Well-ordering Principle) is all we need to prove what
we have about the integers. In the future we will be showing that many other rings have
‘integer-like’ properties.
Historical Remarks
In this chapter we deﬁned the abstract concept of ring, as a way of generalizing the arith-
metic properties possessed by our particular examples Z and Q[x]. Historically, this deﬁni-
tion was a long time in coming, but, in broad strokes, we are being accurate to the historical
development in basing our deﬁnition on Z and Q[x]. This is true because in the 19th cen-
tury, the formal deﬁnition of ring (and its ensuing popularity in mathematical circles) grew
out of two subjects, related respectively to Z and Q[x]. The ﬁrst subject is number theory.
Such mathematicians as the Germans Ernst Kummer and Richard Dedekind discovered that
number-theoretic questions about Z are related to such rings as Z[i] (described in Exercise
12). We will follow this topic further in ensuing chapters. The second subject is the geometry
related to polynomial equations (especially in more than one variable). Q[x] is a starting
point for this subject (called algebraic geometry), which we won’t pursue in this book. The
crucial historical ﬁgure here is another German, named David Hilbert. Hilbert was a great
believer in the power of axiomization and abstraction, and his success profoundly inﬂuenced
the course of 20th-century mathematics. If you are having some diﬃculty understanding the
utility of such an abstract concept as ring, you should take solace in the fact that many of
Hilbert’s late 19th-century colleagues were also reluctant to follow him down the road of
abstraction! But this road has many wonders, just around the corner.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned what we mean by a ring: a set equipped with two operations called
addition and multiplication, which satisfy certain natural axioms. We examined numerous
examples of rings (including Z and Q[x]) and began the study of the arithmetic of an
arbitrary ring.

Chapter 7
Subrings and Unity
Consider Example 6.7: We discovered that it was relatively easy to show that Z[x] is a
ring, because it is a subset of Q[x], which we had already shown is a ring. Because the
operations in Z[x] are the same as in Q[x], we didn’t have to check again the associative
laws, the distributive laws, or that addition was commutative. Because the addition and
multiplication of Q[x] have these properties, the addition and multiplication of Z[x] inherit
them automatically. What did need to be checked was that addition and multiplication
were closed in Z[x], that the additive identity of Q[x] was also in Z[x], and that the additive
inverses of elements of Z[x] were also in Z[x]. Similarly, in Example 6.8 you showed that 2Z
is a ring, taking advantage of the fact that 2Z ⊆Z.
7.1
Subrings
We generalize this situation: A subset S of a ring R is said to be a subring of R if S is
itself a ring under the operations induced from R.
Example 7.1
Z[x] is a subring of Q[x].
Example 7.2
2Z is a subring of Z.
Example 7.3
Z is a subring of Q, which is in turn a subring of R.
Example 7.4
The Gaussian integers Z[i] are a subring of C. (See Exercises 6.11 and 6.12.)
Example 7.5
Let R be any ring. Then {0} and R are always subrings of R. We call {0} the trivial
subring, and R the improper subring. All subrings other than R we call proper
subrings.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
In the general case, what exactly do we need to check to see that a subset of a ring is a
subring? We need not go through all the work we did in showing that Z[x] is a subring of
Q[x], as listed above. The following theorem provides a simpler answer. We will often use
this theorem to check whether something is a ring (by considering it as a subset of a larger
well-known ring):
Theorem 7.1
The Subring Theorem
A non-empty subset of a ring is a subring
under the same operations if and only if it is closed under multiplication and subtraction.
Proof:
It is obvious that a subring is closed under multiplication and subtraction. For
the converse, suppose that R is a ring and S a non-empty subset, which is closed under
multiplication and subtraction. We wish to show that S is a ring. Now, because S is non-
empty, we can then choose an element of it, which we call s. First note that because S is
closed under subtraction, then s −s = 0 ∈S. That is, the additive identity belongs to S
(Rule 3). Next, suppose that a ∈S. Because S is closed under subtraction, −a = 0 −a ∈S.
This means that S is closed under taking additive inverses (Rule 4). Now suppose that
a, b ∈S. Then we’ve just seen that −b ∈S. But then
a + b = a −(−b) ∈S,
and so S is closed under addition as well.
To show that S is a ring, it remains to show that addition is commutative, that addition
and multiplication are associative, and that multiplication distributes over addition. But all
these properties hold in R, and so are automatically inherited for S.
2
The most important use of this theorem is to check that some set is in fact a ring, by
viewing it as a subring of some larger previously known ring. We will see this principle
illustrated repeatedly in the examples below.
Because commutativity is automatically inherited by a subset, it follows that a subring
of a commutative ring is also commutative. Note that a subring of a non-commutative ring
may be commutative, because the zero ring is a commutative subring of any ring. Example
7.9 is a more interesting example of this.
Example 7.6
Let mZ = {mn : n ∈Z}, where m is an integer greater than 1. That is, mZ is the
set of integer multiples of m. We have already seen this example in case m = 2 as
Example 7.2. We claim that mZ is a subring of Z. For if ma, mb ∈mZ, then
ma −mb = m(a −b) ∈mZ
and so mZ is closed under subtraction. Similarly,
(ma)(mb) = m(mab) ∈mZ,
and so mZ is closed under multiplication.
Example 7.7
6Z is a subring of both 3Z and 2Z.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that 6Z is a subring of 3Z and 2Z, modelling your proof
on that of Example 7.6. 
We generalize this example in Exercise 5.

Chapter 7: Subrings and Unity
71
Example 7.8
{0, 2, 4} is a subring of Z6. It is easy to check directly that this set is closed under
subtraction and multiplication.
Example 7.9
Let D2(Z) be the set of all 2-by-2 matrices with entries from Z and with all entries oﬀ
the main diagonal being zero. We call these the diagonal matrices. We claim that
this is a subring of M2(Z).
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the set of diagonal matrices is closed under subtrac-
tion and multiplication. 
Note that D2(Z) is in fact a commutative ring:
 a

 ac

bd

=

.
Thus, D2(Z) is a commutative subring (bigger than the zero ring) of a non-
commutative ring.
Example 7.10
The direct product Z × Q is a subring of the ring R × R. (See Example 6.10.)
Here are a few examples of subsets of rings which are not subrings. Note how many
diﬀerent ways a subset can fail to be a subring.
Example 7.11
Consider the set Q+ of all strictly positive elements from Q. This is clearly not a
subring, because the additive identity 0 does not belong to Q+.
Example 7.12
Consider the set Q+ ∪{0} ⊆Q. This set does include 0 and is in fact closed under
multiplication. But it is not closed under subtraction and so is not a subring.
Example 7.13
Consider the set
πZ = {πn : n ∈Z},
that is, the set of all integer multiples of the real number π. This is a subset of the
ring R of all real numbers. It is closed under subtraction.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that πZ is closed under subtraction. 
However, it is not closed under multiplication, for if it were, then π2 would be an
integer multiple of π. But then π itself would be an integer, which is false.

72
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 7.14
Consider Z4 = {0, 1, 2, 3}. Is it a subring of Z? Clearly not, because although our
notation makes it look as if Z4 is a subset of Z, this is not actually the case. Recall
from Section 3.2 that when working with the rings Zn we often drop the square brackets
around the integers, if it is clear from context what we mean. In Z4, 3 means a residue
class, and so is an inﬁnite set of integers. This inﬁnite set of integers is certainly not
the same as the individual integer 3.
7.2
The Multiplicative Identity
We now raise another topic, which further illustrates the diﬀerent roles that addition and
multiplication play in a ring. It is an important part of the deﬁnition of a ring that it have
an additive identity or 0. We make no such assumption about a multiplicative identity;
many rings do possess a multiplicative identity, however. We call an element u of a ring R
a unity or multiplicative identity if ua = au = a for all elements a ∈R.
Example 7.15
Obviously, the integer 1 is the unity of Z. Similarly, 1 is the unity for the rings Q, R,
and C. In Q[x], the constant polynomial 1 is the unity. In the ring M2(Z), the unity is
 1
0
0
1

. In Chapter 3, we were careful to point out that the residue class [1] plays
the role of multiplicative identity in Zm. On the other hand, the ring 2Z has no unity,
because in the integers 2a = 2 holds exactly when a = 1, an element which 2Z lacks.
More generally, mZ lacks unity for all m > 1.
Note that for the particular examples we’ve discussed, we have spoken as if the unity
element of a ring (if it exists) is unique. This is in fact the case and can be proved by a
proof very similar to the one we used to show that the zero of a ring is unique. We leave
this proof as Exercise 17. Because unity is unique, for an arbitrary ring we can thus denote
it unambiguously by 1.
There is a surprising diﬃculty with this, however. Consider the zero ring {0}. In this
ring 0 is both the additive identity and the multiplicative identity, and so in this case 0 = 1.
In order to avoid this trivial case, we will henceforth reserve the term ‘unity’ for rings other
than the zero ring. In Exercise 16, you will prove that in a ring with more than one element,
the additive identity and multiplicative identity cannot be the same.
7.3
Surjective, Injective, and Bijective Functions
Algebraists place more emphasis on structure and properties than on details of notation.
When discussing examples of an abstract structure like a ring, they often assert two rings
are essentially the same, except for the details of how they are described. This is made
precise by the idea of a ring isomorphism.
In order to understand this, we need to review some basic concepts and terminology

Chapter 7: Subrings and Unity
73
regarding functions. For this purpose, suppose that X and Y are arbitrary sets, and ϕ :
X →Y is a function. Recall that we call the set X the domain of the function, and Y the
range.
It may well be the case that Y contains elements that do not occur as ϕ(x) for any
x ∈X. Writing {ϕ(x) : x ∈X} as ϕ(X), we are saying that it may be the case that
ϕ(X) ⊂Y . If ϕ(X) = Y , we say that ϕ is a surjective. Alternatively, we say that ϕ is an
onto function.
For each element y of ϕ(X), there exists an element x of X such that ϕ(x) = y (this is
just the deﬁnition of ϕ(X)). If this element is unique for each such y ∈ϕ(X), we say that
ϕ is an injective function. Alternatively, we call ϕ a one-to-one function. Another way of
saying this is to assert that ϕ never takes two distinct elements of X to the same element
of Y .
If the function ϕ is both surjective and injective, we say that it is a bijective function.
Alternatively, we say that ϕ is a one-to-one correspondence. Note that if X is a ﬁnite
set and ϕ is a bijection, then X and Y have the same number of elements. Establishing a
one-to-one correspondence is exactly the way we count sets!
In the case that ϕ : X →Y is a bijection, then we can deﬁne a function ψ : Y →X
by letting ψ(y) be the unique element x of X for which ϕ(x) = y. Because ϕ is surjective,
there exists at least one such x; since ϕ is injective, there is exactly one such, and so ψ is
well-deﬁned as a function. We usually call ψ the inverse function of ϕ and even sometimes
write this as ψ = ϕ−1.
7.4
Ring Isomorphisms
We now wish to make precise the idea that two rings R and S are essentially the same; we
do this by using a function between them. We say that two rings R and S are isomorphic
if there is a function ϕ with ϕ : R →S which preserves algebra (ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) and
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b) for all a, b ∈R), and which preserves set theory (ϕ is bijective). These
properties together mean that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the rings as
sets, and that furthermore all algebra in R corresponds to algebra in S. We call the function
ϕ a ring isomorphism.
Here is a simple example that illustrates why this idea is useful. Consider the ring Q of
rational numbers, and the subring C of Q[x] consisting of the constant polynomials, that is
polynomials f = a0+a1x+a2x2+· · · where a1 = a2 = · · · = 0. It seems intuitively clear that
these two rings are essentially the same, even though the ﬁrst ring is a set of numbers and
the second is a set of polynomials. We make this precise by deﬁning a bijection ϕ deﬁned
on Q where ϕ(q) = q + 0x + 0x2 + · · ·. It is clear that this function preserves both addition
and multiplication, and so we can say that the rings Q and C are isomorphic. This ﬁrst
example seems quite obvious, but does show how the concept of ring isomorphism gives us
the language to express such ideas clearly and precisely.
Example 7.16
Here is a more interesting example. Consider the subring S of M2(Z) consisting of those
matrices which have zero entries everywhere except in the upper lefthand corner.
 Quick Exercise.
Check using the subring theorem that S is in fact a subring of
M2(Z).

As you compute in the ring S it quickly becomes clear that all the action occurs in

the upper lefthand corner, and that for all intents and purposes we are just doing
arithmetic in Z. We make this more precise by deﬁning the function ϕ : Z →S by
setting
ϕ(n) =
 n
0
0

.
This function is clearly bijective. Note that ϕ also preserves both addition and multi-
plication:

= ϕ(n) + ϕ(m).
A similar calculation shows ϕ(nm) = ϕ(n)ϕ(m).
 Quick Exercise.
Show this.

We thus say that Z and S are isomorphic rings, and mean by that that they are
algebraically ‘essentially the same.’
Example 7.17
Consider the ring D2(Z) from Example 7.9. By deﬁning the obvious ring isomorphism,
we can show that this ring is isomorphic to the ring Z × Z, from Example 6.9.
 Quick Exercise.
Carry this out. 
The deﬁnition of ring isomorphism is strong enough to imply that all signiﬁcant algebraic
structure is preserved. For example, suppose we have a ring isomorphism ϕ : R →S for two
rings R and S. If we denote the additive identities of these rings by 0R and 0S, we claim
that ϕ(0R) = 0S. To prove this, pick any s ∈S. Because ϕ is onto, there exists r ∈R with
ϕ(r) = s. But then
ϕ(0R) + s = ϕ(0R) + ϕ(r) = ϕ(0R + r) = ϕ(r) = s,
and so ϕ(0R) = 0S, because the additive identity in a ring is unique. In Exercise 26 you will
be asked to use a similar proof to show that if R has unity 1R, then ϕ(1R) is unity for the
ring S.
Our deﬁnition of ring isomorphism appears to depend on the order of the rings,
because the ring isomorphism above is deﬁned as a function from R to S. But
this is actually symmetric, because we can always deﬁne a ring isomorphism ψ
:
S
→R, where ψ is the inverse function we have discussed in Section 7.3 above.
We know that ψ makes sense as a bijection, and it is straightforward to prove that
ψ preserves addition and multiplication as well; you will do this in Exercise 27.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the notion of subring and proved that the subrings of a ring are
exactly those non-empty subsets closed under subtraction and multiplication. We provided
many examples of subrings.
We also deﬁned the notion of unity (or multiplicative identity) and observed that many
rings have unity, and many don’t.
Finally, we introduced the notion of ring isomorphism, to provide us with precise lan-
guage for saying that two rings are ‘essentially the same.’

20. Some students wonder why we require that the addition in a ring be commutative;
this exercise shows why. Suppose that R is a set with two operations + and ◦, which
satisfy the rules deﬁning a ring, except for Rule 1; that is, we do not assume that the
addition is commutative. Suppose that R also has a multiplicative identity 1. Then
prove that the addition in R must in fact be commutative, and so R under the given

Integral Domains and Fields
Something surprising happens in the arithmetic in Z6: Two non-zero elements 2 and 3 give
0 when multiplied together. This is something that never happens in Z (or Q or R). In fact,
this never happens in Z5.
 Quick Exercise.
Use the multiplication table for Z5 in Chapter 3 to check that the
product of two non-zero elements in Z5 is always non-zero. 
The fact that 2 · 3 = 0 in Z6 has undesirable consequences. For example, it means that
2 · 3 = 2 · 0, and so we cannot cancel the 2 from each side of this equation.
8.1
Zero Divisors
We make a deﬁnition to explore this situation: Let R be a commutative ring. An element
a ̸= 0 is a zero divisor if there exists an element b ∈R such that b ̸= 0 and ab = 0. Of
course, then b is a zero divisor also.
Example 8.1
Thus, the elements 2 and 3 in Z6 are zero divisors because 2 · 3 = 0. For another
example, consider the elements (1, 0) and (0, 1) in Z×Z. They are zero divisors because
(1, 0)(0, 1) = (0, 0). On the other hand, 2 is not a zero divisor in Z because the equation
2x = 0 has only x = 0 as a solution.
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the set of all zero divisors for the rings Z6, Z5, Z×Z, and
Z. 
You should have just concluded that the rings Z and Z5 have no zero divisors. This
desirable property we highlight by a deﬁnition: A commutative ring with unity that has no
zero divisors is called an integral domain, or simply a domain.
Example 8.2
Thus, Z and Z5 are integral domains, as are rings Q, R, and C.
Example 8.3
What about the ring Q[x]? We observed in Chapter 4 that the product of two non-zero
polynomials is non-zero, because the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees
(Theorem 4.1). Thus, Q[x] (and similarly Z[x]) is a domain, too.
81

82
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 8.4
On the other hand, we have seen that the rings Z ×Z and Z6 are not domains, simply
because we have already exhibited the existence of zero divisors in them. In fact, if n
is not prime, then Zn is not a domain.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that Zn is not a domain when n is not prime by exhibiting
zero divisors in each such ring. 
Notice that in the deﬁnition of domain we require both that it be commutative and have
unity. These restrictions are standard in the subject, and we will consequently adhere to
them. But note that this means that 2Z is not a domain, even though it is commutative
and has no zero divisors.
The arithmetic in integral domains is much simpler than in arbitrary commutative rings.
An important example of this is the content of the following theorem: We can cancel mul-
tiplicatively in a domain. Of course, we already saw above that multiplicative cancellation
fails in Z6.
Theorem 8.1
Multiplicative Cancellation
Suppose R is an integral domain and
a, b, c are elements of R, with a ̸= 0. If ab = ac, then b = c.
Proof:
Suppose that R is a domain, a ̸= 0, and ab = ac. Then ab −ac = 0. But then
a(b −c) = 0, and because R is a domain with a ̸= 0, we must have b −c = 0, or b = c, as
required.
2
If a, b, c had been rational numbers in the previous proof, we would have been inclined to
multiply both sides of the equation ab = ac by 1/a, the multiplicative inverse of a. However,
the proof of the theorem holds even in the absence of multiplicative inverses (as is the case
for most elements in Z).
8.2
Units
Of course, when multiplicative inverses do exist, life is much simpler. Let us introduce some
terminology to deal with this case. Suppose R is a ring with unity 1. Let a be any non-zero
element of R. We say a is a unit if there is an element b of R such that ab = ba = 1. In
this case, b is a (multiplicative) inverse of a. (Of course, b is also a unit with inverse a.)
First note that the unity 1 is always a unit, because 1 · 1 = 1. What other elements are
units? In Z, the units are just 1 and -1, because the only integer solutions of ab = 1 are ±1.
In Q and R, all non-zero elements are units. In Z6 we have 5 · 5 = 1, and so 5 is a unit, as
well as 1. Furthermore, there are no other elements a and b for which ab = 1 is true (see
the multiplication table for Z6 in Chapter 3).
Now consider the ring Q[x]; here unity is the constant polynomial 1. The units consist
of exactly the non-zero constant polynomials (that is, polynomials of degree zero). This
follows easily because the degree of the product of two polynomials is the sum of the
degrees (Theorem 4.1).
 Quick Exercise.
Find the units of these rings: Z5, Z12, Z × Z, R × R, Z[x]. 
Note that the concept of multiplicative inverse makes perfectly good sense in non-
commutative rings. For example, in the (non-commutative) ring of matrices M2(R), the

are units, because their product (in either order) is the multiplicative identity. In Exercise
2 you will obtain all the units in this ring.
We now claim that multiplicative inverses, if they exist, are unique. To show this, suppose
that a has multiplicative inverses b and c; that is, 1 = ba = ca. But now multiply through
these equations on the right by b: We then have b = bab = cab = c (where the last equation
holds because ab = 1 also). But then b = c, as required. Consequently, we will denote the
(unique) inverse of an element a (if it exists) by a−1. This is of course consistent with the
ordinary notation for multiplicative inverse which we use in R (and for matrix inverses in
linear algebra too).
We denote the set of units of a ring R by U(R). Thus, U(Z) = {1, −1}, U(Q) = Q\{0},
and U(Z6) = {1, 5}.
The set U(R) has some very nice properties, only some of which we can fully exploit right
now. What we wish to observe immediately is that U(R) is closed under multiplication.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is true for Z, Q, and Z6. 
To show that U(R) is closed under multiplication, suppose that a, b ∈U(R). Then we
claim ab is also a unit. But this is easy to see, because its inverse is just b−1a−1:
(ab)(b−1a−1) = a(bb−1)a−1 = aa−1 = 1,
and similarly for the product in the other order.
You might be surprised to see that taking the multiplicative inverse in a non-
commutative ring reverses the order of multiplication. But interpret a as putting on socks,
and b as putting on shoes. To reverse the operation ab of putting on both socks and shoes,
you must reverse the order: You take oﬀshoes ﬁrst, and so the inverse operation is b−1a−1.
You will explore the importance of the order of the multiplication of the elements a−1 and
b−1 in non-commutative rings in Exercise 3.
Students often confuse the unity of a ring with the concept of units, and you should
take care to understand the deﬁnition. The unity of a ring is unique if it exists, and it is
of course a unit (because it is its own multiplicative inverse). And a ring with units must
necessarily have unity (because otherwise the concept of multiplicative inverse makes no
sense). However, most rings have many units other than unity, as our examples above make
clear.
8.3
Associates
In our study of factorization in the rings Z and Q[x], we disregarded as insigniﬁcant the
factors ±1 in Z and the non-zero scalars in Q[x] – that is, exactly the factors that are units.
We can generalize this to any commutative ring with unity, by saying that two elements a
and b of a commutative ring with unity are associates if there exists a unit u such that
a = ub. Thus, if we speak intuitively, two elements are associates if they diﬀer by only a
‘trivial’ factor. Note that if a = ub where u is a unit, then b = u−1a, where u−1 is a unit.
That is, the relation of being associates is symmetric, as we might expect.

84
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 8.5
The set of units of Z consists of exactly {1, −1}, and so two elements are associates if
they diﬀer only by a factor of ±1.
Example 8.6
The set of units of Q[x] consists of the non-zero constant polynomials (which we can
identify with the non-zero rational numbers) and two polynomials are associates if they
diﬀer only by a (non-zero) rational multiple. Of course, this is exactly the deﬁnition
we made of ‘associate’ in Section 5.2, and so our general deﬁnition is consistent.
Example 8.7
In Z12, the units are {1, 5, 7, 11}; 4 and 8, for example, are associates, because 5·4 = 8.
 Quick Exercise.
What are the other associates of 4 in Z12? What are the asso-
ciates of 4 in Z20? 
Example 8.8
In Q, all non-zero elements are units, and so in this case all (non-zero) elements are
associates of one another.
8.4
Fields
Of course, rings like Q and R where all non-zero elements have multiplicative inverses seem
particularly attractive, and we emphasize them by making a deﬁnition: A commutative ring
with unity in which every non-zero element is a unit is called a ﬁeld. Another way to look
at the deﬁnition of a ﬁeld is this: It is a commutative ring in which one can always solve
equations of the form ax = b (when a ̸= 0). The solution is, of course, x = a−1b. In other
words: In all rings we can add, subtract, and multiply, but in ﬁelds we can also divide. Or
to say this yet another way, a ﬁeld is a commutative ring with unity for which all non-zero
elements are associates of one another.
Example 8.9
Thus, Q and R are ﬁelds. By the ﬁrst Quick Exercise in Section 8.2, Z5 is also a ﬁeld.
Every ﬁeld is a domain. This follows immediately from the next theorem.
Theorem 8.2 A ﬁeld has no zero divisors.
Proof:
Suppose F is a ﬁeld and a ∈F, with a ̸= 0. Now suppose that ab = 0. Then
0 = a−1 · 0 = a−1ab = b. Thus, a is not a zero divisor.
2
Note that the above proof actually shows that a unit of any ring cannot be a zero divisor.
For example, in Z6, the units are 1 and 5, while the zero divisors are 2, 3, and 4.

Chapter 8: Integral Domains and Fields
85
8.5
The Field of Complex Numbers
Another important example of a ﬁeld is the commutative ring C of complex numbers. (See
Exercise 6.11.) To see that this ring is actually a ﬁeld, we must compute the multiplicative
inverse of the arbitrary non-zero complex number α = a + bi, where a and b are real
numbers (not both zero). We do this ﬁrst by means of a bit of algebraic trickery.
The complex number a −bi we call the complex conjugate of a + bi. We write it as ¯α.
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the complex conjugates of the following complex numbers:
1 + i, 4 −1
2i, 6i, 7 
It is easy to see that the product of a complex number with its conjugate is a real
number:
α¯α = (a + bi)(a −bi) = a2 −(bi)2 = a2 + b2.
But this means that

and so any non-zero complex number has a multiplicative inverse. Thus, C is a ﬁeld. Note
also that R is a subring of this ﬁeld.
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the multiplicative inverses of the following complex num-
bers:
1 + i, 4 −1
2i, 6i, 7 
There is a geometric approach to understanding these computations. Because a complex
number a + bi is determined by an ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers, it is only natural to
associate with each complex number a point in the plane. The ﬁrst coordinate gives us the
real part of α, and the second coordinate gives us the imaginary part of α. We call the
plane interpreted in this way the complex plane.
• (a,b)

We can now talk about the length (or modulus) of a complex number. By the
Pythagorean Theorem, this is evidently just

α¯α.
We abbreviate this by |α|. This generalizes the notion of absolute value for real numbers.
 Quick Exercise.
Compute the moduli of the following complex numbers:
1 + i, 4 −1
2i, 6i, 7 

86
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
It is certainly true that the absolute value of a product of real numbers is the product
of the absolute values. That is,
|ab| = |a||b|.
This generalizes to complex numbers:
Theorem 8.3 For any complex numbers α and β,
|αβ| = |α||β|.
Proof:
Suppose that α = a + bi, and β = c + di are complex numbers. Then
|αβ|2
=
|(ac −bd) + (ad + bc)i|2 = (ac −bd)2 + (ad + bc)2
=
a2c2 + b2d2 + a2d2 + b2c2 = (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2)
=
|α|2|β|2.
By taking the (positive) square root of both sides, we obtain what we wish.
2
But a geometric understanding of complex multiplication extends even further than this.
Note that the radial line from the origin to the point (a, b) makes an angle with the positive
real axis. Let’s call this angle θ, and always choose it in the interval −π < θ ≤π. (We will
leave this angle undeﬁned for the complex number 0.) We call this angle the argument of
α and write it as arg(α).
 Quick Exercise.
Compute the arguments of the following complex numbers (you may
have to use a calculator to approximate the angle):

2i, 6i, 7 
As the following diagram suggests, this means that we can now write any non-zero
complex number as a product of its modulus (a positive real number), and a complex
number of length 1, which can be written trigonometrically:

We can now interpret multiplication in the ﬁeld C as a geometric operation. Suppose
that α and β are non-zero complex numbers, and we have factored them as
α = |α|(cos θ + i sin θ)

Chapter 8: Integral Domains and Fields
87
and
β = |β|(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ),
where θ and ϕ are, respectively, the arguments of α and β. To multiply these numbers, we
ﬁrst multiply the moduli to obtain the modulus of the product. Now let’s deal with the
trigonometric part. A surprising thing happens.
(cos θ + i sin θ)(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ) =
(cos θ cos ϕ −sin ϕ sin θ) + i(cos θ sin ϕ + cos ϕ sin θ) =
cos(θ + ϕ) + i sin(θ + ϕ).
(We have used two familiar trigonometric identities.) This means that the argument of a
product is the sum of the arguments (except that we may have to adjust the angle by 2π if
θ + ϕ does not fall between −π and π).
 Quick Exercise.
Verify this statement about the argument of a product by computing
the arguments of the products (1 + i)(6i) and (−1 + i)(1 +
√
3i) in two ways. 
We record this statement precisely for future reference:
Theorem 8.4
DeMoivre’s Theorem
Let θ and ϕ be two angles. Then
(cos θ + i sin θ)(cos ϕ + i sin ϕ) =
cos(θ + ϕ) + i sin(θ + ϕ).
This theorem is often written in a very compact way by making use of exponential
notation. If we deﬁne eiθ = cos θ+i sin θ, then DeMoivre’s Theorem takes the form eiθeiϕ =
ei(θ+ϕ). Remarkably enough, this expression actually makes sense analytically, where e =
2.71828 · · · is the base of the natural logarithm. In this book we will use this only as a
formal shorthand for the more explicit expression involving the sine and cosine function. In
Exercise 21 you will explore a derivation of the exponential form of DeMoivre’s Theorem
that depends on power series from calculus.
We can now interpret the computations of inverses in the ﬁeld C geometrically. If we
wish to compute the multiplicative inverse of the non-zero complex number
α = |α|(cos θ + i sin θ) = |α|eiθ,
we need a complex number whose modulus is 1/|α| (because the modulus of 1 is 1), and
whose argument is −θ (because the argument of 1 is 0). What this means geometrically is
this: Flip through the x-axis (which obtains the complex conjugate), and then adjust the
length.
(|α| cos θ, |α| sin θ)
−θ
θ
(1/|α| cos(−θ), 1/|α| sin(−θ))

88
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Notice how simple this appears if we use exponential notation. For if α = |α|eiθ, then
α−1 = |α|−1  eiθ−1 = |α|−1e−iθ.
For us, this is not really a rigorous calculation though, because we are assuming that the
complex exponentiation obeys ordinary rules of exponentiation. This is actually true, and
the calculation remains illuminating and suggestive.
In future chapters we will return often to the ﬁeld of complex numbers, as a very im-
portant example, both practically and historically.
We have based our discussion of the ﬁeld of complex numbers on your previous experience
with the real numbers: The arithmetic of C comes entirely out of our understanding of the
ﬁeld properties of R. Actually, it is possible to carefully prove that Q and R are ﬁelds, by
basing their arithmetic on the arithmetic of the ring Z. In this book we will not enquire
into these details, and rely instead on your previous experience with these sets of numbers.
We will continue to use Q and R (and now C too) as some of our most important examples
of ﬁelds.
8.6
Finite Fields
To provide further examples of ﬁelds, we now turn our attention to the important collection
of commutative rings, Zn. We will determine which of these are ﬁelds. From our examples
above, we know that Z5 is a ﬁeld while Z6 is not. These examples suggest the following
theorem:
Theorem 8.5 Zn is a ﬁeld if and only if n is prime.
Proof:
If n is not prime, then n = xy for some 0 < x, y < n. But then in Zn, [x][y] = [0].
So, Zn could not be a ﬁeld by Theorem 8.2.
Conversely, suppose n is prime and let 0 < x < n. We need to establish the existence
of [x]−1. That is, we must ﬁnd a y with [x][y] = [1]. Because n is prime, we know that
gcd(n, x) = 1. Then by the GCD identity 2.4, there exist r, s such that rn + sx = 1. But
then [s][x] = [1] −[rn] = [1], and so [x]−1 = [s].
2
The proof above has an interesting application: We can use it to compute multiplicative
inverses in Zp, where p is prime.
Example 8.10
Let’s compute [23]−1 in Z119. First apply Euclid’s Algorithm to obtain the equation
1 = (6)(119) + (−31)(23). But then [23]−1 = [−31] = [88].
 Quick Exercise.
Check directly that [23][88] = [1] in Z119. 
Thus, the general recipe for computing [x]−1 in Zp is this: Given x and p, apply Euclid’s
Algorithm to show that gcd(p, x) = 1, and then work backward through the resulting
equations to obtain r and s. Reducing s modulo p then gives the appropriate residue class.
Notice that this method applies even if p is not prime, as long as gcd(p, x) = 1. We can
then conclude the following:
Theorem 8.6 Let 0 < x < m. Then [x] is a unit in the Zm if and only if gcd(x, m) = 1.

Chapter 8: Integral Domains and Fields
89
Proof:
To show that [x] has an inverse, merely repeat the argument above.
Conversely, if gcd(x, m) = d and d ̸= 1, then m = rd and x = sd, where r and s are
integers with m > r, s > 1. But then [x][r] = [sdr] = [sm] = [0]. That is, [x] is a zero
divisor, and so cannot be a unit.
(Notice that if you have done Exercises 3.5 and 3.6, then you have already completed
this proof!)
2
For an alternative approach to computing [x]−1 in Zp, we consider a beautiful and
important theorem due to the 17th-century French mathematician Fermat.
Theorem 8.7
Fermat’s Little Theorem
If p is prime and 0 < x < p, then
xp−1 ≡1(mod p). Hence, in Zp, [x]−1 = [x]p−2.
Example 8.11
In Z5, this theorem asserts that [3]4 = [1]. But then [3][3]3 = [1], and so [3]−1 = [3]3 =
[27] = [2].
Proof:
Suppose that p is prime and 0 < x < p. Then [x] is a non-zero element of the ﬁeld
Zp. Consider the set S of non-zero multiples of [x] in Zp:
S = {[x · 1], [x · 2], . . . , [x · (p −1)]}.
Because a ﬁeld has no zero divisors, each element of S is non-zero. Because a ﬁeld satisﬁes
multiplicative cancellation, no two of these elements are the same.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
Thus, the set S consists of p −1 distinct non-zero elements and so must consist of the
set
{[1], [2], · · · , [p −1]}
of all non-zero elements in Zp, in some order. (It might be helpful for you at this point in
the proof to verify this fact in a particular case; see Exercise 11.)
We now multiply all the elements of S together; this is the same as multiplying all the
non-zero elements of Zp together. We thus obtain the following equation in Zp:
[1][2] · · · [p −1][x]p−1 = [1][2] · · · [p −1].
But by multiplicative cancellation in the domain Zp, we may cancel the non-zero elements
[1], [2], · · · , [p −1] from each side of this equation, leaving [x]p−1 = [1]. Or in other words,
xp−1 ≡1(mod p), as claimed.
2
Example 8.12
As another example of this theorem, consider the element [3] in Z7. To compute [3]−1
we do the following:
35 ≡((32)2)(3) ≡(92)(3) ≡(22)(3) ≡(4)(3) ≡12 ≡5.
Thus, [3]−1 = [5]; you can check directly that [3][5] = [1].

90
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
We have now exhibited inﬁnitely many distinct ﬁnite ﬁelds (Zp for any prime p). It is
natural to ask whether this is a complete list. We shall discover later that there are ﬁelds
with ﬁnitely many elements which are not of the form Zp, but we will need to know a lot
more about ﬁeld theory. (See Chapter 45 and also Exercise 15.)
Note that we have not exhibited a ﬁnite domain that is not a ﬁeld. There is good reason
for this: The next theorem asserts that all ﬁnite domains are actually ﬁelds. Of course, the
ﬁniteness here is important; Z is an example of an inﬁnite domain that is not a ﬁeld.
Theorem 8.8 All ﬁnite domains are ﬁelds.
Proof:
Suppose D is a ﬁnite domain with n elements. Then we can list the elements of D
as 0, d2, · · · , dn. (Somewhere in this list must occur the multiplicative identity 1.) Suppose
now that a is a non-zero element of D. It is then one of the di, where i ≥2. Consider now
the list of n −1 elements ad2, ad3, · · · , adn. Because D is a domain, none of these elements
are 0. Because multiplicative cancellation holds in a domain, no two of these elements are
the same (because if adi = adj, then di = dj by cancellation). There are thus n −1 distinct
elements in this list. This means the list consists of all the non-zero elements of D. But
then adi = 1 for some i, because 1 is certainly one of the non-zero elements of D. This
means that a is a unit. Hence, all non-zero elements of D are units, and so D is a ﬁeld.
2
You should think carefully about why the proof of the above theorem does not work
when the domain in question has inﬁnitely many elements. (See Exercise 13.)
Historical Remarks
Pierre Fermat was one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, even
though he was an amateur. A lawyer by trade, he did most of his mathematical work in
the evenings, as an intellectually stimulating recreation. Consequently, almost no mathe-
matics under his name was published until after his death. He did engage actively in the
mathematical life of his day, by corresponding with most of the great names in physics and
mathematics of the era; such men as Huygens and Descartes were his correspondents. In this
way, many of Fermat’s results became well known to the mathematical community of the
time. In the present day, mathematicians (and other scientists) communicate their results
in widely available scholarly journals. In this way, scientiﬁc results can be easily used (and
checked) by others. This sort of wide access to scientiﬁc knowledge was not yet available in
the 17th century. The evolution toward that system began only with the founding of such
scholarly societies as the Royal Society in Britain, near the end of the seventeenth century.
Fermat’s Little Theorem is so called to distinguish it from his Great or Last Theorem.
This asserts that there are no solutions in non-zero integers to the equation
xn + yn = zn,
whenever n > 2. (Of course, there are many such solutions when n = 2; for example,
32 + 42 = 52.) This assertion was found, without proof, in a margin of a book of Fermat’s
after his death. He noted that the margin was insuﬃciently large to contain his ‘truly
marvelous demonstration.’ Because no mathematician for 350 years was able to prove this
assertion, it seems highly unlikely that Fermat could prove it. Attempts to prove what might
more properly be called Fermat’s Last Conjecture have had an important impact on the
development of abstract algebra. But note that if there had been a system of mathematical
journals at that time, we might now have an answer to this famous problem, or at least
know whether Fermat’s proof was fallacious! In 1993 the British mathematician Andrew

Wiles thrilled the mathematical world by announcing that he had proved Fermat’s Last
Theorem, basing his results on a large body of modern mathematical work. A gap in his
proof was discovered as his work underwent the present-day scrutiny of peer review, but
Wiles and his colleague Richard Taylor were able to ﬁll in the gap, and complete the proof
of a 350 year old conjecture.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter, we deﬁned integral domains (commutative rings with unity without zero
divisors) and ﬁelds (commutative rings in which all elements have multiplicative inverses).
We proved the following theorems about ﬁelds and domains:
• Multiplicative cancellation holds in integral domains.
• Every ﬁeld is an integral domain.
• Every ﬁnite integral domain is a ﬁeld.
• The ring Zn is a ﬁeld exactly if n is prime.
• Fermat’s Little Theorem.
This last theorem gives a method for computing multiplicative inverses in Zp, for p prime.

such that ad−bc ̸= 0. In this case, you can ﬁnd a formula for the multiplicative inverse
of the matrix. We call ad −bc the determinant of the matrix. And so the units of
M2(R) are those matrices with non-zero determinant; we will explore the notion of
determinant further in Example 22.5.
3. Find two non-commuting units A, B in M2(R), and check that (AB)−1 = B−1A−1

14. Let R be a commutative ring with unity. Suppose that n is the least positive integer
for which we get 0 when we add 1 to itself n times; we then say R has characteristic
n. If there exists no such n, we say that R has characteristic 0. For example, the
characteristic of Z5 is 5 because 1+1+1+1+1 = 0, whereas 1+1+1+1 ̸= 0. (Note
that here we have suppressed ‘[’ and ‘]’.)

(b) What are the characteristics of Q, R, Z17?
(c) Prove that if a ﬁeld F has characteristic n, where n > 0, then n is a prime
integer.
(d) Suppose that R and S are commutative rings with unity that are isomorphic.
Prove that R and S have the same characteristic.
15. Consider the commutative ring

the characteristics of F and Z4 (see the previous exercise). Alternatively, use
Exercise 7.
16. Suppose that R is a commutative ring, and a is a non-zero nilpotent element. (See

21. Recall the Taylor series expansions centered at 0 for the three functions sin x, cos x, ex.
(These are also called the MacLaurin series for these functions.) In calculus we discover
that these series converge to their functions absolutely for all real numbers x. Let’s
assume that these series also make sense for imaginary numbers ix . By replacing x
in ex by ix, and rearranging terms of the series, verify that eix = cos x + i sin x, for
all real numbers x. (This veriﬁcation can be made rigorous, using analytic techniques
we will avoid here.)

Chapter 9
Ideals
In this chapter we will introduce a particularly nice kind of subring, called a principal ideal,
and then generalize yet further to deﬁne ideals in an arbitrary commutative ring. It turns
out that we will be able to better understand the arithmetic in a given ring by changing our
perspective from the properties of individual elements, to considering ideals instead. This
was a great insight brought to the subject by such nineteenth century mathematicians as
Ernst Kummer and Richard Dedekind: Diﬃculties in some rings can be better understood
by thinking of some ‘ideal’ elements for our ring, in addition to the ordinary elements
we have. We will thus begin by translating elementwise properties into statements about
corresponding principal ideals, and then discover that non-principal ideals really do ﬁll in
certain gaps in our understanding.
9.1
Principal Ideals
We discovered in Examples 7.6 and 7.7 (and in Exercises 7.4 and 7.5) that subrings of Z
of the form mZ carry the divisibility information for the particular integer m. We generalize
this: Let R be any commutative ring, and a ∈R. We then let
⟨a⟩= {b ∈R : b = ax, for some x ∈R}.
We then call ⟨a⟩a principal ideal, and call a a generator for ⟨a⟩.
We claim that ⟨a⟩is a subring. We ﬁrst show that it is closed under subtraction. For if
x, y ∈⟨a⟩, then x = ar and y = as, for some r, s ∈R. But then x −y = ar −as = a(r −s),
which is clearly a multiple of a, and so an element of ⟨a⟩. To show that ⟨a⟩is closed under
multiplication, suppose that x, y ∈⟨a⟩. Then x = ar, y = as, and so xy = aras = a(ras).
This latter element is a multiple of a, and so belongs to ⟨a⟩.
Example 9.1
Let’s discuss the principal ideals in Z. Here is a complete list:
⟨0⟩
=
{0},
⟨1⟩= ⟨−1⟩= Z,
⟨2⟩
=
⟨−2⟩= {x ∈Z : x is even},
⟨3⟩= ⟨−3⟩,
⟨4⟩= ⟨−4⟩, · · · .
Note that we had earlier referred to these latter principal ideals as 2Z, 3Z, 4Z, etc.
Example 9.2
Clearly, the principal ideal ⟨3⟩in Z12 consists of the elements {0, 3, 6, 9}.
97

98
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 9.3
Consider the principal ideal ⟨
√
5⟩in Z[
√
5] (if necessary, see Exercise 7.2 where we
introduce such rings). What does a typical element of this ideal look like? All such
elements are multiples of
√
5, and this naturally leads one to think of such elements as
√
5, −
√
5, 2
√
5, and so forth. However, these are merely integer multiples of
√
5, and we
must allow multiples of
√
5 by any element from the ring in question, namely Z[
√
5].
Thus, a typical element of this principal ideal is an element of the form (a+b
√
5)(
√
5) =
5b + a
√
5. This means that
⟨
√
5⟩= {5r + s
√
5 : r, s ∈Z}.
That is, ⟨
√
5⟩consists of all elements of Z[
√
5] whose “rational part” is divisible by 5.
Example 9.4
Let’s now look at the principal ideal ⟨x2⟩in Q[x]. This consists of all multiples of
x2; that is, those polynomials with x2 as a factor. Equivalently, ⟨x2⟩is the set of all
polynomials whose constant and degree 1 coeﬃcients are zero. More generally, ⟨f⟩in
Q[x] consists of all polynomials with f as a factor.
Example 9.5
Consider the principal ideal ⟨2⟩in the ring 2Z of even integers. In this example, when
we form the multiples of 2, we are restricted only to even numbers. Thus,
⟨2⟩= {· · · , 0, 4, 8, 12, · · ·}.
Notice that in this case 2 /∈⟨2⟩. This situation arises because 2Z lacks unity.
Note that if our ring does have unity (as will usually be the case), we then have that
a = a1 ∈⟨a⟩, thus avoiding the perversity of the previous example.
We also observe that for any commutative ring with unity the trivial and improper
subrings are always principal ideals, because ⟨0⟩= {0} and ⟨1⟩= R (because any element
of R is a multiple of 1). (We saw that this was true in Z in the example above.)
Now, one of our goals in this chapter is change our focus from individual elements
to principal ideals (and ideals in general, when we deﬁne them below). Our ﬁrst step in
that direction is the observation that divisibility in the ring can be rephrased in terms of
containment of principal ideals. That is, if r, s, t ∈R, a commutative ring, then r = st if
and only if ⟨r⟩⊆⟨s⟩.
 Quick Exercise.
Prove this. 
Note that ‘smaller’ elements in terms of factorization lead to bigger ideals, in the sense of
set containment. We record this as a simple theorem:
Theorem 9.1 Let R be a commutative ring with unity, with r ∈R. Then ⟨r⟩⊆⟨s⟩if and
only if r = st, for some t ∈R.
Our goal now is to better understand when two principal ideals are equal. First, let’s
consider the case when ⟨r⟩= R, where R is a commutative ring with unity, and r ∈R. This
means that 1 is a multiple of r; but if rs = 1, then r is a unit. And conversely, if r is a unit,
then 1 = rt, for some t ∈R. But then x = r(tx), for any x ∈R. Thus, all elements of R are
multiples of r. We have thus shown that in a commutative ring with unity, ⟨r⟩= R if and
only if r is a unit. We record this as a theorem:

Chapter 9: Ideals
99
Theorem 9.2 Let R be a commutative ring with unity, with r ∈R. Then ⟨r⟩= R if and
only if r is a unit.
 Quick Exercise.
Consider the unit 5 in Z12. Verify explicitly that ⟨5⟩= Z12. (That
is, show by computation that every element of the ring is a multiple of 5.)

To illuminate our discussion, let’s return to the principal ideals in Q[x].
Example 9.6
Consider the ideal ⟨x⟩in Q[x]. Clearly, this consists of those polynomials with no
constant term. But what about the ideal ⟨3x⟩? We claim that ⟨x⟩= ⟨3x⟩. It is clear
that ⟨3x⟩⊆⟨x⟩, but the reverse inclusion holds too, because x =
1
3(3x), and so
x ∈⟨3x⟩.
This example (and also our discussion of the principal ideals in Z) suggests an answer
to the question of when two elements of a commutative ring generate the same principal
ideal. The answer given in the next theorem for domains does not hold for all commutative
rings.
Theorem 9.3 Let R be a domain, and r, s ∈R. Then ⟨r⟩= ⟨s⟩if and only if r and s are
associates.
Proof:
Suppose ﬁrst that r and s are associates. Then r = su, where u is a unit. Thus, r
is a multiple of s, and so r ∈⟨s⟩. Hence, ⟨r⟩⊆⟨s⟩. But s = ru−1, and so similarly ⟨s⟩⊆⟨r⟩.
For the converse, suppose that ⟨r⟩= ⟨s⟩. Then r is a multiple of s and vice versa; that
is, r = sx and s = ry, for some x and y. But then r = ryx, and so by the multiplicative
cancellation property for domains, 1 = yx. That is, y and x are units, and so r and s are
associates.
2
Example 9.7
In the Gaussian integers, we know that 1 + i is a non-unit, and so ⟨1 + i⟩⊂Z[i] but
⟨1 + i⟩= ⟨1 −i⟩.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify these assertions.

Example 9.8
Consider the ring Z[
√
2]. (See Exercise 7.1.) In Exercise 8.6 we discovered that (1 +
√
2)2 = 3 + 2
√
2 is a unit in this ring. Now
√
2 is not a unit, and we have that
√
2(3+2
√
2) = 4+3
√
2. Thus
√
2 and 4+3
√
2 are associates, and so ⟨
√
2⟩= ⟨4+3
√
2⟩.
This is not so obvious at ﬁrst glance!
9.2
Ideals
The concept of a principal ideal is really quite concrete: It is just the set of all multiples of
a given element, which we call the generator. We’ve then seen that this is always a subring.
But to move further we must make an abstract deﬁnition of an ideal in general:
Let R be a commutative ring with unity. An ideal of R is a non-empty subset I of R
satisfying the following criteria:

100
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
1. I is closed under subtraction;
2. If a ∈I and r ∈R, then ar ∈I.
Thus, an ideal is a subring that satisﬁes the stronger multiplicative closure property (2).
This property says that I ‘absorbs’ multiplication by any ring element. We remind ourselves
of this by calling (2) the multiplicative absorption property of ideals.
We have made this deﬁnition only for commutative rings, because we deal primarily
with such rings in this book. However, the deﬁnition above can be modiﬁed to account for
the notion of ideal in the non-commutative case: Simply strengthen (2) to require that both
ar and ra belong to I if a ∈I.
We ﬁrst make the expected observation: A principal ideal is in fact an ideal. That is, a
principal ideal satisﬁes the multiplicative absorption property. But this is quite clear:
 Quick Exercise.
Check this.

With our new deﬁnition of ideal, we can now think of a principal ideal ⟨a⟩⊆R more
conceptually: It is the smallest ideal of R containing a. This merely means that ⟨a⟩is a
subset of any ideal of R containing a. But this is obvious because if a ∈I, where I is an
ideal, then by the multiplicative absorption property for I, all multiples of a are elements
of I.
Example 9.9
Consider now the ring Q. We know that Z is a subring of Q. Is it an ideal of Q?
Suppose it is; we now apply the multiplicative absorption property to the element 1
of Z. Choose any rational number q. Then by multiplicative absorption, (q)(1) = q
would be an element of Z, which is certainly not always true. Thus, Z is a subring of
Q which is not an ideal.
This example can clearly be generalized: If an ideal contains any unit, it is the whole
ring. Now, because all non-zero elements in a ﬁeld are units, a ﬁeld has only the two ideals
that all commutative rings possess: namely, the zero ideal and the improper ideal. The
converse is also true:
Corollary 9.4 A commutative ring with unity is a ﬁeld if and only if its only ideals are
the trivial and improper ideals.
Proof:
We have already proved half of this corollary. For the converse, suppose that R is
a commutative ring with unity whose only ideals are the trivial and improper ideals. Choose
any non-zero element r ∈R. Because r is non-zero, then ⟨r⟩̸= {0}, and so ⟨r⟩= R. But
then 1 ∈⟨r⟩, and so 1 = rs, for some element s. But then r is a unit. Thus, all non-zero
elements of R are units, and so R is a ﬁeld.
2
9.3
Ideals That Are Not Principal
Before proceeding, we should ﬁrst convince you that there do exist ideals that are not
principal. It turns out that we can ﬁnd such ideals in the domain Z[x].
To describe such an example we ﬁrst introduce a little more general notation. Suppose
that R is a commutative ring with unity and a, b ∈R. We shall deﬁne ⟨a, b⟩as
{ax + by : x, y ∈R}.

Chapter 9: Ideals
101
We leave it as Exercise 11 below for you to prove that this is an ideal and is in fact the
smallest ideal of R that contains both a and b. (In fact, this idea can be generalized to ideals
generated by any ﬁnite number of elements; see Exercise 12.) Note that ⟨a, b⟩is really just
the set of all linear combinations of a and b (where the coeﬃcients on a and b are allowed
to be any ring elements).
Example 9.10
In the ring Z, the ideal ⟨12, 9⟩consists of the set of all linear combinations of 12 and
9. We know from our work about the integers that this is the set of all multiples of
gcd(12, 9) = 3 (by the GCD identity), and so
⟨12, 9⟩= ⟨3⟩.
This is a principal ideal. In Z we can always ﬁnd a single generator for an ideal of the
form ⟨a, b⟩using what we know about the arithmetic in that ring.
Example 9.11
The ring Q[x] also has a GCD identity. We can then infer that
⟨x2 + 3x, x3 −x2 + 3x −3⟩
is a principal ideal, by computing its single generator.
 Quick Exercise.
Do this. 
Example 9.12
For a ﬁrst example of a non-principal ideal, let’s work in the ring Z[x]. We claim that
the ideal ⟨2, x⟩is not principal. To see this, we will ﬁrst look more closely at arbitrary
elements of this ideal. Any element of it is of the form 2f + xg, where f and g are
arbitrary polynomials from Z[x]. Let’s consider the constant term of this polynomial.
The polynomial xg has no constant term, and so the constant term for 2f + xg is
equal to the constant term of 2f. This constant must be even. Thus, every element in
⟨2, x⟩has even constant term. But conversely, consider any polynomial in Z[x] with
even constant term. We can write such a polynomial as 2n + xh ∈⟨2, x⟩, where n is
an integer, and h is a polynomial. Thus, ⟨2, x⟩consists of all polynomials with even
constant term. (Note of course that zero is an even integer.)
We now claim that ⟨2, x⟩is not a principal ideal. If it were, with generator f, then
all polynomials in the ideal would be multiples of f. In particular, 2 and x would be
multiples of f. Because 2 is a multiple of f, the degree of f must be zero. But the only
zero-degree polynomials that have x as a multiple are ±1. Neither of these could be f,
because their constant terms are odd. Thus, ⟨2, x⟩is not a principal ideal. (You might
want to compare this discussion to the ﬁrst Quick Exercise in Section 5.3.)
The contrast between these two examples is important: In Z, two non-zero elements
always have a greatest common divisor, and that element serves as the single generator of
the ideal ⟨12, 9⟩. In contrast, in Z[x] we cannot always make sense of a greatest common
divisor, and so an ideal such as ⟨2, x⟩has no single generator.

All Ideals in Z Are Principal
We can now express in abstract terms the underlying reason why the arithmetic in Z is
so nice: All ideals are actually principal.
Theorem 9.5 All ideals of Z are principal.
Proof:
Suppose that I is an ideal of Z. We wish to show that I is principal. If I is the zero
ideal this is already obvious; so suppose I has more elements than just 0. What element
of I might serve as a generator for I? We answer this question by using the Well-ordering
Principle: Choose the smallest positive element m of I.
 Quick Exercise.
Why need I have any positive elements? 
We claim that ⟨m⟩= I. Because I is an ideal (and so satisﬁes the multiplicative absorption
property), it is clear that ⟨m⟩⊆I. Suppose now that b ∈I. We claim b ∈⟨m⟩; that is,
we claim that b is a multiple of m. To check this, we will use the Division Theorem 2.1
to obtain a quotient q and a remainder r where b = qm + r. Obviously, we hope that the
remainder is zero. But what do we know about r? Because r = b −qm, r ∈I, using both
of the deﬁning properties of ideal. But we also know that 0 ≤r < m, and because m is the
smallest positive element of I, r = 0, as required. Thus for Z, all ideals are principal.
2
We are leaving it to you in Exercise 2 below to show that the same fact holds true for
Q[x]. By this time you should not be surprised by this analogy between Z and Q[x]. The
proof you will construct is similar, except you will choose m to be a non-zero polynomial
with smallest degree in the ideal.
We close with a deﬁnition: An integral domain is a principal ideal domain (or PID)
if all its ideals are principal. Thus we can say that Z and Q[x] are PIDs while Z[x] is not.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁne a principal ideal in a commutative ring, which is just the set of
multiples of a given particular element. Divisibility properties in the ring can be rephrased
in terms of principal ideals. The idea of principal ideal leads to a more general deﬁnition
of an ideal, which is a subring that also satisﬁes the multiplicative absorption property. In
some integral domains, all ideals are principal (these are called principal ideal domains),
but this is not always the case.

tion with coeﬃcients from Q[x], where we then have to use a diﬀerent symbol y for
the new indeterminate, gives us the ring Q[x, y]. It turns out (though we won’t verify
all details here) that addition and multiplication in this ring behave just as you would
expect. Formally then, an element of Q[x, y] can be viewed as an element of the form
a0,0 + a1,0x + a0,1y + a2,0x2 + a1,1xy + a0,2y2 + · · · ,

Chapter 10
Polynomials over a Field
In this chapter we generalize what we’ve learned about Q[x], the ring of polynomials with
rational coeﬃcients, by replacing the rational numbers by entries from an arbitrary ﬁeld.
We will discover that the resulting rings behave very similarly to Q[x], and hence to the
ring Z as well.
10.1
Polynomials with Coeﬃcients from an Arbitrary Field
Suppose we consider polynomials with coeﬃcients not from Q, but from some arbitrary
ﬁeld F. We denote this set of polynomials by F[x]. Addition and multiplication are deﬁned
as in Q[x], but when coeﬃcients are added or multiplied, it is done in F.
Example 10.1
Consider Z2[x], the set of polynomials with coeﬃcients from Z2. (So coeﬃcients are
either 0 or 1.) Consider the sum and product of x2 + x + 1 and x2 + 1:
(x2 + x + 1) + (x2 + 1) = (x2 + x2) + x + (1 + 1) = x;
and
(x2 + x + 1)(x2 + 1)
=
(x4 + x3 + x2) + (x2 + x + 1)
=
x4 + x3 + (x2 + x2) + x + 1
=
x4 + x3 + x + 1.
Notice how various of the above terms disappear, because 1 + 1 = 0 in the ring Z2
of coeﬃcients. Similar care must be taken with other ﬁnite ﬁelds.
 Quick Exercise.
Compute the sum, diﬀerence, and product of x2+2x+1 and x2+x+2
in Z3[x] (here, the coeﬃcients consist of 0, 1, or 2). List all the units in Z3[x]. Then write
down all the associates of x2 + 2x + 2 in Z3[x].

It is clear that F[x] (like Q[x]) is a commutative ring with unity; in fact, it is an integral
domain. But these two rings have much more in common than that.
 Quick Exercise.
Convince yourself that F[x] is an integral domain.

If you return to Chapters 4 and 5 and look at the theorems (and their proofs), you’ll
see that every theorem about Q[x] is valid if Q is replaced by a ﬁeld F of your choice.
The properties of Q that are important in those theorems are the ﬁeld properties of Q. As
before, the theorem that is the driving force is the Division Theorem.

Prove the Division Theorem for F[x], by carefully re-reading the
proof of this theorem for Q[x]. You will see that multiplicative inverses for coeﬃcients are
required in this proof, but nothing else special about Q.

So, the Division Theorem, the Root Theorem, Euclid’s Algorithm, the GCD identity,
and the Unique Factorization Theorem hold for R[x], C[x], and Zp[x] (for prime p), as well
as F[x] where F is any other ﬁeld. Notice that to make sense of these theorems in this new
and more general context, we must be careful also to deﬁne the terms as irreducible and
prime.

Check that our deﬁnitions for these terms for Q[x] still make sense
for F[x]. 
 Quick Exercise.
State the Unique Factorization Theorem for F[x], where F is an
arbitrary ﬁeld. 
It is perhaps just as well to pause here a moment, and make certain that you are
aware of what we have just done. We have just asserted (and you have checked!) that the
statement and proofs of the Division Theorem, the Root Theorem, Euclid’s Algorithm,
the GCD identity, and the Unique Factorization Theorem generalize when Q is replaced
by any ﬁeld whatsoever. This is a striking example of the power of generalization and
abstraction in algebra. We will devote the rest of this chapter to examining many examples
of these theorems in action, using various ﬁelds (other than Q) for the coeﬃcients on our
polynomials.
Example 10.2
Let’s ﬁnd a gcd of x3 + x + 1 and x2 + 1 in Z2[x], using Euclid’s Algorithm:
x3 + x + 1
=
(x2 + 1)x + 1
x2 + 1
=
1(x2 + 1) + 0.
Therefore, 1 is a gcd of x3 + x + 1 and x2 + 1. Now any other gcd of these two
polynomials would be an associate of 1. That is, it would be a non-zero scalar multiple
of 1. But in Z2[x], the only non-zero scalar is 1 itself. Thus, in Z2[x], 1 is the unique
gcd of x3 + x + 1 and x2 + 1.
 Quick Exercise.
Write 1 as a linear combination of x3 + x + 1 and x2 + 1 in
Z2[x]. 
Example 10.3
Let’s now compute a gcd of x5 + x2 + 1 and x2 + 2 in Z3[x]:
x5 + x2 + 1
=
(x2 + 2)(x3 + x + 1) + (x + 2)
x2 + 2
=
(x + 2)(x + 1) + 0.
Therefore, x + 2 is a gcd of x5 + x2 + 1 and x2 + 2 in Z3[x].
 Quick Exercise.
Divide x5 + x2 + 1 by x + 2 in Z3[x].

10.2
Polynomials with Complex Coeﬃcients
Given a quadratic polynomial with real coeﬃcients, you probably recall the quadratic
formula that provides the roots for the polynomial; you may recall that the formula is
proved by means of an algebraic technique called completing the square.
To demonstate this, suppose that f = ax2 + bx + c ∈R[x], with a ̸= 0. To solve the
equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 we can do a little algebra to obtain x2 + b
ax = −c
a. To make
the left side of the equation a perfect square, we add the term
  b
2a
2 to both sides of the
equation. With a little further algebraic simpliﬁcation (see Exercise 1), we obtain the usual
form for the quadratic formula:
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
.
The quantity D = b2 −4ac is called the discriminant of f. Clearly the two roots are
equal if D = 0, and we get two distinct real roots if D > 0.
But if D < 0, the quadratic formula gives two distinct complex roots, which are conju-
gates of one another. Now by the Root Theorem these two roots also give a factorization of
f (in C[x]) into linear polynomials:
f = ax2 + bx + c = a
 
x −−b +
√
b2 −4ac
2a
!  
x −−b −
√
b2 −4ac
2a
!
.
But in this case it is now clear that f cannot be non-trivially factored in R[x]. For if it
did so factor, it would then also have real roots, making more than two roots for f in C,
which is impossible.
We have thus shown that if f ∈R[x] is a quadratic polynomial with negative discrimi-
nant, then it is an irreducible element of R[x]. But any such quadratic polynomial can be
factored further in C[x].
Example 10.4
Let’s factor the polynomial
f = x3 −7x2 + 17x −15 ∈R[x],
into irreducibles, in both R[x] and C[x]. By the Root Theorem, x −3 is a factor of f
because f(3) = 0. We can then factor x −3 out of f:
f = (x −3)(x2 −4x + 5).
Because x −3 is linear, it is irreducible. Now consider x2 −4x + 5. Its discriminant is
D = −4 < 0, and so x2 −4x + 5 is the other irreducible factor of f in R[x]. But if we
apply the quadratic formula we obtain two linear irreducible factors in C[x]:
f = (x −3)(x −2 + i)(x −2 −i).
The example we’ve just examined, showing that more factorization is possible in C[x]
than in R[x], is a particular example of an important general fact about C[x]: Every non-
constant polynomial in C[x] can be factored into linear factors. This fact is known as
the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a very important theorem ﬁrst proved rigorously by
Gauss. We won’t prove this theorem here. The easiest proof of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra uses complex analysis and is accessible only to those who have taken an introductory
course in that subject. We will state the Fundamental Theorem in an (apparently weaker)
form, and then prove the statement we’ve made above as a corollary.

112
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Theorem 10.1
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
Every non-constant polyno-
mial in C[x] has a root in C.
Proof:
We omit this proof, and refer the reader to any introductory text in complex
analysis.
2
Corollary 10.2 Every non-constant polynomial with degree n in C[x] is linear or can be
factored as a product of n linear factors. Thus, the irreducibles in C[x] consist exactly of
the linear polynomials.
Proof:
Let f be a polynomial in C[x]. The essence of this proof is to apply the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra to f and its factors, over and over again. We make this precise by means
of an induction argument on n, the degree of f. If n = 1, then the polynomial is itself a linear
polynomial. Now suppose n > 1. By the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, f has a root α.
By the Root Theorem, x−α is a factor of f, and so f = (x−α)g, where deg(g) = n−1. By
the induction hypothesis, g is either linear or a product of linear factors, and thus f itself
is a product of linear factors.
We’ve already observed that linear polynomials are always irreducible. Any polynomial
in C[x] of higher degree can be factored and so is not irreducible.
2
One important observation needs to be made about the Fundamental Theorem of Al-
gebra: It merely asserts the existence of the linear factors. Neither in the statement of
the theorem nor in its (omitted) proof is an eﬀective method provided for actually ﬁnding
them. We will return to this subject in the ﬁnal section of this book, on what is called
Galois Theory.
10.3
Irreducibles in R[x]
We now use the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra to ﬁnd all irreducible polynomials in
R[x]. We have already proved half of the following theorem:
Theorem 10.3 The irreducible polynomials in R[x] are precisely the linear polynomials,
and those quadratic polynomials with negative discriminant.
Proof:
We know already that linear polynomials are irreducible. And in our discussion
of the quadratic formula in Section 10.2 above we have argued already that if a quadratic
polynomial has a negative discriminant, then it is irreducible in R[x]. We now will argue
that linear polynomials and quadratics with negative discriminant are the only irreducibles
in R[x].
Suppose that f is a non-linear irreducible in R[x]. Then f can have no real roots (else
it would have a linear factor, by the Root Theorem). But f has complex roots, by the
Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Let α be a complex root of f. Suppose that α = s + ti,
where s and t are real and t ̸= 0. We now use ¯α = s −ti, the complex conjugate of α. We
deﬁne
g = (x −α)(x −¯α)
=
(x −(s + ti))(x −(s −ti))
=
x2 −2sx + (s2 + t2),

Chapter 10: Polynomials over a Field
113
which is a polynomial in R[x]. We now apply the Division Theorem for R[x]. By this theorem,
f = gq + r, where f, g, q, and r all have real coeﬃcients. Now think of these polynomials
as being in C[x]. So,
0 = f(α) = g(α)q(α) + r(α).
Because g(α) = 0, we have r(α) = 0. But deg(r) < 2 and so r = cx + d with c, d ∈R. But
r(α) = 0; that is, cα + d = 0. But α is not real, and therefore we must have that c = d = 0.
Hence, f = gq, and so f is not irreducible unless q is a scalar. But then f is of degree two
with negative discriminant, which proves what we wanted.
2
10.4
Extraction of Square Roots in C
We now know that we can use the quadratic formula to factor any quadratic polynomial in
R[x], over the complex numbers. But what about quadratic polynomials in C[x]? We know
by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that such polynomials factor and thus must factor
into two linear factors. Surely the quadratic formula should still work. But we must extract
a square root when using the quadratic formula, and if the original quadratic polynomial
belongs to C[x], this means extracting the square root of an arbitrary complex number.
Example 10.5
Consider the quadratic equation
x2 −ix −(1 + i) = 0.
If we proceed with the quadratic formula, we obtain the following:
x = i ± √3 + 4i
2
.
 Quick Exercise.
Check the above computation. 
Unfortunately, we have a complex number under the radical sign. If we are lucky
enough to observe that (2 + i)2 = 3 + 4i, we can then obtain the two roots x = −1 and
x = 1 + i.
 Quick Exercise.
Check our arithmetic, and verify that the given complex num-
bers are roots of the original equation. 
In the previous example we were lucky. But how can we extract square roots of arbitrary
complex numbers? To do this, we make use of the geometric representation for complex
numbers we discussed in Chapter 8.
Suppose that α = a + bi ∈C. We wish to ﬁnd roots to the polynomial x2 −α. From
Chapter 8, we can factor α as
α = |α|(cos θ + i sin θ) = |α|eiθ,
where θ is the argument of α. We wish to ﬁnd a complex number whose square is this. But
because the modulus of a product is the product of the moduli (Theorem 8.3), the modulus
of a square root of α must be
p
|α|. And one argument that will surely work is θ/2. Thus,
β =
4p
a2 + b2(cos(θ/2) + i sin(θ/2))

114
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
is a square root of the complex number α, and of course −β is another. Because the polyno-
mial x2 −α can have at most two roots, these must be the only roots it has; these roots are
distinct unless α = 0. Thus, every non-zero complex number has exactly two square roots.
Example 10.6
Let’s compute the square roots of i. Its modulus is 1, and so its square roots will also
have modulus 1. Its argument is π/2, and so one square root must be
cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4) =

In Exercise 23, you will extend this method to compute the nth roots of an arbitrary complex
number.
You might suppose that we could apply the quadratic formula in any ﬁeld, but we
would then have to be able to take the square root in this more general context, and there
is nothing in the ﬁeld axioms which guarantees we can do this. However, such generalizations
are possible, and you will explore this in the context of Z7 in Exercise 29.
Historical Remarks
Naturally, given a particular polynomial with real coeﬃcients it may be very diﬃcult to
come up with the factorization into irreducibles, particularly if the degree of the polynomial
is large. Of course, the quadratic formula allows us to ﬁnd such a factorization for all
polynomials of degree two, and there exist progressively more complicated cubic and quartic
formulas, which allow us to factor all polynomials of degree 3 and degree 4. (See Exercise 12
for the degree 3 case, and Exercise 20 for degree 4.) However, a diﬃcult theorem due to the
19th-century Norwegian mathematician Abel states that there are polynomials of degree 5

or higher for which no explicit determination of the roots is possible, using the ordinary
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of roots. We will
encounter this theorem in the last chapter in this book.
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra was one of Karl Gauss’s favorites; he returned to
it several times over the course of his career, proving it by diﬀerent means. He had his ﬁrst
proof in hand before his twentieth year. The theorem had been conjectured (and believed) by
such predecessors of Gauss as Lambert and Legendre. One of the most important obstacles
preventing a proof before the time of Gauss was that there still remained doubts in the
minds of most mathematicians as to the status of complex numbers. You may yourself
when ﬁrst encountering complex numbers have doubted they were as ‘real’ as real numbers;
it is precisely this attitude which is reﬂected in the terms ‘real’ and ‘imaginary’. Gauss
was among the ﬁrst mathematicians to use complex numbers with conﬁdence and rigor. He
made full use of the geometric interpretation we have discussed. In part, this reduction of
complex arithmetic to geometry gave some reassurance to those who doubted the possibility
of such calculations. Such doubts (which had been the rule in mathematical circles since
the 16th century) were forgotten in the generation of mathematicians after Gauss.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we discussed how the ring F[x] of polynomials with coeﬃcients from a ﬁeld
F has properties analogous to those of Q[x]. In particular, this means that the Division
Theorem, Euclid’s Algorithm, the GCD Identity, the Unique Factorization Theorem, and
the Root Theorem hold for F[x].
We also considered the important examples C[x] and R[x]. We stated the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra and inferred from it that the irreducible polynomials in R[x] are exactly
the linear polynomials, and the quadratic polynomials with negative discriminant.

Exercises
1. Use the method of completing the square to complete the proof of the quadratic for-
mula for ﬁnding roots of polynomials of degree two in R[x], as begun at the beginning
of Section 10.2.
2.
(a) Why does every non-zero complex number have exactly two square roots?

3. Give examples of two diﬀerent polynomials in Z5[x] that are identical as functions over
Z5. This shows that equality of polynomials in F[x] cannot be thought of as equality
of the corresponding polynomial functions. (See the Quick Exercise in Section 4.1 for
the F = Z2 case, and Exercise 4.12 for the case F = Z3.)
4. Consider the polynomial f = x3 + 3x2 + 2x ∈Z6[x]. Show that this polynomial has
more than three roots in Z6. Why doesn’t this contradict the Root Theorem?
5. Find a gcd of x3 + 4x2 + 4x + 9 and x2 + x −2 in Q[x]; in R[x]; in C[x].
6. Find a gcd of x3 + x2 + x and x2 + x + 1 in Z3[x]; in Z5[x]; in Z11[x].

involved.

are in fact irreducible.
11. Determine all the irreducible elements of Z2[x], with degree less than or equal to 4.
12. In this exercise, we describe the cubic formula for factoring an arbitrary polynomial of
degree 3 in R[x]. This version of the formula is called the Cardano-Tartaglia formula,
after two 16th-century Italian mathematicians involved in its discovery. Consider the
polynomial f = x3+ax2+bx+c ∈R[x] (by dividing by the lead coeﬃcient if necessary,
we have assumed without loss of generality that it is 1).
(a) Show that the change of variables x = y −1
3a changes f into a cubic polynomial
that lacks a square term; that is, a polynomial of the form g = f(y −1
3a) =
y3 + py + q = 0. Note: This process is called depressing the conic. Clearly we can
solve f = 0 for x if and only if we can solve g = 0 for y.

Hint: These equations reduce to a quadratic equation in u3 or v3.
(c) Prove the identity

13. In Exercise 12, there is an apparent ambiguity arising from the plus or minus when
extracting the square root of D to obtain values for u3 and v3. However, show that
we obtain the same value for the root u −v, regardless of which choice is made.
14. Apply the Cardano-Tartaglia formula to ﬁnd a root of the cubic equation
x3 = 6x + 9.
Then factor x3 −6x −9, and use the quadratic formula to obtain the remaining two
roots.
15. Suppose as in Exercise 12 that g = y3 + py + q is a cubic polynomial with real
coeﬃcients, and y = u−v is the root given by the Cardano-Tartaglia formula. Suppose
that D > 0. (Thus u and v are real numbers.) Let ζ = e
2π
3 be a cube root of unity
(called the primitive cube root of unity in Exercise 25 below). Argue that the other
two distinct roots of g = 0 are the complex conjugates uζ −vζ2 and uζ2 −vζ. Note:
Be sure and check both that these are roots and that they are necessarily distinct.
16. Apply Exercise 15 to obtain all three of the roots for the cubic y3 + 3y + 1.
17. An interesting and surprising conclusion one can draw from Exercise 15 is that if the
discriminant D > 0, then the cubic polynomial y3 + py + q ∈R[x] necessarily has
exactly one real root, and a conjugate pair of complex roots. In this exercise you will
use elementary calculus to verify this fact again:
(a) Consider the function g(y) = y3 + py + q. Suppose that p > 0. Compute the
derivative g′(y), and use it to argue that g has exactly one real root, and conse-
quently two complex roots.
(b) Suppose now that p = 0. Then conclude that q ̸= 0. In this simple case, what
are the roots of g?
(c) Now suppose that p < 0. Compute the two roots of g′(y) = 0. Argue that
the values of g at these two roots are both positive (using the assumption that
D > 0). Why does this mean that g has exactly one real root?

19. Exercise 18 is a particular example of what is called the irreducible case for a real cubic.
Show that in case D < 0, we obtain a real root for the polynomial g = y3 + py + q by
an appropriate choice for u and v.
20. In this problem we will explore Ferrari’s approach to solving the general quartic equa-
tion. Consider the arbitrary quartic
f = x4 + a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 ∈R[x].
(a) Find a linear change of variables y = x + m so as to depress the quartic – that
is, to eliminate the cubic term, as we eliminated the quadratic term in Exercise
12.
(b) We may by part (a) assume that our quartic equation is of the form x4 = px2 +
qx + r, where p, q, r ∈R. Add the term 2bx2 + b2 to both sides of this equation.
Clearly this makes the left-hand side of the equation a perfect square. We would
like to choose b so that the right-hand side is also a perfect square. Obtain an
equation for b (in terms of p, q, r) that makes this true. The equation you obtain
should be a cubic equation in b. Explain why a (real) solution to this cubic will
always lead to a solution to the quartic equation. How do you then get all four
solutions?
21. Carry out Ferrari’s method for solving quartic equations, for the equation x4 = −x2 −
4x + 3.
22. Use a calculator and our algorithm to compute (approximations of) the square roots
of 5 + 11.6i in C.
23. Suppose that the complex number α = a + bi has been factored as

(c) Why is this the complete list of nth roots of α?

24. What are the ﬁve complex ﬁfth roots of 1? What are the ﬁve complex ﬁfth roots of
1 + i?
25. We generalize the previous exercise. Let p be a positive prime integer. In this problem
we will describe the pth roots of 1, which are customarily called the pth roots of
unity. If we set
ζ = cos(2π/p) + i sin(2π/p) = e
2πi
p ,
show that each of the following are pth roots of unity:
1, ζ, ζ2, · · · ζp−1.
Be sure to argue that these numbers are all distinct. (We call ζ the primitive pth
root of unity. Note that these numbers (other than 1) are the roots of the cyclotomic
polynomial
Φp = xp −1
x −1 = xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1
ﬁrst encountered in Exercises 4.5 and 5.17.)
26. A ﬁeld F is said to be algebraically closed if every polynomial f ∈F[x] with
deg(f) ≥1 has a root in F; we can rephrase this deﬁnition roughly by saying that a
ﬁeld is algebraically closed if it satisﬁes the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Thus,
C is algebraically closed, while R and Q are not. Show that for every prime p, the
ﬁeld Zp is not algebraically closed.
27. Show that the ﬁeld in Exercise 8.15 is not algebraically closed. (See the previous
exercise for a deﬁnition.)
28. Show that, if F is a ﬁeld with inﬁnitely many elements, then f(x) = g(x) for all x ∈F
implies that f = g as polynomials. (We have already seen that this is not the case if
F is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. For example, consider x2 + x + 1 and 1 in Z2[x].)
29. In this problem we explore the quadratic formula, in the context of the ﬁeld Z7.
(a) By brute force, square all the elements of Z7, and thus discover exactly which
elements in this ﬁeld have a square root. How many square roots does each such
non-zero ﬁeld element have?
(b) Let’s now suppose that we have a quadratic equation x2 + bx + c = 0 in Z7. (We
will assume without lost of generality that the x2 coeﬃcient is 1.) We can rewrite
this as x2 + bx = −c. What element should we add to both sides to make the
left side a perfect square?
(c) Choose values for b, c so that the constant on the right side has a square root in
Z7, thus obtaining two solutions to your quadratic equation.
(d) Choose values for b, c so that the constant on the right side has no square root
in Z7. What does this mean about the original equation?
(e) Choose values for b, c where your quadratic equation has a repeated root.

Section II in a Nutshell
This section deﬁnes three important algebraic structures: rings, integral domains, and ﬁelds.
Well-known objects (Z, Q[x], Zm, Q, R, and C) share many algebraic properties. These
properties deﬁne an abstract object called a ring:
A ring R is a set of elements on which two binary operations, addition (+) and multiplication
(·), are deﬁned that satisfy the following properties for all a, b, c ∈R:
1. (Addition is commutative) a + b = b + a
2. (Addition is associative) (a + b) + c = (a + (b + c)
3. (Additive identity exists) There exists an element 0 in R such that a + 0 = a.
4. (Additive inverses exist) For each element a in R, there exists an element x such that
a + x = 0.
5. (Multiplication is associative) (a · b) · c = a · (b · c)
6. (Multiplication distributes over addition) a·(b+c) = a·b+a·c, (b+c)·a = b·a+c·a
Note that the multiplication in a ring need not be commutative. A ring where multi-
plication is commutative is called a commutative ring, naturally. All the examples of rings
we’ve listed above are commutative rings. An example of a non-commutative ring is M2(Z),
the collection of 2 × 2 matrices with integer entries.
Addition in rings has some useful properties:
(Theorem 6.1) Suppose R is a ring and a, b ∈R.
1. (Additive Cancellation) If a + b = a + c, then b = c.
2. (Solution of equations) The equation a + x = b always has a unique solution in R.
3. (Uniqueness of additive inverses) Every element of R has exactly one additive inverse.
4. (Uniqueness of additive identity) There is only one element of R that satisﬁes the
equations z + a = a, for all a; namely, the element 0.
A subring S of ring R is subset of R that is itself a ring under the operations induced
from R. To determine whether a subset of a ring is a subring, the Subring Theorem asserts
that it is not necessary to verify all the rules that deﬁne a ring:
(Theorem 7.1) A non-empty subset of a ring is a subring under the same operations if and
only if it is closed under multiplication and subtraction.
Some rings R have a unity, or multiplicative identity; that is, an element u ∈R where
au = ua = a for all a ∈R. The number 1 is the unity in Z, Q, R, and C. The scalar
polynomial 1 is the unity in Q[x] and Z[x]. And the matrix

1
0
0
1

is the unity in M2(Z).
The residue class [1] is the unity in Zm. But 2Z has no unity. If the unity exists, it is unique.
An element a ̸= 0 is a zero divisor if there is an element b ̸= 0 with ab = 0. A commu-
tative ring with unity is an integral domain if it has no zero divisors. Z, Q, R, C, Q[x], and
Z[x] are all integral domains. Zn is an integral domain if and only if n is prime. Z × Z is a
commutative ring with unity which is not an integral domain.
Integral domains have the nice property of multiplicative cancellation:
120

(Theorem 8.1) If R is an integral domain and a, b, c ∈R with a ̸= 0, then ab = ac implies
that b = c.
If R is a ring with unity 1, then an element a ∈R is a unit if there exists b ∈R such
that ab = 1. In this case, b is said to be the multiplicative inverse of a. If all the non-zero
elements of a commutative ring with unity are units, then we say the ring is a ﬁeld. The
rings Q, R, and C are all ﬁelds but Z, Q[x], and Z[x] are not ﬁelds. All ﬁelds are integral
domains (Theorem 8.2). Zp is a ﬁeld, for prime p (Theorem 8.5). Indeed, all ﬁnite integral
domains are ﬁelds (Theorem 8.8).
The ﬁeld Zp is the setting for the important Fermat’s Little Theorem:
(Theorem 8.7) If p is prime and 0 < x < p, then xp−1 ≡1(mod p). Thus, xp−2 ≡x−1 in
Zp.
A map ϕ : X →Y between sets X and Y is said to be surjective if it is onto, injective
if it is one-to-one, and bijective if it is both one-to-one and onto. Furthermore if R and
S are both rings, the map ϕ : R →S is a ring isomorphism if it is a bijection where
ϕ(r + s) = ϕ(r) + ϕ(s) and ϕ(rs) = ϕ(r)ϕ(s) for all r, s ∈R. Here we say that ϕ preserves
the ring operations. The existence of such a map tells us that as rings, R and S are essentially
the same.
For a commutative ring R and a ∈R the principal ideal generated by a is ⟨a⟩= {b ∈
R : b = ax, for some x ∈R}.
(Theorem 9.1) Let R be a commutative ring with unity, with r ∈R. Then ⟨r⟩= R if and
only if r is a unit.
To generalize, if R is a commutative ring with unity, an ideal of R is a non-empty set I
of R where (1) I is closed under subtraction, and (2) if a ∈I and r ∈R, then ar ∈I. This
last property says that I absorbs multiplication by any element in R. I is a subring of R.
{0} is the trivial ideal and R is the improper ideal of R. Every non-zero ring has these two
ideals.
Fields have a paucity of ideals:
(Corollary 9.4) A commutative ring with unity is a ﬁeld if and only if its only ideals are the
trivial and improper ideals.
A principal ideal is an ideal and ⟨a⟩is the smallest ideal of R containing a. Not all ideals
are principal. But if all ideals of an integral domain are indeed principal, we call the domain
a principal ideal domain (PID). Important PIDs are Z and Q[x]. Z[x] is not a PID.
Finally, consider F[x], the polynomials over an arbitrary ﬁeld F. F[x] is an integral
domain. The Division Theorem, the Root Theorem, Euclid’s Algorithm, the GCD identity
and Unique Factorization all hold for F[x]. A particularly important example is F = C, the
ﬁeld of complex numbers. C[x] satisﬁes the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 10.1: every
non-constant polynomial in C has a root.

Chapter 11
Ring Homomorphisms
Up to now we have mostly examined the relationship between rings by looking at properties
they might have in common. But some pairs of rings can actually be placed into a rather
closer relationship by means of a function between them. The most important example of
this idea is the relationship between Z and Zn, as given by the residue function ϕ : Z →Zn
deﬁned by ϕ(m) = [m]n. Another example is the evaluation function ψ : Q[x] →Q deﬁned
by ψ(f) = f(a) (where a is some ﬁxed rational number). A third more general example is
the idea of ring isomorphism we introduced in Chapter 7: A bijection between two rings
that preserves addition and multiplication. Exploring the general context of these examples
will then give us a new tool with which to study rings.
11.1
Homomorphisms
Now consider the functions ϕ and ψ deﬁned above. They certainly have rings as their ranges
and domains; however, they also carry signiﬁcant parts of the structure of the domain ring
over to the range ring. We make this precise in the following deﬁnition: Let R and S be
rings and ϕ : R →S a function such that
ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)
and
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b),
for all a, b ∈R. We call this a ring homomorphism. Speaking more colloquially, we say
that ϕ preserves addition and ϕ preserves multiplication.
Later in the book we will consider homomorphisms between other algebraic structures
than rings and will then have to be careful to refer to ring homomorphisms, as opposed
to others we might discuss; but for now the term homomorphism will suﬃce. The word
homomorphism comes from Greek roots meaning ‘same shape’. We shall see as we explore
this concept how appropriate this term is.
Notice that the examples of ring isomorphisms we encountered in Chapters 7 and 8
are of course ring homomorphisms too. Any bijective ring homomorphism is called a ring
isomorphism. The preﬁx ‘iso’ means equal, and thus indicates a closer relationship between
the two rings.
It is time now to look at some examples of ring homomorphisms. We will begin with
speciﬁc examples of the functions with which we started the chapter.
Example 11.1
Consider the residue function ϕ : Z →Z4 deﬁned by ϕ(m) = [m]4. Thus, for example,
125

126
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
ϕ(7) = [3]. Is this function a homomorphism? That is, does it preserve addition and
multiplication? Let’s check addition:
ϕ(a + b) = [a + b] = [a] + [b] = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b).
The crucial step here is the second equal sign; it holds because of the way we deﬁned
addition in Z4, back in Chapter 3. The proof for multiplication works just the same.
We can view the homomorphism ϕ as a somewhat more abstract and precise way of
conveying the fact that we already know: The operations on Z4 are related to those on
Z. It is obvious that the function takes on all values in the range Z4: It is onto. But
diﬀerent integers are taken to the same element of Z4: It is not one-to-one. To rephrase:
The residue function is a surjection but not an injection. Notice of course that there’s
nothing special about 4: The residue function is a surjective homomorphism, for any
modulus.
Example 11.2
Consider the evaluation function ϕ : Q[x] →Q deﬁned by ϕ(f) = f(2): evaluation of
polynomials at 2. For example, if f = x2 −3x + 1, then ϕ(f) = 4 −6 + 1 = −1. This
is also a homomorphism:
ϕ(f + g) = (f + g)(2) = f(2) + g(2) = ϕ(f) + ϕ(g).
Once again, the crucial step is the second equal sign. It holds because of the way we
deﬁned the addition of polynomials in Chapter 4. The proof for multiplication is just
the same. It is easy to see that this homomorphism is surjective: To get any rational
number q, just evaluate the constant polynomial with value q at 2. Notice of course
that there’s nothing special about 2: The evaluation function is a surjective homo-
morphism, for any element of Q. Even more generally, we could deﬁne an evaluation
homomorphism for any ring of polynomials R[x], where R is a commutative ring, and
we evaluate at any ﬁxed r ∈R.
Example 11.3
Consider the function π : Z × Z →Z deﬁned by π(a, b) = a. It is easy to see that this
is a homomorphism. For example, it preserves multiplication because
π((a, b) · (c, d)) = π(ac, bd) = ac = π(a, b) · π(c, d).
This function is called a projection homomorphism (we are projecting on the ﬁrst
component of the ordered pair); it is clearly surjective. See the diagram below.
•
•
(a, b)
a = π(a, b)

Chapter 11: Ring Homomorphisms
127
Example 11.4
Consider instead the function ι : Z →Z × Z deﬁned by ι(a) = (a, a). It is easy to see
that this is a homomorphism. For example, it preserves addition because
ι(a + b) = (a + b, a + b) = (a, a) + (b, b) = ι(a) + ι(b).
This function is injective but not surjective. Note however that we can restrict the
range of this function to the subring D = {(a, a) ∈Z×Z : a ∈Z}, and then ι : Z →D
is a bijection, and an example of a ring isomorphism. This example is essentially
the content of Exercise 7.8b. We will discuss the restriction of the range of a ring
homomorphism in general in Section 11.4 below.
Example 11.5
Consider the function ϕ : C →C deﬁned by ϕ(α) = ¯α, which takes a complex number
to its complex conjugate. For example, ϕ(3 −i) = 3 + i. This preserves addition:
ϕ((a + bi) + (c + di))
=
ϕ((a + c) + (b + d)i) =
(a + c) −(b + d)i
=
(a −bi) + (c −di) =
ϕ(a + bi) + ϕ(c + di).
It also preserves multiplication:
ϕ((a + bi)(c + di))
=
ϕ((ac −bd) + (ad + bc)i) =
(ac −bd) −(ad + bc)i
=
(a −bi)(c −di) =
ϕ(a + bi)ϕ(c + di).
This function is both one-to-one and onto; it is a bijection.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify these assertions. 
The conjugation function is thus a ring isomorphism, from the ring C onto itself.
Of course, we can deﬁne many functions whose ranges and domains are rings that are
not homomorphisms; here is one example:
Example 11.6
Consider the function ρ : Z →Z deﬁned by ρ(n) = 3n; this function merely multiplies
by 3. Note that ρ(nm) = 3nm, while ρ(n)ρ(m) = 9nm, and so this function certainly
does not preserve multiplication; it is consequently not a ring homomorphism.
 Quick Exercise.
Does this function preserve addition? Is it surjective? Is it
injective? 
11.2
Properties Preserved by Homomorphisms
Although we have in our deﬁnition required only that a homomorphism preserve the ring
operations addition and multiplication, a homomorphism actually preserves much more of
the ring structure. We catalog such properties of a homomorphism in the following theorem;
at the end of Chapter 7 (and Exercise 8.7) we foreshadowed this theorem, in the case of
ring isomorphisms.

128
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Theorem 11.1 Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism between the rings R and S. Let 0R and
0S be the additive identities of R and S, respectively.
a. ϕ(0R) = 0S.
b. ϕ(−a) = −ϕ(a), and so ϕ(a −b) = ϕ(a) −ϕ(b).
c. If R has unity 1R and ϕ is onto S, and S is not the zero ring, then ϕ(1R) is unity for
S.
d. If a is a unit of R and ϕ is onto S, and S is not the zero ring, then ϕ(a) is a unit of
S. In this case, ϕ(a)−1 = ϕ(a−1).
In other words, a homomorphism always preserves the zero of the ring and the additive
inverses. Furthermore, a homomorphism preserves unity and units if the homomorphism
is onto. This theorem thus asserts that the assumption that a function preserve addition
and multiplication is enough to conclude that it preserve other additive and multiplicative
structures. Note that a ring always has an additive identity and additive inverses, and so
(a) and (b) are phrased to reﬂect that fact. On the other hand, a ring need not have unity
or units, and so (c) and (d) are phrased rather diﬀerently.
Proof:
(a): Now ϕ(0R) + ϕ(0R) = ϕ(0R + 0R) = ϕ(0R). By subtracting ϕ(0R) from both
sides, we obtain ϕ(0R) = 0S.
(b): We have ϕ(−a) + ϕ(a) = ϕ(−a + a) = ϕ(0R) = 0S; thus by the deﬁnition and
uniqueness of −ϕ(a), we have that ϕ(−a) = −ϕ(a). But then
ϕ(a −b) = ϕ(a + (−b)) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(−b) = ϕ(a) −ϕ(b),
as claimed.
(c): If S is the zero ring, we have previously decreed that we won’t call its unique element
0 unity; we’ve excluded this case in our hypothesis. Let s be any element of S; then there
exists r ∈R with ϕ(r) = s, because ϕ is onto. Then
sϕ(1R) = ϕ(r)ϕ(1R) = ϕ(r · 1R) = ϕ(r) = s,
and so ϕ(1R) must be the unity of S.
(d): Suppose that aa−1 = 1R. Then
ϕ(a)ϕ(a−1) = ϕ(aa−1) = ϕ(1R) = 1S,
and so ϕ(a) is a unit of S with inverse ϕ(a−1).

More Examples
We now look at some further examples of homomorphisms, which will illustrate applications
and limitations of Theorem 11.1. In each case you should check that the example given does
preserve multiplication and addition. The ﬁrst three examples seem rather trivial but are
important.

Chapter 11: Ring Homomorphisms
129
Example 11.7
Let R be a ring with unity 1, and S another ring. Deﬁne ζ : R →S by ζ(r) = 0,
for all r ∈R (this is called the zero homomorphism). If S has unity, note that
ζ(1) = 0 ̸= 1, and in this case the function is not onto, and so (c) of Theorem 11.1
does not apply. Notice that this homomorphism is (notoriously) not injective.
Example 11.8
Let R be a ring and deﬁne ι : R →R by ι(r) = r (this is called the identity homo-
morphism). It of course preserves all structure of the ring R; it is a ring isomorphism.
Example 11.9
Let R be a subring of the ring S. Consider the function ι : R →S deﬁned by ι(r) = r
(this is called the inclusion homomorphism). It is always injective, but not onto if
R ⊂S.
Example 11.10
Consider the rings Z4 and Z2 × Z2; they both have 4 elements, and so there exists a
bijection between them, just as sets. Is there any such function that preserves addition
and multiplication? We claim something stronger: There isn’t even an injection that
preserves addition. If there were, 0 would have to go to (0, 0). (See Theorem 11.1a.)
There are then three possibilities for where 1 might be mapped: (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1). But
if the correspondence preserves addition, then the images of
2 = 1 + 1 and 3 = 1 + 1 + 1
under the correspondence are forced by choice of the image of 1. It is easy to see that
none of the three choices listed above allow a one-to-one function.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that each of the three choices above yields a function
that is not one-to-one. 
To summarize: Z4 and Z2 × Z2 are two rings with 4 elements, but they are not
isomorphic as rings. Furthermore, if we consider Exercise 8.15 we have yet another
ring with 4 elements which is not isomorphic to the other two. This is clear, because
the ring in that example is a ﬁeld.
Example 11.11
Reconsider the residue map ϕ : Z →Z4. Notice that although 2 is not a zero divisor
in Z, ϕ(2) is a zero divisor in Z4 because [2][2] = [4] = [0]. Another thing to notice
about this function is that although the domain is inﬁnite, the range is ﬁnite; although
surjective, it is not injective.
Example 11.12
Consider the rings Q and Q×Q (recall from Example 6.10 how the direct product Q×Q
is made into a ring). Deﬁne the function ϕ : Q →Q × Q by setting ϕ(r) = (r, 0). This
homomorphism is one-to-one, but not onto. Now 3 is a unit in Q because 3 · 1
3 = 1.
But the unity of Q × Q is (1, 1), and so ϕ(3) = (3, 0) cannot be a unit in Q × Q,
because there is no (z, w) such that (3, 0)(z, w) = (1, 1). In fact, ϕ(3) (and ϕ(1)) are
zero divisors.

Example 11.13
Reconsider the evaluation map ϕ : Q[x] →Q given by ϕ(f) = f(2), which we discussed
in Example 11.2. This homomorphism is surjective but not injective. Notice that the
polynomial x in Q[x] is not a unit, but ϕ(x) = 2 is a unit in Q.
Example 11.14
Let C[0, 1] be the ring of continuous real-valued functions with domains [0, 1] (we
discussed this ring in Example 6.14). Consider the evaluation map ψ : C[0, 1] →R
deﬁned by ψ(f) = f( 1
4). Deﬁne the elements f, g of C[0, 1] like this:
f(x) =

2 ≤x ≤1
and

2
x −1
2,
if 1
2 ≤x ≤1.
(The graphs of f and g are shown below.) Then fg = 0, and so f is a zero divisor.
However, ψ(f) = 1
4, which is a unit of R.

11.4
Making a Homomorphism Surjective
Sometimes we wish to modify a homomorphism so that it becomes onto. Given homomor-
phism ϕ : R →S, if we restrict the range to the set ϕ(R), the new function ϕ : R →ϕ(R)
(which we still call ϕ) is obviously surjective. But is it still a homomorphism? Because we
have not aﬀected preservation of addition and multiplication by restricting the range, this
new function must still be a homomorphism, if ϕ(R) is a ring. But this is always the case,
as we prove next:
Theorem 11.2 Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism between rings R and S. Then ϕ(R) is
a subring of S.
Proof:
We need only check that the set ϕ(R) is closed under subtraction and multiplica-
tion; then we’ll know by the Subring Theorem 7.1 that it is a subring of S. For this purpose,
choose x, y ∈ϕ(R); there exist a, b ∈R such that ϕ(a) = x and ϕ(b) = y. Then
x −y = ϕ(a) −ϕ(b) = ϕ(a −b) ∈ϕ(R),
and similarly, xy = ϕ(ab) ∈ϕ(R).

Historical Remarks
The functional point of view is a very powerful one in all branches of mathematics. Analysts
and topologists generally restrict themselves to continuous functions, because these are the
functions that preserve analytic or topological structure. Similarly, in algebra we generally
restrict ourselves to homomorphisms, because they are the functions that preserve algebraic
structure.
The great 19th-century German mathematician Felix Klein was the ﬁrst to use the word
homomorphism in the context of a function preserving algebraic structure. He was actually
talking about groups rather than rings; a group is a set endowed with algebraic structure
that we will meet in Chapter 19.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the idea of ring homomorphism, a function between two rings
which preserves algebraic structure. We looked at numerous examples of such functions.

Chapter 12
The Kernel
Let’s consider the residue homomorphism ϕ : Z →Z4. There are exactly four residue classes
modulo 4; namely,
{· · · , −4, 0, 4, 8, · · ·},
{· · · , −3, 1, 5, 9, · · ·},
{· · · , −2, 2, 6, 10, · · ·}, and
{· · · , −1, 3, 7, 11, · · ·}.
How do they relate to the function ϕ? The answer to this question is reasonably obvious:
They consist of the four pre-images of the elements of Z4. Namely, the residue classes
consist of the four sets
ϕ−1([0]) = {n ∈Z : ϕ(n) = [0]},
ϕ−1([1]), ϕ−1([2]), and ϕ−1([3]).
Furthermore, these sets are rather nicely related: ϕ−1([0]) = ⟨4⟩, the set of multiples of
4 (and principal ideal generated by 4), and the other three can be obtained from ⟨4⟩by
adding a ﬁxed element to every element of ⟨4⟩;
ϕ−1([1])
=
{a + 1 : a ∈⟨4⟩},
ϕ−1([2])
=
{a + 2 : a ∈⟨4⟩}, and
ϕ−1([3])
=
{a + 3 : a ∈⟨4⟩}.
We say that we have obtained ϕ−1([1]), ϕ−1([2]), and ϕ−1([3]) by additively trans-
lating ⟨4⟩by 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The Kernel
We’d like to generalize this situation as far as possible to arbitrary rings. This leads us to
the following deﬁnition: Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism between the rings R and S.
The kernel of ϕ is
ϕ−1(0) = {r ∈R : ϕ(r) = 0};
we will denote this set by ker(ϕ). In other words, the kernel is the pre-image of 0.
135

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Thus, the kernel of the residue homomorphism above is exactly ⟨4⟩. Notice that the
kernel always contains the additive identity of R (because homomorphisms take zero to
zero). But as the example above shows, the kernel can include a great many other elements
as well.
Let’s go back to some of the examples from the previous chapter and compute their
kernels.
Example 12.1
(From Example 11.2) This is the homomorphism that evaluates each rational polyno-
mial at 2, and so its kernel is the set of all polynomials f such that f(2) = 0. By the
Root Theorem, this is the set of all polynomials of the form (x −2)g, where g is some
arbitrary element of Q[x]. Note that this set is precisely ⟨x −2⟩.
Example 12.2
(From Example 11.3.) This is the projection homomorphism onto the ﬁrst component,
from Z × Z to Z. When is π(a, b) = 0? The answer is precisely when a = 0; thus,
ker(π) = {(0, b) : b ∈Z}.
Note that this is ⟨(0, 1)⟩.
Example 12.3
(From Example 11.5.) This is the homomorphism ϕ taking each complex number to
its conjugate. Thus, a + bi = α ∈ker(ϕ) exactly if a −bi = ¯α = 0. But this means that
both a and b are zero, and so α = 0. Thus,
ker(ϕ) = {0} = ⟨0⟩.
Example 12.4
(From Example 11.7.) This is the zero homomorphism ζ : R →S, and its kernel is
quite evidently the entire ring R.
Example 12.5
(From Example 11.14.) This is the homomorphism ψ : C[0, 1] →R that sends a
continuous function to its value at 1/4. Here,
ker(ψ) = {f ∈C[0, 1] : f(1/4) = 0}.
There is no nice elementwise description of this set, which includes inﬁnitely many
functions, including for example sin

12.2
The Kernel Is an Ideal
Note that every kernel from the above examples is an ideal: A subring that has the mul-
tiplicative absorption property. In the case of Example 12.4, this is evident because the
kernel is the entire ring. In the case of Examples 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3, the kernel is actually
a principal ideal.
For Example 12.5, let’s check explicitly that
ker(ψ) = {f ∈C[0, 1] : f(1/4) = 0}
is an ideal. We ﬁrst see that it is a non-empty set, by noting that the zero function is in
ker(ψ). It is easy to check that ker(ψ) is closed under subtraction.
 Quick
Exercise.
Show
that
the
kernel

This kernel also has the absorption property: If f is in ker(ψ) and g is any function in
C[0, 1], then
(fg)(1/4) = f(1/4) · g(1/4) = 0 · g(1/4) = 0.
In other words, fg is also in ker(ψ).
With the examples above before us, you may be ready to believe the following theorem:
Theorem 12.1 Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism between the commutative rings R and
S. Then ker(ϕ) is an ideal of R.
Proof:
To show that ker(ϕ) is an ideal, we must ﬁrst check that it is a non-empty set.
But evidently, the zero element of R belongs to the kernel. We next check that the kernel is
closed under subtraction. So suppose a and b are elements of the kernel. We need to check
that a −b ∈ker(ϕ). But ϕ(a −b) = ϕ(a) −ϕ(b) = 0 −0 = 0. That is, a −b ∈ker(ϕ), as
required. Similarly, if r ∈R, then ϕ(ar) = ϕ(a)ϕ(r) = 0ϕ(r) = 0, and so ar ∈ker(ϕ).
2
12.3
All Pre-images Can Be Obtained from the Kernel
The residue homomorphism example suggests that we can capture all pre-images by addi-
tively translating the kernel. Let’s look at the pre-images of Example 12.1, the evaluation
map
ϕ : Q[x] →Q
deﬁned by ϕ(f) = f(2). This is more complicated than the residue homomorphism example
because the range Q is inﬁnite, and so there are inﬁnitely many pre-images. Recall that the
kernel of ϕ is ⟨x −2⟩. We wish to show that it is also the case in this example that each
pre-image can be obtained by additively translating the kernel. That is, we claim that each
pre-image can be written as
⟨x −2⟩+ g = {f ∈Q[x] : f = h + g where h ∈⟨x −2⟩},
for some choice of g. To show this, choose a ∈Q and consider g ∈ϕ−1(a). This means that
ϕ(g) = g(2) = a. We claim that every f in ϕ−1(a) can be written in the form f = h + g

138
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
where h ∈⟨x −2⟩. This would show that ϕ−1(a) = ⟨x −2⟩+ g. Now because f(2) = a, and
g(2) = a, we have that (f −g)(2) = 0. That is, f −g ∈ker(ϕ). But ker(ϕ) = ⟨x −2⟩, so
f −g = h, where h is some multiple of x −2. But then f = h + g, as we wish.
Note that the g we picked to represent ϕ−1(a) was chosen arbitrarily from all the ele-
ments of ϕ−1(a). Another element in ϕ−1(a) would have served just as well. The form of
the translation would be diﬀerent but would give the same set. In other words, if g1 and g2
are both in ϕ−1(a), then
ϕ−1(a) = ⟨x −2⟩+ g1 = ⟨x −2⟩+ g2.
This is analogous to our freedom of choice in representing residue classes in Zm: for instance,
[4]6 = [10]6 = [16]6; or, to express this using the notation of ideals,
⟨6⟩+ 4 = ⟨6⟩+ 10 = ⟨6⟩+ 16.
It turns out that we can always capture all the pre-images of a ring homomorphism
by additively translating the kernel. To state this formally, we need a deﬁnition. Let I be
an ideal of the ring R. Given r ∈R, the coset of I determined by r consists of the set
{a + r : a ∈I}, which we write as I + r. Thus, ⟨4⟩+ 3 is a coset of the ideal ⟨4⟩in Z.
 Quick Exercise.
Consider the function ϕ in Example 12.1; describe the coset ker(ϕ)+
5. What values do the polynomials in this set take on at 2? 
Theorem 12.2 Let ϕ : R →S be a homomorphism between the rings R and S, and
s ∈ϕ(R). Then ϕ−1(s) equals the coset ker(ϕ) + r, where r is any given element of ϕ−1(s).
Proof:
Let s ∈ϕ(R), and choose any r ∈ϕ−1(s) (which is non-empty by assumption).
We must show that the sets ker(ϕ) + r and ϕ−1(s) are equal. Choose an arbitrary element
a + r ∈ker(ϕ) + r, where a ∈ker(ϕ). Then ϕ(a + r) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(r) = 0 + ϕ(r) = s. Thus,
a + r ∈ϕ−1(s), as claimed.
Conversely, choose t ∈ϕ−1(s). Then consider t −r;
ϕ(t −r) = ϕ(t) −ϕ(r) = s −s = 0,
and so t −r ∈ker(ϕ). But then t = (t −r) + r ∈ker(ϕ) + r, as required.
2
Now because pre-images of distinct elements are clearly disjoint from one another, we
have that the set of cosets of the kernel decomposes the domain ring into a set of pairwise
disjoint subsets. That is, the set of cosets of the kernel partitions the ring. The unique one
of these sets containing 0 is an ideal (because an ideal has to contain 0, it is clear that only
one of the cosets can be an ideal). Notice that we can (and will) think of the ideal itself as
a coset, namely, as ker(ϕ) + 0.
Example 12.6
Let’s explicitly compute this decomposition for the function ϕ : Z12 →Z4 deﬁned by
ϕ([a]12) = [a]4.

The kernel of ϕ is
ϕ−1(0) = {0, 4, 8} = ⟨4⟩= ⟨4⟩+ 0 = ⟨4⟩+ 4 = ⟨4⟩+ 8,
(where we have omitted the square brackets for simplicity’s sake). The other distinct
cosets of ⟨4⟩are
ϕ−1(1)
=
{1, 5, 9} = ⟨4⟩+ 1 = ⟨4⟩+ 5 = ⟨4⟩+ 9,
ϕ−1(2)

Notice that in Example 12.6, each of the cosets has exactly the same number of elements.
This is true in general because there is a bijection between any pair of cosets of an ideal:
Given two cosets I + a and I + b, the function α : I + a →I + b deﬁned by α(x) = x −a + b
is a bijection.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this; that is, show that α is both one-to-one and onto. 
It is important to make clear that the function α is not a homomorphism; it does not
preserve the operations, and the domain and range (except in the special case of the coset I)
are not even rings. Two sets have the same number of elements exactly if there is a one-to-
one correspondence between them; this is the situation in our example above. (Although we
will not inquire into this here, this bijection is even useful if the ideal (and hence its cosets)
is an inﬁnite set, because it turns out that not all inﬁnite sets can be put into one-to-one
correspondence with one another; some are ‘bigger’ than others.)
We record our result formally:
Theorem 12.3 Let I be an ideal of the commutative ring R, and let I + a and I + b be
any two cosets of I. Then there is a bijection between the elements of I + a and I + b. In
particular, if these sets are ﬁnite, they have the same number of elements.
12.4
When Is the Kernel Trivial?
An important special case to consider of this bijection is when the kernel consists of only
a single element; namely, when the ideal is {0} (because an ideal is a subring this is the
only possible one element ideal). Thus, every coset consists of a single element. Because
the cosets consist of the pre-images of elements from the range ring, this means that a
homomorphism with kernel {0} is necessarily one-to-one. To rephrase: If a homomorphism
takes only zero to zero, then there is only a single element that it takes to any of its values
– the homomorphism is injective. We state this formally as a corollary:
Corollary 12.4 A ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is {0}.
12.5
A Summary and Example
We have thus concluded that each homomorphism gives rise to an ideal, and this ideal in
essence determines the pre-images of elements from the range of the function. We thus know
(from just knowing the kernel) which elements in the ring are sent by the homomorphism
to the same elements.
For example, consider the ring Z × Z and the ideal I = {(x, 0) : x ∈Z}.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is an ideal. 
Suppose we are told that this is the kernel of some homomorphism. Then we know that
all elements in the coset
I + (3, 4) = I + (−5, 4) = {(x, 4) : x ∈Z}

140
Exercises
must be sent by the homomorphism to the same element in the range ring (whatever that
might be). Can you in fact think of a homomorphism with domain Z × Z of which I is the
kernel? (If not, rest assured that in Example 14.3 we will return to this example.)
This all suggests that knowing the kernel of a homomorphism in essence gives us the
homomorphism. This is precisely the content of the next chapter, where we will prove that
every ideal of a ring is the kernel of some homomorphism. That is, we will prove the converse
of Theorem 12.1, which asserts that the kernel of a homomorphism is always an ideal.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the notion of the kernel of a ring homomorphism and proved
that the kernel is always an ideal. Furthermore, the pre-images of a ring homomorphism are
exactly the cosets of the kernel.

Chapter 13
Rings of Cosets
In practice when we think of the ring Z4 we think of the four elements [0], [1], [2], [3] (or even
0, 1, 2, 3) together with the appropriate operations. But technically, when we ﬁrst considered
Z4 and its operations in Chapter 3, we deﬁned those elements as inﬁnite sets of integers;
that is,
[a] = {a + 4m : m ∈Z} = {n ∈Z : 4|(a −n)}.
We then deﬁned addition and multiplication by setting
[a] + [b] = [a + b]
and
[a][b] = [ab].
While these deﬁnitions look innocuous enough, what we ﬁrst had to do was to check that
they make sense (or are well deﬁned): If [c] = [a] and [d] = [b], do [c + d] = [a + b] and
[cd] = [ab]? We now wish to follow the same line of thought for the cosets of an arbitrary
ideal of a commutative ring.
13.1
The Ring of Cosets
We ﬁrst need some notation. Let R be a commutative ring with ideal I. Then we denote the
set {I + r : r ∈R} of all cosets of I in R by R/I; we read this as ‘R modulo I’. Note that
by deﬁning R/I in this way, it looks as if R/I has as many elements as R does. But this is
certainly not the case, for diﬀerent elements of R may well give rise to the same coset.
For example, we saw in Section 12.3 that we can write
Z/⟨4⟩= {⟨4⟩+ n : n ∈Z} = {⟨4⟩+ 0, ⟨4⟩+ 1, ⟨4⟩+ 2, ⟨4⟩+ 3}.
Another example we discussed in the previous chapter is this:
Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩= {⟨x −2⟩+ f : f ∈Q[x]} = {⟨x −2⟩+ q : q ∈Q}.
What we are going to do now is deﬁne an addition and multiplication on R/I in such a
way as to make it a commutative ring. We do this so that Z/⟨4⟩becomes a ring essentially
the same as Z4, and Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩becomes a ring essentially the same as Q.
Given a commutative ring R with ideal I, we deﬁne
(I + a) + (I + r) = I + (a + r)
and
(I + a)(I + r) = I + ar.
We must now check that these deﬁnitions make sense. As when checking that addition
and multiplication are well deﬁned on Zm, we must show these deﬁnitions for addition and
multiplication on cosets of I are well deﬁned by showing that diﬀerent representations of
the cosets yield the same sum (and product). That is, suppose that I + a = I + c and
I + r = I + s: Is
(I + a) + (I + r) = (I + b) + (I + s)?
143

144
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Is
(I + a)(I + r) = (I + b)(I + s)?
What does such an assumption as I + a = I + b mean? In other words: When do two
elements determine the same coset of I? This is important enough to characterize in the
following theorem. But before stating the theorem, think again about the example Z/⟨4⟩.
When do two integers a and b determine the same coset (or in this case, residue class modulo
4)? The answer is exactly if their diﬀerence a−b belongs to the ideal ⟨4⟩. This is the answer
in general; we shall prove this now, along with some other important observations about
cosets, in the Coset Theorem.
Theorem 13.1
The Coset Theorem
Let I be an ideal of the commutative ring R
with a, b ∈R.
a. If I + a ⊆I + b, then I + a = I + b.
b. If I + a ∩I + b ̸= ∅, then I + a = I + b.
c. I + a = I + b if and only if a −b ∈I.
d. There exists a bijection between any two cosets I + a and I + b. Thus, if I has ﬁnitely
many elements, every coset has that same number of elements.
Notice that if you have done Exercise 12.12, you have already checked that parts (a)
and (b) are true.
Proof:
(a) Suppose that I is an ideal of the commutative ring R, and a and b are
elements of the ring for which I + a ⊆I + b. Then
a = 0 + a ∈I + a ⊆I + b,
and so there exists x ∈I such that a = x + b. But then b = −x + a ∈I + a. Now, if k ∈I,
k + b = (k −x) + a ∈I + a, and so I + b ⊆I + a. That is, I + a = I + b.
(b): Suppose that I + a ∩I + b ̸= ∅. Choose c in this intersection. Then c ∈I + a, and
so I + c ⊆I + a. But then by part (a), I + c = I + a. But similarly, I + c = I + b, and so
I + a = I + b.
(c): If I + a = I + b, then a = 0 + a ∈I + a = I + b, and so there exists k ∈I such
that a = k + b. But then a −b = k ∈I, as required. Conversely, suppose if a −b ∈I, then
a = (a −b) + b ∈I + b. But then a ∈I + a ∩I + b, and so by part (b), I + a = I + b.
(d): In the Quick Exercise following Example 12.6, you argued that the function α :
I + a →I + b deﬁned by α(x) = x −a + b is bijective.
2
We now use the Coset Theorem 13.1, as promised, to show that the addition and mul-
tiplication we have deﬁned above on R/I are well deﬁned:
Proof that Operations are Well Deﬁned:
We can now return to the task of checking
that the above deﬁnitions of addition and multiplication for R/I make sense. Suppose that
I +a = I +b and I +r = I +s; we claim ﬁrst that I +(a+r) = I +(b+s). But this amounts
to claiming that (a + r) −(b + s) ∈I, and because (a + r) −(b + s) = (a −b) + (r −s), this
is clear. We claim next that I + ar = I + bs, or in other words, that ar −bs ∈I. But
ar −bs = ar −br + br −bs = (a −b)r + b(r −s).
Because I has the multiplicative absorption property, (a −b)r ∈I and b(r −s) ∈I, and so
therefore ar −bs ∈I.
2
Notice that in order to show that multiplication makes sense for cosets, we needed the full

Chapter 13: Rings of Cosets
145
strength of the deﬁnition of ideal. You will see by example in Exercise 9, that multiplication
of cosets does not make sense if I is merely a subring.
Now that we have the appropriate operations deﬁned on R/I, the rest of the following
theorem is easy:
Theorem 13.2 Let I be an ideal of the commutative ring R. Then the set R/I of cosets
of I in R, under the operations deﬁned above, is a commutative ring.
Proof:
We know from above that the addition and multiplication deﬁned on R/I are in
fact binary operations. They are associative and commutative because the corresponding
operations on R are:
(I + a)((I + b)(I + c))
=
(I + a)(I + bc) = I + a(bc)
=
I + (ab)c = ((I + a)(I + b))(I + c),
and similarly for addition. In a similar fashion the distributive law for R/I carries over from
the distributive law for R. You should check that the additive identity for R/I is I + 0, and
the additive inverse of I + a is I + (−a).

The ring R/I is called the ring of cosets, or the quotient ring of R modulo I.

the ideal
⟨4⟩= {0, 4, 8}.
This ideal has 4 distinct cosets:
Z12/⟨4⟩= {⟨4⟩, ⟨4⟩+ 1, ⟨4⟩+ 2, ⟨4⟩+ 3}.
 Quick Exercise.

Z12/⟨4⟩, and thus check quite explicitly that this is a ring. 
13.2
The Natural Homomorphism
Suppose that R is a commutative ring with ideal I. Consider the function ν : R →R/I
deﬁned by
ν(a) = I + a.
Because of the deﬁnition of the operations on R/I, it is obvious that this function pre-
serves them both. Thus, ν is a homomorphism from R onto R/I. We call it the natural
homomorphism from R onto R/I.
Our experience in the previous chapter suggests the following question: What is the
kernel of the natural homomorphism? If ν(a) = I + 0 (the additive identity of R/I), then
I + a = I + 0. But by the Coset Theorem 13.1, this is true exactly if a = a −0 ∈I. Thus,
the kernel of the natural homomorphism from R to R/I is exactly I. This is very easy but
is important enough to record as a theorem:

146
Exercises
Theorem 13.3 Let R be a commutative ring with ideal I, and ν : R →R/I the natural
homomorphism. Then ker(ν) = I.
In the last chapter we saw that every kernel of a homomorphism is an ideal. In this
chapter we have seen that every ideal is the kernel of some homomorphism, namely, the
natural homomorphism from R to R/I. We have thus obtained a completely diﬀerent way
of thinking about ideals: Ideals are kernels of homomorphisms. This is the sort of surprise
that mathematicians particularly enjoy: Two apparently quite diﬀerent ideas (in this case,
homomorphisms and ideals) turn out to be inextricably linked! But to really say that the
ideas of homomorphisms and ideals amount to the same thing, we need a bit more. To see
this, let’s look again at an example.
Consider again the evaluation homomorphism ψ : Q[x] →Q where ψ(f) = f(2). We
know that ψ(Q[x]) = Q. Now ψ has kernel ⟨x−2⟩, which is an ideal. In this chapter we have
constructed a ring and a homomorphism of which the ideal ⟨x−2⟩is the kernel; namely, we
have the ring of cosets Q[x]/⟨x−2⟩and the natural homomorphism ν : Q[x] →Q[x]/⟨x−2⟩.
The two functions ψ and ν are certainly diﬀerent; the range of one is the set of rational
numbers, while the range of the other is a certain set of subsets of Q[x]. However, in structure
these two ranges (and the functions ψ and ν which connect them to the domain Q[x]) seem
essentially the same. The ring of cosets Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩appears to be just our old friend the
rationals, in disguised garb. Our goal in the next chapter is to show that this is no accident.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we saw how to make a ring out of the set of cosets of an ideal in a commutative
ring, generalizing the construction of Zn in Chapter 3.

Chapter 14
The Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
In this chapter we bring together the ideas of the last two chapters, by showing that the
range of a surjective ring homomorphism is always isomorphic to the ring of cosets formed
from the kernel of the homomorphism. This says informally that homomorphisms and ideals
convey essentially the same information.
14.1
An Illustrative Example
We return to Example 11.2, the homomorphism from Q[x] to Q which evaluates any polyno-
mial at 2. This is a surjection: The result of applying the function to all polynomials is the
set of all rational numbers. But we claim that if we form the ring Q[x]/ ker(ϕ) = Q[x]/⟨x−2⟩,
we also get the rational numbers. To show this, consider the function
λ : Q →Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩
deﬁned by λ(r) = ⟨x −2⟩+ r. We claim this is a ring isomorphism. Because of the way
addition and multiplication are deﬁned on the ring of cosets, this function clearly preserves
them.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that the function λ preserves addition and multiplication. 
We next claim that λ is injective. To do this, we show that its kernel is {0}. For that
purpose, suppose that r ∈Q and λ(r) = 0; we must show that r = 0. But ⟨x −2⟩+ r =
⟨x −2⟩+ 0 means that r ∈⟨x −2⟩; that is, the rational number r is a multiple of the
polynomial x −2. But deg(r) < deg(x −2) forces us to conclude that r = 0.
Finally, we claim that this function is onto. Suppose that
⟨x −2⟩+ f ∈Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩.
We must ﬁnd an element of Q whose value is ⟨x−2⟩+f. By applying the Division Theorem
4.2 we have that f = (x −2)q + r, where the degree of the remainder r is less than the
degree of x −2; this means that r is a constant. But then
λ(r) = ⟨x −2⟩+ r = ⟨x −2⟩+ (x −2)q + r = ⟨x −2⟩+ f.
This example is a concrete illustration of the general theorem that explains this; this
theorem is called the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Commutative Rings.

14.2
The Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem
We’re now ready to show the true equivalence of the notions of homomorphism and ideal
by proving the theorem we’ve been leading up to for some time. Given a surjective homo-
morphism ϕ : R →S between commutative rings R and S, we know that ker(ϕ) is an ideal,
and so we have another homomorphism ν : R →R/ ker(ϕ). We claim that the ranges of
these homomorphisms are ‘essentially the same’, and what’s more, the functions themselves
are ‘essentially the same’. We use the language of isomorphism to state this formally.
Theorem 14.1
The Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Commutative
Rings
Let ϕ : R →S be a surjective homomorphism between rings, and let ν :
R →R/ ker(ϕ) be the usual natural homomorphism. Then there exists an isomorphism
µ : R/ ker(ϕ) →S such that µ ◦ν = ϕ.
We exhibit this situation in the following diagram:
R
S
R/ker(ϕ)
ϕ
ν
µ
For simplicity’s sake, in this book we are restricting our attention in this theorem to
commutative rings, because we’ve really only looked at the concept of ideal in this case.
However, at the expense of only slightly more work, a more general such theorem actually
remains true in the case of arbitrary rings; we won’t pursue this matter here.
Proof:
Suppose that R and S are commutative rings, ϕ : R →S is a surjective homomor-
phism, and ν : R →R/ ker(ϕ) is the natural homomorphism. Clearly what we need to do is
deﬁne a function µ, and prove that it has the desired properties. Once we’ve obtained the
appropriate deﬁnition, the rest of the proof will ﬂow smoothly (if a bit lengthily, because
there are a lot of properties for µ we have to verify).
Choose an arbitrary element of R/ ker(ϕ); it is a coset of the form ker(ϕ) + r, where
r ∈R. What element of S should it correspond to? If the composition of functions required
in the theorem is to work, we must have that µ(ker(ϕ) + r) = ϕ(r); this is our deﬁnition of
µ.
There is an immediate problem we must solve: This deﬁnition apparently depends on the
particular coset representative r. That is, our function does not appear to be unambiguously
deﬁned. But suppose that ker(ϕ)+r = ker(ϕ)+s. Then r −s ∈ker(ϕ), and so ϕ(r) = ϕ(s).
Thus, it really didn’t matter what coset representative we chose, and so our function is well
deﬁned. Furthermore, it has been deﬁned precisely so that µ ◦ν(r) = µ(ker(ϕ) + r) = ϕ(r).
We must now check that µ is an isomorphism; we take each of the required properties
in turn:
µ is a homomorphism: But
µ((ker(ϕ) + r)(ker(ϕ) + s))
=
µ(ker(ϕ) + rs)
=
ϕ(rs) = ϕ(r)ϕ(s)
=
µ(ker(ϕ) + r)µ(ker(ϕ) + s),

Chapter 14: The Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
151
and similarly for addition.
µ is surjective: But ϕ is onto, and so for any s ∈S, there exists r ∈R such that ϕ(r) = s.
Then µ(ker(ϕ) + r) = ϕ(r) = s.
µ is injective: Suppose that µ(ker(ϕ) + r) = µ(ker(ϕ) + s); then ϕ(r) = ϕ(s), and so
r −s ∈ker(ϕ). But then ker(ϕ) + r = ker(ϕ) + s, as required. (You should note that this
argument is just the reverse of the argument proving that µ is well deﬁned.)
 Quick Exercise.
Think about why the parenthetic remark is true.
We thus have the isomorphism required by the theorem.

Examples
Example 14.1
Let’s look yet again at Example 11.2 where ϕ : Q[x] →Q is the function that evaluates
a polynomial at 2. Because this homomorphism is onto and its kernel is ⟨x−2⟩, Theorem
14.1 asserts that the rings Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩and Q are isomorphic, via the map µ which
is deﬁned by µ(⟨x −2⟩+ f) = f(2). In Section 14.1 we proved directly that these two
rings are isomorphic, via the map λ : Q →Q[x]/⟨x −2⟩deﬁned by λ(q) = ⟨x −2⟩+ q.
What is the relationship between the functions λ and µ? They are inverse functions.
For
µ(λ(q)) = µ(⟨x −2⟩+ q) = µ ◦ν(q) = ϕ(q) = q(2) = q.
(Notice this last equality holds because we are thinking of q as a constant polynomial.)
Example 14.2
If we apply the theorem to the residue homomorphism ϕ : Z →Z4, we obtain what
we already suspected: Z/⟨4⟩and Z4 are isomorphic rings.
Example 14.3
Consider the function ϕ : Z × Z →Z deﬁned by ϕ(x, y) = y; you can easily check that
this is a surjective homomorphism. (Indeed, this was veriﬁed in a more general context
as Exercise 11.4.) The kernel of this homomorphism is clearly {(x, 0) : x ∈Z}, which
we might write as Z×{0}. (Note that in Section 12.5 we asked you for a homomorphism
with this ideal as kernel.) Our theorem thus asserts that (Z×Z)/(Z×{0}) is isomorphic
to Z. Notice also that in Exercise 13.7 you proved that this quotient ring is a domain;
because we’ve now shown that it is isomorphic to Z, this result should not be surprising.
Example 14.4
Let’s now consider two general but trivial examples of the theorem. Given any com-
mutative ring R, it always possesses two ideals; namely, the trivial ideal {0} and the
improper ideal R itself. These are certainly the kernels of the identity isomorphism
ι : R →R and of the zero homomorphism ζ : R →{0}, respectively. Theorem 14.1
then asserts in the one case that R is isomorphic to R/{0}, and in the other that R/R
is isomorphic to {0}. Speaking informally, this says that if we mod zero out of a ring,
we have left it unaﬀected, while if we mod out the entire ring, we are left with the zero
ring.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 14.5
As another example of the theorem, consider the function ϕ : R[x] →C deﬁned
by ϕ(f) = f(i). Notice that evaluating a polynomial with real coeﬃcients at the
complex number i will certainly give a complex number. As usual, an evaluation map
of this sort is a homomorphism. What is the kernel of this function? It consists of
{f ∈R[x] : f(i) = 0}, but these are precisely those polynomials which have x2 + 1 as
a factor. That is, the kernel here is again a principal ideal, this time ⟨x2 + 1⟩. Thus,
we have that the ﬁeld of complex numbers is isomorphic to R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩.
The previous example is actually an algebraically elegant way of describing how we
obtain the complex numbers from the real numbers. The goal in obtaining the complex
numbers is after all to be able to solve more equations (such as x2 + 1 = 0). We will inquire
more carefully into this example soon, but we will ﬁrst have to characterize those ideals
that lead to ﬁelds as their rings of cosets. This characterization is one of the goals of the
next chapter.
Example 14.6
For another more sophisticated example of a homomorphism onto a ﬁeld, consider the
function
ϕ : Z[
√
−5] →Z3
deﬁned as ϕ(a + b√−5) = [a −b]3. (Recall Exercise 7.2 for a description of rings of the
form Z[√n].) Let’s ﬁrst check that this is a homomorphism. We see that ϕ preserves
addition:
ϕ((a + b
√
−5) + (c + d
√
−5)) = [(a + c) −(b + d)] =
[a −b] + [c −d] = ϕ(a + b
√
−5) + ϕ(c + d
√
−5).
Similarly, ϕ preserves multiplication:
ϕ((a + b
√
−5)(c + d
√
−5))
=
ϕ((ac −5bd) + (ad + bc)
√
−5)
=
[ac −5bd −ad −bc]
=
[ac −ad + bd −bc]
=
[(a −b)(c −d)]
=
ϕ(a + b
√
−5)ϕ(c + d
√
−5)
(where we’ve used the fact that [−5] = [1]). The kernel of this function is
{a + b
√
−5 : 3|(a −b)}.
Since this is evidently the kernel, we know that this is an ideal, although that is not
entirely obvious (see Exercise 9). Thus, we have that
Z[
√
−5]/{a + b
√
−5 : 3|(a −b)}
is isomorphic to the ﬁeld Z3.
This would be a good deal more satisfying if we had a more concrete description
of this kernel. We claim that it is actually the smallest ideal of Z[√−5] that contains
the elements 3 and 1+√−5; that is, it is ⟨3, 1+√−5⟩. To show this, we note ﬁrst that
clearly
3, 1 +
√
−5 ∈{a + b
√
−5 : 3|(a −b)},
and so therefore the smallest ideal containing these two elements is a subset of the
kernel. For the reverse inclusion, suppose that a −b is divisible by 3. Then a −b = 3k,
and so
a + b
√
−5
=
a(1 +
√
−5) + (b −a)
√
−5
=
a(1 +
√
−5) −k(
√
−5)(3) ∈⟨3, 1 +
√
−5⟩.

Chapter 14: The Isomorphism Theorem for Rings
153
That is,
⟨3, 1 +
√
−5⟩= {x + y
√
−5 : 3 divides (x −y)},
and so Z[√−5]/⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is isomorphic to Z3.
Now what is even more interesting about this kernel is that this description is as
good as we can do – it is not a principal ideal! You will verify this in Exercise 10.
Historical Remarks
The equivalence between homomorphisms and kernels, as expressed in the Fundamental
Isomorphism Theorem for Commutative Rings, is a crucial idea in abstract algebra; there
are corresponding theorems for many other algebraic structures. Indeed, we will encounter
the corresponding theorem for groups in Chapter 26. The crisp, abstract formulation of this
theorem contained in this chapter is very much an artifact of the 20th century axiomatic
approach to algebra. The ideas behind this theory were encountered in many speciﬁc situa-
tions in the 19th century, but the sort of formulation we give here was not possible until the
now accepted axiomatics for such algebraic structures as rings, groups, and ﬁelds were ﬁrmly
in place. A lot of work and thought by many mathematicians went into these deﬁnitions.
The French mathematician Camille Jordan was probably the ﬁrst to consider clearly the
notion of a quotient structure such as our ring of cosets R/I; he was working in the speciﬁc
context of permutation groups. (See Chapters 18 and 27.) It is important for you to keep
in mind that the abstract and eﬃcient structure of modern algebra was not born overnight,
but rather was the result of painstaking study of examples, from all over mathematics. The
lesson of this history is clear: We should appreciate the generality of our theorems but must
always return to speciﬁc examples to understand their purpose and application.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we proved the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Commutative Rings,
which asserts that every onto homomorphism can be viewed as a natural homomorphism
onto the ring modulo the kernel.

Exercises
1. Prove that Z[i]/⟨1 + i⟩is isomorphic to Z2, by deﬁning a homomorphism from Z[i]
onto Z2 whose kernel is ⟨1 + i⟩, and using the Fundamental Theorem 14.1. (Compare
this to Exercise 13.4.)
2. Let I = {f ∈C[0, 1] : f(1/4) = 0}. Prove that C[0, 1]/I is isomorphic to R by deﬁn-

Theorem 14.1. (Compare this to Exercise 13.5.)
3. Let I = ⟨(3, 4)⟩⊆Z × Z. Prove that (Z × Z)/I is isomorphic to Z12, by using a

to Exercise 13.6.)
4. Use the Fundamental Theorem to prove that
(Q[x] × Z)/⟨(x, 2)⟩
is isomorphic to Q × Z2.
5. Let R be the set Q × Q. We will equip this set with operations, other than the
usual ones for the direct product, as described in Example 6.10. Namely, deﬁne the
operations
(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)
(this is the usual addition), and
(a, b)(c, d) = (ac, ad + bc).
(a) Prove from ﬁrst principles that R is a ring.
(b) Use the Fundamental Theorem to prove that R is isomorphic to Q[x]/⟨x2⟩.
6. Prove that Z2 × Z3 is isomorphic to Z6 by showing that the homomorphism
ϕ([a]2, [b]3) = [3a + 4b]6 is onto and has zero kernel. (Or, simply that it is onto

principle discussed in Section 16.1.) What gets mapped to [1]6? To [2]6? [3]6? [4]6?

8. Consider the ring Z[α], described in Exercise 7.3. Prove that
Z[α]/⟨1 + α⟩
is isomorphic to the ring Z6, by deﬁning a homomorphism ϕ : Z[α] →Z6 with the
appropriate kernel. (Compare this to Exercise 13.8.)
9. In Example 14.6, we concluded that {a + b√−5 : 3|(a −b)} is an ideal in Z[√−5] by
observing that it is the kernel of a ring homomorphism. In this exercise, you should
show directly that this is an ideal, by verifying that this set is closed under subtraction
and multiplicative absorption.
10. In Example 14.6, we show that the kernel described in the previous exercise can be
more simply described as ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩. In this exercise you will show that this ideal
is not principal. Suppose by way of contradiction that it is principal with generator
α = a + b√−5. Then both 3 and 1 + √−5 must be multiples of α. Use the complex
absolute value and Theorem 8.3 to conclude that |α|2 must divide both 9 and 6.
Obtain a contradiction from this.

by way of contradiction that there exists a ring isomorphism ϕ : C →R. Now answer
the following questions (justifying your answers, of course): What is ϕ(1)? What is
ϕ(−1)? What does this tell you about ϕ(i)?
14. In this problem you will prove that the ﬁelds R and Q are not isomorphic. Suppose

17. Suppose that rings R and S are isomorphic, via the isomorphism ϕ : R →S.
(a) Show that the rings R[x] and S[x] are isomorphic, by deﬁning a ring isomorphism
¯ϕ : R[x] →S[x] which extends ϕ; by this we mean that if r ∈R, then ϕ(r) = ¯ϕ(r).
(b) Suppose now that the rings R and S are ﬁelds. Prove that r ∈R is a root of
f ∈R[x] if and only if ϕ(r) is a root of ¯ϕ(f).
(c) Suppose again that R and S are ﬁelds. Prove that f ∈R[x] is irreducible if and
only if ¯ϕ(f) ∈S[x] is irreducible.

19. Extend Exercise 18. Suppose that the commutative rings R and S are isomorphic via
the isomorphism ϕ : R →S. Let I be an ideal of R; by Exercise 11.32 we know that
ϕ(I) is an ideal of S. Prove that the rings R/I and S/ϕ(I) are isomorphic.
20. Suppose that the commutative rings R and S are isomorphic via the isomorphism

21. Suppose that R is a commutative ring, with ideals A and I, where I ⊆A.
(a) Prove that A/I is an ideal in the ring R/I.
(b) Prove the converse of part (a). Namely, show that any ideal of R/I is of the form
A/I, where A is an ideal of R containing I.
(c) Prove that (R/I)/(A/I) is isomorphic to R/A.
22. Let R = C[0, 1], I = {f ∈C[0, 1] : f(0) = f(1) = 0} and A = {f ∈C[0, 1] : f(0) =

the isomorphism given by that exercise.
23. Let R be a commutative ring with ideals I and J. Then I ∩J and I +J are also ideals
of R. (See Exercises 9.16 and 9.18.) Furthermore, I ∩J is an ideal of I, and J is an
ideal of I + J. (See Exercise 9.17.) Prove that the rings I/(I ∩J) and (I + J)/J are
isomorphic.
24. Let R be Z, I = ⟨12⟩and J = ⟨8⟩. Check that R, I, J satisfy the hypotheses of Exercise
23. Then exhibit explicitly the isomorphism given by that exercise.
25. The essence of the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem is that if ϕ : R →S is a
surjective homomorphism, then the rings S and R/ ker(ϕ) are isomorphic, and our
proof deﬁnes an isomorphism µ : R/ ker(ϕ) →S. It is possible instead to prove this
theorem by deﬁning an isomorphism λ : S →R/ ker(ϕ). Carry this out, making sure
your function λ is well-deﬁned, preserves addition and multiplication, and is bijective.

Chapter 15
Maximal and Prime Ideals
Let’s return to Example 14.5. We saw that the ring homomorphism (the evaluation homo-
morphism) ϕ : R[x] →C given by ϕ(f) = f(i) has kernel ⟨x2 + 1⟩. This homomorphism is
surjective, and so R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩is isomorphic to the ﬁeld C.
Now compare this to the residue homomorphism ϕ : Z →Z7. This homomorphism is
surjective, and so Z/⟨7⟩is isomorphic to the ﬁeld Z7.
We would like to ﬁnd out what sort of ideal leads to a ring of cosets that is a ﬁeld.
15.1
Irreducibles
Notice that x2+1 is an irreducible element of R[x] (that is, it is a polynomial that cannot be
further factored in R[x]), and 7 is an irreducible element of Z (that is, it is an integer that
cannot be further factored in Z). This suggests we should make a more general deﬁnition.
A non-zero element p of a commutative ring with unity R is irreducible if
(1) it is a non-unit, and
(2) if whenever p = ab, then (exactly) one of a and b is a unit.
Let’s explore some examples of this concept.
Example 15.1
The irreducibles in Z are exactly the prime numbers (and their negatives).
Example 15.2
The irreducibles in R[x] are exactly the linear polynomials, together with the quadratics
with negative discriminant. (See Theorem 10.3.)
Example 15.3
The irreducibles in Q[x] include all linear polynomials, in addition to such polynomials
as x2 + 1, x3 −2, and others.
Example 15.4
Consider the case of a ﬁeld. Here, all non-zero elements are units, and so in a ﬁeld
there are no irreducible elements.
157

158
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 15.5
What are irreducible elements in Z[x]? Note that although 3x+6 is irreducible in Q[x],
it is not irreducible in Z[x]. This is because 3 is a non-unit in Z[x], and so the factoriza-
tion 3x+6 = 3(x+2) is non-trivial. Thus, the coeﬃcients of an irreducible polynomial
in Z[x] can have no common integer factor (other than ±1). Such polynomials in Z[x]
are called primitive. Gauss’s Lemma 5.5 asserts that primitive polynomials (with
degree greater than zero) of Z[x] are irreducible if and only if they are irreducible in
Q[x]. And what about polynomials of degree zero in Z[x] (that is, the integers)? Any
factorization of such a polynomial would also be factorization in Z. Thus, 3 (and any
other prime integer, or its negative) will be an irreducible element of Z[x].
Example 15.6
What are the irreducible elements of Z4? In this ring, 1 and 3 are units, and so the
only possible irreducible is 2. But the only factorizations of 2 in Z4 are 2 = 1 · 2 and
2 = 3 · 2, which are both trivial; thus, 2 is irreducible. Note in this case that 2 has no
associates other than itself.
For an integral domain R, we are now going to translate the statement that p is an
irreducible element in terms of the principal ideal ⟨p⟩. We do this in the spirit of our
discussion of principal ideals in chapter 9. Since p is a non-unit, this means that ⟨p⟩is a
proper ideal. But if ⟨p⟩⊆⟨a⟩, then p = ab. Since p is irreducible, we may as well assume that
b is a unit. But then p and a are associates, and ⟨p⟩= ⟨a⟩. The upshot of this is that there
is no proper principal ideal strictly larger than ⟨p⟩. Conversely, suppose that the principal
ideal ⟨p⟩is maximal among all proper principal ideals. To show that p is irreducible, suppose
that p = ab. Since p is not a unit, at least one of a, b is also a non-unit; we may as well
assume that a is a non-unit. Now clearly ⟨p⟩⊆⟨a⟩, and by maximality these must be equal,
because ⟨a⟩̸= R, since a is not a unit. But then p and a are associates by Theorem 9.3, and
so b is a unit.
We record as a theorem the conclusion we have reached:
Theorem 15.1 Let R be an integral domain. Then the element p ∈R is an irreducible
element if and only if there is no strictly larger principal ideal in R.
Let’s now look at the whole ideal structure of Z in light of the above discussion. We know
that the principal ideals which admit no larger proper principal ideals are given exactly by
the ideals of the form ⟨p⟩, where p is an irreducible (or prime) integer, and containments
reﬂect divisibility. But note from Theorem 9.5 that all ideals of Z are principal, and so these
ideals are maximal among all proper ideals. A proper ideal of any commutative ring with
unity for which there is no larger proper ideal is called a maximal ideal. We will explore
this important concept more in the following section. Remember that an integral domain
for which all ideals is principal is called a principal ideal domain, or PID for short (see
Section 9.4). So in a PID an ideal ⟨p⟩is maximal if and only if p is an irreducible element.
Here then is a picture of the ideals in Z:

In contrast, consider a domain like Z[x]; see our discussion above in Example 15.5.
Because the element x is irreducible, we have that ⟨x⟩is certainly maximal among principal
ideals, but this is not a maximal ideal, because the non-principal ideal ⟨2, x⟩is strictly
larger – see Example 9.12. In fact, we claim that the ideal ⟨2, x⟩is a maximal ideal. For
if we choose any element f outside ⟨2, x⟩, then f will have an odd constant term, and so
f = 2n + 1 + xg, where n is an integer and g ∈Z[x]. But then 1 = f −2n −xg and so any
ideal containing f, 2, x must include unity 1, and so is the whole ring.
Now what is the meaning in a computational sense of the maximality of a principal ideal
in a domain? If ⟨p⟩is maximal and a /∈⟨p⟩, then the ideal ⟨p, a⟩must be the entire domain,
because it is certainly a strictly larger ideal than ⟨p⟩. But ⟨p, a⟩is the entire domain exactly
if it contains (any) unit, and in particular if 1 ∈⟨p, a⟩. That is, 1 = px + ay, for some x, y
in the domain.
Example 15.7
Consider the maximal ideal ⟨7⟩in Z. Now, 12 /∈⟨7⟩. But
3 · 12 + (−5) · 7 = 1,
and so ⟨7, 12⟩= Z. Of course, the fact that there exist x and y such that 12x + 7y = 1
is just an example of the GCD identity for Z. This reveals a more general principle
operating in the ideal structure of Z: ⟨a, b⟩= ⟨c⟩, where c = gcd(a, b). (See Exercise
9.15.)
Example 15.8
Because x is an irreducible element in Q[x] and this ring is a PID (Exercise 9.2),
we know that ⟨x⟩is a maximal ideal; notice the contrast to our discussion about
Z[x] above. To see this computationally, choose f /∈⟨x⟩. Because ⟨x⟩consists of the
polynomials in Q[x] with zero constant term, f must have a non-zero constant term c,
and so f can be written as f = c + xg, where g is some polynomial in Q[x]. But direct
computation shows that
1 = c−1f + (−c−1g)x.
This last expression is a linear combination of f and x, and so 1 ∈⟨x, f⟩. Thus,
⟨x, f⟩= Q[x], and so ⟨x⟩is a maximal ideal, as claimed.

15.2
Maximal Ideals
We now would like to focus our attention on maximal ideals in any commutative ring with
unity. We observed in the introduction to this chapter that both R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩and Z/⟨7⟩
are ﬁelds. This suggests the following theorem:
Theorem 15.2 Let R be a commutative ring with unity. Then M is a maximal ideal of R
if and only if R/M is a ﬁeld.
Proof:
Let R be a commutative ring with unity, and suppose ﬁrst that M is a maximal
ideal. To show that R/M is a ﬁeld, we consider any M + a ∈R/M, with M + a ̸= M + 0;
we must show that M + a has a multiplicative inverse. But because M + a ̸= M, we know
that a /∈M. Consider
⟨M, a⟩= {m + ab : m ∈M, b ∈R};
we are using the notation ⟨M, a⟩to suggest that this is in fact the smallest ideal of R that
contains both M and a. In Exercise 1, you prove exactly this.
Furthermore, ⟨M, a⟩properly contains M, because a ∈⟨M, a⟩but a /∈M. Thus, because
M is maximal, ⟨M, a⟩= R. So there exist b ∈R and m ∈M such that m + ab = 1. But
then
M + 1 = M + (m + ab) = M + ab = (M + a)(M + b),
and so M + b is the required multiplicative inverse.
Conversely, suppose that R/M is a ﬁeld. Let I be an ideal with R ⊇I ⊃M; we must
show that I = R. Choose r, an element in I but not in M. Because R/M is a ﬁeld, there
exists s ∈R such that M + rs = M + 1. That is, M = M + 1 −rs or 1 −rs = m for some
m in M. But 1 = rs + m implies 1 ∈I, because r ∈I and m ∈I. Now 1 ∈I implies that
I = R. Hence, M is maximal.

Example 15.9
An important if relatively trivial example of this theorem occurs in case R itself is
a ﬁeld. Because all non-zero elements are units, we’ve observed before that the only
proper ideal a ﬁeld has is {0}; hence, {0} is (practically by default) a maximal ideal,
and so the theorem applies. That is, the ring of cosets R/{0} is a ﬁeld; but of course
this ring is just (isomorphic to) R itself. But we can also apply the converse: If R
is a commutative ring with unity without ideals (other than {0} and R), then R is
necessarily a ﬁeld. (Of course, we’ve seen this result before as Corollary 9.4.)
Example 15.10
In Example 14.5 we proved that R[x]/⟨x2 +1⟩is isomorphic to the ﬁeld C. This means
that ⟨x2 + 1⟩is a maximal ideal in R[x].
Example 15.11
In Example 14.6 we proved that Z[√−5]/⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is isomorphic to the ﬁeld Z3.
This means that ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is a maximal ideal of Z[√−5].

Chapter 15: Maximal and Prime Ideals
161
Example 15.12
Consider the irreducible polynomial x2 −2 in Q[x] (note that this is not irreducible
in R[x]). Now Q[x] is a principal ideal domain, and so like the examples at the start
of the chapter, we have that ⟨x2 −2⟩is a maximal ideal in Q[x]. Thus, by Theorem
15.2, we know that Q[x]/⟨x2 −2⟩is a ﬁeld. But what is this ﬁeld? Consider the
evaluation homomorphism ϕ : Q[x] →R, given by ϕ(f) = f(
√
2). Quite evidently,
the kernel of this homomorphism is exactly ⟨x2 −2⟩. But it seems clear that ϕ is not
onto R. For example,
√
3 /∈ϕ(Q[x]): We cannot obtain
√
3 by plugging
√
2 into a
rational polynomial (this statement is probably plausible, but we won’t prove it here
– see Example 37.2). But if ϕ is not onto, we cannot directly apply the Fundamental
Isomorphism Theorem 14.1. What the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem does tell
us is that Q[x]/⟨x2 −2⟩is isomorphic to ϕ(Q[x]), a proper subﬁeld of the ﬁeld R.
Furthermore, this ﬁeld Q[x]/⟨x2 −2⟩contains a subring isomorphic to Q: Consider
the function
ι : Q →Q[x]/⟨x2 −2⟩
deﬁned by ι(q) = ⟨x2 −2⟩+ q.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is an injective homomorphism (which is not
onto). 
Thus, ι(Q) is the isomorphic copy of Q contained in the ﬁeld Q[x]/⟨x2 −2⟩. This
suggests that we can use the previous theorem to build bigger ﬁelds. In this case we
seem to have constructed a ﬁeld strictly between Q and R. We’ll have a lot to say
about this in Chapters 41 and 42.
An alternative proof for Theorem 15.2 is possible, using ideas from Exercise 14.21. There
we discover that the ideals of a ring of cosets R/I are exactly of the form A/I, where A ⊇I
is an ideal of R. But furthermore, we know that a commutative ring with unity is a ﬁeld if
and only if it has no proper ideals except the zero ideal (Corollary 9.4 or Example 15.9).
But then R/I has no proper ideals except the zero ideal I/I, if and only if there are no
ideals A with R ⊃A ⊃I, that is, if and only if I is a maximal ideal of R.
15.3
Prime Ideals
We now consider a class of ideals closely related to the class of maximal ideals. A proper
ideal I of a commutative ring with unity is a prime ideal if whenever ab ∈I, then either
a ∈I or b ∈I. Let’s look at an example of a prime ideal.
Example 15.13
Consider the ideal ⟨x⟩in Z[x]. We claim that it is prime: For if pq ∈⟨x⟩, then pq is a
polynomial with no constant term. But the constant term of a product of polynomials
is the product of their constant terms, and so this means that at least one of p and q
must also lack a constant term; that is, at least one of p and q belongs to ⟨x⟩. This is
what we wished to show.
Thus, ⟨x⟩is a prime ideal in Z[x]. Now consider another evaluation homomorphism, this
time at zero: If ψ(f) = f(0), then ker(ψ) = ⟨x⟩. Of course, ψ is here a homomorphism onto
Z, and so Z[x]/⟨x⟩is isomorphic to Z. Thus, we conclude that ⟨x⟩is not a maximal ideal

162
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
(because Z is not a ﬁeld). More directly, we can conclude that ⟨x⟩is not a maximal ideal,
by noting that
⟨x⟩⊂⟨2, x⟩⊂Z[x].
However, the homomorphic image Z is at least a domain; this observation suggests the
following theorem:
Theorem 15.3 Let R be a commutative ring with unity. Then P is a prime ideal if and
only if R/P is an integral domain.
Proof:
Let R be a commutative ring with unity, and suppose ﬁrst that P is a prime ideal.
To show that R/P is a domain (because it obviously has unity) we need only show that it
has no zero divisors. So suppose that (P + a)(P + b) = P + 0. But then ab ∈P, and so
because P is prime a or b belongs to P, and so P +a = P +0 or P +b = P +0, as required.
In the Quick Exercise below you will do the converse argument, which is essentially the
reverse of what we’ve just done.
2
 Quick Exercise.
Prove the converse of the above theorem. 
Note in particular the special case when R itself is a domain. We conclude that a
commutative ring with unity is a domain if and only if {0} is a prime ideal.
Because all ﬁelds are domains, we can conclude that maximal ideals are necessarily
prime.
For principal ideals, there is an element-wise characterization of when such an ideal is
prime; you will prove this characterization in Exercise 2. These ideas will be important
when we study factorization theory in domains, in Chapter 32.
Example 15.14
As an example of Theorem 15.3, consider (from Example 11.3) the ring Z × Z and
the homomorphism π(x, y) = y, which is onto Z. Because Z is a domain, the kernel
Z × {0} is a prime ideal of Z × Z (that is also not maximal).
15.4
An Extended Example
We will now look at all of these ideas in the context of the ideal ⟨3x + 3⟩, both in Z[x] and
in Q[x]. This will provide some further insight into all of the theorems of this chapter.
Now in Q[x] the polynomial 3x + 3 is irreducible (since any linear polynomial is – see
Section 5.1). The extra factor 3 is a unit in Q[x], and so 3x + 3 and x + 1 are associates
and ⟨x + 1⟩= ⟨3x + 3⟩. Since x + 1 is irreducible, we know know that this principal ideal is
maximal among all other principal ideals. But Q[x] is a PID (see Exercise 9.2), and so ⟨x+1⟩
is a maximal ideal. Of course, this also follows because it is the kernel of the evaluation
homomorphism ϕ1 : Q[x] →Q deﬁned by ϕ1(f) = f(−1), which is onto the ﬁeld Q.
The situation is rather diﬀerent in Z[x]. Here both 3 and x + 1 are non-units, and so
3x+3 = 3(x+1) is not irreducible. This means that the ideal ⟨3x+3⟩is not maximal among
all principal ideals, and it is indeed quite clear that ⟨3x+3⟩⊂⟨3⟩and also ⟨3x+3⟩⊂⟨x+1⟩.
 Quick Exercise.
Why are these set containments proper?

Now ⟨3⟩is quite evidently the set of all polynomials in Z[x] for which every non-zero

Chapter 15: Maximal and Prime Ideals
163
coeﬃcient is divisible by 3. What kind of ideal is this? It is actually the kernel of the ring
homomorphism
ϕ2 : Z[x] →Z3[x]
deﬁned by
ϕ2(a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn) = [a0] + [a1]x + · · · + [an]xn,
where the square brackets indicate that we should reduce each coeﬃcient modulo 3. (You
will verify the details of this homomorphism, including the fact that its kernel is ⟨3⟩in
Exercise 23.) Now Z3 is a ﬁeld, and so Z3[x] is an integral domain that is not a ﬁeld. This
means that the ideal ⟨3⟩is a prime ideal that is not maximal.
What about the ideal ⟨x + 1⟩? This is the kernel of the same evaluation homomorphism
ϕ1 (except restricted to Z[x]). This is not entirely obvious, because we cannot simply prove
this by dividing an arbitrary polynomial by x+1 using the Division Theorem: Since Z is not
a ﬁeld, this ring does not have a division theorem. However, Gauss’s Lemma (Theorem 5.5)
allows us to conclude this (you will verify these details in Exercise 24). But the evaluation
homomorphism restricted to Z[x] is onto Z, which is a domain and not a ﬁeld. This means
that ⟨x + 1⟩is also a prime ideal that is not maximal.
But we can see that both of these principal ideals are proper subsets of the ideal ⟨3, x+1⟩.
Note that this latter ideal is not principal – a proof very similar to the proof we used to
show that ⟨2, x⟩is not principal is possible here (see Example 9.12).
 Quick Exercise.
Carry out this modiﬁed proof. 
We now claim furthermore that ⟨3, x + 1⟩is a maximal ideal. We can show this by
claiming that it is the kernel of the homomorphism
ϕ3 : Z[x] →Z3.
Here is how we deﬁne this homomorphism. Given any f ∈Z[x], we let ϕ3(f) = [f(−1)]3.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is a surjective homomorphism. 
It is clear that ⟨3, x + 1⟩is a subset of the kernel, because each of the generators is sent
to 0 by this homomorphism. But conversely, by Exercise 24 any element of the kernel must
be of the form 3k + (x + 1)h, where k ∈Z and h ∈Z[x], and this is obviously an element
of ⟨3, x + 1⟩.
Consequently, we can now conclude that ⟨3, x+1⟩is a maximal, non-principal ideal that
contains the ideals ⟨3⟩and ⟨x + 1⟩.
But what about the original ideal ⟨3x + 3⟩? What kind of ideal is this? While clearly
not maximal, could it be prime? Consider the following easy computation in Z[x]/⟨3x + 3⟩:
(⟨3x + 3⟩+ 3)(⟨3x + 3⟩+ (x + 1)) = ⟨3x + 3⟩+ (3x + 3) = ⟨3x + 3⟩+ 0.
We have thus shown that this ring has zero divisors and is consequently not an integral
domain. Consequently, ⟨3x + 3⟩is not a prime ideal either.
15.5
Finite Products of Domains
Let’s generalize Example 15.14. Suppose
R1, R2, · · · , Rn

Exercises
are rings and Q Ri = R1 × R2 × · · · × Rn is their n-fold direct product. Recall that
Y
Ri = {(r1, r2, · · · , rn) : ri ∈Ri, for i = 1, 2, · · · , n}.
(See Exercise 6.15.) Now for each j consider the function
πj :
Y
Ri →Rj
deﬁned by πj(r1, r2, · · · , rn) = rj. This map is called the jth projection. Because of the
deﬁnition of the ring operations on Q Ri (which are component-wise) it is obvious that πj
is an onto homomorphism; furthermore, its kernel is
R1 × R2 × · · · × Rj−1 × {0} × Rj+1 × · · · × Rn.
Note that if Rj is a domain, then this kernel is a prime ideal. Similarly, if Rj is a ﬁeld, then
this kernel is a maximal ideal.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
Even if all the Ri are domains, then Q Ri certainly is not: For
(a1, a2, · · · , an)(b1, b2, · · · , bn) = (0, 0, · · · , 0)
if and only if aibi = 0 for each i. But because the Ri are domains, either ai or bi is 0. We
thus have the product in Q Ri being zero if and only if the set {i : ai ̸= 0} is disjoint from
the set {j : bj ̸= 0}. For example, (3, 1, 0, 0)(0, 0, 0, 5) = (0, 0, 0, 0). Thus, although Q Ri is
not a domain, determination of which elements are zero divisors is certainly an easy matter.
This means that representing a given ring as (isomorphic) to a product of rings is often
a real help toward understanding the arithmetic of the ring. We will see a dramatic and
famous example of this in the next chapter.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we discussed the concept of irreducible elements of a commutative ring with
unity. We showed that in a PID, an element is irreducible if and only if its principal ideal
is a maximal ideal. We then showed that an ideal I of a commutative ring R is maximal if
and only if R/I is a ﬁeld. Similarly, we discussed prime ideals and showed that an ideal I
is prime if and only if R/I is a domain.

Chapter 16
The Chinese Remainder Theorem
We can cast considerable light on the arithmetic of the rings Zm, by making use of the
theory of the previous chapters. We will in the process encounter a famous and ancient
result known as the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
16.1
Some Examples
Let’s begin by looking at an example.
Example 16.1
Consider the ring Z6. The function ϕ : Z6 →Z3 deﬁned by ϕ([a]6) = [a]3 obviously
preserves addition and multiplication and hence is a homomorphism, if it is well deﬁned.
But if [a]6 = [b]6, then 6|(a −b), and so 3|(a −b); thus,
ϕ([a]6) = [a]3 = [b]3 = ϕ([b]6)
and so ϕ is well deﬁned. Note also that ϕ is onto. Because Z3 is a ﬁeld, we have that
ker(ϕ) = ⟨[3]⟩is a maximal ideal.
Now the corresponding function ψ : Z6 →Z2 is also a homomorphism, and its
kernel ⟨[2]⟩is also a maximal ideal.
Let’s put these two homomorphisms together, using the idea of direct product.
Namely, deﬁne µ : Z6 →Z3 × Z2 by setting
µ([a]6) = (ϕ([a]6), ψ([a]6) = ([a]3, [a]2).
It is easy to see that this is a homomorphism, because ϕ and ψ are.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. 
Because the zero element of the direct product Z3 × Z2 is the element ([0], [0]), an
element of Z6 belongs to the kernel of µ only if it belongs to the kernels of both ϕ and
ψ. That is, the kernel of µ is
⟨[3]⟩∩⟨[2]⟩= {[0], [3]} ∩{[0], [2], [4]} = {[0]}.
Thus, µ is actually injective (Corollary 12.4). Let’s write out the homomorphism µ
explicitly:
[0]6
7−→
([0]2, [0]3)
[1]6
7−→
([1]2, [1]3)
[2]6

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Notice that this function is actually surjective, and so Z6 is isomorphic to Z3 × Z2. We
have represented Z6 as a direct product of simpler pieces. And because those simpler
pieces Z3 and Z2 are domains (and in fact ﬁelds), the zero divisors in this ring are
easy to determine: They are those elements with a zero in at least one component.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this analysis coincides with what you already know
about which elements of Z6 are zero divisors.

Why did µ turn out to be surjective? Here the domain and range of µ are both
ﬁnite sets with 6 elements: Any injection from one such set to another must be onto –
this is an example of what is called the pigeonhole principle: If you have n pigeons
to put into n pigeon holes, and you never put two birds in one hole, all the holes must
be ﬁlled!
We would like to apply this sort of analysis to any ring of the form Zm. Before we do
this in general, let’s examine one more example.
Example 16.2
Now consider Z12. Let’s consider the residue homomorphisms Z12 →Z4 and Z12 →Z3:
They have kernels {[0], [4], [8]} and {[0], [3], [6], [9]}, and the intersection of these ideals
is zero.
 Quick Exercise.
Write down the two residue homomorphisms explicitly, verify
that their kernels are as stated, and then write out the isomorphism between Z12 and
Z4 × Z3 explicitly.

Now in this case, the representation is not quite so nice: Z4 is not a domain.
Equivalently the kernel {[0], [4], [8]} is not prime. The problem here is a repeated
prime factor in the prime factorization of 12. In Exercise 3 you will ﬁnd that the only
prime ideals of Z12 are
⟨[2]⟩= {[0], [2], [4], [6], [8], [10]} and ⟨[3]⟩= {[0], [3], [6], [9]}.
Notice that
⟨[2]⟩∩⟨[3]⟩= {[0], [6]} ⊃{[0]}.
Now, what are the zero divisors of Z4 × Z3? They must consist of elements that
are either zero in exactly one component, or else zero in the second component and a
zero divisor of Z4 in the ﬁrst component. These elements must correspond under our

Chinese Remainder Theorem
We now prove the general theorem that explains the representation of Z6 and Z12 as direct
products, which we obtained in Examples 16.1 and 16.2 above.
Theorem 16.1 Let p1, p2, · · · , pn be distinct prime integers and m = pk1

2 · · · pkn
n . Then
Zm is isomorphic to
Zpk1
1 × Zpk2

Proof:
Consider the function ϕi : Zm →Zp
ki
i
deﬁned by ϕi([a]m) = [a]p
ki
i ; this is well-
deﬁned because if [a]m = [b]m, then m|(a−b), and so pki
i |(a−b). It is clearly a homomorphism
with kernel ⟨[pki
i ]⟩. Now deﬁne the function
µ : Zm →Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
by setting
µ([a]) = (ϕ1([a]), · · · , ϕn([a])).
This is evidently a ring homomorphism.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. 
Now, its kernel is
n
\
i=1
⟨[pki
i ]⟩= {[a] : pki
i |a, for all i} = {[0]}.
This means that the homomorphism µ is injective.
To show that µ is an isomorphism, it remains to check that it is surjective. We will
actually do this twice, because both proofs are illuminating:
Existential Proof: Now Zm and Zpk1
1
× Zpk2
2
× · · · × Zpkn
n
are both ﬁnite sets with m
elements; thus, by the pigeonhole principle, because µ is injective, it must be surjective.
Constructive Proof: Given
([a1], [a2], · · · , [an]) ∈Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n ,
we must ﬁnd [a] ∈Zm such that ϕi([a]) = [ai], for all i. Let
mi = m
pki
i
;
because mi and pi are relatively prime, by the GCD identity there exist integers xi and yi
with ximi + yipki
i = 1. But then
[ximi]p
ki
i
= [1].
Now let
a = x1m1a1 + x2m2a2 + · · · + xnmnan.
We claim that ϕi([a]) = [ai], for all i. But pki
i |mj for all j ̸= i, and so
ϕi([a]) = [a]p
ki
i
= [ximiai] = [ximi][ai] = [1][ai] = [ai],
as required.

The number theory version of this theorem is known as the Chinese Remainder Theorem,
because an example of the sort of number theory problem it solves ﬁrst appears in a work
by the Chinese mathematician Sun Tsu, in about the third century AD. We now restate
the theorem in its number theoretic guise:
Theorem 16.2
The Chinese Remainder Theorem
Let p1, p2, · · · , pn be distinct
prime integers and m = pk1

Proof:
Consider the element
([a1], [a2], · · · , [an]) ∈Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n .
Because the function µ in the previous proof is surjective, there exists [a] ∈Zm so that
ϕi([a]) = [ai], for all i. Then a simultaneously satisﬁes the n congruences in the theorem.

Example 16.3
Consider the three congruences x ≡4 (mod 7), x ≡1 (mod 2), and x ≡3 (mod 5);
the theorem asserts that they have a simultaneous solution modulo 70. In fact, we can
construct the solution by following the constructive proof above. In this case m1 =
10, m2 = 35, and m3 = 14. Then x1 = 5 because
[5]7[10]7 = [5]7[3]7 = [1]7.
In a similar fashion x2 = 1 and x3 = 4. Then
a = (5)(10)(4) + (1)(35)(1) + (4)(14)(3) = 403.
But 403 ≡53 (mod 70), and so our simultaneous solution of the three congruences is
53.
 Quick Exercise.
Check directly that 53 satisﬁes these three congruences. 
Alternatively, we can view this example in light of our ﬁrst version of the Chinese
Remainder Theorem (Theorem 16.1). From that version of the theorem, we know that
Z7 × Z2 × Z5 is isomorphic to Z70. The isomorphism takes the element (4, 1, 3) to 53.
Note that if all the primes in the factorization of m occur only once, we then have that
Zm is a direct product of ﬁnitely many domains (in fact, ﬁelds). But suppose that at least
one prime divisor of m occurs with degree at least two. We claim that Zm cannot be a direct
product of domains; this amounts to claiming that the intersection of all the prime ideals
of Zm is not zero.
To show that this is true, we must ﬁrst convince ourselves that Zm even has any prime
ideals. But because Zm is a ﬁnite ring, it has only ﬁnitely many ideals; consequently, it
certainly has at least one maximal ideal (which is necessarily prime).
To show that the intersection of all the prime ideals of Zm is not zero, choose an arbi-
trary prime ideal P. Now Zm is isomorphic to Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
under the “usual”
isomorphism given in the proof of Theorem 16.1, where we may as well assume that k1 > 1.
Let [x]m be the element of Zm that gets mapped to the element of Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
that has [p1]pk1
1
in the ﬁrst component and [0] in all the other components. Because k1 > 1,
the element [x]m is non-zero. Furthermore,
[x]k1
m = [0]m ∈P.
But because P is prime, this implies that [x] ∈P.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
Hence, the intersection of all prime ideals of Zm contains [x]m, and so cannot be {[0]m};
thus, Zm in this case cannot be a direct product of domains. This is the general explanation
of the case m = 12.
 Quick Exercise.
What would be the value for [x]m in the case m = 12?

16.3
A General Chinese Remainder Theorem
The proof of Theorem 16.1 depends essentially on the fact that the separate prime power
factors are relatively prime to one another, and consequently we can use the GCD identity.
We can make a more general deﬁnition for this for any commutative ring with unity. We
will begin (as we did in Example 16.1) with only two ideals.
So let R be a commutative ring with unity, and suppose that I, J are proper ideals. We
say that the ideals I, J are relatively prime if for all r ∈R we have a ∈I, b ∈J so that
r = a + b.
Note that because I and J are ideals, we really only need to be able to obtain 1 = a+b,
where a ∈I, b ∈J.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
Consider how this works in Example 16.1. There 2 and 3 are relatively prime, and so we
get 1 = 2a + 3b. This is the GCD identity!
We can now state and prove a theorem generalizing Theorem 16.1:
Theorem 16.3 Let R be a commutative ring with unity, and suppose that I, J are relatively
prime proper ideals. Then R/(I ∩J) is isomorphic to the ring R/I × R/J.
Proof:
Consider the natural homomorphisms ν1, ν2 from R onto R/I and R/J. Deﬁne the
function µ : R →R/I × R/J by µ(t) = (ν1(t), ν2(t)); this is clearly a ring homomorphism.
We claim this homomorphism is surjective. For that purpose, choose an arbitrary
(I + r, J + s) ∈R/I × R/J.
Because the ideals are relatively prime, we can ﬁnd elements a ∈I, b ∈J for which a + b =
r −s. Then let x = r −a = b + s. Then
µ(x) = (I + r −a, J + b + s) = (I + r, J + s),
as claimed.
Now the kernel of this function is ker(ν1)∩ker(ν2) = I∩J. Therefore, by the Fundamental
Isomorphism Theorem 14.1 we have that R/(I ∩J) is isomorphic to R/I ×R/J, as we claim.
2
Notice that in Examples 16.1 and 16.2 (and also in the general theorem), we chose ideals
whose intersection is zero, while in the general theorem we allow the intersection to be a
non-trivial ideal. Recall also that in the Chinese Remainder Theorem we need surjectivity
to obtain an isomorphism; we either had to use the GCD identity in the constructive proof,
or else rely on the ﬁniteness of the rings. Here we obtain the surjectivity from the abstract
property of being relatively prime.
To provide a full generalization of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we should really
generalize Theorem 16.3 to the case where we have n ideals, rather than just two. You can
follow up on these ideas in Exercise 10.

174
Exercises
Example 16.4
Consider the ideals I = ⟨x −2⟩and J = ⟨x2⟩in Q[x]. Here a GCD of these two
polynomials is 1, and so clearly there exists a linear combination of them equalling 1;
that is, I and J are relatively prime. Note that I ∩J = ⟨(x −2)x2⟩. We of course know
that Q[x]/I is isomorphic to the ﬁeld of rational numbers. By Exercise 14.12, we know
that Q[x]/J is isomorphic to the ring of matrices
M =

.
We can thus conclude by Theorem 15.3 that Q[x]/(I ∩J) is isomorphic to Q × M.
Historical Remarks
Sun Tsu’s problem was phrased in this way: “We have things of which we do not know
the number. If we count them by threes, the remainder is 2; if we count them by ﬁves,
the remainder is 3; if we count them by sevens, the remainder is 2. How many things are
there?” This is clearly an example of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which you will solve
in Warmup Exercise e below. Because this is the only such problem treated by him, it is
unclear whether he had available a general method of solving a system of linear congruences.
However, in the 13th-century, another Chinese mathematician named Qin Jiushao published
a mathematical text that includes a number of examples of such problems. These examples
provide in essence our algorithmic proof of the Chinese Remainder Theorem. In particular,
to solve such congruences as [ximi] = [1], he uses a version of Euclid’s Algorithm, where
operations are carried out on a counting board. This medieval Chinese mathematics is much
more sophisticated than anything happening in Europe at the same time.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we proved that any ring of the form Zm is isomorphic to a direct product
of rings of the form Zpk, where p is prime. In its number-theoretic guise, this is known as
the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

2. Repeat Exercise 1 for the ring Z30. (First of all you must determine the direct product
to which it is isomorphic.)

7. One can solve a problem like Exercises 5 or 6 algorithmically, without remembering
the constructive proof as in Example 16.3. For example, in Exercise 5 one could rewrite
the ﬁrst congruence as x = 4k + 1, for some integer k, and put that into the second
congruence, and continue from there. Try this approach.
8. Find a, b ∈Z so that there is no simultaneous solution to
x ≡a(mod 6) and x ≡b(mod 4).
Why does this not contradict the Chinese Remainder Theorem?
9. The rings Z9 and Z3 × Z3 both have nine elements; indeed, a careless reading of
Theorem 16.1 might lead one to suppose that these rings are isomorphic. Show that
this is false.
10. In the text we formulate and prove Theorem 16.3 which gives criteria for which a
commutative ring with unity is isomorphic to R/I × R/J for two proper ideals I, J.
Generalize this to the case of ﬁnitely many ideals I1, I2, . . . In.
11. From the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we know that if m is an integer which has no
repeated primes in its prime factorization, then Zm is isomorphic to a direct product
of domains. Here is a generalization you can prove: A commutative ring R with unity
is isomorphic to a direct product of ﬁnitely many integral domains if and only if it has
a ﬁnite collection of prime ideals {Pi} whose intersection is zero, and for each r ∈R,
there exist ri ∈∩{Pj : j ̸= i} for which r = Σri.

Section III in a Nutshell
This section considers functions from one ring R to another ring S that preserve certain
algebraic properties: Consider ϕ : R →S such that
ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b)
and
ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b),
for all a, b ∈R. We call ϕ a ring homomorphism.
A ring homomorphism always preserves the zero of the ring, additive inverses, unity,
and multiplicative inverses (Theorem 11.1). While a ring homomorphism ϕ : R →S need
not be onto, it is onto the image of R in S (ϕ(R)) which is itself a subring of S (Theorem
11.2).
The kernel of ϕ is deﬁned by
ker(ϕ) = ϕ−1(0) = {r ∈R : ϕ(r) = 0}.
The kernel is always an ideal of R (Theorem 12.1). Furthermore, if s ∈ϕ(R) ⊆S, then
ϕ−1(s) is the coset ker(ϕ) + r, for any r ∈ϕ−1(s). ker(ϕ) = 0 if and only if ϕ is one-to-one
(Theorem 12.4).
The cosets of any ideal I of R partitions R into pairwise disjoint sets (Theorem 13.1).
The set of cosets R/I is itself a ring (Theorem 13.2), called the ring of cosets or the quotient
ring of R mod I. There is a natural homomorphism from R onto R/I given by
ν(a) = I + a.
The kernel of ν is I (Theorem 13.3).
Recall from Chapter 7 that if ϕ : R →S is a one-to-one onto homomorphism, we call
ϕ an isomorphism; in this case we say the R and S are isomorphic. The Fundamental
Isomorphism Theorem (Theorem 14.1) states that if ϕ : R →S is an onto homomorphism
and ν : R →R/ker(ϕ) is the natural homomorphism, then R/ker(ϕ) is isomorphic to
S. Furthermore, if we deﬁne µ : R/ker(ϕ) →S by µ(ker(ϕ) + r) = ϕ(r), then µ is an
isomorphism and µ ◦ν = ϕ. The essential content of this important theorem is that the
output of a ring homomorphism can be obtained by forming the ring of cosets of the
appropriate ideal. Chapter 14 gives many examples of this theorem.
An ideal I of R is maximal if the only ideal of R properly containing I is R itself. An
ideal I is maximal if and only if R/I is a ﬁeld (Theorem 15.2).
An ideal I of R is prime if whenever ab ∈I then either a ∈I or b ∈I. An ideal I is
prime if and only if R/I is a domain (Theorem 15.3). It follows that every maximal ideal is
a prime ideal, since every ﬁeld is a domain.
Finally, the section closes with a chapter on the famous Chinese Remainder Theorem.
This theorem asserts that any ring Zm is isomorphic to a direct product of rings of the form
Zpk, where pk is the largest power of the prime p which divides m. This can be rephrased as
an assertion that any ﬁnite set of congruences modulo integers of the form pk, for distinct
primes p has a common solution. The theorem can also be placed in a more abstract context
using the idea of relatively prime ideals.

Symmetries of Geometric Figures
Many geometric objects possess a large amount of symmetry. Roughly speaking, this means
that a change of the viewer’s perspective does not change what is seen. Equivalently, we
can move the object instead. In this case we want to consider motions of the object that
leave it apparently unchanged.
17.1
Symmetries of the Equilateral Triangle
For example, consider an equilateral triangle with vertices labelled 1, 2, and 3:
1
2
3
Notice that a counterclockwise rotation through 120◦moves vertex 1 to the location
vertex 2 has just vacated, and moves vertex 2 to location 3, and vertex 3 to location 1.
We shall denote this rotation by ρ. Notice that if we ignore the labels of the vertices, after
applying ρ the triangle is in the same position as it was before the motion. Note that if
we apply ρ twice, that is, we rotate the triangle through 240◦, the triangle again appears
unchanged. We shall denote this rotation by ρρ, or ρ2 for short.
Perhaps we need a more precise deﬁnition: A rigid motion of the plane is a bijection
from the plane onto itself that preserves distance. We call these rigid motions because they
can be realized by moving the plane in three-dimensional space. If S is a subset of the plane
(that is, a ﬁgure in the plane like our equilateral triangle), a symmetry of S is a rigid
motion of the plane that takes S onto itself.
So, when we talk of a rotation of the equilateral triangle, we can just as well think of
rotating the entire plane. Thus, ρ and ρ2 are symmetries of the triangle.
Are there any other symmetries of the triangle? First of all, there is certainly the identity:
The bijection that takes each point to itself; this function clearly preserves distance. This
corresponds to no motion at all, and we will denote it by ι.
But are there any more interesting symmetries? Yes! Consider the reﬂection through
the line ℓ1 which assigns to each point P the point P ′ which is the same perpendicular
distance from ℓ1 but on the other side. (If P is actually on the line, it is sent to itself.)

We could think of this as rotating the plane on axis ℓ1 through 180◦. (Notice this motion

happens in three-dimensional space.) This rigid motion takes the triangle onto itself, and
so is a symmetry of the triangle that we will call ϕ (for ﬂip).
Now, obviously one symmetry followed by another is still a symmetry; note that ‘followed
by’ here means functional composition, if we think of these rigid motions as functions from
the plane onto itself.
So we have
ρ, ρ2, ρ3 = no motion at all = ι.
ϕ, ϕ2 = ι
in our list of symmetries of the triangle. But we also have ρϕ (where we mean by this
juxtaposition the composition of these two functions, ﬁrst ϕ and then ρ).

Similarly, ϕρ looks like a reﬂection about the line ℓ3:

Verify that ϕρ is indeed equivalent to the reﬂection about the line
ℓ3. 
Note that the order in which these compositions are done makes a big diﬀerence! These
six turn out to be a list of all the symmetries of the equilateral triangle (we’ll prove this
later).
We can now obtain a multiplication table of these symmetries as follows. The entry in
the α row and β column consists of the composition αβ:

Try generating the remainder of this multiplication table yourself,
thinking geometrically about composing movements of the triangle. 
Notice that this ‘multiplication’ obeys the associative law because it is simply the compo-
sition of functions, which is associative. Note also that there seems to be a block substructure
to this table. Namely, if we denote the three rotations by R and the three ﬂips by F, we
have

Permutation Notation
Now, how do we know that this comprises the complete list of the symmetries of the equi-
lateral triangle?
To answer this question, we make the following observation: If we specify where each of
the vertices goes, then we have determined the symmetry. We introduce some notation here,
to describe what a symmetry does to the vertices of the triangle. For example, to describe
ρ, we put beneath the integers 1, 2, and 3 the names of the vertex locations they’re taken
to. Thus, we should put 2 under 1 to indicate that the counterclockwise rotation of ρ takes
vertex 1 to the location vertex 2 has just vacated. This is an example of a general notation
for permutations, which we will study further in the next chapter. Thus, the permutation
of the vertices 1, 2, 3 accomplished by the rotation ρ is just
 1
2
3
2
3
1

.
This then means that the vertex in location 1 is moved to location 2, and likewise for the
other two columns.
This latter notation gives us a function from {1, 2, 3} onto {1, 2, 3}. For example,
 1
2
3

(2) = 3.
Explicitly, we have the following correspondence between symmetries of the triangle and
permutations of their vertex locations:

Now, there are only six ways to rearrange the list 1, 2, 3: We have three choices for
the ﬁrst element in the list, two remaining choices for the second element, and only one
remaining choice for the third element, making 3 · 2 · 1 = 3! = 6 altogether. So we have the
complete list of the symmetries of the triangle.
We call the set of these six symmetries the group of symmetries of the equilateral
triangle; the table above is called its group table or multiplication table. The group
of symmetries of the equilateral triangle is sometimes called the 3rd dihedral group and
denoted D3. In general, the group of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon is called the
nth dihedral group and is denoted Dn. In the future, we will call these groups either
dihedral groups or the groups of symmetries of appropriate regular polygons. In Exercise 8,
you will show that Dn has 2n elements.
From the group table, we know that the composition of symmetries ρ(ϕρ) gives us the
symmetry ϕ. But consider the two corresponding permutations of the vertices:
ρ =
 1

3
2
3
1

and
ϕρ =
 1
2
3
1
3
2

.
These are both functions, which can be composed together. Let’s see what ρ(ϕρ) does to
vertex 1. First, the symmetry ϕρ sends 1 to 1, then ρ sends 1 to 2. Thus, the composition
function sends 1 to 2.

(Remember, this composition is done right-to-left.) This is of course exactly the permutation
describing what the corresponding symmetry ϕ does to the vertex locations! Thus, ρ(ϕρ) =
ϕ.

Matrix Notation
If you’ve had a bit of linear algebra, we can describe the symmetries of the equilateral
triangle using matrix notation. Let’s now look again at the rigid motions of the plane we’ve
used in describing the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. Remember a rigid motion of
the plane is really a bijection from the plane onto the plane, which preserves distance.
Now the plane can be considered algebraically as the set R2 of all ordered pairs of real
numbers. We denote this by writing P(x, y) for the point P in the plane with coordinates
(x, y).
How then can we represent rotation (about the origin, say) through angle θ? To answer

Chapter 17: Symmetries of Geometric Figures
185
this, suppose that P(x, y) is rotated through angle θ to point P ′(x′, y′). If we represent P
by the polar coordinates (r, ϕ) then
x = r cos ϕ
and
y = r sin ϕ,
and so
x′ = r cos(θ + ϕ)
and
y′ = r sin(θ + ϕ).
By using the trigonometric sum formulas, we obtain
x′
=
r cos ϕ cos θ −r sin ϕ sin θ = x cos θ −y sin θ
y′
=
r cos ϕ sin θ + r sin ϕ cos θ = x sin θ + y cos θ.
These two equations describe the transformation P(x, y) →P ′(x′, y′), which is the rotation
through the angle θ about the origin.
O

P ′(x′, y′)
P(x, y)

A particularly nice way to look at this transformation is as a matrix multiplication.
Consider the 2 × 2 matrix
R =
 cos θ
−sin θ
sin θ
cos θ

and the 2×1 arrays P =

x
y

and P ′ =
 x′
y′

. Then we have that RP = P ′. Note that
we think of P and P ′ as columns in order to make this matrix multiplication work. Thus,
we can represent rotation of the plane by means of a matrix multiplication. (See Exercise
6.7.)
What about the reﬂection through lines? Consider the matrix
F =
 −1
0
0
1

.
Note that FP =
 −x
y

, and so we see that multiplication by F exactly describes reﬂection
of the plane through the y-axis.
So now consider the equilateral triangle centered about the origin (0, 0), so that vertex
1 is (−
√
3
2 , −1
2), vertex 2 is (
√
3
2 , −1
2), and vertex 3 is (0, 1). (Note that the vertices of this
triangle are all distance 1 from the origin.) We can then explicitly describe the symme-
tries ρ and ϕ by multiplication by R and F, respectively. We then obtain the following
correspondence between symmetries and matrices:

Note the interconnection among the composition of symmetries, the composition of permu-

corresponding to the composition of two symmetries is exactly the product of the matrices
corresponding to those symmetries.
 Quick Exercise.
Pick a couple of symmetries and verify that the product of the sym-
metries has as its corresponding matrix exactly the product of the corresponding matrices
of the original symmetries.

(We will explore this correspondence more carefully later.)

Symmetries of the Square
Let’s now examine the symmetries of the square. We consider the square pictured below,
with vertices at
(−1, −1),
(1, −1),
(1, 1),
(−1, 1).
(Call these vertices 1, 2, 3, and 4.)
1
2

Because vertices must be moved to vertices, there can be no more than 4! = 24 symme-
tries of the square. However, consider the permutation of the vertex locations

There is no way to move the square in this way, because vertex 1 (wherever it is moved)
must stay adjacent to vertices 2 and 4. Let’s count how many such permutations are possible.
We can move vertex 1 to any of four places. But because vertex 2 must be adjacent, this
means that there remain only two possibilities for 2. And once we’ve established where the
1-2 edge goes, the entire square’s motion is accounted for. This means there are at most 8
symmetries of the square. In Exercise 1, you will ﬁnd all 8, and analyze them as we have
analyzed the symmetries of the equilateral triangle. As mentioned before, we denote the
group of the symmetries of the square by D4, the 4th dihedral group.
17.5
Symmetries of Figures in Space
We’d now like to turn to symmetries of three-dimensional objects, in particular of the
regular tetrahedron. By way of analogy with plane ﬁgures, it should be clear that we should
be concerned with rigid motions of three-dimensional space (R3) taking the given object
onto itself. However, we should make clear what is meant by a rigid motion of R3. We
mean more than just a bijective distance-preserving function. Consider R3 equipped with
a coordinate system with the usual right-hand rule orientation as depicted below (where
⃗i ×⃗j = ⃗k):
⃗k
⃗j
⃗i
The function β : R3 →R3 deﬁned by β(x, y, z) = (x, −y, z) (that is, reﬂection through
the xz-plane) is a bijective distance-preserving function that cannot be accomplished by
moving R3 in
R3. We can see this because it changes the set of vectors ⃗i,⃗j,⃗k, which has
right-handed orientation, into the set ⃗i, −⃗j,⃗k, which has left-handed orientation.
The pertinent comparison is to the reﬂection (x, y) 7→(x, −y) in the plane, which can’t
be accomplished in the plane. It is an accident of physics that we inhabit three-dimensional
space. Hence, we are happy with reﬂections through a line in the plane, because they can
be accomplished in three-dimensional space. We are not so happy with reﬂections through
a plane in space (even though it turns out they can be accomplished as a motion in four
dimensions). The key here is to restrict ourselves to bijective distance-preserving functions
that preserve the right-handed orientation of our coordinate system; we call such functions
rigid motions of space. (This should jibe with your intuition of rigid motion.) This
deﬁnition of symmetry is quite restrictive because it excludes functions like β, which can be
realized as mirror reﬂections. Many people would call such functions symmetries too, but
we will not do so here.

Symmetries of the Regular Tetrahedron
We’re now ready to determine the group of symmetries of a regular tetrahedron. Because
it has four vertices, there are no more than 4! = 24 such symmetries.
1

Let’s ﬁrst consider symmetries leaving one vertex (say, number 1) ﬁxed. We have the
rotations
ρ1 7−→

where, of course, ρ3

But consider another permutation of the vertices leaving number 1 ﬁxed, say,
 1
2
3
4
1
4

2

.
This corresponds to a reﬂection through a plane.
 Quick Exercise.
What plane? 
But this can’t be accomplished with a rigid motion! To see this, paint the exterior of face
234 white and the interior of face 234 red. Now apply the above permutation. Clearly,
for this to be a symmetry of the regular tetrahedron, a face must be mapped to another
face. Here, because vertex 1 is ﬁxed, face 234 is clearly mapped to itself. But after the
permutation, what color are the exterior and interior of face 234? They’ve switched colors!
This permutation has caused the tetrahedron to turn ‘inside itself’. This doesn’t jibe with
our intuition of rigid motion. Indeed, this is the sort of thing that happens when a distance-
preserving permutation is applied that changes the right-handed orientation.
To see this change in orientation another way, place vectors ⃗i and ⃗j in the plane of the
face 234, with ⃗j parallel to the edge 24. Then the vector cross product ⃗i ×⃗j points toward
the tetrahedron. Suppose ⃗i′ and ⃗j′ are the images of ⃗i and ⃗j, respectively. Note that ⃗i′ ×⃗j′
now points away from the tetrahedron. That is, the side of the face that was formerly in
the interior of the tetrahedron is now on the exterior.

we have banned 6.
 Quick Exercise.
For each ﬁxed vertex, we found 3 permutations that are not allowed.
There are 4 vertices, so why are there only 6 banned permutations and not 12? 
What about the 24 −15 = 9 permutations that leave no vertex ﬁxed? How many of
these lead to symmetries? Let’s try to consider a typical one. We may suppose without loss
of generality that vertex 1 is sent to vertex 2. So, the permutation looks like this:
 1
2

If 2 7→1, then (because we’ve assumed that it ﬁxes no vertex) it must look like this:

This is a symmetry! Just let ℓbe the line connecting the midpoints of the segments 12 and
34, respectively. Then this symmetry can be accomplished by rotating 180◦about the line
ℓ.

because we have no ﬁxed points, we must have
 1

We claim this can’t be accomplished by a rigid motion of R3. Why? Once again, this
motion would not preserve the orientation of our coordinate system. Consider any face of
the tetrahedron. Note that the permutation will ﬂip this face around—the exterior side
becomes the interior side. This cannot be accomplished by a rigid motion.

Chapter 18
Permutations
In the previous chapter we used the idea that a symmetry of a geometric object like a
triangle or tetrahedron must take vertices to vertices. For example, specifying where the
vertices of a tetrahedron are sent completely determines the symmetry function. We used
this reasoning to determine a complete list of symmetries of the tetrahedron. We called
a speciﬁcation of how the vertices are moved a permutation of the vertices. We found
that using permutation notation was one way to compute the composition of symmetries
of the tetrahedron (or some other geometric ﬁgure). We will now consider the notion of
permutations in an abstract setting. This will provide us with a great source for examples
and computational techniques when we move to abstract groups in the next chapter.
18.1
Permutations
Consider the list 1, 2, 3, 4, · · · , n of the ﬁrst n positive integers. We wish to rearrange or
permute this list. To do this, we must tell ourselves which slot the integer 1 should be
placed in, which slot the integer 2 should be placed in, and so forth. What this means is
that a permutation of this list amounts to a function
α : {1, 2, 3, · · · , n} →{1, 2, 3, · · · , n}
that is bijective. It is one-to-one, because no two integers can be placed in the same slot.
It is onto, because each slot must be ﬁlled. Formally then, a permutation of the set
{1, 2, 3, · · · , n} is a bijection from this set to itself.
 Quick Exercise.
Recall that if a function from ﬁnite set to itself is injective, it is
automatically surjective. What is the explanation for this? Give an example to show that
this is false in the inﬁnite case. (You might want to consult Section 16.1, where we discuss
the pigeonhole principle. 
As we did in Chapter 17, we can denote such functions by a 2 × n array: The top row
tells the names of the elements of the set {1, 2, · · · , n}, and the bottom row records the slots
to which they are sent. Thus,
 1

is a permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, which does not move 4 or 2, sends 1 to 3, 3 to
5, and 5 to 1. We could use functional notation to express the above facts. For instance,
sending 1 to 3 could be written as
 1

(1) = 3.
We denote the set of all permutations on the set {1, 2, · · · n} by Sn. This set has n!
197

elements because for 1 there are n slots available, for 2 there are n −1 slots available
(because 1 has taken one of them), for 3 there are n −2 slots available, and so on. This
gives us
n(n −1)(n −2) · · · (3)(2)(1) = n!
possibilities altogether.
18.2
The Symmetric Groups
Since two elements α, β ∈Sn are functions with the same domain and range, we can
combine them together with functional composition. We denote that operation by ◦, or by
juxtaposition, writing either α◦β or αβ. Note that composition of two elements of Sn gives
another element of the set: The composition is still a bijection.
 Quick Exercise.
Prove this. 
As we observed in Chapter 17, functional composition is an associative operation, and
so we can write down a string of compositions like αβγ without inserting any unnecessary
parentheses.
A trivial but important example of a permutation is the identity function ι, where
ι(k) = k, for k = 1, 2, · · · , n. We would write this as
ι =
 1
2
3
· · ·
n
1
2

· · ·


,
using our matrix notation. Note that if α is any element of Sn and 1 ≤k ≤n, then
ι ◦α(k) = ι(α(k)) = α(k),
and so ι ◦α = α.
 Quick Exercise.
Write down the corresponding proof for α ◦ι. 
From our discussion of bijections in Section 7.3, it follows that for α ∈Sn, there exists
a unique inverse function α−1:
α−1(n) = m is true exactly if α(m) = n.
This is exactly the function that composes with α to give the identity function ι. Informally,
the existence of α−1 means that we can ‘un-do’ any rearrangement of our list.
We call the set Sn the symmetric group on n. We will also call it a group of per-
mutations. Notice that although for convenience’s sake we think of Sn as permutations of
the set {1, 2, · · · , n}, it really doesn’t matter what ﬁnite set of objects we’re permuting (as
long as they are distinguishable). This is essentially what we did in Chapter 17, where we
were really permuting vertices of geometric ﬁgures, rather than the integer labels.
Let’s look at some particular computations in Sn:

encountered in Chapter 17. Order matters when composing permutations.
 Quick Exercise.
Choose two elements at random from S6 and compute their products
in both orders. It is highly likely that your answers will not be the same. 
We now have a nice way of thinking of our symmetry calculations in Chapter 17. While
the symmetries, thought of geometrically, are quite concrete, they are rather diﬃcult to
compute with (especially if we don’t have a cube or tetrahedron around to handle!). But
representing them as permutations, while more abstract, provide us with a really easy
way to compute explicitly. We also represented some of our symmetries using matrices,
because multiplying matrices is also computationally straightforward; this approach is also
important, and we will explore these ideas more later.
We ﬁrst make a few notational remarks about the symmetry groups Sn. Note that if
m < n, we can think of Sm as a subset of Sn because any permutation of {1, 2, · · · , m} can
be thought of as a permutation of the larger set {1, 2, · · · , n}, which leaves the elements
m+1, m+2, · · · , n ﬁxed. Consequently, in what follows we will not bother to be too speciﬁc
about which symmetric group a given permutation belongs to.
Although we combine elements of Sn together by means of functional composition, we
will for the most part in this (and future chapters) speak less formally about this operation;
since we will often use juxtaposition to indicate composition, we will tend to speak of the
product of two permutations, rather than their composition.

Cycles
While the composition of two permutations using the double row notation above is straight-
forward, it does seem a bit cumbersome and awkward to use. Our immediate goal is to
introduce a much more eﬃcient way of describing permutations; this notation will depend
on some important facts about permutations that we will now explore.
Consider ﬁrst the permutation
α =
 1
2

.
It permutes the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4 cyclically, as the following picture suggests:

In general a permutation α ∈Sn is a cycle of length k, if there exist integers
a1, a2, · · · , ak so that
α(a1) = a2, α(a2) = a3, · · · , α(ak−1) = ak, α(ak) = a1,
and α leaves ﬁxed the remaining n −k elements in its domain. We will denote this cycle by
the notation
(a1a2a3 · · · ak).
Example 18.3
Consider the cycle (125). It is short-hand for the permutation
 1

.
Notice that we could just as well have represented this cycle by (251) or (512). It is
clear that (125) represents an element in S5, at least. But in a particular situation, we
might use the same notation to denote the corresponding element

which in this case is (152).

While it behaves as a cycle on the set {1, 2, 5}, it also behaves cyclically on the set {3, 4}.
What this really means is that we can factor β as a composition of two cycles:
β = (125)(34) = (34)(125).
 Quick Exercise.
Convince yourself that β really equals the composition of the two-
cycle permutations (125) and (34), composed in either order. What is the inverse of β? 
18.4
Cycle Factorization of Permutations
This suggests that perhaps we could factor any permutation into a product of cycles. To
describe this, we need some terminology. The support of a permutation α is the set of
all integers k so that α(k) ̸= k. Speaking more colloquially, the support of a permutation
is the set of elements in its domain that it moves. We use the notation Supp(α) for this
set, which is always a subset of {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. We have that Supp((125)) = {1, 2, 5}, while
Supp(ι) = ∅, the empty set.
 Quick Exercise.
What is Supp((125)(34))? Give an element in S7 whose support is
{2, 5, 6}.

Now if α(k) = k, then k is not in the support of α; we say that α ﬁxes k. The set of all
elements that an element ﬁxes is its ﬁxed set, which we denote by Fix(α).
Example 18.4
Consider the permutation (3251) ∈S5. What is its support? What is its ﬁxed set? In
general, what can you say about Supp(α) ∩Fix(α) and Supp(α) ∪Fix(α)?
Let’s make a technical observation about the support of a permutation, which we will
repeatedly ﬁnd of use in the arguments which follow.
Lemma 18.1 Suppose that α is a permutation, and k ∈Supp(α). Then α(k) ∈Supp(α).
Proof:
Because k is in the support of α, α(k) ̸= k. Now apply the function α to these
two distinct integers. Because α is injective, we must get distinct integers:
α(α(k)) ̸= α(k).
But this means exactly that α(k) is in the support of α.
2
Two permutations are disjoint if their supports contain no element in common; using
our notation, permutations α and β are disjoint exactly if Supp(α) ∩Supp(β) = ∅. In a
previous Quick Exercise it was the disjointness of (125) and (34) that allowed them to
commute. Let’s prove this in general:
Theorem 18.2 Suppose that α and β are disjoint permutations. Then
αβ = βα.

202
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Proof:
Suppose that α and β are disjoint. We must show that the two functions αβ and
βα are the same: So we show they do the same thing to typical elements of their domain.
If we choose an integer k belonging to neither Supp(α) nor Supp(β), then clearly
αβ(k) = α(k) = k = β(k) = βα(k).
Any other integer belongs to the support of exactly one of α and β, because they are
disjoint. Without loss of generality, let’s suppose that integer k ∈Supp(α), but k /∈Supp(β).
Now by the previous lemma, α(k) also belongs to the support of α, and hence not to that
of β. Thus, we have
αβ(k) = α(k)
and
βα(k) = α(k).
Hence, the two functions αβ and βα are the same, as claimed.
2
We’re now ready to state and prove the factorization theorem for permutations. Note
that this theorem is very similar in ﬂavor to the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic 2.8
and 2.9: It asserts that every permutation can be factored uniquely into simpler pieces (cy-
cles), just as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic asserts that integers can be factored
uniquely into simpler pieces (primes).
Theorem 18.3
Cycle Factorization Theorem for Permutations
Every non-
identity permutation is either a cycle or can be uniquely factored (up to order) as a product
of pairwise disjoint cycles.
Proof:
We ﬁrst prove the existence of the required factorization by using induction on
the size of the support of the permutation. Note ﬁrst that if the size of the support is
zero, the permutation moves no element, and is consequently the identity permutation. No
permutation can have exactly one element in its support.
 Quick Exercise.
Why can no permutation have exactly one element in its support? 
Thus, the base case for the induction is support size two. Suppose that the support of
permutation α has two elements. If k is an element of this support, by Lemma 18.1 α(k)
must be the other element in the support. But α(k) ̸= α2(k), and so the only choice is that
α2(k) = k. That is, α must be a cycle of length two.
Now suppose that α is a permutation with n elements in its support. Our induction
hypothesis says that all non-identity permutations with support size less than n are either
cycles, or products of disjoint cycles. Pick a1 ∈Supp(α). Then
a1, a2 = α(a1), a3 = α(a2), · · ·
are all elements of the support. Because the support is ﬁnite, sooner or later we will have
a duplication in this list. Suppose the ﬁrst duplication in the list occurs at ak+1 = α(ak).
Then because α is injective, the only duplication possible is if α(ak) = a1 (any other
duplication would give diﬀerent elements with the same α value). Now consider the cycle
β = (a1a2a3 · · · ak). If k = n, then α = β, which is a cycle, as required. Otherwise, consider
the element β−1α. This function equals α on any integer other than a1, a2, · · · , ak, but does
not move the ai’s. Thus, the support of β−1α is disjoint from {a1, a2, · · · , ak} and has n −k
elements, which is fewer than n. Consequently, by the induction hypothesis, we can factor
β−1α as a product of disjoint cycles. Then α is the product of these cycles, times β. This
completes the proof, by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

Chapter 18: Permutations
203
It remains to prove that the factorization we have obtained is unique. This is a similar
induction proof, left as Exercise 18.2.
2
Henceforth, when we compute with permutations, we will invariably use the disjoint
cycle representation guaranteed by this theorem.
Example 18.5
Suppose that
α = (154)(23)(689)
and
β = (14895)(27)
are two permutations, written as products of disjoint cycles. Let’s compute the product
αβ. This is an entirely straightforward matter, if we remember that the operation here
is functional composition, and so we operate from right to left. Start with any element
of the domain (say, 1):
αβ(1) = α(4) = 1.
Thus, the product ﬁxes 1. Let’s try 2:
αβ(2)
=
α(7) = 7;
αβ(7)
=
α(2) = 3;
αβ(3)
=
α(3) = 2.
Thus, (273) is one of the cycle factors of the product αβ. We leave it to you to complete
the computation to obtain:
αβ = (273)(49)(68).
 Quick Exercise.
Complete this computation. Then compute βα and β2α−1 in
the same way. 
Once a permutation has been factored as a product of disjoint cycles, we call the set of
elements moved by each of its constituent cycle factors its orbits. Thus, the permutation
(157)(2389)
has orbits {1, 5, 7} and {2, 3, 8, 9}. In addition, it has the trivial orbits {4} and {6}. We
therefore have that every element of the domain of the permutation belongs to exactly one
orbit, and the other elements of the orbit it belongs to are exactly the locations we can move
the element to, by repeatedly applying the permutation. Given α ∈Sn and 1 ≤k ≤n, we
will then let Orb(k) be the orbit of α that contains k. Formally, we can say that
Orb(k) = {k, α(k), α2(k), α3(k), . . .}.
Note that this is of course a ﬁnite set, because the list of elements eventually starts to
repeat, as we have seen in the proof of Theorem 18.3 above.
 Quick Exercise.
Give examples in S7 of an element with one orbit of seven elements
and also an element with 3 orbits: one orbit of 4 elements, one orbit of 2 elements, and a
trivial orbit. 
Let’s now look carefully at the disjoint cycle and orbit structure for the elements of
S3. The identity of course has three orbits {1}, {2}, {3}. We then also have three 2-cycles
(12), (13), (23), each of which has two orbits, one with two elements and the other with one
element. And ﬁnally, we have two 3-cycles (123), (132), each of which has one orbit, which
consists of the entire set {1, 2, 3}. Since 3 is so small, all non-identity elements of S3 are
cycles.
If we interpret these 6 permutations as permutations of the vertices of an equilateral

204
Exercises
triangle, we then see that the diﬀerent cycle structures have geometric meaning. The 2-
cycles are exactly the ﬂips across a line, while the 3-cycles are the two rotations through
120◦and 240◦.
Consider now S4. As before, we have the identity as a special case. We have 6 distinct
2-cycles, each of which has 3 orbits:
(12), (13), (14), (23), (24), (34).
We have 8 distinct 3-cycles in S4, each of which has 2 orbits:
(123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143), (234), (243).
We have 6 distinct 4-cycles, each of which has 1 orbit:
(1234), (1243), (1324), (1342), (1423), (1432).
But what is diﬀerent in S4 is that we have some elements that are not cycles. There are
3 of these, each with 2 orbits, each with 2 elements:
(12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
Notice that we have accounted for all 24 elements of S4.
If we interpret our elements of S4 as permutations of the vertices of the tetra-
hedron (as in Section 17.6), we have the following geometric interpretations. The 2-
cycles cannot be accomplished by a rigid motion of three dimensional space. The
3-cycles amount to rotations about a line through one of the vertices and the
centroid of the opposite triangle. The elements which are products of two dis-
joint 2-cycles are the 180◦rotations about the line through the midpoints of two
of
the
edges.
And
the
4-cycles
cannot
be
accomplished
by
a
rigid
motion
of
three dimensional space. This leaves us with the 12 symmetries of the tetrahedron.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we considered the symmetric group Sn, which consists of all permutations of
the ﬁrst n positive integers; there are n! elements of Sn. We introduced an eﬃcient notation
for such permutations, which depends on the theorem that any permutation can be factored
as a product of disjoint cycles.

Chapter 19
Abstract Groups
In this chapter we intend to generalize the examples of the previous two chapters, to obtain
an abstract notion of group, quite similar in ﬂavor to our abstract deﬁnition of ring in Chap-
ter 6. We have a set of objects (which up to now have been symmetries or permutations),
equipped with a binary operation (which up to now has been functional composition). What
abstract properties should this binary operation satisfy?
The composition of functions (whether symmetries or permutations) is associative, and
we will include this in our abstract deﬁnition.
Notice that we always included the identity function: As a symmetry, this consists of no
motion at all; as a permutation, this is again a function that moves nothing. When composed
with any other function, we then obtain the second function. This clearly seems similar to
our deﬁnitions of additive and multiplicative identities. We will include an identity element
in our abstract deﬁnition.
Any symmetry or permutation can be undone: For symmetries, there is a motion that
restores the object in question to its original orientation. For permutations, we can move
the elements of the set {1, 2, . . .} back where they came from. What does this mean in terms
of the group tables we constructed for the symmetries of the equilateral triangle, and the
tetrahedron? For example, in the group D3 of symmetries of the equilateral triangle, the
motion that undoes the rotation ρ is simply ρ2, and this fact is reﬂected in the group table
by the fact that
ρρ2 = ι
and
ρ2ρ = ι.
So, the existence of inverses is the third requirement of our deﬁnition.
 Quick Exercise.
Choose several elements in the groups of symmetries for the triangle

19.1
Deﬁnition of Group
We now state our deﬁnition formally. A group G is a set of elements on which one binary
operation (◦) is deﬁned that satisﬁes the following properties: (The symbols g, h, and k
represent any elements from G.)
(Rule 1) (g ◦h) ◦k = g ◦(h ◦k)
(Rule 2) There exists an element e in G such that
g ◦e = e ◦g = g
(Rule 3) For each element g in G there exists an element x so that
g ◦x = x ◦g = e
207

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
We introduce some terminology to describe these rules (which will seem familiar after
our experience with rings): Rule 1 says that the operation ◦is associative, Rule 2 says
that an identity exists, and Rule 3 says that each element of the group has an inverse.
We can thus paraphrase our deﬁnition by saying this: A group is a set with an associative
binary operation with an identity, where all elements have inverses.

eration ◦is functional composition. The operation (being functional composition) is
associative, and the identity is the symmetry consisting of no motion (the identity
function). The inverse of each element is also clearly a symmetry and consists geo-
metrically of ‘undoing’ the symmetry. Function-theoretically, it is exactly the inverse
function of the given symmetry.
Example 19.2
The symmetric groups Sn of permutations of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, where the operation
is functional composition. The discussion in Section 18.2 makes clear that this set
satisﬁes the three rules for groups.
Now let R be a ring, equipped with operations + and ·. Let’s forget the multiplication.
We claim that R equipped with + is a group. Obviously, + is associative (Rule 2 in the
deﬁnition of ring). Clearly, 0 plays the role of the identity for + (Rule 3 in the deﬁnition of
ring). And every element in a ring has an (additive) inverse, by Rule 4 in the deﬁnition of
a ring.
We have thus provided ourselves with an extremely large fund of group examples, because
we know about so many rings. It’s probably worthwhile listing a few of these explicitly, so
that you can better appreciate the ground covered by this observation.
Example 19.3
The integers Z, equipped with +.
Example 19.4
The integers modulo m (that is, Zm), equipped with +, as deﬁned in Chapter 3.
Example 19.5
The set M2(Z) of 2 × 2 matrices, with integer entries, equipped with matrix addition.

Chapter 19: Abstract Groups
209
Example 19.6
The Gaussian integers Z[i], under addition.
When we look at the additive structure of a ring, and consider it as a group, we call it
the additive group of a ring. If the only groups around occurred as the additive groups
of rings, the abstract concept of group would clearly be superﬂuous. But by Rule 1 from
the deﬁnition of ring, the binary operation addition for a ring is always commutative. That
is, it satisﬁes the rule
a + b = b + a.
Note that we do not include such a requirement on the abstract operation ◦in our deﬁnition
of group above, because we wish to include those groups in Example 19.1 and 19.2.
Thus, the notion of group is a genuine generalization of the notion of additive group of
a ring because it includes more structures. As a more general concept, we will in the next
chapters discuss quite a distinct algebraic theory regarding groups.
If a group satisﬁes the additional rule
Rule 4
a ◦b = b ◦a
we say that the group is abelian. That is, a group with a commutative operation is abelian.
The word ‘abelian’ honors the early 19th-century mathematician Abel, whom we mentioned
in Chapter 10. (Although ‘commutative group’ might seem a reasonable term to use, we
will follow long-standing practice and say ‘abelian’ instead.)
19.3
Multiplicative Groups
We need some more examples:
Example 19.7
The set Q∗of non-zero rational numbers, under multiplication, is a group. Multipli-
cation is clearly an associative operation, and its identity is 1. Note that every such
rational number has a (multiplicative) inverse: The multiplicative inverse of rational
number a/b (where a, b ̸= 0) is b/a.
Examples 19.3 through 19.6 might have led you to infer that we should invariably asso-
ciate ‘group operation’ with addition, rather than multiplication. This is certainly false, as
Example 19.7 and several examples below show.
We can generalize Example 19.7. Let F be any ﬁeld. Then let F ∗be the set of non-zero
elements of F. Equip this set with its usual multiplication. Then this is a group.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 

210
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 19.8
Let’s create this group for a particular ﬁeld. Consider the ﬁeld Z7. We are then claiming
that the set
Z∗
7 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
of residue classes modulo 7 forms a group under multiplication. Because Z7 is a ﬁeld,
we know that all these elements have (multiplicative) inverses, but let’s compute them
explicitly anyway: Because it is the identity, clearly the inverse of 1 is 1. Because
2 · 4 = 1, 2 and 4 are inverses of one another; because 3 · 5 = 1, 3 and 5 are inverses of
one another. And because 62 = 1, 6 is its own inverse.
 Quick Exercise.
Compute the inverses in the multiplicative group Z∗
11. 
We can generalize even further. Suppose that R is any ring with unity. In Chapter 8 we
deﬁned U(R), the set of those elements of R that are units; that is, U(R) is the set of those
elements of R that have multiplicative inverses. For a ﬁeld F, U(F) is just F ∗, its set of
non-zero elements.
But we claim that for any ring with unity, U(R) is a group under multiplication. Because
R has unity, the set U(R) evidently possesses an identity. And clearly (by deﬁnition) every
element of U(R) has a (multiplicative) inverse. There remains a subtle point to verify, before
we can claim that U(R) is a group: Is in fact U(R) closed under multiplication? That is, is
multiplication on U(R) a binary operation? The answer is yes, and we proved exactly this
in Chapter 8.
 Quick Exercise.
Carefully re-read this proof in Section 8.2. 
We will consequently call U(R) the group of units for the ring (with unity) R.
 Quick Exercise.
Why are we restricting ourselves to rings with unity? 
Thus, each ring with unity has associated with it two groups: its additive group, and its
group of units. Let’s look concretely at a few groups of units:
Example 19.9
The set U(Z6) = {1, 5} is a group under multiplication. The multiplicative inverse of
5 is itself.
Example 19.10
Consider the group of units of the Gaussian integers:
U(Z[i]) = {1, −1, i, −i}.
Note that −1 is its own inverse and i and −i are inverses of each other.

Chapter 19: Abstract Groups
211
Example 19.11
Consider the sets U(M2(Z)) and U(M2(R)); they are both groups, where the oper-
ation is matrix multiplication. Recall that the units of M2(Z) and M2(R) are those
matrices with non-zero determinant. (See Exercise 8.2.) Both groups have inﬁnitely
many elements. For example,
 3
1
5
2

and
 3
4
4
5

are both elements of U(M2(Z)).
 Quick Exercise.
What are their inverses? 
 Quick Exercise.
Show that U(M2(Z)) is a non-abelian group. (The examples
we’ve just given will do!) 
Example 19.12
Consider U(Z[
√
2]). In Exercise 8.6 we computed inﬁnitely many elements of this
multiplicative group. Depending on how you solved this exercise, you might have even
obtained the complete list of all elements of this group; it is a bit diﬃcult to prove
that such a list is complete, however.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that 7 + 5
√
2 is an element of this group. (That is, com-
pute its inverse.) 
We can have multiplicative groups living inside previously studied rings, which do not
consist of the entire group of units. For a couple of such examples, consider the following.
Example 19.13
Let’s work inside the ﬁeld Z13. Take the element 4. We now compute the (multiplica-
tive) powers of this element; to make our computations clear, we will this time make
explicit use of modular notation:
[4]1 = [4],
[4]2 = [16] = [3],
[4]3 = [4][3] = [12],
[4]4 = [4][12] = [48] = [9],
[4]5 = [4][9] = [10],
[4]6 = [4][10] = [40] = [1].
We have stopped here, because if we continue, we will repeat elements we have already
obtained. We now claim that
{[1], [4], [3], [12], [9], [10]} =
{[1], [4]1, [4]2, [4]3, [4]4, [4]5}
is a group under multiplication. You can check this by brute force, but the fact that
all elements are powers of [4], and that [4]6 = [1], means that computation of products
and inverses is easy! For example,
[4]3[4]4 = [4]7 = [4]6[4] = [4].
And what’s the inverse of [4]2? We claim it is [4]6−2; the computation
[4]2[4]4 = [4]6 = [1]
makes this evident. We will return to this example (and generalizations) in Chapter
21.

212
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 19.14
Let’s work inside the ﬁeld C. Consider the set of all complex numbers of modulus 1.
We call this set S:
S = {α ∈C : |α| = 1} = {a + bi ∈C : a2 + b2 = 1}.
Considered within the complex plane, this consists of exactly the points on the circle
centered at the origin, of radius one. (You should certainly review our discussion of
complex numbers in Chapter 8, if necessary.) We consequently call S the unit circle.
We claim that S is a group under complex multiplication. This set is certainly closed
under multiplication because by Theorem 8.3
|αβ| = |α||β| = 1 · 1 = 1.
And clearly, the multiplicative identity 1 belongs to S. But what about multiplicative
inverses? If we express an element of S in trigonometric form, it looks like
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
And by DeMoivre’s Theorem 8.4, its multiplicative inverse is exactly
e−iθ = cos(−θ) + i sin(−θ) = cos θ −i sin θ,
which still belongs to S, as you can easily verify.
The diagram below shows graphically the values of α, α2, and α−1 for an arbitrary
complex number α ∈S.

Then this is a group under matrix multiplication. To verify this explicitly, we would
need to make sure each element has an inverse in the set (this is not too diﬃcult), and
also check that this set is closed under multiplication. If we were to do this by brute
force, there would be a lot of multiplications to check! (How many?) However, this set
of matrices should look familiar: It was a geometrically explicit realization of D3, the
group of symmetries of an equilateral triangle. (See Chapter 17.)
 Quick Exercise.
Recall from Chapter 17 that multiplication of these matrices
corresponds to composition of symmetries. With this observation, why must this set
of matrices be closed under multiplication? 
Example 19.16
We now work inside M2(C), the ring of 2 × 2 matrices with complex entries. Consider
the following set of 2 × 2 matrices:

Then this is a group under matrix multiplication. It is a tedious matter to verify that
this set is closed under multiplication, and we will not carry out this project. However,
it would be worthwhile for you to try a few sample multiplications, to get a feel for
how this group works:
 Quick Exercise.
Do this. 
It is important to note that every element in this set has an inverse; you will verify
that this is the case in Exercise 19.3. This group is non-abelian; it is known as the
group of quaternions. We will denote it by Q8. In Exercise 21.12 we will introduce a
more compact notation for the elements of Q8.
Example 19.17
We now work inside the group S3. Consider the set of permutations {ι, (123), (132)}.
Since the two permutations (123) and (132) are inverses of one another, it is clear that
this set is closed under multiplication (which is really functional composition), and so
this is a group.
Example 19.18
Let’s work inside S4. We claim that the set
ι,
(12)(34),
(13)(24),
(14)(23)
is a group. It is evident that each of these permutations is its own inverse. But we
must check that this set is closed under multiplication. There are only three interesting
products to compute.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. For example, (12)(34) (13)(24) = (14)(23). 
It’s worth noting that many sets equipped with a single operation do not satisfy the
group axioms.

Exercises
Example 19.19
Consider the integers Z equipped with multiplication. This is not a group. Although
the operation is associative, and there is an identity (namely, 1), almost none of the
elements have inverses (with respect to this operation).
More generally, if we take a ring R and forget its addition, we will never obtain a group!
To begin with, we wouldn’t get a group unless we had a multiplicative identity (unity). But
even if R has unity, we would then require that every element of R have a multiplicative
inverse; yet 0 never has a multiplicative inverse! (The only exception here is the trivial
example of the zero ring.)
Of course, this isn’t the only way a set with a binary operation can fail to be a group.
Example 19.20
The non-negative integers {0, 1, 2, · · ·} is not a group under addition: Although it has
an additive identity, all elements (except 0 itself) lack an inverse.
Example 19.21
Let R be an arbitrary ring. We consider the set Aut(R) of all ring isomorphisms from
R onto itself; such isomorphisms are called automorphisms. We claim that Aut(R)
is a group, under functional composition. We need to check that this operation is well
deﬁned; that is, is the composition of two such isomorphisms itself an isomorphism?
You will do this in Exercise 19.10, where you check that such a composition still
preserves addition and multiplication and is a bijection. Next, note that for any ring
R, the identity function ι : R →R deﬁned by ι(r) = r is in fact a ring isomorphism
(see Example 11.8). This element will be the identity element in this group, because
when we compose it with any other automorphism, we get the same function back.
And in Section 7.4 we described how the inverse function of a ring isomorphism is
itself a ring isomorphism, and so each element of Aut(R) has a inverse. In Exercises
19.11–19.15 you will determine the elements of Aut(R), for certain speciﬁc rings.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we have generalized the notion of group of symmetries and the symmetric
groups Sn, to obtain the concept of abstract group. We looked at many examples of groups,
including two important classes arising from rings: the additive group of a ring, and the
group of units of a ring with unity.

1. Suppose you have a set of n elements with a binary operation that you think might
be a group. You easily check that there is an identity and that every element has an
inverse, but you are now faced with showing the operation is associative. So, you check
the equation a ◦(b ◦c) = (a ◦b) ◦c for all possible a, b, and c. How many equations
must you check? If n = 5, how many equations is this? If n = 10, how many?

(b) Now let A(R) be the set of functions from S(R) that are also order-preserving:
By this we mean that if x < y, then f(x) < f(y). Prove that A(R) is a group
under functional composition. (Note that S(R) includes many strange functions;
however, the functions in A(R) are all continuous. You could try to prove this,

Aut(R) is closed under functional composition; in Example 19.21 we complete the

11. Prove that Aut(Z) is a group with only a single element.
12. Show that Aut(Q) is a group with only a single element.
13. In this problem you will sketch the proof that Aut(R) is a group with only a single
element. You will use the fact that all positive real numbers have exactly two square

(a) Let a, b ∈R. Show that a ≥b if and only if a −b = x2, for some x ∈R.
(b) Use part (a) to show that if ϕ ∈Aut(R), then a ≥b if and only if ϕ(a) ≥ϕ(b).
(c) Argue that any automorphism of R is ﬁxed on the rational numbers Q. (See
Exercise 12.)
(d) You may assume that between any two real numbers is a rational number. Use
this to prove that any automorphism of R is ﬁxed on all real numbers, and so
Aut(R) has only a single element.

Gn = {1, −1} × Zn.
We deﬁne an operation on this set by
(i, [k]) ∗(j, [m]) = (ij, [m + jk]).
Prove that this makes Gn a group. Note: Do not neglect to show that this operation
is associative! In Exercise 20.29 we will provide a more compact notation for this
group, and show rigorously that it is ‘essentially the same’ as the dihedral group Dn
we introduced in Chapter 17—the group of symmetries of a regular n-sided polygon.

Chapter 20
Subgroups
In this chapter we will closely follow our exposition of abstract rings in Chapters 6 and 7.
We ﬁrst prove a theorem about arithmetic in an abstract group, quite similar to Theorem
6.1. We then introduce the idea of subgroup, which is quite analogous to the corresponding
idea subring. Finally, we will introduce group isomorphisms.
20.1
Arithmetic in an Abstract Group
Theorem 20.1 Suppose that G is a group with operation ◦, and g, h, k ∈G.
a. (Cancellation on the right) If g ◦k = h ◦k, then g = h.
b. (Cancellation on the left) If k ◦g = k ◦h, then g = h.
c. (Solution of Equations) The equation g ◦x = h always has a unique solution in G;
likewise, the equation x ◦g = h always has a unique solution in G.
d. (Uniqueness of inverse) Every element of G has exactly one inverse.
e. (Uniqueness of identity) There is only one element of G which satisﬁes the equations
z ◦g = g ◦z = g for all g; namely, the element e.
f. (Inverse of a product) The inverse of a product is the product of the inverses, in
reversed order: (g ◦h)−1 = h−1 ◦g−1.
Notice that we need to state both parts (a) and (b), because in an arbitrary group the
operation is not commutative: Hence, one of these statements does not immediately follow
from the other. Likewise, the solutions guaranteed for the two equations in part (c) need
not be the same.
 Quick Exercise.
Consider these equations in the group of symmetries of the tetrahe-
dron:
ϕ1x = ρ3
and
xϕ1 = ρ3.
Discover the solutions to these equations (by examining the group table in Section 17.6);
note that they are not the same. 
Notice that we have already encountered the rule in part (f) for computing inverses of
products, when we discussed the multiplicative inverse of a product in a non-commutative
ring; it might be worthwhile to re-read our discussion of this rule in Section 8.2.
Proof:
(a) & (b): Merely operate on the appropriate side of the equation by an inverse
of k.

(c): This is Exercise 2; your proof will be similar to part (b) of Theorem 6.1.
(d): This is Exercise 3.
(e): Suppose that e and z both serve as identities in G. Then e = e ◦z (because z is an
identity); but e ◦z = z, (because e is an identity). Thus e = z.
(f): Consider that
(g ◦h) ◦(h−1 ◦g−1) = g ◦(h ◦h−1) ◦g−1 = g ◦e ◦g−1 = g ◦g−1 = e.
 Quick Exercise.
Similarly, show that (h−1 ◦g−1) ◦(g ◦h) = e. 
Because inverses are unique, (g ◦h)−1 = h−1 ◦g−1.

20.2
Notation
Henceforth, when we discuss a generic abstract group, we will tend to denote its operation
by juxtaposition, rather than by using the symbol ◦for the operation; we will say that the
group is being written multiplicatively. In this case, we will usually denote the (unique)
identity by 1 and will denote the (unique) inverse of element g by g−1. Note that we have
already used juxtaposition for the group operation for symmetry groups and permutations
groups (this despite the fact that the operations there are really functional composition). As
in those groups, g2 = g ◦g, g3 = g ◦g ◦g, and so on. In fact, when we use this multiplicative
notation, we will often refer informally to the operation as multiplication.
If a generic abstract group is abelian, we will tend to denote its operation by +; we
will say that the group is being written additively. In this case, we will usually denote the
identity by 0 and will denote the inverse of element g by −g. We can in this situation talk
about subtraction:
g −h = g + (−h).
However, for some abelian groups, it is still most natural to use multiplicative notation; for
example, we will still use multiplicative notation for the abelian multiplicative group Q∗of
non-zero rational numbers.
You should exercise extreme care in sorting out which sort of notation we use for a given
group. General remarks, deﬁnitions, and theorems may be expressed multiplicatively, but
they still apply for groups written additively. Note that for many sets equipped naturally
with more than one operation (such as rings), only one of those operations makes the set a
group. Be sure you know which!
20.3
Subgroups
It is often easier to check whether a given set is a group, if it is a subset of a larger group
with the same operation. This is directly analogous to the ring theoretic situation, where
we were led to a deﬁnition of subring. Similarly, we say that a subset H of a group G is a
subgroup if H is itself a group under the operation induced from G.
We can immediately list some examples:

Chapter 20: Subgroups
221
Example 20.1
The additive group of integers Z is a subgroup of the additive group of reals R.
We can generalize Example 20.1. If R is a subring of S, and we ignore the multiplication,
then clearly the additive group R is a subgroup of the additive group S. This obviously
provides us with a raft of additional examples of subgroups.

List for yourself at least six interesting examples of subgroups arising
in this way. 
Example 20.2
The unit circle S is a subgroup of the multiplicative group C∗of non-zero complex
numbers. (See Example 19.14.)
Example 20.3
The set {1, 4, 3, 12, 9, 10} is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of units U(Z13) =
Z∗
13. (See Example 19.13.)
Example 20.4
The set {ι, (123), (132)} is a subgroup of the symmetric group S3. (See Example 19.17.)
Example 20.5
Let G be any group (written multiplicatively). Then {1} and G itself are always sub-
groups of G. We call {1} the trivial subgroup of G. G is the improper subgroup of
G. All subgroups of G other than the improper subgroup G are proper subgroups.
Example 20.6
Note that because Z is an additive group, the trivial subgroup of this group is {0}.
 Quick Exercise.
Is {1} a subgroup of Z? (Under what operation? Remember that
when we say that H is a subgroup of G, we are implying that G is also a group.) 
Example 20.7
Consider the subset {ι, ϕ} of D3. Because ϕ is its own inverse, it is easy to see that
this is a subgroup.

Characterization of Subgroups
As with rings, we have a theorem that makes it easy to check whether a given set is a
subgroup:
Theorem 20.2
The Subgroup Theorem
A non-empty subset H of a group G is
a subgroup if and only if whenever h, k ∈H, then hk−1 ∈H.
Note that in an abelian group (written additively), this says just that a non-empty
subset of a group is a subgroup if and only if it is closed under subtraction.
Proof:
This theorem is proved just like the corresponding theorem for rings (Theorem
7.1) and is Exercise 4.
2
Note that Examples 7.6 through 7.10 are examples of this theorem in action (if you just
ignore multiplication).
 Quick Exercise.
Review these examples from Chapter 7. 
Here are some examples of subgroups which are not additive groups of rings:
Example 20.8
We work in the multiplicative group Q∗. Let
H =
nm
n : m, n are odd integers
o
.
We claim that H is a subgroup. Pick two typical elements of H, m/n and r/s, where
m, n, r, and s are all odd integers. Then
m
n
r
s
−1
= m
n
s
r = ms
nr .
But ms and nr are clearly odd integers, and so this is an element of H. By the theorem,
H is a subgroup. (The most interesting thing about this conclusion is that H is a group
at all!)
Example 20.9
We work in D4, the group of symmetries of the square. Consider the set
{ι, ρ, ρ2, ρ3}.
Note that ρ−1 = ρ3, and (ρ2)−1 = ρ2. This means that any substitution into hk−1 by
elements from this set will turn into a power of ρ and hence will belong to the set. We
will generalize this example in the next chapter.
20.5
Group Isomorphisms
Just as we did for rings, we now make sense of what it means to say that two groups are
essentially the same. Suppose that G is a group with operation ◦, and H is a group with

Chapter 20: Subgroups
223
operation ∗. We then say that G and H are isomorphic if there is a bijection ϕ : G →H
which preserves the group operations; that is, for any g, k ∈G we have that ϕ(g ◦k) =
ϕ(g) ∗ϕ(k). Notice that g and k are elements of G, and so we are combining them with the
G operation ◦, while ϕ(g), ϕ(k) are elements of H, and so we are combining them with the
H operation ∗. We call the function ϕ a group isomorphism.
Just as with rings, group isomorphisms preserve the other essential group structures,
and the proofs are essentially the same. If eG, eH are the identity elements for G and H
respectively, then ϕ(eG) = eH (this is Exercise 21). If g and k are inverses in group G, then
ϕ(g) and ϕ(k) are inverses in the group H (this is Exercise 22). Furthermore, if ψ is the
inverse function of the bijection ϕ (as discussed in Section 7.4), then ψ : H →G is a group
isomorphism too (this is Exercise 23). That is, two groups being isomorphic is a symmetric
relationship.
Let’s now turn to some examples of group isomorphisms. These examples will illuminate
and clarify a lot of what we have done so far. But we ﬁrst note that if we have a ring
isomorphism, then we automatically have a group isomorphism between the additive groups
of the rings. This applies to such Examples as 7.16, 7.17, and 11.5, among others.
Example 20.10
Consider the groups D3 (symmetries of an equilateral triangle), S3 (symmetric group
on the set {1, 2, 3}, and the group of six matrices given in Example 19.15. All of these
groups are isomorphic to one another, and the bijections between them may be found
in Sections 17.2 and 17.3. In Chapter 17 we argued in some detail that these bijections
preserve the group operations (although in that chapter we did not use that language).
Example 20.11
Our discussion at the end of Section 18.4 regarding the cycle structure of elements of S4,
and the determination of those which correspond to elements of the symmetry group
of the regular tetrahedron can now be rephrased like this: The symmetry group for the
tetrahedron is isomorphic to the subgroup of S4 consisting of the twelve elements
ι, (123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143), (234), (243), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
We will henceforth denote this subgroup of S4 by A4, and call it the alternating
group on 4 elements; we will see in Chapter 27 the origin of this terminology.
Example 20.12
Consider now the additive group Z2 and the multiplicative group U(Z) = {1, −1}.
Consider the bijection that assigns 0 ∈Z2 to 1 ∈U(Z); we have to do this because we
know that a group isomorphism must send one group identity to the other. We then
must send 1 to −1. This is a group isomorphism ϕ that sends addition to multiplication;
for example,
1 = ϕ(0) = ϕ(1 + 1) = ϕ(1)ϕ(1) = (−1)(−1) = 1.
There aren’t that many more cases to consider for a brute force veriﬁcation that this
bijection takes addition to multiplication in all cases. This example is very close to a
proof that all groups with two elements are isomorphic to one another. We will prove
this (and much more) carefully in the next chapter.
 Quick Exercise.
Argue that the subgroup {ι, (12)} of S3 is isomorphic to the two
groups we discuss in this example, by providing an explicit bijection that preserves the
group operation.

To understand any given group, we thus are not so concerned with the particular notation
or type of operation we use. All three groups with two elements in the previous example
behave in essentially the same way!
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we proved some elementary properties of the arithmetic of an abstract group.
We then introduced the concept of subgroup, listed many examples, and proved a theorem
which characterizes subgroups. We then introduced the idea of group isomorphism, which
we used to illuminate some of our earlier examples.

Rk, and the elements (−1, [k]) are labeled as FRk.
(a) Show that the elements of Gn under this labeling do satisfy the identities
RF = FRn−1, F 2 = 1, and Rn = 1.
In fact, it is possible to prove that our list above of the elements Rk, FRk,
together with these identities, abstractly characterizes the group Gn. We will
not rigorously prove this here, however.
(b) Using the abstract characterization of Gn described above, prove that the dihe-

Cyclic Groups
Suppose that G is a group (written multiplicatively), and g ∈G. If we repeatedly multiply
g by itself, we get the powers of g:
g1 = g,
g2 = gg,
g3 = g(g2),
g4 = g(g3),
· · · .
Given an element gn of this form, we call n an exponent; for now, we are restricting
ourselves to exponents that are positive integers.
Example 21.1
Choose the element 2 in Q∗. Then the powers of 2 are the distinct elements
2,
4,
8,
16,
· · · .
Note that there are inﬁnitely many distinct elements in this list.
Example 21.2
Choose element (123) in the symmetric group S3. Then the powers of (123) are the
repeating list of elements
(123),
(123)2 = (132),
(123)3 = ι,
(123)4 = (123),
· · · .
Note that there are exactly three distinct elements in this list.
21.1
The Order of an Element
It turns out that all elements in a group behave in one or the other of the two ways illustrated
by our examples above. We make this precise in the following theorem:
Theorem 21.1 Suppose that G is a group and let g ∈G. Then exactly one of the following
two cases holds:
a. (The Torsion-free Case) All the powers
g,
g2,
g3,
g4,
· · ·
of g are distinct elements of G.
b. (The Torsion Case) There exists a least positive integer n for which gn = 1. In this
case, the elements
g,
g2,
g3,
· · · ,
gn−1,
gn = 1
are all distinct.
229

230
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
If an element falls into the second case, we say that it is a torsion element. The integer
n we call its order. In this case, we denote the (ﬁnite) order of an element g by o(g). Thus,
in Example 21.2 above, o((123)) = 3. If an element falls into the ﬁrst case, we say that it is
a torsion-free element and that it has inﬁnite order. The word ‘torsion’ is intended to
reﬂect the fact that in the second case the powers of the element cycle back on themselves:
•
•
•
•
•
· · ·
g
g2
g3
g4
gn = ι
Proof:
Let G be a group, and g ∈G. If all the powers of g are distinct, we obviously have
the ﬁrst case. Suppose, then, that not all powers of g are distinct. Then there exist positive
integers r and s with gr = gs. We may as well assume that r < s. But now multiply both
sides of this equation by r copies of g−1:
1 = (g−1)r(gr) = (g−1)rgs = gs−r.
This tells us that there exists some positive integer n (in this case, s −r) so that 1 = gn.
By the Well-ordering Principle choose the smallest such n. We then claim that
g,
g2,
g3,
· · · ,
gn−1,
gn = 1
are all distinct elements. If not, then gr = gs, where 1 ≤r < s ≤n. By the same argument
as above, gs−r = 1. But this is impossible because s−r < n, and we had chosen n to be the
least such exponent. We have thus concluded that the second case holds, if the ﬁrst fails.2
Example 21.3
The order of 3 in the group U(Z8) is 2. Of course, we could then write o(3) = 2.
Example 21.4
The order of the identity in any group is 1.

√
2? 
The point of the previous Quick Exercise is this: It is possible that a group possess some
elements with inﬁnite order, and some elements (other than the identity) with ﬁnite order.
The next two examples provide a somewhat more complicated illustration of this.

Chapter 21: Cyclic Groups
231
Example 21.5
The element e
πi
5
= cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5) in the unit circle S has order 10. (Use
DeMoivre’s Theorem 8.4.)
Example 21.6
Consider the element cos 1 + i sin 1 in the unit circle S. (Here, the angle in question is
1 radian, or about 57 degrees.) We claim that this element is torsion-free. If not, there
must exist a positive integer n for which
1 = (cos 1 + i sin 1)n = cos n + i sin n.
Thus, n is an angle whose cosine is 1. Elementary trigonometry tells us that n must
be an integer multiple of 2π: n = 2πk. But then π = n/(2k). That is, π must be a
rational number! This is certainly false, and is known as Lambert’s Theorem; we will
discuss this fact further in Section 38.3. Thus, the element cos 1 + i sin 1 has inﬁnite
order. (You may have already worked with this example in Exercise 8.8.)
Let’s consider now a cycle in a symmetric group. For example, the cycle (1234) has order
four:
(1234),
(1234)2 = (13)(24),
(1234)3 = (1234)(13)(24) = (1432),
(1234)4 = ι.
We can generalize this: A cycle of length n has order n. For if α is such an element, obviously
we must apply it to itself exactly n times to bring any element of its support back to itself.
But now consider an arbitrary permutation α. We know by Theorem 18.3 that it can be
factored as a product k disjoint cycles
α = β1β2 · · · βk,
which necessarily commute (Theorem 18.2). Therefore, we can easily compute the mth
power of α:
αm = βm
1 βm
2 · · · βm
k .
To make such a product the identity, we must guarantee that simultaneously all the terms
(βi)m are the identity (for otherwise, the element αm would not be the identity on elements
in the orbit corresponding to βi). To accomplish this, we need m to be a common multiple
of the orders of all the βi’s. The least common multiple will do the job. In fact, the least
common multiple of the orders of all the βi’s is the order of α. (See Exercise 5.)
Example 21.7
What is the order of the element (1234)(567)(89)? The least common multiple of 4, 3,
and 2 is 12, so this must be the order of this permutation.
21.2
Rule of Exponents
We will now deﬁne what we mean by negative exponents on an element in a multiplicative
group. If n is a positive integer, we deﬁne g−n to mean (g−1)n. And by g0, we mean the

232
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
identity 1. The reason we make these deﬁnitions is exactly so that the ordinary rule of
exponents works:
(gr)(gs) = gr+s,
for all integers positive, negative, or zero. In ordinary arithmetic, preserving the rule of
exponents is exactly the reason why such computations as 3−2 = 1/9 and 30 = 1 are
deﬁned in the way they are.
Proof of Rule of Exponents:
If r and s are both positive, this is clear, by the deﬁnition
of positive exponents. If r and s are both negative, then
grgs = (g−1)−r(g−1)−s,
where the exponents −r and −s are both positive. This then reduces to the previous case.
What if one exponent is positive and one is negative? Suppose that r, s > 0; then
grg−s = gr(g−1)s.
We then cancel out terms until we run out of either g’s or g−1’s. In either case, we obtain
gr−s, as we require.
 Quick Exercise.
There remains the case when r or s (or both) is 0; handle this. 
2
Suppose that g has ﬁnite order n; then
1 = gn = gn−1g.
Because the inverse of g is unique, g−1 = gn−1. Consequently, any negative power of g can
be expressed as a positive power, if g is a torsion element.
Example 21.8
Consider the element [3] in
U(Z14) = {1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13}.
The order of this element is 6.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the order of [3] is 6. 
Thus, [3]−1 = [3]5. We can check this directly:
[3]5 = [243] = [14 · 17 + 5] = [5],
and [3][5] = [15] = [1].
Let’s express [3]−4 as a positive power of [3]:
[3]−4 = ([3]−1)4 = ([3]5)4 = [3]20 = ([3]6)3[3]2 = [1][3]2 = [3]2.
On the other hand, if an element g has inﬁnite order, its inverse cannot be expressed as
a positive power of g. Indeed, all the elements
· · · , g−2, g−1, g0 = 1, g1 = g, g2, g3, · · ·
are distinct. The proof of this is a slight variation of the proof regarding the torsion-free
case in Theorem 21.1; we leave it as Exercise 4.

In case an element g has ﬁnite order, there is a simple relationship between o(g) and
any integer m for which gm = 1. We use the Division Theorem 2.1 for Z to see this:

Chapter 21: Cyclic Groups
233
Theorem 21.2 Suppose that g is an element of a group, with order n. Suppose also that
gm = 1, where m is some positive integer. Then n divides m.
Proof:
Let g be a group element, and n = o(g). Suppose also that gm = 1. Now n is
the least positive integer so that gn = 1. Thus, n ≤m. By the Division Theorem for the
integers (Theorem 2.1), we can write m = qn + r, where q is a positive integer, and r is an
integer with 0 ≤r < n. But then
1 = gm = gqn+r = (gn)qgr = gr.
But because n is the least positive integer for which gn = 1, we must have that r = 0. In
other words, n divides m.

In our discussion in this chapter we have up to now restricted ourselves to groups written
multiplicatively. Of course, all our deﬁnitions and results apply to groups written additively
as well, but the notation looks quite diﬀerent.
To begin with, consider the positive powers of an element g of a group G, which is written
additively. Our previous experience with rings supplies us with the appropriate notation:
g, g + g = 2g, g + g + g = 3g, · · · , g + g + · · · g = ng, · · · .
If the order of g is inﬁnite, then these elements are all distinct.
Example 21.9
The element 2 in the additive group Z has inﬁnite order, because
2,
4,
6,
8, · · ·
are all distinct.
 Quick Exercise.
What is the order of −1 in the additive group Z[
√
2]? Notice how
diﬀerent this question is than our earlier one about the order of −1 in the multiplicative
group U(Z[

2]). 
If the order of g is ﬁnite, adding g to itself ﬁnitely many times yields the identity, which
in this case we denote by 0.
Example 21.10
The element 2 in the additive group Z6 has order 3, because the least n for which
n2 = 0 is 3: 2 + 2 + 2 = 0.
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the orders of all elements in Z6. 
Note that if g has ﬁnite order in an additive group (say, o(g) = n), then −g = (n −1)g.
(This, of course, is just the observation we made in multiplicative groups that g−1 = gn−1.)
That is, −g is an integer multiple of g. For example, the order of [2] in Z24 is 12. Then
[(12 −1)2] = [22] = −[2], the inverse of [2].

Suppose now that g is an element of order n in the group G (written multiplicatively). Now
consider the subset
{1, g, g2, · · · , gn−1}
of G. Because all the negative powers of g can be expressed as a positive power, it is quite
clear that this is a subgroup. Furthermore, it is evidently the smallest subgroup of G that
contains g, because by closure of the operation all powers of g belong to any group containing
g. We call this subgroup the cyclic subgroup generated by g, and denote it by ⟨g⟩.
Example 21.11
The cyclic subgroup generated by (123) in S3 is ⟨(123)⟩= {ι, (123), (132)} and the
cyclic subgroup generated by (12) in this group is ⟨(12)⟩= {ι, (12)}.
Example 21.12
The cyclic subgroup of Z∗
7 generated by 2 is ⟨2⟩= {1, 2, 4} and that generated by 3 is
the entire group.
Example 21.13
The cyclic subgroup of C∗generated by i is
⟨i⟩= {1, i, −1, −i}.
Example 21.14
The cyclic subgroup of Z12 generated by 4 is ⟨4⟩= {0, 4, 8} and that generated by 0
is the trivial subgroup {0}.
What if g is an element of inﬁnite order in G? Then the smallest subgroup of G containing
g must at least include all integer powers of g. In fact, in this case we set
⟨g⟩= {· · · , g−2, g−1, 1, g, g2, · · ·}.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that ⟨g⟩as just deﬁned is indeed a subgroup of G. 
Example 21.15
The cyclic subgroup generated by 2 in the group Z is the subgroup ⟨2⟩= 2Z.

Chapter 21: Cyclic Groups
235
Example 21.16
The cyclic subgroup generated by π in the group R∗is the inﬁnite set
⟨π⟩=

· · · , 1
π2 , 1
π , 1, π, π2, · · ·

.
We can subsume these two deﬁnitions of cyclic subgroup under a single expression: For
any element g in the group G,
⟨g⟩= {gm : m ∈Z}.
Of course, if g is torsion-free, we obtain distinct elements for each choice of integer m. If g
has ﬁnite order, each element of the cyclic subgroup is obtained by inﬁnitely many choices
of m.
Notice that we have used the same notation for cyclic subgroup that we have earlier used
for principal ideal. This should cause no confusion, as long as you are certain whether we
are working with groups or rings. This notational coincidence underlies the similarity of the
concepts: The cyclic subgroup generated by an element is the smallest subgroup containing
the element, while the principal ideal for an element is the smallest ideal containing the
element.
21.4
Cyclic Groups
We say that a group G is itself cyclic if there exists some element g ∈G so that ⟨g⟩= G;
that is, the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g is the entire group. A cyclic group with
inﬁnitely many elements is necessarily generated by an element of inﬁnite order. A cyclic
group with ﬁnitely many elements (say, n) is necessarily generated by an element with order
n.
Example 21.17
The integers Z is a cyclic group, because Z = ⟨1⟩.
Example 21.18
The group Zm is cyclic, for any integer m > 1, because Zm = ⟨1⟩.
Example 21.19
The group Z∗
13 is cyclic, with generator 2.
Note that in a cyclic group not all non-identity elements serve as generators.
 Quick Exercise.
Give non-identity elements in the groups Z and in Z∗
13 that do not
generate the entire group. Can you do this in Z∗
5? 
Example 21.20
The group S3 is not cyclic because it has 6 elements, but it contains no element of
order 6.

236
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 21.21
The group U(Z8) = {1, 3, 5, 7} is not cyclic either; all non-identity elements have order
2. That is, there is no element of order 4.
Except for notational diﬀerences, it may by now seem that any cyclic group of a given
order is essentially like any other of the same order and this is in fact the case, as we show
in the next theorem.
Theorem 21.3 All inﬁnite cyclic groups are isomorphic to the additive group Z. All cyclic
groups of order n (where n is an integer greater than 1) are isomorphic to the additive group
Zn.
Proof:
Suppose that G is an inﬁnite cyclic group (which we may as well write multiplica-
tively). Then G has a generator g. That is,
G = {gm : m ∈Z},
where if r ̸= s, then gr ̸= gs. Deﬁne the function
ϕ : G →Z
by ϕ(gm) = m. (This looks like a symbolic version of the logarithm function because it
picks oﬀexponents!) The rule of exponents says that this function takes the operation in G
to addition in Z. It is clearly a bijection.
 Quick Exercise.
Why is ϕ one-to-one and onto? 
Suppose now that G is a cyclic group of order n. Then we know that G has a generator
g, so that
G = {1, g, g2, · · · , gn−1},
and gn = 1. Deﬁne the function
ϕ : G →Zn
by ϕ(gm) = [m]. Let’s show that this preserves the group operation. So choose gr, gs ∈G;
here, 0 ≤r, s ≤n −1. Then
ϕ(grgs) = ϕ(gr+s).
If r + s ≤n −1, then the value of the function is
[r + s] = [r] + [s] = ϕ(gr) + ϕ(gs),
as required. Otherwise, n ≤r + s ≤2n −2, and so
ϕ(gr+s) =
ϕ(gngr+s−n) = ϕ(1 · gr+s−n) = ϕ(gr+s−n) =
[r + s −n] = [r + s] = [r] + [s],
again as required.
2
This last theorem is a good example of a recurrent theme in algebra: We have charac-
terized the concrete example Z as the apparently abstract construct ‘inﬁnite cyclic group’.
This provides us real insight into the essence of the group structure of Z.
We now have a careful explication of Example 20.12: All groups with 2 elements are
cyclic, and isomorphic to the additive group Z2.

Chapter 21: Cyclic Groups
237
Let’s now return to our examples of cyclic groups from earlier in this chapter.
For example, the cyclic subgroup of the multiplicative group Z∗
7 generated by 2 con-
sidered in Example 21.12 has three elements. Likewise, so does the cyclic subgroup of the
additive group Z12 generated by 4, considered in Example 21.14. Consequently, both these
groups are isomorphic to Z3, and hence to each other.
 Quick Exercise.
Write down explicit isomorphisms between each pair of these three
groups. 
The cyclic subgroup of Z generated by 2, which we considered in Example 21.15, is
inﬁnite. Likewise, so is the cyclic subgroup of R∗generated by π which we considered in
Example 21.16. Therefore, both of these groups are isomorphic to Z.
 Quick Exercise.
Write down explicit isomorphisms between each pair of these three
groups. 
As a consequence of this isomorphism theorem, when we wish to discuss a cyclic group
in the abstract and wish to use multiplicative notation, we will tend to denote it by
⟨a⟩= {· · · , a−2, a−1, 1, a, a2, · · ·}
(if it is inﬁnite), or
⟨a⟩= {1, a, a2, · · · , an−1}
(if it is ﬁnite). We won’t worry concretely about what a is, because any such cyclic group
is essentially the same.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we analyzed the important notions of the order of an element of a group and
saw that an element of a group can have either inﬁnite or ﬁnite order. We also discussed
the cyclic subgroup generated by an element. We showed that all inﬁnite cyclic groups are
isomorphic to the additive group Z, and all ﬁnite cyclic groups are isomorphic to the additive
group Zn, for some positive integer n.

Section IV in a Nutshell
This section deﬁnes the abstract notion of group, after examining some important examples:
symmetries of regular n-sided polygons (called the nth dihedral groups, Dn), symmetries of
the regular tetrahedron in 3-dimensional space, and most importantly, the permutations
of a set of n objects, which we call the symmetric group on n, Sn. (We mostly conﬁne
ourselves to permutations of a ﬁnite set, but the collection of permutations of inﬁnite sets
are also groups.) The dihedral groups and the symmetries in space can all be thought of as
subgroups of the permutations of the vertices of the corresponding geometric objects. The
dihedral group Dn has 2n elements, and the symmetric group Sn has n! elements.
Elements of Sn can be uniquely factored into disjoint cycles (Theorem 18.3). Disjoint
cycles will always commute (Theorem 18.2).
A group G is a set of elements with one binary operation (◦) that satisﬁes three rules:
1. (g ◦h) ◦k = g ◦(h ◦k), for all g, h, k ∈G,
2. There exists an element e ∈G (called the identity of G) such that g ◦e = e ◦g = g
for all g ∈G, and
3. For each g ∈G, there exists an element x (called the inverse of g) such that g ◦x =
x ◦g = e.
In addition to the groups mentioned above, other important examples of a group are the
additive group of a ring (that is, the elements of a ring with only the addition considered)
and the group of units of a ring with unity under multiplication. An abelian group is one
in which the binary operation ◦is commutative.
Groups enjoy cancellation on both the right and the left, and the solution of equations.
Furthermore, the group identity is unique as is the inverse of each element. (All this is
Theorem 20.1.)
Paralleling the idea of subrings is the idea of subgroup: If G is a group then a subset H
of G is a subgroup if it is itself a group under the operation induced from G. To determine
if H is a subgroup of a group G, we need only check that hk−1 ∈H for every h, k ∈H
(Theorem 20.2).
If G is a group with operation ◦and H is a group with operation ∗, a map ϕ : G →H
is a group isomorphism if ϕ is a bijection and ϕ(g ◦h) = ϕ(g) ∗ϕ(h) for all g, h ∈G. This
parallels the idea of a ring isomorphism.
An important class of subgroup of any group G is the cyclic subgroup generated by g,
which we denote by ⟨g⟩. It consists of the powers of g. The subgroup ⟨g⟩may be inﬁnite or
ﬁnite, depending on whether the order of g is inﬁnite or ﬁnite. If G itself is generated by
the powers of a single element, we say that G is a cyclic group. All inﬁnite cyclic groups
are isomorphic to Z; all ﬁnite cyclic groups with n elements are isomorphic to Zn (Theorem
21.3).

Chapter 22
Group Homomorphisms
We are now ready to make the appropriate deﬁnition of a group homomorphism, generalizing
the idea of group isomorphism from Section 20.5. This deﬁnition is exactly what you should
expect, given our earlier experience with ring homomorphisms in Chapter 11.
22.1
Homomorphisms
Following our deﬁnition of isomorphism, we will be careful to consider two groups whose
operations are denoted by explicit symbols. So, let G together with operation ◦, and H
together with operation ∗, be groups. A function ϕ : G →H such that
ϕ(g ◦k) = ϕ(g) ∗ϕ(k),
for all g, k ∈G is a group homomorphism. Speaking more colloquially, a group homo-
morphism is a function between groups that preserves the group operation. We are requiring
neither that this function be injective nor surjective.
22.2
Examples
It is time to look at some examples of group homomorphisms. First, the group isomorphisms
we discussed in Chapter 20 serve as examples.
Example 22.1
Examine Examples 20.10, 20.11, and 20.12. These are functions between groups that
preserve the group operation.
We can also obtain many examples from our work with rings; we will begin with a
general class of examples.
Namely, let R and S be rings, and ϕ : R →S a ring homomorphism. Now just look
at the additive groups of R and S (so the operations on R and S are both just +). This
function preserves addition, and so is a group homomorphism too. We mention speciﬁcally
one important example of this type.
Example 22.2
The residue function ϕ : Z →Zm is a ring homomorphism, and therefore a group
homomorphism too.
245

 Quick Exercise.
Now look at Examples 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, and 11.5. Because they are
ring homomorphisms, they are certainly group homomorphisms too. 
Example 22.3
Now consider Example 11.6. It is the function ρ : Z →Z deﬁned by ρ(n) = 3n. Here,
we are considering Z as an additive group. This function preserves addition:
ρ(n + m) = 3(n + m) = 3n + 3m = ρ(n) + ρ(m).
Thus, ρ is a group homomorphism. In Example 11.6 we saw that this is not a ring ho-
momorphism: It preserves addition but not multiplication. This group homomorphism
is certainly injective, but it is not surjective: For the ﬁrst assertion, if 3n = 3m, then
n = m. For the second, note that ρ(n) ̸= 4, for all n ∈Z.
It’s time to consider some examples further aﬁeld from rings:
Example 22.4
Consider the groups R under addition, and R+ of positive real numbers, under multi-
plication. Recall the function log : R+ →R, the natural logarithm function. (That is,
log(r) is the exponent needed on the irrational number e so that elog(r) = r.)
The log function
Recall ﬁrst of all that this function is only deﬁned for positive real numbers. The
most important and useful property of the logarithm function is this:
log(ab) = log(a) + log(b).
That is, the logarithm turns multiplication into addition. And this equation is exactly
what is required to assert that log is a homomorphism! This example is well worth
thinking about. It shows us that the group operations in two groups connected by a
homomorphism can be quite diﬀerent. Notice that this function is actually a bijection.
 Quick Exercise.
Use what you know from calculus about log(x) and ex to check
this.

Thus the multiplicative group of positive real numbers is isomorphic to the additive
group of real numbers! Now we know that a group isomorphism has an inverse function
that also preserves the group operation (see Exercise 20.23). In this case the inverse
function is the group isomorphism exp : R →R+.

Chapter 22: Group Homomorphisms
247
Example 22.5
Consider another famous function, this time between the groups U(M2(R)), the group
of units of the 2 × 2 real-valued matrices, and R∗, the multiplicative group of non-
zero reals. Recall that U(M2(R)) consists precisely of those matrices in M2(R) with
non-zero determinant. (See Exercise 8.2.) Here, the operation in the ﬁrst group is
matrix multiplication, while in the second it is ordinary real number multiplication.
The function is the determinant function det:
det
 a
b
c
d

= ad −bc.
Let’s show that this is a homomorphism. For that purpose, we need to choose two
arbitrary matrices,
 a
b
c
d

and
 r
s
t
u

,
where the entries are all real numbers. The product of these two matrices is
 ar + bt
as + bu
cr + dt
cs + du

,
and the determinant of this matrix is
ardu + btcs −bucr −asdt.
 Quick Exercise.
Check these computations. 
But the product of the determinants is
(ad −bc)(ru −ts),
which is the same. Thus, the determinant function preserves multiplication. To para-
phrase, the determinant of a product is the product of the determinants. It is easy to
see that this homomorphism is not injective (just ﬁnd two matrices with the same de-
terminant), but it is surjective (just ﬁnd a matrix with determinant r, for any non-zero
real number r).
 Quick Exercise.
Carry out the details to verify the assertions in the last
sentence. 
Example 22.6
Consider the group
D3 = {ι, ρ, ρ2, ϕ, ρϕ, ϕρ}
of symmetries of the equilateral triangle, whose operation is functional composition.
Consider also the multiplicative subgroup {1, −1} of the integers. Deﬁne the function
Φ : D3 →{1, −1}
given as follows: Φ(α) = 1 if α is one of the rotations ι, ρ, ρ2; Φ(α) = −1 if α is one of
the ﬂips ϕ, ϕρ, ρϕ.
To see that this is a homomorphism, it is best to return to the group table we
compiled for the symmetry group in Section 17.1. The pattern of F and R we observed
there shows us that a rotation times a rotation is a rotation, a ﬂip times a ﬂip is a
rotation, and a rotation times a ﬂip (in either order) is a ﬂip. Now replace ‘rotation’
by 1 and ‘ﬂip’ by −1 in the previous sentence. This is just the way multiplication in
the group {1, −1} works! This example is obviously surjective but not injective.

248
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 22.7
Consider the group G of symmetries of the tetrahedron, discussed in Section 17.6.
Consider also the additive group Z3. Deﬁne the function
Φ : G →Z3
given as follows: Φ(α) = 0 if α is one of the four symmetries ι, ϕ1, ϕ2, or ϕ3; Φ(α) = 1
if α is one of the four symmetries ρ1, ρ2, ρ3, ρ4; and Φ(α) = 2 if α is one of the four
symmetries ρ2
1, ρ2
2, ρ2
3, ρ2
4.
To see that this is a homomorphism, it is best to return to the group table we
compiled for the symmetry group in Section 17.6. The pattern we observed of F, R,
and R2 elements behaves in exactly the same way as addition in Z3!
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the pattern observed in the group table in Section
17.6 is the same as addition in Z3. 
Thus, we have a group homomorphism from a group where the operation is functional
composition, to a group where the operation is addition (modulo 3). This example is
again surjective but not injective.
Example 22.8
Consider the function D : R[x] →R[x] deﬁned by D(f) = f ′ (the derivative of the
polynomial f). Of course, we know that the derivative of a polynomial is a polynomial.
But we also know that the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives. That is,
D(f + g) = D(f) + D(g).
This is exactly what is required to show that this function is a group homomorphism.
Notice, however, that this function does not preserve multiplication (the product rule
is not that simple), and so this function is not a ring homomorphism. (For more about
the derivative function, see Exercise 4.7.) From what you know about derivatives from
calculus it should be easy to infer that this is also surjective but not injective.
A group homomorphism certainly need not be surjective (see Example 22.3 above).
However, if ϕ : G →H is not onto, the new function (which we still call ϕ) obtained by re-
stricting the range to ϕ(G) certainly is. Thus, ϕ : G →ϕ(G) is a surjective homomorphism,
assuming that ϕ(G) is in fact a subgroup of H. This is the case:
Theorem 22.1 Let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism between groups G and H. Then ϕ(G)
is a subgroup of H.
Proof:
This is Exercise 6. Model your proof on the corresponding ring theory theorem
(Theorem 11.2).
2
22.3
Structure Preserved by Homomorphisms
We now record some of these further algebraic properties preserved by an arbitrary group
homomorphism:

Chapter 22: Group Homomorphisms
249
Theorem 22.2 Let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism between the groups G and H, and let
1G and 1H be the identities of G and H, respectively.
a. ϕ(1G) = 1H.
b. ϕ(g−1) = (ϕ(g))−1, for any g ∈G.
c. Suppose that g ∈G, and g has ﬁnite order. Then the order of ϕ(g) divides the order
of g. If ϕ is an isomorphism, then o(g) = o(ϕ(g)).
d. Suppose that G is abelian. Then ϕ(G) is abelian.
Proof:
Parts (a) and (b) are proved just as in the ring case (Theorem 11.1, parts (a) and
(b)); you have essentially proved these in Exercises 20.21 and 20.22. Your proofs there did
not rely on the function being bijective.
(c): Let g ∈G, and suppose that o(g) = n. Then
1 = ϕ(gn) = (ϕ(g))n.
But then by Theorem 21.2, o(ϕ(g)) divides n = o(g), as claimed. If ϕ is an isomorphism,
it possesses an inverse function ϕ−1 which is also an isomorphism. Applying the homomor-
phism result we just proved to ϕ−1 tells us that o(g) divides o(ϕ(g)) too, and because these
are both positive integers, o(g) = o(ϕ(g)).
(d): This is Exercise 7.

Example 22.9
Consider the groups S3 and Z6; they both have the same number of elements. But
they cannot be isomorphic, because the second group has an element of order 6, while
the ﬁrst doesn’t. But regardless of the order of the elements in each group, the second
group is abelian, while the ﬁrst is not. So we have two reasons why these groups are
not isomorphic.
Example 22.10
The groups Z4 and Z2 × Z2 are both abelian groups with four elements. But they are
not isomorphic, because the ﬁrst group has an element of order 4, while the second
does not.
22.4
Direct Products
Let’s recall a construction we made in rings: Given two groups G and H, consider the set
G × H = {(g, h) : g ∈G, h ∈H}
of all ordered pairs, with ﬁrst entry an element of G and second entry an element of H.
Equip this set with the component-wise operation
(g1, h1)(g2, h2) = (g1g2, h1h2).

This makes G × H a group, called the direct product of G and H. This turns out to be
a handy way to build new groups from old.

We can now use the direct product to construct two important examples of homomor-
phisms:
Example 22.11
Let G and H be groups. Consider the function
ϵ : G →G × H
deﬁned by ϵ(g) = (g, 1). This is certainly a homomorphism:
ϵ(g1g2) = (g1g2, 1) =
(g1, 1)(g2, 1) = ϵ(g1)ϵ(g2).
Note that this function is injective, but certainly not surjective (as long as H has more
than one element).
 Quick Exercise.
Check these claims. 
Of course, we could deﬁne a similar homomorphism on the second component. These
homomorphisms are called embeddings.
Note that
ϵ(G) = {(g, 1) : g ∈G} = G × {1}.
But now we know that ϵ is onto the group G × {1}; since we have already observed that
ϵ is injective, this means that the groups G and G × {1} are isomorphic. By applying the
injection to the other coordinate, we now have seen that G × H has two subgroups, one
isomorphic to G and the other isomorphic to H. In the next chapter we will pursue these
ideas further.
Example 22.12
Let G and H be groups. Consider the function
π : G × H →G
deﬁned by π(g, h) = g. This is called the projection onto the ﬁrst coordinate.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is surjective but not injective (as long as H has
more than one element). 
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the idea of group homomorphism, a function between two
groups that preserves the group operation, and we looked at numerous examples. We took
note of the many other algebraic properties preserved by any group homomorphism. We
also introduced the direct product of two groups along with the closely connected homo-
morphisms embeddings and projections.

ϕg an inner automorphism. Let Inn(G) = {ϕg : g ∈G}. Prove that Inn(G) is a
subgroup of Aut(G). We call this the group of inner automorphisms of G. (See
Exercise 20.27 for the group Aut(G) of automorphisms of G.)

Chapter 23
Structure and Representation
When mathematicians study a structure like groups, they often take two diﬀerent ap-
proaches. One is to ﬁnd a representation for the group. What this typically means is to
deﬁne an (often) injective homomorphism from the group into a larger structure that pro-
vides us with a more concrete notation and terminology, and with better computational
techniques. In Chapter 17 we discovered that groups of symmetries of geometric ﬁgures
could be better understood by representing them either as subgroups of a symmetric group
of permutations, or else as a subgroup of a larger group of matrices. In linear algebra we
learn a lot about computing with matrices, and in Chapter 18 we learned a good bit about
computing with permutations. In this chapter we will discover that all (ﬁnite) groups can
be represented as a subgroup of a symmetric group of permutations. (It is also actually
true that any ﬁnite group can be represented as a group of matrices, but we will avoid the
details in this book, because such representations often require matrices of large size, and
more about linear algebra than we wish to use.)
An alternative to a representation is to look at the internal structure of the group. Can we
better understand how a group works by looking at its subgroups and how they are related?
The Chinese Remainder Theorem is a spectacular example of how this approach works for
rings (and hence abelian groups) of the form Zn. In this chapter we will examine how
groups can sometimes be thought of as a direct product of smaller pieces (or subgroups).
This chapter will provide only a small start on this approach, and we will explore more
sophisticated approaches in Chapters 28, 29, and 30.
We will discuss direct products ﬁrst.
23.1
Characterizing Direct Products
Let’s suppose that a group G is isomorphic to a direct product of the two groups H1 and
H2. In this section we would like to understand how we can tell this is true, by looking
inside the group G. Let’s suppose that
ϕ : H1 × H2 →G
is the isomorphism. Consider the two subgroups of the direct product
H1 × {1} = {(a, 1) : a ∈H1}
and
{1} × H2 = {(1, b) : b ∈H2}.
These subgroups are obviously isomorphic to H1 and H2, respectively.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
As we saw in Example 22.11, since the structure of the group G is essentially the same
as the structure of H1 × H2, G must have two corresponding subgroups: They are
G1 = ϕ(H1 × {1})
and
G2 = ϕ({1} × H2).
Can we characterize abstractly the fact that G is a direct product, in terms of the properties
of G1 and G2? It turns out we can, and we do this in the next theorem. But ﬁrst, let’s look
at an example.
Example 23.1
The group Z6 is isomorphic to the direct product Z3 ×Z2. (Of course, in this example
the group operation is addition.) The isomorphism is
ϕ([a]3, [b]2) = [4a + 3b]6.
(We have included the subscripts for emphasis, and will henceforth omit them.)
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this is a group isomorphism.

But then
G1 = ϕ(Z3 × {[0]}) = {0, 2, 4}, and
G2 = ϕ({[0]} × Z2) = {0, 3}.
We’ll return to this example when we have looked at our theorem.
To state our theorem conveniently, we need a little notation. If G1 and G2 are subgroups
of a group G, then
G1G2 = {g1g2 : g1 ∈G1, g2 ∈G2}.
That is, G1G2 consists of all possible products, where the ﬁrst factor comes from G1 and the
second factor comes from G2. Notice that G1G2 is a subset of the group G, but in general
it need not be a subgroup. (See Warmup Exercises b and c.)
Theorem 23.1
The Internal Characterization Theorem
The group G is isomorphic to H1 × H2 if and only if G has two subgroups G1 and G2, so
that
a. G1 is isomorphic to H1 and G2 is isomorphic to H2.
b. G = G1G2,
c. G1 ∩G2 = {1}, and
d. every element of G1 commutes with every element of G2.
Before we proceed, note that in Example 23.1 the properties (a), (b), (c), and (d) hold.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that properties (a), (b), (c), and (d) hold in this example.
(Remember that our operation is addition.) 
Proof:
We have two arguments to do. Suppose ﬁrst that G is isomorphic to the direct
product of H1 and H2, via the isomorphism ϕ, as above. As before, we can deﬁne subgroups
G1 and G2 and then part (a) is clearly satisﬁed.

Chapter 23: Structure and Representation
257
To check part (b), let g ∈G. Because the isomorphism ϕ is surjective, there exist h1 ∈H1
and h2 ∈H2 so that ϕ(h1, h2) = g. But then
g = ϕ((h1, 1)(1, h2)) = ϕ(h1, 1)ϕ(1, h2) ∈G1G2,
as required.
To check part (c), suppose that g ∈G1 ∩G2. Then g = ϕ(h1, 1), and g = ϕ(1, h2), for
some elements h1 ∈H1, and h2 ∈H2. But then
1 = ϕ(h1, 1)(ϕ(1, h2))−1 = ϕ(h1, h−1
2 ).
Because ϕ is injective, h1 = 1 and h2 = 1, and so g = 1 as required.
To check part (d), suppose that g1 ∈G1 and g2 ∈G2. Then g1 = ϕ(h1, 1) and g2 =
ϕ(1, h2). But such elements clearly commute.
 Quick Exercise.
Why do such elements commute? 
For the converse, suppose that G has two subgroups G1 and G2 as speciﬁed in parts (a)
to (d) above. We then deﬁne
ψ : G1 × G2 →G
by setting ψ(g1, g2) = g1g2. We claim that this is an isomorphism, thus proving the theorem.
But ψ is a homomorphism, because of part (d); ψ is onto, because of part (b); and ψ is
one-to-one, because of part (c). (You will check these three assertions in Exercise 3.)

 Quick Exercise.
Show that Z10 is isomorphic to Z2 × Z5, by using the two subgroups
⟨5⟩and ⟨2⟩, and the theorem. Hint: Examine Example 23.1.

Example 23.2
We work in the additive group of Gaussian integers Z[i]. Consider the inﬁnite cyclic
subgroups G1 = ⟨1⟩and G2 = ⟨i⟩. Given an arbitrary Gaussian integer a + bi, clearly
a ∈G1 and bi ∈G2, and so part (b) above is satisﬁed. And because a non-zero number
cannot be both real and imaginary, part (c) is satisﬁed as well. Part (d) holds because
the group is abelian. Thus, Z[i] is isomorphic as a group to G1 × G2, and hence to
Z × Z. (Of course, these are by no means isomorphic as rings.)
We call this the Internal Characterization Theorem because it tells us whether a given
group is isomorphic to a direct product, by looking only inside the group.
We can generalize the Internal Characterization Theorem to a direct product of any
ﬁnite number of groups. The proof of this is left as Exercise 8.
Theorem 23.2 The group G is isomorphic to H1 × H2 × · · · × Hn if and only if G has n
subgroups G1, . . . , Gn, so that
a. Gi is isomorphic to Hi for i = 1, . . . , n.
b. G = G1 · · · Gn,
c. Gi ∩Gj = {1} for all i ̸= j, and
d. every element of Gi commutes with every element of Gj for all i ̸= j.

Example 23.3
For an example of a non-abelian group that can be expressed as a direct product of
two subgroups, ﬁrst consider the group of matrices given in Example 19.15; let’s call
this group M. In Example 20.10, we discovered that M is isomorphic to the symmetric
group S3. Now consider the set of all 3 × 3 matrices

We now claim that G is isomorphic to the direct product G1 × G2. To show this, we
use the Internal Characterization Theorem 23.1.
 Quick Exercise.
Check each of four criteria we need.

Now the group G1 is isomorphic to Z2 (it is cyclic of order two), and G2 is isomorphic
to S3. We thus have that our group of matrices is isomorphic to Z2 × S3.
23.2
Cayley’s Theorem
We have seen earlier that groups of symmetries of many geometric ﬁgures are isomorphic
to some subgroup of a symmetric group Sn, for suitable choice of n. In this section we
will prove the surprising result that all ﬁnite groups can be thought of as a subgroup of
a symmetric group of permutations. In some sense, the symmetric groups Sn include all
of ﬁnite group theory. This result is Cayley’s theorem, and we will devote the rest of this
chapter to proving this.
We begin with a simple example, the cyclic group {1, a, a2} of order three. (Of course,
this is isomorphic to the additive group Z3, but we will ﬁnd it more convenient in this
discussion to use multiplicative notation.) We wish to show that this group is a group of
permutations of some set, that is, we claim it is a subgroup of Sn for some n. In fact, we will
represent the elements of this group as permutations of the set {1, a, a2} itself! Note that the
set of all permutations of any ﬁnite set with n elements is isomorphic to the corresponding
symmetric group Sn.
This can be rather confusing at times because we will be thinking of the elements of
{1, a, a2} as elements of the cyclic group, on the one hand, and as elements of the set to be
permuted, on the other. Consider the function
ϕa : {1, a, a2} →{1, a, a2}

Chapter 23: Structure and Representation
259
deﬁned by ϕa(x) = ax. That is, ϕa merely multiplies on the left by a. This means that
ϕa(1) = a,
ϕa(a) = a2,
ϕa(a2) = a3 = 1.
We could thus denote this function by
 1
a
a2
a
a2
1

.
In a similar fashion we can deﬁne ϕ1 and ϕa2, which can be represented as
 1
a
a2
1
a
a2

and
 1
a
a2
a2
1
a

.
Notice that the three functions ϕ1, ϕa, ϕa2 are all bijections deﬁned on the three-element
set {1, a, a2}. Of course, if we re-label this set as {1, 2, 3}, we can then identify these three
functions as permutations of {1, 2, 3}, that is, as elements of S3. Explicitly, if we re-label 1
as 1, a as 2, and a2 as 3, then
ϕ1 =

= (132).
We have demonstrated a means of associating with each element of the group {1, a, a2}
an element of S3. More generally, we wish to associate each element of a group that has n
elements with an element of Sn, in such a way that the group operation is preserved.
 Quick Exercise.
Multiply two elements of the group
{1, a, a2}.
Does the result correspond to the composition of the corresponding permutations of the
three-element set {1, a, a2}? 
With this example behind us, we are now ready to prove the general theorem:
Theorem 23.3
Cayley’s Theorem
Suppose that G is a ﬁnite group with n ele-
ments. Then G is isomorphic to a subgroup of Sn.
The idea of the proof that follows is actually very simple, but it is easy to get lost in
the forest of details! This proof is merely a more general version of the argument just given
for the cyclic group {1, a, a2}.
Proof:
Our goal is to assign to each element of the group G a permutation belonging to
Sn. What we will actually do is assign to each group element a permutation of the set G
itself. We will call the group of such permutations SG. But clearly Sn and SG are isomorphic
groups, and so this will be enough.
Because G has ﬁnitely many elements, we can label its elements as
G = {g1, g2, · · · , gn}.
In other words, we have listed the elements of G in some ﬁxed order.
For each integer i, we deﬁne a function
ϕi : G →G
by letting ϕi(gk) = gigk. That is, ϕi merely multiplies each element of G on the left by gi,
the ith element of G.

260
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
We will show that ϕi is a permutation of the elements of G. That is, we will show that
ϕi is a bijection.
ϕi is one-to-one: Suppose that ϕi(gk) = ϕi(gj). This means that gigk = gigj. But if we
multiply this equation on the left by g−1
i
, we see that gk = gj. Thus, ϕi is injective.
ϕi is onto: Actually, because the set in question (namely, G) is ﬁnite, and the function
is injective, we could conclude immediately that the function is surjective too, by using the
pigeonhole principle. However, for clarity we shall verify directly that ϕi is onto. For that
purpose, choose an arbitrary integer j, where 1 ≤j ≤n. The equation gix = gj has a
unique solution in G. Thus, there must be a k so that gigk = gj. But this evidently means
that ϕi(gk) = gj, and so ϕi is surjective.
Let’s denote by Φ the assignment gi 7−→ϕi. That is, Φ(gi) = ϕi. Because ϕi is a bijection
(and hence, a permutation of G), we have that Φ is a function from G into SG. We claim
now that this function translates the multiplication in G into the functional composition in
SG; that is, we claim that Φ is a homomorphism.
Φ is a homomorphism: We must show that
Φ(gigk) = Φ(gi) ◦Φ(gk).
Note that both Φ(gigk) and Φ(gi) ◦Φ(gk) are functions deﬁned on the set G. To show that
two functions are equal, we should check that they have the same value at a generic element
of their domain. So pick gm ∈G and compute:
Φ(gigk)(gm) = (gigk)gm = gi(gkgm) = gi(ϕk(gm)) =
ϕi(ϕk(gm)) = (Φ(gi) ◦Φ(gk))(gm),
which is what we required.
Finally, we require that Φ is an injection: So suppose that Φ(gi) = Φ(gk). Because Φ(gi)
and Φ(gk) are functions, they are equal if they do the same thing to every element of their
domain G. In particular, then, they must give the same element when applied to 1 ∈G.
But then gi · 1 = gk · 1, or gi = gk. Thus, Φ is one-to-one.
We have thus proved that G is isomorphic to the subgroup Φ(G) of the group of per-
mutations SG. Because SG is isomorphic to Sn, this completes the proof.

Cayley’s Theorem is usually not very practical for gaining insight into a particular group.
For example, if we were to apply it to a group with 8 elements, we would represent it as
a subgroup of S8, which has 8! = 40, 320 elements! Furthermore, if the original group is
abelian, we have then represented it as a subgroup of a highly non-abelian group. Nonethe-
less, the theoretical importance of Cayley’s Theorem should not be minimized.
We should perhaps remark that exactly the same proof as we gave above for Cayley’s
Theorem can be used for an inﬁnite group. This shows that any group whatsoever can be
represented as a subgroup of a group of permutations, only this time as permutations of an
inﬁnite set! In general, we will avoid groups of permutations of inﬁnite sets in this book.
Historical Remarks
Thus, in principle, to study ﬁnite groups we need only study groups of permutations. In the
19th century most group theorists did exactly that. Although the eminent British mathe-
matician Arthur Cayley had enunciated an abstract deﬁnition of group in 1853, it was a long
time before mathematicians felt comfortable working in an abstract and axiomatic context.
The study of ﬁnite groups had grown out of work by Lagrange (in the late 18th century)
and Galois (in the early 19th century) in studying the roots of polynomial equations. Their
insight into such roots was enlarged by thinking about permuting them; we will pick up this

Chapter 23: Structure and Representation
261
theme in Chapter 46. Afterward, the French mathematician Cauchy studied permutation
groups in their own right, and he introduced our 2 × n matrix notation for permutations.
Consequently, even when group theory had grown beyond the particular problems of La-
grange and Galois, the thought that it was still about permutations remained.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the idea of the direct product of groups, and characterized when
this happens, looking inside the given group. We needed to use the idea of group isomorphism
to do this. We also represented every ﬁnite group as a subgroup of a symmetric group Sn,
the set of all permutations of a set with n elements; this is called Cayley’s Theorem.

Chapter 24
Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem
In Chapter 22 we introduced the idea of group homomorphism. Let’s recall the corresponding
development that we followed after introducing the idea of ring homomorphism. We obtained
the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Rings 14.1, which asserts that knowing about
homomorphisms is equivalent to knowing about ideals: Each homomorphism gives rise to
an ideal (its kernel), and each ideal in turn gives rise to a homomorphism (of which it is
the kernel) to a ring of cosets. We would like to emulate this powerful and useful theory in
the theory of groups so that we can better understand group homomorphisms. This will be
the goal of the next three chapters.
24.1
Cosets
We begin this development by considering the notion of coset in the group context. In rings,
we started with an ideal and formed its cosets. In groups, we begin with a subgroup and
form its cosets.
Let G be a group (written multiplicatively), and suppose that H is a subgroup. For each
g ∈G, we form the set
Hg = {hg : h ∈H}.
We call such sets right cosets of H in G. We use the term right coset, because we are
multiplying by g on the right. In a non-abelian group, it might make a diﬀerence whether
we consider right cosets or left cosets. (We’ll come back to this topic later.) Note that if G
is an additive group, we would write such a coset as
H + g = {h + g : h ∈H}.
This is exactly the deﬁnition of coset we used in the case where G is a ring and H an ideal.
Let’s look at some examples, before we go any further:
Example 24.1
Consider the additive group Z and its cyclic subgroup ⟨4⟩. Then the sets
⟨4⟩+ 0, ⟨4⟩+ 1, ⟨4⟩+ 2, ⟨4⟩+ 3
are the distinct (right) cosets of ⟨4⟩in Z, just as in the ring context.
Of course, we can generate a long list of examples by referring back to ring theory by
our customary means: Forget the multiplication, and look at the additive group. But let’s
consider a purely group-theoretic example.

Example 24.2
Consider the subgroup H = {ι, (12)} of the symmetric group S3. We then obtain three
distinct right cosets as follows:
Hι = H(12) = {ι, (12)} = H,
H(123) = H(23) = {(123), (23)}, and
H(132) = H(13) = {(132), (13)}.
The subgroup H is obviously a coset of itself; we obtained this by choosing the two
elements in H itself. The other two cosets also have two elements each.

Verify that the cosets given above do indeed consist of the
elements listed. 
Example 24.3
Let’s compute the right cosets of the subgroup
K = {ι, (123), (132)}
in the same group S3. This time we obtain
Kι = K(123) = K(132) = {ι, (123), (132)}, and
K(12) = K(13) = K(23) = {(12), (13), (23)}.
Once again K is a coset of itself and there is one other coset, which also has three
elements.

Let’s compute the right cosets of the subgroup H = {1, 4, 16}: We obtain
H1 = H4 = H16 = {1, 4, 16},
H2 = H8 = H11 = {2, 8, 11},
H10 = H13 = H19 = {10, 13, 19}, and
H5 = H20 = H17 = {5, 20, 17}.

Chapter 24: Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem
267
24.2
Lagrange’s Theorem
The examples from ﬁnite group theory that we have looked at are very suggestive. In each
case, all the cosets of a given subgroup are the same size, and this allows us to decompose
the group into ﬁnitely many pairwise disjoint pieces of the same size. This observation, when
made precise, is a very valuable tool for counting in ﬁnite groups; it is called Lagrange’s
Theorem. Before obtaining Lagrange’s Theorem, we need to make precise the observations
we’ve made about cosets. We here prove the Coset Theorem for groups, which is directly
analogous to the Coset Theorem 13.1 for rings.
Theorem 24.1
The Coset Theorem
Let H be a subgroup of a group G, and a, b ∈
G. Then
a. If Ha ⊆Hb, then Ha = Hb.
b. If Ha ∩Hb ̸= ∅, then Ha = Hb.
c. Ha = Hb if and only if ab−1 ∈H.
d. There exists a bijection between any two right cosets Ha and Hb. Thus, if H has
ﬁnitely many elements, every right coset has that same number of elements.
Proof:
(a): Suppose that H is a subgroup of the group G, and a and b are elements of
the group for which Ha ⊆Hb. Then
a = 1a ∈Ha ⊆Hb,
and so there exists h ∈H such that a = hb. But then b = h−1a ∈Ha. Now, if k ∈H,
kb = kh−1a ∈Ha, and so Hb ⊆Ha. That is, Ha = Hb.
(b): Suppose that Ha ∩Hb ̸= ∅. Choose c in this intersection. Then c ∈Ha, and so
Hc ⊆Ha. But then by part (a), Hc = Ha. But similarly, Hc = Hb, and so Ha = Hb.
(c): If Ha = Hb, then a = 1a ∈Ha = Hb, and so there exists h ∈H such that a = hb.
But then ab−1 = h ∈H, as required. Conversely, if ab−1 ∈H, then a = ab−1b ∈Hb. But
then a ∈Ha ∩Hb, and so by part (b) Ha = Hb.
(d): Deﬁne the function ϕ : Ha →Hb by ϕ(x) = xa−1b. First, note that if x ∈Ha, then
x = ha, for h ∈H. But then ϕ(x) = ϕ(ha) = (ha)(a−1b) = hb ∈Hb. Thus, our function is
well deﬁned. It is one-to-one, because if ϕ(x) = ϕ(y), then xa−1b = ya−1b, and multiplying
on the right by b−1a gives us that x = y. It is onto, because if we choose the arbitrary
element hb ∈Hb, then ϕ(ha) = ha(a−1b) = hb.
For ﬁnite sets, a bijection establishes that two sets have the same number of elements.
And because H = H1 is itself a right coset, all right cosets have the same size as H.
2
If we had deﬁned left cosets instead as gH = {gh : h ∈H}, we could have easily
formulated an analogous theorem for left cosets; indeed all of the theory of this chapter
would carry over with minor changes. You can pursue this approach in Exercises 3–5 below.
We will return to left cosets in the next chapter.
We now introduce some notation, which allows us to state Lagrange’s Theorem conve-
niently. If X is a ﬁnite set, let |X| be the number of elements in X. For a group G, we call
|G| its order. If G is a ﬁnite group with subgroup H, we let [G : H] denote the number of
distinct right cosets of H in G, called the index of H in G.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 24.5
Let’s consider the group G = U(Z21) and the subgroup H = {1, 4, 16} as in Example
24.4. Then |H| = 3. Note that part (d) of the Coset Theorem tells us that |Ha| = 3 for
any right coset Ha. Of course, we computed the right cosets explicitly above and saw
that this is so. Finally, those computations show us that [G : H] = 4. Note that there
are 12 elements in G altogether (that is, |G| = 12), and we can arrive at this number
by counting 4 cosets, each with 3 elements.
 Quick Exercise.
Repeat this reasoning for Examples 24.2 and 24.3 above. 
Let’s now state the general theorem reﬂected in these examples:
Theorem 24.2
Lagrange’s Theorem
Let G be a ﬁnite group with subgroup H.
Then
|G| = [G : H]|H|.
In particular, this means that |H| divides |G|.
Proof:
Suppose that [G : H] = m. Every element of G is in a coset of H, and part (b) of
the Coset Theorem tells us we can decompose G into a union of m pairwise disjoint cosets:
G = H ∪Ha1 ∪Ha2 ∪· · · ∪Ham−1.
But each of these cosets has |H| elements. Thus, there must be [G : H]|H| elements in G
altogether.

Lagrange did his work well before the notion of group had been deﬁned. But he is
honored for the theorem named after him because he applied a concrete version of this
theorem in his arguments regarding permutations of the roots of a polynomial equation.
24.3
Applications of Lagrange’s Theorem
Lagrange’s Theorem is a very important one in the theory of ﬁnite groups. It places great
restrictions on the sort of elements and the sort of subgroups a ﬁnite group can have. We
make one such inference immediately:

Chapter 24: Cosets and Lagrange’s Theorem
269
Corollary 24.3 Let G be a ﬁnite group, and g ∈G. Then the order of g divides the order
of G.
Proof:
Consider the cyclic subgroup ⟨g⟩of G generated by g. If the order of g is n, then
this subgroup has n elements. By Lagrange’s Theorem, n must divide |G|.
2
Thus, no group of order 15 could possibly have elements of order 2 or 6.
 Quick Exercise.
What are the orders of the elements in S4? Do all these orders divide
4! = 24?

Let’s apply this reasoning in the case where the number of elements in a group is a prime
p. Now the only positive divisors of the prime p are 1 and p itself. Of course, every group
has exactly one element of order 1: the identity. Thus, every other element of the group
has order p. But this means that in a group with prime order, every non-identity element
has that prime order. And so, the group must be cyclic! (In fact, it is cyclic where every
non-identity element generates the group; see also Exercise 21.16.)
Corollary 24.4 Every group of prime order is cyclic.
It is important to note that the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is false. That is, suppose
that G is a ﬁnite group with n elements, and m is a divisor of n. We cannot infer that G
has a subgroup with exactly m elements. (This statement is true for abelian groups; we will
meet this as Theorem 29.10.) Here is an example that shows this is true; we prove that the
example works, as another application of Lagrange’s Theorem:
Example 24.6
Consider the 12 element subgroup of S4 we called A4 in Example 20.11. Recall that
the elements of this group are
ι, (123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143),
(234), (243), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
If the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem were true, then A4 would have a subgroup H
with six elements. By Lagrange’s Theorem, this subgroup would have only two distinct
cosets. Now pick any element α of A4 with order 3. Because H has only two distinct
cosets, at least two of the cosets Hι, Hα, and Hα2 must be the same. But then, by
the Coset Theorem, α ∈H.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
So all the elements of A4 with order 3 belong to the subgroup H. But there are eight
such elements, which must all belong to a subgroup with six elements. This contradic-
tion implies that A4 has no subgroup with six elements. (This elegant argument is due
to Joseph Gallian.) For a more computational proof of this result, see Exercise 19.
We can however prove a very limited converse to Lagrange’s Theorem, which asserts
that prime divisors of the order of a ﬁnite group do lead to subgroups of that order; this
is called Cauchy’s Theorem. This result is a ﬁrst important step towards several theorems
that demonstrate the existence of certain subgroups in any ﬁnite group, and also count
how many such subgroups are possible. These results are called the Sylow Theorems; we
will pursue these ideas a good bit further in Chapters 28 and 29. The proof we oﬀer here
of Cauchy’s Theorem is a clever one due to James McKay, based on counting a set in two
diﬀerent ways.

270
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Theorem 24.5
Cauchy’s Theorem
Suppose that p is a prime integer, G is a
group, and p divides |G|. Then G has an element of order p (and so a subgroup of or-
der p).
Proof:
Consider the set S of all lists a1, a2, · · · , ap, where each ai ∈G, and a1a2 · · · ap = 1.
Note that we are allowing for repetitions in the ai’s, and in fact, we are hoping exactly to
ﬁnd an element (other than the identity) of S for which all the entries are the same; this
will give us the required element of G with order p.
We are going to count the number of elements in S. Pick any element of S. For each
entry in this list (until the last one), we can choose any element of the group; but the last
entry in the list is required to be (a1a2 · · · ap−1)−1. This means that S has exactly |G|p−1
elements.
We will now recount this set. Given a list a1, a2, · · · , ap, consider what happens when
we cyclicly permute it. That is, we consider lists of the form ak, ak+1, · · · , ap, a1, · · · , ak−1.
First of all, note that these permuted lists remain in S.
 Quick Exercise.
Why must these permuted lists remain in S? 
Second, if at least two of the ai’s are distinct, we obtain a total of p lists from the original
one (counting the original when we perform the “trivial” cyclic permutation). However, if all
of the ai’s are the same, we do not obtain any new lists. We can thus partition the elements
of the set S into the subsets consisting of a given element and the other lists resulting from
its cyclic permutations. Some of these subsets have p elements in them, while some have
only 1 element in them, depending on whether any of the elements in one of the lists are
distinct, or not. Those are the only two possibilities.
We now count the elements in S, by counting the number of elements in each of these
subsets, and adding them up. So, let m be the number of these subsets with 1 element in
them, and let n be the number of these subsets with p elements. This means that a complete
count of all elements in S is given by m · 1 + n · p. Thus |G|p−1 = m + np.
Notice that m > 0, because there is at least one element (namely 1) that when multiplied
by itself p times gives 1. We will have completed the proof of the theorem if we can conclude
that m > 1.
We now ﬁnally use the hypothesis of the theorem (that p divides |G|) to conclude that
p divides m. Since m > 0, this means that m ≥p > 1. This proves the theorem.
2
Example 24.7
Suppose G is a group with 606 elements. Then Cayley’s Theorem tells us that G
necessarily has elements of orders 2, 3, and 101.
We shall now use Lagrange’s Theorem to determine the number of distinct groups of
small size. Notice ﬁrst that because all cyclic groups of a given order are isomorphic, there
is essentially only one group of order 2, 3, 5, etc.: Namely, the cyclic groups
Z2, Z3, Z5, · · · .
Let’s take the smallest non-prime integer 4: What sort of groups of order 4 are there?
Of course, there is Z4, the cyclic group of order 4. Are there any others?
If a group G has order 4 and is not cyclic, then every non-identity element in the group
must be of order 2 (because only 1, 2, and 4 divide 4). Choose two of these elements, and
call them a and b. Each is its own inverse (that’s what being of order 2 means). So ab has to
be the third non-identity element; but so does ba, and so ab = ba. (Note that Exercise 19.8
also implies that ab = ba.) Thus, we conjecture that the multiplication table for G must
look like this:

To show this is a group, we need to verify that it satisﬁes all the group axioms. The most
tedious of these is associativity. But, more easily, we see that this is just a multiplicative
version of the (additive) group Z2 ×Z2. This group is often called the Klein Four Group.
 Quick Exercise.
Establish an explicit isomorphism between the multiplicative and
the additive representations we have given for the Klein Four Group. 
So we have concluded that there are essentially only two groups of order 4: the cyclic group
and the Klein Four Group.
There’s only one group of order 5 (because 5 is prime). But what about groups of order
6? If such a group had an element of order 6, it would be cyclic. So in a non-cyclic group of
order 6, all non-identity elements must be of order 2 or 3. By Cauchy’s Theorem we know
that any such group must have at least one element a with order 3, and at least one element
b of order 2. Then 1, a, a2, b are all distinct elements of the group; note that a2 ̸= b, because
a2 also has order 3. We now claim that if we add the elements ab and a2b to this list, we will
have a complete list of all elements in the group. To show all of these elements are distinct,
let’s examine a couple of typical cases. If we suppose that ab = 1, then a−1 = a2 = b,
which we have already concluded is impossible. And if ab = a2, then b = a, which is clearly
impossible.
 Quick Exercise.
Finish checking that each of these elements is distinct from each of
the others. 
We thus have that our group consists of the set {1, a, a2, b, ab, a2b}. But obviously ba
must be an element too. It is easy to check that the only possibilities for this element are
ab and a2b. If ba = ab, then the group is abelian, and the element ab is an element of order
6.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that ab is a generator in this case, either by direct calculation
or else by using Exercise 21.6. 
So the only remaining case is if ba = a2b. It follows from this that ba2 = a2ba = a4b = ab.
Is there such a group? Of course! This is exactly S3 (where (123) could play the role of a,
and (12) could play the role of b).
We have thus concluded that there are essentially only two groups of order 6: Z6 and
S3. Note that this makes S3 the non-abelian group with smallest order.
You will inquire in Exercises 11 and 12 into the groups of order 8. It turns out that there
are ﬁve of them.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the notion of right coset for a subgroup of a group. We determined
that the set of right cosets of a subgroup divides the group into pairwise disjoint pieces,
each of the same size. In the context of ﬁnite groups, this leads to the counting theorem
known as Lagrange’s Theorem. Lagrange’s Theorem allows us to prove that the order of an
element divides the order of the group, and that all groups of prime order are cyclic.

Case 1: There is an element of order 8.
Case 2: If there is no element of order 8, but there is an element a of order 4, choose
an element b outside ⟨a⟩. Now, either you can ﬁnd such a b of order 2 or else all such b
have order 4. If you can ﬁnd such a b of order 2, then, depending on whether a and b
commute, argue that we must obtain either Z2 × Z4 or D4. Now assume that all such
b have order 4. Argue that you must obtain the quaternions Q8.
Case 3: Now suppose that there are no elements of order 4. So, all non-identity el-
ements have order 2. First, argue that the group must be abelian. Then, pick three
elements of order 2 and argue that you must obtain Z2 × Z2 × Z2.
13. Show that every non-identity element of a group generates the group if and only if
the group is cyclic of prime order. (This extends and strengthens Exercise 21.16.)
14. Let n be a positive integer and 1 ≤k ≤n. Consider the stabilizer subgroup Stab(k)
of Sn. (See Exercise 23.14.) What does Lagrange’s Theorem say about [Sn : Stab(k)]?
Demonstrate this explicitly, by placing the set of right cosets of Stab(k) into a natural
one-to-one correspondence with {1, 2, · · · , n}.
15.
(a) Suppose G is a ﬁnite group and a ∈G. Show that a|G| = 1.
(b) Now provide another proof for Fermat’s Little Theorem 8.7: If p is prime and
0 < x < p, then xp−1 ≡1 (mod p).
(c) For any positive integer n, φ(n) is deﬁned to be the number of positive integers
less than n that are also relatively prime to n. (This is called Euler’s phi
function.) So, φ(6) = 2 because only 1 and 5 are less than 6 and also relatively
prime to 6. Note that if p is prime, φ(p) = p −1. Show that if a is relatively
prime to n, then
aφ(n) = 1 (mod n).
This generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem 8.7 is called Euler’s Theorem.
16. Refer to the deﬁnition in Exercise 15 of Euler’s phi function.
(a) Compute φ(7), φ(20), and φ(100).
(b) Use Euler’s Theorem to eﬃciently compute
238(mod 7),
1718(mod 20),
782(mod 100).
17. Prove that the set of (right) cosets of the subgroup Z in R can be placed in a one-to-one
correspondence with the set of real numbers x, with 0 ≤x < 1.

18. Consider the group S, the unit circle, a multiplicative subgroup of C∗. Provide a
simple condition on complex numbers α, β characterizing when the cosets Sα and Sβ
are equal, and prove that it works.
19. In this exercise you will obtain a more computational proof of the fact discussed in
Example 24.6, that there is no subgroup of order 6 in the group A4. We suppose by
way of contradiction that there is such a subgroup called H.
(a) Why does H have an element of order 3 and an element of order 2?
(b) Why can we assume without loss of generality that the element of order 3 has
the form (abc) and the element of order 2 either had form (ab)(cd) or (ac)(bd)?
(c) Now do computations with these elements to conclude that H must have more
than 6 elements.
20. Let G be a ﬁnite group with g ∈G. Recall from Exercise 20.15 the subgroup C(g), the
centralizer of g. Recall also that a conjugate of g is an element of the form hgh−1, for
h ∈G; see Exercise 22.15. Prove that the number of distinct conjugates of g is equal
to [G : C(g)]. Hint: Show that the mapping taking hgh−1 to the left coset hC(g) is
well-deﬁned and bijective.

Chapter 25
Groups of Cosets
Our goal now is to place a group structure on the set of right cosets of a subgroup of a
given group, just as we did for the cosets of an ideal in a given ring. Given a group G with
a subgroup H, our experience with ring theory would suggest that the group operation on
the set of cosets should be deﬁned like this:
(Ha)(Hb) = Hab.
That is, to multiply two cosets, pick a representative of each, multiply them together, and
then form its coset. It is clear that we must prove that this operation is well deﬁned. (That
is, it should be independent of the coset representative chosen.)
Before proceeding, let’s look at an example of this; we return to Example 24.2. Let’s try
multiplying the cosets
H(123) = H(23) = {(123), (23)}, and
H(132) = H(13) = {(132), (13)},
using our provisional deﬁnition. If our deﬁnition is to work, and we compute the product of
any element from the ﬁrst coset, times any element of the second coset, we should always
land in the same coset. In this case there are four possible products:
(123)(132) = ι, (23)(132) = (12),
(123)(13) = (23), and (23)(13) = (123).
These elements do not all belong to the same coset! (Because, among other reasons, there
are four distinct elements obtained and a coset of H must have only two elements.) Conse-
quently, it does not seem that here we can make a group out of the set of right cosets of H
in G.
25.1
Left Cosets
Let’s beat a strategic retreat and return to a notion that we left behind in the previous
chapter: There we deﬁned right cosets. But as we pointed out in Section 24.2, we could have
looked at left cosets instead. Given a subgroup H of a group G, a left coset of H in G is
a set of the form
gH = {gh : h ∈H}.
Let’s compute the left cosets for the subgroups H and K of S3. We computed their right
cosets in Examples 24.2 and 24.3, and you computed their left cosets if you did Exercises
24.6 and 24.7.
275

276
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 25.1
(See Example 24.2 and Exercise 24.6.) We still obtain exactly 3 distinct cosets; this
time they are
ιH = (12)H = {ι, (12)},
(123)H = (13)H = {(123), (13)}, and
(132)H = (23)H = {(132), (23)}.
Example 25.2
(See Example 24.3 and Exercise 24.7.) We still obtain exactly 2 distinct cosets; this
time they are
ιK = (123)K = (132)K = {ι, (123), (132)}, and
(12)K = (13)K = (23)K = {(12), (13), (23)}.
A comparison of these two examples reveals a real diﬀerence! For K, each of its left
cosets is equal to the corresponding right coset, while this is false for H. Of course, if the
group had been abelian, then the left and right cosets would obviously be equal, because
multiplying on the left, or on the right, amounts to the same thing in an abelian group.
And we know that coset addition works for rings. This suggests that this property might be
of importance. In fact, it turns out to be exactly what we need to build a group of cosets.
25.2
Normal Subgroups
Let H be a subgroup of the group G. We say that H is a normal subgroup if gH = Hg,
for all g ∈G. If H is a normal subgroup, we can safely talk about its cosets (without an
adjective). We denote the set of all these cosets by G/H.
Example 25.3
The subgroup ⟨(123)⟩is a normal subgroup of S3, while the subgroup ⟨(12)⟩isn’t.
Example 25.4
Every subgroup of an abelian group is normal.
In the next two chapters we will eventually obtain a host of examples of normal sub-
groups, but it’s now time for the theorem we have been building up to. This is the group
analogue of Theorem 13.2, where the idea of normal subgroup plays the role analogous to
ideal in a ring.
Theorem 25.1 Let H be a normal subgroup of G. Then the set G/H of cosets of H in G
is a group, under the operation
(Ha)(Hb) = Hab.

Chapter 25: Groups of Cosets
277
Proof:
We must ﬁrst check that the operation speciﬁed in the statement of the theorem
is well deﬁned; that is, it should be independent of coset representatives. This veriﬁcation
is the crucial part of the proof and will depend in an essential way on the fact that H is
normal.
Suppose then that Ha = Hc and Hb = Hd. We claim that Hab = Hcd. By Theorem
24.1c, this amounts to checking that ab(cd)−1 ∈H. Because Hb = Hd, we know that
bd−1 ∈H. Now H is a normal subgroup, and so aH = Ha. This means that
a(bd−1) = ha
for some h ∈H. Thus,
ab(cd)−1 = abd−1c−1 = hac−1.
But Ha = Hc means exactly that ac−1 ∈H, and so therefore hac−1 ∈H too. This
completes the proof that the operation is well deﬁned.
The operation is clearly associative:
(HaHb)(Hc) = HabHc = H(ab)c = Ha(bc) = HaHbc = Ha(HbHc).
The element H1 serves as the identity for G/H:
H1Ha = H1a = Ha = Ha1 = HaH1.
And the element Ha has an inverse; namely, Ha−1:
HaHa−1 = Haa−1 = H1 = Ha−1a = Ha−1Ha.
Thus, G/H is a group, as we claim.
2
The proof of this theorem is more complicated than that for the corresponding ring
theorem, because the group need not be abelian. The crucial point in the proof is showing
that the operation on G/H is well deﬁned. Loosely speaking, the normality of H says that
elements of G commute with H (but not necessarily with the individual elements of H),
and this is just enough to make the argument work.
We call G/H the group of cosets of G modulo H; we also call G/H a quotient
group.
We have encountered many examples of this construction already: Merely take a ring of
cosets as we discussed in Chapter 13 and thereafter, and forget the multiplicative structure.
However, these examples do not call suﬃcient attention to the importance of the normality
of the subgroup, because, as we’ve pointed out before, all subgroups of an abelian group are
normal. Consequently, we must examine some purely group-theoretic examples, involving
some non-abelian groups.
Before we do this, however, we will provide a characterization of normality that is
slightly easier to work with. We will inquire further into this version of normality in the
exercises, and in future chapters. For the moment, we view the following proposition only
as a computational aid to checking normality.
Theorem 25.2 Let H be a subgroup of the group G. Then H is normal in G if and only
if g−1Hg = H, for all g ∈G. In fact, this is true if and only if g−1Hg ⊆H, for all g ∈G.
Proof:
Suppose that H is normal in G and g ∈G; then Hg = gH. So for any h ∈H,
there exists h1 ∈H such that hg = gh1. But then g−1hg = h1 ∈H. Thus, g−1Hg ⊆H. A
very similar argument, which we save for Exercise 1, shows that the reverse inclusion also
holds.

278
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Conversely, suppose that g−1Hg = H for all g ∈G. Given any element h ∈H, this
means that h = g−1h1g, for some h1 ∈H. But then gh = h1g; that is, gH ⊆Hg. You will
prove the reverse inclusion in Exercise 2.
If g−1Hg ⊆H for all g, this applies to g−1 as well: That is, gHg−1 ⊆H. But this latter
statement means that H ⊆g−1Hg, and so these two sets are actually equal.

25.3
Examples of Groups of Cosets
Example 25.5
Consider the group A4 from Example 20.11:
A4 = {ι, (234), (243), (143), (134), (124), (142),
(132), (123), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.
Consider the subgroup
H = {ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.
Notice that H is a group with four elements that is not cyclic; that is, H is isomorphic
to the Klein Four Group (see the discussion in Section 24.3). We claim that H is
normal. Let’s perform a few of the computations necessary to check this:
(132)−1(12)(34)(132) = (123)(12)(34)(132) = (14)(23),
(243)−1(12)(34)(243) = (234)(12)(34)(243) = (13)(24),
(124)−1(13)(24)(124) = (142)(13)(24)(124) = (12)(34).
In each case, we see that an element of the form β−1αβ, where β ∈A4 and α ∈H,
remains in H. It would be tedious indeed to check all the other cases!
 Quick Exercise.
Perform two more of the required calculations. 
In Exercise 25.16 you will provide a complete proof that H is normal in A4, cleverer
than just verifying all the cases. We will also return to considering the normality of H
in Example 26.5. For the moment, we shall accept that this is true.
We can thus construct the group A4/H. Let’s use Lagrange’s Theorem 24.2 to
determine the size of this group. The order of A4 is 12, while the order of H is 4. Thus,
the order of A4/H must be 12/4 = 3. But there is essentially only one group of order
3, the cyclic group. Let’s write out the elements of this group of cosets, and see why
it should be isomorphic to Z3:
A4/H = {ι, H(123), H(132)}.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that these three cosets are distinct, and so this list is
really a complete list of the elements of A4/H. 
But now it is clear that A4/H is a cyclic group generated by H(123).

Chapter 25: Groups of Cosets
279
Example 25.6
Consider now the group G = U(M2(R)) of 2 × 2 invertible matrices. Recall that this
consists of those matrices with non-zero determinant. (See Exercise 8.2.) Now consider
the set
H = {A ∈G : det(A) = 1}.
First note that this is a subgroup. (You actually showed this in Exercise 20.18.) Given
A, B ∈H, we need to check that AB−1 ∈H. But
det(AB−1) = det(A)(det(B))−1 = 1 · 1 = 1.
This shows that H is a subgroup.
Furthermore, we claim that H is a normal subgroup. Because, given A ∈H and
C ∈G, we claim that C−1AC ∈H. But
det(C−1AC) = (det(C))−1 det(A) det(C) = det(A) = 1.
This shows that H is normal.
We thus know that G/H is a group. Let’s see if we can determine the nature of
this group. Let’s look at a particular coset HA. A typical element of this coset looks
like BA, where det(B) = 1. But
det(BA) = det(B) det(A) = det(A).
Thus, all elements of HA have the same determinant. In fact, we claim that HA consists
exactly of all those matrices with determinant equal to the non-zero real number det A.
To see this, suppose that C ∈G, and det(C) = det(A); we claim that C ∈HA. But
C = CA−1A, and det(CA−1) = 1, and so C ∈HA.
We thus have established a bijection between the elements of the group G/H and
the non-zero real numbers. This suggests the possibility that G/H is isomorphic to R∗,
the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers. We could prove this now but will
instead wait until the next chapter, when we can prove this carefully, and easily, using
the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Groups 26.4; see Example 26.8.
We can much enlarge our fund of examples, by showing that in the special case when a
subgroup has index 2 in the group, it is automatically normal:
Theorem 25.3
Index 2 Theorem
Suppose that G is a group with subgroup H, and
[G : H] = 2. Then H is a normal subgroup of G, and G/H is isomorphic to Z2.
Proof:
Suppose that H is a subgroup of G and [G : H] = 2. This means that there are
only two right cosets of H in G: We can write these two cosets as H1 and Hg, where g is
any element of G that does not belong to H. But by Lagrange’s Theorem 24.2 and Exercise
24.5, there can also be only two left cosets of H, and they must be of the form 1H and gH.
But because H1 = H = 1H, this means that Hg = gH, for all g /∈H. In other words, H is
normal in G.
Because [G : H] = 2, we know that G/H is a group with two elements and there is only
one such group (up to isomorphism), namely, Z2.
2
Example 25.7
Consider again the group A4, this time as a subgroup of S4. This subgroup has 12
elements, and so its index in S4 is 2. Theorem 25.3 then implies that A4 is a normal
subgroup of S4.

Exercises
Example 25.8
Consider the dihedral group Dn, where we will here use the notation introduced in
Exercise 20.29. The cyclic subgroup ⟨R⟩is clearly the subgroup of rotations in Dn and
has n elements. But because Dn has 2n elements, ⟨R⟩is a normal subgroup of Dn.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned a normal subgroup and proved that if a subgroup is normal, then
a group structure can be given to the set of cosets, which we then call a quotient group.
Warm-up Exercises
a. Given a subgroup H of a group G, at least one left coset of H always equals its
corresponding right coset. Why?
b. Why is every subgroup normal, if the group is abelian? (The converse is false; see
Exercise 10 below.)
c. If H is a normal subgroup of the group G, and [G : H] = 7, to what group is G/H
necessarily isomorphic?
d. The ring Z is a subring of R but is not an ideal. (Why?) We thus were unable to form
the ring of cosets R/Z. But Z is clearly a normal subgroup, and so we are able to form
the group of cosets R/Z. Explain this.
e. Show that {1} is a normal subgroup of any multiplicative group G.
f. Consider the set
K = {A ∈U(M2(R)) : det(A) = 3}.
By using an argument just like that in Example 25.6, it is easy to see that if A ∈K,
then C−1AC ∈K, for all matrices C ∈U(M2(R)). Does this make K a normal
subgroup of U(M2(R))? (Be careful!)

rings should suggest the appropriate approach. See Exercise 26.4.

quaternions, see Exercise 21.12.)
11. Consider the subgroup H = {1, −1} of Q8. In the previous exercise, you showed that
H is a normal subgroup of Q8. Give the group table for Q8/H. To what group is this

12. Consider the group of cosets R∗/Q∗. Exhibit an element of this group with order 2.
What about an element of order n, for any positive integer n? Do you believe that
there are elements of inﬁnite order in this group? (You should be able to conjecture
an element that works, but you will not be able to prove this rigorously.)

Let HK = {hk : h ∈H, k ∈K}. (Note that we deﬁned the product of two subgroups

group if and only if g−1h−1gh ∈H, for all g, h ∈G. Note: Elements of the form
g−1h−1gh are called commutators in the group G.
19. We generalize Exercise 18 slightly. Given a group G, deﬁne H to be the smallest
subgroup of G that contains all the commutators. The subgroup H is called the
commutator subgroup. Argue that H consists of all ﬁnite products of commutators.
For a normal subgroup K of G, prove that G/K is abelian if and only if K ⊇H.

Chapter 26
The Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
In this chapter we prove the Isomorphism Theorem for Groups, the important theorem
analogous to the ring theory result we obtained in Chapter 14. The ring theory theorem
asserts that knowing about ideals is essentially the same as knowing about ring homo-
morphisms. We will establish a similar connection between normal subgroups and group
homomorphisms.
26.1
The Kernel
Let’s begin with a homomorphism ϕ : G →H between the groups G and H. By way of
analogy with ring theory, we deﬁne the kernel of ϕ to be
ker(ϕ) = {g ∈G : ϕ(g) = 1}.
We can express this colloquially: The kernel of ϕ is the set of elements in G that are sent to
the identity in H by ϕ. We can use a slightly diﬀerent notation to emphasize the deﬁnition
of the kernel. It is the pre-image of the identity; that is,
ker(ϕ) = ϕ−1(1).
The following theorem should not be a surprise:
Theorem 26.1 Let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism between the groups G and H. Then
ker(ϕ) is a normal subgroup of G.
Proof:
To show that ker(ϕ) is a subgroup, choose two elements a, b ∈ker(ϕ); we must
show that ab−1 is in the kernel (by the Subgroup Theorem 20.2). To show this, we compute:
ϕ
 ab−1
= ϕ(a)(ϕ(b))−1 = 1.
That is, ab−1 ∈ker(ϕ).
To show that ker(ϕ) is normal, we must choose an arbitrary element g ∈G, and check
that
g−1 ker(ϕ)g ⊆ker(ϕ)
(by Theorem 25.2). For that purpose, choose a ∈ker(ϕ), and compute again:
ϕ
 g−1ag

= (ϕ(g))−1ϕ(a)ϕ(g) = (ϕ(g))−11ϕ(g) = 1.
That is, g−1ag ∈ker(ϕ), as required.

Review several of the examples of kernels of ring homomorphisms,
discussed in Chapter 12. 
Next, let’s compute the kernels of a number of the homomorphisms in the examples in
Chapter 22.
Example 26.1
(Example 22.3) Consider the function ρ : Z →Z that multiplies elements by 3. The
equation ρ(n) = 3n = 0 has only one solution, and so the kernel is {0}, which is
evidently a normal subgroup.
Example 26.2
(Example 22.4) Consider the logarithm function log : R+ →R. The equation log(r) =
0 has a unique solution, and so again the kernel here is the trivial subgroup, this time
written multiplicatively: {1}.
Example 26.3
(Example 22.5) Consider the determinant function
det : U(M2(R)) →R∗.
Here, the kernel is the subgroup
H = {A ∈U(M2(R)) : det(A) = 1}.
It is diﬃcult to describe the subgroup H more succinctly. But note that it has inﬁnitely
many elements.
 Quick Exercise.
Provide 4 distinct matrices belonging to H. 
By Theorem 26.1, H is normal; in Example 25.6 we showed directly that this is the
case. We will return to this example yet again, later in this chapter.
Example 26.4
(Example 22.6) Consider the homomorphism ϕ : D3 →{1, −1} that takes the rotations
{1, ρ, ρ2} to 1, and the remaining elements (the ﬂips) to −1. Obviously, the kernel is
the subgroup ⟨ρ⟩. According to Theorem 26.1, this is a normal subgroup.
Example 26.5
(Example 22.7) Consider the homomorphism Φ : G →Z3, where G is the group of
symmetries of the tetrahedron. (We’ve seen in Example 20.11 that G is (isomorphic
to) the group A4.) If you check the discussion in Example 22.7, it is obvious that the
kernel is
{ι, ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3}.
In Example 25.5 we started to verify that this subgroup (or rather, the corresponding
subgroup of the corresponding group of permutations) is normal, by brute force. It
follows easily here, now that we note that it is the kernel of a homomorphism. (If you
did Exercise 25.16, you obtained another proof that this subgroup is normal.)

(Example 22.8) Consider the diﬀerentiation function D : R[x] →R[x]. The kernel
consists of exactly those polynomials whose derivative is the zero polynomial. That is,
the kernel consists of the constant polynomials:
ker(D) = R ⊆R[x].
Example 26.7
(Examples 22.11 and 22.12) The kernel of the embedding homomorphism ϵ : G →
G×H deﬁned by ϵ(g) = (g, 1) is the trivial subgroup of G. The kernel of the projection
homomorphism π : G × H →G deﬁned by π(g, h) = g is the subgroup
{1} × H = {(1, h) : h ∈H}.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that the kernels of this example are what is claimed.
Check directly that these are normal subgroups (or see Exercise 25.9). 
26.2
Cosets of the Kernel
The kernel contains indirectly more information than just the pre-image of the identity.
Just as for rings, we have:
Theorem 26.2 Let ϕ : G →H be a homomorphism between the groups G and H. Then
ϕ−1(h) equals the coset ker(ϕ)g, where g is any given element of ϕ−1(h).
Proof:
This is left for you to prove, using the proof of the corresponding ring result
(Theorem 12.2) as a model; see Exercise 6.
2
An important special consequence of this theorem follows in the case when the kernel is
the trivial subgroup. In that case, every inverse image of the homomorphism consists of a
single element. In other words, the homomorphism in question is injective. This is directly
analogous to the results for rings (Corollary 12.4).
Corollary 26.3 A group homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel is the trivial
subgroup.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this corollary for each of the examples above. 
We now know that each group homomorphism leads to a normal subgroup, namely, its
kernel. But each normal subgroup likewise leads to a homomorphism (of which it is the
kernel). This requires another deﬁnition, again analogous to the ring case:
Let H be a normal subgroup of the group G. Then form the group of cosets G/H.
Consider the function
ν : G →G/H
deﬁned by ν(g) = Hg. It is quite evident (from the deﬁnition of the group operation on
G/H) that this is a homomorphism, that its kernel is exactly H, and that it is surjective.
(See Exercise 3.)
We call ν the natural homomorphism from G onto G/H.

The Fundamental Theorem
It remains to show that any onto group homomorphism is ‘essentially the same’ as the
natural homomorphism from the domain group onto the group of cosets formed from the
kernel. This is the next theorem.
Theorem 26.4
Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Groups
Let ϕ : G →
H be a surjective homomorphism between groups, and let ν : G →G/ ker(ϕ) be the usual
natural homomorphism. Then there exists an isomorphism µ : G/ ker(ϕ) →H such that
µ ◦ν = ϕ.
We exhibit this situation in the following diagram:
G
H
G/ker(ϕ)
ϕ
ν
µ
Proof:
Suppose that G and H are groups, ϕ : G →H is a surjective group homomorphism,
and ν : G →G/ ker(ϕ) is the natural homomorphism. Clearly, what we need to do is deﬁne
a function µ, and prove that it has the desired properties. In this proof (unlike the ring
case), you will be doing the required veriﬁcations.
Choose an arbitrary element of G/ ker(ϕ). Such an element is a coset of the form ker(ϕ)g,
where g ∈G. What element of H should it correspond to? If the composition of functions
required in the theorem is to work as we wish, we must have that
µ(ker(ϕ)g) = ϕ(g).
And so, this is how we deﬁne the map µ : G/ ker(ϕ) →H.
There is an immediate problem we must solve: This deﬁnition apparently depends on
the particular representative g. That is, our function does not appear to be unambiguously
deﬁned. But it is well deﬁned; you will check this in Exercise 5.
After showing that µ is well deﬁned, we must next show that µ is a group isomorphism.
This requires showing that:
µ preserves the group operation,
µ is surjective,
and that
µ is injective.
You check these things in Exercise 5.

Example 26.8
Consider again the determinant homomorphism
det : U(M2(R)) →R∗.
This homomorphism is surjective.
 Quick Exercise.
Why? 
We have calculated its kernel in Example 26.3: It is H, the set of all matrices with
determinant 1. The Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Groups 26.4 now allows
us to conclude that the groups U(M2(R))/H and R∗are isomorphic, as we conjectured
in Example 25.6. In fact, from the proof of the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem we
can extract the function that establishes the isomorphism; namely, µ(HA) = det(A).
The inverse function, which is also necessarily an isomorphism, should assign to
each non-zero number r the coset of a matrix whose determinant is r. In the previous
chapter we laboriously determined that each coset of H consists of those matrices with
a certain determinant. We proved this again in this chapter, in a more general context,
because we proved that the cosets of H = ker(ϕ) are exactly the inverse images of
real numbers under the function det. Because of this, to deﬁne the inverse function
of µ, any choice of such a matrix with the appropriate determinant will work as a
representative for the coset. Here is a particularly understandable version:

Thus, the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem 26.4 says that the groups R[x]/R and

Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the notion of the kernel of a group homomorphism. It is a
normal subgroup, and every normal subgroup is the kernel of some homomorphism. Fur-
thermore, we proved the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Groups, which asserts
that every onto homomorphism can be viewed as a natural homomorphism onto the group
modulo its kernel.

Section V in a Nutshell
This section starts by considering group homomorphisms, by way of analogy with ring
homomorphisms: A function between groups ϕ : G →S is a group homomorphism if
ϕ(gh) = ϕ(g)ϕ(h) for every g, h ∈G. A group homomorphism preserves the group identity
and inverses, the image of G is a subgroup of S, and if G is abelian then so is ϕ(G)
(Theorems 22.1 and 22.2). If ϕ is a bijection, then we say ϕ is an isomorphism, in which
case ker(ϕ) = 1G.
A subgroup H of G is normal if gH = Hg for all g ∈G; that is, if the left and right
cosets of H are the same for each element of G. This is equivalent to saying that g−1Hg ⊆H
for all g ∈G. If H is normal in G, then the collection of cosets of H in G, denoted G/H,
forms a group under the operation (Ha)(Hb) = Hab (Theorem 25.1). G/H is then called
the group of cosets of G mod H or the quotient group of G mod H. Normal subgroups are to
groups what ideals are to rings. The kernel ker(ϕ) of any group homomorphism is a normal
subgroup of G.
Paralleling rings, there is the Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem for Groups (Theorem
26.4) which says that if ϕ : G →S is an onto homomorphism, then G/ ker(ϕ) is isomorphic
to S.
Whether the subgroup H is normal in G or not, the number of left cosets of H is the same
as the number of right cosets. Assuming G is ﬁnite, this number is called the index of H in
G and denoted by [G : H]. Lagrange’s Theorem (Theorem 24.2) says that |G| = [G : H]|H|.
Thus the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group and so the order of any
element must divide the order of the group. Thus, any group of prime order is cyclic.
A group G may not have a subgroup for every order dividing |G|; however G does have
a subgroup of order p for each prime p that divides |G| (Cauchy’s Theorem 24.5).
Any group can be thought of as a subgroup of a group of permutations; indeed, Cayley’s
Theorem (Theorem 23.3) says that every group of order n is isomorphic to a subgroup of
Sn.
We can characterize when a group is a direct product of smaller groups. The Internal
Characterization Theorem for two subgroups (Theorem 23.1) says:
The group G is isomorphic to H1 × H2 if and only if G has two subgroups G1 and G2, so
that
a. G1 is isomorphic to H1, and G2 is isomorphic to H2.
b. G = G1G2,
c. G1 ∩G2 = {1}, and
d. every element of G1 commutes with every element of G2.
Theorem 23.2 generalizes this theorem to more than two subgroups.

Chapter 27
The Alternating Groups
In this chapter we inquire further into the symmetry groups Sn. In the process we gain
further insight into the importance and signiﬁcance of normal subgroups.
27.1
Transpositions
For obvious reasons, we call a cycle of length 2 a transposition.
We now show that any permutation can be factored as a product of transpositions.
Theorem 27.1 Any permutation can be factored as a product of transpositions.
Proof:
Because every permutation is a product of cycles (Theorem 18.3), it clearly suﬃces
to show that each cycle can be factored as a product of transpositions. But this is easy:
Consider the cycle (a1a2 · · · an) of length n. Clearly,
(a1a2 · · · an) = (a1an)(a1an−1) · · · (a1a3)(a1a2).
2
Notice that the method of factorization suggested by the proof of the theorem provides
n −1 transpositions for each cycle of length n. So the 5-cycle (12345) can be factored into
a product of 4 transpositions:
(12345) = (15)(14)(13)(12).
The product of cycles can then also be factored into a product of transpositions:
(1345)(267) = (15)(14)(13)(27)(26).
However, this method of factoring into transpositions does not give us a factorization which
is unique (unlike the factorization into disjoint cycles in Theorem 18.3).
Example 27.1
Here’s a diﬀerent factorization of the last permutation into transpositions:
(1345)(267) = (25)(67)(57)(25)(45)(35)(15).
(Don’t worry about where this factorization came from.)
 Quick Exercise.
Check that this factorization works. Can you come up with
another essentially diﬀerent factorization of this permutation into transpositions? 

Example 27.2
A surprising place where permutations and transpositions occur is in the theory of
bell ringing. A bell ringer rings n bells. Ringing the changes means ringing each of the
n! orders of the n bells exactly once. The n bells are typically arranged in a row on
a table and the ringer starts on the left and rings each bell in sequence. According
to bell ringing practice, after a certain permutation is rung, the next permutation to
be rung must be the same, except for one transposition. This is true because the bell
ringer has only two hands with which to interchange two bells! Our theorem in essence
asserts that we can get from any one order of the bells to any other, by repeated
transpositions.
 Quick Exercise.
Suppose that a bell ringer has six bells, in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
Give a list of transpositions, which when done one after another, results in the bells
in order 6, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2. 
27.2
The Parity of a Permutation
Our earlier example revealed that two distinct factorizations of a given permutation into
transpositions need not even have the same number of factors. For example, our ﬁrst fac-
torization of (1345)(267) had ﬁve factors, while our second had seven factors. In fact, any
given permutation can be expressed as a product of transpositions in an inﬁnite number of
ways. To see this, we need only notice that ι = (12)(12) and that (ab) = (ca)(cb)(ca).
 Quick Exercise.
Why does this mean that any permutation can be expressed as a
product of transpositions in inﬁnitely many ways? 
However, it does turn out that any factorization for the permutation (1345)(267) will
have an odd number of factors. In fact, for any permutation, all the factorizations of that
permutation into transpositions involve an even number of transpositions, or they all involve
an odd number of transpositions. To see that the number of factors is always even or always
odd, consider the polynomial
gn = (x1 −x2)(x1 −x3) · · · (x1 −xn)(x2 −x3) · · · (xn−1 −xn)
=
Y
i<j
(xi −xj).
Notice that this polynomial consists of the product of all terms of the form xi −xj, where
i < j, and so each pair xi, xj appears together in a factor of this product exactly once. Now
consider a permutation of the n terms x1, . . . , xn. We can think of such a permutation as
acting on the polynomial gn, and it will clearly map gn either to gn or to −gn, as the order
of the subscripts i and j are scrambled by the permutation.
Now clearly a single transposition maps gn to −gn. So, the product of an even number
of transpositions will map gn to gn and the product of an odd number of transpositions
will map gn to −gn. Thus, if a particular permutation of n elements leaves gn unchanged,
then clearly any representation of this permutation as a product of transpositions must do
the same, and so such a product must have an even number of tranpositions. Similarly, if
the permutation changes gn to −gn, any representation of this permutation as a product of
transpositions must contain an odd number of transpositions.

Chapter 27: The Alternating Groups
297
So, we can now call a permutation even if it can be expressed as a product of an even
number of transpositions, and odd if it can be expressed as a product of an odd number of
tranpositions. Saying whether a permutation is even or odd is to specify its parity.
 Quick Exercise.
Determine whether the following permutations are even or odd:
ι, (123)(4789), (123)(342). 
27.3
The Alternating Groups
Let An be the set of even permutations. Take two such permutations, and multiply them
together. Any representation of this product as a product of transpositions will have an even
number of transpositions. Thus, the product of two even permutations is even. That is, An
is closed under multiplication. But what about inverses? Given a permutation represented
as a product of transpositions, its inverse can be computed as the product of the same
transpositions, in the opposite order!
 Quick Exercise.
Why is the inverse of a product of transpositions the same product
in the opposite order?

Thus, the inverse of an even transposition is still even. This all means that An is a subgroup
of Sn. We call An the alternating group.
Note that the argument we have just given does not mean that the set of odd permu-
tations forms a subgroup: The sum of two odd integers is even, and so the product of two
odd permutations is an even permutation. And there’s an even simpler reason why the odd
permutations cannot form a subgroup: Any subgroup must contain the identity, and the
identity is an even permutation (because 0 is even).
Note that cycles of odd length are the even permutations!
 Quick Exercise.
Why are cycles of odd length even permutations? 
Example 27.3
We have looked at the group A4 before (see Example 20.11). It is isomorphic to the
group of symmetries of the tetrahedron and consists of the twelve permutations
ι, (123), (132), (124), (142), (234), (243),
(134), (143), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).
 Quick Exercise.
List the elements in the group A3. 
In the examples we’ve looked at, it certainly appears that exactly half the permutations
are even, which would mean that the group An has exactly n!/2 elements (where n > 1, to
avoid the trivial case A1). This is quite easy to prove. Consider the function
Λ : An →Sn\An
deﬁned by Λ(α) = (12)α. That is, Λ merely multiplies each element by the transposition
(12). If α is even, quite evidently (12)α is odd, and so this function is well deﬁned. But Λ
is also a bijection (see Exercise 27.2.) Thus, there are as many even permutations as odd.
Notice of course that Λ establishes that the sets An and Sn\An have the same number of
elements, but it is certainly not a homomorphism.

298
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
27.4
The Alternating Subgroup Is Normal
It is now easy to see that the alternating group An is a normal subgroup of Sn; the argument
we’ve just done shows that [Sn : An] = 2, and so the result follows from the Index 2 Theorem
25.3. We will however provide here another proof, which will give us added insight into the
arithmetic of permutations.
By Theorem 25.2, to show that An is normal, we must check that for any permutation
α,
α−1Anα ⊆An.
In other words, we must show that if β is even, then α−1βα is too.
We introduce some general terminology and notation to deal with this. Let G be a
group and g, h ∈G. We call the element g−1hg the conjugate of h by g (we introduced
this terminology in Exercise 22.15). Our goal then can be rephrased as this: We must show
that conjugation preserves the parity of permutations. (Note that in Exercise 22.15 you
proved that conjugates have the same order.) But in fact, much more is true:
Theorem 27.2
Conjugation Theorem
Conjugation in Sn preserves disjoint cycle
structure. That is, if we express an element α as a product of m disjoint cycles of lengths
k1, k2, · · · , km, then any conjugate of α can be expressed as a product of m disjoint cycles,
of lengths k1, k2, · · · , km.
Before proceeding to the proof of this theorem, let’s look at a couple of examples.
Example 27.4
Consider the element α = (12)(3456)(789), the product of a 2-cycle, a 3-cycle, and
a 4-cycle. Consider some other permutation, like β = (14567)(239). Then β−1 =
(76541)(932), and
β−1αβ = β−1(153724689) = (1452)(368)(79).
This new element has exactly the same disjoint cycle structure as α.
 Quick Exercise.
Now pick some other permutation β at random, and use it to
conjugate α. Is the disjoint cycle structure preserved? 
Example 27.5
In Chapter 17 we looked at S3 as the set of symmetries of the equilateral triangle.
Let’s consider what conjugation might mean geometrically in this context, and thus
understand why we should expect it to preserve disjoint cycle structure.
In particular, consider the symmetry ϕ, which is represented by the permutation
(12). Recall that ϕ is the reﬂection of the triangle through the vertical line ℓ. Let’s
see what the conjugate ρ−1ϕρ of ϕ by ρ means, where ρ rotates the triangle 120◦
counterclockwise. The rotation ρ re-orients the triangle, so that the ﬂip ϕ will permute
the vertices at original positions 1 and 2. We then rotate back via ρ−1. We have in
eﬀect accomplished the ﬂip ρϕ through the line m. (See the diagram below.) In other
words, ρ−1ϕρ = (13).

A metaphor for the interpretation of conjugation in this example might be illustrative.
Suppose you, an English-speaking mathematics student, are asked to solve a mathematical
problem written in French! Your thought process would probably be this: Translate the
problem into English (operation β), solve the problem (operation α), and then translate
back into French (β−1). The general message is this: If a group element can be thought of
as an operation or process, then any conjugate of it will be an operation or process of a
similar type. Thus the conjugate of a 3-cycle is a 3-cycle; the conjugate of a ﬂip is a ﬂip.
This discussion suggests the general method of proof for our theorem:
Proof of the Conjugation Theorem:
We prove the theorem ﬁrst in the case where α
is a cycle of length k. So suppose that α = (a1a2 · · · ak), and β is an arbitrary permutation.
Then we claim that β−1αβ is the k-cycle
χ = (β−1a1 β−1a2 · · · β−1ak).
By direct computation it is easy to see that the conjugate β−1αβ and the k-cycle χ behave
in the same way on the support of χ
Supp(χ) = {β−1a1, β−1a2, · · · , β−1ak}.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. 
Now suppose m is some integer not belonging to this set; that is, χ(m) = m. Then β(m)
is not in the set {a1, · · · , ak}. That is, β(m) is not in the support of α. Thus,
β−1αβ(m) = β−1β(m) = m = χ(m).
We have just shown that χ = β−1αβ, and so β−1αβ is also a cycle of length k.
Now suppose that α has been factored as a product
χ1χ2 · · · χn
of disjoint cycles. Note that
β−1αβ =
β−1χ1ββ−1χ2β · · · β−1χnβ,
and so the conjugate of α is evidently a product of cycles of the same length as the corre-
sponding cycles making up α. It remains only to show that these cycles are disjoint. But
if β−1χiβ and β−1χjβ both move r, then χi and χj would both move β−1(r), which is
impossible, since χi and χj are disjoint.

Now it is easy to see (again) that An is a normal subgroup of Sn:

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Corollary 27.3 The alternating group is a normal subgroup of the symmetric group.
Proof:
A conjugate of an even permutation has the same disjoint cycle structure. But
this means that the conjugate is even, too.

Example 27.6
As another example of the conjugation theorem, consider again the subgroup
{ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}
of the alternating group A4. Any conjugate of a non-identity element of this group
has the same disjoint cycle structure (a product of two disjoint transpositions). But
the subgroup consists of the complete collection of elements of this form (together
with ι). We ﬁrst looked at this in Example 25.5 where we found it tedious to prove
completely the normality of this subgroup. In Example 26.5 we argued that it is normal
by exhibiting a homomorphism, of which it is the kernel.
27.5
Simple Groups
As we’ve seen already, An is always normal in Sn, for all positive integers n. Does An
have any normal subgroups? The answer for n = 4 is certainly yes (as we’ve seen above in
Example 27.6). But it is possible to prove that for n ≥5, An itself has no proper normal
subgroups (except the trivial subgroup). This proof is quite a bit more technical, but similar
in ﬂavor, to the proof of the Conjugation Theorem 27.2. Note that these groups An have
many non-trivial proper subgroups (just consider any cyclic subgroup). However, no such
subgroup is normal.
This situation merits a deﬁnition: We call a group with no proper normal subgroups
(except the trivial subgroup) a simple group. The following theorem gives a large collection
of simple groups.
Theorem 27.4 The groups An are simple, for n ̸= 4.
Proof:
For n < 4, showing that An is simple is left as Exercise 27.4. We will now prove
that An is simple, for n ≥5. For that purpose, suppose that N is a non-trivial normal
subgroup of An. Choose a non-identity element α ∈N whose support is of minimal size.
We wish to show that α is a 3-cycle.
Note ﬁrst that in its disjoint cycle representation, all factors of α must be cycles of the
same size. For if α = (a1 · · · ak)(b1 · · · bm) · · ·, where k < m, then αk ∈N, but αk leaves the
integers ai ﬁxed, and so has a smaller support than α.
Suppose next that α is a product of disjoint 2-cycles (that is, transpositions). So, we
may suppose (without loss of generality) that α = (12)(34) · · ·, where the remainder of α
consists of further disjoint transpositions. Because N is normal, we then have that β =
(123)α(123)−1α−1 ∈N. But β = (13)(24), and so because α has a support of minimal
size in N, we must have that α = (12)(34). Now n > 4, and so (125) ∈An. But then
(125)(12)(34)(125)−1((12)(34))−1 ∈N. But this latter element is (152), and this contradicts
the minimality of the support of α.

Chapter 27: The Alternating Groups
301
We now may suppose that α is a product of disjoint k-cycles, where k ≥3. Without loss
of generality we then have that
α = (123 · · ·)(456 · · ·) · · · .
But then (12534) = (124)α(124)−1α−1 ∈N, which again contradicts the minimality of the
support of α.
At this point we have concluded that α must be a single odd k cycle, with k ≥3. Now
if k > 3, we may suppose that α = (12345 · · ·). But then (124) = (123)α(123)−1α−1 ∈N.
This yet again contradicts the minimality of the support of α, and so we conclude that α
itself must be a 3-cycle.
We may as well suppose that α = (123). But for any other 3-cycle (abc), we can construct
a permutation τ by ﬁrst setting τ(a) = 1, τ(b) = 2, τ(c) = 3, and then ﬁlling in the other
values of τ in such a way that we have a permutation. It is then clear that τ −1(123)τ = (abc).
By normality, this would say that (abc) ∈N, if τ ∈An. However, as we have constructed it
τ may not be an even permutation (that is, an element of An). However, if the permutation
τ we have ﬁrst constructed is odd, the permutation τ(45) will certainly belong to An, and
still take (123) to (abc) by conjugation. Of course, this last step is permissible only because
n ≥5.
We have thus shown that if N is a non-trivial normal subgroup of An, it contains all
3-cycles. But by Exercise 27.12, the set of 3-cycles generates An, and so N = An, as we
claimed.

It turns out that this theorem will be of considerable importance to us in Chapter 48,
when we prove that polynomial equations with degree greater than 4 cannot always be
solved by ordinary arithmetic and root extractions.
There are other simple groups that are very familiar to us:
Example 27.7
Consider the cyclic group Z5. This group has no non-trivial proper subgroups. If H
is any non-trivial subgroup, choose a non-identity element h ∈H. By Lagrange’s
Theorem 24.2, this non-identity element has order 5, and so ⟨h⟩= Z5. Thus, Z5 is
simple.
The argument of this example can clearly be extended, and so we have:
Theorem 27.5 The groups Zp are simple, for all primes p.

Prove this by repeating the argument above for Zp, p prime.

Historical Remarks
In the theory of ﬁnite groups that has been developed in the 20th century, simple groups can
be viewed as the building blocks out of which more complicated groups can be constructed.
Thus, to understand all ﬁnite groups, we need to understand simple groups, and how they
can be put together to form more complicated groups. Both questions are very diﬃcult.
One of the triumphs of 20th-century mathematics has been the complete classiﬁcation
of all ﬁnite simple groups. Dozens of mathematicians contributed to the solution of this
problem, and a full proof would require many hundreds of pages of technical mathematics.
We have met two families of ﬁnite simple groups—namely, the cyclic groups of prime order,
and the alternating groups—and there are other such families. But part of the diﬃculty in

302
Exercises
the classiﬁcation theorem lies in the fact that there are some ﬁnite simple groups that do
not belong to such naturally deﬁned families. These simple groups are called sporadic, and
the last of these 26 groups was ﬁnally constructed in the 1980s.
The problem of putting together simple groups (called the extension problem) is far from
solved. The easiest way to put together smaller groups to build more complicated ones is
the idea of direct product, which we understand well. But there are much more complicated
ways (including the idea of semidirect product we explored in Exercise 23.18). We will turn
our attention to how abelian groups can be put together in certain ways to form a much
larger class called solvable groups, in Chapter 30.
The general program for understanding ﬁnite groups is typical in much of algebra. We
wish to prove a structure theorem: All objects of a given type can be built in a speciﬁed
way, from well-understood pieces. In Section 29.3 we will discuss such a program for ﬁnite
abelian groups. In this case, the well-understood pieces turn out to be cyclic groups, and
the method of putting them together is the idea of direct product. In Chapter 45, we will
provide a structure theorem for ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we proved that the set of even permutations forms a subgroup of the sym-
metric group, called the alternating group. We proved the Conjugation Theorem, which says
that conjugation preserves disjoint cycle structure. It follows that An is normal in Sn. If
n ̸= 4, then An has no proper normal subgroups; such a group is simple.

Chapter 28
Sylow Theory: The Preliminaries
Lagrange’s Theorem 24.2 tells us that the order of every subgroup of a ﬁnite group must
divide the order of the group. It is natural to ask if the converse of this theorem holds. We
get a partial answer from Cauchy’s Theorem 24.5 that says that if the order of the group is
divisible by prime p, then the group must have an element of order p. Thus the group must
at least have a subgroup of order p. However, the converse of Lagrange’s Theorem does not
hold in general, as we encountered in Example 24.6, where we discovered that the twelve
element group A4 does not have a subgroup with 6 elements. (For alternative proofs for this
result, see Exercise 24.19 or Exercise 27.10.)
Therefore, we cannot guarantee that in general there is a subgroup for every possible
divisor of the order of the group. However, we can guarantee the existence of subgroups of
some orders, ﬁnd out the relationship between such subgroups, and even count how many
such subgroups there are. These results are called the Sylow theorems (ﬁrst proved by the
Norwegian mathematician Peter Sylow, 1832–1918). These results focus attention on one
prime divisor at a time.
So suppose that G is a ﬁnite group, and p is a prime integer that divides the order of G.
We may then suppose that |G| = pnm, where the exponent n is positive and m is relatively
prime to p. The ﬁrst Sylow theorem will show that G does have subgroups of all orders
pk, for k = 0, 1, . . . n. To prove this theorem (and the theorems that follow) we need some
preliminary material, and those preliminaries will be the focus of this chapter.
28.1
p-groups
We ﬁrst turn our attention to ﬁnite groups whose order is divisible by only one prime. Given
a prime integer p, a p-group is a group where the order of every element is some power
of p. (There are according to this deﬁnition p-groups with inﬁnitely many elements, but in
these chapters our emphasis is entirely on ﬁnite groups; see Exercise 1.) We record ﬁrst an
easy consequence:
Theorem 28.1 Let G be a ﬁnite group. Then G is p-group if and only if |G| = pn.
Proof:
If G is a p-group, and some other prime q divided the order of G, then by Cauchy’s
Theorem 24.5 G would have an element of order q, which is impossible. Conversely, if
|G| = pn, Corollary 24.3 to Lagrange’s Theorem says that every element has order pk,
k ≤n.
Example 28.1
The abelian groups Z2, Z16, Z2 × Z4, and Z1024 are all 2-groups. The non-abelian
groups D4, Q8 are also 2-groups. We could directly check that every element of these
305

306
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
groups has order equal to a power of 2, or by Theorem 28.1 just compute the order of
the group, in each case.
Now one might suppose that in any ﬁnite group G, if we consider the set of elements
of order pk, for a ﬁxed prime p and varying exponents k, that this might form a p-group
which is a subgroup of G. However, this is deﬁnitely false! Note for example, Theorem 27.1,
which asserts that every element of the group Sn is a product of transpositions, which are,
of course, elements of order two. Similarly, in Exercise 27.12, you prove that every even
permutation in Sn can be expressed as a product of 3-cycles, which are of course of order
three. In short, in an arbitrary group the elements of order pk for a ﬁxed prime p are not
close to being a subgroup. However, this statement is true for abelian groups. The following
theorem shows this, and more.
Theorem 28.2 Let G be a ﬁnite abelian group with order pnm, where p is a prime, and p
and m are relatively prime. Let P be the set of all elements in G whose orders divide pn,
and let M be the set of all elements in G whose orders divide m. Then G is isomorphic to
the direct product of P and M.
Proof:
We ﬁrst show that P is in fact a subgroup. But if g, h ∈P, then (gh)pn = gpnhpn =
1, and so the order of gh divides pn. Thus gh ∈P. Since the order of g and g−1 are the same,
P is obviously closed under taking inverses too, and so P is a subgroup. The argument that
M is also a subgroup is essentially the same.
Now we use the Internal Characterization Theorem 23.1. Note that any element in P ∩M
must have an order that divides both pn and m. But these integers are relatively prime,
and so such an element must be the identity. Since G is abelian, it is clear that elements
from P commute with elements from M.
To apply the Internal Characterization Theorem it thus remains to prove that G = PM.
Now since pn and m are relatively prime, by the GCD identity there exist integers r, s with
rpn + sm = 1.
But then we have that
g = g1 = grpn+sm = grpngsm.
But consider the element b = gsm. Clearly bpn = 1 and so b ∈P. Similarly, if a = grpn,
then am = 1 and so a ∈M. This means that g = ab ∈PM, as required. The theorem now
follows from Theorem 23.1.
2
An easy induction on the number of primes that divide the order the abelian group
yields the following corollary (see Exercise 3):
Corollary 28.3 Suppose that the order of the ﬁnite abelian group G is divisible by the
distinct prime integers p1, . . . , pn. Let Pi be the subgroup of G consisting of those elements
whose orders are powers of pi. Then G is isomorphic to the direct product of the n groups
Pi.
To rephrase: Every ﬁnite abelian group can be represented as a direct product of pi-
groups, where p1, . . . , pn is the list of the prime factors of |G|. There is actually more to say
about ﬁnite abelian groups than this, and we will return to this topic in Section 29.3.
Sylow theory then asks how much of this structure can we recover, should the group not
be abelian.

Chapter 28: Sylow Theory: The Preliminaries

28.2
Groups Acting on Sets
We have another preliminary topic to consider, before we can begin the proof of the Sylow
theorems. To aid us in this task, we need to consider a group as a group of permutations of
a set. We have seen instances when it is useful to consider groups whose elements permute
elements of a set. The most obvious examples are the full symmetric groups Sn, which
consist of all the permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} (which we ﬁrst considered in Chapter 18),
and also the groups of symmetries of geometric ﬁgures, which we considered in Chapter 17
and thereafter. An important general instance of this approach is Cayley’s Theorem 23.3,
which says that every ﬁnite group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of SG, the permutations
of the set of elements of the group itself. In the proof of Cayley’s Theorem we found an
isomorphism that mapped each element of G to a permutation of the elements of G in a
natural way. Note that for even relatively modest sized G, SG can be enormous. We shall
see below that this mapping from the proof of Cayley’s Theorem is by no means the only
way a group can be realized as a group of permutations of some set.
For yet another example of this approach, we can turn to a multiplicative group of
matrices, like U(M2(R)); we recall from Example 19.11 that this group consists of the 2 × 2
matrices whose determinants are non-zero. You may recall from linear algebra that such
matrices act bijectively on the set of vectors in the plane, by matrix multiplication (see
Exercise 4).
We now make our general deﬁnition: We say the group G acts on a set X if there is a
homomorphism σ : G →SX. Thus σ(G) is a subgroup of SX, the group of all permutations
of X. Equivalently we say G is a group of permutations of X. The notation can become a
bit cumbersome. We would write σ(g) as the permutation of X that g is mapped to and so if
x ∈X, σ(g)(x) would be the element of X that x is mapped to under the permutation σ(g).
To make the notation less cumbersome, we will simply eliminate the σ and identify the group
element with the permutation to which it is associated, and then use functional notation.
That is, we will understand g(x) as the element of X that the permutation associated with
g maps x to.
Using this functional notation for the permutation associated with an element of the
group, the fact that σ is a homomorphism from the group operation in G to the functional
composition in the group of permutations amounts to asserting that (gh)(x) = g(h(x)),
for all g, h ∈G and x ∈X. Below we will describe this by saying that the action is
homomorphic. Note we do not insist that σ be an injection here. Indeed, sometimes two
diﬀerent elements of G may be associated with the same permutation on X, as we will see
in some of the examples below.
We now illustrate the idea of a group acting on a set with some examples, with special
emphasis on those actions we will be using to prove the Sylow theorems in the next chapter.
Example 28.2
Recall in the proof of Cayley’s Theorem 23.3 that we have the ﬁnite group G acting on
G (so X = G) by left multiplication; that is, g(x) = gx. The notation is confusing the
ﬁrst time you see it. With the term g(x) we think of the element g as a permutation
of the set G; that is, an element of SG. But in the term gx we use g as an element of
the group G and the operation is the group operation of G.
First note that the action described really is a permutation on the elements of G.
For clearly g(x) = gx ∈G and x ̸= y if and only if gx ̸= gy. Note furthermore that
this action is homomorphic: We must show that if g, h, x ∈G, then g(h(x)) = (gh)(x).
But
g(h(x)) = g(hx) = ghx = (gh)(x).

308
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
 Quick Exercise.
Show furthermore that in this case the map taking the group
element g to a permutation is injective (in the proof of Cayley’s theorem we called this
map Φ). That is, if g ̸= h, then we claim that g(x) ̸= h(x) for some x ∈X = G. (This
would make g and h two diﬀerent permutations of X since g and h would map at least
one element of X to diﬀerent places. In fact here g and h map every element of X to
diﬀerent places. Right?) 
Example 28.3
Let H be a subgroup of G. Let G act on the set of left cosets of H by left multiplication.
That is, the action is g(kH) = gkH. We claim that this gives a permutation of the
left cosets. But recall from the left-handed version of the Coset Theorem (Exercise
24.3) that kH = hH if and only if k−1h ∈H. But (gk)−1(gh) = k−1g−1gh = k−1h
and so diﬀerent left cosets are taken to diﬀerent left cosets. Furthermore, this action
is homomorphic: g(h(kH)) = ghkH = (gh)(kH).
We will consider this action for any subgroup H of our group G, whether or not H
is a normal subgroup. In this chapter we will use the notation G/H for the set of left
cosets of H, whether or not G/H is actually a group. In this example we have thus
considered our group G as acting on the set X = G/H.
Let’s look at this action for a particular group G = S3, and a particular subgroup
H = ⟨(123)⟩. Here X = G/H = {ιH, (12)H} (see Example 25.2). Every element
of G = S3 then corresponds to a permutation on the two element set X = G/H.
Then the three elements ι, (123), (132) all perform the action which interchanges the
two elements of X, while the elements (12), (23), (13) all correspond to the identity
permutation on X. Note that while this action is homomorphic, it is not injective:
More than one element of the group G = S3 corresponds to the same element of SX.
 Quick Exercise.
Check the claims of the previous paragraph by explicit calcu-
luation.

In Exercise 2 you will consider the action of G = S3 on the set G/⟨(12)⟩. (See
Example 25.1 for this set of left cosets.)
Notice that we could also restrict this action by considering just H as acting on
the set of its left cosets by left multiplication. This action is actually only interesting
if H is not a normal subgroup, because if H is normal, then
h(kH) = hkH = kk−1hkH = kH,
where the latter equality holds because k−1hk ∈H, when H is normal. Thus, in this
case the action is the identity on X, for all h ∈H. But this restricted action in the
non-normal case will be useful for us in the proof of the First Sylow Theorem.
Example 28.4
Let G act on G by conjugation given by g(x) = gxg−1; see Exercise 22.15. In that
exercise you show that the function g(x) is a bijection (that is, a permutation of G). We
claim also that this action is homomorphic: That is, we claim that g(h(x)) = (gh)(x).
 Quick Exercise.
Show this. (This is essentially Exercise 26.16a.)

Chapter 28: Sylow Theory: The Preliminaries
309
Example 28.5
Let X be the set of all subgroups of G. Let G act on X by conjugation; that is,
g(H) = gHg−1. We have shown in Exercise 25.6 that if H is a subgroup, then so is
gHg−1; recall that we call gHg−1 a conjugate of the subgroup H. Thus this action
really does map subgroups to subgroups. We claim that for any given g ∈G, this
establishes a bijection from the set X onto itself. This is most easily seen by observing
that the function g(x) : X →X has an inverse function, namely conjugation by g−1.
To see that G acts on X it remains to show that this action is homomorphic. But,
g(h(H)) = g(hHh−1) = ghHh−1g−1 = ghH(gh)−1 = (gh)(H).
Notice of course that if a subgroup H is a normal subgroup, then gHg−1 = H for
all g ∈G. That is, normal subgroups are left ﬁxed by this action.
Now if G is a group of permutations of the set X then two elements x, y of X are called
G-equivalent if and only if there exists g ∈G such that g(x) = y. You will show in Exercise
5 that G-equivalence is indeed an equivalence relation.
The G-equivalence classes are called the orbits of G. So the orbit of x ∈X is
Orb(x) = {y ∈X : g(x) = y,
for some g ∈G}.
We actually used this terminology in Section 18.4, when we ﬁrst discussed permutation
groups. For a general permutation α ∈Sn acting on the set X = {1, 2, . . . , n}, its orbits
are thus precisely the elements of X making up the disjoint cycles in the factorization in
Theorem 18.3.
So for any group of permutations on a set X, we have that the orbits partition X into
pairwise disjoint sets, since the orbits of the elements are the equivalence classes. So, we
have the following counting theorem:
Corollary 28.4 Suppose G is a group of permutations of the ﬁnite set X. If x1, . . . , xn are
representatives chosen from each of the disjoint orbits of G, then
|X| =
n
X
i=1
|Orb(xi)|.
Example 28.6
Consider Example 28.2, where G acts on itself by left multiplication. Here, Orb(x) =
{y : y = gx, for some g ∈G}. But for every y there is always such a g, namely yx−1.
So Orb(x) = G for every x ∈G. That is, there is but one orbit.
Example 28.7
Consider Example 28.3, where G acts on the left cosets G/H by multiplication on the
left. Here Orb(gH) = {kH : kH = hgH, for some h ∈G}. But here too there is only
a single orbit, because for any k ∈G, kH = kg−1gH.
If G is a group of permutations of the set X and there is only a single orbit, then we say
that G acts transitively on X. Speaking more concretely, this means that for any x, y ∈X,
there exists g ∈G for which g(x) = y. The previous two examples illustrate this case. (We
introduced this terminology earlier in Exercise 27.13.)

310
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 28.8
Consider Example 28.4, where G acts on itself by conjugation. If x ∈G, then Orb(x) =
{y : y = gxg−1, for some g ∈G}. That is, Orb(x) is the set of conjugates of x. For an
interesting example of this, suppose that G = Sn. Then by the Conjugation Theorem
27.2, the orbit of a given permutation is precisely the set of all permutations with the
same disjoint cycle structure.
Example 28.9
Consider Example 28.5, where G acts on its set X of subgroups by conjugation. For
a given subgroup H of G, we then have that Orb(H) = {gHg−1 : g ∈G}, which is
precisely its set of conjugate subgroups. Now since conjugation is a group isomorphism
(Exercise 22.15), this means that if H is ﬁnite, then the subgroups in its orbit all have
the same number of elements.
If G acts on X and x ∈X, then the stabilizer of x is
Stab(x) = {g ∈G : g(x) = x}.
That is, Stab(x) is the set of those elements of G that do not move x. Note that we
introduced this concept in the context of permutation groups in Exercises 23.14–23.17, and
in particular, veriﬁed that Stab(x) is a subgroup of G.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that Stab(x) is a subgroup of G (referring to Exercise 23.14
if necessary).

Example 28.10
In Example 28.4, h ∈Stab(g) if and only if hgh−1 = g. But this means that hg = gh.
Thus Stab(g) = {h : hg = gh}, the subgroup of all elements that commute with g . In
Exercise 20.15 we called this the centralizer of g, and denoted it by C(g).
Example 28.11
In Example 28.5, Stab(H) = {g ∈G : gHg−1 = H}. We call this set the normalizer
of H and denote it by N(H). We then have that N(H) is a subgroup of G and that
H is a normal subgroup of N(H). Furthermore, N(H) is the largest subgroup of G in
which H is normal. You will prove this (and more) in Exercise 9.
It is important to remember that if G is a group acting on the set X, then Orb(x)
is a subset of X and Stab(x) is a subgroup of G. Surprisingly, perhaps, there is a strong
connection between these two sets, as the next theorem shows.
Theorem 28.5 If G is a ﬁnite group of permutations of the set X, then the size of Orb(x)
is the index of the subgroup Stab(x) in G; that is
|Orb(x)| = [G : Stab(x)].
Proof:
Suppose that g, h ∈G, x ∈X, and g(x) = h(x). Then g−1h(x) = x and this
happens if and only if g−1h ∈Stab(x). But by the left-handed Coset Theorem 24.3, this is
true if and only if hStab(x) = g Stab(x). That is, g and h perform the same action on x if
and only if g and h are in the same left coset of Stab(x).
The orbit of x consists of the points {g(x) : g ∈G}. So, there is a bijection between
distinct points in the orbit of x and the left cosets of Stab(x). Thus, |Orb(x)| = [G : Stab(x)].

Corollary 28.6 If G is a ﬁnite group of permutations of the ﬁnite set X, then the size of
every orbit of G divides |G|.
Proof:
|G| = |Stab(x)|[G : Stab(x)] = |Stab(x)| |Orb(x)|.

Example 28.12
For a simple example of this theorem, consider the subgroup of S5 given by
G = {α ∈S5 : α({1, 2}) = {1, 2}}.
It of course still acts on the set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. This group has 12 = 3!2! elements,
because every element is determined by a permutation of {3, 4, 5} and a permutation
of {1, 2}.
 Quick Exercise.
List these 12 elements. 
Now consider the orbit Orb(3). Clearly, this is {3, 4, 5}, and we have that 3 divides 12.
Similarly, Orb(1) has two elements, which also divides 12.
Now if G is a group of permutations of the set X, we say that x is a ﬁxed point for
the element g if g(x) = x. As in Section 18.4, we denote by Fix(g) the set of all such points;
this is of course a subset of the set X, called the ﬁxed set of g, and we can then consider
the set of points in X left ﬁxed by all the elements of the group G, and we denote this by
Fix(G), called the ﬁxed set of G. Clearly Fix(G) = ∩{Fix(g) : g ∈G}.
Our ﬁnal theorem in this chapter brings together these ideas for a p-group, connecting
the number of elements in X with the number of ﬁxed points. This result will be very useful
in proving the Sylow theorems in the next chapter.
Theorem 28.7
Fixed Point Theorem
Let G be a ﬁnite p-group acting on a ﬁnite
set X. Then
|X| ≡|Fix(G)| mod p.
Proof:
Suppose that G acts on X, and has n distinct orbits; we choose x1, . . . , xn to be
elements of each of these disjoint orbits. Then, by Corollary 28.4
|X| =
n
X
i=1
|Orb(xi)|.
But by Theorem 28.5 |Orb(xi)| = [G : Stab(xi)]. Because G is a p-group we know by
Theorem 28.1 that |G| is a power of p, so [G : Stab(xi)] is also a power of p, including
possibly p0 = 1. Thus |Orb(xi)| ≡0 mod p unless Stab(xi) = G, in which case xi is a ﬁxed
point, and so |Orb(xi)| = 1. So, the terms of Pn
i=1 |Orb(xi)| are all 0 modulo p except for
the ﬁxed points. The result then follows.
2
This now concludes the preliminaries we will need to prove the Sylow theorems them-
selves in the next chapter.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we introduced the idea of p-group, and proved that a ﬁnite abelian group
is isomorphic to a direct product of p-groups. We then considered the general notion of a
group acting on a set, and proved some important counting theorems relating to the orbits,
stabilizers and ﬁxed sets deﬁned in this situation.

Chapter 29
Sylow Theory: The Theorems
We will now apply the theory from the last chapter to obtain the Sylow theorems. These
theorems will enable us to understand the p-subgroups of any ﬁnite group, taken one prime
p at a time. Throughout this chapter we will assume that G is a ﬁnite group, and that it
has pnm elements, where p is a prime, and m is relatively prime to p. We will be able to
show that G has subgroups of order pn (called Sylow p-subgroups), that all such subgroups
are isomorphic, and we will often be able to count how many of these subgroups there are.
29.1
The Sylow Theorems
Given our ﬁnite group G with pnm elements, suppose that H is a subgroup of G and a
p-group. We then say that H is a p-subgroup of G. We call H a Sylow p-subgroup of
G if it is a maximal p-subgroup of G. That is, if H is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and K is
a p-subgroup of G that contains H, then K = H. Because G is a ﬁnite group, it is then
obvious that every p-subgroup is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. What is not yet obvious
is how many elements a Sylow p-subgroup has.
We claim ﬁrst that every conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also a Sylow p-subgroup.
To see this, ﬁrst recall that conjugation of subgroups of G gives an isomorphism between
subgroups (see Exercise 25.6). Now suppose that P is a Sylow p-subgroup of G and g ∈G,
but suppose by way of contradiction that gPg−1 is not a Sylow p-subgroup of G. Then
there exists a p-subgroup Q of G with proper subgroup gPg−1. But then g−1Qg properly
contains P and is a p-subgroup of G, contradicting that P is a maximal p-subgroup. Notice
that if G has only one Sylow p-subgroup, then it must be a normal subgroup of G.
Example 29.1
Consider the alternating group A4. This group has 12
=
22 · 3 elements.
We have considered in both Example 25.5 and 27.6 the 4 element subgroup
{ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}. Because this subgroup includes all of the elements of
A4 of order two, this is the only Sylow 2-subgroup of A4 and so (as we have seen before)
it is normal in A4. In contrast, a Sylow 3-subgroup of A4 can have only 3 elements
and hence must be a cyclic subgroup of order 3; we know that all of these subgroups
are conjugate to one another. There are exactly 4 such subgroups, namely
⟨(123)⟩,
⟨(124)⟩,
⟨(234)⟩,
⟨(134)⟩.
This is the complete list, because we have included all eight elements of order 3.
We are now ready to prove the First Sylow Theorem, which generalizes Cauchy’s The-
orem 24.5 that says if p divides the order of a ﬁnite group G, then G contains an element
(and hence a subgroup) of order p.

Theorem 29.1
First Sylow Theorem
Let G be a ﬁnite group, p a prime, and
|G| = pnm where p does not divide m. Then G has a subgroup of order pk for k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
Indeed, for k = 0, . . . , n −1, each subgroup of order pk is a normal subgroup of a subgroup
of order pk+1.
Proof:
Let |G| = pnm, with p prime and p not dividing m. We need to show that G has
a subgroup of order k for k = 0, 1, . . . , n.
If k = 0, then p0 = 1 and so the trivial subgroup (the subgroup consisting of only the
identity) is the desired p-subgroup. We now proceed by induction on k, and so will assume
the existence of a p-subgroup H of order pk, with k < n, and show H is contained in a
subgroup of order pk+1.
So consider a subgroup H of G with order pk, where k < n. We now consider H acting
on the left cosets G/H of H in G by left multiplication, as in Example 28.3. Remember of
course that probably H is not normal in G, and so G/H need not be a group. To ﬁnd our
subgroup of order pk+1 we will actually need a group of cosets; we will ﬁnd this below.
Now by the Fixed Point Theorem 28.7 we have that
|G/H| = [G : H] ≡|Fix(G/H)| mod p.
Let’s now consider these ﬁxed points. If gH is a point ﬁxed by H, then hgH = gH for
all h ∈H. But by the left-handed Coset Theorem Exercise 24.3 this is true if and only
if g−1hg ∈H for all h ∈H, that is, exactly if g−1Hg ⊆H. But since |g−1Hg| = |H|,
g−1Hg ⊆H if and only if gHg−1 = H. This means exactly that g ∈N(H), the normalizer
of H in G (see Example 28.11). Thus the set of ﬁxed points of G/H under left multiplication
by H is {gH : g ∈N(H)} = N(H)/H, which is a group. Therefore the above ﬁxed point
equation becomes
[G : H] ≡[N(H) : H] mod p.
Since |H| = pk with k < n, then p divides [G : H] = pnm/pk. The ﬁxed point equation
tells us then that p divides |N(H)/H|. Cauchy’s Theorem 24.5 then says that the group
N(H)/H has a subgroup of order p and so there is a subgroup K of N(H) that contains H
where K/H is isomorphic to this subgroup in N(H)/H (see Exercise 26.12). Thus |K| =
p · pk=pk+1, as we desired.
Note also that since K is a subgroup of N(H), H is normal in K (see Exercise 25.14).
And so each subgroup of order pk, for k = 0, . . . , n −1 is a normal subgroup of some
subgroup of order pk+1.
2
The proof of this theorem reveals even more about p-subgroups. Every p-subgroup of
order pk is a normal subgroup of a p-subgroup of order pk+1, and in fact can be found
in an increasing tower of p-subgroups, which culminate in a p-subgroup of size pn, which
is then necessarily a maximal p-subgroup, that is, a Sylow p-subgroup. The following two
corollaries record some of this formally:
Corollary 29.2 If G is a ﬁnite group and p is prime, then every p-subgroup of G is con-
tained in a Sylow p-subgroup.
Corollary 29.3 If |G| = pnm, where p is prime and p does not divide m, then all Sylow
p-subgroups of G are of order pn.
From this last corollary it is easy to see that every conjugate of a Sylow p-subgroup is also
a Sylow p-subgroup, because conjugation is a group isomorphism and therefore preserves
the order of the subgroup. The Second Sylow Theorem says that the converse is also true.

Chapter 29: Sylow Theory: The Theorems
317
Theorem 29.4
Second Sylow Theorem
For every prime p, the Sylow p-subgroups
of G are conjugate.
Proof:
Let P and Q be two Sylow p-subgroups of G. Let Q act on G/P by left multi-
plication. Again, we are not assuming P is normal in G and so not assuming that the left
cosets G/P form a group. By the Fixed Point Theorem 28.7,
|G/P| ≡|Fix(G/P)| mod p.
But |G/P| = [G : P] which is not divisible by p, since P is a Sylow p-subgroup. So the
number of ﬁxed points of G/P cannot be zero. Let gP be one such ﬁxed point. So, qgP = gP
for all q ∈Q. By the left-handed Coset Theorem Exercise 24.3, this means that g−1Qg ⊆P.
But then g−1Qg = P since Q and P are both ﬁnite and the same size. So Q and P are
conjugate.
2
Corollary 29.5 There is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup of a group G if and only if it is
normal.
We conclude this section with the third Sylow theorem, which provides us some valuable
information for counting the number of Sylow p-subgroups a ﬁnite group has:
Theorem 29.6
Third Sylow Theorem
Let G be a ﬁnite group where |G| = pnm
with p prime and p does not divide m. The number of Sylow p-subgroups divides m. Fur-
thermore, this number is congruent to 1 modulo p.
Proof:
Let np be the number of Sylow p-subgroups of G and let P be one of these
subgroups. Let P act on the set X of all Sylow p-subgroups of G by conjugation. By the
Second Sylow Theorem, this action does indeed permute the Sylow p-subgroups. By the
Fixed-Point Theorem 28.7,
np ≡|Fix(P)|mod p.
Fixed points are Sylow p-subgroups Q such that gQg−1 = Q for all g ∈P. Note P is
one such ﬁxed point. In general, if Q is ﬁxed by conjugation by the elements in P, then
P ⊆N(Q). Obviously Q ⊆N(Q), so P and Q are both Sylow p-subgroups of N(Q) and so
by the Second Sylow Theorem they are conjugate in N(Q). But Q is a normal subgroup of
N(Q). That is, the only conjugate in N(Q) of Q is Q itself. Thus, P = Q and so P is the
only ﬁxed point. Therefore,
np ≡1 mod p.
Now we show that np divides m. Consider G acting on the Sylow p-subgroups of G by
conjugation. Since all Sylow p-subgroups are conjugates, this action has one orbit and so
its size is np. The size of the orbit must divide |G|, by Corollary 28.6, and so np divides |G|.
But np ≡1 mod p, and thus np is relatively prime to p. This means that np must divide
m.
2
It is worth stating a weaker version of the Third Sylow Theorem as a corollary:
Corollary 29.7 The number of Sylow p-subgroups of a ﬁnite group G divides |G|.
29.2
Applications of the Sylow Theorems
We conclude this chapter with a few applications of the Sylow Theorems.

318
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 29.2
Consider S4, the group of all permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}. Now |S4| = 4! = 24 = 23 · 3.
We thus know that the Sylow 2-subgroups of S4 must all have order 8. Furthermore,
the Second Sylow Theorem says they all must be conjugates and therefore isomorphic.
We know however that there are ﬁve non-isomorphic groups of order eight (see Exercise
24.12). We claim that the Sylow 2-subgroups are in fact all isomorphic to D4, the group
of symmetries of the square. But recall from Chapter 17 that by labeling the vertices
of the square, we see D4 is group of permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} and so is isomorphic
to a subgroup of S4. Thus all the Sylow 2-subgoups must be isomorphic to D4. This
means that S4 has no subgroup isomorphic to Z8, Z2 × Z4, Z2 × Z2 × Z2, and the
quaternions, Q8, the other groups of order eight.
Now, how many of these Sylow 2-subgroups do we have? The Third Sylow Theorem
says that the number of these subgroups must be an odd divisor of 24. If there were
only one such, it would be normal; the other alternative is that there are three of them.
But we can specify three distinct 2-subgroups of order 4, namely
⟨(1234)⟩,
⟨(1324)⟩,
⟨(1243)⟩.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that these three cyclic groups of order 4 are all distinct,
and that there are no other such subgroups of S4. To do this, you need only consider
all possible elements of order 4 – they are all 4-cycles.

Since D4 has but one subgroup of order 4 these 3 subgroups must belong to 3
distinct Sylow 2-subgroups (each isomorphic to D4).
Let’s now consider the Sylow 3-subgroups of S4. Clearly they are all cyclic groups
of order 3. But we have already analyzed such subgroups as Sylow 3-subgroups of A4 in
Example 29.1 above. Notice that according to the Third Sylow Theorem, the number
of these subgroups must be a divisor of 24 which is congruent to 1 modulo 3. That is,
there must be 4 of them, as we have discovered.
The following is a nice application of the Third Sylow Theorem.
Theorem 29.8 If the order of a group G is pq where p and q are prime with p < q and p
does not divide q −1, then G is cyclic.
Proof:
Let H be a Sylow p-subgroup and K be a Sylow q-subgroup. Let np and nq be
number of Sylow p-subgroups and Sylow q-subgroups, respectively. By the Third Sylow
Theorem np ≡1 mod p and np divides q. Thus np = 1 + kp. Therefore np = 1 or q. But if
np = q, then p|q −1, a contradiction. Therefore np = 1.
Similarly, nq = 1.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that nq = 1.

Since there is only one of each Sylow subgroup, they are both normal in G. Take non-
identity elements x ∈H and y ∈K and consider x−1y−1xy. By the normality of H, K we
have that
x−1y−1xy = x−1(y−1xy) ∈H
and
x−1y−1xy = (x−1y−1x)y ∈K.
But Lagrange’s Theorem 24.2 implies that H ∩K = {1}. Therefore x−1y−1xy = 1 and so
xy = yx. Thus the order of xy is pq and so G is cyclic.
2
From this theorem we see immediately that the only group of order 15 is Z15. A similar
statement is true for groups of order 35, 65, 33, and inﬁnitely many others.
 Quick Exercise.
Find three more groups of order less than 100 that satisfy the con-
ditions for Theorem 29.8.

We use the First Sylow Theorem to prove the following:

Chapter 29: Sylow Theory: The Theorems
319
Theorem 29.9 Suppose the order of group G is p2 for prime p. Then G is abelian.
Proof:
If G had an element of order p2 it would be cyclic and so abelian. So we assume
that all non-identity elements have order p. Take non-identity a ∈G and b /∈⟨a⟩. Then
we claim that ⟨a⟩∩⟨b⟩= {1}. For if we had non-identity c ∈⟨a⟩∩⟨b⟩, then c = am and
c = bn. It follows that ⟨c⟩= ⟨a⟩and ⟨c⟩= ⟨b⟩, since the order of a and b are prime. But
then ⟨a⟩= ⟨b⟩, a contradiction.
By the First Sylow Theorem, H = ⟨a⟩is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of G that
has order p2. But then this subgroup must be G itself and so H is a normal subgroup
of G. Similarly K = ⟨b⟩is a normal subgroup of G. But then by the same argument as
in the proof of 29.8 we have that ab = ba. Finally, HK = G because there are evidently
p2 distinct elements of this set. We therefore have all conditions required by the Internal
Characterization Theorem 23.1 to see that G is isomorphic to H × K. But this group must
be abelian, since H and K are cyclic, and hence abelian.
2
Note that this theorem says that if |G| = p2, for prime p, then either G is isomorphic
either to Zp2 or Zp × Zp.
Thus from Theorem 29.9 we know all the structure of all groups of orders
4, 9, 25, 49, 121, . . . .
As another application of the Sylow theorems, let us prove that the converse of La-
grange’s Theorem is true for abelian groups.
Theorem 29.10 Let m divide the order of a ﬁnite abelian group G. Then G has a subgroup
of order m.
Proof:
We may assume that |G| = pe1
1 pe2
2 · · · pek
k , where the pi are distinct primes. From
Corollary 28.3 we know that G is isomorphic to a direct product of the Sylow pi-groups,
each of order pei
i . Because m is a divisor of the order of G, we know that m = pd1
1 pd2
2 · · · pdk
k ,
where di ≤ei. By the First Sylow Theorem we know that G has a subgroup of order pdi
i ,
for each i. But we can consider in the direct product the subgroup which consists of the
direct product of these subgroups, and this subgroup clearly has exactly m elements.
2
We now generalize Corollary 28.3 to nonabelian groups.
Theorem 29.11 All the Sylow p-subgroups of a ﬁnite group G are normal if and only if G
is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups.
Proof:
In one direction, if G is isomorphic to a direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups,
then each factor of the direct product is normal in G, as is the case for all direct prod-
ucts. Conversely, suppose all the Sylow p-subgroups of G are normal. We use the Internal
Characterization Theorem 23.1 to show G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow
p-subgroups. Let Hp1, . . . , Hpk be the distinct nontrivial Sylow p-subgroups of G.
Suppose x ∈G is of order n. By the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic,
n = pe1
1 pe2
2 · · · pek
k .
Let ni = n/pei
i . Then the gcd(n1, n2, . . . , nk) = 1 (for there is no prime dividing all the ni)
and so there exist mi such that P mini = 1. So,
x
P mini = xm1n1 · · · xmknk = x.

But (xmini)p

= xmin = 1, and thus xmini ∈Hpi, as the subgroup Hpi contains all the
elements of order some power of pi. Thus every element of G is the product of elements
from the Hpi.
Now suppose x ∈Hpi ∩Hpj for distinct primes pi and pj. Then x = 1, by Lagrange’s
Theorem. Then, if xi ∈Hpi and xj ∈Hpj, then
x−1

j xixj = (x−1

j xixj) ∈Hpi ∩Hpj = {1}.
Thus xixj = xjxi.
So, by Theorem 23.1, G is isomorphic to a direct product of the Hpi.

Example 29.3
We show that all groups of order 45 are abelian. If |G| = 45, its Sylow 3-subgroups
are of order 9 and its Sylow-5 subgroups are of order 5. By the Third Sylow Theorem,
n3 ≡1 mod 3 and n3|5. This implies n3 = 1. Also n5 ≡1 mod 5 and n5|3 which
implies n5 = 1. Thus there is only one Sylow 3-subgroup and one Sylow 5-subgroup and
so they are each normal, by Corollary 29.5. Let H3 be the unique Sylow 3-subgroup and
H5 be unique Sylow 5-subgroup. Then G is isomorphic to H3 ×H5, by Theorem 29.11.
Now H3 is abelian (being of order p2) and H5 is cyclic and so abelian. Thus G must
also be abelian.
Example 29.4
Suppose that |G| = 100; we claim that G has a normal Sylow 5-subgroup. This is true
because by the Third Sylow Theorem n5 ≡1 mod 5 and n5|4. Thus n5 = 1. Therefore
any group of order 100 has at least one normal subgroup. Using the terminology from
Section 27.5, this means that G is not simple.

The Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups
In this section we state the Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups, which com-
pletely describes the structure of such groups. This powerful theorem provides an easy-
to-understand recipe by which all such groups can be constructed, using the two familiar
notions of cyclic group and direct product. The theorem is relatively diﬃcult to prove, and
so we will not prove it here. The interested reader can refer to any introductory text in
group theory. However, we can see how part of the proof goes. Thanks to Corollary 28.3,
if G is a ﬁnite abelian group, it is the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups. Now if G
is (isomorphic to) a direct product of H and K and H is a direct product of H1 and H2,
then G is a direct product of the three groups H1, H2, and K. (See Exercise 29.18.) This,
of course, generalizes to longer direct products. What remains to prove (and the part we
omit) is that an abelian p-group is a direct product of cyclic p-groups.

Example 29.5
What ﬁnite abelian groups of order 8 are possible? Clearly, the cyclic groups used to
build such groups can only have order 2, 4, or 8, and the product of the orders of the
cyclic groups must be 8. So the only possible abelian groups of order 8 are
Z8,
Z4 × Z2,
Z2 × Z2 × Z2.
 Quick Exercise.
We did not include Z2×Z4, because it is isomorphic to Z4×Z2.
Give an isomorphism. 
Are these three groups really non-isomorphic? We can answer this aﬃrmatively by
looking at the orders of elements in these groups. Of them, only Z8 has any elements of
order 8; Z4×Z2 has elements of order 4, while all non-identity elements of Z2×Z2×Z2
are of order 2.

Verify our assertions in the last sentence, thus checking that
these groups are not isomorphic. 
Theorem 29.12
The Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups Every
ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups; each cyclic group in
this decomposition is of order pn, where p is prime. That is, each ﬁnite abelian group is
isomorphic to a group of the form
Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
where the pi’s are primes (not necessarily distinct), and the ki’s are positive integers (not
necessarily distinct). This representation is unique, up to order and isomorphism.
Note that the group
Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
has order pk1
1 pk2
2 · · · pkn
n .
Example 29.6
What ﬁnite abelian groups of order 10 are possible? By the Fundamental Theorem
for Finite Abelian Groups 29.12, since 10 = 2 · 5 (a product of primes), there is only
one possibility: Z2 × Z5. However, you might notice that Z10 is also abelian and of
order 10. But these two groups are isomorphic. This is easy to see, because the element
(1, 1) ∈Z2 × Z5 has order 10, and so this group is cyclic of order 10.
More generally, these two groups are necessarily isomorphic, on account of the
Chinese Remainder Theorem 16.1. Of course, that theorem is phrased as a theorem
about rings, but any cyclic group of the form Zn can be equipped with a ring structure,
and so we can use it here.

Thus, there is (up to isomorphism) only one abelian group of order 10.

Chapter Summary
For a ﬁnite group G with pnm elements, where p is prime and m is relatively prime to p, we
proved the three Sylow Theorems. They assert that G always has subgroups of order pn,
and these subgroups are called the Sylow p-subgroups. Each such subgroup is conjugate to
every other one. If a group has only one such subgroup it is necessarily normal. The number
of such subgroups is always congruent to 1 modulo p, and that number must divide the
order of the group. By way of illustrating the power of these theorems, we applied them to
numerous special cases.
We gave the structure of a ﬁnite abelian group as a direct product of cyclic p-groups
in the Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups; we thus know the structure of all
such groups.

however.

Chapter 30
Solvable Groups
In this chapter we will introduce solvable groups, as a natural generalization of abelian
groups. Solvable groups can be viewed as groups built out of ﬁnitely many abelian pieces.
This gives us a chance to see a bit of how the extension problem in groups is approached;
we discussed these ideas brieﬂy in the historical note at the end of Chapter 27. We will use
the notion of solvability in Chapter 48, when we discuss whether a polynomial equation can
be solved using ordinary arithmetic and the extraction of roots.
30.1
Solvability
The symmetry group S3 is not abelian, but we can think of it as consisting of two abelian
pieces, put together in the appropriate way. Namely, S3 has an abelian subgroup A3, and
the homomorphic image S3/A3 is also abelian. We generalize this idea to ﬁnitely many steps
in our deﬁnition. We say that a group G is solvable if it has a ﬁnite collection of subgroups
G0, G1, · · · Gn, so that
Gn = {1} ⊆Gn−1 ⊆Gn−2 ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G0 = G,
and furthermore each Gi+1 is normal in Gi, and the group of cosets Gi/Gi+1 is abelian.
We shall call such a ﬁnite sequence of subgroups satisfying the deﬁnition of solvability a
subnormal series with abelian quotients for the group G.
The terminology we have chosen for the series required for a solvable group is cum-
bersome, but it is consistent with the mathematical literature. In general, a subnormal
series requires only that each Gi+1 is normal in Gi, without any requirement on the group
Gi/Gi+1. The word ‘subnormal’ places emphasis on the fact that we require only that Gi+1
is normal in the next larger subgroup Gi; it is not necessarily normal in the entire group G.
Example 30.1
We note ﬁrst that any abelian group G is of course solvable because {1} ⊆G is a
subnormal series with abelian quotients.
Example 30.2
The group S3 is solvable because {ι} ⊆A3 ⊆S3, and S3/A3 and A3/{ι} = A3 are
abelian. We can also think of S3 as the symmetries of an equilateral triangle, that is,
as the dihedral group D3. We can now generalize this example to see that any of the
dihedral groups Dn are solvable, because the subgroup of rotations is abelian, and of
index two in Dn.

Example 30.3
The group S4 is solvable, although it will require more than two subgroups to build a
subnormal series with abelian quotients. We will use the notation from Example 25.5,
where we denote by H a subgroup of S4 isomorphic to the Klein Four Group:
{ι} ⊆H ⊆A4 ⊆S4.
Each of these subgroups is normal in the next bigger subgroup. The quotient groups
are abelian because they are isomorphic to H, Z3 and Z2, respectively.
 Quick Exercise.
Check these assertions. 
Example 30.4
The group S5 is not solvable. By Exercise 27.6 we know that A5 is the only non-trivial
normal subgroup of S5. But by Theorem 27.4, A5 is a non-abelian group with no non-
trivial normal subgroups, and so S5 cannot have a solvable series. The fact that S5 is
not solvable will be important for us in Chapter 48.
The next two examples make use of Sylow theory, from Chapter 29.
Example 30.5
Let G be a ﬁnite p-group, where p is a prime integer. Then by Theorem 28.1 we know
that G has pn elements. By the First Sylow Theorem 29.1, we know that G has a
sequence of subgroups
{1} = G0 ⊂G1 ⊂G2 ⊂· · · Gn−1 ⊂Gn = G,
where Gk has pk elements, and Gk is a normal subgroup of Gk+1, for k = 0, . . . , n −
1. But then [Gk+1 : Gk] = p and so Gk+1/Gk is a cyclic group of order p, and is
consequently abelian. Thus every ﬁnite p-group is solvable.
Example 30.6
Let G be a group with 100 elements. In Example 29.4 we discovered that G has exactly
one Sylow 5-subgroup P, which has 25 elements. By Theorem 29.9 P is abelian. By
Corollary 29.5 P is normal in G. Now |G/P| = 4, and so G/P is abelian. Thus any
group with 100 elements is solvable.
30.2
New Solvable Groups from Old
In this section we will present some natural ways to get more solvable groups from a given
solvable group.
Theorem 30.1 Every homomorphic image of a solvable group is solvable.

Chapter 30: Solvable Groups
327
Proof:
Suppose that G is a solvable group with normal subgroup H. We shall assume
that G has the following subnormal series with abelian quotients:
Gn = {1} ⊆Gn−1 ⊆Gn−2 ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G0 = G.
Consider each of the sets HGi = {hg : h ∈H, g ∈Gi}. By Exercise 25.13a we know
that HGi is a subgroup of HGi−1. We claim that HGi is normal in HGi−1. To prove this,
choose h ∈H and a ∈Gi−1. The right coset HGiha = HGia, because H ⊆HGi. But then
HGiha = HGia = H(Gia) = H(aGi) = (Ha)Gi = (aH)Gi = aHGi,
because Gi is normal in Gi−1 and H is normal in G. But aHGi = aa−1haHGi = haHGi,
because a−1ha ∈H. This equality of right and left cosets means that HGi is normal in
HGi−1.
By Exercise 26.12 we have for each i that HGi/H is a normal subgroup of HGi−1/H,
and so we have a subnormal series for G/H:
H/H ⊆HGn−1/H ⊆HGn−2/H ⊆· · · ⊆HG1/H ⊆G/H.
Now by Exercise 26.13
(HGi−1/H)/(HGi/H)
is isomorphic to HGi−1/HGi.
It remains only to show that the latter group is abelian to conclude that G/H is solvable.
For that purpose, suppose that h, k ∈H and a, b ∈Gi−1. Then we can use normality and
the fact that Gi−1/Gi is abelian to conclude the following:
HGi(ha)(kb)
=
HGiakb = HGi(aka−1)ab = HGiab
=
H(Giab) = H(Giba) = HGiba
=
HGi(bhb−1)ba = HGibha = HGi(kb)(ha).
2
A similar proof shows the following:
Theorem 30.2 Every subgroup of a solvable group is solvable.
Proof:
We leave this as Exercise 2.
2
We can also build larger solvable groups, by putting together a normal subgroup and
the corresponding homomorphic image:
Theorem 30.3 Suppose that G is a group with normal subgroup H. Then G is solvable if
and only if G/H is solvable and H is solvable.
Proof:
If G is solvable, the conclusions about H and G/H are just the previous two
theorems.
Now suppose that H and G/H are solvable. Then we have subnormal series with abelian
quotients for both these groups. By Exercise 26.12, we can write the subgroups of G/H in
the form Gi/H:
Hm = {1} ⊆Hm−1 ⊆· · · ⊆H1 ⊆H0 = H
and
Gn/H = H/H ⊆Gn−1/H ⊆· · · ⊆G1/H ⊆G0/H = G/H.

328
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
But then we can put together these subgroups to obtain a subnormal series with abelian
quotients for G:
Hm
=
{1} ⊆Hm−1 ⊆· · · ⊆H1 ⊆H0 = H
⊆
Gn−1 ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G0 = G.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the above series is subnormal with abelian quotients.
Why is Exercise 26.13 relevant?

2
We can informally paraphrase this theorem by asserting that a solvable extension of a
solvable group is solvable. It is easy to extend this inductively to obtain the following:
Theorem 30.4 A group G is solvable if and only if it has a subnormal series
Gn = {1} ⊆Gn−1 ⊆Gn−2 ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G0 = G,
where each quotient group Gi/Gi+1 is solvable.
Proof:
If G is solvable, it has a subnormal series with abelian quotients, which are of
course solvable.
For the converse, suppose that G has such a subnormal series. We will proceed by
induction on n. If n = 1, then G = G0 is obviously solvable. We now suppose that if G has
such a subnormal series with length n −1, it is in fact solvable. Given the series above of
length n, we can now conclude by induction that the group G1 is in fact solvable. But then
G1 is a solvable normal subgroup of G, and by assumption G/G1 is solvable. By Theorem
30.3 G is then solvable.

Historical Remarks
We have barely scratched the surface here regarding the study of group extensions. The
general project of understanding groups in terms of extensions built of simpler pieces is a
large one that we cannot develop fully here. In the general theory, the ‘simpler pieces’ to use
are precisely the simple groups, whose classiﬁcation was such a major part of 20th century
group theory — for more information you should consult the Historical Remarks following
Chapter 27. This idea leads to subnormal series whose quotients are simple; these are called
composition series. (In Exercise 3 you look at this in the speciﬁc context of ﬁnite solvable
groups.) Any ﬁnite group has such a composition series (see Exercise 7). That the factor
groups in such a series are unique (up to order) is an important theorem proved by Camille
Jordan in the context of permutation groups, and in the general case by Otto H¨older.
One of the most important steps in the classiﬁcation problem for ﬁnite simple groups
was the diﬃcult theorem of John Thompson and Walter Feit that all ﬁnite groups of odd
order are in fact solvable! Consequently, we need look only to groups with even order in our
search for ﬁnite simple groups. The Feit-Thompson Theorem took up an entire issue of the
Paciﬁc Journal of Mathematics, when the theorem was ﬁrst published in 1963.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we explored the notion of solvable group. Such groups can be built as ﬁnitely
many abelian extensions of an abelian group, and as such are a natural generalization of
the abelian groups. We then saw how the class of solvable groups is closed under taking
subgroups, homomorphic images, and building group extensions.

Section VI in a Nutshell
We examine more deeply the permutations of the symmetric groups Sn. A transposition
is a cycle of length two. Any permutation can be factored as a product of transpositions
(Theorem 27.1), and while this factorization is not unique, all factorizations of a given
permutation have the same parity; thus we can classify a permutation as either even or
odd. The set An of even permutations is a group called the nth alternating group. The
alternating group An is a normal subgroup of the symmetric group Sn and [Sn : An] = 2.
Furthermore, An is simple for n ̸= 4.
A group G acts on a set X if there is a homomorphism σ : G →SX. Notationally
we simplify things by letting g(x) = y if g ∈G acts of the element x by sending it to y.
(Obviously, x, y ∈X.) If G acts on X, then the orbit of x ∈X is
Orb(x) = {y ∈X : g(x) = y, for some g ∈G}.
The orbits partition X. So, if x1, . . . , xk are representatives of the disjoint orbits, |X| =
P |Orb(xi)|.
For x ∈X, the stabilizer of x is
Stab(x) = {g ∈G : g(x) = x}.
Stab(x) is a subgroup of G and
|Orb(x)| = [G : Stab(x)]. (Theorem 28.5.)
Thus the size of every orbit divides the order of G (Corollary 28.6). Groups acting on sets
is the main technique used in proving the three Sylow Theorems of Chapter 29.
Given prime p, a group is a p-group if the order of every element is a power of p. A
ﬁnite group G is a p-group if and only if |G| = pn for some n (Theorem 28.1). A Sylow
p-subgroup of a group G is a maximal p-subgroup of G. The three Sylow Theorems are:
• (First Sylow Theorem 29.1)
Let G be a ﬁnite group, p a prime, and |G| = pnm where
p does not divide m. Then G has a subgroup of order pk for k = 0, 1, . . . , n. Indeed,
for k = 0, . . . , n −1, each subgroup of order pk is a normal subgroup of a subgroup of
order pk+1.
• (Second Sylow Theorem 29.4)
For every prime p, the Sylow p-subgroups of G are
conjugate.
• (Third Sylow Theorem 29.6)
Let G be a ﬁnite group where |G| = pnm with p prime
and p does not divide m. The number of Sylow p-subgroups divides m. Furthermore,
this number if congruent to 1 modulo p.
Thus Sylow p-subgroups exist (First Sylow Theorem), all Sylow p-subgroups are con-
jugate for each prime p (Second Sylow Theorem), and the number of Sylow p-subgroups
satisﬁes some restrictions (Third Sylow Theorem). The First Sylow Theorem gives us a
partial converse to Lagrange’s Theorem guaranteeing the existence of p-subgroups of G, for
all possible orders pk.
One important consequence of the Sylow Theorems is that if G is a ﬁnite abelian group
of order r and m divides r, then G has a subgroup of order m (Corollary 29.10). That
is, G has subgroups of every possible order. Thus, in the case of ﬁnite abelian groups, the
converse of Lagrange’s Theorem is true.
330

Another consequence is that there is exactly one Sylow p-subgroup of a group G if
and only if it is normal (Corollary 29.5). All the Sylow p-subgroups of a ﬁnite group G
are normal if and only if G is isomorphic to the direct product of its Sylow p-subgroups
(Theorem 29.11).
All ﬁnite abelian groups are direct products of p-groups (Corollary 28.3). Indeed, if
p1, p2, . . . , pn are the distinct primes dividing |G|, then G is a direct product of pi-groups.
All ﬁnite abelian groups can be completely described by the Fundamental Theorem for
Finite Abelian Groups (Theorem 29.12): Every ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct
product of cyclic groups; each cyclic group in this decomposition is of order pn, where p is
prime. That is, each ﬁnite abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form
Zpk1
1 × Zpk2
2 × · · · × Zpkn
n
where the pi’s are primes (not necessarily distinct), and the ki’s are positive integers (not
necessarily distinct).
Finally, the idea of abelian group is generalized by the idea of solvable groups. A group
is solvable if it has a ﬁnite collection of subgroups G0, G1, · · · Gn, so that
Gn = {1} ⊆Gn−1 ⊆Gn−2 ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G0 = G,
and furthermore each Gi+1 is normal in Gi, and the group of cosets Gi/Gi+1 is abelian.
Such a sequence of subgroups is called a subnormal series with abelian quotients for G. An
important group that is not solvable is S5 (Example 30.4). We will use this fact in Section
X.
Every homomorphic image of a solvable group is also solvable (Theorem 30.1) as is every
subgroup of a solvable group (Theorem 30.2). In fact, if G has a normal subgroup H, then
G is solvable if and only if both H and G/H are solvable (Theorem 30.3).

Chapter 31
Quadratic Extensions of the Integers
Our goal in this section of the text is to discover which integral domains have a unique
factorization theorem like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. That is, we wish to
obtain a common generalization of Z and Q[x]. As we shall see, there are two stages to
obtain such a unique factorization theorem. First, we need to see whether elements in an
arbitrary integral domain can even be factored into irreducibles at all, and then focus our
attention on whether such a factorization is unique (up to order and unit factors).
To better understand these questions, we need a richer fund of examples. For that
purpose we will in this chapter explore rings of the form Z[√n]; we ﬁrst met these rings in
Exercise 7.2. We will conclude this chapter by proving that in all such rings, we can at least
factor every non-unit into a product of irreducible elements.
31.1
Quadratic Extensions of the Integers
Let n be an integer (positive or negative), other than 1. Suppose further that n has no
non-trivial factors that are perfect squares. We call such an integer square-free. Thus, −21
is square-free, while 18 is not. As we did in Exercise 7.2, we deﬁne a subset of C as follows:
Z[√n] = {a + b√n : a, b ∈Z},
which we call a quadratic extension of Z. Our restriction to n being square-free is merely
to ensure that no rational simpliﬁcation is necessary under the radical sign. In particular,
if n is square-free, we know that √n is an irrational number (see Exercise 15). Notice that
if n is positive, the quadratic extension consists of a set of real numbers. The case where
n = −1 is of particular importance; this is called the ring of Gaussian integers and is
usually written Z[i] (as we noted in Exercise 6.12).
It is an easy matter to use the Subring Theorem 7.1 to check that these sets are subrings
of C (and you explored this in Exercises 6.12, 7.1, and 7.2.) We need merely to see that
Z[√n] is non-empty, and closed under subtraction and multiplication:
 Quick Exercise.
Carry out these veriﬁcations (or consult your solution to Exercise
7.2). 
What are the units and irreducibles of these rings? This general question actually turns
out to be a fairly sophisticated inquiry from number theory, and we cannot give a general
answer here. We will make some progress on this question, particularly in special cases.

Units in Quadratic Extensions
Let’s see ﬁrst what the question regarding units amounts to. If a + b√n is a unit, then we
have an equation of the form
(a + b√n)(c + d√n) = (ac + nbd) + (ad + bc)√n = 1.
This means that we must ﬁnd all simultaneous solutions a, b, c, d to the equations ac+nbd =
1 and ad + bc = 0, where a, b, c, d are integers (recall that here n is ﬁxed). Equations where
we require integer solutions are called Diophantine equations. Study of such equations
makes up an important branch of number theory. In Exercise 1, you will try to solve this
pair of equations directly in the particular case of the Gaussian integers (that is, where
n = −1).
However, in the long run we will be better oﬀby recalling our geometric representation
for complex numbers introduced in Chapter 8. Let us view the Gaussian integers as points
in the complex plane.
Recall that for a complex number ρ = r + si, we computed its modulus (or length)
as |ρ| =
√
r2 + s2. (Actually, in what follows we will often use the square of the modulus
instead, because in our present context that will be an integer.) What is important for us
is that the modulus function preserve multiplication. By this we mean that |ρτ| = |ρ| |τ|,
for any pair of complex numbers ρ, τ. If you don’t recall this fact, it would be well worth
reviewing the proof of Theorem 8.3 now.
The fact that this function preserves multiplication means that we can translate certain
algebraic questions about Z[i] into questions in the integers Z, where they are presumably
easier to answer.
For example, suppose that α ∈Z[i] is a unit. Then there exists another Gaussian integer
β for which αβ = 1. But then we have that
|α|2 |β|2 = |αβ|2 = |1|2 = 1.
Since |α|2 and |β|2 are positive integers, this means that |α|2 = |β|2 = 1. Hence, if a
Gaussian integer α = a + bi is a unit, then a2 + b2 = 1. It is then easy to check in Z that
the only solutions to this equation are a = ±1 and b = 0, or vice versa. That is, the units of
Z[i] consist precisely of {1, −1, i, −i}, the four points on the unit circle in the complex plane
at angles 0, π/2, π, 3π/2. Notice that we have arrived at this conclusion much more easily
than by directly solving the appropriate Diophantine equations, as in Exercise 1. (Notice
also that this discussion is precisely a solution to Exercise 8.5.)
What we would really like to do is to equip Z[√n] with a function playing the same
role as the square of the modulus does for the Gaussian integers, where n is any square-free
integer. The function we propose to use is the following. Let N : Z[√n] 7→N∪{0} be deﬁned
by setting
N(a + b√n) = |(a + b√n)(a −b√n)| = |a2 −nb2|.
We call N(α) the norm of α.
Notice that if n is negative (as in the case of the Gaussian integers), this is merely the
square of the ordinary complex modulus, and is automatically non-negative; consequently,
the absolute value sign in the deﬁnition is superﬂuous. However, if n is positive, we need
the absolute value, or else we might not get non-negative integer values. And note that as
long as n is square-free, N(α) = 0 only if α = 0 (otherwise, √n would be rational, which
contradicts Exercise 15).
In order to use the function N as we did | · |2 for the Gaussian integers, we need to show
that it preserves multiplication:

Chapter 31: Quadratic Extensions of the Integers
337
Theorem 31.1 Let n be a square-free integer, and let α, β ∈Z[√n]. Then N(αβ) =
N(α)N(β).
Proof:
This proof is similar in ﬂavor to that given for Theorem 8.3 and is left to the
reader; see Exercise 2.
2
We now show that the norm is useful for identifying units, in any of the rings Z[√n]:
Theorem 31.2 Let n be a square-free integer, and let α ∈Z[√n]. Then α is a unit if and
only if N(α) = 1.
Proof:
Suppose that n is a square-free integer, and α ∈Z[√n] is a unit. Then there exists
β with αβ = 1. But then application of the function N gives us N(α)N(β) = 1. Because
all values of the norm function are non-negative integers, we must have that N(α) = 1, as
required.
Conversely, suppose that N(α) = 1. But if α = a + b√n, this means that (a + b√n)(a −
b√n) = 1 or −1, which means that a −b√n (or −a + b√n) is the required multiplicative
inverse.

 Quick Exercise.
Notice that 52 −6(2)2 = 1. What units does this provide for the ring
Z[
√
6]? 
Let us for the moment restrict ourselves to the question of explicitly determining the
units in quadratic extensions of the form Z[√n], where n is negative. If in this case α =
a + b√n is a unit, then 1 = N(α) = a2 −nb2. If n = −1, this is the case of the Gaussian
integers, and we get {1, −1, i, −i} as the units, exactly as before. But if n < −1, then there
are no solutions to this equation if b > 0. And so the only units in this case are ±1.
 Quick Exercise.
Check for yourself the solutions to the equation 1 = a2 −nb2, when
n < −1.

Once we know the units for a ring, we know which elements are associates of which. For
example, what are the associates of 3 + i in Z[i]? They are (1)(3 + i) = 3 + i, (−1)(3 + i) =
−3 −i, (i)(3 + i) = −1 + 3i, and (−i)(3 + i) = 1 −3i.
 Quick Exercise.
What are the associates of a + bi in Z[i]? 
Example 31.1
What are the associates of a given element in Z[√−5]? The only units in this ring are
±1 + 0√−5 = ±1. Thus, the only associates of an element in Z[√−5] are the element
itself and its negative.
Let’s now turn to the case Z[√n], for n > 0. If we wish to ﬁnd the units of Z[√n], when
n is a positive square-free integer, we must solve the Diophantine equation |a2 −nb2| = 1.
In the Quick Exercise after Theorem 31.2 we actually gave a solution to this equation for
n = 6, which then gave us units in Z[
√
6].
Unfortunately however, this is in general a rather more subtle question than the corre-
sponding question when n < 0. We are looking for integers a, b satisfying either a2 = nb2+1,
or else nb2 = a2 + 1, where n is a constant positive square-free integer. Such Diophantine
equations have a long history and are known as Pell’s equations. The description of how such
equations are solved in general is a fascinating piece of mathematics that is unfortunately
beyond the scope of our text.

Example 31.2
For n = 2, observe that a = 1 and b = 1 does in fact give a solution, because |12 −
2(1)2| = 1. Thus, 1 + 1
√
2 is a unit for Z[
√
2].
We have already observed in Section 8.2 that in any ring the set of units is closed
under multiplication, and so this means that (1 +
√
2)2 must also be a unit in Z[
√
2],
and indeed so is (1 +
√
2)n, for any positive integer n. Furthermore, each of these
units is distinct: Since 1 +
√
2 > 1, these numbers form a list of strictly increasing real
numbers.
Notice that we could also have concluded that the positive powers of α are units
by observing that if N(α) = 1, then N(αn) = (N(α))n = 1n = 1. But this even makes
sense for negative exponents. After all, because 1+
√
2 is a unit, (1+
√
2)−1 = −1+
√
2
is a unit of Z[
√
2], and so all elements of the form (1 +

(−1 +

2)n are units too.

Why is (1 +

But −1 is a unit too (it is its own multiplicative inverse), and so we obtain the
following lists of units of Z[

It turns out (though we will not prove it here) that this is a complete list.
This inﬁnite list of units means that detecting whether or not two elements in
Z[
√
2] are associates is not the trivial matter it is in Z (or even in Z[i]). For example,
4+

Notice that in any of these quadratic extension rings, it is obvious that if two elements

Why do two elements that are associates have the same norm? 
It is tempting to conjecture that the converse of this statement is true, but you will
demonstrate by explicit example in Exercise 12 two elements of such a ring, with the same
norm, which are not associates.

31.3
Irreducibles in Quadratic Extensions
In order to pursue a Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for quadratic extensions of Z, we
must now explore the irreducible elements of these rings; as we discussed in Section 15.1,
elements are irreducible if they admit no ‘non-trivial’ factorizations.
So what about irreducibles for Z[√n] (for any square-free n)? First observe that if N(α)
is an irreducible (integer), then certainly α itself is an irreducible. For if α = βγ, then the
norm of exactly one of β and γ must be 1 (because N(α) is a (positive) irreducible in Z)
and units are exactly those elements of Z[√n] which have norm one. We state this result
for emphasis:
Theorem 31.3 Let n be a square-free integer, and α ∈Z[√n]. If N(α) is a prime integer,
then α is irreducible in Z[√n].
Example 31.3
Thus, 2 + 5√−5 is irreducible in Z[√−5], because N(2 + 5√−5) = 129, which is prime
(in Z). And 1 + 2
√
2 is irreducible in Z[
√
2], because its norm is 7.
Example 31.4
Notice that 1+i is irreducible in the Gaussian integers. But because 2 = (1+i)(1−i),
2 (an irreducible in Z) is not an irreducible in Z[i].
 Quick Exercise.
Use Theorem 31.3 to ﬁnd some irreducible elements in Z[
√
6] and in
Z[√−3]. 
Unfortunately, the converse of Theorem 31.3 is false. That is, there exist irreducibles
that do not have prime norm.
Example 31.5
For example, we claim that 1 + √−5 (which has norm 6) is irreducible in Z[√−5]. For
if it had a non-trivial factorization, the factors would have to have norms of 2 and 3.
But this would require integer solutions of the Diophantine equations a2 +5b2 = 2 and
a2 + 5b2 = 3. Obviously, no such solutions are possible.
Example 31.6
Similarly, we claim that 3 is irreducible in Z[
√
2], even though the norm of 3 is 9
(which is not prime in Z). In this case we would need solutions of at least one of the
Diophantine equations a2 = 2b2 + 3 or 2b2 = a2 + 3. Suppose by way of contradiction
that the ﬁrst of these equations did in fact have a solution. Then a would have to be
an odd integer, and so a = 2k + 1. But then (2k + 1)2 = 2b2 + 3, or after a little
algebra, 2k2 + 2k = b2 + 1. This means that b must be odd, and so b = 2m + 1. Then
2k2 + 2k = (2m + 1)2 + 1, or after simpliﬁcation, k2 + k = 2m2 + 2m + 1. But
k2 + k, as the product of consecutive integers, is necessarily even, while 2m2 + 2m + 1
is necessarily odd. This contradiction shows that no integer solution to the equation
a2 = 2b2 + 3 is possible. We leave it to you to check (see Exercise 4) that there is
no solution to the other equation either. This means there are no members of Z[
√
2]
which have norm 3, and so 3 (with norm 9) has no non-trivial factorizations.

340
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
The fact that it required this excursion into number theory to prove that 3 is irreducible
in Z[
√
2] might convince you that the general question of determining all irreducibles for
quadratic extensions of Z is diﬃcult. This is in fact the case, and we will not pursue the
matter here.
31.4
Factorization for Quadratic Extensions
You should now recall the proof that every integer can be factored into irreducibles (and
the analogous proof for Q[x]). Both of these proofs depend heavily on the fact that N is
well ordered: By continuing to extract factors from a positive integer, we decrease its size,
and we cannot continue this indeﬁnitely. And for Q[x], by continuing to extract non-trivial
factors from a polynomial of degree greater than 1, we decrease the degree, and we cannot
continue this indeﬁnitely. Can we apply this technique to Z[√n]?
We have exactly the appropriate tool at hand: The norm function N provides a measure
of size. In fact, it shouldn’t be too surprising that this might work, because the norm
function takes values precisely in the set of non-negative integers. We can now prove the
following:
Theorem 31.4
Factorization Theorem for Quadratic Extensions of Z
Let n
be a square-free integer. Then every non-zero non-unit of Z[√n] is either irreducible or a
product of irreducibles.
Proof:
Let α ̸= 0 be a non-unit of Z[√n]. We proceed by induction on N(α). By Theorem
31.2, N(α) ̸= 1. Now if N(α) = 2, then α is itself irreducible, by Theorem 31.3.
Now suppose the theorem holds true for all β with N(β) < m. If α is irreducible
already, we are done. If not, then α = βγ, where both factors are non-units. But because
N(α) = N(β)N(γ) and N(β) > 1 and N(γ) > 1, we have that N(β) < m and N(γ) < m.
By the induction hypothesis both β and γ can be factored as a product of irreducibles and,
thus, so can their product α.

 Quick Exercise.
Find irreducible elements in Z[i] and Z[√−7] that have norm 2. 
It is of great importance to note that we have neither claimed nor proved that the
factorization into irreducibles provided by this theorem is unique. There is good reason for
this: For suitable choice of n, such factorizations are not unique.
To see this, consider the following two factorizations of 6 in Z[√−5]:
6 = (1 +
√
−5) · (1 −
√
−5) = 2 · 3.
We argued in Example 31.5 that 1 + √−5 is irreducible, and a similar argument applies for
the other factors in the two given factorizations.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that 1 −√−5, 2, and 3 are irreducible in Z[√−5], by consid-
ering their norms. 
Now, if a unique factorization theorem applied for Z[√−5], this would mean that these
two factorizations would be the same, up to order and unit factors. But it is quite easy to
see that 2 is not an associate of either 1 + √−5 or 1 −√−5, because associates must have
the same norm. In Exercise 7, you will provide two essentially distinct factorizations of 8 in
Z[√−7].

Chapter 31: Quadratic Extensions of the Integers
341
In contrast, we shall see later that we will have a unique factorization into irreducibles,
for some quadratic extensions of the integers. We have thus seen that these rings provide
us with some crucial examples which will delineate the theory.
Chapter Summary
We introduced the quadratic extensions of the integers and looked at units and irreducibles
in such rings, making heavy use of the norm function. We were able to prove that in any
such ring, non-units can be factored into irreducible elements. However, we discovered by
example that such factorizations are not always unique.

Chapter 32
Factorization
In this chapter we ﬁrst discuss what is required to be able to factor each non-unit as a
product of irreducibles. We will then inquire into the condition necessary to force that such
factorizations be unique.
32.1
How Might Factorization Fail?
To make a more general attack on the factorization problem, let us think about how fac-
torization into irreducibles in a domain R could fail. Suppose then that 0 ̸= a1 ∈R is
not irreducible and is not the product of irreducibles. Then there exists a factorization
a1 = a2b2, where neither a2 nor b2 is a unit. Furthermore, because a1 cannot be factored
into a product of irreducibles, this must be true of at least one of a2 or b2. To be speciﬁc,
let’s suppose that a2 can’t be so factored. But then a2 can be factored as a2 = a3b3, where
neither a3 nor b3 is a unit, and where a3 cannot be factored into a product of irreducibles.
If we continue in this fashion, we obtain an inﬁnite sequence of non-trivial factorizations:
a1 = a2b2,
a2 = a3b3,
a3 = a4b4,
· · ·
where every element in sight is a non-unit.
But we can rephrase this inﬁnite sequence, using the language of principal ideals ⟨a⟩,
which consist precisely of the multiples of a in R. Our sequence of factorizations clearly in
part asserts that
⟨a1⟩⊆⟨a2⟩⊆⟨a3⟩⊆· · · .
But we claim further that these containments are proper. This follows immediately from
Theorem 9.3, which asserts that two principal ideals in an integral domain are equal exactly
if the elements are associates. Since in our sequence the factorizations are all non-trivial,
no element an in the sequence can be an associate of the next element an+1.
We thus have that our inﬁnite sequence of proper factorizations leads to an inﬁnite
ascending sequence of principal ideals, each being strictly larger than its predecessor.
Example 32.1
Let’s consider an example of these ideas and this notation in the ring Z. Consider
the integer 360. By successively factoring 360, we might obtain the following chain of
inclusions:
⟨360⟩⊂⟨180⟩⊂⟨60⟩⊂⟨20⟩⊂⟨10⟩⊂⟨5⟩.
We cannot continue any further in this example, precisely because 5 is irreducible and
so admits no further non-trivial factorization. Of course, we know already that Z has a
factorization theorem, and so we should have expected this chain of inclusions to halt.
345

346
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
The argument above about the potential lack of factorization is important enough for
us that we will record its conclusion as a lemma:
Lemma 32.1 Let R be a domain and 0 ̸= a1 an element of R that is neither irreducible
nor the product of irreducibles. Then there exist non-units a2, a3, a4, · · ·, such that
⟨a1⟩⊂⟨a2⟩⊂⟨a3⟩⊂· · · .
• a1
• a2
• a3
• • •
For a speciﬁc example of a domain which has a non-zero non-unit which is neither
irreducible, nor can it be factored as a product of irreducibles, see Exercise 10.
32.2
PIDs Have Unique Factorization
We now obtain the following elegant theorem that provides a suﬃcient condition for
factorization into irreducibles.
Theorem 32.2
Factorization Theorem for PIDs
In a principal ideal domain,
every non-zero non-unit is either irreducible or a product of irreducibles.
Proof:
Suppose by way of contradiction that R is a PID with at least one non-zero non-
unit that is neither irreducible nor factorable as a product of irreducibles. By Lemma 32.1,
we then have a properly ascending chain of principal ideals, where each ai is a non-unit:
⟨a1⟩⊂⟨a2⟩⊂⟨a3⟩⊂· · · .
Consider now the set I = S{⟨ai⟩: i ∈N}. We claim that this is an ideal. First, we check
that I is closed under subtraction. Given x, y ∈I, there exist i and j such that x ∈⟨ai⟩
and y ∈⟨aj⟩. Suppose (without loss of generality) that j is the larger of i and j. Then
x, y ∈⟨aj⟩, and so x −y ∈⟨aj⟩⊆I. Now I also satisﬁes the multiplicative absorption
property: Suppose that x ∈I and r ∈R. There exists i so that x ∈⟨ai⟩, an ideal. So,
rx ∈⟨ai⟩⊆I. Thus, I is an ideal.
Because R is a PID, I = ⟨a⟩, for some a ∈R. But I is the union of the ⟨aj⟩’s, and so
a ∈⟨aj⟩, for some j; thus, ⟨a⟩= ⟨aj⟩. But then
⟨a⟩= ⟨aj⟩= ⟨aj+1⟩= ⟨aj+2⟩= · · · ,
which is contrary to our assumption. This contradiction means that every non-unit can be
factored into irreducibles.
2
This abstract proof now gives an alternate approach to seeing that factorization holds
for Z and for Q[x]. The additional abstraction of this proof makes it more powerful. As we
shall see, it applies to many more domains than our two familiar examples.

Chapter 32: Factorization
347
An important generalization of one of the ideas in the proof above is due to the great Ger-
man mathematician Emmy Noether, who in the 1920s laid much of the important ground-
work for axiomatic ring theory. She isolated as particularly important those commutative
rings where every ascending sequence of ideals is ﬁnite. That is, if a set of ideals In is totally
ordered under inclusion
I1 ⊆I2
⊆I3 ⊆· · · ⊆In ⊆· · ·
then there must exist an integer j for which Ij = Ij+1 = · · ·. We have seen in the proof above
that PIDs satisfy this property. Such commutative rings are said to have the ascending
chain condition (ACC for short) on ideals, and are called Noetherian.
32.3
Primes
You should now recall the proof of the uniqueness of factorization into irreducibles for Z (or
Q[x]). Our intent in this section is to construct a more general context in which this proof is
true. This proof relies heavily on the fact that irreducible elements in Z (or Q[x]) are in fact
prime. It should not then be surprising that a general unique factorization theorem should
rely on the same considerations. We now deﬁne prime elements in an arbitrary domain: A
non-unit p ̸= 0 of a domain R is a prime if, whenever p divides ab, then p divides a or b.
Example 32.2
Under this new deﬁnition, the prime integers remain prime in Z. And the irreducible
polynomials in Q[x] are prime also.
Example 32.3
Let’s show directly that the element
√
3 is prime in the domain Z[
√
3]. For that purpose,
we must suppose that
√
3 divides a product αβ, where α, β ∈Z[
√
3]. Now α = a+b
√
3
and β = c + d
√
3, and
αβ = (ac + 3bd) + (ad + bc)
√
3.
If
√
3 divides this product, it must clearly divide the rational part ac + 3bd. But
√
3
obviously divides 3, and so
√
3 must divide ac in Z[
√
3]. But ac is an integer, and so
the only way this can occur is if 3 actually divides ac. Now 3 is a prime integer, and
so (without loss of generality) 3 divides a. But then
√
3 divides a + b
√
3, as required.
Note that an easy inductive proof (identical to that for Z) shows that if p is prime and
it divides a product of n terms, then p divides at least one of the factors. (See Exercise 2.5
and Exercise 5.3.)
Now examine the proof that for Z, irreducible and prime elements are the same (Theorem
2.7). Notice that the proof that primeness implies irreducibility is general, while the converse
depends on the GCD identity (a theorem which need not hold for arbitrary domains). We
thus have the following:
Theorem 32.3 In any domain, prime elements are irreducible.
Proof:
Check that the proof for Z (Theorem 2.7) holds in general. (This is Exercise 1.)2

Example 32.4
The converse of this theorem is in general false, and the factorization
6 = 2 · 3 = (1 +
√
−5)(1 −
√
−5)
in Z[√−5] that we considered in Section 31.4 provides the counterexample, for 2 is
irreducible, yet it divides (1 + √−5)(1 −√−5) without dividing either factor and
hence is not prime.
The previous example ﬁnally justiﬁes our long-standing careful distinction between the
concepts of irreducibility and primeness.
The following theorem now shows that uniqueness of factorization fails in a domain
exactly when the concepts of irreducibility and primeness fail to coincide:
Theorem 32.4 Consider a domain in which every non-zero non-unit is either an irre-
ducible or a product of irreducibles. Then all irreducible elements are prime if and only if
the factorization of non-units into irreducibles is unique, up to order and unit factors.
Proof:
Suppose that D is a domain with unique factorization, and p is an irreducible
element. We wish to show that p is prime and toward that end assume that p|ab. Then
pc = ab, for some c ∈D. Now factor c, a, and b into irreducibles, thus obtaining the
following equation:
pc1c2 . . . ck = a1a2 . . . amb1b2 . . . bn.
By the uniqueness of the factorization of pc, p must be an associate of some ai or bj; that
is, p|a or p|b, as required.
For the other direction, check that the proof for Q[x] works in general. (This is Exercise
2; see Theorem 5.4.)

Example 32.5
In Exercise 31.7 you obtained two essentially distinct factorizations of 8 in Z[√−7];
namely, as
2 · 2 · 2 = (1 +
√
−7)(1 −
√
−7).
Theorem 32.4 means that of necessity Z[√−7] must possess some element that is
irreducible but not prime. It is in fact easy in this case to identify a particular element
that plays this role.
 Quick Exercise.
What element is that? 
If you did Exercise 15.2, you have encountered the idea of a prime element before. While
not directly relevant to our study of factorization here, it remains interesting that the notion
of prime element can be rephrased in terms of the corresponding principal ideal: The non-
unit p ̸= 0 is a prime element if and only if the principal ideal ⟨p⟩is a prime ideal. This
can and should be placed alongside the characterization of irreducible elements in Theorem
15.1 as those elements p for which the ⟨p⟩is maximal anong principal ideals. In order to
obtain uniqueness of factorization in a domain with factorization, we need that these two
conditions are the same.

Chapter 33
Unique Factorization
We know that in a principal ideal domain, every non-unit can be factored into irreducibles,
and we know what we must show to guarantee the uniqueness of such a factorization: We
must show that every irreducible element is prime. In this chapter we are able to show that
this is true for any PID.
33.1
UFDs
We now introduce some convenient terminology: A unique factorization domain (or
UFD) is a domain in which all non-zero non-units can be factored uniquely (up to units
and order) into irreducibles. More concretely, uniqueness of factorization means that if a is
a non-unit, and
a = a1a2 · · · an = b1b2 · · · bm,
where the ai and bi are irreducibles, then n = m, and under some rearrangement of the bi
we ﬁnd ai and bi are associates, for i = 1, · · · n.
Let’s now rephrase Theorem 32.4 in light of our new terminology: We showed that if
factorization of non-units into irreducibles is always possible, then the domain is a UFD if
and only if each irreducible element is prime. Following the model of our PIDs Z and Q[x],
we’d now like to prove that all PIDs are UFDs. Because we already know that factorization
occurs in PIDs (Theorem 32.2), we can complete this proof by showing that in a PID all
irreducible elements are prime.
33.2
A Comparison between Z and Z[√−5]
Before we prove that every PID is a UFD, we should look more closely into our example
where unique factorization fails, namely in the domain Z[√−5]. In Section 31.4 we showed
that the element 6 can be factored into irreducibles in two ways, namely
6 = 2 · 3 = (1 +
√
−5) · (1 −
√
−5).
We would like to look at this example in terms of the ideals in this domain. Consider for
example the irreducible 3 in Z[√−5]. Because 3 is irreducible, we know by Theorem 15.1
that ⟨3⟩is maximal among proper principal ideals; but it need not be maximal among all
proper ideals (because Z[√−5] may have non-principal ideals). And indeed, we showed in
Example 14.6 that ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is an ideal by providing a ring homomorphism of which it
is the kernel. Now clearly 1 + √−5 /∈⟨3⟩, and so ⟨3⟩⊂⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩.
351


Now since ⟨3⟩is maximal among all principal ideals, this must mean that ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩
is not principal, as long as it is a proper ideal! But it is clearly proper, because in Example
14.6 we showed that
⟨3, 1 +
√
−5⟩= {a + b
√
−5 : 3|(a −b)}.
 Quick Exercise.
Use this characterization to give elements of Z[√−5] that do not
belong to the ideal.

Our argument that ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is not a principal ideal, was indirect. Let’s provide an
explicit computational argument also. So suppose by way of contradiction that this ideal is
generated by α = a + b√−5. But then 3 and 1 + √−5 are multiples of α, and so the norm
N(α) divides both N(3) = 9 and N(1 + √−5) = 6. This means that N(α) is either 1 or
3. It can’t be 1 (because then it would be a unit, which can’t be an element of a proper
ideal), and it can’t be 3 because (as we observed in Example 31.5) the Diophantine equation
a2 + 5b2 = 3 has no solutions. Thus, we have concluded again that the ideal ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is
a non-principal ideal in Z[√−5]. (If you have done Exercise 14.10, you have already made
this argument.)
Now we claim that the ideal ⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩is maximal in Z[√−5]. But we concluded this
in Example 15.11, simply because the ideal is the kernel of a ring homomorphism onto a
ﬁeld.
But perhaps a direct computational argument would be illuminating. We need to show
that if a + b√−5 /∈⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩, then ⟨3, 1 + √−5, a + b√−5⟩is the whole domain. We
show this by giving a linear combination of these three elements equal to 1. But recall that
⟨3, 1 + √−5⟩= {x + y√−5 : 3|(x −y)}. Because a + b√−5 is not in this ideal, this means
that a−b is not divisible by 3 (and hence, relatively prime to 3). Thus, by the GCD identity
for Z, there are integers z and w with 3z + (a −b)w = 1. But then
1 = z(3) + (−bw)(1 +
√
−5) + (w)(a + b
√
−5),
the linear combination which we required.
Notice the distinction between Z and Z[√−5]: In Z the ideal ⟨a, b⟩is always principal,
and a generator is gcd(a, b), which can be expressed as ax+by for some x and y; see Exercise
15.7. In particular, if a and b have no common divisors (other than ±1), then 1 can be so
expressed. That is, ⟨1⟩= ⟨a, b⟩if and only if a and b have no non-trivial common divisors.
On the other hand, in Z[√−5], 3 and 1 + √−5 have no common divisors (except units),
but ‘ought to’, because
1 /∈⟨3, 1 +
√
−5⟩⊂Z[
√
−5].
This is precisely why the 19th-century German mathematician Ernst Kummer ﬁrst used
the term ‘ideal’. He viewed an ideal like ⟨3, 1+√−5⟩as an ‘ideal number’ playing the role of
a gcd for 3 and 1+√−5, and thus ﬁlling in a gap in the multiplicative structure of Z[√−5].
This, as we shall see, is one of the advantages of considering ideals, instead of elements.
Actually, Kummer’s formulation of ideal was diﬀerent than ours; our deﬁnition is due to
Richard Dedekind. The crux of the Dedekind version of the deﬁnition is to identify the ‘ideal
number’ with the set of all those numbers that ought to be its multiples. The set-theoretic
nature of this deﬁnition is typical of a modern mathematical deﬁnition; Dedekind was a
pioneer of this set-theoretic approach, and not only to the deﬁnition of ideal, but also in his
axiomatic construction of the real numbers.

Chapter 33: Unique Factorization

33.3
All PIDs Are UFDs
We can now use what we have learned about ideals in PIDs to prove the following crucial
theorem, which allows us to then conclude that all PIDs are UFDs:
Theorem 33.1 In a PID, all irreducibles are prime.
Proof:
Suppose p is irreducible in the PID D. To show that p is prime, we suppose further
that p|ab. We claim that p|a or p|b. Suppose that p does not divide a. Then a /∈⟨p⟩, and so
⟨p⟩⊂⟨a, p⟩. Because ⟨p⟩is maximal this means that ⟨a, p⟩= D, and so 1 ∈⟨a, p⟩. That is,
1 = ax + py, for some x, y ∈D. But then b = abx + pby. Now p|pby and p|abx, and so p|b.
Thus, p is prime, as claimed.
2
We have actually encountered special cases of the previous argument twice before:
Namely, for Z (in the proof of Theorem 2.7) and for Q[x] (in the proof of Theorem 5.2,
where you did the proving). What we used in those arguments was the GCD identity. In
the argument above we arrive at the conclusion 1 = ax + py by using the fact that ⟨p⟩is a
maximal ideal.
From Chapter 32 we know that any non-unit in a PID is irreducible or factorable into
irreducibles (Theorem 32.2). From Theorem 32.4 we know that uniqueness of factorization
is equivalent to irreducible elements being prime. Because we’ve just proved that this is true
in a PID, we have the following theorem:
Theorem 33.2 Any PID is a UFD.
This theorem thus encompasses both the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for Z,
and the Unique Factorization Theorem for Q[x]. In Chapter 35 we will discover other PIDs
as well, and hence other UFDs too.
The natural question to ask at this point is: Is the converse of this theorem true? That
is, are all UFDs PIDs? The answer is no, and we have already encountered a domain which
will serve as a counterexample. That domain is Z[x]. In Example 9.12 we argued that ⟨2, x⟩
is a non-principal ideal, and so Z[x] is not a PID. It thus remains to show that this domain
is in fact a UFD. In order to accomplish this, we will need to inquire more carefully into
the relationship between Z[x] and Q[x]. Note that the relationship cannot be too simple,
because the former ring is not a PID, while the latter ring is. This inquiry is the subject of
Chapter 34; it requires Gauss’s Lemma 5.5.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the notion of a unique factorization domain. We proved that in
a PID every irreducible element is prime, and consequently concluded that every PID is a
UFD.

give explicitly a proper ideal strictly larger than the principal ideal.
2. Let n > 2 be a square-free integer. Prove that Z[√−n] is not a PID.
3. In this exercise we generalize the notion of greatest common divisor to any PID. If R
is a PID, and a, b ∈R are non-zero non-units, then ⟨a, b⟩= ⟨d⟩, for some d ∈R. We
call d a greatest common divisor for a and b. You will now prove that d satisﬁes
the appropriate properties:
(a) d is a common divisor: Prove that d divides both a and b; that is, a = dx and
b = dy for some x, y ∈R.
(b) d is a greatest common divisor: Suppose that c is an element that divides both
a and b. Prove that c divides d.
(c) d is unique, up to trivial factors: If d and e are greatest common divisors of a, b,
according to this deﬁnition, then d and e are associates.
(d) d satisﬁes the GCD identity: There exist x, y ∈R for which d = ax + by.

Chapter 34
Polynomials with Integer Coeﬃcients
Our aim in this chapter is to prove that Z[x], the ring of polynomials with integer coeﬃcients,
is a UFD. It probably seems plausible that every polynomial with integer coeﬃcients can
be factored uniquely into irreducibles, but the proof of the analogous statement for Q[x]
will not work for Z[x].
34.1
The Proof That Q[x] Is a UFD
Let’s recall how we prove that Q[x] is a UFD, to see where the argument fails for Z[x]. We
proved this result for Q[x] originally in Theorems 5.1 and 5.4 and then provided another
proof in Theorem 33.2 which depends on the fact that Q[x] is a PID. In either proof we
showed two things: (1) non-units factor into irreducibles, and (2) such factorizations are
unique. We proved in Chapter 5 that non-units factor by using induction on degree, and in
Chapter 32 by using the fact that Q[x] is a PID. We then proved that such factorizations
are unique by showing that in Q[x] irreducible elements are prime. In the ﬁrst version of our
proof, this latter depended on the GCD identity; in the proof in Chapter 32, this depended
on the fact that in a PID an element a is irreducible if and only if ⟨a⟩is a maximal ideal.
Because the idea of degree still makes good sense, we will ﬁnd that proving the existence
of factorizations is not diﬃcult. However, there is no GCD identity for Z[x]. Consider 2 and
x in Z[x]. A gcd in Z[x] for these two elements is 1, but 1 cannot be written as a linear
combination of 2 and x. Furthermore, Z[x] is not a PID: We saw already in Example 9.12
that ⟨2, x⟩is not a principal ideal. Note that the lack of a GCD identity (for the elements
2 and x) and the fact that ⟨2, x⟩is not principal, amount to the same thing. So, we cannot
use either of the proofs for Q[x] to show that all irreducible elements are prime in Z[x].
34.2
Factoring Integers out of Polynomials
We shall now concentrate on showing that every non-zero non-unit in Z[x] can be factored
into irreducibles (recall that 1 and −1 are the only units in Z[x]). Let’s restrict our attention
ﬁrst to those factorizations that involve elements of Z. For example, the factorization
6x2 −12x + 24 = 2 · 3(x2 −2x + 4),
while considered trivial in Q[x], is of interest in Z[x] because 2 and 3 are not units in Z[x].
Consider now an irreducible p from Z. We can also consider p as an element of Z[x] (of
degree 0), and so we can ask whether p is an irreducible element of Z[x]. But if p = fg,
where f, g ∈Z[x], then f and g would both have to have degree 0 (because deg(fg) =
355

356
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
deg(f) + deg(g)). This means that p = fg can be considered a factorization in Z, and so
one of f and g must be a unit in Z (and hence in Z[x]). Thus, irreducible elements in Z are
also irreducible elements in Z[x]. For example, 2 (considered as a degree 0 polynomial) is
an irreducible element of Z[x].
Example 34.1
It is not always the case that an irreducible element in a smaller ring stays irreducible in
a larger one: 2 is irreducible in Z but is not irreducible in Z[i], because 2 = (1+i)(1−i).
(See Example 31.4.)
We know that an element Z is prime if and only if it is irreducible. On the other
hand, we have not (yet) shown that Z[x] is a UFD, and, consequently, we cannot yet infer
that irreducible elements in Z[x] are prime. We will show this eventually, but you should
exercise care until then to preserve the (potential) distinction between irreducible and prime
elements.
34.3
The Content of a Polynomial
So, a ﬁrst step toward factoring elements in Z[x] is to factor out any non-trivial constant
(that is, degree 0) elements. To describe this eﬃciently, we introduce the following termi-
nology:
Given a polynomial
f = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈Z[x],
consider a gcd in Z of the elements an, an−1, · · · a0. We shall call such a gcd the content of
f and denote it by cont f. Of course, the content is only well deﬁned up to plus or minus
(that is, unit multiples), but the notation cont f is convenient enough that we will live with
this harmless ambiguity.
Example 34.2
The content of the polynomial 6x2 −12x + 24 in Z[x] is 6 (or −6).
Recall from Example 15.5 that we called a polynomial in Z[x] primitive if its coeﬃ-
cients have no non-trivial common factor; that is, it is primitive if its content is 1. Our ﬁrst
important theorem asserts that the set of primitive polynomials is closed under multiplica-
tion.
Example 34.3
Both 2x + 3 and 3x2 + 4x + 1 are primitive polynomials; note that their product
6x3 + 17x2 + 24x + 18 is then primitive as well.
 Quick Exercise.
Choose two other primitive polynomials and check that their product
remains primitive. 
Theorem 34.1 Suppose that f and g are primitive polynomials in Z[x]. Then fg is prim-
itive.

Chapter 34: Polynomials with Integer Coeﬃcients
357
Proof:
This is just Gauss’s Lemma 5.5 in disguise. Suppose that f and g are primitive
polynomials, and let d = cont fg. Consider the polynomial h = (1/d)fg; this is an element
of Z[x]. Now h = ((1/d)f)(g) is a factorization in Q[x]; by Gauss’s Lemma, this leads to a
factorization in Z[x]. That is, there are rational numbers A, B so that h = (A(1/d)f)(Bg),
with A(1/d)f and Bg being elements of Z[x]; note that AB = 1. Because g is primitive and
Bg ∈Z[x], we must have that B is an integer, because if B were not an integer, then the
denominator of B would be cancelled by a non-trivial integer factor of all the coeﬃcients
of g; that is, cont g would not be 1. But because f is primitive, this means that A/d must
be an integer too. Because AB = 1, this means that A, B, and d must each be ±1. That
is, cont fg = ±1, and so fg is primitive.
2
An important consequence of this theorem is that the content function preserves multi-
plication:
Corollary 34.2 Given f, g ∈Z[x], we have that
cont fg = cont f · cont g.
Proof:
Given f, g ∈Z[x], we have that f = (cont f)f1 and g = (cont g)g1, where f1, g1
are primitive. But then
fg = (cont f · cont g)f1g1
and by Theorem 14.1, f1g1 is primitive. Hence, cont fg = cont f · cont g.

Check this corollary by multiplying together two polynomials from
Z[x] of your choice. 
To achieve our goal of proving that Z[x] is a UFD we must ﬁrst prove that every element
of Z[x] either is irreducible or can be factored into a product of irreducibles. As promised,
this is easy to prove, using induction on degree.
Theorem 34.3 Every non-zero non-unit of Z[x] is either irreducible or a product of irre-
ducibles.
Proof:
Suppose that 0 ̸= f ∈Z[x] is a non-unit. We proceed by induction on deg(f). If
deg(f) = 0, then f ∈Z. Because Z is a UFD, f is either irreducible in Z, or a product of
irreducibles in Z; but irreducibles in Z are irreducible in Z[x], and so we have the required
result.
Now suppose that deg(f) = n > 0. If f itself is irreducible, we are done. Otherwise,
we ﬁrst factor out of f the element cont f; this is an element of Z that we can factor into
irreducibles of Z (and hence of Z[x]). So we may suppose that f is primitive. If f isn’t
irreducible, we can then factor it as f = gh. Because f is primitive, we must have that
deg(g) > 0 and deg(h) > 0. So by the induction hypothesis, g and h are irreducible or the
product of irreducibles, and therefore so is f. By the Principle of Mathematical Induction,
this proves the theorem.

Irreducibles in Z[x] Are Prime
So, what remains to be done to prove that Z[x] is a UFD? Theorem 32.4 asserts that a
domain in which factorization into irreducibles is possible has unique factorization if and

Exercises
only if all irreducible elements are prime (remember, of course, that prime elements are
always irreducible). We thus must show that all irreducible elements of Z[x] are actually
prime. We will do this by relating factorizations of polynomials in Z[x] to factorizations in
Q[x], using Gauss’s Lemma 5.5.
Theorem 34.4 In Z[x], all irreducible elements are prime; consequently Z[x] is a UFD.
Proof:
Suppose that f is an irreducible polynomial in Z[x]. Note ﬁrst that because f has
no non-trivial factors from Z, this means that f is primitive. By Gauss’s Lemma, f must
be irreducible in Q[x] as well. Because Q[x] is a PID, f is then a prime element of Q[x]; we
must show that f is a prime element of Z[x].
To show this, suppose that f divides gh, where g, h ∈Z[x]. Now consider g and h as
elements of Q[x]. Because f is prime in Q[x], this means that f must divide one of them
(say, g) in Q[x]. That is, g = fg1, where g1 ∈Q[x]. But by Gauss’s Lemma 5.5 there exist
rational numbers A and B, so that AB = 1 and Af, Bg1 ∈Z[x]. But because f is primitive
and Af ∈Z[x], A must be an integer; otherwise, the denominator of A would be cancelled
by a non-trivial factor of cont f. Thus, g = f(ABg1) is a factorization in Z[x], and so f
divides g in Z[x]. Hence, f is prime in Z[x], as required. It then follows immediately that
Z[x] is a UFD.
2
This means that Z[x] is an example of a UFD that is not a PID, thus showing that the
converse of Theorem 33.2 is false.
The method of this chapter can actually be generalized to prove that any time D is a
PID, then D[x] is a UFD that is not a PID. The general proof, while quite similar, requires
a bit more machinery than we presently have available to us, and so we will not pursue it
here.

Chapter 35
Euclidean Domains
The diﬃculty we encountered in the last chapter in proving that Z[x] is a UFD might con-
vince you of the advantage of having a Division Theorem available: The Division Theorem
makes proving that Z and Q[x] are UFDs relatively easy. It seems natural then to deﬁne a
more general class of domains (including both Z and Q[x]) that have a Division Theorem.
We name this class of domains in honor of Euclid, in whose Elements we ﬁnd the ﬁrst refer-
ence to that corollary of the Division Theorem, Euclid’s Algorithm. This is a typical gambit
of mathematicians. We have identiﬁed an important tool we’d like to study in general (in
this case, a Division Theorem for domains), and so we isolate those domains having this
tool by means of a deﬁnition.
35.1
Euclidean Domains
A Euclidean domain is a domain D that can be equipped with a function v : D\{0} →N
that satisﬁes the following two criteria:
a. For a, b ∈D with a ̸= 0, there exist q, r ∈D (called the quotient and remainder,
respectively) such that b = aq + r, with r = 0 or v(r) < v(a).
b. For all a, b ̸= 0, v(a)v(b) = v(ab).
The function v is called a Euclidean valuation for D.
You should think of the function v as a measure of ‘size’ of the elements. Thus, the ﬁrst
condition says that we can always divide an element of D by a non-zero element; either the
division is exact, or we have a remainder ‘smaller’ than the divisor. To be consistent with our
earlier terminology, we will call this the Division Theorem for Euclidean domains (even
though we have built it right into the deﬁnition). The second condition allows us to relate
divisibility in D to divisibility in Z (which we presumably know more about). Note that
because the function v takes on its values in N, we have available to us all we know about
this set, including such tools as the Well-ordering Principle and Mathematical Induction.
Before making any abstract inferences about Euclidean domains, we shall ﬁrst list a
number of examples, showing that this concept is in fact a common generalization of a
number of the domains we have already considered.
Example 35.1
Z is a Euclidean domain. Here, the valuation (or ‘size’ function) is obvious; just let
v(n) = |n|. The ﬁrst condition is then the Division Theorem of Z (Theorem 2.1), and
the second condition holds because |nm| = |n||m|.
361

362
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 35.2
Q[x] is a Euclidean domain. How did we measure ‘size’ of elements for polynomials?
We just used their degree; thus, v(f) = deg(f) seems a natural deﬁnition; condition
(1) is now just the Division Theorem for Q[x] (Theorem 4.2). However, the second
condition fails, because after all, deg(fg) = deg(f)+deg(g) (rather than deg(f)deg(g)).
We can escape this problem by means of a trick: Just let v(f) = 2deg(f). Because
exponentiation turns addition into multiplication, condition (2) is now satisﬁed. But
what about condition (1)? This still works because deg(f) < deg(g) exactly when
v(f) < v(g).
Example 35.3
Any ﬁeld is a Euclidean domain. In a ﬁeld we can divide any element by any non-zero
element, with no remainder. Thus, all non-zero elements should be ‘small’. A function
that works easily is just v(a) = 1, for all a ̸= 0. This seems almost too easy, but, after
all, we are only really interested in a Division Theorem where we have at least some
elements that do not divide one another exactly.
35.2
The Gaussian Integers
We will now show that the ring of Gaussian integers Z[i] is a Euclidean domain. In Chapter
31 we had already measured the ‘size’ of Gaussian integers, by means of the norm function
N(a + bi) = a2 + b2. We wish to show that the norm function serves as a Euclidean
valuation. Note that the second condition holds because N(αβ) = N(α)N(β) (Theorem
31.1). Unfortunately, the Division Theorem is not really obvious. What should the quotient
and remainder be if we divide one Gaussian integer by another?
Example 35.4
Let’s look at a particular example: Consider 11 + 6i divided by 2 + 3i. Now we can
certainly perform this division in the ﬁeld C. We obtain the following:
11 + 6i
2 + 3i = (11 + 6i)(2 −3i)
(2 + 3i)(2 −3i) = 40 −21i
13
= 40
13 −21
13i.
What is the Gaussian integer closest to this quotient? Because 40
13 = 3 1
13 and 21
13 = 1 8
13,
the answer to this question seems to be 3 −2i. If this is to be our quotient q, then the
remainder r must be given by
(11 + 6i) −(2 + 3i)(3 −2i) = −1 + i.
Note that v(−1 + i) = 2 < 13 = v(2 + 3i).
This example makes plausible the assertion that the norm function is in fact a Euclidean
valuation for the Gaussian integers. Let us now prove this carefully:
Theorem 35.1 Z[i] is a Euclidean domain.

Chapter 35: Euclidean Domains
363
Proof:
As observed above, we clearly need check only that the Division Theorem (that is,
condition (1) above) really works. So suppose that β = m + ni and α = r + si are Gaussian
integers, and we wish to verify the Division Theorem for them, where α ̸= 0 will serve as
the divisor. Using the example above as our model, consider the following computation in
C:
β
α = m + ni
r + si = mr + ns
r2 + s2 + nr −ms
r2 + s2 i.
The real and imaginary parts of this complex number certainly need not be integers, but we
shall now choose integers q1 and q2 as close as possible to them. Any real number is within
1
2 of an integer, and so this amounts to saying that

mr + ns
r2 + s2 −q1
 ≤1
2
and

nr −ms
r2 + s2 −q2
 ≤1
2.
We will use γ = q1 + q2i as the proposed quotient in the Division Theorem. The remainder
ρ will then necessarily be given by
ρ = β −αγ = (m −rq1 + sq2) + (n −rq2 −sq1)i.
It remains to check that the valuation of ρ is less than the valuation of α (or else ρ = 0). To
verify this we use the fact that the function N preserves multiplication even in C (Theorem
8.3). We can thus do the following computation:
v(ρ)
=
N(ρ) = N(β −αγ) = N

α ·

This shows that the remainder ρ is indeed suitably ‘small’.
2
You will use similar means to prove that Z[
√
2] is a Euclidean domain in Exercise 1. Not
all such domains are; it is a deep and not completely solved problem of number theory to
distinguish which are Euclidean domains, and which aren’t.
The proof of Theorem 35.1 can be interpreted geometrically. The crucial step is the
choice of the quotient γ; we do this by ﬁnding a point in the complex plane with integer
coordinates, whose distance to β/α (the quotient in C) is less than 1. If the complex number
β/α happened to fall between points with consecutive integer coordinates, as illustrated in
the diagram below, we would actually have two possible choices for the quotient:
•
•
•
•
•
β
α
here, γ can be either
of these points

364
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Thus, the quotient and remainder need not be unique in a Euclidean domain; the careful
reader might have noted earlier the absence of the word ‘unique’ in the original deﬁnition.
We will illustrate this point algebraically, in the following example, where we actually have
four choices for the quotient available:
Example 35.5
Let’s divide 3 + 5i by 2. Because the quotient in C is 3/2 + (5/2)i, which element of
Z[i] should we choose as the quotient? In this case, each of the four nearby points with
integer coordinates are at distance less than 1 from 3/2 + (5/2)i, and so we have four
diﬀerent quotient/remainder pairs:
3 + 5i
=
(1 + 2i)(2) + (1 + i)
=
(1 + 3i)(2) + (1 −i)
=
(2 + 2i)(2) + (−1 + i)
=
(2 + 3i)(2) + (−1 −i).
35.3
Euclidean Domains Are PIDs
We are now ready to make some abstract observations about Euclidean domains. We ﬁrst
prove that the units of a Euclidean domain are identiﬁable by means of its valuation:
Theorem 35.2 Let D be a Euclidean domain with valuation v. Then u is a unit of D if
and only if v(u) = 1.
Proof:
Notice ﬁrst that because 12 = 1, v(1)2 = v(1); the only positive integer with this
property is 1, and so v(1) = 1. But then if u is a unit, v(u)v(u−1) = v(uu−1) = v(1) = 1,
and so v(u) = 1. Conversely, if v(u) = 1, apply the Division Theorem to 1 and u to obtain
1 = qu + r. But v(r) < v(u) = 1, which is impossible, and so r = 0. That is, u is a unit
with inverse q.
2
We next show that all Euclidean domains are PIDs, using very much the same sort of
proof as we used for Z and Q[x].
Theorem 35.3 Each Euclidean domain is a PID.
Proof:
Suppose that I is a proper ideal of the Euclidean domain D. What element of
I might serve as its generator? We answer this question (as we did for Z) by using the
Well-ordering Principle. Choose an element d of I with smallest valuation; there may be
many choices for d. Note that this valuation is necessarily larger than 1 because I contains
no units. We claim that ⟨d⟩= I. Because I is an ideal, it is clear that ⟨d⟩⊆I. Suppose now
that b ∈I. We claim b is a multiple of d. To check this, we should clearly use the Division
Theorem to obtain a quotient q and remainder r: b = qd+r. Because r = b−qd, this means
that r ∈I. But v(r) < v(d), which is impossible unless r = 0. Thus, b = qd ∈⟨d⟩.
2
Because every PID is a UFD, we have:
Corollary 35.4 Each Euclidean domain is a UFD.

Chapter 35: Euclidean Domains
365
Example 35.6
We thus know that the ring Z[i] of Gaussian integers is a PID. The crucial idea in the
proof above is that a generator for an ideal is an element with smallest valuation. As
an example of this procedure in Z[i], consider the set
I = {a + bi ∈Z[i] : 5|(2a −b)}.
We claim that I is an ideal. It is quite easy to show that I is closed under subtraction.
 Quick Exercise.
Check this. 
Suppose now that a + bi ∈I and c + di ∈Z[i]. Then
(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac −bd) + i(bc + ad)
and so we require that 2ac −2bd −bc −ad is an integer divisible by 5. But
2ac −2bd −bc −ad
=
c(2a −b) −d(2b + a)
=
c(2a −b) −d(5a −2(2a −b)),
and this is divisible by 5 because 2a −b is.
The theorem asserts that I is a principal ideal, and the proof tells that we can ﬁnd
a generator by picking an element of I with smallest valuation. To ﬁnd out what this
is, suppose that a + bi ∈I; then 2a −b = 5k, for k ∈Z. So
v(a + bi) = a2 + b2 = a2 + (2a −5k)2 = 5
 a2 −4ak + 5k2
,
and so this smallest valuation is divisible by 5. But note that 2−i has valuation 5 and
2 −i ∈I; consequently, we must have that ⟨2 −i⟩= I. Let’s do some arithmetic in
C, to see explicitly that every element of I is a multiple of 2 −i. For that purpose, let
a + bi ∈I; then
a + bi
2 −i = (a + bi)(2 + i)
(2 −i)(2 + i)
=
1
5((2a −b) + (a + 2b)i)
=
1
5((2a −b) + (3(2a −b) −5(a −b))i)
and this latter element is in Z[i], because the real and imaginary parts of the numerator
are divisible by 5. Thus, any element of I is a multiple of 2 −i, as claimed. Note that
in practice it might be quite diﬃcult to ﬁnd the generator for an ideal by this method.
35.4
Some PIDs Are Not Euclidean
A natural question to ask at this point is: Are there PIDs that are not Euclidean? The
answer is yes, but it is diﬃcult to prove this. It is usually quite easy to show that a domain
is not a PID: Just exhibit a particular ideal and prove it is not principal. However, to show
that a domain D is not Euclidean, one must prove that all functions v : D\{0} →N fail
to satisfy at least one of the two deﬁning conditions. The diﬀerence between these two
tasks is that the deﬁnition of PID is a universal statement—all ideals are principal—while
the deﬁnition of a Euclidean domain is an existential statement—there exists a function
satisfying particular properties. And the negation of a universal statement is existential,
while the negation of an existential statement is universal.

Section VII in a Nutshell
This section examines conditions that Z and Q[x] share, which provide them with a unique
factorization theorem into irreducibles, like the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
For Z and Q[x], all ideals are principal. An integral domain where this holds is called a
principal ideal domain (or PID). For a PID, we have factorization into irreducibles (Theo-
rem 32.2). To prove uniqueness of such factorization requires precisely that the concepts of
irreducibility and primeness coincide (Theorems 32.4), as they do for the integers. An inte-
gral domain that has unique factorization into irreducibles is called a unique factorization
domain (or UFD).
Integral domains of the form Z[√n] = {a+b√n : a, b ∈Z} are called quadratic extensions
of the integers. These are important examples; some such rings are PIDs, but not all. The
ring Z[√−5] is not a PID and is not even a UFD.
The ring Z[x] of polynomials with integer coeﬃcients is not a PID, but it is a UFD; this
follows essentially from Gauss’s Lemma (Theorem 34.4).
Some quadratic extensions (such as the Gaussian integers Z[i]) share even more prop-
erties in common with Z and Q[x] and are called Euclidean domains: Elements in such
domains have a notion of ‘size’, which equips them with a Division Theorem. This makes
it easy to prove (Theorem 35.3) that they are PIDs, and hence UFDs.

Constructibility Problems

Chapter 36
Constructions with Compass and
Straightedge
You probably recall doing various constructions with a compass and a straightedge in high
school geometry. We will imagine idealized tools. Thus, the straightedge is an unmarked
ruler, which in principle can be as long as necessary. With it we can draw line segments
of arbitrary length, perhaps passing through a particular point or connecting two given
points. Likewise, the compass is as large as necessary; with it we can draw arcs and circles
and duplicate distances. For instance, if A and B are marked on one line and point C
is marked on another, the compass allows us to mark a point D on the second line so
that the distance between C and D is the same as the distance between A and B. Of
course, in actually carrying out these constructions with real rulers and compasses, there
is always error involved. However, we are concerned with idealized constructions—perfect
constructions with no error.
36.1
Construction Problems
From around the ﬁfth century B.C. Greek mathematicians wondered what constructions
could be carried out using only a compass and a straightedge. In the axioms that begin
Euclid’s Elements we discover the postulation of an idealized compass and straightedge. The
theorems about plane geometry that follow show how successful the Greeks were at doing
plane geometry with compass and straightedge. You should recall some of the constructions
possible:
• ﬁnd the midpoint of a line segment;
• construct a line perpendicular to a given line through a given point on the line;
• construct a line perpendicular to a given line through a point oﬀthe line;
• construct a line parallel to a given line through a point oﬀthe given line;
• given an angle, bisect it.
 Quick Exercise.
How are these constructions done? Better yet, get out your compass
and straightedge and do them. 
There were, however, three famous constructions that ancient Greek mathematicians
could not accomplish with compass and straightedge:
• Doubling the cube: Given a line segment, which represents the edge of a cube,
construct another line segment representing the edge of another cube, whose volume
is twice that of the original cube.
371

372
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
• Trisecting an angle: Given an arbitrary angle, divide it into three equal parts.
• Squaring the circle: Construct a square that has the same area as a given circle.
The question of whether such constructions are possible bedeviled mathematicians for over
2000 years.
It is important to note that in each case we desire a general method that works for
all instances of the given problem. For example, the angle trisection problem is to ﬁnd a
method of trisection that works for all angles. Certain angles can be easily trisected, but
this does not mean that the general problem has been solved. For example, a 90◦angle can
be trisected, because this is equivalent to constructing a 30◦angle, which is easy to do. In
fact, there are a number of ways to do this. For instance, you could construct an equilateral
triangle and then bisect one of the angles. Or, you could directly construct a right triangle
with angles of 60◦and 30◦.
 Quick Exercise.
Construct an equilateral triangle. Also, directly construct a 30◦–60◦–
90◦triangle, by starting with a shorter leg of length 1.

In the 19th century all three of the famous constructions above were shown to be impos-
sible; the proofs were largely algebraic, rather than geometric. Think for a moment about
what a proof of impossibility means. It is not at all clear how it is possible to show that a
construction is impossible—we certainly can’t try all possibilities! Proving the impossibility
of these three classical construction problems was one of the great triumphs of mathematics
in general and algebra in particular.
36.2
Constructible Lengths and Numbers
We start the attack on these problems by ﬁrst deciding which lengths can be constructed.
Speciﬁcally, we want to answer the following question: Given a line segment in the plane,
which we say is of length 1, for what values α can we construct a line segment of length α?
Note that if we talk about lengths, we must start with some unit of measure; hence,
we designate some particular line segment as the unit line segment. Our goal is to give a
complete algebraic description of which numbers we can construct, when starting with a
unit line segment. Our modest beginning is the observation that all the natural numbers
can be constructed:
Lemma 36.1 Given a line segment of length 1 and a natural number n, it is possible to
construct a line segment of length n.
Proof:
Merely use the compass to lay oﬀn copies of the unit line segment, next to one
another on a line (which can be made as long as necessary, using the straightedge).
2
Hence, we say that the natural numbers are constructible. In general, we say that the real
number α is constructible if, given a line segment of length 1, it is possible to construct a
line segment of length |α|. Thus, the integers are constructible because the natural numbers
are.
Theorem 36.2 Given line segments of length 1, a, and b, it is possible to construct seg-
ments of lengths a + b, a −b (if a ≥b), ab, and a/b.

Chapter 36: Constructions with Compass and Straightedge
373
Proof:
The constructibility of a + b and a −b are obvious. To construct ab, consider the
ﬁgure below. Start by constructing two rays with vertex V . On one ray mark A so that the
length of the line segment from V to A is a. (We will write |V A| for the length of the line
segment from V to A.) Then on the other ray mark points P and B so that |V P| = 1 and
|V B| = b. Now draw the line segment from P to A. Finally, construct a line parallel to this
line segment and through the point B, as shown in the ﬁgure. Label the point where this
line intersects the other ray as Q.

Now, △VAP is similar to △V QB; thus,

=
|V Q|

,
and so
ab
=
|V Q|.
A similar construction can be made for a/b. This is left as Exercise 1.
2
The previous theorem asserts that the sum, diﬀerence, product, and quotient of two
constructible numbers is constructible. This makes the next corollary obvious:
Corollary 36.3 Given a line segment of length 1, the set of all constructible numbers is a
ﬁeld.
We will therefore refer to this set as the ﬁeld of constructible numbers and denote
it by K (the German word for ‘construct’ is ‘konstruieren’, and for ‘ﬁeld’ is ‘K¨orper’). Our
lemma tells us that Z is a subring of K. But K is closed under division, and so K contains all
quotients of integers; that is, the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers is a subﬁeld of K. Furthermore,
by deﬁnition all constructible numbers must be real numbers. That is, K is a subﬁeld of R.
Are there constructible numbers other than the rationals? To answer this, construct
a square with side one. Then draw the diagonal; this means that
√
2 is a constructible
number! And we’ve seen before (Exercise 2.14) that
√
2 is an irrational number, and so not
all constructible numbers are rational. We shall see, however, that not all real numbers are
constructible. Indeed, the highlight of the next chapter is to exactly describe the ﬁeld of
constructible numbers. There, we shall see that constructing the square root is of utmost
importance.
Accordingly, we generalize the fact that
√
2 is constructible, in the next theorem:
Theorem 36.4 If α is constructible, then so is
p
|α|.
Proof:
We assume that α is positive. Here is one way of constructing √α. Refer to the
ﬁgure below. First mark points P, O, and Q on a line so that |PO| = α and |OQ| = 1.
Now ﬁnd the midpoint of the line segment from P to Q and using that as the center, draw
a semicircle of radius (α + 1)/2, as shown. Draw a perpendicular to the line through the
point O. Label the point where this perpendicular intersects the semicircle as X.

By repeatedly applying the last theorem, we can construct

structible number and k is a power of two. So, for instance,
√
5,
4√
5, and
8√
5 are all con-
structible. Thus, there are inﬁnitely many constructible numbers in addition to the rationals.
Our goal in the next chapter is to characterize algebraically all elements of the ﬁeld K.
Although the constructions we have discussed in this chapter would have been familiar
and understandable to an ancient Greek geometer, our emphasis on constructing numbers,
rather than line segments, would have seemed strange. But we must change our point of
view to bring to bear our modern algebraic tools.
Chapter Summary
We introduced the three famous construction problems of the ancient Greeks: Is it possible,
using only a compass and a straightedge, to
• double the cube,
• trisect an angle, or
• square the circle?
We deﬁned a constructible number and showed that the rationals are constructible. Indeed,
we showed that the set K of constructible numbers is a ﬁeld. We also showed that
p
|α| is
constructible if α is.

collapsible compass.

Chapter 37
Constructibility and Quadratic Field
Extensions
In the previous chapter we saw that constructible numbers can be obtained from the unit
segment by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (the ﬁeld operations), and by
taking square roots of positive numbers. We may, of course, perform any number of these
operations in any order we please. Note that being closed under taking square roots of
positive elements is a property that K does not share with all ﬁelds. For example, 2 ∈Q
(the smallest ﬁeld of constructible numbers, as we have seen) but
√
2 /∈Q.
37.1
Quadratic Field Extensions
Let’s build a bigger ﬁeld than Q that does contain
√
2. Consider the set
Q(
√
2) = {a + b
√
2 : a, b ∈Q}.
It is straightforward to show that Q(
√
2) satisﬁes all the ﬁeld axioms.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that Q(
√
2) is a subring of R, and then verify that it is in fact
a ﬁeld. 
In fact, Q(
√
2) is the smallest ﬁeld containing both Q and
√
2; that is, Q(
√
2) is contained
in every subﬁeld of C containing both Q and
√
2. For if
√
2 is an element of a ﬁeld F ⊆C
because Q necessarily is contained in F, then so is a+b
√
2 for all a in Q. Hence, Q(
√
2) ⊆F.
Because F was arbitrary, Q(
√
2) is contained in all subﬁelds of C containing both
√
2 and
Q.
We say that Q(
√
2) is a ﬁeld extension of Q, because Q is a subﬁeld of Q(
√
2); since
Q(
√
2) is a strictly larger ﬁeld, we call this a proper ﬁeld extension. More speciﬁcally,
Q(
√
2) is a quadratic ﬁeld extension of Q. In general, a ﬁeld H ⊆C is a quadratic ﬁeld
extension of a ﬁeld F if
H = {a + b
√
k : a, b, ∈F}
for some k ∈F such that
√
k /∈F. (If
√
k ∈F, then H = F, and so H would not be a
proper extension.) We will return to this deﬁnition of quadratic ﬁeld extension in Section
42.2, when we will put it in a more general context. Note also that when talking about ﬁeld
extensions, we will often omit the word ‘ﬁeld’ if the context is clear.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that if F ⊆C is a ﬁeld and k ∈F, then
H = {a + b
√
k : a, b ∈F}
is a ﬁeld. If
√
k /∈F, then H properly contains F. That is, H is a quadratic ﬁeld extension
of F. (This is simply a generalization of Q(
√
2) being a quadratic ﬁeld extension of Q.) 

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 37.1
Consider the ﬁeld Q(i); it is a quadratic extension of Q because i = √−1. This is the
ﬁeld of all complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are rational. Of course,
Q(i) does not consist entirely of constructible numbers, because K ⊆R.
Example 37.2
Let’s build a quadratic extension of the ﬁeld Q(
√
2). To do so, we need an element
belonging to this ﬁeld whose square root does not. Does
√
3 ∈Q(
√
2)? If so, then for
some a and b in Q,
√
3 = a + b
√
2,
and thus
3 = (a + b
√
2)2 = (a2 + 2b2) + (2ab)
√
2.
But then 2ab = 0, and so at least one of a and b must be zero. Hence, there is no
solution to the equation 3 = a2 + 2b2. Thus, we can consider the quadratic extension
ﬁeld Q(
√
2)(
√
3), which we usually write as Q(
√
2,
√
3).
But what are the elements of this ﬁeld? A typical element should look like
(a + b
√
2) + (c + d
√
2)
√
3 = a + b
√
2 + c
√
3 + d

6.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that the quadratic extension Q(
√
3)(
√
2) consists of the
same elements as Q(
√
2)(
√
3). Thus, the notation Q(
√
2,
√
3) is not ambiguous about
the order in which the elements
√
2 and
√
3 are adjoined to Q. 
In this second example (unlike the ﬁrst) we obtain a ﬁeld of constructible numbers. This
is more generally true: If F is a ﬁeld of constructible numbers — that is, F is a subﬁeld of
K — and k is an element of F, then F(
p
|k|) is also a ﬁeld of constructible numbers. We
state this in the following lemma.
Lemma 37.1 Suppose that F is a ﬁeld of constructible numbers and k ∈F with k > 0.
Then F(
√
k) ⊆K.
Proof:
If
√
k ∈F, then F(
√
k) = F, and we are done. So assume that
√
k /∈F. By
Theorem 36.4,
√
k is constructible. If α ∈F(
√
k), then α = a + b
√
k for some a and b in F,
and so α is also constructible, because K is a ﬁeld.

37.2
Sequences of Quadratic Field Extensions
We can thus start with the rational numbers and repeatedly take quadratic extensions by
square roots of positive elements, in the process building larger and larger ﬁelds, always
contained within the ﬁeld of constructible numbers. We formally state this in the following
theorem.
Theorem 37.2 Suppose that
Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂Fn
is a sequence of ﬁelds such that Fi+1 = Fi(
√
ki) for some ki ∈Fi, with ki > 0 for i =
0, 1, . . . , n −1. Then Fn ⊆K.

Proof:
Use induction and the previous lemma.

Are there any constructible numbers that cannot be obtained by this process of repeat-
edly extending our ﬁeld by taking square roots of positive elements? The surprising answer
is ‘No’! Proving this is our next task.
Before we do, let’s consider an example of a constructible number, say,
r
6 + 4
3
q
2 + 2
√
7.
This number could be constructed by successively constructing the following sequence
of numbers:
X1

X11

The ﬁelds corresponding to the above sequence of numbers would be F1 = Q, F2 =
F1(
√
7), F5 = F4 = F3 = F2, F6 = F5
p

F11 = F10
 r
6 + 4
3
q
2 + 2
√
7
!
.
So, compressing this sequence, we see that the sequence of quadratic ﬁeld extensions
given in the above theorem would be
Q ⊂F1 ⊂F2 ⊂F3,
where
F1 = Q(
√
7), F2 = F1(
p
2 + 2
√
7),
and
F3 = F2(
r
6 + 4
3
q
2 + 2
√
7).
(We’ve abbreviated the original sequence of points somewhat. For instance, to construct
7 we might have constructed 2 (= 1 + 1), 3 (= 2 + 1), 4 (= 2 + 2), and ﬁnally 7 (= 3 + 4).
Likewise, 6 and 4
3 would take some intermediate steps. All those ‘missing’ numbers are in
Q, however.)
Note that there may be diﬀerent paths to reach a given number and hence a diﬀerent
sequence of ﬁelds reﬂecting the order in which the numbers are constructed. (For examples
illustrating this, look at Exercises 36.4 and 36.5.) The important point is that each ﬁeld
extension is a quadratic extension and only a ﬁnite sequence of extensions is needed.

37.3
The Rational Plane
We now return to using the compass and straightedge. This discussion will clarify what is
actually meant by constructing with these tools. In constructing numbers with a compass
and a straightedge, we start with a given unit segment somewhere in the plane and start
constructing lengths. We can impose a Cartesian coordinate system on the plane so that the
left-hand endpoint of the given unit segment is at the origin, and the right-hand endpoint
is on the x-axis at location (1, 0). All rational numbers on the x-axis can be located by ap-
plying only the constructions necessary to carry out ﬁeld operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division). Note that a rational number being constructible means that a line
segment of the appropriate length can be constructed somewhere in the plane. But we can
easily transfer this length to the x-axis so that one end of the line segment is at the origin.
Thus, on the x-axis we can locate ±q for any q ∈Q. We can easily transfer these points to
the y-axis with the compass, and so we can locate any point (p, q) in the plane where p and
q are in Q.
 Quick Exercise.
How do you locate (p, q) in the plane once p has been located on the
x-axis and q has been located on the y-axis? 
We have thus located all points in the plane that we can construct by means of only the
ﬁeld operations: We call this the rational plane, or the plane of Q.
37.4
Planes of Constructible Numbers
Suppose now that somewhere in the plane we construct the length
√
k, where k is some
positive rational number, and
√
k /∈Q. By applying only the ﬁeld operations to
√
k and
elements from Q, we can locate points on the x and y axes that are in the quadratic extension
Q(
√
k). Thus, we can locate all points in the plane with coordinates (p, q), where p and q
are in Q(
√
k); we call this set of points the plane of Q(
√
k).
More generally, suppose that F is any subﬁeld of K — that is, a ﬁeld of constructible
numbers. Then the plane of F consists of the set of points (p, q) for which p and q are in
F.
We now wish to consider what further points can be reached using compass and straight-
edge alone, when working in the plane of F, where F is some ﬁeld of constructible numbers.
Let’s consider the compass ﬁrst. To use the compass we need to know two points at which
to place our compass: one for the center, and one for some point on the circumference. In
the case we’re describing, these two points must belong to the plane of F. We will call such
a circle a circle in the plane of F. Likewise, with a straightedge we can draw a line that
passes through two points in the plane of F. We will call such a line a line in the plane
of F. Other constructions are a combination of these two simple constructions.
At this point you might object and say that a constructed circle could have center at
any point in the entire plane with any radius — simply close your eyes and put the compass
down. Or, a line drawn with the straightedge need not pass through two points in the plane
of F — again, lay the straightedge down arbitrarily. But steps like these are not permitted
by the axioms of Greek geometry. Instead, we require step-by-step procedures that can
be replicated. For example, a successful solution to the angle trisection problem should be
an unambiguous list of constructions that when carried out by anyone leads to the same

Chapter 37: Constructibility and Quadratic Field Extensions
381
solution. This means that when we draw lines or circles with the straightedge or compass,
we must have unambiguous information: A circle is determined by its center and a point on
its circumference, a line by two points.
Let’s be explicit algebraically about what equations for lines and circles in the plane of
a ﬁeld F look like.
The equation for a line in the plane of F is of the form
ax + by + c = 0
where a, b, and c are in F, and a and b are not both zero. For if the line passes through the
points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), then any point (x, y) on this line must satisfy
y −y1
x −x1
= y2 −y1
x2 −x1
,
provided x1 ̸= x2. If (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are both in the plane of F, then putting the above
equation into the form ax+by +c = 0 will give us a, b, and c in the ﬁeld F. The case where
x1 = x2 is an easily handled special case.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that we can obtain an equation of the form ax+by+c = 0 with
a, b, c ∈F for the line through two points in the plane of F with equal x-coordinates. 
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the equation of the line passing through (2 +

5)
and (4 + 3
√
5, 2 + 7
√
5), and check that the coeﬃcients a, b, and c do belong to Q(
√
5). 
The equation for a circle in the plane of F is of the form
x2 + y2 + dx + ey + f = 0,
where d, e, and f are in F. For if the circle has center at (x1, y1) and a point on the
circumference is (x2, y2), then the radius is
p
(x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2
and so if (x, y) is any point on the circle, it must satisfy
(x −x1)2 + (y −y1)2 = (x2 −x1)2 + (y2 −y1)2.
This can be put into the desired form where d, e, and f are in the ﬁeld F if (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2) are in the plane of F.
 Quick Exercise.
Put this equation into the form
x2 + y2 + dx + ey + f = 0
and note that d, e, and f are elements of F. 
 Quick Exercise.
Determine the equation of the circle with center (2 +

(4 + 3
√
5, 2 + 7
√
5) on the circumference, and check that the coeﬃcients d, e, and f are in
Q(
√
5). 
So, given the circle and line constructions we can make in the plane of F, what new
points can we locate? New points can be located in one of three ways:

382
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
1. The intersection of two lines in the plane of F.
2. The intersection of a circle in the plane of F with a line in the plane of F.
3. The intersection of two circles in the plane of F.
We can easily locate points found by method (1) by solving the system of two linear
equations. Notice that the solution, if the lines are not parallel, is a point (p1, p2) with p1
and p2 in the ﬁeld F, because our method of solving two equations in two unknowns involves
only ﬁeld operations. In other words, method (1) can locate no points outside of the plane
of F.
 Quick Exercise.
Find the simultaneous solution to the equations a1x + b1y + c1 = 0
and a2x+b2y+c2 = 0. Under what conditions will these two equations have no simultaneous
solution and thus represent parallel lines? 
Method (2) involves the simultaneous solution of an equation for a circle and an equation
for a line. Method (3) involves the simultaneous solution of two equations for circles. Notice
that method (3) reduces to method (2), for if
x2 + y2 + d1x + e1y + f1 = 0
is subtracted from
x2 + y2 + d2x + e2y + f2 = 0,
we get
(d2 −d1)x + (e2 −e1)y + (f2 −f1) = 0,
and so the simultaneous solution of this linear equation (which gives the equation for the

Chapter 37: Constructibility and Quadratic Field Extensions
383
common chord; see Exercise 8) with either of the two circle equations is the desired solution.
Thus, what remains is to ﬁnd which points can be obtained from method (2).
So, suppose we wish to solve simultaneously
x2 + y2 + dx + ey + f
=
0, and
ax + by + c
=
0,
where all the coeﬃcients belong to the ﬁeld F. Because a and b can’t both be zero we will
assume that b ̸= 0 (the case where a ̸= 0 is similar). We solve for y in terms of x:
y = −a
b x −c
b.
Substituting this into the circle equation yields:
x2 +

−a
b x −c
b

+ f = 0
which is a quadratic equation in x. We could use the quadratic formula to solve it; we will
not carry out the calculations explicitly.
 Quick Exercise.
Apply the quadratic formula to this quadratic equation, and obtain
the solutions in terms of the coeﬃcients. 
The solution you just obtained has the form A ± B
√
k, with A, B, k ∈F. If k < 0, then
there are no real solutions, and this means geometrically that there is no intersection. If
k = 0, then there is a unique solution; this means geometrically that the line is tangent to
the circle. Finally, if k > 0, we have two distinct intersections.
In case we have solutions, we can determine y by substitution: This yields an expression
of the form A′ ± B′√
k, with A′, B′ ∈F.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that if there are solutions for x of the form A ± B
√
k, with
A, B, k ∈F, then y has the form A′ ± B′√
k, with A′, B′ ∈F. 
So, notice that both x and y are in the ﬁeld F(
√
k); if
√
k ∈F, then of course F(
√
k) = F,
and so x and y are in F. That is, the point (x, y) is in the plane of F(
√
k).

The Constructible Number Theorem
We are now ready to prove the main result of this chapter.
Theorem 37.3
Constructible Number Theorem
The following two statements
are equivalent:
a. The number α is constructible.
b. There exists a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds
Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂FN
with α ∈FN and Fi+1 = Fi(√ki) for some ki ∈Fi, with ki > 0 for i = 0, . . . , N −1.

384
Exercises
Proof:
That (b) implies (a) is the previous theorem.
To show that (a) implies (b), suppose α is constructible. Then we can construct the point
(α, 0), which we will label P, starting only with the segment of length 1 along the positive
x-axis. To construct P, we must construct a ﬁnite sequence of points, P0, P1, . . . , PM = P.
Because the points (0, 0) and (1, 0) are the ﬁrst two points constructed, we set P0 = (0, 0)
and P1 = (1, 0). Of course, P0 and P1 are both elements of the plane of Q. Now P2 is
constructed using only P0, P1 and one of the three constructions for locating new points in
the plane. Hence, by the above discussion, P2 ∈Q(
√
k) for some positive k ∈Q. (This ﬁeld
may be equal to Q if
√
k ∈Q.) Then F0 = F1 = Q and F2 = Q(
√
k).
We now proceed inductively. Let Fi be the smallest ﬁeld containing the points P0, . . . , Pi.
By the induction hypothesis, for each i = 3, 4, . . . , M, Pi was constructed using only the
points constructed before it and one of the three constructions for locating points in the
plane. Hence, Pi ∈Fi−1(
p
ki−1) for some positive ki−1 ∈Fi−1.
Noting only those times the ﬁeld Fi is a proper extension of Fi−1, we thus have that α
is in the ﬁeld FN where
Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂FN
and Fi+1 = Fi(√ki) where ki ∈Fi with ki ≥0, for i = 0, 1, . . . , N −1. (Notice that N, the
number of diﬀerent ﬁelds needed in the construction of α, is probably smaller than M, the
number of points actually constructed.)
2
Thus, for any constructible number, there is a ﬁnite sequence of quadratic extension
ﬁelds, the last of which will contain the given number. Of course, this was exactly what we

In Chapters 41–43 we will provide a more general theory of ﬁeld extensions (including
degrees other than 2); but this will require some new concepts, which we introduce in
Chapters 39 and 40. See Exercise 5 for an example of a non-quadratic extension.
Chapter Summary
We deﬁned quadratic ﬁeld extension. We examined what new points could be constructed
from points previously constructed and found that a new point was always in a quadratic
ﬁeld extension of the ﬁeld determined by the old points.
Finally, we proved the main result of this section, the Constructible Number Theorem,
which completely describes in algebraic terms which numbers are constructible.

Now consider {a + b
3√

Doing this problem should make you appreciate the geometric approach to ﬁnding
the tangent (it is perpendicular to a radial line) and the calculus approach (calculate
dy/dx).

Chapter 38
The Impossibility of Certain Constructions
The Constructible Number Theorem 37.3 is the most important piece of machinery neces-
sary to show that the three construction problems of the Greeks are indeed impossible with
a compass and a straightedge.
38.1
Doubling the Cube
We ﬁrst tackle the problem of doubling the cube. Recall the problem:
Given a line segment representing the edge of a cube, construct another line segment
representing the edge of a cube with twice the volume of the original cube.
We start with a line segment of length 1, and consider the cube with this segment as one
edge. A cube of twice the volume would have edges of length
3√
2. So, doubling the cube
then amounts to constructing the number
3√
2. We will show that
3√
2 is not constructible by
using the Constructible Number Theorem. We must prove that
3√
2 cannot be an element
of a ﬁeld at the end of a ﬁnite sequence of quadratic ﬁeld extensions that starts with the
rational numbers. The next lemma is the key to showing this.
Lemma 38.1 Let F(
√
k) be a real quadratic ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F. If
3√
2 ∈F(
√
k),
then
3√
2 ∈F.
Proof:
Suppose that
3√
2 ∈F(
√
k), a proper quadratic extension of the ﬁeld F. Then
3√
2 = a + b
√
k, with a, b ∈F and
√
k ̸∈F. We want to show that b = 0. But,
2
=
(a + b
√
k)3
=
a3 + 3a2b
√
k + 3ab2k + b3k
√
k
=
(a3 + 3ab2k) + (3a2b + b3k)
√
k.
If 3a2b + b3k ̸= 0, then we could solve the above equation for
√
k; the resulting equation
would show that
√
k ∈F. Hence, 3a2b + b3k = 0. But then,
(a −b
√
k)3
=
(a3 + 3ab2k) −(3a2b + b3k)
√
k
=
a3 + 3ab2k
=
2,
and so a −b
√
k is also a cube root of 2. Thus, a + b
√
k and a −b
√
k are both real roots of
x3 −2. But
x3 −2 = (x −
3√
2)(x2 +
3√
2x +
3√
4),
and the quadratic factor is irreducible in R[x].
387

Hence, a + b
√
k = a −b
√
k which implies that b = 0, as we wished.
2
It now follows from Lemma 38.1 that:
Theorem 38.2 It is impossible to double the cube.
Proof:
As noted, doubling the cube is equivalent to constructing
3√
2. But if
3√
2 were con-
structible, by the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3, there would exist a ﬁnite sequence
of quadratic ﬁeld extensions, Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂FN, with
3√
2 ∈FN.
But Lemma 38.1 says that if
3√
2 ∈FN = FN−1(
√
k), then
3√
2 ∈FN−1. Repeating this
argument inductively implies that
3√
2 ∈Q, which is false. (See Exercise 5.13.)
2
38.2
Trisecting the Angle
A similar approach is used to show that trisecting an angle is impossible. Again, recall the
problem:
Given an arbitrary angle, divide it into three equal parts.
The problem calls for a method to trisect all angles. If we can exhibit just one angle that
can’t be trisected, then such a method does not exist. The angle we will use is the 60◦angle.
As we’ve noted before, the 60◦angle is constructible—as an angle of an equilateral triangle,
for instance. Trisecting a 60◦angle implies the construction of a 20◦angle. But if we can
construct an angle α, we can construct the cosine of α, as the ﬁgure below shows.
α
1
cos α
So being able to trisect a 60◦angle implies that cos 20◦is a constructible number; this is
what we will show is impossible, using the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3.
We use the formulas for the sine and cosine of the sum of angles to perform the following
derivation:
cos 3θ
=
cos(2θ + θ)
=
cos 2θ cos θ −sin 2θ sin θ
=
(cos2 θ −sin2 θ) cos θ −(2 sin θ cos θ) sin θ
=
cos3 θ −3 sin2 θ cos θ
=
cos3 θ −3(1 −cos2 θ) cos θ
=
4 cos3 θ −3 cos θ
Setting θ = 20◦, cos 3θ = cos 60◦= 1/2, and so cos 20◦is a solution to 4x3 −3x −1/2 = 0
or 8x3 −6x −1 = 0; thus, 2 cos 20◦is a solution to x3 −3x −1 = 0. So, if cos 20◦were
constructible then so would 2 cos 20◦, which is a root of x3 −3x −1. Thus, if cos 20◦were
constructible, it would be possible to construct a real root of x3 −3x−1. We will show that
this is impossible, using the next lemma, which has the same ﬂavor as Lemma 38.1 above.

Chapter 38: The Impossibility of Certain Constructions
389
Lemma 38.3 Let F(
√
k) be a quadratic ﬁeld extension of a ﬁeld F. If the equation x3 −
3x −1 = 0 has a solution in F(
√
k), then it has a solution in F.
Proof:
Let a + b
√
k be a root of x3 −3x −1 in F(
√
k), a proper quadratic extension of
the ﬁeld F. If b = 0, then the root is a, which is in F. If b ̸= 0, we will show that −2a is a
root; this will still mean that x3 −3x −1 has a root in F. So, if b ̸= 0,
0
=
(a + b
√
k)3 −3(a + b
√
k) −1
=
a3 + 3a2b
√
k + 3ab2k + b3k
√
k −3a −3b
√
k −1
=
(a3 + 3ab2k −3a −1) + (3a2b + b3k −3b)
√
k.
But 3a2b + b3k −3b = 0, for otherwise,
√
k ∈F. But then a3 + 3ab2k −3a −1 = 0.
After dividing the ﬁrst equation by b (we know b ̸= 0), we have 3a2 + b2k −3 = 0, and so
b2k = 3 −3a2. Substituting this into the second equation we have,
0
=
a3 + 3a(3 −3a2) −3a −1
=
a3 + 9a −9a3 −3a −1
=
−8a3 + 6a −1
=
(−2a)3 −3(−2a) −1.
In other words, −2a is a root of x3 −3x −1.
2
Theorem 38.4 It is not possible to trisect an arbitrary angle.
Proof:
As noted before, if we could trisect a 60◦angle, we could construct a 20◦angle.
This means we could construct the number cos 20◦, and this implies that we can construct
a root of x3 −3x −1. Using Lemma 38.3 and the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3 and
arguing as in the previous theorem, we see that this implies that there is a rational root of
x3 −3x −1. But, by the Root Theorem 4.3, this implies that x3 −3x −1 factors in Q[x].
However, we can see that this polynomial is irreducible in Z[x] and so, by Gauss’s Lemma
5.5, is also irreducible in Q[x].
 Quick Exercise.
Why is x3 −3x −1 irreducible in Z[x]? 
Hence, x3 −3x −1 has no rational root, and so we cannot trisect a 60◦angle.

38.3
Squaring the Circle
Finally, we turn our attention to squaring the circle. Let’s state the problem carefully:
Given a circle, construct a square with the same area.
We are unable to give the full proof here of the impossibility of squaring the circle, because
one step is quite diﬃcult. Given a circle with radius 1, its area is π, and so to square the
circle we must be able to construct the number √π (to be the side of the required square).
Obviously, this is possible, if we could construct the number π itself. (This is the argument
for Exercise 36.e.)
In the 18th century the German mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert managed to
prove that π is not a rational number, by showing that if x is rational, then tan x cannot be;

390
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
because tan(π/4) = 1, Lambert’s theorem means that π/4 (and hence π) cannot be rational.
Lambert conjectured that π is a transcendental number; that is, a number that is not the
root of any polynomial in Q[x]. This was ﬁnally proved by another German mathematician,
Ferdinand Lindemann, in 1882; he made heavy use of the work of the Frenchman Charles
Hermite, who had proved the transcendence of e a decade earlier. As we shall see shortly,
Lindemann’s theorem ﬁnally laid to rest the last of the great constructibility problems of
the ancient Greeks.
Theorem 38.5
Lindemann’s Theorem
π is transcendental.
Proof:
The proof is long, diﬃcult, and analytic, rather than algebraic. For an accessible
version, see Field Theory and its Classical Problems, by Charles Hadlock.
2
To use Lindemann’s Theorem to prove the impossibility of squaring the circle, we ﬁrst
need a little more machinery.
Lemma 38.6 Suppose F(
√
k) is a quadratic ﬁeld extension of F. If α is a root of a poly-
nomial in F(
√
k)[x] of degree n, then it is the root of a polynomial in F[x] of degree 2n.
Proof:
Assume that α is a solution to an equation of the form
(an + bn
√
k)xn + · · · + (a0 + b0
√
k) = 0
where all the ai’s and bi’s are in the ﬁeld F and an and bn are not both zero. Moving the
terms with
√
k to the right side of the equation, we get
anxn + · · · + a0 = −
√
k(bnxn + · · · + b0).
Squaring both sides and moving all terms to the left gives a polynomial in F[x] that also
has α as a root. Now the leading term of this polynomial is (a2
n −kb2
n)x2n. This coeﬃcient
is not zero, because otherwise k = a2
n/b2
n, contradicting the fact that
√
k ̸∈F.
2
Theorem 38.7 If α is constructible, then α is the root of a polynomial in Q[x] of degree
2r, for some r ∈N.
Proof:
By the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3, α ∈FN, where Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂
· · · ⊂FN is a sequence of quadratic ﬁeld extensions. But α is the root of a linear equation
in FN, namely, x−α. By repeated application of Lemma 38.6, α is the root of a polynomial
in Q[x] of degree 2N.
2
So, if π were constructible, it would have to be the root of some polynomial in Q[x];
Lindemann’s Theorem says this is not true, and so we have:
Theorem 38.8 It is not possible to square the circle.
Historical Remarks
Our proofs that it is impossible to duplicate the cube and to trisect an arbitrary angle are
similar in ﬂavor to the ﬁrst such proofs, by Pierre Wantzel, which appeared in 1837. His
version of the Constructible Number Theorem asserted that any constructible number is
the root of an irreducible polynomial with degree a power of two, and hence numbers like
3√
2 and cos(20◦) are not constructible.

Chapter 38: The Impossibility of Certain Constructions
391
Another important impossibility result had been obtained a decade earlier by the Nor-
wegian mathematician Niels Abel, who showed that it is impossible to solve an arbitrary
ﬁfth-degree equation, using only elementary algebra and the extraction of roots. We made
reference to this result in the Historical Remarks following Chapter 10.
It turns out that both these achievements can be viewed most elegantly as part of a gen-
eral theory of ﬁeld extensions of the rational numbers, and it was the French mathematician
Evariste Galois who laid the important groundwork for this theory. In the remainder of this
book we will look into this important area of algebra.
Chapter Summary
We proved that it is impossible to double the cube, trisect an angle, or square the circle
using only a compass and a straightedge. The outline of the proofs are the same: If the
construction were possible, then we could construct a certain number. (For us, the numbers
are
3√
2 for doubling the cube, cos 20◦for trisecting an angle, and π for squaring the circle.)
But the Constructible Number Theorem or its corollaries show that each number is not
constructible; therefore, the three constructions are impossible.

Section VIII in a Nutshell
This section presents three famous compass and straightedge construction problems of the
ancient Greeks: doubling the cube, trisecting an angle, and squaring the circle. These prob-
lems were unsolved by the Greeks. We show that it is not in principle possible to make
these constructions, using modern algebraic (and not geometric) techniques.
When starting with a line segment of length 1, we call the length of any line segment
we can construct after a ﬁnite number of compass and straightedge construction steps to
be a constructible number. First, we show that the set of constructible numbers is a ﬁeld
(Corollary 36.3). We can construct all rational numbers (Lemma 36.1 and Theorem 36.2)
and all square roots of constructible numbers (Theorem 36.4). This development leads
to the Constructible Number Theorem (Theorem 37.3), which asserts that a number α is
constructible exactly if the following condition holds:
There exists a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds
Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂FN
with α ∈FN and Fi+1 = Fi(√ki) for some ki ∈Fi, with ki > 0 for i = 0, . . . , N −1.
We show that it is impossible to double the cube by showing that
2√
2 is not constructible
(Lemmas 38.1 and Theorem 38.2). We show that it is impossible to trisect a 60◦angle (that
is, construct a 20◦angle) by showing that to do so would imply being able to construct a
solution to x3 −3x −1 = 0, which we show is impossible (Lemma 38.3 and Theorem 38.4).
Finally, we consider the problem of squaring the circle. If this were possible, then π would
be a constructible number. Lindemann’s Theorem (Theorem 38.5 — which we do not prove)
says that π is transcendental: That is, π is not the root of any polynomial with rational
coeﬃcients. But we show that any constructible number is the root of a polynomial in Q[x]
of degree 2n (Theorem 38.7) and so is not transcendental. Thus it is impossible to square
the circle.

Chapter 39
Vector Spaces I
The three previous chapters showed the impossibility of the three famous Greek con-
structibility problems. Some of the grubbier parts of the proofs in the previous chapters
can be replaced by more elegant arguments—provided we know more about the algebraic
structures involved. The next ﬁve chapters will develop the machinery needed for these more
sophisticated arguments. The proofs we presented in Chapters 36–38 are correct and have
the advantage of not needing a great deal of sophistication in order to understand them.
However, the arguments to be presented next have the advantage of being much more el-
egant and concise (at the expense of being less accessible). This is not very surprising as
the more we know, the easier it is to express ourselves. As an added bonus, our additional
machinery will enable us to prove another impossibility result, regarding the solution of
polynomial equations using arithmetic and root extraction.
Putting our applications aside, the topics covered in these next few chapters are impor-
tant in their own right. The ﬁrst such topic we need to discuss is the notion of vector space;
this will allow us to better understand the ideas of ﬁeld extensions. As we shall see, a vector
space (like a ring, group, or ﬁeld) is just a set, equipped with operations satisfying certain
nice rules.
The study of vector spaces is a subject in its own right, called linear algebra, and you
may have the opportunity to take an entire course about this topic, if you haven’t already.
In the next two chapters we will develop only enough of the theory from this subject in
order to better understand ﬁelds. There is much more (both computational and theoretical)
to linear algebra than we will be able to present here.
39.1
Vectors
In calculus you studied vectors in two and three dimensions. Such vectors provide a very
useful way of looking at the geometry of the plane and three-dimensional space. In this
chapter, we wish to generalize the properties of such vectors, to cases that are not quite so
easily visualized. We will emphasize a more abstract and algebraic approach to vectors, but
you should keep in mind that the familiar vectors from calculus are important motivating
examples.
Let’s start by examining some of the algebraic properties of the familiar three-
dimensional vectors. We denote this set of vectors by R3. Recall that R3 = {(r1, r2, r3) :
ri ∈R}. Two of these vectors may be added coordinate-wise to get another vector. Addition
of two vectors has a nice geometric interpretation, as illustrated below.

You may not have given much thought to it at the time, but this vector addition has
the following properties: For v, w, and u ∈R3,
i. v + w = w + v,
ii. v + (w + u) = (v + w) + u,
iii. there exists a zero vector 0, with the property that v + 0 = v, and
iv. every vector v has an additive inverse −v, with the property that v + (−v) = 0.
You should recognize these as the same deﬁning properties possessed by addition in a ring
(see Chapter 6) or the properties of the operation in an abelian group (see Chapter 19).
Here, the additive identity is the zero vector 0. In R3, 0 = (0, 0, 0) and if v = (v1, v2, v3),
then −v = (−v1, −v2, −v3).
The other arithmetic operation in the algebra of vectors is scalar multiplication, in which
vectors are multiplied by scalars to give other vectors. Here, our scalars come from the ﬁeld
R. Scalar multiplication has the following properties: For r, s ∈R and v, w ∈R3,
v. (r + s)v = rv + sv,
vi. (rs)v = r(sv),
vii. r(v + w) = rv + rw, and
viii. 1v = v.
Note that the 1 in property (viii) is the scalar 1. You can easily show that these eight
properties hold in R2 as well as R3. Note that when we considered R3 as a ring we also
deﬁned coordinate-wise multiplication. However, when thinking of elements of R3 as vectors,
we will consider no such operation, because coordinate-wise multiplication of two vectors
has no simple geometric interpretation.
39.2
Vector Spaces
There are other algebraic objects for which the above eight properties hold. A vector space
V over a ﬁeld F is a set with a binary operation called addition that satisﬁes properties
(i) through (iv) above, together with a scalar multiplication of vectors from V by scalars
from F so that if r, s ∈F and v, w ∈V , then properties (v) through (viii) listed above
hold.
Note that scalar multiplication is not a binary operation in the sense we’ve discussed
before. Instead, scalar multiplication by the ﬁeld element r maps each vector in V to an-
other vector in V . We write rv to denote the vector that v gets mapped to and speak of
‘multiplying v by r’.

Chapter 39: Vector Spaces I
399
It is important to think carefully about the meaning of the axioms (v) through (viii)
and in particular where the operations are taking place. For example, the + on the left
side of the equation in axiom (v) denotes the addition in the ﬁeld F, while the + on
the right side denotes the addition of vectors in V . The juxtaposition of r with s in (vi)
denotes multiplication in the ﬁeld, while the juxtaposition of (rs) with v denotes the scalar
multiplication. You should be careful to keep track of which operation is which.
 Quick Exercise.
Look at the other axioms, and make sure you understand which of
the operations are meant in each case. 
We now examine some examples of vector spaces:
Example 39.1
The ﬁeld C of complex numbers is a vector space over R, the ﬁeld of real numbers.
Here, the vectors are complex numbers and the scalars are real numbers.
To show that this is a vector space, we ﬁrst note that the set of vectors is closed
with respect to addition (because C is a ﬁeld, which is closed under addition) and that
properties (i) through (iv) are properties of addition in all ﬁelds. Now, let’s look at
property (v). Let r and s be real numbers and v = a + bi ∈C. Then
(r + s)v = (r + s)(a + bi) = r(a + bi) + s(a + bi),
because multiplication in a ﬁeld enjoys the distributive property. Thus, we have shown
that (r+s)v = rv+sv, as desired. The remaining properties are just as straightforward
to show.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that properties (vi) through (viii) hold here. 
We will generalize the idea of this example in Exercise 9.
Example 39.2
The set of complex numbers C forms a vector space over itself! Here, the vector space
axioms are just properties that hold for addition and multiplication in a ﬁeld.
 Quick Exercise.
What does axiom (vi) mean in this context? 
In the next example we provide a natural generalization of the vector space R3 (over
the ﬁeld R).
Example 39.3
The set F n of n-tuples with coordinates from the arbitrary ﬁeld F is a vector space over
F. Here, a typical vector is of the form (a1, a2, . . . , an) where ai ∈F and scalars are
elements of F. The addition is coordinate-wise, and multiplication by a scalar merely
multiplies each coordinate by that scalar. In Exercise 3, you will verify the details of
this.
To be more concrete, the set Z3 × Z3 of ordered pairs with coordinates from the
ﬁeld Z3 is a vector space, over the ﬁeld Z3.
 Quick Exercise.
List all the elements of this vector space. 

Example 39.4
The set of polynomials Q[x] is a vector space over Q. The vectors are polynomials and
the scalars are rational numbers. (See Exercise 1.)
Example 39.5
Let Qn[x] be the set of polynomials of degree no more than n with coeﬃcients from Q.
This is a vector space over Q. Here, vectors are polynomials of degree no more than
n and scalars are rational numbers. This example illustrates the fact that in a vector
space, there need be no multiplication of vectors, but only addition of vectors: Qn[x]
is closed under addition but not multiplication. (See Exercise 2.)
Example 39.6
Q(

2) = {a + b
√
2 : a, b ∈Q}, is a vector space over Q. Here, vectors are elements
from Q(

2) and scalars are from Q.
 Quick Exercise.
This example bears certain similarities with Example 39.1; ex-
plain this. Hint: What kind of ring is Q(

2)? 
The point we’ve made above in Example 39.5 bears repeating: In many of these examples
of vector spaces it is natural also to deﬁne multiplication of vectors, as in our ﬁrst example
R3. Indeed, in many cases the vector space is a ring or ﬁeld in its own right. But when we
look at these as vector spaces over some ﬁeld, we look at their structure in a diﬀerent way
and multiplication of vectors is not one of the operations considered. This change of point
of view is important to keep in mind.
We now prove some basic properties of vector spaces. These properties should seem
familiar, both from your previous experience with ring and group theory, and also any
previous experience you have had with vectors, either in calculus or linear algebra.
Theorem 39.1 Let V be a vector space over F with v ∈V and r ∈F. Then, the additive
inverse −v of v is unique. Also, 0v = 0, r0 = 0, and
(−r)v = r(−v) = −(rv).
Proof:
Because (V, +) is a group, the uniqueness of the additive inverse follows from
Theorem 20.1.d.
Note the diﬀerence between the scalar 0 and the zero vector 0. The ﬁrst identity says
that multiplying any vector by the zero scalar yields the zero vector. But,
0v = (0 + 0)v = 0v + 0v,
and so adding −(0v), the additive inverse of 0v, to both sides, we get that 0 = 0v, as
desired.
Note that in proving that 0v = 0, we used the fact that 0 was the additive identity of
F and one of the distributive laws (v). To prove the next identity, we will use the fact that
0 is the additive identity of V and the other distributive law (vii). So,
r0 = r(0 + 0) = r0 + r0,
and so 0 = r0, as before.

Chapter 39: Vector Spaces I
401
To show that (−r)v = −(rv), we will show that (−r)v is the additive inverse of rv.
That is, it must be equal to −(rv). We do this by adding (−r)v to rv and showing that
the sum is 0. Doing so, we have
(−r)v + rv = (−r + r)v = 0v = 0,
as desired. You can show in a similar manner that r(−v) = −(rv).
 Quick Exercise.
Show that r(−v) = −(rv). 

The proofs of the results of Theorem 39.1 might seem familar, and should indeed be
compared to the solutions to Exercises 6.1 and 6.2.

Chapter 40
Vector Spaces II
In the previous chapter we deﬁned vector spaces. In this chapter we examine subsets of
vector spaces that in some way generate the entire vector space. This idea gives rise to a
way of measuring the size of a vector space.
40.1
Spanning Sets
If V is a vector space over F and
{v1, v2, . . . , vn} ⊆V,
then a linear combination of v1, v2, . . . , vn is the vector
a1v1 + a2v2 + · · · + anvn,
where the ai are scalars. The collection of vectors that can be written as linear combinations
of a given set of vectors V is the set spanned by V.
Example 40.1
Consider the vectors v = (1, 0, 0) and w = (0, 1, 0) in R3. The vector
1
3, −1, 0

= 1
3v + (−1)w,
and so is a linear combination of v and w. Evidently, the set of all vectors in R3
spanned by v and w is exactly {(x, y, 0) : x, y ∈R}.
 Quick Exercise.
Why is the set of vectors spanned by v and w equal to {(x, y, 0) :
x, y ∈R}? 
Note that if we include the vector (0, 0, 1), we then obtain all vectors in R3 as
linear combinations of these three vectors.
Example 40.2
It is not so evident which vectors in R3 are spanned by (1, 0, −1) and (3, 2, 1). We can
certainly conclude that the set spanned by them consists of all vectors of the form
(x + 3y, 2y, −x + y),
where
x, y ∈R,
but what vectors are these? For example, does the vector (1, 1, −1) belong to this set?
If it did, there would be a simultaneous solution to the three equations
x + 3y
=
1
2y
=
1
−x + y
=
−1.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
It’s pretty easy to see that there is no such solution.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that there is no solution to this system of equations. 
Thus, (1, 1, −1) is not a linear combination of (1, 0, −1) and (3, 2, 1).
If every vector of V can be written as a linear combination of vectors from a subset V of
V , we say that V spans (or generates) V . Note that V may be inﬁnite or ﬁnite, but any
given linear combination of vectors from V involves only a ﬁnite number of vectors.
Example 40.3
For instance, from our discussion above it is clear that
{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}
spans R3.
Example 40.4
Similarly,
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (0, 1, 0), (−1, 0, −1), (0, 0, 1)}
spans R3 because
(x, y, z)
=
x(1, 0, 0) + 0(2, 3, 0) + y(0, 1, 0) +
0(−1, 0, −1) + z(0, 0, 1).
Note that this spanning set contains more vectors than necessary. Furthermore, there
may be more than one way of expressing a given vector as a linear combination of
vectors in the spanning set. For instance, we can express (−2, −2, −5) as
−2(1, 0, 0) + 0(2, 3, 0) −2(0, 1, 0) + 0(−1, 0, −1) −5(0, 0, 1),
or as
2(1, 0, 0) −1(2, 3, 0) + 1(0, 1, 0) + 2(−1, 0, −1) −3(0, 0, 1).
Example 40.5
Now let’s consider the set
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (−1, 0, −1)}.
It is not so obvious that this also spans R3. To show this, we consider a arbitrary
vector (x, y, z) from R3 and show that we can express it as a linear combination of the
three vectors in the set. That is, we wish to ﬁnd scalars a1, a2, and a3 such that
(x, y, z) = a1(1, 0, 0) + a2(2, 3, 0) + a3(−1, 0, −1).
This vector equation is equivalent to the following three linear equations, which we
must solve simultaneously:
x
=
a1
+
2a2
−
a3
y
=
3a2
z
=
−
a3

Chapter 40: Vector Spaces II
405
By the usual techniques we ﬁnd the solutions for a1, a2, and a3 are
a1
=
x −2
3y −z
a2
=
1
3y
a3
=
−z.
So, for instance,
(3, 1, −2) = 13
3 (1, 0, 0) + 1
3(2, 3, 0) + 2(−1, 0, −1).
Example 40.6
Consider the vector space Q[x] over Q. Note that {1, x, x2, x3, . . .} spans Q[x].
 Quick Exercise.
Show that {1, x, x2, x3, . . .} spans Q[x]. 
In this case, we have an inﬁnite spanning set.
A vector space is said to be ﬁnite dimensional if there is a ﬁnite set of vectors that
spans the vector space. So, R3 is ﬁnite dimensional over R.
The vector space C over R is ﬁnite dimensional because {1, i} spans C.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that the vector space C over R is ﬁnite dimensional. 
Likewise, Q(

2) over Q is ﬁnite dimensional because {1,
√
2} spans Q(
√
2).
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that Q(
√
2) over Q is ﬁnite dimensional. 
However, Q[x] is not ﬁnite dimensional over Q. In Example 40.6 we gave an inﬁnite span-
ning set for Q[x]; this alone does not suﬃce in showing that Q[x] is not ﬁnite dimensional—it
may be that there exists some ﬁnite set of vectors that does indeed span Q[x]. To show that
Q[x] is not ﬁnite dimensional, we must show that every ﬁnite subset of Q[x] fails to span
Q[x]. This is Exercise 7. For the most part, we will conﬁne our study here to ﬁnite dimen-
sional vector spaces.
40.2
A Basis for a Vector Space
In the remainder of this chapter we will examine spanning sets that are minimal in the
sense that removing any one vector from the set will result in a set that does not span the
entire vector space.
The following is an important deﬁnition for us. A set of vectors
{v1, v2, . . . , vn}
is linearly independent if
a1v1 + a2v2 + · · · + anvn = 0
implies that a1 = a2 = · · · = an = 0. A set of vectors that is not linearly independent is
linearly dependent.

406
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 40.7
We can easily see that {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} is linearly independent in R3 because
if
a1(1, 0, 0) + a2(0, 1, 0) + a3(0, 0, 1) = (0, 0, 0), then
(a1, a2, a3) = (0, 0, 0), or a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. The set
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (−1, 0, −1)}
is also linearly independent, which we can verify by showing that the resulting system
of equations has a unique solution of a1 = a2 = a3 = 0.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that the above system of equations has a unique solution
of a1 = a2 = a3 = 0. 
Example 40.8
By contrast,
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (0, 1, 0), (−1, 0, −1), (0, 0, 1)}
is linearly dependent because
(0, 0, 0)
=
−2(1, 0, 0) + 1(2, 3, 0) −3(0, 1, 0) +
0(−1, 0, −1) + 0(0, 0, 1).
(There are other possible values here for the ai.)
 Quick Exercise.
Find a diﬀerent set of values for the ai. 
Example 40.9
The set of vectors {1 +
√
2, 2 −
√
2} is linearly independent in the vector space Q(
√
2)
over Q. But if we include the third vector 6
√
2 in this set, it becomes dependent,
because
2(1 +
√
2) + (−1)(2 −
√
2) −1
2(6
√
2) = 0.
The following theorem conveniently characterizes linearly independent sets of vectors:
Theorem 40.1 {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is a set of linearly dependent vectors in the vector space
V if and only if one of the vectors from this set can be written as a linear combination of
the others.
Proof:
If {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is linearly dependent then we can write
a1v1 + a2v2 + · · · + anvn = 0,
where the ai’s are not all 0. By renumbering the vectors, if necessary, let’s assume that a1
is not zero. But then,
v1 = −a2
a1
v2 −a3
a1
v3 −· · · −an
a1
vn,
as desired. Note that division by scalars is permissible, because they come from a ﬁeld.
Conversely, suppose one of the vectors (say, v1) can be expressed as a linear combination
of the others:
v1 = a2v2 + a3v3 + · · · + anvn.

Chapter 40: Vector Spaces II
407
But then,
0 = −1v1 + a2v2 + a3v3 + · · · + anvn.
And so the set {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is linearly dependent.
2
Looking at this another way, this theorem says that a set of vectors is linearly inde-
pendent if and only if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the
others. Thus, if a set of vectors V is linearly independent and spans the vector space V , no
proper subset of V can span V . In particular, any vector removed from V cannot be written
as a linear combination of the remaining vectors. In other words, V is a minimal spanning
set for V . We have a name for such a spanning set: A basis for a vector space V is a linearly
independent set of vectors that spans V .
 Quick Exercise.
We have thus argued above that any basis is a minimal spanning set.
The converse is also true: Any minimal spanning set is linearly independent, and so a basis.
What is the argument for this?

Example 40.10
{(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} is a basis for R3, as is
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (−1, 0, −1)}.
Example 40.11
{1, i} is a basis for C over R. Note in this case, where our basis has two elements, linear
independence is particularly easy to check: By Theorem 40.1 we need only verify that
neither of the vectors is a scalar (in this case, real) multiple of the other. This is
certainly true for 1 and i.
Example 40.12
{1+i,
√
2+4i} is a basis for C over R. To check this requires a solution of two equations
in two unknowns that we leave as Exercise 12. This example should make evident the
fact that there are inﬁnitely many distinct bases for C over R.
Example 40.13
{1,
√
2} is a basis for Q(
√
2) over Q.
In the Quick Exercise above, we emphasized the fact that being a linearly independent
spanning set (that is, a basis) is actually equivalent to being a minimal spanning set. We
can change perspective a bit, and also prove that being a basis is equivalent to being a
maximal independent set; you will pursue this in Exercises 16 and 17.
The following is another important equivalent characterization of a basis, which you will
prove in Exercise 8.
Theorem 40.2 V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} is a basis for a vector space V if and only if every
element of V can be uniquely written as a linear combination of the vi.

408
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
The last important goal of this chapter is to show that for a ﬁnite dimensional vector
space, all bases have the same number of vectors. (This is also true for inﬁnite dimensional
vector spaces, but the proof requires more sophisticated set theory than we wish to use
here.) The number of elements in a basis for a vector space will then become an invariant
of the space; that is, the number of elements in a basis is independent of the particular basis
determined. The number of basis vectors consequently provides us with a good measure of
the ‘size’ of the space. It is exactly this measure of size that we will need when we return
to the theory of ﬁeld extensions.
But ﬁrst, we make a simple observation about linear combinations: If v is a linear
combination of v1, v2, . . . , vn, and each vi is a linear combination of w1, w2, . . . , wm, then
v is a linear combination of w1, w2, . . . , wm. To show this, simply write v as a linear
combination of the vi and substitute for each vi the appropriate linear combination of the
wj. (This is Exercise 15.)
40.3
Finding a Basis
Now suppose V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space spanned by V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn}. Then
we will argue below that we can ﬁnd a subset of V that is a basis for V . That is, any ﬁnite
spanning set for a vector space contains a linearly independent spanning set, which is then
necessarily a basis.
We build this set in the following way. We may as well assume that V does not have
zero dimension and none of the vi is the zero vector. First, we start with v1. We add each
vi in succession until we ﬁnd a vi that is a linear combination of the previous vj, j < i.
We discard this vi. We continue in this manner, adding or discarding vectors until we’ve
run through the vectors in V. Call the set of vectors that remains B. This set also spans V
because we have removed only those vectors that can be expressed as linear combinations
of the vectors in V that come before it, and so, by Exercise 15, B also spans V . It remains
to show that B is linearly independent.
By way of contradiction, suppose B = {vi1, vi2, . . . , vik} is linearly dependent where
i1, i2, . . . , ik are indices of the vectors in V with i1 < i2 < · · · < ik. Then
0 = a1vi1 + a2vi2 + · · · + akvik,
where not all the ak are zero. Pick the largest j with aj ̸= 0. Then, solving the above for
vij, we can express vij as a linear combination of vectors in V with smaller indices, which
is a contradiction. Therefore, B ⊆V is linearly independent, and thus a basis for V. We
summarize this in the following theorem.
Theorem 40.3 Every ﬁnite spanning set of a vector space contains a subset that is a basis
for the vector space.
We demonstrate this technique by ﬁnding a subset of
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (0, 1, 0), (−1, 0, −1), (0, 0, 1)}
that is a basis for R3. We have already shown in Examples 40.4 and 40.8 that this set is
linearly dependent and spans R3.
We start with the set {(1, 0, 0)}. Now we add the vector (2, 3, 0), if (2, 3, 0) is not a
linear combination of {(1, 0, 0)}. Because this is clearly not the case (a linear combination

Chapter 40: Vector Spaces II
409
of a single vector is a scalar multiple of that vector), we add it to our set, which is now
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0)}.
The next vector is (0, 1, 0). To see if (0, 1, 0) is a linear combination of (1, 0, 0) and
(2, 3, 0), we attempt to solve
(0, 1, 0) = a(1, 0, 0) + b(2, 3, 0),
and ﬁnd that there is a solution of a = −2/3 and b = 1/3. Thus, (0, 1, 0) is discarded and
our set remains {(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0)}.
We next see if the vector (−1, 0, −1) is a linear combination of (1, 0, 0) and (2, 3, 0) by
attempting to solve
(−1, 0, −1) = a(1, 0, 0) + b(2, 3, 0).
But we easily see that there is no solution to this equation. (There is no way to make the
third coordinate of the right-hand side non-zero.) Hence, we add this vector, making our
set
{(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (−1, 0, −1)}.
Finally, we consider the last vector and try to solve
(0, 0, 1) = a(1, 0, 0) + b(2, 3, 0) + c(−1, 0, −1).
We ﬁnd that there is a solution of a = c = −1 and b = 0. Thus, (0, 0, 1) is discarded,
leaving the set {(1, 0, 0), (2, 3, 0), (−1, 0, −1)} as a basis for R3. Note that a reordering of
the vectors in our original set might produce a diﬀerent basis for R3. You will see this
explicitly in Exercise 14.
40.4
Dimension of a Vector Space
We are now ready to prove that any two bases for a ﬁnite dimensional vector space have
the same number of vectors.
Theorem 40.4 Suppose that V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space with basis W =
{w1, w2, . . . , wm} and V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn, . . .} is another linearly independent spanning
set. Then V has no more than m elements. Thus every basis for V has exactly m elements.
Proof:
We start by considering the spanning set
{v1, w1, w2, . . . , wm}.
This set is linearly dependent, because v1 is a linear combination of the wi. So, it contains
a subset that is a basis. (Of course, W is such a subset, but we’re going to force v1 into
a basis.) We proceed to ﬁnd this subset using the method described above. Here, we ﬁrst
include v1 and then proceed through the wi and will discard at least one of the wi. We
claim that only one is discarded. Suppose that wi and wj are both discarded, where i < j.
Then,
wi = a0v1 + a1w1 + · · · + ai−1wi−1.
Now a0 ̸= 0, else we’ve expressed wi as a linear combination of the vectors w1, w2, . . . ,
wi−1, contradicting the linear independence of W. So we can write
v1 = −a1
a0
w1 −a2
a0
w2 −· · · −ai−1
a0
wi−1 + 1
a0
wi.
(40.1)

410
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Likewise, we can write wj as
wj = b0v1 + b1w1 + · · · + bj−1wj−1.
(40.2)
But if we substitute expression (40.1) for v1 into equation (40.2), we will have expressed
wj as a linear combination of the other vectors in W, again contradicting the linear inde-
pendence of W.
Thus, the linearly independent subset of
{v1, w1, w2, . . . , wm}
has precisely one fewer vector in it, and that discarded vector was one of the wi. By
renumbering, if necessary, let’s suppose that the discarded vector was w1. So, the new basis
we obtained is {v1, w2, w3, . . . , wm}.
Now add v2 to this basis so that our set is now
{v1, v2, w2, . . . , wm}.
Again, this is a spanning set that is linearly dependent and so contains a linearly independent
subset which we ﬁnd by the now familiar method. Note that neither v1 nor v2 will be
discarded in the process, because v1, v2 is a linearly independent set. So, the discarded
vector will be one of the wi. (There will be only one discarded by an argument similar
to the one above.) Again, by renumbering if necessary, we assume that w2 was the one
discarded, leaving the set {v1, v2, w3, w4, . . . , wm} as the basis.
We repeat this process, successively adding v3, v4, . . . , and vn and each time discarding
one of the wi to get yet another basis for V . We will never run out of the wi’s before
exhausting the vj’s, because then we would have a basis for V consisting of a proper subset
of V. (This can’t be, because by the Quick Exercise in Section 40.2 a basis is a minimal
spanning set.) This means that V must actually be a ﬁnite set, with no more than m
elements.
By interchanging the roles of V and W, and repeating the above argument, we obtain
that these two sets have the same (ﬁnite) number of elements.

The dimension of a given vector space is the number of vectors in any basis (this
deﬁnition for our purposes applies only for ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces, although it can
be extended to the inﬁnite case).
Example 40.14
The dimension of the vector space R3 over R is 3.
Example 40.15
The vector space C over R has dimension 2, and the vector space Q(
√
2) over Q has
dimension 2.
Example 40.16
Consider the vector space
V = {f ∈Z3[x] : deg(f) ≤2}
over Z3, which we considered in Exercise 39.c. This vector space has dimension 3,
because {1, x, x2} is a basis.

We can easily obtain two important corollaries from Theorem 40.4:
Corollary 40.5 Suppose that V is a ﬁnite dimensional vector space, and U is a linearly
independent subset of V . Then U has ﬁnitely many elements, and there is a basis W for V
with U ⊆W.
Proof:
Choose a basis V = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} for V with n elements. Now if U is already
a spanning set, then it is a basis, and by the previous theorem it has exactly n elements.
If U is not a spanning set, we run through the vectors of V one at a time as follows, to
build the basis W containing U: Begin by letting W = U. For step i, check whether vi is
spanned by W. If it is, we add nothing to W. If, however, vi is not in the span of W, we add
it to W; the set W remains linearly independent. After n steps, we will have augmented U,
building a larger set W that remains linearly independent but now must span V (because
V does). But the previous theorem asserts that this set is ﬁnite, with exactly n elements.
Thus the original set U must have been ﬁnite, and it is indeed a subset of a basis for V . 2
Corollary 40.6 Every set in an n-dimensional vector space with more than n elements is
linearly dependent.
Proof:
Any linearly independent set can by the previous corollary be augmented to obtain
a basis for the vector space. But any basis for the vector space has no more than n elements.

Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned linear combination, spanning set, linear independence, linear
dependence, and basis.
We showed that any spanning set contains a subset that is a basis and that all bases
for a given ﬁnite dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors. The number
of vectors in a basis for a vector space is the dimension of the vector space.

Chapter 41
Field Extensions and Kronecker’s Theorem
Consider the polynomial x2 + 1 ∈R[x]. This polynomial clearly has no roots in R, but we
know that there exists a larger ﬁeld—namely, C—in which this polynomial does have roots.
In this chapter we develop a general method for constructing bigger ﬁelds, with the aim of
being able to further factor polynomials.
41.1
Field Extensions
A ﬁeld E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F if E ⊇F. That is, E is an extension ﬁeld of
F exactly if F is a subﬁeld of E; in this situation, we call the ﬁeld F the base ﬁeld. For
example, R is an extension ﬁeld of Q, C is an extension ﬁeld of both R and Q, and Q(
√
2)
is an extension ﬁeld of Q.
If E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and α ∈E is a root of a polynomial in F[x], we
say α is algebraic over F. Otherwise, α is transcendental over F.
Example 41.1
Note ﬁrst that if E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and α ∈F, then trivially α is
algebraic over F because we can easily ﬁnd a polynomial p ∈F[x] such that p(α) = 0.
 Quick Exercise.
Find such a polynomial. 
Example 41.2
The complex ﬁeld C is an extension ﬁeld of Q, and because
√
2 is a root of x2−2 ∈Q[x],
√
2 is algebraic over Q. Also, i is algebraic over Q because i is a root of x2 + 1 ∈Q[x].
Example 41.3
The real ﬁeld R is an extension ﬁeld of Q. As we mentioned in Chapter 38 (see Theorem
38.5), the numbers e and π are transcendental over Q; that is, neither e nor π are roots
of any polynomial in Q[x]. These famous and diﬃcult results are due to Hermite and
Lindemann, respectively.

Kronecker’s Theorem
We now prove an extremely important theorem due to Leopold Kronecker, an eminent
German mathematician of the latter part of the 19th century. Given a polynomial f in
415

416
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
F[x], is there a ﬁeld extension of the ﬁeld F that contains a root of f? Kronecker’s Theorem
provides us with an aﬃrmative answer to this question.
Note that this theorem will apply to any polynomial over any ﬁeld. Furthermore, while
the description of the extension ﬁeld will seem somewhat abstract—we will ﬁnd that it is
a ring of cosets of F[x]—later theorems will allow us to explicitly describe some of these
extension ﬁelds in a way that is more palatable.
Theorem 41.1
Kronecker’s Theorem
Let F be a ﬁeld and f a polynomial in F[x]
of degree at least 1. Then there exists an extension ﬁeld E of F and an α ∈E such that
f(α) = 0.
Proof:
If f has a root in the ﬁeld F, then F itself is the required extension ﬁeld. So
we may as well assume that f has no roots in F. From Chapter 10 we know that f can
be factored into irreducible polynomials in F[x]; note that each of these polynomials has
degree at least two. Let p be one of these irreducible factors. We will show that there is an
extension ﬁeld E of F and an α ∈E with p(α) = 0.
From Theorem 15.1 we know that because p is irreducible in F[x], the principal ideal
⟨p⟩is maximal in the principal ideal domain F[x]. Hence, from Theorem 15.2, F[x]/⟨p⟩is a
ﬁeld. This is our ﬁeld E.
We now need to show two things. First, we must show that E can be viewed as an
extension ﬁeld of F; that is, we will obtain an injection from F into E. Second, we need to
ﬁnd an element of E that is a root of p.
We show that there is an injection from F into F[x]/⟨p⟩by considering the function
ψ : F →F[x]/⟨p⟩deﬁned by ψ(a) = ⟨p⟩+ a, where a ∈F. That is, an element in F is
mapped to its coset in F[x]/⟨p⟩. (Note this function makes a subtle shift in viewing a. First,
we think of a as an element of F while the image of a treats a as a polynomial in F[x].)
It is evident that ψ is a ring homomorphism, because of the way the ring operations are
deﬁned on the ring of cosets.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that ψ is a ring homomorphism. 
We now claim that ψ is one-to-one; to show this, we will verify that its kernel is {0}.
For that purpose, suppose that
ψ(a) = ⟨p⟩+ a = ⟨p⟩+ 0.
Then a ∈⟨p⟩. But the ideal ⟨p⟩is precisely the set of multiples of p and because p has
degree at least 2, so do all the non-zero elements of ⟨p⟩. But a (viewed as a polynomial in
F[x], of course) has degree 0, and so a must be the zero polynomial. That is, the kernel of
ψ is trivial, and so ψ is injective. We consequently may as well assume that F is a subﬁeld
of the ﬁeld F[x]/⟨p⟩.
Finally, we must ﬁnd an element of F[x]/⟨p⟩that is a root of our polynomial p. Consider
the element α = ⟨p⟩+ x. Suppose p = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn. Then
p(α) = a0 + a1(⟨p⟩+ x) + · · · + an(⟨p⟩+ x)n ∈F[x]/⟨p⟩.
But we do arithmetic in F[x]/⟨p⟩by choosing any coset representative we wish. If we pick
x as the coset representative of ⟨p⟩+ x, then
p(α) = ⟨p⟩+ a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn = ⟨p⟩+ p = ⟨p⟩+ 0.
But ⟨p⟩+ 0 is the zero element of the ﬁeld F[x]/⟨p⟩, and so we have found our desired
element of F[x]/⟨p⟩.
2
Let’s perform the construction of the theorem in two speciﬁc cases.

Chapter 41: Field Extensions and Kronecker’s Theorem
417
Example 41.4
Consider the polynomial f = x3 −5 ∈Q[x]; it has no roots in Q.
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that f = x3 −5 has no roots in Q. 
Thus, f is irreducible in Q[x], and so ⟨f⟩is a maximal ideal. This makes E = Q[x]/⟨f⟩
a ﬁeld. Furthermore, we may identify Q with the subﬁeld
{⟨x3 −5⟩+ q : q ∈Q}
of E. The element ⟨f⟩+ x of E is then the required root for the polynomial f, because
f(⟨f⟩+ x) = (⟨f⟩+ x)3 −5 = ⟨f⟩+ x3 −5 = ⟨f⟩+ f = ⟨f⟩+ 0.
Example 41.5
Consider the polynomial p = x2 + x + 1 in Z2[x]. It has no roots in Z2, because the
only possibilities are 0 and 1, and neither works. Thus, p is irreducible in Z2[x], and
so ⟨p⟩is a maximal ideal. This makes E = Z2[x]/⟨p⟩a ﬁeld. Furthermore, we may
identify Z2 with the subﬁeld
{⟨p⟩+ 0, ⟨p⟩+ 1}
of E. The element ⟨p⟩+ x of E is then the required root for the polynomial p.
In the next chapter, we prove a theorem that gives a much more explicit description of
F[x]/⟨p⟩. For example, x2 + 1 is irreducible in R[x], and so x2 + 1 has a root in the ﬁeld
R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩. But we also know that
R(i) = {a + bi : a, b ∈R} = C,
is a ﬁeld in which i is a root of x2+1. We will see that these two ﬁelds are in fact isomorphic.
41.3
The Characteristic of a Field
It turns out that every ﬁeld has a unique smallest subﬁeld, which we call the prime subﬁeld.
This fact provides us with many nice examples of ﬁeld extensions.
To show that this is true, suppose that K is an arbitrary ﬁeld, with multiplicative
identity 1. Consider what happens when we repeatedly add 1 to itself: We get the elements
1,
1 + 1 = 2,
1 + 2 = 3
· · · .
In the case of a ﬁeld like R, this process goes on forever, and we obtain in this way all the
positive integers. But in the case of a ﬁeld like Z13, we obtain 0, once we have added 1 to
itself thirteen times. The characteristic of the ﬁeld K is the least positive integer n so
that n · 1 = 0 (if such exists). If no such n exists, we set the characteristic to 0. (If you did
Exercise 8.14, you have already encountered this concept, in a more general context.)
Example 41.6
The characteristic of such ﬁelds as Q, R, C, and Q(
√
2) is zero, while the characteristic
of the ﬁeld Zp is p.

418
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 41.7
Consider now the ﬁeld E constructed in Example 41.5. What is the characteristic of
this ﬁeld? The multiplicative identity in E is the coset ⟨p⟩+ 1, and clearly
(⟨p⟩+ 1) + (⟨p⟩+ 1) = ⟨p⟩+ 0.
This means that the characteristic of E is 2.
Although we deﬁned the characteristic in terms of the number of times 1 could be added
to itself, notice that the properties of arithmetic in a ﬁeld means that we can in fact deﬁne
characteristic in terms of any non-zero element. For if n · 1 = 0, then
n · r = (r + r + · · · + r) = r(1 + 1 + · · · + 1) = r(n · 1),
and so n · 1 = 0 if and only if n · r = 0.
 Quick Exercise.
Why is the fact that a ﬁeld has no zero divisors relevant to this
remark? 
Notice that the only values for the characteristic we have obtained in our examples are
0 and positive prime integers. It is easy to prove that these are the only possible cases:
Theorem 41.2 The characteristic of any ﬁeld is either 0 or a positive prime integer.
Proof:
Suppose that a ﬁeld F has characteristic n > 0, and that n has a non-trivial
factorization n = rs. Then
(r1)(s1) = (1 + · · · + 1)(1 + · · · + 1) = (1 + 1 + · · · + 1) = (rs)1 = 0
(where we have added 1 to itself r times, s times, and then rs times, in the previous
computation). But because a ﬁeld has no zero divisors, this means that either r1 or s1 is
zero, and this contradicts the minimality of n.
2
Suppose now that F is a ﬁeld with characteristic zero. We deﬁne a function ι : Q →F
as follows: Given a/b ∈Q (where a and b are integers, with b ̸= 0), let ι(a/b) = (a·1)/(b·1).
Notice ﬁrst that the quotient makes sense, because in a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, b · 1 ̸= 0.
It is now easy to prove that this function preserves both addition and multiplication, and
so is a ring homomorphism.
 Quick Exercise.
Check these two facts. 
But the kernel of ι is evidently {0}, because if a ∈Z and a ̸= 0, then a · 1 ̸= 0 (because the
ﬁeld has characteristic zero).
Thus, any ﬁeld of characteristic zero contains (an isomorphic copy of) the ﬁeld Q. And
so, such a ﬁeld is necessarily a vector space over the rational numbers. This copy of Q is
the unique smallest subﬁeld of F. (You will prove this fact in Exercise 7a.) This copy of Q
is called the prime subﬁeld of F.
Example 41.8
In Example 41.4, we identiﬁed the prime subﬁeld of the ﬁeld E as the set {⟨f⟩+ q :
q ∈Q}.
What about ﬁelds with non-zero characteristic? If a ﬁeld F has characteristic p, where
p is a positive prime integer, then we deﬁne ι : Zp →F by setting ι([1]) = 1, and extending
this function additively. That is, we set ι([2]) = 1 + 1, and so forth. This function is also an
injective ring homomorphism (see Exercise 6), and so any ﬁeld with characteristic p contains
(an isomorphic copy of) the ﬁeld Zp. This copy of Zp is the unique smallest subﬁeld of F.
(Again: You will prove this fact in Exercise 7b.) This copy of Zp is called the prime subﬁeld
of F.

Chapter 41: Field Extensions and Kronecker’s Theorem
419
Example 41.9
In Example 41.5, we identiﬁed the prime subﬁeld of the ﬁeld E as the set {⟨p⟩+0, ⟨p⟩+
1}.
 Quick Exercise.
What can you say about a ﬁeld which has dimension 1 as a vector
space over its prime ﬁeld? 
We can view the prime subﬁeld of a ﬁeld as the result of applying all the ﬁeld operations
to the multiplicative identity 1. If the ﬁeld has characteristic zero, this gives (an isomorphic
copy of) Q; if the ﬁeld has characteristic p, this gives (an isomorphic copy of) Zp. Note
that if we know the characteristic of a ﬁeld F and E ⊇F is any extension ﬁeld, then E
will automatically have the same characteristic as F, because its prime subﬁeld will be the
same.
Alternatively, we could do the following: Given a ﬁeld K, consider the set of all sub-
ﬁelds E ⊆K; this set is non-empty, because K itself is such a subﬁeld. Now consider the
intersection of all such subﬁelds. The result is certainly non-empty, because it necessarily
contains the element 1. It is also a ﬁeld (as you prove in Exercise 8). It is necessarily the
smallest subﬁeld of K, which is then the prime subﬁeld.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we deﬁned the phrase E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F. In this case we
also deﬁned what it means for an element of E to be algebraic over F and transcendental
over F.
Next, we proved Kronecker’s Theorem which says that for a ﬁeld F, if f ∈F[x], then
there exists an extension ﬁeld of F that contains a root of f.
Finally, we deﬁned the characteristic of a ﬁeld and showed that all ﬁelds have charac-
teristic 0, or p, where p is a positive prime integer.

Use Theorem 41.1 to construct an extension ﬁeld E of Z3 in which f has a root. Now
the root is a coset, while E is a ﬁeld. Thus the root must have a multiplicative inverse.
Compute its multiplicative inverse, expressed as a coset.

Chapter 42
Algebraic Field Extensions
In this chapter we give a nicer description for certain ﬁeld extensions. This will in particular
allow us to exhibit some new ﬁnite ﬁelds. We will focus our attention on ﬁeld extensions in
which the additional elements are algebraic over the base ﬁeld.
42.1
The Minimal Polynomial for an Element
As we’ve seen, R is an extension ﬁeld of Q and
√
2 ∈R is algebraic over Q because
√
2
is a root of x2 −2 ∈Q[x]. Of course,
√
2 is a root of many other polynomials in Q[x]; for
instance, 3x2 −6, (x2 −2)(x + 1), and (x2 −2)(x5 + 2x −3). But every polynomial listed is
a multiple of the irreducible polynomial x2 −2. This is in fact true in general, as the next
important theorem shows.
Theorem 42.1 If E is an extension ﬁeld of a ﬁeld F and α ∈E is algebraic over F, then
there exists an irreducible polynomial p ∈F[x] such that p(α) = 0. Furthermore, if f ∈F[x]
and f(α) = 0, then p divides f.
Proof:
Because α is algebraic over F, there is at least one polynomial in F[x] with α as
a root. Let p ∈F[x] be a non-zero polynomial of minimal degree such that p(α) = 0. We
claim that p is irreducible in F[x]. For suppose that p = tq, where t and q are polynomials
in F[x] with degree at least one. Then 0 = p(α) = t(α)q(α), and so α would be a root of
at least one of t and q. Let’s assume t(α) = 0. But p is of minimal degree among those
polynomials with α as a root. Hence, deg(t) = deg(p), and so q is a constant polynomial,
as required.
It remains to show that p divides every polynomial f ∈F[x], where f(α) = 0. By the
Division Theorem we can write f = pq + r where q, r ∈F[x] and deg(r) < deg(p). But
0 = f(α) = p(α)q(α) + r(α) = 0q(α) + r(α) = r(α).
Therefore, α is a root of r. But because deg(r) < deg(p) and p was of minimal degree among
those polynomials with α as a root, r must be the zero polynomial. Thus, p divides f.
2
Note that the above proof shows that the irreducible polynomial in F[x] with α as a
root is unique up to a constant multiple. So, there exists a unique monic polynomial in F[x]
that is irreducible with α as a root. (Recall that a monic polynomial is one whose leading
coeﬃcient is 1.) We call this polynomial the minimal polynomial of α over F, and the
degree of this polynomial the degree of α over F.
Example 42.1
The minimal polynomial for
√
2 over Q is x2 −2. Thus,
√
2 is of degree 2 over Q.
423

424
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 42.2
The minimal polynomial for i over R is x2 + 1. Thus, i is of degree 2 over R. (The
same can be said if R is replaced by Q, because x2 + 1 ∈Q[x].)
Example 42.3
The minimal polynomial for
3√
2 over Q is x3 −2. Thus,
3√
2 is of degree 3 over Q.
Example 42.4
We claim that
p
2 +
√
2 has minimal polynomial x4 −4x2 + 2 over Q and so is of
degree 4 over Q.
 Quick Exercise.
Check that
p
2 +
√
2 is indeed a root of x4 −4x2 + 2.

But x4 −4x2 + 2 is clearly irreducible over Z[x], by Eisenstein’s criterion 5.7, and so
is irreducible over Q[x], by Gauss’s Lemma 5.5.
42.2
Simple Extensions
Suppose E is an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld F and α ∈E. We wish to obtain the smallest
subﬁeld of E that contains both α and all the elements of F. To do this, we consider the set
of all such subﬁelds of E. There is at least one such subﬁeld—namely, E itself; there may
be inﬁnitely many others. We now consider
F(α) = ∩{ﬁelds K : F ⊆K ⊆E, α ∈K}.
This set clearly contains the elements of F and also α. But is it a subﬁeld? To show that
this set is closed under subtraction, choose a, b ∈F(α). Then a, b ∈K, for each of the
subﬁelds K containing F and α. But then because K is a subﬁeld, a −b ∈K, for every
such K. Thus, a −b must be an element of the intersection of all such K.
 Quick Exercise.
The rest of the proof that F(α) is a subﬁeld follows the same lines;
complete this proof. Note that this argument is essentially the same as that for Exercise
41.8. 
Because F(α) is contained in all subﬁelds of E that contain both F and α, it is certainly
the smallest such subﬁeld. If E = F(α), we then say E is a simple extension of F. If α is
algebraic over F, we say that F(α) is an algebraic simple extension of F.
Example 42.5
One example of an algebraic simple extension we’ve seen before is Q(
√
2) = {a+b
√
2 :
a, b ∈Q}. In Section 37.1 we argued directly that every element of this ﬁeld belongs
to any subﬁeld of C that contains the rational numbers and
√
2; furthermore, the set
of such elements forms a ﬁeld. This was a more concrete way of seeing that this ﬁeld
is the smallest ﬁeld extension of Q containing
√
2.

Chapter 42: Algebraic Field Extensions
425
In the previous example we have an explicit description of the elements of a simple
extension; of course, this explicit description depended on knowing the speciﬁc arithmetic
properties of
√
2. Our goal now is to ﬁnd such a description for the general algebraic simple
extension F(α) of a ﬁeld F. We get the answer in the next two theorems. Here, the minimal
polynomial of α over F will provide us with the arithmetic information we need about α.
Theorem 42.2 Let F be a subﬁeld of a ﬁeld E and α an element of E that is algebraic
over F; let p ∈F[x] be the minimal polynomial for α. Then the simple extension F(α) is
isomorphic to the ﬁeld F[x]/⟨p⟩. Consequently, any two algebraic simple extensions of F by
a root of p are isomorphic.
Proof:
Consider the evaluation homomorphism ψ : F[x] →E deﬁned by ψ(f) = f(α).
It is now evident that the image of ψ is contained in F(α). From the proof of Kronecker’s
Theorem 41.1 it is clear that p divides every polynomial in the kernel of ψ; it follows that
the kernel of the homomorphism ψ is exactly ⟨p⟩. The Fundamental Isomorphism Theorem
for Rings 14.1 then tells us that F[x]/⟨p⟩is isomorphic to the image of ψ in F. Because p is
irreducible, F[x]/⟨p⟩is a ﬁeld (Theorems 15.1 and 15.2). The isomorphic image of this ﬁeld
in E contains both F and α. Hence, the image of ψ is exactly F(α), the smallest subﬁeld
of E containing F and α.
Because this is true regardless of the ﬁeld E, this means that any two algebraic simple
extensions of this form are isomorphic to F[x]/⟨p⟩, and hence to each other.
2
Apparently the algebraic simple extension F(α) depends heavily on the nature of the
larger ﬁeld E in which we are doing our computations. However, this is not actually the
case: The theorem (and its proof) asserts that F(α) is entirely determined by F, and by
the minimal polynomial for α.
The previous theorem now allows us to describe the elements of an algebraic simple
extension quite explicitly.
Theorem 42.3 Consider the simple extension F(α) of F where α is algebraic over F. Let
n ≥1 be the degree of α over F. Then every element β of F(α) can be uniquely written as
β = b0 + b1α + b2α2 + · · · + bn−1αn−1,
where bi ∈F.
Proof:
Consider the evaluation homomorphism ψα from F[x] to F(α): If f ∈F[x],
then ψα(f) = f(α). (The previous theorem shows us that this is onto.) So, if f = a0 +
a1x + · · · + amxm, then ψα(f) = a0 + a1α + a2α2 + · · · + amαm, an element of F(α). Let
p = c0+c1x+c2x2+· · ·+xn be the minimal polynomial of α over F. (Recall that the minimal
polynomial is monic.) Because p(α) = 0, we have αn = −c0 −c1α −c2α2 −· · · −cn−1αn−1.
Note that we can use this equation to write every αm for m ≥n in terms of powers of α
less than n. For example,
αn+1
=
ααn = −c0α −c1α2 −· · · −cn−1αn
=
−c0α −c1α2 −· · · −cn−1(−c0 −c1α −· · · −cn−1αn−1).
Higher powers of α are whittled down in this manner. So, every element β of F(α) can be
written
β = b0 + b1α + b2α2 + · · · + bn−1αn−1.
We need only show that this expression is unique. So, suppose
β = b0 + b1α + · · · + bn−1αn−1 = d0 + d1α + · · · + dn−1αn−1

426
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
for bi, di ∈F. Consider the polynomial
f = (b0 −d0) + (b1 −d1)x + · · · + (bn−1 −dn−1)xn−1.
Then f ∈F[x] and f(α) = 0. Furthermore, the degree of f is less than the degree of p. But
we know that p is of minimal degree among those polynomials with α as a root. Thus, f
must be the zero polynomial. In other words, bi = di for i = 0, 1, . . . , n −1, as desired.
2
Example 42.6
Consider the real number α =
√
2 +
3√
2. It turns out that this element has degree 6
over Q, with minimal polynomial x6 −6x4 −4x3 + 12x2 −24x −4. (See Exercise 3 and
also Exercise 38.2.) This means that
Q(α) = {b0 + b1α + b2α2 + b3α3 + b4α4 + b5α5 ∈R : bi ∈Q}.
That is, every element of Q(α) can be expressed as a ﬁfth-degree (or smaller) polyno-
mial from Q[x], evaluated at α.
But consider the real number
1
α. This is obviously an element of the ﬁeld Q(α),
and so we must be able to express it in terms of a ﬁfth degree polynomial evaluated
at α. But we know that α6 −6α4 −4α3 + 12α2 −24α = 4. If we divide by α, we then
have that
4
α = −24 + 12α −4α2 −6α3 + α5.
Division by the integer 4 gives us the required expression for 1
α. In Exercise 5 you will
do some more computations of this sort in this ﬁeld.
Example 42.7
Let’s return to Example 41.5: The polynomial p = x2 + x + 1 is irreducible in Z2[x].
Kronecker’s Theorem 41.1 says that there is an extension ﬁeld E of Z2 that contains a
root α of p. But p is degree 2, and so Theorem 42.3 says that Z2(α) = {a + bα : a, b ∈
Z2}. That is,
Z2(α) = {0 + 0α, 0 + 1α, 1 + 0α, 1 + 1α}.
Thus, Z2(α) is a ﬁeld with four elements—something we have not seen before (unless
you did Exercise 8.15). It is easy to give the addition and multiplication tables for this
ﬁeld. The critical fact when computing these tables is that α2 + α + 1 = 0. We leave
the actual computations as Exercise 1.
Example 42.8
As another example, we return to R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩, a ﬁeld extension of R that contains
a root for x2 + 1. Speciﬁcally, the root is the coset α = ⟨x2 + 1⟩+ x. Then
R(α) = R[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩
and
R(α) = {a + bα : a, b ∈R},
where α2 + 1 = 0. Of course,
C = {a + bi : a, b ∈R},
where i2+1 = 0. It is easy to show that these two ﬁelds are isomorphic via the function
ϕ : R(α) →C given by ϕ(a + bα) = a + bi. (This is because α and i play the same
roles in their respective ﬁelds. Speciﬁcally, α2 = −1 and i2 = −1.)

Example 42.9
Consider the irreducible polynomial x3 −2 ∈Q[x]. This polynomial has three distinct
roots in C, namely
3√
2,
3√
2ζ,
3√
2ζ2, where
ζ = e

is the primitive cube root of unity (see Exercise 10.25).
 Quick Exercise.
Verify that ζ and ζ2 are cube roots of 1, and so the three given
numbers are in fact roots of x3 −2. 
Now consider the three simple extensions
Q(
3√
2),
Q(
3√
2ζ),
Q(
3√
2ζ2)
of Q. According to Theorem 42.2, all three of these ﬁelds are isomorphic, even though
the ﬁrst is a subﬁeld of the real numbers R, while the latter two ﬁelds obviously include
complex numbers.
It is clear that
3√
2ζ,
3√
2ζ2 /∈Q(
3√
2), but we claim that it is also the case that
3√
2 /∈Q(
3√
2ζ). If it were, then by Theorem 42.3,
3√
2 = a + b(
3√
2ζ) + c(
3√
2ζ)2,
for some rational numbers a, b, c. By setting real and imaginary parts of this equation
equal, we obtain
3√
2 = a −1
2
3√
2b −1
2
3√
4c
and
0 =
√
3
2
3√
2b −
√
3
2
3√
4c.
The second equation implies that b = c = 0, because otherwise we could infer that
3√
2 is rational. But then the ﬁrst equation implies that
3√
2 is rational. By similar
arguments, you can check (see Exercise 9) that none of the three simple extensions
Q(
3√
2), Q(
3√
2ζ), Q(
3√
2ζ2)
of Q contain either of the other two roots for x3 −2.
Let’s actually ﬁnd an explicit isomorphism ϕ between Q(
3√
2) and Q(
3√
2ζ). Since
1 must be sent to 1, it is easy to see that ϕ(q) = q for all rational numbers q. Now if
α is a root of x3 −2, then α3 −2 = 0, and so ϕ(α)3 −ϕ(2) = ϕ(0), or in other words,
ϕ(α) must also be a root of x3 −2. But because we have argued that
3√
2ζ is the only
root of x3 −2 belonging to Q(
3√
2ζ), it then follows that ϕ(
3√
2) =
3√
2ζ. Thus, the
isomorphism is easily described in terms of the unique representation of Theorem 42.3
as follows: Suppose that β = a+b
3√
2+c(
3√
2)2 is an arbitrary element of Q(
3√
2); then
ϕ(β) = a + b
3√
2ζ + c(
3√
2ζ)2.
In Chapters 44 and 46 we will return to this example and examine this isomorphism
(and others), from a more sophisticated point of view.
42.3
Simple Transcendental Extensions
Notice that Theorem 42.3 describing simple extensions applies only to algebraic extensions.
To see how nice this description is, let’s examine a transcendental simple extension:

428
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 42.10
Consider the simple extension Q(π) of Q by the transcendental element π. The general
intersection argument we gave above for obtaining the simple extension still applies
in this case, and so we do have the smallest subﬁeld Q(π) of R, which contains the
rational numbers and the transcendental π as well. Thus, such real numbers as
1
π
and
1/2 + 3π2
2 + 3π + (5/4)π2
must belong to this ﬁeld because they are obtained just by ﬁeld operations. But in this
case we cannot express such elements as a rational polynomial in π. Indeed,
Q(π) =
f(π)
g(π) ∈R : f, g ∈Q[x], g ̸= 0

.
In Exercise 6 you will prove that this set of real numbers is actually a ﬁeld and conse-
quently is the simple extension required.
For our purposes, algebraic simple extensions are much more important than transcen-
dental ones, which is fortunate, considering how much nicer our description is in the alge-
braic case.
42.4
Dimension of Algebraic Simple Extensions
Notice that the description of the elements of algebraic simple extensions in Theorem 42.3
has a distinctive vector space ﬂavor. Indeed, the theorem says that when the algebraic
simple extension F(α) is viewed as a vector space over F, the set
{1, α, α2, . . . , αn−1}
is a basis for this vector space. Let us restate this important fact: If the degree of the
algebraic element α over a ﬁeld F is n, then n is the dimension of F(α) as a vector space
over F.
Example 42.11
We now rephrase Example 42.6: Q(
3√
2 +
√
2) is a vector space of dimension 6 over Q.
A basis consists of
1,
3√
2 +
√
2, (
3√
2 +
√
2)2, · · · , (
3√
2 +
√
2)5.
Example 42.12
The ﬁeld with four elements described in Example 42.7 is a vector space of dimension
2 over Z2. A basis consists of 1 and α.
The following is an interesting corollary to the fact just stated.
Corollary 42.4 If α is algebraic over F and F(α) has dimension n over F and β ∈F(α),
then β is also algebraic over F. Furthermore, the degree of β over F is at most n.

Chapter 42: Algebraic Field Extensions
429
Proof:
Because F(α) has dimension n over F, any collection of more than n elements of
F(α) is linearly dependent (Corollary 40.6). Speciﬁcally, consider the n + 1 elements
1, β, β2, . . . , βn.
Because this set is linearly dependent, there exist b0, b1, . . . , bn ∈F, such that
b0 + b1β + b2β2 + · · · + bnβn = 0.
That is, β is a root of the polynomial b0 + b1x + b2x2 + · · · + bnxn ∈F[x]. So, β is algebraic
over F of degree no more than n.
2
To rephrase: Every element of an algebraic simple extension is algebraic over the base
ﬁeld.
What about transcendental simple extensions? The reason we have no nice element-wise
description for such a ﬁeld is exactly this: The vector space dimension of such a ﬁeld over
its base ﬁeld is inﬁnite! You will prove this fact in Exercise 8.
Chapter Summary
For an element that is algebraic over a ﬁeld we deﬁned the minimal polynomial for that
element over the ﬁeld. The degree of this polynomial is the degree of the element over the
ﬁeld. We showed that such a polynomial always exists.
We also examined simple extensions and showed that in the case of a simple extension
of a ﬁeld by an algebraic element, the extension is in fact a vector space over the base ﬁeld
with dimension equal to the degree of the element. We showed this by explicitly displaying
a basis for this vector space. Using this theorem, we were then able to construct a ﬁeld with
four elements.

Chapter 43
Finite Extensions and Constructibility
Revisited
In the last chapter we obtained a good description for a simple extension of a ﬁeld by an
algebraic element. Speciﬁcally, if α is algebraic over F, we showed that F(α) is a vector
space over F with dimension equal to the degree of α over F. Furthermore, every element
of F(α) is algebraic over F. In this chapter we are interested in ﬁeld extensions that are
not necessarily simple, but in which every element is algebraic. We’ll then use our further
results to provide more elegant proofs of the impossibility of two of the classical construction
problems of the ancient Greeks.
43.1
Finite Extensions
We say that a ﬁeld extension E of a ﬁeld F is an algebraic extension if every element of
E is algebraic over F. That is, every element of E is a root of some polynomial in F[x]. We
proved in the last chapter that every element of a simple extension by an algebraic element
is in fact an algebraic element itself; using this new terminology, this means that every such
extension is algebraic.
We say E is a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld F if it has ﬁnite dimension as a vector space
over F. We shall use [E : F] to stand for the dimension of E over F, also called the degree
of E over F.
Example 43.1
We know that Q(
3√
3) is a ﬁnite extension of Q and [Q(
3√
3) : Q] = 3. Likewise, C is a
ﬁnite extension of R, and [C : R] = 2.
We showed in the last chapter that any simple extension by an algebraic element is a
ﬁnite extension (Section 42.4). The following theorem asserts that every ﬁnite extension is
algebraic; its proof uses an argument similar to that we used in Corollary 42.4 when we
proved that elements of algebraic simple extensions are algebraic.
Theorem 43.1 A ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld is an algebraic extension.
Proof:
Suppose that E is a ﬁnite extension of F and [E : F] = n. Let α ∈E. Then the
n + 1 elements
1, α, α2, . . . , αn
cannot be linearly independent, by Corollary 40.6. Therefore, there exist
a0, a1, . . . , an ∈F
433

such that
a0 + a1α + a2α2 + · · · + anαn = 0.
In other words, α is a root of the polynomial a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn in F[x].

What about the converse of this theorem? In Exercise 5 you will explore an example of
a ﬁeld extension that is algebraic but not ﬁnite, thus showing that the converse is false.
The next theorem is the most important result of this chapter; it is this theorem that
will make our new approach to the constructibility problems quite easy. It is a counting
theorem, relating the dimensions of ﬁeld extensions to one another. Counting theorems are
always important. Despite the theorem’s importance, its proof is easy. In fact, before reading
the proof, you might attempt it yourself.
Theorem 43.2 If K is a ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld E and E is a ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld
F, then K is a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld F. Furthermore,
[K : F] = [K : E][E : F].
Proof:
Let {αi : i = 1, . . . , n} be a basis for E over F and {βj : j = 1, . . . , m} be a basis
for K over E. We will show that
{αiβj : i = 1, . . . , n, j = 1, . . . , m}
is a basis for K over F. Note that there are mn distinct elements in this set.
First, we show that the mn elements αiβj span K. Accordingly, let k ∈K. Because the
βj span K as a vector space over E, there exist elements a1, . . . , am of E such that
k =
m
X
j=1
ajβj.
Likewise, because the αi span E as a vector space over F, for each aj there exist elements
b1j, . . . , bnj of F such that
aj =
n
X
i=1
bijαi.
Substituting these into the sum for k, we get
k =
m
X
j=1
 n
X
i=1
bijαi
!
βj =
X
i,j
bij(αiβj).
Thus, the mn elements αiβj span K. (This argument is really a repeat of Exercise 40.15.)
We now show that the αiβj are linearly independent. So, suppose that
X
i,j
cij(αiβj) = 0,
cij ∈F.
We will show that cij = 0 for all i and j. But,
0 =
X
i,j
cij(αiβj) =

βj.
The βj form a basis for K over E; therefore,

for each j. But the αi form a basis for E over F, so cij = 0 for each i and j. Thus, the mn
elements αiβj are linearly independent, and so form a basis for K as a vector space over F.

A rough paraphrase of this theorem is this: A ﬁnite extension of a ﬁnite extension is a
ﬁnite extension. Notice that we have explicitly constructed a basis for K over F from the
bases given for K over E and E over F. We will explore some speciﬁc examples of this
procedure below. The theorem is pictured in the following diagram:

Before looking at examples, we will sharpen our result for the case of simple algebraic
extensions. Suppose that E is an extension ﬁeld of F and α ∈E is algebraic over F. Let
β ∈F(α). Thus, F(β) ⊆F(α). We have seen from Corollary 42.4 that β is algebraic over
F, and so it follows from the last theorem that [F(β) : F] must divide [F(α) : F]. That is,
the degree of β over F must divide the degree of α over F. We restate this in the following
corollary.
Corollary 43.3 Suppose E is an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld F and α ∈E is algebraic over
F. If β ∈F(α), then the degree of β over F divides the degree of α over F.
We now illustrate the theorem with a couple of examples.
Example 43.2
Consider Q(
√
2,
√
3), the smallest subﬁeld of R containing Q,
√
2, and
√
3, as a vector
space over Q. Now,
√
3 /∈Q(
√
2) (see Exercise 1 or Example 37.2), and so x2 −3 is
the minimal polynomial for
√
3 over Q(
√
2). Therefore, [Q(
√
2,
√
3) : Q(
√
2)] = 2 and
{1,
√
3} is a basis for Q(
√
2,
√
3) over Q(
√
2). Because [Q(
√
2) : Q] = 2 and {1,
√
2}
is a basis for Q(
√
2) over Q, we have that [Q(
√
2,
√
3) : Q] = 4 and {1,
√
2,
√
3,
√
6}
is a basis for Q(
√
2,
√
3) over Q. Notice that here we are thinking of Q(
√
2,
√
3) as a
simple extension of Q(
√
2), which in turn is a simple extension of Q.
Alternatively, we could think of Q(
√
2,
√
3) as an extension of Q(
√
3). Then,
[Q(
√
2,
√
3) : Q(
√
3)] = 2 and [Q(
√
3) : Q] = 2. These are two ways of stepping
up from Q to Q(
√
2,
√
3): First, we adjoin
√
2 to Q and then adjoin
√
3, or ﬁrst adjoin
√
3 to Q and then adjoin
√

Example 43.3
Now consider Q(
√
2,
3√
2). Because [Q(
3√
2) : Q] = 3 and [Q(
√
2) : Q] = 2, it follows
from Corollary 43.3 that
3√
2 /∈Q(
√
2). Thus, [Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q(
√
2)] = 3. So,
[Q(

2,
3√
2) : Q] = [Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q(
√
2)][Q(
√
2) : Q] = 3 · 2 = 6.
Again, we could build Q(
√
2,
3√
2) another way. Because
√
2 /∈Q(
3√
2) (from Corol-
lary 43.3), we have that [Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q(
3√
2)] = 2, and so
[Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q] = [Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q(
3√
2)][Q(

But now consider the simple algebraic extension Q(α), where α =
√
2 +
3√
2. It is
evident that α ∈Q(
√
2,
3√
2), and so Q(α) ⊆Q(
√
2,
3√
2); we claim that this last ﬁeld
extension is trivial. In Exercise 42.3 we suggested that Q(α) is of degree 6 over Q, by
providing a monic polynomial in Q[x] with α as a root. So by the theorem, we have
that [Q(
√
2,
3√
2) : Q(α)] = 1, as we require.
But let’s prove that Q(
√
2,
3√
2) = Q(α), without making use of Exercise 42.3. We
know that
3√
2 = α −
√
2. Cubing both sides of this equation gives
2 = α3 −3

2α2 + 6α −2

2.
Solving this equation for
√
2 gives us
√
2 = α3 + 6α −2

.

But this means that
√
2 ∈Q(α); but then
3√
2 = α −
√
2 ∈Q(α) too, and so
Q(
√
2,
3√
2) ⊆Q(α). Because we’ve already noted the reverse inclusion, we have proved
again that Q(α) = Q(
√
2,
3√
2). This means of course that the minimal polynomial for
α must be of degree 6.
Note furthermore that the ﬁnite extension Q(
√
2,
3√
2) over Q is actually simple.
It turns out that all ﬁnite extensions over the rational ﬁeld are simple; we will prove
this important fact in Theorem 44.5.
The calculations carried out above can be taken one step further to get the minimal
polynomial for α over Q. If you square both sides of the equation we have for
√
2 above,
then a bit of algebra yields the polynomial for which α is a root. (See Exercise 11.)
It is clear that an induction argument extends Theorem 43.2 to any number of steps.
For completeness, we include this as a corollary. (The proof of this is left as Exercise 2.)
Corollary 43.4 If Fi, i = 1, . . . , n are ﬁelds with Fi+1 a ﬁnite extension of Fi, for i =
1, . . . , n −1, then Fn is a ﬁnite extension of F1 and
[Fn : F1] = [Fn : Fn−1][Fn−1 : Fn−2] · · · [F2 : F1].

43.2
Constructibility Problems
Let’s start by recalling the three Greek construction problems: doubling the cube, trisecting
an arbitrary angle, and squaring the circle. The proofs that these constructions are impos-
sible depend in an essential way on the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3, which we
re-state here:
Constructible Number Theorem
The number α is constructible if and only if there
exists a ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds
Q = F0 ⊂F1 ⊂· · · ⊂FN,
with α ∈FN and Fi+1 = Fi(√ki) for some ki ∈Fi, with ki > 0 for i = 0, . . . , N −1.
Let’s re-consider this theorem, in light of our theory of ﬁeld extensions. We now know
that the degree of each of the extensions in the Constructible Number Theorem is 2. Thus,
[FN : Q] must be a power of 2. Now clearly the extension Q(α) ⊆FN, and so by Theorem
43.2, we must have that [Q(α) : Q] is also a power of 2. We thus obtain the following
corollary of the Constructible Number Theorem:
Corollary 43.5 If a number α is constructible, then [Q(α) : Q] = 2n, for some positive
integer n.
Note that the converse to this corollary is false; [Q(i) : Q] = 2 is a counterexample,
because constructible numbers are necessarily real. But the converse is also false for real
numbers. In Exercise 48.7 we will present an irreducible fourth degree polynomial in Q[x]
with a real root α that is not constructible, even though [Q(α) : Q] = 4.
Let’s now return to the impossibility proofs of the construction problems. Recall that
to double the cube, we are to construct an edge of a cube whose volume is twice that of a
given cube. (Actually, we are given the edge of the original cube.) If we consider the edge of
the original cube to be length 1, then we are required to construct a line segment of length
3√
2. But [Q(
3√
2) : Q] = 3, and so Corollary 43.5 tells us that
3√
2 is not constructible. Thus,
it is impossible to double the cube with only a compass and straightedge.
In our impossibility proof for the trisection problem, we showed that it is in fact impos-
sible to trisect a 60◦angle. If we could do so, we could construct an angle of 20◦which in
turn implies the construction of a root of the polynomial x3 −3x −1, which is irreducible
in Q[x]. But any root of this polynomial has degree 3 over Q; once again, Corollary 43.5
shows that this is not constructible.
We are not able to use the theory of this chapter to more easily prove the impossibility
of squaring the circle, because this problem involves considering the transcendental simple
extension Q(√π). We must still rely on Lindemann’s diﬃcult Theorem 38.5 asserting that
π is transcendental over Q.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we showed that every ﬁnite extension is an algebraic extension. If K is a
ﬁnite extension of E, which is a ﬁnite extension of F, then K is a ﬁnite extension of F with
[K : F] = [K : E][E : F].
We then used this theorem to give alternate proofs for the impossibility of doubling the
cube and trisecting an arbitrary angle.

Section IX in a Nutshell
This section presents some more sophisticated mathematical ideas that allow us to prove
more elegantly the impossibility of the constructibility problems of the previous section.
This more powerful approach to ﬁeld theory is interesting in its own right and also plays a
vital role in Section X.
First, we deﬁne a vector space V over a ﬁeld F. This is a set of objects (called vectors)
equipped with a binary operation called addition, making the set an additive group. In
addition a vector space has a scalar multiplication whereby vectors are multipied by elements
(scalars) from the ﬁeld F. The complete set of axioms follows, where v, w, u ∈V , and
r, s ∈F:
1. v + w = w + v,
2. v + (w + u) = (v + w) + u,
3. there exists a zero vector 0, with the property that v + 0 = v, and
4. every vector v has an additive inverse −v, with the property that v + (−v) = 0.
5. (r + s)v = rv + sv,
6. (rs)v = r(sv),
7. r(v + w) = rv + rw, and
8. 1v = v.
Classic examples of vector spaces are the set F n of n-tuples from the ﬁeld F, and the
polynomial ring F[x]. If F and E are ﬁelds and F ⊆E, then the ﬁeld E is actually a vector
space over F. (In this case we say E is an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld F.) This eventually
allows us to apply vector space theory to ﬁeld theory.
A basis for a vector space V is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans V . The
number of vectors in a basis is the dimension of the vector space. (See Theorem 40.4.) Thus
F n has dimension n and F[x] has inﬁnite dimension over F. If B is a basis for vector space
V then every element of V can be uniquely written as a linear combination of elements in
B (Theorem 40.2). Every spanning set contains a subset that is a basis (Theorem 40.3).
Kronecker’s Theorem 41.1 says that if F is a ﬁeld and f ∈F[x] of degree at least 1, we
can always construct an extension ﬁeld E of F such that f(α) = 0 for some α ∈E. The
proof of this theorem reveals that F[x]/⟨p⟩is the desired ﬁeld, where p is an irreducible
factor of f in F[x].
If E is an extension ﬁeld of F and α ∈E is a root of a polynomial in F[x], then α is
algebraic over F. The smallest subﬁeld F(α) of E containing F and α is essentially unique,
and isomorphic to the ﬁeld F[x]/⟨p⟩, where p is an irreducible polynomial p ∈F[x] with
p(α) = 0 (Theorem 42.2). Then p divides all f ∈F[x] where f(α) = 0 (Theorem 42.1), and
if we further require that p be monic, it is unique and called the minimal polynomial of α
over F.
Fields of the form F(α), are called simple extensions of F. If α happens to be algebraic
over F, then F(α) is called an algebraic simple extension of F. Furthermore, if deg(p) = n,
then F(α) is a vector space over F of dimension n with basis {1, α, α2, . . . , αn−1}. It follows
that every element in F(α) is algebraic over F (Corollary 42.4).
If E is an extension ﬁeld of F and has ﬁnite dimension as a vector space over F, we call
E a ﬁnite extension of F and denote the degree of the extension by [E : F]. Every ﬁnite
440

extension is algebraic (Theorem 43.1). Degrees multiply: If F1 ⊆F2 ⊆F3 form a sequence
of ﬁnite extensions, then [F3 : F1] = [F3 : F2][F2 : F1]. This extends to any ﬁnite sequence of
ﬁnite extensions. If E is an extension ﬁeld of F and α ∈E is algebraic over F and β ∈F(α),
then the degree of β over F divides the degree of α over F (Corollary 43.3).
It follows from the Constructible Number Theorem that if α is constructible, then [Q(α) :
Q] = 2n. This allows us to show that it is impossible to double the cube (because [Q(
3√
2) :
Q] = 3), it is impossible to trisect a 60◦angle (because to do so means we could construct a
root of x3 −3x −1, which is irreducible in Q[x] of degree 3), and it is impossible to square
the circle (because Q(√π) is a transcendental simple extension of Q).

Chapter 44
The Splitting Field
We are all familiar with the way in which the quadratic formula gives us an explicit formula
for the roots of any degree two polynomial in Q[x] (and, this formula works in C[x] too –
see Exercises 10.1 and 10.2). In Exercises 10.12–10.19, you can explore the cubic formula
that performs the same task as the quadratic formula; it is a good bit more complicated.
In the case of the quadratic formula, we need to perform the ﬁeld operations from Q, and
in addition extract a square root. In the case of the cubic formula, we need to perform the
ﬁeld operations from Q, extract cube roots, and also have to extract one or more square
roots. Can this process be extended to higher and higher degree polynomials from Q[x]? The
answer for quartic (that is, fourth degree) equations is yes; it is a nightmare of a formula,
which involves not only the extraction of a fourth root, but also cube and square roots as
well. In essence, the cubic problem reduces ﬁnally to a quadratic, and the quartic in turn
ﬁnally reduces to a cubic! You can explore the quartic formula in Exercise 10.20.
It seems natural to suppose that this project could be carried on indeﬁnitely (at the
cost of more and more complicated calculations), to obtain formulas solving ﬁfth, sixth
and higher degree polynomial equations over C. This supposition is false: It was one of the
triumphs of nineteenth century abstract algebra to prove that such formulas for degree 5
and higher are impossible. This result can and should be compared to the results we have
encountered in Chapters 38 and 43, showing that the classical construction problems are
impossible.
In order to prove the impossibility of solving all polynomial equations by radicals, we
will need some more ﬁeld theory, which we will begin exploring in this chapter. To complete
our project, we will eventually make use of the group theory we encountered in Chapter 30.
The exciting interplay between groups and ﬁelds makes this subject an outstanding example
of the power of abstract algebra.
44.1
The Splitting Field
In Chapter 41 we encountered Kronecker’s Theorem 41.1: Given a ﬁeld F and a non-constant
polynomial f ∈F[x], we can always build a (potentially) bigger ﬁeld than F in which f
has at least one root. By an easy inductive argument (Exercise 41.1) on the degree of f, we
can then build a (potentially) larger ﬁeld than F, in which f can be completely factored
into linear polynomials; such a ﬁeld is called a splitting extension over F for f. In this
chapter we will show that this can be done minimally in essentially only one way.
We make a deﬁnition to capture this idea. Suppose that F is a ﬁeld and f ∈F[x], with
deg(f) > 0. Then the ﬁeld K is a splitting ﬁeld for f over F, if F ⊆K, f factors into
linear polynomials in K[x], and if L is any other ﬁeld with F ⊆L ⊂K, then f cannot
be factored into linear polynomials in L[x]. Any ﬁeld containing K is a splitting extension
445

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
of f over F. The splitting ﬁeld of f over F is a minimal splitting extension. When the
polynomial f does factor into linear polynomials in a ﬁeld K, we say f splits in K.
Example 44.1
If the polynomial f ∈F[x] can already be factored into linear polynomials in F[x],
then F itself is a splitting ﬁeld for f.
Example 44.2
The ﬁeld C is a splitting ﬁeld for the polynomial x2 + 1 ∈R[x] over R.
Example 44.3
Let f ∈Q[x] be any quadratic polynomial that is irreducible in Q[x], and α ∈C be
a root of f given by the quadratic formula. Then the quadratic extension Q(α) is a
splitting ﬁeld for f over Q. This is true because the second root for f in C is the
complex conjugate ¯α, and ¯α ∈Q(α).
 Quick Exercise.
Why is ¯α ∈Q(α)?

certainly contains a root for f, namely

where α = ⟨f⟩+ x. This is a splitting ﬁeld for f, because
f = (x + α)
 x + α2  x + α + α2
.
You will check this factorization in Exercise 44.1 and also show that
Z2(α) = Z2(α2) = Z2(α + α2).
We will now prove that a non-constant polynomial over a ﬁeld always has a splitting
ﬁeld; furthermore, such a ﬁeld is unique (up to isomorphism, of course). We will prove
existence (and more) in Theorem 44.1 and uniqueness in Theorem 44.2.
Theorem 44.1 Let F be a ﬁeld and f ∈F[x] a non-constant polynomial. Then there exists
a splitting ﬁeld K for f over F. Furthermore, if the linear factorization of f in K[x] is given
by
f = β(x −α1)(x −α2) · · · (x −αn),
Then K is equal to the ﬁnite extension F(α1, α2, · · · , αn).

Chapter 44: The Splitting Field
447
Proof:
Let F be a ﬁeld and f ∈F[x] a non-constant polynomial. We know by Exercise
41.1 that we can construct a splitting extension M of F for f. Now consider the ﬁnite ﬁeld
extension K = F(α1, α2, · · · , αn), where the elements αi are the roots of f in M. It is then
evident that K is a splitting extension of F for f. But if L is any other splitting extension
of F contained in M, then L must contain the roots of f, and so must contain K. This
means that K is minimal among such extensions, and so is a splitting ﬁeld.
2
We now prove that splitting ﬁelds are unique, up to isomorphism. The following theorem
carefully sets up what we mean by this uniqueness:
Theorem 44.2 Suppose that F is a ﬁeld and f ∈F[x] is a non-constant polynomial.
Suppose that K and K are two splitting ﬁelds of F for f. Then there exists an isomorphism
ϕ : K →K that leaves F ﬁxed.
Proof:
Assume that F, f, K, and K are as in the hypotheses of the theorem. We know
from Theorem 44.1 that K = F(α1, α2, α3, · · · , αn), where the αi are the (not necessarily
distinct) roots of f in K. Furthermore, K = F(β1, β2, · · · , βn), where the βi are the (not
necessarily distinct) roots of f in K. We will proceed by induction on the degree n. To
facilitate this, deﬁne the ﬁelds Kk inductively, by letting K0 = F, and Kk+1 = Kk(αk+1).
We will deﬁne the ﬁelds Kk in the same manner; we will let K0 = F and deﬁne the
subﬁelds of K at each inductive step, by reordering the roots β1, · · · , βn, which we will
describe below. We will extend the ﬁeld isomorphism ϕ from each of the extension ﬁelds
Kk onto the extension ﬁelds Kk, one step at a time.
We start with ϕ : K0 →K0 being the identity isomorphism (since K0 = K0 = F). We
now assume by induction that ϕ has in fact been deﬁned and is an isomorphism from Kk
onto Kk. Furthermore, this isomorphism leaves F ﬁxed and has been constructed so that
ϕ(αi) = βi, for i = 1, 2, · · · , k.
Now consider the root αk+1 of the polynomial f ∈F[x] ⊆Kk[x]. If αk+1 ∈Kk, then
f ∈F[x] ⊆Kk[x] must have a root in Kk other than β1, β2, · · · , βk, and, by renumbering,
we may assume that this is the root βk+1. We consequently have ϕ already deﬁned on the
ﬁeld Kk+1 = Kk onto the ﬁeld Kk+1 = Kk.
We thus may assume that the root αk+1 /∈Kk. We then know by Theorem 42.2 that
Kk(αk+1) is isomorphic to the ﬁeld Kk[x]/⟨p⟩, where p is the irreducible factor of f in Kk[x]
for which αk+1 is a root. Now because the ﬁelds Kk and Kk are isomorphic, we know that
the polynomial rings Kk[x] and Kk[x] are isomorphic and there is an irreducible factor p of
f in Kk[x] corresponding to p. (See Exercise 14.17.) Since p divides f in K[x], the roots of
p are also roots of f in K. So choose any root of p in K, which we can (by renumbering) call
βk+1 and let Kk+1 = Kk(βk+1). Then Kk+1 is isomorphic to Kk[x]/⟨p⟩. But by Exercise
14.20, it is clear that Kk[x]/⟨p⟩and Kk[x]/⟨p⟩are isomorphic, and the isomorphism between
them extends the assumed isomorphism for Kk to Kk, and it takes ⟨p⟩+ x to ⟨p⟩+ x. This
means that we have an isomorphism from Kk+1 = Kk(αk+1) to Kk+1 = Kk(βk+1), which
takes αk+1 to βk+1.
Thus, by induction, we have that there is an isomorphism from K to K that extends
the isomorphism ϕ from F to F, as required.

Example 44.6
Suppose that f ∈Q[x] ⊆C[x]. Recall the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 10.1,
which implies that every polynomial with complex coeﬃcients can be factored com-
pletely into linear factors. That is, we have in this case that all of the roots α1, · · · , αn
of f belong to C. Consequently, C contains a splitting ﬁeld for f over Q (that is, C
is a splitting extension for f over Q), and it consists precisely of Q(α1, · · · , αn). By
Theorem 44.2, we know that this is essentially the only splitting ﬁeld.

448
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
The next theorem will give us some insight into just how nice splitting ﬁelds are. It
says that if K is a splitting ﬁeld over F for f and K contains any root for an irreducible
polynomial g ∈F[x], then K will contain all roots for g. That is, g will also split in K[x].
The proof of this theorem relies heavily on the uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds.
Theorem 44.3 Let K be the splitting ﬁeld over the ﬁeld F for the polynomial f. Suppose
that g ∈F[x] is an irreducible polynomial over F and γ ∈K\F is a root for g. Then g
factors completely into linear factors in K[x].
Proof:
Suppose that K is the splitting ﬁeld over the ﬁeld F for the polynomial f. We know
that K = F(α1, α2, · · · , αn), where the αi are the roots of f in K. Consider an irreducible
polynomial g ∈F[x], and suppose that γ ∈K\F with g(γ) = 0. Let’s assume by way of
contradiction that g does not completely factor into linear factors inside K[x]. But then by
Kronecker’s Theorem 41.1 we can construct a strictly larger extension ﬁeld K(β) of K, for
which β is a root of g. Now because γ and β are both roots of the irreducible polynomial g,
we know by Theorem 42.2 that there is an isomorphism between the ﬁelds F(γ) and F(β)
that leaves F ﬁxed. Now K(β) = F(α1, · · · , αn)(β) = F(α1, · · · , αn, β) = F(β)(α1, · · · , αn),
and this is the splitting ﬁeld of f over F(β). But because F(β) and F(γ) are isomorphic,
there is an isomorphism between K(β) and K = K(γ) = F(γ, α1, · · · , αn), since the latter
ﬁeld is the splitting ﬁeld for f over F(γ).
But now we count degrees. By our isomorphism between K and K(β) as splitting ﬁelds
over the isomorphic ﬁelds F(γ) and F(β) we have that [K : F(γ)] = [K(β) : F(γ)]. But
then by Theorem 43.2
[K : F] = [K : F(γ)][F(γ) : F] = [K(β) : F(γ)][F(γ) : F] = [K(β) : F],
and this means that [K(β) : K] = 1, and so β ∈K(β) = K, which is as we wish.
2
Suppose that K is an extension ﬁeld of the ﬁeld F, and that whenever an irreducible
polynomial f ∈F[x] has one root in K, then it splits in K. In this case we say that K is a
normal extension of F. With this terminology, we can rephrase Theorem 44.3 by saying
that if K is a splitting ﬁeld over the ﬁeld F for the polynomial f, then K is in fact a normal
extension. Later in this chapter we will encounter Theorem 44.6, which asserts that for a
ﬁeld with characteristic zero, being a splitting ﬁeld is equivalent to being a ﬁnite normal
extension.
In Chapter 47 we will discover that the concept of normal extension is actually closely
related to the concept of normal subgroup!
44.2
Fields with Characteristic Zero
Theorems 44.1 and 44.2 together say that given any ﬁeld F and a non-constant polynomial
f, we can always build a unique minimal extension ﬁeld, in which f completely factors
into linear factors. So, for any polynomial over a ﬁeld, we obtain the unique (up to isomor-
phism) splitting ﬁeld for the polynomial merely by adjoining the roots of the polynomial,
by repeated application of Kronecker’s Theorem 41.1. In general, some of these roots may
already belong to the base ﬁeld, and some of the roots may be repeated. However, if the
polynomial is irreducible, the situation is particularly nice (for ﬁelds of characteristic zero).
Theorem 44.4 Let F be a ﬁeld of characteristic zero and f an irreducible polynomial in
F[x]. Then the roots of f in its splitting ﬁeld are all distinct.

Chapter 44: The Splitting Field
449
Proof:
Suppose that f has a repeated root α in its splitting ﬁeld K. This means that
f = (x −α)kg, where k is an integer greater than one, and g is a polynomial over K. We
will now make use of the formal derivative of this polynomial. We ﬁrst encountered this
idea in Exercise 4.7 in the polynomial ring Q[x], and in Exercise 3 you will check that the
appropriate results hold, for any ﬁeld (and in fact for any commutative ring). In particular,
the product rule like you encountered in calculus works here, and so the formal derivative
f ′ can be computed thus:
f ′ = k(x −α)k−1g + (x −α)kg′.
Now because K has characteristic zero, this is necessarily a non-zero polynomial. We then
have that x −α is a factor of both f and f ′. But if we use term-by-term diﬀerentiation
instead, it is clear that f ′ ∈F[x]. Since f is irreducible, we know that in F[x] we have
gcd(f, f ′) = 1, and so by the GCD identity for F[x] we can ﬁnd polynomials a, b ∈F[x] for
which 1 = af + bf ′. But if we evaluate this polynomial at α we obtain the following:
1 = 1(α) = a(α)f(α) + b(α)f ′(α) = 0 + 0 = 0,
a contradiction. Thus f must not have any repeated roots in the splitting ﬁeld K.
2
Theorem 44.4 remains true for all ﬁnite ﬁelds, and you will prove this fact in Exercise
45.8. The theorem is false, however, for inﬁnite ﬁelds with characteristic p (although we will
not pursue this topic in this book). We will ﬁnd Theorem 44.4 of considerable use when
we return to the problem of determining when polynomial equations can be solved with
radicals.
We close this section by proving another important result about ﬁelds with characteristic
zero. It is surprisingly the case that for such ﬁelds any ﬁnite extension is simple. Now we
know by Theorem 43.1 that any ﬁnite extension is algebraic. Thus to assert that a ﬁnite
extension is simple, we are really saying that if we adjoin ﬁnitely many algebraic numbers
to a ﬁeld with characteristic zero, we only need to adjoin a single element. In particular,
over such a ﬁeld the splitting ﬁeld is always a simple extension.
Example 44.7
An interesting example of this is Example 43.3, where we rather laboriously proved
that Q(
√
2,
3√
2) is a simple extension Q(α) of Q, where α =
√
2 +
3√
2. As we shall
see in the proof of the theorem, it is no accident that α is a linear combination of the
elements
√
2,
3√
2.
Theorem 44.5 Let F be a ﬁeld with characteristic zero, and K a ﬁnite extension of F.
Then K is an algebraic simple extension of F.
Proof:
Suppose that α and β are algebraic elements over a ﬁeld F, which has characteristic
zero. We will show that F(α, β) = F(µ), for some algebraic element µ. This reduction from
two generators to one is clearly the induction step needed to show that any ﬁnite extension
is simple (see Exercise 4).
Now α and β are roots of irreducible polynomials f, g ∈F[x] of degrees n and m,
respectively. We may as well do all of our computations in a ﬁeld K in which both f and
g split into linear factors. Because F has characteristic zero, Theorem 44.4 tells us that
the roots α = α1, · · · , αn of f in K are all distinct from one another, and that the roots
β = β1, · · · , βm of g in K are also all distinct from one another.

450
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Consider the ﬁnite set of elements in the ﬁeld K:
αj −α
β −βi

,
where i > 1 and j > 1. Since F is of characteristic zero, it is an inﬁnite ﬁeld, and so we can
choose a non-zero element a ∈F not equal to any of these quotients.
We will now deﬁne µ = α + aβ. It is quite evident that F(µ) ⊆F(α, β). We must show
the reverse inclusion is true, by arguing that α, β ∈F(µ). For that purpose, consider the
polynomial h ∈F(µ)[x], deﬁned by h(x) = f(µ −ax). Notice that
h(β) = f(µ −aβ) = f(α) = 0.
Thus h and g share the root β.
However, h and g can share no other root. For if they did, it would be some βi, with
i > 1. But then
0 = h(βi) = f(µ −aβi) = f(α + aβ −aβi).
This would mean that α + a(β −βi) = αj, for some j, and we chose a precisely so that this
cannot be true.
Because g factors into linear factors in K, it is now evident that the gcd of h and g in
K[x] is x −β. But h, g ∈F(µ)[x], and so when we perform Euclid’s algorithm to compute
gcd(h, g), we will remain in the ring F(µ)[x]. This means that x −β ∈F(µ)[x], or in other
words, β ∈F(µ). But because α = µ −aβ, α ∈F(µ), too. Thus, F(α, β) = F(µ).
2
Examples of this theorem appear in Example 43.3, and Exercises 43.3 and 43.4.
We can now use this theorem to show that for ﬁelds of characteristic zero, a ﬁnite
extension is normal exactly if it is the splitting ﬁeld for some irreducible polynomial.
Theorem 44.6 Suppose that F is a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, with ﬁnite extension K.
Then K is the splitting ﬁeld for some irreducible f ∈F[x] if and only if K is a normal
extension of F.
Proof:
Suppose that K is a ﬁnite normal extension of F, a ﬁeld with characteristic zero.
Then by Theorem 44.5 K = F(α), where α is algebraic over F. Let f ∈F[x] be the minimal
polynomial for α. Since K is normal, f splits in K. But clearly no smaller subﬁeld of K
contains all the roots of f, because K = F(α). Thus K is the splitting ﬁeld for f over F.
The converse is just Theorem 44.3.
2
Theorems 46.2 and 47.2 will give other conditions equivalent to being a ﬁnite normal
extension.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we proved that every polynomial over a base ﬁeld admits a unique minimal
ﬁeld extension of that ﬁeld, in which the polynomial factors into linear factors; this is called
its splitting ﬁeld. A splitting ﬁeld for a polynomial actually has the stronger property that
if an irreducible polynomial over the base ﬁeld has even one root in the splitting ﬁeld, it
has all of its roots. We call such ﬁeld extensions normal. We also showed that for a ﬁeld of
characteristic zero, ﬁnite extensions are necessarily simple extensions.

Chapter 45
Finite Fields
In the previous chapter we proved that any irreducible polynomial f over a ﬁeld F has a
unique splitting ﬁeld: A minimal ﬁeld extension of F in which f can be factored into linear
factors. This provides a ﬁeld inside of which we can explore whether or not the roots of f are
obtainable by elementary algebraic operations. We will pursue this goal in the remaining
chapters in this book.
But a wonderful bonus ﬂows from the existence and uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds, and
we will take a small detour from our goal to explore this bonus in the present chapter. We
are now able to completely describe all ﬁnite ﬁelds. We have for a long time been familiar
with the ﬁnite ﬁelds Zp, where p is a prime integer. We have also encountered various ﬁnite
ﬁelds as ﬁnite extensions of such ﬁelds; for example, consider Example 41.5, Exercise 42.2
and Example 44.5. In this chapter we will be able to place these examples in a beautiful
general context.
45.1
Existence and Uniqueness
Theorem 41.2 says that every ﬁeld has characteristic zero or p, where p is a prime integer.
Fields with characteristic zero have a subﬁeld isomorphic to Q and so are inﬁnite. Thus,
any ﬁnite ﬁeld has characteristic p, for some prime p. This means that every ﬁnite ﬁeld
contains (an isomorphic copy of) one of the ﬁelds Zp as a subﬁeld (recall that this is called
the prime subﬁeld). We use these considerations to prove our ﬁrst result about arbitrary
ﬁnite ﬁelds.
Theorem 45.1 A ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p has pn elements, for some positive integer
n.
Proof:
With our knowledge of group theory, this becomes quite an easy theorem. Let
F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld, and consider its additive group structure. Saying that its characteristic
is p means exactly that every non-zero element has (additive) order p. But then Cauchy’s
Theorem 24.5 says that p must be the only prime integer dividing the order of F. That is,
every ﬁnite ﬁeld has pn elements, for some positive integer n. (We’ve seen this proof before,
and we could instead have cited Theorem 28.1 here.)
2
But do such ﬁelds exist, for every prime p, and every positive integer n? The next
theorem says that they do. Here, ﬁeld theory comes to the rescue.
Theorem 45.2 For every prime integer p and every positive integer n, there exists a ﬁeld
with pn elements.
Proof:
Consider the polynomial f = xpn −x ∈Zp[x]. By Theorem 44.1 we know that
there exists a splitting ﬁeld F of Zp for f. Because F is a ﬁeld extension of Zp, it must be
a ﬁeld of characteristic p. We will show that F is exactly the required ﬁeld of pn elements.

A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Pick two roots r, s ∈F of the polynomial f. We claim that r −s is also a root of f. To
check this, we must evaluate f(r −s) = (r −s)pn −(r −s). But in a ﬁeld of characteristic
p, we know that (r −s)pn = rpn −spn (see Exercise 1c). Thus,
f(r −s) = rpn −spn −r + s =

rpn −r

−

spn −s

= 0 −0 = 0,
and so r −s is a root of f, as claimed. That is, the set of roots of f is an (additive) group.
Now pick two roots r, s ∈F of the polynomial f, with s ̸= 0. We claim that rs−1 is also
a root of f. But
f(rs−1) = rpns−pn −rs−1 = rs−1 −rs−1 = 0.
Thus, the set of roots of f actually forms a subﬁeld of F. But because a splitting ﬁeld is
minimal among all ﬁelds containing the roots, F consists exactly of the roots of f.
To show that F contains exactly pn elements, it remains to check that f has no repeated
roots. Pick any root r of f. Then
f(x −r)
=
(x −r)pn −(x −r)
=
xpn −x −(rpn −r) = f(x) −0 = f(x).
Thus,
f = (x −r)((x −r)pn−1 −1).
But clearly x −r is not a factor of (x −r)pn−1 −1 (because x −r does not divide 1). Thus,
r is not a repeated root. Consequently, f has pn roots, and so the set of roots of f is equal
to the splitting ﬁeld F and is the required ﬁeld with pn elements.
2
We shall now use Theorem 44.2 (the uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds) to show that any two
ﬁnite ﬁelds with pn elements are isomorphic:
Theorem 45.3 All ﬁelds with pn elements are isomorphic.
Proof:
Any ﬁnite ﬁeld F with pn elements has characteristic p, and so is a ﬁnite extension
of Zp. Consider again the polynomial f = xpn −x ∈Zp[x]. We will now show that the
elements of F are exactly the distinct roots of f, and so is exactly the splitting ﬁeld of f
over Zp.
We know that the multiplicative group F ∗has pn −1 elements. Now pick a ∈F ∗. By
Lagrange’s Theorem we know that the order of a divides pn −1; thus, apn−1 = 1. But then
apn = a, and so a is a root of xpn −x. Thus, every element of F is a root of xpn −x. The
ﬁeld F has pn elements and xpn −x can have no more than pn roots. Hence, F consists of
exactly those roots.
But then the uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds (Theorem 44.2) means that all ﬁelds with pn
elements are isomorphic.
2
Because the ﬁeld with pn elements is unique (up to isomorphism), we can unambiguously
denote it by GF(pn). This stands for Galois ﬁeld of order pn, after the Frenchman
Evariste Galois who was the ﬁrst mathematician to consider ﬁnite ﬁelds. Of course, GF(p)
is merely a diﬀerent notation for the familiar ﬁeld Zp.
The uniqueness of ﬁnite ﬁelds was proved in 1893 by the American mathematician E.
H. Moore, who was by that time at the University of Chicago. Moore played a crucial
part in bringing American mathematics to the level of European mathematics. He was the
founder of the mathematics department at the University of Chicago and was one of the
founders of the American Mathematical Society. But most important was his work as an
admired mathematician and as a teacher and mentor for the next generation of American
mathematicians.

Examples
Example 45.1
Consider the polynomial x2 + 1 ∈Z3[x]. It is easy to see that this polynomial has no
roots in Z3, by checking the three possibilities 0, 1, and 2. Thus, by the Root Theorem,
x2 + 1 is irreducible, and so the ideal ⟨x2 + 1⟩is maximal (Theorems 15.1 and 15.2).
Thus, Z3[x]/⟨x2 + 1⟩is a ﬁeld. This ﬁeld has degree 2 over Z3 and so has 9 elements.
It is consequently the Galois ﬁeld GF(9). We should really write these elements as
(additive) cosets. For simplicity’s sake, we will replace ⟨x2 + 1⟩+ x by α. With this
convention, the elements of this ﬁeld are
{0, 1, 2, α, α + 1, α + 2, 2α, 2α + 1, 2α + 2},
where the multiplication is determined by the law α2 + 1 = 0; that is, α2 = 2.
Let’s look at the multiplicative structure of this ﬁeld. That is, what sort of group is
GF(9)∗? It is certainly an abelian group with 8 elements, and up to isomorphism there
are three such groups. It turns out that this group is cyclic, and α + 1 is a generator.
Let’s verify this, by brute calculation:
(α + 1)1 = α + 1,
(α + 1)2 = α2 + 2α + 1 = 2α,
(α + 1)3 = 2α(α + 1) = 2α2 + 2α = 2α + 1,
(α + 1)4 = (α + 1)(2α + 1) = 2α2 + 3α + 1 = 2,
(α + 1)5 = 2(α + 1) = 2α + 2,
(α + 1)6 = (α + 1)(2α + 2) = 2α2 + 4α + 2 = α,
(α + 1)7 = (α + 1)α = α2 + α = α + 2,
(α + 1)8 = (α + 1)(α + 2) = α2 + 3α + 2 = 1.
It turns out that the group of units of any ﬁnite ﬁeld is cyclic! This is called the Primitive
Root Theorem:
Theorem 45.4
Primitive Root Theorem
The group of units of any ﬁnite ﬁeld
GF(pn) is cyclic.
Proof:
A freestanding proof of this theorem is diﬃcult, but we can obtain it by using
the Fundamental Theorem for Finite Abelian Groups 29.12 (which we did not prove). Ob-
viously GF(pn)∗is a ﬁnite abelian group, and therefore by the Fundamental Theorem it is
isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of the form
Zk1
q1 × Zk2
q2 × · · · × Zkr
qr
with each qi a prime, and where the primes need not be distinct. Now if all of the primes
qi are distinct, this group is cyclic of order pn −1 = qk1
1 · · · qkr

, by the Chinese Remainder
Theorem 16.1. So we wish to show that there are no repetitions in the primes qi. We
proceed by way of contradiction. We may assume without loss of generality that q1 = q2,
and k1 ≤k2. But then every element in the direct product of cyclic groups has order no
more than m = qk2

But this means that every non-zero element in the ﬁeld GF(pn) is a root of the polynomial
xm −1; that is, this polynomial has pn −1 roots. But by Corollary 4.4 (true for any ﬁeld),
such a polynomial can have at most m roots. Since m < pn −1, this is a contradiction, and
so GF(pn)∗is a cyclic group as claimed.

Example 45.2
We now know that groups Z∗
11 and Z∗
17 are cyclic. You will check this in Exercise 11.
We now consider when ﬁnite ﬁelds are subﬁelds of one another. The following example
will help motivate this:
Example 45.3
In order to construct the ﬁeld GF(8), we need only ﬁnd an irreducible polynomial f
in Z2[x] of degree three; then form Z2[x]/⟨f⟩. We actually performed this calculation
in Example 44.5 (see also Exercise 44.1), using the polynomial f = x3 + x + 1. In
Exercise 9 you will use the polynomial x3 + x2 + 1 instead, and show explicitly that
the resulting ﬁeld is isomorphic to the ﬁeld constructed in Example 44.5.
Now consider the polynomial g = x2 + x + 1 ∈GF(8)[x]. We claim that this is
an irreducible polynomial in GF(8)[x]. To show this, let’s try by brute force to see
whether any of the 8 elements of GF(8) are roots of the polynomial. For example,
g(α2 + α) = (α2 + α)2 + (α2 + α) + 1 =
α4 + α2 + α2 + α + 1 = α4 + α + 1 =
α(α + 1) + α + 1 = α2 + 1 ̸= 0.
Thus, α2 + α is not a root.
 Quick Exercise.
Try the other seven elements of the ﬁeld, and thus see that this
polynomial is irreducible. 
But then we can construct the ﬁeld
GF(8)/⟨x2 + x + 1⟩.
This is a degree 2 extension of GF(8), which has 8 elements, and so is a ﬁeld with
64 elements altogether. Thus we have constructed the essentially unique ﬁeld with 64
elements GF(26) = GF(64). Note of course that we could have also constructed this
ﬁeld, had we been able to ﬁnd an irreducible polynomial in Z2[x] of degree 6. You will
ﬁnd such a polynomial in Exercise 10.
The previous example shows that the unique ﬁeld with 23 elements can be considered
a subﬁeld of the unique ﬁeld with 26 elements. The full story is given by the following
theorem, which you prove in Exercise 5.
Theorem 45.5 The ﬁeld GF(pm) is a subﬁeld of GF(pn) if and only if m divides n.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we prove that for every positive prime integer p and positive integer n,
there exists a unique ﬁnite ﬁeld with exactly pn elements. This is a nice consequence of the
uniqueness of splitting ﬁelds.

Chapter 46
Galois Groups
We now return to our goal of understanding whether the roots of an irreducible polynomial
over a ﬁeld can be obtained by elementary algebraic computations. In Chapter 44 we con-
structed the unique splitting ﬁeld for such a polynomial, inside of which such computations
must occur. In the present chapter we will look closely at what sort of ﬁeld extension the
splitting ﬁeld must be. We will use group theory to do this.
In Chapter 17 we saw how geometry could be illuminated by considering functions
leaving geometric properties ﬁxed; we thus obtained groups of symmetries. Here we will
illuminate ﬁeld extensions (and splitting ﬁelds in particular) by considering functions leaving
ﬁeld properties ﬁxed; we will thus obtain groups of automorphisms called Galois groups.
46.1
The Galois Group
To better understand a ﬁeld F, it is useful to consider all functions that preserve essential
algebraic structure. Such functions are one-to-one and onto ring homomorphisms from the
ﬁeld to itself; such homomorphisms are called automorphisms. We have denoted the set
of all such automorphisms Aut(F); this set is a group under functional composition (see
Example 19.21).
Suppose that E and F are ﬁelds, and F ⊆E. We may now consider the following subset
of Aut(E):
Gal(E|F) = {ϕ ∈Aut(E) : ϕ(f) = f, for all f ∈F}.
That is, we are considering only those automorphisms of the ﬁeld E that leave all elements
of the subﬁeld F ﬁxed. It is easy to check that Gal(E|F) is a subgroup of Aut(E), using the
Subgroup Theorem 20.2.
 Quick Exercise.
Show that Gal(E|F) is a subgroup of Aut(E). 
We call Gal(E|F) the Galois Group of the ﬁeld E over F. Let’s consider some examples.
Example 46.1
Gal(R|Q) is the trivial group, because Aut(R) itself is the group with only one element
(see Exercise 19.13).
Example 46.2
Let K be any ﬁeld, with prime subﬁeld F. The prime subﬁeld is the ﬁeld generated
from 1 by ﬁeld operations, and so any automorphism must leave it ﬁxed. This means
that Gal(K|F) = Aut(K).
461

462
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Example 46.3
Gal(C|R) is the two element group {ι, ϕ}, where ι is the identity automorphism, and ϕ
is the complex conjugation map. This is true because there are only two automorphisms
of C that ﬁx R (Exercise 19.14).
Example 46.4
Let’s compute the Galois group Gal(Q(
√
2)|Q). Because Q is the prime subﬁeld of
Q(
√
2), it is left ﬁxed by any automorphism (Example 46.2). Since any element of
Q(
√
2) is of the form a + b
√
2, where a, b ∈Q, it is clear than any automorphism ϕ of
this ﬁeld is determined by ϕ(
√
2). But
2 = ϕ(2) = ϕ
√

= (ϕ(

and so ϕ(
√
2) must be a square root of 2. There are only two choices: ϕ(
√
2) =
√
2
and ϕ(
√
2) = −
√
2. The ﬁrst of these choices leads to the identity automorphism. The
second leads to ϕ(a + b
√
2) = a −b
√
2. You can check that this is an automorphism of
Q(
√
2) leaving Q ﬁxed, and so Gal(Q(
√
2)|Q) is a two element group.
 Quick Exercise.
Check explicitly that the set of these two automorphisms forms
a group.

We will generalize this example in Theorem 46.1 below.
Example 46.5
Consider the ﬁeld Q(
√
2,
√
3). Now every element of this ﬁeld can be expressed as
a+b
√
2+c
√
3+d
√
6 (see Example 43.2). Thus every automorphism ϕ of Q(
√
2,
√
3) is
determined by what it does to
√
2,
√
3,
√
6. Since
√
6 = (
√
2)(
√
3), we actually need
only know ϕ(
√
2) and ϕ(
√
3). By an argument similar to that in Example 46.4, we
have two choices for each of these. These lead to exactly four possibilities:
ι(a + b
√
2 + c
√
3 + d
√
6)
=
a + b
√
2 + c

You can check directly that these are all automorphisms. We thus have a group with
four elements. It is easy to check that each of these elements has order 2, and so this
group is (up to isomorphism) the Klein Four Group (see the discussion in Section 24.3).
 Quick Exercise.
Check that each ϕi is in fact an automorphism, and that each
such has order 2. 
We will now obtain a theorem generalizing the arguments made in Examples 46.4 and
46.5:
Theorem 46.1 Let F ⊆K be ﬁelds, and f ∈F[x] an irreducible polynomial, and α ∈
K\F a root of f. Suppose that ϕ ∈Gal(F(α)|F). Then ϕ is entirely determined by ϕ(α).
Furthermore, ϕ(α) must be a root of f in K, and so
|Gal(F(α)|F)| ≤deg(f) = [F(α) : F].

Chapter 46: Galois Groups
463
Proof:
Let deg(f) = n. We know from Theorem 42.3 that every element of F(α) can be
written (uniquely) in the form
β = b0 + b1α + · · · + bn−1αn−1,
where bi ∈F. But then
ϕ(β) = ϕ(b0) + ϕ(b1)ϕ(α) + · · · + ϕ(bn−1)ϕ
 αn−1
=
b0 + b1ϕ(α) + · · · + bn−1ϕ(α)n−1;
this follows because ϕ is a ring homomorphism, and ϕ(bi) = bi since bi ∈F. It then follows
that ϕ is entirely determined by what it does to α.
But α is a root of f = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, and so by a similar argument
f(ϕ(α)) = a0 + a1ϕ(α) + · · · + anϕ(α)n = ϕ(f(α)) = 0.
This means that ϕ(α) is also a root of f. Since deg(f) = n, there are at most n choices
for ϕ(α). It then follows that |Gal(F(α)|F)| ≤deg(f). The irreducibility of f implies that
deg(f) = [F(α) : F].
2
This theorem provides us with a practical approach for computing Galois groups of
simple algebraic extensions. Because each element of the Galois group takes each root of
f to a root of f, and since an automorphism is of course an injection, we can (up to
isomorphism) view the Galois group as a subgroup of the group of permutations of the
roots of f. In the examples that follow, we shall usually take this point of view.
 Quick Exercise.

Q. Theorem 46.1 says that Gal(Q(

case the Galois group is trivial, because only one of the three roots of x3 −2 is a real
number, and so is the only root in Q(
3√
2) ⊂R.
46.2
Galois Groups of Splitting Fields
In light of the previous example and theorem, it seems natural to ask when the Galois group
of an algebraic simple ﬁeld extension is as large as possible (namely, is equal to the degree of
the ﬁeld extension). It turns out that we already have the appropriate concept at hand: This
takes place exactly when the extension is normal (at least for ﬁelds of characteristic zero).
The result is really not all that surprising as Theorem 46.1 tells us that any automorphism
in Gal(F(α)|F) maps a root of f to another root of f and there are exactly deg(f) roots of
f available to us in a normal extension. This is the content of the next theorem:
Theorem 46.2 Let K be a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld F, which is of characteristic zero.
Then |Gal(K|F)| = [K : F] if and only if K is a normal extension of F.

464
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Proof:
Suppose ﬁrst that K is a normal extension of the ﬁeld F with characteristic zero.
We know from Theorem 44.5 that there exists an algebraic element β so that K = F(β).
Because K is a normal extension, K is the splitting ﬁeld for the minimal polynomial g
for β over F; let’s suppose that the degree of g is m. We know from Theorem 42.3 that
[K : F] = m. Suppose that
β = β1, β2, · · · , βm
are the roots of g in K; these roots are distinct, because F has characteristic zero (Theorem
44.4).
Consider now an element ϕ ∈Gal(K|F). By Theorem 46.1 it is entirely determined by
ϕ(β), and we have only m distinct choices βi to consider. Now by the proof of Exercise
14.20, the function
a0 + a1β + · · · + am−1βm−1 7→a0 + a1βi + · · · + am−1βm−1
i
is an isomorphism between F(β) and F(βi) that leaves F ﬁxed. Furthermore, F(β) =
F(βi) = K, since K is the unique splitting ﬁeld for g and a normal extension of F. This
means that each choice βi leads to a distinct element of Gal(K|F). Thus |Gal(K|F)| ≥m.
But m = deg(g) and Theorem 46.1 tells us that |Gal(K|F)| ≤m, and so |Gal(K|F)| = m =
[K : F].
Conversely, suppose that [K : F] = |Gal(K|F)|. Since our ﬁelds are of characteristic
zero, K = F(α), a simple extension of F, where α is a root of an irreducible polynomial
f ∈F[x] and deg(f) = [K : F]. But any ϕ ∈Gal(K|F) is determined by its value ϕ(α), and
ϕ(α) is a root of f. Since there are by assumption [K : F] distinct elements of Gal(K|F),
this means that all of the roots of f already belong to K. That is, K is the splitting ﬁeld
for f over F and so is a normal extension, by Theorem 44.6.
2
Under the conditions of Theorem 46.2, the group Gal(K|F) can be thought of as a
subgroup of Sm, where K = F(β), g ∈F[x] is the minimal polynomial for β over F,
and m = deg(g). Furthermore, by Theorem 46.1, each of these permutations is completely
determined by which of the m roots of g the root β is mapped to.
But notice that Theorem 46.2 applies to any ﬁnite normal extension, whether we express
it explicitly as a simple extension or not. The following example illustrates this:
Example 46.7
As we saw in Example 44.4, the splitting ﬁeld for x3 −2 over Q is Q(
3√
2, ζ), and
so is a normal extension of Q. We note that [Q(
3√
2) : Q] = 3 and [Q(ζ) : Q] = 2.
This means that [Q(
3√
2, ζ) : Q] = 6, and so by Theorem 46.2 the Galois group G =
Gal(Q(
3√
2, ζ)|Q) has six elements. Since each element of the group G permutes the
roots of x3 −2, we can (and should) think of G as a group of permutations of these
roots. But since 3! = 6, G consists of all such permutations. We shall thus label the
three roots
3√
2,
3√
2ζ,
3√
2ζ2 by the three integers 1, 2, 3 when thinking of the elements
of the Galois group as permutations. It is actually easiest to determine the elements ϕ
of G by choosing both ϕ(
3√
2) and ϕ(ζ), since ϕ must also permute the two roots ζ, ζ2
of the polynomial x2 + x + 1 = x3−1

We could instead consider Q(

2, ζ) as a simple extension of Q, and in particular as
Q(
3√
2+ζ); you can check the proof of Theorem 44.5 to verify that the element
3√
2+ζ
works to make Q(
3√
2, ζ) a simple extension. Since we know our ﬁeld extension is degree
6, we can infer that
3√
2 + ζ must be a root of an irreducible sixth degree polynomial
f ∈Q[x]. We can then think of the elements of the Galois group as permutations of
the roots of f. You will check these observations explicitly in Exercise 10; in Exercise
11 you will look at Q(
3√
2, ζ) as a simple extension using a diﬀerent ﬁeld element and
a diﬀerent minimal polynomial.
Example 46.8
The argument in Example 46.7 can be made more generally. Suppose that f ∈Q[x]
is any irreducible cubic polynomial with one real root and two complex roots. Let K
be the splitting ﬁeld for this polynomial over the rational ﬁeld. Then K contains a
degree 3 ﬁeld extension of Q, and so 3 divides [K : Q]. But complex conjugation is a
non-trivial element of Gal(K|Q). Since this has order two as a group element, 2 divides
|Gal(K|Q)| = [K : Q]. But then the Galois group consists of all 6 permutations of the
three roots of f in K and so is isomorphic to S3.

You then argued that the splitting ﬁeld of this polynomial is Q(

[Q(

2, i) : Q] = [Q(
4√
2, i) : Q(

and so the Galois group has eight elements. We can view the elements of G as permu-

4√

to one of the four roots, and ϕ(i), which is equal to one of the two roots of x2 + 1,

Example 46.10
We consider next the Galois group for the splitting ﬁeld of x7 −1 over Q. Now x7 −1 =
(x −1)Φ7(x) = (x −1)(x6 + · · · + x + 1), where Φ7(x) is the cyclotomic polynomial,
which is irreducible by Exercise 5.17. Furthermore, its six distinct roots are exactly ζ =

7 , ζ2, · · · , ζ6. So in this case the splitting ﬁeld is exactly Q(ζ), and [Q(ζ) : Q] = 6.

We recognize this group as a cyclic group of order 6.
The previous example admits a natural generalization that we will later ﬁnd quite useful.
Theorem 46.3 Let p be a prime integer. Suppose that F is a subﬁeld of the complex num-
bers C. Let ζ = e
2πi
p
be the primitive pth root of unity; suppose that ζ /∈F. Then F(ζ) is
the splitting ﬁeld for the polynomial Φp(x) = xp−1 +xp−2 +· · ·+x+1 over F. Furthermore,
Gal(F(ζ)|F) is abelian (and in fact cyclic of order p −1).
Proof:
We know that the splitting ﬁeld for Φp can be considered a subﬁeld of C, and
its roots are exactly the powers ζ, ζ2, ζ3, · · · ζp−1 of the primitive pth root of unity ζ.
Consequently, given an element ϕ ∈Gal(F(ζ)|F), it is certainly determined by its value
applied to ζ, and that value must be a root of Φp, namely, one of the powers ζk. So if
ϕ(ζ) = ζk, we will denote ϕ by ϕk.
Consider now the group Z∗
p of units of the ﬁeld Zp. This is clearly a ﬁnite abelian group,
and it is cyclic by the Primitive Root Theorem 45.4. Deﬁne the function
Ψ : Z∗
p →Gal(F(ζ)|F)
by setting Ψ([k]) = ϕk. We claim ﬁrst that this function is well-deﬁned. But this follows,
because
ϕk+pr(ζ) = ζk+pr = ζk(ζp)r = ζk = ϕk(ζ).
We now claim that this is a group homomorphism; that is, we claim that Ψ(jk) = ϕjk is
the same as Ψ(j) ◦Ψ(k). But
Ψ(jk)(ζ) = ϕjk(ζ) = ζjk = (ϕk(ζ))j = ϕj ◦ϕk(ζ) = Ψ(j) ◦Ψ(k)(ζ).
Now clearly Ψ is bijective.

Thus Gal(F(ζ)|F) is isomorphic to the cyclic group Z∗
p, and hence isomorphic to Zp−1. 2
Note that when we use this theorem in Chapter 48, we will actually only need the weaker
conclusion that Gal(F(ζ)|F) is abelian; this follows from the proof above, without actually
using the Primitive Root Theorem 45.4.

Chapter 46: Galois Groups

Let’s summarize what we have learned from our previous examples. Suppose that K is
a splitting ﬁeld over the ﬁeld F for an irreducible polynomial f ∈F[x]. Then [K : F] =
|Gal(K|F)| must at least be n = deg(f), because K contains an isomorphic copy of the ﬁeld
F[x]/⟨f⟩constructed by Kronecker’s Theorem, and this ﬁeld has degree n over F. And since
Gal(K|F) can and should be viewed as a group of permutations of the roots of f, it can
never have more than |Sn| = n! elements. In Example 46.10, the Galois group is as small as
possible; it has n elements. In Example 46.7, the Galois group is as large as possible; it has
n! elements. And in Example 46.9, the Galois group has a number of elements intermediate
between n and n!.
Example 46.11
The splitting ﬁeld of the polynomial x7 −2 ∈Q[x] is quite evidently Q(
7√
2, ζ), where
ζ is the seventh root of unity with smallest positive argument, which we considered in
Example 46.10.
 Quick Exercise.
What are the roots of this polynomial, in terms of ζ and
7√
2? 
Let’s now compute G = Gal(Q(
7√
2, ζ)|Q(ζ)). Any element ϕ ∈G clearly leaves ζ
ﬁxed and is determined by what it does to
7√
2. There are thus seven possible choices,
and since our extension is normal, all lead to automorphisms. Thus G is a group of
order seven, and so is necessarily isomorphic to a cyclic group of order seven.
You should note that if a ∈Q, p prime, and ζ = e
2πi
p , the primitive pth root of
unity, then Q( p√a, ζ) is the splitting ﬁeld of xp −a ∈Q[x]. Thus the ﬁeld Q( p√a, ζ)
contains all the pth roots of a, namely
p√a,
p√aζ, . . . ,
p√aζp−1.

sider the polynomial x6 −4 ∈Q[x]. The six roots are

3 , a primitive sixth root of unity. (Note

pute G = Gal(Q(
3√
2, ζ)|Q(ζ)). Again an element ϕ ∈G is determined by what it
does to
3√
2, since ζ is ﬁxed. There are six possible roots. However some of these
mappings are problematic. For if ϕ(

(ϕ(
3√

3√

We similarly must eliminate the cases if ϕ(

This leaves us with three possible roots to map

2ζ2, and

The resultant Galois group is therefore isomorphic to a cyclic group of order 3.
The explanation for these diﬃculties is that x6 −4 = (x3 + 2)(x3 −2) is not
irreducible in Q[x]. Indeed, we really have been working with the splitting ﬁeld of
x3 −2 over Q(ζ). Note that [Q(
3√
2, ζ) : Q(ζ)] = 3, with the Galois group having the
same number of elements. Note that we could alternatively have been considering this
ﬁeld extension as the splitting ﬁeld for x3 + 2 over Q(ζ).

You should compare this with Example 46.6.
Example 46.11 is an important one for us, and we will make use of it in Chapter 48
when we prove that it is impossible to solve the quintic by radicals. And so we generalize
the conditions of Example 46.11 (and put Example 46.12 in an appropriate context):

Theorem 46.4 Suppose that p is prime and F a subﬁeld of C. Suppose that r ∈F, but r
has no pth root in F while α ∈C and αp = r. Suppose that ζ = e
2πi
p ∈F. Then F(α) is the
splitting ﬁeld of xp −r ∈F[x] over F, and Gal(F(α)|F) is a cyclic group of order p.
Proof:
We may again suppose that the splitting ﬁeld of xp −r is a subﬁeld of C. But
the roots of xp −r in C are evidently the elements α, αζ, αζ2, · · · αζp−1. Because we are
assuming that ζ ∈F, all these elements belong to the ﬁeld F(α), and so the latter ﬁeld is
evidently the splitting ﬁeld, as required.
Given an element ϕ ∈Gal(F(α)|F), it is clearly determined by what it does to α, and
obviously ϕ(α) = αζk, for some integer k, with 0 ≤k ≤p −1. Because F(α) is normal over
F, each such choice leads to a distinct automorphism. So the Galois group has exactly p
elements. The only group with p elements is a cyclic group of that order.

Example 46.13
Consider now the polynomial x5 −6x + 3 ∈Q[x]. This is clearly irreducible, by Eisen-
stein’s Criterion 5.7. We will now calculate the Galois group of its splitting ﬁeld over
the rational ﬁeld. We will do this rather less directly than in our previous examples.
Let’s consider the polynomial function f(x) = x5 −6x + 3 and use some calculus.
Now f ′(x) = 5x4 −6, which has exactly two real roots ± 4q

5. The negative root
corresponds to a local maximum for f, and the positive root corresponds to a local
minimum. Furthermore, f takes on a positive value at the local maximum and a
negative value at the local minimum. Since limx→±∞f(x) = ±∞, f has exactly three
real roots. It must consequently have two complex roots, and these form a complex
conjugate pair. The graph of f in the picture below illustrates its properties.

Now let K be the splitting ﬁeld for f over Q[x]. We shall as usual view the Galois
group Gal(K|Q) as a group of permutations of the 5 distinct roots α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 of
f in K. We may as well label our roots so that the ﬁrst two are the complex roots. Since
f is irreducible and of degree 5 and its Kronecker ﬁeld is a subﬁeld of the splitting ﬁeld,
5 divides [K : Q] = |Gal(K|Q)|. Now Cauchy’s Theorem 24.5 implies that the group
Gal(K|Q) has an element of order 5, and as a permutation of a set of ﬁve elements,
the element must be a 5-cycle. As usual, we will think of the elements of our Galois
group as permutations on the root subscripts. So we may suppose that this 5-cycle is
α = (1abcd), where a, b, c, d are the integers 2, 3, 4, 5 in some order. But some power of
α is then of the form (12abc), and we may as well relabel the three real roots so that
the permutation (12345) belongs to the Galois group.
But complex conjugation is clearly a ﬁeld automorphism of K leaving Q ﬁxed and

Chapter 46: Galois Groups
469
so belongs to this Galois group. Complex conjugation leaves the three real roots ﬁxed
and interchanges the two conjugate roots, and so as a permutation of the roots it is
simply (12).
But now Exercise 27.9 says that (12) and (12345) together generate the entire
group S5. Consequently, we have shown that the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld K
of the polynomial x5 −6x + 3 ∈Q[x] is the full permutation group S5.
This example will be of considerable importance in Chapter 48, where we will show
that the Galois group being S5 will imply that it is impossible to solve for the roots of the
polynomial x5 −6x + 3 using ordinary ﬁeld arithmetic, and the extraction of roots!
Chapter Summary
For any ﬁnite ﬁeld extension K ⊇F we deﬁned the Galois group Gal(K|F) as the group of
all automorphisms of the ﬁeld K that leave F ﬁxed. When K is the splitting ﬁeld for some
polynomial f ∈F[x], then the Galois group can be viewed as a group of permutations of
the roots of f in K, whose size is equal to the degree of the ﬁeld extension K over F. This
size is always at least n = deg(f) and can in principle be as large as n!.

Chapter 47
The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
We saw in the last chapter that the Galois group of a ﬁnite extension of a ﬁeld provides a lot
of information about the structure of the extension ﬁeld. In fact, if the extension is normal,
then the degree of the extension is equal to the number of automorphisms belonging to the
Galois group. In this chapter we encounter the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,
which shows that this connection between ﬁeld extensions and groups carries even more
information than that. In Chapter 48 we will be able to exploit this connection between
ﬁeld theory and group theory to address our goal of better understanding the solution of
polynomial equations by ﬁeld arithmetic and the extraction of roots.

Subgroups and Subﬁelds

So for a ﬁeld E between the ﬁelds F ⊆K we always obtain a subgroup Gal(K|E) of the
Galois group Gal(K|F). But we can also proceed in the reverse direction and obtain ﬁelds
from subgroups. Suppose that H is a subgroup of the Galois group Gal(K|F). We deﬁne
Fix(H) = {k ∈K : η(k) = k, for all η ∈H}.
It is obvious that F ⊆Fix(H) ⊆K, because all elements of H ⊆Gal(K|F) ﬁx elements
from F, by deﬁnition. But more is true:
Theorem 47.1 Suppose that F ⊆K are ﬁelds, and H is a subgroup of Gal(K|F). Then
Fix(H) is a subﬁeld of K containing F.
Proof:
We leave the straightforward details to Exercise 5.

We thus call Fix(H) the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the subgroup H.

Returning again to Example 46.7, we have that Gal(Q(

2, ζ)|Q) is (up to isomor-
phism) the permutation group S3. This group has the following subgroups:

Notice that in Example 47.3 we actually have a one-to-one correspondence between all
subgroups of S3 and all ﬁelds intermediate between Q and Q(
3√
2, ζ). It turns out that this
is the case precisely because we have a normal extension. We shall discover that this (and
more) is the content of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory 47.3 that we prove
below.
47.2
Symmetric Polynomials
Before we can tackle the problem of understanding the correspondence we have begun
establishing between intermediate ﬁelds and subgroups of the Galois group, we have a
technical matter we need to discuss, regarding the coeﬃcients of a polynomial that splits
in a given ﬁeld.
Suppose that f ∈F[x] is a monic polynomial with roots α1, α2, · · · , αn that exist in the
splitting ﬁeld for f over F. We then have that
f = (x −α1)(x −α2) · · · (x −αn).

Chapter 47: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
475
If we multiply this out by using the distributive law, we will obtain
f =
n
X
k=0
(−1)n−kan−kxk = aoxn −a1xn−1 + a2xn−1 −· · · + (−1)nan,
where the coeﬃcient ak consists of the sum of all products of exactly k of the αj with
distinct subscripts (where we interpret this for k = 0 as a0 = 1). For example, if n = 4,
then
a0 = 1
a1 = α1 + α2 + α3 + α4
a2 = α1α2 + α1α3 + α1α4 + α2α3 + α2α4 + α3α4
a3 = α1α2α3 + α1α2α4 + α1α3α4 + +α2α3α4
a4 = α1α2α3α4
Notice that for convenience of description we have reversed the usual subscript convention:
ak is (up to plus or minus) the coeﬃcient on the xn−k term.
We can justify these formulas with a combinatorial argument. After all multiplications
have been distributed out, there will be 2n terms obtained by making all possible choices,
taking one of the two terms in each binomial factor x−αi. To obtain a contributor to the xk
term, we need to choose exactly k x-terms, and n−k αj terms, each with a distinct subscript
j. When we add up each of these terms, we get exactly the an−k terms described above.
Note also that each αj term selected contributes a factor of −1 as well. It is also possible
to construct a careful proof by induction; such a proof is tedious but straightforward, and
we will leave it as Exercise 7.
We call these coeﬃcients the symmetric polynomials
in the constants α1, · · · , αn.
What is important for our purposes to observe is that these polynomials are symmetric in
the αi’s. This means that if we have any ﬁeld automorphism that permutes the roots of f,
it will leave these coeﬃcients ﬁxed. This observation will be important in our proof of the
Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory 47.3 below.
47.3
The Fixed Field and Normal Extensions
Given ﬁelds F ⊆K, we have a way to obtain a subgroup Gal(K|E) of Gal(K|F), for
each intermediate ﬁeld E. And for each subgroup H of Gal(K|F), we have a way to obtain
an intermediate ﬁeld Fix(H). When K is a ﬁnite normal extension of F, it turns out that
these two processes are inverses of one another: Group theory will perfectly mirror ﬁeld
theory, and vice versa.
If E is a ﬁeld with ﬁeld extension K, then it is clear from the deﬁnition of the ﬁxed ﬁeld
and the Galois group that Fix(Gal(K|E)) ⊇E.

The following theorem asserts that the reverse inclusion holds only in case that K is normal
over E:
Theorem 47.2 Suppose that E ⊆K are ﬁelds of characteristic zero, and K is a ﬁnite
extension of E. Then Fix(Gal(K|E)) = E if and only if K is a normal extension of E.

476
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Proof:
Suppose ﬁrst that K is a normal extension of E; we may as well assume that
K is strictly larger than E. Since K is ﬁnite over E and of characteristic zero, this means
by Theorem 44.5 that K = E(α), for some algebraic α ∈K\E. We shall assume that the
minimal polynomial for α over E is f, and deg(f) = n. Then 1, α, α2, · · · , αn−1 is a basis for
K over E. Furthermore, because K is normal over E, K contains all n roots α = α1, · · · , αn
of f; these roots are distinct, by Theorem 44.4.
Let β ∈K, and suppose that β is ﬁxed by all elements of Gal(K|E). We will complete
the proof if we can conclude that β ∈E. (As we observed above, the reverse inclusion is
always true.)
Now we can express β in terms of our basis as β = Pn−1
k=0 akαk. But β is left ﬁxed by all
n elements of Gal(K|E), and for each i there is such a Galois group element ϕi that takes
α to αi (see the proof of Theorem 46.2). We thus have
β = ϕi(β) = ϕi

But now consider the polynomial g ∈K[x] deﬁned by
g = an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + (a0 −β).
By the previous equation, we see that g has n distinct roots αi. But this is too many roots
for a polynomial with degree no more than n −1. Thus, g must be the identically zero
polynomial. This means that β = a0 ∈E.
For the converse, suppose that Fix(Gal(K|E)) = E. We again may assume that K is
strictly larger than E, and furthermore that it is a simple extension K = E(α) with minimal
polynomial f, with deg(f) = n. We will show that K contains all n of the roots of f and
thus is the splitting ﬁeld for f over E, and so is normal, by Theorem 44.3.
Since α ∈K\E and Fix(Gal(K|E)) = E, there must be some ϕ ∈Gal(K|E) so that
ϕ(α) = α2 ̸= α. Now α2 is clearly a root of f, and α2 ∈K. If deg(f) = n = 2, then f splits
in K as required.
If n > 2 we must continue by induction. So we will suppose that α = α1, α2, · · · , αk are
all roots of f belonging to K. Let
g = (x −α1)(x −α2) · · · (x −αk).
This is clearly a factor of f in K[x]. If k < n then g is a non-trivial factor of f. Since f
is irreducible in E[x], this means that g /∈E[x]. But the coeﬃcients of g are precisely the
symmetric polynomials in α1, α2, · · · , αk. So if each element of Gal(K|E) merely permutes
these k roots, the coeﬃcients must belong to the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the Galois group, which is by
assumption E. Thus it must be the case that at least one of the αi is moved by an element
of Gal(K|E) to a root of f not on our current list. This provides us with another root of
f that belongs to K. By induction, we then obtain all the roots of f in K. Thus K is a
normal extension of E.

Example 47.4
We return to Example 46.6. Since Gal(Q(
3√
2)|Q) is trivial, the ﬁxed ﬁeld is Q(
3√
2).
Because this is strictly larger than the rational ﬁeld, it is not a normal extension. (Of
course, it is easy to see that this extension is not normal, directly from the deﬁnition.)

47.4
The Fundamental Theorem
We are now ready to state and prove the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.
Theorem 47.3
The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, Part One
Sup-
pose that K is a ﬁnite normal extension of the ﬁeld F, which is of characteristic zero. There
is a one-to-one order reversing correspondence between ﬁelds E with F ⊆E ⊆K and the
subgroups H of Gal(K|F). We can describe this correspondence by two maps that are in-
verses of one another; namely, we have
E 7−→Gal(K|E)
and
H 7−→Fix(H).
Proof:
It is clear from the deﬁnition of the Galois group and the ﬁxed ﬁeld that if we
have ﬁelds with E1 ⊆E2 then Gal(K|E1) ⊇Gal(K|E2). Also, if H1 ⊆H2 are subgroups of
the Galois group, then Fix(H1) ⊇Fix(H2). These two maps are thus order-reversing. We
need only show that the maps are inverses of one another. To do this, we will compose them
in both directions.
Since K is normal over F, it is clearly normal over E (see Exercise 44.a(i)). But then
Fix(Gal(K|E)) = E, as required.
We’d now like to show that for any subgroup H of Gal(K|F), we have that H =
Gal(K|Fix(H)). Because our ﬁelds are of characteristic zero, we have that K is a simple
extension Fix(H)(α) of Fix(H), where α is algebraic over Fix(H).
Suppose that the subgroup H has h elements, which we may specify as ι = η1, η2, · · · , ηh.
We can now consider the polynomial
f = (x −η1(α))(x −η2(α)) · · · (x −ηh(α)) ∈K[x].
The coeﬃcients for the polynomial f are then the symmetric polynomials in the constants
η1(α), η2(α), · · · , ηh(α).
But if we apply any element of H to the elements of this set, we will just permute them.
Consequently, the coeﬃcients for the polynomial f belong to Fix(H). Thus α is a root of
a polynomial with degree h in Fix(H)[x]. This means that [K : Fix(H)] = [Fix(H)(α) :
Fix(H)] ≤h.
But K is normal over Fix(H), and so
[K : Fix(H)] = |Gal(K|Fix(H))| ≥|H| = h.
Putting these inequalities together, we have that
h ≤|Gal(K|Fix(H))| ≤h,
and so |Gal(K|Fix(H))| = h and thus Gal(K|Fix(H)) = H, as required.
2
We will at the end of this chapter give numerous examples of the Fundamental Theo-
rem in action, but we will ﬁrst provide some important additional information about the
correspondence between subﬁelds and subgroups.
We ﬁrst make a few observations about counting. On the group side, we can count by
making use of Lagrange’s Theorem 24.2, while on the ﬁeld side our primary counting tool

478
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
is Theorem 43.2 (a ﬁnite extension of a ﬁnite extension is ﬁnite). So if K is a (characteristic
zero) normal ﬁeld extension of the ﬁeld F, and E is an intermediate ﬁeld, we have that
|Gal(K|F)| = [K : F] and |Gal(K|E)| = [K : E], and
[K : F] = [K : E][E : F].
But on the group side we have that
|Gal(K|F)| = |Gal(K|E)|[Gal(K|F) : Gal(K|E)].
This means that the degree [E : F] of the ﬁeld extension E over F is precisely equal to the
index [Gal(K|F) : Gal(K|E)] of the subgroup Gal(K|E) in the Galois group Gal(K|F). In
the examples in the next section this will be useful for us, because in practice it is often
easier to count group elements than it is to calculate the degree of ﬁeld extensions.
There is another more profound reﬁnement we can add to the one-to-one correspondence
we have between intermediate ﬁelds and subgroups of the Galois group. It turns out that
normal subgroups correspond exactly to normal extensions. This is the reason why such
extensions are called normal! This is important enough that we will call this result the
second part of the Fundamental Theorem:
Theorem 47.4
Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, Part Two
Suppose
that K is a ﬁnite normal extension of the ﬁeld F, with characteristic zero. An intermediate
ﬁeld E is a normal extension of F if and only if the Galois group Gal(K|E) is a normal
subgroup of Gal(K|F). Furthermore, the Galois group Gal(E|F) is isomorphic to
Gal(K|F)/Gal(K|E).
Proof:
Suppose that E is a ﬁeld intermediate between K and F. Then Gal(K|E) is normal
in Gal(K|F) if and only if ϕ−1ψϕ ∈Gal(K|E), for all ϕ ∈Gal(K|F) and ψ ∈Gal(K|E).
But because K is a normal extension of E, this is equivalent to asserting that ϕ−1ψϕ(e) = e,
for all e ∈E. But this is true exactly if ψϕ(e) = ϕ(e), for all e ∈E. But this means precisely
that ϕ(e) ∈Fix(Gal(K|E)) = E. And this says that all roots of the minimal polynomial for
e over F actually belong to E. This means exactly that E is a normal extension of F.
To show the group isomorphism, we shall deﬁne a group homomorphism Γ from
Gal(K|F) onto Gal(E|F) with the appropriate kernel. Given ϕ ∈Gal(K|F), we shall deﬁne
Γ(ϕ) = ϕ|E, the restriction of ϕ to the subﬁeld E. Because E is a normal extension of F,
we have that ϕ(e) ∈E, for all e ∈E. This means that this map is well deﬁned.
 Quick Exercise.
Why is the map well deﬁned? 
It clearly preserves the group operation (functional composition).
Now suppose that Γ(ϕ) = ι, the identity automorphism. This means exactly that ϕ leaves
all elements of E ﬁxed. In other words, ϕ ∈Gal(K|E). So the Fundamental Isomorphism
Theorem for Groups 26.4 asserts the isomorphism we require.

Examples
We shall conclude this chapter by looking at a number of examples illustrating the full
strength of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory.

479
Example 47.5
Let’s examine the normal ﬁeld extension Q(
√
2,
√
3) of Q that we considered in Exam-
ples 46.5 and 47.2. The Galois group G = {ι, ϕ1, ϕ2, ϕ3} is (isomorphic to) the Klein
Four Group, which clearly has three two element subgroups ⟨ϕ1⟩, ⟨ϕ2⟩and ⟨ϕ3⟩. These
subgroups correspond exactly to the three intermediate ﬁelds
Q(
√
3), Q(
√
6), Q(
√
2),
respectively. Since these are the only proper, nontrivial subgroups, the Fundamental
Theorem guarantees that these are the only proper intermediate subﬁelds. The index
of each of these subgroups in G is two, which corresponds precisely to the fact that
each of these extensions is of degree two over Q. The group G is abelian, and so each
of these subgroups is normal. This corresponds to the fact that the three quadratic
extensions are of course normal. Pictured below is the order-reversing correspondence
between subgroups and intermediate ﬁelds:

Example 47.6
In Example 47.3 we had already computed the ﬁxed ﬁelds corresponding to all of the
subgroups of Gal(Q(
3√
2, ζ)|Q) (see also Example 46.7, where we actually computed
the Galois group). Only one of the subgroups is normal, namely A3. Its ﬁxed ﬁeld is
Q(ζ) which is a quadratic normal extension; this is the only intermediate ﬁeld that is
normal over Q. Here is the picture of the subgroups and corresponding intermediate
ﬁelds:

Example 47.7
Let’s return to Example 46.10, where we considered the splitting extension of x7 −1
over Q. We know that the splitting extension is Q(ζ), where ζ = e
2πi
7 . The Galois
group G = Gal(Q(ζ)|Q) is a cyclic group of order six represented as a permutation
group as
{ι, (132645), (124)(365), (16)(25)(34), (142)(356), (154623)}.
A cyclic group of order six has exactly two proper, non-trivial subgroups, which in
this case are G1 = {ι, (16)(25)(34)} and G2 = {ι, (124)(365), (142)(356)}. We thus
have exactly two proper intermediate ﬁelds, Fix(G1) and Fix(G2). The ﬁrst must be

480
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
a cubic extension of Q, while the second is a quadratic extension. It is evident that
such ﬁeld elements as ζ + ζ6, ζ2 + ζ5, ζ3 + ζ4 are left ﬁxed by G1, while elements
ζ + ζ2 + ζ4 and ζ3 + ζ5 + ζ6 are left ﬁxed by G2. These are consequently candidates
for ﬁeld elements that might produce the appropriate intermediate ﬁelds. However,
we cannot immediately rule out the possibility that these elements might belong to
Fix(G) = Q.
To rigorously determine the ﬁxed ﬁelds for these subgroups requires us to inquire
more carefully into the arithmetic in Q(ζ). We ﬁrst should remember that ζ (and its
powers) are the roots of the irreducible cyclotomic polynomial 1 + x + x2 + · · · + x6.
For more insight into this ﬁeld, it is helpful to look at the picture of the seventh roots
of unity as complex numbers.

It is now quite evident that ¯ζ = ζ6, ¯ζ2 = ζ5, and ¯ζ3 = ζ4.
 Quick Exercise.
Check the above example by examining these complex numbers
in trigonometic form.

Consequently, ζ +ζ6, ζ2 +ζ5, ζ3 +ζ4 are real numbers, and we can in fact express
them trigonometrically (we will freely use the double angle and sum formulas for the
cosine function in the calculations below):
ζ + ζ6 = 2 cos 2π
7
ζ2 + ζ5 = 2 cos 4π
7 = 4 cos2 2π
7 −2
ζ3 + ζ4 = 2 cos 6π
7 = 8 cos3 2π
7 −6 cos 2π

 Quick Exercise.
Verify these trigonometric calculations. 
We can now show that ζ + ζ6 actually satisﬁes an irreducible cubic polynomial in
Q[x]. We begin with the cyclotomic polynomial (with terms reordered):
0 = 1 +
 ζ + ζ6
+
 ζ2 + ζ5
+
 ζ3 + ζ4
=
1 + 2 cos 2π
7 + 4 cos2 2π
7 −2 + 8 cos3 2π
7 −6 cos 2π
7 .
This means that ζ + ζ6 is a root of x3 + x2 −2x −1 ∈Q[x], which is clearly
irreducible by the Rational Root Theorem 5.6.

Chapter 47: The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory
481
Consequently, Q
 ζ + ζ6
is a cubic extension of Q and is thus necessarily the ﬁxed
ﬁeld of G1. In Exercise 6 you will check that the other two roots of x3 + x2 −2x −1
are precisely ζ2 + ζ5 and ζ3 + ζ4.
Now ζ + ζ2 + ζ4 is clearly not a real number, and so
Q
 ζ + ζ2 + ζ4
must be the other intermediate ﬁeld. To actually show that it is a quadratic extension,
we square it by brute force:
 ζ + ζ2 + ζ42 = ζ8 + 2ζ6 + 2ζ5 + ζ4 + 2ζ3 + ζ2
=
 ζ + ζ2 + ζ4
+ 2
 ζ3 + ζ5 + ζ6
.
But ζ3 + ζ5 + ζ6 = −1 −
 ζ + ζ2 + ζ4
, and so ζ + ζ2 + ζ4 is a root of the polynomial
x2 + x + 2, and its conjugate ζ3 + ζ5 + ζ6 is the other root. By the quadratic formula
we obtain these roots as −1
2 ±

7i
2 .
We thus have the following diagram of the ﬁelds and subgroups:

Example 47.8
In Example 46.13 we showed that the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld K of the
irreducible quintic x5 −6x + 3 ∈Q[x] consists of the full permutation group S5. As
before, we will denote the roots by α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, where α1 and α2 are the two
complex conjugate roots.
Now S5 has a large number of subgroups, and we will be unable to analyze all
of them! However, it will be useful to look at a couple of examples that are easy to
handle.
Consider ﬁrst the ﬁve stabilizer subgroups Stab(k) (for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The
subgroup Stab(k) is precisely the set of elements of S5 that leave the root αk ﬁxed
(see Exercise 23.14 for information about these subgroups). Each of these groups is
isomorphic to S4, and so has 24 elements. It is evident that the ﬁxed ﬁeld of Stab(k) is
precisely Q(αk). These ﬁve ﬁelds are necessarily distinct, because the subgroups are.
Furthermore, they are all isomorphic as ﬁeld extensions of Q, by Kronecker’s Theorem
41.1. Kronecker’s Theorem says these are degree 5 ﬁeld extensions; equivalently we can
see this because
[S5 : Stab(k)] = 120/24 = 5.
These are of course not normal subgroups, and the corresponding ﬁelds Q(αk) are not
normal extensions.
We can generalize to other stabilizer subgroups, as in Exercise 23.15. For example, if
J = {3, 4}, then the stabilizer subgroup Stab(J) is isomorphic to S3 and its ﬁxed ﬁeld is
Q(α3, α4), which is necessarily a ﬁeld extension of degree [S5 : Stab(J)] = 120/6 = 20.
An obvious element of the Galois group to consider is complex conjugation. It
leaves the three real roots α3, α4, α5 ﬁxed, and interchanges the conjugate pair α1
and ¯
α1 = α2. The 2 element subgroup {ι, (12)} has as its ﬁxed ﬁeld R ∩K, which is
necessarily a ﬁeld extension of Q of degree 60.
We have left out an obvious subgroup of S5 to consider. What about its unique

482
Exercises
non-trivial normal subgroup A5? Its ﬁxed ﬁeld is necessarily a quadratic extension of
Q (which will be a normal extension, of course). It turns out that this intermediate
ﬁeld can be found – our polynomial has an invariant integer d called its discriminant,
and the appropriate ﬁeld extension of Q inside K is Q(
√
d). We will not pursue this
topic here.
Chapter Summary
For a ﬁnite normal extension of a ﬁeld of characteristic zero, we prove the Fundamental The-
orem of Galois Theory. This theorem provides a one-to-one order-reversing correspondence
between the subgroups of the Galois group and the intermediate ﬁelds. Normal subgroups
correspond to normal extensions in this correspondence.

where the sum is over all possible choices of k distinct αi.
8. Suppose that f ∈F[x] is an irreducible polynomial of degree n over the ﬁeld F, where
F is a ﬁeld of characteristic zero. Let K be the splitting ﬁeld of f over F. Then we can
think of G = Gal(K|F) as a subgroup of the permutation group Sn. Prove that G is

Chapter 48
Solving Polynomials by Radicals
We are now ready to focus our attention on the problem of whether it is possible to solve all
polynomial equations over a subﬁeld of the complex numbers, by ordinary ﬁeld arithmetic,
together with the extraction of roots. We are able to do this in the quadratic case (using the
quadratic formula Exercise 10.1), in the cubic case (using the Cardano-Tartaglia approach,
Exercise 10.12), and in the quartic case (using the Ferrari approach, Exercise 10.20).
In this chapter we will recast this problem in terms of ﬁeld extensions, just as we did for
the notion of constructible numbers, in Chapter 37. In that context we simpliﬁed matters
considerably, by focusing our attention on the sequence of ever larger ﬁelds necessary to
obtain the constructible number. In that case the larger ﬁelds were built as quadratic
extensions. In our present case, we will need to build larger and larger ﬁelds, but allow
extensions by higher power roots instead.
48.1
Field Extensions by Radicals
Let’s consider a single step in the process of building larger ﬁelds by extraction of roots.
Given a ﬁeld F and an integer n ≥2, a radical extension of F is a simple algebraic ﬁeld
extension of the form F(β), where βn ∈F. Thus every element of the radical extension can
be expressed in terms of ﬁeld arithmetic on β, together with elements of F. But we can
view β as the result of an extraction of an nth root of βn ∈F. That is, every element of
F(β) can be obtained by a formula involving only ordinary ﬁeld arithmetic, together with
a root extraction.
We then generalize this inductively, supposing that we have a ﬁnite sequence of radical
extensions
F = F0 ⊂F1 = F0(β1) ⊂F2 = F1(β2) ⊂· · · ⊂FN = FN−1(βN),
where at each stage βni
i
∈Fi−1. We call the ﬁeld FN an extension of F by radicals;
for every element in FN there is a (perhaps very complicated!) formula, involving only ﬁeld
operations and extractions of roots, applied iteratively to the elements of the ﬁeld F. We’ll
call the ﬁnite sequence of ﬁelds a root tower over F.
Now, if f ∈F[x] is a polynomial, and its splitting ﬁeld K is contained in an extension
of F by radicals, we say that f is solvable by radicals.
This description of solvability by radicals can and should be compared to our description
of constructible numbers in the Constructible Number Theorem 37.3.
Let’s look at some examples.
Example 48.1
Any quadratic polynomial f = ax2 + bx + c ∈Q[x] is solvable by radicals over Q,
because the splitting ﬁeld for f is contained in (and is in this case equal to) the
485

. Here the root tower consists of just two ﬁelds: Q ⊆

 √
b2 −4ac

. Obviously the quadratic formula expression is our explicit solution by
radicals.
Example 48.2
Consider the polynomial f = x6 −2x3 −1 ∈Q[x]. Since this is a quadratic equation
in x3, it is evident by the quadratic formula that it factors as
f = (x3 −(1 +
√
2))(x3 −(1 −
√
2)).
But the roots in C of these two factors are in turn just cube roots. If as usual we let
ζ = −1
2 +
√
3
2 i be the primitive cube root of unity, we then have f completely factored
as
f =

So each of these six roots can be expressed in terms of a formula involving only ﬁeld

In Exercise 2 you will check that each of these ﬁeld extensions is in fact proper,
and so [F3 : Q] = 12. But from Example 46.8 we know that [K : Q] = |Gal(K|Q)| = 6.
Consequently, in this example our root tower reaches a ﬁeld extension strictly larger
than the splitting ﬁeld. We will have to account for this possibility in the general theory
we develop later in this chapter.
48.2
Reﬁning the Root Tower
Suppose again that we have a ﬁeld F, a polynomial f ∈F[x], and a root tower over F that
enables us to solve f by radicals. Our eventual goal is to show that the existence of such
a root tower places restrictions on the sort of group we can get as the Galois group of the
splitting ﬁeld for f. This restriction on the group will enable us to conclude that not all
polynomials are solvable by radicals, which is the goal of this chapter.
To accomplish this, we will modify our root tower in a couple of ways. First of all,
we’d like each step along the tower to be small enough that it can be well understood. So
now consider a single step in our root tower. We suppose that we have the ﬁeld extension
E ⊆E(β), where βn ∈E, and E is one of the ﬁelds reached at some stage of our root tower
for F. We now claim that we can assume that n is a prime integer. For if n = p1p2 · · · pm
is the prime factorization of n into (not necessarily distinct) prime factors, we can replace
the single radical extension from E to E(β) by a sequence of extensions as follows:
E ⊆E(βp2p3···pm) ⊆E(βp3···pm) ⊆· · · ⊆E(β).
We obviously arrive at the same spot in our root tower, at the expense of taking ﬁnitely
many extra steps in the construction. When we pass to the group side later, it will be more
convenient for us to assume we need only extract roots of prime order.
Our second modiﬁcation of the root tower requires us to impose a serious restriction
on the arguments that follow. We will assume not only that our ﬁeld F is of characteristic
zero, but that it is actually a subﬁeld of the complex numbers C. The examples of ﬁelds
of characteristic zero that we have explored in this and earlier chapters have all satisﬁed
this criterion, although there certainly do exist ﬁelds of characteristic zero that do not (see
Exercise 8). Our desire in this chapter is to recover Abel’s result that there exist ﬁfth degree
polynomials over Q that are not solvable by radicals, and so this restrictive assumption does
not eﬀect that goal.
The advantage of this restriction is that in C we have a very concrete understanding of

488
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
the pth roots of unity, where p is a prime integer. Theorem 46.3 tells us that the splitting
ﬁeld of the polynomial xp −1 ∈Q[x] is just Q(ζ), where
ζ = e
2πi
p
is the primitive pth root of unity.
With this restriction in place, we are now ready to return to our project of reﬁning our
root tower. Let’s suppose that the root tower we now have looks like this:
F = F0 ⊂F1 = F(β1) ⊂F2 = F(β2) ⊂· · · ⊂Fm = Fm−1(βm),
where for each i there is a prime integer pi with βpi
i
∈Fi−1. Now consider the set of all these
primes pi appearing as the degrees of the radical extensions in our root tower (of course,
some of these primes may occur more than once in this list). We will now extend our root
tower further, by ﬁrst adjoining each of the pith primitive roots of unity ζi, one at a time.
The ﬁrst terms of our root tower will then look like this:
F ⊆E1 = F(ζ1) ⊆E2 = E1(ζ2) ⊆· · · ⊆Em = F(ζ1, ζ2, · · · , ζm).
We note that by Theorem 46.3 it is clear that each of these ﬁelds Ei is normal over F,
because evidently Ei is the splitting ﬁeld over F for the polynomial
(xp1 −1)(xp2 −1) · · · (xpi −1).
Note that in case we have repetitions in our list of primes, some of these extensions may be
trivial; this is harmless for what follows.
So from our original root tower, we have obtained a new tower, where we only extract
roots of prime order, and where we have ﬁrst included all of the primitive roots of unity,
for each of the primes we need to use. Of course, by including all these extra elements we
may well have arrived at a much larger ﬁeld extension of the original ﬁeld F, but that is
harmless, because the new larger ﬁeld will still allow for the solution of the polynomial f
by radicals. We record our progress so far in reﬁning our root tower:
Lemma 48.1 Suppose that F is a subﬁeld of the complex numbers, and f ∈F[x] is solvable
by radicals over F. Then there exists a root tower of the following form, where the splitting
ﬁeld of f is contained in the largest ﬁeld Fm of the tower:
F ⊆E1 = F(ζ1) ⊆E2 = E1(ζ2) ⊆· · · ⊆Em = F(ζ1, ζ2, · · · , ζm) = F0
⊆F1 = F0(β1) ⊆F2 = F1(β2) ⊆· · · ⊆Fm = Fm−1(βm),
where pi are prime integers, ζi is the primitive pith root of unity, and βpi
i
∈Fi−1.
Notice that the index m is a count of the number of (not necessarily distinct) primes
used to perform the original root extractions, one prime at a time. Consequently, many of
the extensions in the tower above may be trivial; this does not aﬀect our goal. We have
thrown in many additional roots, precisely so that each individual extension in the Lemma
is fairly easy to understand: In each case we have adjoined a single prime order root.
Unfortunately, this is still not the root tower we will use, in general. Our next major
step is to be able to translate our ﬁeld extension problem into a problem of group theory,
by using the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory (Theorems 47.3 and 47.4). These
theorems do not yet apply, because we presently do not have any control over whether our
extensions are normal over F.
To be speciﬁc, consider the extension Fi = Fi−1(βi); since βpi
i
∈Fi−1, βi is a root of the

Chapter 48: Solving Polynomials by Radicals
489
polynomial xpi −βpi
k . But we know that the primitive pi-th root of unity ζi belongs to Fi−1,
and so the roots of our polynomial are just βi, βiζi, βiζ2
i , . . . , βiζpi−1
i
, which all belong
to Fi. However, this only makes Fi normal over Fi−1, and not over F. What follows is an
example showing that we cannot in general expect normality over the base ﬁeld F.
Example 48.4
Let β =
4√
2(1+i). As you can check directly, this is a root of x4 +8; see Exercise 44.8.
That is, β is a fourth root of −8. Now suppose that Q ⊂Q(β) is a step in our original
root tower. Since 4 is not prime, we must insert an additional ﬁeld in our tower. But
β2 = 2
√
2i, and this latter element is evidently a square root of −8. Our reﬁned root
tower is now
Q ⊂Q(2
√
2i) ⊂Q(2
√
2i, β) = Q(β).
The next step we took above was to ﬁrst insert all of the appropriate pth roots of
unity. But in this case the only prime involved is 2, and so we should ﬁrst adjoin the
primitive second root of unity. But this is just −1, which already belongs to Q. We
now claim that Q(β) is not a normal extension over Q. In Exercises 44.6 and 44.8 you
show that the splitting ﬁeld of x4 + 8 over Q is Q(
4√
2, i), which has degree 8 over the
rationals, but [Q(β) : Q] = 4. (This example was pointed out by Thomas Hungerford
in a recent paper in the American Mathematical Monthly.)
Our goal now is to replace each of the ﬁelds Fi above by a larger ﬁeld Ki, with the
property that Ki is in fact a normal extension of F. We will do this by including enough
elements at each stage that Ki will be the splitting ﬁeld of some polynomial gi over F. We
will proceed inductively. Our starting point for the induction is the normal ﬁeld extension
F ⊆K0 = F(ζ1, ζ2, · · · , ζm). Here K0 is exactly the splitting ﬁeld of the polynomial
g0 = (xp1 −1)(xp2 −1) · · · (xpm −1).
So suppose that we have already constructed our new sequence of ﬁelds
F ⊆K0 ⊆K1 ⊆K2 · · · ⊆Ki,
so that for every 1 ≤j ≤i, we have that βj ∈Kj, and each Kj is an extension of Kj−1
by radicals, and is a normal extension of F; in fact, we will assume that Kj is the splitting
ﬁeld of a polynomial gj ∈F[x]. Note that because Fi = F(β1, β2, · · · , βi), it is evident that
Fj ⊆Kj, for all 1 ≤j ≤i.
We shall now provide the inductive argument to construct Ki+1. We know that βpi+1
i+1 ∈
Fi ⊆Ki; for notational convenience, let’s call this element e, and set p = pi+1. We can
enumerate the elements of the Galois group Gal(Ki|F) as {ι = ϕ1, ϕ2, · · · , ϕk}. Consider
the polynomial
h = (xp −ϕ1(e))(xp −ϕ2(e)) · · · (xp −ϕk(e)) ∈Ki[x].
We will now build the splitting ﬁeld of h over Ki by radical extensions, one factor at
a time. Notice that the coeﬃcients of the polynomial h are symmetric polynomials in the
roots
ϕ1(e), · · · , ϕk(e);
see Section 47.2. Furthermore, we know that the elements of Gal(Ki|F) permute the roots of
h. But symmetric polynomials in the roots are thus left ﬁxed by the elements of Gal(Ki|F),
and so these coeﬃcients belong to the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the Galois group. By the induction
hypothesis, we know that Ki is normal over F, and so the ﬁxed ﬁeld of the Galois group is
equal to F. Consequently, the coeﬃcients belong to F, and so h ∈F[x].

490
A First Course in Abstract Algebra: Rings, Groups, and Fields
Now we know that the primitive pth root of unity ζ is an element of the ﬁeld Ki.
Consequently, in order to assure that the factor xp −ϕi(e) splits, we need only adjoin a
single root ρi to the previous ﬁeld (Theorem 46.4); here ρi is a root of the polynomial
xp −ϕi(e). We thus have
Ki ⊂Ki(ρ1) ⊂Ki(ρ1, ρ2) ⊂· · · ⊂Ki(ρ1, · · · , ρk).
Note that at each stage in this sequence we have a splitting ﬁeld for a polynomial
(xp −ϕ1(e))(xp −ϕ2(e)) · · · (xp −ϕj(e)) ∈Ki[x],
and so each of these ﬁelds is normal over Ki. (They may not be normal over F, because these
intermediate polynomials need not belong to F[x].) We shall now let Ki+1 = Ki(ρ1, · · · , ρk);
evidently Ki+1 is the splitting ﬁeld over F of the polynomial gi+1 = gih ∈F[x], where by
the induction hypothesis gi is the polynomial in F[x] for which Ki is the splitting ﬁeld over
F.
Let’s summarize the situation we now have.
Lemma 48.2 Suppose that F ⊂C is a ﬁeld, and f ∈F[x] is a polynomial that can be
solved by radicals over F. Then there exists a sequence of ﬁeld extensions
F ⊆E1 = F(ζ1) ⊆E2 = E1(ζ2) ⊆· · · ⊆Em = K0 = F(ζ1, ζ2, · · · , ζm)
⊆K1 ⊆K2 ⊆· · · ⊆Km,
so that the following conditions hold:
1. For each i, ζi is the pith primitive root for unity, for the prime integer pi.
2. Each Ki is normal over F.
3. Each Ki+1 is obtained from Ki by ﬁnitely many radical extensions of degree pi; these
extensions are all normal over Ki.
4. Km contains the splitting ﬁeld of f over F.
We have now put all the technical details in place and are now ready to apply Galois
theory to this lemma, which we shall do in the next section.
48.3
Solvable Galois Groups
In the last section we showed that whenever a polynomial f ∈F[x] ⊆C[x] is solvable by
radicals, we can construct a root tower of a particular type, as speciﬁed in Lemma 48.2.
This gives us the information we need to translate our root tower into a sequence of groups.
This translation from ﬁeld theory into group theory gives us the following:
Theorem 48.3 Suppose that f ∈F[x] ⊆C[x] is solvable by radicals. Then the Galois group
of the splitting ﬁeld for f is solvable.

Chapter 48: Solving Polynomials by Radicals
491
Proof:
We will now apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory to the ﬁeld exten-
sions guaranteed by Lemma 48.2. Let
G = G0 = Gal(Km|F), G1 = Gal(Km|E1), · · · , Gm = Gal(Km|Em)
Gm+1 = Gal(Km|K1), · · · , G2m = Gal(Km|Km).
It is evident that
G2m = {ι} ⊆G2m−1 ⊆· · · ⊆Gm ⊆· · · ⊆G1 ⊆G
and each of these subgroups is normal in G, because each of the ﬁelds Ei and Ki are normal
extensions of F.
We would like to conclude that G is a solvable group; we will use Theorem 30.4. For
0 < i ≤m, we have that
Gi−1/Gi = Gal(Km|Ei−1)/Gal(Km|Ei) ≈Gal(Ei|Ei−1).
The isomorphism follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. But by Theorem
46.3 we know that this is an abelian group, and hence solvable, of course.
For 0 < i ≤m, we have that
Gm+i−1/Gm+i = Gal(Km|Ki−1)/Gal(Km|Ki) ≈Gal(Ki|Ki−1).
We would like to argue that this last group is a solvable group.
But note that we obtain Ki from Ki−1 by ﬁnitely many radical extensions of degree
p = pi, a prime integer. That is, we have that
Ki−1 ⊆L1 ⊆L2 · · · ⊆Lh ⊆Ki,
where each of the ﬁelds Lj is obtained from its predecessor by adjoining a pth root of an
element from the previous ﬁeld. Furthermore, we know by construction that the primitive
pth root of unity ζ ∈Ki−1. Consequently, each of these extensions is normal over Ki−1,
because it is the splitting ﬁeld over Ki−1 for a polynomial of the form xp −e (see Lemma
48.2 above).
We thus have the subnormal series
{1} ⊆Gal(Ki|Lh) ⊆Gal(Ki|Lh−1) ⊆· · · ⊆Gal(Ki|L1) ⊆Gal(Ki|Ki−1).
When we compute the quotient group of two of these groups we have
Gal(Ki|Lj−1)/Gal(Ki|Lj) ≈Gal(Lj|Lj−1).
But this last group is cyclic by Theorem 46.4. This means that our subnormal series actually
makes Gal(Ki|Ki−1) a solvable group.
Putting this all together, we have now concluded by Theorem 30.4 that G = Gal(Km|F)
is also a solvable group.
This is almost the conclusion that we want. However, Km is in practice probably much
larger than the splitting ﬁeld for f over F. But if we let K be that splitting ﬁeld, then K is
a normal extension of F, and so another application of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois
Theory gives us that
Gal(K|F) ≈Gal(Km|F)/Gal(Km|K).
But this means that Gal(K|F) is a homomorphic image of the solvable group Gal(Km|F)
and so is itself solvable, by Theorem 30.1.

Exercises
It is actually the case that the converse of Theorem 48.3 is true — that is, if the Galois
group for the splitting ﬁeld of a polynomial f ∈F[x] ⊆Q[x] is solvable, then f is actually
solvable by radicals over F. To prove this, we would have to start with the subnormal series
with abelian quotients for the Galois group, and build a sequence of radical ﬁeld extensions
that eventually contain the splitting ﬁeld. We will not actually carry out this project here.
The next example is what we’ve been looking for! It is a polynomial of degree ﬁve that
is not solvable by radicals.
Example 48.5
Consider again the polynomial f = x5−6x+3 ∈Q[x]. In Example 46.13 we showed that
the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld for f over Q is S5. In Example 30.4 we asserted
that S5 is not a solvable group. Theorem 48.3 now means that f is not solvable by
radicals!
Example 48.6
In Example 48.2 we considered the polynomial f = x6 −2x3 −1 ∈Q[x] and showed
explicitly that it is solvable by radicals. In Exercise 1 you will compute the Galois
group for the splitting ﬁeld of this polynomial and show that it is a solvable group.
We have thus solved (in the negative) a problem that bedeviled European mathemati-
cians for several centuries. It is in principle impossible to extend the progressively more
complicated algebraic formulas we have for second, third, and fourth degree equations to
the ﬁfth degree or higher. The mathematics involved is more complicated, but the situation
is the same as for the classical constructibility problems: Field theory (in this case with an
important assist from the theory of groups) has solved an important mathematical problem
that at ﬁrst blush does not seem to require the abstract approach.
The abstract algebraic approach was successful in settling the construction problems of
classical antiquity and in solving the solution by radicals problems of the Italian renais-
sance; this is only the beginning of the story. Powerful algebraic techniques have played an
important role in bringing profound insights into many diﬃcult and important problems,
over the course of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-ﬁrst centuries. You are invited to
learn more about the successes and beauty of modern mathematics.
Chapter Summary
In this chapter we prove that if a polynomial over a subﬁeld of the complex numbers can
be solved by radicals, then the Galois group of its splitting ﬁeld over the base ﬁeld is
necessarily a solvable group. We can then easily exhibit a ﬁfth degree polynomial over the
rational numbers that cannot be solved by radicals.

Exercises
1. Consider the polynomial x6 −2x3 −1 ∈Q[x] from Example 48.2 and 48.6. Compute
the Galois group for the splitting ﬁeld of this polynomial over Q, and show explicitly
that this is a solvable group. Find the subgroups corresponding to the ﬁxed ﬁelds
Q(

2), Q(ζ), Q(ζ,
√
2), Q(α), Q(αζ), Q(αζ2).
2. Consider the root tower obtained in Example 48.3 to obtain a ﬁeld containing the
splitting ﬁeld K for x3 + 3x + 1 ∈Q[x]. Show that each ﬁeld extension in the root
tower is proper, and so the ﬁeld F3 is a proper extension of K.
3. In this problem and its successor we will describe a method that helps determine the
Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld for a quartic polynomial. Let F be a subﬁeld of the
complex numbers, and suppose that f ∈F[x] is an irreducible polynomial of degree
four. We may as well assume that f is monic, and so
f = (x −α1)(x −α2)(x −α3)(x −α4),
where the αi are distinct elements of C. Let K = F(α1, α2, α3, α4) be the splitting ﬁeld
for f. We will consider G = Gal(K|F) as a subgroup of the group S4 of permutations of
these roots, in this order. By Section 47.2 we know that f = x4−a1x3+a2x2−a3x+a4,
where the ai are the symmetric polynomials in the roots αi.
(a) Let
β1 = α1α2 + α3α4,
β2 = α1α3 + α2α4,
β3 = α1α4 + α2α3.
Form the polynomial
g = (x −β1)(x −β2)(x −β3) = x3 −b1x2 + b2x −b3.
By making use of what we know about symmetric polynomials, prove that
b1 = a2,
b2 = a1a3 −4a4,
b3 = a2
1a4 + a2
3 −4a2a4.
Thus, g ∈F[x]. Note: Pay heed to the signs involved. The polynomial g is called
the resolvent polynomial for f.

Exercises
(b) Let E = F(β1, β2, β3) be the splitting ﬁeld for g over F; this is a subﬁeld of K.
Let
H = G ∩{ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}.
Prove that E = Fix(H).
(c) Why is H normal in G?
(d) Prove that Gal(E|F) is isomorphic to G/H.
4. In this exercise we use the same notation and terminology as in the previous exercise.
By Exercise 47.8 the Galois group G is necessarily a transitive subgroup of S4. In
Exercise 27.13 you compiled a list of all the transitive subgroups of S4. We will in
what follows think of G/H = Gal(E|F) as a subgroup of the group of permutations
S3 of the roots of g. We now look at all possible cases for G:
(a) Suppose that G = S4. Then show that G/H is isomorphic to S3.
(b) Suppose that G = A4. Then show that G/H is isomorphic to Z3.
(c) Suppose that G = {ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}. Then show that G/H is the
trivial group.
(d) Suppose that G is a cyclic group of order 4. Then show that G/H is a cyclic
group of order 2.
(e) Suppose that
G = {ι, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23), (12), (34), (1423), (1324)},
the subgroup of S4 of order 8 (isomorphic to D4). Then show that G/H is a
cyclic group of order 2.
Note: Since H is the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld of a cubic polynomial, it is
presumably easier to compute than is G. But the results above say that in most cases
knowing H actually determines G. We will illustrate this principle in the exercises that
follow. The ambiguous case that remains (when H is a cyclic group of order 2) can
actually also be resolved by a reﬁnement of the argument given here. For information
about that case you can consult Nathan Jacobson’s Basic Algebra I (W. H. Freeman
and Company, 1974), from which these exercises have been adapted.
5. From Example 46.9 we know that the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld for x4 −2 is
isomorphic to D4. Thus if we form the resolvent polynomial g, we know from Exercise
4 that its Galois group is a cyclic group of order two. Compute g and the Galois group
explicitly, to check this computation.
6. Consider the polynomial f = x4 + 2x + 2 ∈Q[x].
(a) Why is f irreducible over Q[x]?
(b) Use calculus to argue that f has no real roots.
(c) Show that the resolvent polynomial g obtained as in Exercise 3 is g = x3−8x−4.
(d) Why is g irreducible over Q[x]?
(e) Use calculus to argue that g has three real roots.
(f) Argue that the Galois group of g over the rational ﬁeld must contain an element
of order 3. What does this mean about the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld for
f?

7. Consider the polynomial f = x4 + 2x −2 ∈Q[x]. Notice that this is just a vertical
shift of the polynomial in the previous exercise.
(a) Why is f irreducible over Q[x]?
(b) Use calculus to argue that f has exactly two real roots.
(c) Show that the resolvent polynomial g obtained as in Exercise 3 is g = x3+8x−4.
(d) Why is g irreducible over Q[x]?
(e) Use Example 46.8 to argue that the Galois group for the splitting ﬁeld for g over
the rational ﬁeld is S3.
(f) What is the Galois group of the splitting ﬁeld for f over Q?
(g) Let r be one of the real roots of f. What is [Q(r) : Q]?
(h) We now argue that r cannot be constructible; So we suppose by way of contra-
diction that it is. Why would there be a proper intermediate ﬁeld Q ⊂F ⊂Q(r)?
What kind of extension does that make Q(r)
(i) Use what you know about the roots of f to conclude that Q(r) cannot be normal
over Q. This allows us to conclude that r is not constructible. This example
shows that the converse of Corollay 43.5 is false.
8. In this exercise we will sketch a construction of a ﬁeld with characteristic zero, which
is not (isomorphic to) a subﬁeld of C. Our method of proof for Theorem 48.3 relies on
assuming our ﬁeld is a subﬁeld of C, although there are actually more general proofs
that remove this hypothesis. Consider SC, the ring of all complex-valued sequences,
with addition and multiplication deﬁned component-wise (this is a ring entirely anal-
ogous to the ring of real-valued sequences considered in Exercise 6.19). We can also
consider the ideal ΣC of this ring, consisting of all sequences with at most ﬁnitely
many non-zero entries (this is an ideal entirely analogous to that in the real case, con-
sidered in Exercise 9.29). We can now apply the Maximal Ideal Theorem (see Exercise
15.31) to ﬁnd a maximal ideal M of SC, for which ΣC ⊂M. Let’s denote by K the
ﬁeld SC/M.
(a) Consider the element M + (1, 1, 1, . . .) ∈K. Why is this element non-zero in K?
(b) Deﬁne a function ϕ : C →K deﬁned by ϕ(α) = M + (α, α, α, . . .). Prove that
this is an injective ring homomorphism, which is not onto.
(c) Now suppose by way of contradiction that there is an injective ring homomor-
phism ψ of K into C. Use the composition ψϕ and suitable slight generalizations
of Exercises 19.13 and 19.14 to derive a contradiction.

Section X in a Nutshell
This section applies ﬁeld theory and group theory to prove that there is no general method
to solve ﬁfth degree equations using only ﬁeld operations and extractions of roots.
We start by deﬁning a splitting ﬁeld for a polynomial f over a ﬁeld F, which is a minimal
ﬁeld extension of F where f factors into linear polynomials. There is always a splitting ﬁeld
and a splitting ﬁeld is a ﬁnite extension of F (Theorem 44.1). Furthermore, any two splitting
ﬁelds for a given f ∈F[x] are isomorphic (Theorem 44.2). Splitting ﬁelds have the surprising
property that if K is a splitting ﬁeld over F for f, and g ∈F[x] is irreducible over F with
a root in K, then g also factors into linear polynomials in K (Theorem 44.3).
An extension ﬁeld K of F is a normal extension of F if whenever an irreducible f ∈F[x]
has one root in K, then it splits in K. If F has characteristic zero, then K is a ﬁnite normal
extension of F if and only if K is a splitting ﬁeld for some irreducible polynomial in F[x]
(Theorem 44.6). Furthermore, the roots of an irreducible polynomial over F are all distinct
in its splitting ﬁeld (Theorem 44.4), as long as the ﬁeld is of characteristic zero. Another
important property of ﬁelds of characteristic zero is this: any ﬁnite extension is actually
simple (Theorem 44.5).
The section digresses a bit with a chapter on ﬁnite ﬁelds where we use the uniqueness of
the splitting ﬁeld to prove that every ﬁnite ﬁeld of characteristic p (prime) has pn elements
(Theorem 45.1), and, indeed, a unique such ﬁeld exists of order pn, for every p and n. We
denote this Galois ﬁeld by GF(pn). Also, GF(pm) is a subﬁeld of GF(pn) if and only if m
divides n.
If E is an extension ﬁeld of F, then the set of automorphisms of E that ﬁx elements in F
forms a group, denoted by Gal(E|F) and called the Galois group of the ﬁeld E over F. We
then explore the relationship between the order of these Galois groups and the degrees of the
ﬁeld extensions and discover that these counts are equal in the case of normal extensions:
• (Theorem 46.1) Let F ⊆K be ﬁelds, and f ∈F[x] an irreducible polynomial, and
α ∈K\F a root of f. Suppose that ϕ ∈Gal(F(α)|F). Then ϕ is entirely determined
by ϕ(α). Furthermore, ϕ(α) must be a root of f in K, and so
|Gal(F(α)|F)| ≤deg(f) = [F(α) : F].
• (Theorem 46.2) Let K be a ﬁnite extension of the ﬁeld F, which is of characteristic
zero. Then |Gal(K|F)| = [K : F] if and only if K is a normal extension of F.
If H is a subgroup of Gal(K|F), then the elements of K ﬁxed by H (called the ﬁxed ﬁeld
of H and denoted Fix(H)) is a subﬁeld of K containing F (Theorem 47.1). Once again, in
the case of normal extensions, the situation is particularly nice: Fix(Gal(K|F)) = F if and
only if K is a normal extension of F (Theorem 47.2).
The theory culminates in the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, which we pre-
sented in two parts (Theorems 47.3 and 47.4) but consolidate here. It shows how group
theory and ﬁeld theory mirror one another:
Suppose that K is a ﬁnite normal extension of the ﬁeld F, which is of characteristic zero.
There is a one-to-one order reversing correspondence between ﬁelds E with F ⊆E ⊆K
and the subgroups H of Gal(K|F). We can describe this correspondence by two maps that
are inverses of one another; namely, we have
E 7−→Gal(K|E)
and
H 7−→Fix(H).
496

Furthermore, an intermediate ﬁeld E is a normal extension of F if and only if the Galois
group Gal(K|E) is a normal subgroup of Gal(K|F). And in that case, the Galois group
Gal(E|F) is isomorphic to
Gal(K|F)/Gal(K|E).
We now have the theory in place to prove that the general ﬁfth degree polynomial
equation cannot be solved by radicals. A radical extension of a ﬁeld F is a simple algebraic
extension F(β) where βn ∈F, for some integer n ≥2. A sequence of radical extensions
F = F0 ⊂F1 = F0(β1) ⊂F2 = F1(β2) ⊂· · · ⊂FN = FN−1(βN),
where at each stage βni
i
∈Fi−1 is called a root tower over F and the last ﬁeld FN is an
extension of F by radicals. If f ∈F[x] has a splitting ﬁeld contained in an extension of F by
radicals, we say that f is solvable by radicals. Notice how this is similar to our description
of constructible numbers in Section VII. After some delicate adjustments to this root tower,
we obtain a careful reﬁnement fully described in Lemma 48.2. We then translate this lemma
into group theory using the Fundamental Theorem, thus obtaining the theorem we need
(Theorem 48.3):
Suppose that f ∈F[x] ⊆C[x] is solvable by radicals. Then the Galois group of the
splitting ﬁeld for f is solvable.
Example 48.4 considers the polynomial x5−6x+3 ∈Q[x], which has Galois group S5 (as
we showed in Example 46.13). But S5 is not solvable (Example 30.4) and so this polynomial
is not solvable by radicals.

Hints and Solutions
We provide here various short answers or hints for the warm-up and odd numbered exercises.
Normally we will give hints for all but the simplest proofs or on occasion a brief outline.
Please note that if an exercise asks for an example we provide one, although there are
usually many other possibilities.
Chapter 1 — The Natural Numbers
a. Z is closed under subtraction (has additive inverses). Q is closed under division (has
multiplicative inverses).
b. Z and Q do not have a least element. The subset {x : 0 < x ≤1} does not have a least
element.
c. Number the dominoes with the natural numbers in the order they stand. If you tip over
domino n, the domino n + 1 will tip over also. So, if I knock over domino one, by induction
all dominoes will knock over.
d. Any ﬁnite subset of an ordered set has a least element.
1. Hint: This follows by straightforward induction.
3. Hint: Use mathematical induction and the triangle inequality.
5. Hint: Note that here your base case for induction is when n = 4. You can easily check
that this statement is false for n = 1, 2, and 3.
7. Hint: This follows by straightforward induction. You can also ﬁrst show (by induction)
this is true for a = 1, and then just multiply by a.
9. 4 (see Theorem 2.4).
11. Hint: Note the base case is when n = 1 and when n = 2. For the induction step, assume
n > 2.
13. Hint: Again, base case is when n = 1, 2. For induction step, assume n > 2 and use the
deﬁning formula an+2 = an+1 + an.
15. The “induction” step is false when n = 2.
17. Hint: It’s probably easier to prove that the Strong Principle is equivalent to the Well-
ordering Principle. This works because of Theorem 1.1 and Exercise 16.

−120 = 13(−10) + 10;
120 = (−13)(−9) + 3;

b. 0, 1, 2. {· · · , −5, −2, 1, 4, 7, · · ·}.
c. 1 and |p|.
d. The multiples of m.
e.

502 = 2 · 251; 1002 = 2 · 3 · 167.

Hints and Solutions
f. 1/30.
g. One method is algorithmic, relying on Euclid’s Algorithm. The other is existential, prov-
ing the existence by the well-ordering principle. The later is (relatively) quick to describe.
The former allows one to compute the GCD identity.
1. (13)(21) + (−8)(34) = 1, (157)(772) + (−50)(2424) = 4, (−53)(2007) + (524)(203) = 1,
and (4)(3604) + (−3)(4770) = 106.
3. Hint: There are two things to prove here: Each linear combination of a and b is a multiple
of gcd(a, b) and each multiple of gcd(a, b) can be written as a linear combination of a and
b. The latter part is easy to show. For the former, note that a common divisor of a and b
also divides ax + by.
5. Hint: The base case is trivial, since n = 1. For induction, assume p|a1a2 · · · an =
(a1a2 · · · an−1)an, for n > 1.
7. Hint: Consider (n + 1)! + 2, (n + 1)! + 3, · · · , (n + 1)! + (n + 1).
9. Hint: Use the GCD identity: Let g = bx + cy be least such linear combination of b and c.
Now suppose h = gcd(ab, ac) = abx′ + acy′ = a(bx′ + cy′). If bx′ + cy′ is not smallest such
linear combination then . . ..
11. 22 · 3 · 5 · 19, 2 · 5 · 32 · 7.
13. Hint: By way of contradiction, assume lcm(a, b) = x does not divide m. By the Division
Theorem, x = dm + r, where 0 < r < x. Argue x is a common multiple of a and b.
15. b. Hint: Consider the square with three vertices E, P, and C, and use part (a). Why
does this mean that the algorithm never halts?
17. a. Note the ﬁrst recursive call is gcd(772, 108).

11. |S5| = 120 = 23 · 3 · 5. There are either 1, 3, 5, or 15 Sylow 2-subgroups. Note that
the cyclic group generated by a 4-cycle is a Sylow 2-subgroup and in each of these cyclic
groups, there are exactly 2 4-cycles (the generator and its inverse). Now there are a total of
30 4-cycles in S5 which would imply 15 diﬀerent Sylow 2-subgroups – all isomorphic to Z4.
In a similar manner, we see there are 1, 4, or 10 Sylow 3-subgroups. These are obviously
isomorphic to Z3 and generated by 3-cycles, each Sylow 3-subgroup containing 2 3-cycles.
There are 20 2-cycles in S5 implying there are 10 Sylow 3-subgroups.
There are either 1 or 6 Sylow 5-subgroups, each isomorphic to Z5 and generated by a 5-
cycle. There will be 4 5-cycles in each Sylow 5-subgroup. There are a total of 24 5-cycles

we get an inﬁnite tower of ideals, all inside I.
Now suppose every ideal is ﬁnitely generated and I1 ⊂I2 ⊂I3 ⊂· · · is a tower of ideals.
Let I = ∪Ii. I is ﬁnitely generated, so I = ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an⟩. Each ai must be in some Ik. Let

Guide to Notation
In this appendix we provide a guide to the mathematical notation we use in this book. In
many cases we provide a reference in the text where the given notation ﬁrst occurs. Rather
than attempting an alphabetical listing, we have grouped this list of notations conceptually.
Set Theory
Modern mathematics is expressed in terms of set theory, and we use standard notation for
these concepts. In what follows, assume that A and B are sets:
If a is an element of A, then we write a ∈A. If it isn’t, we write a /∈A.
The intersection of A and B is
A ∩B = {x : x ∈A and x ∈B}.
The union of A and B is
A ∪B = {x : x ∈A or x ∈B}.
The set diﬀerence is
A\B = {x : x ∈A and x /∈B}.
If A is a subset of B, we write A ⊆B. If it is a proper subset we write A ⊂B. We can
change emphasis and write these two as B ⊇A and B ⊃A, respectively.
If the set A is ﬁnite we denote by |A| the number of elements in A.
The set product is the set of all ordered pairs, with ﬁrst entry from A and second entry from
B:
A × B = {(a, b) : a ∈A, b ∈B}.
If A and B are rings or groups, we can place a ring (Example 6.10) or group (Section 222.4)
structure on A × B.
Numbers
N is the set of positive integers (or counting numbers), Z is the set of all integers, and Q is
the set of rational numbers (Chapter 1).
For integers a, b and positive integer n, a ≡b (mod n) means that a and b are congruent
modulo n (Chapter 3).
R is the set of real numbers, and C is the set of complex numbers (Exercise 6.11 and Section
8.5). S is the unit circle, the set of complex numbers of length one (Example 19.14.)
K is the set of constructible numbers (Section 36.2), and A is the set of algebraic numbers
(Exercise 41.4).
Functions
det(A) is the determinant, which is a real-valued function deﬁned on square matrices (Ex-
ample 22.5).
deg(f) is the degree of the polynomial f (Section 4.1). cont f is the content of a polynomial
f ∈Z[x] (Section 34.3).
φ(n) is Euler’s phi function (Exercise 24.15).
525

526
Guide to Notation
gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor, for integers, polynomials, or Euclidean domains
(Section 2.2, Section 4.6, Exercise 35.4). Likewise, lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple
(Exercise 2.11).
|α| is the ordinary absolute value, if α is a real number; it is the modulus if α is complex
(Section 8.5). arg(α) is the argument of the complex number (Section 8.5).
We use several important functions from calculus: the natural logarithm log(x), the expo-
nential function exp(x) = ex and the trigonometric functions sin(x), cos(x), tan(x) etc.
Rings
In what follows, assume that R is a ring and F is a ﬁeld.
Zn is the ring of integers, modulo n (Chapter 3 and Example 6.4). Of course, we also can
consider it as a cyclic group (Example 19.4 and Example 21.18). R[x] is the ring of polyno-
mials in indeterminate x and coeﬃcients from the ring R (see Exercise 6.23); particularly
important are Q[x] and Z[x] (Chapters 4 and 5), and F[x], where F is a ﬁeld (Chapter 9).
Q[x, y] is the ring of polynomials in two indeterminates x, y (Exercise 9.31).
Z[i] is the ring of Gaussian integers (Exercise 6.12); more generally, Z[√n] is a quadratic
extension of the integers (Section 31.1). These rings are equipped with a norm function
N(α) (Section 31.2).
M2(R) is the ring of 2 × 2 matrices, with entries from the ring R; see Example 6.13 and
Exercise 6.8.
For any set X, P(X) is the set of all subsets of X; it is called the power set and can be
made into a ring (Exercise 6.20).
C[0, 1] is the ring of all real-valued continuous functions on the unit interval (Example 6.14).
If I is an ideal of the ring R, then R/I is the ring of cosets, modulo I (see Section 19.2).
U(R) is the group of units of the ring R (Section 8.2 and Section 19.3). For a ﬁeld F, we
denote U(F) by F ∗= F\{0} (Section 19.3).
If ϕ is a (ring or group) homomorphism, then ker(ϕ) is its kernel (Section 12.1 and Section
26.1).
Given a ∈R, ⟨a⟩is the principal ideal generated by a (Section 9.1). More generally,
⟨a1, · · · , an⟩is the ideal generated by the ai (Exercise 9.12).
N(R) is the nilradical of R (Exercise 7.15).
Z(R) is the center of R (Exercise 7.12).
Groups
In what follows, assume that G is a group.
Dn is the nth dihedral group, the group of symmetries of the regular n-gon (Section 17.2
and Exercise 20.29).
Sn is the nth symmetric group, the group of permutations of a set of n elements (Section
18.2). An is the alternating group, the subgroup of Sn consisting of the even permutations
(Chapter 27).
Q8 is the group of quaternions (Example 19.16). See Exercise 21.12 for our usual notation.
Ha and aH are right and left cosets of the subgroup H of the multiplicative group G
(Section 24.2 and Section 25.1). Additive cosets look like H + a or a + H.
G/H is the group of cosets for G with normal subgroup H (Section 25.2).
[G : H] is the index of the subgroup H in G; that is, it is the number of distinct cosets H
has (Section 24.2).
⟨a⟩is the cyclic subgroup of G generated by g (Section 21.3).
For g ∈G, o(g) is the order of the element g (Section 21.1).
End(G) is the endomorphism ring for the group G (Exercise 22.14).
Z(G) is the center of G (Exercise 20.16).

Guide to Notation
527
Orb(x) is the orbit of x (Section 28.2).
Stab(x) is the stabilizer of x (Section 28.2).
Fix(g) is the set of ﬁxed points of g (Section 28.2).
Fields
If F is a ﬁeld, F(α) is a simple extension — the smallest ﬁeld containing F and α (Sections
42.2 and 42.3).
For ﬁelds F ⊆E, [E : F] is the degree of the ﬁeld extension: The dimension of E as an
F-vector space (Section 43.1).
Aut(R) is the automorphism group of the ring R (Example 19.21). Gal(E|F) is the Galois
group of E over F (Section 46.1).
GF(pn) is the Galois ﬁeld with pn elements (Section 45.1).
