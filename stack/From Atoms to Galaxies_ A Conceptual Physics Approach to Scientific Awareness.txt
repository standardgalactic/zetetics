appearance of the latter in the subtitle does not imply any reduction of its signiﬁcance. I
could have easily titled the book, “SCIENTIFIC AWARENESS via a tour of conceptual
physics.” In fact, my primary reasons for writing this book and developing the courses out
of which it grew, were the disheartening status of the scientiﬁc literacy of students, the
teaching of pseudoscientiﬁc ideas in some departments on many university campuses, and
lack of evidence for the eﬀectiveness of what has been done to raise the scientiﬁc awareness
of students and the general public.
The exponential growth of physics, chemistry, and biology in the nineteenth century
brought science to such a level of prominence that the educators and intellectuals of that
era could no longer ignore it, and felt an obligation to incorporate it in school curricula. The
emergence of diﬀerent philosophies of education and science shaped the nature and variety
of this incorporation, and provided a platform on which the intellectuals of the period could
debate. One of these intellectuals was Henry Adams, who wrote:
The future of Thought, and therefore of History, lies in the hands of the physicists, and
. . . the future historian must seek his education in the world of mathematical physics.
A new generation must be brought up to think by new methods, and if our historical
departments in the Universities cannot enter this next phase, the physical departments
will have to assume this task alone.1
Henry Adams was a nineteenth century American historian, journalist, and philosopher,
who grasped the value and power of a solid scientiﬁc education for all citizens, including
the teachers of humanities in the universities. Unfortunately his inspiring voice was drowned
by the raucous row of relativism, neo-positivism, progressivism, constructivism, and a host
of other antiscientiﬁc philosophical “-isms” pursued on campuses and inculcated in our
students.
Although most of the faculty in the humanities and social sciences do genuine, useful
research, some scholars cross the boundaries and step into controversial, often pseudo- and
anti-scientiﬁc, areas. Scholars like the educational psychologist who thinks that students
need to learn how to decide which life insurance to buy and how interest rates determine
home mortgages, rather than acquire scientiﬁc and mathematical skills; the sociologist who
proclaims that the contents of scientiﬁc theories are dependent on the social conditions in
which they were discovered; the Freudian who touts the pseudoscience of psychoanalysis as
science, and to prove his point, claims that M¨obius strip “explains many things about the
structure of mental disease;” the medical doctor who, in his attempt at unifying quantum
physics and Ayurveda, ﬁnds a sugar molecule intelligent; the mystagogue who “discovers”
a parallel between the occult Eastern philosophy and modern physics; and the historian of

Preface
science who gives equal weight to quantum theory—whose validity has been tested in a mul-
titude of harsh experiments—and Aristotelian “dynamics”—which is a collection of (mostly
false) philosophical statements—thereby devaluing all scientiﬁc theories and claiming that
“knowledge is relative” and “any knowledge is true.”
College students have become alarmingly illiterate in science. In a recent survey of 439
college students2 in the United States, 56% believed in psychic or spiritual healing; 40%
believed in haunted houses; 40% believed that people can be possessed by the devil; and
39% believed in ghosts and the return of the spirits of the dead. And the number of years
a student spends in college does not improve his/her literacy. In fact, as if proving the
eﬀectiveness of the anti-science scholars’ teachings, there is an increase in the paranormal
belief from freshmen to upper-level students: 23% of freshmen believe in the paranormal
compared to 31% of seniors and 34% of graduate students!
Physics has a unique place in the community of sciences: post-Renaissance physicists
(re)discovered the scientiﬁc methodology; physics is the science that investigates the funda-
mental questions concerning space, time, and matter, and as such, deals more directly with
questions having a philosophical overtone; the instrumentation developed by physicists is in-
dispensable in the breakthroughs of other sciences; and many results obtained by physicists
become cornerstones of other sciences. Because of this unique position, physics can play a
signiﬁcant role in improving scientiﬁc awareness. For this to happen, we ﬁrst have to equip
the public with a good appreciation of the natural laws and how they govern the orderly
phenomena of the universe. Through a detailed examination of the physical ideas (con-
ceptual, theoretical, experimental, historical, philosophical, etc.) using clear explanations,
numerous examples, and repeated usage, I have tried to accomplish this task.
But this detailed treatment by itself is not suﬃcient, as many educators have realized.
The general public mostly (although not exclusively) wants physics to relate to its everyday
life. Unfortunately, this relation has been equated to relevance, which nowadays gets easily
translated into technological wizardry and entertainment. This tendency has become so
predominant among the advocates of relevance in physics education that any idea that is
not “fun,” or “hands-on,” or is not relevant to the operation of a TV, a CD player, a
computer, or the special eﬀects in a movie, is discarded.
The overemphasis on entertainment and technology has two detrimental consequences.
On the one hand, students are willy-nilly, led to expect high quality entertainment from the
physics educators. They are bound to compare any technological presentation of physics
with the myriad technological presentations to which they are constantly exposed. They
will set the simple animated simulation of the application of the Bernoulli principle in the
ﬂight of an airplane against the meticulous and highly sophisticated animation of the ﬂight
of a ﬁghter jet in Pixar movies. And it is clear who the loser is in this comparison!
On the other hand, the minimally qualiﬁed physics teachers—of whom there is no short-
age, especially in the rural districts—see only the last word in the highly overused phrase
“science and technology,” and make a very narrow-minded interpretation of it. Combined
with “relevance” and entertainment, this interpretation turns a high school physics class
in the American Midwest into a showing of the movie Forrest Gump because of its highly
sophisticated use of computer graphics technology!
There is another aspect of “relevance” not explored by the educators of physics: the
exposure of students to pseudoscientiﬁc ideas. Such an exposure is very “relevant” to the
formation of the intellect of the exposed, and to the society in which they live. A society,
some of whose institutions of higher learning teach its citizens that chiropractic is a viable
alternative to scientiﬁc medicine, that psychoanalysis is science, that scientiﬁc truth is
not diﬀerent from religious and philosophical truth, and that objectivity does not exist
in science, is in danger of entering a Dark Age. I have diligently pursued this aspect of
“relevance” throughout my book: in the last chapter of each part, in Chapters 2 and 35, in

Preface
xxiii
the entire Part IX, and in discussions designated by the symbol
Food for Thought
.
The dominant educational philosophy in America, pragmatism, coupled with the inher-
ent diﬃculty of physics, has forced the well-trained and qualiﬁed teachers, and encouraged
the ill-trained and unqualiﬁed teachers of physics to overemphasize its utility in their in-
struction. Even the pupils are trained to ask, “What is physics good for?” although the
same question could be asked of many other disciplines, including music, art, literature,
and poetry.
There were many occasions in writing this book on which I was tempted to expound on
the everyday application of physics. But I resisted that temptation, not because there are
already numerous books devoted to that subject, but, more importantly, because I think
that the reader should be given the opportunity to appreciate physics, not for its pragmatic
utility, but for its inner beauty. Instead of asking for a practical application of a newly
discovered particle, the reader—it is my hope—will be enlightened by the power of the
theory which predicts the particle (along with a detailed speciﬁcation of all its properties),
and the ingenuity of the experimentalists who will ultimately discover it.
The question of what the best solution is to the urgent problem of raising the scientiﬁc
awareness of the public has no easy answer. Some educators believe that feeding the public
a lot of practically oriented facts about such topics as health, climate, environment, and
technology will make the citizenry more scientiﬁcally literate. Others, at the other extreme,
believe that the teaching of the scientiﬁc method, of “how science works,” is more eﬀective.
Whether any of these attempts has produced any results is debatable. The polls do not
show any improvement in the scientiﬁc literacy of the public. In fact, if anything, they
indicate an opposite trend.
If the belief in, and practice of, pseudoscience and anti-science is a symptom of scientiﬁc
illiteracy, then controverting this belief and practice is the ﬁrst step in the direction of
raising scientiﬁc awareness. Many excellent books, aimed at general readers, have been
written to address this issue. However, a classroom textbook, which teachers can use not
only to cover scientiﬁc topics, but also to use those topics to disprove unscientiﬁc claims,
has been lacking. This book is a modest attempt at ﬁlling the void. Because it is a ﬁrst
attempt, the book has much room for improvement, and I’ll be deeply indebted to those
readers and adopters who send me their comments and suggestions.
What would be the appropriate content of a physics textbook which aims at raising the
scientiﬁc awareness of the untrained reader? It would lay the foundation of the laws that
govern our universe in a nontechnical way, at the same time that it provides a healthy dose
of technical detail for those who have suﬃcient background and desire to see it; it would
emphasize the topics that excite the mind; it would, whenever possible, use physics to expose
the sand upon which most unscientiﬁc beliefs stand; it would outline the methods developed
by physicists for scientiﬁc investigation of nature, and contrast them with those developed
by the outsiders who claim to be the owners of scientiﬁc methodology; ﬁnally, it would
convince the reader that science is the only element capable of advancing technology, at the
same time that it distinguishes between the two. Here is how I have tried to accomplish
these goals:
• Modern physics: Over half of the book is devoted to quantum physics, relativity,
nuclear and particle physics, gauge theory, quantum ﬁeld theory, quarks and leptons,
and cosmology. The coverage of these topics not only excites the mind, but is also nec-
essary for uncovering the abuse made of them by the gurus of the New Age Movement
and some academic scholars.
• New Agers’ mysticism: The New Age Movement has become a viable alternative
to the traditional spirituality, and because it has no rigid authority, it appeals to the
more educated public. To make it even more appealing, the New Age gurus borrow
words from modern physics to cloak their unfounded beliefs in scientiﬁc garments.

xxiv
Preface
I have carefully analyzed some of these beliefs, and shown how a good understand-
ing of physics reveals their baselessness, regardless of the amount of modern-physics
terminology used in them.
• Emphasis on concepts: Technical and mathematical details have been avoided and
conceptual understanding emphasized, so that readers with little math background,
the intended audience of the book, can appreciate the basic principles of physics.
• The enclosed CD: Nature speaks in the language of mathematics. The more math-
ematics you know, the better you can understand nature. Conceptual physics is a
“translation” of this language, and, as such, is limited in its capacity to convey the
true meaning and beauty of the poetry of this language, physics. While this limitation
is unavoidable for the maximally non-technical readers, it is possible to communicate
some of this poetry using high school algebra. The accompanying CD, referred to in
the book as Appendix.pdf, provides a great deal of algebraic details for the readers
who have both the background and the desire to see them.
• Science and technology: In advancing the scientiﬁc awareness of the public, it is
absolutely vital to make a clear distinction between science and technology. And this
is not simply because the popular media identify the two and limit their coverage
almost exclusively to technology, but also because many academic scholars who study
the impact of society, politics, economics, and culture on science and vice versa make
the same identiﬁcation and come up with faulty conclusions. The last part of the book
is devoted to the characteristics of science in general, and the distinction between
science and technology, in particular.
• Philosophy of science: To the scholars of humanities, philosophers of science are
the arbiters of scientiﬁc methodology. The medley of the philosophies of science, which
often contradict each other, makes the message delivered by the philosophers utterly
confusing, and allows the scholars of humanities to draw erroneous conclusions about
science. Scattered throughout the book (mostly in Food for Thought and Epilogue
segments) are in-depth discussions of these messages, clearly pointing out their errors.
• Pseudoscience: Whether it is psychoanalysis, chiropractic, or alternative medicine,
pseudoscience has crept into the college campuses at an unprecedented rate.
An
exposure of these disciplines is essential in making students scientiﬁcally aware, and
the book contains many detailed discussions of them in Food for Thought segments
and the last chapter.
In promoting scientiﬁc awareness in this book, I have diﬀerentiated between the unsci-
entiﬁc or even antiscientiﬁc beliefs of an individual and the publicized and published ideas
degrading science. The individual beliefs may (and sometimes do) have constructive results
for the believer. I do not look down on anybody’s submission to acupuncture, chiropractic,
psychoanalysis, faith healing, or any religious, spiritual, and New Age beliefs.3 But when
these beliefs are publicized as alternatives to science, I have had no hesitation in the book
to expose them. It is one thing for an alternative medical doctor to treat patients with
herbal drugs, voodoo, or shamanism; it is quite another to write a book about the practice,
universalize treatments that work on some people (as much as placebo works on them),
and attack scientiﬁc medicine. It is one thing to go to a church, synagogue, mosque, or
New Age retreat to attain inner peace; it is quite another to advertise “intelligent design”
3The use of the label designating a group in my critical analyses should not be interpreted as a critique of
the individuals in that group. The labels, whenever mentioned in the book, refer to the leaders, publicizers,
and “theorists” of those groups. For example, “New Agers” refers to the authors and leaders of the New
Age Movement, not to individuals who believe in and practice its teaching.

as an alternative to the theory of evolution, or to muddle up modern physics and Eastern
mysticism.
This book is the product of many years of intensive work and research, which would
not have been possible without the support of my family: my wife Sarah, and my children
Dane and Daisy, and I thank them for it. I would like to especially thank Sarah for her
selﬂess encouragement, for the countless sacriﬁces she has made over the years we have been
together, and for reading the entire manuscript meticulously and giving numerous helpful
comments and suggestions. I would also like to thank my editor at T&F/CRC, John Navas,
for noticing the potential of the book, providing much valuable advice, and seeing through
its seamless production.

Note to the Reader
This book goes against the philosophy that the only physics worth learning is that which
can be applied to the making of a cell phone, high deﬁnition TV, computer, SUV, or movie
ﬁlled with graphics trickery. It does not glorify the pragmatic aspect of physics. Rather, it
talks about some of the great ideas that have deﬁned our era; about the inner workings of
that magniﬁcent enterprise of our race, science; about the power of theoretical prediction
and the delight of experimental conﬁrmation; about the lives of the people who discovered
the path to truth; and most importantly about how science, in general, and physics, in
particular, can identify and combat the irrationality that is sometimes cloaked in scientiﬁc
garment.
The collection of detailed explanations using occasional formulas, and a multitude of
explanatory line-drawn ﬁgures and examples in the text, plus glossaries, review questions,
conceptual exercises, numerical examples, and mathematical notes at the end of each chapter
or in appendices, qualiﬁes this tome as a textbook. However, by moving the (more diﬃcult)
numerical examples, numerical exercises, and mathematical notes to appendices—and using
the results obtained there only when necessary—I have made the book more easily accessible
to a general reader, who has a background in mathematics at the level of high school algebra,
with the caveat that sections whose headings are highlighted are a little more technical
than the rest of the book, and can be skipped on the ﬁrst reading.
Although the highest level of math used is high school algebra, the book can be read
at several diﬀerent levels. If you like math and want to see the technical reasoning behind
ideas introduced in the text, refer to the Math Notes, Numerical Examples, and Numerical
Exercises in the appendix provided on the enclosed CD. If mathematics comes fairly natu-
rally to you but you are not a math buﬀ, go over the mathematical discussions while reading
the text and look at some of the numerical examples, spending as much time on them as
you please, but avoid getting frustrated, as the text material is independent of the level
of your understanding of the technical stuﬀ. If you have absolutely no inclination toward
technicalities, skim through formulas, numerical examples, mathematical discussions, etc.
Regardless of your level of mathematical sophistication, however, I urge you to pay atten-
tion to Food for Thoughts, the epilogues at the end of each part, the nontechnical chapters
such as Chapters 2 and 35, and the entire Part IX. These are the discussions that you
normally don’t see in any other physics book and may shed a new light on how you view
the world.
I hope that after you read the book, you will not only understand the rational laws
governing our universe, past and present, but also be able to identify the unreason that
surrounds us in various shapes and forms, and consumes a substantial portion of our global
resources.


Note to the Instructor
The level—and therefore the content—of “science literacy” courses diﬀers greatly from
instructor to instructor and class to class. Even if we agree on the theme of the course,
some of us may want to stress the technical and mathematical aspect of concepts at one
extreme, while others may ﬁnd it more useful to emphasize the social, philosophical, and
methodological implication of concepts at the other extreme.
I have written the book
in such a way that these two extremes, as well as the approaches in the middle, can be
accommodated with no diﬃculty.
The theme of this book, as outlined in the preface, is the beliefs that contradict science
and are often oﬀered as replacements for science. Within the framework of this theme, I
can envision at least three types of courses for which this book may be suitable:
• A discussion/reading-laden course, which puts little emphasis on physics at the same
time that it spotlights the role of physics in disproving many unfounded pseudo- and
anti-scientiﬁc beliefs propagated by the laymen as well as academic professionals. For
such a course, I recommend a fairly detailed coverage of the entire Part I, since it
examines the emergence of science and the scientiﬁc methodology. Once this part
is covered, a sample of Epilogue and Food for Thought writings, accompanied by as
much physics as the instructor feels necessary, could be explored. This sample may
be chosen from any parts of the book, with the caveat that some discussion of the
physics of those parts may be necessary. I also highly recommend Chapter 35, as it
is a fairly elaborate refutation of some trendsetting abuses of modern physics by the
gurus of the New Age Movement. Once these topics are covered, the three chapters
in the last part of the book would be ideal to end the course. Although this course
would be best suited for a small class, using the on-line teaching tools and software,
it could also be adopted for much larger classes.
• A course in which physical concepts, especially those of modern physics, are studied
with a little mathematical rigor. Students in this course learn the concepts and apply
them to simple new situations by doing some conceptual as well as numerical exercises.
Although the emphasis is slightly shifted from the course described in the ﬁrst bullet,
this shift of emphasis should not result in a huge reduction of discussion/reading.
For this course, I recommend a fairly detailed coverage of Parts I and II, selections
from Parts III and IV, and some in-depth coverage of one of Parts V to VIII. The
instructor can assign readings from Epilogue and Food for Thought segments, as well
as the nontechnical Chapters 2, 35, 41, 42, and 43. These readings can be material for
short quizzes at the beginning of each session. Ideally, these quizzes are taken with
“clickers,” which are becoming increasingly popular.
• The course described in the second bullet could be made more rigorous by the imple-
mentation of some mathematics (not surpassing high school algebra) and using the CD

Note to the Instructor
provided. In this course, a good amount of emphasis would be placed on the technical-
ities behind the concepts, more numerical examples and exercises would be assigned,
and the instructor would spend more time on the mathematical details. However, I
do not recommend completely abandoning the reading/discussions described in the
ﬁrst and second bullets. To remain true to the subtitle of the book, the instructor is
encouraged to cover some Epilogue and Food for Thought segments, and nontechnical
chapters.
There is suﬃcient ﬂexibility in the topics and style of coverage to allow instructors to
design courses that match the need and technical level of their students. A physics course,
concentrating entirely on physical concepts with no coverage of the “awareness” component
of the book is also possible. However, the alarming statistics given in the preface should
be suﬃcient motivation for the instructor to season that course with at least some readings
from the nontechnical material of the book.
Pedagogy is an important part of our job as instructors of physics. The assortment of
pedagogical approaches to the teaching of physics, some of which have entered our discipline
from outside, can deter the honest eﬀort of some instructors and reduce the eﬀectiveness
of their teaching. That is why, on occasions, I have engaged in discussions of the merits
of some pedagogical approaches and faults of others.
I hope that such discussions will
stimulate fruitful dialogues at least among the instructors using this book, if not among the
larger teaching community.
As an instructor of a course taught out of this book, you have access to some useful
resources. A test bank with well over 1500 class-tested multiple choice questions facilitates
designing quizzes and exams. A set of animated interactive movie presentations—covering
a wide range of topics, including the emergence of science in the ancient civilizations, as-
tronomy, motion, electromagnetism, and quantum physics—arouses the interest of students
in learning. Among these presentations are The Energetics of Santa Claus, where the im-
plausibility of Santa Claus’s motion is demonstrated using energy conservation; Gravity,
where the universal gravitational constant of a hypothetical universe can be measured; and
Kepler’s Laws, where Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion are eﬀectively demonstrated
and his third law can be fairly accurately veriﬁed with the whole class participating. My stu-
dents have invariably found these presentations the most favorite part of the course. Web
quizzes consisting of a huge number of questions, which students can take multiple times
and at their own pace—each time with a diﬀerent (random) content—enhance students’
learning ability through repetition. Clicker quizzes, drawn primarily from the “aware-
ness” component of the book, are fast and eﬃcient tools of ensuring that students become
aware of the nature, relevance, and importance of science. Students are given a reading
assignment (typically a page or two from the Food for Thought segments, Epilogues, or the
last three chapters of the book) a couple of days in advance, and later tested using clickers,
or any other means deemed appropriate by the instructor.

Chapter1
Science Kindles
1.1
The Beginning
Science has its origin in the foggy horizon of time.
Ever since the dawn of civilization
humankind’s curiosity has led them to observe, ponder, speculate, induce, and deduce. This
curiosity tried to make sense out of the objects of their experience: trees, animals, rivers,
forests, mountains, . . . Sun, Moon, the stars, . . . rain, wind, tornado, blizzard, storm. . . .
In their primitive classiﬁcation scheme, humans may have subconsciously divided all such
things into three large categories: terrestrial, celestial, and “in-between.” The ﬁrst category
consisted of objects and creatures that they could touch, feel, see, and understand. The
second category was even more understandable because there was a conspicuous regularity
in it which made the humankind comfortably knowledgeable of the sky, and, thus, at ease
with it. Everything in this category seemed to be moving; and any motion requires a mover,
a live mover. Therefore, the sky must be brimming with creatures!
It was the third category that caused discomfort and uncertainty. And since unpre-
dictability interfered with their essential day-to-day activities, humankind sought ways of
controlling it. After some unsuccessful attempts at solving the problem head on (for ex-
ample, by climbing mountains and physically and verbally challenging the source of the
uncertainty), they probably decided to open a dialog—a channel of communication—with
the forces of the whimsical third category. The occurrences of this category seemed to orig-
inate from the sky, and the sky appeared to be the seat of regularity. Therefore, humankind
saw some hope in taming the unpredictable by communicating with the predictable. But
how?
A direct communication seemed ineﬀective as the sky was too far away and no detectable
source of the unpredictable seemed in sight. The next best idea was to create images of
the heavenly “creatures” and communicate with those images. The physical appearance of

the images was left to the imagination of humankind: a horse with the head of a man, a
woman with many hands, a four-legged animal with the head of an eagle, or a man with
the head of an animal. The ineﬀectiveness of communication with the images did not cause
the abandonment of the entire idea; it only led to changing the images and the content of
communications, hence the variety of idols and prayers.
Communication with the creatures in the sky through their images on Earth required
an extraordinary imagination and an unusual mental capability. Thus the brightest and
most devoted people of society were given the task of communicating with the idols, and
they would receive the support and encouragement from the rest of the community. This
division of labor created the ﬁrst priests whose job was not only to develop the best way
to communicate with the images, but, as it was soon realized, to observe the seat of their

source, the sky. So, the priests were also the ﬁrst astronomers. However, the ultimate
Astrology is but a form
of superstition.
purpose of sky-watching was to control the events on Earth, and in this capacity, astronomy
and astrology were the two sides of the same coin.1
What do you know? 1.1. If you wanted to go to “college” in ancient Egypt and
Babylon, to what institution would you go?
In their attempt to understand the gods in heaven the priests must have discovered some
connections between the events in the sky and certain occurrences on Earth. For example,
the ancient Egyptian priesthood noticed that the annual ﬂooding of the Nile coincided
with the rising of the Star Sirius. Such astronomical observations were also prompted by
terrestrial needs such as the prediction of the ﬂood, harvesting seasons, seasonal changes
in the climate, et cetera. Thus, early astronomy was intimately mixed with the spiritual
curiosity and the practical motivations of the ancient priesthood.
Looking at the sky, the priests could not help but notice the two most conspicuous
objects: the Sun and the Moon. The daily regularity of these objects could not have escaped
the attention of even the earliest priests. That is why calendar is as old as civilization itself.
This regularity, together with other attributes, such as the warmth and the luminosity of
the Sun and its inﬂuence on life and seasonal changes, bestowed upon it a unique place in
some myths and religions of the world. In Egypt, for instance, where, for centuries, the dry
land has been baking beneath a hot cloudless blue sky during the day and shivering in a
bitter cold dark night in which stars glitter like shards of ice, the day has the warmth and
the bustling of life, the night, the coldness, and the silence of death. It is thus only natural
that in the Egyptian pantheon, the Sun is elevated to the rank of God itself in the person
of Ra, the Sun God.
What do you know? 1.2. There is one thing that connects human activity to the
occurrence of celestial events. What is that?
In Babylon, on the other hand, where the silt of Tigris and Euphrates deposited at the
mouth of the Persian Gulf pushed the shores of the civilization further and further into the
capricious sea, and unpredictable rain ﬂooding of the rivers destroyed entire civilizations in
a seemingly chaotic fashion, the supreme being is capable of inﬁnite wisdom and calming
spells. Thus, Ea, the supreme god of Mesopotamia, “. . . skillfully made his overpowering
sacred spell. Reciting it, he cast it on the water (on Apsu), poured slumber over him, so
that he soundly slept.”2
Somewhere far removed from today’s world of specialization, in the valley of Tigris and
Euphrates in the ancient Babylon, at a time when priests were scientists and scientists
were priests, the monks of the temple of Ea resolved that to understand their god, they
needed to study His habitat, the sky. And the science of Babylonian astronomy was born.
Babylonian clergy developed a sophisticated catalog of the motion of the Sun, the Moon
and the planets, so that they could not only predict the location of these bodies among
the stars, but also the recurrence of lunar eclipses, without, as far as we know, any kind of
geometrical theory of the celestial motions.
1Astrology, the claim that earthly happenings are related to, and can be controlled by, heavenly motions,
was the start of astronomy, the science of the observation and theoretical understanding of the celestial
objects.
Astrology had supporters among respected scientists such as Kepler well into the seventeenth
century. However, today it is only a superstition practiced by fortune tellers and palm readers, and has
absolutely no sound foundations in spite of the fact that many people, including some noted leaders and
politicians, base their action on it.

the Universe and how the present world order was established.

Section 1.1
The Beginning

Farther north, the Egyptian monks had developed their own version of astronomy. They
imagined the whole universe to be like a large box. The Earth formed the bottom of this box
with Egypt at its center. The sky stretched over it like a ceiling, its earthward face sprinkled
with lamps lit at night and extinguished during the day. This ceiling was supported by four
lofty mountain peaks connected by a continuous chain of mountains. On the other side of
this mountain chain, hidden from us, a great river ﬂowed. The Nile was a branch of this
river, turning oﬀfrom it at its southern bend. The river carried a boat in which was a disc
of ﬁre, the Sun, the living god Ra. This boat was occasionally attacked by a huge serpent
during the day, whereby the Sun was eclipsed for a short time.
The two cradles of civilization, Babylon and Egypt, began the observational astronomy,
and the cradle of the Western civilization, Greece, embarked on the geometrical explanation
of the subject. Not unlike the two older civilizations, early Greek cosmology is rooted in
mythology, especially as described in such epic poems as Iliad and Odyssey by Homer
who is said to have lived in the eighth century BC Although alterations were made to
this cosmic mythology by the later generations, no “scientiﬁc” theories or explanations
were forthcoming until the middle of the sixth century BC when the giant of early Greek
philosophy, Pythagoras, stepped onto the stage.
Food for Thought
FFT 1.1.1. The ancient unity of science and religion has become a modern source of confusion and
misuse. Certain philosophers and followers of the Eastern mysticism argue that, because science
and religion were one and the same in early civilizations, they should be reunited now as well.
They lament the separation of modern science from religion and advise the scientists to change
course and methodology to make science more amiable to religion. They beguile their readers into
thinking that there is a connection between modern science and the old mysticism (see Chapter 35
for a detailed examination of this beguilement).
The truth is that the connection between science and religion existed up to about 600 BC only
because science was at its infancy. Starting with Socrates and Plato in Greece (and apparently only
in Greece), religion came under rational scrutiny, and from a philosophical and logical perspective,
found to be full of contradictions. And from that point on, the gap between religion and science
inevitably grew wider and wider.
While the Egyptian and Babylonian priests attached deities to the motion of celestial bodies,
Greek astronomers sought a purely logical explanation for the motion of planets and stars, engaging
and inventing more and more mathematics as they went along, and disengaging the Greek gods
farther and farther from the objects of their study. Only such a strong separation between the
gods and the stars made the progress of astronomy and science possible. This separation was the
strongest in Greece, making the scientiﬁc progress uniquely Greek. No other ancient civilization
made this separation, and therefore, no other civilization became capable of producing abstract
thoughts such as geometry and theoretical astronomy.
The insistence that modern science and religion unite makes absolutely no sense and is tanta-
mount to the abandonment of science altogether. The recent acceptance by the Catholic church
of the theory of evolution is not to be considered a uniﬁcation of science and religion; it made
neither a science out of Catholicism nor a religion out of evolution. It was a concession forced on a
pragmatically responsive church by the weight of countless bits of evidence accumulated over 150
years. The more idealistic sects cannot (and will not) ﬁnd any compromise between the science of
evolution and the religious dogma of “intelligent design.”
While the Catholic church accepts the theory of evolution, some scientists, especially physicists,
are lured to a prize worth over a million dollars and given annually to scholars who can ﬁnd a
connection between science and religion. The Templeton Prize was initially the Templeton Prize
for Progress in Religion, and the ﬁrst winner in 1973 was Mother Teresa. Since then winners have
included Billy Graham, Charles Colson (of Watergate fame), and believers of other faiths. But in
1999 Ian Barbour, a student of Fermi and a professor of physics and theology at Carleton College,

was the recipient. He was given the award for initiating a “dialog between science and religion.”
Templeton, a billionaire who believes that God has chosen him to show the world that theology
and science are “two windows on the same landscape,” admired Barbour, and coveted his dialog.
So Templeton changed the name to the Templeton Prize for Research or Discoveries about
Spiritual Realities. It is the largest prize for intellectual accomplishment in existence, chosen to
be bigger than the Nobel. Since that time, seven of the last ten winners of the Templeton Prize
have been physicists!
Many scientists are practitioners of some form of religion, but they keep their profession apart
from their faith, because otherwise the obvious contradiction between the two can cause a lot of
mental pain for them. Abdus Salam was a devout moslem and a great physicist, a Nobel Laureate.
His profession never interfered with his faith and his religion never determined the course of his
research.
The only major inﬂuence of his faith on his profession was the establishment of the
International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, where physicists from developing
countries are given a chance to do ﬁrst-hand research. This is a far cry from “faith-based” physicists,
who, to win the million-dollar prize, advertise a fake relation between religion and science. They do
more damage to science than anti-science community because they are usually well-known scientists
in whom people have invested a trust.

Early Greek Astronomy
Of the several schools of philosophy in the earlier era of the Greek civilization, that of
Pythagoras is unique in many respects. He is said to have traveled a good deal to Egypt
and Babylon, and to have been indebted for much of his knowledge of science to what he
had learned during his travels.
Pythagorean philosophy is based on the primacy of numbers and the interpretation of
nature. All the followers of this philosophy appear to have been devoted to the cause of
science. To them, numbers were everything; they did not merely represent the relations
of the phenomena to each other, but were the substance of things and the cause of all
phenomena of nature. Pythagoras and his followers were led to this assumption by observing
how everything in nature was governed by numerical relations: the regularity of the celestial
motions, and the harmony of musical sounds.3 Pythagoreans believed that the world was
ruled by harmony, all the diﬀerent heavenly revolutions producing diﬀerent tones.
As for the heavenly bodies, Pythagoras coined the word “cosmos,” was the ﬁrst to
recognize that the morning and the evening stars were the same body, that the Moon was
a mirror-like body, and that the planets moved in separate orbits inclined to the celestial
equator. This is all that is attributed to Pythagoras himself. The Pythagorean school, of
course, ﬂourished far beyond the time of Pythagoras, and the theory of the cosmos taught
by his followers developed into one of the most ingenious theories of antiquity.
The leading idea of the Pythagorean system of the world is that the apparent daily rota-

tions of the starry heavens and the daily motion of the Sun are caused by the spherical Earth
being carried in twenty-four hours round the circumference of a circle. The Pythagoreans
thought that the nature of the Earth was too gross to make it ﬁt the exalted position oc-
cupying the center of the universe. In this commanding position they placed the central
ﬁre or the hearth of the universe round which the Earth and all the other heavenly bodies
moved uniformly in circular orbits.
Remarkably, this ﬁrst “scientiﬁc” theory of the heavens had the two main characteristics
of a good theory even by modern standards: simplicity and symmetry. One can say, in
fact, that Pythagoreans started the trend. Being well trained in the mathematics of their
time, they saw in spheres (or circles) a most symmetric and ﬂawless geometric ﬁgure, the
only ﬁgure matching the perfection of heaven. Similarly, uniformity constituted the simplest
assumption concerning the motion of the cosmic objects. Fortunately for Pythagoreans, the

nonuniformity of these objects (and thus, the discrepancy with their theory) was discovered
much later.4
The central ﬁre was not the only source of light and heat in the universe. The Sun re-
ceived its heat and light partly from the central ﬁre and partly from the ﬁre that surrounded
the sphere of the ﬁxed stars. Sun then scattered its light in all directions including to the
Moon, which in turn, reﬂected that sunlight in our direction. The faint glow on the entire
surface of the new Moon was a reﬂection of the light of the central ﬁre.
BIOGRAPHY
Pythagoras (ca. 580–ca. 500 BC) was born in Samos, settled in southern Italy about 540 or 530, and
died there about 500. A few years after the tyrant Polycrates seized control of the city of Samos (about
540 BC), Pythagoras went to Egypt, where he visited many of the temples and took part in many
discussions with the priests. In 525 BC Cambyses II, the king of Persia, invaded and conquered Egypt.
Pythagoras was taken prisoner and sent to Babylon. While he was in Babylon, he reached the acme
of perfection in arithmetic and music and the other mathematical sciences taught by the Babylonians.
Pythagoras left no writings of his own, but his school attracted a great deal of attention not only
because its members formed a religious-like brotherhood with unorthodox opinions, but also because
they became involved in politics, thereby subjecting themselves to persecution in Southern Italy.
The Pythagorean system was a very ingenious model of the workings of the cosmos.
It was also revolutionary in its assumption of the sphericity of the Earth and in the fact
that the Earth was moving just like the rest of the heavenly bodies. Unfortunately, this
model did not win any adherents outside the Pythagorean schools due to its philosophical
roots, and, in particular, the almost religious signiﬁcance the Pythagoreans attached to
numbers. Plato and Aristotle popularized a diﬀerent kind of astronomy. They placed the

Earth motionless at the center of the universe, and let everything else move around it. They
thought that each heavenly body was attached to a crystal sphere that rotated uniformly
about the Earth: one sphere for the Moon, one for the Sun, one for each of the ﬁve planets,
and one for the stars, making a total of eight heavenly crystal spheres.
Plato even gave a mystical ﬂavor to his astronomy in that he believed the cosmos to
be alive and to have a soul! Aristotle, Plato’s favorite student, contributed very little to
astronomy, and was of the same opinion as his mentor without the latter’s mysticism. This
motionless-Earth model was to inﬂuence—with very few exceptions—all astronomers for
almost 2000 years.
The subsequent generations of astronomers accumulated new data, and reexamined the
old Egyptian and Babylonian records. The result was the revelation of new features in the
sky, and the ﬁrst astronomer associated with these new features is Eudoxus of Knidus
(ca. 408 BC–ca. 355 BC). Eudoxus was only 23 when he went to Athens to attend Plato’s
lectures. However, he soon discovered Plato’s overemphasis on the mind, while Eudoxus
was convinced that experience could have powerful inﬂuence on mind’s invention. So, he
set oﬀto Egypt, where he received instruction from a priest of Hellopolls concerning the
planetary motions, and where he came across indications of irregularities in the motion of

came to be known as the retrograde motion seemed to topple the simple Pythagorean
idea of uniform motion.

on to the Pythagoreans.

Chapter 1

To account for this nonuniformity while keeping simplicity and symmetry of the theory,
Eudoxus assumed multiple spheres for each celestial body. According to this model, each
planet had several spheres, which were situated one inside the other, each rotating with
uniform speed about its own axis, which was oriented in a direction diﬀerent than the axes
of the other spheres. Because all these spheres were assumed to be concentric with the
Earth, the theory long afterwards became known as the homocentric model. The planet
was supposed to be situated on the equator of the innermost sphere which revolved with
uniform speed round its two poles. A variation of this model became the starting point of
the geocentric model to which we shall come back later.
1.3
The Age of Measurement
With the advance of geometry at the end of the fourth century BC, the time was ripe in
the third century BC for astronomers to pose new questions whose answers utilized this
new science. Astronomers were no longer content with mapping the location of the Sun and
the Moon in the sky. They wanted to see how far away they were. They were no longer
satisﬁed with the simple fact that the Earth was a sphere, but how big a sphere it was.
Two prominent ﬁgures of this period are Aristarchus and Eratosthenes.
1.3.1
Aristarchus’ Measurements: Heliocentrism
Motion is a very intricate concept that humankind could not unravel until the end of the
seventeenth century. One of the most diﬃcult aspects of the concept of motion is the fact
that it is relative. Due to the ubiquity of motion in the modern life we have all experienced
this relativity when, stopping at a corner waiting for the green light, we startle to see our
car move backwards. To prevent a collision with the car behind us, we slam on the brakes
only to realize that it was not our car that was moving but the car next to us that started
to move forward slowly.
Such a routine experience was nonexistent 2300 years ago, and it required a magniﬁcently
creative imagination to conjecture the relativity of motion. As early as the ﬁfth century
BC, there were philosophers, who, on purely hypothetical grounds, proposed that it was
the Earth which turned on its axis from west to east in twenty-four hours, and this motion
appeared as the daily rotation of the heavens from east to west. They also proposed the
revolution of some planets around the Sun.
While this old heliocentric model was based entirely on conjectures, it was Aristarchus
of Samos, ﬂourishing about 280 BC, who based his reasoning on the quantitative observation
of the heavenly bodies. From the shadow of the Earth on the Moon in a lunar eclipse,
Aristarchus could estimate the diameter of the Moon to be a third of the Earth’s diameter
(see Figure 1.1). This estimate was later reﬁned by Hipparchus to the more accurate value
of 0.27.
What do you know? 1.4. The following ﬁgure shows three hypothetical eclipses of
the Moon. Which one of the three pictures represents the smallest Earth? The largest
Earth?
Having found the size of the Moon, Aristarchus could now calculate the Earth-Moon
distance by measuring the angular size of the Moon (see Appendix B for details).
He
estimated the Earth-Moon distance to be 25 Earth diameters; an estimate that was later

improved by Hipparchus, who obtained 30 Earth diameters, very close to today’s accepted
value.
Aristarchus’ next task proved to be very diﬃcult. The calculation of the Earth–Sun
distance is complicated by its sheer enormity. Nevertheless Aristarchus’ procedure was so
ingenious, so simple, and so original that even a brief description of it can be testimony to
the magniﬁcent power of the human mind and its intimacy with the universe.
There are two half-moons in a single revolution of the Moon around the Earth. These
are called quarters because it is really a quarter of the Moon surface that is visible to
us.5 One is called the ﬁrst quarter and the other the third quarter (see Figure 1.2). By
measuring the time the Moon takes to go from the ﬁrst quarter to the third quarter and
comparing it with the time from the third quarter to the ﬁrst quarter, one can determine the
angle α in the ﬁgure, which in turn can be used to ﬁnd the Earth-Sun distance in terms of
the Earth-Moon distance. This idea is very clever theoretically, but in practice, extremely
diﬃcult to implement, because the diﬀerence between the two times is immeasurably small,
which, in turn is due to the fact that the Sun is very far (compared to the Earth-Moon
distance). Nevertheless, Aristarchus’ measurements led him to conclude that the Sun is
about 20 times farther away from Earth than the Moon (see the Math Note E.1.1 on
page 75 of Appendix.pdf for details).
What do you know? 1.5. The following ﬁgure shows three hypothetical locations of
the ﬁrst and third quarters of the Moon on its orbit around Earth. Which one of the
three pictures represents the farthest Sun? The nearest Sun? Is the Sun on the left or
on the right?

diameter of the Sun to be about seven times that of the Earth. He then argued that a small
object is more likely to go around a bigger object rather than vice versa. And this is how he
came up with the heliocentric model of the solar system!
The very few and scanty references to the system of Aristarchus by classical authors
indicate that the system was never favorably received.
Without a doubt, the principal
reason for the fall of the heliocentric idea was lack of evidence for Earth’s motion around
the Sun. Astronomers expected to be able to detect the eﬀect of this motion by observing the
angular displacement of stars in much the same way that we detect the angular displacement
of distant objects when we drive on a road. As we drive past a distant mountain on a
highway, we notice a change in our line of sight: the mountain is ﬁrst ahead of us, say to
our right, and after some time—the farther the mountain, the longer this time—it “moves”
directly to our right.
When no such displacement of stars was observed, heliocentrism
died. Aristarchus correctly reasoned that the stars must be much farther away than the
astronomers of the time believed. But his reasoning fell on deaf ears, as the stars were
thought to be only slightly farther away than the Sun.
BIOGRAPHY
Aristarchus of Samos (ca. 310 – ca. 230 BC) was born on the island of Samos, in Greece. He was
inﬂuenced by the Pythagorean Philolaus of Kroton, but in contrast to Philolaus he identiﬁed the central
ﬁre with the Sun and put other planets in correct order from the Sun. The only extant work attributed
to Aristarchus, On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon, is peculiar in that it assumes the
Sun’s diameter to be 2 degrees, rather than the correct value, 1/2 degree. The latter diameter is known
from Archimedes to have been Aristarchus’s actual value. Though the original text has been lost, a
reference in Archimedes’ book The Sand Reckoner describes another work by Aristarchus in which he
advanced an alternative hypothesis of the heliocentric model. The geocentric model, consistent with
planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the stellar parallax. The
rejection of the heliocentric view was common, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests On the
Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon: “Cleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the
Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety
for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe [i.e. the Earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain
at rest and the Earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own
axis.”
1.3.2
Eratosthenes and Size of Earth
When Alexander the Great died in 323 BC at the age of thirty three, he left a vast empire
to his feuding successors, who ﬁnally divided it into three parts, one of which was Egypt
which fell under the rule of Ptolemy I, who founded a dynasty in the new port of Alexandria.

Once Ptolemy established himself in the new country, he erected a magniﬁcent library and a
museum on the advice of one of Aristotle’s pupils. Although no trace of either building exists
now, we know that about a hundred scholars from all over the Mediterranean area lived

in the museum, and their work was generously supported by Ptolemy and his successors.
Teaching was relegated to second place and priority was given to research.
Dinners or
drinking parties, where solutions to problems were given and many literary prizes were
awarded, were another regular feature. In addition to excellently furnished quarters, the
Museum contained a communal dining hall, a covered colonnade with seats where the
lectures and discussions could take place.
When Ptolemy I died and his son Philadelphus succeeded him, a more vibrant director
was appointed, who further strengthened the library and museum. Under the new director-
ship, the museum attracted many learned men, among them Euclid whose famous treatise
The Thirteen Books of the Elements contained so sound and logical an exposition of ge-
ometry that it formed the basis of the teaching of the subject up to the beginning of the
twentieth century. It is Euclid who, during one of the museum’s discussions, is credited
“There is no royal road
to geometry.”
Euclid
with having replied to Ptolemy I who enquired about an easier way of learning geometry,
with the quip “there is no royal road to geometry.”
Astronomy and mathematics prospered at the museum, most notably by the eﬀorts of
its director, Eratosthenes, whose interests included not only those subjects, but also geog-
raphy and calendar studies. But his real claim to fame rests on his excellent determination
of the circumference of the Earth. At ﬁrst glance this measurement may sound an incredible
achievement for anyone in 240 BC, but in fact measurements of a similar kind had been
made before and were being carried out at the same time. The point about Eratosthenes’
measurement, and the reason why it is still remembered, is that his result is almost exactly
the same as our present-day value! Eratosthenes’ method is so simple and elegant that it
is well worth our eﬀort to get acquainted with it.
BIOGRAPHY
Eratosthenes (276–197 BC) was born in Cyrene on the southern shores of the Mediterranean.
It
was here that he received his early education before being attracted to Athens, where he studied for
several years at the Academy and the Lyceum, the school founded by Aristotle. Besides measuring
the circumference of the Earth, Eratosthenes made many other major contributions to the progress of
science. He worked out a calendar that included leap years, and he laid the foundations of a systematic
chronography of the world when he tried to give the dates of literary and political events from the time
of the siege of Troy. He is also said to have compiled an astronomy catalogue containing 675 stars. By
the time he was twenty-nine he had already gained some reputation and was invited by Ptolemy III to
go to Alexandria as tutor to his son. There he stayed for the rest of his long life, becoming director of
the museum ten years later and dying at the advanced age of eighty.

you can calculate the circumference of the Earth from a measurement of the distance P1P2.
In fact, the ratio of the Earth’s circumference to P1P2 is the same as the ratio of 360 degrees
to θ. Eratosthenes compared the angles from vertical at Syene and Alexandria, and noted
that they diﬀer by 7.2 degrees. The north-south distance between the two cities was 500
miles. So, he found the circumference of the Earth from

The Geocentric Model
The library and museum ﬂourished under Eratosthenes’ directorship, which continued
through three reigns, and attracted for a time Apollonius, a great mathematician and
astronomer who was some ten years Eratosthenes’ junior. Apollonius was a brilliant ge-
ometer, and most of his education, as his work itself, was carried out in Alexandria. It was
here that he discovered a novel way of combining circular motions to provide a real alter-
native to the spheres of Eudoxus. The motivation for this endeavor? The desire to invent
a theory that agreed with the new observations contradicting the homocentric theory.
A closer scrutiny of various planets, especially Mars, revealed that in their retrogression,

they shine more brightly. Astronomers attributed this to the approach of the planet towards
Earth. Homocentric theory could not account for this approach, as it aﬃxed the planets to
spheres concentric with Earth.
What Apollonius suggested was the brilliantly simple idea of making up a planet’s
motion from two or more circular motions built, as it were, on top of each other. Each

planet was considered as ﬁxed to the outside of a small circle, which spins about its center,
and at the same time moves around the edge of a larger circle. The small circle carrying the
planet was known as the epicycle (i.e., the upon-circle) and the larger one with the Earth
as its center as the deferent (the carrier). Figure 1.4 depicts a case in which the planet M
moves four times on its epicycle as the center of the epicycle completes a single revolution
on the deferent. Some snapshots of the motion of M around Earth are shown. As the planet
moves on the epicycle and the center of the epicycle on the deferent, the planet describes a
path which includes retrograde motion as well as the change in the brightness of the planet

be found in Math Note E.1.2 on page 75 of Appendix.pdf .
What do you know? 1.8. When the center of the epicycle is at the 11 o’clock position
of the deferent, the planet is at the 2 o’clock position of its epicycle. At what o’clock

10 and 11 o’clock of the deferent? Exactly half way between 2 and 3 o’clock of the
deferent?
The Alexandrian research center ﬂourished until about 220 BC, when the Ptolemies
became embroiled in political strife in Egypt, continuing for more than seventy years, during
which time many of the scholars in the museum left the country for Pergamum or other
centers of learning such as Athens, Antioch, or Rhodes. Among those who ﬂed Alexandria in
the great upheavals of 150 BC was Hipparchus of Nicaea, who is primarily remembered
for his observational work.
Following Aristarchus, he too tried to measure the relative
distances of the Sun and the Moon, although he was well aware that his precursor had been

dissatisﬁed with his results a century before.
However the fame of Hipparchus rests not on his measurement of the distances of the Sun
and the Moon, but on a much subtler kind of measurement, which he undertook successfully.
This arose out of his plan to make a catalogue of the positions of the stars, a task which he
accomplished after he left Alexandria and moved to the island of Rhodes. This catalogue
was the ﬁrst full list of viable stars ever to be compiled. Hipparchus was not content merely
to list the stars and their positions, he also speciﬁed their brightness, dividing them into
six ranges of intensity thus introducing a method which is fundamentally the same as that
still used today.
As far as we know, Hipparchus died on the island of Rhodes, perhaps in 120 BC, and with

him there ended, for over two centuries, the Greek tradition of astronomical observation
and speculation. Politically Rome was gaining in ascendancy, and it was not until well into
the early days of the Christian era that Claudius Ptolemy began his work and the next
(short) scene in the play of humankind’s quest to fathom the mystery of the Universe.
Ptolemy’s astronomical eﬀorts are enshrined in an immense tome called Almagest, which

14
Chapter 1

is regarded as the authoritative exposition of the geocentric model of the solar system.
In it, we ﬁnd a description of the full stature to which Greek astronomy attained and due
credit is given not only to Hipparchus but also to many other astronomers of earlier times.
Beginning with broad outlines, Ptolemy sides with Plato and Aristotle and accepts a
spherical Earth immovable in the center of a spherical Universe. This does not mean that
he casts away a Sun-centered Universe without due reﬂection; on the contrary he considers
the matter carefully but concludes that no observations of the stars reveal any of the eﬀects
to be expected if the Earth does, in fact, move in space.
BIOGRAPHY
Claudius Ptolemaius (85–165 AD) or Ptolemy, was born in the Greek city of Ptolemais. We know from
his writings that he ﬂourished in Alexandria between AD 127 and 151. This was a time when the Roman
empire stretched over the cultured Mediterranean world. Hadrian was emperor, and with his love of
culture inspired by Greek traditions, the intellectual climate was not unfavorable to scholarship. The
library at Alexandria was now ﬂourishing but scholarship consisted primarily of collating and assessing the
achievements of previous generations. This intellectual climate is reﬂected in Ptolemy’s works. Ptolemy
wrote not only on mathematics, but also on optics and astrology. But it is for his achievements in
geography and especially in astronomy that he is remembered, and it is in these two ﬁelds that his
inﬂuence on later generations was to be so profound.
Having given his readers the basic facts and then equipped them with a basic knowledge
of solid geometry, Ptolemy sets out to describe the motion of the Sun and the theory of the
Moon’s orbit. His work on the Moon is one of his highest achievements, for the problem
is essentially a diﬃcult one as the Moon’s path in the sky is subject to so many varying
forces. Using epicycle and deferent, Ptolemy was able to account fairly accurately for its

path, a legitimate mathematical loophole, which he was unable to improve upon, as hard
as he tried.

are catalogued `a la Hipparchus, but their total is increased from 850 to over a thousand,
showing that Ptolemy was also a very competent practical observer. As far as the planets

are concerned, he used a deferent and epicycle to account for their observed motion, but
in order to deal with the complications of their movements, Ptolemy had not only to oﬀset
the Earth a little from the center of things, as he had been obliged to do for the Moon, but
also to imagine that the epicycles performed small oscillations as they circled on their way.
This highly intricate and complicated theory of the motion of heavenly bodies survived
a millennium of scientiﬁc apathy of the Dark Ages well into the Renaissance, until a Polish
canon introduced a simpler and more elegant theory. How could the complicated geocentric
theory last for so many years? Why did nobody question the theory? What happened to
the Greek-like curiosity? The answer is perhaps in the Roman civilization, the subject of
the next chapter.
1.5
Wonder of Ancient Greece
In concluding this chapter on the kindling of science it is worth paying tribute to the people
who, in the course of about three centuries advanced human knowledge to a peak never
achieved by our race either before or for many generations after. It is remarkable that a
tiny region on the globe centered around Athens and stretching only a few hundred miles
could produce so many great men of science. It is true that the Greeks imported the raw
material of science from Egypt and Babylon, but the reﬁned abstractness with which they
molded that knowledge, and the theoretical exactness to which they excelled it was only a
Grecian trademark.

The love for abstraction and intellectual adventure is best described by Edith Hamilton

than Pericles himself, sent an invitation to his second in command to sup with him on
the ﬂag-ship. So there you may see them sitting on the ship’s high poop, a canopy over
their heads to keep oﬀthe dew. . . . Pericles bethinks [the young boy ﬁlling the cups]
of the poets and quotes a line about the “purple light” upon a fair young cheek. The
younger general is critical: it had never seemed to him that the color-adjective was
well chosen. He preferred another poet’s use of rosy to describe the bloom of youth.
Pericles on his side objects: that very poet had elsewhere used purple in the same way
when speaking of the radiance of young loveliness. So the conversation went on, each
man capping the other’s quotation with one as apt. The entire talk at the supper table
turned on delicate and fanciful points of literary criticism. But, nonetheless, when the
battle began the next morning, the same men, ﬁghting ﬁercely and directing wisely,
carried the attack on the island. [Ham 93, p. 65]
Whether this exchange of discourse between two warriors actually took place is not
known. But the very fact that it has come down to us points to the remarkably advanced
intellectual capacity of the Greek citizenry. No such anecdote exists between Caesar and his
second in command; nor between General Grant and General Sherman. Such a discussion
of color-adjectives between generals could take place only in ancient Greece.
We could only ponder as to why and how the process of the intellectualization of the
populace occurred in Greece.
Was it because of the detachment of Greek science from
religion? Was it because of the rise of secular philosophy in Greece? Was it because of
the way the Greeks educated their youth? Each of these factors may have had a hand
in the development of knowledge in Greece, but they only displace our lack of knowledge
about the real cause of this development, because they leave unanswered the question of
the roots of the factors: Why was Greek science detached from religion? Why did secular

philosophy rise in Greece, and nowhere else? (And if it rose in other regions of the globe,
why did abstract science not develop in those regions?) How did Greeks come to educate
their children in such a way as to develop them into abstract thinkers?
We may never know why the Greek civilization turned out the way it did. One thing,
however, is certain: In no other ancient civilization has history encountered such an ad-
vanced achievement in philosophy, astronomy, geometry, and physics. Other civilizations
such as the ones in ancient China or in central America may have had means of predicting
the motion of some celestial bodies, or an eclipse of the Sun or the Moon; nevertheless, their
astronomy was purely observational much like the Egyptian and Babylonian astronomy of
the ﬁrst and second millennia BC. There is no indication that any of these civilizations
discovered trigonometry, or proved any theorem in geometry, or had any theoretical frame-
work for their astronomy. As far as we know, abstract science in antiquity was purely a
Greek phenomenon. And the rebirth of scientiﬁc thought during the Renaissance started
at precisely the point where the ancient Greeks left oﬀ.6
Each great civilization of the past has left a wonder to remind the posterity of the glory
that once was. The Egyptian Pyramids tell of the commanding power of Pharaohs over
thousands of slaves who carried one boulder after another to the top of each pyramid over a
period of many years. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon convey the magniﬁcent achievement
of a nation at the peak of the agricultural revolution. The Colosseum in Rome tells the
story of an engineering marvel built for a nation subsumed in a gladiatorial entertainment
of the most brutal kind. The wonder of Greece, however, is not found in the temple of

Answers to “What do you know?”
1.1. You would go to the temples. That’s where the priests were and that’s where higher
knowledge was learned and taught.
1.2. Calendar!
1.3. No, he could not have. If he had known about it, he would have had to incorporate
it into his theory. But his theory assigned a single sphere to each planet, and the sphere
was in uniform motion.
1.4. The left picture represents the smallest Earth; the middle, the largest.
1.5. The closer the quarter moons are to the top and bottom of the Moon orbit, the farther
the Sun is. Therefore, the middle picture represents the farthest Sun; the left picture, the
nearest. The Sun is on the right, because the right half of Moon is illuminated.
1.6. Figure 1.3 shows that as you get closer to the north pole in the northern hemisphere,
the larger the angle the vertical makes with the Sun rays. So, the location of the picture
on the right is farther north than the picture on the left. It is also clear from Figure 1.3
that as you get closer to the south pole in the southern hemisphere, the larger the angle
the vertical makes with the Sun rays. So, the location of the picture on the left is farther
north than the picture on the right.
1.7.
Omaha and Houston are both in the northern hemisphere, and Omaha is north of
Houston. Therefore, the shadow angle there is larger. The ratio of the distance between
Omaha and Houston to Earth circumference must equal the ratio of the angle diﬀerence to
360 degrees. So, if θ denotes the angle diﬀerence, we have 1600/25000 = θ/360 or θ = 23
degrees.
1.8.
The planet moves a third of its epicycle from one snapshot to another. So as the
center of the epicycle moves from 11 to 10 o’clock, the planet moves from 2 to 10 o’clock of
its epicycle (see Figure 1.4). So, for half way between 10 and 11 of the deferent, the planet
reaches half way between 2 and 10, i.e., 12 o’clock. Similarly, as the center of the epicycle
moves from 3 to 2 o’clock, the planet moves from 6 to 2 o’clock of its epicycle. So, for half
way between 2 and 3 of the deferent, the planet reaches half way between 6 and 2, i.e., 4
o’clock.

A Dark Interlude
2.1
Roman Civilization: ca 250 BC–ca 400 AD
Ptolemy was the last of only a handful of scientists who ﬂourished in the three centuries
following Archimedes’s murder. The Greek science was fatally wounded when in 212 BC,
the sword of a Roman soldier ran through the delicate body of Archimedes, the prince of
all Hellenic geniuses. After centuries of diligent observation, monumental discoveries, and
ingenuous theoretical ﬁndings, the Greek political and economic system could no longer
support science. However, unlike the earlier period, when the setting of the scientiﬁc Sun in
the river civilizations of Egypt and Babylon heralded its rise in Hellas, Greek science could
not ﬁnd a rising horizon. The torch that Pythagoras and his forbears brought from Egypt
and Babylon and passed on to such champions as Aristarchus, Euclid, and Archimedes,
remained smoldering in the hands of Ptolemy until it burned itself out.
The center of political and economic power was clearly shifting from Athens to Rome,
but, alas, science did not survive this shift. Romans were a pragmatic conquering people
with very strong military and political establishments, but lacking in culture. And when
they came in contact with the advanced Hellenistic civilization to their east, which had
reached to their footsteps in Sicily and Syracuse, they absorbed its culture like a sponge,
albeit selectively. Aside from the artistic treasures that decorated the mansions of the rising
aristocracy in Rome, much of the “culture” that Romans took from the Hellenistic milieu
was only of practical utility.
The pragmatic Roman citizenry showed little interest in the abstract and theoretical
achievements of the Hellenistic civilization. From among such magniﬁcent scientiﬁc trea-
sures as Euclidean geometry, Epicurean atomic theory, and the sophisticated astronomy
of giants like Aristarchus and Hipparchus, the Romans selected some unknown practical
manuals on agricultural management; and in the education of Roman children, science and
mathematics had a vanishingly small role.
The rapid economic growth of the Roman Empire led inevitably to the stratiﬁcation of
the population. The aristocracy was reaping the fruits of prosperity and living in luxurious
mansions built on enormous estates.
The artisans in the cities and the farmers in the
countryside were being taxed more and more to meet the expenses of the army and the
bureaucracy. In the absence of a collective societal interest in the rationality of philosophy,
mathematics, and science, the stress of economic and cultural poverty of the general public
found two outlets: entertainment and religion.

Chapter 2
A Dark Interlude
2.2
Entertainment in the Roman Empire
The word “gladiator” is synonymous with the Roman Empire. Gladiators were not simply a
coincidence which could have popped up in any other civilization. They were at the root of
the Roman culture and social structure. The Flavian Amphitheater (Colosseum) at Rome
had a seating capacity of 50,000. Comparable amphitheaters were built in major cities in
Italy, France, Yugoslavia, and North Africa. Smaller amphitheaters holding 20,000–25,000
were numerous. Even small towns in the western provinces had their own amphitheaters,
albeit quite small ones. “They came in all sizes, down to the little arenas hollowed out of
the hillside beside military camps, which served the garrison for weapon drill, as well as for
the occasional gladiatorial show” [Wel 84, p. 272].
The construction of the great amphitheaters required a tremendous amount of labor,
materials, and engineering skill that were not easy to come by. The design of the Colosseum
and similar amphitheaters were very sophisticated in terms of crowd control, ease of access
and evacuation for so many people, and arrangements for the delivery and storage of props
and performers, animal and human. Underneath the spectators was an elaborate labyrinth
of corridors and dens in which the wild beasts were kept in cage and later released into the
arena untouched by human hand.
There is no doubt that gladiatorial shows were the most important events in the Roman
culture.
In most cities and towns, the amphitheater was the biggest building, its only
rival being the circus—another institution of entertainment—if there was one. It is clear
that Romans enjoyed public slaughter of men and beasts to the point that it became a
fundamental institution and a social ritual, which had to be properly accommodated, and
for which the society was willing to set aside a good fraction of its resources.
The justiﬁcation for these brutal shows was that—as Pliny the Younger describes in his
famous Panegyric 33—they “inspired a glory in wounds and a contempt of death, since
the love of praise and desire for victory could be seen, even in the bodies of slaves and
criminals” [Rad 75]. The games had their origins in the Roman belief that human blood
propitiated the souls of the dead. Therefore, people sacriﬁced prisoners of wars and slaves
of “poor quality” bought speciﬁcally for this purpose.
The person in charge of the show boasted of his cruelty. One such “sponsor,” a certain
magistrate, has on the base of his statue, “Over four days he showed eleven pairs [of gladia-
tors]: from these eleven of the best gladiators of Campania were killed, with ten bears killed
cruelly” [Wel 84, p. 275]. Other reports describe equally hideous shows of “the half-eaten
beast-ﬁghters, a mass of wounds, dust and blood, who even so beg to be preserved until the
next day, although they will be ﬂung again to the same teeth and claws” [Cha 61, p. 109].
The amphitheater was the stage on which the terror of pain and death, the fragility of
life, and the arbitrariness of the power of the ruling class unfolded. Those who died in the
arena died for the established social order. The show was a “terrifying demonstration of
what could happen to those who failed to please their masters, who failed to conform to
the established order. . . . A spectator who was witty at Domitian’s expense was dragged
out and thrown to the dogs in the arena. Commodus, a handsome and ruthless emperor of
Rome with enormous athletic ability who had a hostile relation with the senators, walked
towards the senators’ seats holding in one hand the head of an ostrich which he had just
sacriﬁced and in the other the sacriﬁcial knife. The threat was blatant. Dio records how
he himself chewed on a laurel leaf from the wreath on his head to stop himself giggling,
presumably from sheer terror” [Wel 84, p. 275].
2.3
Religion in the Roman Empire
Contrary to the Hellenistic society, where rational philosophers fought superstition and
controlled its unbridled spread, the Romans were thrilled by mysticism and magic.

fact, many of the “philosophers” in the Roman society took the philosophy of Plato, and
introduced so many supernatural and mystical elements into it that it ﬁnally turned into
various forms of religious cults.
Philosophy turns into
various cults in the
hands of Roman
intellect.
2.3.1
Rome, a Thriving Marketplace for the Supernatural
The Roman society, like many other before it, had gods of its own, with Jupiter as the
dominant deity. Other deities such as Mithras of Iran and Isis of Egypt were also worshiped
in Rome, but they were done privately. The need for deity was enhanced by the uncertainty
in the daily life. All the sacriﬁces and prayers of the citizens were their part of an invisible
contract to which the gods were supposedly bound. And if the gods failed to perform their
part of the contract, their alters would be overturned, their images dishonored, and their
temples vandalized.
This mob action could be very dangerous politically.
So the state
imposed severe penalties against those who either enticed or participated in such riots. It
was therefore natural for the populace to gravitate to magic and cults.
While the same tendency may have existed in the earlier Greek civilization, the smaller
size of the city-state and its accompanying sense of community, together with the constant
opposition of anti-superstition philosophers such as Socrates and Plato, retarded the growth
of cultism and mysticism in ancient Greece. In contrast, in the vast reaches of the Roman
Empire, and in the absence of the rational guidance of philosophers, the individual felt
detached from the society and took refuge in the teachings of charismatic “holy men.”
The word “holy man” often refers not only to the familiar religious activists such as
Jesus Christ, but also to such cult leaders as Apollonius of Tyana, who claimed to be
the reincarnation of Proteus, a minor sea god (servant of Poseidon) who could change his
appearance at will; to the puzzling Peregrinus Proteus, who immolated himself after an
Olympic event; or to Simon Magus, reputed to have had a bad fall when he tried to ﬂy
[And 94, p. 4]. The Roman Empire was a huge marketplace for holy men, claiming to be
associated with supernatural powers. Each warned of the coming of a “doomsday,” oﬀered
salvation in a virtuous life, in which all ties to the “evil” material objects were severed, and
this salvation came only if men adhered to his principles.
2.3.2
Emergence of Christianity
The free marketplace of holy ideas lasted for a long time. After the impact of Christianity
and the cruciﬁxion of Christ, and before the consolidation of the authority of the church,
the holy men comprised of converts who oﬀered their own interpretations of Jesus Christ’s
teachings. The focus of these interpretations was the notion of the Messiah—and at ﬁrst,
the only notion—in which the followers of Christ disagreed with their fellow Jews. However,
the cleavage between the new group and their Jewish brethren was to widen to the point
that many Christians were persecuted for blasphemy in the hands of the Jews.
A leading ﬁgure in this period, with a genius for organization, was a Jew named Saul
(later to be known as Paul), who was at ﬁrst a vehement persecutor of the followers of
Christ.
Then, on his way to Damascus, he allegedly had a vision of Christ, and from
that moment on, he devoted his energies to the service of Christianity. After a period of
meditation, Paul engaged in passionate and illuminating missionary activities in Syria and
eastern Asia Minor. For his intense devotion to his mission Paul is considered the second
founder of Christianity. He was instrumental in establishing Christianity as a gentile faith
with its own non-Jewish calendar, for instance. Paul, however, was not the only missionary.
Another noted disciple, who went to Rome before Paul and founded a church there was
Peter.
After Peter and Paul, the churches were still small and suﬀered greatly from the hatred
of pagans and Jews alike. During the next century, many of the qualities that characterized

24
Chapter 2
A Dark Interlude
Christianity during the Roman empire and even later, took form. The church in each city1
was independent, and, much like a synagogue, it had a fairly democratic organization under
a board of elders and deacons. However, as time passed, and the church felt more and more
under attack both from outside (the pagans and the Jews) and inside (the heretics), the
need for the concentration of power appeared inevitable. By the third century, the bishop
of each city, though still elected, was the spokesman for, and director of, his congregation.
The relation between the church and the state was strained, to say the least. No Roman
ruler tolerated any cult which instigated popular discontent. At the time of Nero and the
Flavias, simple membership in a church was suﬃcient reason for execution. However, the
ﬁrm belief in the teachings of Christ and the promise of salvation in the afterlife were strong
incentives for the oppressed public to adhere to the doctrine. So, although the Roman state
took every opportunity to persecute the leaders of Christianity, the news of their martyrdom
and the episodes of their embrace of death to “join their Father in Heaven” traveled very
fast and very eﬀectively to the ears of the masses who were looking for a way to emancipate
themselves from the tyranny of the emperors.
The end of the third century brought about fundamental changes to the political and
Ineﬀective persecution
of Christians by the
Roman Empire.
social structure of the Roman Empire. The consolidation of power in the hands of the em-
peror accompanied more oppression and economic decay, bringing with it an unprecedented
internal dissidence. And, the external threats by Sassanian Persia and the Germans added
to the weakening of the state.
These political changes in the state were followed by equally important reorganization of
the church. In 284, when Emperor Diocletian came to power, the number of Christians had
grown to about 10 percent of the Empire, including members of the imperial government
and the army. Diocletian, although tolerant of political foes, showed no enthusiasm for
intellectual deviations. And on February 23, 303, he focused his intolerance on the Church
and carried out the worst persecution ever on Christianity in which the church at Nicomedia
was invaded and burned, and the Holy Scriptures within it were deliberately given to the
ﬂames. Diocletian’s successor carried out similar persecution until 311, when he ﬁnally
issued a decree of tolerance.
The accession of Constantine brought an incredible change in the relation of the Church
and state. During one of his campaigns in 312, Constantine is said to have had a dream
in which he was allegedly told to mark a Christian emblem on the shields of his soldiers.
His victory in that campaign sealed his belief in the power of the Christian God, and he
never wavered in his support of Christianity. The ﬁrst great Christian basilicas were now
built in Rome; Constantine’s mother Helena built the church of Nativity in Bethlehem; and
the new capital of Constantinople was deliberately designed as a Christian city. The power
of jurisdiction was granted to episcopal courts, conﬁscated properties were returned to the
Church, and the clergy were exempted from pagan public rituals. Constantine himself was
not baptized until he lay on his deathbed, partly to “wipe away as many of the black sins
in his ruthless life as possible, partly because the great majority of his subjects were still
pagan” [Sta 98, p. 680].
Slowly, paganism gave way to Christianity. In 382, the pagan symbol of the Roman
Roman Empire gives in;
Christianity becomes the
state religion.
Senate House, which was previously removed by one emperor and restored by another, was
again taken away.
This action brought protests from some pagan senators, which were
countered by the impassioned arguments of Bishop Ambrose of Milan. In 392, Theodosius
banned all pagan sacriﬁces, and by his death in 395, Christianity was the state religion.
2.3.3
Philosophization of Christianity
Now that the struggle for survival was over, Christianity could concentrate on intellectual
activities and theology. The Christian converts of the earlier period, who had a background

in classics and philosophy, recognized a need for clariﬁcation and extension of Christian
theology. The most inﬂuential theologian after Paul is Augustine (354–430), who, in his
youth at Carthage, was so immersed in the worldly pleasures as to have an illegitimate
son.
But his search for a spiritual base led him through Manicheism, skepticism, and
Neoplatonism, until he came under the inﬂuence of Bishop Ambrose at Milan and was
converted to Christianity—the religion of his mother—in 386.
St. Augustine attacks
rationalism.
In his widely known book, the Confessions, Augustine very eﬀectively and persuasively
tells of his own search for meaning in life and how he found safe mooring in the Church.
He attacks pagan pride in reason and the resulting elevation of man as an end in himself.
He warns that man could not penetrate the unknown beyond a certain limit “lest freedom
of thought beget impiety of opinion.” In his letters, he writes more bluntly, “God and the
soul, that is what I desire to know. Nothing more? Nothing whatever!” [Sta 98, p. 690].
St. Augustine
incorporates Plato’s
philosophy and
astronomy into Christian
doctrine.
Augustine was familiar with some of Plato’s writings and commentaries on them, which
had been written in Roman times and later. From these he concluded that the Platonic
conception of eternal truths was consistent with the Christian theology and formed a foun-
dation on which knowledge of the Universe could be built. In particular, Plato’s cosmology
with the Earth at the center and the Universe ﬁlled with the eternal “soul” blended very
nicely with the biblical story of creation.
As the Roman Empire declined, the central power of the Emperor was divided into the
hands of a few land owners whose villas or country houses became the local center of power.
The rising popularity of the Church and its prestige in the imperial family placed it in a
unique position to share this power during the following Dark Ages. The Church, whose
base started in the cities, now moved to the countryside, where the mode of life was reverting
toward the Neolithic level of simple food-production in a network of stable, independent
cells, which could survive the decline of the imperial machinery and the disappearance of a
money economy.
2.4
Education in the Roman Empire
The unique position held by entertainment, politics, and religion in the Roman society
could be better understood by examining the experience of its youth as the bearer of the
Roman tradition. A signiﬁcant part of this experience is contained in the way the youth
was prepared for its future responsibility. This preparation was the task of the Roman
educational system, which, like other aspects of the Roman culture, was taken from the
Greeks.
How did the Romans adapt the Hellenistic education to their own needs?
To
answer this question, we need to examine the Greek education.

Pythagoras stimulated an unprecedented intellectual activity in ancient Greece. However,
the general impact of such activities was not felt until a century later when democracy
began to take hold of the society, and a greater number of citizens participated in political
life. This in turn created a demand for education, which would train the citizens for eﬀective
and eﬃcient government.
By the time of Plato (around 400 BC), there were several methods of educating the
youth, of which two stood out. The sophists were professional teachers charging fees for
instruction, and therefore, could be aﬀorded only by the wealthy. As the sophist movement

started with the democratic tendencies in Greece, their main concern for education was to
inculcate in students the ability to debate in a group with diﬀering viewpoints. This was
of course necessary for democracy especially for those students who would become leaders
in the emerging government.
Thus the entire eﬀort of the sophist was concentrated on

Chapter 2
A Dark Interlude
rhetoric, although other subjects such as animal husbandry, veterinary science, agriculture,
and household medicine were, to a much lesser degree, discussed.
The ﬁrst and most respected sophist, Protagoras, emphasized the teaching of poetry,
music, and gymnastics in his elementary education.
Mathematics and astronomy were
taught in so far as they had practical use in the aﬀairs of the state. For his more advanced
instructions, Protagoras did not believe in a “more intensive study of the content of the
elementary curriculum, for he speciﬁcally rejects ‘calculation, astronomy, geometry, and
music’. But for the study of poetry at the higher level he expresses great regard” [Bec 64,
p. 170]. He had a special interest in logic and dialectic, but this interest was a basis for the
teaching of rhetoric.
The Platonic education was in complete contrast to the sophists’. In his Republic, Plato
describes an ideal society as one that is governed by an elite, philosophical, governing class,
and his educational theory is based on the fulﬁllment of this ideal. The curricular content

of Plato’s elementary education consists of literature, art and music, gymnastics and sports,
practical mathematics, and mathematics as a discipline. It is this emphasis on mathematics
that sets Platonic education apart from the sophists’. This emphasis helped plant the seed
of rational, logical, and mathematical thinking in the minds of so many bright scientists,
and nourished such great politicians as Ptolemy I who built the Alexandrian Museum, in
which such great scientists as Euclid, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes, and many others were
trained.
In the Republic, Plato assumes some teaching of elementary mathematics, not only as a
basis for the higher studies to be undertaken later, but also for its practical use in making
citizens and soldiers more eﬃcient, as well as for its general educational merit. He “refers to
arithmetical knowledge as ‘universally useful in all crafts and in every form of knowledge and
intellectual operation—the ﬁrst thing everyone has to learn . . . . Arithmetic, then geometry
and all branches of the preliminary education which is to pave the way for Dialectic should
be introduced in childhood’ ” [Bec 64, p. 209].
Plato does not conﬁne the mathematics of elementary educational curriculum solely to
practical matters.
Plato’s belief in
mathematics as a test of
intelligence.
[Mathematics] plays its part in character development in providing a stimulus to eﬀort.
It forces the mind to reason and stirs the dull youth to become quick, retentive, and
shrewd ‘beyond his natural powers’.
It awakens the power of thought, disciplines
and trains the mind, preparing for any kind of further study. In fact, the power of
calculation is identiﬁed with the operation of the rational element in the soul.
Not only does mathematics train the mind towards the natural limits of its capacity,
but it also serves to determine the relative capacities of diﬀerent minds. . . . That is,
mathematics provides a means of selecting those intellects which will beneﬁt from
advanced study. It acts as a sort of intelligence test. [Bec 64, p. 210]
In fact, Plato suggests building a strong character not only by confronting it with hard-
ship, danger, and temptations of pleasure, but also [Bec 64, p. 210]
Box 2.4.1. by trying it “in many forms of study to see whether it has the courage and
endurance to pursue the highest kind of knowledge [i.e., mathematics], without ﬂinching
as others ﬂinch under physical trials.”
Plato’s secondary education consists entirely of mathematics and science, and serves

to select those who are to be admitted to the higher study of philosophy. Plato includes
all branches of mathematics in his secondary curriculum. These are arithmetic, geometry,
astronomy and harmonics, and even the “new” science of solid geometry.
In the Laws there is a similar emphasis on mathematical studies in the higher education
of the members of the Nocturnal Council. But there Plato believes that insight into

Section 2.4

the principle of unity may be obtained through a study of the orderly movement of the
stars and the planets. Thus astronomy becomes the major study to which the other
branches of mathematics essential for an understanding of the mathematical relations
involved in the movements of the celestial bodies are subservient. Astronomy performs
in the Laws the same function that dialectic performs in the Republic. [Bec 64, p. 214]
Plato’s secondary education, while encompassing the current practice of mathematics,
severely excludes that other study, which was the most important part of inﬂuential sophists
like Isocrates, and which was to dominate much of ancient education for centuries—the study
of rhetoric. His objection to it was simply that
Box 2.4.2. Rhetoric is incapable of unraveling the truth, because the orator must always
seek to please and persuade by conforming to the mood of the public.
Plato compares a sophist to the keeper of a beast whose mood is to be studied, calling
“good” what it enjoys, and “bad” what it dislikes. In another place, Plato compares the
rhetorician to a chef whose job it is to please the palate of his client, as opposed to a
doctor who prescribes what he thinks is good for the patient. Plato naturally condemns the
skill that seeks to distort facts simply to persuade an audience, and he indignantly rejects
rhetoric as an instrument in the search for truth.
Greek cultural thirst for knowledge helped establish places in which the philosophical,
mathematical, and scientiﬁc talent of the Greek youth could blossom. These places were
not just the primary and secondary schools, but also institutions of higher learning such
as Plato’s Academy, Aristotle’s Lyceum, and Epicurus’ Garden, in which philosophers and
scientists could exchange ideas, transfer knowledge, and create new knowledge.
Greek
aristocracy, themselves being a product of these institutions and an intelligent society in
which they were raised, donated generously to the building of these centers.
The Library and Museum built in Alexandria by Ptolemy I, one of Alexander’s succes-
sors, is a testament to the love of the Greek aristocracy for science and mathematics. So
many talented scientists gathered together in these centers, so much genius diﬀused in every
corner of those buildings, and so much knowledge was created there that at no other time in
history did humanity witness such an outpouring of intelligence, except in post-Renaissence
Europe. Alas, when Rome became a superpower and conquered Egypt, the Library and
Museum received several destructive blows from zealots raised in the Roman-Christian cul-
ture. What was left of the Library and Museum received a ﬁnal blow from another zealot,
who thought that either the books in the buildings taught the same lessons as his holy
book, in which case they were redundant, or something opposed to it, in which case they
were heretical; in either case, the books had to be burned.
2.4.2
The Roman Adaptation
The creative genius that embellished the Hellenic society in all forms of human expression—
art, literature, philosophy, mathematics, and science—was transformed into a prosaic prag-
matism in the hands of the Romans. And in their adaptation of the Greek culture, the
Romans took that system of education which suited their style of government: the sophist’s
system. The path that the Hellenistic studies took in Rome was grammatical and philologi-
cal, and in higher schools, it was rhetorical. If there was any interest in philosophical issues,
it was from a practical angle: to equip the orator with eﬀective intellectual ammunition.
In the Roman secondary school, the school of grammaticus, a pupil would learn Greek,
literature, grammar, spelling, writing, music, and geography with varying degrees of em-
phasis. Arithmetic was taught; however, neither in the secondary nor in higher education
was it the theoretical arithmetic of Plato, but mere calculation.

Chapter 2
A Dark Interlude
After the secondary school, the youth’s further education depended on his future occu-
pation. Those intended for a farmer’s life ended up at some farm station; those intended
for the army went into the service; those intended for public life or for jurists, went to the
rhetorical schools. In short
Box 2.4.3. The only institutions of higher education in the Roman Empire were the
rhetorical schools.
The following passage nicely sums up the Roman higher education [Lau 70, p. 341]:
Geometry, astronomy,
and mathematics were
only lightly touched in
Roman higher
education.
In the rhetorical schools the young men studied rhetoric and all the arts which could
make an eﬀective orator. Cicero tells us that in the last century of the Republic “no
studies were ever pursued with more earnestness than those tending to the acquisition
of eloquence.” . . . In the schools the youths wrote declamations on prescribed themes
. . . and delivered them with proper accent and articulation. . . . The analysis of language
with a view to mastering all its forms was studied. Mathematics, philosophy . . . and
law, as well as literature, entered more or less into this higher curriculum; but the
three former seem to have been studied under specialist teachers, and did not form an
essential part of the higher instruction with the majority of students [our emphasis].
. . . In short, we may say that in the higher education of youths who aimed at some
form of public life—as all the ambitious among the well-to-do did—the two words
“law” and “oratory” practically summed up their studies. Philosophy and geometry,
which, along with astronomy, included in those days the whole of physical science,
were merely touched . . . .
A cursory comparison of the Roman with the Platonic education reveals the antipodal

relation between the two. As much as Plato insists on mathematics, astronomy, and ge-
ometry, the Romans stay away from them. The Roman youths inherited a state for which
they were equipped only militarily and “oratorily.” Instead of doctors for social diseases,
the Roman educational system produced chefs that, with their oratory delicacies, pleased
the palates of society.
2.4.3
The Vanished Library
The only sign of scientiﬁc activity and the haven for the very few rational thinkers who were
pursuing mathematics and astronomy was in the great library of Alexandria. Here, built
by Greeks, ﬁlled with Greek books, and administered for a long time by the descendants of
the Hellenistic glory, the dying heart of reason and science was feebly pulsating.
Of this library not a stone now remains. The beautiful but ruthless Syrian queen Zenobia
gave the library its ﬁrst destructive blow in AD 270. In the next century the library was

deserted by many of its remaining scholars who could no longer endure the theological
wrangling which by then had begun to split the city. The library continued to function,
until Cyril was elected patriarch of Alexandria in 411.
Cyril was typical of one faction of the Christian Church at that time, which thought
its duty was literally to ﬁght and to destroy all that was in disagreement with it, and
believed that knowledge for its own sake had little to oﬀer Christianity. As soon as he
was appointed to his see, Cyril began to attack anything which he considered unorthodox
or irregular; he evicted one Christian sect from their homes and deprived its bishop of
his personal belongings, drove the Jews from their synagogue and allowed his followers to
plunder them, and eventually turned his attention to the library. In the belief that it was the
repository of heathen teaching and pagan ideals, Cyril incited mob violence to such a degree
that the place was set on ﬁre and the director Hypatia, a scholarly woman mathematician,
was murdered with unnecessary brutality in 415.

Section 2.5
The Aftermath
29
Some two hundred odd years later, a diﬀerent zealot, arriving from far away was standing
at the doorsteps of the library. This new visitor was Amrou Ibn el-Ass, caliph Omar’s
military commander who had just captured Alexandria. He had written to Omar about the
thousands of volumes of books that the library was holding, and was awaiting the caliph’s
order as to the fate of the books and the library. When Amrou Ibn el-Ass opened Omar’s
message, he read thusly in it [Can 90, p. 98]:
. . . As for the books you mention, here is my reply. If their content is in accordance
with the book of Allah, we may do without them for in that case the book of Allah
more than suﬃces. If, on the other hand, they contain matter not in accordance with
the book of Allah, there can be no need to preserve them. Proceed, then, and destroy
them.
These words of Omar, echoing those of Augustine uttered some three hundred years earlier:
“God and the soul, that is what I desire to know. Nothing more? Nothing whatever!”,
destroyed the last stronghold of the once glorious age of reason and science.
2.5
The Aftermath
Archimedes’ murder by the sword of a Roman soldier symbolizes the end of the Greek ide-
ology and the beginning of the long period in which the Roman ideology ran supreme. The
global inﬂuence of Rome and its doctrine of law, politics, rhetorics, and oratory ushered
the human race into a long era of mental void. The decay of the cities led to the concen-
tration of local political power in the countryside, where the serfs produced huge quantities
of food for their feudal landlords, who had absolutely no interest in philosophy, astronomy,
mathematics, or science. To them the maintenance of their territory, the subordination
of their peasants, the collection of taxes, the abundance of crop yields, the passing of all
the privileges to their children, and, of course, a good relation with the church were the
ultimate goals of existence.
Long were gone the competent generals, who on the eve of a major battle were engaged
in a heated philosophical discussion of a poet’s use of color-adjectives (see Section 1.5).
Eventually no one asked questions; no one was interested in the philosophical investigation
of nature as was so intensely pursued at the time of Plato and the generations after him,
as if the collective mind of the civilized world had gone into a coma. The landlords and the
Church found a symbiotic relation whereby the Church assured the aristocracy of a good
life in heaven, and the aristocracy assured the Church of a good ﬁnancial life on Earth.
The entire intellectual activity fell into the hands of the clergy, who, in the footsteps of St.
Augustine, adopted those fragments of Plato’s and Aristotle’s philosophy, which perfectly
ﬁlled the Christianity’s void of the worldly rationality. And for well over a millennium the
entire intellectual activity of the intelligentsia (the bishops, the monks, and all the clergy)
was to interpret and reinterpret Plato and Aristotle in light of the Bible.
In the meantime life was moving on; the feudal lords had plenty of food, luxurious man-
sions, comfortable households, and other landlords to assist them in ruling the peasantry.
In their magniﬁcent cathedrals, the clergy gained enormous political power and control over
the spiritual life of the masses. The masses were content with the food and shelter provided
them by the landlords. “Who needs mathematics, astronomy, and geometry? How can sci-
ence be relevant to an agricultural society whose only tools are plows and oxen?” Indeed,
there were tremendous advances in the art of plowing since the time of the Romans, and the
cathedrals built during the Dark Ages testify to the creativity of the Christian architects
of the time. They did not use any Platonic science to build those cathedrals! Medieval
society, like any other stable society at any other period of human history, was the most
advanced society of the day, and the general public was content with what it had. Only in
retrospect, and with over a millennium of hindsight, are we aﬃxing the adjective “Dark”

to this period. To the typical ordinary man of the time, his days were as “bright” as they
could ever be.
And so the landlords came and went; the kings and queens came and went; the bishops,
and the popes, and the peasants and the serfs came and went. And they fed themselves, and
housed themselves, and the popes and the bishops blessed the landlords and their household,
and warned the peasants of the ﬁres of hell. And everything seemed very ordinary and as
it should be. And no question was asked; and no curious mind-eye looked at the heaven;
and everybody thought that all answers were in the Bible and in the works of Aristotle and
Plato. And this went on for over a thousand years.
A minor exception was the people of what is now called the Middle East. With the
birth and rapid expansion of Islam in the seventh century, the center of research moved
to the East. The voluminous works of Aristotle were translated into Arabic accompanied
by new interpretation and outlook. Even in the East, Aristotle became God’s intellectual
gift to man and the representative of the Divine revelation about the natural Universe.
The Islamic scholars were mostly concerned with the rehashing of the Greek mathematics,
although some very novel ideas—such as the invention of algebra—originated from their
work. And they deﬁnitely had very little interest in observation.
Islamic observations of the heavens were conﬁned primarily to a re-determination of
quantities like the size of the Earth, the precession of the equinox discovered by Hipparchus,
and the position of the Sun’s path among the stars, while the movement of the Moon was
also studied with great care because of the demand for its use in the Islamic lunar calendar.
Ptolemy’s system of epicycles and deferents was used as a basis for preparing tables setting
out the future positions of the planets, the most notable of which were the Toledan tables
which were calculated by Jewish scholars working in the eleventh century under their Arab
masters in Toledo, and in the ﬁrst hay of the ﬁfteenth century a catalogue of stars was
prepared at Samarkand, the ﬁrst to be compiled since Ptolemy’s thirteen hundred years
before.

A Lesson from the Past
After two thousand years, we still wonder what happened to the great Hellenic civiliza-
tion. Why a great culture that produced Pythagoras, Epicurus, Euclid, Aristarchus, and
Archimedes turned intellectually so dry. Why, out of all people, the Romans succeeded in
leading the humanity for almost half a millennium. There is no simple answer to these
questions. However, one thing is clear: rational thinking and reason took a back seat in the
Reason takes a back seat
in the Roman empire.
Roman empire.
The most inﬂuential Roman thinker, Cicero, dismisses the study of nature (science) as
either too hard or irrelevant. As the intellectual voice of the Roman society, which was based
on a pragmatic ideal, he preached the importance of the practicalities of Roman life such
as politics, law, and statesmanship, and the cornerstone of his educational philosophy was
rhetorics and oratory. Cicero’s teachings produced great politicians, lawyers, statesmen,
engineers, and military generals, but no scientists or mathematicians.
Two thousand years later, at the dawn of the twenty-ﬁrst century, Howard Gardner, a
leading American educational psychologist tells the readers of New York Times of March
3, 1998 (our emphasis):
. . . Half a dozen years ago, when our economy was languishing along with our test
scores, it was easy to blame our poor schools and to push for better results from our
students. Now the United States stands at the top of the world economically, but our
students are still scoring at the bottom on international math and science tests. Since
high scores on these tests obviously aren’t crucial to our economic success, we need to
decide what kinds of tests matter in helping form the kind of citizen we want to have.

Section 2.6
A Lesson from the Past
31
. . . But most standardized tests ask fact-based questions that sample a wide range of
topics in a somewhat superﬁcial way. Students who score well on these tests are like
well-trained athletes or musicians: through practice, they have become proﬁcient at
a certain skill—in this case, they have done extensive problem sets in many diﬀerent
“content areas” and can move quickly from one question to another.
These tests are helpful in the real world, especially in high school and college. But
they simply do not show whether a student can think seriously about a scientiﬁc issue.
We could drill our students with problem sets and raise their test scores, but still be
left with a population that remains scientiﬁcally and mathematically challenged.
After all, students should be able to apply scientiﬁc and mathematical concepts to the
world around them. As adults, they need to know how to decide which life insurance to
buy, how pesticides aﬀect their food and how interest rates determine home mortgages.
Citizens also need to be able to decide whether cloning research should be banned,
whether more money should be poured into studying global warming and whether
there should be a national health care plan.
This quote is brimming with pragmatism! As the author of the “theory” of multiple
intelligences, which equates the intelligence of a rap dancer (bodily-kinesthetic intelligence)
with that of a mathematician (logical-mathematical intelligence), Howard Gardner cannot
be expected to diﬀer signiﬁcantly from Cicero when addressing issues of mathematics and
science. Gardner’s satisfaction with the US economy in 1998 even though “our students
are still scoring at the bottom on international math and science tests,” is typical of many
American educators. The very scientiﬁc and mathematical skills that Gardner dismisses
because they make students “like well-trained athletes or musicians,” are driving the US
economy which “stands at the top of the world.” This economy, whose basis is electronic
and information technology, is driven mostly by Indian, Chinese, Korean, and other foreign
engineers, “who score well on these tests,” and were educated in schools which “through
practice . . . [taught them to] become proﬁcient at a certain skill.”
The idea that science should not be taught as a skill, but as a “way of thinking” goes
back to John Dewey, the father of American education. As one of the creators of American
philosophy of pragmatism, Dewey abhors a theory which has no practical application:
John Dewey’s opinion
on theories.
The value of any fact or theory as bearing on human activity is, in the long run, de-
termined by practical application—that is, by using it for accomplishing some deﬁnite
purpose. If it works well—if it removes friction, frees activity, economizes eﬀort, makes
for richer results—it is valuable as contributing to a perfect adjustment of means to
end. If it makes no such contribution, it is practically useless, no matter what claims
may be theoretically urged in its behalf. [Arch 74, p. 195]
Dewey wrote this in 1895, when the precise theory of electromagnetism was 30 years
old, electromagnetic waves had been discovered, industrial electric generators were being
introduced, and the possibility of instantaneous transmission of information across the globe
was looming in the horizon. The cell theory of living things, the germ theory of diseases,
the advance of organic chemistry and the synthesis of the organic substances dealt a death
blow to vitalism, and established science as the only viable vehicle of knowledge and its
utility for the betterment of the human life.
While Cicero could proclaim the science of his time as either too complicated or irrele-
vant and therefore practically excluded it from his curriculum, many educators of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were facing a science that was becoming more and
more “relevant.” Thus, they perceived a need to incorporate it in their curricula. But how
could a pragmatic educator incorporate science in his curriculum? Note how Dewey echoes
Cicero in the following passage written in 1910:
The inﬁnitely extensive character of natural facts and the universal character of the
laws formulated about them is sometimes claimed to give science an advantage over
literature. But . . . this presumed superiority turns out a defect; that is to say, so long

32
Chapter 2
A Dark Interlude
as we conﬁne ourselves to the point of view of subject-matter. Just because the facts
of nature are multitudinous, inexhaustible, they begin nowhere and end nowhere in
particular, and hence are not, just as facts, the best material for the education of those
whose lives are centered in quite local situations and whose careers are irretrievably
partial and speciﬁc. If we turn from multiplicity of detail to general laws, we ﬁnd
indeed that the laws of science are universal, but we also ﬁnd that for educational
purposes their universality means abstractness and remoteness. [Arch 74, p. 184]
Dewey is saying that science has too many facts (Cicero said it is too complicated),
and its universal laws are too abstract and remote (Cicero said they were not relevant).
However, as we mentioned above, he cannot exclude it from education, as Cicero did. So,
he ﬁnds a compromise: he excludes it as a subject-matter, but retains a phantom, a ghost,
a shadow, a haze which he calls “scientiﬁc method” [Arch 74, p. 183]:
. . . science has been taught too much as an accumulation of ready-made material with
which students are to be made familiar, not enough as a method of thinking, an attitude
of mind, after the pattern of which mental habits are to be transformed.
Dewey must have heard of the two pillars of modern physics—relativity and quantum
theory—in 1910, and must have known of the abstractness and the mathematical character
of those theories. And as a staunch pragmatist, who wants to ﬁnd practical and useful
results quickly and with the minimal mental eﬀort, he found no need to initiate learning
the subjects. Instead, he might have asked himself “What are these good for in students’
everyday lives?” And readily found the answer: “For nothing.” Thus, in Dewey’s curricu-
lum, science has no place as a subject-matter; only its “method of thinking, an attitude of
mind” is to be taught.
Dewey’s pragmatic approach to teaching was the basis of what he called the progressive
movement in education. That movement was consistent with democracy, the antithesis of
autocracy, which was associated with the traditional teaching techniques in which teachers
were the authority ﬁgures. Just as in democracy individuals have equal rights and respon-
sibilities, progressive teachers were considered members of the group (the class). But if
teachers are only members of the group, who will be teaching the kids?
If it is asked how the presentation of such bodies of knowledge would diﬀer from
the standardized texts of traditional schools, the answer is easy. In the ﬁrst place,
the material would be associated with and derived from occupational activities or
prolonged courses of action undertaken by the pupils themselves. In the second place,
the material presented would not be something to be literally followed by other teachers
and students, . . . . [Arch 74, p. 179]
This approach is called student-centered teaching today.
The curriculum is revolved
around the activities “undertaken by the pupils themselves,” and not around what they
ought to learn. As a result, there is no set curriculum, and teachers present their material
based on the need of students in their “group.”
Student-centered
teaching is 100 years
old!
If there is no preset curriculum, teachers cannot teach out of textbooks, because, by
deﬁnition, textbooks contain preset material. So, how do pupils acquire knowledge? To
acquire knowledge, students have to think. Thus, to Dewey, the process of thinking becomes
more important than the acquisition of knowledge:
Since the situation in which thinking occurs is a doubtful one, thinking is a process
of inquiry, of looking into things, of investigating. Acquiring is always secondary, and
instrumental to the act of inquiring. It is seeking, a quest, for something that is not
at hand. We sometimes talk as if “original research” were a peculiar prerogative of
scientists or at least of advanced students. But all thinking is research, and all research
is native, original, with him who carries it on, even if everybody else in the world is
sure of what he is still looking for. [Dew 87, p. 148]

This is the inquiry-based method of teaching, and it has become a mania among many
science educators. It is the complement of student-centered teaching: If the curriculum
revolves around the activities undertaken by the pupils themselves, and the knowledge
gained by the previous generations can only be transferred by teachers or textbooks, which
Inquiry-based teaching is

is not allowed in progressive teaching, then the only way pupils can gain knowledge is by
discovering it themselves through inquiry.
How does this work in physics and math? Any new knowledge in these ﬁelds is crucially
dependent on the previous knowledge.
Take one of the most fundamental concepts in
physics, acceleration.
Let the pupil watch a ball fall and note that its speed increases.
Tell the pupil that this change in speed is called acceleration, and ask him to relate speed
with acceleration. He might say that acceleration is how speed changes with distance, and
he would be following the mistaken footsteps of many physicists and mathematicians that
came before Galileo, who discovered the correct deﬁnition of acceleration as the way speed
changes with time, not distance.
Newton said, “If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of
giants.” One of the giants on whose shoulders Newton stood was Galileo. If Newton had
not learned that acceleration was the rate of change of velocity with time, he would not
have discovered the laws of motion, which are the cornerstones of all physics. Inquiry-based
teaching takes away the giants from under the pupil’s feet. She can no longer see further,
and is left alone to discover the knowledge whose discovery required the genius of many
generations of scientists.
I have spent more time than I intended on the contentious topic of the pedagogy of
science, a topic on which hundreds of books have been written and thousands of educators
are in heated discussion. In all likelihood, no consensus will ever come out of all these
discussions. However, history is always a good teacher, and our examination of the education
of the two great civilizations of antiquity can be a good guidance. So, I end this chapter
with a question. In preparing our youth to lead our society, do we want to follow Cicero
who said “The investigation of nature seeks to ﬁnd out either things which nobody can
know or things which nobody needs to know,” and whose teaching produced not a single
Roman scientist or mathematician, or to follow Plato who said

3.1
Renaissance and the Copernican Revolution
The passage of time weakened the social bond that held the feudal landlord, the clergy, and
the serfdom together. The need of the growing society which the peasantry could not meet
by itself any longer, gave rise to a new class of citizenry. The task of manufacturing such
items as clothing, building material, furniture, and certain agricultural products fell into
the hands of artisans, who, because of their dependence on one another, clustered together
in communities which later developed into cities.
The rise of the cities led to new commerce, new social relations, and new ideologies. More
and more peasants migrated to the urban communities, and through contact with their rural
relatives, transferred the new ideologies to the countryside. The old feudal bondage started
to shatter; peasants started to revolt; the foundations of the Church, which acted as an
agent of peace and quietude of the peasantry, started to crack from within. By the middle
of the sixteenth century, monks such as Thomas M¨untzer and Martin Luther of Germany,
and Huldrych Zwingli and John Calvin of Switzerland had stood up against the corrupt
and aristocratic church and demanded a separation of church and state. The Renaissance,
the new intellectual life was born.
Although the Renaissance is said to have started in the fourteenth century Italian lit-
erature, the true Renaissance, the one that lifted the fallen icon of mankind and put it on
the pedestal in the Greek tradition, was in science and mathematics. Awakened by the
sound of history, our race began to ponder, scrutinize, question, and speculate again, not

merely for pragmatic ends (as the Romans did), but for the sake of discovery (as the Greeks
did). Pragmatism leads only to the fulﬁllment of the most rudimentary desires of our race
such as the production of food and shelter, as in the Dark Ages. However, the homosapien
curiosity and inquisitiveness drive the wheels of evolution, as in Babylon and Egypt (with
the invention of hieroglyphics and cuneiforms), in Greece (with the formalization of math-
ematics and astronomy), and in the Islamic world (with the invention of algebra). Now,
Copernicus’s theory is

product of his fertile
mind.
this same homosapien trait was rejuvenated in Western Europe in the form of the revival
of interest in science and mathematics.
Nothing can illustrate the homosapien desire to know better than Copernicus’ attempt
at explaining the motion of planets around the Sun. Unlike the old theories which kept
changing due to the force of observation, his was completely a product of imagination, a
response to the need for simplicity, and a reaction to the growing complexity of an intricate
mammoth-like theory, on which, over the years, observation and accurate measurements had
placed the unbearable weight of dozens of epicycles and numerous planetary oscillations.
Copernicus assumed that the Sun was at the center of the solar system and all planets,

including Earth, revolved around it with diﬀerent speeds on perfect circles.
His theory
is called the heliocentric model (from the Greek word Helios meaning the Sun). The
diﬀerent size of the orbits and diﬀerent speeds of the planets cause them to move away and
towards each other during the course of their orbital motion. In particular, looking at a
planet such as Mars from Earth, Mars possesses an irregular motion, sometimes approaching
Earth and sometimes moving away from it (causing a change in the brightness of Mars);
sometimes moving in one direction, other times in the opposite direction (the retrograde
motion of Mars). Math Note E.3.1 on page 76 of Appendix.pdf explains the details
of how a planet appears to be moving relative to Earth, and how the heliocentric theory
leads to all the observed features of the planetary motion without the complications of the
geocentric model.
BIOGRAPHY
The ﬁrst notable new thinker, who questioned the old wisdom in astronomy was Nicolaus Copernicus
(1473–1543). Nicolaus was brought up by his maternal uncle, who was consecrated Bishop of Ermland,
a post which carried with it a palace, a cathedral at Frauenberg, and the power of civil rule over the
area. At the age of 18 Nicolaus was dispatched to Kracow University to broaden his mind. University
education at Krakow was, Copernicus later wrote, a vital factor in everything that he went on to achieve.
There he studied Latin, mathematics, geography, philosophy, and, of course, astronomy, in which he
developed a keen interest. Around 1514 he distributed a little hand written book to a few of his friends
who knew that he was the author even though no author was named on the title page. This book,
usually called the Little Commentary, set out Copernicus’s theory of a universe with the Sun at its
center. This theory, however, was not published until the last year of his life upon the persistent urging
of one of his protestant friends, when he wrote De Revolutionibus.
What do you know? 3.1. Suppose a hypothetical planet was farther from the Sun
than Earth and made its revolution around the Sun in exactly the same time that Earth
did. How do you describe the motion of this planet relative to Earth? Ignore the daily
spin of Earth and consider Earth and the planet as points.
The Copernican revolution spread very quickly in Europe. Italy, the bedrock of Re-
naissance embraced Copernicanism with exceptional fervor. The heliocentric model did not
simply change the science of the time; it undermined the very foundation of the philosophy
and the intellectual life of the period. Once the Earth was removed from the center of
the universe, endless philosophical conclusions could be drawn from it which clashed with
the view of the Church. And the Church was determined to crush such heretical philoso-
phies. One man paid dearly to this antiheresy hysteria; his name was Giordano Bruno
(1548–1600).
Bruno left his home town of Nola to travel to nearby Naples when he was 14 years old
to study there. He attended lectures on humanities, logic, and dialectics in Naples and it
was at this time that he was inﬂuenced by one of his teachers towards Averroism. This was
Christian philosophy based on an interpretation of Aristotle’s works through the Muslim
philosopher Averroes. Its basic belief was that reason and philosophy are superior to faith
and knowledge founded on faith. This radical view attracted Bruno to Copernican heliocen-
tric theory and, after reading Lucretius’ poem On the Nature of Things, to the materialistic
philosophy of the Italian Renaissance. His fertile mind was his laboratory in which the
Epicurean notion of an inﬁnite universe, combined with the Copernican heliocentrism, led
him to believe in the existence of inﬁnitely many solar systems, each having its own Earth,
its own Garden of Eden, its own Adam and Eve, and its own fall from grace.

What do you know? 3.2. Why is a heliocentric model of the solar system conducive
to the belief that there are more systems like it in the inﬁnite universe while a geocentric
model is not?
A passionate debater who spoke his mind with the honesty and purity of a child, he
refused to recant his views even after serving a prison term from 1593 to 1600. Instead,
during his Inquisition trial, he gave his ﬁnal and most impassioned speech, in which he
harangued his judges before hearing his death sentence: “Perhaps you tremble more in
pronouncing the sentence than I do in hearing it.” He was burned at the stake on February
17, 1600. His statue has now been erected at the exact spot where he was burned.
3.2
New Observations: 15 Centuries after Ptolemy
Copernicus drew the attention of humanity to the simplicity and elegance of his theoretical
model of the solar system. But simplicity and elegance, as essential as they seem to be, are
only of aesthetic quality. The real test of a theory is observation, an activity forgotten for
nearly 1500 years. It was a Dane by the name of Tycho Brahe, who revived this activity,
and put the Copernican theory to the harshest test.
In the process of observing the nova of November 11, 1572, Tycho introduced error
analysis—a method in use even today—based on the assumption that any act of observation
or measurement introduces an error irrespective of the capability and the precision of the
instrument. He therefore set about determining the errors inherent in his equipment before
he used it. In this way he was able to attain a degree of accuracy never before reached

and, although he still had no telescope to help him, his measurements were ﬁve times more
accurate than those of Hipparchus, the greatest observer of antiquity.
BIOGRAPHY
Tycho Brahe (1546–1601) was born three and a half years after the death of Copernicus and the
publication of his De Revolutionibus. His uncle (and his guardian) wanted him to be a statesman,
and decided that he should gain experience abroad. In February 1562 Tycho set oﬀwith a traveling
companion to go to the University of Leipzig. Astronomy was not oﬃcially part of his studies, which
included classical languages and culture. However, he had brought with him the astronomy books that
he had purchased earlier. While still at the University of Leipzig, Brahe began making observations
and keeping a record of them. The second observation he recorded was a conjunction of Jupiter and
Saturn which proved signiﬁcant for Tycho’s subsequent career. Neither tables based on Copernicus
nor on Ptolemy gave the correct date for the conjunction, Ptolemy’s being out by nearly a month
and Copernicus’ by days. Tycho, with the conﬁdence of someone not yet seventeen, thought he could
do better, and he later proved himself to be right! He designed and built a large number of precision
astronomical instruments that helped him measure the location of planets with unprecedented accuracy.
Tycho showed that comets are celestial objects whose appearance must follow the “shattering” of the
heavenly crystalline spheres.
And since no such shattering was observed upon the appearance of a
comet, crystalline spheres must not exist.
Tycho spent a long time considering the nature of the planetary system since he was not
satisﬁed by the proposals of Copernicus for two reasons. In the ﬁrst place he could ﬁnd no
observational evidence of the Earth’s motion, and as he was an extremely careful observer
he felt sure in his own mind that the lack of any evidence for the shift of nearer stars against

the background of more distant stars (much like the movement of the trees on the side of
a road—on which a car moves—relative to more distant objects in the background) was
a strong argument against a Sun-centered universe. Secondly, he was a Protestant and to
him the Bible was divinely inspired in every word and phrase and he well knew that the
Old Testament was very deﬁnite in its description of the Earth as ﬁxed in space.

40
Chapter 3
Science Rekindles
Without any doubt Tycho’s greatest achievement is his observation of the Moon and
planets. In addition to observing with amazing precision, Tycho instituted the procedure
of observing these bodies wherever they might be in the sky. Hitherto the positions of
the planets and even of the Moon, had only been determined at astrologically important
moments. Tycho, believer in astrology though he was, cast his observational net as wide
as possible and noted positions as often as weather and visibility permitted. The results of
this new approach were soon to be felt and the procedure has been followed ever since.
3.3
The Fall of the Spherical Dynasty
Tycho’s accurate observations disagreed with both Copernican and Ptolemaic models. Two
theories, one extremely complicated and awkward, one simple and elegant, confronted the
harsh reality of observation, and they both failed.
This failure prompted the downfall
of a 2000-year-old cherished idea introduced by none other than the giant intellectual of
antiquity, Pythagoras.
The collapse of the spherical dynasty came very slowly and very reluctantly. It was one
of those moments in the history of science, when the harsh reality of observation pushed
aside the long-held prejudices stored in the mind of humanity. Unlike the dogmatic belief
in the words of an “authority,” a practice common to creationists, intelligent designers,
psychoanalysts, chiropractors, and other alternative medical doctors, Johannes Kepler, the
German physicist, astronomer, and mathematician, put observational evidence ahead of
any prejudices, and cast aside—albeit hesitantly—the notion that celestial bodies move on
spheres.
Kepler’s basic interest lay in uncovering the mysteries of the planetary system. After
Tycho’s death, a collection of observations of unparalleled accuracy came into Kepler’s pos-
session and he set himself two tasks. On the one hand, to complete a volume of calculations
begun by Tycho showing the future positions of the planets and, on the other, to examine
Tycho’s very complete observations of the planet Mars with a view to determining exactly
how it moved.
BIOGRAPHY
Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) was a premature baby and a very delicate child who was brought up
by his grandparents. After elementary and secondary schooling, Kepler entered T¨ubingen University
to become a Protestant minister. At T¨ubingen, Kepler was taught astronomy by one of the leading
astronomers of the day, Michael Maestlin (1550–1631). The astronomy of the curriculum was, of course,
geocentric astronomy. At the end of his ﬁrst year Kepler got “A”s for everything except mathematics.
Probably Maestlin was trying to tell him he could do better, because Kepler was in fact one of the
select pupils to whom he chose to teach more advanced astronomy by introducing them to the new,
heliocentric cosmological system of Copernicus.
It was from Maestlin that Kepler learned that the
preface to Copernicus’s book, explaining that this was “only mathematics,” was not by Copernicus.
Kepler seems to have accepted almost instantly that the Copernican system was physically true, and
from then on, astronomy and mathematics became his passion. Kepler also worked and wrote a book
in optics, in which he used the idea of a “ray of light” for the ﬁrst time.
Kepler chose the observations of Mars because, of all the planets, it seemed the most
diﬃcult to ﬁt in with the theoretical motions accepted at that time, and he hoped that
Tycho’s masterly observations would help him solve the problem.
By the end of 1604
he was partly successful for he had come ﬁrmly—but reluctantly—to the conclusion that
the movement of Mars could not properly be accounted for by assuming the principle of
uniform circular motion, either about the Sun or the Earth. He had, in fact, arrived at

the monumental discovery that the planet moved round the Sun in an oval orbit. This was
a complete break with authority, an utter repudiation of a tradition which had been held
without question since the days of Pythagoras more than two thousand years before.

What do you know?
3.3. Some philosophers (even some physicists) believe that
the human mind can create knowledge by examining the existing knowledge. How does
Kepler’s work ﬁt in this belief system?
Kepler’s discovery was not published until 1609, when it appeared under the title of The
New Astronomy. Important though the new discovery was, Kepler was unable in 1609 to

prove that it applied to all the planets, and he was also trying to ﬁnd an explanation of
why an oval orbit was the kind of path which Mars described. He believed that some force
from the Sun was the cause, and he even went so far as to suggest that the Sun emitted
rays which moved round as it rotated and so drove the planets along in their orbits.
Kepler extended and developed his ideas of oval orbits, applied them to the newly
discovered moons of Jupiter and, between the years 1618 and 1621, published his Epitome
of Copernican Astronomy as well as what he himself considered to be his greatest work, The
Harmony of the Universe. Throughout his researches he had been seeking a harmony in the

Universe; his discovery of oval orbits had forced him to reject the Greek theory of uniform
circular movements and he continually sought for some uniformity of motion in an oval path
in the ﬁrm belief that God must have created a Universe with the beauty of regular motion
at some point within its structure. He partly reached his goal when he discovered that a
degree of mathematical regularity could be discerned in a planet’s motion within its orbit,
however oval it might be. The fulﬁllment of this goal came in the Harmony, in which he
gave a precise relationship between the size of the orbit of a planet and the time it took to
complete its circuit.
What do you know? 3.4. How crucial was the role of new observation in the theo-
retical model proposed by Copernicus? How crucial was it in Kepler’s theory?
Kepler’s discovery of the nature of the planetary motion was a cornerstone of the sev-
enteenth century in more ways than one. Not only did it break with the 2000-year-old
tradition of Pythagorean obsession with sphericity, but it also laid the foundation of the
universal law of gravitation to be discovered by Newton.
He summarized his ﬁndings in three laws. The ﬁrst two laws are statements about the
shape of the orbit of a planet and its speed. However, the pride of Kepler’s life and work
was his third law in which he claimed to have found a harmony of the universe. Here are
Kepler’s three laws:
Box 3.3.1. (Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion)
First Law: Each planet moves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun located
at one of its foci.
Second Law: The line joining the Sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse
in equal times. Hence, the planet moves faster when it is closer to Sun.
Third Law: The square of the period T of revolution of each planet is proportional to
the cube of its semi-major axis a. In symbols this is written as T 2 = ka3, where k is
the constant of proportionality.
To understand the three laws of planetary motion, we need to know some properties of

an ellipse. Figure 3.1 shows an ellipse with its two foci F1 and F2. The long axis drawn
from A to B is the major axis denoted by 2a, so that the semi-major axis is a. Pick two
arbitrary points P and Q on the ellipse, draw one line segment from each to the foci. The

axis. The sum of the length of the two line segments drawn from P to the foci is the same as those drawn
from Q or any other point.
sum of the length of the line segments in each pair is the same: PF1 + PF2 is the same as
QF1 + QF2.
In fact, this is how you draw ellipses: Tie the two ends of a piece of string to two ﬁxed
points (the foci); place a pencil next to some point of the string and push it so the string is
taut; holding the string taut, move the pencil. The resulting curve is an ellipse. It is clear
that the smaller the distance between the two foci is, the more circular the ellipse will be.
When the two foci coincide, we’ll have a circle, and the major axis becomes the diameter
of the circle. For most planets, the ellipse is very nearly a circle.
A consequence of the second law is that the planet moves faster when it gets close to the
Sun. This is because, as Figure 3.2 shows, to cover equal areas, the planet must traverse a
longer arc of its orbit at P than at Q. Kepler’s third law is demonstrated numerically in
Example D.3.1 on page 13 of Appendix.pdf .

Kepler could not possibly have discovered the elliptical orbits without a detailed
analysis of the observational data. In fact, the circular path was so ingrained in the mind
of astronomers (Kepler included), that any departure from it was inconceivable.
Only
observation could force the ellipticity of the orbits into the psyche of the seventeenth century
astronomers.
3.4. Copernicus was not responding to any new observation when he proposed the helio-
centric model. In fact, there were no new observations at his time. On the other hand,
Kepler studied Tycho Brahe’s new improved observations with utmost care, and was prac-
tically forced by Tycho’s data on Mars to abandon the idea of a circular orbit and replace
it with an elliptical one.

Heliocentric Model A model of the solar system in which the Sun is assumed at the center
while the planets, including Earth, revolve around it on circular (later modiﬁed to
elliptical) orbits. Although Copernicus is associated with heliocentrism, Aristarchus,
a third century BC mathematician was the ﬁrst to propose the model based on his
measurement of the sizes and distances of Moon and Sun.

Chapter4
From Heaven to Earth
Today astronomy and astrophysics are subbranches of physics. But earlier in our history,
they were completely separate. In fact, when astronomy was well on its way to becoming an
exact science in antiquity, physics was nothing but a (false) description of the most obvious
phenomena. The reason was twofold: the primacy of the mind and the loftiness of heaven.
Plato’s inﬂuence on the intellect of Hellenistic scholars and his canonization of the mind
disparaged any attempt at studying objects by experimentation. To him and his followers
human mind—and only human mind—was capable of understanding the universe. Plato
showed a great deal of contempt to those who tried to understand geometry by drawing
ﬁgures on sand. Geometry and mathematics were reserved for the pleasure of the mind and
for the study of heaven, where, according to Plato, the Soul (Idea, Form) resided.
4.1
The Ancient Physics
Astronomy was no doubt the heart of the Greek science. In fact, for over three centuries,
it was the only science studied by Greek scholars.
After all, the Greeks received their
knowledge from Babylon and Egypt, and in both civilizations astronomy was the only
scientiﬁc enterprise for its relation to gods and climate change. This connection between
astronomy and gods held a sacred position for that science among human knowledge even
for the secular Greeks.
Physics was not worthy of attention because it was inherently experimental, and as such,
required the “dirtying of one’s hand.” In the dominant Platonic school of thought, noth-
ing was more intellectually demeaning than to lower oneself to the point of experimenting
with worldly objects with the purpose of gaining knowledge. That is why Archimedes, the
greatest mathematical physicist of antiquity, was hesitant to publish his worldly observa-
tions, and only reported the ﬁnal mathematical products. In contrast, Aristotle, a pupil
of Plato, reduced physics to a few personal experiences and a lot of (wrong) philosophical
speculations.
“Aristotle maintained
that women have fewer
teeth than men;
although he was twice
married, it never
occurred to him to verify
this statement by
examining his wives’
mouths.”

4.1.1
The Aristotelian Dynamics
Aristotle was a philosopher; and whatever he wrote on physics was from a philosopher’s
perspective: a great deal of emphasis on argumentation and logical inference, with insignif-
icant reliance on observation. This made his statements either so general as to render them
useless, or when he was speciﬁc, his statements were usually wrong. Take his dynamics. He
states that vertical motion is a natural motion in which some objects such as smoke and ﬁre
rise, and other objects such as stone and water fall. This is so general a statement that it

48
Chapter 4
From Heaven to Earth
teaches us nothing. It is similar to the statement: “The Earth population consists of males
and females.” While the statement is true, it adds nothing to our knowledge.
As soon as Aristotle tries to be slightly more speciﬁc, he fumbles. Consider his “law
of motion.” Book H of his Physics starts with the statement: “Everything in motion is
necessarily being moved by some thing” [Apo 69, p. 127]. This appears so “evident” that
Aristotle sees no need to explain it any further. After all whatever one sees in motion on the
streets and roads inside and outside Athens, is either being pulled, or pushed, or carried,
or thrown.1
Aristotle then tries to quantify his law, and he comes up with the following statement:
. . . if A is the mover, B the thing in motion, S the length over which motion has
occurred, and T the time taken, (1) in time T a force equal to that of A will cause a
thing which is half of B to move over length 2S, and (2) it will cause it to move over
length S in half the time of T; for thus there will be a proportion. And (3) if the force
of A causes B to move over the length S in time T, it also causes B to move over half
of S in half the time of T, and (4) a force equal to half of A causes a thing equal to
half of B to move over a length S in time T. [Apo 69, p. 146]
The entire quotation above can be summarized in the concise mathematical statement
A/B = k(S/T) where k is a constant of proportionality. When we recognize that S/T is
simply the speed v of the object in motion, we may rewrite the mathematical statement as
A = kBv. In particular, if A = 0, i.e., if there is no force acting on the object in motion,
then v = 0, i.e., there will be no motion!
This Aristotelian law of motion hits a brick wall when it is applied to the motion of
an arrow. As long as the arrow is in the hand of the thrower, the motion appears to obey
the law, with the thrower providing the necessary push. However, as soon as it leaves his
hand, the law breaks down, because now there is no provider of any push or pull. Aristotle
himself argued that the air must provide this missing force. That this is completely wrong
could have been “discovered” by Aristotle if he had consulted a horseback rider, who could
have told Aristotle about the enormous retarding drag he felt every time he set his horse
galloping.
That A = kBv is completely wrong can be gleaned from the observation that some
Aristotle “reinterprets”
his law in light of
observation.
(very heavy) objects will not move even if they experience a substantial amount of force.
Aristotle was, of course, aware of this situation, and remedied his law by arbitrarily adding
the proviso that the proportionality holds in the increasing direction: If the law holds
already, then doubling A doubles the speed v for a given B. However, halving A may not
result in halving v, because one half of A may not be enough to move B in the ﬁrst place.
This constant change in the interpretation of the formula is one of the main tenets of the
pseudoscientiﬁc methodology: If observation disagrees with your theory, do not change the
theory; reinterpret it!
The problem with Aristotelian dynamics is that it is based entirely on argumentation,
and no reference is made at all to observation.
Had Aristotle performed some simple
experiments with motion, he would have discovered the fallacy of his law. But in his time,
pure thought and the force of logic ruled the world of philosophy, and any knowledge that
used “manual” activity was considered base and unworthy of academic pursuit.

The Archimedean Physics
In the golden age of Hellenistic rationalism, and before the political and military prag-
matism of Rome bulldozed the ancient civilizations into the Dark Ages, in the city of the
Pythagoreans, there lived an intellectual giant, a rare breed of scholars who could blend

theoretical reasoning of a skilled mathematician with the dexterity of an artisan, an intellect
matched in genius only two millennia later in the person of Isaac Newton. This intellectual
giant was Archimedes of Syracuse.
BIOGRAPHY
Archimedes of Syracuse (287–212 BC) spent some time in Egypt early in his career, but he resided
mostly in Syracuse, the principal city-state in Sicily. He is considered one of the greatest mathematical
physicists of all time. He not only excelled in the mathematics of his time, but invented the method of
inﬁnitesimals which was later used by the seventeenth century mathematicians in their development of
calculus. Archimedes was also a great mechanical inventor. He constructed such eﬀective war machines
for the defense of Syracuse against the siege of the Romans in 213 BC that the capture of the city
was delayed for a long time. But Syracuse eventually fell in the autumn of 212 or spring of 211 BC.
Archimedes, absorbed in his intellectual activity, did not notice a Roman soldier entering his house.
Upon the command of the soldier to accompany him, Archimedes asked for some time to ﬁnish his
problem. The enraged soldier drew his sword and ran him through; Roman militarism conquered the
crown of the Greek rationalism.
According to Plutarch, Archimedes had so low an opinion of the kind of practical in-

vention at which he excelled and to which he owed his contemporary fame that he left no
written work on such subjects. While it is true that all of his known works were of a the-
oretical character, his interest in mechanics deeply inﬂuenced his mathematical thinking.
The story that he determined the proportion of gold and silver in a wreath made for King
Hieron by weighing it in water is probably true, but it may not be true that he actually
leaped from the bath in which he supposedly got the idea, and ran naked through the streets
shouting “Heureka!” (“I have found it!”).

antiquity and one of the few from any period that deals with this topic. In it Archimedes
recounts how he used a “mechanical” method to arrive at some of his key discoveries,
including the area of a parabolic segment and the surface area and volume of a sphere.
Archimedes emphasizes that, though useful as a heuristic method, this procedure does
not constitute a rigorous proof.
Nevertheless, it comes as close as one can get to the
modern scientiﬁc process (originated by Galileo) of making theories based on observational
measurements.
What do you know? 4.2. What was right with Archimedean physics?
Archimedes’ mathematical proofs and presentations exhibit great boldness and origi-
nality of thought as well as extreme rigor, meeting the highest standards of contemporary
geometry. While Method shows that he arrived at the formulas for the surface area and
volume of a sphere by “mechanical” reasoning involving inﬁnitesimals, in his actual proofs
of the results in Sphere and Cylinder he uses only the rigorous methods of passage to the
limit that had been invented by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC. These methods, of which
Archimedes was a master, are the standard procedure in all his works on higher geometry
that deal with problems of integration.
The greatest eﬀect of his work on mathematicians and physicists—of post-Renaissance

of Archimedes’ works in 1558 and his complete works in 1615 contributed greatly to the
spread of his ideas, which were reﬂected in the work of the foremost mathematicians and
physicists of the time, including Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Ren´e Descartes, and Pierre de
Fermat.
Without the background of the rediscovered ancient mathematicians, amongst
whom Archimedes was paramount, the development of mathematics in Europe in the cen-
tury between 1550 and 1650 is inconceivable.
4.2
Galileo’s Study of Motion
Copernicus’ heliocentric astronomy was indeed a revolution. It was a locomotive that set
in motion the train of human intellect, having gathered dust and rust for over 1400 years.
The degree of its impact on the mind of mankind can be measured by the number of great
scientiﬁc scholars it produced in the generation immediately after Copernicus: Johannes
Kepler (1571–1630), Ren´e Descartes (1596–1650), Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), and Pierre
de Fermat (1601–1665) just to name a few. These great thinkers, as radical as their points
of view were, were still conﬁned to the study of heaven and the rules of logic, i.e., astronomy
and mathematics. The progress of science required a new way of studying nature, a new
methodology. This came about by studying motion, and it was done by Galileo Galilei.
BIOGRAPHY
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) may have been inﬂuenced by his father’s line of experimentation in music
theory. As a student at the University of Pisa in 1583, he discovered the constancy of the period of
a pendulum while watching the oscillations of a lamp at the cathedral of Pisa. Although he attended
the University of Pisa, Galileo left it after four years without a degree. And to support himself, he gave
private lessons in mathematics. He started to investigate some problems of physics a la Archimedes
rather than Aristotle. Following Archimedes, he introduced experimental procedures in the study of
motion. He is credited, among other things, with the ﬁrst observation of the sky through a telescope,
the invention of the ﬁrst thermometer, and the ﬁrst law of motion. Galileo’s views on Copernican theory
were condemned by the church, which put him under house arrest until his death.
Galileo’s new methodology of the natural philosophy truly revolutionized the discipline,
and transformed it into a science in the modern sense of the word. He brought the study
of motion from the heavens down to Earth, and made it the ﬁrst experimental—as opposed
to merely observational—science. In this respect he was a follower of Archimedes at a time
when, except for a handful of new visionaries, the entire academic community followed Aris-
totle’s philosophy. Archimedes himself did not apply his Method to the study of (earthly)
motion, although he applied it to many other phenomena including hydrostatics. This is
partly because motion was not as common a phenomenon as it was in Galileo’s time that
witnessed global journeys on an almost daily basis.
In his study of motion, Galileo used an inclined plane. Place a block of wood B on a

plank IP laid horizontally on the ﬂoor. When you raise one end of the plank, you create an
inclined plane with an inclination angle denoted by θ (Figure 4.1). Keep raising the end of
the plank until the block starts to move. Call this angle θmin, and note that if you lower
the plank below θmin, the block stops.
Now change the block, or the inclined plane, or both, and try to determine θmin for the
new set-up. You will see that θmin will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent Bs and IPs. In particular,
there are some combination of Bs and IPs for which the angle θmin is smaller than others.
Let’s call these smoother Bs and IPs. Repeat the experiment for diﬀerent levels of smooth-
ness. These experiments will show us that the smoother the surface of contact between the
block and the inclined plane the smaller the angle θmin.
The foregoing statement is very much in tune with our common sense and intuition. And
if we stop here, we will have added very little to our knowledge of motion. However, Galileo

did not stop with this statement. Upon a stroke of genius, he asked a deeper question:
What θmin corresponds to an inﬁnitely smooth surface of contact? Now, the concept of
inﬁnity is purely a mathematical concept, one that, analogous to the mathematical concept
of a point, is not realizable in physical terms. However, just as the concept of a point can
be approximated by actual physical objects,2 so can the concept of an inﬁnitely smooth
surface be approximated by planks that are planed or ﬁled by ﬁner and ﬁner instruments.
What do you know?
4.3. In an inclined-plane experiment, for one surface the
angle at which the block starts to move is 30◦, and for another surface it is 25◦. The
smoothness of a third surface is between the ﬁrst two. What are the upper and the
lower limits of the size of the angle corresponding to this surface?

hands occupy themselves.
While the “hands” are extremely important in showing the
direction in which human mind is to engage itself, it is the (trained) mind that takes us to
the boundaries of knowledge and points us to the direction of nature’s hidden possibilities.
Although inﬁnitely smooth surfaces do not exist in our immediate regions of contact
with nature, their conceptual framework could (and did) lead us to its hidden secrets. So,
what if the surface of contact is inﬁnitely smooth? What kind of θmin would we be getting?
Since the minimum angle decreases with smoothness, we expect an inﬁnitely small angle for
an inﬁnitely smooth surface. But what measure corresponds to an inﬁnitely small angle?
Galileo discovers the
ﬁrst law of motion.
The answer is surprisingly obvious: zero!
So, you need not raise an inﬁnitely smooth
surface to move the inﬁnitely smooth block resting on it!
“You need not raise” is too
strong a statement. A better statement is to say “You need to raise the plank by a nonzero
angle.” This angle could be a billionth of a trillionth of a quadrillionth of ... a degree! A
more meaningful way of stating the conclusion is to say that once in motion on a perfectly
smooth horizontal surface, you cannot stop the block by manipulating the plank, because
you can’t lower the angle below zero! In other words
Box 4.2.1. On an inﬁnitely smooth surface, an inﬁnitely smooth block, once set in
motion, will move on its own without any assistance from outside.
This is a restricted version of the ﬁrst law of motion, or the law of inertia. It is in
complete contrast with the Aristotelian law of motion whereby “any moving object must
have a mover.” It is also in complete contrast with common sense. But what is common

sense but a collection of “prejudices we accumulate by the age of eighteen.”3 And if the
fundamental laws of physics were to have no dissonance with our common sense, they would
be incapable of revealing to us the hidden secrets of the universe, which by their very nature
escape our common senses.
Food for Thought
FFT 4.2.2. There are two ways of looking at Galileo’s statement of the ﬁrst law of motion. One
way is to appreciate it as a product of the human mind and, ideal as it may be, seek instances
of the actual motion that approximate the ideal. This is what I call the Greek way. The other
way is to argue that since there is no inﬁnitely smooth surface, the statement cannot be real, and
therefore has no use. I call this attitude the Roman way.
The Greeks were fond of knowledge for its own sake, and it was not uncommon to see two
generals discussing philosophical issues over a drink on the night before a battle. The Greeks were
not solely after a knowledge that had utility. Their philosophy was anything but pragmatic. Their
Greek and Roman ways

geometry was based on the concept of inﬁnite and zero. In fact, the notion of a point as something
that has inﬁnitely small length, height, and width is very similar to the notion of the inﬁnitely
smooth surfaces in Box 4.2.1. And if the Greeks had abandoned the notion of an ideal point because
it could not be realized in actual situations, they would have had to abandon geometry as a whole,
and we would have been deprived of a priceless treasure.
The Romans were the complete opposite. If a notion had no practical utility, they would not
“waste” their time on it. Since studying science was, in the eyes of the Roman educators, either
hard or useless, the Romans abandoned it altogether.
If a geometric point cannot be actually
realized, so the Romans argued, abandon the point and with it the whole geometry. And they did!
As the primary impetus in the western civilization, the Roman ideology led humanity into almost
two millennia of intellectual darkness.
The lesson to learn is not to look at the ﬁrst law of motion (or any other physical law) as
a statement that can be exactly realized in nature, but as an idealized statement to which any
practical situation is an approximation. Furthermore, under controlled laboratory environments
situations could be created that approximate the ideal better and better. However, this simple and
signiﬁcant lesson is dismissed by some modern philosophers of science just as it was dismissed by
the Romans.
In essence, these philosophers are saying that since the idealized conditions necessary for the
fulﬁllment of the laws of physics are not realized in nature, the laws themselves must be wrong! A
good example, to which we shall return later (see Food for Though 20.2.1), is the rejection of the
law of gravity by some philosophers of science because of its inability to predict the fall of a piece
of paper in air! Now, the mathematical law of gravity applies to two completely isolated objects
which exert only this force on one another: if a piece of paper were only under the inﬂuence of the
gravity of the Earth, the mathematical law would describe its behavior exactly. The presence of the
atmosphere, of course, introduces other forces on the piece of paper, which alter its motion dras-
tically. Yet some philosophers of science argue that, because we cannot get rid of the atmosphere,
the law of gravity must be wrong!
Along the same line, consider the statement: “Grass is green.” This statement assumes that you
look at the grass with your naked eye. Now a gravity-denying philosopher of science comes along
and says that the statement is wrong. Her reason is: “I always wear brown Sun glasses and I don’t
see green; I see almost black; and I can show you many others who wear brown glasses, and they
always tell me that grass is not green when they have their glasses on. Therefore, your statement
is incorrect.” This kind of reasoning may appear bizarre, yet it is identical to the argument against
the mathematical law of gravity.
This kind of thinking is behind the educational philosophy which relies solely on “inquiry-
based” methods, and disposes of any idealization that cannot be achieved by such methods. It is
also behind the pedagogical philosophy that teaches only those parts of mathematics and physics
which answer the question “Is it good for some practical application?” in a resounding aﬃrmative.

4.3
Rectilinear Motion
A general study of motion (that which takes place in space) will be taken up in Chapter 6.
In the present section, we want to study a simpler kind of motion; the one that takes place
on a straight line, the rectilinear motion.
One of the major contributions to the study of motion, by which Galileo clariﬁed some
fundamental concepts—and along the way discovered a major formula in mechanics—is
uniformly accelerated motion (UAM). It is remarkable that his study of this speciﬁc
motion led him to some basic notions of calculus just as Newton’s study of the general
properties of motion led him to some advanced ideas of calculus.
4.3.1
Uniform Rectilinear Motion
To understand the uniformly accelerated motion, we need a little background in the simpler
uniform motion on a straight line. This is a motion in which the speed of the moving object
does not change. Denote the speed by v (which stands for velocity, and to which we shall
return later), distance by x, and time by t, and get v = x/t, or
x(t) = vt,
(4.1)
which is the mathematical expression for the familiar idea that distance equals speed times
travel time. Here—and in what follows—the notation x(t) emphasizes the fact that distance
is a function of time.
For our purposes, it is convenient to draw a graph of speed versus time—as opposed

to the more common graph of distance versus time. For uniform motion, this graph is as
shown in Figure 4.2. Since the value of speed does not change over time, the graph is simply
a horizontal line [Figure 4.2(a)]. Figure 4.2(b) shows the area of a rectangle of length t and
width v. This area is equal to vt, which is the distance traveled! Thus, for uniform motion,
the area under the graph of velocity versus time is the distance traveled.
Some remarks concerning physical quantities and their measurement are in order here.
Whenever we measure a physical quantity, we should end up with two attributes: a number
and a unit. The number by itself has absolutely no meaning. If I say that the distance
between this point and that point is 12, you (should) immediately say 12 what? Is it 12
inches (the two ends of a ruler), 12 meters (the two ends of a lecture hall), 12 miles (the
two gates of a city), or 12 light years (the distance from the Sun to one of the closer stars
to it)?
Role of units in physics.
Therefore, the study of physics should start with a convention regarding units. Most
physical quantities can be expressed in terms of three fundamental units: the unit of length,
the unit of time, and the unit of mass.
Most physicists of the world have agreed to
measure length in meters, abbreviated as m, time in seconds, abbreviated as s, and mass

54
Chapter 4
From Heaven to Earth
in kilogram, abbreviated as kg; and these are the units we shall use in this book. As you
will discover in the sequel, most other physical quantities are measured in units that are
derivable from these fundamental units. For example, velocity or speed, which is distance
divided by time, has the unit or meters per second, abbreviated as m/s. For a full discussion
of units see Appendix A.
Example 4.3.1. As a very simple example of the uniform motion, let’s calculate the conversion
factor for going from miles per hour (mph) to meters per second (m/s). A mile is 1610 meters, and
an hour is 3600 seconds. If an object travels at the rate of one mph, it covers a distance of 1610
meters in 3600 seconds. Therefore, 1 mph = 1610
3600 or 0.4472 m/s.
1 mph is 0.4472 m/s.
Whenever you want to convert a speed measured in mph to m/s, simply multiply the number by
0.4472. For example, the speed limit on highways—which is 65 mph—is 65 × 0.4472 = 29.07 m/s.
Similarly, a speed given in m/s can be converted to mph by dividing the number by 0.4472. For
example, sound travels with a speed of 340 m/s. This speed is 340/0.4472 = 760 mph, which is

also called Mach one.
■
4.3.2
General Rectilinear Motion: Distance
Now suppose that the moving object has a nonuniform speed such as the one depicted in
Figure 4.3(a). How do you ﬁnd the distance traveled by the object? Although the speed
changes considerably during the entire motion, for short enough time intervals, the speed of
the object is approximately constant. For example, as you travel on a straight highway, you
will have to change your speed according to the ﬂow of the traﬃc and possibly the speed
limits of construction areas. For long travel times, you will get a curve similar to the one
in Figure 4.3(a), for which the speed changes dramatically. However, if you concentrate on
short intervals, say ﬁve seconds, your speed will not be changing appreciably. Suppose, for
the sake of calculation, we approximate the speed during those ﬁve seconds to be the speed
at the beginning of the interval. Then, you can say that the distance traveled during those
ﬁve seconds is still the (initial) speed times the travel time. During the second ﬁve-second
interval, your speed, which is equal to the speed at the beginning of the second interval, will
have changed slightly, but the distance during the second interval is still (the new) speed
times the time interval. To ﬁnd the total distance you add all these small distances.
On the graph, this procedure is tantamount to drawing rectangles whose heights are ini-
tial speeds during certain (small) time intervals, and whose widths are those time intervals.
The distances are the areas of these rectangles such as those shown in Figure 4.3(b). Note
that in this ﬁgure, the height of a rectangle is the speed at the beginning of the given time
interval. If the time intervals are not suﬃciently small, you will obtain only a very rough
estimate of the total distance traveled, i.e., the sum of the areas of the rectangles will be
only a rough approximation of the total distance. However, by taking the time intervals
small enough, it is possible to get a more and more accurate measure of the distance [Fig-
ure 4.3(c)]. And the sum of the areas of the rectangles gets closer and closer to the actual
total distance traveled. In the limit of inﬁnitesimally small time intervals, the sum of the
areas of the rectangles will coincide with the area under the velocity curve. This leads to
Box 4.3.2. The area under the speed-versus-time curve, bounded by the vertical v-axis
(corresponding to t = 0) and the vertical line at t, is equal to the total distance traveled
during the time t. More generally, the area bounded by the curve and the vertical lines
t = t1 and t = t2 (with t2 > t1) is equal to the total distance traveled during the time
interval t2 −t1.
Example 4.3.3. Figure 4.4 shows the graph of the speed (measured in m/s) of a bicycle versus
time (measured in seconds).
Some general description of the motion can be deduced from the

plot. Figure 4.4(a) shows, for example, that the bicycle is traveling with a nonzero speed at t = 0.
This does not mean that the bicycle magically acquires a speed in no time!
It means, rather,
that we started to observe the motion of the bicycle while it was moving. The bicycle is slowing
down for a while (for approximately 10 seconds); and then speeds up. About 10 seconds after the
start of observing the motion (between approximately 9 and 11 seconds after timing the motion),
the bicycle is moving almost uniformly (the speed is almost constant). A little later, about 15
seconds after timing the motion, the speed starts to increase sharply for about one second, and
then increases less sharply after that. All these statements can be stated somewhat more precisely
by scrutinizing Figure 4.4(b).
To ﬁnd the distance traveled, refer to Figure 4.4(b). Since v is in m/s and t is in seconds, the area
(product of v and t) will be in meters. Each vertical line represents one second and each horizontal
line represents one m/s. So, the bicycle travels about 7 meters in the ﬁrst second (the area between
the ﬁrst vertical line and the v-axis). In the second second, the bicycle covers a distance of about
6 meters, totaling approximately 13 meters 2 seconds after the start of observation. Three seconds
into the motion, the bicycle has traveled about 18 m, and after 6 seconds the bicycle has covered a
distance of 29.5 m. The reader is urged to make a table, the ﬁrst column being t with entries 0 sec
through 15 sec. The second and third columns are to represent, respectively, speed (in m/s) and
distance traveled (in m). Entries of the second column can be read directly from Figure 4.4(b).
For example, the initial speed (at t = 0) is about 7.5 m/s, while a second later it is a little below
6.5 m/s. The last column is the hardest one, because one has to add up all the squares under the
curve up to the time given in the ﬁrst column.

4.3.3
General Rectilinear Motion: Acceleration
The graph of speed of an object A versus time contains a great deal of information about
the motion of that object. You learned how to calculate the distance A travels in time t by
measuring the area under the v-t curve. Now you will learn how to ﬁnd the acceleration
of A from the same graph.
The acceleration a of A at time t is deﬁned as the change in velocity divided by time,
when the time is very very small. To measure the (instantaneous) acceleration at time
t, ﬁnd the velocity at t (label it v(t)); ﬁnd the velocity a little later at t′ (label it v(t′));
subtract v(t) from v(t′) and divide the diﬀerence by t′ −t; make sure that t′ is as close
to t as possible. The smaller the diﬀerence t′ −t, the more accurate the acceleration. In

asked to ﬁnd the (instantaneous) acceleration at some time, say 12 seconds after the motion
starts. How can you determine acceleration from the v-t graph? Here’s how: Read oﬀthe
speed at t = 12 s (approximately 6 m/s), read oﬀthe speed a little—say 2 seconds—later
at t′ = 14 s (approximately 8.25 m/s), and use the deﬁnition of the acceleration given
above, to ﬁnd aavg =
8.25−6
14−12 = 1.125 m/s2.
The subscript points to the fact that you
have calculated the average acceleration during the 2 seconds of its motion. As a rule, we
designate the acceleration as average when the time interval is large (two seconds is large
for this discussion).4 For future reference, note that this ratio is simply the slope of the line
passing through points P and Q of the curve in Figure 4.5(a).
There are two ways to improve the accuracy of this calculation. First, you can improve
the calculation of the slope of the line through P and Q by reading larger numbers. For
instance, the length of the dashed line segment (vertical increment of 10.5 units) over
the corresponding horizontal line segment (increment of 9.5 units) will give a value of
aavg = 10.5/9.5 = 1.10526 m/s2 for the slope.
This value is more accurate than the
previous one, because we could read the large increments much more clearly and accurately
than small values.
The second improvement is more substantial, because it has to do with the very notion
of “instantaneity.” Recall that in Equation (4.2), t′ is to be as close to t as possible. Points
P and Q are separated by 2 seconds, which we decided was too large. So, draw lines from
P to points closer and closer to it, and number these lines. In Figure 4.5(b), line number 1
is the line passing through P and Q, lines number 2 through 4 pass through P and points
that are closer and closer to P. The last line (number 4) passes through a point so close
4If the diﬀerence between the speeds at the beginning and the end of the time interval is not (very) small
compared to either of the two speeds, then the time interval is large.

is the line whose slope gives the most accurate value for the acceleration. You can verify
from the graph that the slope (average acceleration) of lines 2 is aavg = 11/11.2 = 0.982,
for line 3 is aavg = 11.5/12.75 = 0.902, and for line 4 it is a = 9.5/13.5 = 0.704. The last
acceleration has no subscript because it is the slope of the tangent line at P. We therefore
conclude that the (instantaneous) acceleration of A, 12 seconds after the start of motion, is
about 0.7 m/s2.
In general,

responding to that time. Align a straight-edge so that it passes through P and another
point that is as close to P as you can make it. Now draw the line. Tangent lines making
an acute angle with the horizontal axis have positive slopes (positive accelerations); those
with obtuse angles have negative slopes (negative accelerations).
4.3.4
Uniformly Accelerated Motion (UAM)
The case in which the v-t curve is a straight line is of considerable importance. As you
know, the slope of a straight line is the same for all points of the line. What this means is
that for such a v-t curve, the acceleration does not change during the motion of the object.
Such a motion is called a uniformly accelerated motion.
What do you know? 4.5. Figure 4.5 shows the velocity of a car as a function of
time. What is the acceleration of the car (a) 7 seconds after the start of motion? (b)
9.5 seconds after the start of motion?

58
Chapter 4
From Heaven to Earth
Galileo was the ﬁrst person to clarify the concept of acceleration and to discover the
mathematical formula for the UAM. You can easily ﬁnd the velocity as a function of time if
you remember how to write the equation of a straight line. For an xy-plot, it is y = mx+b,
where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. For a vt-plot, the slope is the acceleration a,
and the v-intercept is the initial velocity, which we denote by v0. Therefore, the equation
of velocity as a function of time becomes v = at + v0, which we rewrite as
v(t) = v0 + at
(4.3)
The graph of the speed versus time for a uniformly accelerated motion is shown in Fig-
ure E.4(a) of Math Note E.4.1 on page 78 of Appendix.pdf . The distance turns out to
be

as shown in that Math Note.
The acceleration in either (4.3) or (4.4) could be positive or negative. To determine
whether a quantity is positive or negative, you have to designate a direction as positive.
Positive and negative
acceleration and their
relation to the direction
of motion.
It is convenient to take the direction of motion to be positive.
So, “acceleration points
oppositely to the direction of motion,” means that acceleration is negative.
Similarly,
positive acceleration means that “acceleration is in the direction of motion.”
Example 4.3.5. A train starts from rest and accelerates uniformly to 80 mph in 2 minutes. We
want to ﬁnd the acceleration, and the distance traveled in those 2 minutes. First convert the (ﬁnal)
speed vf to m/s using the conversion factor found in Example 4.3.1: vf = 80 × 0.4472 = 35.8 m/s.
We also need to convert time to seconds: t = 2 × 60 = 120 s.
For uniform acceleration, the time interval in which the change in velocity is to be calculated
need not be small, because the slope of the v−t plot is constant. Thus, we can take t′ to be the ﬁnal
time and t to be the initial time, which is taken to be zero. The acceleration is now calculated from
its deﬁnition a = (35.8 −0)/120 = 0.298 m/s2. The distance can be easily found from Equation
(4.4) with v0 = 0 (because the train starts from rest), a = 0.298, and t = 120 s:
x = v0t + 1
2at2 = 0 × 120 + 0.149 × (120)2 = 2145.6 m,
which is about 1.33 miles.
■
A naturally occurring UAM is free fall, by which is meant the fall of objects under
the inﬂuence of gravity when the retarding eﬀects of air are neglected.
Under such a
circumstance, all objects fall with identical acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s2. Galileo
Free fall acceleration is
9.8 m/s2.
was the ﬁrst to recognize this, and is said to have performed an experiment in which he
dropped two dissimilar objects from the leaning tower of Pisa and noted that they landed
at the same time. Sometimes this acceleration is denoted by g rather than a to emphasize
that it has a gravitational origin.
Example 4.3.6. As just noted, an object, dropped from a height, accelerates downward with
a uniform acceleration of 9.8 m/s2. Taking down to be the positive direction, you end up with a
positive acceleration. Since in a drop—rather than a downward throw—the initial velocity is zero,
Equation (4.4) becomes x(t) = 1
2(9.8)t2 = 4.9t2. Thus, after 1 second the object falls 4.9 m; after 2
seconds, it falls x(2) = 4.9(22) = 19.6 m; and after 3 seconds it falls x(3) = 4.9(32) = 44.1 m, etc.
You see that in each second, the object covers a larger distance than in the previous second. This
is, of course, because the object gains speed as time passes.
Q: How long would it take the object to fall to the ground from the top of the Sears Tower in
Chicago?
A: The Sears Tower is about 500 m high. So, 500 = 4.9t2, or t =
√
102.04 = 10.1 s. This is an
underestimate, because the air drag—which increases with speed—can have a substantial retarding
eﬀect on the motion of the object, causing it to slow down, and increasing the time of the fall. ■
Example 4.3.7. A ball is thrown vertically up with a speed of 100 mph. The acceleration of
gravity is 9.8 m/s2 downward.

Q: How high does the ball rise?
A: There are only two formulas related to uniformly accelerated motion. These are Equations
(4.3) and (4.4). If you know the time of ﬂight, the second equation can immediately give you the
distance (height) by substitution. But this time of ﬂight can be obtained from the ﬁrst equation,
because, you know (or should know!)
that at the maximum height, the speed will have to be
zero (otherwise, the ball will pass the maximum height!). Since you know v, v0, and a, you can
immediately ﬁnd t.
First, convert the initial speed to m/s.
This gives v0 = 100 × 0.4472 = 44.72 m/s.
Next,
note that since the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion, it carries a negative sign.
Therefore, (4.3) gives 0 = 44.72 −9.8t, or t = 4.56 s. The distance can now be easily calculated
from Equation (4.4) with v0 = 44.72, t = 4.56, and a = −9.8:
x = v0t + 1
2at2 = 44.72 × 4.56 −4.9 × (4.56)2 = 102 m.
This result can be generalized to a formula connecting distance and speed directly, as shown in
Math Note E.4.2 on page 78 of Appendix.pdf .
■
Here is an interesting application of both uniform and uniformly accelerated motions to
a life-and-death situation! You are driving on a quiet street. Suddenly a cat jumps in front
of you several meters away. You “immediately” slam on the brakes. Do you run the cat
over or don’t you?
The word “immediately” is in quotation marks for a reason.
Nothing in nature is
immediate. Every process takes a ﬁnite amount of time. The time may be very small—a
very small fraction of a millionth of a second. But it is never zero. Consider the process of
slamming on the brakes. First you have to spot the cat, i.e., the light from the cat must
reach you eyes. This takes a while . . . a very short while, but nevertheless a while. For
example, if the cat is 300 m away, it takes light a millionth of a second to reach you.5 And
if you are moving with a speed of 20 m/s, the car will move 0.00002 m, or 0.02 mm by the
time the light from the cat reaches your eyes. Since this distance is so very short we can
ignore it.
What we cannot ignore is what happens after you receive the cat’s light signal. Your
eyes communicate the signal reception to your brain (that takes time); your brain analyzes
the situation and decides what to do (hopefully to convey to your leg the instruction of
slamming on the brake pedal), which also takes time; then your leg muscles, which up to
this time have been relaxed, initiate their motion and indeed slam on the brakes, which
also takes time. All this may add up to 0.1 to 0.2 second, in which time the car moves 2 to
4 meters . . . not an insigniﬁcant distance. Example D.4.1 on page 14 of Appendix.pdf
peppers this discussion with some numbers.

Chapter Glossary
Acceleration The change in velocity divided by time. Velocity is speed to which is assigned
a direction. So a change in velocity can be made by changing its magnitude as well
as its direction (see Chapter 6).
Aristotelian Dynamics A set of philosophical statements laid out by Aristotle without
any experimental veriﬁcation of those statements. Do not confuse the word “dynam-
ics” used here with the same word used in today’s physics where observation and
experimentation is crucial.
First Law of Motion One of the three laws of motion, a limited version of which was
discovered by Galileo. He discovered that on an ideal inﬁnitely smooth surface, an
object keeps moving without having to be pushed.
Free Fall Any motion that is caused by gravity and gravity alone. A projectile or an object
dropped from a height is a good approximation to free fall. The reason that it is not
exactly a free fall is the presence of atmosphere which aﬀects the motion of most (but
not all) objects only slightly. A small stone dropped from a height is almost in free
fall, but a parachute is not.
Uniform Motion A motion in which velocity of the moving object does not change. This
motion necessarily takes place on a straight line.
Uniformly Accelerated Motion A motion in which acceleration of the moving object
does not change.

Lessons from Astronomy
From the early days of its inception in Babylon and Egypt to Kepler’s discovery of the
sophisticated mathematical relations governing the planetary motions, astronomy under-
went a substantial metamorphosis. Let us analyze the causes of this change through an
examination of the procedures used by the astronomers who contributed to the ﬁeld.
Looking back at the development of astronomy, we see that observation played a cru-
cial role. This observation was quite diﬀerent from casual “observations” every human being
makes of the sky. The observations of the Egyptian and Babylonian priests were quanti-

tative and recorded. They charted the sky; gave names to certain conspicuous heavenly
bodies; kept accurate tracks of their locations; and recorded their ﬁndings. Somehow, they
knew that unraveling the secrets of the universe was not the task of a single generation;
that the observations of one generation had to be passed down to the next, so they did not
have to start anew.
As the number of quantitative observations grew, and as patterns were discovered in the
motion of heavenly bodies, theories were proposed to summarize these observations and
patterns. At ﬁrst, theories were no more than myths adapted to the cultural settings of the
theory makers: the stories of Ea in Babylon, of Ra in Egypt, and of Zeus in Greece. Later,

myths were replaced by secular stories describing the motion of material objects in the sky.
Pythagorean astronomy was of this form. It was, nevertheless, a story that attempted to
encompass the entire cosmos in one general swoop.
This generality hampered the advancement of knowledge, and after a few generations,
Speciﬁcity is crucial for
the advancement of
science.
astronomers came to the conclusion that it would be best if they concentrated on the
motion of some speciﬁc objects. It soon appeared that a few objects had a pronounced
motion against the background stars; and so the attention was shifted from general cosmos
to the ﬁve planets, the Sun, and the Moon. This reduction in the number of objects had a
profound eﬀect on the development of astronomy. With only a few objects to keep track of,
astronomers were able to chart their location in the sky, watch closely their luminosity, their
color, and any other feature that was easily missed in the necessarily diluted observation of
the entire cosmos.
This reduction, for instance, led to the discovery of the retrograde motion, and generated
some of the most intense mental activities of ancient Greece, activities that eventually
produced Eudoxus’s brilliant homocentric theory. And when astronomers discovered the
small increases in the brightness of a speciﬁc planet such as Mars, the idea of epicycles
came into being.
As the drive for the quantitative measurement of physical properties of celestial ob-

jects intensiﬁed, so did the concentration on very speciﬁc aspects of those properties. In-
stead of holistically lumping the entire cosmos into crystal spheres which moved uniformly
around the Earth, Eratosthenes wanted to know speciﬁcally how big the Earth was, while
Aristarchus was interested in the very “narrow” question of the Earth-Sun and Earth-Moon
distances. No more lofty ideas of the motion of the entire universe for which there was no
measurable answer, but a very speciﬁc question about a very speciﬁc measurement for which
there was a possibility of an answer.
The achievements of these scientists are among the most notable of ancient Greece.
Eratosthenes gave us a sense of the size of our home. While humans were aware of the
enormity of Earth, they had absolutely no idea of how big it was. It could have been ten
times the distance between Athens and Sparta, or a hundred times, or even a thousand
times. With Eratosthenes’ discovery, mankind now had an accurate picture of how big the
Earth was, and how small our entire species appeared next to it.
Aristarchus’s measurement of the Earth-Moon distance dwarfed our entire civilization
to a tiny speck in the cosmos. His next measurement, although very inaccurate, foretold of

an entirely diﬀerent universe. Aristarchus’s speciﬁc measurement of the Earth-Sun distance
showed that the Sun was seven times bigger than the Earth. Although grossly underesti-
mated, the enormity of the Sun prompted Aristarchus to question the prevailing geocentric
model of the universe. How can the Sun, being so much bigger, go around the Earth? It
must be the other way around. And he stumbled on the heliocentric model of the universe.
But if Earth is moving, why can’t we detect its motion against an ocean of ﬁxed stars?
His answer? The stars must be much farther away from us than previously thought! A
remarkable universal statement coming from two very speciﬁc measurements! It took over
seventeen centuries for mankind to grasp the value of Aristarchus’ contribution.
Perhaps the most valuable lesson we learn from this part of the book is the value of
abstract and scientiﬁc thought. Abandoning them plunges the human race into darkness.
The most valuable
lesson of this part.
When the Romans took over the rein of humanity from the Greeks, they substituted prag-
matism for the abstract thought, rhetoric for mathematics, law for science, and politics for
philosophy. The result was a burgeoning of magic, cults, and entertainment, with science
and mathematics fading into the horizon of the Roman empire, being completely lost in the
ensuing Dark Ages.
Some may argue that such a claim is pure speculation; it may well be. But the evidence
of history is overwhelming.
History has not recorded a single Roman scientist, Roman
mathematician, or Roman astronomer;1 at the same time, it is full of Roman warriors,
Roman engineers, Roman politicians, Roman orators, and Roman gladiators. The battle
of Plato against rhetoric and his emphasis on mathematics (see Section 2.4.1) may not be
the only cause of the scientiﬁc achievements in Greece, but nobody can deny the great
inﬂuence of Platonic thought on the development of the Golden Age. Compare Plato’s
remarks on mathematics and science with his Roman counterpart, Cicero, who thought
Cicero’s evaluation of
science.
that the investigation of the universe seeks either what nobody can know or nobody needs
to know. If Cicero, the great Roman intellectual, degrades pure thought to such a level,
is it surprising that the seed of science and mathematics found no Roman young mind in
which to grow?
During the Middle Ages, when the eclipse of knowledge darkened the scientiﬁc land-
scape of Europe, a few Islamic astronomers, prompted mostly by the need of their religious
festivities—which were based on the motion of the Moon—were polishing the Ptolemy’s
Almagest. Their contribution was mostly theoretical, and although they advanced spherical
geometry and trigonometry—by-products of astronomy—to a considerable extent, they did
not give astronomy the impetus needed to bring it to its new level of development.
Such an impetus required new observation. As long as one relied on the ancient observa-
tions of Hipparchus and Ptolemy, the complicated geocentric model or the newly proposed

tion of the planets and stars to unprecedented accuracy, a new explanation became urgent.
And this explanation was discovered not by a holistic study of the entire cosmos, nor of the
solar system, nor of the entire collection of the planets, but by a very careful analysis of a
speciﬁc planet over a period of eight years.
Kepler was obsessed with the planet Mars, because it deﬁed all explanations, geocentric
and heliocentric. He noted that without Tycho’s measurements, Copernicus’s heliocentric
model with circular orbits for all planets, was capable of explaining the solar system. How-
ever, when planets were placed on their paths as measured by Tycho, discrepancy arose.
Understanding the
motion of a single planet
yields a universal truth!
This discrepancy was particularly conspicuous for Mars. Kepler decided to tackle the Mars
problem, and after eight years of careful geometrical analysis, he concluded that the orbit
of Mars had to be an ellipse with the Sun being at one of its foci. It was now natural to
generalize this speciﬁc ﬁnding to other planets in the form of Kepler’s ﬁrst two planetary
laws.
What we learn from this discussion of astronomy is that
Box 5.1.1. (1) Observation is crucial in the development of astronomy
(2) Only concentration on a speciﬁc question can lead to general universal statements.
This was as true for the astronomy of 300 BC as it was for that of AD 1600. The general
statements such as those made by Pythagoras can never uncover the scientiﬁc truth. But
some very speciﬁc questions such as “How far is the Sun?” or “How far is the Moon?” can
lead to a general (and truer) picture of the cosmos, in which planets are moving around the
Sun, and the stars are much farther from us than previously thought. Similarly, the very
speciﬁc question “What is the shape of the orbit of Mars?” can unravel the mystery of the
entire solar system.
5.2
Birth of Scientiﬁc Methodology
Under the reign of Plato and Aristotle, nothing but pure thought (Idea, Form) was worthy
of philosophical attention. And since physics was part of philosophy, purely speculative
and argumentative methods were the only way of investigating nature. This methodology
was well-suited to the ideology of the Church during the Dark Ages; however, it was so
powerfully ingrained in the psyche of mankind that even some of the free thinkers of scientiﬁc
Renaissance could not abandon it. Take Descartes, for instance. While he believed in the
importance of matter and the fact that the universe was like a machine obeying knowable
rules and laws, he thought that the power of the mind was suﬃcient to unlock all the
mysteries of the universe.
He was a skeptic of the ﬁrst rate, and like Plato, distrusted
the senses. However, while he was aware of the importance of the sense impressions, he
argued that the “truth” lies beyond these impressions, and through the power of the mind
and logical and mathematical analysis, one can obtain the truth. He was contemptuous of
Galileo because of the latter’s interest in the experimental side of science.
5.2.1
Experimentation
Galileo, unlike Descartes, was a follower of Archimedes, who over 18 centuries earlier was
using the experimental methods in hydrostatics to calculate the volumes of solids of diﬀerent
shapes. The great contribution of Galileo was to apply the same method to the study of
motion. In Galileo’s own words [Bro 62, p. 143]:
My purpose is to set forth a very new science dealing with a very ancient subject.
There is, in nature, perhaps nothing older than motion, concerning which the books

experiment some properties of it which are worth knowing and which have not hitherto
been either observed or demonstrated. . . .
It has been observed that missiles and projectiles describe a curved path of some sort;
however, no one has pointed out the fact that this path is a parabola. But this and
other facts, not few in number or less worth knowing, I have succeeded in proving;
and what I consider more important, there have been opened up to this vast and most
excellent science, of which my work is merely the beginning, ways and means by which
other minds more acute than mine will explore its remote corners.
How prophetic was the last sentence! Only 22 years after Galileo’s death, a 22-year-old
student of Cambridge explored and discovered one of the remotest and most hidden corners
of this “vast and most excellent science.”
Prior to Galileo, the scientiﬁc investigation of motion had always been conﬁned to the
objects in heaven. Observation, that crucial ﬁrst step, had always been directed at the
sky. The “physicists” of antiquity—with the exception of Archimedes—considered earthly
objects too menial to be “observed.” It was only after the liberation of the human mind
from the medieval bondage that the study of motion descended from the sky to terrestrial
laboratories. This was done by Galileo, who showed us that the “dirtying of one’s hands”
is not only not menial, but quite necessary if we are to unravel the secrets of the universe.
He introduced a methodology whereby the act of observation became just as integral a part
of terrestrial science as it was of celestial science.
This methodology—the placement of primacy on observation—did not come about eas-
ily. When Roger Bacon (c.1220–1292), the most celebrated European scientist of the Middle
Ages, sought “to work out the natures and properties of things”—which included studying
light and the rainbow and describing a process for making gunpowder—he was accused of
black magic [Boo 83, p. 401]. He failed to persuade Pope Clement IV to admit experimental
sciences to the university curriculum; he had to write his scientiﬁc papers in secrecy, and
was imprisoned for “suspected novelties.”
Galileo was not the only one to depart from the Aristotelian doctrine of the primacy of
mind over experimentation. The wave of renaissance propagated into many areas of human
curiosity, and rekindled an interest that had been suppressed for centuries. It was in this
spirit that, as we saw, Tycho Brahe turned the eye of humanity once again toward heaven.
It was also in this spirit that Gilbert started his crude, but fundamental, experiments
with magnets and electricity. But Galileo’s experiments in mechanics was by far the most
signiﬁcant of all, because it opened not only the path of the most fundamental branch of
physics, but also reopened the road to the science of mathematics, a road that was, for the
most part, closed for over 16 centuries. Galileo’s legacy was to apply the methodology that
was so successful in the advancement of astronomy to the study of motion. What are the
characteristics of this methodology?

rise, Galileo asked the speciﬁc question of how a speciﬁc object, such as a block of wood,
slides on another object, such as an inclined plane, having speciﬁc properties—such as
smoothness. Just as some ancient Greeks achieved immense success by asking the speciﬁc
questions: “How big is Earth?” and “How far is Moon?”, and even discovered a universal
world view—that the Sun must be the center of our cosmic neighborhood—by asking the
speciﬁc question “How far is Sun?”; and just as Kepler unraveled the universal law of the
motion of planets around the Sun by asking the speciﬁc question “What is the precise path
of Mars?”, so did Galileo discover the universal ﬁrst law of motion by concentrating on the
speciﬁc set-up of a block and an inclined plane.

5.2.3
Quantiﬁcation
Measurement is at the heart of any scientiﬁc knowledge.
This could be as simple as
Eratosthenes measuring the angular shadows of buildings in two diﬀerent cities (thus deter-
mining the circumference of the Earth), or Galileo measuring the angle and the smoothness
of an inclined plane (thus arriving at the ﬁrst law of motion). Measurement by itself is not
suﬃcient to make an investigation scientiﬁc. It has to be done in conjunction with an ex-
periment designed to answer a speciﬁc scientiﬁc question. Experimentation was not new
to Galileo; Archimedes was a master at this method of investigation almost two millennia
before Galileo. What Galileo did for the ﬁrst time in history was to apply the method to
the study of motion.
The act of measurement is necessarily accompanied by control. Once you concentrate
on a speciﬁc question and design an experiment to conduct your investigation, you have the
freedom to control various parameters of the experiment, thereby discovering the relation
between those parameters. For example, by controlling the smoothness of the surfaces in
contact and the angle of the inclined plane, Galileo discovered that on smooth surfaces, the
block started to slide down the inclined plane at smaller angles.
5.2.4
Extrapolation and Idealization
The speciﬁcity of the question, the quantiﬁcation of the investigation, and the control of
the parameters are very crucial in gaining scientiﬁc knowledge. By its very nature, any
experiment is limited by the amount of time and eﬀort the experimenter puts in it. For
example, in the inclined plane experiment, one is limited by the number of smooth surfaces
and their corresponding angles.
If one is lucky, one can obtain 10 or 20 surfaces, and
therefore, 10 or 20 angles. To conclude from this the statement “The smoother the surface,
the smaller the angle at which the block starts to slide” requires a leap of faith. But it is a
leap that is essential in the development of science. It says that if the surface S1 requires a
30◦angle for the block to start sliding, and surface S2 requires a 40◦angle, then a surface
whose smoothness is somewhere between S1 and S2, will require an angle between 30◦and
40◦. One need not do the actual experiment to verify this, although one could. This is
How science moves from
the boundaries of
laboratories to the realm
of universal knowledge.
called extrapolation.
What is even more essential is what we may call idealization. This is the extremely
important step that takes the science from the boundaries of the experimental laboratory to
the realm of the universal laws. Although in extrapolation one could in principle verify the
correctness of the conclusion, such a direct veriﬁcation is impossible in idealization. In the
case of the inclined plane, the idealization is the statement “For inﬁnitely smooth surfaces,
the angle at which the block starts to move is zero.” There is no way that we can test this
assertion directly, because no inﬁnitely smooth surfaces exist in nature.2 We shall see that
all future scientiﬁc knowledge is based on this idealization. It is the process that connects
experiments with laws and theories.
5.3
Underdetermination?
Extrapolation and idealization are indispensable for scientiﬁc progress. Any experimenter
deals with only a ﬁnite number of trials, and any scientiﬁc conclusion is necessarily based
on a ﬁnite number of experimental “points.” This is how science has been ever since its
inception in Egypt and Babylon, where the paths of stars and planets were charted from
only a ﬁnite number of sightings. However, philosophers of science argue that because of
the ﬁniteness of the number of experimental trials, no general conclusion ought to be drawn
from those trials. They call this argumentation the underdetermination of theories.
2We can test it indirectly by noting that as we increase the smoothness of the inclined plane and the
block, the angle required to start the slide of the block decreases.

The straight line represents what Galileo (a physicist) would draw as the theoretical statement summarizing
the results of the experiments. The other two curves represent two of an inﬁnite number of curves that
Thomas Kuhn would draw to make his underdetermination argument.
Based on “underdetermination” argument you cannot say “the smoother the surface,
the smaller the angle at which the block starts to slide,” because you have not tested the
statement for every possible angle and smoothness; that even if physicists successfully test
one thousand diﬀerent surfaces with varying degrees of smoothness against the statement,
still they are not allowed to jump to the conclusion that the statement holds for all surfaces.
Underdetermination is the basis of the philosophers’ lack of interest in observation and
experimentation. To them, observations can at best give you a ﬁnite number of examples
of a physical process. It is the theory that claims to be universal, and thus, worthy of
philosophical consideration.
In fact, Thomas Kuhn, the noted American philosopher of
science, points out that given any set of observations, there are inﬁnitely many theories
that can ﬁt those observations; therefore, he goes on to say, theories are chosen not by
experimental conﬁrmation, but by social persuasion! This is akin to the mathematical fact
that given a ﬁnite number of points (representing experimental results), there are inﬁnitely
many curves (each curve representing a theory) that can be constructed to ﬁt those points
(see Figure 5.1); therefore, philosophers of science argue, why even bother to pick one curve
as the curve. This argument ignores the fact that, in physics, future adds many (albeit
a ﬁnite number of) points to the set, and usually it is the unique curve rightly chosen,
on which these points will fall. But underdeterminists are not satisﬁed by these future
predictions, because the predictions conﬁrm the theory only a ﬁnite number of times!
Let us see what sort of a worldview we would have if underdetermination argument
were taken to its extreme logical boundaries. Consider the statement “The Sun rises from
the east.” This is something that everybody accepts and its validity is taken for granted.
Underdetermination and
failure of Sun to rise
from the East!
But underdetermination tells us that since the rising of the Sun from the east has been
tested only a ﬁnite (albeit a very large) number of times, it should not be generalized.
“How can you be sure that the next time the Sun rises it won’t be from the west (or
the north, or the south, or . . . )?” Of course, no philosophers of science would submit to
this underdeterminational argument for the rising of the Sun, although the logic of their
argument applied to scientiﬁc theories is identical to the one applied to the sunrise.
Consider another statement “All human beings will die before their 1000th birthday.”
Again, the underdeterminationists w(sh)ould argue that although the statement may have

been tested on all human beings that ever walked on this planet, you cannot generalize it to
all humans; that some of us now living on Earth may live to be 1000 years old. Imagine how
much harm this kind of argument inﬂicts on rational thinking. “If the educated philosophers
of science tell me to accept underdetermination,” a person on the street may think, “then I

5.4
The Role of Mathematics
When the Hellenistic rationalism gave way to the Roman pragmatism; when the interest of
the intellect shifted from questions about nature and universe to questions about law and
politics; when “What is the diameter of the Earth?” was displaced by “What is the best
way to build a colosseum?”; and when mathematics was conquered by rhetoric, humankind
entered the most barren desert of the landscape of its history.
Upon its second awakening in the sixteenth century, mankind rediscovered the power
of mathematics and rationalism. And this time it was no less authority than nature itself
that sounded the wake-up call. As soon as humankind started to study nature again—
Once again Nature

from mankind.
either experimentally as Galileo did, or observationally as Kepler did, or philosophically as
Descartes did—mathematics was proven to be the only means of communication. Nature
was telling us once more that if we want to understand her, we had better equip ourselves
with this powerful tool of communication as our forefathers did centuries ago in the golden
age of Hellas. It was in this spirit that Galileo in Italy said:
Philosophy is written in that great book which ever lies before our gaze—I mean the
universe—but we cannot understand it if we do not ﬁrst learn the language and grasp
the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in the mathematical language,
and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical ﬁgures, without the help
of which it is impossible to conceive a single word of it, and without which one wonders
in vain through a dark labyrinth.
And Descartes in France echoed back:
If we possessed a thorough knowledge of all the parts of any animal (e.g., man), we
could from that alone, by reasons entirely mathematical and certain, deduce the whole
conformation and ﬁgure of each of its members, and, conversely if we knew several
peculiarities of this conformation, we would from those deduce the nature of its seed.
And Kepler in Germany resounded:
The chief aim of all investigations of the external world should be to discover the
rational order and harmony which has been imposed on it by God and which He
revealed to us in the language of mathematics.
This time around, however, the demand of nature was much more forceful. While at

the time of Greeks, the study of nature was conﬁned to geometry and the static properties
of objects, the task of analyzing motion brought forth the notion of time. And for this,
mankind had to learn (discover) new vocabulary of the language of nature. Thus Galileo
and his students were forced to discover some rudimentary properties of calculus, and by
the time of Newton—who unraveled the complete set of the laws of motion—it developed
into a new branch of mathematics and theoretical physics.

Chapter6
Kinematics: Describing Motion
Chapter 4 taught us some basic knowledge of motion along a straight line. This chapter
generalizes the concept of motion and introduces some fundamental quantities necessary for
its description.
6.1
Position, Displacement, and Distance
What is motion? Vaguely speaking, it is the change in the state of an object. More precisely,
it is the change in the position of an object with time. Still more precisely, we must speak
of the motion of an object relative to an observer, although the “object” could be a person,
and the “observer” a thing.
To analyze the motion, draw an arrow from the “observer” O to the “object” A, and
call the arrow the position vector.1 The very deﬁnition of the position vector assumes
Position vector.
that both O and A are points. The position vector, denoted commonly by r, determines
the instantaneous position of the object A [Figure 6.1(a)] relative to an observer O. The
word “instantaneous” is important because the position of the point object A is, in general,
constantly changing. If we were to take snapshots of A at various times, t1, t2, t3, etc., and
label the corresponding points at which A is located by A1, A2, A3, etc, we would have a
situation depicted in Figure 6.1(b), with position vectors r1, r2, r3, etc. In this ﬁgure, only
three out of an inﬁnitude of possible snapshots are shown. Bear in mind that every directed
line segment from O to a point on the curve in Figure 6.1 is a possible position vector.
What do you know? 6.1. Can you say that the observer—as deﬁned in the descrip-
tion of motion—does not move?
If the point A does not change, i.e., if the position vector r does not vary with time,
we say that the object is stationary relative to O. You have to make a clear distinction
between the distance between O and A, which is the length of r, and the position vector,
which is the directed line segment r. This distinction becomes essential in situations where
the distance does not change while A is clearly not stationary (for instance, when O is at
the center of a circle while A moves on the circle).
All objects/observers that are stationary relative to one another constitute a reference
frame (RF). For example, all students in a lecture hall form a RF, because an arrow drawn

chairs). This RF also includes all the chairs, the desks, the equipments, etc. The lecturer
will be part of this RF only if he/she is not moving in the room. Similarly, all the sitting
passengers as well as all the chairs, tables, equipments, etc. in a moving train form a RF.
This RF does not include objects outside, nor people that are walking in the train.
What do you know?
6.2. One car is following another on a highway. Both are
moving at 65 mph north. Which of the following is true? (a) All passengers of the car
in front are in the same reference frame. (b) All passengers of the car in the back are
in the same reference frame. (c) All passengers of both cars are in the same reference
frame. How does your answer change if the cars move in opposite directions?
Because motion is relative, diﬀerent observers perceive the motion of the same object
diﬀerently. For one observer the motion may be very simple, for another it may seem very
complicated. You have already seen that the motion of planets is very simple—very nearly
circular—as seen from the Sun. However, these same planets appear to have complicated
motions, including retrogression and change in brightness, etc., when viewed from Earth
(see Chapter 3).
What do you know? 6.3. A car is moving on a highway at 60 mph. Can we just say
that the car is moving?
Example 6.1.1. Your teacher paces the lecture hall in front of you. In the back, there is a clock
mounted on the wall. As she talks about the relativity of motion, she decides to designate herself
as the observer and the clock as the object in motion. She starts at one end of the lecture room,
stretches her arm to constantly point to the clock in the back, and tells the class to carefully watch
her arm, which is in the direction of the position vector of the clock, as she walks to the other end
of the room. By the time she reaches the other end, her arm has shifted in direction. The position
vector of the clock (the object) has changed relative to the teacher (the observer). Therefore, the
clock was moving relative to the teacher!
■
As objects move (relative to some observer), they are displaced.
Displacement.
Box 6.1.2. The displacement of A moving relative to O from an initial point A1 to
a ﬁnal point A2 is the directed line segment from A1 to A2.

Section 6.2
Parallax
75
Displacement is denoted by ∆r or r12, or (rarely) d, and is usually measured in meters. In
terms of the position vectors r1 and r2, we have ∆r = r2−r1, and this deﬁnes the diﬀerence
between two position vectors.
What do you know? 6.4. Karl and Emmy don’t move relative to one another. They
look at a car move from an initial point to a ﬁnal point. Does Emmy see the same
initial position vector for the car as Karl? Does she see the same ﬁnal position vector
as him? Does she see the same displacement for the car as him? What if Emmy moves
relative to Karl?
You have to diﬀerentiate between distance and displacement. Distance is the length of
the path that an object takes in going from an initial point to the ﬁnal point. For example,
in Figure 6.1, the displacement between A1 and A3, denoted by r13, is simply the directed
straight line segment from A1 to A3, while the distance is the length of the curved path
joining the two points.
Position is only one of the ingredients of motion. Another ingredient is time. The concept
of time is much harder to explain than position. Even an operational deﬁnition of time is
not straightforward. To deﬁne time operationally, you need to be able to measure time.
What is time?
This involves a measuring device (a clock), just as the measurement of position involves
a pair of measuring devices (a meter stick to measure length and a compass to measure
direction).2
However, although it is conceptually easy to construct a meter stick and a
compass, it is diﬃcult to come up with a good clock. Ironically, it is only after physicists
mastered the concept of motion that they were able to determine what a good clock is. We
shall not dwell on this subject any further and simply assume that there exist good clocks.
(However, you may ﬁnd Food for Thought 18.1.1 relevant to the present discussion.)
Example 6.1.3. Suppose that observer O1 watches a driver move north 50 miles, then east
100 miles and ﬁnally south 50 miles where he stops (see Figure 6.2).
The distance the driver
traveled is simply the length of the path taken, i.e., the sum of three sides of the rectangle:
distance = 50 + 100 + 50 = 200 miles.
What do you know? 6.5. Karl is driving on a highway. He says “The trees are moving.”
(a) He is crazy! (b) He is dead wrong! (c) He is right.
On the other hand, the displacement is simply the (directed) line segment from i to f whose
length is obviously 100 miles and whose direction is eastward. This last speciﬁcation is important,
as displacement always requires a designation of direction. So, we write
displacement = ∆r = 100 miles, eastward
It is clear from the ﬁgure that, although diﬀerent observers such as O1 and O2, who do not
move relative to one another, measure diﬀerent initial and ﬁnal position vectors, the displacement
will be the same for both. That is why, when ﬁnding displacements, you usually do not need to
specify the observer.
■
6.2
Parallax
When an object moves relative to an observer, the position vector of the object at any
particular time makes an angle with the position vector at an earlier time. As the object

moves, the angle changes [see Figure 6.1(b)]. This angle change is called the parallax of

the motion. If the object moves along the line joining it to the observer (line of sight), the
motion will not have a parallax. Thus, parallax is an indication of a motion that has a
perpendicular component to the line of sight. Such a motion is called a transverse motion.
Transverse motion.
If you draw a position vector from yourself to the window of your room as you are sitting
at your desk, and see that that position vector does not change, then the parallax is zero
and clearly the window is not moving relative to you. Therefore, parallax is an indication
of (transverse) motion of an object relative to the observer. A zero parallax indicates no
transverse motion.
What do you know? 6.6. You draw a line from yourself to an object. Then you
start to move perpendicular to that line, and you don’t see a parallax. What can you
conclude?
As you move on a highway, looking at the trees on the side of the road, it is the eﬀect
of parallax that turns your head to keep track of a single tree. Figure 6.3(a) shows a car
moving on a highway looking at a (stationary) tree. To the people in the car, the tree
moves in the opposite direction [Figure 6.3(b)], and describes a parallax. The ﬁgure also
shows that the farther an object is from the car, the smaller the parallax (angle change)
it describes. That is why the foreground objects alongside a highway seem to be moving
faster than the background distant objects.
One of the strong oppositions to the ancient heliocentric model was the lack of any
observable parallax. If the Earth is moving around the Sun, and therefore in the vastness of
the universe, then we should be able to see some parallax for the stars. In fact, the Greeks
thought that the stars were not too much farther from the Earth than the Sun was. So,
if the Earth moved around the Sun, it had to cover such enormous distances as to make
any parallax easily detectable. Failure of such detection was convincing evidence that the
Earth was stationary. Of course, now we know that even the closest star is thousands of
times more distant than the Sun, and its parallax is immeasurably small. Example D.6.1
on page 15 of Appendix.pdf calculates the parallax of Epsilon Eridani, one of the closest
stars to the solar system, and shows that it is a mere 0.000169 degree.
The smallness of parallax explains why the Moon “follows” us as we drive at night. Let’s
go back to Figure 6.3 and replace the tree with the Moon. As the car moves from its initial
position to its ﬁnal position, a very “small” parallax will be formed due to the enormous
distance of the Moon. How small? Suppose we look at the Moon, then drive a mile and
look at it again. What is the angle between the two position vectors? The angle in radian

one mile being 1.61 km, we get 1.61/400,000 or 4 × 10−6 radian, or about 0.0002 degree!
This angle is so small that the two position vectors appear to be parallel (see Figure B.4 of
Appendix B). Figure 6.4(a) shows these two position vectors. The result is that the Moon
appears to be “attached” to the car with a very long rigid and immobile (and invisible) rod,
dragged by the car wherever it goes [Figure 6.4(b)].
6.3
Velocity and Speed
Motion is related to change. The continuous change in the instantaneous position vector is
what we call motion.3 We can represent this change by a directed line segment from the
initial position to the ﬁnal position, i.e., by the displacement. It is clear that objects covering
the same displacements in diﬀerent times describe diﬀerent motions. What distinguishes
these motions is velocity.
Average velocity and
average speed.
Box 6.3.1. The average velocity vavg of a moving object is its displacement divided
by ∆t, the time elapsed: vavg = ∆r
∆t . The average speed vavg of a moving object is
the distance it travels divided by the time elapsed ∆t: vavg = distance/∆t.
Note that although the letter “v” symbolizes both the average velocity and average speed,
the magnitude of these quantities are completely diﬀerent as the following example shows.
Example 6.3.2. Let us return to Example 6.1.3 and assume that the south-north and the north-
south legs of the trip take one hour each, and the west-east leg three hours. Then the elapsed time
is ﬁve hours. The average velocity is
vavg = ∆r
∆t = 100 miles, eastward
5 hours
= 20 mph, eastward,
3The position vector is drawn relative to an observer, of course.
In the following discussion, all the
properties of motion are described relative to an observer, although the observer is not identiﬁed speciﬁcally.

■
Assume that object A moves on a complicated path as shown in Figure 6.5(a), and you
take snapshots of the motion. If the time intervals are too long,4 the object may have gone
through a multitude of intervening points before the second snapshot is taken. Thus, if A1
represents the initial point on the photographic plate, and a long time later the particle is
recorded at A2, the change in the position vector (the displacement) appears to be ∆r. You
have lost a considerable amount of information about the motion of the object by waiting
too long.
To avoid this loss of information, make the time interval between successive observations
smaller and smaller. Then the point A2 will be very close to A1 and the displacement ∆r
becomes arbitrarily short. How are we going to deal with such small directed line segments?
By deﬁning the instantaneous velocity! It is true that ∆r becomes shorter and shorter as
the time interval between t1 and t2 becomes smaller and smaller, but if you divide ∆r by
the small time interval, you will get a sizable number.
Instantaneous velocity

Box 6.3.3. Locate the moving particle at time t and call its position vector r; locate
it at a later time very close to t, say t′ with position vector r′; ﬁnd the displacement
∆r = r′ −r, as shown in Figure 6.5(b); divide this displacement by t′ −t. In the limit
that t′ gets arbitrarily close to t, the ratio is called the instantaneous velocity v at
time t. Thus, vavg becomes v when ∆t is very small.
We measure velocity and speed in units of meter per second abbreviated m/s. However,
mile per hour (mph) is also used sometimes. A few remarks are in order.
• The instantaneous velocity is also a directed line segment, whose length v is called
the instantaneous speed of the object. Instantaneous velocity tells us how fast

the object is moving at time t, and its direction gives the instantaneous direction of
motion of the object at that time.
4The phrase “too long” has diﬀerent meanings for diﬀerent motions. While minutes are fairly large in the
analysis of a racing car’s motion, hours, even days, are small when analyzing the motion of some planets.

over time) can be seen by noting that contrary to the average velocity and average
speed, which involve the unequal displacement and distance, in the present situation,
the two are (almost) equal. This is evident from Figure 6.5(b) where the arc between

of vavg is not equal to

A1 and A2 (the distance) is very nearly equal to the straight line segment (the magni-
tude of the displacement) connecting them. The closer A2 is to A1, the “more equal”
the length of the arc and the length of the straight line, and the closer you get to the
ideal deﬁnition of instantaneous speed and velocity.
• At the (instantaneous) location of the particle, the instantaneous velocity is tangent
to the curve describing the path of the particle.
• In a general motion, the instantaneous velocity continuously changes both in length
and in direction.

Some Common Kinds of Motion
Let us now look at some of the more common motions that exist in nature. The simplest
kind of motion is called uniform motion [Figure 6.6(a)]. In a uniform motion, the object
moves in the same direction on a straight line with constant speed.
Equivalently, in a
uniform motion the velocity is constant.
Uniform motion.
Next in complexity is the rectilinear—straight line—motion of an object thrown straight
up with a velocity v0, or dropped from a height. The length of the velocity vector, i.e., the
instantaneous speed, decreases on the way up, becomes zero at the very top, and increases
on the way down [Figure 6.6(b)].
The third type of motion is that of a projectile in which an object is thrown up at
an angle. This is a generalization of the motion discussed immediately above, but now
the velocity v0 is tilted.
Notice the decrease in speed of the projectile on the way up,

uniform speed on a circle.
Note that although the speed, the length of the velocity, is
constant, the velocity changes continuously [Figure 6.6(d)]. The motion of artiﬁcial satellites
is well approximated by a circular motion. Similarly, the motion of the Moon around the
Earth, and that of the Earth around the Sun, are almost circular.
Finally, a simple harmonic motion is a rectilinear motion, in which the moving object

repeats its movement (also called oscillation). The maximum speed occurs at the midpoint
of the range of oscillation, while at the end points, where the particle comes to a momentary
rest, the speed is zero [Figure 6.6(e)]. A concrete example of simple harmonic motion is
that of a mass attached to one end of a spring whose other end is ﬁxed. When the mass is
displaced slightly, it will undergo a simple harmonic motion.
6.4
Acceleration
The ﬁnal concept to be considered in kinematics is acceleration. The common meaning of
acceleration describes only the increase in the speed of an object. The scientiﬁc deﬁnition
of acceleration is a generalization of the common meaning. It is simply the change in the
velocity of the moving object per unit time interval. To be precise:
Acceleration deﬁned.
Box 6.4.1. Measure the velocity—both speed and direction—of the object at time t and
call it v; a short time later, say at t′, measure the velocity again, and call it v′; subtract
the initial velocity from the ﬁnal velocity; divide the result by t′ −t. In the limit that
t′ −t becomes inﬁnitesimally small, the ratio will be the instantaneous acceleration at
time t. In symbols, a = ∆v/∆t, where ∆v = v′ −v, ∆t = t′ −t, and ∆t is taken to be
very small.
If the acceleration is constant, i.e., if neither its direction nor its magnitude changes, then
the time interval t′ −t need not be small. The unit of acceleration is meter per second per

second, abbreviated m/s2.
What do you know? 6.8. Is it true that acceleration means speeding up?
The following remarks should elucidate the concept of acceleration.
• In the procedure described above, it is necessary to ﬁnd the diﬀerence between the
ﬁnal and the initial velocities as discussed in Appendix C.
• Acceleration, calculated from the change in the velocity vector, is itself a vector quan-
tity. Thus it has a length (the magnitude of acceleration) and a direction.
• A source of common mistake is to confuse acceleration with velocity. Although the
direction of the velocity vector is the same as the direction of the instantaneous motion
of the particle, the direction of the acceleration vector has nothing to do with this
motion. (See the following examples.)
• Any change in velocity represents an acceleration. This change could come from a
change in the speed with no change in the direction, or a change in direction with no
change in speed, or changes in both direction and speed.
• A motion whose acceleration remains unchanged, and whose initial velocity is in
the same direction as the acceleration, is called a uniformly accelerated motion
(UAM). Since acceleration always points in the same direction, all changes in velocity
will take place along the line deﬁned by the initial velocity (or acceleration). So, such
a uniformly accelerated motion is necessarily rectilinear. This is the motion studied by
Galileo, who discovered the mathematical formulas that give the velocity and distance
as a function of time (see Subsection 4.3.4).
• When the direction of the acceleration is opposite to that of the velocity, it is some-
times called deceleration.

What do you know? 6.9. A car is moving north at 65 mph. A little later it moves
at 64 mph. What is the direction of the change in velocity? What is the direction of
the acceleration of the car?
Example 6.4.2. This example will shed some light on the sign convention used for acceleration
in Section 4.3.
Suppose a car, moving exactly east, increases its speed. Then as Figure 6.7(a) shows, the change
∆v in the velocity of the car is also due east. This change is obtained by drawing the initial velocity
vi and the ﬁnal velocity vf from the same point (in the ﬁgure the two vectors have been displaced

so they can be clearly identiﬁed) and connect the tip of vi to the tip of vf. Since acceleration
and ∆v have the same directions and the latter is in the direction of motion, we conclude that
the acceleration has the same direction as motion itself. If we take the direction of motion to be
positive, this acceleration is also positive.
Now suppose that the car decreases its speed (decelerates). Then as Figure 6.7(b) shows, the
change ∆v in the velocity of the car is due west. We conclude that the acceleration is due west, and
therefore opposite to the direction of motion. Since the direction of motion is positive, acceleration
is negative. So deceleration is the same as negative acceleration.
■
What do you know? 6.10. A race car is moving on the straight leg of a race track
at 200 mph. A bicycler is moving at 10 mph as she turns left on a corner. Which has
more acceleration?
Let us qualitatively analyze the acceleration of the kinds of motion discussed so far. Bear
in mind that to ﬁnd the true instantaneous acceleration, one has to compare the velocity
vectors inﬁnitesimally close to one another; however, to make drawings clear, we use the
initial and ﬁnal velocity vectors which are reasonably far apart. In Figure 6.8, we have
shown the accelerations for some of the motions of Figure 6.6. In a uniform motion, the
velocity vector is constant. Hence, the change in velocity is zero, and when you divide this
change by ∆t, you get zero for the acceleration: the acceleration of an object in uniform
motion is zero.
In the motion of an object that is falling or is thrown straight up [Figure 6.8(a)], as well
as in the projectile motion [Figure 6.8(b)], the change in the velocities is always downward.
Hence, the acceleration always points down. Furthermore, a careful analysis of these motions
shows that the magnitude of this acceleration is constant.
This constant value, which
happens to be approximately 9.8 m/s2, is called the gravitational acceleration and is
denoted by g. Close to the surface of the Earth, all objects moving freely, i.e., not inﬂuenced
by non-gravitational forces (such as air drag), have this downward acceleration. Such objects
are all said to be in free fall (see also Section 4.3.4).
Finally, the acceleration of an object in simple harmonic motion is linear (along the line
of motion), but periodically changes direction. Figure 6.8(c) compares two velocity vectors
on each side of the motion (v8 and v9 on the left and v3 and v4 on the right). It is clear
that v9 −v8 points to the right, and v4 −v3 points to the left. Therefore, the acceleration
vectors are as shown in Figure 6.8(c).
Example D.6.3 on page 17 of Appendix.pdf illustrates a numerical calculation of the
acceleration of a car moving with constant speed on a circle. Math Note E.6.1 on page
79 of Appendix.pdf generalizes this and shows that the acceleration for a uniform circular
motion points towards the center of the circle, and its magnitude is given by

where v is the (constant) speed and r is the radius of the circle. Such an acceleration is
called a centripetal acceleration.
What do you know? 6.11. A car is moving north at constant speed on a circle as
shown below. Is it accelerating? If so, what is the direction of its acceleration?
Example 6.4.3. A car is moving on a curved road in the shape of an arc of a circle of radius
100 m. Suppose that the car is moving northward momentarily with a constant speed of 50 mph,
and that the road curves westward.
Q: What is the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration of the car at that moment?
A: Equation (6.1) gives the magnitude of the acceleration. To use that equation, you have
to convert the speed from mph to m/s.
Using the conversion factor 0.4472, you obtain v =
50 × 0.4472 = 22.36 m/s. Thus, a = 22.362/100 = 5 m/s2, using Equation (6.1).
Q: What about the direction of the acceleration?
A: Recall that the centripetal acceleration of an object always points toward the center of the
circle on which the object is moving. In this case, the center happened to be to the left of the car
at the moment that it moves northward. Therefore, the direction of the acceleration would be to
the left of the car, or westward.

Answers to “What do you know?”
6.1.
Strictly speaking, yes! Because motion is determined only relative to an observer,
once the latter is speciﬁed, it (he, she) does not move (relative to itself, himself, herself).
6.2.
When the two cars move in the same direction, all three statements are correct.
The ﬁrst two are obvious. The third becomes transparent after you draw a position vector
from any object in one car to any object in the second car and ask “Is this position vector
changing?” The answer is no, because the distance between the two cars does not change.
If the cars are moving in opposite directions, then (a) and (b) are correct but (c) is not.
6.3. No! Because you have not speciﬁed an observer. If the observer is assumed to be the
ground, then the car is moving relative to the ground. But if the observer is the driver of
the car, then the car is not moving relative to the driver. In fact, the ground is moving
relative to the driver!
6.4. The initial and ﬁnal position vectors are generally diﬀerent for two diﬀerent observers
(unless they are next to each other). However, the displacement is the same for both as
long as they don’t move relative to each other. If Emmy moves relative to Karl, then all
three quantities will be diﬀerent. For example, if Emmy is the driver of the car, then all
three quantities are zero for her!
6.5. None! Motion is relative! So, he should specify relative to whom are the trees moving.
6.6.
Since you are moving perpendicular to the line of sight, your motion is transverse;
and if the object is near, you should see a parallax. The only conclusion, therefore, is that
the object is very far from you.
6.7. (a) Average speed, because distance is larger than displacement. (b) They are equal,
because inﬁnitesimal distance is equal to inﬁnitesimal displacement.
6.8. No. Speeding up is only one form of accelerating. Any change in velocity accompanies
an acceleration.
6.9. Change means ﬁnal quantity minus initial quantity. It is what you add to the initial
to get the ﬁnal. Since in this case ﬁnal is smaller than initial, we need to add a vector
pointing south to the initial velocity to get the ﬁnal velocity. So, the change in velocity
points south. Acceleration, therefore, also points south.

84
Chapter 6
Kinematics: Describing Motion
6.10. The race car has no acceleration because neither its speed nor its direction is chang-
ing. The bicycler has acceleration because she is changing the direction of her velocity. So,
the bicyle has more acceleration.
6.11.
Since the direction of velocity is changing (even though its magnitude is not), the
car is accelerating. In fact, it has a centripetal acceleration, with direction pointing toward
the center of the circle. Therefore, the acceleration must be pointing west.

Dynamics: Cause of Motion
In his study of motion, Galileo clariﬁed many useful kinematical concepts such as velocity
and acceleration. He also discovered (see Box 4.2.1) that, contrary to Aristotle’s theory,
an object moving on an inﬁnitely smooth horizontal surface requires no “movers.” Once in
motion, the object moves forever on the horizontal surface with constant velocity. Galileo,
moreover, emphasized the role of mathematics in studying motion.
The seeds of the scientiﬁc methodology of Galileo and his emphasis on mathematics
found a perfect soil to grow in the person of Isaac Newton. Never before since the time
of Archimedes had there been such a harmonious blend of mathematics and nature as in
the work of Newton. In him converged and climaxed the forceful tide of rational science
that started with Copernicus. New societies of science, for the ﬁrst time, were exposing
observations and presenting theories and discoveries for discussion, criticism, endorsement,
correction, and diﬀusion. For a quarter-century as president of the Royal Society in London,
Newton made it an unprecedented center of publicity and of the power of science.
7.1
The First Law of Motion
A simple form of the ﬁrst law—also known as the law of inertia—was given by Galileo (see
Box 4.2.1). Quite surprisingly, Descartes, contemptuous of experimentation, discovered a
more general version of this law:
First law stated.
Box 7.1.1. An isolated body at rest will remain at rest, and an isolated body in motion
continues its motion with constant velocity along a straight line.
This is in complete contrast to everyday experience. After all, we seldom see an object
in eternal straight-line motion without some agent “driving” it! Without a driving force,
all objects will eventually stop. Box 7.1.1 resolves this apparent paradox by the adjective
“isolated.” Objects of our everyday experience are not isolated, but in contact with another
object. And this contact introduces friction.
Both Newton and Galileo were aware of the existence of friction. They also knew that
reducing the friction brings the motion of the object closer to the ideal straight-line uniform
motion. The ﬁrst law is simply the extrapolation of this experimental fact to an idealized
situation in which friction is completely absent. Such an idealization occurs frequently in
science. In fact, one is safe to say that in general, theories, laws, and principles are almost
impossible to formulate without idealization.

Dynamics: Cause of Motion
BIOGRAPHY
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) had a very rough childhood. His father died before his birth; his mother
remarried and left him with his grandmother on a farm; when his stepfather died, his mother moved
in with three children. Newton attended the Free Grammar School in Grantham, ﬁve miles from his
home.
His school reports described him as “idle” and “inattentive.”
His mother, by now a lady
of reasonable wealth and property, thought that her eldest son was the right person to manage her
aﬀairs and her estate. Newton was taken away from school but soon showed that he had no talent,
or interest, in managing an estate. Newton’s uncle persuaded his mother that Isaac should ﬁnish his
schooling and go to the university. At 19, older than the other undergraduates, Newton entered Trinity
College, Cambridge. Upon his graduation in the summer of 1665, he had to leave Cambridge due to the
widespread plague in the London area to spend the next 18 months in the quiet of his family farm at
Woolsthorpe. These 18 months were the most productive of Newton’s (as well as any other scientist’s)
life. He developed calculus, discovered the laws of motion, and found the mathematical formulation of
the law of gravity.
It is a pleasing irony of scientiﬁc investigation that to comprehend a real, seemingly
inexplicable case, one has to abandon the case by idealizing and simplifying it, unravel the
idealized version, and only then come back and explain the original case. The ﬁrst law
is a simple example. A real motion, with friction, could not produce the ﬁrst law. By
idealization to a frictionless environment, not only do we fathom the concept of motion,
but we obtain a fuller understanding of what it was that made the analysis of the motion
diﬃcult in the ﬁrst place. Friction becomes that external agent which prevents the object
from obeying the (idealized) ﬁrst law of motion.
7.1.1
Momentum
In the study of the “cause” of motion, two important concepts ought to be understood
clearly. These are mass, the quantity of matter, and momentum, the quantity of motion.
To introduce these concepts, start with the ﬁrst law and replace it as follows:
Concept of momentum
introduced.
Box 7.1.2. There is a vector quantity denoted by p associated with the motion of every
physical system called total momentum, and if the system is completely isolated, this
total momentum will not change.
The following remarks should help clarify the concept of momentum:
• An isolated system is one on which no external agent acts.
• A system may consist of more than one part.
• The total momentum of a system is the vector sum (see Appendix C) of the momenta
of its parts.
• The parts may exert inﬂuences on each other. Such inﬂuences will not aﬀect the total
momentum of the system as long as the external inﬂuence is absent.
• The word “system” is completely arbitrary. In principle many separate systems can
be combined to form a new larger system. The choice is dictated by the convenience
achieved in speciﬁc situations.
• The momentum at rest is zero.
• There may be more than one external agent acting on a system. As long as their net
eﬀect is zero, the ﬁrst law holds.

What do you know?
7.1. A system is seen to move on a circle.
Is the system
isolated?
Let us look at some real situations involving systems and their momenta.
Example 7.1.3. Consider two billiard balls, one moving on a straight line towards a second one,
which is at rest. Let us deﬁne our system to be these two balls taken together. Ignoring the small
friction of the table and the smaller air resistance, you can assume that the ball in motion moves on
a straight line with constant velocity. You can, therefore, conclude that there is no external agent
disturbing this ball. The second ball is also undisturbed by any external agent, because it is not
moving. Thus, as a system, there is no external agent acting on the two balls. The ﬁrst law, then,
says that the total momentum of this system will not change. This is obvious as long as the two
balls have not collided [Figure 7.1(a)]. What happens after collision? Clearly the two balls may
wander oﬀin two arbitrary directions [Figure 7.1(b)], but if you add the momenta of the two balls,
so says the ﬁrst law, you will get the same vector as before collision. Note that momentum for each
part is deﬁned so that equality and constancy in the absence of external agents hold. Note also
that each ball will exert an inﬂuence on the other during collision, but this inﬂuence is internal. ■
What do you know? 7.2. Two clay balls approach each other head-on with the same
momentum. What is the total momentum of the system consisting of the two balls?
What happens if they stick to each other after collision?
Example 7.1.4. A block of wood is resting on a smooth frictionless table while a bullet is
approaching it with momentum p [Figure 7.2(a)]. The bullet subsequently collides and penetrates
the block and comes to rest inside it while the system of block and bullet moves [Figure 7.2(b)].
The momentum of the combination will be the same as before collision.
Imagine that you are standing on a boat which is at rest. As you start to move in one direction,
the boat moves in the opposite direction. Initially the total momentum of the system consisting
of you and the boat is zero (neither you nor the boat is moving). After you start to move with a
given momentum, the boat moves with exactly the same momentum in the opposite direction to
render the total momentum the same as before. This happens because there is no external agent.
A more dramatic illustration of this is the motion of a rocket. In this case, the system consists
of the rocket plus its fuel. After ignition, the fuel gushes down while the rocket goes up. Again the
momentum of the rocket exactly balances the (opposite) momentum of the exhaust fuel.

A ﬁrecracker explodes into many fragments, each going in a diﬀerent direction. Since the force
of the explosion is an internal inﬂuence, the total momentum after the explosion—obtained by

The foregoing examples illustrate one of the most important laws of physics, namely the
law of momentum conservation, which is equivalent to the ﬁrst law of motion as stated
earlier. However, it is instructive to rephrase the latter as follows:

7.1.2
Mass
We have talked about momentum, we have given examples of its conservation, but, we have
not as yet deﬁned what momentum is. Surprisingly, there is no deﬁnition of momentum!
We must accept momentum as given (or deﬁned) by the ﬁrst law and, when appropriate,
deﬁne other quantities in terms of momentum (see Food for Thought 7.2.2 for some insight).
One of the most important quantities deﬁned in terms of momentum is mass.1 Consider
two blocks A and B initially at rest on a perfectly smooth surface [Figure 7.3(a)]. Between
A and B there is a small compressed spring, which can be thought of as part of—and
attached to—one of the blocks, say A. The two blocks are held together by a string which
can be very gently severed (for example, very slowly burned) to minimize the eﬀect of
1It is possible to keep mass undeﬁned and deﬁne momentum in terms of it. This, in fact, is done in most
textbooks. We prefer momentum because not only mass but also force can be deﬁned in terms of it, as you
shall see shortly.

external inﬂuences. After the string is severed, the blocks will move in opposite directions
[Figure 7.3(b)]. The system A + B is an isolated system. Although the burning is done by
an external agent, the motion of the system is not aﬀected by such an agent because both
A and B remain motionless during the burning process until the very last ﬁber of the string
is burned. But right after the last ﬁber is burned and before the blocks start to move, the
only inﬂuence acting on the blocks is caused by the compressed spring which is internal
to the system. (One can make the whole process more ideally isolated by replacing the
spring-string combination by a miniature time bomb.)
Assuming an ideal case in which the external inﬂuence can be completely ignored, the
ﬁrst law can be put into action, and the conclusion can be reached that A has as much
momentum (but in opposite direction) as B. It is clear that the velocities will not be the
same. The “heavier” object will move slower than the “lighter” object. We make the vague
notions of “heaviness” and “lightness” more precise by the concept of mass: Physicists
deﬁne the ratio of the mass of A to that of B to be in inverse proportion to their speeds:
Mass and momentum.

. Thus, the product of mass and speed for the two blocks will be the same:
mAvA = mBvB
This procedure deﬁnes only the ratio of masses.
To ﬁnd the mass of an object, we
assign the value of one unit to an arbitrary but standard object and ﬁnd the ratio of any
other mass to this standard mass by the experiment described above. The standard unit of
Unit of mass is kilogram
(kg).
mass that we use is kilogram (kg) which is approximately the mass of one liter of water.
Since 1889, the kilogram is deﬁned to be equal to the mass of the international prototype
of the kilogram, which is made from an alloy of platinum and iridium of 39 mm height
and diameter, and is kept at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International
Bureau of Weights and Measures) in Paris. Oﬃcial copies of the prototype kilogram are
made available as national prototypes, which are compared to the Paris prototype (“Le
Grand Kilo”) roughly every 10 years.
Now that the concept of mass is deﬁned, we can obtain a better insight into the nature
of momentum by working backwards. You saw above that the product of mass and speed is
the same for the two objects A and B. Invoking the ﬁrst law now, we identify the product
mv as the magnitude (or length) of the vector quantity, momentum. Proceed one step
further and write
p = mv.
(7.1)
It is then clear that pA + pB = mAvA + mBvB = 0 because mAvA has exactly the
same length as mBvB, but its direction is opposite, and the sum of any two vectors which

92
Chapter 7
Dynamics: Cause of Motion
have equal length but opposite directions is always zero. Thus, deﬁning p = mv ensures the
conservation of momentum: zero momentum before burning; zero momentum, pA+pB = 0,
after burning.
What do you know? 7.4. In Figure 7.3, A moves twice as fast as B. If A is 10 kg,
what is the mass of B?
It turns out that measuring the mass is much easier; all you need is a scale! In general,
however, the direct measurement of momentum is diﬃcult. Hence, by measuring the mass
and the velocity of an object and using the relation (7.1), you can calculate its momentum.
Example 7.1.6. An astronaut, holding a wrench in his hand, is detached from his spaceship
and moves away from it. The astronaut and the wrench constitute an isolated system having some
momentum which points away from the spaceship. The only way he can get back to the ship is
by using the fact that the momentum of the system does not change. He decides to throw the
wrench as hard as he can.
But which direction does he throw it?
Suppose that he throws it
towards the spaceship. Since the momentum of the system was away from the spaceship initially,
the momentum of the astronaut has to be away from the spaceship with a magnitude equal to the
sum of the initial momentum and the momentum of the wrench. Therefore, he should throw the
wrench away from the spaceship. This, nevertheless, will not guarantee that the astronaut will
acquire a momentum towards the spaceship. Only if the momentum of the wrench is larger than
the initial momentum of the system will the astronaut acquire a momentum towards the spaceship.
Example D.7.1 on page 18 of Appendix.pdf adds a numerical ﬂavor to this situation.

What do you know? 7.5. Why does a gun recoil when ﬁred? Would it recoil more
or less or the same if the bullet were heavier?
Example 7.1.7. In the olden days, before the age of laser and computer technology, in the bal-
listics laboratories, the speed of a bullet was measured using the constancy of the total momentum
of an isolated system. The bullet would be ﬁred into a block of wood resting on a surface. The
(small) velocity of the subsequent motion of the block with the bullet inside would be measured.
Knowing the masses of the block and bullet, one would calculate the momentum of the system.
This momentum is of course the momentum of the initial ﬁred bullet. With the mass of the bullet
at one’s disposal, the initial speed of the bullet could be determined. See Example D.7.2 on page
19 of Appendix.pdf for a quantitative analysis.

7.6. In the motion of a rocket, the amount of fuel that is
ejected per second is the same throughout the initial stage of the motion of the rocket.
The speed of the fuel coming out is also the same. Using these two facts, compare the
momentum of the rocket at the beginning of the initial stage and at the end of the
initial stage. What about its speed? Hint: At the beginning, about 90% of the mass of
a rocket is its fuel.
7.2
The Second Law of Motion
The ﬁrst law applies only to situations in which there are no external agents acting on the
object in motion. What happens if there is an external inﬂuence? The second law answers
this question.
The second law is the key to the secrets of motion. Applied to the motion of any system,
it gives a full description of the future of that system. It includes the ﬁrst law as a special
case, and—as we shall see—explains many phenomena that were unexplained before. The

Section 7.2
The Second Law of Motion
93
second law is so universal that most of the physics and mathematics of eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries were discovered by applying it to diverse physical systems.
We are now ready to state the second law of motion. Again, like all great laws, it
carries a deﬁnition with it. Let us state the law ﬁrst, and then discuss it:
Box 7.2.1. (Second Law of Motion) The net instantaneous force acting on an object
is precisely the instantaneous change of its momentum per unit time. In symbols, the
second law can be written as
Fnet = ∆p
∆t
with ∆t very small.
If the mass of the object remains constant during its motion, then ∆p = m∆v and
Fnet = ∆p/∆t = m(∆v/∆t). Thus, recalling that acceleration is the change in velocity
divided by time, in this special (but very useful) case one writes
Fnet = ma,
(7.2)
which is the version of the second law most often used in introductory discussions of dy-
namics.2 Equation (7.2) implies that force and acceleration point in the same direction.
This relation also suggests the unit of force. It is simply the product of the unit of mass
Unit of force is Newton
(N).
(kg) and the unit of acceleration (m/s2). Thus, the unit of force is kg · m/s2 which is called
Newton and abbreviated as N.
Food for Thought
FFT 7.2.2. Henri Poincar´e, the great French mathematician of the late nineteenth and early
twentieth century has pointed out that every fundamental law of physics has a deﬁnition built into
it. The law and the deﬁnition come together. This seems a bit unconventional (logically), and a
logician would frown on such a procedure: “How can you make a statement about something that
is not known to you?” Nevertheless that is how physics develops ideas and new quantities, and
in many cases physicists cannot assume that the fundamental law should be a statement about
predeﬁned quantities.
The ﬁrst law of motion is a statement about momentum, which is undeﬁned in that statement.
The second law of motion is a statement about force, which is deﬁned in that law as the rate of
change of momentum. You may ask “This procedure of making a statement about concepts that
are deﬁned by that statement makes scientiﬁc statements quite arbitrary. I can write an arbitrary
equation, and deﬁne the quantities involved at my will. Would that make me a great physicist?”
This is a legitimate question that requires clariﬁcation.
The power of physical laws lies in their agreement with observation, and the form which these
laws take is the outcome of many trials and errors sometimes spanned over many generations of
physicists. You may deﬁne “force” as, say, velocity times momentum, or something else, but your
deﬁnition will be useless because, when confronted with observation, it will give the wrong answer.
In fact, this is how some concepts were developed: by trying diﬀerent (wrong) deﬁnitions until the
right deﬁnition was discovered. For example, because most objects either slow down or speed up
as they cover more and more distances, many physicists deﬁned acceleration as the rate of change
of velocity with distance. Galileo was the ﬁrst to come upon the right deﬁnition of acceleration as
the rate of change of velocity with time.
Physics and other sciences are empirical.
Logic and mathematics are not.
That is why in
the latter ﬁelds one has to deﬁne new quantities and concepts in terms of the old; otherwise the
ﬁelds become a collection of random statements. The empirical nature of physics allows statements
involving new and old concepts simultaneously. Through trials and errors and comparison with

the net force that enters the second law (see also the remarks made below).

94
Chapter 7
Dynamics: Cause of Motion
observation, the correct statements will be picked out, and in time become part of the scientiﬁc
vocabulary.
The second law is the most important of the three laws, as the following discussion will
reveal. Hence, a good understanding of its content is essential. The following remarks and
examples are intended to elucidate this law.
• The second law deﬁnes force in terms of the instantaneous change in momentum.
Since momentum is a vector quantity, force is also a vector quantity. As deﬁned by
the second law, it replaces the inexact notions such as “inﬂuence,” or “agent.” Thus,
force is anything that can cause a change in momentum.
• The second law implies the ﬁrst law: If there is no external agent, there is no force;
hence, there is no change in momentum.
• In situations in which two or more agents apply forces on a moving object, the total
force causing the momentum change will be simply the vector sum of individual forces.
This vector sum is precisely Fnet.
• Fnet = ma becomes invalid in situations where mass varies. For such cases the concept
of force as the change in momentum per unit time must be used.
• Being vectors, both Fnet and a can be decomposed into components. Once this is
done, there is one equation for each component. The most common decomposition is
horizontal and vertical. This decomposition is useful in the study of some practical
motions. For instance, Example D.7.3 on page 19 of Appendix.pdf shows that a
projectile has the shape of a parabola, as Galileo pointed out (see Section 5.2.1), and
that the maximum range of a projectile is obtained when the angle of ﬁring is 45◦.
A freely falling body has a constant acceleration g of 9.81 m/s2. Thus, according to the
second law, there must be a force, F = mg acting on the body. This force, usually denoted
by w is called the weight of the object. Strictly speaking, there is a diﬀerence between
Concept of weight
clariﬁed.
mass and weight, although, in everyday language one speaks of the “weight” of an object
being “one kilogram.” As long as we are on the surface of the Earth, and ignore minor
variations in g at diﬀerent locations, weight and mass are equivalent. One has to bear in
mind, however, that on the surface of the Moon, for example, the weight of an object is less
than its weight on the surface of the Earth while the mass is exactly the same.
Now let’s consider some examples of the second law. In all cases, assume that the mass
of the object does not change so Equation (7.2) is valid.
Example 7.2.3. A mass is attached to the end of a rope and everything is at rest. Since the
mass is not moving, it has no acceleration, and the net force acting on the mass is zero. Gravity

pulls the mass down. So, there must be another force balancing the force of gravity. This is called
the tension in the rope. Tension is always directed along the rope.
■
What do you know? 7.7. Tarzan is clutching the top of a rope which can support a
maximum tension equal to Tarzan’s weight. The loose end of the rope is above a river
bed known to be infested with crocodiles, some of whom are circling right under the
rope. He starts to climb down the rope slightly. (a) Right after he starts to climb down,
what is the direction of the net force on Tarzan? (b) At that moment, which force is
bigger, Tarzan’s weight, or the tension in the rope? (c) Was it smart of him to move
downward?

Section 7.2
The Second Law of Motion

Example 7.2.4. A person starts to walk; a car takes oﬀ; a train starts to move; a plane takes
oﬀ. In all cases the velocity changes. Thus the person, the car, the train, and the plane all have
accelerations. Newton’s second law, then, implies that there are forces causing these accelerations.
Where do these forces come from? Stay tuned!
■
Example 7.2.5. A box of mass m rests on a rough ﬂoor and is pulled by too small a horizontal
force to move the box. Let us analyze the “motion” of this box.
If the box does not move, it has no acceleration. Vertically, there is the force of gravity pulling
the box down. But since the vertical acceleration is zero, the second law tells us that there must
be another force balancing the gravitational force. This force N, exerted by the ﬂoor on the box,
Normal force.
is called the normal force.
Horizontally, the acceleration is also zero. Therefore, the applied force must be balanced by
another force. This, of course, is the force of friction. It is interesting to note that as long as the
box does not move, the frictional force “adjusts itself” to the applied force! If the applied force
increases, but remains smaller than the maximum force of friction, the latter also increases. The
force of friction can, of course, never overpower the applied force. Otherwise, you would encounter
A spooky motion!
the spooky situation in which the box moves to the left while being pulled to the right!
As the applied force increases, a point will be reached at which this force will overcome the
maximum frictional force and the box will start to accelerate.
By measuring the acceleration
and the mass of the block, one can determine the frictional force between the box and the ﬂoor.
Example D.7.4 on page 20 of Appendix.pdf adds some numbers to this exercise.

momentum on your way down, and just before you hit the ground, you carry a considerable amount
of it. When you hit the ground your momentum reduces to zero. So there is a big change in your
momentum. Box 7.2.1 tells us that the larger the time interval ∆t is during which this change takes
place, the smaller the force. You instinctively continue the motion by bending your knees thereby
increasing the time interval. A stiﬀ-kneed jump causes the momentum to come to a sudden halt,
with ∆t considerably reduced. This can yield a large enough force to cause an injury.
Air bags are also based on this principle. In a collision, our head is thrown forward with a large

momentum. If it hits a solid object, it will stop very quickly (∆t is very small), and by the equation
of Box 7.2.1, the force F will be large, causing fractures, or even death. An air bag increases the
stopping time considerably, thereby decreasing the force.
Diving into water, jumping on a trampoline, or falling in a haystack increase the stoppage time,
and therefore, decrease the potentially damaging force.
■
An important example of motion, discussed earlier, is the uniform circular motion, in
which the acceleration points to the center—centripetal acceleration. Newton’s second law
now implies that there must be a net force which also points to the center. This force is
called a centripetal force. Every object moving on a circle with uniform speed experiences

a centripetal force. For a stone attached to the end of a string and whirled on a circle, the
centripetal force is the tension in the string. For the Moon or a satellite going around the
Earth, the centripetal force is gravitation. For an object in a centrifuge, the centripetal
force is the reaction force of the spinning container in which the object is placed. What is

Example 7.2.7. In the fall of a parachutist, two forces are present, the weight and the force of
air drag. The weight is, of course, constant but the air drag increase with speed. If the parachutist
opens her parachute early, the weight is larger than the air drag, and the parachutist accelerates
downward, her speed increasing. As the speed increases, so does the force of air drag. This process
continues until the force of air drag equals the weight. From this point on, the speed remains

constant. This constant speed is called the terminal velocity.
If the parachutist opens her parachute later, much later, the weight is smaller than the air
drag, and the parachutist decelerates, her speed decreasing. As the speed decreases, so does the
force of air drag. This process continues until the force of air drag reduces to the weight. Again,
from then on, the speed remains constant. Example D.7.5 on page 21 of Appendix.pdf adds
some numbers to the motion of a parachutist.

7.3
The Third Law of Motion
The ﬁrst and second laws concentrate on the motion of a single object (or a system of
objects). But they don’t give a complete picture of reality. In fact, we would have a very
chaotic world if only the ﬁrst two laws of motion were ruling it. The ground in Example
7.2.4 would “decide” when, where, and in which direction to push on people, cars, and
trains! Fortunately, there is a third law to prevent this haphazard reality.
The third law pays attention to both the agent and the receiver of the force. Stated
brieﬂy it says: To every action there is an opposing reaction. Put more elaborately—and
more precisely—it says:
Box 7.3.1. (Third Law of Motion) If object A exerts a force FAB on an object B,
then object B exerts a force FBA on object A such that FAB = −FBA.
Thus the two forces are in opposite directions.
It is extremely important to separate the agent of the force from its receiver. Failure
to do so is the cause of utter confusion, even for more experienced students. The classic
example of such a confusion is that of the horse pulling a buggy. By Newton’s third law,
the buggy also exerts a force on the horse which is equal in magnitude but opposite in
direction. Hence, the total force, which is the vector sum of these two forces, is zero. The
second law now says that the acceleration must be zero. How, then, can the horse pull the
buggy from rest? The answer is, as mentioned earlier, in separating the horse from the
buggy. To analyze the motion of the buggy, we must look at all the forces that act on the
buggy, only one of which is the force exerted by the horse. The force exerted by the buggy
on the horse is not among these forces, so it cannot cancel the force by the horse. Similarly,
to analyze the motion of the horse, we look at the forces that act on the horse, one of which
is the force exerted by the buggy. You’ll see the analysis of this motion further in Example
7.3.4.
What do you know? 7.10. A person is standing on a weight scale in an elevator
that has just started moving up. (a) What direction is the acceleration pointing? What
is the direction of the net force? (b) Beside gravity pointing down, what other force is
acting on the person? In which direction? (c) What is the reaction to this force? Is the
reading on the scale larger or smaller than the actual weight of the person?
Example 7.3.2. In Example 7.2.4 we concluded that on a person who just starts to walk (on a
ﬂat surface) there acts a force due to the second law.
Q: Where does this force come from?

Section 7.3
The Third Law of Motion
97
A: As you walk, you push on the ﬂoor (next time you walk, try to detect this push). A lot of
this (pushing) force is vertical, some of it is horizontal. For the force to have this crucial horizontal
component, the ﬂoor must have friction or traction. Newton’s third law implies that there is a
reaction from the ﬂoor onto the person to the horizontal component of this push. Newton’s second
law now implies an acceleration. Everybody has experienced the diﬃculty of walking on a slippery
ground. Walking on a ﬂat ﬂoor would be impossible if the traction were absent!
What about the other forces? Clearly, traction is not the only force acting on a walking person.
Do we not have to take these other forces into account? Indeed we do. However, it turns out
that the vector sum of all the other forces is zero. For instance, the weight of the person tends to
accelerate him downward, and if the ﬂoor were not there to stop him, he would move vertically
down. Since he has no downward acceleration, there must be a force by the ﬂoor on the person
which exactly balances his weight. Thus the ground exerts not only traction, but also the force
that balances gravity (the normal force).
■
What do you know? 7.11. A person is standing on a weight scale in an elevator
moving down. Suppose that the acceleeration of the elevator is g, the gravitational
acceleration. What is the reading on the scale?
The motion of a person standing on a scale while riding an elevator is more fully discussed
in Example D.7.6 on page 22 of Appendix.pdf .
Example 7.3.3. We also considered the acceleration of a car in Example 7.2.4 and concluded
that there must be a force acting on the car. A misconception is that it is the engine that pushes
the car. To see that the engine alone is incapable of moving the car, lift it oﬀthe ground. No
It is not the engine that
pushes the car forward!
amount of power delivered by the engine can move the car! As in the case of walking, through the
property of traction between the tires and the road, the car pushes on the ground. By the third
law, the ground pushes back on the car, causing its acceleration.
It is worth mentioning that the engine does exert a force on the rest of the car in a complicated
way. But in order to move the car plus the engine, an external agent must provide a force. This
external agent is the road. It is also important to note that the force of traction becomes meaningful
only when the surfaces in contact tend to move relative to one another. Although there is traction
between a standing car and the road, the force is activated only when the car starts to move.
■
What do you know? 7.12. In some roller coaster rides the roller coaster goes on
a vertical loop. Why don’t passengers fall down? Hint: The speed at the top of the
loop should be so large that the centripetal force on a given passenger is larger than
the weight of the passenger.
Example 7.3.4. Let’s return to the motion of the horse and buggy [Figure 7.4(a)]. First con-

centrate on the buggy [Figure 7.4(b)]. The buggy will start to move as soon as the force of friction
between its wheels and the ground is overcome. Thus, the horse must be able to exert on the
buggy a force at least as large as this frictional force. What about the horse? The buggy pulls
the horse back by a force which, in magnitude, equals the force exerted by the horse on the buggy
[Figure 7.4(c)]. If the horse is to move, there must be another force acting on the horse. The
horse’s stamping, kicking, and pushing on the icy ground in winter, is its honest struggle to create
a traction between its hooves and the ground! It is this traction on the horse that causes the whole
motion.

the kindergartener on the team. Now the team exerts a larger force, causing the kindergartener
to move towards the team. Is the kindergartener exerting a force on the team equal to the force
of the team on the kindergartener? The tendency is to say “No,” because of the apparent lack of
symmetry. However, even in this case the forces are equal!
The reason that the kindergartener moves is because the net force on him is nonzero: the force
by the football team is larger than the traction (friction) between the kindergartener and the ﬂoor.
How the kindergartener
can win the tug-of-war.
The reason that the team does not move is because the kindergartener’s force on the team, which
is equal to the team’s force on the kindergartener, exactly balances the traction between the team
and the ﬂoor. If the kindergartener were standing on a rough ﬂoor and the team on an (almost)
inﬁnitely smooth surface, then the kindergartener would win the competition, because now even
the slightest pull by the kindergartener can overcome the very tiny traction between the team and
the surface!
■
The three laws of motion, discovered by Newton, and described in this chapter, are
the three pillars upon which most of what is known as “classical physics” is built. Special
emphasis must be placed on the second law because it relates the source of motion, force,
with a kinematics variable, acceleration.
The task of physics, for about two hundred years after Newton, was to apply, test,
and mathematically re-express these laws in as many novel situations as possible. In all
cases these laws proved to be true. The only problem facing physicists was the formulas
expressing forces. Once the force became known, the second law would take over and predict
the motion of particles under the inﬂuence of the given force. No wonder classical physics
and “Newtonian physics” have become synonymous.
It was only at the beginning of the twentieth century, when all attempts at applying
Newtonian physics to the domain of atoms, and also to the domain of extremely fast objects
failed, that new theories, quantum theory for atoms and relativity for the fast objects, were
forced on the physics community.

Answers to “What do you know?”
7.1.
Remember that momentum is a vector quantity. This means that you can change
it by changing its direction. Since the direction of the momentum of a system (which is
the direction of the system’s motion) changes if it moves on a circle, the momentum itself
changes. Therefore, the system cannot be isolated.
7.2. Since the two momenta are equal and opposite in direction, they cancel to zero. After
they stick, the momentum is also zero. So, the two stuck balls do not move.
7.3.
(c) Unless you know where the original ball is going, you can’t say anything about
the motion of the other 8 balls, because it is the total momentum that does not change. On
the other hand, when you include the original ball, then you can say that the momentum
of all 9 balls add up to a momentum pointing to the left. Not only that, but that this total
momentum is equal to the initial momentum of the original ball.

Section 7.4
End-of-Chapter Material

7.4.
In the experiment of Figure 7.3, the ratio of the masses is equal to the inverse ratio
of the speeds. So, if A is moving twice as fast as B, it must be half as massive as B. So, B
is twice as massive as A. Since A is 10 kg, B must be 20 kg.
7.5.
The bullet in the gun and the gun form an isolated system, which initially has zero
total momentum. When the bullet comes out, it has a momentum in the forward direction.
Therefore, the gun must have a momentum in the backward direction. That’s the kick!
If the bullet is more massive and comes out with the same speed, then its momentum is
larger, and the kick should be stronger.
7.6. At the beginning, a little fuel comes out carrying a little bit of momentum. The rocket
has the same momentum but with all the fuel inside, it can move very slowly. As the fuel
is ejected, the rocket becomes lighter and, even though the momentum of the ejected fuel
and the rocket are the same, the rocket moves faster than before.

downward force. (c) No! Because if he stops, i.e., if he decelerates, the acceleration will be
upward; so the tension will be larger than Tarzan’s weight. But the maximum tension the
rope can support is his weight. So, the rope will sever!
7.8. If Tarzan starts moving up, he will be accelerating upward, so the net force will also
be upward. This means that the tension will be bigger than the weight, and the rope will
break! So, he has a better chance of survival if he stays put.
7.9.
It is the traction (friction) between the tires and the road. To see that it is indeed
the traction that keeps the car on the circle, imagine what would happen if the road were
icy (with little traction).
7.10.
(a) Since the elevator has just started moving up, acceleration is upward. The net
force is also upward. (b) The scale is pushing the person upward (the normal force). And
this force is larger than the weight of the person because the net force is upward. (c) By the
third law the person is pushing back on the scale with a force equal to the force of the scale
on person. Thus, the reading of the scale is larger than the actual weight of the person.
7.11. The net force on the person is his weight (his mass times g) pointing down and the
force of the scale on him, pointing up. The net force is his mass times the acceleration of
the elevator. Since this acceleration is g, the net force is the same as his weight. Therefore,
the force of the scale on him is zero. The reaction to this force, the force he exerts on the
scale, is also zero. So, the reading of the scale is zero! He is weightless!
7.12.
If the speed is large enough, the centripetal force (which is the net force, because
it is mass times the centripetal acceleration) on any given passenger at the very top of the
loop can be larger than his/her weight. This means that the track must be pushing the
passenger downward. Therefore, the person (really the car in which he/she is sitting) must
be pushing up on the track. If it is pushing up on the track, it cannot fall down!

Chapter Glossary
Centripetal Force The force on any object that moves on a circle. It is the force that
keeps the object on the circle.
Force Anything that changes the momentum of a system. Everything else being equal, the
force that changes the momentum faster is stronger.
Friction A force that acts against the motion of an object. It is present whenever the
surface of the object is in contact with another surface.
Inertia The property of an object that maintains its state of motion. Objects with large
inertia tend to resist any change in their motion more than objects with smaller inertia.
Kilogram (kg) The scientiﬁc unit of mass.

Chapter 7
Dynamics: Cause of Motion
Mass Measures the inertia of an object. The ratio of the speed of the standard of mass
(kept in Paris) to the speed of the object whose mass is to be determined, in an
experiment in which the standard mass and the object are at ﬁrst stationary and then
ﬂy apart due to an internal mechanism.
Momentum Also known as the quantity of motion, is a vector quantity in terms of which
the ﬁrst law of motion is stated. An isolated system retains its momentum forever.
Momentum Conservation The essence of the ﬁrst law of motion. The momentum of an
isolated system is conserved (i.e., it does not change).
Newton (N) The scientiﬁc unit in which force is measured.
Normal Force The force felt by any object that is placed on a surface.
It is usually
perpendicular to the surface of contact.
Tension (As in a rope) is the force that a rope sustains when it is stretched. The harder
the stretching, the larger the tension.
Weight The force of gravity exerted on an object is its weight.

Further Topics on Motion
The universality of Newton’s laws of motion invites their application in a wide variety of
situations. Newton himself applied these laws to the solar system and obtained the entire
collection of results previously discovered by other means, including Kepler’s three laws of
planetary motion. The post-Newtonian physicists and mathematicians applied the same
set of laws to the motion of objects on Earth, and a burgeoning of ideas and techniques—
ideas and techniques that created entirely new branches of mathematics and physics, not
to mention other sciences—ensued.
The development of mathematical tools, in conjunction with the variety of application
of the laws of motion led to the introduction of new concepts in mechanics.
Concepts
which, although taken from ordinary imprecise experiences, were given precise mathematical
meaning. Some of these concepts proved to be extremely helpful in solving some diﬃcult
dynamical problems. Two such concepts are work and energy with which this chapter starts.
8.1
Work and Energy
By now the reader has noticed that the words used in everyday life acquire special, precise—
and sometimes strange—meanings in the hands of physicists.
This applies not only to
physics, but to all sciences and especially in mathematics. For instance, take the word
“function,” whose ordinary meanings include such notions as “normal or characteristic
actions,” “a special duty,” “occupation or employment,” and “a formal ceremony.”
In
mathematics, function becomes a speciﬁc association between two sets of objects. Such a
precision and speciﬁcity is at the root—and a prerequisite—of the development of science.
This is particularly pronounced in physics, nicknamed “the queen of sciences” and even
more so in mathematics, whose ﬁrst encounter with precision goes back to 300 BC when
Euclid axiomatized geometry.
The concepts of work and energy are no exceptions.
For a physicist a weight lifter
sweating under 250 lb of weight is not doing any work as long as he does not move the
weight! This may appear cruelly ungratifying, but physics demands precision not emotional
justiﬁcation. It has been found—by numerous historical trials and errors—that no motion
implies no work. The situation is worse than this. Even if there is motion, there is no
guarantee that work is being done!
Work deﬁned.

The work done on an object can be negative, zero, or positive depending on the angle

Box 8.1.1. Work (W) done by a force F is displacement (d) times the component of
force along that displacement, and is thus nonzero only if the force that causes the work
is not always perpendicular to the instantaneous velocity. We write W = F||d, and
interpret F|| as the component of the force along the displacement.

tension in the string, and the air drag. The work of which force is positive, negative, or
zero?
aMake sure nobody’s head is on the path of the stone!
If the force makes an acute angle with velocity (it reinforces the motion), the work

is positive, otherwise the work is negative because an obtuse angle hinders the motion
(Figure 8.1). The unit of work is N·m, which is also called Joule, named after James Joule
whose careful analysis of heat led to the equivalence of heat and energy (to be discussed
later in the book).
8.1.1
Conservation of Mechanical Energy
The second law of motion tells us that a (net) force acting on an object changes its momen-
tum, and therefore its velocity.1 This change in momentum accompanies a displacement
of the object. Hence, a net work is done on the object (assuming that the net force is not
perpendicular to the displacement). Therefore, when a net work is done on an object, its
speed changes. A quantitative analysis of the dynamics of the object shows that a quantity
can be deﬁned so that the change in this quantity during the action of the force is precisely
the work done on the object. This quantity is called the kinetic energy (KE) of the object
in motion:
Work = Change in KE
or
W = ∆(KE).
(8.1)
If this is to hold in Newtonian mechanics, then KE has to be deﬁned as (see Math Note
E.8.1 on page 80 of Appendix.pdf for details)
Kinetic energy deﬁned.
KE = 1

where m is the mass and v the speed of the object. Since work is related to (the change in
the) KE, the latter must have the same unit, Joule.
Unit of work and energy
is Joule (J).
Example 8.1.2. A 5-kg block, moving with a speed of 10 m/s, comes to a stop after covering a
distance of 5 meters.
Q: What is the work done by the force of friction, and how big is that force?
A: The change in KE, i.e., the ﬁnal KE minus the initial KE, is equal to the work done by
friction. But ∆KE = 1

2 × 5 × 102 = −250 J. So, the work done by friction
is −250 J. Furthermore, W = F||d, or since force of friction is parallel to the direction of motion,
−250 = Ffric × 5 yielding −50 N for the force of friction. The minus sign tells us that the friction
opposes the motion.
■
What do you know?
8.2. Consider the motion of a parachutist who opens the
parachute from the very beginning. Is the work done by her weight positive, negative,
or zero? Is the work done by air drag positive, negative, or zero? Is the work done
by the net force positive, negative, or zero? Is the change in kinetic energy positive,
negative, or zero?
An omnipresent force is gravity. So, it is worthwhile to apply Equation (8.1) to the force
of gravity. Figure 8.2 shows an object fall from an initial height h1 to a ﬁnal height h2. The
force of gravity (or the weight of the falling object) is mg and the parallel displacement is
h1 −h2. Thus, the work done by gravity is mg(h1 −h2). The change in KE is KE2 −KE1.
Equating these two quantities and rearranging terms, we obtain mgh1+KE1 = mgh2+KE2.
This is a very interesting and important result. It states that the quantity mgh + KE,
where h denotes the height, is the same for both initial point (point 1) and ﬁnal point (point
2). It is customary to deﬁne the gravitational potential energy as
Gravitational PE.
PE = mgh.
(8.3)
Then the equation above can be written as PE1 + KE1 = PE2 + KE2, which is the
statement of the conservation of mechanical energy. It says that if one adds the potential
energy at a point P1 to the kinetic energy at P1, one obtains the same numerical value as
the corresponding sum at any other point P2. Since P1 and P2 are arbitrarily chosen, one
can state
Box 8.1.3. (Conservation of Mechanical Energy) The total mechanical energy
ME = KE + PE of a system is a constant during the entire motion of the system.
What do you know?
8.3. Consider the motion of a parachutist who opens the
parachute much later. Is the work done by her weight positive, negative, or zero? Is
the work done by air drag positive, negative, or zero? Is the work done by the net force
positive, negative, or zero? Is the change in kinetic energy positive, negative, or zero?
The name “potential energy” was not given capriciously. To lift an object to a new
height, we must do work on the object. The object in return acquires the capacity or the

“potential” to do useful work for us: If we let it go, it will pick up (kinetic) energy, which
could be used to drive a wheel, for example. The turbines of a hydroelectric power plant
use the potential energy of the water dropped from a height to produce electricity.

Gravity is not the only force leading to potential energy. The following example discusses
another common PE.
Example 8.1.5. Consider a block attached to one end of a spring whose other end is held ﬁrmly
to a wall (Figure 8.3). The block is allowed to move on a perfectly smooth horizontal surface.
Initially the block is at rest at point O. Now stretch the spring to a position A and let go of it.
The subsequent motion is a succession of compression and elongation of the spring. Whenever the
spring is either compressed or stretched it has the potential of doing work, thus it has a potential
energy. This potential energy is maximum when the spring is maximally stretched or compressed,
i.e., at points A and B. Since the spring is neither stretched nor compressed at O, we say that the
potential energy is zero there. At any other point between A and B, the potential energy acquires
a value between zero and its maximum value. On the other hand, the kinetic energy is zero at A
or B because the block comes to a temporary rest at these two points. The maximum of the KE
takes place at O where the block moves at the greatest speed.
■
Equation (8.3) contains h, height. But height relative to what? Somebody on the ﬁrst
Height is measured
relative to a convenient
(and arbitrary) reference
level.
ﬂoor of the Science Building wants to measure height relative to the ground, which is a few
meters below the ground of another person, who happens to be on the second ﬂoor. So,
which ﬂoor does one have to use for measuring height? The answer: it doesn’t matter! It
turns out that it is the diﬀerence in PE that is of physical signiﬁcance, and this diﬀerence
is independent of the “ﬂoor.”
Place a ball at the edge of a table. Now jerk it horizontally so that when it leaves the
table, it has some horizontal speed. As it hits the ﬂoor, its motion is no longer horizontal,
but makes an angle with the ﬂoor. It is possible to break the motion of the ball into vertical
and horizontal components and, using the second law of motion, ﬁnd the horizontal and
vertical velocities of the ball, its speed, and the angle it makes with the horizontal as it hits
the ﬂoor. This is rather complicated, and requires some trigonometry. However, if we are
interested only in the speed of the ball, we can easily obtain it using the principle of the

conservation of mechanical energy. Example D.8.1 on page 24 of Appendix.pdf shows
how to do this.
A roller coaster starts from a very high altitude (with no kinetic energy but a lot of
potential energy). As it reaches lower altitudes, its potential energy is partially converted
to kinetic energy. When it climbs back up a hill, its KE is partially converted to PE. The
continuous conversion of PE into KE and vice versa is what makes the motion of a roller
coaster exciting. Example D.8.2 on page 25 of Appendix.pdf calculates the speed of a
particular passenger of a roller coaster at various points of its track.

passenger) of 100 kg. What happens if the passenger is heavier (or lighter)? The values

of the forces and the energies will change. However, the values of the speeds had better
not change! If it did, some cars will be going faster than others, and will be pulling on the
latches connecting them to the slower cars, causing them to snap! The interested reader is
urged to go through the example using a diﬀerent mass to see that this is indeed the case.
Math Note E.8.2 on page 81 of Appendix.pdf proves this claim rigorously.
We have to emphasize that both KE and PE are deﬁned in such a way that the
foregoing conservation law becomes valid. It is also important to note that the conservation
of mechanical energy does not always hold. For instance, if the system of the block and
spring is laid on a rough surface, the block will come to rest after a while, losing all of its
KE and PE. Later in the book you will see that this decrease in the mechanical energy is
not a loss, but a transformation into another form of energy, heat. A system for which the

conservation of mechanical energy holds is called a conservative system.
Food for Thought
FFT 8.1.6. The word “energy” has been unfairly subjected to a lot of abuse in the hands of
alternative medical practitioners, where it has been given a stature equivalent to “aura,” “soul,”
and the Chinese mystical “Qi.” This is mainly because of the misconception that energy is “non-
material.” In the community of alternative medicine, where pseudoscientiﬁc ideas are the basis
of the enterprise, where spiritual entities are believed to be the cause of diseases, energy—and its
cousin, ﬁeld—become an attractive companion to those mystical entities.
Contrary to the misguided misconception of the alternative medical community, energy is a

on—and interaction with—matter. When we talk about potential energy, we not only think of
the energy of a material object such as a ball or a body of water, but this energy will eventually
manifest itself through interaction with material objects. This potential energy will eventually turn
into kinetic energy, and the latter will be transferred to another material object (e.g., a turbine)
upon impact, and this transfer of energy can be measured and recorded on instruments. An energy
that can only be felt by the “hands of a healer,” or the “soul of a preacher,” or the “mind of a Qi
master” does not exist.
As you will see later, potential energy is a manifestation of a ﬁeld, which is as material as a
tennis ball, a car, or a train. Just as a ball, a car, or a train can make itself felt when it collides
with a racket, another car, or a truck, so do the electromagnetic ﬁelds make themselves felt when
they “collide” with the antenna of a radio, a television, or a cellular phone.
Not only is energy a manifestation of solely material objects, but modern physics has shown
that energy itself is material. The ﬁelds causing potential energy are nothing but a huge army of
material subatomic particles. In the case of the electromagnetic ﬁelds, these particles are called
photons.

We can rewrite Equation (8.4) as energy = power × time or E = Pt, suggesting the
deﬁnition of Joules as Watt·second. In fact, there is a unit of energy in commercial use
which is based on this idea. Let ∆t be one hour (3600 s) and with power in units of Watts,
deﬁne a unit of energy called Watt·hour, where
1 Watt·hour = 1 Watt × 1 hour = 1 Watt × 3600 s
= 3600 Watt·s = 3600 Joules.
The more common unit of energy used commercially is 1000 times this and is called kilo-
Watt-hour, abbreviated kWh. Thus, 1 kWh = 3.6 × 106 J.

As an example, consider a 100 Watt light bulb that is on 8 hours a day. The daily energy

15 cents per kWh, the daily cost of this bulb would be 12 cents.

the dawn of industrial revolution, when heavy machines such as steam engines were being
invented, the tendency was to compare them with the “natural machines” in use, namely
the beasts of burden. Although the strength of horses varied widely, it was not hard to
average over this variety and come up with an ideal average horse and quantify the output
of such a horse.
A horse power was soon to be deﬁned as the amount of work an ideal horse performs in
one minute. By studying various horses, it was decided that the ideal average horse can lift

3300 lb to a height of 10 ft in one minute. To see how many Watts there are in a horse power,
note that there are 2.204634 lb per kilogram. So, 3300 lb is 3, 300/2.204634 = 1, 496.85 kg.
Multiply this by 9.8 to get the weight, i.e., the force associated with 3300 lb. This yields
14,669.13 N, and if a horse lifts this weight to a height of 3.048 meters (each foot is 0.3048 m),
then it will be doing 14, 669.13 × 3.048 = 44, 711.5 J of work. Since this work is done in 60
seconds, the power of an ideal horse will be 44, 711.5/60 = 745.2 Watts. Oﬃcially, a horse
power is equivalent to 745.7 Watts.
8.1.3
The Physics of Santa Claus
First let me assure the reader that the title of this subsection is not a joke! Physics has a
lot to say about Santa Claus, especially when it comes to his consumption of energy. This
subsection is devoted to an analysis of the amount of energy Santa needs to make all his
deliveries as well as the consequences of his stops and starts. Because of the very diﬃcult
task Santa is facing, in the following analysis I shall make life as easy as possible for him
by estimating quantities enormously in his favor.
Start by estimating the number of houses Santa has to visit. There are approximately
2.1 billion Christians in the world, and—estimating drastically in Santa’s favor—let us
assume that eligible children constitute only 7 percent (or 0.07) of this population. Thus,
the number of children he has to visit is 2.1 billion times 0.07 or approximately 150 million.
The number of houses Santa has to visit depends on how many children live in each
house: The more children live in a typical house, the fewer houses he will have to visit. To

houses!
make life really easy for Santa, let’s assume a (very high) concentration of 6 children per
house. This brings the number of houses down to 1.5 × 108/6 = 2.5 × 107, or 25 million
chimneys to plunge down and climb up!
Santa cannot aﬀord to spend too much time in each house, because he has only 24 hours
to deliver all the toys he is carrying.2 On the other hand, he cannot spend too little time
moving through a chimney, because then his speed may be so huge as to require too much
energy to attain. As Math Note E.8.3 on page 81 of Appendix.pdf shows, the optimal
time spent per chimney—the time that minimizes Santa’s energy consumption—is about
26 microseconds;3 so Santa covers over 38,000 chimneys every second! Since this does not
violate any laws of physics, let’s accept it. After all, we are all on Santa’s side!
For 25 million chimneys, he needs 25,000,000×26 × 10−6 = 650 seconds. Since there are
84,600 seconds in 24 hours, only 85,750 seconds are left for Santa to hop from chimney to
chimney to chimney . . . all 25 million of them. Ignore the time he spends in each house
ﬁnding the appropriate place for the gifts, taking them out of his bag, and placing them
down, although these are legitimate concerns. Nevertheless, can he make all the deliveries?
It depends on how fast he will be moving from house to house.
To further help Santa in his seemingly impossible task, we make the houses very small,
Santa has to travel with
a speed of 10,000 mph
to deliver all the toys!
bring them next to each other, and place them side by side on a straight line. Suppose that
all this sets the distance between consecutive chimneys to be merely 50 ft or 15 meters,
with a total distance of 15×2.5×107 = 3.75×108 m. Since he has 85,750 seconds to travel
this distance, Santa’s speed will be 3.75 × 108/85750 = 4373 m/s. This is larger than half
the speed of the fastest humanly possible vehicle, and covers the NY-LA distance in less
than 20 minutes! Although implausible, let’s assume that it is possible.
It appears that we have allowed Santa to accomplish his task.
Or have we?
Any
travel requires fuel (or energy).
Now let’s estimate the energy consumption of Santa’s
journey, which is assumed to be used simply to speed him (and his toys) up.4
Every

not essential.
3A microsecond is a millionth (or 10−6) second.

which are responsible for almost all the fuel cost for ordinary people.

114
Chapter 8

time Santa increases his speed, there is a corresponding increase in his kinetic energy,
which requires fuel. To ﬁnd Santa’s kinetic energy, we need his total mass. Assuming an
average mass of 2 kg per toy—and only one toy per child—Santa’s initial cargo mass is
2 × 1.5 × 108 = 3 × 108 kg. Since this mass decreases as Santa delivers the toys, take the
eﬀective mass to be the average of this initial mass and the ﬁnal mass (zero), or 1.5 × 108

kg. [It turns out that this average mass gives the same result as exactly calculating the
kinetic energy of individual hops and adding them.] Therefore, the attainment of a speed of
4373 m/s from rest requires an energy of KEhop = 1
2(1.5×108)(4373)2 or 1.43×1015 Joules.
Thus, every time Santa hops from one chimney to the adjacent one, he speeds up from zero
to 4373 m/s, and in the process, consumes 1.43×1015 Joules. For all the 25 million chimneys
he needs 3.6 × 1022 Joules.
This is one part of the energy Santa needs for his mission. Remember his plunging and
Santa’s speed in the
chimney is 688,000 mph!
climbing through the chimneys? That requires energy too. First, what is his speed in the
chimneys? Assuming a (short) chimney length of 4 meters, the round trip distance is 8
meters, which Santa has to cover in 26 microseconds. This gives a speed of 8/26 × 10−6 =
307692 m/s.
Suppose that Santa leaves his cargo on the roof of each house he is visiting, and carries
only the toys through the chimney. The energy required for his trip down—for a thin Santa
of only 100 kg—is × 1
2(112)(307692)2 = 5.3×1012 Joules, where the extra 12 kg in the mass
accounts for the 6 toys he is carrying. For the trip up, the energy is 1
2(100)(307692)2 = 4.7×
1012 Joules. Thus, the total chimney energy per house is the sum of these two, or 1013 Joules.
The chimney energy for the 25 million houses is (2.5 × 107) × (1013) = 2.5 × 1020 Joules.
This is less than 1% of the energy needed for hopping from chimney to chimney. So, let’s
take the latter to be the total energy.
The hopping energy, 3.6 × 1022 Joules, is huge. Nevertheless, it is the minimum amount
he can spend. But what does it really mean? To get a feel for its magnitude, you have
to compare it with another huge quantity of energy. For example, how does it compare
with the yearly energy consumption of the world? The entire annual energy consumption
of the world was about 4×1020 Joules in 2001 [DOE 01]. This included not only the typical
Santa uses 90 times the
annual world energy
supply in one day!
residential usage such as heating, lighting, cooking, commuting, and entertainment, but also
the large scale industrial, agricultural, and transportation consumption; and 4×1020 Joules
is typical of the recent annual consumptions. Santa uses 3.6 × 1022/4 × 1020 = 90 times the
annual world energy supply in one day! Thus, the entire world must stop using any form
of energy for 90 years so that Santa can deliver his toys in one day! Clearly Santa’s visit
cannot be an annual event. At best it can be a centennial event, for the preparation of which
the whole population of the world (Christian and non-Christian) must stop consuming any
form of energy for the entire century!
Although extremely diﬃcult, the people of the world might be willing to tolerate all the
harshness caused by Santa’s trip were it not for the revelation that behind his jolliness and
smile there is destruction. Huge destruction in the form of massive explosions! Of course,
Santa’s explosions are not intentional. He just can’t help exploding houses as he visits them!
How can that be?
An explosion is simply the release of a large amount of energy in a small time period.
Santa’s plunge heat is
tons of TNT!
Take Santa’s plunge down a typical chimney. We found that he has a kinetic energy of
5.3 × 1012 Joules when he reaches the bottom of the chimney. This energy turns into heat
when he brakes to a complete stop. For comparison, the heat produced in the explosion of a
ton of TNT is about 4×109 Joules. Thus, Santa releases the equivalent of 5.3×1012/4×109 =
1325 tons of TNT when landing in the house, and almost the same amount when he climbs
up the chimney and stops at the roof! And a time interval of 13 microseconds for each of
these releases is short enough to qualify them as explosions.
But the real killer is the explosion caused by his landing at the chimney as he comes

chimney to the next—which, by the way, is 85750/2.5 × 107 = 0.0034 second, qualifying
this release of energy as an explosion as well. How many tons of TNT is this equivalent to?
1.43 × 1015/4 × 109 = 357,000 tons of TNT! Suﬃce it to say that the destructive power of
“Little Boy,” the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima, was a “mere” 15,000 tons of TNT.
Every time Santa lands at a chimney, he detonates about 24 Hiroshima-type bombs, and
he is at ground zero of every blast!
8.2
Rigid Body Motion
One of the diﬃculties with applying Newton’s laws of motion is that ordinary objects are
not points; yet the laws can only be applied to points. The very essential act of constructing
the position vector of a train relative to a person becomes a confusing issue: it is not clear
which part of the person is to be connected to which part of the train to construct the
position vector. This leads to the technique of breaking up objects into inﬁnitesimal pieces
and applying the laws to those pieces, and ﬁnally somehow summing up the motion of all
individual “point” pieces. Two simple cases of the application of this technique—a rigid
body and an incompressible ﬂuid—are important. The simpler case of a rigid body is the
subject of this section.
Food for Thought
FFT 8.2.1. The conclusion of the preceding analysis would be a devastating blow to the spirit
of a three year old. However you, the reader of these lines, have no diﬃculty accepting the force
of logic and the laws of physics, and convincing yourself that the story of Santa Claus is simply
a superstition. In fact, arguments at a much lower level than the analysis above have no doubt
convinced you of the nonexistence of Santa Claus.
But have you rid yourself of other, more
sophisticated, forms of superstition?
There are various levels of superstition. Santa Claus and his cousins, the Easter bunny and
leprechauns, are “introductory” superstitions, out of which you grow by the time you reach junior
high school. At the “intermediate” level, we have astrology, “scientiﬁc” creationism, psychic and
palm reading—to name a few—to which a large fraction of our adult population subscribes. It
does not take much to “convince” even a college student that UFOs exist, that certain people have
the ability to predict the future, that it is possible to heal the body by the power of the mind.
“Advanced superstition” consists of such delicate and scientiﬁcally cloaked disciplines as the
alternative medicine, chiropractic, and psychoanalysis, which are the subject of academic “research”
at our institutions of higher learning. When college students see their professors specializing in
psychoanalysis conduct “research,” just as chemists do, write textbooks, which are adopted by
many universities, just as chemists do, and attend conferences to present papers and exchange
ideas, just as chemists do, it becomes very hard to convince students that there is a substantial
diﬀerence between chemistry and psychoanalysis. Alas, no simple formula can be written down to
refute the discipline of psychoanalysis as there is to refute the existence of Santa Claus.
The heart of the problem is diﬀerentiating between proof and plausibility. We have not proved
that Santa Claus does not exist. We can never prove that, just as we cannot prove that Elvis does
not show up at midnight in Graceland (see Section 43.1.3). It is impossible to prove a negative
statement. However, the implausibility of Santa’s trip is so strong that it can almost replace the
proof of his nonexistence.
Unfortunately, we cannot say the same thing about other “higher superstitions.” They require
a much more sophisticated critical examination. Their implausibility will be revealed only to those

who are exposed to the inner workings of natural sciences. Only then can they see the universality
(and limitation) of the laws governing the natural phenomena, and judge for themselves that certain
phenomena are simply so implausible that they can be called impossible.
A powerful factor that prevents children from getting rid of superstition is the inﬂuence of the
adults. We cannot ignore the crucial role of parents and society on the upbringing of a citizen.

The reason that we no longer believe in Santa Claus by the time we ﬁnish elementary school is not
that we have been exposed to the type of argument presented above. It is that our parents, and

all the adults with whom we come in contact during our adolescence, give us the message that it is
time we left our sweet childhood belief in Santa behind us. The same parents and the same adult
population do not give us the message that psychics do not have any special “power” or “gift,” that
palm readers cannot give us any useful advice, that horoscopes will not tell us about our future,
and that psychoanalysis, alternative medicine, herbology, etc. are as eﬀective as drinking a glass
of water.
Figure 8.4: The motion of a rigid body is the superposition of a translation of the center of mass and a
rotation about the center of mass. The picture describes the motion of a wrench after it is thrown. Notice
how the center of mass of the wrench (the dot on it) follows the path that a point particle would describe.
As a car moves on a highway—ignoring certain internal relative motion of its parts—

8.2.1
Center of Mass
Although a rigid body may appear complicated at ﬁrst glance, its motion turns out to be
a superposition of two simple motions. The overall motion of a rigid body is described by
the translation of a single point, called the center of mass (CM) of the rigid body, plus a
rotation about the center of mass (Figure 8.4).
What do you know? 8.6. How does the motion of the wrench of Figure 8.4 appear
to you if you were riding along with its center of mass?
We shall not dwell on the concept of the center of mass.
Suﬃce it to say that for
uniform symmetric geometrical ﬁgures it coincides with the center of symmetry. Thus, the
geometric center of a uniform cube or sphere is also its CM. Operationally, CM, sometimes
called center of gravity, is determined to be the point on which the object can be balanced.
External force
determines motion of
center of mass.
The basic property of the center of mass is that the overall translation of the rigid body
due to external forces can be determined by assuming that all its mass is concentrated at
CM and applying the second law of motion to it.

Section 8.2
Rigid Body Motion
117
8.2.2
Angular Momentum
Once the translation of the rigid body is determined as above, one can concentrate on
rotation by situating oneself at the CM. Then the rigid body will appear to be only rotating.
Rotation about an axis.
The simplest kind of rotation is that about a ﬁxed axis, called the axis of rotation. Such a
rotation is characterized by the property that the perpendicular distance from any point of
the rigid body to the axis of rotation remains unchanged during the course of the motion.
Thus, the top in Figure 8.5(a) rotates about the axis Oz making an angle α with the vertical.
Another noteworthy example of rotating objects is that of the Earth as it moves around
the Sun. The center of the Earth translates on the Earth’s orbit making a full circle in
approximately 365 days. Superimposed on this motion is the rotation of the Earth about
an axis connecting the north and the south poles. The latter motion is called spin while the
former is the orbital rotation. The axis of spin is slightly tilted with respect to the plane of
the orbit, giving rise to seasons.
Rotations are also described in terms of angular momentum. For the simplest kind
Angular momentum.
of rotation, namely rotation about a ﬁxed axis, angular momentum is a vector J along the
axis of rotation whose direction is determined by the sense of rotation. Speciﬁcally, if an
ordinary (so-called right-handed) screw is allowed to turn in the direction of rotation, it will
advance in the direction of angular momentum. An equivalent way of ﬁnding the direction
of angular momentum is using the so-called right-hand rule (RHR): Curl the ﬁngers of your
right hand in the direction of rotation, the direction of the angular momentum vector will
be deﬁned by your stretched thumb [Figure 8.5(b)].
The magnitude of J in this simple case can be written as J = Iω where ω is the speed
of rotation, called angular velocity, and I is called the moment of inertia, or rotational
Moment of inertia.
inertia. In a qualitative sense, the moment of inertia is a measure of the resistance of the
rotating object to a change in its state of motion. Thus, moment of inertia is to rotation
what mass is to translation. It is possible to write a mathematical formula relating I to the
mass and the “extension” of the object. We shall forego this relation, but simply point out
that
Box 8.2.2. The farther the mass concentration is from the axis of rotation, the larger
the moment of inertia.
If a single (point) object is rotating on a circle about an axis perpendicular to the area
of the circle, then the magnitude of the angular momentum of the object is deﬁned as the
product of its (linear) momentum p and the radius of the circle.
J = rp = rmv
(8.5)
It can also be written as Iω, where ω = v/r and I = mr2 for a single point object.
The word “momentum” used in christening J is not without purpose.
Recall that
ordinary momentum was conserved when there were no external agents. The same is true
for angular momentum. The law of angular momentum conservation states that
Box 8.2.3. (Conservation of Angular Momentum) The angular momentum of an
isolated system remains constant.
This means that both its direction and its magnitude will remain unchanged. The following
examples illustrate this law.
Example 8.2.4. A pirouetting ice skater opens up her arms to slow down. This is because by
opening her arms, she sends some of the mass of her body away from the axis of rotation (running

vertically through her body), causing an increase in I. Since J is constant, the angular speed ω
must decrease to keep the product Iω unchanged. Similarly, by bringing her arms in, she can speed
up because the folding of the arms decreases I.
Divers crouch in midair to reduce their rotational inertia. This increases their angular speed,
allowing them to perform more somersaults in the little time available to them from the diving
board to the surface of the water.
A bicycle at rest cannot stand. As soon as it starts to move, the wheels acquire an angular
momentum in a horizontal direction (remember the right-hand rule), which resists any change. As
long as there is no severe push or pull to the sides, the conservation of angular momentum ensures
the constancy of the rotation (and thus the motion) of the bicycle wheels.
Bullets are given a little angular momentum by having them traverse a helical path in the
barrel of a gun. This gives a little more stability to the bullet’s motion, because any external agent
trying to alter the motion of the bullet encounters an additional resistance due to the angular
momentum of the bullet similar to the resistance of a bicycle to falling when it is in motion.
Artiﬁcial satellites are given a little rotation to provide their motion with an extra stability.
With angular momentum added to their motion, it will be harder to alter their course.

What do you know? 8.7. Why do tightrope walkers carry such a long pole as they
walk on the rope?
Just as a general rigid body motion is a superposition of a translation—of the center
of mass—and a rotation (about the CM), total angular momentum is a superposition of
orbital angular momentum and spin. For instance, in the case of the Earth, the orbital
angular momentum is associated with the revolution of its CM around the Sun, while the
spin measures that part of the (total) angular momentum arising from the rotation of the
Earth around its own axis, causing alternate succession of days and nights.
The concepts of spin and orbital angular momentum become particularly important
in the quantum theory of subatomic particles. It is shown in quantum theory that spin,
orbital, and total angular momenta are all quantized. Furthermore, particles with diﬀerent
spins have fundamentally diﬀerent properties. More on these later.

Mechanics of Fluids
Newton’s laws of motion can not only describe the behavior of point particles and rigid
bodies, but also the more complicated objects called ﬂuids. These are substances which
change their shapes easily. Common examples of ﬂuids are liquids and gases.
8.3.1
Hydrostatics
First let’s study ﬂuids at rest. In this subsection assume that all parts of the body of ﬂuid
under consideration are motionless as in a quiet pond, or a glass of water sitting on a table.
Buoyancy
Now consider any “piece” of the ﬂuid. Since the piece is at rest, its velocity must be zero.
In addition, there is no change in this velocity. Therefore, its acceleration is also zero.5 The
second law of motion now says that the net force on the piece must be zero. In Figure 8.6
a small piece of a ﬂuid, say water, is isolated to analyze its motion. This piece is part of a
larger body of water which could have any size or shape. We know that gravity is acting
downward in the form of the weight of the piece and that the total force is zero. So, there
must be a second force exactly equal to the weight, but acting upward. The source of this
force can be nothing but the area of the remaining liquid in contact with the given piece.

the same shape, so that it ﬁts snugly in place of the piece. Clearly the gravitational force

on the metal will be diﬀerent from that on the replaced liquid, but since the shape of the
contact area between the metal and the rest of the water is exactly the same as before, the
upward force will remain the same. This upward force is called the buoyant force, and
was ﬁrst discovered by Archimedes, who upon such discovery is said to have run out of his
bath naked and shouted: Eυρϵκα! This discovery is called Archimedes’ principle:
Box 8.3.1. (Archimedes’ Principle) An object in a ﬂuid is pushed up by a force
equal to the weight of the ﬂuid it displaces.
5In general, a zero velocity does not imply a zero acceleration. For example, a ball thrown vertically up
comes to a momentary stop at its highest point, but the acceleration is not zero there. For the acceleration
to be zero, the velocity should remain zero.

Submersed objects displace as much liquid as their own volume. However, a ﬂoating
object is immersed only partially. Thus the volume of the liquid it displaces is not equal to
its total volume. Nevertheless, the weight of the displaced liquid is equal to the weight of

the object, making the total force zero, and the object in equilibrium. As one adds weight
to the ﬂoating object, more and more liquid is displaced, with the weight of the newly
displaced liquid always being equal to the newly added weight.
What do you know? 8.9. How does the weight of a ﬂoating submersed submarine
compare with the sea water it displaces? How do you explain this, knowing that a
submarine is made of heavy metals?
Liquid Pressure
To study ﬂuids in more detail, we need to learn a new concept, pressure, denoted by P,
which simply stated, is the amount of force exerted perpendicularly to a unit area. If F is
the force exerted (in perpendicular direction) to a surface of area A, then the pressure is

unit of pressure.

The unit used in measuring pressure comes directly from its deﬁnition: N/m2, which is also
called Pascal.
We most often speak of the pressure of a gas or a liquid. For such substances, pressure is
connected to another property of the substance, density. In general, density is the amount

of mass contained in a unit volume. So, if the mass of a quantity of matter is m and its
volume is V , then its density ρ is given by ρ = m/V , and measured in kg/m3. The densities
of some common substances are given in Table 8.1.

Consider the column of water (or any other liquid) shown in Figure 8.7(a). This column
is stationary. Thus, its acceleration is zero, implying that the total force on it is also zero.
There is one obvious force acting on the column, the omnipresent gravitational force, mg,
pointing downward. Since the total force on the column is zero, there must be a second
upward force. This is provided by the remaining body of water in the form of pressure
applied at the bottom surface of the column.6
Now suppose we make the column longer. Then its mass and, therefore, mg, will in-
crease. To keep the column in equilibrium, the pressure at the bottom must increase as
well. This increase is independent of the width of the column. The quantitative analysis
of Math Note E.8.4 on page 82 of Appendix.pdf shows this independence clearly. The
only thing that determines the pressure in a liquid is depth and the liquid density. Thus,
we speak of pressure at a point inside liquid. Since the pressure at this point is determined
only by the depth, we conclude that
6Although there is pressure on the lateral surface, the force producing it is perpendicular to that surface;
hence, it does not act to balance gravity.

Box 8.3.2. The pressure of a ﬂuid increases with depth. All points at the same depth
in a given liquid have the same pressure.
We are situated at the bottom of a deep sea of air, and by the very argument given
above, there is a pressure at such a depth. This is precisely what is called atmospheric
pressure. Thus, in the analysis above, a third force is also present, the force of atmosphere

column is PA. (b) Direction of ﬂuid pressure.
Let us call the pressure at the surface of the liquid P0. Usually this is just the atmospheric
pressure as discussed in the previous paragraph. However, it is possible to apply extra
pressure on the surface of a liquid, for instance, using a piston. Then the downward force
on the column in Figure 8.7 increases and—since the liquid is assumed motionless—the
pressure at the bottom must increase by exactly the same amount. This is true for columns
of all sizes and shapes. Therefore,
Box 8.3.3. Increasing P0, the pressure at the surface, increases liquid pressure by the
same amount everywhere.
In which direction does the pressure in a liquid apply? In all directions! To see this refer
to Figure 8.7(b) and note how the water gushes out in all directions due to this pressure.
Besides, we just mentioned that liquid pressure is deﬁned at a point, and a single point
cannot determine any preferred direction for the pressure to point to.
Figure 8.8 shows a container with diﬀerent vases all connected at the bottom. At the
same depth in any part of the liquid, the pressure is the same. In particular, the surface
of the liquid must be at the same level in diﬀerent vases, because otherwise, at a given
common depth, the pressure of the vase with higher liquid surface would be more than that
of other vases. Therefore, all our conclusions and results are independent of the shape of
the liquid, and consequently, of its container.
Consider the following experiment. Take two identical thick glass tubes each one meter
long closed at the bottom, and open at the top. Fill them both with water and plug the
tops with stoppers. Now ﬂip the tubes and immerse the open ends in a vessel full of water

and then unplug the stoppers. As you move the tubes up and down in the vessel, they will
remain full. In particular, it is possible to obtain a conﬁguration shown in Figure 8.9(a).
What do you know? 8.10. How do you resolve the paradox that the water levels of
the tubes in Figure 8.9 are at diﬀerent heights while we just showed, using Figure 8.8,
that they should be at the same height?
Example 8.3.4. Instead of two identical tubes, take glass tubes of varying length as shown in
Figure 8.9(b). Start with the length of 1 m, ﬁll it with water and immerse the open end of it in
the water vessel. Next take a 2-m tube and do the same thing. Then 3 m, 4 m, etc. Doing the
experiment may become more and more awkward, but it stimulates the question: How long should
the tube be before it stops remaining full once immersed in the water from the open end? This is
a legitimate question, because points A, B, C, D, and E are all at the same level, and therefore,
must have the same pressure, the atmospheric pressure. If I keep increasing the length of the tube,
the pressure due to the weight of the water column will eventually reach the atmospheric pressure.
So, for a suﬃciently long tube, water will only partially ﬁll the tube [Figure 8.9(c)], and for all
tubes longer than that, the height of the water will remain the same, with the top of the tube
containing nothing, a vacuum. This means that at the surface of the water in the long tube at this
height, the pressure is (almost) zero. One can say that the atmospheric pressure is equal to the
pressure of such a height of water. What is this height?
Surprisingly, this height was discovered by Florentine well diggers who reported to Galileo that
their suction pumps could not raise water to more than about 10 m.
Suction pumps work by

and a student of Galileo.
creating vacuum which reduces the pressure at the pump, causing the air pressure to push the
water up the pipe. But if one places the pump at an elevation of 10 m or more, the atmospheric
pressure cannot push the water up any further. To make things more manageable, Evangelista
Torricelli (1608-1647), a student of Galileo, used mercury instead of water. Since mercury is about
13.6 times heavier than water, the column should be proportionately smaller. So, he expected the
height in his tube to be about 73.5 cm. He took a tube 1 m long; ﬁlled it to the rim with mercury;

held the open end of it while immersing it in a vessel full of mercury, and noticed that mercury
dropped to a height of 76 cm (or about 30 inches), the remaining 24 cm (or about 9 inches) was
empty. This was the beginning of barometry.
■
Figure 8.10 shows a crude picture of a hydraulic jack. Since pressure is the same at the
same height, a little bit of force at A can support a huge weight at B. For instance, suppose
Hydraulic jack.
the area at A is 400 cm2 (a 20 cm by 20 cm square) and that at B is 4 m2 = 40, 000 cm2.
Then a girl weighing 50 pounds at A can support 5,000 lb, or about 2.5 metric tons at B!
However, displacement of objects becomes inconvenient at B, as the ratio of displacements
is the reciprocal of that of forces.7 Thus, to raise the weight at B by a mere 1 cm, the girl
at A should be pushed down a distance of 100 cm, or 1 m!
7This is due to the energy conservation: The work done by the force at A must equal the (negative of
the) work done by the force at B.

Hydrodynamics
The application of the laws of motion to moving ﬂuids can predict their behavior and
properties. Instead of applying them directly, however, it is more economical to use the
work-energy version of those laws. For simplicity, let’s ignore hydrodynamic friction—also
called viscosity—and study the ﬂow of an incompressible liquid moving horizontally. The
motion of such ﬂuids is governed by what is known as the Bernoulli principle, whose
details can be found in Math Note E.8.5 on page 82 of Appendix.pdf .
Bernoulli principle states that when the velocity of a ﬂuid increases, its pressure decreases
and vice versa. Thus by creating a velocity gradient, you can create forces that can do work
for you. This is the principle behind airplane ﬂight, where the wings are designed to have
an air ﬂow of higher speed on top and lower speed at the bottom [see Figure 8.11(a)]. The
pressure at the bottom of the wing will be greater than at the top and the force larger,
causing a lift.

air on top of the umbrella moves faster than the air under it, which, because of the curvature of
the umbrella, is almost stationary. Because of the lower air speed underneath, the pressure there
is higher than the pressure above. The high pressure is sometimes enough to turn the umbrella
inside out.

the motion is analyzed in the ball’s reference frame. In this reference frame, air ﬂows past the ball
opposite to the direction of motion of the ball (remember the relativity of motion from Chapter
6). Let us assume that the ball rotates counterclockwise when looking at it from the top. Because
of the friction between the ball and the air in contact with it, a layer of air is dragged along the
ball. The motion of this layer is opposite to the air ﬂow at the bottom, and in the direction of the
air ﬂow at the top. This causes the net velocity of the air ﬂow to decrease at the bottom and to
increase at the top. Bernoulli principle now says that the pressure should be larger at the bottom
than at the top, causing the ball to curve upward.

Answers to “What do you know?”
8.1. The weight and the tension in the string are perpendicular to the circular path of the
stone; therefore, the work of each of these two forces is zero. Air drag is opposite to the
direction of motion; hence, it does negative work on the stone.
8.2.
At the beginning the air drag is small; so the work done by it is also small and
negative, because air drag points opposite to the direction of motion. The work done by
the weight is larger than the drag work and it is positive. The net force (weight minus
drag) points downward; so the net work is positive. Therefore, the change in KE is positive
(parachutist speeds up).
8.3.
At the beginning the air drag is large now; so the work done by it is also large and
negative. The work done by the weight is smaller than the drag work and it is positive.
The net force (drag minus weight) points upward; so the net work is negative. Therefore,
the change in KE is negative (parachutist slows down).
8.4.
The work done in each lift is weight of the load times displacement.
Weight is
50 × 9.8 = 490 N. So, the work done in each lift is 490 × 0.5 = 245 J. Total work done is
245×30 = 7350 J. This is done in 120 seconds. Therefore, your power output is 7350/120 =
61.25 Watts. Later, we will learn that each dietary calorie is 4180 Joules. So, each second
you are losing 61.25/4180 = 0.0147 calories! To lose 147 calories, you’ll have to exercise for
10,000 seconds or about 3 hours!8 It is not easy to lose weight!
8.5.
As long as the water is stationary in a bucket, the distance between its various
parts does not change. But that does not imply that water is rigid. Rigidity requires the
constancy of the distance between various parts when the system is subjected to any kind of
motion. To see that water is not rigid, turn the bucket upside down and follow the motion

of various parts of the water.
8.6. The wrench would be simply rotating about its center of mass.
8.7.
With a long pole (especially if a weight is added at each end), the tightrope walker
acquires a large moment of inertia, and it will be harder to rotate him (or tip him over).
8.8.
The chair, the person, and the bicycle wheel constitute a system with an initial
angular momentum concentrated in the wheel. Reorienting the shaft changes the direction
of the angular momentum of the wheel. Since the total angular momentum is conserved,
the system starts to rotate in such a way as to compensate for the change in the angular
momentum caused by the reorientation of the shaft.
8.9.
The weight of the submarine equals the weight of the water it displaces. Although
the body of a submarine is made of heavy metals, inside it is ﬁlled with air, which is much
lighter than sea water. The overall weight can be adjusted to be equal to the sea water
displaced. This is done by injecting or ejecting water from its reservoir.
8.10. The water, which tries to reach the height of about 10 m, encounters the resistance of
the closed end of the tube; it exerts an upward force on the tube, and the tube, obeying the
third law of motion, reacts by exerting a downward force on the water. This force translates
into a pressure, which, when added to the pressure of the column of water, produces the
atmospheric pressure at the water level [points A, B, etc. in Figure 8.9(b)]. The shorter
the tube is the larger the pressure at the closed end, so that the total pressure at the water
level is always the atmospheric pressure.

Chapter Glossary
Angular Momentum The analog of ordinary momentum in rotational motion. One can
call it the “quantity of rotational motion.” If the rotation takes place about a ﬁxed
axis, then angular momentum of a system is the sum of the product of the momentum
of each constituent of the system and its distance from the axis.
Archimedes’ Principle A principle—derivable from Newton’s laws of motion—stating
how a liquid exerts an upward force on an object immersed in it.
Atmospheric Pressure The pressure at some point on the surface of the Earth due to the
weight of the column of air (extending over the thickness of the atmosphere) located
at that point.
Bernoulli Principle A principle in ﬂuid dynamics relating the pressure of a ﬂuid to its
speed.
Center of Gravity Same as center of mass.
Center of Mass A point of a rigid body whose motion under the inﬂuence of the external
forces describes the motion of the rigid body if the entire body were concentrated at
that point. Sometimes called center of gravity because it is the point at which you
can balance the rigid body on a pivot.
Conservation of Angular Momentum A principle similar to the ﬁrst law of motion. It
states that if a system is isolated, then its total angular momentum does not change.
Conservation of Energy A deep fundamental principle of physics, which states that en-
ergy cannot be created or destroyed. When restricted to kinetic and potential energy,
it becomes conservation of mechanical energy, which states that, in the absence
of other forms of energy, the sum of the potential and kinetic energies is constant.

Chapter9
Gravitation
There are four fundamental forces in nature: gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear,
and weak nuclear. Of these four forces, gravity is the ﬁrst to be discovered and the least
understood. Although we have a good understanding of the behavior of the gravitational
force on a large scale, i.e., as applied to celestial bodies, when we try to unravel the mysteries
of this force in the domain of the atoms and subatomic particles, we fail.
This failure
manifests itself most clearly in the attempts to reconcile gravity with the theory that most
successfully describes the behavior of the subatomic world, the quantum theory. The process
of reconciling a classically observed force with the quantum theory is called quantization. It
has been possible to reconcile electromagnetism with the quantum theory with great success
(as Chapter 32 testiﬁes), so we say that electromagnetism has been quantized.
The nuclear forces have no classical analog. They live only in the quantum domain, inside
the nucleus of atoms. Therefore, if there is any successful theory for the nuclear forces, it
has to be a quantum theory. In fact, beginning in 1973, a very successful theory started to
emerge which could explain the behavior of nuclear forces. This so-called standard model
of electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces (which is the topic of Chapter 34) has passed
all the rigorous tests of experimental scrutiny with ﬂying colors. The standard model also
has the extra aesthetic appeal of unifying the electromagnetic force with the weak nuclear
force.
Despite the invention of many ingenious techniques, and the attempts by some of the
greatest minds of contemporary physics, a satisfactory quantized theory of gravity is still
lacking. Such a theory is actively pursued for many reasons. It is believed, for instance, that
a knowledge of gravity on a subatomic scale will lead not only to a better understanding
of gravity itself, but also to a more complete description of the other three forces. In fact,
there are many experimental and theoretical indications that the four forces are but diﬀerent
manifestations of a single “super force.” To discover this super force, we must ﬁrst unravel
gravity at the subatomic level. Moreover, the theory of the origin of the universe, the Big
Bang theory (the topic of Part VIII of this book), will not be complete unless we know
how the fundamental particles, the ingredients for the formation of the universe, interacted
with one another right after the bang when the universe was inﬁnitely hot and inﬁnitely
small. Such a knowledge requires the quantization of gravity.
This chapter deals with gravity on a large scale. There are two theories in use: Newton’s
theory of gravity which is adequate for all “ordinary” applications such as the motion of
planets, satellites, meteors, etc., and Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR) which
is appropriate for all ordinary as well as extraordinary applications such as black holes, big
bang theory, and GPS (global positioning system), in which colossal masses, very large
speeds, and extremely high clock precision are to be dealt with. Only Newtonian theory is
discussed in this chapter. The general theory of relativity is the topic of Chapter 29.

The Universal Law of Gravitation
Gravity and electricity are the only two of the four forces that had displayed themselves on
this planet continuously long before the oldest human civilization, long before the oldest
known human species, even long before the ﬁrst living cell started to scull in the rough waters
of the primitive Earth. The fall of free objects above the ground, and the phenomenon of
lightning are the two manifestations of gravity and electricity which are as old as the Earth
itself. The irregularity of lightning hampered our understanding of electricity for over a
century longer than the unraveling of gravity by Sir Isaac Newton in 1665.
It is said that Newton discovered gravity when he saw an apple fall from a tree. This
Newton did not discover
gravity!
is a wrong statement. Newton did not discover gravity! Gravity was discovered long before
Newton. Aristotle, for instance, talks of two forces, gravity and levity, with the former
being the tendency to fall and the latter, the tendency to rise. What Newton did, was to
discover the mathematical law governing the gravitational force. Whether he used an apple
to discover this law is not important. What is important—and this requires a genius and
an incredible insight—is that Newton saw a Moon in an apple and an apple in the Moon.
The following example explains.
Example 9.1.1. To an ordinary person, the motions of an apple falling to the ground and the
Moon circling Earth 60 times farther than the apple, have nothing in common (Figure 9.1). But
Newton saw the connection between the two in that they are both moving under the inﬂuence of
gravity alone. Having brilliantly discovered this connection, Newton calculated the acceleration of
the Moon using the formula a = v2/r for the centripetal acceleration. The speed v is simply the
circumference of the Moon’s orbit divided by its period, both of which had been known ever since
the Greeks’ golden age. Newton discovered that the Moon, at a distance 60 times larger than the
apple’s distance from the Earth’s center, had an acceleration that was about 3600 = 602 times
smaller than the apple’s. He concluded that the acceleration due to gravity must decrease as the
square of the distance from the center of the gravitating object. Example D.9.1 on page 26 of
Appendix.pdf supplies the numerical details.

Newton might have come up with his universal law of gravitation through an argument
similar to the one given in the foregoing example, and in the process, he must have had the

keen insight to detect the sameness of the acceleration of the Moon and that of an apple.1
Any similarity between the fall of an apple directly downward, and the motion of the Moon
thousands of miles away circling the Earth, goes undetected by ordinary people. Yet this
very similarity is the ﬁrst giant step toward unraveling the mysteries of gravity, a step that
only a devoted genius such as Newton could take.
If the gravitational acceleration caused by Earth is proportional to the inverse of the
square of the distance, then the gravitational force on an object of mass m, which by the
second law is F = ma, must be proportional to m/(distance)2. Now let M denote the

Earth’s mass.
Then the third law of motion implies that m applies the same force on
M. Thus, switching the role of M and m, we conclude that the gravitational force must
also be proportional to M, i.e., proportional to mM/(distance)2. Supplying a constant of
proportionality, denoted by G, Newton arrived at the law of gravitation between the Earth
and a terrestrial object, F = GMm/r2, where M is the mass of the Earth, m that of the
object pulled by the Earth, and r the “distance” between them. Newton realized that this
law could be generalized to act between any two objects. Calling the masses of the two
objects m1 and m2, the universal law of gravitation becomes:

F = Gm1m2
r2
and
F = GMm

,
(9.1)
where the second equation is usually used when a celestial body of mass M inﬂuences the
motion of an ordinary object of mass m.
The constant G, called the universal gravitational constant, was not determined
until 1798 when the British physicist Henry Cavendish measured it. The reason for such
a lapse of time is that to measure G, one had to measure the two masses m1 and m2, the
force F, and the distance r between them. The celestial determination of these quantities
How big (or small) is G?
was impossible (one had to measure the masses of, say the Sun and the Earth) while the
terrestrial determination of the quantities proved to be very elusive due to the extremely
small force of gravity between ordinary objects (see Example 9.1.3), which in turn was due
to the fact that G itself is too small.
Example D.9.2 on page 26 of Appendix.pdf shows that, in the scientiﬁc system of
units in which length is measured in meters, time in seconds, and mass in kilograms, the
value of G must lie somewhere between 1.82 × 10−11 and 3.65 × 10−10 based on some very
general observation. But, with extreme care and extraordinary patience, Cavendish was
able to measure the actual value of G. His value, in the scientiﬁc units we use in this book,
was slightly diﬀerent from today’s accepted value of 6.6742 × 10−11.
Food for Thought
FFT 9.1.2. Some philosophers believe that there is something fundamentally wrong with science
because its theories and its observations are not independent. They dismiss any kind of observation
as theory-laden. They think that if an observation is not completely independent of the theory it
is testing, then both the theory and the observation are invalid.
And if they are right, then
the determination of the universal gravitational constant G is one of the biggest blunders in the
history of science, because Cavendish assumed that Equation (9.1) was correct, and based on this
assumption, he measured m1 and m2 (using a scale), r (using a tape measure), and F (using a
newly invented instrument called a torsion balance). Then he used Equation (9.1) to calculate G.
And Cavendish was not alone in intertwining observation with theory. In fact, no observation
or experimentation is done that does not incorporate one or more theories.
Take the simplest

experimentation, the measurement of the distance between two points. When you use a straightedge
to do so, you are assuming that only one straight line segment can be drawn between the two points,
1And to speculate that the Earth’s mass could be thought of as concentrated at its center so that the
“distance” from the Earth to the apple could be compared to that of the Moon.
This speculation led
Newton to the invention of integral calculus.

134
Chapter 9
Gravitation
and that you are measuring the length of that unique line segment. This assumption is at the heart
of one of the oldest theories in existence, the Euclidean geometry.
Modern experimental physics is even more intertwined with theory. When an X-ray machine
is used to examine an atom, the boundary between observation and theory becomes completely
blurred. On the one hand, the behavior of an atom obeys the laws of quantum theory, and the
examination of an atom is ultimately a test of this theory. On the other hand, the construction of
an X-ray machine is entirely based on the quantum theory.
The inseparability of observation and theory is the key to the advancement of science. It is
always breakthroughs in theoretical understanding of nature that suggests new observations for
whose rendering the accumulated theoretical knowledge of humanity becomes indispensable. And
the breakthroughs in observation bring about conditions under which new theories could be born.
All observations are
theory-laden. This is
how science works!
So, if Cavendish used Newton’s universal law of gravitation to measure the value of G, he
was following the most fundamental principle of scientiﬁc investigation. The important point is
that all such observations and theories ﬁt nicely into a framework in which a myriad opportunities
exist to check and recheck the experimental and theoretical results. Example D.9.2 shows how
methods completely independent of those used by Cavendish—i.e., the size and the density of the
Earth—put stringent upper and lower limits on the value of G.
Example 9.1.3. The gravitational force between two ordinary objects is extremely small. For
People don’t attract
people ...
gravitationally!
example two cars each having a mass of 1 ton (1000 kg), whose centers are separated by a distance
of 1.5 m exert a gravitational force of only 2.96×10−5 N, as can be easily calculated using Equation
(9.1). Compare this with the Earth’s gravitational pull on a penny which is about 0.03 Newton!
That is why people are not attracted to each other . . . not gravitationally, any way!
■
The gravitational force due to the Earth on an object of mass m is F = GmM/r2. This
force, like any other force, is related to the acceleration by F = ma. These two equations
imply that ma = GmM/r2 or a = GM/r2. It is more customary to denote the gravitational
acceleration by g. Therefore, we write
g = GM
r2 .
(9.2)
Although this equation was derived for the Earth, it is easily seen that the derivation is
completely general and applies to the acceleration caused by an arbitrary (spherical) mass
M. This result is a profound property of nature which, as we shall see, is at the heart
of one of the most beautiful theories ever discovered, the general theory of relativity. The
profound property is
Box 9.1.4. The acceleration due to gravity is independent of the mass of the object
being accelerated.
A grain of sand, a penny, a cannon ball, and a satellite all accelerate at the same
rate—if they are at the same distance, of course—towards the gravitating body. Such an
implication has been tested again and again. The ﬁrst test was performed by Galileo in
his famous experiment at the leaning tower of Pisa. The most famous—and still one of
the most accurate—experiment was performed in 1889 by E¨otv¨os, a Hungarian physicist,
in which he showed that the variation in the gravitational acceleration of various objects is
less than a few parts in a billion! More recent measurements set an upper bound for this
variation in the acceleration at values between 10−11 and 10−13.
No other fundamental force of nature has the property stated in Box 9.1.4. For instance,
accelerations due to the electrical forces are sensitive to the mass of the accelerated object.
In fact, one can say that gravity is that fundamental force whose acceleration is insensitive
to variations in mass.

Section 9.1

Figure 9.2: By constantly increasing the horizontal speed of the projectile, one can eventually reach an
orbiting speed.
Another important property of gravitation is the fact that it is always attractive, unlike
the electric force, which can be attractive or repulsive depending on the sign of the electric
charges. This is because the source of gravity, mass, is always positive, while the source of
electricity, electric charge, can be both positive and negative.

Thus, using Equation (9.2), we obtain
9.81 = 6.67 × 10−11 × M/6, 400, 0002, from which we can calculate M. The value we obtain is
M = 6 × 1024 kg. Notice how kilometer had to be converted to meter in Equation (9.2). This is
something you should keep in mind whenever you do a numerical exercise: Any formula used in
this book requires that length be measured in meter, time in second, and mass in kilogram.

Satellite Speed
Newton saw the connection between a circulating Moon and a falling apple, and discovered
the law of gravity. He then proposed the possibility of “apples” circulating the Earth at
low altitudes. He imagined a very tall mountain peak, on which was mounted a cannon,
ﬁring cannon balls horizontally with varying speeds (Figure 9.2). As you increase the speed
of the projectile, its range increases. If the speed is large enough, the range will be so huge
that the ball will miss the Earth completely. We then have an orbiting cannon ball.
We can ﬁnd a general expression relating the speed and the orbital radius of a circulating
object going around a celestial body of mass M. On the one hand, we have Equation (9.2)
which gives the acceleration of the object in terms of the mass of the celestial body. On
the other hand, we know that this acceleration, being a centripetal acceleration, is given
by g = v2/r. Equating these two forms of the same acceleration yields GM/r2 = v2/r
implying GM/r = v2, or ﬁnally

Equation (9.3) shows that the farther the object is from the gravitating mass, the slower
it has to move to stay in orbit. Low-altitude satellites (low compared to the Earth radius)
have a speed of about 8 km/s or approximately 18,000 mph. Example D.9.3 on page 27

9.1.2
Kepler’s Third Law
The Newtonian laws of motion and the theory of gravity, when applied to the solar system,
yields Kepler’s three laws of the planetary motion. To derive the ﬁrst and second Kepler
laws from Newton’s law of gravity requires higher mathematics (diﬀerential equations).
However, the third law—for the special case of a circular orbit—can be derived with little
(mathematical) eﬀort, as done in Math Note E.9.1 on page 84 of Appendix.pdf . The
result is:
T 2 = 4π2
GM r3.

So the k in Box 3.3.1 is k = 4π2/GM.
Food for Thought
FFT 9.1.6. Look at Equation (9.4)! Look at it carefully! It is a collection of letters, numbers,
and symbols. It contains the strange symbol “=” and a horizontal line with some “stuﬀ” on top
and bottom of it. It is a product of the human mind, which also invented the letters and the
numbers that go into the equation. It is the collective invention of generations of thinkers working
in their solitary rooms day after day and night after night, guided by the information collected by
generations of observers, looking painstakingly at heaven and Earth, and gathering glimmers of
knowledge from them. In short, Equation (9.4) is one of the collective masterpieces of our race.
It also contains “G.” A letter. But what’s in the letter? A message. A universal message
encrypted in the cosmic dance of the Moon, planets, solar system, and beyond. To decipher this
message you need training, devotion, and perseverance . . . lots of all three! You also need a torsion
balance. But that comes in the package if you are trained and devoted beyond imagination and
persevere equally. All this converged in the person of Henry Cavendish, who, in his laboratory, on
a tiny speck of the planet Earth called London, deciphered the secret universal message hidden in
G. Once this secret was revealed, humans acquired a cosmic arm with which they could reach into
the farthest corners of the cosmos and touch the planets, stars, and galaxies out there.
Contact with the cosmos is not a new phenomenon. Ancient astronomers looked at the heavens,
collected information from it, and when the information fell into the hands of the Greek scientists,
they perfected the pidgin in which Egyptians and Babylonians communicated with nature, into
an abstract language. Mathematics became the means of communication with heavens, and the
cosmos taught the Greek scientists the basics of this new language.
How remarkable that Aristarchus put this new language to use in his measurements of the sizes
and distances of the most conspicuous objects in heaven! Theoretical astronomy extends our sense
of vision: the local earthly sizes and distances, which we can estimate using our eyes, are extended
to heaven by merging the use of our vision with mathematics. But theoretical astronomy, by itself,
cannot go beyond that. To extend our other senses, the tactile sense, for example, a more earthly
science and a more sophisticated language is needed. This earthly science started with Galileo and

Newton, and its more sophisticated language was developed by Newton and his contemporaries.
This earthly science is physics.
Equation (9.4) is more than just Kepler’s third law. It contains the mass M of the Sun.
Therefore, knowledge of the period of a planet and its distance from the Sun can lead to
a measurement of the Sun’s mass! Example D.9.4 on page 28 of Appendix.pdf uses the
Earth’s period and its distance from the Sun to weigh the Sun. The mass of the Sun turns

out to be 2 × 1030 kg or about 330,000 times the mass of the Earth.
Another useful application of Equation (9.4) is in telecommunication. Communication
satellites are most useful if they remain stationary relative to the Earth, in which case they
are called synchronous satellites. The orbit of the satellite is a circle centered at the

used in communications.
center of the Earth. The satellite must move with the surface of the Earth to stay stationary
relative to it. But all points on the Earth move on circles whose planes are perpendicular
to the axis of rotation of the Earth (the axis connecting the north to the south pole). Thus,
the plane of the orbit of the satellite must also be perpendicular to this axis. The only
plane that is perpendicular to the axis of the Earth and goes through its center is the plane
of the equatorial circle. Therefore, the satellite must go around a circle concentric with the
equator. If we want to receive signals from such satellites, we must point our satellite dishes
to the sky above the equator. In the northern hemisphere, this means that our dishes must
point to the southern sky. In the southern hemisphere, the dishes point to the northern
sky. Example D.9.5 on page 28 of Appendix.pdf shows how to ﬁnd the altitude of a
synchronous satellite.
9.1.3
Dark Matter
Equation (9.4) or (9.3) ties three quantities together: mass M of the gravitating body,
speed v (or period T) of the circulating object, and the distance r of the circulating object
from the gravitating body. Knowing any two of these quantities determines the third one.
For example, a knowledge of the distance and the mass determines the speed; this is how
we calculated the speed of a satellite circling the Earth (see Example D.9.3). Similarly, the
period and the distance of Earth from the Sun determined the mass of the Sun (Example
D.9.4). The application of the (equivalent) formulas (9.4) or (9.3) to the cosmos has led to
one of the most exotic and enigmatic conclusions in the history of cosmology.
Example 9.1.7. Suppose you look at a star, and based on certain of its visible properties, you
determine its mass. Now, you look at one of its planets, determine its distance from the star and the
period of its revolution around the star. You plug this information in Kepler’s third law and note
that it doesn’t work; that the period is much smaller than it should be. Since Kepler’s third law is
on a ﬁrm theoretical and observational footing, we have no choice but to accept it. The value of G
has been determined to a very high accuracy; so we have no room to fudge it. We are therefore left
with r, M, and T. The ﬁrst and the last quantities can be measured directly and accurately. The
period can be measured by charting the planet’s position in the ﬁeld of a super-powerful telescope
(such as the Hubble Space Telescope). The distance can be measured accurately by ﬁnding the
angular separation of the star and the planet once the distance of the star from Earth is known.
The only alternative left for explaining the discrepancy is to assume that the mass of the star
is not necessarily its visible mass. If we assume the validity of Kepler’s third law, and the accuracy
of the distance and period, we must conclude that the actual mass of the star is more than the
visible mass and that much of the mass of the star is invisible! Example D.9.6 on page 28 of
Appendix.pdf adds some numerical ﬂavor to this discussion.
■
The invisible mass of the foregoing example has come to be known as dark matter.
Dark matter explained.
There is no dark matter surrounding a star; but the essence of the argument for the existence
of dark matter is as outlined in that example; the details are slightly diﬀerent. Instead of a
planet moving around a star, one has to focus on stars in the galactic arms moving around
the core of a galaxy.

According to Equation (9.3), the farther a star is from the mass M of the visible part
of a galaxy, the slower it should move. Observation, however, indicates that
Box 9.1.8. Beyond a certain distance from the core of the Milky Way, all stars move
at the same speed regardless of their distance from the center of the galaxy.
Squaring (9.3), rewriting the result as M = (v2/G)r, and noting that v is a constant, we
have to conclude that M increases as r increases! The visible stars contained in the sphere
of radius r cannot account for this increase.
To augment your understanding of dark matter refer to Figure 9.3. Two stars A and
B revolve around the massive core of a galaxy. Neglecting the thin arms of the galaxy,
star B, being four times farther away than A from the core, must move at half the speed
of A according to Equation (9.3). To move as fast as A, B must experience the force of
gravity of four times more mass than A is experiencing.2 Therefore, the distance between
the center of the galaxy and B must be ﬁlled with an invisible mass, i.e., dark
matter.
You may ask “Why does A not experience the gravity of this mass?” Math Note E.9.2

Gravitational Field and Potential Energy
Newton’s universal law of gravitation states that a mass exerts a force on another mass
located at a distance from the ﬁrst. This is called action-at-a-distance and embodies
a frame of mind in which it is possible, without an intermediary agent, for an object to
inﬂuence another distant object.
Since there is no agent to “transmit” the force, it is

understood that a change in the state of the source of gravitation is instantaneously reﬂected
in the force on the second mass.
9.2.1
Gravitational Field
The “telepathic” transmission of information alluded to above was indigestible to the nine-
teenth century physicists, especially when they tried to apply it to the electrical phenomena.
Thus, in the hands of the English physicist Michael Faraday, and the Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell, the untouchable action-at-a-distance was replaced by the more tan-
gible notion of ﬁeld.
Very generally speaking, any force has a ﬁeld associated with it. We speak of gravita-
tional ﬁeld, electric ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, and nuclear ﬁelds. If, through experimentation,
we ﬁnd that there is a gravitational force Fg acting on a (small) mass at a point P, we say
that there is a gravitational ﬁeld at P. In fact, the gravitational ﬁeld g is deﬁned to be the
Gravitational ﬁeld.
ratio of the gravitational force on a (small) object divided by the mass m of the object:
g = Fg
m
or
Fg = mg.
(9.5)
It follows that the gravitational force and ﬁeld have the same direction because m is always
positive. Since the gravitational force is always attractive (the force pulls m towards the
center of the gravitating body),
Box 9.2.1. The gravitational ﬁeld of a gravitating body always points toward that body.
If the body is spherical, the ﬁeld points toward the center of the sphere.
As Equation (9.5) shows, the gravitational ﬁeld is nothing but the gravitational acceler-
ation. The second equation in (9.5) is the same as the weight of the object; it conﬁrms the

fact that weight is the force of gravity. This equation also shows the equivalence between
the force concept and the ﬁeld concept: Knowing the ﬁeld at a point, we can ﬁnd the force
at that point and vice versa. Other ﬁelds are deﬁned similarly.
The concept of the ﬁeld localizes the concept of a force. Whereas in action-at-a-distance
theory a force here is caused by an object (source) there, in ﬁeld theory a force here is caused
by a ﬁeld here. In ﬁeld theories, the primary objects are ﬁelds rather than sources. Of course,
any ﬁeld has a source, and to determine the value of a ﬁeld at a point, theoretically, one has
to know the exact location and status of the source. This connection between the source
and the ﬁeld is what ties together the action-at-a-distance theory and the ﬁeld theory.
The ﬁeld concept was invented merely as a “tangible” device to render action-at-a-
distance more “concrete.” Whether a ﬁeld had any physical and measurable property that
would give it an independent identity was irrelevant. However, further developments, espe-
cially in the hands of Maxwell and Einstein, showed that not only do ﬁelds have independent
existence of their own, but they are the fundamental quantities on which (modern) physics
is to be based.
One may very well ask: Given that there is a force at a point, say P, how do we know
what kind of a ﬁeld is present there? Is it gravitational, electrical, or nuclear? The answer
is: by experimentation. By varying certain properties of the “test” object, we can determine
the kind of ﬁeld present at a point. For instance, if by varying the amount of charge on the
test object, the force does not change, we can eliminate the electric ﬁeld which is sensitive
to the charge. Similarly, by varying the mass—while keeping other properties intact—of the
test object and observing the change in the force, we can determine whether a gravitational
ﬁeld is present at P.
One of the most conspicuous eﬀects of gravitational ﬁeld, next to the fall of objects, is
the phenomenon of tide. Consider the Earth-Moon system as depicted in Figure 9.4. The

as a whole feels a smaller gravitational ﬁeld g2 at its center, and the ocean waters at the
far end of the Earth feel the weakest gravitational ﬁeld g3. Therefore, the waters on the
right want to “escape” from Earth with a relative acceleration of g1 −g2. That is why a
hump is formed on the side closer to the Moon. Why is there a second hump at the far end?
Since the Earth as a whole feels an acceleration g2 which is larger than g3, the whole Earth
is running away from the waters on the left with a relative acceleration of g2 −g3. Thus,
these waters are “left behind” in the form of a second hump. Of course, all the waters are
prevented from escaping by the strong gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth. The formation of
the two humps explains why tides occur twice a day.
9.2.2
Gravitational Potential Energy
The gravitational PE deﬁned earlier as mgh is valid as long as the height h is much much
smaller than the radius of the gravitating body, such as the Earth. This is because, as long
as we stay close to the surface of the gravitating body, the weight mg is very nearly constant
and the work done is simply this weight times the displacement (change in h). When the
displacement from the center of the gravitating body is large, the force (weight) does not
remain constant during the displacement. In such a case, one must use the techniques of
integral calculus to ﬁnd the exact formula for the gravitational potential energy. It turns
out that, if one chooses the reference height not at the surface of the body but at inﬁnity,
then at a distance r from the center of the gravitating body, the potential energy would be

Note that as r goes to inﬁnity (becomes larger and larger), the potential energy also gets
larger and larger, going to zero at inﬁnity, as it should.
What do you know? 9.5. How would you change Equation (9.6) to make the surface
of the gravitating body of radius R the reference height, i.e., where PE is zero? Recall
that PE is deﬁned to within a constant.
We now have two ways of ﬁnding the potential energy of an object at a height which is
small compared to the radius of the Earth: The exact way given by Equation (9.6), and the

approximate way given by mgh. Do these formulas agree? Example D.9.7 on page 29 of
Appendix.pdf shows that if you use accurate values for the mass and radius of the Earth,
they indeed do!
It should be clear from our discussion so far that (a) the gravitational ﬁeld always points
toward the mass (source) producing it (see Box 9.2.1), and (b) that, as we move opposite
to the direction of the ﬁeld (i.e., away from the gravitating body), the potential energy
increases. Let us summarize this as follows:
Box 9.2.2. Points that are farther away from the gravitating body are at a higher
potential than closer points. An object released in a region of gravitational ﬁeld has a
natural tendency to move from regions of high potential to regions of low potential, i.e.,
in the direction of the ﬁeld.

(9.7)
where v and r denote, respectively, the speed and the distance of the object from the center
of gravitating body. In Chapter 8 we used ME for the mechanical energy to distinguish
it from other forms of energy—such as heat—that may be present. Here E stands for the
(total) mechanical energy, because in the discussion of fundamental forces such as gravity,
it is a more common notation than ME. The quantity E can be either positive or negative,
because the particle may have more KE, in which case E will be positive, or more (negative)
PE in which case E will be negative.
Just as in the motion of a roller coaster, the total energy E will not change during the
entire motion of the object [see Box 8.1.3]. In particular, its sign will not change: If it is
negative at one point of the motion of the object, it will be negative all the time; and if it
is positive or zero, it will remain so during the entire motion of the object.
What do you know? 9.6. Explain the qualitative form of Kepler’s second law (i.e.,
that planets speed up when getting close to the Sun) using Equation (9.7).

Now suppose that at some point in its motion (for instance at the beginning, when the
object is set in motion), the object has an energy that is either positive or zero, i.e., E ≥0.
Then the object will never stop. Why? What would happen if it did stop? Its speed would

be zero; thus its KE would be zero; and its entire energy E would be its PE, which is
negative. That is impossible. Thus the old adage “What goes up must come down” is no
longer valid! If you ﬁre a projectile with a large enough speed so that its KE is larger than
its potential energy at the surface of the Earth, then it will never return to Earth.
What do you know? 9.7. A deep space probe has a positive total energy E. What
happens to its PE as it gets farther and farther? What happens to its KE as it gets
farther and farther? What will its KE equal eventually?
Similarly, if E < 0, the object cannot go on moving away from the gravitating cen-
ter forever, because the PE term keeps decreasing in magnitude, and will eventually be
dominated by the KE term, leading to a positive (or zero) E.
Box 9.2.3. If the total energy E of an object moving away from the mass M is positive
or zero, the object will move away from M forever. If E < 0, the object will come to a
stop at some distance from M, and start its descent toward M.

9.2.3
Escape Velocity
We have seen that when E ≥0, the projectile will never stop. The size of E is determined by
the “initial” KE—and therefore, the initial speed—of the projectile. What is the smallest
speed with which the projectile can be launched at a distance r from the center of the
gravitating body of mass M so that it never returns?
This clearly corresponds to the
smallest KE, and therefore, smallest E. But the smallest E is, of course, zero. Setting
E = 0 in Equation (9.7) and multiplying both sides by 2, we obtain 0 = mv2 −2GMm/r or
mv2 = GMm/r or v2 = 2GM/r. Taking the square root, and calling this smallest velocity

Example 9.2.4. By substituting the mass and the radius of the Earth in Equation (9.8) we can
ﬁnd the escape velocity of Earth. It turns out to be about 11 km/s. Similarly, the escape velocity
of the Moon can be calculated. It is about 2 km/s. Example D.9.9 on page 31 of Appendix.pdf
explains how we got these numbers.
One of the reasons that the Moon has no atmosphere is because of its low escape velocity. The
average thermal molecular speed of most gases is comparable to the escape velocity of the Moon.
Therefore, in their constant random motion, they will eventually move away from the Moon, and
never return.

the satellite. Now add them and ﬁnd that the total energy of the satellite is negative.

escape from it (without the injection of some energy from outside). Box 9.2.3 has already told us
that when E < 0, an object, initially moving away from a mass M, will eventually return to it,
i.e., it is bound to M. The circling satellite is trying to move away from M, but instantaneously is
drawn back to M (see Figure 9.6).
The minimum energy that the satellite needs to “unbind” itself from M is that which makes the
total energy zero (in which case the satellite reaches the escape velocity). This is called the binding
energy Eb, and is simply the negative of the total energy (or the total energy without regards to
its sign). See Example D.9.10 on page 31 of Appendix.pdf for the numerical details

9.2.4
Black Holes
A remarkable property of the escape velocity in Equation (9.8) is that it is independent of
the mass of the projectile. This means that a bullet, a cannon ball, a missile, and a gigantic
space probe all require the same speed to escape a celestial body. Taking the opposite limit,
if the mass of the escaping object becomes smaller and smaller, its escape velocity does not
change. In particular, if a particle has no mass at all, its escape velocity will still be the
same. There is a particle with no mass. It is called photon and it is what light is made of.
We now pose the intriguing question: Is it possible for a celestial body to prevent light
from escaping? A glance at Equation (9.8) answers this question in the aﬃrmative. What
is needed is a high enough mass, or a small enough radius to make the fraction under the
square root sign large enough. Speciﬁcally, this ratio should be so large as to make the
left-hand side of the equation greater than the speed of light. Denoting this speed by c (a
universally accepted notation for the speed of light), we get c <
p
2GM/R or c2 < 2GM/R,
which after dividing both sides by 2G yields
M
R > c2
2G.
(9.9)
Thus, if a celestial body has a mass-to-radius ratio larger than c2/2G, then light will not be
able to escape that body. Such bodies exist, and are called black holes.4 Although black
holes were suggested in the 1960s on theoretical grounds, no direct evidence for them was

It is remarkable that the result obtained so straightforwardly in Equation (9.9) agrees completely with the
exact result.

found for a while. The launch—and the correction in the optical system—of the Hubble
Space Telescope saw a black hole approximately 3 billion times more massive than the Sun
in 1994.
Example D.9.11 on page 31 of Appendix.pdf shows that if the Sun—which can house
over a million Earth s in its volume—were to become a black hole, it would have to shrink
to a sphere with a radius of only 3 km. This is less than the size of even a small city! This
should give you an idea of how dense a black hole is.
Food for Thought
FFT 9.2.6. You say “No one can see a black hole or dark matter; so how can you even say that
they exist.” I say “Have you ﬂown on a jet airplane? The pilot cannot see through the clouds;
cannot see distant objects—which are rapidly approaching the plane due to its enormous speed;
cannot see all the planes that are landing at the destination airport at about the same time. But
the ‘eye’ of the airplane, the radar device mounted on it, can.”
The accuracy and the speed with which a radar equipment can detect an approaching object is
far superior to any human’s vision. We don’t see radar; we don’t see the objects from which radar
gets reﬂected; we are completely blind to radars! But science (physics) is not! Physics predicted the
existence of microwaves when no human could even dream of such a thing. Then physics produced
the ﬁrst (artiﬁcial, of course!) microwave in the laboratory. Later physics also created devices that
were sensitive to microwaves.
After many years of successful and failed experimentations with microwaves, they were used
for detecting the motion of approaching objects. These experimentations were not unlike those of
a baby, who tries to discover the world around her: “these two blurry ‘objects’ that the two crude
light detectors on my face keep detecting, the same two objects that feed me when I’m hungry,
clean me when I’m dirty, comfort me when I’m uncomfortable, spoil me for no reason at all, and
keep forcing me to say ‘papa’ and ‘mama,’ must be special in my life.” So, when the device was
perfected to the point that it could use microwave to detect motion very accurately, it became
known as radar. And when scientists used radar over and over again (mostly in the military) and
saw that it worked, they started using it in airplanes. The baby grew up and her vision sharpened!
Every piece of physical knowledge, when used and reused with successful outcome, becomes an
extension of our senses. And for the same reason that we do not doubt the existence of a tree when
our eyes detect a green object with a brown stem, we should not doubt the existence of an object
if the physical knowledge in our possession “detects” that object. If Kepler’s third law, which has
been tested over and over again with success, tells us that the speed of stars in a galaxy indicate a
larger mass than the visible mass of the galaxy, we should infer dark matter. And if the universal
law of gravity, which has been relentlessly tested by astronomers and physicists, tells us that there
exist objects in our galaxy, which have such an enormous density as to capture light and trap it
permanently, we should accept black holes.
Just as the eyes of a baby are trained to recognize its parents and the world around it once
it becomes an adult, so are the immature inventions of science trained to recognize the universe
(mostly invisible to us), once they become mature. So, yes, black holes and dark matter are as real
as trees and tables!
9.3
Weightlessness
We have already mentioned that all objects fall at the same rate in a gravitational ﬁeld.
Consider now dropping a box with a cat inside it. Since the box and the cat fall at the
same rate, the cat will appear to be ﬂoating in the box. By the same token a man in an
elevator whose cables are severed, i.e., is in free fall, will be ﬂoating in the elevator. Thus,
he feels weightless. (See also the discussion at the end of Example D.7.6.)
If, instead of dropping the box and the elevator with their occupants straight down, we
give them an additional horizontal speed, the situation will not change. In this latter case,
both the container and its content will acquire the same horizontal speed, and again they
will move together. Hence, the cat and the man will feel weightless in the new motion as

well. To elucidate the argument ﬁrst imagine throwing two marbles at the same time with
one hand. The two marbles will move together until they land. Now replace one marble
with a small box. Once again, the box and the marble will move together, because they
have the same horizontal speed and the same vertical acceleration. In the third experiment
put the marble inside the box. Since the relative position of the marble and the box is
irrelevant, the two will move together, and if you look carefully inside the box, you will see
the marble ﬂoating. All the above experiments can be repeated for various sizes of marbles
and boxes with the same result. In particular, a 200 lb marble inside a room-sized box will
give the same result. Replacing marbles with cats and people will not change the outcome.
Now imagine standing on top of an incredibly high mountain peak and dropping the

box (or the elevator). Figure 9.2 shows that if the horizontal speed is great enough, the
container will eventually orbit the Earth. Thus any orbiting container is in free fall, and all
objects inside it appear weightless.
To further appreciate the seemingly puzzling fact that orbiting objects are in free fall,
imagine what would happen if the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth were turned oﬀ. The
object would move away from the Earth on a straight line with constant speed due to the
ﬁrst law of motion. The gravity, on the other hand, pulls the object down, i.e., makes the
object fall from the potentially long distance it would travel if gravity were absent. This
process of pulling down takes place constantly and instantaneously. The following example
puts a little quantitative touch on the discussion.
Example 9.3.1. A space shuttle or a satellite has a circular orbit with radius r slightly larger
than the radius of the Earth (see Figure 9.6). Previously, we calculated the speed of the satellite to
be about 7900 m/s. To see that this motion is a free fall motion, imagine that a cosmic switchboard
operator turned oﬀthe Earth’s gravity for only one second. Then, according to the laws of motion,
the satellite would continue on a straight line as shown in the ﬁgure, traveling 7900 m in one second.
This distance is exaggerated in the ﬁgure for clarity. We can readily calculate the increase h in
height using Pythagorean theorem and the fact that h << r [see Math Note E.9.4 on page 86 of
Appendix.pdf for details]. The result is h = 4.9 m. Thus, with gravity absent, the satellite would
move away from the center of the Earth only 4.9 m in one second. But, as shown in Example 4.3.6,
this is precisely the distance an object falls freely toward the center in one second. We therefore
conclude that all objects circling the Earth are pulled back to the Earth precisely at a rate to keep
them in their orbits, no more and no less! This pull-back is what we call a free fall motion.

speed to it, and notes that it stays aﬂoat in midair. He concludes that the ﬁrst law holds.
In a second experiment he gives the ball an initial velocity and notes that it travels on a
straight line with constant speed as expected by the ﬁrst law. He comes down on Earth and
performs the same experiment. He releases a ball and notices that it falls to the ground.
He gives it an initial velocity and observes that it does not follow a straight path, but a
curved one terminating on the surface of the Earth. He then concludes that either
• the ﬁrst law is wrong, or
• there is a force acting on the object, or
• the Earth is a peculiar reference frame in which the ﬁrst law does not hold.
As you shall see later, the choices above diﬀerentiate between Newton’s theory of gravity
and Einstein’s general theory of relativity (GTR). Newtonian theory accepts the ﬁrst law,
and the fact that there is a force, called gravity, and rejects the peculiarity of the Earth’s
reference frame. Einstein, on the other hand, rejects the existence of a gravitational force,
and blames the violation of the ﬁrst law on the peculiar nature of the Earth reference frame.
This basic diﬀerence in outlook leads to two diﬀerent descriptions of gravitation to which
we shall return later in the book.

Answers to “What do you know?”
9.1. Both apples are the same distance from the Earth center. Therefore, they must have
the same acceleration because of Equation (9.2).
9.2. Equation (9.2) indicates that the acceleration is a quarter of the previous acceleration.
Numerically, the new acceleration is one fourth of 9.8 or 2.45 m/s2.
9.3. Equation (9.3) shows that the speed of a satellite circling any celestial body decreases
as the square root of the distance from the center of the body. For Earth, at one radius
(low altitude), the speed of the satellite is 8 km/s. The altitude of 3R corresponds to a
distance of four radii from the Earth’s center. With 4 times the distance of the low altitude
satellites, this satellite must have 1/
√
4, or half the speed of a low altitude satellite. Thus,
the speed is 4 km/s or 9000 mph.
9.4. If you plug in the values of speed (10,000 m/s), G, and M in Equation (9.3), you get
4,002,000 m or 4002 km for r, the orbit’s radius. This is less than the Earth’s radius! So,
no such satellite can exist for Earth.
9.5. If the radius of the gravitating body is R, then add the constant GMm/R to Equation
(9.6).
9.6.
Decreasing r, the distance from the Sun, decreases −GMm/r.
So the KE must
increase, i.e., the speed of the planet must increase.
9.7. The potential energy increases with distance (the magnitude decreases, but since PE
is negative, it increases). Since total energy is constant, KE must decrease. Eventually,
when the probe is almost inﬁnitely far away, PE is almost zero. Hence, KE becomes equal
to the total energy E.
9.8. The apple only feels the gravity of the sphere right beneath it. At the beginning it is
the entire globe. As it moves toward the center, the gravitating sphere becomes smaller and
smaller (see Figure 9.3 and page 138) and the force of gravity weaker and weaker, until it
reaches the center. All this time the apple has been accelerating. So, it has the maximum
speed when it reaches the center. As it passes the center, the force of gravity has a retarding
eﬀect, dragging the apple toward the center. The apple slows down, until it reaches the
other side of the globe. The maximum speed is reached at the center, because all the initial
potential energy (which is the total energy, as the apple is assumed to have no KE at the

Section 9.4
End-of-Chapter Material
147
beginning) gets converted into KE at the center. When it reaches the other end, it will
stop, because the PE there is identical to PE at the beginning, where KE was zero.
9.9. Since the escape velocity is proportional to the inverse of the square root of the radius,
for the inﬂated Earth it will be √1, 000, 000 or 1000 times smaller than that of the current
Earth. Example 9.2.4 gives the Earth’s escape velocity as 11000 m/s. So, the inﬂated Earth
would have an escape velocity of 11 m/s or about 25 mph. A hard throw has more speed
than this.

Zero?
9.11. An elevator in free fall eliminates gravity inside. So, if the elevator falls at the rate
of 9.8 m/s2, no gravity exists inside the elevator. Suppose the elevator keeps falling at the

objects in the elevator? Does this suggest a way of producing artiﬁcial gravity in space?

9.4. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a colossal machine that is designed to look inside
matter at the smallest scale. For this, it needs to accelerate particles to enormous speeds

a black hole which will gobble up the Earth.
Some groups are even suing CERN, the
institution building and operating the LHC. From formula 9.9, estimate the mass needed
to create a black hole the size of the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, 10−15 m. Compare this
with the mass of a few grams used in a typical run of the LHC.

Epilogue: Determinism
Galileo predicted that in the hands of the future generations of physicists, his methodology
would open completely new vistas of the universe. Newton was the ﬁrst and the greatest
personiﬁcation of this prediction. He carried out Galileo’s methodology to its most proliﬁc
limits, thereby climbing to the highest peak of the scientiﬁc terrain in history.
10.1
Newton’s Methodology
Once the Aristotelian holistic approach to the investigation of nature was toppled by Galileo,
the gate to the garden of knowledge opened up to mankind.
Newton inherited, among
other things, the indispensable scientiﬁc methodology introduced by Galileo, and applied

it very eﬀectively to the physics of motion, discovering its three fundamental laws. Later
generations of mathematicians and physicists applied these laws successfully to such a wide
variety of situations that for over two centuries the words “physics” and “Newton” were
indistinguishable.
10.1.1
Speciﬁcity
In his analysis of motion, Newton adhered to the Galilean philosophy of concentrating on a
speciﬁc aspect of a speciﬁc moving object. If we are interested in the properties of motion
in general, Newton argued, we had better concentrate on the motion of a ball, for example.
The Aristotelian holistic statement that “some objects fall, and some rise,” and that “apple
belongs to the ﬁrst category” is a completely useless statement, Newton might have said.
We gain knowledge about motion only if we concentrate on a moving apple.
His concentration on the motion of speciﬁc objects led Newton to a precise deﬁnition
of velocity and acceleration and the (co-)invention of calculus. To ﬁnd the velocity of an

apple, it is not suﬃcient to simply divide the distance it travels by the travel time, because
the apple may change its velocity from moment to moment. Thus, Newton argued, we have
to speak of the instantaneous velocity of the apple, whereby apple’s travel time is shrunk to
an inﬁnitesimal. Similarly, one has to speak of the instantaneous acceleration, because the
rate of change of the velocity of an apple may be diﬀerent at diﬀerent parts of its motion.
These instantaneous quantities were the paradigms of the general concept of the derivative,
a fundamental notion in calculus.
Newton’s further analysis of the motion of an apple led to the question of why it is
accelerating. His answer was that the apple must be inﬂuenced by a force and that the
acceleration of the apple must be directly proportional to the force exerted on the apple. And
only after analyzing the speciﬁc motion of an apple did he arrive at the general statement

152
Chapter 10
Epilogue: Determinism
that the acceleration of any object must be directly proportional to the force exerted on
that object. Thus the (universal) second law of motion came about as a result of analyzing
the motion of a speciﬁc object, in exact analogy to Kepler’s discovery of his three planetary
laws by investigating the motion of Mars.
Newton’s discovery of the universal law of gravitation was also a result of the analysis of
the speciﬁc motion of the Moon and an apple: By comparing the accelerations of a speciﬁc
object in free fall on Earth with the acceleration of the Moon as it circles the Earth, he was
able to arrive at his mathematical statement of the law of gravitation.
10.1.2
Idealization/Isolation
Earth, Moon, and apple are very complicated structures. The water covering about three
fourths of its surface, the atmosphere hovering above its surface, the mountain ranges,
the forests, the life, and a myriad other complications make Earth anything but simple.
Similar complications exist for Moon. The non-uniformity of its internal parts, the existence
of a stem with a dimple on the skin, etc., make an apple also a complicated structure.
Yet Newton, following Galileo’s advice, ignored all such complications and idealized the
three structures to geometrical points.
This took a tremendous amount of insight and
abstraction, especially since Newton was the ﬁrst to implement the notion of idealization
in this particular fashion.
A holistic philosopher would have nauseated at the thought of such a breach of the
apparent reality. On the other hand, a holistic philosopher would have never discovered the

mathematical statement of the law of gravity. A holistic philosopher sees the complexity
of a “whole” physical system and gets lost in the resulting imbroglio. In contrast, a sci-
entist, following in the footsteps of Galileo and Newton, sees the simplicity in the relevant
properties of an apple, or a Moon, or an Earth, ignores the complications, and discovers
laws governing the behavior of not only the system at hand, but other systems that may be
out of his/her reach. In fact, it was Newton himself, who after shrinking the Earth, Moon,
and the apple to a point and discovering the universal law of gravitation, came back and
applied the law to diﬀerent parts of the Earth, and successfully explained the occurrence of
the tides.
Newton elevated the process of idealization to a new level, which we can call isolation.
Although he was aware of the inﬂuence of the Sun and the rest of the planets on the
motion of the Moon and the apple, he ignored them! As revolting as this procedure may
have appeared to a contemporaneous holistic philosopher, it was the right thing to do. It
was the scientiﬁc thing to do.
It still is the scientiﬁc thing to do!
These philosophers
have a tendency to emphasize the existence of the “inﬂuence,” but conveniently ignore its
magnitude! If A and B both inﬂuence C, but A’s inﬂuence is a thousand times stronger
than B’s, is it not reasonable to ignore the latter? After all, our measuring devices are
not inﬁnitely accurate, and we may not be able to even detect B’s inﬂuence! Example
D.10.1 on page 31 of Appendix.pdf compares the forces of gravity on an apple and the
Moon exerted by the Sun and the Earth. In it, you will see that the Sun pulls an apple with
a force that is over ten million times smaller than the Earth’s force; and the force of the
Sun on the Moon, although relatively larger, is still only about one percent of the Earth’s.
Did Newton do the wrong thing in ignoring the Sun’s gravity? Did he have to bog
himself down with the Sun’s gravitational eﬀect on the apple even though it is less than
one ten millionth of the Earth’s eﬀect? Or its eﬀect on the Moon even though it is only
about one percent of the Earth’s eﬀect? All scientists say “no” to all these questions, while
all holistic philosophers of science say “yes.” The latter abhor speciﬁcity, and as such, are
against the scientiﬁc methodology of Galileo, Newton, and all the other scientists that came
after them.

Continuity
“If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” said Newton of how
he made his enormous contributions to physics and mathematics. With this, not only was
he acknowledging his gratitude to others, but also codifying the very nature of scientiﬁc
progress. The noted scientists before Newton were the initiators of Renaissance science,
and as such, were the creators of new knowledge. Copernicus started his revolution without
ammunition from previous generations of astronomers;1 Galileo had very little to go by in
his study of motion; Kepler had access only to a collection of raw (albeit, very accurate)

data left to him by Tycho Brahe, but to no systematic knowledge except the Copernican
astronomy.
Newton set a trend in that he recognized the essentiality of using the existing knowledge
to gain further understanding of nature. He realized that, contrary to Aristotle and other
holistic philosophers, the universe was too big for a single man to understand. That is why
he so beautifully summarized this aspect of science:
Box 10.1.1. “To explain all nature is too diﬃcult a task for any one man or even for
any one age. ’Tis much better to do a little with certainty, and leave the rest for others
that come after you, than to explain all things.”
The scientiﬁc nature of a discipline is determined by the extent to which its new discov-
eries use the accumulation of the existing knowledge. Any discipline whose practitioners
propose “theories” only to be ignored by the future practitioners, who in turn come up with
their own “theories” to be ignored by the next generation, is not a scientiﬁc discipline. In
fact, one can go so far as to say that the most decisive litmus test for scientiﬁc nature of a
discipline is to see how much the discipline incorporates its existing knowledge in its new
discoveries.
10.1.4
Use/Creation of Mathematics
The title of Newton’s opus magnum is Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, trans-
lated as Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. His use of the word Mathematica in
the title of the book signiﬁes another milestone he laid for the investigation of the physical
universe.
Galileo was the ﬁrst scientist to discover the “language of Nature,” but Newton became
the most ﬂuent speaker of this language. As he investigated motion, Nature whispered to
Newton that he needed to learn and perfect the “dialect” of diﬀerential calculus. And when
he was working on his gravitational theory, he discovered that Nature was chatting with
him in the new parlance of integral calculus.
The use and creation of mathematics resulting from the communication with Nature
was not new to Galileo and Newton.
In fact, Nature started to whisper into Egyptian
and Babylonian ears when they were compelled to employ mathematics in their day-to-day
activities. They then passed on their acquired pidgin to the Greeks, who in turn transformed
the primitive language into the most sophisticated tongue of the time, Euclidean geometry.
However, Newton’s conversation with Nature included a new part of speech, time. Al-
though the ancients, including the Greeks, were aware of the notion of time, and although
the idea of a derivative and an inﬁnitesimal were known to Newton’s contemporaries (even
to the ancient mathematicians), it was Newton who combined the two concepts and intro-
duced the idea of inﬁnitesimal rate of change or derivative with respect to time, an idea
that proved to be crucial for the development of not only mechanics, but the entire ﬁeld

Epilogue: Determinism
of physics. After discovering the mathematical expression for the law of gravity, Newton
employed the notion of derivative with respect to time in conjunction with that law to come
up with the ﬁrst diﬀerential equation in the history of mankind.
10.2
Determinism of Newtonian Physics
It is a fact of nature that physical quantities do not change abruptly and suddenly with
time or motion.2 Any force applied to a moving object, changes smoothly and slowly. For
example, gravity decreases with distance and it does so slowly and smoothly. The same
smoothness, or continuity, applies not only to all forces but also to all physical quantities.
Even artiﬁcial abrupt application of forces such as the force of hammer on a nail only
appears as abrupt. On a microscopic level, the atoms of the nail “feel” the approach of the
atoms of the hammer at a distance because of electrical forces that act between the two
sets of atoms.
As Math Note E.10.1 on page 86 of Appendix.pdf illustrates, this principle of con-
tinuity, combined with Newton’s laws of motion, leads to the fundamental philosophical
concept, determinism. As applied to the motion of a particle, determinism states that
Box 10.2.1. If the initial velocity and position of a particle are given, the subsequent
motion of the particle can be predicted exactly, once the force acting on the particle is
known during its entire motion.
10.2.1
Calculating Earth’s Orbit
Let us apply Newton’s laws to the motion of Earth around the Sun to illustrate determinism.
The line connecting the Earth to the Sun and the line along which Earth moves initially form
a plane which we take to be the xy-plane. Since the gravitational force has no component
perpendicular to this plane, Earth will always be conﬁned to the xy-plane. Choose the
x-axis to be the line joining the Sun to the initial position of Earth, and assume that Earth
moves with a speed of 30,000 m/s (the approximate value of the average speed of Earth
around the Sun) in the positive y-direction. The subsequent motion can be broken up into
an x-motion and a y-motion.
From the initial coordinates and velocity, as well as the laws of motion, we can calculate
the coordinates and the components of the velocity a little later. For the interested readers,
this is discussed in great detail in Math Note E.10.2 on page 87 of Appendix.pdf , where
“a little later” means 60 seconds later. From these newly obtained data and the laws of
motion as applied to the new location and velocity of Earth, we can ﬁnd the coordinates and
the components of velocity another minute later. Continuing this process, we can chart the
location of Earth around the Sun for a complete revolution as shown in Math Note E.10.2.
Thus the initial location and velocity of Earth determines its motion for eternity. This is a
simple example of determinism.
10.2.2
The Solar System
What if we have more than one particle? Can the laws of motion, combined with the theory
of diﬀerential equations, predict the behavior of an assembly of particles? Yes. Of course,
2Here “abrupt” and “sudden” mean “in no time,” i.e., in zero time in the strictest mathematical sense.
The notions of “suddenness” and “abruptness” are relative. In the same time interval that it takes you to
“suddenly” apply the brake pedal of your car as soon as you see a danger, the radio waves of your favorite
station travel about 20,000 miles, and millions upon millions of cosmic rays pass through your body! There
is nothing abrupt for them!

Determinism of Newtonian Physics

we must know the initial positions and velocities of all particles, as well as the interacting
force between each pair of particles in the assembly.
The solar system was a great testing ground for Newtonian physics. The law of gravity,
in the form of a mathematical formula for the force between any pair of bodies in the
solar system, was known.
Furthermore, the theory of diﬀerential equations was greatly
developed by the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century. Thus,
starting with an observed conﬁguration of the solar system, the mathematical physicists of
that era could predict the conﬁguration, i.e., positions and velocities of the planets in the
solar system at any later time. The incredible agreement between theoretical predictions
and observations compelled almost all physicists of that time into a semi-religious faith in
Newtonian physics. There were of course instances in which the observation disagreed with
the theory, and those of weaker faith started to doubt Newtonian physics. However, the true
believers found other ways of bringing the theory into agreement with observation without
abandoning the cherished laws of physics. One such instance deserves closer examination.
Sir William Herschel (1738-1822), the German-English astronomer, discovered the planet
Uranus in 1781. This discovery brought a tremendous wave of excitement to the tranquil
ﬁeld of astronomy of the solar system which had studied only six planets ever since the
Greeks. Now the astronomers, both theoretical and observational, had to take into consid-
eration the motion of the new intruder when studying other planets and their satellites.
Two astronomers, John C. Adams (1819-1892) from England and Urbain J. J. LeVerrier
(1811-1877) from France were particularly interested in the motion of Uranus itself. As
they scrutinized its motion, they noted that Uranus did not behave according to Newton’s
theory of gravitation.
Being ﬁrm believers of this theory, they both assumed (Adams

in 1845 and Leverrier in 1846) the existence of yet another planet whose presence beyond
Uranus could explain the anomalous behavior of the latter. Adams sent his ﬁndings to Airy,
the astronomer royal and a nonbeliever, who discarded it, being sure that the anomaly of
Uranus’ motion was due to the imperfections in the theory of gravitation. Leverrier, on the
other hand, was lucky. He sent his ﬁndings, along with the approximate location of the new
planet in the sky, to Johann G. Galle (1812-1910), the director of the Berlin Observatory.
Upon the receipt of LeVerrier’s letter, Galle started to look for the new intruder, and within
hours could spot the planet that we now call Neptune.
It was such ﬂawless predictions of ghostly celestial bodies, plus countless other terrestrial
and celestial predictions by Newtonian physics that gave it an awesome veracity. Put your-
self in the position of the nineteenth century theoretical physicists, who, merely on the basis
of a small disturbance in the orbit of one planet, and working with a mathematical equation
written down more than 150 years earlier, could forecast the existence of a whole new world
in the solar system. Imagine the awesome joy they felt when observation conﬁrmed their
predictions, and the impulse toward a religion-like faith in the theory that predicted the
observations!
10.2.3
Determinism
If Newtonian theory works for the solar system with such precision, why not apply it to
everything? Find out the equation for interactions among any number of particles and the
machinery of diﬀerential equations can predict the behavior of these particles once their
initial conﬁguration is given! Of course, the determination of the initial conﬁguration and
the subsequent propulsion of the machinery of diﬀerential equations may not be an easy
practical task. In practice, even the problem of three particles interacting gravitationally
has not been “solved.” In principle, however, there is no diﬃculty imagining a supercom-
puter capable of crunching an enormous quantity of numbers corresponding to the initial
conﬁguration and the diﬀerential equations manipulating them, and giving out the conﬁg-
uration of the system at a later time. The existence and uniqueness of the conﬁguration at
any speciﬁed time are proven mathematical facts.

156
Chapter 10
Epilogue: Determinism
Determinism is a result of such forceful mathematical statements concerning the ex-
istence and uniqueness of subsequent conﬁguration given an initial conﬁguration. Apply
this statement to the collection of all atoms and molecules in the universe, and you have
excluded any kind of free will and chance. Determinism states that
Determinism stated.
Box 10.2.2. If the conﬁguration of all the atoms in the universe is given at an initial
time, the atoms will evolve in a predetermined way for the rest of eternity.
According to the deterministic philosophy, the formation of galaxies, the emergence of
stars in galaxies, the appearance of planets, the evolution of life, the development of human
beings, and the subsequent human history are all predetermined by the initial conﬁgura-
tion of the atoms in the universe. An omnipotent supreme being that chooses the initial
conﬁguration, simultaneously ﬁxes the future of the universe for the rest of eternity. In a
very real sense, even the supreme being loses control of the subsequent development of the
universe. Little wonder Einstein, a determinist, said “I wonder if God had any choice in
creating the universe.”
But the world is not deterministic! The advent of the quantum theory in 1925–1926

paved the way for an indeterministic universe, and by 1930 every evidence pointed to a
highly unpredictable atomic world. According to this theory, of which we shall have a lot
more to say in Part V, it is impossible to predict the behavior of atoms and subatomic
particles deterministically as Newtonian physics suggests.
In fact, it was due to failing
attempts to reconcile the deterministic Newtonian physics with the behavior of subatomic
particles that the indeterminism of the microworld was forced on the physicists of the 1920s
and 1930s.

Part III
Waves and Electromagnetism


Chapter11
Waves
When he was 23, Newton bought a glass prism “to try therewith the phenomena of colour.”
And with this the science of optics started. He probably made many fundamental discoveries
in that ﬁeld during the next three decades of his life. However, sometime in February, 1692,
a light, left burning in his room while he was away, started a ﬁre that eventually destroyed
his papers including a large work on optics describing the results of his research of twenty
years. Nevertheless, he managed to reconstruct most of his experiments, and published his
results in Optick in 1704.
In one of his experiments, Newton showed that lights of diﬀerent colors, when sent
through a prism, bend (or refract) at diﬀerent angles. And when he sent sunlight through
the prism, he noticed that it dispersed into diﬀerent colors. He thus concluded that white
light is simply a mixture of lights of diﬀerent colors. In another experiment he passed light
through some combination of thin lenses and discovered what is now called Newton’s rings,
a succession of bright and dark circles formed when the lenses were illuminated with light.
Both of the phenomena mentioned above—especially the formation of Newton’s rings—
can best be explained by assuming that light is a wave.
However, Newton vehemently
opposed the idea that light can be a wave, and he got into bitter argument with those
who advocated this idea, in particular the Dutch physicist, Christian Huygens. Newton
thought of light as a beam of tiny particles streaming through space. Huygens, on the other
hand, believed that light is a wave; and although the wave theory explained the dispersion
of sunlight and the formation of Newton’s rings more eﬀectively than the particle theory,
it did not account for lack of evidence for the “bending” of light around edges as sound
(which all agree to be a wave) does. This debate continued until 1801 when Thomas Young,
a British physicist, showed unequivocally that light is indeed a wave.
With the unprecedented advance of mathematics—resulting mostly from the application
of Newtonian physics to diﬀerent media—in the eighteenth and the beginning of the nine-
teenth centuries, it was realized that mechanical waves appear in many diﬀerent situations.
In fact, with the exception of light itself, all other waves could be treated as mechanical
waves, arising from a mechanical motion of some kind of elastic medium. Furthermore, all
these waves obey the same mathematical equation, known as the wave equation. The
universality and the simplicity of this equation makes it truly a piece of (mathematical) art,
which—to emphasize its aﬃnity to other forms of art—we display in Figure 11.1.
In the wave equation, the symbol Ψ represents the displacement of the medium from its
equilibrium position, for example, the up-down displacement of water in a quiet pond when
a stone is thrown in it. The symbol ∇represents how Ψ changes in space, and
∂
∂t how it
changes with time. Thus, Ψ is a function of space and time: At any ﬁxed point of space
(e.g., a point in the pond) the displacement changes with time (the water moves up and
down), and at any ﬁxed time (e.g., a snapshot of the pond), the displacement Ψ changes

over space (at some points it has a crest, at others a trough). The wave equation connects
the space and time variations in a particular way. The symbol v in the wave equation is
the speed with which the wave travels.
We shall not deal with the mathematical aspect of the wave equation at all. However,
because of its importance in the subsequent discussions, we shall talk about waves them-
selves, and as a paradigm, concentrate on mechanical waves produced in elastic media by
mechanical oscillations, keeping in mind that almost all properties discussed here carry over
intact to considerations involving other kinds of waves. First let’s understand the notion of
oscillation.
11.1
Oscillation
If a mass is attached to one end of a spring, whose other end is ﬁxed, it performs a repetitive
motion when the spring is stretched out and released. In general, the repetition may be
complicated. However, if the amount of stretch is small,1 the motion of the mass-spring
system will be simpliﬁed considerably. This motion is called a simple harmonic motion
(SHM) and whatever performs such a motion, a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO). In
Figure 11.2 we have shown the (small) displacement of the mass-spring system as a function
of time.
An important characteristic of an SHM is its period T deﬁned as the time required for

the SHO to return to its “original” position, which could be any position during the course
of its motion. Figure 11.2 shows the SHM of a mass attached to a spring. Imagine the
spring oscillating vertically while a scroll of paper moves uniformly under a marker fastened
to the mass. Then the horizontal distance on the paper represents time (e.g., if the paper
scrolls at the rate of one centimeter per second, then each centimeter of the paper represents
one second), and the curve produced by the marker describes the motion of the mass as
a function of time. On such a graph, you can easily read oﬀthe period of the SHM: It is
the horizontal distance between any position of the mass and the next identical position.
In Figure 11.2 three arbitrary positions, P1, P2, and P3, are shown. At a later time, the
mass will be executing identical motions at the corresponding positions, P ′
1, P ′
2, and P ′
3. It
follows that any of the horizontal distances, P1P ′
1, P2P ′
2, or P3P ′
3 is one period.
The motion undergone by an SHO during one period is called a cycle. An important

performed by the SHM in one second. If the period is T seconds (say T = 0.1 second), then
the number of cycles repeated in one second would be 1/T (1/0.1 = 10). Thus, one can
write
f = 1
T .
(11.1)
Since T is measured in seconds, frequency is measured in units of s−1, or cycles per second
(cps), which is also called Hertz and abbreviated as Hz.
What do you know? 11.1. The frequency of an oscillator is 500 Hz. What is its
period?
Example 11.1.1. A pendulum—a heavy bob hanging from one end of a very light string whose
other end is ﬁxed—describes SHM when its initial displacement is small. For such a pendulum the
period in seconds is given approximately by T = 2π
p
l/g, where l is the length of the string in
meters and g is the gravitational acceleration (equal to 9.8 m/s2 at the surface of the Earth). If l = 5
cm, the period will be approximately 0.449 second and the frequency f = 1/T = 1/0.449 = 2.23
Hz. The same pendulum on the Moon, with a gravitational acceleration of 1.62 m/s2, will have a
period of 1.1 seconds and a frequency of 0.9 Hz.
■
The signiﬁcance of SHM lies in the fact that any other repetitive motion can be rep-
resented as a superposition of (inﬁnitely) many SHMs with diﬀerent frequencies. In some
sense, by studying SHM, you become familiar with the basic building block of all repeti-
tive motions. The construction of a general repetitive motion out of SHMs, however, is a
complex procedure beyond the scope of this book.
11.2
Mechanical Waves
Any disturbance in an elastic medium has a tendency to propagate in that medium. For
instance, a stone dropped in a quiet pond creates a disturbance in the form of a small circle
with center at the point where the stone strikes the water; and this disturbance propagates
(spreads) through the pond in the form of circles increasing in size. Similarly, a disturbance
at one end of a rope propagates to the other end.

medium continuously, the resulting eﬀect propagates in the form of a wave. Figure 11.3
shows a pulse and the corresponding wave on a rope. In Figure 11.3(a) the shape of the rope
carrying a pulse is shown at various times. In Figure 11.3(b) the source keeps producing
disturbances on the left which move to the right in the form of a train of pulses. This train
of moving pulses is called a wave.

later, create another pulse. How far ahead of the second pulse is the ﬁrst pulse if the
speed of the disturbance is 0.6 m/s.
The shape of the wave depends on the motion of its source. Only waves produced by a
source in SHM will be discussed here. As mentioned above, any other wave is a superposition
of these simple waves. Suppose that the source that produces the complicated wave pattern
on the rope of Figure 11.3(b) is replaced with a SHO. Then the shape of the wave will be
simple and smooth as shown in Figure 11.4. Such a wave is called a simple harmonic
wave. The shape of the rope is shown at times equal to multiples of T/2 where T is the

know how to diﬀerentiate Figure 11.4 from Figure 11.2. In the latter, the displacement
of the source (e.g., the mass in the mass-spring system) is shown as a function of time.
Figure 11.4, on the other hand, is a snapshot of the actual shape of the rope at various
times.
An important characteristic of a simple harmonic wave is its wavelength. As shown
Wavelength deﬁned.
in Figure 11.4, it is the distance the wave front moves in one period. Thus, the distance
between the open circle at t = 0 and the one at t = T is the wavelength λ. Similarly the
front corresponding to the open triangle is produced at t = T/2 and will have moved a
distance λ when the time is t = 3T/2. The ﬁgure does not show when the open square was
formed. (It was produced at t = T/4, for which no snapshot is shown.) However, we can
identify the point as the peak immediately following the open circle. In fact, in a general
case, where the extent of the wave may be too large—because its production started too
long ago—to allow the identiﬁcation of its front, the wavelength is determined by measuring
the distance between two “similar” points, such as two crests or two troughs, of the wave
train.
If you examine the rope carefully, you’ll see that, as a whole, it is not moving. Concen-

trating on an arbitrary point on the rope, you’ll note that it simply moves up and down,
i.e., it performs a SHM. If the rope as a whole is not moving to the right, and its parts are
not moving to the right, then what is moving to the right? It is the disturbance caused
by the source which, from piece to piece, from molecule to molecule, and from atom to
atom is transferred to the other end. As a small piece of the rope moves up, it drags the

moving along the rope. Since the disturbance carries energy, we say that it is the energy
that moves along the rope. This is particularly noticeable in the up-and-down motion of
a boat caused by water waves produced by other boats. That the wave carries energy, is
clear from its capacity to bob the boat. That it is not the water that moves as a whole, is
clear from the fact that the boat is not carried away.

the frequency, we can write
v = λf.
(11.2)
This is a very important relation and applies to all waves, not just waves on the rope.
If you know any two of the three quantities v, λ, and f, you can calculate the third one.
To determine the speed of the (mechanical, such as water) wave, you can measure the
frequency f, for instance, by counting the number of wave crests arriving each second, and
the wavelength λ (by measuring the distance between successive crests) and multiplying
them together. The following examples illustrate and clarify these concepts.
Example 11.2.1. A ﬁsherman notices that the water wave crests are 3 meters apart and that
10 crests arrive at his boat each second. What is the speed of the water waves? Here λ = 3 meters
and f = 10 Hz. Hence, Equation (11.2) immediately yields v = 3 × 10 = 30 m/s.
Sound travels with a speed of 340 m/s in air. The concert A note on a piano has a frequency
of 440 Hz. Thus, the wavelength of concert A in air can be determined from Equation (11.2):
340 = λ × 440. The result is λ = 0.77 meter or 77 cm.
An FM radio station transmits a radio wave of frequency 100 MHz (M stands for mega meaning
a million).
It is known that a radio wave travels at the speed of light, i.e., 300,000 km per
second, or 3 × 108 m/s. We can ﬁnd the wavelength of the FM wave: 3 × 108 = 100 × 106λ or
λ = 3 × 108/108 = 3 m. AM stations have frequencies in the range of 535 to 1605 kHz (kilohertz
or 1000 Hz).
Thus, the wavelength for a station broadcasting at 600 kHz is determined from
3 × 108 = 600, 000λ or λ = 3 × 108/600, 000 = 500 m.

its frequency, the higher the pitch of a sound wave, the larger its frequency, or the smaller
its wavelength. Normal human ear can detect frequencies as low as 20 Hz and as high as
20,000 Hz.

Color to light is what pitch is to sound. Thus, various colors of light correspond to
various wavelengths. The wavelength of the visible light extends from 4 × 10−7 m, the
wavelength of violet light, to 7 × 10−7 m, the wavelength of red. There are other (invisible)
lights, generally called electromagnetic waves, to which the human eye is not sensitive, and
whose wavelengths are either shorter than 4×10−7 m (ultraviolet light, X-rays, and gamma
rays), or longer than 7 × 10−7 m (infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves). Chapter 14

counterparts is the wave amplitude which is related to loudness for sound and brightness,
or intensity for light. Amplitude is simply the maximum displacement of the medium (the
rope, say) from its undisturbed position. Thus, huge water waves have larger amplitudes
than small ripples. Big water waves, with big amplitudes, are more capable of moving a
boat than small ones. Therefore, a wave with a larger amplitude carries more energy than
the one with a smaller amplitude. In fact, it is shown in mechanics that2
Box 11.2.2. The energy (or intensity) of a wave is proportional to the square of its
amplitude.
Based on the relation between the oscillation and propagation directions, waves are
divided into two categories: If the oscillation of the parts of the medium is at right angle
to the direction of the propagation of the wave (as in a rope or in water), the wave is said
to be transverse. A wave whose propagation is in the same direction as the oscillation of
the medium is called a longitudinal wave. A prime example of a longitudinal wave is the

sound wave. Figure 11.5 shows these two kinds of waves.
Consider the two waves of Figure 11.5 produced on the slinky. Suppose we pass the slinky
through a long rectangular slit (whose width is only slightly bigger than the diameter of
the slinky) cut out in a wood plank. If the rectangular slit is positioned vertically and the
slinky is given vertical transverse waves, then the wave will pass through the slit, oscillating
up and down along the slit. Now suppose we turn the plank 90 degrees. Then, the slit will
be horizontal while the transverse slinky waves are vertical. The slit will stop the waves.
On the other hand, a longitudinal slinky wave is not sensitive to the orientation of the slit.
This is how transverse waves are distinguished. Due to this property, transverse waves are
said to be polarized or to have polarization. Polarized Sun glasses take advantage of the

Interference and Diﬀraction
When two waves in a quiet pond reach a common region, they will “meet” for a while and
then go their own separate ways. This is a consequence of an important property of waves
called superposition, which simply states that when two waves reach a common point
of the medium in which they are propagating, the total disturbance of that point is the
algebraic sum of the two disturbances and the presence of one wave does not aﬀect the
Superposition principle.
properties of the other (see Figure 11.6).
Let us take a closer look at the superposition principle. Recall that when a wave reaches
a point P of the medium, it tends to start a local oscillation of that point. If two waves
reach P at the same time, the total oscillation of P is simply the algebraic sum of the
oscillations corresponding to the two waves. If both waves have a tendency to move P
up—as the two waves in Figure 11.6 tend to do to P1—then both oscillations are positive
and the total oscillation will be the sum of the two oscillations. Similarly, if both waves
have a tendency to move P down—as the two waves in Figure 11.6 tend to do to P2—then
both oscillations are negative and the total oscillation will be the (negative) sum of the
two oscillations. Points such as P1 or P2 where the waves reinforce each other are called
points of constructive interference. In contrast, the two waves of Figure 11.6 reaching
Q1 or Q2 have opposite signs because one wave tends to move Q1 up (and Q2 down) while

the other wave wants to move Q1 down (and Q2 up). The result is the diﬀerence between
the two waves. Points such as Q1 or Q2 where the waves cancel each other are points of
destructive interference.
What do you know? 11.3. How many points of constructive interference do you see
in Figure 11.6? How many destructive?
Now suppose that we have two sources which produce waves in such a way that at
certain points in the medium the positive oscillation of the wave coming from one source
is always canceled by the negative oscillation of the other wave.
Then at these points
we have minimum or no oscillation. This means that a detector of wave placed at these
points will detect no wave at any time during which the two sources above are operating.

(b) Plot of intensity as a function of (vertical) position on the screen.
In contrast, there are other points in the medium for which the two waves always arrive
with oscillations of the same sign. Such points oscillate strongly and a wave detector can
detect maximum oscillation at all times. Such a consistent cancellation or reinforcement
is possible only because the motion is periodic. If the two waves cancel (or reinforce each
other) the ﬁrst few times, then they will cancel (or reinforce each other) repeatedly because
the same motion gets repeated over and over again. For example, half way between C and
D in Figure 11.7(b) has maximum oscillation at all times because it is always the meeting
ground of two wave crests (or two troughs).
Point C or D, on the other hand, has no
oscillation, being where a crest and a trough meet.

is called fringes or the interference pattern (Figure 11.7). Since the points of maxima

and minima remain so for the coherent sources, the interference pattern is a stationary
pattern, i.e., it does not change in time. Interference can also take place if three or more
sources produce coherent waves. Further analysis of interference can be found in Math
Note E.11.1 on page 91 of Appendix.pdf .
In a typical interference experiment a wave is incident on a pair of holes (a double slit)
which act as two sources for the other side.
These sources are coherent, because they
are created from the same “parent” wave. The interference pattern can be observed on a
detecting screen, which could be a white screen in the case of light, or a detector (ears of
a person in the case of sound) that can move and record the variation in intensity of the
fringes.
Waves have another distinguishing property called diﬀraction. Simply stated, it is the

bending of waves “around the corner.” A wave approaching an obstacle with an aperture
produces spherical (assuming that the aperture is circular) waves as it penetrates through
the opening [Figure 11.8(a)], and a detector located at an angle from the direction of the
motion of the original wave can detect the wave.
The phenomenon of diﬀraction (and other wave properties) can be explained by Huy-
gens’ principle. which states that the motion of a wave can be determined by assuming

that each wave front is composed of inﬁnitely many point sources each producing spherical
waves. Thus, starting with any wave front, we can construct the new front by drawing equal
circles centered at every point of the old front (see Figure 11.9).
The alert reader may have noticed that the wave produced in the outgoing side of the

aperture of Figure 11.8(a) is not composed of uniform circles, but rather of circles, along
each of which the intensity varies. This is because the points of the wave at the aperture
act as (inﬁnitely) many little sources, which interfere as in the case of multiple slits, and
produce a pattern analogous to the interference pattern. Figure 11.8(a) shows a vertical
screen (the white line) that collects the wave and shows its intensity at various points on it.
If we plot the intensity of the wave as a function of vertical distance on the screen, we get
something similar to Figure 11.8(c). It is seen that there is a “central band,” on both sides
of which the intensity drops to zero. Beyond the central band the intensity is practically
negligible, although one can detect some very weak “secondary bands.” The amount of
diﬀraction “bending” is thus related to the width of the central band, denoted by ∆y. It
turns out that ∆y depends on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the opening. If this
ratio is of the order of unity the width of the band is noticeably large (as compared to the
size of the opening). If, on the other hand, the ratio is too small, i.e., if the aperture is too

large compared to the wavelength, then ∆y becomes equal to the size of the opening, and
the diﬀraction (bending) eﬀect disappears.
A similar condition holds for interference: If the distance d between the two coherent
sources of Figure 11.7 is too much bigger than the wavelength, the interference pattern
will not be formed. The wave nature of light escaped detection for centuries because of
this fact. Light’s wavelength is much too small compared to any ordinary openings and
distances. Thus, neither interference nor diﬀraction of light can be observed by passing it
through ordinary holes and apertures. On the other hand, we witness the diﬀraction of
sound everyday when we hear a speaker’s voice around the corner of an open door. That is
because the wavelength of a typical sound wave is comparable to the size of a typical door.
Box 11.3.1. For interference and diﬀraction to take place, the appropriate size (sepa-
ration of the two holes for interference, and the diameter of the aperture for diﬀraction)
must be comparable to the wavelength.
It is important (and it becomes even more so when dealing with subatomic phenomena)
to point out that

Figure 11.9: Any point of a wave front can be considered a new point source. This is Huygens’ principle.
If, instead of a wave, bullets are sent through the aperture of Figure 11.8, it is impossible to
detect bullets at large angles from their original direction of motion [Figure 11.8 (d)]. This
is the reason that for a long time light was assumed to be corpuscular. Every time light
was sent through an aperture, it could be detected only directly opposite to it [point A in
Figure 11.8 (b)]. The interference and diﬀraction phenomena have dramatic consequences
in quantum theory of subatomic particles to which we shall return later in the book (see
especially Section 23.2).
What do you know? 11.4. In one experiment a wave with a frequency of 500 Hz
approaches two holes whose separation is 50 cm. Does interference occur on the other
side? The speed of the wave is 3 m/s. In another experiment the same wave approaches
an aperture whose diameter is 1 cm. Does diﬀraction occur on the other side?

Doppler Eﬀect
Everyone has experienced the change in the pitch (frequency) of the sound of a moving ﬁre
truck, ambulance, police car, or a train as they pass by. This is Doppler eﬀect in action
for sound waves. All waves exhibit this eﬀect.
Consider a small source of waves at a point P, which produces spherical waves with P
as their common center. As shown in Figure 11.10(a), the distance between consecutive
spheres is simply the wavelength. A detector located at O detects the wavelength as λ and
the frequency as f = c/λ where c is the speed of the wave. Here we are adhering to the
convention that, when the source or detector of wave is moving, c denotes the speed of the
wave, leaving v for the speed of the source or detector.
Now suppose that the source starts to move to the right towards the detector. Between
the time that the ﬁrst wave front (sphere) is produced and the second is about to be
produced,3 the source has moved to the right. Since P is the center of the spherical waves,
the center of the second sphere is displaced to the right [Figure 11.10(b)]. Similarly the

source is moving.
third wave front (sphere) has a center displaced to the right of the second sphere’s center,
and so on. Such a displacement of centers squeezes the circles on the right while loosening
them on the left. Thus, the eﬀective wavelength (distance between wave fronts, i.e., spheres)
will be shortened on the right and lengthened on the left. Since the velocity of the wave
is not aﬀected by the motion of the source,4 the frequency, f = c/λ, increases on the right
and decreases on the left.
3Recall that this time is, by deﬁnition, the period of oscillation of the source.
4The velocity depends only on the characteristics of the medium such as temperature, density, pressure,

qualitatively.
Box 11.4.1. The frequency of the wave produced by an approaching source increases
(the wavelength decreases) while that of a receding source decreases (the wavelength
increases).
This is the Doppler eﬀect stated in a qualitative way.
Math Note E.11.2 on page
92 of Appendix.pdf quantiﬁes the statement above, and obtains a formula connecting the
wavelength (or frequency) at the source and at the detector, and Example D.11.2 on
page 33 of Appendix.pdf uses this formula to calculate the frequency change in the siren
of a police car as it approaches and then recedes from you.
When the source moves the wavelength of the wave changes. What about the motion
of the detector? Can it change the wavelength being detected? The ﬁrst question we have
to answer is: In the discussion above, with respect to which observer was the speed v of
the source measured? The obvious answer—the detector—is not satisfactory, because the
detector cannot be considered “at rest.” Why? As we learned in Chapter 6, motion is
relative. So, when we say that “the source is moving but the detector is not,” we have
a particular reference frame (RF) in mind.5 This RF happens to be the medium whose
disturbance constitutes the wave in question. For the wailing police car, it is the air—the
medium of sound waves.

Example D.11.3 on page 34 of Appendix.pdf uses the formula to ﬁnd the frequency shift
when the source is stationary while the detector is moving.
Examples D.11.2 and D.11.3 seem to violate the principle of the relativity of motion:
whether the source is moving or the detector, their relative speed is 170 m/s, yet in one
case the frequency shifts from 450 Hz to 900 Hz, and in the other case, it shifts from 450 Hz
to 675 Hz. This diﬀerence is caused by the assumption of the existence of an “absolute”
reference frame, the medium in which the wave propagates. And this assumption violates
the principle of the relativity of motion, because it grants privilege to a special reference
frame, the RF of the medium.

Chapter 11
Waves
For a long time it was thought that ether was the privileged medium for light waves,
but the theory of relativity tells us that light—as well as all the other electromagnetic
waves, including radar—has no medium! The correct investigation of the Doppler eﬀect of
electromagnetic waves requires the machinery of the special theory of relativity (see Part
VI). However, as far as our present discussion is concerned, when the speed of the source
or the detector is much smaller than the speed of light, nonrelativistic formulas obtained
above apply to light waves as well. Math Notes E.11.3 and E.11.4 illustrate this conclusion.
In fact, when the speed of the source or the detector is small compared to the speed of any
kind of wave, the distinction between the two cases (source moving or the detector moving)
is alleviated, as Example D.11.4 on page 34 of Appendix.pdf illustrates.
Doppler eﬀect gives us a means by which to measure the relative speed of two moving
objects S and A. Suppose that S is equipped with a transmitter and a receiver of radar. It
sends a signal of wavelength λ to A, which reﬂects that signal back to S. The receiver at S
picks up a signal whose wavelength has been Doppler-shifted from λ. This shift is the result
of two Doppler eﬀects: one on the transmitted wave and one on the reﬂected wave. As a
result, we expect a Doppler shift that is twice the usual shift. The details can be found in
Math Note E.11.4 on page 93 of Appendix.pdf .
Police cars equipped with a radar detector can measure the speed of cars using this
double Doppler shift. The radar transmitter in the police car sends a signal; the car in the
front receives this signal but with a diﬀerent wavelength because the source (the police car)
is moving relative to the car; the reﬂected wave, moving towards the police car has a new
wavelength, which gets Doppler shifted again due to the motion of the detector (the police
car). Example D.11.5 on page 34 of Appendix.pdf adds some numerical ﬂavor to the
discussion.
A more dramatic application of the Doppler eﬀect than the impact it has on the pitch of
a sound is in the study of the motion of stars and galaxies. By detecting the change in the
wavelength of characteristic light of elements present in stars and galaxies, astronomers can
easily detect whether a particular star or galaxy is moving away from us or is approaching
us and with what speed. By careful measurements of such Doppler changes, Edwin Hubble,
the American astronomer, was able to conclude, in the late 1920s, that all distant galaxies
were receding from us, thus paving the way for the notion of an expanding universe. (See
Chapter 29 for further detail.)

Use v = λf, to ﬁnd λ = 0.006 m or 0.6 cm. The two holes of the interference are
too far apart compared to the wavelength (50 cm is much much bigger than 0.6 cm) for
interference to take place. The diameter of the aperture, on the other hand, is comparable
with the wavelength. So, diﬀraction does occur.

Electricity
The evolution of electricity and magnetism constitutes one of the most fascinating chapters
in the history of our civilization. What started as a childlike curiosity in the beginning of
the seventeenth century turned into a major scientiﬁc enterprise in the beginning of the
nineteenth century, developed into a dominant theoretical breakthrough in the middle of
the nineteenth century, and put into some curious applications at the turn of the twentieth
century. By the middle of the twentieth century, in combination with the quantum theory,
electromagnetism became the cornerstone—no, the signature—of what we have come to call
civilization. We can safely claim that electromagnetism is at the very foundation of every
single modern technology.
The story of electricity, as many other intellectual developments, begins in a turbid
antiquity. The ﬁrst recorded observations of electric phenomena date back to the ancient

Greeks who attributed the discovery of electricity (and magnetism) to Thales of Miletus
(640?–546 BC). A contemporary of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, Thales traveled ex-
tensively, receiving most of his education in physical sciences from the priests in Memphis
and Thebes in Egypt. He founded the Ionian school of philosophy from which Socrates
came. Thales appears to have been the ﬁrst to observe that amber, when rubbed, was
capable of attracting light objects.
12.1
Modern Electrostatics
At about the same time that Galileo started the systematic study of motion in Italy, the
wind of the Renaissance was ﬂuttering the leaves of the tree of knowledge in other parts
of Europe. The science of electricity and magnetism, the second major branch of physics
after mechanics, started in sixteenth century England in the hands of William Gilbert.
However, unlike the study of motion, which immediately demanded expertise and invention
of a mathematical language, observation of electric and magnetic phenomena did not appear
to require much ﬂuency in mathematics at the beginning. Little wonder that the founder of
modern electricity and magnetism was not a mathematician or a physicist, but a physician.
Gilbert’s methodology of verifying the properties of electricity and magnetism by exper-
imenting was a novel idea equaled only by his younger contemporary Galileo, who greatly
admired Gilbert’s book. However, this methodology was too radical for the “philosophers”
and scholars of the day. And Gilbert showed no restraint in showering his contempt on
them in his book, De Magnete.
Most of De Magnete deals with lodestone and its magnetic properties; however, Gilbert

a cloth it could make chaﬀ, bits of thread, and other light particles jump and stick to it.
This fascinating and almost supernatural property came under Gilbert’s scrutiny. He
soon discovered that it was not just amber that attracted light objects upon rubbing, but
other substances such as rock crystals and some gems exhibited similar properties.
He
was the ﬁrst to clearly diﬀerentiate between magnetic force, which acts only on iron and
related elements, and the electric force which exists among many more substances. He is
also credited with the word “electric,” which he gave to all substances exerting “amber like”
forces on light objects.
BIOGRAPHY
William Gilbert (1544–1603) was born in Colchester, England. After grammar school, William, in 1558,
entered St. John’s College, Cambridge, to study mathematics, and in 1564 he became an examiner in
that subject for the Royal College of Surgeons. His interest then turned to medicine, and he graduated
as a doctor in 1569. Upon receiving MD, he became a senior fellow of the college, where he held several
oﬃces. Gilbert set up a medical practice in London in the 1570s and became a member of the Royal
College of Physicians (the body that regulated the practice of medicine in London and vicinity). He
held a number of oﬃces in the college and in 1600 was elected president. Gilbert, like Copernicus, did
not limit himself to the practice of medicine, and soon found himself immersed in the mysteries and
magic of electricity and magnetism. In 1600, he published the results of his ﬁndings in his great work
De Magnete.
For about sixty years, the ﬁndings of Gilbert on electricity lay dormant. Then in 1660,
the German physicist and burgomaster of Magdeburg, Otto von G¨uricke (1602–1686), con-
structed the ﬁrst electrical machine, in which he employed Gilbert’s idea of “electrifying”

substances by rubbing them. Using this machine, G¨uricke was capable of charging certain
substances indeﬁnitely and creating impressive sparks upon discharging them. G¨uricke’s
machine was pivotal in the study of static electricity in the eighteenth century.
In his attempts to electrify a wide variety of materials, Stephen Gray (1695–1736) dis-

covered that metals cannot be electriﬁed by rubbing. It then occurred to him that electricity
could be transmitted to metals from other electriﬁed objects such as glass. Soon he noticed
that once a piece of metal is charged at one point, electricity appeared at other points of
the metal. Gray’s next challenge was to see how far he can transmit electricity. He chose
longer and longer metallic rods, touched one end of them with electriﬁed objects, and de-
tected electricity at the other end. By 1734 Charles Du Fay (1698–1739) pushed the record

attracts an uncharged body, which after contact repels it, Du Fay also proposed that there
are two kinds of electricity.

and then repel it after contact?

partly ﬁlled with water, containing a metal rod which projected through the neck. It was
found that when the metal rod was connected to an electrical machine, the jar would “hold”
the electricity. The news of this discovery spread rapidly throughout Europe, and within a
short time many replicas of the jar were manufactured by various people. The Leyden jar,
which is still in use, became a convenient device in which to store electricity.
The word of the jar soon crossed the Atlantic Ocean and reached the shores of the
American Continent. Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790), the American statesman and scien-

tist, while toying with the Leyden jar, noticed a striking resemblance of the sparks and
crackles of the jar to lightning and thunder. He thus came up with the conjecture that
lightning is nothing but electrical discharges between the clouds and the Earth, and to

prove his conjecture, he performed his famous experiment in which he ﬂew a kite in stormy
weather and noticed—quite painfully!—that electricity was carried from the tip of the kite
to his hand.
As the end of the eighteenth century approached, enough experiments had been done
on static electricity to render the question of the law of electrical forces relevant.
BIOGRAPHY
Charles Augustine de Coulomb (1736–1806) was born into an inﬂuential and wealthy family. After a
solid training in language, literature, philosophy, mathematics, and science, Coulomb became interested
in mathematics and astronomy. At the age of twenty, having had many arguments with his mother in
Paris over his future career, Coulomb joined his father in Montpellier, where he became a member of the
Society of Sciences. His interest in science drove him into a career in engineering in the French army,
serving in the West Indies. When several bouts of fever forced his return to France, he began a lifetime
of broad-ranging investigations in mechanics, electricity, and magnetism. As part of his investigations,
he experimented with the twisting characteristics of various ﬁbers under tension. This observation led
Coulomb to the construction of a very sensitive instrument called the torsion balance, which he used
to discover the mathematical law of the force of static electricity.
After a long series of experiments in electricity with the torsion balance, Coulomb, in
1785, discovered that the electrical force obeys a law similar to the gravitational force
discovered over a century earlier by Isaac Newton [see Equation (9.1)]. The Coulomb’s
law states that the force F between two point charges of magnitudes q1 and q2 situated a
distance r apart is given by
Coulomb’s law.
F = keq1q2

(12.1)
where ke is a proportionality constant whose value, in the system of units we are using, is

Unit of electric charge is
Coulomb (C).
which can be deﬁned as the amount of charge which exerts a force of 8.988 × 109 N on an
equal charge when their distance is 1 m.
Although the laws of electrostatic and gravitational forces look alike, there is a vast
diﬀerence between the two. First, gravitation is always attractive, while electrical force can
be both attractive and repulsive: like charges repel, unlike charges attract. Secondly, the
strength of the two forces are incomparably diﬀerent as the following example shows.
What do you know? 12.2. On a planet, a charged ball has a diﬀerent acceleration
than a neutral ball. What can be the reason?
Example 12.1.1. An electron has a mass of 9.1 × 10−31 kg and a negative electric charge of
magnitude 1.6 × 10−19 Coulomb. Let us compare the strength of the gravitational and electrical
forces between two electrons separated by 1 meter.
The force of gravity is attractive, but the
electrical force is repulsive. Do the two electrons attract or repel one another?
Recall that the gravitational force is given by Fg = Gm1m2/r2.
Therefore, with r = 1,
G = 6.67 × 10−11, m1 and m2 each equal to 9.1 × 10−31 kg, we get Fg = 5.52 × 10−71 N. On the

other hand, with ke = 9 × 109, each charge equal to 1.6 × 10−19 C, and r = 1, the electrostatic
force, Fe = keq1q2/r2, yields Fe = 2.3 × 10−28 N. The ratio of Fe to Fg is 4.17 × 1042.
Thus, the electric force is approximately 42 orders of magnitude larger than the gravitational
force. To see the enormity of this ratio, suppose that we represent the gravitational force by an
arrow as long as a bacterium. How long would the length of the electric arrow be? Much larger

than the height of a man; much taller than the Empire State Building; much larger than the Earth
itself; much larger than the solar system; and much larger than the Milky Way. In fact, the electric
arrow would be over 10 billion times larger than the “size” of the visible universe! That is why,
when electrical forces are present, gravitational forces can be completely ignored.

Coulomb’s law is an action-at-a-distance law possessing all the disadvantages of such laws.
To remedy its shortcomings, let’s introduce the concept of the electric ﬁeld, which is very
similar in concept to the gravitational ﬁeld discussed in Section 9.2: If an electric charge
(usually called a test charge in this context) feels an electric force (because of its charge)
in a region of space, we say that an electric ﬁeld is present in that region. The stronger
the force, the more intense the electric ﬁeld. More precisely, if Fe is the electric force acting
on a charge q at some point, then the electric ﬁeld E at that point is
Electric ﬁeld deﬁned.
E = Fe
q
⇒
Fe = qE.
(12.2)
This suggests that the unit of electric ﬁeld is Newton per Coulomb or N/C. Electric ﬁeld
is thus simply the electric force per unit electric charge, and the connection between the
ﬁeld and the force concept is evident in this equation.
Box 12.2.1. Equation (12.2) shows that the electric force Fe has the same direction as
the electric ﬁeld E when q is positive and the opposite direction when q is negative.
The source of the electrostatic ﬁeld is, of course, the electric charge, just as the source
of the gravitational ﬁeld is mass. The detection of an electric ﬁeld implies the existence of
an electric charge somewhere. The farther you are removed from the source of the electric
ﬁeld, the weaker the magnitude of that ﬁeld. This is shown quantitatively in Example
D.12.1 on page 35 of Appendix.pdf .
Food for Thought
FFT 12.2.2. As valuable as Gilbert’s observations were in promoting electricity and magnetism to

explanation of electricity
and magnetism.
the level of a science, his explanations of the phenomena bordered on the occult and mysticism. He
speaks of electricity as materia and of magnetism as forma. He continues, “Electrical movements
come from the materia, but magnetic from the prima forma; and these two diﬀer widely from
each other and become unlike, the one (magnetics) ennobled by many virtues, and prepotent; the
other (electrics) lowly, of less potency, wherefore its nature has to be awakened by friction til the
substance attains a moderated heat, and gives out an eﬄuvium, and its surface is made to shine.”
This semi-spiritual characterization of magnetics as “noble” and electrics as “lowly” is hardly
scientiﬁc by today’s standards.
However, one has to realize that Gilbert’s time was a time of
transition from superstition to reason. Many great astronomers, including Copernicus and Kepler,
believed in a connection between heaven and earthly happenings as today’s psychics do. So Gilbert’s
“explanation” of the diﬀerence between magnetism and electricity should not be held against him.
Moreover, as we shall see later, the electric and magnetic phenomena, with which Gilbert dealt,
proved to be much more diﬃcult to analyze scientiﬁcally and mathematically than motion, whose
scientiﬁc analysis started at about the same time.
Today, we value Gilbert’s work, and ennoble it by qualifying it as “scientiﬁc.” Now imagine
a hypothetical “scientist,” who at about the same time, created the “science” of magnetozoology.
This would be a man who would make many “systematic observations” of the magnetism “released”
by hundreds of animals. He would write dozens of papers on the nature of animal magnetism, and
publish several books on the subject. Why do we not call this man a scientist?
Although Gilbert’s study of electricity and magnetism was not unlike our hypothetical magne-

tozoologist’s study of animal magnetism, Gilbert’s work was followed up by other physicists such as
G¨uricke, who used Gilbert’s discoveries to build his electricity machine; Gray, whose discovery of
conductors was crucially based on the work of Gilbert and G¨uricke; Kleist, who combined G¨uricke’s
and Gray’s discoveries to create a jar that was capable of storing electricity for a long time; and
Coulomb, who used Kleist’s jar in his monumental work that led to the mathematical expression of

the electric force. And the process did not stop with Coulomb. Every generation of physicists owes
its success to the knowledge it inherits from the previous generation. This is one characteristic of
science that should be remembered at all times: Science is a ladder whose upper rungs are
crucially attached to its lower rungs.
Four hundred years after Gilbert, we now know why the act of rubbing produces electricity: the
elemental particles we call electrons get transferred from one object to the next, electrifying both.
Gilbert was not aware of this, but his observations were the start of our modern understanding.
On the other hand, our hypothetical magnetozoologist could not have laid the foundation of a
new science, because animal magnetism was not (is not) the right material to study in a scientiﬁc
investigation, and therefore, no scientist would have followed up on his investigations.1
The lesson to learn is that no amount of “systematic observation,” no amount of emphasis
by using the word “science,” no amount of persuasion by gluing the suﬃx “-ology” or “-ics” to a
discipline makes it a science. Science is no invention of one man or a group declaring the birth of a
new “scientiﬁc discipline” after a conference. Science is as old as the human race itself. There is a
continuous line that connects Einstein’s general theory of relativity and the science of genetics to
the discovery of ﬁre 700,000 years ago. Beware of people who speak of “The New Science of . . . .”
They are trying to break the line and artiﬁcially insert their discipline in the historical continuum.

or lines of force. The direction of the electric ﬁeld at any point through which a ﬁeld line
passes is along the tangent to the curve at that point. For example, the arrows EP and EQ
in Figure 12.1 represent the electric ﬁelds at points P and Q. The ﬁeld at other points can
be drawn similarly. These arrows show the direction in which a positive test charge would
experience a force when placed in the given electric ﬁeld.
In regions where the lines are more crowded together, the ﬁeld is assumed to be stronger.
Strength of electric ﬁeld
is related to the density
of ﬁeld lines.
Thus, the positive charge will experience a greater force to the left in Figure 12.1 when
placed in region 2 than in region 1 or 3. That is why EQ is drawn longer than EP . The
sources producing the ﬁeld are not shown in Figure 12.1, and most of the time they are not

The ﬁeld lines in (d) are uniform except close to the edges of the charge distributions. This

The lines drawn in a typical representation of an electric ﬁeld are only sample lines.
Bear in mind that between any two neighboring lines there are (inﬁnitely) many lines
whose directions are intermediate between the two given lines. Figure 12.1(b) shows the

Electric Potential
Chapters 7 and 9 introduced the notion of the potential energy PE for the gravitational
ﬁeld of the Earth and other celestial bodies, and indicated that the higher an object is,
the more PE it has. The natural tendency is for the object to move from a state of higher

deﬁned.
PE to that of a lower PE. The same considerations apply to electric ﬁelds. An electric
potential energy is deﬁned as the energy stored when an electric charge is moved from
one point to another in an electric ﬁeld.
Consider Figure 12.1 again, and assume that a positive charge is moved from P1 to P2
along the ﬁeld line connecting these two points. Since the direction of the ﬁeld is from P2 to
P1, the electric force will be in the same direction. To push the charge from P1 to P2, you
have to provide it with a mechanical force directed from P1 to P2. Since the displacement
and the mechanical force are in the same direction, the work done by this force is positive.
This positive work is stored as the excess of electrical potential energy (EPE) at P2 over
that at P1. We thus say that P2 is at a higher electrical potential energy than P1. A positive

Section 12.3
Electric Potential
181
charge released at P2 has a natural tendency to move towards P1. Thus, in general, motion
of positive charges take place from a region of high EPE to a region of low EPE.
The preceding discussion illustrates a speciﬁc instance of a general consideration. It
turns out that P1 and P2 need not be on the same ﬁeld line, and the work necessary
to move the charge from P1 to P2 is independent of the path connecting the two points.
Therefore, the EPE depends only on the points and not on how they are connected. If
EPE1 and EPE2 denote the electric potential energies of a positive charge q at P1 and P2,
respectively, then EPE2 −EPE1 is the work done by an external force to move q (slowly)
from P1 to P2 irrespective of the path taken.
As in gravity (Section 9.2), we can introduce the notion of the potential. In fact, electric
potential, denoted by V , is far more useful than its gravitational counterpart.2 The electric
potential diﬀerence between two points is the work required to move one Coulomb of electric
charge from one point to the next. Equivalently, it is the diﬀerence between EPE at the
two points divided by the displaced charge. Thus if V2 is the electric potential at P2 and
V1 that at P1, then

or
EPE2 −EPE1 = q(V2 −V1).
(12.3)
The concept of electric potential is useful because it does not depend on the charge. It only
depends on the strength of the electric ﬁeld between the two points. In fact Math Note
E.12.1 on page 95 of Appendix.pdf shows that the electric potential diﬀerence between
two (nearby) points is the electric ﬁeld times the distance between the two points. The same
Math Note also shows that the electric ﬁeld points from a region of high electric potential
to a region of low potential. Hence,
Box 12.3.1. Positive charges move from high potential regions to low potential regions,
while negative charges move in the opposite direction.
What do you know? 12.4. Do you have to do positive or negative work to move a
negative charge from a low potential region to a high potential region?
The unit of the electric potential is Joules per Coulomb, which is renamed volt to honor

the Italian physicist Volta for his contribution to the development of electricity. In addition
to N/C, electric ﬁeld has a unit derived from Equation (E.14) of Math Note E.12.1. Since
electric ﬁeld can be written as potential diﬀerence divided by distance, its unit can also be
volt per meter.
By the deﬁnition of the potential diﬀerence, a positive charge q loses q(V2 −V1) units
of EPE when it goes from P2, with higher potential V2, to P1, with lower potential V1.
Conservation of energy then implies that q acquires the same amount of kinetic energy.
The same consideration applies to a negative charge moving from P1 to P2.

energy gained by an electron when it moves in a potential diﬀerence of one volt. Electron itself
has a negative charge qe = −1.6 × 10−19. To deﬁne eV, consider a particle (such as proton) which
has a charge of +1.6 × 10−19. Electron volt is then the KE gained by such a positive charge as its
potential drops by one volt.
Q: What is the kinetic energy in eV gained by +1 Coulomb of charge when it moves through
a potential diﬀerence of one volt?

A: The charge of 1 Coulomb is 1/1.6 × 10−19 = 6.25 × 1018 times that of a proton. Thus, the
energy gained by 1 Coulomb is 6.25×1018 times the energy gained by a proton. Since the latter is,
by deﬁnition, one eV, we conclude that the kinetic energy gained by 1 Coulomb of charge in going
through a potential diﬀerence of 1 Volt is 6.25 × 1018 eV.
On the other hand, Equation (12.3) indicates that the product of potential diﬀerence in volts
and charge in Coulombs is simply energy in Joules. We thus have the conversion relations
1 Joule = 6.25 × 1018 eV
or
1 eV = 1.6 × 10−19 Joule.

Electron volt, due to its smallness, is a convenient unit for atomic and subatomic phenomena.

Example 12.3.3. In a certain region of space the electric ﬁeld lines are as shown in Figure 12.3.
If you introduce a charge of +1 Coulomb at point P1, the force will be in the same direction as the
ﬁeld, i.e., tangent to the ﬁeld lines and pointing in the direction determined by the arrows on the
lines. Let us represent it as an arrow shown in the ﬁgure; it points approximately in the southwest
direction. If the charge is released, it will accelerate in that direction immediately after release.3
Now introduce a charge of −1 Coulomb at P2. The electric ﬁeld points to the left (west) there.
Therefore, the force will point to the right (east). Why is the arrow longer at P2? Because the
ﬁeld lines are more crowded there, indicating that the electric ﬁeld is stronger.
What if you introduce a charge of +1 Coulomb at P3? Is the force zero there because no electric
ﬁeld lines are shown to pass through P3? No! Remember that we can aﬀord to draw only a ﬁnite
sample of the ﬁeld lines. Between any two ﬁeld lines at any point in space, there pass inﬁnitely
many other ﬁeld lines, whose directions lie somewhere between the directions of the two original
lines. So, the ﬁeld line passing through P3 must point a little north of west, and the force will be
in the same direction as shown.

Galvani and his laboratory assistants dissected and prepared a frog on a table on which
there was an electrical machine. Quite accidentally, one of his assistants noticed that at
the precise time that a spark was coming from the electrical machine, the muscles of the
frog’s limb were suddenly and violently convulsed. Galvani repeated the experiment many

times, including some trials with the weather electricity, and each time the convulsions were
inevitable. But it was another accidental observation that determined the future direction
of research in electricity.
BIOGRAPHY
Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) wanted to study theology and enter a monastic order. His family, however,
persuaded him to abandon that idea. Galvani eventually gained notoriety as a gifted scholar of medicine,
and at age 25 became a Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna. As a skillful and diligent
experimenter, and in keeping with the science of his time, he developed a keen interest in electricity
and employed a variety of newly discovered electrical machines and the Leyden Jar to produce and store
electricity. Galvani applied this electricity to dissected frog legs—which were popular and convenient
specimens for investigation—to study muscular and nerve activity.
During his experimental trials with frog legs, Galvani noticed that frogs that were sus-
pended by brass hooks through marrow, and which rested against an iron trellis, showed
occasional convulsions with no active electrical machine around and no lightning in the
atmosphere. In adjusting the specimens, he pressed the brass hook against the trellis by
chance, and saw the familiar muscle jerk. He repeated the experiment and noticed that
each time he completed the metallic contact between the brass hook and the iron trellis,
the twitching of the muscle occurred.
In another similar experience, he noticed that when the specimen laid on an iron plate
and he touched the brass hook in the spinal marrow against the plate, the convulsion took
place. Galvani now recognized that a new principle was at work, and he decided to unravel
the phenomena responsible for it. He replaced the iron plate with glass plate; the twitching
did not occur. Using a silver plate restored the convulsion. He then joined equal lengths of
two diﬀerent metals and bent them into an arc. On touching the tips of the bimetallic arc
to the frog specimen the reaction returned. He paired diﬀerent metals into arcs and noted
that the intensity of the twitching diﬀered for diﬀerent metallic pairs.
Galvani was now faced with the challenge of explaining the two kinds of convulsion he
had observed in frog specimens: one coming from the sparks of electrical machines, and
the other coming from the contact of dissimilar metals. The second kind of convulsion was
especially puzzling: Did the electricity responsible for the convulsion reside in the anatomy
of the specimen with the metals serving to release it, or was the eﬀect produced by the
bimetallic contacts, with the specimen serving as an indicator?
Being an anatomist, Galvani had a propensity toward living tissue, driving him to
believe that the twitching of the muscle tissue was caused by “animal electricity.” He took
his discovery as one in physiology, and compared the body as a Leyden jar, in which the
various tissues developed opposite electrical charges. In this, he was following the tradition
of his day which ascribed the body motivation to a ﬂow of “spirits” residing in the various
body parts. This pseudoscientiﬁc “explanation” was soon to be undermined by another
Italian, Alessandro Volta.
Volta is credited with inventing several important devices, including the electrometer,
which is capable of measuring very minute electrical eﬀects. Using these devices, he became
a pioneer of the new science of electricity, and being an Italian, he was bound to come
across the discovery of his fellow countryman, Galvani. Upon repeating and conﬁrming
Galvani’s experiment, Volta also accepted “animal electricity” as the cause of the muscular
convulsions. Both ascribed the activity of the muscle to an imbalance between the muscle
and nerve electricity, which was restored to equilibrium when a metallic connection was
made.
On continuing his investigations, however, Volta began to question the imbalance theory.
He found in his experiments that the muscle would convulse when only the nerve was in
the electrical circuit. Replicating the experiments of an earlier investigator, Volta placed
a piece of tinfoil on the tip of his tongue and a silver coin at the rear of his tongue, and

184
Chapter 12
Electricity
connecting the two with a piece of copper wire, he got a sour taste. Substituting a silver
spoon for the coin, removing the copper wire, and connecting the spoon directly to the
tinfoil, he got the same sensation. In another experiment, he connected his tongue to his
forehead using dissimilar metals, and he got a sensation of light. All these eﬀects would
go away if the connections were made with a single metal. From these experiments, Volta
concluded that
Box 12.4.1. The dissimilar conductors did not act merely as agents for transferring
electricity, but were actually the source of electricity.
By 1794 Volta had made a complete break from Galvani and the theory of animal elec-
tricity, and proposed the theory of “metallic electricity.” To do away with the “animal elec-

animal electricity.
tricity,” Volta completely discarded the muscles and the nerves. In one of his experiments,
he connected the two ends of the dissimilar metal to the two plates of his electrometer, and
noticed the presence of electricity. No tissues were involved! Volta proceeded to test many
metallic pairs and noted that the strength of the electricity varied considerably for diﬀerent
pairs. One important discovery along these lines was that the moisture of his hands con-
siderably enhanced the strength of the electricity produced. Further investigation led Volta
to add liquids such as brine and dilute acids in his conducting system.
BIOGRAPHY
Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) was very slow in learning as a child, so much so that his parents
thought that he was mute.
However, by age seven he turned into a bright student of exceptional
promise. Within a few years, Volta had obtained an excellent classical education, and found himself
under pressure from relatives to enter the priesthood. But, encouraged by an old friend who provided
him with some experimental equipment, Volta decided to become a physicist.
He quickly took an
interest in the magical science of the time, electricity. His passion for electricity was so great that he
wrote a poem in Latin on the subject. One of the greatest experimental physicists of all time, Volta
invented electrophorous, studied the eﬀect of sparks on the ignition of gases, discovered methane, and
developed the voltaic pile, the precursor to modern batteries.
Volta discovered that in a circuit composed entirely of pairs of dissimilar metals, there
was only a momentary movement of electricity. However, when he put two dissimilar metals
in contact with a separator soaked with a saline or an acidiﬁed solution, he noticed a steady
supply of electricity. Volta had accomplished the most decisive and practical discovery of
Volta invents the
battery.
his career: He had invented an electric battery.
What is the basic principle behind the operation of batteries? Charges, as all other
objects, obey the laws of motion: They move in a wire because there are net forces acting
on them. These forces are simply electric forces caused by various accumulation of charges
in the batteries, producing electric ﬁelds in the wires, which in turn “push” the charges
inside the wire, causing the ﬂow of an electric current. If there were no forces to oppose
the motion of the charges, not only would the charges move on their own, but they would
even acquire acceleration, and there would be no need for a battery to “help” them along.
However, just as a car moving on a highway is dragged by the ambient air, the charges
moving in a wire are constantly dragged by microscopic objects. And just as the car needs
a constant supply of force to keep it from slowing down and stopping, so do the charges in
the wire need a constant supply of electric ﬁeld to keep them from stopping. The presence

of an electric ﬁeld in a wire indicates an electric potential diﬀerence [see Equation (E.14)
of Math Note E.12.1]. Therefore,

Box 12.4.2. Batteries are devices which create electric ﬁeld in—or potential diﬀerence
between the two ends of—a wire.
What do you know?
12.6. Earlier, we said that no electric ﬁeld can exist in a
conductor. How do you reconcile that statement with the one in Box 12.4.2?
A typical battery has two poles, positive and negative, and it can drive the charges
only if these poles are connected by a conductor of electricity such as a metal. When we
connect the two poles of a battery, we say that we have a complete electrical circuit.
The carriers of electricity (negative electrons) are pushed away from the negative pole into
the conducting wire, where under the inﬂuence of the ﬁeld they are moved to the positive
pole. To keep the electric current going, the battery now has to take the charge and put
it on the negative pole. This is done internally by various chemical reactions. The ability
Electromotive force or
emf.
of a battery to move the carriers from the attractive pole to the repulsive pole is measured
by electromotive force (emf), which is denoted by E, and has the same unit as electric
potential, i.e., volt.4 To remove the carrier of charge q from the attractive pole (where it
wants to remain) to the repulsive pole, the battery does qE Joules of work. So, one can
say that E is the potential diﬀerence between the two poles of a battery that a carrier must
overcome in order to continue its periodic journey through the circuit.
A battery is in many respects like a water pump. The pump takes water from under-
ground, lifts it up to the surface by the expenditure of some energy (mechanical, electrical,
or chemical), and releases it on the ground.
The ground water then seeps through the
ground layers and ends up underground, completing the water “circuit.” Both electric and
water ﬂow need a source of energy (battery or pump).
Escher was a Dutch graphic artist whose interest in mathematics inﬂuenced his ingenious
drawings of impossible constructions. One such construction (shown in the ﬁgure in the
margin) deﬁes energy conservation and the need for a pump to raise water to a height.
Such a situation, of course, never occurs in nature. It, however, does occur in the greed of
hoaxers and fraudulent entrepreneurs claiming the invention of machines that need no fuel.
The electric current is the eﬀective motion of positive charges in a conductor from the
higher potential at one end to the lower potential at the other end of the conductor. This
requires some explanation. Historically, the founders of the science of electricity, when faced
with the necessity to deﬁne concepts or make conventions, did so in terms of positive charges.
Thus, for instance, electric current was deﬁned in terms of the motion of positive charges.
However, by the end of the nineteenth century it became clear that the particles whose
motion gave rise to electric currents were negatively charged. Furthermore (as we noted
earlier), positive charges move from high to low potential, and negative charges from low
to high. This positive-negative and high-low potential asymmetry may appear as double
jeopardy. In reality, however, they work to cancel each other as the following argument
shows.
Food for Thought
FFT 12.4.3. The use of batteries in modern society is as common as the consumption of food.
Every appliance, large or small, uses batteries. Many inventors have become billionaires because
of the existence of batteries. Yet, Volta, as staunch an experimental physicist as he was, showed
no interest in his battery’s entrepreneurial “potential,”5 and that is what set him apart from an
inventor.
4This is the voltage of the battery you buy at your local electronic store.
5No pun intended!

186
Chapter 12
Electricity
An inventor’s main concern is the mass production of a product for human consumption.
Therefore, his entire enterprise is focused on the ease of the utility of the product and the persuasion
of the public to buy it. In fact, in modern consumer societies, the invention itself takes a back seat
while its marketing becomes the center of attention. History is full of good inventions that never
made it, because they were not advertised aggressively enough, and useless inventions that are
found in every household because we see them on the screen every time we turn on our television
set, and hear about them every time we listen to our radio.
While an inventor asks “What is the best way to make this gadget useful and popular?”, an
experimental physicist asks “What is the best way to understand how and why this gadget works?”
The same diﬀerence
that exists between
science and technology
exists between an
experimentalist and an
inventor.
The experimentalist pays absolutely no attention to the look and utility of his gadget, the two most
important factors that drive an inventor. A successful inventor has to be a businessman, a politician,
and a very clever salesman.
A successful experimentalist has to be a devoted experimentalist
[although, nowadays the procurement of research funds demands some element of political savvy in
the experimentalist]. In short, an inventor is a technician, in the sense that he/she takes advantage
of technology, while an experimentalist is a scientist.

Figure 12.4: Negative charges moving in one direction is equivalent to positive charges moving in the
opposite direction.
Figure 12.4 shows some ﬁxed positive charges with respect to which some negative
charges are moving to the left. Imagine that the negative charges proceed to the left by
hopping from one site to the next. Thus in the ﬁrst frame F1 of the ﬁgure there is a positive
vacant spot to the left. In F2, this empty spot has been occupied by a negative charge and
a vacant spot is created to the right of this negative charge. Every time a negative charge
hops, it creates a vacant positive charge behind it. This positive vacant spot keeps moving
to the right as the negative charge hops to the left. To an observer capable of measuring only
the electric charge and not the motion of the individual particles, the process appears as a
motion of the positive charge to the right. We, therefore, see that the two interpretations
of the electric current—negative charges to the left or positive charges to the right—are
completely equivalent.
By convention, the latter interpretation is accepted although in
reality the former is true.
What has been loosely called electric current has a precise meaning:
Electric current and its
unit amp.
Box 12.4.4. Electric current is the amount of charge that passes through a given
area (the cross section of a wire) in one second. In symbols, i = q/t, where i is the
current and q is the charge passing through the cross section of the wire in time t.
The unit of current is Coulomb per second, which is called ampere, or amp for short.

Section 12.5
Electric Power Transmission
187
Batteries produce fairly steady electric currents, i.e., the amperage does not ﬂuctuate
appreciably. Such currents are called direct currents (DC for short). There are other
Direct current (DC) and
alternating current (AC).
sources of currents, discussed in the sequel, which produce alternating currents (AC for
short). Such currents are time-dependent, and in most cases change directions regularly
with a speciﬁed frequency, 60 Hz in the US and 50 Hz in Europe.
12.5
Electric Power Transmission
Batteries supply energy to the moving charges in a circuit continuously. It is therefore more
natural to talk about power, which is energy supplied per unit time. Math Note E.12.2
on page 95 of Appendix.pdf shows that
Box 12.5.1. The power supplied by a battery (its wattage) is the product of the current
in the circuit and the voltage of the battery.
As a charge moves in a wire from a higher potential to a lower potential, it loses energy
according to Equation (12.3). What happens to the energy lost by the carriers? If you bring
your hand close to the wire you may note where the energy goes: it turns into heat. This
heat is due to the drag forces operating inside the wire as mentioned earlier. The production
of heat is inevitable whenever drag forces (e.g., friction) are present. The electrical drag in
the wire is called resistance and is denoted by R. The German physicist, George Simon
Resistance of a wire.
Ohm, showed in 1826 that there is a simple formula connecting the potential drop V , the
current i, and the resistance R of a wire. This relation, which is now known as Ohm’s law
is
V = Ri.
(12.5)
Because of Ohm’s contributions to electric circuitry, the unit of resistance is called ohm
and denoted by Ω.
Example 12.5.2. A resistance of 100 Ωis connected to a 9-volt battery. What is the current in
the circuit?
Because the two ends of the resistance are connected to the two poles of the battery, the voltage
drop from one end to the other is the same as the voltage of the battery.6 So, V = 9 volts. Equation
(12.5) can now give the current: 9 = 100i, or i = 0.09 amps.
With the current and the voltage at our disposal, we can use Equation (E.16) (which says
that power is the product of current and voltage) to ﬁnd the heat power loss in the resistance:
P = 0.09 × 9 = 0.81 Watt.
■
The power loss in a resistor can be written in terms of its resistance and the current
it carries. The result is that power loss increases as the square of the current. This has
a very practical signiﬁcance: If you cut the current in half, the power loss decreases by a
factor of four. So, it pays tremendously in electricity transmission from power generators
to consumers to reduce the current in the transmission lines as much as possible.
Power plants are “batteries” that have constant power (rather than constant voltage)
outputs. The operators of the plant can vary the voltage (electromotive force, emf)—and
with it, the current. Since power is the product of voltage and current, increasing the voltage
decreases the current and vice versa. See Example D.12.2 on page 35 of Appendix.pdf
for a typical situation.
Example D.12.2 shows that reducing the current output of a plant can reduce the power
loss in the transmission lines considerably. Of course, reducing the resistance of the wires
6Remember that potential diﬀerence is independent of the path. So whether you go from the positive
pole to the negative pole inside the wire or inside the battery, you obtain the same potential diﬀerence.

188
Chapter 12
Electricity
can reduce the loss as well, and this is taken advantage of in electrical industry. However,
there is a limit to the reduction of the resistance.
The most common way of reducing
resistance is by increasing the diameter of the transmission lines. But this increases the
weight as well as the cost of the cables. Reduction of the current has its disadvantages as
well. This reduction takes place at the cost of increasing the voltage to very high levels.
Consumers, on the other hand, demand a much lower voltage for their appliances. Although
there are ways of reducing the voltage to a manageable level at the consumption site, it
does put certain limitations on how low the current can be.

Answers to “What do you know?”
12.1.
When you bring a charged body near an uncharged body, the opposite charges of
the latter move towards the former. This proximity of the opposite charges results in an
attraction. Upon contact, some of the charge of the charged body moves into the uncharged
body, making the net charge of both bodies of the same sign; thus repulsion.
12.2. The planet has a net electric charge.
12.3. An isolated charge has electric ﬁeld lines all around it. No matter what you do with
the rest of the charges in a conductor, you cannot get rid of the electric ﬁeld of an isolated
charge. Since the conductor cannot tolerate any electric ﬁeld inside, the charge cannot stay
inside. It moves on the surface and rearranges itself in such a way as to make the ﬁeld
inside (but not outside) zero.
12.4.
Electric ﬁeld points from a high potential to a low potential.
The force on the
negative charge is opposite to that, i.e., it points from low potential to high potential. So,
the charge wants to move from low to high potential on its own. The force you exert is
opposite to this force. So, as you hold the charge, the displacement of your force is opposite
to the direction of your force. So, you are doing negative work.
12.5. The electric ﬁeld is to the left. So, the force must be to the right. The length of the
arrow is determined by the strength of the ﬁeld, which is smaller than the ﬁeld at P1.
12.6.
The earlier statement was about electrostatic ﬁelds. No charges were moving, and
if there was a motion, it was extremely rapid, lasting a tiny fraction of a second while the
charges were rearranging themselves to ensure a zero ﬁeld inside. Now the battery disrupts
this rearrangement and keeps pushing the charges in the conductor.

Magnetism and Electricity
Among the rather widespread and fairly abundant minerals found on Earth is a crystalline
mineral ore of iron called magnetite, which, unlike any other iron ore, is magnetic. Occasion-
ally, pieces of this ore, called lodestones, are found which are permanently magnetized.
Some specimens have been known to have such a strong magnetization as to lift several
times their weight. There is good reason to believe that the attractive power of lodestone
has been known to mankind as early as 5000 years ago. It is said that Huang-ti, “an em-
peror of China in the year 2637 BC, had a chariot, upon which was mounted the ﬁgure of a
woman, pivoted or suspended so that it was free to turn in any direction. The outstretched
arm of the statue always pointed to the south under the inﬂuence of concealed lodestones”
[Mey 71, p. 2].
The ﬁrst person to study the magnetic properties of lodestones in the west appears to
have been Thales, who was also the ﬁrst person to note the electrical properties of amber.
He experimented with lodestone and knew that it attracted iron. Thales did not write any
books. What we know of him was transmitted orally until Aristotle recorded his teachings.
13.1
The Compass and the Lodestone
The era of modern magnetism, like other scientiﬁc endeavors, begins with the Renaissance.
In 1269 Petrus Peregrinus, a soldier in the French army—and Roger Bacon’s teacher—wrote
a letter to one of his friends in which he described the details of the construction of a ﬂoating
compass as well as a pivoted compass employing a steel needle.
The magnetic compass was the ﬁrst practical device that arose from the study of mag-
netism. After the time of Petrus Peregrinus the compass soon came into general use, which
in turn led to the serious study of magnetism. The ﬁrst deﬁnitive work in which a detailed
investigation of magnetism took place was De Magnete by William Gilbert, about which you
have already learned in Section 12.1. By Gilbert’s time the use of compass for navigation
was much developed, and some of its basic properties were already known. For instance,
the downward inclination of the needle of a compass in London led to the belief that there
was a magnetic body inside the Earth.
Gilbert’s investigation of lodestone led him to propose that the Earth itself was a huge
magnet with north and south poles in close proximity of the opposite geographic poles
(Figure 13.1). He showed by many experiments that all magnetic bodies were “regulated
by the Earth.”
As a result, he concluded that lodestone was an iron ore directionally

magnetized by the Earth when it lay along a meridian. Experimenting with a model of
Earth he built himself, Gilbert explained why compass needles are parallel to the Earth
surface at the equator, but bend downward in the northern hemisphere. And he attributed

the motion and inclination of the compass needle entirely to the Earth magnetism.
Gilbert’s diverse experiments with the lodestone led to some very useful discoveries such
as the increase in intensity of the lodestone when capped by iron, and to some fundamental
properties such as the fact that

Gilbert proposed to catalog the declination and direction of the compass needle for
various location as an aid to navigation, based on the belief that the two magnetic poles of
the Earth are stationary. Hopes for this scheme faded with the discovery that, although the

continents and the oceans are ﬁxed on Earth, the magnetic poles drift unpredictably from
year to year.
13.2
Magnetism from Electricity
Gilbert’s painstaking experimentation of lodestone, although revealing in many respects,
left one question unanswered: What is the source of magnetism? Unlike electrical forces
which are caused by the electric charges, magnetic forces cannot be caused by magnetic
charges, because—as demonstrated by Gilbert himself—magnetic charges do not exist in
nature. The answer to this riddle had to wait for an “accidental” discovery.
The professor called on his class to gather around his laboratory table to show them the
fascinating phenomena related to the electric current. In particular, he wanted them to see
how the electric current from a battery could make a wire red hot, even melt it. He waved
at his assistant signaling the connection of the battery. The assistant followed the motion,

and all eyes were turned to the wire. All except the professor’s. Something else caught his
attention. Leaning forward, he gazed in amazement at the needle of a magnetic compass
that happened to be close to the wire. The idle compass pointing lazily to the north had
suddenly come to life, starting to swing strongly. To what was the compass responding?
At this point the professor completely forgot about the class, the lecture, and the stu-
dents. He was on the verge of one of the most important discoveries of history. As the
students watched their professor in bewilderment, he signaled to his assistant to disconnect
the battery. To his delightful surprise, the needle went back to its original north-south

position. He signaled the assistant to connect and disconnect the battery several times; and
every time a current was established in the wire, the needle moved away from its normal
position. The professor eventually turned to the class. They had witnessed their professor,
Hans Christian ¨Orsted (1777–1851), stumble on one of the oldest secrets of nature right on
their campus at the University of Copenhagen: That electric currents can produce magnetic
forces.
BIOGRAPHY
Hans Christian ¨Orsted (1777–1851) was born in a small Danish town into a family that could not
aﬀord his education. It was the generosity of the townspeople that helped Hans and his brother Anders
get an education. The boys were eager learners and made it a habit to read every book they could lay
their hands on. ¨Orsted followed his interest in science—an interest that was sparked when he helped
his father, the village apothecary. He became especially interested in Volta’s electric pile, and while
still at the university, had resolved that experimentation with voltaic current would be a major ﬁeld of
interest. It was the pursuit of this interest that ﬁnally led to ¨Orsted’s discovery of electrical magnetism.
Because of his background in his father’s pharmacy, ¨Orsted had an interest in chemistry as well. The
production of aluminum is attributed to him.
On July 21, 1820 ¨Orsted privately printed a 4-page pamphlet describing his discovery.
July 21, 1820 marks the
beginning of modern
magnetism.
Published in Latin, the universal language of science at the time, ¨Orsted sent copies of the
pamphlet to eminent scientists and learned societies of Europe. The announcement was
so important that, within a few weeks, the paper was translated and reprinted in English,
German, French, Italian, and Dutch.
Although the discovery of the connection between electricity and magnetism appears to
be accidental (and admittedly some unplanned incidents were crucial in the discovery), the

hard work, diligence, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge of the discoverer cannot be
neglected. We do not call the discovery of a gold mine by a gold digger who has spent all
his life looking for gold “an accident.” Granted that in the case of ¨Orsted, luck played a
more major role than in some other discoveries; but we should not forget that the element
of luck—with varying degree of intensity—is present in almost all great achievements.
¨Orsted’s discovery set the course of physical research for the remainder of the nineteenth
century. Its signiﬁcance was clear from the start. Less than a year after its discovery, the
French physicist Arago read ¨Orsted’s announcement of his experiments in the 11 September
1820 meeting of the French Academy of Sciences. Among the audience in that momentous
meeting was Andr´e-Marie Amp`ere (1775–1836), a professor of mathematics at the ´Ecole
Polytechnique of Paris, and a distinguished physicist and chemist. Amp`ere immediately
followed up on ¨Orsted’s discovery, and soon broke new grounds for the growth of the new
science of electromagnetism. Within a week of Arago’s announcement, Amp`ere had repeated
¨Orsted’s experiment, and on September 18, 1820 informed the Academy of his discovery that
electric currents in parallel wires produced a mutual magnetism that exerted a force between
them. The next few years saw Amp`ere producing a series of memoirs on the fundamentals
of electromagnetism that led to the science of electrodynamics.
Building on ¨Orsted’s observation of the deﬂection of a compass needle due to the current
in a wire, Amp`ere invented—and coined the name—galvanometer to measure the strength

of the electric current precisely.
From ¨Orsted’s experiments and his own, Amp`ere concluded that electric current is the
source of all magnetic phenomena. In particular, inside every magnet must reside some
form of electric current. He argued that since an electric current deﬂects a magnetic needle,
and since the same needle is also aﬀected by the Earth’s magnetism, there must be electric
currents circulating inside the Earth. He then deduced that, just as two magnets exert forces
on one another, so must two electric currents, and successfully demonstrated this deduction
and discovered the mathematical formula for the force between two current-carrying wires.
Example D.13.1 on page 36 of Appendix.pdf gives this formula and calculates the force

between two sample wires.
BIOGRAPHY
Andr´e-Marie Amp`ere (1775–1836) had shown a precocity in mathematics by age four. Encouraged
and tutored by his father, he developed such an intense scientiﬁc interest that at age 12 he was studying
advanced treatises on analytical mechanics. At the age of 18, witnessing the execution of his father
on the guillotine, Amp`ere was so devastated that his mind was temporarily deranged. In 1796 he met
Julie Carron, and an attachment sprang up between them, leading to their marriage in 1799. From
about 1796 Amp`ere gave private lessons at Lyons in mathematics, chemistry and languages; and in
1801 he moved to Bourg, as professor of physics and chemistry, leaving his ailing wife and infant son
at Lyons. She died in 1804, and he never recovered from the blow. In the same year he was appointed
professor of mathematics at the lyc´ee of Lyons. From 1800 to 1814, Amp`ere devoted his time mainly to
mathematics. And it was this strong background in mathematics that helped him later in his formulation
of electrodynamics.
13.3
Faraday’s Lines of Force
The next giant step in the development of electromagnetism was taken by Faraday, the En-
glish physicist/chemist. His superhuman physical intuition, grounded in his lack of mathe-
matical ability, introduced the concept of ﬁeld lines, paving the way for the electromagnetic
revolution of the nineteenth century. The mere introduction of ﬁeld lines into the conscious-
ness of the physics community was a giant step. Their clever use in the establishment of the
ultimate connection between electricity and magnetism was something that only Faraday
could accomplish.
Take a bar magnet and place it on a cardboard. On top of the board sprinkle iron
ﬁlings and tap on the board allowing the ﬁlings to align themselves. It is seen that the

ﬁling particles produce regular lines on the board similar to the ones shown in Figure 13.2.
Faraday called these lines the magnetic ﬁeld lines or magnetic lines of force, and
suggested that the iron ﬁling merely acts as a catalyst to make visible the invisible lines
that are always there. This “visualization” of magnetism as invisible magnetic ﬁeld lines was
probably one of Faraday’s most important contributions to physics. Ironically, Faraday’s
mathematical weakness forced him to invent the more intuitive concept of magnetic ﬁeld
lines, which later became one of the primary ingredients of the mathematical theory of
electromagnetism in the hands of James C. Maxwell.
On these lines of force Faraday wrote:
Now it appears to me that these lines may be employed with great advantage to
represent the nature, condition, direction and comparative amount of the magnetic
forces; and that in many cases they have, to the physical reasoner at least, a superiority
over that method which represents the forces as concentrated in centers of action, such

as the poles of magnets or needles; or some other methods as, for instance, that
which considers the north and south magnetisms as ﬂuids diﬀused over the ends or the
particles of a bar . . .
I cannot refrain from again expressing my conviction of the truthfulness of the repre-
sentation, which the idea of lines of force aﬀords in regard to magnetic action . . . . In a
straight wire, for instance, carrying an electric current, it is apparently impossible to
represent the magnetic forces by centers of action, whereas the lines of force simply and
truly represent them. The study of these lines have, at diﬀerent times, been greatly
inﬂuential in leading me to various results, which I think prove their utility as well as
fertility.
With the notion of magnetic ﬁeld lines, we can now summarize what we have learned about
electromagnetism so far:
Box 13.3.1. Electric current is the source of all magnetic ﬁelds. Moving electric charges
not only create magnetic ﬁelds, but also experience magnetic forces when placed in a
magnetic ﬁeld.
What do you know? 13.1. A current inside a wire creates a magnetic ﬁeld outside.
Now imagine riding along the wire with the same speed as the charges producing the
current inside. The charges no longer move relative to you; i.e., you see stationary
charges. And stationary charges produce only electric ﬁeld. What’s the catch?
History was on Faraday’s side. James C. Maxwell not only found a precise mathematical
meaning for these lines of force, but eventually turned them into real physical entities that
made the radio talk, the television show, the microwave oven cook, and the telephone send
a voice across the Atlantic and the Paciﬁc oceans. But of these later.
Faraday next turned to the study of electrostatics. Instead of charges, he thought in
terms of electric lines of force. To him the opposite charges were only the diﬀerent ends of
To Faraday, opposite

lines of force.
the lines of force. Since the ﬁeld lines cause electrical forces on charges, and since charges
move freely inside conductors, Faraday concluded that no electric ﬁeld can exist inside a
conductor—as long as no battery is attached to it.
Because, if there were any electric
ﬁeld inside the conductor, it would move the charges, creating an electric current. With
no battery attached to the conductor, such a spontaneous generation of electric current is
impossible.1
What happens if you add some charges to a conductor? Faraday concluded that it must
reside on the surface of the conductor, because any charge inside would create lines of force
around it. This is impossible by the argument above. To prove his point, he constructed a
hollow cube twelve feet to a side. The outside of the cube was covered with a metal foil,
and the cube was placed on insulating supports to prevent contact with the ﬂoor. With
Faraday inside, the cube was charged from a powerful electrostatic machine. Here is how
he reported on the experiment:
I went into the cube and lived in it, and using lighted candles, electrometers, and all
other tests of electrical states, I could not ﬁnd the least inﬂuence on them . . . though
all the time the outside of the cube was very powerfully charged, and large sparks and
brushes were darting oﬀfrom every part of its outer surface.
This experiment of Faraday, by the way, explains why it is quite safe to be inside a (metallic!)
car when lightning strikes.
1Actually, when you put electric charges on a conductor, they initially move and rearrange themselves
in such a way as to create a zero electric ﬁeld inside. But this rearrangement takes an inﬁnitesimally small
time.

The electric lines of force emanate from positive and end on negative charges. What
about the magnetic ﬁeld lines? On a bar magnet, the ﬁeld lines emanate from the north
pole and terminate on the south pole [Figure 13.3(a)]. As in the case of electric ﬁeld lines,
the more concentrated the magnetic lines of force, the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld. What
about the magnetic ﬁeld lines of a wire carrying an electric current? There is no north or
south pole in the wire! It turns out that for a long current-carrying straight wire, the lines
close on themselves in the form of concentric circles around the wire with the wire at their
common center [Figure 13.3(b)]. A change in the direction of the current results in a change
in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld. There is a rule, called the right-hand rule (RHR),
similar to the one we encountered in Section 8.2, which relates the direction of the current
to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld lines: If the thumb of the right hand points in the
direction of the current, the ﬁngers, when curled, show the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld
[see Figure 13.3(c)]. Actually, this rule applies to any electric current as long as we stay
very close to the current.
Figure 13.4 shows the ﬁeld lines for a single loop of wire, and a helical coil each carrying
an electric current. Note the similarity between the outer magnetic ﬁeld lines of the coil
and a bar magnet. This similarity suggests that the magnetic ﬁeld lines of a bar magnet

may continue inside the magnet forming a closed loop just as in the case of a coil and a long
straight wire. It is now an established fact that
Box 13.3.2. The magnetic ﬁeld lines always form a closed loop, and have no beginning
and no end. Thus there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles).
This means that it is impossible to have a north pole without a corresponding south pole
attached to it. Even the atomic-sized magnets have a north pole and a south pole!
What do you know? 13.2. Each iron atom is a microscopic magnet that aligns itself
with the magnetic lines of force when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. If iron consists of such
microscopic magnets, why is it not magnetic? Why does a piece of iron get attracted
to either a north pole or a south pole?

13.3.1
Magnetic Fields of Currents
Only a month after ¨Orsted’s announcement was read in the September meeting of the
French Academy of Sciences in 1820, two French physicists, Jean-Baptiste Biot and
Felix Savart, in collaboration with Amp`ere, discovered how the magnetic “action” varied
with distance from a long straight wire. The vague notion of “action” was later clariﬁed and
replaced by Faraday’s concept of ﬁeld. Biot and Savart discovered that, for a given current,
the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld of a straight long wire decreases in inverse proportion
to the distance from the wire. Example D.13.2 on page 36 of Appendix.pdf gives the
mathematical formula of this statement and uses it to show that it takes a gigantic current
to produce any appreciable magnetic ﬁeld.
BIOGRAPHY
The biography of Michael Faraday (1791–1867) is a paradigm of success through hard work, perse-
verance, the diligent pursuit of one’s interest, and a little bit of luck. Being one of the ten children of
a poor blacksmith, Faraday had to work as an apprentice to a bookbinder instead of going to school.
Taking full advantage of this job he devoured all the scientiﬁc books he could lay his hands on. In
1810, he joined a group of teenagers interested in science, and attended their biweekly lectures regu-
larly. Faraday’s eagerness to learn was matched only by his hard work to overcome his lack of formal
schooling. For instance, at the age of 22, he bore the humiliating task of running errands for the wife of
Humphrey Davy (1778–1829), the English chemist, because, in return, he had the opportunity to travel
with Davy all over Europe, attending his stimulating lectures, meeting great scientists of the time, and
most of all being able to perform experiments in Davy’s laboratory.
The unit of B in the formula of Example D.13.2 is Tesla. To get familiar with the size

of tesla, note that the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about 10−4 tesla. Another (much smaller)
unit of magnetic ﬁeld is Gauss which is 0.0001 tesla.
A few years after Biot and Savart introduced their formula for the magnetic ﬁeld of a
long wire, Amp`ere, Biot, and Savart generalized the formula for wires of all shapes. Now
they could not only recalculate the magnetic ﬁelds of a long wire—and get the same result
as before—but also of a circular loop, a rectangular loop, etc. Of particular interest was the
magnetic ﬁeld of a solenoid, i.e., a wire wound in the form of a spring. For a (long) solenoid
the magnetic ﬁeld is concentrated mostly inside, where it is almost uniform. Outside the

solenoid, the magnetic ﬁeld is almost zero. Example D.13.3 on page 37 of Appendix.pdf
calculates the magnetic ﬁeld inside a solenoid and shows how hard it is to create sizable
magnetic ﬁelds.
Food for Thought
FFT 13.3.3. Magnet “therapy?” Equation (D.12) shows that the magnetic ﬁeld of a long
(inﬁnite) wire drops in inverse proportion to the distance. For shorter wires the ﬁeld drops in
proportion to distance squared. A permanent magnet is equivalent to a short wire; therefore its
magnetic ﬁeld drops in inverse proportion to distance squared. Magnetic sheets—of the type used
on refrigerator doors—have magnetic ﬁelds that drop at a much faster rate. In fact, at a distance
of only about one millimeter (about ten sheets of paper) the ﬁeld of such magnetic sheets is almost
zero.
With this in mind, one has to ask the question: How are the therapeutic magnets working?
The claim is that because of the iron in the red blood cells, these cells get attracted to the magnet,
and their arrival at the pain area relieves discomfort. There are two ﬂaws in this argument:
• The iron in the red blood cells is in a chemical form that does not get attracted to magnets.
In fact, it happens to be slightly diamagnetic—a form of iron that is repelled by a magnet.
The arrival of red blood cells to a location beneath the skin causes a reddening of the skin.
That is why the skin in the vicinity of a bruise gets red even though there is no cut there.
However, placing a magnet on the skin, no matter how strong, will not cause a reddening of
the skin. The readers can try this for themselves, and see the zero eﬀect.
• The “therapeutic” magnets are usually placed in a velvet strap and tied to the skin. The
thickness of the straps are at least a few millimeters, enough to stop the magnetic ﬁeld from
reaching even the outside of the skin!
Although simple physical and chemical arguments prove unequivocally that magnets have ab-
solutely no eﬀect on humans, millions of people resort to them for treatment of pain. If only they
knew the very basics of physics and chemistry! And the fact that some bona ﬁde doctors advocate
such treatments does not validate their eﬃcacy.
13.4
Electricity from Magnetism
Faraday’s greatest discovery was the electric induction, which took place in the 1830s.
He, like many other European scientists, was aware of ¨Orsted’s experiment. He was also
aware that many scientists were tackling the question of the reverse process: If electric
current can produce magnetism, is it possible to produce electricity from magnets? Earlier,
in 1824, the French physicist Fran¸cois Arago mystiﬁed the scientiﬁc community with the
apparatus shown in Figure 13.5. Arago demonstrated that by rotating the copper disk, one
could “drag” the compass needle along. This mysterious eﬀect occupied the attention of
many great scientists including Amp`ere and Arago himself. But the puzzle was not solved
until 1831, when Faraday made a breakthrough in one of the most brilliant experiments
ever.
In his groundbreaking experiment on electromagnetism, Faraday based his procedure on
Amp`ere’s discovery of the forces between current-carrying wires. How would the activation
of one circuit aﬀect an adjacent circuit in terms of a possible transfer of magnetic induction?
Would the creation of a magnetic force, such as the one created by an electromagnet, produce
some “strain or vibration” in the adjacent wire that might give rise to an electric current?
To test this, Faraday prepared two intertwined circuits wound around a wooden core with
a battery and a switch in one and a galvanometer in the other. He noticed that, in his
own words, “When the contact was made there was a sudden and very slight eﬀect at
the galvanometer, and there was also a similar slight eﬀect at the galvanometer when the
contact with the battery was broken.”

Section 13.4
Electricity from Magnetism

Figure 13.5: When the copper disk is rotated, the compass needle is “dragged” around with it.
It became clear to Faraday that the induction of electricity in the second circuit had
to do with the making and breaking of electric current. To enhance the eﬀect he used a
(circular) iron core instead of wood, and noted that the deﬂection of the galvanometer was
considerably more noticeable than before; but as previously, the eﬀect was not permanent.
The needle came to rest and was indiﬀerent to the steady current. The needle responded
in a similar way in a reversed direction when the battery was disconnected.
Faraday was aware of the fact that iron reinforced the magnetism of the current in the
wire; he also realized that only when magnetism was changed did the galvanometer show a
deﬂection. He then hit upon the idea of using permanent magnets to induce electric current
in the coil connected to the galvanometer. He thrust a bar magnet into the coil; the needle
responded. Quickly withdrawing the magnet reversed the swing of the needle. And with
this experiment the age of electricity and electromagnetic communication became visible in
the horizon.
Legend has it that the Prime Minister of England once asked Faraday what use could
be made of his discoveries, to which Faraday replied “some day it might be possible to tax
them.” This was a remark made half jokingly, indicating the remote possibility of the use
of a shear scientiﬁc discovery. However, this unintentional prophecy was to come true in a
most dramatic way by the end of the nineteenth century when the foundations of a practical
electric generator were laid.
13.4.1
Faraday’s Law
Using the notion of the lines of force and pursuing his experiments further, Faraday showed
that if the “number” of magnetic ﬁeld lines cutting the area of a loop of wire changes, an
electric current will be created in the loop. This current is the result of an induced electro-
motive force (emf). The faster the change, the larger the emf. The “number of magnetic
Magnetic ﬂux.
ﬁeld lines cutting the area of a loop” is an imprecise version of an exact mathematical
quantity called the magnetic ﬂux.
Figure 13.6 illustrates the essential properties of the notion of the ﬂux of a (magnetic,
electric, or any other) ﬁeld. The ﬂux is proportional to the strength of the ﬁeld. Thus, the
loop at 1 has more ﬂux than the loop at 2 although the latter is larger. It also depends
on the size of the loop: More lines of force go through loop 3 than loop 2 because loop 3
is larger than loop 2. Finally, ﬂux depends on the orientation of the loop relative to the
ﬁeld: Loop 4 is larger than loop 1, but the ﬂux through loop 1 is larger because the lines
are perpendicular to the surface of the loop.
With the notion of ﬂux thus explained, Faraday’s law can be stated as follows:
Faraday’s law stated.

Figure 13.6: Flux depends on the size and orientation of the loop as well as the strength of the ﬁeld.
Box 13.4.1. The strength of the electromotive force induced in a loop of wire is pro-
portional to the rate at which the magnetic ﬂux through the area of the loop changes.
Faraday’s law does not give the direction of the induced current. This information is given
by Lenz’s law—named after the Russian physicist Heinrich Lenz (1804–1865)—which states
that the current induced is in such a direction as to oppose the change in the magnetic ﬂux.
There are a number of ways that one can change the magnetic ﬂux:
• Change the orientation of the loop relative to the magnetic lines of force;
• Change the magnetic ﬁeld itself (i.e., the number of ﬁeld lines) by
– moving a permanent magnet towards or away from the loop,
– moving the loop towards or away from the permanent (or an electric) magnet,
– changing the current in an electromagnet;
• Increase or decrease the area of the loop.
Any of the processes above results in the creation of an electric current in the loop.
What do you know? 13.3. How does the motion of the copper disk of Figure 13.5
drag the compass needle? Hint: Since motion is relative, assume a stationary disk and
a moving compass needle; think of the disk as a lot of concentric loops; apply Faraday’s
law; and invoke the third law of motion.
Example 13.4.2. Let a wire loop lie ﬂat on a surface (say this page). Bring the north pole of a
magnet close to the loop. Since the magnetic ﬁeld lines point away from the north pole, the lines
cut the loop into the page. Since the magnet is brought closer to the loop, the number of ﬁeld
lines cutting the area of the loop (i.e., the magnetic ﬂux) increases. According to Faraday’s law, a
current is established. According to Lenz’s law, the direction of this current is such as to oppose
the change in the ﬂux. Since the ﬂux increases into the page, the direction of the current is such
as to produce a magnetic ﬁeld out of the page. The right-hand rule suggests a counter-clockwise
current.
If we move the north pole away from the loop, the magnetic ﬂux decreases. To oppose this
decrease, the current must have a clockwise direction to produce—by the RHR—a magnetic ﬁeld
into the page to compensate for the loss in the ﬂux. The readers can convince themselves that if a
south pole is chosen, the current in each case will be opposite the above currents.

From Faraday’s Law to Electric Power
Put a loop of wire in the space between the two poles of a (U-shaped) magnet (Figure 13.7).
Depending on the angle between the loop and the magnetic ﬁeld lines, the magnitude of the
magnetic ﬂux may be large or small. Now spin the loop. The magnetic ﬂux changes and
you can create an electric current in the loop. To make this kind of electricity production
practical, connect each end of the loop to a conducting ring, which slides on a conducting
brush, causing the transfer of charges from the loop to these brushes. To extract current
from this device, connect the two leading wires of a circuit to these brushes as shown in
Figure 13.7. This analysis illustrates the rudimentary principles of the operation of a gen-
erator of electricity. The rotation of the loop is done by mechanical means—steam-driven

shape of this variation is similar to a simple harmonic oscillation (see Figure 11.4). Such
an oscillation leads to an eﬀective voltage, which characterizes our appliances as 110- or

Transformers
Let an alternating current generator be attached to a solenoid. The current produces a
magnetic ﬁeld inside the coil as in Equation (D.13). Since the current is changing, the
ﬁeld in the coil is also changing. Now guide this alternating magnetic ﬁeld to a second
coil. This guidance can be accomplished by using an iron core that runs through both coils

(see Example D.13.4 on page 37 of Appendix.pdf ) that require very low voltages have a

Distribution of Electric Power
Generators of electricity are usually located in the country side, while most of consumption
takes place in urban areas far from the power plants.
Therefore, electricity has to be
transmitted to consumers. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the practical
utility of electricity was becoming evident, there were two schools of thought as to how
to produce and deliver electric power to consumers.
Thomas Edison (1847–1931), the
American inventor, was a steadfast advocate of direct current, while Nikola Tesla (1856–
1943),2 a Croatian-American engineer and George Westinghouse (1846–1914) championed
alternating current.
The biggest hurdle in transmitting electricity from the generator to the consumers was
the loss of power in the transmission lines in the form of heat: P = Ri2 [see Equation
(E.17)]. It was therefore desirable to reduce both the resistance of the transmission lines
and the current ﬂowing in them, with the latter having much more dramatic eﬀect than
the former. However, the reduction of the current was limited by the appliances used by
the consumers.
Therefore, with direct current, there was no mechanism to reduce this
heat beyond minimizing the resistance of the transmission cable. This meant locating the
generators close to the consumption site. The generators of Edison Electric Light Company
in New York City had to be centrally located. For buildings far from the generators, thick
wires had to be used, and the farther the building, the thicker the wire.
Alternating currents, on the other hand, could go beyond the reduction of resistance
and take advantage of transformers: increase the voltage at the generator using a step-
up transformer thereby reducing the current fed into the transmission lines3 (see Example
D.12.2 and the discussion just before it), then decrease the voltage at the consumption site

using a step-down transformer. The current in the transmission wires could be lowered, and
the heat loss even more so. History sided with Tesla and Westinghouse. Today’s generators,
with the help of step-up transformers, deliver power at a voltage of a few hundred thousand
volts and a relatively small current to substations, at which step-down transformers reduce
the voltage and deliver the resulting power to smaller step-down transformers visible on the
utility posts or backyards of residential buildings.

Answers to “What do you know?”
13.1.
There is no catch! Whether you see an electric ﬁeld or a magnetic ﬁeld (or both)
depends on your state of motion. In fact, there is a deep connection between electromag-
netism and relativity, among whose outcome is the transformation of electric to magnetic
ﬁeld and vice versa as the state of motion of observers changes.
13.2.
Iron is not magnetic, because the microscopic magnets, of which it consists, are
randomly oriented, so that the bulk iron does not have a north pole or a south pole. However,
when placed in an external magnetic ﬁeld, these microscopic magnets align themselves along
the magnetic ﬁeld lines and reinforce each other. If one pole of a magnet is closer to the
bulk iron, the opposite poles of the majority of the microscopic magnets point to that pole,
causing an attraction.
13.3.
As the magnetic needle rotates, it changes the ﬂux through the concentric loops,
creating currents through those loops by Faraday’s law. These currents are in the magnetic
ﬁeld of the needle. Therefore they experience a force by Box 13.3.1. So, the needle exerts
a force on the copper disk. The third law of motion says that the disk should apply a force
on the needle.
13.4. 11 lines pass through loop 1 and 6 through loop 2. Since loop 2 rotates three times
as fast, its rate of change is 6 × 3 = 18 compared to 11. So, the bigger loop has more emf.
13.5. Rotating the bar magnet changes the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic
ﬁeld lines that pass through the loop. Therefore, an emf will be produced in the loop.

What makes a true champion? To a town or a village, it is a young athlete who, through
devotion and perseverance, overcomes a physical handicap and goes on to bring an Olympic
medal to the town or village; it is the honorable conduct of a daughter, a sister, or a mother
who, in a popular war, rescued her comrades-in-arm at the risk of her own life. To a people
it is a leader who rescues a nation from the tyranny and injustice of a corrupt and outmoded
political system. Historical ﬁgures such as Spartacus, Joan of Arc, George Washington, and
Martin Luther King are such national champions. Heroic as these ﬁgures were, their acts
of heroism were conﬁned to a local geography and a temporal slice of history.
There are more “quiet” champions who recognize no geographical borderlines, no tem-
poral boundaries, and no national limits. They are champions of all people living in all
places for all future time. Unaware of their heroism, they unselﬁshly pursue what is most
important, not for a nation for some historical period, but for the entire human race for
eternity. History is full of such global champions, most of them unknown to ordinary men
and women who beneﬁt from their acts of heroism on a daily basis. James Clerk Maxwell
stands out tall among such champions.
14.1
Fields Are Primary
Faraday invented the concept of ﬁeld lines as a means of visualizing the magnetic ﬂux,
thereby determining the electrical induction caused by the rate of change of this ﬂux. The
true power and the historic signiﬁcance of ﬁelds did not emerge, however, until James Clerk
Maxwell abstracted them and put them in their proper mathematical environment. And
nature, in its most subtle way, awaited such sophisticated mental and mathematical achieve-
ment by humankind to guide them toward their most useful practical accomplishments.
Conventional physics was accustomed to “centers of force” acting at a distance, and when
Faraday introduced the more intuitive concept of lines of force, it ran against the established
belief. As Maxwell said, “Faraday, in his mind’s eye, saw lines of force traversing all space.
Where the mathematicians saw centers of forces acting at a distance, Faraday sought the
seat of the phenomena in real actions going on in the medium.”
Maxwell was the ﬁrst strong supporter of the idea that Faraday’s lines of force are indeed
real physical and mathematical entities, and made them the cornerstone of his electromag-
netic theory. In a paper presented to the Cambridge Philosophical Society in 1865, he said
of Faraday’s methodology:
It was perhaps for the advantage of science that Faraday, though thoroughly conscious
of the fundamental forms of space, time, and force, was not a professed mathematician.
He was not tempted to enter into the many interesting researches in pure mathematics

which his discoveries would have suggested if they had been exhibited in mathematical
form . . . .
It fell upon Maxwell himself “to enter into the many interesting researches in pure mathe-
matics” which Faraday’s ﬁeld concepts suggested.
BIOGRAPHY
James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879) came from a comfortable middle-class background. His mother
died in 1839 from abdominal cancer, the very disease to which Maxwell was to succumb at exactly the
same age. From an early age, he displayed a lively curiosity and a phenomenal memory. Maxwell’s
interests ranged far beyond the school syllabus, and he did not pay particular attention to examination
performance. His ﬁrst scientiﬁc paper on geometry was published at the age of 14. James attended Ed-
inburgh Academy where he had the nickname “Daﬀy.” His friend and biographer writes of Maxwell: “At
school he was at ﬁrst regarded as shy and rather dull. He made no friendships and spent his occasional
holidays in reading old ballads, drawing curious diagrams and making rude mechanical models.” This
fascination with geometry and with mechanical models continued throughout his career and was of great
help in his subsequent research. In 1850 he went to the University of Cambridge, where his exceptional
powers began to be recognized. Maxwell is widely regarded as the nineteenth century scientist who had
the greatest inﬂuence on twentieth century physics, making contributions to the fundamental models
of nature. In 1931, on the centennial anniversary of Maxwell’s birth, Einstein described Maxwell’s work
as the “most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton.”
14.1.1
Pre-Maxwellian Electromagnetism
The science of electromagnetism in the 1850s, when Maxwell started his work on the subject,
consisted of four mathematical equations, which could be translated as the following four
statements:
• Coulomb’s law, which governed the (action-at-a-distance) force between two electric
charges;
• ¨Orsted–Faraday discovery that currents produce magnetism, especially the fact that
magnetic ﬁelds have no beginnings and no ends;
• Faraday’s law of magnetic induction of electricity in a wire;
• Amp`ere’s law of production of magnetism from electric current.
One of Maxwell’s great contributions to this science was his systematization of these equa-
tions, and their translation in the language of ﬁelds, a feat that history recognized by naming
the ﬁeld-equivalent of all the four statements above in his honor.
A thousand years from now, in the utopian world, in which every child is as ﬂuent in
mathematics as in his/her mother tongue; in which every adult appreciates the new kind of
poetry, the poetry written in the language of mathematics; in which mathematical symbols
of this poetry take on a new art form in the eye of ordinary men and women; Maxwell’s
equations will shine as a masterpiece among the poetic art pieces. We are far from this
utopia, but as a reminder of this highest form of poetry, let us put each Maxwell equation
together with a familiar art.
The following discussion explains, in nontechnical terms, the content of Maxwell’s epoch-
making work on electromagnetism. “Nontechnical explanation” is an oxymoron; but fortu-
nately the richness of Maxwell’s work makes it possible even for the non-mathematical—but
motivated—person to appreciate the power and beauty of his creation. This creation is not
unlike the creation of the most notable artists in history. If the genius of a great artist is to
capture the beauty of nature, then Maxwell is one of the greatest artists of all time, because
he was able to capture, on his mathematical canvas, the dazzling beauty of light itself.

Food for Thought
FFT 14.1.1. The word “ﬁeld” has become a fashionable commodity among the practitioners of
New Age medicine. When combined with another word taken from physics, “energy,” it heralds
a potent cure, a new state of mind and health, a higher level of consciousness. The purveyors of
alternative medicine talk of the “interpersonal transfer” of the energy ﬁeld by the laying-on-of-hand
technique, the healing power of the magnetic ﬁelds of little pieces of magnets, the miracle of the
energy ﬁeld of the quantum healing techniques.
The only thing that is common between their use of the word “ﬁeld” and the physicist’s use of
the word, as described in this chapter, is just that, the word. By their own admission, the ﬁeld of
alternative practitioners cannot be seen, cannot be touched, cannot be detected, or measured. In
fact, they proudly claim that their “ﬁeld” is nonmaterial.
The ﬁeld of a physicist, on the other hand, is entirely material, and like any other material
object under study in any branch of science, ﬁelds can be detected, measured, and demonstrably
controlled. When a physicist speaks of a ﬁeld, she can take you to her lab and show you where
she produces it, how she guides it, and how she detects it at the receiver’s end. Once she teaches
you how all these are done, you can experiment with the ﬁelds yourself. Then you will know that
when you hear a song on the radio, it is the material electromagnetic ﬁeld that has turned into an
electric current, which in turn has physically vibrated the diaphragm of your loudspeaker, which
disturbs the air molecules around you, which physically vibrate the diaphragm of your ear, making
you hear the song. When you watch your favorite program on television, it is again the material
electromagnetic ﬁeld that has created a tiny current, which has pushed some material electrons
in a vacuum tube causing them to land on a coat of phosphorus material, which in turn emit a
tiny amount of visible electromagnetic ﬁeld, which your eye detects as TV images. There is no
mysterious nonmaterial auras involved in a physicist’s ﬁeld.
There are two properties of the ﬁeld concept that attract the alternative “doctors” to it: (a)
“Field” of the
alternative medicine and
“spirit” of the witch
doctors.
ﬁelds are, for the most part, invisible to the human eye, and, (b) in principle, they spread over all
space. These two properties ﬁt very nicely with the (usually Eastern) spirituality of the practitioners
of alternative medicine. After all, the “universal spirit,” which is part of Eastern mysticism, is also
invisible and spreads over all space. However, the word “spirit” is outdated and trivialized, but
“ﬁeld” carries the weight of the twentieth century physics. When you remove the cloak of modern
verbiage from the “ﬁeld” of the alternative medicine, you will discover the “spirit” of the ancient
tribal shamans and witch doctors.
And neither the academic degree held by the practitioners of New Age medicine, nor their
previous high rank in a hospital administration is relevant. The unawareness of the public—and
Adherence of a

the potential for turning this unawareness into personal wealth—is too luring to keep 100% of all
medical doctors in their oﬃces practicing honest and scientiﬁc medicine. It is very hard to resist
the temptation of writing a national bestseller on modern spiritual healing, even if you hold a
doctorate from an Ivy League Medical School.
It may not be money that attracts medical doctors and scientists to irrationalism. History gives
us many examples of irrational inclination of (once-)rational people. Newton’s fascination with
alchemy is one example. Freud was a neurologist by training before he turned to the pseudoscience
of psychoanalysis.
Werner Heisenberg, the discoverer of the uncertainty principle in quantum
theory, was lured to the Nazi ideology. Julian Schwinger, a Nobel Laureate and cofounder of the
extremely successful quantum electrodynamics, was lured into the cult of cold fusion until his death
in 1994. There are many other examples—both current and in history—of rational people turning
to irrational doctrines. We don’t know how or why such transitions take place. But we are certain
of one thing: Adherence of a well-known accredited scientist or doctor to irrational beliefs does not
rationalize irrationality.
Maxwell’s First Three Equations
Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation, portrayed in Figure 14.1(a), also called Gauss’s law after the
great German mathematical physicist, states that the divergence1 of the electric ﬁeld is
proportional to the concentration of the electric charge (ρ stands for the electric charge

constant appearing in Coulomb’s law, and the electric charge (density), respectively. (b) Maxwell’s second

density). Maxwell’s ﬁrst equation is the reformulation of Coulomb’s law [Equation (12.1)]
in the language of ﬁelds.2 Math Note E.14.1 on page 96 of Appendix.pdf takes you on
a tour of this abstract symbolism. The essence of the ﬁrst equation is that electric charge
is the source of the electric ﬁeld.
The second Maxwell equation, exhibited in Figure 14.1(b), states that the divergence of
the magnetic ﬁeld is zero. What does this mean? Math Note E.14.1 shows that divergence
is closely related to the total ﬂux through the bounding surface of a small cubic volume.
The second equation is therefore saying that no matter where in space you pick your little
cube, no net outward or inward ﬂux will pierce its sides. Thus nowhere in space can you
ﬁnd a point from which magnetic ﬁeld lines diverge, or to which they converge. Since such
points indicate the presence of charges, the second Maxwell equation must be telling us that
there are no magnetic charges in nature, or that magnetic ﬁeld lines have no beginning or
end.
The third Maxwell equation is displayed in Figure 14.1(c). This equation is the math-
ematical equivalent of the Faraday’s law of induction expressed in the language of ﬁelds.
Math Note E.14.2 on page 97 of Appendix.pdf shows the connection between the third
equation and Faraday’s law.
The Fourth Equation
Maxwell also inherited a fourth equation, the so-called Ampere’s law, which is written
in Figure 14.2(a). The LHS, as explained in Math Note E.14.2, is the circulation of the
magnetic ﬁeld around some (small) loop divided by the area of the loop. The RHS is (some
constants times) the electric current divided by the area of the loop.
Thus, the fourth
equation states that the circulation of the magnetic ﬁeld around a loop is proportional to
the current piercing that loop. For example, if one calculates the circulation of the circular
magnetic ﬁeld of the long straight wire of Figure 13.3, one obtains 4πkm times the current
in the wire.
2As the alert reader may have noticed, the only surviving piece of Coulomb’s law in this equation is the
symbol ke.

is most ﬂuently spoken. In fact, it was the need demanded by the electromagnetic theory—

much like the need for calculus demanded by mechanics—that drove Maxwell in the direction
of this mathematics. And although he did not use the abbreviated (and more sophisticated)
symbols used in the artworks above, he was well trained in the subject to be able to analyze
the four equations mathematically and logically. Such an analysis led Maxwell to an amazing
discovery.
As early as 1855, the electromagnetic phenomena had occupied Maxwell’s attention as
well as many other prominent mathematicians and physicists. After a series of attempts at
“constructing a mechanical model of electromagnetic action,” Maxwell ﬁnally hit upon the
key to such a dynamical theory. This key was the conservation of electric charge. Through

a careful mathematical analysis he discovered that
Box 14.2.1. The fourth equation of electromagnetism was inconsistent with the con-
servation of electric charge.
He also discovered the way to make the fourth equation consistent with charge conser-
vation. This was a remarkable achievement, because it was entirely based on the deductive
power of the human mind, Maxwell’s mind. This remedial act of Maxwell immortalized his
name, because today the four equations, each discovered by a diﬀerent person, are justiﬁably
called Maxwell’s equations.

a plain ugly box and the other on a masterpiece.
The only consistent way of changing the fourth equation was to add another term,
the so-called displacement current to its RHS. The new equation, now called Maxwell’s
fourth equation, is displayed in Figure 14.2(b). The displacement current is simply the time
rate of change of the electric ﬁeld. In the absence of the electric current (i.e., when J = 0),

the new equation looks very similar to the third equation—except for the interchange of E
and B.
If there are any instances in history in which the force of logic and impetus of mathe-
matical consistency has changed the course of the human civilization, this is deﬁnitely one
of them. The changing of the fourth equation, due to its momentous implication, is without
a doubt one of the most signiﬁcant events in the history of humankind, and deﬁnitely the

most important event of the nineteenth century.
We have seen that for many years physicists had been looking for a connection between
electricity and magnetism, and there were many experiments which showed such a connec-
tion. Maxwell’s alteration of the fourth equation elevated the vague idea of a “connection”
to a precise mathematical idea of unity. In Maxwell’s theory, the electric and magnetic ﬁelds
became inseparably intertwined and thus diﬀerent manifestations of the same physical ﬁeld,
called the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Maxwell’s theory is the ﬁrst true uniﬁed ﬁeld theory

which molds the electric and magnetic phenomena into a whole entity.
14.3
Maxwell Predicts Electromagnetic Waves
Imagine a point in space where there is a changing electric ﬁeld. According to Maxwell’s the-
ory, there must be a magnetic ﬁeld close to that point. It turns out that this magnetic ﬁeld
is also changing. In reality, a changing electric ﬁeld produces a changing magnetic ﬁeld and
vice versa. This changing magnetic ﬁeld—again according to Maxwell’s theory—produces a
changing electric ﬁeld in the neighboring points, which produces a changing magnetic ﬁeld
in the neighborhood of the neighboring points, ad inﬁnitum! Such a progression of changing
electric/magnetic ﬁelds is what is called an electromagnetic wave.
Maxwell showed, with mathematical rigor, that in regions of space where there are
no electric charges and currents, his equations would lead to the equation displayed in
Figure 14.3, regardless of how the (distant) sources produce the electric and magnetic ﬁelds.
With proper identiﬁcation of certain parameters, this is precisely the wave equation of
Figure 11.1. He, thus, for the ﬁrst time, predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves.
And as Math Note E.14.3 on page 98 of Appendix.pdf shows
Box 14.3.1. The electromagnetic (EM) waves travel at the speed of light. Furthermore,
this speed does not depend on how the waves are produced.
Is this a mere coincidence? Is EM wave a completely new and diﬀerent wave, which
just happens to have the same velocity as light? Or, is light a form of EM wave? Maxwell
boldly assumed the latter; and he was right. We now know that light is merely a form of
EM wave which happens to be detectable by the human eye.
What do you know? 14.2. As you ride a train going at 60 mph, throw a ball with a
speed of 40 mph forward. The person outside will see the ball moving at 100 mph. This
is called the law of addition of velocities. Now imagine getting on a spaceship going
at half the speed of light and turn on your laser gun shooting laser light at the speed
of light forward. What is the speed of this laser light relative to the observer outside?
If you think it is 1.5 the speed of light, think again! And read the statement of Box
14.3.1, whose second statement precludes any dependence of the speed of light on the
motion of its source.
Like other waves, EM waves satisfy c = λf.3 This brings up the question of: How large
3c is the universally accepted symbol for the speed of EM waves.

can be, as long as their product remains equal to c. We thus speak of the electromagnetic

spectrum are given special names. These names become blurred at the overlaps between
various regions. Thus, for example, the overlap between infrared region and the microwave
region has no clear-cut name; similarly for the X-rays and the gamma rays, etc.

equation was the most signiﬁcant event of the nineteenth century.
Can you justify
that? Hint: Look at the diﬀerent categories of Figure 14.4.
The visible range consists of the rainbow colors. The longest visible wavelength is 0.7
µm (read micrometer which is 10−6 m) corresponding to red (R). The shortest visible
wavelength is 0.4 µm corresponding to violet (V). In between these two extremes lie orange,
yellow, green, blue, and indigo, making up a mnemonic acronym Roy G. Biv.
Food for Thought
FFT 14.3.2. What was it that motivated Maxwell? What application did he have in mind when
working on electromagnetism? Was it the wealth that was involved upon patenting his discovery?
Was he even interested in patenting his revolutionary ﬁndings? Perhaps it was the celebrity status
that would surely come after his success? What was his motivation? Surely it wasn’t just to solve
an equation or unravel a mystery!
Indeed it was! Not a single practical consequence or invention resulting from EM theory could
have been predicted by Maxwell. His only interest was to solve an equation, to unravel a mystery,
to ﬁnd the solution to a puzzle, to satisfy a personal curiosity. After all, this is the dominant
characteristic of human species. As a species, our inquisitive mind, our curiosity and our desire to
have answers to questions are our most eﬀective weapons for survival. This is as true today as it
was two million years ago. Look at a 4-year-old child whose mind is unfettered by any cultural or
social bonds. The number of questions she asks per day runs into the hundreds! Yet, by the time
she reaches adolescence, this number drops to single digits. There are many factors contributing to

216
Chapter 14
Electromagnetic Waves
this disheartening apathy, but the dominant one, especially in the US, is the societal and parental
emphasis on entertainment, sport, accumulating wealth, and having “fun,” while stigmatizing
children who like to exercise their intellect and curiosity as “nerds.”
Fortunately there are exceptions. A small—and, sad to say, dwindling—fraction of the human
species continues to ask questions, to think about problems, to have an ongoing desire to unravel
the mysteries of nature.
These are our scientists pursuing fundamental problems of our time.
Problems that have no practical applications in sight, but have posed themselves in scientiﬁc
communities as the most challenging. If we, as a species, are going to survive, we must support
them unconditionally.

Figure 14.4: There is no limit to how large or how small a wavelength (or frequency) EM waves can
have. The visible spectrum has the longest wavelength of 0.7 µm corresponding to red, and the shortest
wavelength of 0.4 µm corresponding to violet.
Example 14.3.3. An AM (Amplitude Modulation) radio station transmits at 1000 kHz (kilo-
hertz). What is the wavelength of the EM waves transmitted? Using the equation c = λf with
c = 3×108 and f = 1, 000, 000 = 106 Hz, we obtain 3×108 = λ×106 whose solution is λ = 300 m.
The radius of an atom is approximately 5 Angstrom (an Angstrom is 10−10 m or a tenth of
a nanometer). What is the frequency of the EM wave having a wavelength this small, and what
is the name of such a wave? Again using the formula c = λf with λ = 5 × 10−10 m, we obtain
3 × 108 = 5 × 10−10f, so that f = 6 × 1017 Hz. This is an X-ray.

What do you know? 14.4. An EM wave has a wavelength of 250 nm. What category
of EM spectrum does it belong to? What about 900 nm?
14.3.1
Production of EM Waves
Our discussion of EM waves has thus far assumed the prior existence of a changing electric
(or magnetic) ﬁeld which gives rise to a magnetic (or electric) ﬁeld and so on, establishing
a wave.
But what causes the original changing ﬁeld?
We have seen that a charge is
surrounded by an electric ﬁeld, and a magnet by a magnetic ﬁeld, whose strength at a given
point depends on the distance of the point from the charge or the magnet. This suggests
that if we move the charge or the magnet, the electric or the magnetic ﬁeld will change and
the wave will be produced. The mathematical analysis of Maxwell’s equations shows that
Accelerating charges
produce EM waves.
the suggestion is correct with a minor modiﬁcation:

Section 14.3
Maxwell Predicts Electromagnetic Waves
217
Box 14.3.4. Only an accelerated electric charge (or magnet) produces EM waves.
Although a charge in uniform (constant velocity) motion has a changing electric ﬁeld, it
does not produce EM waves. To produce EM waves, the velocity of the electric charge must
change.
There are many ways to produce EM waves, some practical and some not-so-practical:
• Throw a bottle of electric charge to the ﬂoor. The free fall and the stoppage of the
charge create, respectively, an acceleration and a (very sudden) deceleration, causing
EM wave production.
• Rub a piece of plastic against wool (this charges the plastic), and move the plastic up
and down. This up-down motion of electric charge is an accelerated motion. Hence,
EM waves are produced.
• Attach the above-mentioned electrically charged plastic to one end of a string, and,
holding the other end, whirl the plastic above your head. This circular motion, like
any other circular motion, has (centripetal) acceleration that can produce EM waves.
The three methods above are hardly the way EM waves are produced. The frequency in
the second and third item is not even 10 Hz. Thus the wavelength is longer than 3 × 107 m
or 30,000 km! A wave with such a large wavelength (the circumference of the Earth is about
40,000 km) is hardly called a wave. There are better ways of producing EM waves.
• An antenna carries an alternating current of high frequency. Because of the periodic
change in the direction of the current, the charges responsible for the current undergo
periodic acceleration producing EM waves.
• The charges in a wire carrying alternating current (AC) experience acceleration.
Hence, they produce EM waves.
The diﬀerence between the last two methods is that in the ﬁrst, the charges are given a
well-deﬁned frequency (the frequency of the radio station, for example), while in the second
there is no well-deﬁned frequency. That is why the EM signal from a wire is picked up as a
noise by the receiver. The frequency of 60 Hz associated with the AC electricity is only the
“average” frequency. There are many other “components” of higher and lower frequencies
in the AC electricity.
What do you know? 14.5. In the classical picture of the hydrogen atom, the electron
moves with a speed of 400,000 m/s on a circle of radius 0.1 nm. What kind of EM wave
does it produce? Hint: Find the period and then the frequency.
The shape of an EM wave is very complicated in the vicinity of its source. However, if
you look at the wave far away from the source, the shape is simple. Think of the wave front
as a sphere that expands in all directions. If you are very far away, and have access to only a
small portion of that sphere, that small portion appears as a ﬂat plane (think of the surface
of the spherical Earth).
Because of this ﬂatness, the wave detected at a large distance
from its source is called a plane wave. The electric and magnetic ﬁeld lines of plane EM

waves lie in this planar front and are perpendicular to one another. Figure 14.5 shows a
plane electromagnetic wave that moves along the z-axis. The electric ﬁeld, which oscillates
along the x-axis of the ﬁgure is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld which oscillates along
the y-axis. Maxwell’s equations show that for a plane EM wave, the electric and magnetic

ﬁelds are related at all times via E = cB where c is the speed of light. Thus, the two ﬁelds
oscillate in unison.
Like any other waves, EM waves carry energy, which is proportional to the square of
their amplitudes (see Box 11.2.2). Since there are really two waves (electric and magnetic)
associated with an EM wave, the energy is the sum of these two waves. This is the classical
picture of an EM wave, and it is valid as long as we deal with low-frequency EM waves. One
of the revolutionary discoveries at the turn of the twentieth century was that this classical
assumption breaks down for high-frequency EM waves. The correct way of describing high-
frequency (and in fact all) EM waves is the language of quantum theory. Example D.14.1
on page 37 of Appendix.pdf looks at the energy of the EM waves coming from the Sun and
those coming from the power lines.

Answers to “What do you know?”
14.1. The plain box contains the fourth equation that violated electric charge conservation,
and is wrong. The masterpiece contains one of the masterpieces of mathematical physics:
the fourth Maxwell’s equation.
14.2.
In fact, the speed of light is a universal constant independent of the motion of the
source or receiver. This statement is at the heart of relativity theory, and leads to such
weird phenomena as the relativity of time and length (see Chapter 25).
14.3. The correction of the fourth equation allowed the production of the entire spectrum
of EM waves, which have penetrated every aspect of our modern civilization with dramatic
and revolutionary consequences.
14.4. 250 nm is 0.25 µm or 2.5×10−7 m, which is slightly shorter than the violet wavelength
of 4 × 10−7 m. So, it is ultraviolet. Similarly, 900 nm is infrared.
14.5. To ﬁnd the period, you need the circumference of the orbit whose radius is given as
0.1 nm or 10−10 m. This gives 2π × 10−10 or 6.28 × 10−10 m for the circumference. Divide
the circumference by the speed to ﬁnd the period. You should get 1.57 × 10−15 s. Take
the inverse of this to get the frequency, 6.37 × 1014 Hz, corresponding to a wavelength of
0.47 µm, which is visible.

Chapter15
Epilogue: Mind and Matter
The development of electromagnetism took place very slowly compared to mechanics, al-
though the two branches of physics started at about the same time. While only two decades
after Galileo, Newton wrote down the laws of mechanics in their entirety, two centuries af-
ter Gilbert, there was still confusion about the laws of electricity and magnetism. The
reason—aside from the fact that mechanics had a powerful mind such as Newton’s on its
side—was that electricity was intrinsically more complicated and required substantially
more observations before it succumbed to a rigorous theoretical analysis.
15.1
Continuity
From Gilbert’s ﬁrst observations to Coulomb’s mathematical statement about electrical

forces, almost two centuries passed. The very control of electricity and its collection on
various objects took a long time. All of this required patient and systematic observations
by many generations of experimenters. There is no other place in the history of science
than in experimental electricity where the continuity of science can be demonstrated more
eﬀectively. Every discovery became the necessary starting point for a new ﬁnding.
¨Orsted’s discovery of the connection between electricity and magnetism in 1820 required
a battery, which was invented by Volta in the 1790s. The invention of the battery would
not have been possible without the earlier experiments by Galvani of the eﬀects of electric
currents on frog legs. These currents were produced using the Leyden jar, which was one
of many devices that could store electricity. The construction of the Leyden jar relied on
the conducting properties of metals, which was discovered by Gray at the beginning of the
eighteenth century using G¨uricke’s electric machine developed in the 1660s. And G¨uricke
relied on the discoveries made by Gilbert, who started modern electricity and magnetism.
The discovery of electrical magnetism prompted one of the most intense research activi-
ties of human history. In less than two decades, all the observational and phenomenological
pieces of the puzzle were in place, and there wasn’t much of anything else physicists could
do in the way of observation and data collection. The next step required the intervention
of the human mind.
Not only were the experiments of electricity and magnetism connected like a chain that
stretched from the 1830s all the way to 1600, but also the theoretical ideas introduced. For
example, the mathematical formula for the force between two electrical charges [Equation
(12.1)] uses the concept of force as introduced in the second law of motion by Newton in
1660s, and connects electricity to mechanics.
More importantly, all the intense experimental research in the magnetism of electric
currents done in the decades of the 1820s and 1830s also used instruments that measured

222
Chapter 15
Epilogue: Mind and Matter
mechanical forces introduced in the second law of motion. And all the intricate mathemat-
ical formulas of magnetism were based on such experiments and observations. One can say
that the chain that connects over two hundred years of electromagnetism, branches oﬀto
the science of mechanics of the 1600s as well.
15.2
Speciﬁcity and Idealization
The entire subject of electromagnetism developed step by step by asking speciﬁc questions
and studying speciﬁc objects. Gilbert, the father of modern electricity and magnetism, asked
“Why does the compass needle point north?” “Why does amber attract pieces of paper?”
Electromagnetism
develops by asking
speciﬁc questions.
“Can I electrify other objects?”
G¨uricke, following Gilbert’s footsteps and electrifying
various substances asked the speciﬁc question “What is the best way to add more and more
electricity to a substance?” And at the climax of electrostatics, Coulomb asked the speciﬁc
question “What is the electric force between two charged metallic spheres?”
After the discovery of electric conduction and batteries, the focus shifted to the magnetic
eﬀect of electric currents. But there was no shift in speciﬁcity. “How does an electric circuit
produce a magnetic ﬁeld?” No, more speciﬁcally, “How does a straight current-carrying wire
produce a magnetic ﬁeld?” No, that is too general! “How does an inﬁnitesimal element
of a current-carrying wire produce a magnetic ﬁeld?”
The more speciﬁc the questions
became, the more widespread was their use. Once you know how an inﬁnitesimal element
of a current produces its magnetic ﬁeld, the ﬁeld of any other (large) current could be
calculated, because any wire can be broken into a large number of inﬁnitesimal pieces, and
by adding the ﬁeld of the inﬁnitesimal pieces, one can (through the mathematical process
of integration) calculate the ﬁeld of the entire wire.
Every speciﬁc question or procedure accompanied some kind of idealization.
When
Idealization, another
important step in the
development of
electromagnetism.
Coulomb measured the electric force between two charges, he used charged spheres. But
when he wrote down the Coulomb force law [Equation (12.1)], he idealized the spheres to
mathematical points. Furthermore, he ignored the air between the two charges and how it
would aﬀect the force. In other words, he assumed that the two charges were in a vacuum,
although the air, with all the complex entities comprising it, was surrounding the charges.
Was he justiﬁed in doing so? We now know that, although air is electriﬁed by charges, and
therefore alters the force between them, the eﬀect is so negligible that one can safely ignore
it, as did Coulomb.
The same idealization that Coulomb used to come up with his force law, was used in
all aspects of magnetism of currents. Take an inﬁnitesimal current. This is a mathematical
concept just as a “point” is a mathematical concept. It is a point with a direction: take
any point of a current-carrying wire and see which way the current is ﬂowing at that point.
The combination of the point and the arrow pointing in the direction of the current at that
point is an inﬁnitesimal current element. You cannot get any more ideal than this! Yet,
the entire theory of magnetism is based on this idealization. Moreover, just as Coulomb
ignored the air between the charges, so did the physicists measuring the magnetic forces
and ﬁelds of currents.
15.3
Role of the Mind
Electromagnetism is sometimes considered the transition between classical and modern
physics. It led directly to relativity; and in conjunction with thermodynamics and black
body radiation, it also led to the quantum theory. However, this transition role did not
come about as a result of the phenomenological developments of the 1820s and 1830s, but
as a consequence of Maxwell’s mathematical intervention of 1865.
The slow progress in the theoretical development of electromagnetism was due not only
to the slow pace of its experimental development, but also to its mathematical complexity.

Section 15.4
Materiality of Fields
223
As a comparison take the gravitational (or even electrostatic) force between two point masses
(or two stationary point charges). The only relevant direction is the line joining the two
points. That is why both the gravitational force [Equation (9.1)] and the electrostatic force
[Equation (12.1)] are relatively simple. When physicists tried to write down the expression
for the magnetic forces between two (inﬁnitesimal) currents, they had to take not only the
direction connecting the two currents, but also the direction of the currents themselves.
The intertwining of all these directions makes the mathematical formula of the magnetic
force between two currents much more complicated.
As hard as the formulas were, by 1850s all the observed electromagnetic phenomena
were condensed into a set of four equations. Every new experiment could be explained by
these equations, and as far as observation was concerned there seemed to be no need for any
modiﬁcation of the four equations. However, two purely theoretical developments changed
the course of history. Both came from James C. Maxwell’s mind.
The ﬁrst was Maxwell’s brilliant recognition that electric and magnetic ﬁelds were of
primary importance. The notion of ﬁelds was introduced by the mathematically illiterate
Faraday ﬁrst as an intuitive aid to understand magnetic forces, but then as a more serious
quantity worthy of the attention of theoreticians. Maxwell, a supreme mathematical physi-
cist, somewhat in isolation, took Faraday’s advice and translated the four electromagnetic
equations into the “language” of ﬁelds.
The second was nothing less than a miracle! It was this development that broke away
from classical physics and paved the way for both relativity and the quantum theory. And
this step was taken purely by the human mind, Maxwell’s mind! Maxwell’s mathematical
mind! The details of this step are described in Chapter 14. Here I want to emphasize the
Real power of the mind.
power of the mind in uncovering the most hidden secrets of nature and the tool with which
the mind digs through the surface, mathematics. This use of mathematics is diﬀerent from
its use prior to Maxwell.
Pre-Maxwellian use of mathematics was in transcribing some
experimental results in the proper language.
Maxwell intervened in what was assumed
to be the correct formulation of electromagnetism. And nature agreed with this purely
mathematical intervention and rewarded Maxwell with the entire spectrum of the EM waves.
New Agers also talk about the “power of the mind,” but their mind is a yogic spirit
whose “power” comes from closing one’s eyes and “concentrating” on the void. The power
New Agers’ “power” of
the mind!
of the mind of the likes of Maxwell comes from years of strenuous training in the Olympian
game of mental sport, mathematics, solving many unsolved riddles, and tackling the most
diﬃcult problem of the time. A toddler who throws her toy is not qualiﬁed to be called a
“discus thrower.” In the same vein, a yogi who closes his eyes and sits cross-legged is not
qualiﬁed to be called a possessor of mental power, no matter how much he “concentrates”
and how perfect his cross-leg position is.
As we shall see in the sequel, Maxwell’s “deductive” reasoning has become the norm of
modern physics. In many cases, this deduction—without any observational necessity—leads
to new branches of physics. For example, Einstein’s special theory of relativity is entirely
based on Maxwell’s derivation of EM waves and not on any experiments or observations.
Although almost all modern theories of physics are deductive theories, it does not mean
that experiments play no role. On the contrary, crucial experiments such as the ones that
led to the four equations of electromagnetism, set the correct stage on which the deductive
theories act.

The ﬁelds of Faraday and Maxwell have nothing in common with the “energy ﬁeld” of the
New Agers. The latter, borrowed from electromagnetism and modern physics, uses the word
to give legitimacy to a nonmaterial, spiritual, voodoo, modern witchcraft. Electromagnetic
ﬁelds, on the other hand, are as material as the electricity that turns into images coming

The way one can test for the materiality of anything is to have it interact with a suitable
form of matter and note that it aﬀects the physical characteristic of that form of matter.
Any physical quantity has this property; if it didn’t we would not call it “physical.” Electro-
magnetic ﬁelds or waves aﬀect the motion of charged matter. When they reach the receiver
of your radio, or TV, or cell phone, they set in actual physical motion the charges in the
receiver and create an electric current that can get magniﬁed and its energy transformed
into audiovisual energy.
The New Agers’ “ﬁeld,” or “energy,” or “energy ﬁeld” is, by their own admission, non-
material. These ﬁelds cannot be felt, cannot be detected by any physical instrument, do not
have any visible or audible eﬀect, and do not exist except in the minds of the New Agers or
the guru whom they follow. Here is another diﬀerence between the physical ﬁelds and the
New Agers’ “ﬁeld.” Anybody can learn how to operate a device that produces EM ﬁelds,
and if desired, learn the physical and electrical details of how the ﬁelds are produced; she
can even be taught to construct a transmitter from wires, resistors, capacitors, etc. She

enough,” or “You don’t have enough faith in the EM ﬁelds.” She is shown which wire or
capacitor or another circuit element was connected incorrectly.

strument. Only the “privileged few” who have faith or been anointed by their guru can

“not concentrating enough” or “not having enough faith.”

Maxwell did not live to witness the materialization of his mathematical prediction. He died
of stomach cancer at the relatively young age of 48 in 1879, the year Einstein was born.
Had he lived out a normal life expectancy, he would have witnessed the production of EM
waves by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, the invention of the radio by Marconi in 1901, and the
evolution of his theory—in the hands of Albert Einstein—into one of the most signiﬁcant
discoveries of all time, the theory of relativity.
Today we can truly appreciate the indispensability of electromagnetism. Every radio or
television set, every telephone, every computer, every large or small appliance in our homes,
in short, every aspect of our contemporary civilization, one way or the other, has its roots
in Maxwell’s theory. As the American physicist Richard Feynman noted, “in the far future,

landmark of the
nineteenth century.
when the historians look back at the 19th century and scrutinize the events that took place
between 1800 and 1899, they will undoubtedly choose Maxwell’s uniﬁcation of electricity
and magnetism as the landmark of that century.” All the political, economic, and social
upheavals such as the Napoleonic wars or the American Civil War will be dwarfed into
insigniﬁcance next to the discovery of electromagnetism.
A question often asked is “Why should we support research, especially if it is extremely
expensive and has no immediate application?” Why should the tax payer’s money go into
fundamental research, such as high energy physics, requiring accelerators that cost millions
(sometimes billions) of dollars? These researches aim at ﬁnding the ultimate structure of
matter beyond molecules, atoms, and nuclei; researches whose results will deﬁnitely not

book has a very good answer. If the founders of electromagnetism were concerned with its
application and practicality, if ¨Orsted had stopped his research on the eﬀect of the electric
current on magnets, Faraday had not diligently pursued his idea of electrical induction, and
Maxwell had curbed his mathematical investigation of electromagnetism because they could
not foresee any practical application of their research, we would still be burning candles to
light our darkness.

Thermodynamics


Chapter16
Introduction to Probability
The third branch of post-Renaissance physics that started to develop at about the same time
as the other two (mechanics and electromagnetism) is thermodynamics. It is amazing that,
as soon as the chains of the Dark Ages were broken, the seeds of all areas of modern physics
were planted almost simultaneously. Galileo, who gave birth to the science of mechanics,
also launched the investigation of the properties of heat.
A serious investigation of thermodynamics, however, did not take place until the latter
part of the eighteenth century, when thermometry became an art in which many scientists
and entrepreneurs took part. The invention of the steam engine and the scientiﬁc exami-
nation of its operation had a profound eﬀect on the development of thermodynamics. In
fact, the second law of thermodynamics (which came before the ﬁrst law!) was discovered
in an attempt at improving steam engines. The laws as well as the methodology behind
their discovery were completely phenomenological and, at times, mysterious.
By the middle of the nineteenth century it became increasingly plausible to assume that
all substances were made up of particles which obey the laws of mechanics. No knowledge
of the internal structure of these particles was either available or necessary for the study
of the bulk matter. Any sample of matter was assumed to contain a very large number of
these particles, and while an exact study of such a large collection of objects was impossible,
this drawback became an opportunity to apply statistical methods to the sample, giving
birth to statistical mechanics, which in turn shed light on the sources of the laws of
thermodynamics and unveiled the mysteries of the phenomenological studies. To understand
statistical mechanics, we have to know something about the fundamentals of probability
theory, the subject of this chapter.
16.1
Basic Concepts
Probability is the mathematical investigation of random events. We have a good intuitive
feeling of what a random event is, and this intuition is suﬃcient for our discussion. Examples
of random events are the outcome of the throw of a die, of drawing a card from a deck of
playing cards, and the toss of a coin.
The latter is going to be the main focus of our
attention in this chapter.
Let us start with a single coin. It is clear that the number of possible outcomes for
a toss is 2: One head H and one tail T. We also say that the frequency of one H is 1 and
that of one T (or zero H) is also 1. Probability is the ratio of the frequency to the total
number of outcomes. Thus, the probability of 1 H is 1/2 and the probability of 0 H is also
1/2, and the sum of all probabilities is 1.

230
Chapter 16
Introduction to Probability
What do you know? 16.1. What is the probability of drawing a red card from a
deck of cards? Drawing a diamond? A king?
Now consider two identical coins.
The possible outcomes are: (H,H), (H,T), (T,H),
(T,T), where the ﬁrst entry represents the outcome of the ﬁrst coin and the second entry
that of the second coin. Thus, the total number of outcomes is 4, the frequency for two H’s
is 1, for one H is 2, and for zero H is also 1. Therefore, the probability of zero H is 1/4,
which is also the probability of 2 H, while the probability of 1 H is 2/4 or 1/2.
For 3 coins the possible outcomes are: (H,H,H), (H,H,T), (H,T,H), (T,H,H), (H,T,T),
(T,H,T), (T,T,H), (T,T,T). Therefore, the total number of outcomes is 8, the frequency for
three H’s is 1, for two H’s is 3, for one H is also 3, and for zero H is 1. With obvious notation,
we therefore write P(0) = 1/8, P(1) = 3/8, P(2) = 3/8, and P(3) = 1/8. Example D.16.1
on page 38 of Appendix.pdf calculates the probabilities for four coins.
Can we generalize the arguments above to the case of many coins? In other words, can
we derive a formula that ﬁnds the probability Pn(m) of getting m heads in tossing n coins?
The answer is yes, and Math Note E.16.1 on page 98 of Appendix.pdf shows how to ﬁnd
this general formula. That math note also shows the symmetry of the probability function
about n/2: the probability of getting n/2 + x heads in tossing n coins is the same as the
probability of getting n/2 −x heads for any positive integer x.
What do you know? 16.2. What is P10(3), the probability of getting 3 heads in
tossing 10 coins? What is P10(7)?

Figure 16.1: Plots of the probability distribution for the throw of 20, 50, 100, and 1000 coins. You can
read oﬀm−and m+ for each plot from the ﬁgure. Note how the graph becomes narrower as the number
of coins increases. Note also how the maximum probability decreases as the number of coins increases.
It is convenient to plot the probability function versus the number of heads. Figure 16.1
shows the plot for 20, 50, 100, and 1000 coins. A few features of these plots are worthy
of closer attention.
First note that all plots have a common shape; in particular, they
have a maximum at half the number of coins. This means that for any number of coins, the
probability of obtaining half of them as heads is the greatest. Next note that the probability
of getting a number of heads which is too much diﬀerent from half the coins is so small
that it cannot be plotted diﬀerently from zero. Denote by m−and m+ the values of m

such that Pn(m) is “negligible” when m < m−or m > m+. The word “negligible” in the

present context means “indistinguishable from zero on a plot.” In the throw of 20 coins
the probability of getting 3 heads or less, or 17 heads or more is negligible as shown in
Figure 16.1. Thus m−= 3 and m+ = 17 for n = 20. Similarly, the same ﬁgure shows that
m−= 12 and m+ = 38 for n = 50; m−= 33 and m+ = 67 for n = 100; and m−= 440 and
m+ = 560 for n = 1000.
16.2
Distribution Plots
The probability plots, also called probability distributions, can best be studied once
we deﬁne some quantities. The absolute width ∆n of the probability curve of n coins
is the width of the plot on the horizontal axis, i.e., the diﬀerence between m+ and m−:
∆n = m+ −m−. The relative width δn of the probability curve, is the absolute width

probability curve.
divided by the number of coins: δn ≡∆n/n. Use the values of m+ and m−found above
and obtain δ20 = 0.7, δ50 = 0.52, δ100 = 0.34, and δ1000 = 0.12.
What is the signiﬁcance of δn? Suppose we plot the probability distribution of n coins on
a graph where the horizontal axis, whose range is 0 to n, is 10 cm long (slightly less than the
width of the text you are reading right now). Then the width of the plot in centimeters—
which we denote by x—is obtained by proportionality: (10 cm)/(n coins) = x/(∆n coins).
This yields x = 10∆n/n or x = 10δn cm. It is now clear that δn is proportional to the width
of the graph of the probability distribution plot. This is clearly indicated in Figure 16.1.
Figure 16.2 shows the distributions for large numbers of coins. This set of plots diﬀers
very little from the set in Figure 16.1. What is not apparent from these ﬁgures is the sharp
decrease in the quantity δn for larger n, because we have plotted points that are very close
to the maximum to be able to read the values of m+ and m−. In other words, we have
zoomed in on the middle of the plot. In Table 16.1 we record δn for Figures 16.1 and 16.2.
This table indicates that as the number of coins increases, the width of the probability
distribution curve—which is proportional to δn, as stated above—decreases.

1,000,000 (right) coins.
Note that the nonzero probabilities are concentrated in regions close to the
maximum (half the number of coins).
The ﬁgures are more than just a pictorial representation of raw data. To appreciate them,
let us consider 10 coins and turn the ﬁgure into a bar graph as shown in Figure 16.3(a).
The area of each bar signiﬁes the probability of getting the corresponding number of heads
in the throw of 10 coins. If we are interested in the probability of getting between 3 and

7 heads, we just add the areas of the bars. The shaded area in Figure 16.3(a) gives this
probability. The total area should add up to one. Thus to get the probabilities, we should
really divide the area of interest by the total area. How does the area of interest compare
with the corresponding area under the probability curve? For 10 coins the area of the bars
between 3 and 7 heads is very diﬀerent from the area under the curve between those values.
However, as the number of coins increases, the diﬀerence between the area of the bars and
the area under the curve decreases. For example, if one compares the area of the bars for

Figure 16.3: A bar graph shows the relation between probability and area. (a) The area is probability of
ﬁnding between 3 and 8 heads in a throw of 10 coins. (b) The area is probability of ﬁnding between 20

the number of heads between 20 and 33 in a throw of 50 coins with the area under the
probability curve, the horizontal axis, and the two vertical lines corresponding to m = 20
and m = 33, one ﬁnds that the two are almost equal [see Figure 16.3(b)]. This equality
becomes more and more pronounced as the number of coins gets larger and larger.
Box 16.2.1. For a large number of coins, the probability that the number of heads
turning up is between m1 and m2 is the area under the probability curve between the
two vertical lines corresponding to m1 and m2 divided by the total area.
We deﬁned m−and m+ as values of m, beyond which probability drops to (almost)
zero on the distribution plot. This deﬁnition is inaccurate, because it relies on reading a
value very close to zero on a plot. We make the deﬁnition more precise by saying that the
probability is negligible if its value is less than one millionth of the maximum probability. In
symbols, Pn(m±) = 10−6Pn(n/2), because probability is maximum at n/2. Starting with
this deﬁnition, you can obtain m−and m+ in terms of n. Math Note E.16.2 on page
99 of Appendix.pdf provides the details.
By their very deﬁnition, m−and m+ bound a large fraction of the total probability. How
large? The area between m−and m+ can be calculated numerically with great precision.
It can be shown that in our case this area is 99.999985% of the total area! This means
that the probability of getting a number of heads larger than m+ or smaller than m−is
1 −0.99999985 = 0.00000015 or 1.5 parts in 10 million! For n = 1, 000, 000 this means that
the probability of getting more than 502,630 heads or fewer than 497,370 heads1 is only
1.5 × 10−7.
Probabilities are meaningful and practical only when we repeat the same experiment
many times. When we say that the probability of a certain event E in an experiment is
0.001, we mean that if the experiment is repeated 1000 times, on the average, E occurs
only once. Repeating the experiment 10,000 times results in about 10 E’s, and in 1,000,000
experiments approximately 1000 E’s will show up. In general,
1These numbers come from Equation (E.23) in Math Note E.16.2.

Table 16.1: n is the number of coins, m−is the number of heads at which the plot is (almost) zero on
the left of the maximum, m+ is the corresponding zero on the right, ∆n is the diﬀerence between m+ and
m−, and δn is ∆n/n. Note that δn gets smaller as n gets larger.
Box 16.2.2. When we say that the probability of a certain event E in an experiment is
p, we mean that if the experiment is repeated N times (where N is suﬃciently large),
on the average, E occurs pN times. We write this as
number of successes = pN.
In particular, if we want to see E occur once, i.e., if we want one success, then N must
equal 1/p.
In the experiment of tossing a million coins, when we say that the probability of getting
less than 498,000 or more than 502,000 H’s is negligible (see Figure 16.2 or Table 16.1),
we mean that if we toss 1,000,000 coins many many times, we will almost never see the
number of heads to be smaller than 498,000 or larger than 502,000; equivalently, if we toss
1,000,000 coins many many times the number of heads almost always is between 498,000
and 502,000. Since both 498,000 and 502,000 are very close to 500,000, we can restate the
above result as: In many many tosses of 1,000,000 coins, the number of heads is (almost)
always something extremely close to 500,000. Math Note E.16.2 quantiﬁes some of these
discussions and concludes that for larger and larger number of coins:
• There is less and less chance of getting exactly half heads.
• Getting anything else is even less probable.
• If m > m+ or m < m−, then getting m heads is completely hopeless.
If the chance of getting n/2 (corresponding to the maximum probability) is negligible,
and the chance of getting anything else is even more negligible, what do we get when we
throw n coins? As n increases, so does the diﬀerence between m−and m+. In fact, from
Math Note E.16.2, the number of heads lying between m−and m+—what we denoted by
∆n—is simply 5.26√n, which is clearly an increasing function of n. This increase in m+−m−
compensates the decrease in the probabilities of the number of heads in this interval, so that
the total probability is always 0.99999985. In short, although the probability of getting any
individual number of heads between m−and m+ decreases with increasing n, there are so
many probabilities between these two values that, when you add the little contribution of
each, you get a signiﬁcant total.

Chapter 16
Introduction to Probability
What do you know? 16.3. How do you compare the probability of getting 500 heads
in tossing 1000 coins with the probability of getting 5000 heads in tossing 10,000 coins?
How do you compare the probability of getting 440 heads in tossing 1000 coins with
the probability of getting 4400 heads in tossing 10,000 coins? Hint: For the second
question, see Table 16.1.
16.3
The Law of Large Numbers
Let us now talk about an experiment which, although unwieldy, is in principle possible,
and can shed some light on the subject. A typical physics experiment involves a very larger
number of atoms participating in a large number of events. In our experiment, coins replace
atoms and tosses replace events: We toss a trillion coins and count the number of heads
that turn up in each toss. Expecting the result to be a number close to half the number
of coins, i.e., 5 × 1011, we continue until we get a number of heads that is “signiﬁcantly”
diﬀerent from 5 × 1011. How long before this happens?
What do you know? 16.4. Compare ∆n for 10 million and 100 million coins. Do
the same with δn. Hint: See Table 16.1 for the trend.
First, let us estimate the time required to perform such an experiment. Assume that we
ask all the working adult population of the US to participate in the counting as a substitute
for their job, counting coins eight hours a day. Then, as Math Note E.16.3 on page
101 of Appendix.pdf calculates, for 10,000 trials, it will take over three years to perform
the experiment, assuming that everybody can count at the rate of 3 coins per second! The
reader may object that 10,000 trials is an overkill. However, it will become clear that well
over 10,000 trials are needed to get a head count that is even slightly diﬀerent from 5×1011.
Clearly, even ignoring the potential mistakes of bad counters, this version of the experiment
is not plausible, and we have to look for a better version.
A slightly more practical alternative is to paint one side (say the tail) of each penny
white and the other side black, load them on cargo planes, ﬂy the planes to a high enough
altitude, drop the coins in a ﬂat desert, observe them from above, and check for “grayness.”
There are some “technical” diﬃculties, such as the enormity of the number of cargo planes
(approximately 50), the size of the area used (about 40 square miles), the background color
(color of the ground) which may interfere with grayness measurement, the fact that some
pennies may be hiding behind others, and so on. We shall ignore such diﬃculties, because
they are more manageable than the diﬃculties of the ﬁrst method.
How does “grayness” measure the number of heads? Assume we are so far above the
ground that the area covered with black and white pennies appears as only one square
foot. Then a perfect gray square foot of area corresponds to half white and half black. In
other words, if exactly half of the coins were head and half tail and they were arranged
alternately side by side, we would see a shade of gray which we call perfect. If we shake
the coins thoroughly before throwing them, chances are that white and black coins will
approximately alternate once they land, and the odds of a large number of coins of the
same color landing next to each other are very small.
The question asked at the end of the ﬁrst paragraph of this section can now be rephrased:
What are the chances of seeing anything but a perfect gray? An imperfect gray would have
a shade of black or white as a result of an imbalance between the number of heads and tails.
Let us take a shade of black, and ask the question: How many more black sides (than white
sides) should turn up before the eye can distinguish this shade of black? The following
example answers this question.

Section 16.3
The Law of Large Numbers
235
Example 16.3.1. Let us digress from coin tossing and get our hands dirty with paint mixing!
The resolution of the eye in distinguishing various shades of gray varies from person to person.
Assume that we can ﬁnd somebody whose eyes are sharp enough to distinguish between perfect
gray and the shade obtained when one drop of black paint is added to a gallon of perfect gray.
Such an ability is very unlikely, but to be on the safe side, let us assume that such a person exists.
However, we assume this is the limit. Thus by mixing less than one drop of black with a gallon of
gray, we get a shade that is indistinguishable from perfect gray.
What is the ratio of black to white? There is half a gallon plus one drop of black and exactly
half a gallon of white. There are approximately 100,000 drops in a gallon. Out of these, 50,000
are black and 50,000 are white when the paint is perfect gray. Adding one black drop changes the
ratio to 50, 001/50, 000 = 1.00002.
Going back to the coins, we conclude that, to be able to distinguish the shade of black, the ratio
of the number of black coins to white coins must be the ratio obtained above, namely 1.00002. Since
the total number of coins is one trillion, the actual number of black heads must be 500,005,000,000
leaving 499,995,000,000 white tails. The ratio of these two numbers is easily seen to be 1.00002 as
desired.

Food for Thought
FFT 16.3.2. We live by the rules of chance. Every time we step outside, there is a nonzero
probability that we will get hit by a car, and another nonzero probability that once hit, we will
die. Every time we go to the countryside, there is a chance that we will be struck by lightning.
This chance increases in a thunderstorm, but even a sunny day can get cloudy quickly and provide
a good condition for lightnings. As you2 are sitting in your living room watching television, there
is a nonzero probability that the small plane ﬂying overhead will plummet into your house. There
is about 0.03% chance that you will contract cancer this year, and once diagnosed, a 40% chance
that you will die from it.
Unlike the tossing of coins, these probabilities cannot be calculated a priori, but a collection of
data over many years can give a reliable magnitude for them. In fact, the ﬁgures of 0.03% and 40%
were obtained from the data collected by the American Cancer Society over decades. These data
consist of the number of new cases of cancer and the number of deaths caused by cancer every year.
Using Box 16.2.2 in reverse—i.e., dividing the number of cases by the total population—can give
you a very good estimate of the probability. For example, over the last few years, the number of
new cases of cancer has been stable at about 1.2 million per year in the US. Similarly, the number
of cancer deaths has been equally steady: about half a million per year. Of course, diet, exercise,
and annual check-ups can reduce the risk (from 0.03% to 0.02% or even 0.01%), but can neither
eliminate it nor contradict the fact that contracting cancer is probabilistic.
Not only is the occurrence of the disasters above totally probabilistic, but also surviving them.
The probability that, with all proper treatments, a cancer patient will survive ﬁve years after being
diagnosed is about 60%. This survival probability decreases as the amount of treatment is reduced
and/or the period after diagnosis is increased, but it does not become exactly zero. Even at the
extreme case of no treatment at all, the probability of surviving for a long time and the complete
disappearance of cancer is not zero. The body itself has a mechanism of ﬁghting the disease, and
although most people’s bodies lose the battle without outside help, the composition of the bodies
of some patients is such that no outside help is necessary in the ﬁght.
The survivor, of course, sees this completely diﬀerently.
She looks at herself as one of the
very few survivors of the disaster that kills hundreds of thousands of people.
She thinks that

the world.
So, a nightmare involving a car accident severely injuring a relative should not be
uncommon. Even if the probability—p of Box 16.2.2—of the coincidence of the dream and the real
event is very small, with the population of the Earth approaching seven billion, and the number
of dreams a typical person experiences in a lifetime being approximately 100,000, the N of Box
16.2.2 approaches 7×1014. Therefore, it should come as no surprise to hear genuine stories of such
coincidences on a daily basis.
The lesson to learn from Box 16.2.2 is that, no matter how small the chance of the occurrence
of some very unlikely event, as long as the population of the sample is large enough, there will be at
least a few cases of that unlikely event. There is no need for introducing “miracles” and supernatural
powers; the theory of probability and statistics can explain the unlikely event convincingly.
16.3.1
Law of Large Numbers in Numbers
The example above tells us that for an ideal sharp eye to see a shade of black which is
minimally diﬀerent from perfect gray, at least 500,005,000,000 heads must turn up in a toss
of a trillion coins. Similarly, for the same eye to see a minimal shade of white, at most
499,995,000,000 heads must turn up. Putting these two statements together, we can say:
for the sharpest eye to see anything but perfect gray, the number of heads must be larger
than 500,005 million or smaller than 499,995 million.
What are the chances that in a random throw of a trillion coins, the number of heads
is larger than 500,005,000,000 or smaller than 499,995,000,000? Using Equation (E.21) and
a suﬃciently accurate computer program, the probability can be calculated. The result is
the staggeringly small value of 1.5×10−23! Box 16.2.2 now tells us that, in order to see one
occurrence (N = 1) of a non-perfect gray outcome, on the average, we have to throw the
coins 1/1.5 × 10−23 or 6.67 × 1022 times.
Let us rephrase this conclusion in a more comprehensible language: If we perform the
same experiment (loading the 50 cargo planes, ﬂying them to high altitudes, and dropping
the black and white coins onto a desert) 6.67 × 1022 times, while the sharp-eyed observer
is looking on, only once can he decide that the resulting color is not perfect gray. In the
remaining times he will judge the color to be perfect gray!
Let’s make this conclusion even more tangible. Imagine small coins. Very small coins!
So small that a trillion of them can ﬁt in an ordinary salt shaker. Put our black and white
microscopic coins in a salt shaker, shake them, pour them, and spread them on a table top.
Do all this in the presence of the sharp-eyed observer. Keep pouring and spreading the
coins and ask him for the shade. His answer is almost always the same, perfect gray.
How long do you have to wait before he sees a shade of white or black? Well, it depends
on how fast you can ﬁll up the shaker, pour it, and spread the coins on the table top.
Manual operation cannot be fast enough to give our sharp-eyed observer a chance to see a
non-perfect gray. So, let us automate the entire process. After shopping around for a while,
we ﬁnd a machine that is really fast: it can ﬁll the shaker, pour the content, and spread it
on the table top 100,000 times a second! Remember that in order for our observer to see
any shade of black or white, on the average we have to do the experiment 6.67×1022 times.
This requires 6.67 × 1017 seconds. Since there are 3.15 × 107 seconds in a year, we would
have to wait 2.1 × 1010 years, or 21 billion years. The age of the universe is 13.7 billion
years!
Is there a supernatural
power, an invisible hand,
that ﬂips the coins so we
get perfect gray all the
time?
This is a baﬄingly counter-intuitive result.
There are practically an inﬁnite variety
of shades of gray, from pure black to pure white.
However, every time the experiment
is performed, the result is perfect gray! Why is it that out of such an inﬁnite variety of
shades only the perfect gray shows up? Is there some kind of an “invisible hand” that
purposefully arranges the coins so that the number of heads matches almost exactly with
the number of tails?
If we had not gone through the theory of probability, we would
have suspected the intervention of an invisible hand. Such a suspicion could easily lead to
superstition and the invention of the supernatural. However, as shown in this section, the

persistent appearance of perfect gray is nothing but the manifestation of the blind force of
mathematical probability. After all, each individual coin has a completely random 50-50
chance of showing up as a head or a tail.
16.3.2
Summary of the Law of Large Numbers
We have spent a great deal of time on probability theory of coins. Although intrinsically
interesting and worthy of study, the theory will be useful only if we generalize it in two
ways. First, the experimentation with coins is only a prototype of more general experiments
studied in probability theory which deals with distributions. A distribution is a function
Probability distribution.
or a rule which gives the probability of events. An example of distribution is the function
Pn(m) which gives the probability that m heads show up in a throw of n coins. We say that
the most probable outcome for this distribution is m = n/2. Other terminologies used for
“most probable” are expectation value, average, and mean. Using these terminologies,
we generalize the important conclusion drawn from our long discussion of coins as follows:
Box 16.3.3. (Law of Large Numbers) For a suﬃciently large number of random
events, the probability of getting anything that is practically distinguishable from the
expectation value is immeasurably small.
This law is sometimes elegantly stated as individual chaos leads to collective determinism.
Secondly, in any physical experiment involving matter, the number of events is so large
that the requirement imposed by the qualiﬁer “large enough number” is very easily satisﬁed.
There are approximately 1022 atoms in a liter of any gas at ordinary temperatures and pres-
sures. This number is 1010 or ten billion times larger than the number of coins used in our
hypothetical experiment. Such a large number makes the observation of any deviation from
the expected average behavior of the gas absolutely impossible as the following argument
reveals.
In our trillion-coin experiment, we noted that for the sharp-eyed observer to see a devi-
ation from expected behavior, 5,000,000 extra heads (or tails) must turn up. This number
was achieved by having in mind a device (the sharp-eyed observer) which could detect a de-
viation of one part in 100,000 (one drop in a gallon). Let us assume that for a liter of gas, we
have a very sensitive instrument that can detect deviations of one part in a billion (a device
that is at the forefront of our technology). For 1022 atoms the “extra” number required for
the abnormal behavior of a liter of gas detectable by such an ultra-sensitive device is easily
calculated to be 5 × 1012. The probability of such an aberration is 3 × 10−2174! This means
that to see the aberration just once, you need to perform the experiments 1/3 × 10−2174 or
3.33×102173 times (see Box 16.2.2). Even if we could perform the experiment a billion times
per second,3 it would take 3.33 × 102164 seconds, or 102157 years to see a single occurrence
of the aberration. This is 7.3×102146 (73 with 2145 zeros in front of it) times the age of the
universe! Hence, we can safely say that every time we observe a property of bulk matter,
we expect nothing but its average behavior.
Food for Thought
FFT 16.3.4. The law of large numbers demands a great leap away from our intuition. Perfect
gray all the time? (OK, not all the time, but a waiting period of 21 billion years for it not to
happen!) How can it be? There are so many other shades of gray in a throw of a trillion black-
and-white coins. Why are all these shades absent?
3There is a limit—imposed by relativity theory—to how fast physical processes can take place.

Chapter 16
Introduction to Probability
Questions like these are the manifestation of our desire to ﬁnd a cause for any observable eﬀect,
a desire that can lead us astray. “When the outcome of every single experiment is consistently
the same,” we may argue, “there must be a reason for it.” We have a fairly good intuition for
probability as long as the number of random events is kept low. We are not surprised to see the
outcome of a throw of ten coins clustered around ﬁve. However, we expect to see three, four, six,
and seven as well, and indeed we do observe them. Not as frequently as ﬁve, but nevertheless they
are frequent enough to be seen. But, when the same laws of mathematics—with the same degree of
exactness and impartiality—tell us that, as the number of random events increases considerably, it
is impossible to see anything that is ever so slightly diﬀerent from the average, we start to question
the laws.
This questioning is replaced by sheer disbelief when people unaware of the underlying laws
encounter the same situation. “If there are such a large number of black and white coins,” they
say, “we should observe many diﬀerent shades of gray. And if we see the same exact shade of
perfect gray over and over,” they continue, “then there must be some kind of an ‘invisible hand’
that is turning the coins to the same ﬁnal outcome. There must be some kind of supernatural
force. How else can so many other possibilities—shades of gray—disappear?”
Yet the same simple mathematical formulas of Math Note E.16.1, which predict the “accept-
able” results of a small number of coins, also predict the seemingly unacceptable content of the
law of large numbers. As seen before, when the number of coins gets larger and larger, the non-
negligible probabilities cluster closer and closer to the average value. For an extremely large number
of coins, this clustering becomes so close to the average that it renders any diﬀerentiation between
the average (perfect gray) and all the neighboring values practically impossible. No invisible hand
is needed to explain this. It is just the natural outcome of a large collection of random events.
There is a minor diﬀerence between probability distribution in matter and that of simple
coin ﬂips. In the latter case the number of possible outcomes is two while in the former this
number is very large, in fact, inﬁnite. For example, a molecule of oxygen moving through
the room can have speeds ranging from zero to the maximum possible speed (speed of light).
Thus the number of possible outcomes in a speed-measurement experiment is inﬁnite. It
turns out that this complication is not crucial in the large-number behavior of matter
discussed above. However, it allows many possibilities for the average. In the case of the
coins, we had only a single average outcome when their number grew indeﬁnitely: The
outcome was always gray when we tossed 1012 identical black-and-white coins.4
To allow for other shades of gray, keeping all elemental “units” identical, we have to
change the units completely, say to dice. If we color 3 sides of dice white and 3 sides black,
we get perfect gray as the expected color. Coloring 4 sides white and 2 sides black gives a
whitish gray which we quantify as 2/3 white. If, instead, 5 sides are white and 1 side black,
we get a 5/6-white gray. Similarly, we can get 2/3-black and 5/6-black shades of gray color.
In all cases, all dice are identical.
It is now clear that if the number of possible outcomes for each elemental unit increases,
the variety of the averages also increases. In particular, if this number becomes inﬁnite, an
inﬁnite variety of averages will become possible. This means that an inﬁnity of average-speed
values will become possible for molecules in a gas. We shall see later that this average speed
is related to the temperature of a gas. Therefore, the temperature of a gas can assume an
inﬁnite number of values. If there were only two possible outcomes in a speed-measurement
experiment, corresponding to the two outcomes of a coin-ﬂip, then the temperature of a gas
would always be the same, corresponding to the single average of a trillion coins, perfect
gray. The large number of possible outcomes for the elemental units is responsible for the
inﬁnite range of values that a typical bulk variable, such as temperature or pressure, can
assume.
4The word “identical” is important. By coloring both sides of some coins black, we could obtain other
shades of gray than perfect, but the coins would not be identical. In nature, all elementary components of
matter are identical.

Answers to “What do you know?”
16.1. There are 26 red cards in a deck of 52. So, assuming equal probability for all cards,
the probability for drawing a red card is 26/52 or 0.5. There are 13 diamonds in a deck, so
the probability of drawing a diamond is 13/52 or 0.25. The probability of drawing a king
is 4/52 or 0.0769, because there are 4 kings in the deck.
16.2. Using the formula in Math Note E.16.1, we get P10(3) = 10!/(3!(10−3)!210) or 0.117,
which is also equal to the probability P10(7). The equality of these two probabilities is a
special case of the symmetry of the probability distribution curve about half the number of
coins: P10(5 −2) = P10(5 + 2).
16.3. The probability of getting exactly half the number of coins decreases with increasing
n. Therefore, the probability of getting 500 heads in tossing 1000 coins is larger than the
probability of getting 5000 heads in tossing 10,000 coins. Table 16.1 shows that 440 is the
value of m−for 1000 coins. However, 4400 is far to the left of 4840, the value of m−for
10,000 coins. So, we expect the probability of getting 440 heads in tossing 1000 coins to be
larger than the probability of getting 4400 heads in tossing 10,000 coins.
16.4.
Table 16.1 shows that ∆n increases for larger number of coins while δn decreases.
So, we expect the ∆n for 100 million coins to be larger than ∆n for 10 million coins. On
the other hand, δn for 100 million coins is smaller than δn for 10 million coins.

Statistical Mechanics
The task of statistical mechanics is to “explain” thermodynamics by means of the basic
assumption that all substances are made up of particles—atoms or molecules—obeying the
laws of motion. As a model, we shall take an ideal gas, in which there are no internal

forces among its constituent particles. This means that kinetic energy is the only kind of
energy a typical particle has.
17.1
Ideal Gas Law
The simplest application of statistical mechanics is ﬁnding the pressure of a gas in terms
of its other properties. The pressure a gas exerts on the walls of its container is the per-
pendicular force on the wall divided by the area on which the force is applied [Equation
(8.6)]. From a microscopic viewpoint, the force is caused by the transfer of momentum of
the particles to the wall per unit time (Box 7.2.1). This transfer occurs when the particles
collide with the wall of the container. The following example should shed some light on the
discussion.
Example 17.1.1. Consider a large rectangular sheet of rubber fastened at all sides, just like a
trampoline. Suppose that we throw heavy balls at this sheet which we assume is held vertically
[Figure 17.1(a)]. Let us throw the ﬁrst ball. As soon as the ball hits the sheet, the sheet’s side
view will look like Figure 17.1(b). Because of its elasticity, the sheet will spring back to its original
conﬁguration, throwing the ball back, oscillating back and forth a few times, and ﬁnally coming to
rest in position (c) in the ﬁgure. Now suppose we throw more and more balls more and more rapidly.
Let us say that the balls always hit two points on the sheet designated A and B in Figure 17.1(d).
If the balls arrive at A and B fast enough, the shape of the sheet will remain as (d) because the
sheet will not get a chance to recuperate from its deformation.
Finally, assume that the balls come rapidly and at random so that all points of the sheet are
exposed to the oncoming balls with equal probability. Then, the shape of the sheet will look like
Figure 17.1(e), i.e., it is uniformly bulged (inﬂated) just like a tire or a balloon. The larger the
speed of the balls, the deeper the bulge of the sheet. By throwing the balls rapidly enough, we can
“explode” the sheet!
■
Intuitively, the more particles we have in the gas, the more collisions take place, and
the more pressure is exerted on the walls. Similarly, the faster the particles move the more
frequently they collide with the walls, and the more pressure they create. Therefore, pressure
should depend on both the number of particles and their speed. Math Note E.17.1 on
page 101 of Appendix.pdf explains how this intuition can be made more precise.
Two results of Math Note E.17.1 are important enough to merit further discussion here.

Example 17.1.2. Equation (17.1) explains why a system cools down upon evaporation, as for
example, the cool feeling we get when a breeze caresses our wet body at a beach. The breeze
simply enhances evaporation. In any evaporation process molecules of the system are lost to the
surrounding. Those molecules that are moving faster in the system have a better chance of escaping
from the system. Thus, the faster molecules escape our skin upon evaporation leaving behind the
more sluggish water molecules. The average kinetic energy of the remaining molecules is less than
before, and therefore, the temperature of our skin drops.

the hot object cools down and the cold object warms up. Explain this from an atomic

average speed—also called the root mean square or rms speed—of the particles of a gas.

the root mean square speed of helium to be over 1000 m/s.

Ideal Gas Law
245
Historically, the ideal gas law was derived empirically, and the subsequent derivation of
this law as outlined in Math Note E.17.1 was one of the triumphs of atomism and statistical
mechanics. As early as 1787, through the work of people like Robert Boyle (1627–1691) and
Jacque Alexandre Charles (1746–1823), it was shown empirically that for any given sample
of gas the ratio PV/T was always a constant.
BIOGRAPHY
Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), the father of statistical mechanics, was awarded a doctorate from
the University of Vienna in 1866 for a thesis on the kinetic theory of gases. He taught at Graz, moved
to Heidelberg and then to Berlin. Boltzmann, at least half jokingly, used to say that the reason he
moved around so much was that he was born during the dying hours of a Mardi Gras ball. In 1873, he
accepted the chair of mathematics at Vienna, but three years later he moved back to Graz. However, the
following year Ernst Mach became the chair of history and philosophy of science at Vienna. Boltzmann
had many scientiﬁc opponents but Mach was more than a scientiﬁc opponent as the two were on bad
personal terms. Because of this, Boltzmann moved to Leipzig in 1900 but there he was close to one
of his strongest scientiﬁc opponents, Wilhelm Ostwald. Despite their scientiﬁc diﬀerences Boltzmann
and Ostwald were on good personal terms. However, his scientiﬁc arguments with Ostwald led to a
severe depression in Boltzmann, to the point that he unsuccessfully attempted suicide during his time in
Leipzig. In 1901 Mach retired from Vienna due to ill health, and this gave Boltzmann an opportunity to
go back to Vienna. In 1902 he returned to Vienna to his chair of theoretical physics which had not been
ﬁlled in the intervening period. Boltzmann had a soft-hearted personality, and his ideas of introducing
probability into physics was not well-received. He was far ahead of his time. The enormous progress
in today’s physicists’ understanding of thermodynamics is solely due to its foundation in statistical
mechanics, which Boltzmann created almost singe-handedly.
What do you know? 17.3. A mixture of He and Ne atoms has a temperature of
300 K. Which atoms have higher average KE? Which atoms move faster on the average?
In 1802 Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778–1850) empirically showed that at a given pres-
sure, say one atmosphere, the volumes of certain speciﬁc weights of gases increased by
exactly the same amount per degree increase in temperature. For example, 1 gram of hy-
drogen, 16 grams of oxygen, or 44 grams of carbon dioxide all expand at exactly the same
rate. In 1811 Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856) came up with the brilliant idea that the reason
for such a striking similarity between all gases is that the weights quoted above represent
the same number of molecules. He noted that if one assumed that there were no attraction
between molecules of a gas, and one ignored the size of the molecules, then as long as one
had the same number of molecules in a given volume, one had to obtain identical results
for all gases. So he concluded that 1 gram of hydrogen must contain as many molecules as
16 grams of oxygen and 44 grams of carbon dioxide. This number, now called Avogadro’s

Most Probable Conﬁguration
Before applying statistics to a mechanical system, let’s review how the system is described
exactly. The discussion of Section 10.2 led us to conclude that if we know the position and
velocity (or, equivalently, momentum) of every particle in a system at a particular time, we
can predict its behavior for all future times (see Box 10.2.1). When the particles of a system

take on speciﬁc values for their positions and velocities (momenta), we say the system is in
a speciﬁc state. The conclusion of Section 10.2 can be reworded as follows: If we know the
state of a system at one time, we can determine its state at any other time.
Picture the development of a system, say a gallon of air, as time passes.
Imagine
observing this system again and again, and each time taking a mental snapshot of the state
of the system. You would then have a large collection of snapshots showing the locations
of each air molecule and—since the picture is mental—its momentum (velocity) at various
times. In principle, the laws of motion can predict the content of each snapshot precisely. In
practice such a prediction is impossible (due to the large number of particles in the gas) and
irrelevant (because the speciﬁc details of the system do not show up in its bulk properties).
The task of statistical mechanics is to ﬁnd the probability of each snapshot.
Use the knowledge of the theory of probability gained in Chapter 16 in the treatment
of the present chapter, except for one caveat. In Chapter 16, we did not have to worry
about any physical constraints that might be imposed on the system. The random events
(the coin outcomes) could turn up in any possible way. Here, we have to impose certain
restrictions. In the case of a gas, for example, the particles are conﬁned within a volume,
so their position cannot take on any arbitrary value. Similarly, the kinetic energy (hence,
velocity) of particles cannot be completely arbitrary because the sum total of the kinetic
energies of all particles must be a constant due to energy conservation. Because of such
constraints we speak of accessible states rather than possible states: An accessible state
Accessible state deﬁned.
of a system is any state of the system which respects the constraints imposed on it such
as volume limitations and energy conservation. We denote the total number of accessible
states by Ω.
Example 17.2.1. To put some concrete ﬂesh on the abstract bones of the preceding discussion,
go back to the simple system consisting of, say 10 coins. However, instead of H and T, assign the
values +1 and −1 to the sides of a coin, and ﬁnd the total (algebraic) number showing up. This
number is clearly between −10 (when all coins show up with −1) to +10 (when all show up with
+1). It is clear that the most probable outcome is that for which we have equal numbers of +1
and −1, i.e., when the total is zero. This calculation assumes no constraint on energy, or any other
physical quantity: There is an unlimited supply of energy that can be added to the system. This
energy could be simply the eﬀort of the tosser of the coins. Since there is no constraint, the total
number of accessible states Ωis 210 = 1024.
How would the analysis change if energy conservation were taken into account? Assume that
the numbers +1 and −1 represent the actual energy of each coin. A positive number represents
a surplus of energy while a negative number indicates a deﬁciency of energy.
For the sake of
argument, assume that the value of energy is set at +6. The total energy of +6 corresponds to 8
positive and 2 negative coins. Using Equation (E.19) with n = 10 and m = 8 (or actually counting
the possibilities) we ﬁnd that Ω= 45. Therefore, constraints reduce the number of accessible states.
■
What do you know? 17.4. Instead of 10 coins of Example 17.2.1, say you have 5
coins with +1 on one side and −1 on the other. How many accessible states are there
without constraint? What if the energy is to be +1? −2? −3?

17.2.1
Average Energy and Temperature
In our discussion thus far we have left one important element out: the interaction between
two systems, i.e., one system coming in contact with another. Contact means exchange of
energy. Of course, conservation of energy does not allow the total energy of the two systems
to change. However, because of the exchange of energy, the system of interest has more
accessible states available to it. We can now ask: In what states do we ﬁnd our system
when we allow it to interact with another system? Again, to understand the problem more
fully, consider a concrete example.
Example 17.2.2. Assume that we have two systems A and B, composed, respectively, of 10
and 990 “energetic” coins with ±1 unit of energy. As in Example 17.2.1, assume that the total
energy of the combined system is +6. Because of the interaction with B, system A has a lot more
possibilities open to it than in Example 17.2.1. For instance while the coins of A could not have
been all +1 or all −1 before, now this possibility exists because the 10 coins can borrow energy
from B and ﬂip up or down. In fact, the only constraint is that the total number of positive coins
outnumber the total number of negative coins by 6. This means that out of 1000 combined coins,
we must have 503 positive coins and 497 negative coins. How these positive and negative coins
distribute themselves in A and B is irrelevant. For example, one possibility is that no positive coin
shows up in A, in which case all 503 positive coins are in B. Another possibility is that one positive
coin shows up in A and 502 in B; or two positive coins in A and 501 in B, and so on.
■
An important question suggested by the example above is: What is the most probable
outcome for the two interacting systems? In other words, out of all the possible conﬁg-
urations consistent with the constraint, which conﬁguration occurs most frequently? The
following example illustrates the signiﬁcance of this question.
Example 17.2.3. Take the sample to be a little larger than the previous example. Let system
A have 5000 coins, system B 6000 coins, and let the total energy be 1000.
One possibility of
getting a total energy of 1000 is, for example, for A to have all negative energies and B to have
all positive. Clearly this conﬁguration is very unlikely as there is only one way for it to happen.
Another possibility is for A to have 4500 positive coins (and therefore 500 negative) and for B to
have 1500 positive coins (and 4500 negative). This conﬁguration is more likely, but still not the
most probable. What is the most probable conﬁguration?
Figure 17.2, whose plot uses Equation (E.35) of Math Note E.17.2, shows the probability as
a function of the number of positive coins of A. It can be inferred from the ﬁgure that the peak
occurs at approximately 2727. This is the most probable value of the number of positive coins of
A respecting the constraint of the total energy of 1000. Since there are 11,000 coins altogether,
to get +1000 total energy, we must have 6000 positive and 5000 negative. For the most probable
conﬁguration, out of the 6000 positive, 2727 are in A and the rest, i.e., 3273, must be in B. It
is interesting to note that the ratio of the positive numbers in A to the total number of coins in
A (or the average number of positive coins in A) is very nearly equal to the same ratio for B:
2727/5000 = 0.5454 is very nearly equal to 3273/6000 = 0.5455. This is not a coincidence, as the
following discussion shows.
■
Example 17.2.3 calculated the most probable outcome for two speciﬁc systems in contact.
But how does one ﬁnd the most probable outcome in general? For systems consisting of
small numbers of energetic coins, there is no simple formula. However, as Math Note
E.17.2 on page 103 of Appendix.pdf shows, for suﬃciently large numbers, a very interesting
conclusion can be drawn:
Box 17.2.4. (Most probable conﬁguration and average energy) The most proba-
ble conﬁguration of a system A in contact with a system B is that for which the average
energy per coin for A and B are equal, and both are equal to the average energy of the
combined system.

This statement connects statistical mechanics with thermodynamics: We know from
experience that when two systems are brought together, eventually they attain the same
temperature. Thus, the balance of temperature is attained at the same time that the
balance of average energies are achieved. It is, therefore, natural to conclude that

Box 17.2.5. The temperature of a system is proportional to the average energy of the
particles of that system.
When two systems, initially at two diﬀerent temperatures,
are brought in contact, they eventually reach the same ﬁnal temperature. When this
happens, we say that the two systems are in thermal equilibrium.
For an ideal gas, energy is just the KE. Thus, Box 17.2.5 states that the average KE of
the molecules of an ideal gas is proportional to the temperature. A little more (advanced)
math will elevate this to Equation (17.1).
What do you know? 17.5. Two systems have 10 and 15 “energetic” coins, respec-
tively. The energy is +5. What is the most probable conﬁguration when these two
systems come in contact?
Math Note E.17.3 on page 105 of Appendix.pdf shows how to ﬁnd the ﬁnal (equi-
librium) temperature when a system A, with n particles and initial temperature TA, is
brought in contact with system B, with N particles and initial temperature TB. If one of
the systems is much larger than the other, the larger system is called a reservoir. Suppose

B is the reservoir, then N is much larger than n, and in Equation (E.39), we can ignore n.
Then Tf ≈TB; i.e., a system in contact with a reservoir eventually attains the tempera-
ture of the reservoir. (If you are not convinced, look at Example D.17.4 on page 40 of
Appendix.pdf .) The temperature of the reservoir does not change.
17.2.2
The Boltzmann Factor
For a collection of “energetic” coins, the calculation of probability and the decision con-
cerning the most probable conﬁguration involve speciﬁc formulas that apply to coins only
[for instance, see Equation (E.35)].
A detailed analysis of a system in contact with a
reservoir—i.e., a system with a well-deﬁned temperature—yields a very general formula for
the probability. Let the energy of the system be denoted by E and the temperature of the
reservoir by T. Because of the exchange of energy between the system and the reservoir,
E can take on many (in fact, often inﬁnitely many) diﬀerent values. The probability for

the system to have a speciﬁc value Es for energy is, as Ludwig Boltzmann discovered, pro-
portional to e−Es/kBT , which is now called the Boltzmann factor and is at the heart of
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
In most cases, we have a system of many particles interacting among themselves, with
the nth particle having energy En, which can assume many (even inﬁnitely many) values. In
such an important case, one can take a single particle to be the “system” and the rest of the
particles, the reservoir. Then, the probability of a particle having energy En is proportional
to e−En/kBT . In particular, the ratio of the probability P(E1) of a particle having energy
E1 to the probability P(E2) of the particle having energy E2 is
P(E1)
P(E2) = e−E1/kBT
e−E2/kBT = e−(E1−E2)/kBT .

it to determine risk factors and set their premiums to maximize their proﬁts. Marketing ﬁrms
use it to decide which population group is suitable for a particular product. Pollsters use it to
determine the political or economic trend of a group. The pharmaceutical companies use it to
judge the eﬃcacy of a drug. All the disciplines in the social sciences use it to study social trends
of a community. And, of course, physicists use it as the title of this chapter indicates.
Partly due to the news coverage of the media, the word “statistical” has come to be synonymous
with “scientiﬁc” to the layman; as if the use of charts, numbers, and a few statistical formulas are
suﬃcient to render a discipline or an enterprise scientiﬁc. The general public, although lacking
knowledge of its content, trusts science; and if a company, an enterprise, or an academic discipline
can attach the word “scientiﬁc” to their products, it is likely that the public will accept that
product without question.
But “statistical” is not synonymous with “scientiﬁc.” Statistics is only a tool that can be used
by many disciplines, just as a pen is a tool that can be used by many people: Einstein used it to

And that brings us to the crucial diﬀerence between the use of statistics in physics and in other
disciplines.

ability.

No other discipline can claim this. The use of statistics in other disciplines involves collecting tons
of data from the population by interviewing, sending questionnaire, conducting polls, etc. From
these statistical samples, the trend is then predicted. A priori no clue, no theory, no formula, no
predictive power for the outcome of the statistical samples exist. By contrast, physics has a priori
universal formulas that it uses without resort to any interviews, questionnaire, or polls.

Entropy
The number of accessible states is related to a thermodynamic quantity, which we want
to explore in this section. This thermodynamic quantity has come to be associated with
“messiness.” What is the scientiﬁc deﬁnition of mess? A prime example of a mess maker

underwear. Open all drawers and leave the child in the room, allowing her to do as she
pleases for a couple of hours. Then go back in the room to ﬁnd socks among the underwear,
shirts among the socks, and underwear among the shirts, and all of these spread all over
the ﬂoor! That’s what you can call “a mess!” The content of the drawers—a small region

of the room—has been transferred to the entire ﬂoor, a larger region of the room. This
leads to the observation: A messier room is that in which a larger area (or a larger number
of “tiles”) of the ﬂoor is covered by the contents of the drawer. Let us look at some more
examples of mess production.
Example 17.3.1. Fill one half of a salt shaker with salt and the other half with black pepper and
start shaking it. After a suﬃcient amount of time the salt and pepper will be completely mixed.
Is this a messier condition than the original one? Instead of ﬂoor tiles in the example of a toddler,
we can imagine “tiling” the whole volume of the salt shaker with tiny cubes about the size of a
grain of salt or pepper. Before shaking starts, the top half of the shaker is not available to the salt,
and the bottom half is not available to the pepper. The process of shaking makes the unavailable
cubes available. Once some of these available cubes are occupied, the system consisting of salt and
pepper is said to be in a messier condition according to the deﬁnition of messiness used above.
When we open a bottle of perfume, the perfume particles will rush to occupy the available empty
space of the room. Again according to the deﬁnition of messiness, the ﬁnal condition (fragrant as
it may be!) is in a messier state than the original state.
Pollution coming out of the smoke stacks of factories produces mess because it allows the
smoke particles to occupy some of a large number of “tiles” available in the atmosphere. Similarly,
pollution of rivers, lakes, and oceans by the waste of factories, and the resulting occupancy of the
empty spaces by the waste particles, is another obvious example of an increase in the messiness of
the system, the environment.
■
The state of messiness of a system is quantiﬁed by the concept of entropy, which is
deﬁned as the product of the Boltzmann constant and the natural logarithm of the number

of accessible states: S = kB ln Ω. The reason for taking the logarithm is to make the entropy
an additive quantity. If one system has Ω1 accessible states and another system Ω2, then
the total number of accessible states of the combined system is Ω= Ω1Ω2. For example,
suppose that system 1 has 2 accessible states and system 2 has 3. If system 1 is in its ﬁrst
state, system 2 can be in state 1, 2, or 3, giving 3 possible states for the combined system.
If system 1 is in its second state, system 2 can still be in state 1, 2, or 3, giving another 3
possible states. The total number of accessible states is 3+3 or 2 × 3. Using the fact that
the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithm of the two factors, it is easy to show
that the entropy of the combined system is S = S1 + S2.
17.3.1
The Law of Entropy Increase
Consider two separate systems with the number of accessible states Ω1 and Ω2. The initial
total number of accessible states is Ωi = Ω1Ω2, and the initial entropy is Si = S1 + S2.
When you bring the two systems together, allowing them to reach equilibrium, some of
the states of either system that were not available to the other are now available to the
combined system. Therefore, the ﬁnal total number of accessible states Ωf has increased,
and the ﬁnal entropy Sf is larger than Si. This is an illustration of the law of increase of
the entropy. Example D.17.5 on page 40 of Appendix.pdf illustrates this conclusion
with numbers associated with energetic coins.
Example 17.3.2. A clamp conﬁnes a gas to one side of a container (see Figure 17.3). If the
clamp is removed the gas gushes from left to right. The ﬁnal equilibrium conﬁguration is reached
when the pressures on both sides are equal. This means that the gas on both sides is equally
compressed. If the two half-volumes are equal, this means that there are (approximately) as many
molecules on the right as there are on the left. The molecules are, of course, going back and forth
between the two volumes, but at any given time, the number of molecules is almost the same.
From the entropy viewpoint, the initial conﬁguration of the gas occupies a limited number of
accessible states. Allowing the gas to freely occupy both halves increases the number of accessible
states, and thus increases the entropy. It is also clear that the ﬁnal state is messier—less organized,
more chaotic—than the initial state. Any measurable excess of the number of molecules on one
side than the other indicates that not all possible accessible states are included, and thus cannot
correspond to an equilibrium state. Translated into the concept of entropy, this means that the

conﬁguration is not maximally chaotic and thus entropy has room to increase (by the transfer of
molecules from the denser side to the rarer side).
■
Example 17.3.3. Now imagine that the right half of the cylinder in Example 17.3.2 is ﬁlled
with a diﬀerent gas when the clamp is in place. As soon as the clamp is removed, the two gases
will start to move in opposite directions. The maximum entropy is achieved when the two gases
are completely mixed on both sides.
■
Is there any situation in which the entropy of a system decreases? In principle, one can
“undo the damage” by reversing the process that increased the entropy in the ﬁrst place.
In the case of the salt and pepper mixture, one can hire a very patient person and ask
him/her to separate the salt and pepper grains and put them back in the shaker one by
one. In the case of the perfume bottle, one can imagine a high-tech device that can attract
individual perfume molecules and place them back in the bottle. Similarly, one can imagine
microscopic devices that can reverse the entropy increasing processes. In all such instances,
the system is no longer left alone.
We say that the system is open, meaning that it is
interacting with another system. For instance, the salt and pepper system is interacting

with the “separator;” the perfume is interacting with the high-tech device, etc. The law of
entropy increase applies only to closed systems.
Under very ideal conditions, it is possible to invent processes in which the entropy of a
closed system does not change (but never decreases). Including these ideal cases, we can
summarize all our observations by saying that
Box 17.3.4. (Law of entropy increase) The entropy of a closed system never de-
creases. In other words, no closed system tends to a less chaotic conﬁguration over
time. In mathematical symbols, ∆S ≥0.
The word “closed” is signiﬁcant. It is quite possible for the entropy of a system that is
in contact with another system to decrease. But if you calculate (or measure) the change
in the entropy of both systems, it is always positive (or zero, for no change), i.e., it always
increases or remains the same. The statement of Box 17.3.4 is one form of the second law
of thermodynamics.

FFT 17.3.5. The law of entropy increase has been (mis)used by “scientiﬁc” creationists and
the followers of the intelligent design “theory” (people who believe that the evolution of species
could not have taken place without the intervention of an intelligent designer). They argue that
the law of entropy increase prevents the assemblage of parts into a whole. The cells cannot form
a complex animal or plant, unless an intelligent being actually puts them together. Otherwise,
the more organized ﬁnal product would indicate a violation of the law of entropy increase. They

cite examples such as the making of a watch or a building, which cannot be done without the
intervention of a watchmaker or a builder.
There are two ﬂaws in this argument. Firstly, it assumes that somehow in processes involving
human beings, the law of entropy increase can be violated. That this law does not apply to people!
This is completely wrong. Any physical law that allows itself to be violated by humans, is not
a law. Can you imagine a gravitational law that does not apply to humans? Or laws of motion
that exclude human motions? Or an atomic theory that states that everything is made of atoms,
except human beings? Physical laws apply to everything and everybody. So, how do we reconcile
the law of Box 17.3.4 with watch making and house building? By looking at the second ﬂaw in the
argument of scientiﬁc creationists and intelligent designers as follows.
The law of entropy increase applies to closed systems and only closed systems. To make a
system closed, you have to include everything that is in contact with it. The building becomes

truly closed only after we include the builder plus the workers that he hires, the equipments used in
the construction, the fuel used in the equipments, the food taken in by the builder and the workers,
the reﬁnery in which the fuel is distilled, the farm on which the food grows, the Earth, the Sun,
the solar system, the Milky Way, the entire universe! And the entropy of the universe increases
regardless of what happens on Earth.
The universe is the only absolutely closed system.
However, without extending every tiny
system to the entire universe, we can approximate a closed system by including some of the more
essential parts. For example, by including the construction machinery and the neighborhood in

which the house is being built, we can already discover an increase in the entropy: Although the
entropy of the house (an open system) decreases, it does so at the expense of polluting the air of
the neighborhood with the exhaust of the fume given oﬀby the machinery. If you add the entropy
increase of the surrounding of the house (a positive quantity) to the entropy decrease of the house
itself (a negative quantity), you’ll ﬁnd that the total is positive!
All cases of mess making accompanying the increase in entropy have at least one thing
in common: It is much easier to make a mess than to clean it up. It requires little eﬀort to
throw the contents of a drawer all over the ﬂoor, or to mix salt and pepper in a shaker, and
so forth. But it is not easy to put the scattered contents of a drawer back into it, and very
diﬃcult to separate the salt grains from the pepper grains. This has a practical implication
in the construction of engines, devices that convert heat to useful work.
A process in which the entropy strictly increases is irreversible: it is impossible—

likelihood of two systems in thermal equilibrium to depart from that equilibrium, and gives

An important aspect of the entropy increase is that it is always accompanied by a loss of
“useful work.” This should be clear in light of the maximality of randomness. The energy of
an organized state is concentrated and accessible. For example, the gas of Example 17.3.2
can turn a tiny wheel as it gushes through the hole on its way to the right half. Once it
has settled to its equilibrium state of maximum entropy and equal pressure, the capability
of turning a wheel will be lost.

angle on the left of the screen, moving upward, reaching a maximum height and continuing
downward, reaching the right side of the screen at an angle (Figure 17.4).

Now imagine running the projector backward. In the ﬁrst case, we see a round bullet
emerging at an angle on the right moving upward, reaching a maximum height, and con-
tinuing downward, reaching the left side of the screen at an angle. An observer watching
this movie cannot tell whether the bullet actually started on the right, or it started on the
left but the projector is running backwards. In other words, the two movies are completely
equivalent. Such a situation is described by saying that the motion of the bullet is invariant

under time-reversal. This time-reversal invariance, starring the bullet, is actually a con-
sequence of the laws of motion, meaning that the time-reversed motion is also a possible
motion.
In the case of the second motion picture, when the projector runs backwards, the screen
shows the smoke particles assembling themselves into smaller and smaller volume while at
the same time moving towards the mouth of the pipe. An observer watching this sequence of
events can easily conclude that the projector is running backwards. Therefore, the motion
of smoke particles as a group is not time-reversal invariant. The time-symmetry breaks
down for the smoke of the pipe.
What is the diﬀerence between the motion of a bullet and that of smoke? What ingredi-
ent is there in the smoke motion picture which allows the observer to unequivocally identify
the backward motion of the ﬁlm? The answer is entropy! Our discussion in this chapter
has made it clear that entropy is a macroscopic quantity, i.e., it is well-deﬁned only for a

large number of particles (atoms, molecules). The motion of a single bullet—ignoring its
irrelevant structure as a collection of more fundamental particles—cannot accommodate for
entropy. On the other hand, smoke, consisting of many small particles, is a perfect arena
on which entropy can unfold itself. Since for all natural macroscopic processes entropy in-
creases, and since this increase accompanies a tendency towards what we identify as a more
chaotic outcome, it is easy to detect the reversed motion of smoke. We can thus claim that
entropy determines the direction of time:
Box 17.3.6. Time ﬂows in that direction as to make entropy grow.
This growth of entropy can be detected only if we deal with macroscopic quantities.

or in reverse. As long as the screen is allowed to show only a few particles, the reversal of
the motion of the projector will have no detectable consequences. It is true that the motion
of all particles will be reversed, but the reversed motion is just as natural a possibility as the
original motion. The slow “rise” of the particles is a minute eﬀect completely overshadowed
by their random (and very quick) back and forth motion.
The above analysis shows that as soon as we restrict ourselves to the microworld, the
tendency to chaos, the law of the increase of entropy, fades away. In a sense the atoms, the
molecules, and their constituents have no sense of time. To them, both directions of time
are possible: they can travel back and forth in time.

Answers to “What do you know?”
17.1.
The average KE is proportional to Kelvin temperature, not Celsius. So, the aver-
age KE does not change by a factor of two. In fact, it changes by a factor of (273.16 +
300)/(273.16 + 150) or 1.35.
17.2. Equation (17.1) says that the atoms of the hot object have more energy than those
of the cold object. At the boundary of the two objects, the more energetic atoms of the hot
object collide with the sluggish atoms of the cold object and make them move faster. This
transfer of KE, reduces the KE of the hot atoms and increases the KE of the cold atoms
at the boundary. The boundary atoms of the cold object share their extra energy with the
other atoms of the cold object, making them more energetic. Similarly, the other atoms of
the hot object share their energy with their less energetic partners at the boundary, making
them more energetic. This process goes on, until the hot has no more energy to share with
the cold, i.e., until both sides have the same temperature.
17.3.
Average KE is proportional to the temperature. So, both kinds of atom have the
same average KE. However, lighter atoms have larger average speed (to make the product
of mass and velocity square equal). So, He atoms are moving faster on the average.
17.4.
With no constraint, the number of accessible states is the same as the number of
possible outcomes, which is 25 = 32. If the energy is to be +1, we need 3 positive and 2
negative coins. By actually counting, or using Equation (E.19) with n = 5 and m = 3,
you obtain the number of accessible states to be 10. There is no way to get a −2. For −3,

you need 4 negatives and 1 positive. Again, either by actually counting, or using Equation
(E.19) with n = 5 and m = 4, you obtain the number of accessible states to be 5.
17.5. When combined, you have 25 “energetic” coins. To get a net +5 for the total, you
need 15 positives and 10 negatives. Let m1 and m2 be the number of positives in the ﬁrst
and second systems, respectively. Then, m1 + m2 = 15. Furthermore, Box 17.2.4 says the
m1/10 = m2/15. These two relations have the unique solution of m1 = 6 and m2 = 9. So
the most probable conﬁguration has 6 positive coins in the ﬁrst system and 9 positive coins
in the second system.

tells us how much east (positive) or west (negative) it is; the second number tells us how
much north (positive) or south (negative) it is; and the third number tells us how much
up (positive) or down (negative) it is. Similarly, three numbers are required to specify the

Chapter18
Temperature and Heat
The machinery of statistical mechanics can help us examine thermodynamics with much
more ease than the tools available to the physicists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries, who were stymied by the complexity of the systems they had to study. Neverthe-
less, it is instructive to follow the historical development of concepts, and make connection
with their statistical mechanical analogues. Let’s start with the most basic quantity in
thermodynamics.
18.1
Temperature
Temperature quantiﬁes the notion of coldness or hotness. That the human sensation of
hot and cold is inaccurate can be demonstrated by a simple experiment. Take three bowls
labeled Bc, Bw, and Bh. Fill Bc with cold water, Bw with lukewarm water, and Bh with
hot water. Place a ﬁnger of your left hand in Bc and one of your right hand in Bh. Wait
Your tactile sense can
fool you!
a few minutes. Now place both ﬁngers in Bw. Your left ﬁnger feels warm while your right
ﬁnger feels cold.
To measure the hotness of something one uses a thermometer. Thermometers have
been in use for a long time. Galileo is credited with the invention of the ﬁrst one using the
Thermometers and how
they work.
expansion of air as its working principle. Most thermometers in use today employ the same
basic principle, namely the expansion of substances such as alcohol and mercury (the two
most common liquids used in thermometry) caused by heat.
From the early seventeenth to the late eighteenth century, the art of thermometry de-
veloped considerably. By the middle of the eighteenth century it became known that the
temperature at which ice melts, the so-called melting point of ice, does not change as the
ice is heated up. Similarly, the boiling point of water is independent of how much the water
is heated. Soon these two points became the standard ﬁxed points of many thermometers.
These ﬁxed points were given arbitrary values by diﬀerent thermometer makers, and the
interval between these two values was divided into a number of equal parts. Daniel Fahren-
heit (1686–1738) assigned 32 to the melting point of ice and 212 to the boiling point of
water and divided the interval between these two points into 212 −32 = 180 equal parts.
Anders Celsius (1701–1744), on the other hand, decided that a more appropriate pair of
numbers is 0 for melting and 100 for boiling. Still other thermometrists chose other pairs
of values for the ﬁxed points.
What do you know? 18.1. Why are the tubes of a thermometer, in which mercury
or alcohol expand, so thin?

Figure 18.1: A constant-volume gas thermometer works on the empirical basis that, at constant volume,
the pressure of a gas increases with temperature.
Clearly such a feudal state of aﬀairs could not persist for long. Communication between
users of diﬀerent thermometers forced the adoption of a single standard thermometer. The
problem was not so much in using diﬀerent pairs of values for the ﬁxed point (a simple
rule can be used to convert from one scale to another), as in using diﬀerent substances for
thermometers. Suppose two people calibrate their thermometers according to Celsius scale;
however, one uses alcohol and the other mercury. By their very construction these two
thermometers read 0 degrees for the melting point of ice and 100 degrees for the boiling
point of water. But, what guarantees that they will agree on the intermediate points and
beyond? Such a guarantee would exist only if heat would expand alcohol and mercury at
proportionate rates, which is not the case.
By the beginning of the nineteenth century it became clear that gas thermometers
were the most accurate. One such gas thermometer is the so-called constant-volume gas

thermometer shown in Figure 18.1. Put container A in contact with the material whose
temperature is to be measured. The volume of the gas changes. Raise or lower the ﬂexible
tube C to restore the volume of the gas to its original value. This causes a change in the
level of the liquid (usually mercury) in B proportional to the temperature.
Accurate as they were, gas thermometers still showed discrepancies among themselves.
If one measured a single temperature, e.g., the boiling point of sulfur, with gas thermometers
ﬁlled with oxygen, nitrogen, air, or hydrogen, the reading would vary from 444 ◦C to 446 ◦C,
depending on the gas used. However, it was discovered later that, if one lowered the pressure
of the gas by decreasing the amount of gas in the thermometer, the readings of thermometers
were also lowered along straight lines. Figure 18.2(a), in which the temperature is measured
in Celsius degrees, depicts this behavior. The ﬁgure shows that the disagreement among
the thermometers is reduced for smaller pressures; the lower the pressure, the better the
agreement. It was further seen that if one extrapolated the straight lines to zero pressure,
all thermometers would agree exactly.
Food for Thought
FFT 18.1.1. It is appropriate at this point to remark brieﬂy on the science and art of mea-
surement.
A thermometer is built to measure the temperature of an object.
But it uses the
assumption that water freezes and boils at constant temperatures!
How do we know that the
freezing (or boiling) point of water is ﬁxed prior to the construction of our ﬁrst thermometer?
Measurement is an interactive process in which both the measuring device and the measured

The very use of an apparatus presupposes a knowledge of what is being
measured. To use a meter stick, we must have a fairly good idea of length. Clocks are useful

because we have a fairly good idea of what time is. We rely on a balance when we weigh an object
because we have a “hunch” that the two sides of the balance are pulled down with equal force. The
inventor of the ﬁrst balance knew nothing about the properties of the gravitational force that pulled
the objects at the two ends of his balance. He did not know that the force of gravity was sensitive

of a balance.
only to the mass of the objects (and not, e.g., on their color); that the gravitational acceleration
did not vary appreciably from one end of the balance to the next; that this acceleration was the
same for all objects. Yet the validity of all these properties of gravity is crucial for the eﬀective
operation of a balance.
As our understanding of physical quantities improves, our ability to build a better apparatus
increases just as our need for such an apparatus becomes more and more urgent. While grandfather
clocks were quite adequate for the eighteenth century, they are completely obsolete for modern-day
scientists who have to measure the intricacies of the relativistic uniﬁcation of space and time. On
the other hand, an improvement in the measuring device entails a rectiﬁcation of our knowledge of
the quantity being measured. They go hand in hand, and one inﬂuences the other.
Thermometers and temperature are no exceptions to this rule. The ﬁrst thermometer builders
had a “hunch” that ice always melted at the same temperature. Their ﬁrst crude thermometers
veriﬁed this hunch. Improvements on these crude thermometers also pointed to the accuracy of the
hunch. As our knowledge of the concept of temperature improved, our thermometers became more
accurate, and such an accuracy allowed further progress in our understanding of temperature.

came smaller and smaller, all maintaining a straight-line plot on a P vs T diagram [see
Figure 18.2(b)]. When these lines were extrapolated to the left, they all crossed the T-axis
at the same point. This “T intercept” turned out to be −273.16 ◦C.

whose zero occurred at −273.16 ◦C, the absolute zero. Kelvin temperature scale, denoted
by ◦K or simply K, is the scale used in scientiﬁc laboratories around the world.
The
vanishing of pressure at absolute zero agrees with Equation (17.2), whose temperature we
have already identiﬁed as Kelvin.
18.2
The First Law of Thermodynamics
A simple system such as a gallon of gas (e.g., air) in a cylinder open at one end is a good
tool to study thermodynamics. Put a piston at the open end of the cylinder. There are two

262
Chapter 18
Temperature and Heat
ways to interact with the gas: pushing or pulling the piston and putting the walls of the
cylinder in contact with a reservoir. This interaction transfers energy to the particles of the
gas, changing its energy content. The energy associated with the motion of the piston is
the work done on or by the gas. The energy transferred through the walls of the cylinder
is deﬁned to be the heat added or removed from the gas.
It is customary to denote the work done by the system by W so that the work done on
the system will be −W. The reason for the minus sign is that in any process in which work
is done and in which there are action/reaction forces, the work done by the reaction force
is always negative of the work done by the action force. This is because the two forces are
displaced by the same amount and in the same direction, while the directions of the two
forces are exactly opposite by the third law. In the situation at hand, the outside agent
and the gas constitute an action-reaction system.
From energy conservation, we obtain
First law of
thermodynamics stated.
∆U = Q −W,
(18.1)
where ∆U is the change in the internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and
W the work done by the system. Both Q and W can be positive or negative: Q > 0 means
that heat is added to the system and Q < 0 means that the system gives oﬀheat. Similarly,
W > 0 means that the system does the work and W < 0 means that work is done on the
system.
What do you know? 18.2. Recall that the particles of an ideal gas have only one
form of energy: kinetic. How does the internal energy of an ideal gas consisting of N
particles depend on the temperature of the gas? Hint: Equation (17.1) gives the average
KE of each particle.
Equation (18.1) is the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. In words it says
Box 18.2.1. (First law of thermodynamics) The amount of energy added to a
system—for example, in the form of heat or work—is stored in the system as its internal
energy.
Math Note E.18.1 on page 107 of Appendix.pdf applies the ﬁrst law of thermody-
namics to a very simple system and ﬁnds the heat transferred to this system in terms of
the change in its temperature. In so doing, the math note also introduces speciﬁc heat.
Speciﬁc heat is a quantity that is deﬁned not only for a gas but also for solids and liquids.
It is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the system by 1 degree
Celsius (or Kelvin). Table 18.1 shows the speciﬁc heat of some common substances.
What do you know? 18.3. Is it possible to add only heat to an ideal gas without
changing its temperature?
18.2.1
Heat as a Form of Energy
Statistical mechanics derives Equations (18.1) and (E.48). However, statistical mechanics
did not exist when people struggled with the concept of heat. The earliest theory of heat
dates back to the 1770s when the French chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–1794)
proposed the “caloric” theory. According to this theory, when a hot object comes in contact

with a colder object, an imponderable ﬂuid, called calorie, will ﬂow from the hot to the
cold object. There was some confusion with regards to the caloric theory at the beginning.
For instance, some people believed that, just as there were positive and negative electricity,
caloric came in two diﬀerent forms: Hot objects have positive calorie while cold objects
must have negative calorie.
However, gradually it became clear that calorie existed in
only one form and that it always ﬂowed from hot to cold. By the late 1790s there were a
number of scientists who questioned the caloric theory. One of these scientists was Benjamin
Thompson (1753–1814), also known as Count Rumford.
Food for Thought
FFT 18.2.2. By the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century, the three
branches of physics, namely mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics, had progressed
to various degrees. Mechanics was rigorously established on a ﬁrm mathematical foundation which
itself had helped create. However, the other two branches were still in their infancy, and a lot of
confusion was prevalent in them. Only in such a preponderance of confusion can a theory based
on “imponderables” gain acceptance, albeit for a short while.
The scientists today reject such
imponderable entities as the “energy ﬁeld” and the “Qi” of alternative medicine. But two centuries
ago, it was not easy to do so. Even prominent scientists proposed mythical “theories.”
These incipient sciences begged the attention of curious minds.
And since the amount of
knowledge accumulated in them was meager and unorganized, someone with little or no formal
training could contribute to their further understanding. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear
the names of Benjamin Franklin and Michael Faraday in the history of electromagnetism, and
Benjamin Thompson in the history of thermodynamics.
Benjamin Thompson was born in Woburn, Massachusetts. Instead of a formal education, he

became an apprentice in a store. When he was 19, he married a rich woman considerably older
than him to get access to a comfortable life. However, the comfort was not to last for long, because
when the Revolutionary War broke out, the 23-year-old Thompson sided with the British. His
commitment to the British surpassed mere sympathy, and he became actively involved in spying
for them.
After the Revolutionary War, he knew well that he would have to spend the rest of his life in
exile. He ﬁrst went to England where he was found taking bribes and selling war secrets to the
French. Having made himself unwelcome in England, he left for Germany in 1783 and put himself
at the service of Elector Karl Theodor of Bavaria, who, in recognition of Thompson’s civilian and
military services, granted him the title of a Count. Thompson chose the name Rumford because
that was the town (now Concord) in New Hampshire where he used to live with his wife.
In 1799, after the death of the Elector, Count Rumford had to leave Germany because he had
managed to accumulate many enemies during his stay there. He returned to England where, due
to his scientiﬁc accomplishment (see below), he was admitted into the Royal Society, a prestigious
scientiﬁc society established at the beginning of the seventeenth century in England. His second
stay in England was not to be permanent either. He went to Paris in 1804 and married Lovoisier’s

264

rich widow. However, their marriage was a disaster from the very beginning and lasted four bitter
years. Thompson died in 1814 near Paris with his American daughter by his ﬁrst wife at his side.
What a contrast with Faraday’s biography! [For a concise biography of Faraday, see Section
13.3.] Faraday also had no formal education, but he was a man of strong character, a genius with

an unprecedented devotion to science. Once he started his career as a scientist, he spent 100% of his
time doing science. For him science was not just a diversion, it was his life. One can only speculate
on the possible level of Faraday’s scientiﬁc achievement had he had a formal training—especially
in mathematics. It was a combination of his genius and the pristine nature of electromagnetism

that led to his discovery of one of the most important pieces of the electromagnetic puzzle, the
law of induction.
To understand how critical the primitive nature of electromagnetism was to
that contribution, one can merely ask why he did not contribute to the science of mechanics,
although he advanced the other sciences of his time, including chemistry, considerably. The answer
is simple: mechanics was by then almost 200 years old and had become highly mathematical, for
which Faraday had no preparation.
Thompson and Franklin, on the other hand were not professional scientists. For them, science
was only a diversion, a hobby, a pleasant curiosity; and if they stumbled on a discovery, so much the
better. But, unlike Faraday, Thompson and Franklin did not—they could not, because there were
other things occupying their time—pursue the discovery as a professional scientist would. And they
were not alone in either their leisurely pursuit of knowledge or the importance of their discovery.
In the following, we shall learn about Julius Meyer, a physician, and James Joule, a brewer, who
contributed signiﬁcantly to the development of the then pristine science of thermodynamics.
It is not our intention to undercut the discoveries made by such people. These discoveries were
essential to the later development of science regardless of their discoverers. The point to be made
is the diﬀerence between eighteenth century and contemporary physics. Today, without a total
commitment, without an almost obsessive devotion, without a long and sophisticated training in
physics, it is impossible to make any contributions to its development. Why? Because all branches
of physics have become highly mathematical.
Even Faraday, with all his genius and devotion,
would be incapable of contributing to today’s physics, because of his lack of formal training, just
as he was incapable of contributing to mechanics during his distinguished career.
There are people who will say that this portrayal of physics discourages the youth from taking
up physics and science as their career. But are we doing the youth service by giving them false
hopes? Wouldn’t it be a disservice to the youth if we tell them that they are learning arithmetic
when they cannot do even a single-digit addition? Some educators advocate developing “positive
attitude and self conﬁdence” in our youth. That is good, but not at the expense of replacing the
truth. We have to encourage our children that they can learn arithmetic. But if they have diﬃculty
with the simplest addition, we should not hand them a calculator and teach them how to push
buttons, and call that “learning arithmetic.”
Similarly, we should not replace physics with the “fun” of computer animation and imagery1
just to please the youth, because sooner or later the society will come to the realization that its
youth lacks even the simplest understanding of physics. Part of the teaching of physics to the public
ought to be to point out that becoming a physicist requires dedication and years of training. Then
honest truth seekers will acknowledge the necessity of fully learning the existing theories—with all
their mathematical, theoretical, and experimental intricacies—at the early stages of their career.
Once this necessity is recognized, and they pursue it vigorously, honestly, and wholeheartedly, the
society will beneﬁt from their creativity.
What do you know? 18.4. Does adding heat to an ideal gas always accompany a
rise in its temperature?
In 1798, when serving Elector Karl Theodor of Bavaria in the military, Thompson noticed
that, in the process of boring cannons, the metal became so hot that it boiled the water
used to keep it cool. The prevalent explanation was that, when the metal is broken to
pieces, as into ﬁling produced by boring, the caloric is liberated from the metal, giving rise
to heat. However, Thompson realized that, even when ﬁling is not produced, heat is given
1A practice that is sadly too common among educators.

oﬀby mere friction. In fact, he showed that the amount of heat produced in the process of
boring was so great that if it were poured back, it could melt the metal! In other words,
more caloric could be released from the metal than it could possibly hold. Thompson’s
conclusion was that the heat was produced by the mechanical motion of the borer, and that
the quantity of heat was equal to the motional energy of the borer. Therefore, he concluded,
Heat is a form of energy.
heat is a form of energy. Thompson even tried to measure how much heat was produced by
a given amount of motion. He was thus the ﬁrst to measure what is called the mechanical
equivalent of heat (MEH). His ﬁgure of 5.57 Joules was, however, too high, and it was
Mechanical Equivalent
of Heat (MEH).
not until about 50 years later that the ﬁrst acceptable value of 4.16 Joules was measured.
Count Rumford’s idea of the equivalence of heat and mechanical energy did not catch on
immediately for two reasons. First, Lovoisier’s fame and inﬂuence as the father of modern
chemistry made it diﬃcult to tackle the caloric theory which he had proposed earlier.
Secondly, and more importantly, to convince the scientiﬁc community of the equivalence of
heat and mechanical energy, a precise measure of such an equivalence was required. This was
lacking up to 1842 when Julius Mayer (1814–1878), the German physician-turned-physicist,
reported a rough estimate of the mechanical equivalent of heat.
The ﬁnal and decisive blow to the caloric theory was imparted by James Prescott Joule
(1818–1889), the English brewer. In 1847, Joule reported his measurement of the mechanical
equivalent of heat. However, partly because of his profession (a brewer was not well-received
in the academic circles of mid nineteenth century), and partly because of the fact that
his results were based on measuring very small temperature diﬀerences, his work was not
recognized at the beginning. He could not publish his result in any of the scientiﬁc journals
of his time. With the help of his brother, a music critic, he managed to print his paper in
a Manchester newspaper. After a few months he succeeded in reading his work to a hostile
professional audience, among which was Lord Kelvin who commented favorably on Joule’s
work, and the interest in his work grew. Finally, in 1849, Joule read a revision of his paper
to the Royal Society which accepted the results.
What do you know? 18.5. Can the caloric theory explain the heat produced when
you rub your hands together? Can the mechanical equivalence of heat?
Joule’s work showed that each calorie,2 the prevalent unit used to measure heat, con-

tains 4.16 metric units of energy. Today, the accepted value is 4.186 metric units of energy
per calorie. The metric unit of work and energy is named after Joule (see page 108) to
honor his contribution to our understanding of the intricate concept of heat.
To get an idea of how big a calorie is, we note that lifting a 1 kilogram object a distance of
1 meter requires approximately 9.8 Joules. Thus, such a lift is equivalent to 9.8/4.18 = 2.34

calories of heat. This calorie should not be confused with the dietary calorie which is 1000
times bigger. Thus, to lose an equivalent of 2.34 dietary calories, one has to lift 1 kg a
distance of 1 m for 1000 times, or to lift 50 kg a distance of 1 m 20 times! It is not easy to
lose weight!
One of the methods Joule used to measure MEH was to drop a weight by a given
distance. As the weight fell, it turned a paddle which stirred the water in a bucket. By
measuring the distance the weight fell, Joule could calculate the work done. By measuring
the temperature rise of the water, he could measure the heat produced. He then assumed
that the work done was converted into heat. Equating the two, he could ﬁnd the MEH.
Example D.18.1 on page 41 of Appendix.pdf shows why a precise measurement of the
mechanical equivalent of heat is so diﬃcult.
Calculating the amount of heat transferred to an object requires knowing the value of
the speciﬁc heat of that object. The determination of the speciﬁc heat of substances is made

Temperature and Heat
by heating a sample of the substance to a given temperature and subsequently submerging
it in water at another temperature. By carefully insulating the whole apparatus so that
no heat is lost to the surrounding, one can assume that heat given oﬀby the hot object is
equal to the heat absorbed by the cold object when the two come in thermal equilibrium,
i.e., their ﬁnal temperature reaches the same value. Equating these two quantities of heat,
one can solve for the speciﬁc heat of the substance (see Example D.18.2 on page 41 of
Appendix.pdf for details of how this is done for copper).
We have casually used energy and its conservation, because it has become a standard
part of physics literature, although the word “energy” is a fairly recent addition to the
physics vocabulary. It was coined by Thomas Young (1773–1829) in a lecture delivered in
1801 to the newly established Royal Institution. Prior to that, there was a lot of confusion
not only in using the word, but also in its precise physical meaning. Some physicists used
the concepts of force, momentum, and energy interchangeably. Young clearly showed that

momentum—known in those days as the quantity of motion—was quite diﬀerent from what
he called kinetic energy.
It is ironic that the law of the conservation of energy, one of the most fundamental laws of
physics, was developed and proposed by “outsiders.” We have already mentioned Benjamin
Thompson the diplomat, James Joule the brewer, and Julius Mayer the physician. And the
person credited with the ﬁrst clear statement of the law of energy conservation is Hermann
Helmholtz (1821–1894) the physiologist. The law of energy conservation states that
Conservation of energy.
Box 18.2.3. There is a ﬁnite constant quantity, called energy, which can appear in
various forms such as heat or mechanical work.
Energy, in its broadest term, is the capacity to do work.
Thus, this capacity could
acquire many forms: mechanical, heat, electrical, nuclear, etc. Of course, nuclear energy
had not been discovered in the 1840s. However, when it was discovered, it was shown to
obey this all embracing principle.
18.2.2
First Law and Weight Loss
A useful application of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics is to the human metabolism, where
Q is the calorie intake in the form of food, W is the work done in the form of muscular
actions both internal (heart beat) and external (walking), and ∆U is the change in the
internal energy of the human body.
Unfortunately the ultimate form that this internal
energy takes is fat.
Not all people have the same kind of metabolism. Certainly you have encountered people
who eat a lot more than you do, exercise no more than you, and yet they seem to be a
lot skinnier than you. This is not a violation of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics; it has to
do with the “eﬃciency” with which human body uses the food intake. You are one of the
unlucky people, if you have a very eﬃcient digestive system, which processes a large portion
of the food you eat. Your friend, with an ineﬃcient digestive system can eat a lot, but a
large portion of her intake is eventually disposed out of her body, leaving a small portion
as Q. So although she eats a lot more than you, the Q of your friend may be actually
smaller than yours. Furthermore, her internal muscular activity may be larger than yours,
making her overall W larger, even though you may be doing more external exercise. In
applying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, Q should be regarded as the net calorie intake
(not necessarily the calories in the food one eats), and W as the net work done (including
the internal muscular activity, which varies from person to person).
Regardless of the variations among individuals mentioned above, if a person’s metabolism
is such that Q > W, he is eating more than he is exercising; thus ∆U > 0, and the person
will be accumulating fat. If Q = W, the person is eating exactly the same amount of energy

obeying the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics: To accumulate fat, ∆U must be positive; to lose
it, ∆U must be negative. And to change ∆U, you need to change Q or W or both; i.e., you
have to change your material intake of food, or your physical activity, or both. No amount
of meditation, mental concentration, spiritual focus, or “positive attitude” will change the
fat content of your body.
What do you know? 18.6. Is it possible to lose weight by telling yourself that you
will lose weight if you concentrate hard enough? By only exercising?
Next time you pass the local “health and beauty” store, advertising the “new aromather-
apy” by means of which “mind speaks; body listens,” think of the ﬁrst law of thermody-
namics. And remember that one cannot lose weight by soaking oneself in aromatic oils,
closing one’s eyes, and imagining a leisurely walk through a bed of ﬂowers and herbs!
Food for Thought
FFT 18.2.4. If there is one master universal result in physics, it ought to be the conservation
of energy. It has been a guiding principle in many branches of physics. Heat was the ﬁrst (macro-
scopically) non-mechanical energy to enter into the picture. At the beginning it was thought to be
a nonmaterial “imponderable” quantity. Once the mechanical equivalence of heat was established,
the idea of the conservation of energy won a strong foothold in the world of physics until the closing
years of the nineteenth century.
In the 1890s, when radioactivity of certain elements was discovered, it seemed as if these
elements had a supply of spontaneously generated energy, and the principle of the conservation of
energy came under questioning by some physicists. In the meantime, a German mathematician by
the name of Emmy Noether, pursuing a highly mathematical formulation of the laws of mechanics,
discovered in 1918 one of the most beautiful and elegant results in mathematical physics. In what

is now called the Noether Theorem, she showed that if time intervals are independent of their
starting points [so that one hour is one hour whether it is measured from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm, or
from 9:00 am to 10:00 am], then energy must be conserved.
With the exactness of a mathematical proof on its side, energy conservation seemed to be on
a solid foundation, especially when quantum theory of 1925–26 appeared to be capable of solving
the riddle of radioactivity. However, a closer look at these activities, especially what was later
identiﬁed as the weak nuclear reaction, seemed to suggest a “missing energy.” When physicists
added the energies of all the particles produced in the weak nuclear decay and compared it with
the energy before the decay, they found a depletion, a disappearance of energy! Some proposed
non-conservation of energy in nuclear decay and suggested that somehow nuclear interactions are
diﬀerent from ordinary phenomena. Wolfgang Pauli, however, adhered to the principle of energy
conservation, and proposed in 1930 the existence of a highly elusive particle, which Enrico Fermi
later christened neutrino. Decades later neutrino was actually detected in ultrasensitive detectors.
Today, conservation of energy is one of the most ﬁrmly established principles of physics, and
no violation of it has ever been observed. Indeed, by Noether’s Theorem, such a violation is no less

nonsensical than the statement that “the duration of one hour depends on when you start counting
the minutes;” or that from 10:00 am to 11:00 am is one hour, but from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm is only
58 minutes, or that Einstein lived for 76 years according to the Christian calendar, but 74 years
according to the Jewish calendar!
The next time you hear about claims of inventions of electric generators that consume no fuel,
cars that run forever without gasoline or electricity, or any other perpetual motion machine (which
by its very nature violates energy conservation), remember that, by Noether Theorem, the existence
of these machines implies that time intervals depend on their starting moments! Therefore, energy

machines and inexhaustible sources of energy sound as strange as the statement that Einstein lived
for 76 years according to the Christian calendar, but 74 years according to the Jewish calendar.
18.2.3
Speciﬁc Heat
Equation (E.48) introduced the notion of the speciﬁc heat. It is appropriate to discuss
the origin of the speciﬁc heat, especially its variation among diﬀerent substances, from a
statistical mechanical viewpoint.
It will be more convenient to discuss molar speciﬁc
heat.
Recall that one mole contains 6.02 × 1023 molecules.
Molar speciﬁc heat is the
amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole of a substance by one degree
Celsius. We know that diﬀerent substances have diﬀerent speciﬁc heat. The question is,
can we explain this diﬀerence by use of statistical mechanics? How can we explain the fact
that some substances become hot quicker than other substances?
Consider two substances A and B. Assume that A has a simple molecular structure,
while B’s is more complex leading to more internal motions. For instance, diﬀerent atoms
in the molecule can vibrate relative to one another, or they can undergo rotational motion
about each other. In the jargon of physicists, B is said to have vibrational and rotational
degrees of freedom. Such internal motions either do not exist for A or they exist to a
lesser degree. Now imagine adding the same amount of heat to the two systems which we
assume have equal number of molecules, say one mole. This heat, or energy, will divide
itself among all molecules. So each molecule of either system receives the same amount of
energy on the average. This energy divides itself up into various forms that the molecule
is capable of receiving, such as kinetic energy, vibrational energy, rotational energy, etc.
Thus, molecule B, which has a lot of “internal” motions can absorb a large portion of the
energy internally. Only a small part will be left to provide kinetic energy for the molecule.
The situation is diﬀerent for molecule A: a lot of energy goes into the kinetic “mode,” and
only a little in the internal modes.
BIOGRAPHY
Emmy Noether (1882–1935) studied German, English, French, and arithmetic in high school, and
wanted to become a language teacher. However instead of ﬁnding a job as a language teacher, for
which she became certiﬁed in 1900, Noether decided to study mathematics at university, but in those
days, women were not allowed to oﬃcially register at universities. Each professor had to give a separate
permission for his course. Noether sat in on courses at Erlangen and G¨ottingen, receiving her doctorate
in 1907. She published many fundamental papers in algebra, but her monumental work is a theorem
on conservation laws in mathematical physics. In 1933 the Nazis dismissed her from the University of
G¨ottingen because she was Jewish. She accepted a visiting professorship at Bryn Mawr College in the
USA. She died in 1935 due to post-surgery complications.
As discussed in Section 17.2, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy
of molecules. We thus expect substance A’s temperature to rise more than substance B’s.
Therefore A has a smaller molar speciﬁc heat than B, because less heat is required to raise
its temperature. According to this argument, substances which have larger molecules must
have larger (molar) speciﬁc heat. This is indeed the case.
What do you know? 18.7. Two substances A and B both have rotational degrees
of freedom. A requires less energy to excite its rotation than B. Which substance has a
larger speciﬁc heat?

Section 18.3
The Second Law of Thermodynamics

18.3
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics states the conservation of energy. It considers heat as a
form of energy and incorporates it into the conservation law. It puts no restriction on the
way various forms of energy can transform into one another. Thus, the ﬁrst law is blind to
the practicality of transforming work into heat or vice versa.
The process of the conversion of heat into work is of considerable practical importance,
because that is precisely what an engine does. Engines were quite common in nineteenth
century Europe, having been invented as early as 1698 by Papin (1647–1712), the French
inventor, and improved by the Scottish engineer James Watt (1736–1819) in 1769. A com-
mon feature of all these engines was their extremely low eﬃciencies. The best of them
had an eﬃciency of only 6%. This means that the engine would use, say 100 Joules of
heat energy and produce only 6 Joules of work. The ﬁrst law, on the other hand, did not
restrict the 100% conversion of heat into work. Was it, in principle, possible to have an
engine 100% eﬃcient? It was the investigation of this question that led to the second law
of thermodynamics.
Actually the second law was discovered before the ﬁrst.
In its earliest form it was
formulated by the French physicist Nicolas Sadi Carnot (1796–1832) in 1824. Carnot was
an army engineer who was interested in the eﬃciency of engines from a purely practical
point. He considered the most eﬃcient ideal engine, now known as Carnot engine, and
Carnot engine.
showed that such an engine could not be 100% eﬃcient. The ideality of Carnot engine makes
it suitable for theoretical studies of thermodynamics. This situation should remind us of
the ﬁrst law of motion, which holds in the ideal circumstance, under which both friction
and gravity are eliminated. The ideality of the ﬁrst law of motion does not diminish its
signiﬁcance.
To understand the second law we must understand the basic properties of an engine. An
engine, shown schematically in Figure 18.3, is a device which, in a cyclic process, extracts
What is an engine?
heat Qh from a large hot reservoir at temperature Th, converts some of it to work W, and
dumps the rest of it Qc in a cold reservoir at temperature Tc. Conservation of energy (18.1)
implies that ∆U = Qh −Qc −W, where both Qh and Qc are taken to be positive. The
negative sign appears in front of Qc, because Qc is taken out of the system. Since the engine
returns to its original state after one cycle, its internal energy will not change. So, ∆U = 0,
and we obtain Qh = Qc + W.
The eﬃciency ϵ of the engine is the ratio of the work done by the engine to the amount
of heat taken in (or the ratio of the useful work it produces to its energy intake):
ϵ = W
Qh
= Qh −Qc
Qh
= 1 −Qc
Qh
.
(18.2)
It follows from this equation that a very eﬃcient engine has a very low Qc to Qh ratio. How
low can this ratio be? Can we make it zero and get an eﬃciency of 100%?
There are two obstacles to a very low Qc/Qh: practical and theoretical. The practical
obstacles include such unwanted quantities as friction, viscosity, or any other dissipating
forces, as well as loss of part of Qh as it enters the engine. Such practical problems can in
principle be minimized by lubrication, insulation, and other technological means. So, we
can set aside the practical obstacles and concentrate on the theoretical ones.
Math Note E.18.2 on page 107 of Appendix.pdf shows how the theoretical limitation
leads to the conclusion that for the most eﬃcient (ideal, theoretical) engine, the change in
the total entropy must be zero. When this happens, the engine is said to be reversible.
The math note also proves:

Box 18.3.1. (Carnot’s theorem) No engine working between two heat reservoirs
can be more eﬃcient than a reversible (Carnot) engine working between the same two
reservoirs.
All Carnot engines working between two given reservoirs have the same
eﬃciency of ϵ = 1 −Tc/Th.
Sadi Carnot proved this in 1824 without any knowledge of entropy and its properties.
Carnot’s theorem is one form of the second law of thermodynamics as applied to
engines. There are other more “popular” versions of the second law. One is the law of
the increase of the entropy encountered in Section 17.3.1, which Math Note E.18.2 used to
prove Carnot’s theorem. Another version is the so-called Kelvin-Planck statement: It

is impossible for an engine to have no other eﬀect but to extract heat from a reservoir and
to convert it completely into mechanical energy (work). In other words, every engine must
dump some of the heat it extracts. This is the heat that it cannot possibly convert into
work. It can be shown that this statement is completely equivalent to Carnot’s theorem.
What do you know? 18.8. Can you use Box 18.3.1 and the Kelvin-Planck statement
of the second law to show that absolute zero is unattainable?
A Carnot engine is, by deﬁnition, reversible. Therefore, it is possible to run it backwards.

pump.
This means that all arrows in Figure 18.3 are to change directions. Such a device, with the
help of some external work, takes away some heat Qc from the cold reservoir and delivers
Qh = W + Qc to the hot reservoir. This is precisely what a refrigerator or a heat pump
does. The notion of a refrigerator allows a third statement of the second law called the
Clausius statement which can be shown to be completely equivalent to the other two
statements: It is impossible for a refrigerator to produce no other eﬀect than the transfer
of heat from a cold reservoir to a hotter reservoir. A refrigerator, with the help of some
work W, supplied by an electric motor, for example, removes heat from a cold reservoir
(the freezer), and delivers heat to a hot reservoir (the kitchen). Clausius statement simply
says that we cannot have a refrigerator without a motor (compressor).

Food for Thought
FFT 18.3.2. As if the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics were not bad enough for the inventors of
“free energy,” there comes the second law, which ties their hands even more tightly.
Without the second law, one could imagine an engine which takes in a certain amount of energy
and converts it completely into useful work. Now suppose that you take this work and feed it back

Section 18.4
End-of-Chapter Material
271
entirely into the engine to do the work for you to feed into the engine to. . . . This process does
not violate the principle of energy conservation. Of course, it is a useless machine because you
cannot take any part of the work output without having to replace it. In fact, such a machine is
undetectable, because to observe it, the machine has to give oﬀsome energy to the observer.
If the inventors of perpetual motion machines were claiming to have built simply a (unde-
tectable) machine that runs forever, but does not yield any energy for human consumption, they
would not be breaking the energy conservation law. However, their claim goes beyond that. They
tell us that their machines can supply an inﬁnite amount of energy for us to use up. This does
violate the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.
The second law does not allow even an engine described above, because such a machine would
convert the entire energy intake—what we called Qh—into work W, violating the Kelvin-Planck
statement of the second law of thermodynamics. The idea of machines that run on their own while
performing our chores is nothing new. As early as 1618 a London physician named Dr. Fludd
thought of running a mill by using the waterwheel not only to grind ﬂour, but also to drive a pump,
which pours water upstream in the millrace. Fludd’s idea failed, of course, as well as all subsequent
attempts. However, the pursuit of his idea led eventually to the principle of energy conservation.
Heat pumps have become popular as alternatives to other heaters. This is because a
heat pump consumes much less energy than, say a space heater, to deliver the same amount
of heat. It is, therefore, much cheaper to heat a room using a heat pump. Although more
expensive than a space heater, heat pumps are more economical in the long run due to their
low electric consumption. Example D.18.3 on page 42 of Appendix.pdf illustrates this
discussion with some numbers.

Answers to “What do you know?”
18.1. The expansion of material is an increase in volume. To make this increase noticeable,
thermometer makers place the liquid in a thin tube, so that the increase gets translated
almost entirely in a change in height.
18.2. If each particle has an average energy of 3
2kBT, and there are N particles, the total
KE, which for ideal gas is the only energy, is 3
2NkBT. So we write U = 3
2NkBT for an
ideal gas.
18.3. If you add just heat (and no work) then ∆U is not zero. For an ideal gas U depends
only on temperature. Therefore, a change in U means a change in the temperature of the
ideal gas.
18.4.
No! It is possible to add heat to a system and allow the system to do an equal
amount of work. In such a process, the internal energy of the system does not change by
the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. For an ideal gas, this means the temperature does not
change either (see What do you know? 18.2).
18.5.
No! The caloric theory stated that calorie is released only if you bore metals, i.e.,
only when you disintegrate objects. You are not disintegrating your hands when you rub
them together. So, the caloric theory fails. However, the mechanical equivalence of heat
easily explains it by allowing the mechanical energy of the motion of your hands to turn
into heat.
18.6. No, period! No, not if you eat more than you exercise!
18.7. When you add the same amount of heat to A and B, the latter consumes more of it
to excite its internal motion, leaving less for the KE of the molecules. Since KE determines
the temperature, B will have a smaller rise in T than A. To have the same rise as A, B
needs more heat. So, the speciﬁc heat of B is larger than A.
18.8. Maintain the cold reservoir at absolute zero, then the eﬃciency of Box 18.3.1 would
be 1, violating the Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law.

Carnot, one of the founders of the subject, was a French army engineer interested in the
eﬃciency of steam engines. His investigation led to the discovery of an ideal engine bearing
his name, which is also connected to the second law of thermodynamics. However, this
connection between physics and technology should not result in confusing the two. Ideas of
science could start in a variety of ways. Astronomy was motivated by the religious desire
of ﬁnding more about the gods in heaven. Archimedes started hydrostatics because of his
interest in geometry of solids. Most ideas, however, come about simply because of the inner
desire of the scientist to tackle an outstanding problem or an unanswered question.
19.1
Speciﬁcity and Idealization
Aside from the art of thermometry, which started with Galileo’s invention of the ﬁrst
thermometer, the real science of thermodynamics began with the investigation of steam
engines. In fact, for a long time, thermodynamics was the study of engines.
The second law of thermodynamics is a powerful universal law governing systems as small
as a cup of water and as large as the universe itself. Yet it was discovered by examining a
very speciﬁc system, an engine. Furthermore, this engine was not any real engine found in
a mechanics shop; it was an ideal engine concocted only in the minds of physicists in the
form of a schema such as the one shown in Figure 18.3.
Physicists have a natural instinct for idealization.
Recall how Galileo idealized the
blocks and inclines to discover the ﬁrst law of motion; how Newton idealized the Earth-Moon
system to discover the universal law of gravity; how Coulomb idealized two charged metallic
spheres to discover the electrical force between them; and how the physicists working on
the puzzle of magnetism idealized electric currents to an inﬁnitesimal directional current
element. Idealization is an inevitable prerequisite for discovering mathematical laws. And
thermodynamics, with its emphasis on idealizing an engine, is no exception.
The very concept of absolute zero temperature is based on extrapolation and idealiza-
tion. Although the process may cause a revulsion in an underdeterministic philosopher (see
Idealization, the key to
the discovery of absolute
zero!
Section 5.3), the discovery of absolute zero was essentially based on connecting a few points
and extrapolating the resulting line to regions beyond the reach of any experiments. In Fig-
ure 18.2(b), there are only 3 gases and 4 points per gas, making up 12 points altogether.1
Yet these dozen points, when extrapolated, give us the absolute zero.
An underdeterminist would argue like this:

1In an actual experiment, you may have 4 or more gases and more than 4 points for each gas, but the
total number of points will not be more than a few dozen.

276
Chapter 19
Epilogue: Whole and Parts
Because there are only a ﬁnite number of points per gas (it does not matter whether
you have 4 or 40,000 points per gas), the line connecting them is “underdetermined”
and thus wrong! You cannot conclude that the line drawn through those points has
any physical signiﬁcance. How do you know what happens between any two adjacent
points? Even if you ﬁll the space between two adjacent points with thousands of other
new points, how do you know what happens between two adjacent new points you just
added? What is worse is the continuation of the lines into regions that have no points.
This is doubly wrong! Physicists’ conclusion about the absolute zero is wrong! The
entire concept of absolute zero is wrong!
Physicists do not listen to underdeterminists, continue to use extrapolation and idealization,
and discover universal laws, which make the human race a little wiser.
The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, possibly the most universal law of physics (when looked
upon as the law of conservation of energy), was conceived by looking at speciﬁc cases such
as the boring of the cannon or stirring water with a paddle. Joule, in his measurement of
the mechanical equivalent of heat, used a speciﬁc substance (water), a speciﬁc method of
heating it (paddles), and a speciﬁc form of mechanical energy (potential energy of a falling
object). Yet he came up with the universal equivalence of heat (any kind of heat, not just
the one produced by the paddles in a water bucket) and mechanical energy, and set the
stage for the more universal concept of energy and its conservation.
Furthermore, Joule followed the other methodology of science: idealization. He was

aware of the friction between the pulleys and their shafts and the heat produced by such a
friction; yet he ignored it. He was aware of the air drag’s eﬀect on the motion of the pulleys,
the rope attaching the pulleys to the paddle, and the paddle itself; yet he ignored it. He
was aware that he was heating not only the water, but also the air surrounding it; yet he
ignored it. Was he wrong in ignoring so many details? Some philosophers of science believe
that exclusion of such details in a theory makes the theory wrong (see Section 20.2.2).
But scientists not only think that Joule was right, but that science cannot be any other
way! Every great discovery of science has taken place because certain inessential details
were ignored. Scientists are quantiﬁers; they are interested in the magnitude of eﬀects.
Philosophers of science don’t care about magnitudes; they care only about existence or
nonexistence of eﬀects.
Thermodynamic idealization does not end with the ﬁrst and second laws. Many impor-
tant real systems are treated as “ideal gases,” and Equation (17.2) applies to them with
great success. Of course, no real gas is ideal, just as no real surface was inﬁnitely smooth
in Galileo’s derivation of the ﬁrst law of motion (see Section 4.2).
However, when the
friction is small compared to other forces of interest, we treat a real surface as “inﬁnitely
smooth.” Similarly, under certain conditions (conditions that were understood only after
the development of statistical mechanics), a real gas can be treated as an “ideal gas.”
19.2
Continuity
Carnot’s derivation of his famous theorem (see Box 18.3.1) used the erroneous caloric theory
of heat. However, Carnot’s theorem itself is still valid and is a form of the second law of
thermodynamics. After the discovery of the equivalence of heat and energy, Lord Kelvin
using Carnot’s theorem stated his more general statement (given on page 270), later reﬁned
by Planck.
The Kelvin-Planck statement of the second law envisioned an inevitable dissipation of
useful energy.
Rudolph Clausius picked up on the idea of the tendency toward energy
dissipation and introduced the notion of entropy as the ratio of the heat absorbed (or given
oﬀ) by a system divided by the system’s absolute temperature. Using this deﬁnition of the
entropy, Calusius showed that the dissipation of energy is equivalent to the increase in the
entropy of a closed system.

Section 19.3
A Case for “Fundamentalism”
277
We see, therefore, that the overarching statement of the law of the increase of entropy,
which now appears to be completely detached from the speciﬁc (ideal) engine that Carnot
studied, is linked step by step to that engine.
What is even more remarkable is that
the concept of entropy as a measure of the “messiness” of a thermodynamic system (a
concept that could develop only through statistical mechanics) is also connected to Carnot’s
theorem.
19.3
A Case for “Fundamentalism”
The greatest impetus to the development of thermodynamics came when systems were
assumed to consist of a large number of particles and the laws of motion and statistics
were applied to it. Statistical mechanics has completely replaced thermodynamics and has
made a fundamental understanding of the latter’s concepts possible. For example, entropy
which previously was conceived rather artiﬁcially by Clausius as the ratio of heat absorbed
to the absolute temperature, was now deﬁned as the (natural logarithm of the) number of
accessible states. All processes involving various forms of entropy increase, including the
transfer of heat and mixing, could now be explained with this single deﬁnition.
At the heart of statistical mechanics is the probability of individual constituents having
certain physical properties. This probability was discovered by Boltzmann after whom it
The physical properties

system.
is called the Boltzmann factor (see Section 17.2.2). Once this probability is known, all the
macroscopic (thermodynamic) properties of the system can be calculated. It is remarkable
that the Boltzmann factor is given in terms of the physical quantities (mostly the energy)
associated with the individual particles of the system. That is, the bulk property of the
system is determined by the energy of a typical individual particle. For example, if the
particles do not interact with one another, the only energy of a typical particle is its kinetic
energy, and the system becomes an ideal gas. If there are inter-particle forces, then the
system may show liquid and solid properties depending on its temperature. Even relativistic
and quantum mechanical systems, with all their exotic behaviors, can be described by this
simple Boltzmann factor.
The reduction of a thermodynamic system to its individual constituents may be philo-
sophically unacceptable to those who think that “the whole is more than a collection of
its parts.” Nevertheless, statistical mechanics has shown that if we know the energy of
each individual constituent of a thermodynamic system, we can predict the behavior of the
entire system. This energy, of course, includes the interaction energy (the potential energy)
between particles. But even the latter energy is given in terms of the properties (such as
the location and the velocity) of a few (mostly two) particles. So although it is true that
the parts in isolation cannot constitute the whole, once the interaction between pairs of
particles is taken into account, the parts can determine the whole.
The deduction of the bulk properties from the properties of individual constituents is a
proof that physics works best when physicists zoom their mathematical lens into the realm
of the atoms and the subatomic particles. Nevertheless, some philosophers of science call
this natural and rewarding process “fundamentalism,” with all the negative connotations
it carries. They chide those biologists who want to ﬁnd the relation “between larger, richly

endowed, complex [biological] systems, on the one hand, and fundamental laws of physics,
on the other,” and emphasize that they want to go beyond this: “Not only do I want
to challenge the possibility of downward reduction, but also the possibility of ‘cross-wise’
reduction” [Pap 97, p. 316]. They ignore the fact that the tremendous progress in ther-
modynamics in the nineteenth century was the result of applying “fundamentalism” to its
constituents. They are inattentive to all the progress in modern physics which is solely
based on “fundamentalism.” They brush aside the unprecedented advances in biology since
the 1950s, when the “fundamental” unit of life, the DNA molecule, was unraveled.

Thermodynamics and “Social Imagery”
The words in quotation marks in the title of this section are part of the title of an inﬂuential
book written by a sociologist named David Bloor [Blo 83]. In it, Bloor proposes a “strong
programme” designed to show that science, like any other human endeavor, is dependent
on the social conditions under which it is developed. As a starting point, Bloor takes the
undeniable fact that the popular ideas about the workings of the world vary from culture to
culture and from time to time. For example, the cosmology to which Babylonians subscribed
was diﬀerent from Egyptian cosmology, and these two were diﬀerent from the Greek and
Roman cosmologies.
Bloor then takes the obvious fact that science has varied over time and developed by

people of diﬀerent cultural backgrounds, to conclude that science is dependent on the culture
in which it has developed. That is, if relativity were discovered by a Japanese physicist, for
example, it would take a diﬀerent form and content than the one discovered by a German
physicist! To see this, let’s look at what Bloor is saying about mathematics on page 74 of
his book:
Everyone accepts that it is possible to have a relatively modest sociology of mathemat-
ics studying professional recruitment, career patterns and similar topics. This might
justly be called the sociology of mathematicians rather than of mathematics. A more
controversial question is whether sociology can touch the very heart of mathematical
knowledge. . . . By exhibiting the tactics that are adopted to achieve this end, I hope
to convey the idea that there is nothing obvious, natural, or compelling about seeing
mathematics as a special case which will forever defy the scrutiny of the social scientist.
Indeed, I shall show that the opposite is the case.
At the beginning of his book, Bloor goes on to point out two examples relevant to
thermodynamics, which we want to examine here. The ﬁrst one is a fact that we have already
discussed at the beginning of this chapter, namely that thermodynamics started with the
investigation of steam engines. Bloor then equates the motivation for the discovery with the
discovery itself, and ascribes the social conditions in which steam engines were developed
to the science of thermodynamics. Thermodynamics becomes an enlightenment science!
What Bloor fails to do is to mention that the eventual conclusion (what entropy is in terms
of the number of accessible states of a thermodynamic system) is completely detached from
its origin, the steam engines.
19.4.1
Kelvin’s Mistake
The second example of Bloor’s “strong programme” has to do with a mistake Lord Kelvin
made in his calculation of the age of the Earth. It was not really a mistake, but insuﬃcient
knowledge of the workings of the interior of the Earth. Based on the two laws of ther-
modynamics and the theory of heat conduction, Kelvin estimated that it must have taken
Earth 100 to 200 million years to cool down from an initial temperature of 4000–5000 ◦C
to its present temperature. Furthermore, he estimated that the Sun could not have been
illuminating the Earth for much more than a few hundred million years.
These calculations brought Kelvin face to face with Uniformitarian geologists, who be-
lieved that processes such as erosion had been continuing at the same rate for hundreds of
millions of years. Kelvin’s disagreement with these geologists was also an indirect disagree-
ment with Darwin and the theory of evolution, because evolution required certain geological
processes to have been going on for as long as 300 million years.
The debate between the physicists led by Kelvin and the geologists continued to the
end of the nineteenth century. The puzzle of the age of the Earth created a bitter dispute
between the physicists and the geologists, until the discovery of the nuclear radioactivity
and the fact that the heat generated by the radioactive material in the core of the Earth

is suﬃcient to compensate for the loss due to the conduction through the Earth’s crust.
Furthermore, nuclear radioactive processes gave the age of the Earth as over 3 billion years.
Kelvin, of course, was not the ﬁrst physicist to make a mistake. The very process of

correct explanation!
discovery involves many trials and errors (mostly errors). Some of these errors may be more
lasting than others. Classical physics lasted for over 200 years. And physicists believed in
it, because it answered many questions, predicted many unexpected results, and seemed
to work very well in all situations in which it was applied. The twentieth century brought
about two realms in which classical theory failed: the realm of the small, and the realm of
the fast. Physicists, faced with this failure, had to abandon the classical ideas and embrace
the new ideas of quantum and relativity theories.
As soon as radioactivity became a possible explanation for the source of heat generation,
physicists abandoned Kelvin’s estimate and agreed with the geologists that the Earth was
much older than Kelvin had calculated. However, before the discovery of nuclear radioac-
tivity, it was natural (and appropriate) for Kelvin and other physicists to hold on to theories
that had been so deeply rooted in most phenomena of nature. It is essential that physicists
do not give up their theories easily; that only on the face of hard observational evidence do
they abandon their beliefs.2 If physicists accepted any new “theory” simply because of the
insistence of a certain group of people, then physics would no longer be a science.
19.4.2
Bloor’s Opportunity
Kelvin’s scientiﬁc blunder becomes a “social” opportunity for Bloor. Here is Bloor’s assess-
ment of this mistake:
Kelvin’s arguments caused dismay. Their authority was immense and in the 1860’s
they were unanswerable: they followed with convincing rigor from convincing physical
premises. By the last decade of the century the geologists had plucked up courage
to tell Kelvin that he must have made a mistake. This newfound courage was not
because of any new dramatic discoveries, indeed there had been no real change in the
evidence available. What had happened in the interim was a general consolidation in
geology as a discipline with a mounting quantity of detailed observation of the fossil
record. It was this growth which caused a variation in the assessments of probability
and plausibility . . . This example also serves to make another point. It deals with social
processes internal to science, so there is no question of sociological consideration being
conﬁned to the operation of external inﬂuences. [Blo 83, p. 4] [Our emphasis.]
Notice the contradiction in Bloor’s statement: “This newfound courage was not because
of any new dramatic discoveries . . . What had happened in the interim was a general con-
solidation in geology as a discipline with a mounting quantity of detailed observation of the
fossil record.” The “mounting quantity of detailed observation” is not to be considered as
new discoveries!
Bloor is essentially saying that it was the sociological phenomenon of “courage” that
prompted the geologists to (borrowing another sociological term) “stand up against” Kelvin.
He ignores the very “consolidation in geology” as a result of “detailed observation of the
fossil records” that he mentions in the passage.
The reason that geologists “stood up”
against Kelvin (if they ever did) was the only reason that scientists can stand up against
a theory: observation. There is no doubt that social forces play a dominant role in the
development of science and mathematics. The Dark Ages is a frightening example of how
social structure can hamper the development of science for almost two millennia. But to
say that social forces can alter science or mathematics itself —as Bloor is clearly implying
about mathematics in the quote on page 278—is shocking.
2That the evidence presented by the geologists was not “hard” can be deduced from the fact that some
supporters of Darwin’s theory proposed that evolution did not depend on any particular timescale. Since
there was no measure of the evolutionary rate, even 10 million years (rather than 300 million years) might
be suﬃcient for the evolution to take place.


Part V
Twentieth Century Physics:
Quantum Theory


Chapter20
Birth of Quantum Theory
The beginning of the twentieth century seems to have been the converging point for the
three main branches of physics: mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. We
have already seen how thermodynamics and mechanics uniﬁed to give birth to statisti-
cal mechanics, and how this uniﬁcation not only explained mysterious quantities such as
entropy, but also increased our understanding of the ultimate structure of matter.
The next convergence was that of thermodynamics and electromagnetism. After Maxwell
showed that light was an electromagnetic wave, the interest in the study of the production
of light grew rapidly. Intensifying this interest was the investigation of the spectra of stars,
which seemed to provide important hints concerning stellar properties, such as their sur-
face temperatures. Motivated largely by these two developments, physicists turned to a
systematic exploration of the full spectrum of these waves, and discovered quite new forms
of radiation.
20.1
Black Body Radiation
The interest in the connection between heat and radiation goes back to the very beginning
of the nineteenth century when in 1800, William Herschel (1738–1822), the German-British
astronomer, demonstrated that the Sun emits “invisible” radiation that is capable of heating
objects. We now call this infrared radiation. To investigate the visible part of the spectrum,

optical and photographic methods were used, with the latter being also useful for the
ultraviolet part.
In 1896, Friedrich Paschen (1865–1947), extending earlier observations, showed that for
objects emitting radiation in the infrared and visible regions of the spectrum, the wave-
length corresponding to the maximally intense radiation decreased as the temperature of
the radiating object increased. He also discovered an empirical formula which described
the energy density distribution among the various wavelengths of the radiation emitted by
a “perfectly black” object.
The notion of a perfectly black object or simply a black body was introduced by the
German physicist Gustav R. Kirchhoﬀ(1824–1887) who pioneered the systematic theoretical
investigation of radiation due to heat in the late 1850s. At the end of 1859 Kirchhoﬀargued
that at a given temperature and for a given wavelength, the ratio of the power of emission,
denoted by e, to the power of absorption, denoted by a, is the same for all objects. A year
later, Kirchhoﬀdiscussed the relation between e and a in great detail and he also introduced
the concept of a completely black body which is capable of absorbing all radiation falling

upon it. For such a black body, he concluded, the ratio e/a can depend only on the absolute
temperature T, and the wavelength λ. He showed this dependence as e/a = Φ(λ, T). It was

for the function Φ(λ, T) that Paschen discovered an empirical formula in 1896. It was also
this function that attracted the attention of most experimental and theoretical physicists
of the latter part of the nineteenth century.
The physical interpretation of Φ(λ, T) is that if it is multiplied by the diﬀerence between
two neighboring wavelengths, it gives the energy ﬂux in that wavelength range. For this
reason, Φ(λ, T) is called the spectral energy ﬂux. The ﬂux of any physical quantity is
the amount of that quantity crossing a square meter per second. Thus, if we denote by ∆λ
the diﬀerence between two wavelengths, one slightly larger than λ and one slightly smaller,
then Φ(λ, T)∆λ gives the ﬂux of the energy of all radiations whose wavelengths lie within
the ∆λ range.
A laboratory black body consists of a hollow metallic ball, called a cavity, with a small

body [see Figure 20.1(a)]. The EM waves incident on it will enter the cavity and get trapped
there, because they keep getting reﬂected oﬀthe wall of the cavity with the chance to escape
being proportional to the ratio of the area of the opening to the area of the entire cavity
wall. The smaller the opening, the “blacker” the device. Almost all EM waves “shining”
on the opening are absorbed, making it a very good approximation to the ideal black body.
This same black body is also a radiator: Once the cavity is heated up, it gives oﬀEM
radiation. That is why an object that emits EM waves—including light—when heated up
is also called a black body. It, therefore, should not come as a surprise to learn that the

brightest object in the sky, Sun, is (almost) a “black” body. It turns out that
Box 20.1.1. Any object that emits EM waves solely due to heating is called a black
body radiator. We say that a black body radiator is an object in which matter and EM
waves are in thermal equilibrium.
The most detailed study of a black body radiator involved the analysis of the distribution
of the energy of the electromagnetic radiation among various wavelengths. It turned out
that this analysis was completely equivalent to the determination of the function introduced
by Kirchhoﬀ. Since its understanding is crucial in appreciating the black body radiation,
let us concentrate on the energy distribution of electromagnetic radiation.

Section 20.1
Black Body Radiation
285
What do you know? 20.1. Which one of the pair of spherical cavities on the right
is a better approximation to a BBR? Which one on the left? Explain!
Suppose that a black body radiator, such as the Sun,1 is held at a ﬁxed temperature
T. We can send this radiation through an ideal prism (as did Newton) to ﬁnd all of its
component “colors.” In general, this color is not limited to the rainbow colors found by
Newton.
The ideal prism can also detect other colors, i.e., electromagnetic waves with
wavelengths not included in the visible region of the spectrum. To get more information
about the black body, we measure the intensity of various wavelengths: not only do we want
to know what colors are emitted by the radiator at temperature T, but also, for example,
how much brighter (or dimmer) is red compared to green or infrared or ultraviolet, etc.
How does classical EM theory explain the black body radiation? The size of the cavity
in Figure 20.1 is suﬃcient to show the failure of the classical EM theory.
The longer
the wavelength of the wave, the harder it is to “ﬁt” it in the cavity. If the size of the
cavity is, for example, 50 cm, it does not accept wavelengths longer than 50 cm. On the
other hand, any wavelength shorter than 50 cm should be easily accommodated, and the
shorter the wavelength the more “room” for it in the cavity.
So, long wavelengths are
expected to be suppressed, and short wavelengths enhanced beyond limits in such a cavity
[Figure 20.1(b)]. We shall see that this explanation contradicts the observations made at
the end of the nineteenth century!
What do you know? 20.2. The spherical cavity on the right has a radius of 4 cm.
The radius of the one on the left is 2 cm. Which one gives a more intense EM radiation
with the wavelength of 1.7 cm? Explain!
20.1.1
Stefan-Boltzmann Law
In the last decade of the nineteenth century there was an intense search by many experimen-
tal and theoretical physicists to ﬁnd an explanation of the intensity distribution of radiation
among various wavelengths. The ﬁrst theoretical attempts to derive the intensity distribu-
tion function were made by Ludwig Boltzmann and others. Boltzmann deserves particular
attention because his method brought both electromagnetism and thermodynamics into the
treatment of heat radiation. He showed in 1884 that electromagnetic radiation possesses
pressure and, when combined with the second law of thermodynamics, it connects the en-
ergy ﬂux Je (energy radiated from each unit area of the radiator per second), sometimes
called brightness, to the temperature by the formula Je = σT 4, where σ is a constant
and T is the temperature of the radiator in Kelvin. σ has been measured accurately with a
value of 5.67 × 10−8 in the scientiﬁc units we use in this book. So we write this equation as
Stefan-Boltzmann law.
Je = 5.67 × 10−8T 4
(20.1)
and call it the Stefan-Boltzmann law, because the equation had been discovered empir-
ically by Joseph Stefan in 1879. There is no wavelength in this equation because it gives
the total energy ﬂux with contributions coming from all wavelengths.
1As noted above, the Sun is not a “good” black body, but approximates it fairly well.

Wien’s Displacement Law
The next step was taken by Wilhelm Wien (1864–1928). Instead of the total energy density
as given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien was interested in the distribution of energy
among wavelengths. In a typical investigation, one plots the intensity of various wavelengths
emitted by a black body as a function of wavelength. The resulting graph will look similar
to the one plotted in Figure 20.2. This so-called black body radiation curve typically

starts at zero, builds up to a maximum at a wavelength denoted as λmax, and tails oﬀto
zero asymptotically for longer and longer wavelengths.
Wien’s preliminary investigations and theoretical developments laid the foundation upon
which Max Planck later erected the quantum theory of radiation. Working on the idea of
the relation between the temperature, pressure, and the energy density of radiation as well
as the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Wien was able to show that λmax was inversely proportional
to the Kelvin temperature of the black body radiator. His idea is written as
Wien’s displacement
law.
Tλmax = 0.0029,
(20.2)
and is called Wien’s displacement law. It provides a method for determining the tem-
perature of a (distant) black body such as a star. Plotting the curve of such a black body
and reading oﬀλmax from the curve, you can determine the temperature of the distant
radiator.

wavelengths, and plot intensity as a function of wavelength to obtain a curve like Figure 20.2; read

that the temperature of the Sun’s surface is about 6000 K.

to these questions is found (surprisingly) not in the cosmos, but deep within the atom: at its
nucleus. Nuclear fusion converts mass to energy according to the famous E = mc2. The mass
depletion corresponding to the above power is over 4 million tons per second.
Sun loses this
much of its mass every second to shine. So, it will eventually die, but not when it loses all its
mass.
The combination of the nuclear and gravitational processes seal the fate of the Sun far
ahead of its complete annihilation. Chapter 39 discusses these processes in some more detail. The

you want. What convinces me,” they say, “is the real physical measurement of this temperature.”
The beauty and power of science is its interconnectedness. Seemingly unrelated phenomena
may in fact be connected by the intertwining threads in the web of science. This interconnectedness
not only holds the universal fabric of science together, but allows the scientists to constantly check
the “strength” of the threads in the web. If one thread proves to be weak, the entire web may
crumble. That is why the weak connections are constantly replaced by stronger ones. This is what
we call “scientiﬁc progress.”
We have already seen one instance of the interconnectedness of science in Example D.9.2:
through a knowledge of the size of the Earth and two extreme possibilities for its constituent, we
arrived at the upper and lower limits of the value of G, the universal gravitational constant. The
precise measurement of G placed it somewhere in between. Now we oﬀer another way of measuring
Sun’s surface temperature.
If Equation (20.1) [or Equation (20.2), since they are related] is correct and Sun’s surface
temperature is 6000 K, causing it to pour out the power equivalent of 4 trillion trillion one-hundred-
Watt light bulbs, or 3.94 × 1026 Joules of energy every second in all directions, then any sphere
centered at Sun should collect all this energy, and by dividing this energy by the area of that
sphere (which is 4π times the square of its radius), we can calculate how much energy is collected
by every square meter of that sphere. We, homosapiens, happen to be located on a sphere centered
at the Sun with a radius of 1.5 × 1011 m having an area of 2.83 × 1023. Therefore, the energy
collected by each square meter of this sphere is 3.94×1026
2.83×1023 = 1393 Watts/m2. Since Earth is located
on this sphere, it should also collect this much energy per its square meter. The amount of solar
energy hitting every square meter of the Earth’s surface (above the atmosphere) has been measured
and given the name solar constant. Its measured value is 1400 Watts/m2! Of course, there are
those, such as creationists and intelligent designers, who are not convinced by any evidence short
of carrying a thermometer to the Sun and recording the reading on the thermometer!

Max Planck (1858–1947) was aware of Wien’s formula, and he knew how well it agreed
with experiments. However, he did not like the way it was derived; he was after a new
way and a new angle of treating the subject of radiation and thermodynamics and a more
convincing derivation of that formula. Using the idea of entropy, which Planck thought to

be fundamental, he re-derived Wien’s equation and submitted his derivation to Annalen
der Physik in November 1899. Whether his derivation was indeed more rigorous (as he
claimed) or not is a matter of mathematical taste. Of more importance was that his method
of derivation allowed the possibility for generalization to a new formula, whose discovery
was indispensable for the creation of the quantum theory.
20.2.1
The Equation of a Curve
As the derivation of Planck was being printed, there was already experimental indications
that Wien’s formula was wrong. As early as February 1899, Otto Lummer (1860–1923) and
New experiments
disagree with Wien’s
formula.
Ernst Pringsheim (1859–1917), having invented a new method of accurate measurement,
reported discrepancies between theory and their observations to the German Physical So-
ciety in Berlin. To eliminate experimental errors, they worked on the improvement of their
methods in the following months. Later in the year, in the November meeting of the German
Physical Society, Lummer again spoke of the discrepancies, this time with more conﬁdence.
In the ensuing months there was a fervor of experimental and theoretical activities
targeted at Wien’s formula. Many theorists tried to generalize it so that it would agree
with the recent results. To respond to such attacks on his formula, Wien scrutinized it
more carefully and concluded, through thermodynamical arguments, that the formula must
be valid only for short wavelengths and not necessarily for long wavelengths.
In the meantime, progress was being made at the other end of the spectrum both
experimentally and theoretically. On October 7, 1900, Rubens, one of Planck’s experimental
colleagues, visited Planck at the latter’s house and reported his recent ﬁndings concerning
the long-wavelength behavior of black body radiation. He also mentioned the agreement

between his observations with a formula derived by the British physicist Lord John W.S.
Rayleigh (1842–1919) in June. Upon receiving this news, Planck immediately set out to
try to connect the two ends of the black body spectrum. In this respect, he was at a great
advantage over others, because, as mentioned earlier, his derivation of the Wien’s law oﬀered
a much easier path to generalization. He could thus incorporate both Wien’s formula and
Rayleigh’s formula in a single equation involving entropy. This equation gave the entropy
equivalent of Wien’s law when the product λT was small, and that of Rayleigh’s law when
λT was large. This entropy formula could now be translated into a formula for the spectral
energy ﬂux, Φ(λ, T). The historic result was
Φ(λ, T) = b

has reported on these historic events: “The same evening [Sunday, October 7, 1900, when
Rubens visited Planck] he [Planck] reported this formula [Equation (20.3)] to Rubens on a
postcard, which the latter received the following morning ... One or two days later Rubens
again went to Planck, and was able to bring him the news that the new formula agreed
perfectly with his [Ruben’s] observations.” Planck presented his new formula under the
modest title An Improvement of Wien’s Spectral Law to the German Physical Society on
Friday, October 12, 1900. All the subsequent observations and precise measurements, up to
the present, point irrefutably to the correctness of Planck’s black body radiation formula.
As great an achievement as it was in itself, the formula, to Planck, was only a small window
to the esoteric world of radiation.

“Fundamentalism” Oﬀers Quantum to Humanity
The pursuit of perfection and the emphasis on details are qualities found only in the best
of us. It is also a driving force that pushes our civilization onto ever higher grounds. When
Beethoven insists that a single note in a symphony of a few thousand notes should be C
sharp and not D, when Van Gogh spends days on a single spot of his canvas, experimenting
with many diﬀerent hues of a particular color to which most ordinary eyes are insensitive,
and when Dickens turns and tosses in a sleepless night trying to ﬁnd the perfect word or
phrase to put in his novel, in short, when the builders of our civilization go out of their
ways to exalt their creation, they are instinctively pouring out the best of what sets humans
apart from beasts.
In no other discipline is the eﬀect of this pursuit more dramatic than in science. Any
advancement in science opens a new door to new details and new questions. These ques-
tions in turn demand new experiments and technology, causing further advancement in our
theoretical understanding of the subject, thus creating a new stage of the advancement, and
a new cycle of evolution of scientiﬁc thought. With each new stage of scientiﬁc evolution,
we get one step closer to the ultimate demystiﬁcation of the universe, thus, one step farther
in using our knowledge to better our lives.
One of the most momentous instances of this pursuit, upon which our great heritage
of quantum physics is based, is Planck’s attempt at unraveling the mysterious formula,
Equation (20.3). The discovery of a formula that agrees perfectly with experiments is a
Herculean feat for any human being. It requires a truly dedicated scientist, however, to go
beyond the formula and uncover no less a riddle than the riddle of the quantum world. In
deriving Wien’s formula, Planck had used certain well-established thermodynamical prin-
ciples.
On the other hand, Wien’s formula was based on the generalization—therefore,
modiﬁcation—of those very principles. Planck thus concluded that either those principles
had to be changed or new assumptions must be made in the process of his derivation.

call this pursuit of details “fundamentalism” and proclaim that “we [the philosophers] need to
attack” it [Pap 97, p. 314]. Then they go on to assault all fundamental laws of physics, including
Newtonian gravity. Their artillery is the following argument: Newtonian physics cannot predict
where a 1000-dollar bill swept away by the wind will land; therefore, Newtonian theory is wrong.
And by the same token all fundamental laws are wrong.
Fundamentalism and idealization (see Food for Thought 4.2.2 and Section 5.2.4) come hand
in hand: the fundamental laws of physics, as a rule, describe ideal situations. The ﬁrst law of
motion, as stated by Galileo, applies to frictionless surfaces. The second law of motion ﬁnds the
acceleration of a point particle when the applied force is known. All the laws of electricity and
magnetism apply to ideal point charges and straight inﬁnitely thin currents. We cannot deny the
ﬁrst law simply because we cannot ﬁnd a frictionless surface. And the second law and all the laws
of electricity and magnetism hold even though we cannot create a point particle, a point charge,
or an inﬁnitely thin wire.
Newton’s law of gravity applies to objects that are under the inﬂuence of only gravity. Given

that, the law predicts remarkably well the motion of the planets around the Sun, the Moon around
the Earth, a satellite, a projectile, and ballistic missiles (see Section 10.2.2 for some miraculous
achievements of Newtonian physics).
It can even predict the landing of the dollar bill: in the
absence of the atmosphere, the dollar bill lands straight down in a uniformly accelerated motion
with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2. We summarize this by saying “in the absence of the air, the dollar
bill falls on a straight line under gravity.”
Now consider another physical process. Due to thermonuclear reactions, invisible light in the
form of gamma ray is produced at the core of Sun, which travels to the surface losing energy and
becoming visible. Then it leaves the surface of Sun and travels outward in all directions. In the

290

absence of clouds, some of this light reaches the surface of the Earth and is caught by our eyes. We
summarize this by saying “Sun shines.” If we challenge the accuracy of the statement “the dollar
bill falls on a straight line under gravity” because of the presence of the atmosphere on Earth,
then we have to challenge the accuracy of the statement “Sun shines” because of the presence of
of clouds in the sky!
This kind of philosophy is contaminated with the same kind of pragmatism that held back
science for almost 2000 years under the Roman ideology. If we deny the laws of physics because
the conditions for their absolute validity are never met in real-life situations; if we deny Newtonian
physics because it cannot predict the random motion of a 1000-dollar bill swept away by the wind,
then we are following the path of the ancient Romans who disregarded the beautiful Greek science
developed over 300 years because they could not ﬁnd a real-life situation in which it was directly
applicable.
Planck had used purely thermodynamical reasoning to reach Wien’s formula; and until
the discrepancy with observation was discovered by Rubens, he was completely satisﬁed with
this approach. However, there was another school of thought, led by Ludwig Boltzmann,
which advocated the statistical-mechanical explanation of thermodynamics. Planck did not
belong to this group, and, in fact, he was opposed to such a line of thinking. However, after
the success of Equation (20.3), and the realization that his cherished thermodynamical
principles might be at stake, he leaned more and more towards statistical mechanics. In his
Nobel lecture in 1920, Planck recalled this proselytism: “This problem ... [did not lead] me
automatically to a consideration of the connection between entropy and probability, that
is, to Boltzmann’s trends of ideas, until after some weeks of the most strenuous work of
my life, light came into the darkness and a new, hitherto undreamt of perspective began to
open up for me.”

A Fundamental Discovery
This “undreamt of perspective” turned out to be a perspective for all humankind, a radical
departure from every scientiﬁcally “sacred” hypothesis, a toe-deep submersion into the
ocean of the microworld. This perspective was the principle of the quantization of EM
radiation. Planck reached this principle in mid-November of 1900, but presented it publicly

day the quantum theory was born.
BIOGRAPHY
Max Planck (1858–1947) was born into an academic family, his father, his grandfather, and his great-
grandfather all being professors. He attended the famous Maximilian Gymnasium in Munich, where
music was perhaps his best subject, but because of the encouragement of his physics teacher, he turned
to physics and mathematics at the end. In July 1874, at the age of 16, Planck entered the University of
Munich and took some courses in physics and mathematics. When he enquired about the prospects of
research in physics, the professor of physics at Munich told him that physics was essentially a complete
science with little prospect of further developments. However, 21 years after receiving his doctorate
with a thesis on the second law of thermodynamics, Planck showed that physics was just beginning with
his quantum theory of 1900.
Boltzmann’s formulation of statistical mechanics showed that the higher the energy of
a “particle” in a thermodynamic substance, the fewer the number of such particles. Math
Note E.20.2 on page 109 of Appendix.pdf pursues this line of reasoning and concludes
that
• a black body radiates EM waves in the form of “particles” or bundles or quanta; and
• the energy of each quantum is proportional to its frequency.

Section 20.2

If, as is customary, we denote the constant of proportionality by h, the relation between
energy of a quantum of EM radiation and its frequency (or wavelength) can be written as
Planck relation.
E = hf,
or

(20.4)
where h is called the Planck constant, and has a value of h = 6.626 × 10−34 J·s.
Example 20.2.2. Let us look at the energies associated with some familiar EM waves. X-rays
have a wavelength of about 10−10 m. So, the energy of their quanta is the product of the Planck
constant and the speed of light divided by 10−10. This gives 1.99 × 10−15 J. It is more common to
express such small energies in terms of electron volt (see Example 12.3.2), which is 1.6 × 10−19 J.
The energy of an X-ray is thus 1.99 × 10−15/1.6 × 10−19 or 12437.5 eV or about 12 keV (kilo eV).
Similarly, violet light, with a wavelength of 4 × 10−7 m has an energy of 4.97 × 10−19
J or
about 3 eV, while the energy of red light, with a wavelength of 7 × 10−7 m is 2.84 × 10−19
J or
about 1.77 eV.
Going to the long-wavelength part of the EM spectrum, microwaves, with a wavelength of 1 cm
have an energy of 1.99 × 10−23 J, or about 0.00012 eV, and radio waves with a wavelength of 1 m
have an energy of 0.0000012 eV.

With the assumption of the quantization of energy of EM radiation, one can derive
(20.3) and express a and b in terms of more fundamental quantities. In fact, the spectral
energy ﬂux function of Equation (20.3) turns out to be of the form

placement law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The interested reader can ﬁnd the details in

FFT 20.2.3. The Carcinogenic EMF?
The insatiable appetite of the public for sensation-
alism, and the equally insatiable appetite of the news media for attaining top ratings, have had
a devastating eﬀect on science and rational thinking. The case in point is the scare generated by
some “investigative” reporters, who “discovered” that electromagnetic ﬁelds can cause cancer.
Nancy Wertheimer was an unemployed epidemiologist, who in 1979 drove around Denver look-
ing for the “cause” of leukemia in children.2 She noticed that many of the addresses of the victims
of the disease were near power transformers. She sought the advice of a physicist named Ed Leeper,
and together they reported that “high” magnetic ﬁelds were the cause of childhood leukemia.
Despite its ﬂaws, the Wertheimer-Leeper report could not be dismissed. The magnitude of our

exposure to EM waves is so enormous that even the slightest connection with cancer was cause for
concern. Suddenly, there were reports of the growth of cancer rate among electrical workers; of the
increase in miscarriages among women working at the computers; of farmers with power lines in
their ﬁelds reporting that cows no longer gave milk, and chickens laid no eggs. Although none of
these stories was substantiated by reliable statistical evidence, each new anecdote added fresh fuel
to the inferno.
As mentioned in Example D.14.1, the energy of the EM wave is of no concern. However, the fact
that the magnetic ﬁeld is alternating may require some attention. It turns out that an alternating
magnetic ﬁeld can create a small electrical current in the body due to Faraday’s law of induction
(see Section 13.4.1). A consequence of this law is that the induced current is proportional to the
frequency of the alternating magnetic ﬁeld. Could these small currents somehow interfere with the
body’s defense mechanism against cancer?
2Most of this Food for Thought is adapted from Voodoo Science, by Robert Park [Par 02].

Chapter 20
Birth of Quantum Theory
In June of 1989, the New Yorker ran a three-part series of articles on the hazards of power-line
ﬁelds. The author of these articles was a veteran reporter named Paul Brodeur, who began his jour-
nalistic career exposing dark secrets of the CIA, and then switched to reporting on environmental
and occupational hazards in 1968. His specialty, however, was microwaves.
A by-product of war technology,3 microwaves were especially prone to suspicion by Brodeur as
the “waves of terror,” because most of the research on their biological eﬀects had been supported by
the Department of Defense, which concluded that microwaves were safe. When industry scientists
reported similar ﬁndings, Brodeur saw it as a collusion of the electronics industry with the military.
When scientists at universities dismissed any hazard associated with microwaves, he enlarged his
umbrella of conspiracy to cover the academic scientists as well.
So, when the Wertheimer-Leeper report attracted the attention of the public to the hazards of
the power-line “ﬁelds,” there was no doubt in Bordeur’s mind that the new hazards were of exactly
the same nature as his evil microwaves regardless of the fact that microwave frequencies are about
100 million Hertz while the power-line ﬁelds had a frequency of only 50–60 Hertz!
The power-line panic soon spread among the public like an epidemic.
In response to the
environmental groups, many governments instigated thorough studies of the controversy. In 1994
a four-year study of 223,000 Canadian and French electrical workers reported that there was no
increase in cancer risk associated with occupational exposure to EMF. A year later an even larger
study of US electrical workers concluded that no increased risk of cancer was evident among the
workers. In fact, both studies found the cancer rate among electrical workers to be lower than the
general population. (But no scientist will conclude that EMF cures cancer; although one may ask
why Wertheimer and Leeper don’t!)
The bias inherent in the “study” of an investigative reporter guided by a mission can asso-
ciate the eﬀect with the cause of her choice. But an unbiased scientiﬁc investigation, in which the
strength of the quantities in question are measured and the data are carefully analyzed, reveals a
diﬀerent outcome. As the chair of the review panel of the National Academy of Sciences summa-
rized its exhaustive three-year study, “The question is what causes the association [with childhood
leukemia]. . . . We don’t know,” but he pointed out that neighborhoods with heavy concentration
of power lines are usually poor, congested, and polluted—all of which are risk factors for cancer.
Partly due to such sensational journalism, there have been hundreds of lawsuits ﬁled by cancer
patients blaming EM radiation for their illness. And there have been thousands of “documentaries”
aired by the sensationalist TV industry linking cancer to EM waves. In all these cases, there are
of course “experts” who testify to the “scientiﬁc” validity of the claims, citing “researches” and
“studies” to prove their points.
In a recent case, a Maryland neurologist claimed that his brain cancer was caused by cell
phone use, and he asked 800 million dollars for damages.
His claim rested on research by a
Swedish oncologist, who published a study in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention that
found long-term users of analog cell phones were at least 30% more likely to develop brain tumors
than nonusers. This study was extensively reported by media. However, a review of epidemiological
research on cell phone use, commissioned by the Swedish Radiation Protection Authority, described
the study as “non-informative” and concluded that “there is no scientiﬁc evidence for a causal
association between the use of cellular phones and cancer.” This report was not mentioned by any
popular media outlet, but was suﬃcient to dismiss the Maryland case.
It is well known that all cancer-causing agents act by breaking chemical bonds to produce
mutant strands of DNA. Such chemical bonds require energies of about an electron volt. As we
saw in Example 20.2.2, microwaves used in cell phones have an energy of 0.00012 eV, several
hundred times weaker than the energy needed to break a DNA bond! This means that there is
nearly as much chance to break a DNA bond with microwaves—and thus cause cancer—as to kill
a man by throwing cotton balls at him!

relocating power lines and loss of property values. It is a staggering $25 billion! Was there not
better venues of spending this money? Would it not have been better to fund the research aimed at
truly ﬁghting cancer? As long as the citizenry cannot diﬀerentiate between the rational cause for
concern and the sensational panic howled by a biased reporter, such enormous plunders of resources
are inevitable.

Photoelectric Eﬀect
Planck had much diﬃculty convincing (ﬁrst himself, then) the physics community of the
validity of his new revolutionary ideas. Many of the older generation of physicists resisted
the idea of quantization of energy. But the emerging new generation embraced the idea and
developed it to its fullest capacity. One member of this generation was a clerk at the Bern
patent oﬃce. His name was Albert Einstein.
The year 1905 was the most productive year in the life of Albert Einstein, and possibly
of any scientist in history. In that same year, he discovered the special theory of relativity,
unraveled the Brownian motion (the random motion of objects under microscopes caused
by its bombardment by the molecules of the solution), and explained the photoelectric
eﬀect.
When Heinrich Hertz was testing the success of Maxwell’s prediction of EM waves,
he was simultaneously paving the way for the antithesis of the wave theory, namely the
particle theory of EM radiation. He realized that when the surfaces of the metallic balls
used in producing sparks were polished, more sparks were produced. Later it was realized
that the ultraviolet component of the spark light was capable of releasing negative charges
(subsequently identiﬁed as electrons) from the clean surface of metals—thus the name,
photoelectric eﬀect.
The existence of the photoelectric eﬀect could be explained by the classical wave theory
of light. After all, it is conceivable that by shining some intense EM radiation on a metallic
surface, one could provide enough energy to the electrons inside the metal to “jump” outside
it. However, it was the details of this phenomenon that required a drastic shift in our view of
the nature of light. The details that were subsequently discovered are as follows. Consider
the photoelectric cell of Figure 20.3 consisting of two plates in a tube, from inside of which
air has been pumped out (thus called a vacuum tube).
• Shine light of a given frequency on the left plate (also called the cathode), and observe
that a current has been established, indicating the emission of electrons from the
plate.
If you increase the intensity of that light you’ll observe an increase in the
current, indicating the emission of a larger number of electrons from the plate. This
is what is expected classically.
• The electrons ejected from the cathode have a kinetic energy (KE) right after ejection.
This KE varies from electron to electron, but it is easy to measure the maximum energy
of the electrons. If we reverse the polarity of the battery, then not all electrons will

294
Chapter 20

make it to the right plate. In fact, if the voltage of the reversed battery is too high,
there will be so much negative charge on the right plate—and, therefore, so strong a
repulsion on the incoming electrons—that no electrons will reach the right plate (and
no current detected). So, if you start at a low voltage, and increase it slowly, you will
reach a threshold voltage at which all the electrons will be stopped. This is called the
Stopping potential.
stopping potential. Denote it by Vstop, and note that it is equal to the potential
diﬀerence between the two plates. At this potential, the electrons with maximum KE
will just barely make it to the right plate. Conservation of energy then implies that
eVstop, where e is the charge of the electron, must equal KEmax.
Classically, we expect that increasing the intensity of the incident light should increase
KEmax, so that to completely stop the ﬂow of electrons, the stopping potential should
be increased as well.
Not so!
Observation shows that no matter how intense the
incident light, the stopping voltage remains constant.
• How does Vstop depend on frequency? Classically, we expect no dependence on fre-
quency, because the energy of a wave does not depend on its frequency. Experiments,
however, indicate that Vstop is very much frequency-dependent, and that there is a
minimum frequency f0, below which—regardless of the intensity—no electrons are
emitted, and no voltage is necessary to stop them (so that Vstop = 0 for this fre-
quency). It is also found experimentally that f0 varies from metal to metal.
• Because the relevant energy-related quantity for an EM wave is the energy ﬂux [see
Equation (D.14)], i.e., the amount of energy incident on a square meter of the metal
per second, classically, we expect to impart more energy to the electrons the more
intense the light and the longer we let it shine on the plate. Experiments completely
contradict this conclusion. If the frequency of light is below f0, no matter how intense
the light and how long you wait, no electrons are ejected. On the other hand, once the
frequency is increased above f0, even the weakest light beam produces photoelectrons
instantaneously.
All these puzzles were solved in a 1905 paper by Einstein entitled humbly, “On a Heuris-
Einstein explains
photoelectric eﬀect by
inventing photons.
tic Point of View Concerning the Generation and Transformation of Light.” In solving the
riddle of photoelectric eﬀect, Einstein assumed the following:
• Light (or more generally, any EM wave) consists of bundles or particles, which were
later called photons. A photon of frequency f, or wavelength λ, carries an energy
E = hf = hc/λ, as given by Planck.
• Electrons are bound to the photoelectric metal by an energy W, called the work
function, which varies from metal to metal.
• If a photon hits one (and only one) electron, and imparts all its energy to that electron,
then the electron acquires the maximum possible KE. Those electrons that receive less
than the entire energy of a photon will have a smaller KE. Before being able to impart
any KE to an electron, a photon must ﬁrst overcome the binding energy with which
the electron adheres to the metal.
Thus, basing his argument simply on the conservation of energy, Einstein came up with
the photoelectric equations, which are given—along with the illustration of a couple of their
uses—in Example D.20.2 on page 43 of Appendix.pdf .

Answers to “What do you know?”
20.1. In the pair on the right, the cavity with a smaller hole is a better approximation to
a BBR, because smaller hole gives less chance to the EM radiation inside to escape. In the
pair on the left, the larger cavity is a better approximation to a BBR, because the trapped
EM wave has more volume in which to remain trapped.
20.2. The wavelength of 1.7 cm is comparatively shorter for the bigger cavity than for the
smaller one. Hence, the intensity of this wavelength from the bigger cavity is larger.

Black Body An idealized black object, one that absorbs 100% of the EM waves that fall
on it. Being a perfect absorber, it is also a perfect radiator.
Brightness The ﬂux of electromagnetic radiation energy.
Flux (of a physical quantity) The amount of a physical quantity crossing a square meter
per second. Flux is a local quantity: Pick a point; pick a small loop perpendicular to
the motion of the quantity; see how much of that quantity passes through the loop in
one second; divide this by the area of the loop. That’s how you ﬁnd the ﬂux of the
quantity in question.

Chapter21
The Atoms
The development of Planck’s and Einstein’s ideas of quanta eventually became tied to the
understanding of the simplest atom, hydrogen. But the road to hydrogen was a long and
bumpy road extending all the way back to the ﬁfth century BC when the idea of “atom”
acquired some serious credibility by the teachings of Democritus. Later, Epicurus, in trying
to explain his primacy of senses, used the idea of an atom as the agent that stimulates
sensation. Epicurean philosophy has survived in the writings of Lucretius, a Roman poet
(see Section 42.1.1).
21.1
Modern Atomic Theory
The atomic theory of Democritus, Epicurus, and Lucretius lay dormant for over sixteen
centuries until post-Renaissance “natural philosophers” adorned it with experimental test-
ing and mathematical precision. Robert Hooke (1635–1703) used the atomic hypothesis to
explain the “spring” of the air, which causes the restoration of, say a piston, when it is
pushed in a cylinder full of air. He proposed that the spring of the air results entirely from
the collision of atoms with the surface of their container.
Beginning of scientiﬁc
atomism.
Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782), another “modern” atomist, was a prodigious child born
into a family with an extraordinary lineage of mathematicians and physicists. He applied
Newton’s laws of motion to a gas assuming that it was a collection of many particles. He
showed that if a gas is imagined to consist of a large number of small particles, “driven
hither and thither with a very rapid motion,” their myriad collisions with one another and
with the walls of their container would explain the phenomenon of pressure (see Section
17.1).
Dalton: father of
scientiﬁc atomism.
With the development of experimental chemistry in the nineteenth century, atomic the-
ory found its empirical domain in the works of John Dalton (1766–1844). Dalton was a
self-educated Quaker who came across copies of Newton’s Principia and Robert Boyle’s
Works in the library of a high school where he was a teacher. In Principia, Newton had
speculated that the smallest indivisible bodies followed the laws of motion; that certain
“hitherto unknown” forces were responsible for the adherence of these particles, or their
recession from one another. Dalton decided to search for these indivisible particles and to
include them in a quantitative scheme.
Having been involved with meteorology for some time, he chose air as his point of
departure, and later generalized his investigation to all gases. The so-called “Law of Deﬁnite
Proportions” proposed in 1788 by the French chemist, Joseph Louis Proust (1754–1826),
was the ﬁrst experimental clue for unraveling the mysteries of atoms. According to this law,
a chemical compound can contain “elements” in the ratio of whole numbers. The law of

300

The Atoms
deﬁnite proportions could easily be explained by supposing that each element was made up
of indivisible particles. If the particle of element X weighed three times that of the element

proportions: the
beginning of the atomic
theory.
Y , and the compound was formed by combining one particle of each element, the ratio by
weight would be 3 to 1 and never 3.5 to 1 or 2.5 to 1.
Dalton noticed that sometimes elements might combine in diﬀerent proportions to pro-
duce diﬀerent compounds, and enunciated the law of multiple proportions in 1803. The
explanation of this law, according to Dalton, was that a particle of a single element, such
as carbon, might have a tendency to unite with various numbers of particles of a second
element, such as oxygen, to produce diﬀerent compounds. Thus, he explained, a particle
of carbon may combine with one particle of oxygen to produce carbon monoxide, or it can
combine with two particles of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide.
The more he examined the compounds the more evidence he found for the “indivisible
particles.” He did not have any diﬃculty ﬁnding a name for these indivisible particles.
They had been named more than two millennia before by Democritus of Abdera: Dalton
had ﬁnally “discovered” atoms! He published the results of his experiments in his epoch-

making TABLE: Of the Relative Weights of Ultimate Particles of Gaseous and Other Bodies.
Taking the weight of the hydrogen as 1, he itemized twenty-one elements in this Table.
Dalton only laid the foundation. The forthcoming generations of chemists and physicists
would build a marvelously imposing ediﬁce on this foundation. Amadeo Avogadro (1776–
1856), the Italian chemist, showed that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and
pressure contained equal number of “particles.” By simple weighing of these equal volumes,
chemists could determine the relative weight of the particles of various gases.
Once the diﬀerence between an atom and a molecule was established, and the nature
of the constituents of a gas—whether they were in atomic or molecular form—recognized,
the notion of atomic weight was introduced. If the lightest element, hydrogen, is given
Atomic weight.
the weight 1, other elements could be weighed accordingly. For example, oxygen gas, which
consists of diatomic molecules, would be given the weight 32.
By mid nineteenth century, chemistry was developed to a point where certain patterns
and similarities among elements were emerging. For example, the group of elements called
halogens consisting of ﬂuorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I)—although
having very diﬀerent physical properties and masses—have the strikingly similar property
of having a strong tendency to combine with many metals to form white crystalline salts.
Another group referred to as the alkali metals, includes lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium
(K), rubidium (Rb), and cesium (Cs). These elements have a long list of identical chemical
properties.
Such similarities among elements of completely diﬀerent masses prompted Dmitri Men-
deleev (1834–1907), the Russian chemist, to suggest that if elements were arranged in the
order of increasing atomic weight, then groups of elements of similar characteristics would
recur periodically. This periodic table of elements was a powerful tool for chemists in

which to group many diverse elements and study them as a whole. Furthermore, careful
placement of elements indicated some empty spots in the table, which presumably belonged
to the as-yet-undiscovered elements. The discovery of such “missing” elements gave much
credence to the table as well as Dalton’s atomic hypothesis.
The success of the atomic theory in chemistry rendered the theory so convincing that now
physicists started to take it seriously. In 1860, James Clerk Maxwell began his mathematical
investigation of the motion of molecules in a gas, and showed that these molecules have
varying speeds: very few of them have very small or very large velocities while most of
them have intermediate velocities. Independently, Ludwig Boltzmann came to the same
conclusion in 1871 (see Chapter 17).

21.2
Dissecting Atoms
As the modern concept of the atom gained popularity among chemists and physicists, more
and more attention was given to individual atoms. Since there were so many diﬀerent atoms
with varying physical and chemical properties, it became plausible to assume that they are
made up of some simpler entity. Hydrogen, being the lightest atom, was a good candidate
for the building block of all other elements, and much attention was given to it. However,
it was soon realized that hydrogen itself was a composite entity.
We have already mentioned electrons in connection with the photoelectric eﬀect. Prior
to 1897, they were collectively called cathode rays. Many physicists, including Heinrich
Hertz, who produced the ﬁrst artiﬁcial EM wave and stumbled on the ﬁrst indication of the
photoelectric eﬀect, were studying the rays that emanated from the cathode of the vacuum
tube. The nature of these rays were quite a mystery, with many people believing that they
were oscillation of ether, or some form of EM radiation.
Joseph John (J. J.) Thomson (1856–1940), the British physicist and director of the
Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University, in his famous 1897 paper, “Cathode Rays,”
established quite convincingly that cathode rays were really a beam of negatively charged
particles, whose charge-to-mass ratio (e/m ratio) he determined fairly accurately.
And

indivisible.
when the charge of these particles, now called electrons, was determined by the American
physicist Robert A. Millikan (1868–1953), their mass was found to be orders of magnitude
smaller than even the lightest atom, hydrogen. For the ﬁrst time in the history of science,
a particle was discovered that was lighter than the lightest atom. It was therefore natural
to assume that hydrogen atom itself (as well as any other atom) must have structure, and
that electron must be part of that structure.
BIOGRAPHY
Joseph J. Thomson (1856–1940) was born in 1856 in Cheetham Hill, Manchester in England, of
Scottish parentage.
In 1870 he studied engineering at University of Manchester, and moved on to
Trinity College, Cambridge in 1876. In 1880, he obtained his BA in mathematics and MA in 1883.
A year later he became Cavendish Professor of Physics. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1906, “in recognition of the great merits of his theoretical and experimental investigations on the
conduction of electricity by gases.” He was knighted in 1908 and appointed to the Order of Merit in
1912. One of Thomson’s greatest contributions to modern science was in his role as a highly gifted
teacher, as seven of his research assistants and his son, George Paget Thomson, won Nobel Prizes in
physics. His son won the Nobel Prize in 1937 for proving the wavelike properties of electrons. In 1918
J. J. Thomson became Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, where he remained until his death. He
died on 30 August 1940 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to Sir Isaac Newton.
If negative electrons are part of the atom, then an amount of positive charge equal to
the charge of the electrons must reside inside the atoms, because atoms were known to be
neutral. The question now was “How are the positive charges and the electrons distributed
inside an atom?” The ﬁrst suggestion came from Thomson himself, who imagined atoms as
a sort of “raisin pudding.” He considered the positive charge as being the background (the
pudding) in which the electrons were embedded like raisins.
It is remarkable enough that, by the force of observation, a composition for the invisible
atom had to be hypothesized. But it is even more remarkable that this hypothesis could
actually be tested.
Between 1909 and 1911, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937)—who had
come to Cambridge to work with J. J. Thomson—and two of Rutherford’s coworkers, Hans
Geiger (1882–1945) and Ernest Marsden (1889–1970), carried out a series of experiments
that proved the Thomson model of the atom wrong.
Rutherford had performed some experiments involving the bombardment of heavy atoms
with alpha particles, and asked Geiger to analyze the data and look for the scattering
of the alpha particles. Geiger found no appreciable scattering (only of the order of one

degree). Then in 1911, upon the recommendation of Geiger, Rutherford suggested to the
young Marsden to repeat the earlier experiments and see if he could detect some backward
scattering of alpha particles. What happened next was history. Rutherford later recalled:
Then I remember two or three days later Geiger coming to me in great excitement and
saying, “We have been able to get some of the α-particles coming backwards. . . .” It

was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was
almost as incredible as if you ﬁred a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came
back and hit you. On conclusion, I realized that this scattering backwards must be the
result of a single collision, and when I made calculations I saw that it was impossible to
get anything of that order of magnitude unless you took a system in which the greater
part of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a minute nucleus. [Hol 01, p. 418]
To appreciate Rutherford’s argument, consider a swarm of alpha particles impinging on
a sheet of a heavy metal such as gold. If the gold atoms were as Thomson suggested, then
we should see something like Figure 21.1, because the positive (and heavy) alpha particle
encounters a more or less uniform distribution of positive charge and therefore a more or
less uniform repulsion in all directions. The net result of repulsion is therefore almost zero.
If the electrons are distributed almost uniformly throughout the atom, the same reasoning
applies to give a net attraction of zero. On the other hand, if the distribution of electrons

angles.
is not uniform, because of the fact that the electrons are so much lighter than the alpha
particles, it will be the electrons that undergo large scattering not the alpha particles. It
follows that the Thomson model of the atom is incapable of explaining large scatterings.
Food for Thought
FFT 21.2.1. Prior to Rutherford, the study of atoms focused on their combination in chemical
reactions, whose eﬀects were visibly tangible: a gas combined with another gas to form a liquid;
a gas and a liquid combined to form a solid; two colorless liquids combined to yield a bright red
liquid. As long as the atomic hypothesis helped explain these visible phenomena, one could live
with it.
But Rutherford, the skeptic philosophers would argue, was now telling us that he was “looking”
inside the atom (to ﬁnd its nucleus), and he was using abstract mathematics and physics as his
tools. How can we be sure that atoms actually exist and are not some mental constructs that
merely facilitate our understanding of certain phenomena? After all, we never have any direct
sensory evidence for atoms. This view has persisted among a large group of the philosophers of
science. If we extend this kind of argument to its logical limit, we have to deny what we see under

existence of invisible EM radiation and all of its manifestations including radios and televisions.
People aﬄicted with color-blindness do not deny the existence of color simply because they never
have any direct sensory evidence for color. They have learned about their sensory limitation, and
rely on the experience of others concerning colorful matters. We, as human beings, have to learn
and accept our biological limitations and—for our perception of reality—rely on the only truly
solid collective knowledge of our race, science.
When Rutherford probed the interior of atoms by shooting alpha particles at them, he was
relying on the repeatedly tested laws of nature: he relied on the fact that KE is given by 1
2mv2,
that the force between two charged particles was given by F = keq1q2/r2, that the gravitational
force between these particles is negligibly small, that the (electrical) potential energy of a system
of two particles was PE = keq1q2/r, that energy was conserved, that . . . . And if all of these proven
laws lead to the deﬁnite conclusion that atoms have a very small positive nucleus, then we have
to accept that conclusion. And this conclusion, though unperceived by any of our senses, becomes
part of our knowledge to be used in the future to further our understanding of nature.
Now consider a diﬀerent model, the one proposed by Rutherford, in which the positive
charge is concentrated in a very small region of the atom. For the same reason as above,
we can neglect the eﬀect of the electrons. Figure 21.2 illustrates the essential points of
Rutherford’s argument. Because of the small size of the positive charge, most alpha particles
will pass through the atom far away from the nucleus as in Figure 21.2(a) and will not be
aﬀected by the atom. Few alpha particles get relatively close to the nucleus and are scattered

by a small angle as in Figure 21.2(b). On very rare occasions, an alpha particle will collide
with the nucleus head-on and gets scattered backwards [Figure 21.2(c)].
This does not
mean that the alpha particle actually touches the nucleus. The electric repulsion by the
nucleus becomes inﬁnitely strong when the alpha particle gets a chance to hit it. Since
alpha particles are quite energetic, this impact could knock the nucleus out of the atom,
unless the nucleus happens to be extremely heavy. Lack of observation of any nuclei being
knocked out of atoms indicates that the nucleus of the atom is indeed very heavy.
Rutherford-Geiger-Marsden experiments therefore give us the following picture of an
atom:
A new picture of the
atom.
• An atom is generally neutral, with equal amount of positive and negative charges.
• The negative charge consists of the electrons.
• The positive charge is concentrated in the nucleus of the atom, which is about
1/100,000 the size of the atom itself. Therefore, an atom is mostly empty space.1
• The mass of the atom is almost entirely concentrated in the nucleus.

with nucleus playing the role of Sun and the electrons the role of the planets. However this
planetary model of the atom did not last very long.
Recall from Chapter 14 that accelerating charges radiate EM waves, and since EM
waves carry energy, the accelerating charge loses energy. Math Note E.21.1 on page
109 of Appendix.pdf calculates the energy of the electron of a hydrogen atom when it is
located at a typical distance of 10−10 m from the nucleus, and ﬁnds the energy to be about
−1.15 × 10−18 J.
What do you know? 21.2. What is the signiﬁcance of the fact that the energy of
the electron is negative?
Math Note E.21.1 also shows that the electron rotates around the nucleus with a fre-
quency of 2.53 × 1015 Hz, which is the frequency of the EM wave produced as a result
of this rotation.
The energy of such a wave is obtained from the Planck-Einstein rela-
tion, Erad = hf, which, upon the substitution of the values of the Planck constant and
electron’s rotational frequency, yields Erad = 1.68 × 10−18 J. It follows that the energy
of the electron reduces by this amount after the emission of the radiation and becomes
Enew = −2.83 × 10−18 J. Using Equation (E.57) of Math Note E.21.1, we can evaluate the
new radius of the electron’s orbit. It turns out to be 4.1×10−11 m. The electron has gotten

closer to the nucleus. Since speed increases with decreasing radius [see Equation (E.54) of
the Math Note], the electron is now moving faster, its frequency is therefore larger, and
again by Planck-Einstein formula, it radiates more energy, and its radius decreases by a
larger factor than before. This snowball eﬀect continues until the electron collapses com-
pletely into the nucleus. One can calculate the loss of energy and the decrease of the radius
classically (without resort to the Planck-Einstein relation), but the calculation is much more
involved and beyond the scope of this book. The overall conclusion, however, is independent
of the formula for energy. It can be shown that the entire process of collapse takes place in
less than 10−8 s. Thus, this so-called planetary model of the atom fails.
The discovery of the nucleus had created a seemingly insurmountable barrier on the
path to understanding the structure of the atom.

group were trying to come up with a model of the atom that did not collapse. Niels Bohr
found a (partial) solution. Coming from the continent, he was at an advantage, because he
was one of the few who knew the newly discovered quantum theory of Planck and Einstein.
And he used it to invent a stable model of the (hydrogen) atom.

because of its simplicity: one light electron interacting with a heavy (and almost immovable)

emitted photon by Eγ, then Eγ = Ei −Ef. The frequency and wavelength of this photon
can then be determined by the Planck-Einstein relation Eγ = hf, or Eγ = hc/λ. Example
D.21.1 on page 44 of Appendix.pdf gives a numerical application of this.
BIOGRAPHY
Niels Bohr (1885–1962) (right) attended Grammelholms school from 1891 to 1903. He did well at
school without ever being brilliant. If he really excelled at a subject it was physical education. He
and his brother Harald (left) were excellent soccer players. Harald, an excellent mathematician, even
won a silver medal playing soccer for Denmark. Bohr entered the University of Copenhagen in 1903,
receiving his doctorate in May 1911. With a travel grant from the Carlsberg Foundation, he went to the
mecca of physics, Cavendish Laboratory in England to work with J. J. Thomson. After a few months
he transferred to the Rutherford group where exciting new discoveries were being made. It was here
that the foundation of the Bohr model of the atom was laid.

for H-atom. An arrow connects the initial level to the ﬁnal level. The transitions on the
left (to n = 1) and on the right (to n = 3) are invisible, as explained below. Out of all the
transitions to n = 2 only four are visible. These are shown in the middle of the diagram.
Although there are inﬁnitely many of them, one can in principle, calculate the wave-
lengths of all the photons emitted by a hydrogen atom. Among these only a ﬁnite number
are visible. We can identify them as follows. First we note that no transition to the n = 1
energy level creates a visible photon. This is because the lowest-energy photon for such
transitions is the one emitted when the electron jumps from the n = 2 to n = 1 orbit.
The energy of the photon, obtained from Figure 21.3, is Eγ = −3.4 −(−13.6) or 10.2 eV.
Example 20.2.2 calculated the energy range of the visible spectrum: it was from 1.77 eV for
red to 3 eV for violet. So the 10.2-eV photon is not visible. All the other photons resulting
from transitions from third orbits or higher will have even larger energy than 10.2 eV. So,
they are all invisible.
Next consider transitions to n = 2 orbit. Example D.21.1 calculated the wavelength for
3 →2 transition. Let us calculate the 4 →2 wavelength. Again using Figure 21.3, we get
the energy of the photon: Eγ = −0.85−(−3.4) = 2.55 eV or 4.08×10−19 J. The wavelength
of this photon is easily found to be 4.87 × 10−7 m or 487 nm (nanometer) corresponding
to blue. Similar calculations show that the 5 →2 transition yields a wavelength of 435 nm
corresponding to indigo, and that the 6 →2 transition yields a wavelength of 411 nm

E3 = −1.51 eV, which is already below the minimum energy of 1.77 eV for a visible photon.
What do you know? 21.3. What is the wavelength of the photon emitted when a
hydrogen atom makes a transition from the fourth to the third level? Is it possible to
have a photon of visible wavelength in a transition to the third level?
How do we observe these photons? Long before Bohr proposed his model of the atom, it
had been known that light is emitted by gases and vapors when an electric spark is passed
through them, or in some cases, when a continuous electric current is established through a
thin tube ﬁlled with the gas. The light so emitted, when passed through a system of prisms
(called a spectroscope), was found to have a completely diﬀerent spectrum than sunlight.
Whereas the latter’s was a continuous spectrum consisting of all wavelengths between red
and violet, the former’s spectrum consisted of only thin lines of colored light. These lines

came to be known as the emission spectral lines. It was further discovered that each
element had its own unique set of spectral lines, a sort of ﬁngerprint for the element.
Food for Thought
FFT 21.3.2. Theories in physics are discovered in two diﬀerent ways. Some theories are more
or less a direct outgrowth of observation.
Kepler’s discovery of the elliptical orbit of Mars is
one example of this process. Another example is the pre-Maxwellian electromagnetism. A third
example is Planck’s discovery of the formula describing the black body radiation curve.
In all
these cases, a rule or a mathematical formula is discovered, which summarizes the result of many
observations. This process of theory making is called induction or phenomenology. Most of
classical physics theories are inductive.
The other way of theory making uses a great deal of mental creativity. A prime example of
Modern physics is
almost entirely
deductive.
this way of theory making, called deduction, is Maxwell’s discovery of the electromagnetic waves.
Modern physics is almost entirely deductive. Planck’s fundamental quantum hypothesis and his
relation connecting the frequency of the quantum of EM radiation to its energy is a good example
of deduction. The relation E = hf is not a direct (or even indirect) result of observation. It is a
formula created solely by Planck’s mind after months of thinking about ways to explain the black
body radiation formula.
Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric eﬀect and his introduction
of the photon idea in that explanation is another example. A third example, on which we have
dwelt in this chapter is Bohr’s idea of the hydrogen atom.
The assumption that the angular

momentum of an electron is an integer multiple of the Planck constant (see Math Note E.21.2) has
no observational basis whatsoever; it was completely created by Bohr’s mind. In the remaining
chapters of this part, we shall see many more examples of deductive reasoning.
The deductive process has been so pervasive in modern physics that some theorists have ex-

pressed the belief that perhaps the human mind in and of itself can produce theories; that obser-
vation has a secondary, even an inessential role in theory making. That this belief is ill-founded
can be demonstrated by the vast experimental work that went into the pre-Maxwellian electromag-
netism, without which Maxwell could not have obtained his mathematical equations that led to
the prediction of EM waves; by the intense observational activity of many experimental physicists,
on which Planck relied heavily before writing down his black body radiation formula; and by many
experiments on the photoelectric eﬀect on which Einstein based his idea of a photon.
Perhaps the most convincing example of the crucial role that observation plays in a deductive
theory is the Bohr model. Although Bohr’s hypothesis was entirely a creation of his mind, it was a
hypothesis that applied to the Rutherford atom. This atom had a heavy positively charged nucleus

around which negative electrons revolved. And this picture of the atom was—quite surprisingly—
discovered through, and only through, experimental observation. So, although deduction is central
in making modern theories of physics, it cannot take place in a vacuum. Somewhere in the history
of the development of every deductive theory there is a crucial observation, without which the
theory could not exist. This observation may be in the immediate past of the theory as in the
case of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, or in the distant past as in the case of Maxwellian
electromagnetism, which is based on observations going back to Gilbert’s in the late 1500s.
The exaggerated role of deduction advanced even by some physicists has become a base on
which certain schools of social sciences erect their theoretical ediﬁce. They propose “theories” upon
“theories” based entirely on speculation and whim and argue as if those theories were irrefutable.
Thus Latour redeﬁnes certain accepted concepts to give his version of the “theory” of relativity (see
Food for Thought 27.5.3). And Bloor “theorizes” that beliefs change over time and are dependent
on cultures in which they are believed; science also changes over time and has developed in many
diﬀerent cultures; therefore, science depends on culture (see Section 19.4)!
21.3.2
Shortcomings of the Bohr Model
When Bohr invented his model of the atom, there was an extensive collection of spectral
lines data on which it could be tested. The success of the model in predicting the exact
location of the spectral lines of the H-atom was an indication of the validity of the model.
However there was an uneasy feeling among physicists about the model. For example, the
very basic assumption concerning the angular momentum of the electron seemed to be very
artiﬁcial. Why should the angular momentum be an integer multiple of h/2π and not h/3π
or h/2.3, or any other odd combination? More seriously, what is the electron doing when it
is in the ﬁrst orbit? Is it sitting still? If so, then why is it not pulled into the nucleus by the
electric attraction? Is it moving? Then why is it not radiating EM waves—as the laws of
electromagnetism predict—and eventually collapsing into the nucleus due to loss of energy?
When the electron is on a higher orbit, does it always jump to lower orbits? Which one?
These, and many other unanswered and troubling questions, rendered the Bohr model of
the atom unsatisfactory. The race was now on to ﬁnd a new model that had none of these
ﬂaws.

The alpha particles would be able to knock them out of the gold atoms, and one
should be able to detect them outside the gold foil.
21.2. A negative energy indicates a bound system as we discovered in Example 9.2.5. This
means that the electron cannot leave the atom on its own. You have to provide it with
positive energy (such as the KE of a bombarding particle) to separate it from the nucleus.

The fourth level has an energy of −13.6/42 or −0.85 eV. The third level has an
energy of −13.6/32 or −1.51 eV. The diﬀerence is 0.661 eV, which is the energy of the
photon. Convert this energy to Joules, plug in the Planck relation (20.4), and ﬁnd the
wavelength to be 1.88 µm. This is infrared. The absolute maximum energy a photon can
have in a transition to the third level is 1.51 eV. (Can you convince yourself why?) The
wavelength of such a photon is 0..82 µm, which is infrared. Since visible light has shorter
wavelength (and therefore higher energy), no transition to the third level is visible.

Chapter22
Quantum Theory I
Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was a hybrid between the classical Newtonian physics
and the radical idea of the quantization of light. Newtonian physics by itself failed miserably
when encountered with an atom that had a nucleus, and when Bohr mixed it with a dab of
modern physics, it was improved; but only partially. It appeared that Newtonian physics
needed a dramatic metamorphosis.
22.1
Electrons as Waves
Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), with a degree in history, had no intention of becoming a
physicist, but when his older brother introduced him to the subject, he was so fascinated by
it that he decided to make physics his profession. His interest in the fundamental principles
led him to include in his doctoral dissertation of 1924 an idea that baﬄed his advisors and
the physics community in general.
De Broglie argued that up until 1905, when Einstein—in his explanation of photoelectric
eﬀect—hinted at the existence of light particles, everybody thought that light was only a
wave. Now everybody thinks that electrons are only particles. Is that really the case? What
if we assume that they are also waves? Once he made this sweeping assumption, he sought
to connect the wave and particle properties of the electron.
The most particle-like property of an object is its momentum, and it is the momentum
that enters Newton’s second law of motion, a law that describes the behavior of particles. So,
for de Broglie, the question boiled down to this: Is there a relation between the wavelength
(the deﬁnitive property of a wave) and momentum?
He found the answer in photons.
Planck and Einstein had shown that the energy of a photon was related to its wavelength
via E = hc/λ. Einstein’s theory of relativity connected the energy and momentum of the
photon via p = E/c [see Section 28.3.3, especially Equation (28.8)]. Therefore, concluded
de Broglie, the momentum of a photon is related to its wavelength via p = h/λ. This,
he argued, must be true for electrons as well, and came up with the following Nobel-prize
winning relation:
de Broglie relation.
p = h
λ,
or
λ = h
p ,
where
p = mv.
(22.1)
This is now called the de Broglie relation.
Example 22.1.1. Let us calculate the wavelength of a typical electron.
The momentum of
such an electron can be found from Math Note E.21.1, which gives the speed of the electron as
1.59 × 106 m/s.
Multiplying the mass, 9.1 × 10−31 kg, of the electron and this speed, we get
p = 1.45 × 10−24 kg·m/s. The wavelength of the electron is therefore λ = 6.626 × 10−34/1.45 ×
10−24 = 4.57 × 10−10 m, which is a typical size for atoms.

Quantum Theory I
The example above shows that if the electrons have wave properties as de Broglie sug-
gested, then their typical wavelength is of the order of the atomic size. So, if we can ﬁnd an
aperture the size of an atom, we should be able to observe the diﬀraction of the electrons
(see Box 11.3.1). This indeed took place in 1926 when two American physicists, Clinton
Davisson (1881–1958) and Lester Germer (1896–1971), used the spacing between metallic
atoms as their aperture to observe the electron diﬀraction. About a year later, across the
Atlantic Ocean, the British physicist, George Thomson (1892–1975) using a diﬀerent tech-
nique, proved the wave nature of the same particle which his father had discovered 31 years
earlier.
Food for Thought
FFT 22.1.2. Science is an interconnected web of ideas, laws, theories, and experimental re-
sults. This interconnectedness solidiﬁes science at the same time that it characterizes it. No other
discipline enjoys such a strong connection among its parts. Political, social, economic, and histor-
ical theories are so loosely connected that two opposing theories (points of view, philosophies, or
schools) could coexist.
The interconnectedness of science is especially pronounced in physics. It is very common to see
ideas developed in one area of physics being used in other areas. Maxwell borrowed the mathematics
of the motion of ﬂuids in his description of the electromagnetic ﬁelds. The motion of a ﬂuid is
expressed in terms of velocity ﬁelds, whose variation is caused by “stress and strains” applied to
the ﬂuid. Even today people talk of “stress energy tensor” of electromagnetism, reminiscent of the
ﬂuid terminology borrowed by Maxwell over 150 years ago.
De Broglie’s brilliant idea of applying to the electron the relation that exists between the
wavelength and momentum of a photon is another signiﬁcant example of the interconnectedness
among areas of physics. In order to come up with the idea, de Broglie had to know relativity. In
order for Maxwell to come up with his electromagnetic theory, he had to know the mechanics of
ﬂuids. Creative physicists must be well rounded, in command of the accumulated knowledge of
their ﬁeld, and in possession of a fertile imagination.
Each new connection is a new tie in the web that makes science ever more impermeable. It
is impossible for a nonsensical theory or idea to penetrate this web. The internet, bookstores,
and many libraries are ﬁlled with “uniﬁed theories” claiming to solve all the existing problems of
physics. However, because of the detachment of these theories—often proposed by people with
little or no background in physics—from the web of physics, they invariably make no sense, and
fall ﬂat on their face.
Other disciplines do not have such a tight web. One can even argue that they have no web at

all. And if they do, the web’s knots are so loose and the cracks so wide open that any “theory”
can get through: Politicians can have any political ideology (or theory); philosophers of science
can say anything they want about the nature and the working principles of science; educators can
“educate” students based on constructivism, multiple intelligence theory, student-centered method-
ology, traditional approach, etc., many of which theories contradict each other; and sociologists can
“voice” their opposing theories about society. In the “marketplace of ideas,” a wrong theory can
be right and a right theory wrong. Science does not have a “market place” for ideas.
Later, when other sub-atomic particles were discovered, they too were shown to have
wave properties. It was soon realized that Equation (22.1) described a much more universal
property than was originally intended by it. Now we speak of the wave-particle duality of
all objects. All objects? Are bullets, for example, waves as well? Can we see the diﬀraction

of bullets? See what the following example tells you.
Example 22.1.3. A bullet has a mass of about 10 grams (0.01 kg) and moves with a speed of
40 m/s.
Q: What is the de Broglie wavelength of such a bullet?
A: First ﬁnd the momentum of the bullet: p = 0.01×40 = 0.4 kg·m/s. Now ﬁnd the wavelength
λ = 6.626×10−34/0.4 = 1.66×10−33 m, and conclude that to see the diﬀraction of a bullet, we need
to pass them through an “aperture” whose diameter is not too much bigger than 1.66 × 10−33 m

Section 22.2

313
(see Section 11.3, especially Box 11.3.1). As a comparison, note that the size of the nucleus of an
atom is about 10−15 m!
Clearly observing the diﬀraction of bullets is out of the question. What about considerably
smaller objects, say a bacterium. The mass of a typical bacterium is 10−15 kg. If we want to see
its diﬀraction, we should give it a very small speed, so that its wavelength would be large enough
to be comparable with a reasonable-sized aperture. Let the speed be about 1 m/s. Its momentum
is then 10−15 × 1 = 10−15 kg·m/s. This gives a wavelength of 6.626 × 10−19 m. The diameter
of a bacterium is about a micron or 10−6 m. Therefore, the required aperture through which the
bacterium is to pass, must be 10 trillion times smaller than the bacterium itself!

What do you know? 22.1. A very small virus such as rhinovirus is approximately
30 nm in diameter. Its mass is about 10−23 kg, and it moves with a speed of about
1 cm/s. Can you see the diﬀraction of such viruses?
Aside from the experimental conﬁrmation of the de Broglie hypothesis, there was another
validation of the idea, which came from the Bohr model of the atom. It turns out that de
Broglie’s theory can explain the artiﬁcial assumption that was the starting point of Bohr’s
theory. The interested reader can ﬁnd the details in Math Note E.22.1 on page 111 of
Appendix.pdf .
22.2
Quantum Mechanics
The success of de Broglie’s hypothesis drew the attention of the entire physics community
to the theory of waves. Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) was somewhat of an outsider, as
he lived in Austria, which, despite its proximity to the center of physics and mathematics,
namely Germany, was rather isolated. Nevertheless, neither this isolation nor his engage-
ment in active military duty prevented Schr¨odinger from contributing to physics. He was
especially fascinated by de Broglie’s revolutionary idea of the wave nature of the electron,
and very quickly familiarized himself with it. On November 23, 1925, Schr¨odinger gave a
seminar on de Broglie’s work and a member of the audience suggested that there should
be a wave equation. Within a few weeks Schr¨odinger had found the wave equation for the
electron, which he published in January 1926.
22.2.1
An Equation for Everything
Schr¨odinger equation is depicted in Figure 22.1. A few features of this equation are
worth mentioning. The most conspicuous feature is the appearance of the Planck constant
ℏ= h/2π, conﬁrming, along with Bohr and de Broglie, the importance of this constant in
atomic physics. The second feature, just as important as the ﬁrst, is the appearance of
the imaginary number i = √−1. For the ﬁrst time in the history of physics, imaginary
numbers have entered an equation describing the behavior of a physical entity. The symbol
V stands for the potential energy of the system, which in turn is determined by the forces
of interaction. Finally, the symbol Ψ stands for the wave function, whose interpretation
divided the physics community for a long time.
When applied to the hydrogen atom (one of the few systems which can be solved ana-
lytically), the Schr¨odinger equation gave exactly the same formula for its energy levels as
the Bohr model. So, there seemed to be grounds for the credibility of this equation. In
fact, the Schr¨odinger equation went far beyond explaining the hydrogen atom. One can
say that any system of particles that move with speeds much smaller than light speed and
interact via electromagnetic forces, is described correctly by the Schr¨odinger equation. This
includes molecules (thus, the entire discipline of chemistry), solids, liquids, gases, plasmas,

and even life itself (molecular genetics). The Schr¨odinger equation appears to be indeed an
“equation for everything.”
BIOGRAPHY
Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) received lessons at home from a private tutor up to the age of ten.
He then entered the Akademisches Gymnasium in the autumn of 1898.
After graduation from the
Gymnasium in 1906, Schr¨odinger entered the University of Vienna, and four years later, he was awarded
a doctorate degree in physics. Soon he undertook voluntary military service in the fortress artillery. In
1914, with the outbreak of World War I, Schr¨odinger took up duty on the Italian border. A year later,
he was transferred to duty in Hungary, where he submitted several research papers for publication. From
1917 onward he became interested in the quantum theory and in 1924 he read de Broglie’s paper, the
paper that changed the direction of his research, leading to the equation that rerouted physics in 1926.

Matrix Mechanics
In the spring of 1925, almost half a year prior to Schr¨odinger’s formulation of what came

to be known as wave mechanics, a young German physicist by the name of Werner
Heisenberg, recovering from a bout of hay fever on the island of Helgoland in the North
Sea, invented matrix mechanics which also explained the spectral lines of the hydrogen
atom.
Matrices were highly abstract objects (consisting of rows and columns of numbers)
introduced into the mathematical literature at the end of the eighteenth century.
It is
possible to deﬁne addition, multiplication, and division of matrices in a restrictive sense.
The physicists of the early twentieth century were inconveniently unfamiliar with matrices.
And when Heisenberg came across a set of numbers associated with the spectral lines of the
hydrogen atom, it was a more mathematically inclined colleague who pointed out the true
nature of those numbers. Soon, Heisenberg along with the rest of the physics community
mastered the theory of matrices and solved some hitherto insurmountable problems.
The essence of matrix mechanics is that physical observables are represented not by
ordinary numbers (or functions), but by matrices. The rows and columns of numbers in a
matrix of an observable form the collection of the possible values the observable can assume
in a measurement. One of the crucial properties of matrices is that, unlike ordinary numbers
and functions, generally speaking, the operation of multiplication is not commutative: If
A and B are matrices, then in general, AB ̸= BA. Two observables whose matrices do
commute are called compatible; and if their matrices do not commute, they are incompatible.

Section 22.2

Heisenberg discovered that if two physical observables are incompatible (their matrices do
not commute), they cannot be measured with arbitrary certainty at the same time. There is
no restriction on the accuracy with which any number of mutually compatible observables
can be measured.

Equation (22.2) is the celebrated Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Let us pause and
examine this relation more carefully.
BIOGRAPHY
Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) at the age of nine moved to Munich, where his father started to
work as a professor of Greek. In 1914 World War I broke out and the Gymnasium in which Heisenberg
was enrolled was occupied by troops. Students were left on their own, and he took the opportunity
to concentrate on his favorite subjects: mathematics, physics, and religion. Upon graduation from the
Gymnasium, he and his fellow student Wolfgang Pauli, began to study theoretical physics under Arnold
Sommerfeld in October 1920. After gaining conﬁdence, he switched from mathematics to theoretical
physics. Heisenberg also began to plan to undertake research in relativity. However Pauli advised him
against it, encouraging him to take up the atomic structure since theory and experiment did not agree.
Any measurement has an uncertainty—a margin of error. For example, if I ask you how
tall you are, you may say 5 feet 11 inches. If I encourage you to be more accurate, you may
come back with the answer 5 feet 10 1
2 inches after having gone to a drugstore and used a
very accurate scale. If I persist in my demand for more accuracy, you may appease me by
quoting a yet more accurate measurement: 5 feet 10 5
8 inches. Beyond this, you will probably
not be able to give more accurate result. You will not be able to answer the question “Is
your height 5 feet 10 9
16 or 5 feet 10 11
16? All you can say is that it is somewhere between
the two. Your height measurement is uncertain to within
2
16 of an inch, or the uncertainty
in your height is
2
16 inch. This uncertainty is, of course, the result of the crudeness of our
measuring instruments and/or the bulkiness of what is to be measured. If the bulkiness of
the object of measurement is reduced (What is the thickness of a 750-page book?), then
the uncertainty in length can be reduced by using more accurate instruments.
The signiﬁcance of Equation (22.2) is that it is independent of the measuring device. It
says that regardless of the instrument and the level of our technology, the product of the
uncertainty in position and momentum in a simultaneous measurement cannot be less that
ℏ. In other words, it is impossible to build an apparatus that measures both the position
and momentum of an object more accurately than is allowed by the uncertainty relation
(22.2).
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle also applies to energy and time. If one tries to measure
the energy E of a particle during a time interval t in which the particle has energy E, then
it is impossible to determine both E and t more accurately than the following uncertainty
relation:
(∆E) · (∆t) ≥ℏ.

It is important to note that Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle applies to the simulta-
neous measurement of incompatible observables. There is no limit set by the uncertainty
principle on the accuracy of an isolated position measurement of a particle (or a simultane-
ous measurement of its position along with other observables compatible with position), as
long as one does not try to determine its momentum at the same time. Similarly, one can
determine the momentum of a particle as accurately as one pleases, as long as the position
of the particle is not measured. The same statement applies to the time-energy pair.
What do you know? 22.2. A precision-tools company claims that it has invented a
device that can measure the energy of an atom with an uncertainty of only 0.01 eV in
a time interval of 10−14 second. Is the company’s claim valid?
The appearance of the Planck constant in the uncertainty relations demands very small
uncertainties in the measured quantities for the principle to be violated. This tells us that
only in the subatomic world of the electrons and nuclei does the uncertainty principle put
restrictions on measurements. The world of ordinary objects need not worry about violat-
ing the principle, because even for unrealistically accurate measurements of positions and
momenta of ordinary objects, the uncertainty principle holds automatically. The following
example helps clarify this point.
Example 22.2.2. Suppose that we can determine the position (of the center of) a tennis ball
to within a hundredth of a millimeter (0.001 cm or 0.00001 m). This means that we can say with
certainty that the ball is, for instance, 3.00001 m away from the center of the thickness of the
net, and not 3.000015 m. This is a very (in fact, unusually) accurate measurement with a very
small uncertainty of ∆x = 0.00002 m.1 Similarly, suppose that we can determine the speed of the
tennis ball to within 0.001 cm/s (0.00001 m/s), meaning that we can say for certain that the ball is
moving with a speed of, say 50.00001 m/s and not 50.000015 m/s. This leads to an uncertainty of
∆v = 0.00002 m/s. If the mass of the ball is 200 grams (0.2 kg), then the uncertainty ∆p = m∆v
in momentum will be 0.000004 kg·m/s. Therefore, the product of the uncertainty in position and
momentum is 0.00002 × 0.000004 = 8 × 10−11, which is safely larger than ℏ.
■
We now have two theories—wave mechanics, also called the Schr¨odinger picture and
Schr¨odinger and
Heisenberg pictures.
matrix mechanics, also called the Heisenberg picture—that successfully describe the
hydrogen atom. Both are highly mathematical, but use completely diﬀerent mathematics
in their treatment of the H-atom. It turns out that, just as a rose could be “described”
by diﬀerent words in diﬀerent languages, wave mechanics and matrix mechanics describe
the hydrogen atom in two diﬀerent “languages.” And just as one can go from one ordinary
language to another by means of translation, one can also go from wave mechanics to matrix
mechanics (and vice versa) by means of a process known as transformation theory, invented
by one of the most brilliant mathematical physicists of all time, Paul Adrian Maurice Dirac,
of whom we shall say more later.
What do you know?
22.3. What happens when ∆p or ∆E of the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle goes to zero?

The Meaning of Ψ
The Schr¨odinger equation contains the symbol Ψ, the “wave function,” which is a function
of the position r of the electron and time t, thus written as Ψ(r, t). The solution of the

underestimate it. Thus, we can only say that the position of the ball is greater than 2.99999 m and less
than 3.00001 m. The diﬀerence between these two values is the uncertainty.

The Meaning of Ψ

Schr¨odinger equation, for say the H-atom, yields not only the energy levels, but also a
mathematical expression for Ψ(r, t). But what is Ψ? Schr¨odinger was the ﬁrst to answer
that question: Just as we have EM waves, sound waves, water waves, and waves on a rope
or a membrane, so do we have “electron waves.” However, there are at least three problems
associated with this: (a) What exactly is waving? (b) If the electron is a wave, why do
we always detect it as localized individual particles, contrary to our experience of waves
being spread out? (c) Unlike all the other waves mentioned above, which are described by
real-valued functions, Ψ is a complex-valued function due to the presence of i = √−1 in the
Schr¨odinger equation. How can a real physical entity such as an electron be described by a
complex-valued function?
22.3.1
Ψ and Probability
The revolutionary answer to these questions came from Max Born (1882–1970)—the Ger-

foundation of physics.
man mathematical physicist and Heisenberg’s mentor—in June 1926, six months after the
Schr¨odinger equation was discovered. He stated quite radically that
Box 22.3.1. Ψ(r, t) is a quantity whose absolute value squared times a small volume
centered at r gives the probability of ﬁnding the particle in that volume at time t. If we
denote this probability by P(r, t) and the small volume by δV , thenP(r, t) = |Ψ(r, t)|2 δV .
Ψ(r, t) itself is called the probability amplitude.
The content of Box 22.3.1 is sometimes called the Copenhagen interpretation, be-
cause in the late 1920s, many young physicists gathered around Niels Bohr in Copenhagen to
investigate the mysteries of the newly emerging quantum theory. At that time no one knew
how to “interpret” the wave function Ψ coming out of the Schr¨odinger equation. However,
after almost a century of harsh tests and experimental scrutiny, the word “interpretation”
is no longer appropriate, because it invites the philosophization of physics, which in turn,
gives the impression that there may be other (perhaps more mystical) interpretations of the
quantum theory. Box 22.3.1 says how nature behaves in exact mathematical terms. It does
not behave any other way, and there are no other “interpretations!”
Born’s claim was more than most physicists could bear. The idea that physics, the
most exact science, cannot predict the behavior of objects obeying its laws seemed to be
undermining its very foundations. The science that could predict the location of planets to
within fraction of a degree, that could foretell the existence of other unknown and unseen
worlds in the solar system with miraculous determinacy, how could that science allow even
the slightest hint of indeterminacy into its sacred shrine?
Food for Thought
FFT 22.3.2. Mathematics has always been inseparable from nature. Starting with the observa-
tion of the sky and the tilling of the land, humans have been forced to use mathematics whenever
they have dealt with nature. The “experiments” of the Egyptians and Babylonians with geometry
and arithmetic took the form of a most sophisticated discipline in the hands of the Greeks. By
Plato’s time, the need for mathematics in the study of nature was so compelling that he said, “In-
nocent light-minded men, who think that astronomy can be learnt by looking at the stars without
knowledge of mathematics will, in the next life, be birds.” And Archimedes naturally mingled
the geometry of solids with hydrostatics to the point that he could not separate them, and his
discoveries in one ﬁeld led to the advancement of both.
After the Renaissance, Galileo, in his study of motion, had to invent a rudimentary form of
Inseparability of

calculus. And when Newton looked deep into the secret of motion, nature, in her most forceful
way, compelled him to perfect calculus and beautifully apply it to the laws of motion and gravity.

318
Chapter 22
Quantum Theory I
Later, the more physicists applied the mathematical laws of nature to new situations, the more
new ﬁelds of mathematics opened up. Almost all the great mathematicians of the eighteenth and
the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth centuries were also great physicists.
There were some mathematicians, however, who concentrated on the inner abstract structure
of the mathematics that was earlier created by physics. These abstract studies led to such pure and
strictly mathematical ideas that many thought that the human race had ﬁnally created a form of
mathematics that was completely separate from nature; that those branches of mathematics were
so much the product of the human mind that nature would have nothing to do with them. These
areas included imaginary numbers, inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, non-Euclidean geometry, and group
theory.
For a while, it seemed that the conjecture of the abstract mathematicians was correct. Physics
seemed to have nothing to do with imaginary numbers, inﬁnite-dimensional spaces, non-Euclidean
geometry, and group theory. However, the twentieth-century physics changed all that. Einstein
was forced to use the language of non-Euclidean geometry in his relativity theory; Schr¨odinger
was forced to introduce imaginary numbers into his equation; Dirac showed that the only way to
understand the new quantum theory was to incorporate the inﬁnite-dimensional spaces into it.
And group theory, which grew out of the attempts to solve algebraic equations (a truly and purely
mathematical study), found its indispensable application in the study of the most fundamental
constituents of matter.
The heart of matter speaks in mathematics, and only in mathematics. Just as the beauty of a
poetry is best revealed in its original language, so does physics show its beauty and elegance in its
language, mathematics. This, of course, does not mean that we have to be deprived of this beauty
just because we are not well versed in mathematics. After all, Shakespeare can (and should) be
appreciated by all humankind, not just English-speaking people. G¨othe does not belong only to
Germans, and Omar Khayyam only to Farsi-speaking people. Translations can convey—albeit to
a limited extent—the essence of the beauty of the poetry from one language to another.
However, while the translation from one human language to another can be as truthful as the

talent and the ability of the translator (compare the Edward FitzGerald translation of the Rubaiyat
of Omar Khayyam to other translations), a truthful translation from the nature’s language to any
human language is impossible. This is especially true of the mathematics of quantum theory, as
it is highly abstract and formal. Nevertheless, it is an implied duty of physicists to make every
eﬀort to translate their language into human languages, so that nonprofessionals can appreciate
the relevance of physics for two reasons: to support further development of physics (as the progress
of physics requires public support), and to encourage the youth to become professional physicists.
However, it is essential for both the physicists and the larger citizenry to keep the following wise
remarks of Dirac in mind: “The amount of theoretical [mathematical] ground one has to cover
before being able to solve problems of real practical value is rather large, but this circumstance is
an inevitable consequence of the fundamental part played by transformation theory and is likely
to become more pronounced in the theoretical physics of the future.”
Schr¨odinger’s reaction was immediate and sharp. He remarked that had he known that
his equation was to be interpreted as probabilistic, he would not have published it. Planck

was on Schr¨odinger’s side; and when Schr¨odinger took his place on his retirement in 1931,
Planck praised him for bringing determinacy back into physics. These remarks by such
well-known physicists were very unpleasant to Max Born, who was anxious to see how his
idea would hold in the face of experiments and observations. But unpleasantness turned to
disappointment when Einstein wrote to Born, “Quantum mechanics is certainly imposing.
But an inner voice tells me it is not yet the real thing.” Despite all these opposing remarks,
Born prevailed.
The notion of probability and statistics had already been applied to physics in the con-

text of statistical mechanics, and both Planck and Einstein were masters of that application.
But they were not concerned about the use of probability in statistical mechanics, because
that usage was not at a fundamental level. The particles in a gas obeyed the deterministic
laws of motion—and in principle one could keep track of the precise motion of each indi-
vidual particle—but for a large number of molecules, it was more convenient and practical
to use statistical methods. Max Born’s probability, on the other hand, was used at a very

best one could do was to determine the probability of ﬁnding an electron at a given location
at a given time.
The inﬁnitesimal size of the electron and other subatomic particles renders Max Born’s

idea applicably feasible. Even though the Schr¨odinger equation cannot predict the exact
behavior of an individual subatomic particle, it predicts the behavior of any macroscopic
collection of such particles with unprecedented accuracy. After all, even the smallest macro-
scopic volume such as the tip of a sharp needle contains over a million trillion atoms, and
the law of large numbers (Section 16.3) makes the probabilistic prediction of the quantum
theory all but deterministic.
Figure 22.2 shows the probability amplitude and probability of an electron conﬁned in
a region along the x-axis (a one-dimensional box) of size 3 nm. The amplitude, as shown in
Figure 22.2(a), can be positive or negative (in fact, in general, it can be a complex number
involving √−1). The probability distribution (or probability density), given by |Ψ|2, is

and area as probability.
always positive. To ﬁnd the probability of ﬁnding the electron between two values of x, say
x1 and x2, one calculates the fractional area under the graph of |Ψ|2 bounded by those
values. Fractional area is the area as a fraction of the total area under the entire probability
curve. If x2 is only slightly larger than x1, so that δx = x2 −x1 is very small, this area can
be approximated by |Ψ|2δx as stated in Box 22.3.1 (here the inﬁnitesimal “volume” is just
δx). For example, the probability of ﬁnding the electron in a small interval of width δx at
x = 0.5 nm is |Ψ(0.5)|2δx, where Ψ(0.5) is the value of the wave function at x = 0.5 nm.
This probability is shown as the narrow strip in Figure 22.2(b). If x1 and x2 are noticeably
diﬀerent, then one has to calculate the area either accurately by using integral calculus,
or approximately by dividing the area between x1 and x2 into narrow strips of width δx
and adding the areas of these strips, each one being |Ψ|2δx. One can also estimate the
probability by just examining the graph, as the following example shows.
Example 22.3.3. In Figure 22.2(b), we approximate each bump of the graph as a triangle. The
base of each triangle is 1 nm. But what number do we assign to the height? It turns out that since
we are interested in the fractional area, it doesn’t matter, as long as we measure other heights in
the graph relative to that number. So let us take the height to be 1. (Try another number and see
that the ﬁnal answer will not change.) Then the area of each triangle is 1
2 × 1 × 1 = 0.5. To get
the area of the shaded region, subtract from this area the area of the right triangle in the middle
hump on the left of the shaded area. This has a base of approximately 0.25 nm and an estimated
height of 0.5. So its area is 1
2 × 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.0625. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is
0.5 −0.0625 = 0.4375. The probability of ﬁnding the electron between 1.25 nm and 2 nm is the
ratio of this number to the total area (which is 3 times the area of each hump or 3 × 0.5 = 1.5).
So, the probability of ﬁnding the electron between 1.25 nm and 2 nm is 0.4375/1.5 or 0.2917. This
calculation indicates that the electron spends about 29% of its time between 1.25 nm and 2 nm. ■

Ψ for Hydrogen Atom
Let us now apply the Schr¨odinger-Born theory to the hydrogen atom. Recall that one result
of this application was the quantization of the energy of the electron identical to the Bohr
formula (see Box 21.3.1). What about the wave function Ψ? It turns out that the wave
function—and therefore the probability—depends on the energy of the electron, which in
turn depends on the integer n, called the principal quantum number in the context of
the Schr¨odinger-Born theory. If n = 1, so that the energy is −13.6 eV, the probability

distribution looks like the plot in Figure 22.3. The horizontal axis is the distance r from
the nucleus in units of the Bohr radius a0, equal to 5.3×10−11 m. It is clear from the graph
that the maximum probability occurs when r = a0. Hence, the electron is mostly found at
a distance corresponding to Bohr’s ﬁrst orbit. But it can also be found at other distances
as well, albeit with less probability.
What do you know? 22.5. Assuming that a hydrogen atom is in n = 1 state most
of the time, what is the radius of the hydrogen atom? Hint: Look at Figure 22.3.
The Schr¨odinger-Born theory corrects the ﬂaws of the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom.
Schr¨odinger-Born theory
does not have the ﬂaws
of the Bohr theory.
It does not conﬁne the electron to an orbit. Therefore, it does not lead to the diﬃculty
of the emission of EM radiation due to its acceleration. As the ﬁgure shows, the theory
actually allows the electron to be at all distances from the nucleus. However, it prohibits
the electron from getting too close to the nucleus (and therefore collapsing into it) or too
far away from the nucleus (and, therefore, escaping it altogether).
It turns out that for any value of the principal quantum number n, the probability
function of the electron at the nucleus is zero, and drops to zero for very large values of
r. However, the peak of the probability is no longer at r = a0, but farther away from the
nucleus. This is as expected, because, at least from the point of view of the Bohr model,
the larger the n is, the farther the electron is expected to be from the nucleus.

The electron is not to be pictured as lying on orbits at ﬁxed distances from the nucleus,
but as “hovering” around certain orbits most of the time, with the possibility of being found
very close and very far away from the nucleus. In fact, quantum theory deﬁes any sort of
mental picture for the behavior of the subatomic particles. However, if we were forced to
imagine an electron in a hydrogen atom, we would have to replace the Bohr orbits with
“fuzzy” orbits (sometimes called electron clouds) of the sort shown in Figure 22.4, where
the stronger the shade of black the higher the probability of ﬁnding the electron there.

this theory, the electron can never be found at the nucleus, and therefore, the H-atom

of this theory is stable. Furthermore, the quantum theory allows calculations which were
completely out of reach in the Bohr model. For instance, it allows determining the proba-
bility that an electron makes a transition from a higher level to a lower level. It can even
determine the “lifetime” of any level with a given principal quantum number. And while
the Bohr model could not handle multi-electron atoms, the Schr¨odinger-Born theory is very
well-suited for generalization to more complicated atoms, and even molecules. Although
the analytical solutions of such generalizations are extremely complicated, powerful com-
puters have been used very successfully in predicting the structure of complex atoms and
molecules.

Answers to “What do you know?”
22.1.
Use de Broglie’s relation to ﬁnd the wavelength of the virus. First we need the
momentum of the virus: p = mv = 10−23 × 0.01.
So, the momentum of the virus is
10−25 kg·m/s. Its wavelength is h/p or 6.626 × 10−9 m, or 6.626 nm. In order for the virus
to pass through the hole, the hole must be at least 30 nm, which is less than 5 times the
wavelength. So, if the hole is slightly more than 30 nm, the virus can get through it, and
the hole is not too much bigger than the wavelength. So, diﬀraction can take place.
22.2.
The uncertainty in energy is 0.01 eV, or 1.6 × 10−21 J. The uncertainty in time is
10−14 s. The product of these two is 1.6 × 10−35 J·s. This is smaller than ℏ, and therefore,
violates the uncertainty principle. The company is lying!
22.3. As one factor in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle goes to zero, the other factor
must go to inﬁnity. Thus, precise knowledge of one precludes any knowledge of the other
(an inﬁnite uncertainty is equivalent to no knowledge at all).
22.4. As Figure 22.2 shows, it is highly unlikely to ﬁnd the electron between 1.99 nm and
2.01 nm, because the probability vanishes at 2 nm.

There is no such thing as the radius of an atom, because radius has a connotation
of an exact distance, and we know that the electron’s distance from the nucleus is only
a probabilistic quantity. Nevertheless, we can ask where the electron is most likely to be
found, and call that the “radius” of the atom. The most probable distance from the origin
(nucleus) is a0.
That means that the electron is hovering around a0 from the nucleus.
Therefore, it is natural to call a0 the radius of the H-atom.

Quantum Theory II
The highly mathematical nature of the quantum theory, combined with the probability
inherent in it, makes it one of the “weirdest” theories ever discovered by humankind. This
weirdness comes partly because of our attempt at “translating” the consequences of the
quantum theory into our own language. Such a “philosophization” of the quantum theory,
a theory which works smoothly and perfectly in the language of mathematics, has led to
its diﬀerent “interpretations.” In this chapter, we summarize some consequences of the
quantum theory.
23.1
Quantum Tunneling
When we store candies in a jar, we are assured that when we reach out in our cabinet and
take the jar out, the candies will be there, even after a long time. In the absence of a
mischievous child (or a weak-willed adult), it would be impossible to ﬁnd a candy outside
the jar. Nevertheless, in the strange world of the quanta, this is precisely what happens!
Suppose that we, as well as everything around us, shrink to subatomic sizes. Then, the
behavior of everyday objects in our world is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics.
Now, let us concentrate on the motion of a single (quantum) candy in a (quantum) jar
[Figure 23.1(a)]. The candy obeys the Schr¨odinger equation, and the jar is described by a
mathematical formula representing the potential energy of the candy. When the Schr¨odinger
equation is solved for this jar-candy system, two basic results follow: (a) there is a principal
quantum number quantizing the energy of the system as in the hydrogen atom, and (b)
each quantized energy has a wave function Ψ.
Figure 23.1(b) shows the probability distribution |Ψ|2 for the lowest energy level (or
lowest principal quantum number). The two vertical lines show the boundaries of the jar.
The shaded region gives the probability of ﬁnding the candy in the jar.
Note that the
shaded area does not cover the entire area under the probability curve. A small fraction of
the curve lies outside the boundary of the jar, indicating a nonzero probability for ﬁnding the
candy outside! This phenomenon is called quantum tunneling, which is, unfortunately,
Quantum tunneling.
a misnomer, because no tunnel connects the inside of the jar to the outside.
If you put a quantum candy in a quantum jar, set it on a table and do not disturb it,
chances are that you will eventually see the candy outside. And this is not because the
candy is small and the jar may have a hole—a “tunnel”—in it! You can make the jar as
solid as you wish.

Box 23.1.1. The probability of ﬁnding the candy outside the jar is nonzero.
This
probability depends on how tall the jar is; it decreases as the height of the jar increases.
For an inﬁnitely tall jar, the probability is zero.
To understand this weird behavior better, let us go back to our real world of classical
physics. The height of the jar can be represented mathematically by a potential-energy

function with a nonzero value, say 1 J (one Joule), in the thickness of the jar wall. If the
total energy E of the candy is less than 1 J, say E = 0.5 J, then the candy cannot penetrate
the wall of the jar, because as soon as it arrives in the thickness of the wall, the potential
energy becomes larger than the total energy, indicating that the kinetic energy is negative,
which can never happen! Therefore, a candy whose total energy is less that the potential
energy of the height of the jar is permanently conﬁned inside the jar. The only way that
the candy can be found outside is to give it enough extra energy so that its total energy
becomes larger than the potential energy of the wall. This means, in eﬀect, lifting it from
the bottom of the jar and putting it outside.
How does the quantum candy end up outside without any lifting? There is really no

answer in the “human language” to this question. The nonhuman (mathematical) answer
is “The solution to Schr¨odinger equation gives a nonzero probability. Therefore, there is a
chance that the candy is found outside.” A more “convincing” answer may be as follows.
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in time and energy [Equation (22.3)] allows the candy to
have a huge uncertainty in its energy if the time spent in the wall is inﬁnitesimally small.
So, suppose we keep track of the candy and note that one moment it is inside and the
next moment outside. The uncertainty in time is very small, making the uncertainty in
energy big. What is the consequence of this? Well, if we are hugely uncertain about the
energy, then we cannot say whether its conservation has been violated or not. Therefore, it
is possible for the candy to violate the (classical) energy conservation, “create” extra energy
to overcome the potential barrier of the wall, and land outside.
The foregoing “explanation” of the weirdness of the quantum tunneling is really cheating
our way out. We invoked the uncertainty principle to explain the tunneling, and in the
process, we shifted from one form of weirdness to another. Uncertainty principle is just as
weird as the tunneling eﬀect; and there is no way that one can “explain” the uncertainty
principle. It is a mathematical consequence of the mathematical matrix mechanics.

the candy to be seen outside, then we need a sample considerably larger than 1015 jar-candy
systems to be able to see any candies outside. A sample of 1020 systems, for instance, would,
on the average, result in (see Box 16.2.2) 1020 × 10−15 = 105 or 100,000 candies outside, a
large enough number to be easily detectable.
What do you know? 23.1. Suppose that the tunneling probability for a jar-candy
system is a billionth. How many jar-candy systems do you need to see 1000 candies
out?
As weird as quantum tunneling is, nature abounds in it.
• A special form of nuclear radioactivity is a prime example of quantum tunneling.
Some heavy nuclei act as jars that hold quantum candies called the alpha particles.1
From the knowledge of the size of the nucleus and some rudimentary understanding
of nuclear forces, it is possible to construct a jar-like model of the nucleus with a
nuclear potential representing the wall of the jar. One can then solve the Schr¨odinger
equation for such a model and predict the probability of seeing an alpha particle
outside.
With even a small sample of nuclear material having a huge number of
“jars,” the prediction can be easily tested against observation. Such tests have been
performed and the predictions conﬁrmed.
• Nuclear fusion, the process that generates energy for stars to shine and give oﬀ
heat, is another example of quantum tunneling. Two (“heavy”) hydrogen atoms can

fuse together to form a helium atom. This process of fusion releases a tremendous
amount of energy, which we see as the light and heat from a star (our Sun). For fusion
to take place, the nuclei of the two hydrogen atoms must get immeasurably close to
each other. But since the two nuclei are positively charged, they repel each other; and
the closer they get, the stronger this repulsion. The potential barrier corresponding
to this repulsion is so high that, if classical physics were to apply, it would require
an inﬁnite amount of energy to overcome the barrier. Fortunately, due to quantum
tunneling, the particles can “tunnel” through the potential barrier and fuse. Fusion is
the inverse of the alpha emission. In the latter case, the particle tunnels “out,” while
in the former case the two particles tunnel “in.”
• Aside from the two natural examples of quantum tunneling above, there are many
artiﬁcial examples, which have far reaching technological ramiﬁcations:
– Tunnel diodes are semiconductor devices consisting of two oppositely charged
regions separated by a gap (the potential barrier). This potential barrier can be
controlled by the voltage between the two regions. By varying this voltage, one
can vary the number of electrons tunneling through the barrier.
– Quantum dots are artiﬁcial quantum “jars” constructed by quantum technol-
ogists, in which a single (or multiple) electrons can be trapped.
There is a
tremendous amount of eﬀort devoted to the construction and use of these dots
in electronics.
– Josephson junction consists of two superconductors separated by a thin insu-
lating layer. Under certain conditions, it is possible to tunnel a pair of electrons
from one superconductor to the other through the insulating barrier.

using the quantum tunneling eﬀect. It is discussed in some detail in Section
23.6.
What do you know? 23.2. When two positive light nuclei approach inﬁnitesimally
close to each other, the electric repulsion becomes inﬁnitely large. So, the penetration
“wall” is inﬁnitely tall. According to Box 23.1.1, the probability of tunneling is zero.
How can you have fusion then?
23.2
The Double-Slit Experiment
In Chapter 11, we talked about the interference of waves originating from two coherent
sources, which are usually two slits in a solid barrier. From de Broglie and Schr¨odinger we
have learned that electrons have wave properties. Therefore, we should be able to see the
interference of the electrons. However, the electrons are always detected as particles. How
does this dual nature of the electron play itself out in a two slit experiment? To appreciate
the consequences of this wave-particle duality, let us perform three separate double-slit
experiments: with bullets, with waves, and ﬁnally with electrons.
23.2.1
Bullets and Double-Slits
A gun ﬁres towards a distant vertical barrier with two holes, which allow bullets to go to
the other side, being subsequently collected on a second (wooden) barrier (see Figure 23.2).
We perform three diﬀerent experiments with this gun-barrier set up.
In the ﬁrst experiment, we cover the lower hole [see Figure 23.2(a)], and ﬁre a large
number, say 1000, bullets. After all the bullets are ﬁred, we go to the other side and count
the number of bullets collected by the wooden obstacle. Let us say that 50 bullets made it
to the other side. It then follows that the probability—call it P1—for the bullets ﬁred from
that particular gun to pass through the upper hole is 50/1000 or 0.05 or 5%. The 50 bullets
that passed through the upper hole will not all be landing at exactly the same point on
the wooden obstacle. There will be a lot landing at A1 directly opposite the center of the
hole, but there will also be some landing on points close to A1. This indicates that P1 has a
distribution that looks approximately like the curve shown at the bottom of Figure 23.2(a).
In the second experiment, we cover the upper hole [see Figure 23.2(b)], and ﬁre 1000
bullets as in the ﬁrst experiment.
Since the two holes are assumed to be identical, we
expect that around 50 bullets will make it to the other side. Thus, the probability—call it
P2 this time—for the bullets ﬁred from that particular gun to pass through the lower hole
is also 0.05 or 5%. P2 is expected to have a distribution that looks very much like P1 with
maximum at A2 directly opposite the center of the lower hole. The curve for P2 is shown
at the bottom of Figure 23.2(b).
Finally, in the third experiment, we leave both holes open [see Figure 23.2(c)], and ﬁre
1000 bullets as in the ﬁrst two experiments. If we count the number of bullets collected by
the wooden obstacle, we will see that around 100 bullets will have made it to the other side.
Thus, the probability—call it P12—for the bullets ﬁred from the gun to pass through both
holes is 0.1 or 10%. P12 is expected to have a distribution of the shape shown at the bottom
of Figure 23.2(c). And indeed that is what one ﬁnds in an actual experiment, because each
bullet arriving at the ﬁrst barrier can go either through the upper hole, in which case it
will be part of the P1 distribution, or through the lower hole, in which case it will be part
of the P2 distribution. If we want to see which bullet goes through which hole, we place a
suﬃciently intense light source2 behind the ﬁrst barrier and watch the bullets one by one
2This light source could be the Sun if the experiment is performed outside.

as they come out the back side.
A consequence of this experiment is that probabilities add.
The probability for the
bullets to land on the wooden screen when both holes are open is the sum of the probabilities
for each hole when the other is blocked. In terms of the symbols deﬁned above, P12 =
P1 + P2. In particular—when the holes are far apart—the probability that a bullet lands
opposite the midpoint of the two holes is negligible (almost zero).
What do you know? 23.3. When the two holes are apart, the probability of ﬁnding
a bullet at the midpoint of the two holes is zero [see Figure 23.2(c)]. As you bring the
holes closer, it is no longer zero. Can you make this probability equal to P1? Larger
than P1?
23.2.2
Waves and Double-Slits
A wave approaches an obstacle—from the left—with two apertures whose separation is
not too much larger than the wavelength of the wave (see Figure 23.3). The wave is then
stopped at a second barrier—with an array of detectors, if necessary—which measures the
intensity of the arriving wave at various (vertical) points of the barrier. As for the bullets,
we perform three experiments. In the ﬁrst experiment, we close the lower aperture as shown
in Figure 23.3(a). Assuming that the size of the aperture is not exceedingly large, the wave
will diﬀract through the upper hole. The diﬀracted wave will have a (wide) central band
and two faint secondary bands on both sides of it [see Section 11.3, especially Figure 11.8].
The intensity curve of the diﬀracted wave is shown in Figure 23.3(a).
For all practical
purposes, the secondary bands can be neglected, giving an intensity curve that is similar
to that of the probability curve of the bullets of the previous subsection. Let us call this
intensity I1. We could also interpret I1 as the probability of ﬁnding “a wave” on points of
the detecting barrier.
In our second experiment, we close the upper aperture.
Now the wave will diﬀract
through the lower hole, and the intensity curve of the diﬀracted wave is shown in Fig-
ure 23.3(b). Let us call this intensity (or probability) I2.
The third experiment leaves both apertures open. The approaching wave now splits up.
Part of it goes through the upper hole and part through the lower hole [Figure 23.3(c)].
The two holes act as coherent sources, which emit waves on the right that will interfere and

produce the typical fringes discussed in Chapter 11. The intensity curve will look like that
shown in Figure 23.3(c). Let us call this intensity I12. It is clear that I12 ̸= I1 + I2; and we
expect that, because, for waves, we add the amplitudes not the intensities.
Let us denote the amplitude of the wave coming through the upper hole by a1, and that
through the lower hole by a2. The total amplitude—call it a12—will then be a12 = a1 + a2.
Since intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude, we have I12 = (a12)2 =
(a1 + a2)2, which gives
I12 = I1 + I2 + 2a1a2,
(23.1)
where I1 is the intensity of the upper hole and I2 that of the lower hole. This shows that
the total intensity is not equal to the sum of the two intensities. If the two holes produce
waves of equal amplitude, and two crests or two troughs meet at some point, then we have
a1 = a2, where the amplitudes can be positive (crest) or negative (trough). Substituting a1
for a2 in Equation (23.1), we obtain (a12)2 = (a1 + a1)2 = (2a1)2 = 4(a1)2, or I12 = 4I1.
This is constructive interference. If one crest and one trough meet at some point, then we
have a1 = −a2 (it does not matter which one is crest and which one trough). Substituting
−a1 for a2 in Equation (23.1), we obtain (a12)2 = (a1 −a1)2 = 0, or I12 = 0, which is
destructive interference.
23.2.3
Electrons and Double-Slits
Now we come to the crucial double-slit experiment with electrons. Electrons are particles
that can be ﬁred from an “electron gun.”3 We set up three experiments similar to the ones
for bullets. When the upper hole is open, we get what we expect: a probability distribution
P1 very similar to the one shown in Figure 23.2(a). When the lower hole is open, we get a
probability distribution P2 of Figure 23.2(b).
Now we open both holes, expecting to see a probability distribution P12 of Figure 23.2(c).
But that is not what we get! Instead, we observe a probability distribution very similar to
Figure 23.3(c). How can that be? The answer is simple: according to de Broglie, electrons
have wave properties, and when you send them through a double slit, they show the typical
3Such a device actually exists.

Section 23.2
The Double-Slit Experiment
331
interference fringes expected of waves. In fact, if the holes are small enough, even a single
slit can exhibit diﬀraction, so that the probability distributions P1 and P2 will look more
like the intensity curves in Figures 23.3(a) and (b). But we ignore these diﬀraction eﬀects.
Is the answer really that simple? After all the electrons are particles, and we can, if we
want to, ﬁre them one at a time. And when each electron reaches the double-slit, it cannot
“split up” as a wave does.
Box 23.2.1. The electron has to go either through the upper hole or the lower hole.
If it goes through the upper hole, it belongs to the distribution P1; if it goes through the
lower hole, it belongs to the distribution P2. There is, therefore, no way for the electron
to end up at the midpoint of A1A2, where both P1 and P2 are almost zero. But it does!
How can it be? We answer this question in two diﬀerent ways: In the language of nature,
mathematics, and in a human language, English.
First mathematics. In this language, we have to forget the statement of Box 23.2.1. It is
When spoken in its
native language
(mathematics), quantum
theory is easy to
understand.
a statement that comes from picturing the electrons as bullets. Although the electrons are
detected as particles, they are not entirely particles, as humans have experienced particles
such as bullets. In the language of mathematics, the electrons that go through the upper
hole are described by a wave function (or probability amplitude), say Ψ1 at the detecting
screen. Similarly, the electrons that go through the lower hole are described by another
wave function Ψ2. The total probability amplitude—call it Ψ12—for the electrons detected
at the screen is simply the sum of the two amplitudes: Ψ12 = Ψ1 + Ψ2. Exactly like waves!
To ﬁnd the total probability, we must square the total amplitude. Now, in general, Ψ1
and Ψ2 are complex numbers, adding a slight complication in the algebra. To avoid this
inessential complication, let us assume that Ψ1 and Ψ2 are real, as they are in many actual
situations. Then, squaring Ψ12 as in Equation (23.1), we obtain the total probability P12:
P12 = P1 + P2 + 2Ψ1Ψ2.
(23.2)
This shows that the total probability distribution has an interference pattern, exactly as in
waves. Thus, in the language in which nature likes to speak, there is no diﬃculty explaining
the behavior of the electrons.
We humans, however, have no “feel” for such mathematical explanation, and insist that
we should explain the electrons’ behavior in our own language, in which the statement in
Box 23.2.1 is quite legitimate. Let us see how far we can go.
When spoken in a

theory is
incomprehensible.
READER: The electron that reaches the double-slit is a particle. Therefore, we have no
choice but to assume that it either goes through the upper hole or the lower one.
AUTHOR: But contrary to the bullet, an electron is not easily visible. So, you can’t tell
whether it went through the upper hole or the lower one. We should not make any assump-
tions unless we can verify it.
R: Okay. So, tell me, is it possible to put a light bulb behind the ﬁrst barrier to actually see
the electrons? If so, then I have proved my point. Just illuminate the path of the electrons
behind the slits as shown in Figure 23.4, and you will see for yourself that the electrons are
either going through the upper hole or the lower hole.
A: This much I know: In the so called gedanken experiments, anything that does not violate
any known laws of physics is allowed. So, I don’t see any reason why we can’t put a light
bulb behind the barrier.
R: Okay. Then put a really bright light bulb behind the slits to make sure that we can see
the electrons.
A: I am sorry, but there is a problem with putting a light bulb behind the slits. It will
interfere with the motion of the electrons.

332
Chapter 23
Quantum Theory II
Electrons
Electron gun
Figure 23.4: A light bulb behind the slits will help locate which hole each electron goes through.
R: Wait a minute! You are contradicting yourself. If you have forgotten, let me refer you
to your own discussion of bullets and double-slits in which you said, and I quote, “If we
want to see which bullet goes through which hole, we place a suﬃciently intense light source
behind the ﬁrst barrier and watch the bullets one by one as they come out the back side.”
A: That is a very good point. However, it is the diﬀerence in the size of a bullet and an electron
that forces me to be careful when analyzing their motion. Any time you shine light, you
are sending a large number of photons, each of which carries some energy. (Remember
the Einstein-Planck formula E = hf?) However large the number of these photons is, and
however large the amount of energy each one carries, their eﬀect upon impact on a bullet is
inﬁnitesimal. It is like hitting a bowling ball with tiny grains of salt. But the same photons,
even a single one of them, if it carries enough energy, can aﬀect the motion of the electron
considerably.
R: I get it now. But still, I don’t see any reason why we can’t go on with our experiment. Let
the photons interfere with the electrons. As long as we can see which hole each one passes
through, it shouldn’t matter.
A: It does matter, because when the light interacts with the electrons, it randomizes their
path and smears out the interference fringes on the detecting screen. In other words, the
electrons will behave like bullets, and their wave nature disappears.
R: Okay. If the interaction of light with electrons destroys the wave property, let’s minimize
this interaction. Use a dimmer light bulb.
A: Good idea! But it does not completely obliterate the problem. You see, when you dim the
light, you are just reducing the number of photons not the energy of each one. And when
you send fewer photons to the slits, they can interact with fewer electrons.
R: You mean that, only for some electrons can we tell which hole they went through. That is
ﬁne as long as we can track them to the detecting screen. Maybe we will ﬁnally be able to
see the interference fringes formed by these electrons. Is there a way of diﬀerentiating the
electrons that we see at the slit from those that we miss?
A: (After a long, thoughtful pause) I think I have found a way. The electron detectors are
counters that click when an electron arrives at them. Since we are sending the electrons
one by one, we can keep track of them by a sequence of ﬂashes and clicks. Here is how. If
there is a ﬂash at the upper hole and then a click at the screen, we know the electron came
from the upper hole. Same for the lower hole. Finally if there is no ﬂash at the holes but
there is a click at the screen, we know the electron was missed.

Section 23.2
The Double-Slit Experiment
333
R: That is great! So, now we can track the electrons. Do we see an interference?
A: We do and we don’t! The electrons that we detected at the holes form a bullet-like pattern.
Their potential fringe is smeared out again due to the randomization by interacting with
photons.
R: Let me guess. The missed electrons will form an interference fringe.
A: Exactly! As long as you don’t interfere with electrons, they exhibit wave properties. As
soon as you disturb them, they exhibit only their particle properties.
R: That is frustrating. There must be a way of seeing all the electrons without disturbing
them too much. You said that reducing the intensity of light changed only the number of
photons, but not their energy. What if we reduce the energy of the photons rather than
their number? Hey, we can do that, can’t we? If I remember correctly, the energy of the
photon is given by E = hc/λ. So, let’s make the wavelength of the photons as large as
possible. Let’s replace the light bulb with a source of long EM waves.
A: That is very ingenious! There are microwave sources producing photons with wavelengths
a few centimeters long, or about 100,000 times longer than the photons of a light bulb.
R: Good! Let’s use a microwave source.
A: We certainly can; and when we do, we indeed see the interference of the electrons on the
detecting screen.
R: So, that’s it! We have accomplished what we wanted.
A: I hate to disappoint you, but with a long-wavelength photon, we encounter a new obstacle.
R: What now?
A: A long wavelength cannot resolve the two slits, because the separation between the slits is
much much smaller than the wavelength. It is like trying to hit only one of a pair of billiard
balls separated by just a few millimeters with a “stick” that is as thick as a football ﬁeld! If
the wave cannot tell the two slits apart, it is certainly incapable of determining which hole
a given electron passes through.
R: So, are you saying that we are stuck?
A: I’m afraid so. In fact, our inability to determine the hole through which each electron
passes, and at the same time observe the interference fringes is related to the uncertainty
principle. When we determine the hole through which the electron passes, we are localizing
it, i.e., we are making the uncertainty in position small. The uncertainty principle then
enlarges the uncertainty in momentum, which is related to the wavelength via de Broglie
relation. A large uncertainty in wavelength translates into the absence of the wave nature,
i.e., interference. On the other hand, when we do observe the wave nature of the electrons
by using long-wavelength photons, we lose information about their location at the slits.
R: Wait a minute! Maybe we are not stuck after all. Since it was the small size of the slit
separation relative to the photon wavelength that prevented us from determining which hole
the electron went through, we can increase the separation until it is much larger than the
(long) wavelength of the photons. That way we do not disturb the electrons—because our
photons have very long wavelengths—and we can tell which holes each one goes through—
because the photon wavelength is small compared to the slit separation.
A: But you are forgetting something. If we increase the separation between the two slits to the
point that it is much larger than a few centimeters, we won’t see interference, because that
kind of separation is also much much larger than the electron wavelength. See Section 11.3,
if you don’t remember the condition for interference.
R: I don’t like quantum theory. It just doesn’t make sense.

a quantum candy can “get out of” a quantum jar. Another example is quantum angular
momentum.

Angular Momentum and Spin
At ﬁrst glance there seems to be no relation between the quantum theory and the classical
Newtonian theory that it replaced. After all, in the classical theory there is no quantization
of energy, no spooky tunneling, and no probability. On closer examination, however, a
deep relation between the two theories emerges. For example the fact that the concept of

energy—developed laboriously in Newtonian physics—can be used in the quantum theory
speaks to such a relation.
Many other concepts such as momentum, potential energy,
kinetic energy, electric and magnetic ﬁelds, etc. can also be “translated” into the quantum
language. It was indeed the translation—sometimes called the ﬁrst quantization—of the
conservation of mechanical energy that gave rise to the Schr¨odinger equation.
23.3.1
Angular Momentum
A classical quantity that gives truly astonishing results upon “quantization” is angular
momentum. Let us recall from Section 8.2 that classical angular momentum is a vector
quantity J related to rotational motion. For the simplest case of rotation about an axis, the
direction of this vector is given by the right-hand rule: curl the ﬁngers of your right hand in
the direction of rotation, your thumb points in the direction of J. It therefore points along
the axis of rotation. And for an even simpler case of a single particle of mass m moving on
a circle of radius r with speed v, one can give the magnitude of J: it is rmv or rp, with p
the (linear) momentum of the particle.
What do you know? 23.5. What is the direction of the Earth’s angular momentum?
By varying the speed or the orientation of the axis of rotation, we can vary the magnitude
and the direction of the classical angular momentum at will: holding a single bicycle wheel
by its shaft, we can rotate it as fast as we please, and can orient the shaft in any direction
we desire. There is no theoretical restriction on the direction and magnitude of the classical
angular momentum. Another way of stating this is to say that classical angular momentum
can have any (precise) value for its projections along three mutually perpendicular axes.
Angular momentum, like
any other vector, is
determined completely
by its components.
Figure 23.5 shows the vector J and its projections Jx, Jy, and Jz along the three mutually
perpendicular axes, x, y, and z. The three projections (also called components) uniquely
determine—and are uniquely determined by—J. There is no restriction on the values of the
components Jx, Jy, and Jz. There is also no restriction on how accurately we can measure
these components simultaneously. For any given J, of course, the values of the components
are restricted to lie between |J| (when J lies along the positive direction of the corresponding
axis) and −|J| (when J lies along the negative direction of the corresponding axis). Thus,
if J lies along the positive z-axis, then Jz = |J| (and Jx = 0, Jy = 0); and if J lies along
the negative z-axis, then Jz = −|J| (and Jx = 0, Jy = 0).
In quantum theory, angular momentum, like other physical quantities, is represented
by a matrix; in fact, by three matrices corresponding to the three components Jx, Jy, and

Jz. The mathematics of matrices (see Section 22.2.2) then yields the result that no two
components of a given angular momentum commute. Hence, by matrix mechanics,
Box 23.3.1. No two components of angular momentum can be measured simultaneously.
It turns out, nevertheless, that the matrix representing the magnitude4 of J—denoted by
|J| or J—commutes with all three components. Therefore, this magnitude and one (and
only one) of the components—usually taken to be the z-component, Jz—can be used to
determine an angular momentum state of a system (see Box 22.2.1).
What do you know? 23.6. Can you simultaneously measure Jz and the projection
of J onto the xy-plane (not Jx or Jy individually)?
When the elegant machinery of matrix theory is applied to quantum angular momentum
some surprising results emerge. The ﬁrst result is that the magnitude of the angular mo-

|J| =

j(j + 1) ℏ, where j is a nonnegative integer and ℏis the Planck constant divided by
2π. Thus, we can have angular momenta of magnitudes 0 (corresponding to j = 0),

(corresponding to j = 1),
√
6 ℏ(corresponding to j = 2), etc. This is in complete contrast
to the classical angular momentum. While classically, any nonnegative number was a possi-

and jℏ. Furthermore, it cannot take just any value between those two numbers, but only
values obtained from them in steps of 1. So, (in units of ℏ) the smallest value for Jz is −j;
the next value is −j + 1, the next one is −j + 2, etc., all the way to j −1, and ﬁnally j.

The other allowed values for Jz are ℏ, 0 and −ℏ. The ﬁgure shows that only 5 angles are
allowed for the orientation of J relative to the z-axis.
We chose Jz as the second observable to label the quantum angular momentum state.
We could have chosen Jx or Jy. Moreover, the orientation of a coordinate system is com-
pletely arbitrary. We can choose any direction to be our positive z-direction (the x- and
y-directions are of course not arbitrary once we choose a z-axis). Therefore, the quantization
of projections applies to any direction. We summarize our ﬁndings in the following Box.
However, as we shall see shortly, our conclusions apply only to orbital angular momentum,
i.e., the angular momentum resulting from the orbital motion of a particle around a center.
Box 23.3.2. (Quantization of orbital angular momentum) In quantum theory
the (magnitude of the) orbital angular momentum can take on only values given by
|J| =

j(j + 1) ℏ, where j is a nonnegative integer.
The projection of the orbital
angular momentum along any line can take on values between −jℏand jℏincremented
by ℏfrom the lowest to highest values. The number of these projections is 2j + 1.
Sometimes the quantization of the projection of angular momentum is interpreted as “quan-
tization of direction.” This is not entirely correct, because there is no restriction in quantum

direction we want along which to project the angular momentum vector. However, once this

direction (angle) with respect to it.

Spin
The pace at which the quantum weirdness popped at the early twentieth century physi-
cists was phenomenal. No sooner had one weirdness been “resolved” than another jumped
at them. People were just beginning to get used to the weird idea of quantized angular
momentum when they were hit with the weirder notion of spin.
Angular momentum is closely related to a quantity called magnetic moment. In fact,
Angular momentum and
magnetic moment.
it can be shown that (for electrically charged rotating objects) magnetic moment is always
proportional to angular momentum. Classically, a magnetic moment can be thought of as
a (usually microscopic) magnet with north and south poles. A magnetic moment has a
direction: it is the arrow that connects its south pole to its north pole. When you place a
magnetic moment in a magnetic ﬁeld it aligns itself with the ﬁeld so that its arrow is in the
same direction as the ﬁeld.
In the absence of a magnetic ﬁeld, a collection of classical magnetic moments will be
randomly oriented: their arrows are equally likely to point in any direction. When you
place these magnetic moments in a magnetic ﬁeld, many (but not all) of them will align
with the ﬁeld. Although the tendency is for all moments to align themselves, collision and
exchange of energy among the moments will reorient many moments in other directions.
Thus, the arrows of the moments can point in all directions, although the direction of the
ﬁeld is slightly preferred.
Now suppose that the magnetic ﬁeld is not homogeneous, but varies in strength in a

particular direction. Then, the physics of magnetism says that there is a force on each
moment, and this force depends on the angle between the moment and the ﬁeld. Let’s
say that the magnet is arranged so that the moments that are aligned with the ﬁeld (the
angle between the moment and the ﬁeld is 0) are pushed up by this force while those aligned
opposite to the ﬁeld (the angle between the moment and the ﬁeld is 180 degrees) are pushed
down. All the other moments (with angles lying between 0 and 180 degrees) are pushed
somewhere between these two extremes.
Figure 23.7(a) shows an apparatus that demonstrates the eﬀect of the force of an inho-
mogeneous magnetic ﬁeld on the magnetic moments. A source produces magnetic moments
randomly distributed in all directions. These moments travel horizontally through an in-
homogeneous magnetic ﬁeld, causing them to pick up a transverse component of speed, so
that when they come out of the ﬁeld, they will be diverted slightly up or down from their
original direction. Moments that are aligned with the ﬁeld will deﬂect farthest upward and
those anti-aligned farthest downward. The other moments lie between these two extremes.
If the magnetic moments behaved classically, the deﬂection would be continuous and
the deposit on the collector screen would be a continuous blob shown at the top of Fig-
ure 23.7(b). Of course, that is not what we expect, because microscopic magnetic moments
behave quantum mechanically. A quantum magnetic moment—being proportional to the
quantum angular momentum—has a discreet number of projections along any axis. In fact,
this number is given in Box 23.3.2 as 2j + 1, which is an odd number for any integer j.
Therefore, regardless of the magnitude of the magnetic moment, the number of angles it
makes with any direction is odd, and correspondingly, the number of blobs on the collec-
tor screen has to be odd. For example, if the angular momentum to which the magnetic
moment is proportional happens to have j = 1, then 3 blobs are expected, as shown in the
middle of Figure 23.7(b).
When Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach, two German physicists, performed an actual
experiment of the type described above using silver atoms, they observed a truly weird

outcome: The number of blobs turned out to be 2. It was hard enough to get accustomed
to the quantization of angular momentum with j being an integer. Now Nature was telling
us that j was not necessarily an integer. The orbital angular momentum, the kind that
results from the motion of the electron around the nucleus, could not be responsible for this
double-valuedness; its mathematical theory was air tight, and did not allow any noninteger

value for j. It was therefore suggested that the electron has not only an orbital angular
momentum, but an intrinsic spin. The name “spin” is a misnomer, suggesting an actual
intrinsic rotation of the electron. There is no such spin just as there is no “orbital” angular
momentum, because there is no “orbit.”5 The correct way of dealing with spin is to consider
it as another intrinsic property of a particle.
A particle is identiﬁed by specifying its
various physical characteristics such as mass, charge, speed, etc. Spin is one more such
characteristic.
Since 2j + 1 determines the number of blobs on the screen of Figure 23.7 and since
for spin this number is 2, we conclude that j = 1
2 for the intrinsic spin of some particles
(including the electron). It turns out that there are other possibilities for j. In fact, the
following box summarizes our understanding of a total angular momentum, consisting of
orbital and spin angular momenta:
Box 23.3.3. (Quantization of total angular momentum) In quantum theory the
(magnitude of the) total angular momentum can take on only values given by |J| =
p
j(j + 1) ℏ, where j is a positive integer or half-integer (an odd integer divided by 2).
The projection of the angular momentum along any line can take on values between
−jℏand jℏincremented by ℏfrom the lowest to highest values. The number of these
projections is 2j + 1.
Orbital angular momentum, whose value of j is usually denoted by l and referred to as
orbital angular momentum quantum number, is always an integer (see Box 23.3.2). Thus,
any half-odd-integer valuedness is associated with the spin. Instead of j one uses s for spin.

The concept of spin was the missing link in explaining the periodic table of elements.
Recall that the energy levels of a hydrogen atom are determined by the principal quantum
number n. Matrix mechanics states that a complete description of any quantum system is
given by a list of possible values of a complete set of compatible observables. For the H-
atom this list consists of n, l (the orbital angular momentum quantum number), lz—often
denoted by m—(the projection of the orbital angular momentum along the z-axis), and sz
(the projection of the electron spin along the z-axis). Sometimes we write this complete set
of compatible observables as |n, l, m, sz⟩. A rule that emerges out of solving the Schr¨odinger
equation for the H-atom is that l is restricted to nonnegative integer values that are less
than n. Thus, when n = 1 (i.e., when the H-atom has its lowest possible energy), l = 0;
and when n = 2, l = 1 or l = 0, and so on. For each l, there are 2l + 1 values for m, and
the value of sz is restricted to ± 1
2. Any set of possible values of these numbers determines
a quantum mechanical state of the H-atom.
What do you know? 23.10. A physicist claims to have discovered a particle with a

To build more complicated atoms, one adds an appropriate number of electrons to the
H-atom (and a corresponding number of positive charges to the nucleus), assuming that
the states of the resulting atom are also described by |n, l, m, sz⟩. The question is: As we
add more and more electrons to build more and more complicated atoms, in what states do
they place themselves? One is interested in the lowest possible energy state also called the
ground state. One might think that keeping n = 1, the lowest possible energy state, and

adding all the electron in this state might be a possibility. However, the resulting “table of
elements” will not be periodic at all. In fact, it will consist of a single column in which all
elements lie.
In order to reconstruct the periodic table of elements, Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958), an
Austrian physicist, proposed the
Pauli exclusion principle.
Box 23.3.4. (Pauli Exclusion Principle:) No two identical fermions (such as two
electrons) can be placed in the same quantum state.
This principle turned out to have far-reaching ramiﬁcations involving the role of relativity
in the formulation of quantum theory. At this point, we simply accept the principle and
apply it to the construction of the periodic table.

and

. Therefore, we can
place only two electrons in the n = 1 state. This is sometimes restated as two electrons are
needed to ﬁll the ﬁrst shell. The (neutral) atom that has two electrons is helium. Therefore,
both electrons in the ground state of the helium atom have n = 1, and helium has a ﬁlled

The ground state of lithium—the element that has 3 electrons—has 2 electrons in the
ﬁrst shell and 1 electron in the second shell. The ground state of beryllium—the element
with 4 electrons—has 2 electrons in the ﬁrst shell and 2 electrons in the second shell. The
ground state of carbon—the element with 6 electrons—has 2 electrons in the ﬁrst shell and 4
electrons in the second shell. The ground state of neon—the element with 10 electrons—has
2 electrons in the ﬁrst shell and 8 electrons in the second shell. The next electron can no
longer end up in an n = 2 state: this shell gets ﬁlled with 8 electrons. Therefore, sodium,
which has 11 electrons, starts ﬁlling up the n = 3 states (the third shell).
What do you know? 23.11. Fluorine has 9 electrons. With what elements does it
combine most strongly?
Helium and neon are the ﬁrst two of the so-called “inert gases.” These are elements
that have ﬁlled (or closed) shells, and are chemically inactive, because they cannot “share”6
electrons with other elements. These electrons are rather tightly bound to the rest of the
atom. The inert gases appear in the same column of the periodic table of elements. The
element that comes right after an inert gas is chemically very active, because it has an extra
electron outside a closed shell that is loosely bound to the rest of the atom and can be easily
shared by other atoms. Hydrogen, lithium, and sodium are examples of such elements, and
they appear in the same column of the periodic table.
The other entries of the periodic table can also be explained using the exclusion principle.
However, as the number of electrons increases in the atom other considerations have to be
taken into account, complicating the details of the theory. For example, the third inert
gas, argon, does not have the entire third shell closed. Only the l = 0 and l = 1 subshells
of the third shell are ﬁlled. This is because for multielectron atoms it is possible for the
lower values of n to have higher energies. These complications render the construction of
the periodic table of elements beyond the scope of this book.
The discovery of spin was important not only because it explained the periodic table, but
also because it was a part of a larger quantity that we have called total angular momentum.
The signiﬁcance of this quantity is that
Box 23.3.5. The total angular momentum of a quantum system is conserved. The
system may consist of diﬀerent parts each having its own spin and orbital angular mo-
mentum. These parts may be isolated or interacting among themselves.
There is a deep connection between this conservation law and the fact that physical phe-
nomena are independent of the orientation of the objects from which they emanate. For
example, when we measure the gravitational force between two masses at a given distance,
we don’t have to take into consideration whether the two masses lie along a line extended
from left to right, or up to down, or front to back, or anything in between. In general,
6Electron sharing—whereby one atom shares one or more of its electrons with another atom—is at the
root of all chemical reactions.

neither each individual spin (even their total), nor each individual orbital angular momen-
tum (even their total) is conserved. It is only the total angular momentum that does not
change. Of course if the system has only spins, or only orbital angular momenta, then the
total of that quantity is conserved.
23.4
Quantum Measurement
It is appropriate at this point to discuss an important consequence of the quantum theory:
measurement. Any act of measurement involves a system, some of whose properties are
being measured, and an apparatus, which does the measuring.
In classical physics it is
assumed that the act of measurement does not inﬂuence the property being measured.
This is so ingrained in our thinking that we never question the impact of the apparatus on
the system. And there is good reasons for this: in almost all cases, the measuring apparatus
is much “smaller” than the system. A telescope can hardly inﬂuence the motion of a galaxy,
a star, or a planet; watching a race car as we time its travel from one point to another in
a speed measurement has no impact on the car whatsoever; the inﬂuence of ammeters and
voltmeters on the currents and voltages for which they are designed is minimal.
A quantum mechanical measurement tells a completely diﬀerent tale. Two important
factors enter a quantum measurement:
• The apparatus is much larger that the quantum system being measured. Therefore,
its inﬂuence on the system can certainly not be neglected: the process of measurement
becomes an interaction between the apparatus and the quantum system.
• This interaction demands a chain of events, the beginning link of which is a quantum
interaction, and the end link of which is a macroscopic signal that we can detect.
We now focus on the theory of measurement in quantum physics.
Any (quantum) measurement is made on a system in some quantum state. The latter

is deﬁned in terms of—or, as is more commonly stated, labeled by—a complete set of
compatible observables. For example, states of a hydrogen atom (or its electron) are labeled
by the energy (with quantum number n), the orbital angular momentum (with quantum
number l), the projection of the orbital angular momentum along some axis, say the z-axis
(with quantum number m), and the projection of the electron spin along the same axis (with
quantum number sz). We have denoted such states by |n, l, m, sz⟩. For example,
1, 0, 0, 1

describes the hydrogenic electron in its lowest energy (−13.6 eV), with (necessarily) l = 0
and m = 0, whose spin projection along the z-axis is 1
2ℏ.
A general state of the hydrogenic electron is given in terms of a superposition of labeled
states. This means that Ψ for the electron is a sum of diﬀerent |n, l, m, sz⟩’s each multiplied
by a number (coeﬃcient). The square of each coeﬃcient represents the probability of the
electron to be in that particular state. For instance,

Suppose that a hydrogen atom is “prepared” in state Ψ1, and we measure its energy.
What is the result of the measurement? It is clear that although Ψ1 is a superposition

because both states have the same energy. Similarly, a measurement of orbital angular

projection are sharp in Ψ1. On the other hand, measurement of the spin projection does
not yield a deﬁnite result: it gives 1
2ℏhalf the time and −1
2ℏthe other half. We say that
spin projection is blurred in Ψ1.
Thus far, we have measured only compatible observables. What about the measurement
of incompatible observables? It should be clear from the uncertainty principle that such a
measurement is always blurred. In the case of hydrogen, for example, position is not one
of the compatible observables. Hence, any position measurement on a state |n, l, m, sz⟩(or
superposition of such states) is always blurred. This is the reason behind Figures 22.3 and
22.4. We, therefore, conclude that
Box 23.4.1. A measurement of one of the compatible observables made on a system
labeled by those observables can be either sharp (if the corresponding probability is 1)
or blurred (if the corresponding probability is less than 1).
Any measurement of an
incompatible observable is always blurred.
Example 23.4.2. What is the probability that a measurement of the spin projection on Ψ2 of
Equation (23.3) yields −1
2ℏ? Since the coeﬃcient of the term with sz = −1
2 is 0.8, the probability
is (0.8)2 or 0.64, indicating that the spin projection is blurred.
What is the probability that a measurement of the orbital angular momentum projection on
Ψ2 above yields 0? Since both terms have m = 0, the probability is 1. Stated diﬀerently, the
probability is the sum of the squares of the coeﬃcients of all terms with m = 0. In the case of Ψ2
we have (0.6)2 + (0.8)2, which is 1. Thus, m has a sharp value in Ψ2.
What is the probability that a simultaneous measurement of energy and spin projection yields
−13.6 eV and −1
2ℏ, respectively? Since no labeled state exists in Ψ2 with n = 1 and sz = −1
2, i.e.,
since the coeﬃcient of such a labeled state is 0 in Ψ2, the probability is zero.

What do you know? 23.12. Referring to Equation (23.3), what is the probability
for orbital angular momentum to be 1? To be 2? To be zero? What is the probability

of the possible values of that observable. Since this value is necessarily sharp immediately
after the measurement, we must have “channeled” the system into a state with a sharp
value for that particular observable. Thus the act of measurement sends a quantum system
into a state labeled by one of the values of the measured observable. This is the essence of
a quantum measurement.

Quantum Entanglement
The spookiest outcome of the quantum theory is quantum entanglement, a phrase coined
by Schr¨odinger himself. It started with Einstein’s struggle to show that the quantum theory
proposed by Max Born, in which probability played a fundamental role, was incomplete.
In a number of conferences attended by the prominent physicists of the time, including
Einstein and Bohr, Einstein would come up with some ingenious gedanken (or thought)
experiments, pointing, at ﬁrst glance, to the incompleteness of the quantum theory. Bohr,

after a few hours of thought, would discover the ﬂaw in Einstein’s arguments and report
it to him. One such argument seemed to have the potential of undermining the quantum
theory.
Einstein and two of his collaborators, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, wrote a paper
in 1935 that appeared to have given a dizzying jolt to (the completeness of) the quantum
theory. In this paper, the authors suggest an experiment, now known as the EPR experi-
ment, which demonstrates an ostensibly “telepathic communication” between two distant
particles, violating the quantum theory. Instead of the original experiment, we shall examine
a modiﬁcation of it, proposed by David Bohm, that involves the spin of an electron.
A pair of electrons are produced at a source, ﬂying oﬀin opposite directions to two
distantly separated spin detectors as shown in Figure 23.8. The source prepares the two-
electron system in a state in which each orbital angular momentum is zero and the total
spin is also zero. Since the total angular momentum is just the sum of the spins in this case,
and since this total angular momentum is conserved, we conclude that—in the absence of
any disturbance—the total spin must remain zero. In particular, just before they enter the
detectors, the electrons must have opposite spins: if El is up (its sz is + 1
2), then Er is down
(its sz is −1
2), and vice versa.
Now suppose we measure the projection of the spin of El along the z-direction in the left
detector—which could be located in New York—without measuring or otherwise disturbing
Er. If the result of our measurement turns out to be “spin up,” we conclude that Er, which
by now has reached the right detector—which could be located in London—must be in a
spin-down state, and vice versa. In other words, the two electrons are entangled.
The mere fact that a measurement could inﬂuence the outcome of another performed
far away is not a quantum mechanical spook. It happens classically as well. Take a penny
and cut it thin in the middle so that one half bears the head and the other the tail; put
each half in a locked box so no one can see it; give one box to Jack heading toward New
York, and the other box to Jill heading toward London. If Jack opens his box, he will know
exactly what Jill will ﬁnd in her box when she opens it.
Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen—and later, Bohm—were trying to show that quantum
mechanics was wrong or incomplete. They argued that because the determination of the
EPR paradox stated.
spin projection of El instantaneously speciﬁes the spin projection of Er, and because nothing
can move faster than light, Er must have had the speciﬁed value all along. In other words,
the sz-value of Er must have been sharp. Now suppose we take our projection line to be the
y-axis and measure sy of El. Again, we may get either + 1
2 or −1
2 for El, and the opposite
for Er. From this measurement we have to conclude that the sy-value of Er must have
been sharp. Therefore, the quantum mechanical state of Er must have been labeled by the
sharp values of sy and sz. This violates the uncertainty principle, because, as Box 23.3.1

344
Chapter 23
Quantum Theory II
indicates, sy and sz are not compatible! How does quantum theory respond to this?
The best way to analyze the response is to speak in the language in which quantum
theory is most comfortable: mathematics. The source prepares a two-electron system with
EPR paradox resolved.
total spin zero. The only way it can do this is by placing the left electron in the up position
and the right one in the down position or vice versa.
So the state Ψ prepared by the
source is a superposition of two states, which we designate as |u d⟩and |d u⟩. Let us ﬁrst
explain these states. u stands for “up” and d for “down.” The words “up” and “down”
have nothing to do with vertical direction. The symbol |u d⟩means that if we choose any
line, the left electron El will have some projection on this line which we arbitrarily call
“up”—thus the placement of the letter u on the left in the brackets. Er will then have an
opposite projection, which had better be called “down.” A similar meaning is attached to
the symbol |d u⟩. Thus the state of the two-electron system can be written as
Ψ =
1
√
2 |u d⟩+ 1
√
2 |d u⟩.
Note that Ψ does not have any sharp labels: no measurement of Ψ gives a sharp value for
any relevant observable.
When we make a measurement on the system, we channel it into a particular labeled
state; and this measurement need not involve both electrons. We have encountered this
kind of situation before: if we measure the energy of the hydrogen atom and get −13.6 eV
(corresponding to n = 1), we conclude, without any measurement, that the orbital angular
momentum is zero (see the discussion following Box 23.3.3). Thus, a measurement of the
spin projection of El alone is a measurement of the system, regardless of the distance
between its parts. Furthermore, before such a measurement, Ψ has only blurred values for
both spins. Only after our measurement along the z-axis does sz—and only sz—become
sharp. And if we choose the y-axis, then sy becomes sharp, but never both sy and sz. We
therefore conclude that the EPR argument against the uncertainty principle is not valid.
It should be evident from the discussion above (as well as the double-slit experiment
with electrons) that all the “weirdness” of the quantum theory stems from the superposition
principle. What Schr¨odinger called “entanglement” was nothing but this principle, which
Entanglement is nothing

from a mathematical point of view is so natural and so obvious that no attention or discus-
sion is (or need be) devoted to it. Superposition is so elementary that we encountered it
in disguise at the beginning of the book: the rule of the addition of vectors (see Appendix
C) is nothing but the superposition principle. As long as we recognize the essential role
this principle plays in the (necessarily mathematical formulation of the) quantum theory,
we will encounter no “weirdness.” It is only when we step outside the natural habitat of
the theory, and enter the realm of “interpretation,” that the quantum weirdness emerges.

Quantum Technology
The legitimacy of science lies in its ability to explain the mysteries of nature and to predict
unforeseen phenomena. No other area of science has been able to accomplish this better than
quantum physics. The drive for explanation is the sole motivation for all great scientists;
and the founders of the quantum theory were no exceptions. In their attempt at explaining
the hydrogen atom they stumbled on one of the most abstract and “strange” theories ever.
They did not foresee the awe inspiring impact it came to have on every aspect of industry
of the second half of the twentieth century and beyond.
Unlike some science educators, we will not “legitimize” science in general, physics in
particular, and especially quantum physics by devoting pages upon pages of this book on
the praise of their pragmatic utility. To us, when science predicts unseen elements that
are found later, when it describes the behavior of the simplest element, hydrogen, with
sophisticated mathematical precision, when it predicts the bending of light in gravity and

Section 23.6

measures this bending with utmost ingenuity, when it predicts the mechanism of the creation
of the universe and its expansion, when it foretells the existence of a background radiation
in our universe and measures the properties of this radiation with a disagreement of less
than one percent with the theoretical prediction, then science has proven its legitimacy far
beyond any of its application in a rocketship, a sports utility vehicle, a wide screen television
set, or a dazzling special eﬀect of a Hollywood movie.
However, quantum physics has given so much to our civilization that a short list of

the devices that are the backbone of modern technology would be informative. We want
to emphasize that none of the following inventions would have been possible without the
highly abstract, highly weird, and highly counter-intuitive theory behind them. In fact,
most of the inventors were physicists who (necessarily) had a good grasp of this theory.
• Transistor, invented in 1947 by three American physicists at the Bell Telephone
Laboratories, proved to be a viable alternative to the vacuum tube. This invention was
based crucially on the developments in the quantum theory of 1923–1930. By the late
1950s transistors supplanted vacuum tubes in many applications, and played a pivotal
role in the advancement of electronics. Their small size, low heat generation, high
reliability, and relatively small power requirements made possible the miniaturization
of complex circuitry such as the ones required by computers. During the decades of
the 1960s and 1970s individual transistors were superseded by integrated circuits in
which a multitude of transistors and other components (e.g., diodes and resistors)
were put together on a single tiny wafer of semiconducting material.
• Laser. Although Albert Einstein, using the newly discovered quanta, recognized the
existence of stimulated emission in 1917, no methods were found to use it in devices
until the 1950s. Two American and two Soviet physicists independently showed that it
was possible to construct such a device using optical light. The ﬁrst laser, constructed
in 1960, used a rod of ruby. Since then many types of lasers have been built.
• Electron microscope.
After the quantum theoretical assumption—and its later
experimental veriﬁcation—that electrons have wave properties, it was demonstrated
in 1926 that magnetic or electrostatic ﬁelds could serve as lenses for electrons or other
charged particles, and this discovery initiated the study of electron optics. In 1935 the
construction of the ﬁrst commercially built electron microscope was begun in England,
and it was soon followed by the production of microscopes in Germany and the United
States.
• Liquid crystal is a substance that ﬂows as a liquid but maintains some of the ordered
structure characteristic of a crystal. Certain organic substances when heated will not
melt directly but will turn from a crystalline solid to a liquid-crystal state. Although
liquid crystals were discovered in the 1920s, understanding of their properties and their
commercial applications (as in wristwatches and laptop computers) were boosted only
after the discovery and mastery of quantum mechanics.
• Microprocessors are the byproducts of the transistor technology. Early integrated
circuits (ICs) consisted of about 10 individual components on a silicon chip 3 mm
square. The development of large-scale integration (LSI) during the early 1970s made
it possible to pack thousands of transistors and other components on a chip of roughly
the same size. This technology gave rise to the microprocessor, an IC that contains
all the arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry needed to carry out the functions of
a digital computer’s central processing unit.
Very large-scale integration (VLSI),
developed during the 1980s, has vastly increased the circuit density of microprocessors
(as well as of memory and support chips). This technology has yielded microprocessors
containing more than 20,000,000 transistors on a chip with an area of less than 2 cm2.

• Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) appeared in 1981 when physicists at
the IBM Z¨urich Research Laboratory set out to build a tool for studying the local
conductivity of surfaces. Its principle of operation is based on the quantum mechanical
phenomenon of tunneling discussed at the beginning of this chapter. The probability of
the tunneling of electrons into a needle-like probe electronically attached to a monitor
decreases exponentially as the distance of the probe from the sample surface increases.
The scanning tunneling microscope makes use of this extreme sensitivity to distance
to map the bumps and grooves of a sample onto the monitor.
The magniﬁcation of STMs are so large that individual atoms can be seen!
And
whenever humans “see” something, they want to “touch” it. After “seeing” the Moon,
it took hundreds of thousands of years before humans were able to touch its surface
in 1969. We have also been able to touch the surfaces of Mars and Jupiter, and have
just sent probes to touch the surface of Saturn and its moons.
Only a few years
after seeing the atoms, the scientists at IBM found a way of not only touching the
atoms, but moving them! Figure 23.9 shows how by moving the atoms of iron in a
background of the atoms of copper, IBM scientists have been able to spell “atoms” in
Japanese.
Figure 23.9: The Kanji characters representing the word “atom.” The literal translation is approximately
“original child.”
• Nanotechnology.
Products are manufactured by casting, grinding, and milling.
From an atomic point of view, it is like trying to lay bricks using cranes and forklifts.
What if you could rearrange molecules and atoms individually? Nanotechnology is
the emerging technology based on the possibility of manipulating individual atoms
and molecules.
Nowadays physicists are talking about molecular robotics, i.e., robots that are molec-
ular both in their size and precision. These robots could be built to perform speciﬁc
tasks; for example, attacking the invader in the body of a sick person. As Feynman
said in a classic talk in 1959: “The principles of physics, as far as I can see, do not
speak against the possibility of maneuvering things atom by atom.”
All the considerations above should teach us—particularly those responsible for drafting
society’s science policies—that

Answers to “What do you know?”
23.1. A billionth is 10−9. In the language of Box 16.2.2, the number of successes is 1000,
and the probability is 10−9. So, 1000 = 10−9N, and N can be easily found to be 1012, or a
trillion.
23.2. At short distances, the attractive nuclear force takes over, and overcomes the inﬁnite
electric repulsion. The wall is no longer inﬁnitely tall, but has a ﬁnite height, allowing the
tunneling of the nuclei.
23.3. Remember that Figure 23.2(c) is simply the sum of Figure 23.2(a) and (b). Imagine
bringing the two curves of Figure 23.2(c) closer together. When they overlap, the sum can
be large. In particular if the two peaks get close enough to each other, the value between
them could equal or exceed each peak value.
23.4. Box 23.2.1 assumes that the electrons behave like bullets. It “pictures” the electrons
as classical particles. Both the assumption and the “picture” are wrong!
23.5.
The right-hand rule gives the direction as a directed line joining the south pole to
the north pole.
23.6.
No! If you know the value of the projection, you can get Jx and Jy from it. Then
you would know the values of Jz and Jx simultaneously, and this is not allowed by the
uncertainty principle.
23.7. No, because 306 = 17 × 18, and he has found a particle with j = 17.
23.8. From Box 23.3.2, |J| =
p
3(4) ℏor |J| =
√
12 ℏ. The values of the projection along
any path are −3ℏ, −2ℏ, −ℏ, 0, ℏ, 2ℏ, and 3ℏ. There are 7 directions.
23.9. The number of blobs is 2j + 1; and if 6 = 2j + 1, then j must be 5
2. The projection
values are, therefore, −5
2ℏ, −3
2ℏ, −1
2ℏ, 1
2ℏ, 3
2ℏ, and 5
2ℏif the particle is massive. If massless,
then the particle has only two projections: −5
2ℏ, and 5
2ℏ.
23.10. Note that 1.5
√
7 =
√
15.75, and that 15.75 = 3.5 × 4.5. So, the particle has a spin
of 3.5 = 7
2, making it a fermion.
23.11. Two of the 9 electrons ﬁll the ﬁrst shell. The remaining 7 end up in the second shell.
Since 8 electrons are needed to ﬁll the second shell, ﬂuorine combines best with elements
that have an electron by itself in a shell. Hydrogen, lithium, and sodium have such an
electron.
23.12.
The coeﬃcient of the state which has l = 1 is 0.8. Hence, the probability is 0.82
or 0.64. There is no l = 2 state in Ψ2; therefore, the probability is zero. The coeﬃcient
of the state which has l = 0 is 0.6.
Hence, the probability is 0.62 or 0.36.
Energy of
−13.6 eV corresponds to n = 1, and the coeﬃcient of the state with n = 1 is 0.6. Hence,
the probability is 0.62 or 0.36.

Chapter24
Epilogue: No “Interpretation”
Quantum mechanics has given scientists valuable lessons in how science works. Unfortu-
nately, it has also been misinterpreted and misrepresented by pseudoscientists and portrayed
as an antipode of classical physics. As a result, the majority of the educated public is con-
fused about both the quantum theory and classical Newtonian physics and the relation
between the two. We postpone the examination of the misrepresentation of the quantum
theory in pseudoscience until Chapter 35. This chapter concentrates, in part, on the char-
acteristics of the theory and how it is similar to (and diﬀerent from) the classical theory.
24.1
Continuity
Every ﬁnal chapter of each part of the book so far has shown the continuity of physical
ideas. If those parts only illustrated the chain-like attachment of each new idea to one or
more old ideas, quantum theory by itself is a paradigm of the continuity of ideas. The very
concept of quantum or bundle of energy occurred to Max Planck only after he accepted—
somewhat reluctantly—the tenet of statistical mechanics. There is no doubt that without
statistical mechanics the birth of the quantum theory would have been next to impossible.
The real progress in quantum theory started when Niels Bohr used Planck constant in
the theory of the hydrogen atom. His theory, although utterly artiﬁcial and incomplete,
paved the road to a thorough understanding of the atomic hydrogen. The ﬁrst step on
this road was taken by Louis de Broglie, who used Einstein’s relativistic and quantum
mechanical ideas of a photon to come up with the wave theory of the electron. De Broglie’s
electron waves could “explain” some of the artiﬁciality of Bohr’s theory. One can therefore
say that the wave nature of the electron is fundamentally tied to both relativity theory and
the quantization of the EM waves.
De Broglie’s idea fascinated Erwin Schr¨odinger, whose equation is a manifestation of
his commitment to the importance of the wave aspect of the electron. Furthermore, all
the quantities and concepts that comprise the Schr¨odinger equation—such as momentum,
potential energy, kinetic energy, and the conservation of mechanical energy—were taken
from the classical physics of Newton and Galileo. Thus, not only are the new ideas of the
quantum theory connected together like the links of a chain, but there is a huge link that
connects the quantum mechanical chain to the classical chain.

Role of “Fundamentalism”
Many philosophers of science, especially those with an aﬀection for Eastern mysticism, ab-
hor fundamentalism and reductionism.
Yet every signiﬁcant progress in every scientiﬁc
discipline has been precisely the result of digging deeper into the domain of the “fundamen-
tals” for the answer. The entire subject of quantum theory is a paradigm of reductionism
in action.
A Planck with a holistic philosophy would have stopped once he had discovered the
correct formula [Equation (20.3)] for the black body radiation curve. He would have prob-

ably thought to himself “My philosophy tells me not to fathom any further. Not to try to
ﬁnd a fundamental reason for why the equation I have discovered works. That would be a
reductionist approach, which is the opposite of my holistic philosophy.” But Max Planck,
being a true scientist, saw in the formula an opportunity to discover a fundamental secret
of nature, a fundamental constant h that is as important as the gravitational constant G
and the speed of light c.
The pursuit of fundamentals is one of the hallmarks of modern science, and every de-
velopment of the quantum theory attests to this fact. Niels Bohr correctly identiﬁed the
fundamental nature of a hydrogen atom, simply a nucleus with one electron attracted to-
wards it electrically. Louis de Broglie zoomed his investigation entirely on the nature of
the most fundamental particle, electron. Only by isolating this fundamental entity from a
holistic and crowded surrounding was he able to discover the wave nature of the electron,
paving the way for Erwin Schr¨odinger to ﬁnd the master equation of quantum physics.
And it was the application of this equation to the most fundamental interacting entity, a
hydrogen atom, that showed the power and promise of the quantum theory.
24.3
Speciﬁcity
Hydrogen atom is sometimes called the “gift of Nature.” Its simplicity (consisting of a
nucleus and a single electron) puriﬁes its theoretical study considerably. Chemists were
attracted to hydrogen because it seemed to be the “building block” of all other elements.
However, with the discovery of the electrons and the realization that even hydrogen atom
has internal structure, physicists, like all other scientists, considered hydrogen the key to
the understanding of all atoms.
Niels Bohr was the ﬁrst to apply the newly discovered quantum ideas to atoms. And he
Speciﬁc study of the

theory.
was intuitively aware of the fact that it would be a waste of time to adhere to a “holistic”
principle and tackle a collection of atoms or even a complex atom. In his fertile imagination,
Bohr isolated a single hydrogen atom from the rest of the universe and applied his inventions
to that single atom.
After Bohr’s 1913 paper on the quantization of the hydrogen atom, the eyes of the minds
of all physicists turned to one single hydrogen atom. Both Heisenberg and Schr¨odinger
concentrated their eﬀort on the solution of the hydrogen puzzle. Their discovery of the
all-encompassing quantum theory was the fruit of such a concentration on that speciﬁc
system. Just as Kepler’s discovery of the planetary motion came out of his study of Mars,
and Newton’s discovery of the universal law of gravity came out of his concentration on
an apple and the Moon, and Maxwell’s discovery of the electromagnetic waves came out
of his focusing on the mathematics of the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, so did the universal
quantum theory come about when Bohr, Heisenberg, Schr¨odinger and others focused their
attention on the simplest atom.

Induction versus Deduction

24.4
Induction versus Deduction
Scientiﬁc progress depends crucially on the interaction between observation and theory.
Observation provides the necessary framework in which theories can be built. The degree
to which observations inﬂuence the theories varies. In some cases the theory is strongly
inﬂuenced by one or more observation (or experiments). In others, there seems to be no
connection between a theory and any observation. The former procedure is called induc-
tion, the latter, deduction (see also Food for Thought 21.3.2).
Classical physics, for the most part, was an inductive science.
The discovered laws
were by and large direct results of observations. A good example of induction at work is
Kepler’s discovery of the laws of the planetary motion. These laws were chieﬂy Kepler’s
translation into the mathematical language of the patterns that he discovered in the data
collected by Tycho Brahe. In a similar vein, Galileo, Newton, Coulomb, Amp`ere, and all
the others that studied electricity and magnetism “induced” physical laws by translating
experimental results into mathematics. This mathematics, of course, could be the starting
point for the discovery of other important formal developments leading to new mathematical
breakthroughs. However, these formal accomplishments, important as they were, did not
lead to signiﬁcant physical discoveries.
Maxwell’s prediction of the electromagnetic waves was, on the other hand, one of the ﬁrst
applications of deductive reasoning in the development of physics. He did not merely trans-
late the results of some experiments or observation into mathematical formulas. Maxwell
changed the formulas so obtained to account for the more reliable charge conservation.
Physics, starting with the works of Planck and Einstein, has become a deductive science.
Granted that Planck used the results of the black body observations to come up with the
mathematical formula for the black body radiation curve, but his real breakthrough, the
idea that electromagnetic waves were composed of “bundles of energy,” was a result of
purely deductive reasoning. Similarly, the special theory of relativity (STR) was a natural
deductive extension of the Maxwellian electromagnetic theory as we shall see in the next
part.
Possibly because of the intangibility of the objects under study by modern physics
(subatomic particles that we cannot see and feel, and motion with speeds approaching the
speed of light), physicists must rely more on the deduction of the mind than the induction
of the senses. When Niels Bohr took the ﬁrst step toward applying the quantum ideas to the
hydrogen atom, he did so purely from his imagination. When de Broglie proposed the wave
nature of the electron, it was simply a conjecture fermenting in his mind. Schr¨odinger,
Heisenberg, Dirac, and other founders of the quantum theory all used the extraordinary
imaginative power of their minds to develop their ideas.
The inﬂuence of deduction is so prevalent in modern physics that some physicists have
come to believe that only deductive reasoning matters; that laws can be discovered by purely
mathematical thoughts. The development of quantum theory clearly appears to attest to
such a belief. Bohr did not use any experimental result to discover the theoretical foundation
of the quantization of the hydrogen atom; de Broglie did not resort to any experiments to
introduce the wave property of an electron; Schr¨odinger wrote down his equation only on
the basis of the wave nature of the electron.
So why bother with experiment and observation? The answer is that in any and all

deductive reasonings there is one or more experimental result that play a crucial role. The
experiments may not be the most recent ones, and may not have any direct bearing on the
theories; but without them the theories could not come into existence. While Maxwell’s
prediction of the electromagnetic waves was a deductive process, it could not have occurred
were it not for the experiments of the previous generation of physicists on how electric
currents produced magnetic phenomena. Similarly, Bohr’s application of the quantum idea
to the hydrogen atom gave results only because he used Rutherford’s experimental ﬁnding
that atoms consist of a small heavy positively charged nucleus as well as the negatively

charged electrons. Had Bohr used the raisin-pudding model of the atoms, he would not
have gotten anywhere.
24.5
No Interpretation for Quantum Theory
“Mathematics is the language of Nature.” This statement, coined by Galileo and implied
by as early a thinker as Plato, is at the heart of the constitution of science. Nowhere else
does the statement apply more appropriately than to modern physics. Due to its abstract
character, quantum physics can be spoken exclusively in the language of mathematics. A
sign of this exclusiveness is the highly deductive nature of quantum physics. The appearance
of √−1 in the Schr¨odinger equation, the emergence of matrices in the Heisenberg treatment
of the hydrogen atom, the inﬁnite-dimensional space that naturally connects the Heisenberg
and Schr¨odinger picture, and the association of the Ψ function with probability all point
to both the kinship of quantum physics to mathematics and its alienation from ordinary
human experience.
Quantum theory speaks
very clearly in the
language of
mathematics. It cannot
tolerate any
“interpretation.”
The abstract nature of quantum theory, along with the intangibility of the objects of
its study (subatomic particles, atoms, and molecules), has brought about the uneasy possi-
bility of “interpretation” (and therefore, misinterpretation). The practitioners of quantum
physics have learned to apply it to many situations using the only language in which the
practitioners can converse with the theory, mathematics. The paradigm of this inseparabil-
ity of mathematics and the quantum theory is the advice Richard Feynman, an American
physicist, gave in response to a question about how to interpret the theory:1 “Shut up and
calculate!” This quotation is by no means to be interpreted as the decree of an authority
to his subordinate. It simply embodies the fact that quantum physics is best spoken in the
language of mathematics, and that a translation into any human language risks the loss of
the theory’s message.
Unfortunately, many “scholars” insist on interpreting the quantum theory in the con-
text of human experience. We shall talk about the fallacy of requiring any translation or
interpretation of the quantum theory in some length in Chapter 35. This fallacy is very
easy to understand:
Box 24.5.1. While a translation of poetry or any masterpiece of literature from one
human language to another is fruitful but imperfect, the translation of quantum physics
from mathematics into any human language is next to impossible.
That is not to say that physicists ought to reject communicating the implications of the
quantum theory with the public. On the contrary, it is the responsibility of the physicists
to inform the public of the grandeur of the theory and to encourage the participation of the
youth in the noble pursuit of discovery. However, in so informing the public, it is also the
responsibility of the physicists to warn the layman of the limitation of the information and
the necessity of learning mathematics for a full understanding of the theory.

Part VI
Twentieth Century Physics:
Relativity Theory


Chapter25
Birth of Relativity
The twentieth century is only ﬁve years old and a multitude of events which are later to
become the hallmark of this century have already taken place: massive demonstrations
are being reported in many Russian cities, the biggest one taking place in St. Petersburg
and being brutally crushed by the czarist police; George Bernard Shaw has just published
his “Major Barbara.” A year earlier, the Rolls Royce company was founded and Picasso
completed his famous painting, “The Two Sisters.” Two years before, Orville and Wilbur
Wright successfully ﬂew a powered airplane and Jack London ﬁnished his well-known novel
“The Call of the Wild.” Four years before, the ﬁrst year of the twentieth century, as if
ushering us into the new century, Marconi transmitted telegraphic radio messages from
Cornwall to Newfoundland; the ﬁrst motor driven bicycle was invented; the ﬁrst Mercedes
car was constructed, the ﬁrst Nobel Prize was awarded; and, as if oﬃcially closing the gates
on the nineteenth century, the prominent ﬁgure of that era who ruled England for 64 years,
Queen Victoria, died.
Most important of all these events were probably thoughts brewing in the mind of a
quiet young clerk at the Bern patent oﬃce in Switzerland. The young man was Albert
Einstein (1879–1955) and the thoughts, later published in Annalen der Physik, were the
special theory of relativity (STR), the photoelectric eﬀect, and the theory of Brownian
motion, each one a revolution in scientiﬁc thinking and a cornerstone upon which to build
most of future physics. Such an outburst of creativity in the span of only a few months
was unprecedented in the history of science. Although Einstein won the Nobel prize for the
photoelectric eﬀect, his work on relativity—both the special theory of 1905 and the general
theory of 1916—is by far one of the most pivotal works in the history of science.
25.1
Law of Addition of Velocities
Chapter 20 showed how the marriage of thermodynamics and electromagnetic radiation led
Planck to the concept of quantum, a radical departure from classical Newtonian physics. In
this chapter we see how the conﬂict between mechanics and electromagnetism led Einstein
to his epoch-making discovery of relativity.
This conﬂict is between one of the simplest conclusions of Newtonian mechanics, the
law of addition of velocities, and the electromagnetic theory. To understand the law of
addition of velocities, we use the notion of a reference frame (RF) introduced in Section 6.1.
It is very common to replace an RF with one of the observers who reside in it. The word
“observer” is not to be construed necessarily as a human being; and if it is, all of his/her
human traits are to be ignored (see Food for Thought 27.5.3 for this seemingly unnecessary
precaution).

Figure 25.1: Illustration of the law of addition of velocities. Initially (t = 0) the ball and the person are
at A. One second later the ball is at C while the person has moved to B. Relative to the ground, therefore,
the ball has moved from A to C in one second.
Consider a train moving to the right with a passenger (observer) holding a ball in his
hand ready to throw it in the forward direction. All this is taking place while you, the
ground observer, are watching.
For deﬁniteness, let us assume that the train moves at
the speed of 30 m/s and the ball is thrown at 20 m/s relative to the thrower. Intuitively,
we expect the speed of the ball relative to you—relative to the ground observer—to be
30 + 20 = 50 m/s. Figure 25.1 gives a “proof” of this intuition. We can summarize this as
Box 25.1.1. (Law of addition of velocities) The velocity of an object (the ball)
relative to observer G (the ground observer) is equal to its velocity relative to observer
P (passenger) plus the velocity of P relative to G.
Denoting the velocity of the ball relative to G by vbg, that of the ball relative to P by vbp,
and that of P relative to G by vpg, we can write the above statement as
Law of addition of
velocities.
vbg = vbp + vpg.
(25.1)
This is the law of addition of velocities.
What do you know?
25.1. Al Capone and his gang are moving on the streets
of Chicago at 60 mph ﬁring bullets with a speed of 200 mph. What is the speed of
the bullets relative to the innocent bystanders if the bullets are ﬁred in the forward
direction? In the backward direction?
The motion of a boat crossing a river (Figure 25.2) is a good example of the validity—
and the vector nature of—Equation (25.1).
In this case, we speak of velocities of RFs
relative to one another, thus eliminating the “object” which may appear to have a diﬀerent
role than the observers. With the introduction of RFs, objects and observers are treated
equally. Thus, in the analysis of the motion of the boat, we can refer to the water RF (w),
the boat RF (b), and the ground RF (g). While the paddler paddles the boat perpendicular
to the ﬂow of the water (in the direction of vbw in Figure 25.2), the actual motion of the
boat is in the direction of vbg, because the water gives the boat an additional motion to the
right. The law of addition of velocities is so ingrained in our mind that we cannot accept
anything that appears to violate it. One instance of the violation of this law is Maxwell’s
electromagnetic theory.

denote the reference frames of car 1, car 2, and the ground, respectively. Use Equation
(25.1) (being careful about the order of the subscripts) to ﬁnd v12, the velocity of car 1
relative to car 2.
Recall from Chapter 14 (and Math Note E.14.3) that the equations of electricity and
magnetism—in particular the constants ke and km—lead to electromagnetic (EM) waves,
which travel with a speed c = 300, 000 km/s in vacuum. Maxwell’s derivation of the EM
wave equation and his prediction of their speed had nothing to do with their source (see
Box 14.3.1). This means that
Box 25.1.2. Every time you detect an electromagnetic wave, it is moving at the rate
of 300,000 km per second in vacuum.
Now suppose that Emmy, riding on a train, performs all her experimental and theoretical
investigations on electricity and magnetism on the train. Then she discovers the values of
the two constants ke and km precisely as was done on the ground (after all, why should
physics be diﬀerent on a train than outside it). And if she has a Maxwell on board, he
will discover the existence of electromagnetic waves and that their speed is 300, 000 km/s
in vacuum regardless (of the motion) of their source. Not only that, if Emmy sends these
EM waves out of the train and Karl, who is standing outside, detects them (not knowing
that they came from the train), he measures their speed to be 300,000 km per second.
The law of the addition of velocities was so ﬁrmly established in the nineteenth century,
that the notion of light traveling with the same speed relative to two diﬀerent RFs had no
right to exist despite the above discussion involving Emmy and Karl! So, what was the
alternative? One possibility was to consider the Earth as the special RF in which Maxwell’s
equations hold. But this was immediately dismissed because Copernicus, three centuries
earlier, had already cautioned everybody about the dangers of bestowing upon the Earth
a special position in the universe.
Moreover, the orbital motion of the Earth, with its
semi-annual change of direction, would have to have distorting eﬀects on the light of stars
and planets which would be easily detectable. Lack of such distortions immediately rules
out the Earth as a privileged frame. If the Earth is not the privileged RF, then, for the
same reason, no other planet, nor the Sun nor any other star or galaxy can be privileged
by Maxwell’s equation.

was invented and used by Huygens as early as 1690, but it became the subject of intense
scrutiny in the nineteenth century after Maxwell’s prediction of the EM waves.
Ether
theory demanded so many strange and complicated notions that by the last quarter of the
nineteenth century, physicists started to doubt its existence. The ﬁnal blow to ether came
through the works of Albert Michelson (1852–1931) and Edward Morley (1838–1923), one
of whose crucial experiments showed that there was no detectable motion of Earth relative
to ether, thereby undermining the theory and the concept of ether.
25.2
Principles of STR
When he was only 16 in 1895, Einstein wondered what the world would look like if one
could catch up with light; in particular, what would light itself look like. The intriguing
nature of this question can be appreciated by an analogy.
Water waves are easily made and seen to travel as concentric circles. Imagine that we
are quietly hovering over these circles at exactly the same speed as their expansion rate.
How would water waves
look if you caught up
with them?
How will the waves appear to us? Concentrating only on the local waves—clearly we cannot
move with all the waves as they go in diﬀerent directions—and assuming that we ride just
above a crest, we see the crest right underneath us, and since we move with it at exactly
the same speed, it will remain underneath. The other crests and troughs in the vicinity
also move at the same speed, and will also remain static. Thus, locally at least, the wave
ceases to exist! It will appear as a static and permanent deformation of water surface with
no motion and no oscillation.
If we could catch up with light, and if ether (the medium whose undulation was thought
How would light look if
you caught up with it?
to create light waves just as the undulation of the water in a pond creates water waves)
really existed, the ether wave (i.e., light) would also cease to exist! What is even more
intriguing is that, since ether was supposedly invisible, there would be no trace of light
left! Although in the case of water waves, a static deformation of water, the medium of
transmission, was left to remind us of the once traveling wave, no such reminder will remain
in the case of light. As soon as we catch up with it, light will be completely gone! Einstein
reckoned that light must be moving at a special speed.
In the intervening years between 1895 and 1905, the question of the behavior of light
and motion was constantly on Einstein’s mind. As his scientiﬁc and mathematical abilities
matured, the question took on the more deﬁnite form of how light (or electromagnetic
waves) behaved in moving frames.
He even came up with a version of the Michelson-
Morley experiment but, being theoretically inclined, never performed it. Once he became
acquainted with the works of Lorentz (who solved the problem of electrodynamics of moving
frames assuming that the speed of this motion was negligible compared to that of light), he
concluded that the speed of light must be the same in the moving frame and outside. This,
however, contradicted the addition law of velocities. These thoughts occupied Einstein’s
mind for months. In his own words,
Einstein explains how he
created STR.
Why do these two concepts contradict each other? I realized that this diﬃculty was
really hard to resolve. I spent almost a year in vain trying to modify the idea of Lorentz
in the hope of resolving this problem.
By chance a friend of mine in Bern (Michele Besso) helped me out. It was a beautiful
day when I visited him with this problem.
I started the conversation with him in
the following way: “Recently I have been working on a diﬃcult problem. Today I
come here to battle against that problem with you.” We discussed every aspect of this
problem. Then suddenly I understood where the key to this problem lay. Next day I
came back to him again and said to him, without even saying hello, “Thank you. I’ve
completely solved the problem.” An analysis of the concept of time was my solution.

Section 25.2
Principles of STR
363
Time cannot be absolutely deﬁned, and there is an inseparable relation between time
and signal velocity. With this new concept, I could resolve all the diﬃculties completely
for the ﬁrst time.
Within ﬁve weeks the special theory of relativity was completed. I did not doubt that
the new theory was reasonable from a philosophical point of view.. . . This is the way
the special theory of relativity was created.
Einstein based his entire theory of relativity on a few simple and appealing principles.
His STR follows from two principles which we state immediately and discuss in detail later:
Principles of STR.
Box 25.2.1. (The two principles of relativity:)
1. The laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers. Therefore, it is im-
possible to detect the (absolute) uniform motion of an RF through measurements
done entirely in that RF.
2. The speed of light in empty space is the same for all observers irrespective of their
motion or the motion of the source.
The word “uniform” describing the motion in the ﬁrst principle is important. If the
motion becomes nonuniform (accelerated), then it is possible to detect it through measure-
ments done entirely in the RF. An airplane that is cruising smoothly with constant velocity
does not “feel” to be moving, i.e., its motion cannot be detected internally (without looking
outside to see the clouds move underneath). However, as soon as the plane enters a region

of rough weather, its uniform motion turns nonuniform, and the passengers can “feel” the
motion of the plane without looking outside: acceleration can be detected, uniform velocity
cannot.
What do you know? 25.3. You are in a spaceship in empty space away from all
stars and planets. (a) Can you tell if you are moving or not? (b) What if you look out
your window and see something pass by your spaceship; can you now tell if you are
moving?
The second principle is the direct result of Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory. In choosing

between the law of addition of velocity and EM theory, Einstein picked the latter and
came up with his second principle of relativity. He based his choice on theoretical grounds
only. At the time that he postulated the STR he was not familiar with the Michelson-
Morley experiment. The theoretical reasoning—at least in his mind—was strong enough to
warrant the second postulate. Let us examine some of the most immediate consequences
ﬁrst, leaving the more dramatic ones for later sections.
The ﬁrst principle is really a generalization of Galileo’s observation concerning the laws of
mechanics. In his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems-Ptolemaic and Coper-
nican, Galileo discusses many aspects of motion through three main characters, Salviati,
Sagredo, and Simplicio.
Salviati expresses Galileo’s own views, namely the Copernican
viewpoint; Sagredo defends Aristotle and Ptolemy; and Simplicio is a neutral listener. In
one of the chapters of the book, called the Second Day, the three are discussing the motion
of a projectile and how it would appear if thrown on a ship. They also compare the ﬂight
of a projectile and that of a bird. In an attempt to explain the diﬀerences and similarities
of all such motions, Galileo lays down the Galilean Principle of Relativity.. Listen!

Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship,
and have with you there some ﬂies, butterﬂies, and other small ﬂying animals. Have a

Birth of Relativity
large bowl of water with some ﬁsh in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop
into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the
little animals ﬂy with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The ﬁsh swim indiﬀerently
in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something
to your friend, you need throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the
distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every
direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though there is no doubt
that when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship
proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not ﬂuctuating
this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the eﬀects named,
nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In
jumping, you will pass on the ﬂoor the same spaces as before, nor will you make larger
jumps toward the stern than toward the bow even though the ship is moving quite
rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the ﬂoor under
you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump. In throwing something to your
companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction
of the bow or the stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before
into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops
are in the air the ship runs many spans. The ﬁsh in their water will swim toward the
front of their bowl with no more eﬀort than toward the back, and will go with equal
ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally the butterﬂies and
ﬂies will continue their ﬂights indiﬀerently toward every side, nor will it ever happen
that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the
course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by
keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning some incense, it will
be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and moving no more
toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences of eﬀects is the
fact that the ship’s motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air
also ...
In Galileo’s time physics consisted of rudiments of mechanics. His conclusions applied
only to motion of birds, ﬂies, cannon balls, etc. Einstein, on the other hand, possessed New-
ton’s mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetism. Therefore, his ﬁrst principle of relativity
has more far-reaching consequences than Galileo’s. In fact, the ﬁrst principle of relativity
suggests the second! To see this, imagine performing all the important electromagnetic
experiments and drawing all the important conclusions, including Maxwell’s equations, in
another reference frame, a moving laboratory (such as one on a train). The scientists in
this laboratory, inspired by Maxwell’s theory, will produce electromagnetic waves and con-
clude that, in empty space, they travel at 300,000 km/s. The ﬁrst principle now implies
that the production of electromagnetic waves, and thus their speed, must be independent
of the reference frame. Therefore, the speed of these waves, including light, must be frame-
independent. This is the second principle of relativity.
25.2.1
Inertial Frames
The word “inertial” in the ﬁrst principle needs some clariﬁcation. Imagine sitting in the
cafeteria of a moving train sipping on your cup of coﬀee. All of a sudden you notice a
“jerk” pushing you in your chair and shaking your coﬀee cup in its saucer. You know the
reason behind this sudden jerk: the train track must have had some bumps, causing the
“smooth” motion of the train to turn jolty. In the language of physics we say that the
train initially had a constant velocity but the bumps on the track caused a change in this
constant velocity. In other words, the bumps caused an acceleration of the train, and this
acceleration was “transferred” to you and your coﬀee cup.
The second law of motion states that the acceleration of an object is caused by forces
acting on it. Are there any forces acting on you and the coﬀee cup when the train moves
over a bump on its track? You may say that the bump pushes the train up (or down), and

Section 25.2
Principles of STR
365
this force is transferred to the chair, on which you are sitting and the table, on which your
coﬀee cup is standing. Then the chair and the table, being in contact with you and your
coﬀee cup, physically exert forces on you and your coﬀee cup. It appears that there are
indeed physically real forces involved.
BIOGRAPHY
Albert Einstein (1879–1955) began his schooling in Munich.
At age 15 he entered the Luitpold
Gymnasium.
He studied mathematics, in particular the calculus, beginning around 1891.
In 1895
Einstein failed the entrance examination to Eidgen¨ossische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, where he
planned to study electrical engineering. As a preparation for the ETH in Zurich, he attended secondary
school at Aarau. This helped Einstein get into ETH, from which he graduated in 1900 as a teacher
of mathematics and physics. Three of Einstein’s fellow students, including Marcel Grossmann, a noted
mathematician who later introduced Einstein to diﬀerential geometry (an essential tool for general
theory of relativity), were appointed assistants at ETH in Zurich but not Einstein. By mid 1901 he had
a temporary job as a high school teacher. In 1902 Grossmann’s father landed Einstein a job as a clerk
at the patent oﬃce in Bern, where he worked until 1909. It was here that Einstein, in his spare time,
completed his papers on relativity, photoelectric eﬀect, and the Brownian motion, without the beneﬁt
of close contact with the scientiﬁc community.
Now suppose you have just boarded the train, and as you are trying to ﬁnd your seat,
the train starts to accelerate. In order to prevent yourself from falling you grab the bar
on top of your seat. Again, you feel a force, and trying to ﬁnd the source of this force,
you note that the train is experiencing a force (traction) due to the track, and this force
is transferred to you because your feet are in contact with the ﬂoor of the train: it is like
somebody is grabbing your feet and is pulling them, causing you to go oﬀbalance.
So far, you can understand the jerk and the fall from the second law of motion and
the actual forces acting on you. Now suppose you get on the train early and go directly
to the “game room.” You are standing by one of the air-puck tables, and notice a strange
phenomenon: as the train starts to accelerate (and you start to fall) the puck on the table
starts to move in the direction opposite to the train’s motion. How do you explain this
motion? There is no friction (or traction)1 between the puck and the table! There is no
real force causing the backward acceleration of the puck. That is why such a force is called
Fictitious force in

a ﬁctitious force. Whenever an object is in an accelerated RF, it experiences a ﬁctitious
force.
What do you know? 25.4. In some amusement parks, you get on a ride which is
a cylindrical enclosure. You stand by the wall. The cylinder starts rotating faster and
faster. You stick to the cylindrical wall so hard that when the ﬂoor is removed, you
don’t fall. How can you explain this?
We can now deﬁne an inertial RF: A reference frame is inertial if no ﬁctitious forces
exist in it. In such an RF, an isolated object will not change its motion unless a (real) force
acts on it, i.e., the ﬁrst law of motion holds in this RF. We, therefore, deﬁne an inertial
frame as follows:
Inertial frame and the
ﬁrst law of motion.
Box 25.2.2. An inertial frame is an RF in which Newton’s ﬁrst law holds: Isolated
objects will continue their state of rest, or their motion on a straight line with constant
speed, indeﬁnitely.
1There is a little friction, but, following Galileo’s footsteps in his discovery of the ﬁrst law, we can
imagine reducing this friction further and further, until it is completely absent (in an ideal setting).

Chapter 25
Birth of Relativity
Let us call two RFs relatively inertial if one of them moves with constant velocity
relative to the other. It is not hard to convince oneself (see Example D.25.1 on page 44
of Appendix.pdf ) that if RF1 is an inertial frame and RF2 is a second frame inertial relative
to RF1, then RF2 is also inertial, i.e., Newton’s ﬁrst law holds in RF2. Therefore, if we can
ﬁnd one ﬁducial inertial frame, we can construct unlimited numbers of them by setting in
uniform motion cars, trains, spaceships, etc., relative to the ﬁducial frame. Whether such
a ﬁducial frame exists or not is not answered by the special theory of relativity which is
concerned with the consequences of the principles of relativity assuming such a frame exists.
We shall come back to this question when we take up the general theory of relativity.
25.2.2
Law of Addition of Velocities and Second Principle
The second principle is most intriguing. To grasp how extraordinary this principle is, we
compare it with a familiar experience. Consider a train moving with a speed of 60 mph
to the right. Inside the train stands a passenger holding a gun which ﬁres a bullet with a
speed of 180 mph. This means that the passenger measures the speed of the bullet relative
to the gun—and himself—to be 180 mph. If the gun is aimed in the direction of motion
of the train what do we (standing on the ground) measure the speed of the bullet to be?
Let us look at the situation a minute after the bullet is ﬁred. Since the train is moving at
60 mph, the passenger moves a distance of 1 mile. Since the bullet is moving at 180 mph
relative to the passenger, its distance from him will be 3 miles a minute later. So we, on
the ground, see the bullet move a distance of 4 miles in one minute. We thus conclude that
the speed of the bullet must be 240 mph, the sum of the two speeds. This is the Newtonian
law of addition of velocities which we also discussed in Section 25.1.
If we denote the velocity of the bullet relative to the passenger by vbp, that of the
passenger relative to the ground by vpg, and the velocity of the bullet relative to the ground
by vbg, then we get a relation identical to Equation (25.1). And, in general, for any three
objects a, b, and c in motion, we have (note the order of indices)
vca = vcb + vba.
(25.2)
Example 25.2.3. Car A passes us at 65 mph. Immediately, we get in our car B and chase it at
60 mph.
Q: What is the speed of car A relative to our car?
A: Both values of speed given above are relative to the ground G. So, we have vAG = 65 mph
and vBG = 60 mph. Equation (25.2) now yields vAG = vAB + vBG, or 65 = vAB + 60, yielding
vAB = 5 mph. Thus, the speed of the car has been cut considerably relative to us. This is, of
course, because we have (partially) caught up with the car.
Q: What happens if our car reaches 65 mph?
A: In this case, we have 65 = vAB + 65, or vAB = 0. This means that A appears motionless
relative to us. If two cars go at the same speed, the distance between them remains unchanged so
the passengers in either car will detect no relative motion.
If our car goes at 70 mph, then 65 = vAB + 70, or vAB = −5 mph. The negative sign means
that the velocity of car A relative to car B is in the opposite direction to the other velocities. Thus,
car B will be approaching car A. This is again what we expect: If we go faster than the car in
front of us, that car appears to be approaching us backwards.

What do you know? 25.5. Suppose you travel at the speed of light. You look at a
light beam (or a spot on it). The beam should appear stationary to you, as the second
question of Example 25.2.3 indicates. So what happens to the second postulate?
The example above and the discussion preceding it illustrate the law of addition of
velocities in Newtonian physics which perfectly agrees with common sense. Now, let us

analyze the second principle of relativity in this context. Replace the train with a super
fast spaceship and the gun with a ﬂashlight. Assume that the spaceship travels at 200,000
km/s.
What is the speed of the light emitted by the ﬂashlight relative to us, on the
ground? Newtonian physics, and common sense, says that it should be 200, 000+300, 000 =
500, 000 km/s. The second postulate says that it is 300,000 km/s!
To tickle our common sense a little more, let’s assume that we see a light beam passing
us at 300,000 km/s. Immediately, we get on our super fast spaceship and chase the beam
with a speed of 299,000 km/s. Newtonian physics (and common sense) tells us that the
speed of the light beam relative to us must be 300, 000−299, 000 = 1000 km/s. The second

second principle.
postulate says that even though we are chasing the light beam with a speed of 299,000 km/s,
as we measure the speed of the light beam just ahead of us, we ﬁnd it to be 300,000 km/s!
Incredible, strange, impossible, you say. Incredible? Yes. Strange and impossible? No.
Nature is not strange.
We are!
There is nothing less strange and impossible than a proven law of nature. In fact, it is we
that are strange, judging a perfectly normal nature (after all, what is more normal than
nature itself?) by our crude senses and declaring the imperfections we perceive through
them as “normal” and “possible”.
What do you know? 25.6. A beam of light L and a super fast spaceship S start at he
same time according to observer B. S travels at 299,000 km/s, and L at 300,000 km/s.
After one second, B measures the distance of L from her, and ﬁnds that it is 300,000 km.
She measures the distance of S from her, and ﬁnds that it is 299,000 km. She concludes
that L is only 1000 km ahead of S. How can S say that L is moving at 300,000 km/s?
There have been many direct and indirect veriﬁcations of the second principle starting
with the discovery of the aberration in the seventeenth century, passing through the null
experiments of Michelson and Morley, and ending with the most recent astronomical ob-
servations. There is absolutely no evidence to the contrary. Light always travels with the
same speed in vacuum irrespective of the motion of its source and detector. No matter how
“strange” and “impossible” this may seem, we have to accept it and make it our starting
point, our pillar upon which to build all our theories. And if we ﬁnd “strange” phenomena
in these theories, such as the relativity of time and space, slowing down of time in moving
RFs, equivalence of mass and energy, etc., we must accept them and let only objective and
precise experimentation be the ultimate judge of these strange phenomena.

Relativity of Simultaneity
Before discussing the relativity of simultaneous “events” we need an operational deﬁnition
of simultaneity. Events are the most essential building blocks of relativity. Although it is

hard to deﬁne an event without circular logic, it is an intuitively obvious notion. For our
purposes, an event is any abrupt physical phenomenon that can be recorded. In particular,
one can talk about the position of an event and its time of occurrence. An event is relativity’s
equivalent of a point in geometry. Examples of events are explosion of a ﬁrecracker, take-oﬀ
of a space shuttle, collision of two particles, emission of a light signal, turning on a switch,
birth of a child, and death of a salesman. In our discussion we always deal with ideal events,
i.e., those which do not have any extension either in time or in space. Thus, the explosion of
a supernova, as seen from the Earth, is a good approximation to an ideal event, but as seen
from a nearby star it is not ideal because the exploding star goes through some preliminary
stages before preparing itself for the ﬁnal act of explosion. The most convenient deﬁnition
of an ideal event is the following:
Event deﬁned.

Box 25.3.1. An event is described by a single point in space and a single instant in
time.
We note that all observers agree on a single ideal event.
In other words, if a physical
phenomenon is stamped as an event by one observer, then it is stamped as an event by all
observers. As a prototype of events, we consider the explosion of a ﬁrecracker in the sequel.
Our next consideration centers around the notion of simultaneity. How do we deter-

mine whether two events are simultaneous or not? Firecrackers A and B explode somewhere
in space and we receive the signals of their explosions. Question: Did the explosions occur
at the same time? If A and B were at the same point when they exploded, it is easy to
answer this question: If we receive their light signals at the same time, they must have oc-
curred at the same time [Figure 25.3(a)]. Note that because of the special property of light,
this conclusion is independent of the state of motion of the ﬁrecrackers: A and B could be
moving at very high speeds in arbitrary directions at the time they reach the common point
in the ﬁgure.
What if A and B are not located at the same point? Figure 25.3(b) shows the line

segment AB and its perpendicular bisector PQ.2 If the observer happens to be on PQ and
receives the two light signals at the same time, he can conclude that they must have occurred
at the same time. Again, due to the invariance of light speed, this deﬁnition of simultaneity is
independent of the state of motion of A, B, and the observer. Thus, to conclude whether two
events separated in space are simultaneous, we must locate ourselves on their perpendicular
bisector and see if we receive the light—really electromagnetic—signals at the same time.
If we are oﬀperpendicular bisector, we must allow for the diﬀerence in the travel time of
light signals.
Example 25.3.2. Assume that the line segment AB of Figure 25.4 is 300,000 km and AO is
150,000 km.
2Recall that the perpendicular bisector of a line segment has the property that all its points are equidis-
tant from the two end points of the line segment.

Section 25.3

Q: Under what conditions can we conclude that events A and B are simultaneous?
A: Clearly, if O receives the two signals at the same time, she cannot conclude that A and B
are simultaneous, because the light signal from B must have traveled an extra 300,000 km before
reaching A and accompanying the signal from A. So, if O receives the two signals at the same
time, she must conclude that B occurred before A. If the two signals did occur at the same time,
then O must receive the signal from A ﬁrst and then—precisely one second later—the signal from
B.
■
The example above illustrates that the simultaneous reception of signals from two events
does not imply that the two events occurred at the same time. To facilitate the understand-
ing of simultaneity, let us assume that, for each pair of events, every reference frame has a
designated observer Odes, who happens to be equidistant from that given pair. Then, we

reference frame.
can deﬁne simultaneity as follows:
Box 25.3.3. A pair of events A and B are simultaneous in a reference frame (RF)
if the designated observer of that RF receives the light signal from A and B at the same
time.
The signiﬁcance of light signals used in the deﬁnition of simultaneity can be appreciated
by looking at events A and B which occur in moving reference frames. Suppose we use
bullets instead of light signals.
Karl and Emmy are standing on two trains parked next to each other at point C a
distance of 300 m from James. They ﬁre bullets—moving at 100 m/s toward James—from
their riﬂes simultaneously. Three seconds later, James sees the bullets pass by him together.
He concludes that the two events of ﬁring the bullets must have occurred simultaneously
because he knows that the two riﬂes were practically at the same location and the speed of
the bullets were equal.
Now suppose that Karl is moving away from James at 50 m/s, while Emmy is moving
towards James at 50 m/s. When they reach C at the same time, they ﬁre bullets towards
James. Emmy’s bullet has a speed of 150 m/s while Karl’s bullet speed is 50 m/s. So, al-
though ﬁred simultaneously, Emmy’s bullet reaches James in 2 seconds while Karl’s reaches
him in 6 seconds, and he cannot conclude that the two events occurred simultaneously. The
motion of the riﬂes has aﬀected the speed of the bullets relative to James. Light does not
have this problem, because the speed of light is not aﬀected by the motion of its source.
If Karl and Emmy were moving at half the speed of light in opposite directions, the light
signals they emit at C will reach James at exactly the same time. That is why the very
notion of simultaneity is so intricately tied to the speed of light.
What do you know? 25.7. In the discussion above, suppose that Karl and Emmy
move at 200 m/s (in opposite directions, of course). How long does it take Emmy’s
bullet to reach James? How about Karl’s bullet?
25.3.1
Simultaneity without Relative Motion
Having deﬁned the notion of simultaneity, we can now ask: If the designated observer
Odes sees events A and B as simultaneous, does another observer O perceive them as
simultaneous? If Odes and O do not move relative to one another, i.e., if both are in the
same RF, the answer is yes, and here is why. Being aware that he is not equidistant from
the two events, O knows that he cannot rely on the simultaneous reception of the signals.
He, therefore, must turn to the designated observer for help.
Suppose Odes has a (very accurate) watch that emits a light signal every second. Any
other observer, including O, at a ﬁxed distance from Odes, will receive those signals every

second, because each signal has exactly the same distance to travel. Therefore, O’s clock
can be compared and made to run at exactly the same rate as the clock held by Odes, and
vice versa. In particular, Odes can send a coded message to O at the exact “second” that
she receives the two simultaneous signals from events A and B, informing O that those two
events occurred at the same time.
All clocks of an RF can
be made to run at the
same rate and be
synchronized.
Furthermore, all clocks of the RF can be completely synchronized. Here is how to do it.
Let us call clock C the reference clock. This is the most accurate clock available. In fact,
we assume it is so accurate that we can call it an ideal clock.3 We can then synchronize
all other clocks with C. How do we do this, if other clocks are located far, very far—light
years—away from C? By light signals! An operator at C can synchronize any clock C′ as
follows. First she determines the distance between C and C′ by measuring the time interval
between sending a light signal to C′ and receiving the reﬂected echo at C. Denoting this
time interval by T, she determines the distance between C and C′ to be Tc/2. For instance,
if T is 2 seconds, the distance is 300,000 km.
Once the distance between C′ and C is determined, the operator can send a code at
12:00 containing the sentence “As soon as you receive this signal, set your time to 12:00
plus T/2!” Then the operator at C′ can follow the order, setting his time to be exactly the
same as C. This is what takes place at the Earth’s RF.4 All clocks are set to Greenwich
Mean Time. However, since it would be fatuous for the residents of Tokyo to be forced to
call it 12:00 noon when everywhere is dark, the synchronization of the Earth clocks follows
a more democratic rule by incorporating the geographic location in the process.
It is crucial to note that the synchronization procedure is applicable because all clocks
are stationary relative to one another. As we shall see, relative motion between two clocks
aﬀects their operation. Theoretically, one can synchronize all the ideal clocks of a single
RF to tick in perfect harmony. We summarize the foregoing discussion as
Box 25.3.4. All observers in a single RF keep the same time and agree on the notion
of simultaneity.
25.3.2
Simultaneity with Relative Motion
What happens to simultaneity when two RFs move relative to one another? To investigate
this question, let us get back on our train and consider two ﬁrecrackers at its two ends.
Karl is on the ground and Emmy stands at the midpoint of the train. Suppose that the
3An ideal clock never runs fast or slow.
Such a clock does not exist, of course, but atomic clocks
approximate this ideal clock to a very high degree of accuracy.
4Strictly speaking, not all residents of Earth have the same RF because of the Earth’s spin: People in
China and the US move in opposite directions! But such a diﬀerence in speed is so much smaller than the
speed of light that we can ignore it.

Figure 25.5: Diﬀerent observers disagree on the simultaneity of two events. The ground observer (Karl)
sees the two events as simultaneous, while the train observer (Emmy) does not. The marks labeled A′ and
B′ are left on the ground by the explosion of the ﬁrecrackers A and B, respectively. These marks are as
seen by Karl. To see how these same marks appear to Emmy, refer to Figure 25.7(a).
ﬁrecrackers produce smoke that can leave permanent marks on the platform. Suppose also
that Karl ﬁnds himself right in the middle of these two marks. Finally, assume that he
receives the signals from A and B at the same time. Figure 25.5 shows the situation as seen
by Karl. The top ﬁgure is the moment the explosions occur.5 The middle ﬁgure shows the
wave fronts moving away from their sources. Note that Emmy has received the signal from
B, and that the two wave fronts are equidistant from Karl and from the positions of the
ﬁrecrackers at the time of explosions (i.e., positions of A and B in the top ﬁgure). Finally,
in the bottom ﬁgure the two wave fronts have reached Karl while Emmy is still waiting for
the signal from A.
After receiving the two signals simultaneously, Karl walks to A′ counting his steps, walks
to B′ counting his steps, notices that the two distances are equal, and concludes that events
A and B were simultaneous. What about Emmy? After receiving the two signals, she
measures her distance from A and B and veriﬁes that she was halfway between them. She
therefore concludes that B must deﬁnitely have occurred before A.
This discussion brings out the essence of the relativity of simultaneity. What Newto-
nian mechanics, and common sense, thought obvious and self understood, is dramatically
undermined by the scrutiny of relativity principles. There is no escape from this! Once we
accept the principles of relativity, in particular the invariance of the speed of light, we have
to face the (initial) discomfort of the realization that simultaneity is not universal.
Although simultaneity of two events is not universal, the fact that Karl sees A and B as
simultaneous, is. Not only does he say “A and B are simultaneous for me,” but also Emmy
and all other observers in the universe say “A and B are simultaneous for Karl” despite
the fact that they themselves do not see A and B at the same time. This notion can be
further clariﬁed by assuming that Karl is equipped with a special ﬁrecracker C that he can
trigger when the two signals reach him at the same time. Thus, the explosion of C heralds
the simultaneity of A and B as seen by Karl, and all observers keeping an eye on C can
conclude that Karl saw A and B at the same time (if they see the single explosion of C) or
not (if they don’t see the explosion of C).
The preceding discussion may have given the reader the impression that Karl is being

treated as special because he is the one who sees the two events simultaneously. To erase
any impression of such special treatment, let us give Emmy the “honor” of observing the
two events at the same time. Figure 25.6 shows the situation as seen by Emmy. The top
ﬁgure is the moment the explosions occur.6 The middle ﬁgure shows the wave fronts moving
away from their sources. Note that Karl has received the signal from A, and that the two
wave fronts are equidistant from Emmy and from the positions of the ﬁrecrackers. Finally,
in the bottom ﬁgure the two wave fronts have reached Emmy while Karl is still waiting for
the signal from B. As before, after receiving the two signals, Karl and Emmy measure their
distances from A and B (or their marks on the platform) and verify that they were both
halfway between them. Emmy concludes that the two events occurred simultaneously while
Karl decides that A must have occurred before B.
Box 25.3.5. Simultaneity is a relative phenomenon. If one observer sees two events as
simultaneous, other observers moving relative to the ﬁrst, in general, do not. However,
the fact that a given observer sees two events as simultaneous (or not) is universal.
25.4
Relativity of Length
The relativity of simultaneity has an immediate consequence, another counter-intuitive
result. The discussion of the last section led to an apparent paradox. It is clear that A and
B are located at the two ends of the train in Figure 25.5, with Emmy in the middle. Karl
can see the two ends of the train coincide with the ﬁrecracker marks on the ground. So, he
is puzzled: Why doesn’t Emmy receive the signals at the same time? After all, each signal
has to travel half the length of the train to reach Emmy. And surely, Emmy doesn’t see a
diﬀerent length for the train than Karl! Or does she?
Before scrutinizing the eﬀect of motion on length, we need to know how to measure the
length of an object when it moves. We could jump on the object and use a tape measure.
But this would be the same as measuring the length of the object when it does not move,
because motion is relative and when you are on the object, the object is not moving relative
to you. You can’t use a tape measure while the object is moving: put the head of the tape

measure at the front of the object when it reaches you; but by the time you get to the end
of the object, it has moved from where it was when you started the measurement. This
should tell you that, somehow you must put the head and the tail of the tape measure
simultaneously at the two ends of the object in motion. One way to do this is to have two
events occur simultaneously at the two ends of the object, and make sure that those events
leave permanent marks in your reference frame. The distance between these two marks,
which you can measure at your leisure, is the length of the object.
25.4.1
Contraction of Length along Motion Path
Look at the events of Figure 25.5 from Emmy’s point of view. Further assume that we
are repeating the exact same experiment. So, there are already black marks on the ground
from the previous experiment, and we perform the experiment with blue smoke. Emmy
is standing in the middle of the train, anticipating the occurrence of B. She eventually
receives the signal from B and concludes that a fraction of a second earlier the front end
of the train must have coincided with the black mark at B′. Immediately she looks back,
and since the signal from A has not arrived yet, she concludes that the rear end of the train
has not reached the mark on the ground yet. She, therefore, perceives a picture shown in
Figure 25.7(a), and concludes that the train is longer than the distance between the ground
marks! This conclusion is an inescapable consequence of the relativity of simultaneity which
in turn is a result of the second principle.
It seems that Karl and Emmy are in disagreement concerning the length of the train.
Karl’s measure of the length of the train is shorter than Emmy’s. Could it be that their
contradicting conclusions are due to the fact that Karl saw the two events simultaneously?
That if Emmy sees the two events at the same time the conclusions will be reversed? To
see this, let us conduct the (double) experiment in which Emmy sees the explosion of the
ﬁrecrackers simultaneously, as shown in Figure 25.6. Karl is standing in the middle of the
two marks on the platform, anticipating the occurrence of A. He eventually receives the
signal from A and concludes that a fraction of a second earlier the rear end of the train
must have coincided with the black mark at A′′. Immediately he looks to his right, and
since the signal from B has not arrived yet, he concludes that the front end of the train
has not reached the mark on the ground yet. He, therefore, perceives a picture shown in
Figure 25.7(b), and decides that the train is shorter than the distance between the ground
marks! It does not matter who sees the two events at the same time; the train is shorter
for Karl.
Is there anything special about the train? Is it because it is moving and the platform is
not? But wait! It can’t be, because motion is relative; to Emmy it is the platform that is
moving, and if relativity is correct, lengths on the platform should appear shorter to Emmy.
Let’s see if this is indeed the case.
Place the ﬁrecrackers on the platform instead of the train and let Emmy and Karl
measure the distance between them.
Since our preceding discussions have shown that
the distance measurement (whether it is shorter or longer) is independent of who sees the
explosions simultaneously, let us assume that Emmy, riding on the train, sees the ﬁrecrackers
explode simultaneously. Karl, on the other hand, receives the signal from A before that
from B. Figure 25.8 explains this situation.
As usual, assume that an identical experiment has been done before, and it is now being
repeated.
So, there are already black marks on the train from the previous explosions
indicating the distance between the ﬁrecrackers as measured by Emmy. Karl is standing in
the middle of the two ﬁrecrackers on the platform, anticipating the occurrence of A. He
eventually receives the signal from A and concludes that a fraction of a second earlier the
black mark closer to the rear end of the train must have coincided with A. Immediately he
looks to the front, and since the signal from B has not arrived yet, he concludes that the
mark closer to the front end of the train has not reached B yet. He, therefore, decides that

the distance between the two ﬁrecrackers on the platform is larger than the marks on the
train. Therefore, Emmy measures the distance between A and B to be less than what Karl
measures.
Note the symmetry between the two observers. Neither is any more special than the
other. Both are claiming that lengths measured in their RF are longer than the moving
lengths.7 In other words, they both conclude that moving lengths shrink.
Moving lengths shrink.
And the shrinkage is not due to some kind of a mechanical compression of the train
or the platform (or cars, trucks, planes, or meter sticks). The two ends of a stick merely
indicate two points in space. It is this distance that is shrinking. Thus, motion aﬀects the
space itself. For instance, these two points could be the locations of two stars. As seen from
Earth, these two stars, say the Sun and Alpha Centauri, which are almost ﬁxed relative to
the Earth’s RF, are seen to be about 4 light years away from one another. The crew of a
spaceship, traveling at very high speed towards Alpha Centauri, sees this distance shrunk
because, to them, the length between the Sun and alpha centauri is in motion. We shall see
some striking examples of such space travels in Chapter 26 where we quantify the shrinkage
of lengths.
25.4.2
Length Transverse to Motion Path
All the contractions treated so far occur for lengths that are along the path of motion.
Would the same eﬀect occur if the length moved perpendicular to itself? We ask Karl and
Emmy to help us ﬁgure this out. Karl gets into a spaceship while Emmy climbs to the top
of a mountain. We give each a long stick at the end of which are two lights, which are oﬀ
for now. Karl’s lights are red; Emmy’s green. We instruct each to hold his/her rod ﬁrmly
in the middle8 and make sure that it remains perpendicular to the path of motion, and we
arrange the altitude of the spaceship in such a way that the midpoints of the rods coincide
at the moment that Karl passes Emmy [see Figure 25.9(a)]. The rods are equipped with
a trigger device that turns the lights on and oﬀright at the moment that they pass each
other. We now use the ﬁrst principle of relativity and simple logic to conclude that neither
rod shrinks.
Suppose that Emmy saw a shrinkage of Karl’s rod. Then the red lights would be in
between the green lights; and since her rod is covering Karl’s rod, she would not see the red
7Remember that it is the platform that is moving relative to Emmy!
8To be precise, the middle of the rod should be at the level of his/her eyes (detectors of the light ﬂashes).

ﬂashes. But she would not be alone in seeing this situation. Since the two rods coincide
instantaneously as they pass each other, everybody in the universe that happens to (be
behind Emmy and) see the event, would see the ephemeral green ﬂashes. Thus, Emmy
concludes that everybody in the universe (at least, everybody behind her) should see only
two green ﬂashes as shown in Figure 25.9(b).
So far so good! But now we invoke the ﬁrst principle of relativity: if Emmy concludes
that moving lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion shrink, Karl has to come to the
same conclusion. So, he sees Emmy’s rod moving, and expects it to shrink. His experience
will be that the green ﬂashes will occur between the red ﬂashes, and if his experience were to
materialize, he would conclude that everybody in the universe behind Emmy should see two
green ﬂashes between two red ﬂashes as shown in Figure 25.9(c). But this is impossible. The
same universal observers cannot reach two diﬀerent conclusions for the same experiment.
We have to conclude that neither rod changes its length due to its motion. Let’s summarize
our observation in the last two subsections as:
Only lengths parallel to
motion shrink.
Box 25.4.1. All moving lengths parallel to the direction of motion shrink. The lengths
perpendicular to the direction of motion are not aﬀected by the motion.
Example 25.4.2. A circle in motion will appear as an ellipse, because the diameter parallel to

the direction of motion will shrink while the diameter perpendicular to the direction of motion will
remain unchanged. Similarly, a square moving parallel to one of its sides appears as a rectangle.
If the square moves along one of its diagonals, it will appear as a rhombus. Don’t expect to see
a change in the shape of a circle or a square by holding them in your hand and whizzing them in
front of your face! The change in the shape is noticeable only if the circle and the square move
with speeds close to light speed (see Example 26.2.1 in Chapter 26).
■
It is instructive to analyze the eﬀect of motion on a length parallel to the motion path
with a length perpendicular to the path in terms of simultaneity. In the former case, the
arrival time of the light signal coming from diﬀerent sources depends on the observer. If
one observer receives the two signals at the same time the other observer does not; and
the reason for this asymmetry is that the motion of one of the observers is towards one

source and away from the other (see Figures 25.5 and 25.6). However, in the perpendicular
case, both observers (really, their eyes) are equidistant from the two sources at all times,
regardless of their motion or the time at which the ﬂashes are sent. In other words, since
both observers always remain on the perpendicular bisector of both rods, they both receive
the signals of the two events simultaneously. Therefore, they have to conclude that the two
lengths are equal.

Answers to “What do you know?”
25.1.
In the forward direction, the two speeds are in the same direction. Therefore they
add to give 260 mph for the speed of the bullets relative to the bystanders. In the backward
direction, the two speeds are in opposite directions. Therefore they subtract to give 140 mph
for the speed of the bullets relative to the bystanders.
25.2.
Write Equation (25.1) as v1g = v12 + v2g and note that v1g = 70 mph and v2g =
60 mph to get v12 = 10 mph. This means that car 1 appears to be moving at 10 mph
relative to car 2.
25.3. (a) No. No matter where you look, you see darkness in empty space with ﬂickering
starlight in the background. (b) Still, no! All you can say now is that something is moving
relative to you, or you relative to it.
25.4. The cylinder has a centripetal acceleration. So there must be a ﬁctitious force in the
opposite direction, i.e., towards the cylindrical wall. This force causes you to stick to the
wall and not fall down.
25.5.
Since the second postulate seems to be violated, it must be impossible to move at
the speed of light! Later, when we consider relativistic energies in Chapter 28, you’ll see
that it requires inﬁnite amount of energy (or fuel) to accelerate an object to the speed of
light.
25.6.
As you will discover later in this and in the next chapter, both time and distance
are relative concepts. One second for B is not one second for S, and 1000 km for B is not
1000 km for S. When S measures the distance and the travel time of L, he ﬁnds that L is
moving at 300,000 km/s according to him!
25.7.
Since Emmy is moving towards James, the bullet’s speed is the sum of the two
speeds, i.e., 300 m/s. So, the bullet reaches James in one second. The speed of Karl’s bullet

is the diﬀerence between the two speeds, i.e., 100 m/s away from James. So, Karl’s bullet
never reaches James!

that a second later Karl has moved 250,000 km horizontally and the light beam 300,000 km
vertically. So, to her the light path is the hypotenuse of a right triangle of sides 250,000 km
and 300,000 km. Is the light beam, which covers this hypotenuse in one second, going faster

Chapter26
Relativity of Time and Space
The qualitative discussions of the last chapter made it clear that motion aﬀects time and
space. This chapter investigates these eﬀects quantitatively and determines the extent to
which motion aﬀects the working of clocks and rulers, and addresses the question of whether
we have to correct our watches or adjust our height every time we hop in and out of a car.
26.1
Time Dilation
As Einstein said “Time is what is measured by clocks.” So, let us look at the eﬀect of
motion on clocks. And by the “eﬀect of motion” we do not mean the eﬀects of the bumps
and puddles of a rough road which may actually damage a clock. We have in mind the
smoothest possible ride such as the sailing of a spaceship in outer space. Any eﬀect on
clocks must be interpreted as an eﬀect on time itself, although we may be using a particular
clock to detect the eﬀect.
The clock best suited for this investigation is the “arm” of the Michelson-Morley appa-
ratus shown in Figure 26.1. It consists of a source S of light, or electromagnetic waves, and
a mirror M. The distance between S and M is L which we can conveniently take to be, say
1.5 m. Then it takes light 1.5/3 × 108, i.e., 5 × 10−9 seconds or 5 ns (nanosecond, as nano
means 10−9) to go from S to M, and 10 ns to go to M and come back to S. If we place a light

sensitive “ticker” at S, it will tick every 10 ns. We call such a clock a Michelson-Morley
clock, or MM clock for short. Math Note E.26.1 on page 111 of Appendix.pdf compares
two such clocks which are moving relative to one another and connects the time intervals
measured by the two clocks via a simple mathematical relation, which we reproduce below:
Proper time is measured
by a clock present at the
two events.

(26.1)
where ∆τ, the proper time is the time interval between two events measured by a clock
that is present at the two events. If the clock, and therefore the observer, is present at both
events, the events must occur at the same spatial point for that observer. For example,
to the captain of a spaceship who looks at the take-oﬀfrom Earth and landing on another
planet from the window of the spaceship, these two events are taking place at the same
spatial point: the window. We can thus deﬁne proper time in two diﬀerent ways:

L
Figure 26.1: A Michelson-Morley clock. A “tick” of this clock occurs when the light signal makes a
round trip along the length L.
Box 26.1.1. The proper time interval between two events is the time measured by an
observer who is present at both events, or for whom the two events occur at the same
spatial point.
The time interval ∆t, called the coordinate time,1 is the time measured by another
observer O′, moving relative to O with speed v, for whom the two events occur at two
diﬀerent spatial points. Equation (26.1) applies to situations in which the relative velocity
of the two observers remain constant. If there is an abrupt change in the speed or the
direction of motion, we have to apply (26.1) separately to those portions of the motion in
which the velocity does not change.
The expression 1/

1 −(v/c)2, to which we assigned the symbol γ, is sometimes called

introduced.
the gamma factor. It determines whether relativistic considerations are essential or not. If
the speed v of an object is very small compared to c, then γ is very nearly 1 and relativistic
eﬀects can be ignored. On the other hand, when γ is much larger than 1, classical mechanics
fails and relativity theory must be invoked.
Before discussing (26.1) any further, notice the factor
p
1 −(v/c)2. A physical quantity
cannot be the square root of a negative number. Therefore, the expression under the radical
sign must be nonnegative: 1−(v/c)2 ≥0, i.e., v/c ≤1. We, therefore, conclude that nothing
can travel faster than light. Since objects can carry information and since information can
be interpreted as signals, we obtain the important result:
Never faster than light!
Box 26.1.2. No signal can be transmitted with a speed greater than the speed of light.
Light, of course, travels at the speed of light. Is it possible to attain this speed for
anything else? STR predicts that for any massive object, no matter how small the mass,
the answer is no. In fact, the daily activity of the accelerators (atom smashers) around
the world is a testimony to this impossibility. By providing more and more energy to an

elementary particle, these machines can accelerate the particle to higher and higher speeds,
just as the provision of fuel to the engine accelerates a car. The amount of energy delivered
to particles has grown steadily several hundred thousand times over the last few decades.
However, in no instance has a single particle been observed to have a speed greater than,
or even equal to, the speed of light. In 2000, the Large Electron Positron Collider (LEP)
at CERN was able to accelerate the electrons to a speed of 0.999999999997c, corresponding
1The strange naming of ∆t will make more sense when t becomes a coordinate in Chapter 27.

Section 26.1
Time Dilation
383
to a γ of 409000. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), also at CERN, is due to accelerate
protons to a speed of 0.999999991c corresponding to a γ of 7461.2
“But light, which Einstein himself discovered to be composed of particles (photons),
does travel at the speed of light,” you may remark, “How do you explain the speed of
photons?” In the last paragraph, we were careful to emphasize the word “massive.” It
turns out that photons are massless, and a full account of this and other energy-related
topics can be found in Chapter 28.
Equation (26.1) is at the heart of the relativity theory, and as you will see in the sequel,
almost all relativistic results are obtained from it. Before discussing the implications of this
formula, let’s look at some numerical examples.
Example 26.1.3. The captain of the Spaceship Enterprise cruising at the speed of 1.8×108 m/s
(60% speed of light, or 0.6c) wakes up at time zero (event E1), goes about doing his chores for 16
hours—according to his clock, of course—and goes to bed (event E2).
Q: How long does this appear to the Earth observers?
A: Note that ∆τ = 16 hours is the proper time, because the two events occur at the same
point in the spaceship, the bed. Stated equivalently, this time interval is measured by a clock
that is present at both events. To calculate ∆t, the time interval between E1 and E2 according
to the Earth clock, we need v/c. But we are given that v = 0.6c. Thus, v/c = 0.6 and ∆t =
16/
p
1 −(0.6)2 = 20 hrs. The Earth observers, therefore, conclude that the captain has a long
20-hour work day!

What do you know?
26.1. The gamma (or dilation) factor is 1.25 for Example
26.1.3. What is the gamma factor if the speed is 90% of light speed? How many hours
would a work day be for the captain?
Space travel beyond the closest stars may seem physically impossible. The ambition of
exploring stars hundreds of light years away appears to be futile. After all, it takes light,
the fastest object in the universe, 100 years to travel from a star that is 100 light years
away to Earth. How can the crew of a space probe, even moving inﬁnitesimally close to
the speed of light, hope to survive the journey? All members of the crew will be dead by
the time the probe reaches the star. Example D.26.1 on page 44 of Appendix.pdf shows
that, due to the relativity of time, such space travels are possible if we can achieve speeds
close to light speed.
This relativity of time intervals is called time dilation and is one of the most diﬃcult

concepts to grasp in relativity theory, because it leads to what has incorrectly come to be
known as time warp or time travel.

Length Contraction
Example D.26.2 may seem to suggest a violation of the supremacy of the speed light. It
takes light 24.63 years to travel the Earth-planet distance, yet Enterprise covers it in 5
years. Is Enterprise going faster (almost ﬁve times faster) than light? Of course not! The
key to this puzzle is in the notion of length contraction encountered before, for which Math

L = L0

γ ,
(26.2)
where γ was introduced in Equation (26.1). L0 is length measured by an observer stationary
relative to the two ends of the length; we call L0 the rest length. L is length measured by
an observer moving relative to the two ends of the length; we call L the moving length.
We see that a moving length is shrunk by a factor of
p
1 −(v/c)2 to an observer with
respect to whom the length moves with a speed v.
Length contraction can “explain” why space travel to distant stars is possible, even
though light itself may take hundreds of years to travel such distances. The point is that,
as a spaceship travels at a speed close to light speed, the distance between Earth and the
destination star becomes very short. So, the crew does not see the star 100 light years away,
but only 5 light years (if the spaceship is moving fast enough). Example D.26.3 on page
46 of Appendix.pdf provides a sample numerical detail.
Example 26.2.1. Having learned about the length contraction and having read Example 25.4.2
in Chapter 25, Emmy wants to try to make an ellipse out of a circle by moving it. First she compares
lengths diﬀering slightly from 1 meter to see how much a meter stick should shrink before she can
actually notice the diﬀerence by merely eyeballing it. She decides that she can tell the diﬀerence
between 100 cm and 95 cm by merely looking at them, i.e., if somebody showed her a meter stick
(100 cm long), and a little later a 95-cm stick, she could “remember” that the ﬁrst stick was longer.
Next, she tries to see how fast a circle with a diameter of 100 cm should move horizontally so
she could see it as a vertical ellipse. Clearly, it has to move at such a speed that the horizontal
diameter shrinks at least to 95 cm. She uses Equation (26.2) with L = 95 cm and L0 = 100 cm:
95 = 100
p
1 −(v/c)2, whose solution gives v/c = 0.312, or v = 0.312c. Plugging in 3× 108 m/s for
c, she gets v = 9.4 × 107 m/s, or 209 million mph. Little wonder we do not see people and objects
shrink as they move by us!
■
What do you know? 26.3. In the previous What do you know?, the spaceship is
moving at almost the speed of light and it takes them 2 years to get to the planet. So,
the distance from Earth to the planet is very nearly 2 light years. What is the distance
according to Earth people?
26.3
The Twin Paradox
You may very well have a feeling of uneasiness regarding time dilation, especially when the
aging process comes into consideration. Let us dwell on this topic for a while. Karl and
Emmy are twins. As soon as they are born, Karl is put on the spaceship Marinarus heading
to the star Epsilon Eridani about 11 light years away from Earth to explore its planets. The
speed of Marinarus is 0.9c. Both the ground control and the crew of the spaceship agree to
send “happy birthday” signals to the twins on each anniversary of their birth.
On the ﬁrst anniversary, the ground control sends the ﬁrst “happy birthday” signal.
They wait for a month, then 2 months, then the whole second year to receive Emmy’s
“happy birthday” message, all in vain. They send Karl his second happy birthday signal
and wait another year. Still no signal! On the third anniversary, they repeat their annual

Section 26.3
The Twin Paradox
385
message, and they urge the crew to respond.
Still no response!
Although it has given
up hope by now, the ground control nevertheless sends a “Happy Fourth, Karl!” knowing
that the message is probably aimless. Marinarus is now considered “lost in space,” but the
communication channel is left open just in case. Exactly 131 days after the fourth message
is sent the ground crew receives the signal saying “Happy ﬁrst, Emmy!” Puzzled by this
strange time warp, the ground control consults its theoretical physicist for an explanation.
His crude response is as follows: There are two kinds of time delays involved. One is the
relativistic time dilation which stretches the year in the spaceship to something more than
a year. The second is the time delay due to the travel time of the radio signal from the
spaceship to the Earth. His exact response is explained in Math Note E.26.3 on page
113 of Appendix.pdf .
How do we separate the delay due to the signal travel from the relativistic eﬀect of time
dilation? In other words, given ∆t, the total elapsed time measured by the Earth clock,
how can we separate from it γ∆τ, the dilated time? This is a relevant question because in
an actual experiment, it is the total time that is measured by the Earth clocks, and one may
be interested in the relativistic eﬀect only. The qualitative answer is discussed below. The
quantitative answer can be found in Math Note E.26.4 on page 114 of Appendix.pdf .
Let us start the qualitative explanation by recalling (see Box 25.3.4) that each reference
frame has a unique time. Therefore, instead of communicating directly to the ground con-
trol, the Marinarus crew can relay their messages to outposts located at strategic distances
from the main control room. For instance, the theoretical physicist, foreseeing the rela-
tivistic time dilation, can suggest outposts located approximately 2.065 light years apart.
These correspond to locations which Marinarus reaches just at the time that the crew sends
their annual signals. In this case, the signal will be received immediately after it leaves
the spaceship. How did the physicist come up with 2.065 light years? See the following
example.
Example 26.3.1. Where should the ﬁrst outpost be located so that the signal is received imme-
diately after it leaves the ship?
According to the Earth clock, the crew of the spaceship send their ﬁrst signal ∆t1 = γ∆τ1 =
1/
p
1 −(0.9)2 = 2.2942 years after they leave. During this time, the Earth observers measure the
distance covered by the spaceship to be
distance = (velocity)(time) = (0.9c)(2.2942 years)
= 2.06478c years = 2.06478 light years ≈2.065 light years.
Thus, an outpost located approximately at 2.065 light years, receives the signal as soon as it is
sent.
■
The usefulness of these outposts comes from their ability to record the information
immediately. Thus, when the crew of Marinarus sends the code “Happy ﬁrst, Emmy!” the
inhabitants of the outpost can immediately look at their clock and see that 2.29 years have
passed, not one year!
Is there something magical about the spaceship that keeps people young? Do we start
staying young as soon as we jump on a spaceship headed into outer space? This seems
to be contradictory to the principle of relativity which gives equal rights to all RFs. To
understand the question, let us look at the same situation this time from the point of view
of the spaceship RF. Marinarus crew see Earth receding from them at the speed of 0.9c
and after one year they send their signal and wait for the corresponding signal from the
Earth. In fact, without going any further, one can switch Earth and the spaceship, and all
their corresponding devices and people everywhere in the foregoing discussion of the trip,
and come up with the spaceship version of the journey. Thus, for instance, the crew of
Marinarus will receive the “Happy ﬁrst, Karl!” 4 years and 131 days after departure. In
each RF, the moving twin ages less.

Table 26.1: The relativisticity of familiar moving objects.
How can this be? How can both twins see the other one grow less rapidly? What if we
introduce a TV set that continually monitors the other twin? Then Emmy sees Karl as a 1
year old when she is more than 4 years old. On her 13th birthday she sees her brother as
only 3. When she is married and has a child of her own at the age of 26, the monitor shows
Karl as only 6. Finally, at the age of 91, in a retirement house where Emmy is spending
the few remaining years of her life, she hardly recognizes her brother’s face on the monitor
appearing as a young 21-year-old man.
Such a state of aﬀairs is hard to accept. What is worse, we have to accept the fact that
Karl sees on his TV screen the youthfulness of his twin sister! Yet this is precisely what the
special theory of relativity predicts. Is there no way that we can determine once and for all
who ages less? As long as the two are moving at constant speed relative to each other, no.
Both RFs conclude exactly the same thing because time is a relative physical quantity. We
are used to an absolute time because all the speeds we deal with are so small that we never
experience the dilation of time. Thus, a watch in a car, a clock in a ship, and a timer in a
plane all are treated the same as the watch on our wrist. “Wait a minute,” you may say.
“There is a way of determining whether Karl stays younger or Emmy. Bring them face to
face! Reverse the course of Marinarus on Karl’s ﬁrst birthday and bring it back to Earth.
Then, when Karl is 2 years old, he will face his twin sister. Will she be younger, as the
Marinarus crew may suspect, due to the motion of Earth clocks relative to them, or older
as the ground control may calculate due to time dilation?” Stay tuned until Chapter 27 for
the answer.
26.4
Relativisticity
All the foregoing discussions dealt with speeds approaching light speed. Now take some
ordinary vehicles and see how important relativistic eﬀects would be for them. Values of
γ corresponding to some typical speeds are given in Table 26.1, which makes it clear that
for all humanly possible speeds—even for the highest attained—the relativistic eﬀects are
extremely small. The measure of “relativisticity” is γ −1 which, for the fastest speed at-
γ −1 measures
relativisticity.
tainable, is less than four parts in 10 billion! Such a small eﬀect is not ordinarily detectable.
Math Note E.26.5 on page 115 of Appendix.pdf shows how to approximate γ −1 when
the speed of the moving object is much smaller than light speed.
What do you know? 26.4. What speed is needed to give a gamma factor of 1.0001?
Example 26.2.1 showed how hard (actually impossible) it was to shrink a meter stick
by a mere 5 cm. Take the fastest and largest man-made object, a 100-meter-long satellite
moving at 18,000 mph. How much does it shrink as it passes by? By only the length of
a molecule! It is impossible to see the diﬀerence between 100 m and another length that

diﬀers from it by the size of a molecule. What about time dilation? By how much does
a clock slow down when placed on a jet plane and kept in motion for hours? Only a few
nanoseconds! See Example D.26.4 on page 47 of Appendix.pdf for details.
Since we have been encountering the gamma factor γ on so many occasions, it is con-
venient to plot it as a function of the fractional speed v/c. Figure 26.2 shows such a plot.
It should be clear from the graph that to get a γ that is even slightly diﬀerent from 1,
you need extremely high speeds, although such speeds may be negligible compared to light
speed.

While at ultra-relativistic speeds, strange phenomena, such as a daughter getting older
than her father, are possible, even the fastest and the farthest round trip achievable today—
an Apollo mission to the Moon, for example—yields only minute fractions of a second as a
time-dilation eﬀect (see Example D.26.5 on page 47 of Appendix.pdf for details).
Examples D.26.4 and D.26.5 show that even for humanly extraordinary speeds, the
relativistic eﬀects are immeasurably small. The dramatic relativistic eﬀects of time dilation
and length contraction demonstrated in Examples D.26.2 and D.26.3 require enormous
vehicular speeds, speeds unavailable to our race now or in the near future. Stated diﬀerently,
ordinary phenomena, in which relevant speeds are much smaller than light speed, obey
classical ideas. It does not mean that relativity gives wrong results when applied to ordinary
phenomena, it just means that for ordinary phenomena the relativistic eﬀects are so small as
to be unobservable by crude measuring devices such as ordinary watches and meter sticks.
In fact, all the formulas of relativity turn into classical formulas when speeds are much
smaller than light speed. For example, if v/c is much smaller than 1, then
p
1 −v2/c2 ≈1,
and Equations (26.1) and (26.2) yield ∆τ ≈∆t and L ≈L0, respectively, as expected in
classical physics. The correspondence between the relativity theory and Newtonian physics
is stated as follows:
Box 26.4.1. All the formulas and concepts of relativity reduce to the corresponding
Newtonian formulas and concepts when all relevant speeds become much smaller than
light speed.

26.3. According to Earth, the spaceship is moving at almost the speed of light and it takes
the spaceship 44.7 years to get to the planet. So, the distance from Earth to the planet is

to 9.5 million mph! It takes a lot of speed to get anywhere near light speed!

Chapter27
Spacetime Geometry
Relativity theory abolishes the notion of absolute time and space.
An event, speciﬁed
by a location in space and an instant in time, is described diﬀerently by diﬀerent RFs.
For example, an observer on a train may say “Firecracker A, located in front of the train
exploded at noon on 1, January 2003.” The same event may be described by the observer
on the platform as “Firecracker A, exploded at 1:00 pm on 1, January 2003 while passing
the edge of the platform.” The task of this chapter is to give geometrical meaning to events
and relate the coordinates of the same event as measured by diﬀerent observers.
27.1
Space + Time = Spacetime
The most elegant way of relating an event’s space and time properties assigned by two
observers is to use geometry. But before getting into the geometry of relativity, let’s review
the ordinary (Euclidean) geometry.
A position can be “coordinatized” by three numbers corresponding to three axes. For
Review of Euclidean
geometry.
example, to specify an oﬃce in the Sears Tower, we ﬁrst give the location of the building by
specifying the north-south and east-west coordinates (two numbers),1 then give the height
(ﬂoor number). These three numbers are usually denoted by (x, y, z), where x is the east-
west coordinate (positive for east, negative for west), y the north-south coordinate (positive
for north, negative for south), and z is the up-down coordinate (positive for up, negative
for down or basement).
Abstracting the idea, we can study solid geometry by assigning three numbers to each
point. If a certain collection of points happen to lie on a geometric ﬁgure, then those points
are related via a mathematical formula. For instance, a surface is described by an equation
giving one coordinate of a general point in terms of the other two. All points in space whose
coordinates satisfy the equation lie on that surface. All curves and surfaces are determined
by equations. Thus, solid geometry turns into coordinatized or (analytic) geometry.
Many of the features of solid geometry can be derived by studying plane geometry as
is done in a typical elementary geometry course; and we shall do the same. From now on
we shall conﬁne ourselves to studying objects in a plane. Thus, as shown in Figure 27.1(a),
Solid geometry is hard;
simplify to plane
geometry.
a point is speciﬁed by only a pair of numbers (x, y). Lines and curves and other geometric
ﬁgures are objects for which x and y are related via equations. For instance, any point
whose coordinates satisfy the equation y = 2x + 3 lies on a line that has a slope of 2 and
an intercept of 3. Similarly points whose coordinates satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = 1 lie
on a circle of unit radius centered at the origin.
1These two numbers are usually replaced by a word (the name of the street) and a number (address on
the street).

A job interview at 10:00 a.m. on the 53rd ﬂoor of the Sears Tower can also be “coordi-
natized” by adding another number to (x, y, z). The interview is an event that is a union
of a spatial point and an instant in time; it is described by a set of four numbers (x, y, z, t).
Geometrically, we have added the extra “dimension” of time to the three-dimensional space
to create the four-dimensional spacetime. If it was only hard to picture three-dimensional
Spacetime introduced.
geometric ﬁgures, it is impossible to picture four-dimensional objects. In fact, the only way
to work with spacetime objects is through coordinates and mathematical relations between
them.
Fortunately, just as plane geometry helped us understand many of the features of solid
geometry, plane spacetime, shown in Figure 27.1, can help us understand the subtle features
of the full 4D spacetime. Now, in the case of Euclidean geometry, it did not matter which
two coordinates we chose to represent the plane.
We chose (x, y); but any other pair
would have been equivalent: they would have amounted to holding our plane vertical.2 For
spacetime, we must include time as one of the coordinates, because time is not equivalent
to other (space) coordinates.3 As the other coordinate, we take x, although y and z are
just as good. Thus, our plane spacetime geometry consists of a set of events described by
pairs like (x, t).
What do you know? 27.1. How do you describe events that lie on a line parallel to
the ct-axis? Parallel to the x-axis?
It is convenient to change this pair slightly. The ﬁrst coordinate is a space coordinate
measured in meters; the second coordinate is measured in seconds. We want a pair both of
whose members are measured in the same units. To achieve this, we can either divide x by
a speed or multiply t by a speed. This speed has to be a universal speed so that diﬀerent
observers do not use diﬀerent speeds at random. The only speed that is universal is the
speed of light c. So, we choose to multiply the time coordinate by c and describe an event
by (x, ct). Figure 27.1(b) shows an event E, whose x is 3 m and whose ct is 5 m.
Example 27.1.1. At what time did the event E of Figure 27.1 occur?
Since we are given
ct = 5 m, we can easily ﬁnd t by dividing by the speed of light in meters per second:
t = ct
c =
5
3 × 108 = 1.67 × 10−8 s.
2The plane described by (x, z) is a plane, one side of which runs east-west, the other up-down. Similarly
(y, z) is a plane, one side of which runs north-south, the other up-down.
3This is the reason that ∆t was called the coordinate time in Chapter 26.

27.2
Events and Worldlines
The building blocks of spacetime geometry are events just as the building blocks of Euclidean
geometry are points.
Events of spacetime geometry and points of Euclidean geometry
exist independently of the observers plotting them on their coordinatized sheets of paper.
However, for purposes of calculation, it is convenient (in fact necessary) to construct a
coordinate system in which to assign numbers as coordinates of points or events.
In Euclidean geometry one picks a point of the plane, calls it the origin, erects his axes
from there, and measures the coordinates of all points relative to this coordinate system.
In plane spacetime geometry one picks an event, calls it the origin, erects her axes from it,
and measures the coordinates of all events relative to that coordinate system. These origins
and axis orientations are quite arbitrary and are chosen to make calculations as simple as
possible.
A collection of points arranged and connected in a certain succession constitutes a curve
Worldlines are curves in
spacetime.
in Euclidean plane.
What is the analogue of a curve in spacetime plane?
Although it
is possible to “connect” a random collection of events in a spacetime plane, it is more
appropriate to think of the collection as the location of a moving object at diﬀerent times.
The resulting “curve” is known as the worldline of that object.
Figure 27.2(a) shows Emmy, standing at the origin of her coordinate system, as she
watches some objects, each assumed to be moving with a constant velocity that is com-
parable to light speed. In Figure 27.2(b) are drawn the worldlines of these objects. All
the worldlines are straight lines, because all speeds are assumed constant. The slope4 of
an object moving with speed vb relative to Emmy5 is c∆t/∆x or 1/(∆x/c∆t) or 1/(vb/c).
Introducing the symbol βb = vb/c, we write the slope as 1/βb. For light, this is equal to 1;
The symbol β is used for
the ratio of speed to the
speed of light.
therefore, on a spacetime coordinate system, light has a worldline that makes a 45◦angle
with the positive x-axis. We often draw the light worldline as a wavy line. Since βb < 1
4As usual, slope is measured relative to the horizontal axis. However, later we will ﬁnd it convenient to
use slopes relative to the vertical axis as well.
5The subscript “b” reﬂects our choice of a bullet or a ball as a typical moving object. You will see this
subscript later as well.

for all other objects, their slope must be larger than 1, i.e., the angle that they make with
the x-axis must be larger than 45◦. This goes not only for objects that move with constant
speed as in Figure 27.2(b), but also for objects such as A in Figure 27.2(c), whose speed
is changing. In the latter case, the restriction applies to instantaneous speed: at every
moment, any inﬁnitesimal segment of the worldline must have a slope that is larger than
1. Figure 27.2(c) shows a typical segment of the worldline and the rise and run for that
segment. We see that the rise is larger than the run. This must hold at every point (event)
of the worldline.
What do you know? 27.2. What is wrong with the worldline in Figure 27.3(a)?
An object that is stationary relative to Emmy has a vertical worldline, because its
distance (x-coordinate) does not change. The mountain to her right and the star to her

to scale]. Emmy herself has a worldline that is vertical (her time axis), because she is not
moving (and her x-coordinate is always zero). This is true for all observers: the worldline
of any observer is his/her time axis.
What do you know?
27.3. Which pairs of events in Figure 27.3(b) are causally
connected? For those that are causally connected, determine if a massive probe can be
present at both events; if so, what the fractional speed of that probe should be.
When an observer O′ is present at two events, his worldline, which may not be a straight
line in the coordinate system of another (inertial) observer O, passes through (or connects)
those two events. The clock of O′, therefore, measures the proper time between those events
(see Box 26.1.1). If the events are very close together on the worldline of O′, the arc of this
worldline connecting those events is almost a straight line and can be identiﬁed as the time
axis of O′, because the two events have the same spatial coordinates. If O′ is not moving
with constant speed relative to O, this time axis keeps changing, but if O′ has constant
speed relative to O, the worldline of O′ is his time axis.
In general, many observers can be present at any given two events, but only one of them
has constant speed: it is the observer whose worldline is a straight line passing through
the two events. This straight line must have a slope larger than 1. When an observer

causal connection is generalized to also include the case when the worldline of a light signal
connects the two events.
Let us summarize our observation so far:
Box 27.2.1. Relative to an observer O, every object moves on a worldline whose instan-
taneous slope at every event of the worldline is larger than 1, except for light, whose
slope is 1. The instantaneous time axis of an observer O′ is the tangent to his/her
worldline. If O′ moves with constant speed relative to O, the worldline of O′ is his/her
time axis.
Two events that can be connected by a straight worldline whose slope is
larger than (or equal to) 1 are called causally connected, otherwise they are causally
disconnected.
Given any event E, we want to identify the collection of all events that are causally

connected to E. By deﬁnition, it is all the events that can be connected to E by a straight
line whose slope is larger than or equal to 1. Some of these, such as E1 in Figure 27.4(a),
occurred in the past of E; some, such as E2, will occur in the future. The shaded region
collects all events that are causally connected to E. The region is called the light cone,
because it is the projection of a four-dimensional region onto our two-dimensional spacetime
plane. We cannot show all the three space and the time axes at the same time on a two-
dimensional page. However, we are used to seeing three-dimensional objects drawn on a
two-dimensional paper. So we add only one more space axis (the y-axis) and redraw the
shaded region in Figure 27.4(b) to explain the word “cone” in light cone.
Causally disconnected events, i.e., those lying outside the light cone, are inaccessible
to E.
It is impossible for E to communicate with those events, because the signal of
communication would have to travel faster than light. On the other hand, it is possible for
E to send a “probe” to any event that lies within the light cone. The events that lie on
the surface of the cone require a light probe (signal); those inside require a probe traveling
slower than light.

The intersection of the worldlines of two objects is an event (just as the intersection
of two lines is a point in Euclidean geometry) at which both objects are present. If these
objects happen to be observers, then the observers are present at that event. For example,
observers O and A in Figure 27.2(c) are both present at the event with coordinates (0, 0)
in the RF of O. For the same reason, both A and a light signal are present at E1, with
the light signal initiating on the worldline of A and moving away from it. We call E1 the
emission of a light signal by observer A. Similarly, E2 is the reception of the same light
signal by O.
27.3
Space Transformation
Every spacetime plane has an origin, which is both a space origin and a time origin. You
are familiar with the space origin from your algebra course. But what exactly is the origin
of time? It is really analogous to the origin of space (coordinates). When we draw our x-
and y-axes in a plane, we are doing it quite arbitrarily, and some random point in the plane
of the sheet of paper—the point at which the two axes cross—receives the “honor” of being
the origin. The next time we draw the axes, another random point becomes the origin. As
I am writing these lines, I am 2003 years, 15 days, 10 hours, and 8 minutes away from the
arbitrary origin of time chosen by a certain population of the Earth. This same instant
(speciﬁed to within a minute) of time is described by another population—for example, the
Moslems or the Chinese—diﬀerently. Thus, the origin of time is an arbitrary instant with
respect to which we measure the times of the occurrence of all events.
Not only is the origin of a coordinate system (CS) arbitrary, but so is the orientation of
the axes. In the case of plane geometry, this causes the same point to have diﬀerent pairs

of coordinates in diﬀerent CSs. Figure 27.5 shows two CSs O and O′, whose origins and
orientations are diﬀerent. It is seen that the same point P is represented by two diﬀerent
pairs of numbers in the two CSs.

What do you know? 27.5. In the xy coordinate system a point P has coordinates
(1, 1). What are the coordinates of P relative to x′y′ whose origin coincides with that
of xy, but the x′-axis makes an angle of 45 degrees counterclockwise with the x-axis?
The freedom to choose the origin and axis-orientation entails the necessity of communi-
cation among observers—using diﬀerent coordinate systems—the way in which one set of
coordinates transforms into another. In other words, any observer should have the ability
to transform his/her pair of coordinates of a given point to the pair used by any other ob-
server. This means that there should be a mathematical recipe for ﬁnding the pair (x′, y′)
Coordinate
transformation.
that observer O′ assigns to a point, from the pair (x, y) that observer O assigns to the same
point. Math Note E.27.1 on page 116 of Appendix.pdf provides this recipe.
Transformation of single points is important in studying coordinated geometry. What
is more important, however, is properties of objects consisting of a collection of points;
objects such as lines and curves. Since any curve (including lines) can be built up from very
small (inﬁnitesimal) line segments,6 understanding the nature of a line segment becomes an
essential undertaking.
Math Note E.27.2 on page 118 of Appendix.pdf calculates the length of a line segment
as measured in two diﬀerent coordinate systems and shows that the value for the length
is the same in both CSs. This is of course obvious, because we don’t use coordinates to
measure the distance between two points, and if one person measures the distance and gets
a certain value, everybody else will get the same value. However, the connection between
distance and coordinates is important because, as we shall see, in relativity we have no
choice but to use coordinates.
Because we are dealing with Euclidean geometry, let us call P1P2 (or ∆r) the Euclidean
distance, and summarize the ﬁnding in Math Note E.27.2 this way:
Euclidean distance and
its invariance.
Box 27.3.1. The Euclidean distance between any two points in a plane is independent
of the coordinates used to describe those points. We say that Euclidean distance is an
invariant geometric quantity.
Since Euclidean geometry was discovered before the notion of coordinates was introduced
in mathematics, the idea of the distance being independent of the coordinate system used is
deeply ingrained in our mind. We never question the invariance of the Euclidean distance,
and when we transform the coordinates of points from a system O to another system O′,
we expect that the distance between any two points remain the same. That this is indeed
the case is shown in Math Note E.27.3 on page 119 of Appendix.pdf .
In deriving the coordinate transformations of Math Note E.27.1 we used Euclidean
geometry, in which the statement of Box 27.3.1 holds. Can we derive the rules algebraically?
In other words, can we start with the algebraic equation for distance between two points
[Equation (E.82)] and derive from it the transformation rules using only algebra? The reason
for such a derivation is that we have no “pictorial” conception of an invariant distance in
the spacetime plane, and the only way of deriving the transformation rules in the spacetime
plane is the algebraic way. Math Note E.27.4 on page 119 of Appendix.pdf derives the
Euclidean transformation rules using algebra.
6In the age of personal computers and graphic software, it is not hard for the reader to see this: draw
any “smooth” curve on your computer screen using a drawing program; magnify the image suﬃciently and
you will see the line segments (even the jagged points) that make up the curve.

Spacetime Distance
Our knowledge of spacetime is restricted to the coordinates; we don’t have a visual image
of the geometry of spacetime. On the contrary, Euclidean geometry was developed over
centuries by studying visual (and visualizable) images. This does not mean that we cannot
draw pictures in spacetime; it means that the pictures we draw have to be interpreted
diﬀerently than the familiar Euclidean pictures.
The ﬁrst thing we need to do is to ﬁnd an expression for the invariant distance between
two events. For this, we use the Euclidean analogy with the caveat that in plane geometry
we look at points in a real plane, in which we can draw real lines two of which we can pick
as our axes. In spacetime plane only one of the axes is real; the time axis is not real. Why?
Because, we can easily move back and forth along a space axis at will without leaving our
reference frame, but we cannot move backward along the time axis, and the passage of time
in the forward direction is out of our control.7
Math Note E.27.5 on page 121 of Appendix.pdf derives the expression for the in-
variant spacetime distance (also called spacetime interval), which we reproduce in the
following
Spacetime distance and
its invariance.
Box 27.4.1. The spacetime distance (interval) ∆s between two events E1 and E2,
with respective coordinates (x1, ct1) and (x2, ct2), is ∆s = c∆τ =
p
(c∆t)2 −(∆x)2,
where ∆τ is the proper time interval between the two events, ∆t = t2 −t1, and ∆x =
x2 −x1. This spacetime distance is independent of the observer.
The negative sign under the radical has a dramatic physical consequence: It allows for
the distance between two distinct events to be zero! Example D.27.1 on page 48 of
Appendix.pdf shows how this can happen, and concludes that
Spacetime distance for
light.
Box 27.4.2. For any light signal ∆s = 0. In other words, if two events are connected
by a light signal (i.e., if a light signal is present at the two events), then the spacetime
distance of those events is zero.
In Euclidean geometry the distance between two points is zero only if the two points coincide,
i.e., if they are the same point. Not so in spacetime geometry! Two diﬀerent events have a
zero spacetime distance if they can be connected by a light signal.
What do you know? 27.6. Does it make sense to talk about the distance between
two causally disconnected events?
What do you know? 27.7. Is it possible for a massive object to be present at two
events for which ∆s = 0?
What do you know? 27.8. Suppose two events are causally disconnected for one
observer. Is it possible to ﬁnd an observer for whom the events are causally connected?
7As we saw in Chapter 26, it is possible to move forward in time (as in the case of a captain of a spaceship
who remained younger than his daughter) in a controlled way, but you have to change your reference frame.

Rules of Spacetime Geometry
Geometry is the most elegant and powerful way of studying relativity.
Because of the
diﬀerence between the formula for the distance in the Euclidean and spacetime planes,
distortions take place, not unlike distortions resulting from mapping the spherical geometry
of the globe onto a ﬂat piece of paper. (See for example, Box 27.6.1 below.) However, we
can understand and manipulate these distortions by resorting to a set of rules derived from
the invariant distance formula of Box 27.4.1. These rules are summarized in Boxes F.0.2
and F.0.3 in Appendix.pdf.
Based on these rules, one can draw geometric ﬁgures and extract algebraic relations
governing events and worldlines. We shall not exploit the full extent of these rules and how
to get to the algebraic results from them, because such discussions are slightly technical.
Nevertheless, we urge the reader who is mathematically inclined (at the level of high school
geometry and algebra) to consult Appendix F in Appendix.pdf.
For the purpose of the simplest application of these rules, we state their most qualitative
features:
The word “stationary”
in this box means that
the reader is in the RF
of O′.
Box 27.5.1. Suppose that O moves relative to O′.
The axes of O′, the stationary
observer, are drawn perpendicular. The axes of O form an acute angle if O moves in
the positive direction, and an obtuse angle if O moves in the negative direction of O′.
Light worldline makes equal angles with the two axes of all observers.
Figure 27.6 shows the axes of two observers moving relative to one another. In Fig-
ure 27.6(a), O is moving in the positive direction of O′, while in Figure 27.6(b) O is moving
in the negative direction of O′ with a smaller speed (corresponding to a smaller θ). The
light worldline, represented by a wavy line, always makes equal angles with any pair of axes.
What do you know? 27.9. How would you draw the axes of Figure 27.6 from the
perspective of O (i.e., assuming that O is stationary)?

Simultaneity Revisited
The diagrammatic approach to relativity can elucidate some of the notions we discussed
earlier. Take, for instance, the relativity of simultaneity, which was one of the ﬁrst topics we
encountered. Figure 25.5 showed a picture in which Karl (observer O′) detects a simultane-
ous explosion of two ﬁrecrackers A and B. To Emmy, on the other hand, B happens before
A. Spacetime diagrams can further unravel the succession of these events, as discussed in
Section F.2.
If, for simplicity, we assume that the explosions occur—according to Karl—at exactly the
same time that Emmy passes him, then the diagrammatic analysis shows that for Emmy B
occurred before she reached Karl, but its signal reaches her after she passes Karl, consistent
with the middle picture of Figure 25.5.
The discussion above, although qualitative, sheds some light on the notion of simultane-
ity as perceived by two diﬀerent observers. If you know Emmy’s speed relative to Karl and
Karl’s measurement of the length of the train, you can calculate the time diﬀerence between
the explosions, the separation between the two ﬁrecrackers, and the time of the reception
of the two signals all according to Emmy. The interested reader can ﬁnd the details in
Example D.27.5.
What do you know? 27.10. The accompanying ﬁgure shows observers O with axes
x and ct and O′ with axes x′ and ct′. Are E1 and E2 simultaneous according to O or
O′? What about E3 and E4? In each case, if they are not simultaneous, say which
occurs ﬁrst.

The Train and the Tunnel
In the early days of relativity, there appeared to be a “paradox” having to do with the
contraction of length; it was called the pole-and-the-barn paradox. We consider a “modern”
version of it and call it the train-and-the-tunnel paradox. Emmy’s train moves close to light
speed as it approaches a tunnel.
Karl measures the contracted length of the train and
concludes that it should nicely ﬁt the tunnel he is standing by. Emmy, on the other hand,
sees her train to be longer than what Karl takes to be the length of the train and the tunnel
to be shorter 8 than what Karl takes to be its length. So she concludes that there is no way
she can ﬁt her train in that tunnel. What is going on?
The spacetime geometric analysis of the problem in Section F.3 of Appendix.pdf shows
that while the two ends of the train coincide with the two ends of the tunnel according to
Karl (and therefore he concludes that the two have the same length), Emmy sees the rear
end of the train outside while its front is just emerging from the tunnel. The paradox is
therefore related to simultaneity: what is simultaneous to Karl need not be simultaneous
to Emmy. Example D.27.2 on page 48 of Appendix.pdf adds some numerical spice to
the discussion.
The Doppler Eﬀect
Emmy is moving with speed v away from Karl along his positive direction. She sends a
light signal of wavelength λ to him, which is Doppler shifted to λ′. What is the relation
between λ, λ′, and v?
Figure 27.7(a) shows Karl’s (the primed axes) and Emmy’s (the unprimed axes) RFs,
whose origins are assumed to have coincided at t = 0 and t′ = 0. Event E1 is the emission
of a crest of the light wave by Emmy’s light source. After T seconds (T is the period of

the light wave related to its frequency via f = 1/T), the next crest is emitted at event E2.
These two crests travel along the two wavy worldlines (making a 45◦angle with the axes as
they should), and are received by Karl at C and D. Therefore, CD = cT ′, where T ′ is the
period of the light signal as measured by Karl. Since λ = cT and λ′ = cT ′, what is left to
do to obtain the Doppler formula is to ﬁnd CD in terms of v and T. Math Note E.27.8
on page 123 of Appendix.pdf shows how to accomplish this task.
Spacetime diagrams can also be used to derive the Doppler shift of an electromagnetic
wave reﬂected from a moving object. Figure 27.7(b) shows Emmy moving relative to Karl.
Karl sends a radar signal to Emmy and measures the wavelength of its reﬂection, whereby
determining Emmy’s speed. How does he do it? Let E1 be the sending of a wave crest, and
E2 that of the next crest, so that E1E2 is cT, where T is the period of the radar. These
waves intersect Emmy’s worldline (are received by her) at C and D, whereupon they get
reﬂected and are received by Karl at A and B. Note that the radars emitted at E1 and E2
and their reﬂections CA and DB travel on worldlines making 45◦angle with Karl’s axes.
Our task is to ﬁnd AB in terms of E1E2. The derivation can be found in Math Note
E.27.9 on page 123 of Appendix.pdf , which also shows us precisely where the factor of 2
in Equation (E.13) comes from.
Time Travel?
Humankind have been traveling in three dimensions for millions of years. The two-dimen-
sional aspect of this travel was magniﬁed when man invented the wheel, horse and buggy,
and particularly the automobile. Travel in the third dimension became excitingly frequent
with the invention of the airplane. Now we have learned that relativity makes time a “fourth
dimension.” So, a natural question to ask is: Can we travel in time? A typical situation
is the occurrence of an event E in the past of an observer O′ as shown in Figure 27.8(a).
Since O′ has no “time machine,” he exploits the variation of time as measured by others,
and ﬁnds an observer O for whom E occurs now. O must lie on the x′-axis (because O′
wants to do the “time traveling” now, i.e., at t = 0), and E on the x-axis (because E must
be taking place now for O). This determines the x-axis as the line EO. By drawing a light
worldline at O (which makes a 45◦angle with O′ axes) and reading the angle it makes with
the x-axis, you can draw the ct-axis as well.

What if we ﬁnd an RF for which 10 Earth years before Bruno’s execution is now [as in

crew of this RF have 144 years to plan to save Bruno. Can they? To save him, they have
to send somebody whose worldline connects O and E in Figure 27.8(c). Such a worldline

using the numbers given in those examples, it is impossible to travel back and forth in time.
Can we generalize this? Is it impossible to prevent any past or future event? The following
general argument shows that the past is indeed out of our reach. A similar argument shows
that the future is also inaccessible.
The reference frame O that we are seeking must lie on the Earth’s x′-axis (see Fig-
ure 27.9). It could be any point of this axis with one condition: the resulting coordinate

system for O must have its time axis in the light cone at O.9 It follows that the x-axis must
be to the right of the cone. But the x-axis is the line OB, because B is happening NOW (at
the same time as the origin of time) for O. So we must choose O on the horizontal line in
such a way that the line BO is outside the light cone. This makes B causally disconnected
from O. The line O′O is also outside the line cone. Since the line EO lies between O′O
and BO, it too must lie outside the light cone. Therefore, E is causally disconnected from
O, and no probe (even light) can reach E from our RF.
Lorentz Transformations
The rules of spacetime geometry, as outlined in Boxes F.0.2 and F.0.3 have enabled us
to connect the coordinates and intervals measured by one observer to those measured by
another. In each example that we encountered, we calculated the coordinates and intervals
based on the particular numbers given in that example. It is now worthwhile to introduce
an algebraic recipe for relating the coordinates and intervals of two observers.
Section
F.4 ﬁnds this recipe, which is at the heart of relativity theory and is called the Lorentz

transformation.
Lorentz transformations are sometimes used to simplify the analysis of physical pro-
cesses. A process may be easier to analyze in some particular reference frame. Then one
analyzes the process in that RF and Lorentz transforms it to any other desired RF. A
corollary of this procedure is the following:
Box 27.5.2. If a physical process is impossible in one reference frame, then it is im-
possible in all reference frames.
Lorentz transformation quantiﬁes all the qualitative discussions of relativistic eﬀects.
For instance, the discussion of simultaneity above and in Section F.2 concentrated on the
qualitative aspect of simultaneity in the context of spacetime geometry.
Using Lorentz
transformation, we can calculate the time diﬀerence between two events according to Karl,
when Emmy, moving at relativistic speed sees them simultaneously. Example D.27.5 on
page 51 of Appendix.pdf ﬁnds such a time diﬀerence.
Other examples of the Lorentz transformations are given in Section D.27. One is Exam-
ple D.27.6 on page 52 of Appendix.pdf , which shows that Lorentz transformations imply
both time dilation and length contraction. Another is Example D.27.7 on page 52 of
Appendix.pdf , which looks at time travel—in this case, to John F. Kennedy’s assassination
in 1963—using Lorentz transformations. The third is Example D.27.8 on page 55 of
Appendix.pdf , which resolves the following seemingly peculiar paradox.
Food for Thought
FFT 27.5.3. Latour is a well known social scholar who thinks that scientists should not be
allowed to express their opinions about their trades. Such opinions, he argues, belong only in the
domain of the social sciences. In the last few decades these social scholars have been playing with
the idea that science is not independent of the social environment in which it has developed (see
Section 19.4); that literally we would have a diﬀerent kind of physics if the social conditions under
which the physical ideas have been developed had been diﬀerent. For example, the solar system
would obey a diﬀerent kind of gravitational law had Newton been raised in a society other than
the seventeenth-century England. In order to buttress this claim, Latour wrote an article entitled
“A Relativistic Account of Einstein’s Relativity.”
Latour uses two techniques to make his point: he redeﬁnes the “usual concepts” of the social
sciences to ﬁt his needs, and he makes his own strange interpretation of relativity by reading a
single book, the book that Einstein wrote for the layman in 1917. To show the reader that the ﬁrst
technique as stated above is not tongue in cheek, we let Latour describe it in his own words:
Instead of extending the social sciences’ usual concepts to the natural sciences, I want
to redeﬁne these very social concepts in order to be able to make them explain the

404
Chapter 27
Spacetime Geometry
more formal sciences. The task at hand is to keep the same strong programme, but to
doubt what social sciences have to say about society. [Lat 88, p. 4]
In other words, if the social sciences cannot prove that natural sciences are social, then change the
social sciences so much as to be able to prove that the natural sciences are social. This socialization
of sciences is, by the way, the task of what Latour calls the “strong programme.”
The word “observer” is used frequently in physics literature, especially the literature intended
for the layman, and we have used it frequently in our treatment of relativity thus far. We have
also seen its use in the quantum theory, where it has been (ab)used to infer an “observer-created
reality.” Latour’s interpretation of the relativity theory relies heavily on this word.10 In popular
accounts of relativity theory observer is used instead of “reference frame,” because the latter is an
unfamiliar word to most readers. This usage is deﬁnitely not intended to “humanize” the theory.
Yet that is precisely what Latour does: observer for Latour is only a “delegate.”
One of the cornerstones of relativity is Lorentz transformations, the subject of this chapter.
As the reader has noticed, Lorentz transformations are mathematical statements connecting the
locations and times of the same event in two diﬀerent reference frames. In most treatments of
relativity however, these transformations are assumed to connect the observers living in the cor-
responding reference frames. Latour’s reading of the transformations is the semiotic concepts of
“shifting in” and “shifting out,” whereby an author changes the personae of a narrative from third
person, say to ﬁrst person and back again. More precisely, Latour identiﬁes the two “observers” as
two imaginary “delegates” between whom the narrator “shifts in and out,” and the mathematical
idea behind the Lorentz transformations becomes merely a “shifting in” and “shifting out” of the
narration. Here is Latour’s interpretation of relativity in his own words:
The peculiarity of Einstein’s narration is not that it puts to use shifting in and out,
since every narration does the same, but that it focuses the reader’s attention upon
these very operations.
He [Einstein] is interested only in the way in which we send any actor to any other
frame of reference. Instead of describing laws of nature, he sets out to describe how
any description is possible.. . .
Technically his book is about delegation . . . and is a book of meta-linguistics or of
semiotics, one which tries to understand how any narration is constructed. [Hut 98,
p. 185]
Thus Latour reduces the entire theory of relativity, on which hundreds of scientiﬁc books and
articles are written, to a single expository book written for nontechnical readers, and then reduces
that book to a trivial narration. To him the mathematically elegant and physically all-encompassing
theory of relativity becomes “Einstein’s narration;” the ground-breaking Lorentz transformations
become the “peculiarity of Einstein’s narration;” and Einstein is blamed for being interested in
Lorentz transformations, which to Latour are “the way in which we send any actor to any other
frame of reference.” The last sentence of the quotation gives an excellent summary of the extent of
Latour’s understanding of relativity and its disﬁguration brought about by his injection of “meta-
linguistic” and “semiotic” potion into the theory.
We started our quantitative discussion of relativity with time dilation, in which we held

a Michelson-Morley clock vertical and moved it horizontally with high speed (see Section
26.1).
Then using the Pythagorean theorem, we derived the formula (26.1) connecting
proper time and the coordinate time. In the meantime, we have discovered the phenomenon
of length contraction. This creates a dilemma.
Suppose Emmy and Karl are on a spaceship moving at 86.6% light speed, and each
carries a Michelson-Morley clock 3 meters long. Emmy holds her clock vertically while Karl
keeps it horizontal. As they travel from Earth to a distant planet, they both age 5 years.
We know how to calculate Earth time interval from Emmy’s clock: using Equation (26.1),
we deduce that the Earth inhabitants age

Karl, on the other hand, holding his clock along the direction of motion, causes a shrinkage
of its length for the Earth people. Are they to conclude that Karl’s ticks are shorter than
Emmy’s, and therefore, that the Earth people must age more than 10 years? Which one is
it? Have they aged 10 years or more? Example D.27.8 resolves this strange double timing.
Relativistic Law of Addition of Velocities
Relativity prohibits any object to go faster than light speed. What happens, then, when a
supertrain passenger ﬁres a supergun, shooting bullets at almost light speed while the train
is also moving at almost light speed? Would a platform observer see the bullet moving
faster than light? Our intuition says that if the train moves at 0.9c and the bullet is ﬁred
in the forward direction with a speed of 0.9c with respect to the train, then the platform
observer should see the bullet move at 1.8c. Our intuition is wrong, of course! Lorentz
transformations are right and will give us the right answer, as Example D.27.9 on page
56 of Appendix.pdf illustrates.
Example D.27.9 shows that even though two speeds may be very close to the speed of
light, they do not “add up” to a speed larger than light speed. The Lorentz transformations
played a crucial role in this limitation, and its general form can be used to obtain a formula
for adding velocities relativistically. Suppose that a bullet is moving in O with speed vb
and O is moving relative to O′ with speed v. What is the speed v′
b of the bullet relative
to O′? Math Note E.27.13 on page 128 of Appendix.pdf derives Equation (E.106), a
mathematical formula giving v′
b in terms of vb and v.
This law of addition of velocities never violates relativity theory as the reader may verify
by inserting some large values (but smaller than c, of course) for v and vb and noting that
v′
b comes out smaller than c as well. In fact, Math Note E.27.13 shows this quite generally.
What do you know? 27.11. Observer O sees spaceship A move at 0.99c to the right
and spaceship B move at 0.99c to the left. So, in 1 second he sees the distance between
A and B increase to almost 600,000 km. Is the speed of A relative to B almost twice
the speed of light?
Equation (E.106) also agrees with the second principle of relativity. If instead of a bullet,
O sends a light beam so that vb = c,11 (E.106) gives v′
b = (c + v)(1 + vc/c2), which is easily
shown to be equal to c. Hence, O′ also measures the speed of light to be c.
27.6
Curved Worldlines
The straight worldlines that we have considered so far do not describe the most general
type of motion. Objects and observers (i.e., reference frames) often change their speed.
In fact, starting from rest, to attain a ﬁnal constant speed, one has to accelerate. The
worldline of an accelerating RF is a curve in the spacetime plane such as the one shown
in Figure 27.10(a), where the slope changes from event to event. If the curve represents
a real worldline, then the tangent12 to the curve at every point must have a slope that is
larger than 1, because the inverse of this slope is v/c, with v the instantaneous speed of the
accelerating RF.
Although straight worldlines are restrictive, they are fundamental in the same sense
A curved worldline is the
union of a lot of small
straight worldlines.
that straight lines are fundamental in Euclidean geometry: any worldline can be built up
from small straight worldline segments. For example, Figure 27.10(b) shows a worldline
11We still use vb, although a light signal is the object that is moving, not a bullet.
12Recall that the tangent line to a curve at a point P is a straight line that touches the curve only at P
in the vicinity of P.

consisting of ﬁve straight segments (OA through DE).
This collection of ﬁve straight
worldlines approximates the curve of Figure 27.10(a) fairly well, but if we want a better
approximation, we can increase the number of straight worldlines. Figure 27.10(c) shows a
worldline consisting of ten straight segments (OA through IJ), which obviously approximate
the curve more accurately. For even better accuracy we can further increase the number of
worldline segments. All these straight segments must have slopes that are larger than 45◦.
27.6.1
The Spacetime Triangle Inequality
Given any two points in Euclidean geometry, there are inﬁnitely many curves that connect
those points. These curves have diﬀerent lengths, and only one—the one we call straight—
has the shortest length. At the heart of this property lies the triangle inequality, which
states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length
of the third side. If triangle inequality holds, then one can show that indeed a straight line
is the shortest path. Here is how.
Consider two points P1 and P2 in a Euclidean plane. Draw a straight line and a curve
through the points as shown in Figure 27.11. Pick a (strategic!) point A on the curve and
form the triangle P1P2A. By triangle inequality, P1A + AP2 > P1P2. Now choose a point
B on the curve between P1 and A and another point C between A and P2. Invoking the
triangle inequality again, we see that P1B +BA > P1A and AC +CP2 > AP2. Substituting
these inequalities in the previous one, we get P1B + BA + AC + CP2 > P1P2. Continuing
this process ad inﬁnitum, we conclude that the length of the curve is larger than the length
of the straight line.
Is there a triangle inequality in spacetime geometry? A spacetime triangle consists
of three mutually causally connected events connected by straight worldlines (the slopes
of these lines are therefore larger than 1). The spacetime distance between two events at
the two ends of a side of the triangle is the spacetime length of that side. Math Note
E.27.14 on page 129 of Appendix.pdf shows that
A weird inequality!
Box 27.6.1. The sum of the spacetime length of any two sides of a spacetime triangle
is less than the spacetime length of the third side.
This is a surprising result, but by now we must be used to surprises in relativity! The
inequality, which is quite the opposite of what we are accustomed to, is the direct result of
the formula for the spacetime distance, especially the negative sign in the equation of Box
27.4.1.

Figure 27.11: The triangle inequality in Euclidean geometry proves that a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points.
Given any two causally connected events in spacetime geometry, there are inﬁnitely
many worldlines that connect those events. Using the triangle inequality of Box 27.6.1 and
an argument similar to the one used in the Euclidean case of Figure 27.11, we can show
that out of all these worldlines the straight one has the longest spacetime length. These
worldlines represent observers who travel with diﬀerent speeds and accelerations, and the
spacetime length becomes essentially the proper time of those observers.13 Since straight
worldlines represent inertial observers, we have the important result:
Box 27.6.2. The longest proper time between two events is measured by the inertial
observer present at those events. Stated diﬀerently, the inertial observer ages more than
any accelerated observer between two events.
27.6.2
The Twin Paradox Revisited
Section 26.3 discussed the twin paradox, and it emphasized the symmetry between the twin
observers: each twin sees the other age slower. We may accept this reluctantly as long as
the twins are far apart and one is moving relative to the other. But what if we bring them
face to face? Which one will be younger?
Suppose Emmy’s rocketship takes oﬀ(event E1), immediately reaches a speed close to
light speed, and heads to a distant planet. As soon as she reaches the planet, she abruptly
turns around and heads back to Earth to land at event E2. Karl, her twin brother is waiting
for her at the landing site. From our experience with the example of the captain and his
daughter (e.g., see Example D.26.2), we know that Emmy will be younger, but why?
Karl’s worldline in Figure 27.12(a) is the vertical axis labeled ct′; Emmy’s worldline is
the broken line E1PE2; the planet’s worldline is the vertical line passing through P. The
spacetime triangle inequality of Box 27.6.1 implies that Emmy’s spacetime distance between
E1 and E2 is shorter than Karl’s, and therefore, she will be younger.
What do you know? 27.12. In Figure 27.12(b), the worldline of O′ is the ct′-axis
and that of O is the curved path. Which one measures the proper time interval between
E1 and E2?
“But,” the reader may say “we haven’t really resolved the paradox. There is still a sym-
metry between the two twins: Emmy looks at her brother and sees that he is moving away
from her as she takes oﬀtoward the planet. On her way home, she sees Karl approaching
her, exactly as Karl sees his twin sister. So, there is a complete symmetry. How do you

explain the fact that only Emmy stays younger?” The answer is that there is no symmetry
between the two! Emmy is accelerating for part of her journey; Karl never experiences an
acceleration. In fact, Emmy experiences four kinds of acceleration: her take-oﬀrequires an
acceleration until she reaches her steady speed; once she approaches the planet, she has to
slow down to a stop; then she has to accelerate toward Earth until she reaches her steady
speed for return; ﬁnally, she has to slow down for landing. Emmy’s true worldline is shown
in Figure 27.12(b), where the curvatures at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of
the journey indicate the acceleration and noninertiality of Emmy’s RF. And, as Box 27.6.2
indicates, accelerated RFs experience a shorter passage of time.

Answers to “What do you know?”
27.1.
All these events have the same projection on the x-axis. Therefore, they have the
same x values; i.e., they are at the same location. Similarly, all events lying on a line parallel
to the x-axis have the same projection on the ct-axis. Therefore, they have the same ct
values; i.e., they occur at the same time—they are simultaneous events.
27.2. In the middle of the worldline the slope is less than 1.
27.3. Draw the light cone (past and future) of each event and see which of the remaining
events lie in that light cone. You should get the following results: E1 is causally connected
to E3, E5, E6, and E7. E2 is causally connected to E4, E5, E6, and E7. E3 is causally
connected to E1, E5, E6, and E7. E4 is causally connected to E2 and E7. E5 is causally
connected to all but E4. E6 is causally connected to E1, E2, E3, and E5. E7 is causally
connected to all but E6.
27.4.
O′ starts from rest relative to O accelerates to very high speed. Then slows down
until he stops relative to O. After a while O′ starts coming back, ﬁrst accelerating, then
slowing down and ﬁnally stopping.
(a) A little over 3 light years.
(b) Approximately 6 years.
(c) About 2 years.
(d) About 13.5 years.

27.5.
The x′-axis goes through P. So, y′ = 0, and P has coordinates (
√
2, 0) in the x′y′
coordinate system.
27.6.
If you deﬁne the distance as
p
(∆s)2, no, because (∆s)2 is negative for two events
that are causally disconnected. But if you consider (∆s)2 itself as an invariant quantity,
then you can say that for two causally disconnected events, (∆s)2 is negative.
27.7.
No. Because ∆s = 0 only if c∆t = ∆x; or ∆x/∆t = c, implying that the object
must be traveling at light speed, which is impossible.
27.8.
No. When the ﬁrst observer calculates (∆s)2, she gets a negative number. Since
(∆s)2 is invariant (i.e., the same for all observers), every observer obtains the same result.
In particular, every observer obtains (the same) negative number for (∆s)2, and concludes
that the two events are causally disconnected.
27.9. From the perspective of O, ct and x are perpendicular. Then ct′ and x′ axes make
an obtuse angle in Figure 27.6(a) and an acute angle in Figure 27.6(b).
27.10.
To ﬁnd the ct coordinate of an event, draw a line through the event parallel to
the x-axis. Where it intersects the ct-axis is the time coordinate of the event. To ﬁnd the
x coordinate of an event, draw a line through the event parallel to the ct-axis. Where it
intersects the x-axis is the space coordinate of the event. Thus, E1 and E2 are simultaneous
according to O but not according to O′. Similarly, E3 and E4 are simultaneous according
to O′ but not according to O. E1 occurs before E2 according to O′, and E4 occurs before
E3 according to O.
27.11. Of course not! From B’s perspective, neither the time is 1 second nor the distance
600,000 km. These quantities change in such a way as to keep A’s speed relative to B less
than light speed.
27.12. Both! Because both observers (and their clocks) are present at both events.

Chapter28
E = mc2
Chapter 27 introduced the spacetime distance and the relevant transformations (the Lorentz
transformations) of coordinates that leave this distance unchanged: Given two events the
spacetime distance between those events is the same for all observers. We also saw that,
except for a factor of c, the spacetime distance is simply the proper time interval between
the two events, where as the reader may recall, the proper time is the time measured by a
clock that is present at both events. In this chapter, we use the proper time to deﬁne some
important relativistic quantities.
28.1
Coordinate Velocity
The ﬁrst such quantity we wish to introduce is the generalization of ordinary velocity, and
in order to understand the generalization, we have to look at the ordinary velocity from a
new perspective.
Terry travels from Bloomington, Illinois to Chicago on an almost straight path as shown
in Figure 28.1(a). The distance between the two cities is about 130 miles, and if Terry covers
this distance in 2 hours, his average speed will be 65 mph. This is the way we normally
think of car travels. But there is another—more precise—way. As Terry moves 130 miles
northeast from Bloomington to Chicago, his eastward displacement is about 82 miles and
his northward displacement 101 miles. We can say that Terry moved 82 miles east and 101
miles north simultaneously. There is more information in the second description of motion
than in the ﬁrst. Saying Terry moved 130 miles northeast in 2 hours does not tell us how
much in each direction he traveled; but saying he traveled 82 miles eastward and 101 miles
Velocity can be broken
up (resolved) into its
components.
northward speciﬁes the direction (as well as the distance) exactly.1
We can go even further and calculate his speed in each direction. Since he covered 82
miles in the east direction in 2 hours, we say his speed east was 41 mph. Similarly, we say
that his speed north was 50.5 mph. These speeds form a right triangle and if we use the
Pythagorean theorem, we get
√
412 + 50.52 = 65 mph, which is his “real” speed. We can
denote these speeds by veast and vnorth.
Instead of east and north, we can use the more general x and y directions, and denote
these coordinate velocities by vx and vy, where the motion is considered to take place
between two points, say P1 and P2. Furthermore, since the “eastward distance” is nothing
but the increment in x and the “northward distance” the increment in y, we can write the
x- and the y-component of the velocity: vx = ∆x/∆t, vy = ∆y/∆t, where ∆t is the time it
takes the object to go from P1 to P2 [see Figure 28.1(b)].
1For the distance, simply apply the Pythagorean theorem to the triangle in Figure 28.1(a).

Spacetime Velocity
How do we apply the discussion above to relativity? Imagine an object moving in space
while carrying a clock with it. The points of space through which the object passes, plus
the instants at which the object happens to pass through those points constitute a series
of events. The object is of course present at all those events, and its clock measures the
proper time. Not all observers have access to this clock, and therefore, they cannot read the
proper time directly. However, each observer can measure the distance the object travels in
a particular time interval in his own RF, and using Box 27.4.1, can calculate the proper time
interval for that distance. The important point to emphasize is that once the calculation is
done, all observers get the same number. Thus,
Box 28.2.1. Every moving object has a unique and universal time attached to it, its
proper time.
It is therefore natural to deﬁne the physical quantities associated with that object in terms
of this universal time.2 One such quantity is the spacetime velocity.
Box 28.2.2. Stop! The remainder of this chapter gets slightly technical. The only
parts of this chapter you would need are Equation (28.6) (which you already know).
Also look at Example 28.3.2, Box 28.3.3, and, of course, the Food For Thoughts!
2Let us immediately emphasize that although each object has a universal time attached to it, this time
is diﬀerent for diﬀerent objects.

Figure 28.2: The displacement and ﬂight time of the bullet according to Emmy. Note that the bullet is
moving along the x-axis only.
Emmy looks at a bullet moving with a speed vb relative to her; measures its displacement
∆xb—between two events E1 and E2—and the time ∆tb it takes the bullet to cover the
distance ∆xb (see Figure 28.2). These are the analogues of ∆x and ∆y of the coordinate
velocity of Figure 28.1(b). However, instead of dividing these by ∆t, which is universal only
in nonrelativistic situations, we divide by the next best thing: the bullet’s proper time. To
do this, Emmy calculates the spacetime distance ∆sb—from ∆tb and ∆xb—of the bullet
and from that ∆τb, the proper time between E1 and E2. This yields two components: the
Spacetime velocity.
space component ∆xb/∆τb and the time component c∆tb/∆τb. We denote the space part
by ubx and the time part by ubt (b for “bullet,” x for space, and t for time). Then Math

as the invariant length of the spacetime velocity in the two-dimensional spacetime geom-
etry.
Karl watches Emmy and the bullet move relative to him. Anxious to see what he gets
for the spacetime velocity, he concentrates on the bullet, moving with a speed v′
b relative
to him. He measures its displacement ∆x′
b—between the same two events E1 and E2 that
Emmy measured—and the time ∆t′
b it takes the bullet to cover the distance ∆x′
b.
He
then calculates the spacetime distance ∆sb of the bullet and from that ∆τb, the proper
time between E1 and E2, and he gets exactly what Emmy gets, of course. The spacetime
velocity that Karl measures for the bullet has the space part ∆x′
b/∆τb and the time part
c∆t′
b/∆τb. We denote Karl’s space part by u′
bx and the time part by u′
bt. Then, using
Equation (26.1) and noting that this time the speed is that of the bullet as measured by
Karl, we have u′
bx = γ′
bv′
b and u′
bt = γ′
bc.
The spacetime velocity that Karl measures is of course diﬀerent from what Emmy mea-
sures. As Equation (28.1) and the corresponding one for Karl show, only the space com-
ponent of the spacetime velocity is related to the ordinary velocity of the bullet. Indeed,
when the bullet moves with speeds considerably smaller than light speed, γb will be indis-
tinguishable from 1 and ubx from vb, the classical velocity. The time component has no
classical analogue.
How are the components of the spacetime velocity of the bullet as measured by Karl re-
lated to those measured by Emmy? From the deﬁnition of the components of the spacetime
velocity it should be evident that they are related via Lorentz transformations. In fact, the
same Lorentz transformations that connect (∆x′
b, c∆t′
b) to (∆xb, c∆tb) connect (u′
bx, u′
bt) to

416
Chapter 28
E = mc2
(ubx, ubt). More speciﬁcally, if we divide both sides of the ∆-equations of Box F.4.1 by ∆τb,
we get the primed spacetime velocity on the left-hand side and the unprimed spacetime
velocity on the right-hand side. Thus, we can write
u′
bx = γ(ubx + βubt),
u′
bt = γ(βubx + ubt).
(28.2)
What do you know? 28.2. Emmy sees a relativistic bullet move at vb = 0.9c. What
are the values of ubx and ubt, the components of the spacetime velocity of the bullet
relative to Emmy? Now suppose that Emmy moves at 0.6c relative to Karl. What
are the values of u′
bx and u′
bt, the components of the spacetime velocity of the bullet
relative to Karl? Verify that the invariant length of the spacetime velocity is the same
for Emmy and Karl. Hint: You need to consult Math Note E.28.1.
The ﬁrst equation in (28.2) gives the space component of the bullet’s spacetime velocity
as measured by Karl in terms of the space and time components of the bullet’s spacetime
velocity as measured by Emmy. Since both components of the spacetime velocity are given
in terms of the ordinary velocity, this equation is a relation between the ordinary velocity
of the bullet as measured by Karl and the ordinary velocity of the bullet as measured by
Emmy (as well as the relative speed of the two observers). It follows that the relativistic law
of addition of velocities should be somehow hidden in Equation (28.2). Math Note E.28.2
on page 131 of Appendix.pdf shows you how to uncover the relativistic law of addition of
velocities from Equation (28.2).
28.3
Spacetime Momentum
Spacetime velocities are important in their own right. However, their true signiﬁcance lies in
their use for building other quantities. One such quantity is the Spacetime momentum.,
Spacetime momentum.
which is naturally deﬁned as the product of mass and the spacetime velocity. Since the
spacetime velocity has two components, so does the spacetime momentum. Thus, we deﬁne
the space component (denoted by pbx) and the time component (denoted by pbt) of the
spacetime momentum (of a bullet) as

How are these two components related to the classical properties of the bullet?
To
answer this question we go to the limit of low velocities and compare the results to the
corresponding Newtonian quantities (see Box 26.4.1). The ﬁrst equation in (28.3) becomes
pbx ≈mvb when vb/c is very close to zero (and thus γb very close to 1). Therefore, it is
Relativistic momentum.
natural to identify γbmvb with the relativistic momentum of the bullet.

Relativistic Energy
The identiﬁcation of pbt is a little harder, because its comparison with the corresponding
Newtonian quantity requires some algebra, the details of which can be found in Math Note
E.28.3 on page 132 of Appendix.pdf . It turns out that if we multiply pbt by c we get the
relativistic energy of the bullet Eb:

What do you know? 28.3. How much energy is required to accelerate a 1000-kg
car from rest to 0.999c according to (the wrong) classical physics? According to (the
correct) relativistic physics?
The spacetime momenta of an object as measured by two observers are related by Lorentz
transformations. In fact, if we multiply both sides of (28.2) by m, we immediately obtain
the Lorentz transformations for spacetime momentum. However, we want to change this
result slightly. The ﬁrst change is a matter of notation: we use Equation (28.4) to replace
pbt with Eb and change pbx to pb, because, with pbt removed, the x subscript is superﬂuous.
So, multiplying both sides of 28.2 by m and incorporating these changes, we get
p′
b = γ(pb + βEb/c),
E′
b = γ(βpbc + Eb).
(28.5)
These equations connect the energy and momentum of an object as measured by an observer
O to those measured by O′, relative to whom O is moving with speed v.
Two special cases of Equation (28.4) require our attention: when vb = 0 and when
vb = c. In the ﬁrst case the denominator is 1 and we get Eb = mc2, from which we remove
the subscript b and write the most famous equation in physics:

showing the equivalence of mass and energy. It implies that it is in principle possible to
convert mass into energy and vice versa. Because of the enormity of c, a tiny amount of
mass can turn into a tremendous amount of energy. In a nuclear power plant uranium mass
is turned into energy through the nuclear process of ﬁssion,3 in which the large uranium
nucleus fragments into two smaller daughter nuclei whose total mass is smaller than the
uranium mass. The remaining mass of the uranium is converted into the kinetic energy of
the daughter nuclei, which is ultimately converted into electrical energy.
Food for Thought
FFT 28.3.1. Example 28.3.2 illustrated the awesome power hidden in a small amount of mass.
A nuclear power plant has mechanisms in place to control this awesome power in a way that useful
electricity comes out of the ﬁssion process. An uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion reaction is a nuclear
bomb.
Both the controlled and the uncontrolled nuclear ﬁssion reactions, as used in military and in
industry, are technological enterprises. The science behind this technology—the main part of which
is E = mc2—is only a small corollary of the much more encompassing relativity theory.
The development of the ﬁrst two atomic bombs in the US and their subsequent deployment on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki constitute one of the darkest moments in human history. Many scientists
were dragged into the construction of the bomb either by persuasion or by the whirlwind of the
political events; most of them later regretted to have been involved in it. Einstein, for example,
who wrote several letters to President Roosevelt urging him to support the construction of the
bomb, regretted such actions tremendously in his later years. “Had I known that the Germans
would not succeed in producing an atomic bomb, I would not have lifted a ﬁnger,” he said later.4
The image of science that some critics portray to the public is that of Hiroshima. Yet the bomb
has as much to do with science (of relativity) as the electric shocks used in the torture chambers of
dictatorships have to do with electricity. The reader has hopefully seen what an insigniﬁcant part
of relativity E = mc2 is. All the conclusions about the relativity of time, the shrinkage of space,
the slowing down of aging, the possibility of space travel to the worlds far away, and of course the
equivalence of mass and energy should not be reduced to the construction of the atomic bomb,

which employs a technology that makes use of the equivalence of mass and energy. There are other
enterprises that use the same equivalence for peaceful means—as nuclear medicine and electric
production do—or for furthering our understanding of the universe around us—as the physics of
fundamental interaction does.
Example 28.3.2. To see the immensity of the energy hidden in even a small mass, suppose that
one kilogram of uranium is used in a nuclear power plant to produce electricity. If all the mass is
converted into usable electric output, this amount of mass produces
E = mc2 = 1 × (3 × 108)2 = 9 × 1016 J
of energy.
A large power plant feeding a small city produces about one gigawatt of power or one billion
(109) Joules per second. If this power plant had only one kilogram of uranium that it could convert
entirely into energy, the production of electricity could continue for
9 × 1016 J
109 J/s
= 9 × 107 s.
Since there are about 30 million seconds in a year, this is equivalent to about three years!
■
What do you know? 28.4. Spaceship Enterprise uses matter antimatter annihilation
to produce energy. The power consumed in Enterprise is 10 megawatts (10 million Joules
per second). If half a kilogram of matter annihilates half a kilogram of antimatter, how
much energy is produced, and how long does it take Enterprise to use up this energy?
28.3.2
No Mass at Light Speed
The second special case of Equation (28.4), vb = c, makes the denominator of Equation
(28.4) equal to zero, giving rise to an inﬁnite energy.
This is unacceptable unless the
numerator also vanishes, i.e., m = 0. The reverse argument is also true: if m = 0 (and
the particle has some energy), then the denominator must also vanish, i.e., v = c. Since
photons (see Section 20.3), being particles of light, travel at the speed of light, they must
be massless. We therefore conclude that
Box 28.3.3. Only massless particles such as photons can travel at the speed of light.
Moreover, if a particle moves at light speed, it is necessarily massless.
No massive
particle can attain light speed.
It gets progressively harder to increase the speed of an object as this speed gets closer
and closer to light speed. Example D.28.2 on page 60 of Appendix.pdf shows why.
28.3.3
Invariant Length of Spacetime Momentum
Spacetime momentum is deﬁned directly in terms of the spacetime velocity. Since the latter
satisﬁes the invariant “length” equation [the last equation in (28.1)], the former—being just
m times the spacetime velocity—also satisﬁes a similar equation: p2
bt−p2
bx = m2c2. In terms
of energy (and removing the subscript x), this becomes (Eb/c)2 −p2
b = m2c2. Multiplying
both sides of this equation by c2 and removing the subscript b yields
Relation between energy
momentum and mass.
E2 −p2c2 = m2c4.
(28.7)

Section 28.3
Spacetime Momentum
419
Once again, this holds in all RFs, and one can think of it as the invariant length of the
spacetime momentum.
An interesting consequence of Equation (28.7) is that it allows the possibility of setting
m = 0. For massless particles such as photon, we have
E2 −p2c2 = 0
or
E2 = p2c2
or
E = |p|c.
(28.8)
The absolute-value sign around p is necessary because E is always positive, but p could be
positive or negative. However, often we just write E = pc, and introduce a negative sign
if p points in the negative direction. De Broglie used the last equation of (28.8) to derive
his famous formula λ = h/p for electrons. Example D.28.3 on page 60 of Appendix.pdf
and Math Note E.28.4 on page 132 of Appendix.pdf investigate an interesting conse-
quence of combining the energy-momentum Lorentz transformations (28.5) and the relation
between energy and momentum of a photon (28.8). The outcome of the investigation is the
relativistic Doppler formula.
28.3.4
No Relativistic Mass
Many authors write Equation (28.4) as Eb = Mc2, identify the result with Equation (28.6),
let M depend on velocity, and call it the relativistic mass! There is a historical justiﬁcation
for it.5 The notion of the dependence of mass on velocity was introduced by Lorentz (of
Lorentz transformation fame) in 1899 and then developed by him and others in the years
preceding Einstein’s formulation of special relativity in 1905, as well as in later years.
If you apply Newton’s second law of motion F = ∆p/∆t, which holds in relativity theory
as well, and deﬁne relativistic mass as the coeﬃcient of acceleration in F = Ma, then M
will have diﬀerent values when the velocity is perpendicular to the force (the transverse
mass) than when it is in the direction of the force (longitudinal mass). This already should
be an indication of the trouble with the notion of “relativistic mass.” Nevertheless, these
are the very expressions with which Lorentz introduced the two masses. Together with the
“relativistic mass” in the relation p = mrv, these masses formed the basis of the language
physicists used at the beginning of the twentieth century. Making the trouble even more
lasting, it was decided to call the “relativistic mass” simply “mass” and to denote it by m,
while the normal mass m was nicknamed “rest mass” and denoted by m0.
Food for Thought
FFT 28.3.4. The masslessness of photons has created a philosophical dilemma for some people.
Massless does not mean
nonmaterial!
How can a particle exist if it does not have any mass? Some go so far as to interpret photons as
“nonmaterial” and draw mystical conclusions from such an interpretation of physics. [See Section
35.3.3 for a “medical” application of this interpretation.]
At the heart of this question is the
deﬁnition of a particle.
Why do we call a bullet a particle, but do not call the wind a particle? The answer: a bullet is
localized, but the wind is not. Extending this notion to the subatomic particles, we call an electron
a particle because it is localized. But how do we know this? By the interaction of an electron with
a detector. When the detector of the electrons goes “click,” we know that a localized electron has
arrived.
But localization alone is not the main characteristic of a particle. A point in the vacuum is also
localized, but it is not a particle. A particle is usually moving, and in its motion carries energy and
momentum. How can we tell if a particle is carrying energy and momentum? By observing how
it transfers some of them to other particles. When the particle in question hits another particle
(large or small) it transfers part of its energy and momentum to the target particle.
A bullet
hitting a stationary block of wood imparts some of its momentum and energy to the wood, setting
it in motion (bulk energy and momentum) and heating it up (internal energy and momentum). An

Chapter 28
E = mc2
electron hitting a stationary molecule imparts some of its momentum and energy to the molecule,
setting it in motion (bulk energy and momentum) and causing its part to move as well (internal
energy and momentum).
What about a photon? Well, it also moves; it also carries energy and momentum; and when it
hits another particle (large or small) it transfers part of its energy and momentum to the target
particle. Just as a bullet is not “more of a particle” than an electron simply because it is more
massive than an electron, so is an electron not “more of a particle” than a photon simply because
it is more massive than a photon. Mass is only one of a myriad attributes characterizing particles.
It is by no means the determining attribute. A photon is as “material” as any other particle, be it
an electron or a bullet.
The real trouble with the notion of relativistic mass comes in when we associate a mass
of E/c2 to photons when they experience a gravitational force. When the correct theory
of gravity, the general theory of relativity, is applied to photons, it is found that a photon
would have diﬀerent masses for diﬀerent inclinations relative to the gravitating body. If it
falls directly toward the center, its mass is E/c2, but if it moves perpendicular to the radial
direction, its mass is 2E/c2.
Equation (28.7) clearly identiﬁes mass (on the right-hand side of the equation) as an
invariant quantity, which is the same for all observers.
Only if the particle is at rest
relative to an observer (so that p = 0) does E, which is now called the rest energy and
usually denoted by E0, equal mc2.
Einstein, who at the beginning of relativity theory
talked about a “relativistic mass,” in a letter dated June 19, 1948, writes, “It is not good to
introduce the concept of the mass M = m/
p
1 −v2/c2 of a moving body for which no clear
deﬁnition can be given. It is better to introduce no other mass concept than the ‘rest mass’
m. Instead of introducing M it is better to mention the expression for the momentum and
energy of a body in motion.”
28.4
Conservation of Momentum
One of the distinct features of momentum is its conservation, which is the content of the
ﬁrst law of motion as stated in Box 7.1.2 in Chapter 7. While momentum conservation was
discovered early on alongside the laws of motion, energy conservation required more time
because of the variety of forms in which it shows itself. It was not until the middle of the
nineteenth century that its formulation appeared as the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics.
As Food for Thought 18.2.4 illustrated, conservation of energy goes a lot deeper
than the ﬁrst laws of motion and thermodynamics. In her celebrated paper of 1918, Emmy
Conservation of energy
and momentum and its
relation to the
invariance under
spacetime translations.
Noether, the German mathematician showed that conservation of momentum and energy
is related to the invariance, respectively, of space and time under translation. Invariance
under space translation means that the space interval of one meter does not depend on its
initial point: A meter stick always measures a meter no matter where you put its zero.
Similarly, invariance under time translation means that an hour is an hour whether it is
measured from 1:00 to 2:00 or from 4:12 to 5:12, and Jane is 20 years old whether she uses
the Christian, Jewish, Moslem, or Chinese calendar. Noether’s theorem does not allow any
violation of the conservation of energy or momentum.
In the context of relativity theory, the discussion above means that energy and momen-
tum conservation holds for all observers. This universality has some consequences that we
investigate now. Conservation laws are best studied in collisions. To appreciate the rela-
tivistic conservation laws and their consequences, we ﬁrst turn our attention to the simpler
case of the classical laws. All collisions, both classical and relativistic, are assumed to take
place in one dimension.

Figure 28.3: The conservation of momentum in a collision.
28.4.1
The Classical Case
Two masses m1 and m2 are moving with velocities v1 and v2, respectively as shown in
Figure 28.3. Since v1 > v2 a collision takes place and two new masses M1 and M2 are
produced, which move with velocities V1 and V2. All of this takes place on a table top in
Emmy’s laboratory in the reference frame O. Conservation of momentum tells her that
m1v1 + m2v2 = M1V1 + M2V2.
The same process is observed by Karl who sees Emmy and her lab move in the positive
direction with velocity v. Therefore everything that moves in Emmy’s lab appears to move
faster by v, for example m1 moves with a speed v1 + v relative to Karl.6 For him, the
conservation of momentum becomes
m1(v1 + v) + m2(v2 + v) = M1(V1 + v) + M2(V2 + v),
or
m1v1 + m2v2 + (m1 + m2)v = M1V1 + M2V2 + (M1 + M2)v.
Emmy’s conservation law equates the ﬁrst two terms on the left-hand side to the ﬁrst two
terms on the right-hand side. It follows that
(m1 + m2)v = (M1 + M2)v
or
m1 + m2 = M1 + M2,
i.e., the total mass does not change in a collision. We thus have the following important
result
Box 28.4.1. In any classical process (be it a collision or a chemical reaction) in which
masses of the participating objects change, in addition to the conservation of classical
momentum, the initial total mass must equal the ﬁnal total mass. This is restated by
saying that the total mass is conserved in a classical reaction.
28.4.2
The Relativistic Case
Now look at the process of Figure 28.3 from a relativistic viewpoint. We can go through
the same argument as above, but use the relativistic law of addition of velocities to come up
with a relativistic version of Box 28.4.1. This turns out to be very complicated. The easier
way is to use the Lorentz transformations for momentum and energy as given in Equation
(28.5). Math Note E.28.6 on page 134 of Appendix.pdf shows that
Box 28.4.2. In any relativistic process (be it a collision or a nuclear reaction) in which
masses of the participating objects change, in addition to the conservation of relativistic
momentum, the initial total energy must equal the ﬁnal total energy; i.e., the total
energy is conserved in a relativistic reaction.
6The law of addition of velocities hold in a classical process.

This does not say anything about the conservation of mass. In fact, Example D.28.4 on
page 61 of Appendix.pdf shows that mass is not conserved in a relativistic reaction:
What do you know? 28.5. Two “particles,” each having a mass of 1 kg, move at

Equation (E.108) shows that ubx = γbvb and ubt = γbc, where γb = 1/
√
1 −0.92
or γb = 2.29416. Thus, ubx = 2.29416 × 0.9c, or ubx = 2.0647c, and ubt = 2.29416c. The
components of the spacetime velocity of the bullet relative to Karl can be obtained from
Equation (28.2), with γ and β being related to the relative speed of Emmy and Karl. With
this relative speed being 0.6c, β is 0.6 and γ turns out to be 1.25. So,
u′
bx = 1.25(2.0647c + 0.6 × 2.29416c) = 4.3015c,
u′
bt = 1.25(0.6 × 2.0647c + 2.29416c) = 4.4162c.
The invariant length according to Emmy is (2.29416c)2 −(2.0647c)2, which is very nearly
c2. Similarly, the invariant length according to Karl is (4.4162c)2 −(4.3015c)2, which is also
very nearly c2.
28.3.
Classically, the required energy, ∆E, is just the diﬀerence between the initial and
ﬁnal KE. Since the car starts from rest, this is just the ﬁnal KE, which, with m = 1000 kg
and v = 2.997 × 108, gives ∆E = 4.49 × 1019 J. Relativistically, the required energy, ∆E,
is the diﬀerence between the initial and ﬁnal energy. However, the initial energy is not
zero, it is the rest energy mc2 or 9 × 1019 J. The ﬁnal energy is given by Equation (28.4)
with γb corresponding to a speed of 0.999c, or γb = 22.366. This gives a ﬁnal energy of
2.013 × 1021 J. So, ∆E = 1.9 × 1021, considerably larger than the classical value.
28.4.
Altogether a mass of 1 kg is converted into energy. So, E = mc2 gives 9 × 1016 J.
Since each second Enterprise uses 107 J of energy, 9 × 1016 J will last 9 × 109 seconds,
or (noting that there are approximately 31.5 million seconds in a year) approximately 285
years.

The two particles have equal and opposite momenta. So, their total momentum is
zero. Therefore, the ﬁnal particle will be at rest. The initial energy is twice the energy of
each particle, or twice γbmc2, with γb corresponding to a speed of 0.9c, or γb = 2.29. This
gives a total energy of 4.13 × 1017 J, which is the rest energy of the ﬁnal particle. Dividing
this energy by c2 gives the mass M of the ﬁnal particle: M = 4.59 kg.

Chapter29
General Theory of Relativity
The special theory of relativity (STR), as we presented it in the previous chapters, deals
mostly with inertial reference frames. Only Chapter 27 brieﬂy considered noninertial RFs,
but did not talk about how the laws of physics would look like in such RFs. Furthermore,
although the entire discussion of STR was based on inertial RFs, it did not give any in-
structions as to how to build one. It is the task of the general theory of relativity (GTR)
to do so.
29.1
The Equivalence Principle
In describing inertial frames, Section 25.2.1 outlined how the acceleration of an RF relative
to the ground translated into the acceleration of objects in the RF relative to the RF itself.
What eﬀect does the acceleration of an RF have on the motion of objects inside the RF?
Emmy decides to ﬁnd out. To avoid complications arising from gravity and contact forces,
she takes the RF (a rocket) to outer space, far from any planets and stars, and places an
apple inside the RF [see Figure 29.1(a)]. The rocket, the apple, and Emmy (not shown)
all ﬂoat in space, and no force exists to pull or push the apple. The apple ﬂoats inside the
rocket, and as Emmy gives it a jolt, it starts to move with constant velocity until it hits
the wall of the rocket. Emmy, invoking Box 25.2.2, concludes that the ﬁrst law of motion
holds in the rocket frame; it is an inertial RF.
To experience the eﬀect of the acceleration of the rocket on the motion of the apple,
Emmy triggers the boosters. Three snapshots of the subsequent motion [Figure 29.1(b)]
explain what Emmy sees in the rocket. The apple, unaware of the thrust of the boosters,
stays put in its location in space. The rocket accelerates “upward” with its bottom (ﬂoor)
catching up with the apple, ﬁrst slowly, later faster, until it hits the apple. Inside, things
look diﬀerently. The apple, ﬂoating in midair before the boost, appears to be moving toward
the ﬂoor of the rocket; ﬁrst slowly, later faster, until it hits the ﬂoor of the rocket. It drops
to the ﬂoor, as if there were gravity in the rocket!
But wait! We cannot call any apparent acceleration “gravity.” To qualify for this special
label, the acceleration must be independent of the object. Only if an apple and an orange
experience exactly the same acceleration can it be said that they are being gravitated. Place
an orange next to the apple in the ﬁrst snapshot of Figure 29.1(b); it will remain next to the
apple in the other two snapshots and all the untaken snapshots in between. The rocket will
hit both at the same time. Inside, both the apple and the orange will hit the ﬂoor at the
same time, reminiscent of Galileo’s famous leaning-tower-of-Pisa experiment. Emmy will,
of course, also experience the same acceleration. If she is initially ﬂoating in the middle of
the rocket in a squatting position, she will fall to the ﬂoor, unfolding herself to land on her

has all the signs and signatures of gravity.
Box 29.1.1. To create a (artiﬁcial) gravitational acceleration (or force) in a given
direction in a reference frame, accelerate the frame in the opposite direction.
Now take the rocket to a region of space where a gravitational ﬁeld is operating, say
close to a planet. Shut oﬀthe boosters to allow the rocket RF to fall freely. Discover that all
traces of the gravitational ﬁeld have disappeared! Box 29.1.1 gives us an explanation: when
the RF falls freely, it is accelerating in the direction of the gravitational ﬁeld, creating a
new (artiﬁcial) gravitational acceleration in the opposite direction; this acceleration cancels
the existing gravitational acceleration of the planet, so that no acceleration remains inside
the RF. Another equivalent explanation is what we have already encountered in Section
9.3: that gravity pulls all objects with the same acceleration, causing the RF as well as
everything inside it to fall at exactly the same rate, and giving the appearance of the
absence of any force.1
What do you know? 29.1. A space station is in the shape of a giant bicycle wheel
as shown, where people live in the tube of the wheel. To create an artiﬁcial gravity, it
is set to rotate. Which direction does the artiﬁcial gravity point?
Emmy, being inside a freely falling RF and noticing that objects ﬂoat in midair, tries
a little experiment: she jerks the apple and notices that it moves on a straight line with
constant speed all the way to the wall of the rocket. The ﬁrst law of motion holds in her
RF; hers seems to be an inertial reference frame. Earlier, when she was in outer space away
from the inﬂuence of planets and stars, she experienced exactly the same thing. She cannot
ﬁnd any diﬀerence between her freely falling RF and her RF when she was far into space.
Emmy is experiencing the equivalence principle:
The equivalence
principle.
1Gravity is the only force with this special property. No other force in nature pulls all objects at the
same rate. For example, the electric force on an object depends on the electric charge the object carries.
Even if two objects have the same charge, their electric acceleration depends on their masses: the heavier
object acquires a smaller acceleration.

Section 29.2
Consequences of Equivalence Principle
429
Figure 29.2: The apple moves toward the center of the rocket as both fall toward the center of the
planet.
Box 29.1.2. (The equivalence principle) All small freely falling reference frames
are inertial. A small accelerated RF is indistinguishable from an RF, in which there
exists a gravitational ﬁeld.
The ﬁrst part of the equivalence principle answers the question which the special theory
of relativity could not answer. The second part summarizes the fact that you can create
gravity in an RF by accelerating it, and that you can eliminate gravity by letting the RF
fall freely.
The word small has a signiﬁcance worth exploring. The large RF of Figure 29.2 falls
freely toward a planet. The apple, being pulled to the center of the planet along the dashed
line, moves toward the center of the RF without any push or pull as the RF falls. The RF
appears to have a ﬁctitious force, and it is not qualiﬁed for an inertial frame. The source of
the problem is just the size of the RF. If we shrink the RF to a very small size (compared
to the planet’s), everything will (almost) fall along the solid line and no object will move
relative to the RF; the RF becomes inertial. For this reason, the equivalence principle is
local: it applies only to local (i.e., small) RFs as opposed to global (i.e., large or inﬁnite)
RFs.
What do you know? 29.2. How long should the rocket be so that the angle between
the dashed line and the solid line in Figure 29.2 is one degree? Assume that the rocket
is two Earth radii from the Earth center. Hint: The ratio of the side opposite the angle
to the side adjacent to the angle gives the angle in radian, where each radian is 57.3
degrees.
29.2
Consequences of Equivalence Principle
The general theory of relativity starts with the equivalence principle, but goes far beyond
it. Nevertheless, the equivalence of gravity and acceleration of RFs makes it possible to
learn qualitatively some of the outcomes of GTR without a detailed (and necessarily math-
ematical) understanding of the latter. This section introduces some of these outcomes.

Figure 29.3: (a) The apple, thrown at A towards B, moves on a straight line to B. (b) The apple is
thrown towards B, and it moves on a straight line in space, but rocket’s acceleration moves the ﬂoor of
the rocket closer to the apple. (c) The path of the apple as it appears inside the rocket.
29.2.1
Bending of Light
Throw an apple in outer space; it moves on a straight line with constant velocity until it
hits something. Throw it inside a rocket ﬂoating in outer space; it again moves on a straight
line with constant velocity until it hits the side of the rocket. And if the rocket is not in
outer space, but is freely falling, the outcome is the same, because both RFs are inertial by
the equivalence principle. This is illustrated in Figure 29.3(a).
Now start the booster engines and throw the apple from one side of the rocket to the
other. Figure 29.3(b) shows three snapshots of the subsequent motion of the apple and
the rocket. Although the apple moves on a straight line in space (along the dashed line
in the ﬁgure), the rocket’s acceleration moves the ﬂoor of the rocket closer to the apple.
Instead of hitting point B on the other side of the rocket, the apple hits the wall at a point
below B. To an observer inside the rocket the path of the ball is that of Figure 29.3(c):
the acceleration of the RF has caused a bending of the path of the apple. Invoking the
equivalence principle, we conclude that gravity bends the path of the apple. But this is a
roundabout way of discovering a truth that every child experiences on Earth! What was
the purpose of this exercise?
Replace the apple with a beam of light. In the absence of any acceleration, light travels
from A to B on a straight line exactly like the apple (albeit much faster). After starting
the boosters, light travels along the straight dashed line in space as the apple did in the
previous experiment. In the (very small) time it takes light to go from A to B, the ﬂoor of
the rocket gets nearer the dashed line, causing the beam to hit the other side of the rocket
somewhat below B, just as in the apple case (although not as far from B as the apple did).
The acceleration of the RF has caused a bending of the path of the light beam. Invoking
the equivalence principle, we conclude that
Box 29.2.1. Gravity bends the path of light.
And this is deﬁnitely not a commonplace conclusion!
In retrospect, one should expect the bending of light from Newtonian gravity. Although
the Newtonian gravitational force on light (a photon) may be zero because its mass is zero,
a photon can be expected to accelerate in a gravitational ﬁeld because this acceleration is
independent of mass: If all objects accelerate identically in a gravitational ﬁeld regardless
of their masses, it is natural to assume that a photon accelerates the same way.

Figure 29.4: (a) A light beam bends in a gravitational ﬁeld. The length of the line segment joining
the two dots in the ﬁgure is what we calculated in Example 29.2.2. (b) The deﬂection angle is the angle
between initial and ﬁnal velocity vectors. The angle is exaggerated a great deal; it is very small for ordinary
gravitational ﬁelds.
Example 29.2.2. The width of a rocket having an acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 is 10 m. We throw
an apple from A (see Figure 29.3) with a speed of 25 m/s (about 56 mph).
Q1: How long does it take the apple to get to B?
A1: Time is distance divided by speed. So, it takes the apple 10/25 = 0.4 s to get to the other
side.
Q2: How far below B does the apple hit the other side?
A2: Recall that the (vertical) distance an object travels when it has a (vertical) acceleration
a is 1
2at2. Since the apple’s vertical acceleration relative to the rocket is 9.8 m/s2 and it covers the
vertical distance in exactly the same time that it covers the horizontal distance AB, it falls below
B by 1
2 × 9.8(0.4)2 m, i.e., 0.784 m.
Now we send a beam of light across the rocket from A to B.
Q3: How long does it take the light to get to B?
A3: Light is moving a lot faster than the apple, but the time of its travel is given as before:
distance divided by speed. This gives 10/3 × 108 = 3.33 × 10−8 s.
Q4: How far below B does the beam of light hit the other side?
A4: The vertical distance is still 1
2at2. In the case of light this is 1
2 × 9.8(3.33 × 10−8)2 m, or
5.4 × 10−15 m. For comparison, the size of the atom is about 10−10 m! So this “bending of light”
is completely unobservable.
■
The example above illustrates how small the bending of light is for ordinary accelerations
(or gravitational ﬁelds) and distances. To enlarge this bending one has to pass light over a
very long distance in a very strong gravitational ﬁeld. A way of measuring the bending is
to ﬁnd the angle between the original direction of the light signal and its direction where
it is detected. Figure 29.4(a) shows the bending of a light beam in a uniform gravitational
ﬁeld. The distance between the two dots is what was calculated in Example 29.2.2. What
we really want is the angle ϕ between the initial and ﬁnal directions of motion. Math
Note E.29.1 on page 134 of Appendix.pdf ﬁnds a formula for this angle and calculates
it for the numbers of Example 29.2.2: it is less than a billionth of an arc second! It also
calculates the deﬂection angle of light on the surface of a white dwarf, with a gravitational
acceleration of a million m/s2, when the light travels a distance of 1000 km: it is 2.3 arc
seconds. So, to see a noticeable bending of light, you need to go on something like a white
dwarf with an enormous gravitational acceleration, and throw a light beam across a fairly
long distance.
Isn’t it possible to see the light deﬂection for an ordinary object like the Sun with an
acceleration of about 270 m/s2? Math Note E.29.2 on page 135 of Appendix.pdf shows
that the angle of deﬂection, i.e., the angle between the path of light before approaching a
spherical celestial body and the path after receding from it is

body. For the Sun, M⊙= 2 × 1030 kg and R = 7 × 108 m, giving ϕ = 0.874 arc second.
29.2.2
Gravitational Doppler Shift
A rocket is cruising in space with its boosters turned oﬀ. A ﬂashlight at its top sends a
beam of light, which gets detected by a device at the bottom [see Figure 29.5(a)]. The
wavelengths at the source and at the detector are of course the same, because neither the
source nor the detector change their velocity: there is no Doppler shift.
Karl, the rocket pilot, turns on the boosters, and the rocket starts to accelerate [Fig-
ure 29.5(b)]. The ﬂashlight emits a light beam. A fraction of a second later the beam is
detected at the bottom of the rocket. But during this time the velocity of the rocket has
changed. The beam leaves the source when the speed of the entire rocket (including the
source) is, say v; it arrives at the detector when the speed of the entire rocket (including
the detector) is, say v + ∆v. Thus, as far as light is concerned, there is a diﬀerence of
Blue shifted means
wavelength has
decreased.
∆v between the source speed and the detector speed, and this diﬀerence is opposite to
the direction of light motion, i.e., toward the source. Therefore, light “thinks” that the
detector “approaches” the source, and the detected wavelength must be shorter than the
original wavelength. We say that the light beam is blue shifted, because blue is at the
short-wavelength end of the visible spectrum (see Figure 14.4 in Chapter 14).
Figure 29.5(c) shows the case where the source is “chasing” the detector. Once again, let
the speed of the source at the time of emission be v and that of the detector at the time of
detection v + ∆v. Thus, as far as light is concerned, there is a diﬀerence of ∆v between the
source speed and the detector speed, this time in the direction of light travel, i.e., away from
the source. Therefore, the detected wavelength is longer than the original light wavelength.
Red shifted means
wavelength has
increased.
We say that the light beam is red shifted, because red is at the long-wavelength end of
the visible spectrum.2
The last two paragraphs tell us that light (or any EM wave) moving in an accelerated
RF undergoes a Doppler shift: EM waves traveling opposite to the acceleration direction
are blue-shifted; those traveling in the direction of acceleration are red-shifted. But our
real goal is to see the eﬀect of gravity on the wavelength of EM waves.
Invoking the
equivalence principle and recalling that the gravitational ﬁeld is in the opposite direction
to the acceleration to which it is equivalent, we arrive at
2A more appropriate nomenclature would be gamma-shifted and radio-shifted, as gamma rays and radio
waves have, respectively, the shortest and the longest wavelengths in the entire EM spectrum.

Section 29.2
Consequences of Equivalence Principle

Box 29.2.3. Electromagnetic waves are blue shifted when moving in the direction of a
gravitational ﬁeld, and red shifted when moving opposite to it.
It is interesting to note that quantum physics, which is totally unrelated to GTR, pre-
dicts the same qualitative result. When a photon (a particle of EM waves) “falls” in a
gravitational ﬁeld it gains energy (just like a ball falling), i.e., its energy at the bottom of
its fall is larger than at the top. The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its
wavelength. Therefore, a photon must have a shorter wavelength at the bottom than at
the top. And this applies to all the photons in an EM wave, i.e., to the EM wave itself.
Similarly, when one “throws” an EM wave “uphill,” i.e., opposite to the gravitational ﬁeld,
it loses energy, and its wavelength increases.
Box 29.2.3 tells of the existence of the Doppler eﬀect when EM waves move in a grav-
itational ﬁeld. Does a red light “dropped” from a mountain top appear blue at the foot
of the mountain? How strong is the Doppler shift? Math Note E.29.3 on page 135 of
Appendix.pdf develops a formula and Example D.29.1 on page 62 of Appendix.pdf shows
how tiny the eﬀect is on Earth.
29.2.3
Gravitational Time Dilation
The gravitational Doppler eﬀect discussed above leads directly to another intriguing result.
The change in the wavelength must be accompanied by a change in the frequency (or,
equivalently, the period), because the speed of the EM wave is constant. It follows therefore,
that gravity changes the period of the EM waves. But the period of an EM wave is simply
a length of time.3 The conclusion is that time is aﬀected by gravity. There is another route
to discovering the eﬀect of gravity on time. Section 27.6 showed how time slows down for
accelerated RFs. It follows from the equivalence principle that
Box 29.2.4. Gravity slows down clocks.
Clocks in stronger gravitational ﬁelds run
slower than those in weaker ﬁelds.

tional time dilation and shows how it depends on height or distance from the center of the

gravitating object. When you are in space, the notion of height (and the related concept
of the gravitational potential) acquires new meaning: If the ﬁeld lines point from P1 to P2,
then by deﬁnition, height and potential of P1 is larger than height and potential of P2.
Example D.29.2 on page 62 of Appendix.pdf shows that the eﬀect of (ordinary)
gravity on time is very small: after a year, a clock on top of Mount Everest runs only
3 × 10−5 s faster than a clock at the sea level! This is so small that even the most accurate
clocks on the shelves of your favorite electronic store fail to measure it. Any two such clocks
will diﬀer by a lot more than a few 10−5 s in as little as one day, even if they are ticking next
to each other! Atomic clocks are, however, super accurate: they can keep time with an
accuracy of a few seconds in 10 million years, or a fraction of a microsecond (10−6 second)
in a year. Such clocks are indeed suﬃciently accurate to measure time intervals of the order
of 10−5 s (10 microseconds).
3In fact, a second is now deﬁned to be 9,192,631,770 times the period of vibration of radiation from the

Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity
The equivalence principle equates gravity with acceleration, but does not tell us anything
about how either of them is produced. In his attempt to reconcile Newtonian gravity with
the special theory of relativity, Einstein created the general theory of relativity (GTR),
one of the most elegantly encompassing theories produced by humankind. His fundamental
idea was to focus on the behavior of the path of freely falling objects. Why? Because
Einstein believed that the independence of the gravitational motion of objects from their
size and structure, had a geometric characterization, a property that was part of the fabric
of spacetime.

To appreciate the geometric nature of gravity refer to Figure 29.6(a). According to the ﬁrst
law of motion objects should remain at rest in an inertial frame if they are not moving to
begin with and no forces are acting on them. Equivalence principle designates the rocket of
the ﬁgure as an inertial frame because it is in free fall. Yet the two apples that are initially
at the two ends of the rocket tend to move towards each other for no apparent reason!
From the point of view of spacetime geometry, the two apples are at rest and no forces are
acting on them; therefore, they should remain at rest and their worldlines in the coordinate
system of the rocket (with origin at the center of the rocket) should look like the dashed
lines of Figure 29.6(b). However, their actual worldlines look more like the solid curves of
that ﬁgure. The size of the rocket is, of course, the reason for this observably large deviation.
Reducing the size of the rocket, although diminishing the eﬀect, will not completely erase
it. How can one explain this “deviation” of inertial worldlines?
To understand the deviation of inertial worldlines, conﬁne yourself to a two-dimensional
surface such as a perfectly smooth table top. Place two small disks on the table and note that
they don’t move. Push them slightly in parallel directions; each will move on a straight line,
and these straight lines will keep their distance from one another. No deviation of inertial
paths!
Einstein argued that in a curved “tabletop” such as the one shown in Figure 29.6(c),
the straightest possible paths will deviate after a while even though you start them parallel.
Thus if you could build a spherical tabletop and you could conﬁne the disks to this table,
the disks would move along the great circles, the straightest possible paths, the inertial
paths; but these paths get closer together (they deviate).
This deviation is, of course,

due to the inherent curvature of the two-dimensional space of the tabletop. Einstein then
made the bold and sweeping assumption that the deviation of the apples’ worldlines in
Figure 29.6(b) and the deviation of the straight lines in Figure 29.6(c) are exactly of the
same kind. Gravity is related to the curvature of spacetime. He then resorted to the classical
gravity and noted that the source of gravity is mass. Since mass and energy are equivalent
Einstein equation.
in relativity, Einstein generalized the source of gravity to energy (which includes mass via
E = mc2). He then wrote an elegant mathematical equation, the Einstein equation,
which we reproduce in Figure 29.7.
The left-hand side of Einstein equation describes curvature and the way distances are
deﬁned in spacetime (R is the symbol for curvature and g for a recipe of how to ﬁnd
the shortest distance between two spacetime points); the right-hand side is energy (mass
included).
Unlike classical gravity, in which space is a predeﬁned entity with matter moving in it
under the inﬂuence of the gravitational forces, Einstein equation ties the matter (the right-
hand side of the equation) and the spacetime (the left-hand side of the equation) together:
matter determines the structure of the spacetime, and the spacetime determines how matter
moves in that structure. In short, Einstein equation says:
Box 29.3.1. Gravity is a manifestation of the curvature of spacetime. Matter tells
spacetime how to curve; spacetime tells matter how to move.
29.3.2
Experimental Tests of GTR
The simplicity of the idea on which the general theory of relativity is based, and the elegant
geometrical soil, in which the theory is planted, make GTR one of the most encompassing
theories of all time. It was this simplicity and elegance that prompted Einstein, normally
a modest and down-to-earth person, to refer to GTR as so magniﬁcent that he would have
been “sorry for dear God” had any experimental result contradicted it. The ultimate test
of any theory is, of course, observation. But elegance and simplicity are great indicators of
the validity of a theory: if a theory is based on simple assumptions and is also expressed in
terms of “elegant mathematics,” chances are that it is correct. General theory of relativity
enjoys both of these criteria.
Many rigorous experimental tests of the GTR have been
conducted, and every time the theory has emerged triumphant. Here is a partial list.

Precession of the Perihelion of Mercury
Newton’s theory of gravity predicts a perfectly elliptical orbit for a single planet going
around the Sun (see Math Note E.10.2 for details). If the solar system consisted only of the
Sun and the planet Mercury, the latter’s orbit would—according to Newtonian theory of
gravity—be an ellipse on which Mercury would be moving over and over again for eternity
[Figure 29.8(a)].
In the real solar system, the other planets perturb the perfect ellipticity of Mercury’s
orbit. This perturbation had been calculated by the middle of the nineteenth century, and
it had been shown that the overall eﬀect of the perturbation was the precession of the
perihelion of Mercury. This means that every time Mercury completes its revolution, its
orbit tilts ever so slightly. Figure 29.8(b) shows a hugely exaggerated version of this tilt.
Suppose that in some revolution, Mercury’s perihelion (the point of its orbit nearest the
Sun) is horizontal. The second time Mercury comes around, its perihelion will be shifted
slightly, so that the line joining the Sun to the new location of the perihelion makes a small
angle with the horizontal (the previous perihelion). Figure 29.8(b) shows the angle for the
farthest point of orbit for clarity (this angle is equal to the angle that perihelion makes with
the horizontal).
As Mercury repeatedly revolves around the Sun, the perturbation of the other planets
causes its perihelion to change further and further, each time making a slightly larger angle
with the horizontal. After a very long time, the perihelion will have advanced to a large
angle. How long and how large? In 1859, the French astronomer Leverrier calculated this
advance to be 531 seconds of arc per century! A second of arc is 1/3600 degree; and for
comparison, an angle of one degree has been drawn in Figure 29.8(c).
Thus, over 100
years of revolution, Mercury’s perihelion advances by about 1/7 degree, or 1/7 of the angle
shown in part (c) of the ﬁgure. A very small eﬀect indeed! But not small enough to go
undetected. In fact, not only did Leverrier calculate this small number, but he was able to
compare his result with the observations of the previous 300 years and detect a discrepancy.
Those observations led to a value of 574 seconds of arc per century. This disagreement
of 43 seconds of arc was a puzzle for astronomers and physicists until 1915 when Einstein
introduced the GTR and calculated the orbit of Mercury in the absence of other planets.
GTR predicted that if Mercury were the only planet going around the Sun, it would not
move on a perfect ellipse, but its perihelion should advance approximately 43 seconds of arc
per century!

Bending of Light
The equivalence principle predicts the bending of a beam of light in a gravitational ﬁeld, and
Example 29.2.2 calculates the magnitude of this eﬀect when light bends in a gravitational
ﬁeld (acceleration) of 9.8 m/s2 over a distance of 10 m. To be measurable, the bending of
light must occur over a larger distance in a stronger gravitational ﬁeld. However, the predic-
tion of the equivalence principle is not expected to match the experimental measurement,
even at the large distance and strong gravity limit. The reason is that the equivalence prin-
ciple does not incorporate the curvature of spacetime. The Einstein equation, on the other
hand, predicts a bending of light that is twice that predicted by the equivalence principle,
and its veriﬁcation by astronomical observation is one of the most exciting chapters in the
history of science.
Einstein had been working on the eﬀect of gravity on light since 1911 using mainly the
equivalence principle. He was also aware of the possibility of measuring the eﬀect. By 1915,
in which year he discovered the general theory of relativity, he had calculated the amount
of bending when a star light grazed the Sun and was detected on Earth. In Figures 29.9(a)
and 29.9(b), the light rays from two stars A and B are shown to be received by Earth
at a certain location on its orbit around the Sun. The angular separation α between the
two stars can be measured and recorded. Six months later, the Earth moves to a location
“behind” the Sun. The light rays coming from A to this new location of the Earth graze
the Sun and bend. The light rays coming from B stay farther from the Sun and bend much
less. Figure 29.9(c) shows the bending of these light rays. The amount of bending has been
exaggerated in the ﬁgure so you can see the details of the eﬀect.
The observer or the instrument receiving the rays from A and B records the angular
separation as β, because this is the angle that the two rays make with one another on
Earth. It, therefore, appears as if A’s location has been shifted to A′. A comparison of the
photographic images of the two stars taken at the Earth’s two locations should reveal this
relativistic bending of light, and with calibration, it can quantitatively measure this eﬀect
for verifying the theory.
There is, however, a catch. While taking a picture of the positions of the stars A and B in
the night sky of Figure 29.9(a) poses no problem, recording the positions of the stars in the
sky of Figure 29.9(c) is impossible: no stars are visible when the Sun is in the sky! Well, not
quite impossible. If we could block the sunlight so much so that—at least momentarily—a
darkness as black as the night could fall on Earth, we might be able to detect the bent light
rays. Such blockades of the Sun’s light occur naturally and periodically; they are called
eclipses of the Sun!
Upon the urging of Einstein himself in 1916, astronomers developed a keen interest in
verifying the GTR’s 1915 prediction of the bending of starlights. By early 1919 attention
was focused on the total eclipse of the Sun predicted to occur in May 1919 in the southern
hemisphere. Arthur Eddington, a British astronomer set out on two expeditions that took
him and his team to Sobral, Brazil, and to Principe, an island oﬀthe coast of West Africa.
At both these sites, the British astronomers were able to photograph the separation of two
stars—the rays of one of which grazed the Sun—and compare the result with the separa-
tion of the same stars 6 months earlier. Their result veriﬁed Einstein’s general relativistic
calculations!
As mentioned before, the equivalence principle (EP) is only the ﬁrst step towards the
general theory of relativity. Applied to the bending of light, EP, which does not go beyond

the Newtonian mechanics, yields Equation (29.1), and for the Sun, an angle of 0.874 arc-
second. Einstein’s GTR, on the other hand, predicts a value that is twice that given in
Equation (29.1), and a bending of light due to the Sun’s gravity equal to 1.75 arcseconds.
This factor of two comes from the curvature of spacetime that is naturally accommodated
in the GTR. Thus, the 1919 measurement did not simply verify the bending of light, it
provided evidence for the curvature of spacetime as proposed by Einstein in his GTR.

version of (a). (c) In the day sky of Earth, rays coming from A and reaching the Earth have to bend toward
the Sun, while those from B are more or less unaﬀected, because they don’t get close to the Sun. The
result is a reduction of the angular separation to β. The amount of bending has been exaggerated to show
the details.
Modern technology has enabled physicists to test the bending of electromagnetic waves
(of which light is an example) as they graze the Sun. In one experiment, a radar signal
was sent to a planet such as Venus in two diﬀerent ways: just before Venus went behind
the Sun as seen from Earth and when the Sun was far away from the radar path. It takes
the radar slightly longer to traverse the bent path than the straight path. The experiment
measured the diﬀerence in the round-trip travel times of these two cases and compared the
result with the GTR’s prediction. Within small experimental errors, GTR’s prediction was
conﬁrmed.
One of the most intriguing conﬁrmations of GTR’s prediction of the bending of light
took place in 1979. As early as 1937, Einstein had predicted a substantial bending of light
in a region of very strong gravitational ﬁeld, much like the bending of light when it passes

through an optical lens (Figure 29.10). He showed that if a large concentration of mass
existed between a light source and Earth, then the extraordinary gravitational ﬁeld of this
mass would bend the light, causing the formation of a double image of the source. This
so-called gravitational lensing was observed in 1979 for the ﬁrst time.
In Figure 29.10 a quasar—a very distant source of very strong radio waves and light,
also known as a quasi stellar radio source—labeled A sends EM signals in all directions. An
extremely massive object M (a giant black hole, for example) blocks the signals that would
have come directly to Earth. However, the strong gravitational ﬁeld of M can bend some
other rays in such a way that a telescope on Earth could detect them. The image would
appear as two quasars A′ and A′′, which look almost identical. The ﬁgure in the margin
shows a real gravitational lens.

Gravitational Waves
Einstein’s GTR equation is a mathematical statement about the eﬀect of energy on the
curvature of spacetime (and vice versa). As long as the source of the energy is static, the
curvature of spacetime remains unchanged. Thus, the orbits of the planets and the bent

path of light are embedded in a static (small) curvature in the vicinity of the Sun. The
universe, however, is brimming with exotic objects; objects with extraordinary accelerations
and gravitational ﬁelds. Such combination of acceleration and gravity makes these objects
a dynamic source of spacetime curvature, a curvature that changes with time, a curvature
undulation, a gravitational wave.
The prediction of the gravitational waves, ripples in the very fabric of spacetime, is one
of the most unexpected and exotic triumphs of GTR. It is as triumphant as the prediction
of the electromagnetic waves in the middle of the nineteenth century. It took about 20
years before a direct conﬁrmation of the EM waves was established in the laboratory. The
experimental conﬁrmation of the gravitational waves has been coming much slower.

waves, their period decreases. Here the change in the period of the binary pulsar 1913 + 16 is measured
over a span of 14 years. The solid line is the curve predicted by the GTR; the dots are observation points.
The ﬁrst indication of the gravitational waves was discovered in the observation of binary
pulsars. A pulsar is a collapsed star, whose small size endows it with an extraordinarily fast
rotation around its axis. The collapse also causes a phenomenal increase in the magnetic
ﬁeld of the star.
This combination (strong magnetic ﬁeld and incredibly fast rotation)
makes the star pulsate radio signals with extreme regularity and accuracy. The ﬁrst pulsar
discovered “beeped” every 1.33733 seconds . . . exactly! This accuracy led some people to
believe that the beeps were signals sent by some alien civilization.

each acting as a “planet” of the other [see Figure 29.11(a)]. The accuracy of their pulsation
helps astronomers keep track of the motion of the pulsars. In particular, it is possible to
measure the period of their rotation precisely.
The interest in the binary pulsars arose
because of general relativity’s prediction that they should emit gravitational waves due to
their mutual rotation. Based on this theory, the energy carried by the waves should cause a
decrease in the period, very much like the decrease in the period of the planetary model of
the atom discussed at the beginning of Section 21.3. The change in the period is very small
for short intervals of time, but over many years this change can accumulate to measurable
quantities.
Figure 29.11(b) shows the decrease in the period of the binary pulsar 1913 + 16 over a
span of 14 years.4 A comparison of the GTR’s prediction (the solid curve) and observation
(the dots) reveals the exceptional accuracy of GTR. Figure 29.11 is also a testament to the
phenomenal advances made in instrumentation: to be able to measure the period of two
stars as they pirouette around one another to within a few seconds is indeed remarkable.
Although the indirect evidence of the diminishing period of a binary pulsar as described
above is fairly convincing, almost a century after their prediction, a direct evidence for
the gravitational waves is still lacking, due entirely to the expected weakness of the signal
to be detected. Nevertheless, a global eﬀort is underway to catch the ﬁrst glimpse of a
gravitational wave signal coming from the explosion of a supernova or the collision of two
black holes.

detect the extraordinarily dim signal received on Earth thousands of years after a cata-
clysmic event took place at a cosmic distance. LIGO employs an L-shaped 4-foot diameter
vacuum pipe with 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) arms (Figure 29.12). Unlike EM waves, gravita-
tional waves penetrate even the thickest material unimpeded. Therefore, LIGO detectors
need not be “looking” at the sky. In fact, they are entirely shielded in a concrete cover. At
the vertex of the L, and at the end of each of its arms, are mirror surfaces, which are the
sensors of gravitational waves.
When the gravitational waves pass through LIGO’s L-shaped detector they will cause
such a ripple in the space (and the time) surrounding the detector as to decrease the distance
between the mirrors in one arm of the L, while increasing it in the other. These changes are
minute: just 10−16 centimeters (or a hundred million times smaller than the diameter of a
hydrogen atom) over the 4-kilometer length of the arm. As small as this diﬀerence is, it is
suﬃcient to cause a detectable interference between the two laser beams that recombine at

the vertex of the L after traversing along its two arms.
At least two detectors located at widely separated sites are required for the unequivo-
cal detection of gravitational waves. Local phenomena such as micro-earthquakes, acoustic
noise, and laser ﬂuctuations can cause disturbances that can pass for a gravitational wave
event. This may happen locally at one site, but a simultaneous occurrence of such dis-
turbances is extremely rare at two widely separated sites.
The two sites for the LIGO
observatories are located near Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington.
Although the idea of LIGO was conceived in the late 1970s, only recently have scientists
been able to make their ﬁrst trial runs of the facility; and in a few years, the news of the
arrival of the ﬁrst gravitational wave is expected to make headlines across the globe.
Global Positioning System
One of humankind’s distinguishing traits is exploration. It spurred our most distant an-
cestors out of Africa, the primitive tribes into initial conﬂicts and ﬁnal mergers, the early
civilizations into war and peace, and the medieval sailors to unfamiliar and unknown ter-
ritories. The earliest explorations were conducted at random. Later, they demanded a
guiding mechanism to assure the explorer’s correct choice of path. At the beginning, the
stellar and planetary positions in the sky were the only guides known to humankind. After
the discovery of magnets, compasses became the most eﬀective navigational tools available
to the explorers. And until very recently, they were the only tools used in navigation.
With the advent of satellites a new kind of navigation became possible. The Global
Positioning System (GPS) uses a network of clocks mounted on satellites to pinpoint
the location of a person (called receiver, as he/she is presumed to be carrying a hand-held
GPS “receiver”) on, or above, the Earth surface. The position and time of a receiver are
speciﬁed by four quantities (three spatial coordinates and time). Therefore, if four satellites,
situated at four known locations, send light signals at known times to a receiver, the latter
can calculate his/her coordinates and time by invoking the second postulate of the special
theory of relativity, namely that the distance between the receiver and a satellite is the speed
of light times the time interval between the transmission of the signal from the satellite and
its reception by the receiver.
Precision is the key to the proper working of the GPS. In particular, the clocks must
keep a very accurate time. If one of the clocks deviates by a microsecond (10−6 s), the
coordinates measured will be oﬀby the speed of light times a microsecond or about 300
meters. To avoid an error larger than a meter, the clocks must keep the same time to
within 1/(3 × 108) or 3.3 nanoseconds (a nanosecond is 10−9 s). Such an accuracy must
be maintained in the time intervals between periodic synchronizations.
This leads to a
fractional time stability, ∆t/t, of 10−13. Only atomic clocks can achieve this.
Relativistic eﬀects are much larger than 10−13, and therefore, they must be accounted
for in the design and operation of GPS. For example, a satellite located at 2.5 × 107 m
from the Earth center moves with a speed of about 4000 m/s. A clock carried by this
satellite will run slower than the Earth clock by a factor of 1
2(v/c)2 [see Equation (E.72)].
For v = 4000 m/s, this gives 8.9 × 10−11 which is 890 times larger than the fractional time
stability of 10−13. Gravitational eﬀects are even larger. In fact, Example D.29.2 shows that
for a satellite on this orbit, the gravitational time dilation is 5.1 × 10−10, or 5100 times
larger than the fractional time stability.
Suppose that the designers of GPS were unaware of the importance of relativity, and
to tame the spread of error over long periods of time, they wanted to build a system so
precise that it could locate a receiver to within a centimeter (0.01 m). This requires a
clock accuracy of 0.01/(3 × 108) second or 3.3 × 10−11 second. For simplicity, consider only
the gravitational time dilation, for which ∆t/t ≈5 × 10−10. Then in only t = 0.066 s,
relativistic eﬀects already reach the temporal tolerance level of ∆t = 3.3 × 10−11 second.
Stated equivalently, in only 0.066 second, the relativistic eﬀects achieve the spatial tolerance

442
Chapter 29

level of one centimeter, so that by the passage of every 0.066 second another indeterminacy
of one centimeter is added to the spatial determination of the receiver; and every second
1/0.066 = 15 cm gets added to the uncertainty in the location of the receiver! Therefore, if
relativistic eﬀects were not accounted for, satellite clock errors building up in just one hour
would cause navigational errors of 3600 × 15 centimeters, or about 540 m; and in a single
day this error builds up to over 12 km, rendering the system useless. All this tells us that

GTR and the Universe
The biggest surprise of GTR was its prediction of how the entire universe behaved. How can
any theory predict an entity as complicated as the universe in its entirety? The universe,

with countless galaxies, within each, billions of stars, around each star, numerous planets,
and each planet a complicated world, full of complex material including life! The answer
lies in the spirit of physics itself. Physics can take a simple structure such as a hydrogen
atom and make it so complicated that an entire generation of physicists could spent their
scientiﬁc life studying it and still not get the complete answer. It can also take a complex
structure such as the entire universe and simplify it so much that the laws of physics
become applicable. In the ﬁrst picture, the atom becomes a universe, in the second picture
the universe becomes a collection of tiny particles, each particle a galaxy!
29.4.1
Expansion of the Universe
It was this simplifying assumption that permitted the Russian physicist Aleksandr Alek-
sandrovich Friedmann (1888–1925) to apply the general theory of relativity to the entire
universe. What exactly was his simplifying assumption? Actually there were three underly-
ing assumptions that went into Friedmann universe. He thought of the universe as a dust
cloud, each dust particle being a galaxy. He also assumed that the universe is isotropic
and homogeneous.
Isotropy is the property of the universe that does not allow a preferred direction. Looking
Isotropy explained.
along diﬀerent directions in an isotropic universe you should not be able to detect any
features distinguishing one direction from another. “Wait a minute!” you may say. “I
happen to drive eastward to my work every morning, and I clearly see a Sun in front of me.
But I am pretty sure that there are no suns to my left or right or back! Forget about the
Sun. I am standing on the ﬂoor of my room. I see a huge round sphere beneath me that
I have learned to call ‘Earth,’ but I can’t ﬁnd any Earth in any other direction. How can
you tell me that the universe does not recognize any preferred direction?”
The kind of isotropy we are talking about operates on a very large scale. Remember that
galaxies are “dust particles” of the universe. So the isotropy that goes into the Friedmann
model of the universe is of the kind that operates at intergalactic distances. In fact, galaxies
that are “close,” i.e., that are closer than millions of light years are to be lumped into a single
“dust particle.” Only at separations of hundreds of millions of light years do we begin to see
the isotropy property. Standing behind a giant telescope and looking at the distribution of
“distant” galaxies, you cannot detect any variation of this distribution at diﬀerent angles of
observation. The pattern of Figure 29.13(a) is isotropic at the center, because all directions
are identical. However, it is not isotropic at any other point. Figure 29.13(b) shows a
pattern that is not isotropic at any point, while Figure 29.13(c) shows a pattern that is
isotropic at all points.
Homogeneity is the property that precludes any special or preferred point in the universe.
Homogeneity explained.

that is homogeneous at all points but not isotropic at any point. (c) A pattern that is both isotropic and
homogeneous at all points.
Again, this property operates only at distances larger than hundreds of millions of light
years. This means that the universe looks the same whether you observe it from the Milky
Way5 or any other distant galaxy. It does not look the same if you observe it from Milky
Way as opposed to the Andromeda galaxy, a mere 2 million light years away! Of the three
patterns in Figure 29.13, the ﬁrst is not homogeneous while the second and third are. If you
want to “picture” the Friedmann universe as a pattern, then Figure 29.13(c) is the closest
pattern representing it.
What do you know? 29.4. In a huge forest, trees are in rows parallel to each other.
Is the forest homogeneous or isotropic or both or neither?
When, in 1922, Friedmann solved Einstein’s GTR equation for a homogeneous and
isotropic universe, in which (distant) galaxies were treated as dust particles, he discovered
that the universe must be expanding! Einstein’s reaction to Friedmann’s work was that
Einstein modiﬁes his
beautiful equation.
of disbelief. He thought that Friedmann had made a mistake; and when he realized that
Friedmann’s conclusion was correct, he decided to change the GTR equation, adding a
cosmological constant to it to make the universe static, because no sign of an expanding
universe existed at that time. But when indications of an expanding universe surfaced in
the observations of the American astronomer Edwin Hubble in the late 1920s, Einstein
regretted the addition of the cosmological constant and referred to this mutilation of his
equation as “the biggest blunder of my life.”
What exactly did Hubble observe? Galaxies are made up of some of the same elements
that terrestrial objects are composed of. Each of these elements has its own unique spectral
lines, a ﬁnger print. The motion of a galaxy changes the wavelength of these spectral lines
(measured on Earth) due to the Doppler eﬀect. By measuring the change in the (wavelength
of the) spectral lines of a given element, one can determine the (radial) speed of a galaxy
relative to us as well as the direction of the speed:6 an increase in the wavelength, also
called a red shift, indicates that the galaxy is moving away; a decrease in the wavelength,
called a blue shift, means that the galaxy is approaching. Using the Doppler shift in the
spectral lines of known atoms in many galaxies, Hubble discovered that all distant galaxies
move away from us.

of others, which moves around the center of a galaxy among billions. Homogeneity of the
universe tells us that, from the perspective of any galaxy, the distant galaxies should move
away. How can this be? How can all galaxies see all the other distant galaxies recede? The
following analogy should be helpful.
On a balloon, attach some tiny round stickers (Figure 29.14). Blow into the balloon
and see the distance between any two stickers increase. If there were some two-dimensional
creatures living on one of these stickers, they would see all stickers moving away from them;
and since they cannot dig into the balloon (this would require a sense of a third dimension,
which our creatures lack), they are incapable of seeing the balloon expand. First they would
think they are at the center of the expansion. However, if they are intelligent enough to
think of their “universe” as isotropic and homogeneous, then they would have to conclude
that the only way that all stickers can recede from one another is for the entire balloon
to expand. One extra bonus of this balloon analogy is that the stickers themselves do not
expand.
We live in a three-dimensional “expanding balloon.” Our galaxy plus all the other local
group of galaxies, including our two backyard neighbors, the two Magelanic clouds7 and
the nearby Andromeda galaxy8 constitute our tiny sticker. No distance at this tiny scale
increases. In fact, we know that Andromeda is approaching the Milky Way. However, once
we go beyond the local structures and observe the distant galaxies, they all move away from
us. And since the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, any distant galaxy behaves the
same way, like the stickers on a balloon. We, therefore, have to conclude that the universe
is expanding.
“But if the universe is expanding,” you may say, “it must be expanding into something.”
The universe has no
boundary.
Not at all! Remember that the universe is homogeneous; so no point (on a large scale) can
be diﬀerent from any other point. This prevents the universe from having any edge or

boundary. In order for it to expand into “something” it must have a boundary. Since it
does not, it cannot expand into any “empty space.” The balloon of the two-dimensional
creatures has the same property. It does not have a boundary: if an adventurous two-
dimensional creature starts on a cosmic journey in search of the “edge” of their universe, he
will fail; he’ll be just going round and round the balloon. To us, their entire balloon is an
“edge” separating the inside from the outside. But the two-dimensional creatures have no
sense of a third dimension; their entire world is the surface of the balloon, and this world
gets bigger and bigger, i.e., their two-dimensional space is constantly being created! And
that is precisely what is happening to our universe: as it expands, our universe creates new
space. Let us summarize our ﬁndings so far:
Box 29.4.1. On a large scale (of hundreds of millions of light years), our universe is
expanding. This expansion manifests itself as the recession of all distant galaxies from
one another. The universe has no boundary; therefore, its expansion entails the creation
of new space.
29.4.2
Hubble Law
Homogeneity and isotropy put a severe restriction on the relative speed of two galaxies.
Homogeneity and
isotropy lead to Hubble
Law.
Math Note E.29.5 on page 137 of Appendix.pdf shows that the speed of one galaxy
relative to another must be proportional to the separation between the two. This so-called
Hubble law can be written as
v = Hd,
(29.2)
where H is the Hubble parameter, whose most recent value is observationally found to be
between 21 and 23 km/s per Mly (million light year). This means that for every million light
years increase in distance, the speed of the galaxies increases by 21–23 km/s. The Hubble
law is a consequence of the application of GTR to a homogeneous and isotropic universe.
In fact, GTR yields the result that the speed with which any two points of a homogeneous
and isotropic universe recede from one another is proportional to their separation. That we
have to look at distant galaxies to observe this is a result of the breakdown of homogeneity
and isotropy at small distances.
What do you know? 29.5. A galaxy is 500 Mly away from Earth. How fast is it
moving away from us? Take the Hubble parameter to be 22 km/s per Mly.
The actual value of H is determined only through observation. By looking at the Doppler
shift in the spectral lines (see Section 21.3.1) of elements emanating from galaxies, Edwin
Hubble (1889–1953) discovered that, except for the galaxies neighboring our Milky Way,
the spectral lines coming from all distant galaxies were shifted towards longer wavelengths.
Since this kind of red shift meant a recession (see Example D.29.3 on page 63 of
Appendix.pdf ), he concluded that all distant galaxies were moving away from us, and the
farther they were, the faster they moved, obeying the simple relation of Equation (29.2).
Hubble himself overestimated the constant to a value of about 150 km/s per Mly. Since
then, the observational reﬁnements have been able to narrow the range, very slowly. Even
as late as the late 90s, the value was reported to lie between 12 and 31 km/s per Mly.
However, with the advent of the Hubble Space Telescope, the gap between the upper and
lower limits has been constantly diminishing. The range of values of H quoted above is the
result of the most recent observations (as of July 2008).

29.4.3
Age of the Universe
One of the immediate consequences of the expansion of the universe is its contraction in
the past. If we retrace the size of the universe backward in time, it must get smaller and
smaller as we go further and further in the past.
Box 29.4.2. GTR predicts that at a ﬁnite time in the past, the universe must have
had an inﬁnitesimally small size, indicating the time of the inception of the universe,
or what has come to be known as the big bang.
In fact, the simple Hubble law can give us an approximate age of the universe. If the present
speed of the recession of distant galaxies persisted all the way to the moment of creation,9
then we can obtain the time in the past, when two given galaxies were right “on top of each
other.”
Consider the Milky Way and another distant galaxy separated by some large distance.
How long did it take for the galaxy to reach this distance starting at the same point as the
Milky Way? If the galaxy is moving (and has been moving all this time) with the same
speed, the time it took to reach the current separation is just distance divided by speed.
Example D.29.4 on page 63 of Appendix.pdf follows this line of argument quantitatively
and reaches the conclusion that the time is just the inverse of the Hubble constant: t = 1/H,
independent of the distance. This means that all galaxies have taken this much time to
reach their present position starting at the same point as the Milky Way. It follows that the
inverse of the Hubble constant gives the time in the past at which all galaxies were on top
of each other. Example D.29.4 calculates this time to be between 13 and 14 billion years
for the range of values of the Hubble constant given above.
Recently the age of the universe has been measured very accurately.
Box 29.4.3. The universe is 13.7 billion years old. In other words, the big bang occurred
13.7 billion years ago.
Considering the crude assumptions we made in reaching our estimates, it is remarkable that
we obtained values that do not disagree considerably with the observed age! This agreement
is deceiving. As we shall see in Section 37.2, a more precise calculation of the age of the
universe actually widens the disagreement!

Answers to “What do you know?”
29.1. The acceleration is centripetal (towards the center). Therefore, the artiﬁcial gravity
is centrifugal (away from the center). So, people will be walking inside the tube with their
feet sticking to the outside rim of the tube from inside.
29.2. Denoting the length of the rocket by L and the radius of Earth by R, we want the
ratio of L/2 to 2R to be 1/57.3 radian, or
L
4R =
1
57.3. This gives L = 4R/57.3. With the
radius of Earth being 6400 km, we get L = 447 km or 279 miles!
29.3. A ring.
29.4. As you move in the forest, you see the same view. That is homogeneous! If you turn
and look at the forest at a diﬀerent angle, you see diﬀerent things. That is not isotropic.
9We know that this assumption cannot be true, because the speeds were a lot larger than the present
speeds near the moment of creation.

Chapter30
Epilogue: No “Marketplace”
Quantum physics and relativity are the two pillars of modern physics. Often in this context,
the word “modern” is misused as an antonym of “classical.” The abstract and mathematical
nature of both quantum and relativity theories makes them easy target for abuse in the
hands of the purveyors of mysticism. We shall see some detailed examples of the abuse of
quantum theory in Chapter 35. It will be shown there how New Age authors misrepresent
quantum physics to their readers and use some twisted interpretation of the theory to
advocate a parallel between quantum physics and Eastern mysticism.
Classical physics is more immune from such misinterpretation because (a) it deals with
everyday tangible objects, and (b) the mathematics used in classical physics is less abstract.
There could be no
quantum theory without
classical physics.
The easier accessibility of classical physics plus the negative publicity of technology (atomic
bombs, chemical warfare, nuclear proliferation, etc.) attributed wrongly to science, has
been used by mystics to put a hideous mask on classical physics, making it evil, destructive,
and “mechanistic.” On the other hand, the incomprehensible modern physics can be put
forth to the nonexperts as a gentle, “organic,” and “holistic” science. Chapter 24 showed,
and Chapter 35 will expand on, how fallacious this separation is and how quantum physics
is vitally connected to classical physics. This chapter presents—among other things—the
connection and similarity between relativity and classical physics.
30.1
Continuity
The title of Einstein’s ﬁrst paper on relativity was “On the Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies.” It sounds like a dull paper on electricity and magnetism. Dull, it wasn’t! But it
was a paper on Maxwell’s electromagnetism, and how a moving observer perceives them.
And that is how relativity began.
Relativity is an oﬀspring of Maxwell’s electromagnetism, and as such its umbilical cord
There could be no

classical physics.
is attached to the womb of classical physics. Any claim that relativity and classical physics
have nothing in common is equivalent to the claim that an infant has no connection with
its mother. The essential ingredient in any scientiﬁc discovery is the mastery of the existing
body of knowledge in a given ﬁeld.
If Einstein had not mastered classical mechanics,
classical electromagnetism, classical wave theory, and the mathematics of classical physics,
he would not have been able to discover relativity.
Electromagnetism is not the only “classical” subject that helped the development of
relativity. Many of the concepts deﬁned in classical physics carried over to relativity. For
example, relativistic momentum and energy are generalizations of the corresponding clas-
sical concepts (see Section 28.3). Furthermore, every time a new formula was discovered
in relativity, classical physics was consulted to unravel the true meaning of that formula.

452
Chapter 30
Epilogue: No “Marketplace”
Section 28.3.1 and Math Note E.28.3 are prime examples of how classical physics was crucial
in identifying the “time” component of relativistic momentum as the relativistic energy.
In his general theory of relativity (GTR), Einstein relied heavily on the Newtonian grav-
ity. In fact, as we mentioned in Chapter 29, Einstein experimented with just the equivalence
principle—a direct result of Newtonian gravity—for many years before he stumbled on the
full GTR. More importantly, when he did discover GTR, Newtonian gravity was vital in
writing the Einstein equation (the equation in Figure 29.7).
30.2
Speciﬁcity
Special theory of relativity (STR) embodies a universal statement about space and time.
Every physical theory dealing with the extremely fast has to use this universal relativistic
language of space and time.
Einstein himself used it in his formulation of gravity, and
discovered the general theory of relativity. Dirac used it in his description of a fast elec-
tron, and discovered the existence of antimatter. Weinberg, Salam, and Glashow used it
in their description of the decay of fundamental particles, and, as a result, uniﬁed the
weak and electromagnetic interactions and anticipated the existence and properties of the
massive weak gauge bosons. Gross, Wilczek, and Politzer used it in their description of
the strong interaction among quarks, and discovered quantum chromodynamics and quark
conﬁnement.
Yet all this universality came about because Einstein looked for an answer to a speciﬁc
question: “How do Maxwell’s equations look in moving bodies?” Our treatment of the
STR started by looking at a speciﬁc clock and how motion aﬀected its ticking (see Section
26.1). From that, all the universal conclusions about length contraction and time dilation,
Lorentz transformations, relativistic energy, even E = mc2 followed.
The general theory of relativity was born out of Einstein’s speciﬁc question: “How do
I incorporate STR into gravity theory?” Nevertheless, this child of speciﬁcity predicted
the universal expansion.
Who would have imagined that the answer to such a speciﬁc
question could make such a universal statement as “the universe is expanding,” whose logical
(backward) extension resulted in no less a conclusion than the creation of the universe? Of
course, this is not the ﬁrst time we have encountered this. Every universal statement in
physics (and in all branches of science) stems from a speciﬁc question or a speciﬁc analysis.
No holistic approach has ever resulted in a discovery, because by its very nature it has to
encompass so many variables and parameters that no scientist can handle.
30.3
Use/Creation of Mathematics
Three years after the discovery of STR, the Russian-German mathematician, Hermann
Minkowski delivered an address at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and
Physicians held at Cologne on September 21, 1908. Minkowski began his opening remarks
with the following statement:
The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil
of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth
space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and
only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality. [Ein 52, p. 75]
Minkowski then went on to consider time as a fourth dimension and show that in such a
four-dimensional continuum, a distance could be deﬁned which was intrinsic to the space,
and independent of the coordinates used. In short, he, for the ﬁrst time, derived what we
have been calling the spacetime distance.
Until 1908, the notion of distance between two points had been strictly Euclidean, which,
in terms of the coordinates of the two points, was given by the square root of the sum of

Section 30.4
Induction versus Deduction
453
the squares of the diﬀerence between corresponding coordinates [Equation (E.82) gives a
two-dimensional version of this distance]. The special theory of relativity suggested—to
Hermann Minkowski for the ﬁrst time—the invention of a new kind of geometry with a new
deﬁnition of distance, whose two-dimensional version is given in Box 27.4.1.
The interplay between mathematics and physics is one of the most fruitful enterprises of
humankind. The study of motion and gravity led to the invention of calculus and diﬀerential
equations. The application of the laws of motion to the ﬂuids gave rise to vector calculus
and tensor analysis, whose generalization to the electric and magnetic ﬁelds gave us the EM
waves. STR gave birth to a new notion of distance and a new kind of geometry. On the
other hand, a systematic study of the diﬀerential equations led to the abstract Lie group
theory, which has been indispensable in understanding subatomic particles and forces.1
Moreover, abstract diﬀerential geometry developed by nineteenth century mathematicians,
in combination with Minkowski’s notion of distance, found a natural dwelling in the general
theory of relativity.
30.4
Induction versus Deduction
In his later years, Einstein focused more and more on formalism of relativity theory and
less and less on its experimental success. And this, for good reason: experiments played
no (direct) part in either special, or general theory of relativity. The former was built on
the constancy of the speed of light, which in turn, was a consequence of the electromag-
netic theory. The latter was based on the equivalence principle, which was derived from
Newtonian gravitational theory.
Einstein was, therefore, led to believe that physics was purely deductive; that the future
theories can be built entirely from existing theories.
Although this may be true in the
majority of cases (STR and GTR being prime examples), we cannot ignore the vital role
of experiments in other cases. Maxwell’s electromagnetism is a good example. Maxwell’s
deductive reasoning created the correct set of equations for electromagnetism (see Sections
14.2 and 14.3). Nevertheless, the raw material with which he started was the result of over
three decades of observation and experimentation, and induction thereof. Quantum theory
is another equally good example. Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics and Heisenberg’s matrix
mechanics were created as the two engaged in unraveling the secrets of the hydrogen atom,
with some help from Bohr’s theory. But we should never forget that the structure of the
H-atom—upon which all three theories were based—was purely an experimental outcome:
if Rutherford had not experimented with the gold atoms, we would not have known about
the nucleus of the H-atom, a crucial ingredient in the quantum recipe.
The failure of Einstein in unifying electromagnetic and gravitational forces—an endeavor
that preoccupied him many of his later years—is a testimony to the importance of exper-
iments. In the 1930s and 40s, when Einstein was thinking about such a uniﬁcation, the
other two fundamental (the strong and weak nuclear) forces were neither understood nor
taken seriously. Yet their knowledge is crucial in any attempt at unifying forces, as we shall
see in the next part of the book (see Section 34.2).
A (harmful) side eﬀect of ignoring the inductive process of physics,2 is the Platonic
overemphasis on the mind and the subsequent derailing of the scientiﬁc process.
Plato
thought that all knowledge came from human mind and the human mind alone. Although
he was a staunch supporter of mathematics and geometry, he chided those who experimented
with geometrical shapes. It is, therefore, not surprising that Plato’s philosophy includes
the supernatural elements of Form, Idea, and the Universal Soul.
1See Sections 33.1, 33.2.1, and 34.1 for details.

much like the electromagnetic equations that were discovered as a result of numerous experiments (see also
Chapter 15).

Epilogue: No “Marketplace”
Another (even more harmful) side eﬀect is the lift received by certain social scholars,
who advocate the “marketplace of ideas,” in which any and all competing theories are
sold.

conditions (Section 19.4) compete with the theory of relativity, quantum theory, and the
electroweak uniﬁcation. In this marketplace, observation has no kiosk, and objectivism gets
“deconstructed” by a Derridean literary critique.

On the Experimental Front
Chapter 29 revealed that at a ﬁnite time in the past (about 13.7 billion years ago) the
universe was inﬁnitesimally small. A compression of the material of the universe into an
inﬁnitesimal volume will surely result in extreme conditions of heat, pressure, density, and
energy. At a mere 20 million ◦K in the core of a star, already novel physical processes such
as nuclear fusion take place. The early universe with temperatures running into hundreds
of billions of degrees (and more!) must have been the arena of some of the most spectacular
physical phenomena. To understand such breath-taking happenings, we need to go back to
the early twentieth century and follow two developments seemingly unrelated to the early
universe, one in the experimental investigations of the nucleus, the other, in the theoretical
attempts at combining relativity and the quantum theory. This chapter is devoted to the
experimental front.
31.1
The Nucleon
The discovery of the atomic nucleus by Rutherford and his collaborators was a milestone
in physics. But it was only the tip of the iceberg. As the future generations of physicists
were to discover, the nucleus housed many of the fundamental constituents of the universe.
The scattering of alpha particles from nuclei of atoms revealed not only the existence

of the atomic nucleus, but also its structure. The very particles (α particles) that were
being used to probe the structure of atoms were coming from the nuclei of radioactive
material. So, it was natural to assume that they were the building blocks of all nuclei.
Soon, however, it was found that the lightest atom, hydrogen, could not be made up of such
particles. Rutherford had already shown in 1903 that the α particles were doubly charged.
If the hydrogen nucleus were to be made up of α particles, it had to carry at least two units
of positive charge. However, all attempts at observing a doubly ionized hydrogen atom
failed. All ionized hydrogen atoms carried only one positive unit of charge. Furthermore,
the mass of hydrogen was measured to be smaller than that of an α particle. Rutherford
called the nucleus of the hydrogen atom proton.
What do you know? 31.1. What is the signiﬁcance of not observing a doubly ionized
hydrogen atom, and why does this indicate that its nucleus consists of only one proton?
Other elements had already been placed in the periodic chart according to what had

been vaguely called the atomic number. The connection between the atomic number and
the number of positive charges in the nucleus was proved by a set of experiments that a

student of Rutherford, H. G. J. Moseley (1887–1915), carried out on various elements using
X-rays. In fact, it was through Moseley’s work that the concept of atomic number was made
precise and the location of missing elements in the periodic table accurately identiﬁed.
BIOGRAPHY
Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) was born near Nelson, New Zealand, studied at Nelson College and
won a scholarship to study at Canterbury College, University of New Zealand.
In 1895 Rutherford
traveled to England for postgraduate study at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge. In
1898 Rutherford was appointed to the chair of physics at McGill University where he demonstrated that
radioactivity was the spontaneous disintegration of atoms, the work which gained him the 1908 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. This is ironic given his famous remark “In science there is only physics; all the
rest is stamp collecting.” In 1907 he took the chair of physics at the University of Manchester, where
he discovered the nuclear structure within atoms and was the world’s ﬁrst successful “alchemist”: he
converted nitrogen into oxygen. In 1917 he returned to the Cavendish as Director. Under him, Nobel
Prizes were awarded to Chadwick for discovering the neutron, Cockcroft and Walton for splitting the
atom using a particle accelerator, and Appleton for demonstrating the existence of the ionosphere.
It was now established that the nucleus of an atom of an element contains a number
of protons equal to the atomic number assigned to that element. This number is denoted
by Z.
A neutral atom, therefore, contains an equal number of electrons.
A hydrogen
atom has thus a proton as its nucleus with one electron at a “large” distance (recall—from
Section 21.2—that the nucleus has a very small size compared to the entire atom) from
it. Many subsequent nuclear experiments conﬁrmed the existence of protons. During one
such experiment, in which Rutherford discovered what he called “An Anomalous Eﬀect
in Nitrogen,” he showed that when α particles collide with the nitrogen nucleus, a singly
ionized hydrogen atom is produced, establishing further proof of the reality of proton.
The structure of the nucleus was beginning to take shape except for one piece of the
puzzle. In a 1920 paper entitled “Nuclear Constitution of Atoms,” Rutherford proposed

a second constituent of the nucleus, based on the results of the decisive experiments of
1911–1913. As soon as the atomic nucleus was discovered, and its charge determined, it
was found that the mass of the nucleus (in units of hydrogen mass) was almost twice its
atomic number. This naturally led to the assumption that other particles must be present in
nuclei beside protons; and that these particles must be electrically neutral. This neutrality
prompted Rutherford to suggest that these particles must consist of a proton and a “nuclear
electron.”
While charged particles could be detected by the visible path they left behind in a
detector (a cloud chamber), the neutron—as the neutral particle was to be called later—
was not easily detectable. Many experiments designed speciﬁcally to ﬁnd this elusive particle
failed, but in 1930 it was reported that the collision of α particles with light elements such
as lithium could create a radiation so penetrating that it was considered to be very high
energy gamma rays. However, no gamma rays of this energy had been known to exist.
Then in 1932 the French physicists Ir`ene Curie (Marie Curie’s daughter) and her husband
Fr´ed´eric Joliot published a paper, in which they showed that this radiation, when passed
through materials such as paraﬃn wax, which contained hydrogen, could eject protons of
very high speed.
Immediately after the publication of this paper, James Chadwick (1891–1974), one of
Rutherford’s assistants, published a paper entitled “Possible Existence of a Neutron,” in
which he proved that the experiment of Joliot and Curie could not involve gamma radiation,
but could best be explained by a neutral particle that was almost as heavy as the proton.
The word nucleon refers
to either a proton or a
neutron.
In the same year, Werner Heisenberg proposed that all nuclei are made up of protons and
neutrons, and that neutrons are not to be regarded as made up of an electron and a proton,
but rather as a “fundamental” particle just like a proton. The word nucleon now refers to
either a proton or a neutron.

Section 31.1
The Nucleon
459
It is common to designate a nucleus by placing the atomic number Z as a subscript
and the total number of nucleons (protons plus neutrons) as a superscript to the left of
the chemical symbol of that element. The total number of nucleons is denoted by A and
is usually called the atomic mass number, but a more appropriate name would be the
nucleon number.1
If N denotes the number of neutrons, then A = Z + N, and if X
represents the chemical symbol, then A
ZX is the nucleus of X atom with Z protons and
A −Z neutrons. Thus, 14
6 C is carbon with 8 neutrons, and 17
8 O is oxygen with 9 neutrons.

31.1.1
The Nuclear Force
The breakdown of a nucleus in terms of its constituents, proton and neutron, introduces a
dilemma: If the atomic nucleus consists of positive protons and neutral neutrons, why does
it not burst asunder due to the repulsive electrical forces? Are there stronger attractive
forces at work? The answer is “yes.” In fact, as early as 1921, Chadwick had shown that
Evidence for a very
short-ranged and very
strong nuclear force.
the angular distribution of the scattered protons in the collision of hydrogen atoms with
α particles indicated that forces other than electricity must be at work when α particles
interact with protons at very short distances. This short-ranged nuclear force operates
only when nuclear particles get extremely close to one another (so close that the separation
between them is of the order of a nuclear diameter); unlike the electric or gravitational
forces that operate at all separations. Another evidence for the short range of the nuclear
force is the very existence of molecules: if the nuclei of the atoms in a molecule felt the
strong attractive nuclear forces, they would collapse into a single nucleus, and the molecule
into a single atom.
The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding (or binding) the nucleons of a given
nucleus together, just as the gravitational force is responsible for binding satellites to the
Earth, moons to their planets, and planets to their stars (see Example 9.2.5); and just as
the electromagnetic force is responsible for binding the electrons (see Math Note E.21.1)
and the nucleus of an atom together. However, while in the case of electromagnetic force
the binding energy is of the order of a few eV (see Section 21.3 and Math Notes E.21.1 and
E.21.2), in the nuclear case the binding energy is typically millions of eV (a few MeV).
What do you know? 31.3. What would happen to the world if the strong nuclear
force were long-ranged?
The stability of a nucleus is determined by how tightly its nucleons are bound, i.e.,
by the binding energy each nucleon experiences. Because of the enormity of the (total)
binding energy, and because of the equivalence of mass and energy, the total binding energy
contributes to the mass of the nucleus. When we speak of the binding energy, we ignore the
Mass of nucleus in terms
of proton mass, neutron
mass, and binding

fact that it is negative. However, in calculating its contribution to the mass of the nucleus,
we must incorporate this negative sign. Let eb stand for the binding energy per nucleon of
a nucleus that has Z protons and N neutrons. Then the mass M of such a nucleus is given
by
M = Zmp + Nmn −(Z + N)mb
or
Mc2 = Zmpc2 + Nmnc2 −BE,
(31.1)
1The writing of the atomic number is really redundant once the chemical symbol is used.
However,
because it is hard to memorize the atomic number of all entries of the periodic table, it is helpful to have
it next to the chemical symbol.

between the actual mass of the nucleus and the number of nucleons times the uniﬁed atomic
mass unit. Example D.31.1 on page 64 of Appendix.pdf gives the formula that connects
∆to eb. For the majority of nuclei, ∆is a negative number: the smaller the mass excess,
the larger the binding energy, and the more stable the nucleus. Example D.31.2 on page
64 of Appendix.pdf calculates the mass excess for iron.
Iron, with a binding energy of 8.55 MeV per nucleon is one of the most stable nuclei.
Iron is one of the most
stable nuclei.
Much heavier and much lighter nuclei than iron have a value of eb smaller than 8.55 MeV;
therefore, they are less stable than iron. Figure 31.1 shows the plot of the binding energy
per nucleon as a function of the atomic mass number (the total number of nucleons in the
nucleus). It should be clear from the ﬁgure that the most stable nuclei have atomic mass
numbers approximately between 50 and 80.
31.2
Nuclear Reactions
The strong attractive nuclear force between the nucleons holds the nucleus of the atom
together. But for how long? Certain nuclei are stable, i.e., they remain unchanged forever.

ring as well.
Other nuclei tend to “transmute” over time entirely on their own. Certain other nuclei
can transmute once they are triggered by some external stimulus. In fact, one can provide
energy to any two nuclei and let them collide. The result of the collision could be other
nuclei plus other particles as well as some released energy which shows up as the kinetic
energy of the ﬁnal products. A typical nuclear reaction is
B + C →G + H + other particles + energy,
where B and C are the incoming nuclei and G and H the outgoing nuclei.
This looks
like a chemical reaction. However, there is a diﬀerence! In a chemical reaction involving
molecules, the atoms at the beginning are equal to the atoms at the end.
Box 31.2.1. In a nuclear reaction, the number of incoming nucleons is equal to the
number of outgoing nucleons.
Typically, one of the incoming nuclei is light: a neutron, a proton, or a helium nucleus.
For example,

The three most important types of nuclear reactions are radioactivity, ﬁssion, and fusion,
which we shall discuss in some detail.
31.2.1
Nuclear Radioactivity
R¨ontgen’s discovery of X-rays in 1895 created a great deal of excitement in the scientiﬁc
community. The historic photo of his wife’s hand showing the bones of her ﬁngers, including
the wedding ring (Figure 31.2), which appeared in R¨ontgen’s second article on X-rays,
opened the door to modern medicine (and Nobel Prize). No wonder many physicists sought
novel ways of producing these mysterious rays!
In 1896, Henri Becquerel (1852–1908), the French physicist, found a chemical compound—

potassium uranyl sulfate—that (he thought) spontaneously emitted X-rays without any
stimulus. However, the Polish-French physicist, Marie Curie, and her husband Pierre Curie
realized that Becquerel’s radiation was not X-ray, but a completely new physical process.
In search of the source of the radiation, she worked painstakingly to chemically isolate the
element mixed in minute amounts in uranium ores. She discovered radium.

462
Chapter 31
On the Experimental Front
Once radium was isolated, physicists could study the nature of its radiation. In 1899
Rutherford identiﬁed the α and the β components of the radiation, and a year later Bec-
querel and Villard established the existence of the third component, the γ rays. α rays
consist of two protons and two neutrons (the helium nucleus); β rays are beams of electrons
or positrons, the antiparticle of the electron; and γ rays are very energetic EM waves. These
rays are the by-products of any natural nuclear radioactivity. As discovered by Rutherford
in 1902, because they carry electric charge, the emission of α and β rays changes the atomic
number Z of the nucleus, and therefore, entails a transmutation of one element into
another. γ rays, on the other hand, do not change the identity of a nucleus; they are the
nuclear—and thus much more energetic—version of the atomic spectral lines (Section 21.3).
The chemical properties of an element, which determine the element itself, are speciﬁed
by the number of electrons—and, therefore, by the atomic number Z—of that element.
In fact, Z pins down the element itself: Z = 1 means hydrogen, Z = 2 means helium,
Z = 6 means carbon, etc. An element with its speciﬁc Z can have diﬀerent number N of
What is an isotope?
neutrons in its nucleus. For example, carbon’s nucleus is usually found to have 6 protons
and 6 neutrons. However, a small percentage of carbon comes with 7 or 8 neutrons in its
nucleus. Each variety of an element with a given number of neutrons in its nucleus is called
an isotope. Thus, the isotopes of an element all have the same Z but diﬀerent N.
BIOGRAPHY
Marie Sklodowska Curie (1867–1934) was a physicist and chemist of Polish upbringing and, subse-
quently, French citizenship.a She was a pioneer in the ﬁeld of radioactivity, the ﬁrst person honored
with two Nobel Prizes, and the ﬁrst female professor at the University of Paris. She was born in Warsaw
and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister Bronislawa to study in Paris,
where she obtained her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientiﬁc work. She founded the
Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband Pierre Curie was a Nobel co-laureate of hers, and
her daughter Ir`ene Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Fr´ed´eric Joliot-Curie also received Nobel prizes. Her
achievements include the creation of a theory of radioactivity (a term coined by her), techniques for
isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two new elements, polonium and radium. It was
also under her personal direction that the world’s ﬁrst studies were conducted into the treatment of
neoplasms (“cancers”), using radioactive isotopes. While an actively loyal French citizen, she never
lost her sense of Polish identity. She named the ﬁrst new chemical element that she discovered (1898)
“polonium” and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute (now the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute of
Oncology) in her home town Warsaw, headed by her physician-sister Bronislawa.

The radioactivity of an element depends on which isotope is involved.
We speak of
radioactive isotopes or radioisotopes of an element. For example, while 12
6 C is stable (i.e.,
Radioisotopes.
it is not radioactive), 14
6 C is a β emitter. Beta radiation is caused by the transformation of
one of the neutrons of the nucleus into a proton. For 14
6 C, one of the 8 neutrons becomes
a proton, turning carbon into a nitrogen. This nuclear reaction, or nuclear decay as it is
often called, is represented by
14
6 C →14
7 N + e−.
A nuclear decay can take place only within the context of relativity theory: the mass of the
decaying nucleus transforms partially into the kinetic energy of the end products.
Being a quantum interaction, nuclear decay can only be predicted with a probability.

decay.
The probabilistic character of a nuclear decay translates into half-life. This is the time in
which half of a radioactive sample decays. Starting with an initial number of nuclei N0,
after one half-life N0/2 nuclei remain, after two half-lives N0/4 survive, after three half-lives
N0/8 survive, etc. In general, if the half-life is denoted by thalf, then after a time t, the

(31.2)
Note that t need not be an integer multiple of thalf; it can be any (positive) number.
What do you know? 31.5. An isotope of Ni has a half life of 20 s. Starting with
1 kg of this isotope, how much of it is left after 40 s? After 1 minute? After 2 minutes?
Example D.31.3 on page 65 of Appendix.pdf shows that if we know the initial popu-
lation of a radioactive isotope and its half-life, we can predict the surviving population at
any later time. It also shows how crucial the magnitude of the half-life is in this survival.
For times long compared to the half-life, the surviving population becomes so small as to
be hard to measure.
Carbon Dating
The calculation of Example D.31.3 could be turned around for a much more useful appli-
cation: If we can measure the ratio N(t)/N0 of a radioactive substance now, and if we
know its half-life, then (31.2) will give us t, the time in the past when N(t) was equal to
N0. For this kind of dating to work, our radioisotope must have an appropriate half-life.
For instance, if we are trying to ﬁnd the age of a sample that is centuries old, 19
8 O with a
half-life of 27 seconds is utterly useless, because even after a few hours, the fraction becomes
immeasurably small.
Carbon 14, with a half-life of 5730 years, is most suitable for archaeological dating. This
isotope of carbon is produced in the upper atmosphere by the nuclear reactions triggered
by cosmic rays. The ratio of the abundance of 14
6 C to 12
6 C is about 1.3 × 10−12. The live
organisms, interacting with the atmosphere, inherit the same ratio of the two isotopes of
carbon in the carbon dioxide of their bodies. So, as long as the organism is alive this ratio
is retained. Once an organism dies, the ratio decreases due to the 14C decay. From the
14C/12C ratio of an archaeological sample one can determine the age of the ﬁnd.
What do you know? 31.6. The 14C/12C ratio of an archeological sample is 6.5 ×
10−13. How old is the sample?
Example 31.2.2. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found by a shepherd in 1947. Because of their
religious importance and the implications they might have on Christianity and Judaism, they were
kept out of reach of the scientists and archaeologists for almost half a century by a self-appointed
priesthood of less than a dozen scholars who claimed exclusive rights to the document. It was only
in 1991 that scroll fragments began surfacing in the antiquities market, and the content of these
Scrolls revealed.
A Roman historian had written (in AD 79) about a deeply religious tribe named Essenes, which
lived in the same area that the Scrolls were found. Although there were no women in the tribe,

there were suﬃcient number of recruits from outside to keep the tribe alive for many generations.
Living in caves, the Essenes wrote and collected hundreds of documents ranging from personal
matters such as divorce papers to the collective belief of the tribe.
In many of these Scrolls, there were mentions of a Messiah that shared an ancestry with King
David and was put to death. The oldest of these “Messianic” scrolls was almost 2250 years old,
indicating that it must have been written around 250 BC. Example D.31.4 on page 65 of

Age of Earth
All of the nuclear material (with the exception of hydrogen and helium) was made in the
interior of stars by nuclear reactions. These reactions produce not only stable nuclei, but
radioactive ones as well. When this nuclear soup condenses to form new stars and their
planets, the radioactive elements are carried along. If a radioactive element has a half-life

that is much shorter than the age of the planet, the element will disappear, and only the
stable by-product of its decay will remain.

These elements constitute some of the natural radioactivity around us. From the present

of the naturally radioactive nucleus (the parent nucleus) in a rock sample, it is possible to
estimate the age of the Earth, as Example D.31.5 on page 65 of Appendix.pdf shows.
Example D.31.5 gives the simplest method of applying nuclear radioactivity to the de-
termination of the age of Earth. In real situations, rocks don’t have only one daughter
nucleus, and not all of it may have been the result of the decay of the parent nucleus. Nev-
ertheless, alternate (and more complicated) procedures involving more than one daughter
nucleus have been devised to calculate the age of the Earth. All these procedures lead to
an Earth that is between 4 and 5 billion years old.
31.2.2
Nuclear Fission
The electrical neutrality of the neutron makes it a good candidate for probing the atomic
nucleus. Unfettered by the charges of the electrons surrounding the nucleus, neutrons move
straight to the nucleus where they can interact directly with their nuclear kindred. In one
such process a (very slow) neutron penetrates a heavy nucleus (the parent nucleus), makes
that nucleus unstable, causing it to split into two lighter nuclei (the daughter nuclei) plus
a few neutrons. This process is called a nuclear ﬁssion.
The parent nucleus is typically 235
92 U, and a typical ﬁssion looks like

where X and Y are any of the 90 or so possible daughter nuclei. If you add the mass of the
neutron to that of 235
92 U on the left you get something that is larger than the total mass of
the daughter nuclei plus the neutrons produced on the right. This mass defect becomes
the source2 of the kinetic energy of the ﬁssion products on the right via E = mc2. Since the
total number of protons and neutrons does not change in the reaction, the mass defect arises
because of the diﬀerence in the binding energies of the daughter nuclei and the uranium, as
Math Note E.31.1 on page 138 of Appendix.pdf shows rigorously.

2The general statement is that the initial energy must equal the ﬁnal energy. But since the neutron and
uranium are moving very slowly, their total energy is just the sum of their masses (times c2).

36 Kr + 3(neutrons).
Q: How much energy is released in this reaction?
A: The energy released is the energy equivalent of the mass defect. The mass defect is simply
the diﬀerence in the total binding energies of 141
56 Ba plus 92
36Kr and the binding energy of 235
92 U.
To ﬁnd this diﬀerence, we refer to Figure 31.1, and note that at the atomic mass number 141 the
binding energy per nucleon is about 8 MeV and at 92 it is about 8.3 MeV. For uranium-235 the
binding energy per nucleon is approximately 7.3. Therefore, the energy-equivalent of the mass
defect is
141 × 8 + 92 × 8.3 −235 × 7.3 = 176.1 MeV.
This is over a hundred million times larger than the energy released in the chemical reaction of a
typical combustible molecule!

of the energy released. These neutrons can ﬁssion 3 new uranium nuclei causing the release
of 9 neutron, which in turn can ﬁssion 9 uranium nuclei releasing 27 neutrons, etc. If not
controlled, this chain reaction could spread very quickly, releasing a tremendous amount
of energy in a very short time. Such an uninhibited chain reaction is a nuclear bomb. On
the other hand, if the release of energy is controlled, it is possible to turn it into other forms
of energy such as electricity, as is done in a nuclear power plant.
Food for Thought
FFT 31.2.4. The investigation of nuclear ﬁssion, like all other scientiﬁc investigations, was
spurred by the natural curiosity of a few physicists, who were trying to understand the newly
discovered nucleons and how they made up the nucleus of an atom.
The precursor of ﬁssion
was artiﬁcial radioactivity discovered by Ir`ene Curie and Fr´ed´eric Joliot, who bombarded certain
light nuclei with α particles and noted that many of the by-products of nuclear radioactivity were
produced even after the α particle source was removed.
The new world of the nucleus attracted the attention of many young physicists around the
globe. Many puzzling questions in this new world demanded an answer, and the curiosity of these
physicists became the playing ground of the questions. It was this curiosity that prompted Enrico
Fermi (1901–1954) to redo Curie-Joliot experiments using uranium instead of the light elements
and neutron instead of α particles. The plan of his group in Italy was to make artiﬁcial elements
heavier than uranium.
In 1938 Otto Hahn (1879–1968), a German chemist, and Fritz Strassmann (1902–1980), a
German physicist, showed that one of the elements that Fermi thought was transuranium, was
actually an isotope of barium (Z = 56). Then Lise Meitner (1878–1968), another German physicist,
and her nephew Otto Frisch, proposed the theory that the neutron caused the uranium to split
into two lighter elements releasing a gigantic amount of energy in the process, and they named this
reaction ﬁssion.
It was an unfortunate twist of history that this source of enormous power caught the attention
of politicians and military men at a time when a global war was looming. Two weeks after the
outbreak of World War II in 1939, some British government oﬃcials, threatened by Adolf Hitler’s
speeches, in which he warned of some “secret weapons,”3 asked some British scientists to look into
the possibility of using nuclear energy in the production of weapons. This possibility seemed so

bomb seriously enough to set up the Manhattan Project. Subsequently, the British terminated their

the feasibility of a nuclear chain reaction, the ﬁrst step towards the construction of a nuclear bomb
or a nuclear power plant. This group succeeded in achieving the ﬁrst controlled chain reaction on
December 2, 1942.
This turn of events has been used by some sociopolitical zealots to spearhead such a public
hysteria that any mention of the word “nuclear” is equated with destruction. For example, the
procedure of obtaining three-dimensional images of human tissues in medicine, which has saved
thousands of lives, uses “nuclear” magnetic resonance (NMR). However, the word “nuclear” had
to be removed from the procedure to ease public concern, and it was renamed magnetic resonance
imaging or MRI.
The nuclear bomb did not aﬀect just nuclear physics; the very science of physics has been under
attack by many social critics of science. But is it really fair—not only to physics and physicists, but
to the entire humanity—to blame nuclear power for what the political and military establishments
have used it for? If so, then we have to blame another tremendous source of power unleashed
many many years ago. This source has also had a double role for mankind: it has been used as a
source of energy and warmth, and as a source of destruction in wars and acts of vengeance. It is
the source that has provided light at night, digestible food, and heating for cold winter days. It
has also destroyed armies of men, houses, villages, and cities for centuries. This powerful source of
destruction and construction was discovered over 500,000 years ago. It is called ﬁre!

Nuclear Fusion
The peak of stability in Figure 31.1 occurs at the atomic mass numbers between 50 and 80.
The nuclei on the far right and the far left of this region are less stable. The lower stability
of heavy nuclei was the raison d’ˆetre for ﬁssion. The lower stability of light nuclei also has
an important consequence. If two light nuclei could fuse together to form a nucleus closer
to the stability region, then the sum of the original masses will be more than the sum of
the ﬁnal masses due to the higher (negative) ﬁnal binding energies. This missing mass can
turn into the (enormous) kinetic energy of the by-products of the nuclear fusion reaction.
What do you know? 31.8. What would happen if the plot in Figure 31.1 were a ﬂat

An example of nuclear fusion is the proton-proton cycle whereby hydrogen nuclei

(protons) fuse to form helium nuclei. This takes place in three steps in the interior of stars
where the temperature is 15–20 million ◦K. In the ﬁrst step, a deuteron—heavy hydrogen
nucleus—is formed:
p + p →2
1D + e+ + ν,
where e+ stands for positron, the antiparticle of the electron, and ν stands for neutrino, of
both of which we shall say more later. In the second step, a proton fuses with a deuteron
to form an isotope of helium, releasing energy in the form of gamma ray:
p +2
1 D →3
2He + γ.
There are actually two possibilities for the third (and ﬁnal) step of the cycle. 3
2He can fuse
with a proton:
p +3
2 He →4
2He + e+ + ν,
or two 3
2He nuclei can fuse:
3
2He +3
2 He →4
2He + p + p.
Example 31.2.5. Let us calculate the energy released in the proton-proton cycle. The net eﬀect
of the ﬁrst possibility is the fusion of four protons into 4
2He and the release of two positrons, two
neutrinos, and a massless gamma particle5 (see Example D.31.6 on page 66 of Appendix.pdf
5Gamma particles are very energetic photons; and photons, as discussed in Section 28.3.2, are massless.

for a “proof” of this and the result of the second possible reaction). Thus, neglecting the neutrino
masses,6 the mass defect is 4mp −mHe −2me. In atomic mass units, this gives
4 × 1.0072764 −4.002602 −2 × 0.0005486 = 0.0254 u,
which is equivalent to 23.7 MeV.
The second possibility involves two 3
2He nuclei. Thus, we have to multiply both sides of the
ﬁrst two steps by 2. The net eﬀect of the ﬁrst two steps would then be six protons fusing to give
two 3
2He nuclei, two positrons, two neutrinos, and two gamma particles. Then in the last step
the two 3
2He nuclei combine to give one 4
2He and two protons. The overall net reaction is thus
fusing four protons to give one 4
2He, two positrons, two neutrinos, and two gamma particles. The
diﬀerence between this and the ﬁrst possibility is the production of one extra γ, which carries no
mass. Therefore, the mass defect is the same as before.

The fusion of light nuclei requires bringing them close enough for the attractive nuclear
forces to take over. For this to happen, the light nuclei should have at least as much kinetic
energy as the electric repulsive potential energy between them. For example, each proton
of the ﬁrst step of the proton-proton cycle should have at least 5 keV of kinetic energy7 to
overcome the repulsive potential energy of the two protons. This may seem a very small

number, but when translated into the temperature (as discussed in Section 17.1 and Box
17.2.5) required for a thermonuclear fusion reaction, it becomes tens of millions of
degrees Kelvin, as the following example shows.
Example 31.2.6. Estimate the temperature of a hydrogen gas that can undergo fusion by
assuming that the average KE of the hydrogen atoms is 5 keV. Equation (17.1) gives the average
KE, ⟨KE⟩, as 3
2kBT where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature in Kelvin. The
average KE is 5 keV or 5000 eV or 8 × 10−16 J. So, from ⟨KE⟩= 3
2kBT, we get
8 × 10−16 = 3
2 × (1.38 × 10−23)T
or
T =
8 × 10−16
2.07 × 10−23 = 3.86 × 107 ◦K,
or about 39 million degrees. However, because of the probabilistic nature of the relation between
temperature and KE, even at temperatures of 15–20 million degrees, there are suﬃcient number of
“fast” protons for fusion to take place.

Food for Thought
FFT 31.2.7. March 23, 1989 is a particularly signiﬁcant day in the modern history of science. On
that day, two electrochemists, Stanley Pons from the University of Utah, and Martin Fleischmann
from Southampton University, reported a major breakthrough in nuclear fusion research. There
were a few indicators that pointed to suspicion about this report. (See [Hui 92] for details.)
• All genuine major breakthroughs in science have been reported through professional journals,
whose editors and referees put the submitted articles under severe scrutiny. The prestige of
such a professional journal rests on the quality and the reputation of its editors and referees.
The discovery of Pons and Fleischmann was announced in a news conference intended for
commercial networks! All the experts in the ﬁeld of fusion learned about this “cold fusion”
on the radio, or television or in the commercial newspapers and magazines.
• The process of fusion, as noted above, takes place only under extremely high temperatures
and pressures such as those inside stars. Pons and Fleischmann claimed that their “fusion”
took place at room temperature.
6Neutrinos were believed to be massless until the so-called “neutrino oscillations” were discovered, giving
a very small mass to these particles.
7So, strictly speaking, we should add this to the mass energy of the two protons when we calculate the
mass defect. But these are so small compared to the proton mass, or even the electron mass, that we can
neglect them.

468
Chapter 31
On the Experimental Front
• Although fusion requires extreme temperature and pressure, it does not mean that terres-
trial fusion has not taken place. In fact, many laboratories in the US, Japan, Russia, and
Western Europe had been (and still are) working on the same problem for decades. How-
ever, in all conventional cases, the process takes place for a fraction of a second, and requires
huge equipments and millions of dollars. Pons and Fleischmann claimed that their “fusion”
required table-top chemistry equipment much like those used in high school laboratories.
• As our discussion has shown, the fusion processes are accompanied by the production of
lethal levels of radioactive material [such as the (positive) beta particles and the highly
lethal gamma rays in the proton-proton cycle discussed before]. The healthy presence of
Pons and Fleischmann in the news conference was proof for the absence of such processes.
• Both Pons and Fleischmann were electrochemists and all their publications prior to their
March 23 announcement were in that ﬁeld. Fusion requires expertise in the ﬁeld of nuclear
physics or nuclear chemistry, of which neither knew enough to warrant this potentially Nobel-
Prize caliber discovery.
• Finally, unlike all scientiﬁc discoveries, the announcement came after a long nervous period
of secrecy. Many experts, upon hearing about the discovery in the news media, contacted
their colleagues in the physics department at the University of Utah to learn more about
the Pons-Fleischmann experiment. To their surprise, they all realized that no one in that
department knew of the experiment! A legitimate discoverer involves his/her professional
colleagues and coworkers in the discovery. And this is driven not only by the involuntary
desire to share the excitement with all people nearby, but also by a need to check the accuracy
of the process and the result of discovery.
In the nearly two decades since its announcement, cold fusion has been tried over and over
again by many physicists and chemists around the world with no single legitimate success.
The enormous energy released in the nuclear fusion (as illustrated in Example 31.2.5)
has prompted many physicists and engineers to look into the possibility of commercial
production of fusion energy, and there are many facilities around the world devoted to this
challenge. The plan is to use deuterium (heavy hydrogen found abundantly in ocean water)
Plasma conﬁnement.
as a fusion fuel. There are many practical obstacles to this plan, not the least of which is
plasma conﬁnement.8 This refers to conﬁning the deuterons at high enough temperature
for a long enough time so that the fusion (and the release of energy) can be sustained.
Despite great progress in the “fusion industry,” no commercial production of fusion energy
has yet been possible.
31.3
The Emergence of Particle Physics
The experiments of Rutherford and his colleagues in 1911–1913 opened the gates to heaven
... literally. These experiments, and especially the ingenious techniques invented as a result
of them, eventually led the physicists to a scientiﬁc solution to no less an enigma than
the creation of the universe itself. The steps that led to that solution were taken quite
haphazardly and independently. The connection between the subnuclear phenomena and
cosmology came much later.
31.3.1
Neutrino
Of the three radioactive rays, beta rays turned out to be the most interesting. It can be
easily explained as the decay of a neutron into a proton and an electron; and for a long
time people thought that only these three particles were involved. Thus, when a carbon-
14 decays, one of the eight neutrons turns into a proton, resulting in a nitrogen nucleus
8Because of the extremely high temperature, the heavy hydrogen atom is separated into a positive
deuteron and a negative electron; the resulting “soup” is a plasma—a collection of positive and negative
charges.

with seven protons and seven neutrons, plus an electron which ﬂies oﬀwith great speed.
However, the experimental analysis of the energy of the electron revealed that it did not
have a unique value. Why should the value of the electron energy be unique?
For the sake of simplicity, concentrate on the decay of a single neutron:
n →p+ + e−.
Look at this process in the neutron’s reference frame (RF), where n is necessarily stationary.
Since the momentum of n is zero, the proton and electron must have equal and opposite
momenta. The equality of momenta and the conservation of energy determines the energy
of the electron uniquely as shown in Math Note E.31.2 on page 138 of Appendix.pdf .
This value happens to be 1.289 MeV. If instead of a neutron, a nucleus β-decays, the ﬂying
electron will still have a single energy value, albeit one diﬀerent from 1.289 MeV.
What do you know? 31.9. Why can a stationary neutron decay into a proton and
other things, but a stationary proton cannot decay into a neutron and other things?
Observations, however, indicated that the electron energy in the β decay is not unique.
And this created a turmoil in the physics community. Some suggested that energy was not
conserved in nuclear reactions. Others took a less dramatic approach and suggested that
diﬀerent nuclei of the same sample decay diﬀerently. The correct explanation came from
Wolfgang Pauli, who suggested that the end product of a neutron β decay is not just an
electron and a proton, but also a third—extremely elusive—particle, which was later called
neutrino (little neutron) by Fermi. Neutrino carries some of the available energy in a β
decay, leaving the remaining energy to be shared by the electron and the proton; and the
available energy can be divided among the three particles in anyway possible, as long as the
momenta of the proton, the electron, and the neutrino add up to the initial momentum of
the neutron, and their energies to the initial energy of the neutron.
31.3.2
Muons and Pions
In the ﬁrst 35 years after the discovery of the ﬁrst elementary particle (the electron), the
number of what seemed to be “fundamental” particles was a mere ﬁve: electron, photon,
proton, neutron, and neutrino.9 In the second 35 years a deluge of fundamental particles
caught the physicists oﬀguard, and brought about such a state of confusion that only very
radical ideas could resolve it.
Food for Thought
FFT 31.3.1. The introduction of the elusive neutrino in the explanation of the β decay brings
out a very sensitive issue concerning the validity of scientiﬁc claims. The elusion of neutrino, a
psychoanalyst may argue, allows the introduction of other elusive phenomena. If physics is allowed
to cope with a particle that cannot be detected, then psychoanalysis should be allowed to introduce
the undetectable and nonmaterial id, ego, and superego. And if neutrino can explain the variation
in the energy of the electrons in β decay, why can id, ego, and superego not explain the disorders
in personality? There are two major diﬀerences between a neutrino and an id (or ego or superego).
First, although neutrino was not physically detected, physicists could measure many of its
material properties. They could determine that neutrino was either massless or had a very small
mass; that it had an intrinsic spin (see Section 23.3) equal to that of the electron (and proton and
neutron); that in every β decay one could assign unambiguously a momentum and energy to it
9A particle was also discovered in 1932, which was identical to an electron except for its positive electric
charge. This particle was later identiﬁed as positron, the antiparticle of the electron. We are not counting
the positron as an independent particle.

consistent with the energy and momentum conservation. No such determination has been made
for id. In fact, no one (including the psychoanalyst) knows what id is. Is it a “subatomic particle”
of psychoanalysis? Is it an “atom” of psychoanalysis? A collection of such “atoms?” Is id a wave?
If so, what is its frequency? Its amplitude? Its wavelength? The fact is that the building blocks of
psychoanalysis are as much void of any physical properties as phantoms and spirits.
Second, as elusive as neutrinos were at the beginning, they came eventually under control.
About four decades after they were “hypothesized,” real neutrino beams were produced and scat-
tered oﬀelectrons, as real as billiard balls scattering oﬀeach other! The reality of neutrinos was
ﬁnally established. Almost a hundred years have passed since Freud introduced the id-ego-superego
trinity, and still there is not even a smidgen of evidence for their physical reality. The elusive id is
still as elusive as a phantom!
The sixth “fundamental” particle was predicted by the Japanese physicist Hideki Yukawa
Yukawa predicts the
existence of the meson.
(1907–1981) in 1935. Following up on a suggestion by Werner Heisenberg concerning the
quantization of the strong nuclear force, Yukawa argued that just as the electromagnetic
ﬁeld has a particle (the photon), the “nuclear ﬁeld” must also have a particle, called the
meson. However, photon, moving at the ultimate speed, can carry the electromagnetic
force to large distances. That is why the electromagnetic force is long-ranged. Since nuclear
forces are short-ranged, the meson must be massive.10 Knowing the range of the nuclear
forces (essentially the size of a nucleus), Yukawa could predict the mass of the meson to lie
between the mass of an electron and that of a proton.
Two years after Yukawa’s prediction of the meson, several teams of physicists reported
the discovery in cosmic rays of a new particle with a mass between the electronic and
protonic masses.
At ﬁrst, everyone thought that this was the Yukawa particle.
But a
number of experimental and theoretical analyses proved otherwise. If this newly discovered
particle was the Yukawa meson, then—being the “carrier” of the strong nuclear force—it
had to interact strongly with (the nucleus of) matter. That wasn’t the case! Furthermore,
theoretical calculations concluded a very short half-life for the Yukawa meson. The new
particle was over a hundred times longer-living! By 1947 it was becoming evident that
the particle found by the cosmic ray experimenters was not the Yukawa particle, but a
“daughter” of its decay. Thus, the seventh particle was discovered before the predicted
sixth! This cosmic-ray particle was called the µ-meson at that time, but the name was
later changed to muon.
Muons came in two varieties, positive and negative, and each had a half life of about
a microsecond, in which time it decayed into an electron plus at least two other particles.
How did physicists know that the electron was accompanied by at least two other particles?
Our discussion of the beta decay in Section 31.3.1 implies that if a particle decays into only
two lighter particles, the end products have well-deﬁned energies. Lack of a well-deﬁned
energy for the electrons implied the existence of neutrinos. In a muon decay precisely the
same phenomenon occurs: the electrons do not have a well-deﬁned energy, indicating that
at least three particles are produced in a muon decay. The elusive nature of the other
particles hinted at the production of two neutrinos beside the electron.
What of the Yukawa meson? Just as the muon was being proposed as the daughter
of the decay of the Yukawa particle, several groups of experimenters discovered a particle
Pions are discovered.
that interacted strongly with matter as expected of the Yukawa meson. The pi-meson (as
this particle was called at the beginning) came in three kinds: negative (discovered ﬁrst),
positive, and neutral. Now we call these particles pions.
Cosmic rays seemed to be the ultimate source of new particles, and novel techniques
of detection11 paved the way for discovering and identifying many exotic particles. In the

same year that the pion was discovered, two British physicists found evidence for a neutral
particle, whose mass lay between a pion mass and a proton mass. This particle came to
be known as K-meson or kaon. And by 1953, in which an international conference of
Kaons and hyperons are
discovered.
cosmic-ray physicists took place, several other particles were identiﬁed which had masses
larger than the nucleon. These massive particles were collectively called the hyperons.
31.3.3
Cyclotron and the Particle Explosion
Cosmic rays provided the physicists with a noticeable collection of new particles on which to
ponder. But the elementary particle physics would not have been born were it not for
the invention of the particle accelerators. Accelerators brought the study of the newly

discovered particles from mountaintops to laboratories, where they could be produced in
high quantities under controlled environments.
The idea of using electromagnetic ﬁelds to accelerate charged particles to high energies
goes back to the heydays of nuclear physics. In 1932 John Cockroft and Ernest Walton,
in their attempt at bombarding the lithium nucleus, built the ﬁrst linear accelerator to
speed up protons to several hundred keV. The grandchild of Cockroft-Walton accelerator
is the one at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), which is two miles long and can
accelerate particles to several giga electron volts (GeV)!
The higher the energy desired of a charged particle, the greater the length of the linear
accelerator. This puts some restrictions on the facility, not the least of which is its mere
linear size. Could we somehow “bend” the linear tube to reduce its eﬀective size? Could
we build a circular accelerator?
When an electrically charged particle enters a magnetic ﬁeld, it bends and moves on a
circular path, whose plane is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld and whose
radius is proportional to the momentum of the particle.12 Furthermore, the period of the
revolution of the particle on the circle is independent of the size of the circle. Because the
force induced by the magnetic ﬁeld is always perpendicular to the motion of the particle,
the magnetic force cannot accelerate a charged particle. To accelerate particles, we need an
electric ﬁeld.
What do you know? 31.10. Why can we not use just a magnetic ﬁeld to accelerate
particles?
Ernest Lawrence, an American physicist, came up with the idea of periodically accel-
erating the particles with an electric ﬁeld while sending them through a magnetic ﬁeld to
“circulate.” Figure 31.3 shows two semicircles called the “dees,” placed between the two
poles of a magnet (not shown) so that a magnetic ﬁeld is established in the dees perpen-
dicular to the plane of the paper. The dees are separated by a gap, in which an alternating
electric ﬁeld can accelerate charged particles. If the period of oscillation of the electric ﬁeld
is equal to the (constant) period of the circulation of the particle in the dees, the ﬁeld will
always accelerate the particle in the gap. The device is called a cyclotron.
Place a positive particle near the center of the cyclotron when the electric ﬁeld points
to the left. The electric ﬁeld will accelerate the particle in the gap and sends it into the left
dee with a small velocity. As the particle enters the magnetic ﬁeld of the dee, it circulates
and comes out of the left dee (with the same speed as it went in). The electric ﬁeld, whose
frequency is chosen so that now it points to the right, will accelerate the particle further
and sends it into the right dee. Having a slightly larger speed, the particle moves on a
slightly larger circle, but—because the period of revolution does not depend on the size of
the circle—the time spent in the right dee is the same as that spent in the left dee. So when
12This property is used to determine the momentum of a particle in a cloud chamber.

the particle comes out of the right dee, the electric ﬁeld has changed direction again and
can accelerate the particle further. This process can spiral the particle to very high speeds.
The ﬁrst cyclotron, built in 1931 by Lawrence’s student M. Stanley Livingston, had
a diameter of 2.5 inches and accelerated protons to 80 keV. It was soon followed by a 9-
inch cyclotron capable of accelerating protons to one MeV (106 eV). By 1945, the largest
cyclotron (built also by Lawrence’s group) had a diameter of 184 inches and was capable
of achieving energies up to 190 MeV. Because of such high energies, relativity played an
important role in the design of the new generation of particle accelerators, including the
184-inch cyclotron. Theory of relativity predicts that the period of revolution of a particle
in a magnetic ﬁeld is not constant. One way to incorporate this relativistic eﬀect was to
synchronize the frequency of the electric ﬁeld with the speed of the particle entering the gap.
Cyclotron evolves into
synchrotron.
Another, more cost eﬀective way, was to synchronize both the electric and the magnetic
ﬁelds of the cyclotron. Such a machine is called synchrotron.
Synchrotrons mushroomed in the 1950s and 60s all over the world, especially in the US.
The high energies achieved in a controlled environment paved the way for unraveling some
of the most protected secrets of the universe. Through a merger of experiments, theories,
and mathematics, a very successful model of fundamental particles emerged by the end of
1970s. To understand this model, we have to move on to the theoretical front.

31.1.
A neutral atom is said to be ionized when one of its electrons is pushed out of the
atom. If one (negative) electron leaves the neutral atom, the atom ends up with a single
positive charge. It is singly ionized. When two or more electrons are pushed out, the atom
is doubly or multiply ionized. When you cannot see any doubly ionized hydrogen, it must
mean that neutral hydrogen has no “second” electron to give out. It consists of one positive
proton and one negative electron.

Neither ﬁssion nor fusion would take place, because there would be no diﬀerence
between binding energy per nucleons. All nuclei would be equally stable, and there would
be no preference to form new nuclei.
31.9.
Neutron is more massive than proton. The extra mass can turn into very light
particles and the kinetic energy associated with their motion. Although a stationary proton
by itself cannot produce a neutron, if it is bombarded with something like an electron, a
neutron can be produced.
31.10. When a force such as the magnetic force is perpendicular to the direction of motion
of a particle, it does no work on that particle (see Box 8.1.1 and Figure 8.1). If work is
zero, the change in the KE is also zero by Equation (8.1), and if the KE does not change,
speed will not change.

Chapter32
On the Theoretical Front
With the discovery of the quantum theory (describing the very small) and the special theory
of relativity (describing the very fast), it was natural to seek a theory that described very fast
subatomic particles. Such a theory had to combine STR and the quantum theory, resulting
in an equation that would replace the Schr¨odinger equation. Early attempts yielded results,
which, although deemed accurate later on, were considered nonsensical at the time. For
example, one formulation appeared to yield negative probability.1
The negative sign of
the probability can be traced to Equation (28.7), which contains the square of the energy,
making it possible for the energy to be negative (keeping its square positive). This negative
energy led to what was interpreted as negative probability.
32.1
Mathematical Prediction of Antimatter
To circumvent the problem of negative probability, Paul Dirac (1902–1984) invented an

equation in 1928, now bearing his name.
Most great theoretical discoveries in physics
are based on some simple principle. Maxwell’s equations were based on the conservation
of the electric charge; the special theory of relativity was based on the constancy of the
speed of light with respect to all observers; the general theory of relativity was based on the
equivalence principle; and the Schr¨odinger equation was based on the fact that electrons are
waves. In the case of the Dirac equation, the principle was invariance under the Lorentz
transformations. What came out of this basic principle—after some elegant mathematical
manipulation—was truly revolutionary. Dirac proved that if STR is to hold and negative
probability is to be absent, then the Ψ function of the Schr¨odinger equation cannot be just
a single function, but a collection of four functions. Two of these were associated to the
motion of the electron. Why two? It turned out that the Dirac equation included the spin
of the electron automatically.2 Thus, the mysterious “spin” was explained by a relativistic
quantum theory.
What about the other two components?
Employing some mathematical techniques,
which the quantum theory itself helped develop, it was shown that the other two components
described a particle with positive electric charge. It was therefore natural to ascribe them
to the proton. However, soon (using the same mathematical techniques) it was discovered
that the mass of the assigned particle must be identical to the mass of the electron. Proton
with a mass almost 2000 times the electron mass could not be the right candidate. And
1The negative sign was later attributed to the electric charge rather than probability, rendering the
formulation plausible.

2 particle such as an electron is described by two components.

when Carl Anderson discovered a positively charged particle having the mass of the electron
in 1932, it was not hard to associate it with the Dirac equation.
BIOGRAPHY
Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac (1902–1984) was born in Bristol, England, of a Swiss, French-speaking
father and an English mother. Dirac went to Merchant Venturer’s School, the public school where his
father taught French, and while there displayed great mathematical abilities. After graduating from
Bristol University at the age of 19, and not being able to ﬁnd a job as an electrical engineer, he ended
up at Cambridge as a research student in 1923. His appointment as university lecturer came in 1929. He
assumed the Lucasian professorship following Joseph Larmor in 1932 and retired from it in 1969. Two
years later he accepted a position at Florida State University where he lived out his remaining years. In
response to a question posed to him in Moscow in 1955 about his philosophy of physics, Dirac wrote on
the blackboard “Physical Laws should have mathematical beauty.” This writing is still preserved today.
This positive electron, or positron, as it has come to be called, has some interesting

properties. For instance, Dirac theory predicts that, by merely putting an electron and a
positron next to each other, it is possible for them to completely annihilate one another into
pure (electromagnetic) energy! This can happen only because the two particles have exactly
the same mass. Because of this process of annihilation, positron has also been designated
as the antimatter of the electron.
Food for Thought
FFT 32.1.1. The theoretical progress that led to the discovery of antimatter was not motivated
by any practical necessity. It was not even motivated by the “need” of the physics community, as
the realm of “fast subatomic particles” was yet to be born. What drove Dirac and other theoretical
physicists was what has driven the scientiﬁc progress since the dawn of man: curiosity.
Special theory of relativity (STR) was born in 1905, and as soon as it was born it bedazzled
everybody by its simplicity, beauty, and power. Quantum theory was born in 1925/26, and im-
mediately it was recognized as one of the most comprehensive theories ever. Dirac was familiar
with both theories. In fact, he contributed substantially to the quantum theory by introducing a
method of combining the Heisenberg’s matrix mechanics and Schr¨odinger’s wave mechanics. And
because STR had shown itself as a more complete theory than Newtonian mechanics, a relativistic
description of the subatomic world seemed to be the correct course of action. As a matter of fact,
Practical application:
the last thing on a great
physicist’s mind!
Schr¨odinger himself started with a formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics, and only after
he failed, he resorted to “quantize” the Newtonian mechanics.
Dirac’s attempt at inventing a relativistic quantum mechanics was not unique, although the
outcome of his attempt was. Scientists in general, and physicists in particular, have a childlike
curiosity. Just as a child likes to play with letter cubes to make words, physicists like to “play”
with theories to make new ones. And just as a child is oblivious to the “practical application” or the
potential “utility” of her game, so are the theoretical physicists who work on the most fundamental
riddles of our universe.
“The profound study of
nature is the most
fruitful source of
mathematical
discoveries.”
Joseph Fourier
And the successful work on the most fundamental riddles often accompanies surprises; delightful
surprises. Dirac’s work not only clariﬁed the mysterious property called “spin” and predicted the
existence of antimatter, but also created a new branch of elegant mathematics called spin geometry,
aﬃrming the prophesy of the great mathematician of the nineteenth century, Joseph Fourier, who
said: “The profound study of nature is the most fruitful source of mathematical discoveries.”
The history of physics and mathematics is full of examples of great discoveries made as a
result of “the profound study of nature.”
Newton’s discovery of the laws of motion, universal
gravitation, and the development of calculus and diﬀerential equation, Maxwell’s prediction of the
electromagnetic waves, Einstein’s discovery of the theory of relativity, and Dirac’s prediction of
antimatter and the creation of spin geometry are but a few instances of the fruits of curiosity.
Right after the identiﬁcation of the positron as the antiparticle of the electron, physicists

started hunting for other antiparticles. Proton, being the second particle discovered,3 was
the natural target. With the development of synchrotrons (see the end of Chapter 31),
physicists sought a machine that could produce an antiproton. The plan was to accelerate
a proton to a suﬃciently high energy that upon its impact with a stationary proton, the
relativistic conversion of the energy of the impinging proton could result in an antiproton.
Simple relativistic calculation, reproduced in Math Note E.32.1 on page 139 of Ap-
pendix.pdf , revealed that the machine had to accelerate protons to about 6 billion eV. Such
a machine, called the Bevatron4 was developed at the University of California at Berkley,
and put in operation in 1955. In the same year, the antiproton was discovered.
Anti-proton is discovered
in 1955.
It is now known that every elementary particle in existence has an antiparticle with
identical mass. Any property of the particle that has an opposite is shared by the antiparticle
with the opposite sign. The only property of a particle familiar to the reader and having an
opposite is the electric charge. Proton has a positive charge, antiproton negative; electron
has a negative charge, positron positive. There are, however, other “charges,” of which we
shall say more as we learn more about other particles. Furthermore,
Box 32.1.2. Any process (such as decays) involving particles and antiparticles has an
identical partner in which all particles are turned into antiparticles and vice versa.
For example, if neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino, then an
antineutron decays into an antiproton, a positron, and a neutrino.
What do you know? 32.1. A charged particle clearly cannot be its own antiparticle.
Could neutron be its own antiparticle?
32.2
Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
At about the same time that Dirac was occupied with the relativistic quantum mechanics,
other physicists were taking up another fundamental problem: EM waves are made up of
photons, as Einstein demonstrated in 1905; they are also described by Maxwell’s equations.
So how do you get photons out of these equations? How do you quantize the EM ﬁeld?
How do you quantize Maxwell’s equations? Pursuit of questions like these created one of the
most successful mathematical theories of all time, quantum electrodynamics (or QED,
for short). This was also the ﬁrst quantum ﬁeld theory and the ﬁrst gauge theory, of
which we shall say more later.
Quantum electrodynamics studies the interaction of electromagnetic ﬁeld with electri-
cally charged elementary particles. The only elementary particles, with which we are fa-
miliar at this point are electrons and positrons. Protons and other seemingly “elementary”
particles are—as we shall see in the sequel—in reality composite.
How do electrons and positrons (and other truly elementary particles that we shall
encounter later) interact electromagnetically? The old idea of action-at-a-distance, whereby
one particle inﬂuences the other instantaneously, violates causality and relativity. The more
realistic idea, that the ﬁeld of one charge at the location of the other charge inﬂuences
the latter locally, while correct, treats the electromagnetic ﬁeld classically. The complete
Electromagnetic force is
a result of the exchange
of photons.
3Photon was “discovered” before proton, but photon is massless, and as we shall see later, it has no
antiparticle (or, equivalently, it is its own antiparticle).
4A billion eV was called a BeV at the time of the operation of the Bevatron. However, to avoid the
confusing use of “billion” for a million million (1012) in Britain, and for a thousand million (109) in the
US, the international community of physicists later decided to use “giga” to mean 109, and GeV to mean
109 eV.

and correct description quantizes the electromagnetic ﬁeld, identiﬁes Einstein’s photon as
the quantum of the EM ﬁeld, and treats the electromagnetic interaction among charged
elementary particles as the exchange of photons. According to this picture, the reason
that an electron feels the electromagnetic force of another electron is that the two send
photons to each other. So everything, including the force, becomes a (quantized) particle.
But something is missing from this picture that is related to the quintessential dichotomy
of the quantum theory: particles are waves are particles! The ﬁeld-photon duality meets
this dichotomy criterion: After all, it is the oscillation of the EM ﬁeld that creates EM
waves, which in turn consist of photons. What about the electrons and positrons (and
other elementary particles)? Shouldn’t they also have a dual nature? Shouldn’t electrons
and positrons be ﬁelds as well?
Box 32.2.1. Quantum electrodynamics and other quantized ﬁeld theories assume that
all elementary particles and all fundamental interactions (forces) are represented by
ﬁelds, whose quanta are the particles they represent. Matter particles exert forces on
one another through the exchange of force particles.
According to this picture, electrons and positrons are quanta of a ﬁeld that obeys the
Dirac equation, just as photons are quanta of the electromagnetic ﬁeld obeying Maxwell’s
equations. In the jargon of theoretical physics, quantization of Maxwell’s equations yields
photons and quantization of the Dirac equation yields electrons and positrons. We shall use
Box 32.2.1 to study some of the processes involving electrons, positrons, and photons. At
the heart of this study is the Feynman diagrams, which are pictorial representations of
a highly mathematical procedure for calculating the quantitative aspects of the processes.
Because of their intuitive appeal, we shall consider these diagrams in some detail.
BIOGRAPHY
Richard Feynman (1918–1988) was born into a Jewish emigrant family from Russia and Poland. His
father, Melville, was a business man whose real interest was in science, but he never had the opportunity
to make a career out of it. Melville wanted his ﬁrst child to be a son and he also wanted him to become
a scientist. Richard was Melville’s ﬁrst son, and it was clear what lay ahead for him. Feynman really
enjoyed mathematics competitions and was a real star in his school. Upon graduation from high school,
he applied to several universities, but was rejected by most; partly because of his poor grades in literature
and art, but mostly because he was a Jew. Nevertheless, he was accepted by the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, which he attended in 1935. Feynman was very much at ease with physics, taking graduate
courses as a sophomore, and reading the new subject of quantum theory on his own. Upon graduation
in 1939, he went to Princeton University and worked under the supervision of John Wheeler. It was
during this time that he invented a new, more intuitive, formulation of the quantum theory. He later
used this formulation to quantize the electromagnetic ﬁeld leading to the development of quantum
electrodynamics. As a by-product, Feynman invented the intuitive graphical representation—now called
the Feynman diagrams—of the mathematical formulas of QED. He won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1965 for his contribution to QED.
32.2.1
Feynman Diagrams
The exchange of a photon between two electrons requires its emission by one electron and
its subsequent absorption by the other. Since emission and absorption are events, and since
such processes are inherently relativistic, they are prime candidates for actors on the stage
of spacetime diagrams.
The most elementary Feynman diagram is shown in Figure 32.1. A stationary5 electron,
represented by the directed line, emits a photon—represented by the wavy line—at event

normally are not interested in where and when the photon was emitted, we shall do away
with the grid and the axes and represent the same process by Figure 32.1(b), in which it is
understood that time runs vertically upward. Anything below the vertex is labeled initial
state, and above the vertex ﬁnal state. Thus, Figure 32.1 describes a process in which the
initial state is an electron at rest, and the ﬁnal state is an electron at rest plus a traveling

photon.
The process of Figure 32.1(a and b) is not physical and cannot take place, because
it violates the momentum conservation. Here is why. The momentum of an electron at
rest is zero, making the initial momentum zero. The ﬁnal momentum is not zero, because
the electron is not moving, but the photon carries momentum. The process also violates
the energy conservation, because initially the total energy is the energy of the stationary
electron (E = mec2), but ﬁnally it is that plus the energy of the photon. One may think
that something like Figure 32.1(c) can make the process go; however, while momentum
conservation may be saved by having the electron move in the direction opposite to the
photon, the energy conservation is still violated, because now even the ﬁnal electron alone
has more energy than the initial electron. Setting the initial electron in motion will not
save the process either, because we can always observe the process in the rest frame of the
initial electron.
So what is the use of the process of Figure 32.1 if it cannot happen? Well, it turns out
that by combining two such impossible processes, we can make a process that is possible.
After all, it is the exchange of photons that creates the force between charged elementary
particles. Figure 32.2(a) shows two electrons at rest. The left electron emits a photon at
Vi, which is subsequently absorbed by the right electron at Vf. Anything below the earlier
vertex is called the initial state, and above the later vertex the ﬁnal state. Only the

Because the photon connecting Vi and Vf is not real, we don’t know when it was emitted
and when absorbed. In fact, we don’t know whether it was emitted by the left or the right

electron and consequently absorbed by the other. Figure 32.2(b) describes exactly the same
process as Figure 32.2(a). Therefore, it is customary to detach any signiﬁcance from vertices,
remove the dots (representing events), and draw the photon horizontally, treating emission
and absorption equally [Figure 32.2(c)]. This, of course, puts the photon outside the light
cone; but since the photon is virtual and unobservable, it does not violate the theory of
relativity. Furthermore, since it is the exchange of photons that carries signiﬁcance (and
not the state of motion of the initial and ﬁnal electrons), sometimes we draw Figure 32.2(c)
as Figure 32.2(d), where the initial electrons appear to be moving towards, and the ﬁnal
electrons away from, one another. Because of this, both Figure 32.2(c) and Figure 32.2(d)
are labeled electron-electron scattering or simply e-e scattering.
Electron-electron (or
e-e) scattering.
We have not as yet talked about the positron’s role in QED interactions. The only
diﬀerence between a positron and an electron is that the former is represented by a line
with its arrow pointing down. With this addition, we can now state the QED rules for
Feynman diagrams.
Box 32.2.2. (Feynman Rules for QED) Processes in quantum electrodynamics can
be represented diagrammatically using the Feynman diagrams, which obey the follow-
ing rules:
1. Charged particles are represented by up-going directed solid lines; antiparticles’ ar-
rows point down.
2. A photon, represented by a wavy line, can be attached to any point of a directed line
at a vertex, designating an emission or an absorption.
3. The region of the diagram below all vertices is called the initial state, and that
above all vertices the ﬁnal state.
4. All lines having no end point in either the initial or the ﬁnal state represent virtual
particles and cannot be observed.
5. Any process obeying these rules, whose ﬁnal state has as much energy-momentum as
its initial state is a possible physical process.
Although stated for QED, most of the Feynman rules given here apply to other theories as
well.
Example 32.2.3. The initial state of the Feynman diagram of Figure 32.3(a) consists of a
Electron-positron (or
e+-e−) scattering.

an electromagnetic interaction. The ﬁnal state is the same as the initial state. The process is an
electron-positron scattering, or an e+-e−scattering. Figure 32.3(b) switches the positron and the
electron, but it represents an identical process, i.e., the same e+-e−scattering.

which exchange a photon at an intermediate time. The diagram represents a positron-positron, or
an e+-e+ scattering.

The rules of Box 32.2.2 allow other less obvious processes. For example, the diagram of
Figure 32.4(a) has a photon and an electron in the initial state and the same thing in the
ﬁnal state: it is a photon-electron scattering, which is also called Compton scattering,

scattering experiment in 1923 and showed that light indeed consisted of photons.
For
aesthetic reasons, one “bends” the lines at vertices and redraws the diagram of Figure 32.4(a)
as Figure 32.4(b). Note that the electron between the two vertices is virtual and cannot be
observed.
What do you know? 32.2. The accompanying ﬁgure shows some Feynman diagrams
of QED. Determine which ones are correct and which ones are wrong.
There is another rule that also applies to Feynman diagrams, which can give rise to new
processes out of old ones:
Box 32.2.4. One can twist and bend the lines joined at a vertex of a Feynman diagram
or rotate an entire Feynman diagram as long as one does not detach any line. If the
resulting diagram does not violate energy-momentum conservation, then it represents a
legitimate physical process.

state. It is an e+-e−annihilation. Conservation of energy does not allow annihilation into
absolute “nothingness.” The energy of the e+-e−pair (the rest energy, for example) has
to go somewhere. In Figure 32.4(c), it is carried away by the two photons. The process
is the annihilation of matter and antimatter into EM energy. Rotating Figure 32.4(b) by
90 degrees clockwise [or rotation of Figure 32.4(c) by 180 degrees] yields Figure 32.4(d),

Rule 2 of Box 32.2.2 precludes a process in which an odd number of directed lines end
at a vertex. Such a process would violate conservation of electric charge. For example,
diagram (a) in Figure 32.5 has an electron in its initial state and two photons in the ﬁnal.
Charge conservation
forbids certain vertices.
As it describes a process in which the negative charge of the electron disappears, it is
forbidden. The conservation of charge is a lot stricter than the conservation of energy and
momentum; it forbids diagrams that violate it even at the single-vertex level. On the other
hand, while the diagrams in Figure 32.5(b) by themselves violate momentum conservation,6
they can combine to form a diagram that conserves energy-momentum and can indeed take
e+-e−scattering.
place. Figure 32.5(c) shows such a two-vertex diagram describing another version of an
e+-e−scattering [see Figure 32.3(a) for the earlier version]. Moreover, Figure 32.5(c) can
be obtained from other legitimate Feynman diagrams by a 90-degree rotation. In fact, any
one of the diagrams of Figure 32.3 yields Figure 32.5(c) when rotated by 90 degrees.
What do you know? 32.3. Is it possible to have photon-photon scattering in QED?
That is, a scattering with only two photons in the initial state and two in the ﬁnal
state?
A vertex that violates electric charge conservation cannot stand either alone or in con-
junction with other vertices. One of the reasons for the “soft” energy-momentum conser-
vation is the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy allows the violation of its
conservation for very short time intervals [see Equation (22.3)]; short, but long enough for
the virtual energy-violating particle to go from one vertex to the other. No uncertainty
relation exists for the electric charge, and no violation of its conservation is allowed under
any circumstances.
6To see this, go to a reference frame in which e+ and e−move with equal speed in opposite directions.
The total momentum is zero, but the initial or ﬁnal photon cannot have a zero momentum.
Since the
process is impossible in this particular RF, Box 27.5.2 implies that it is impossible, period!

32.2.2
Predictions of QED
The simple diagrams of the previous subsection are only a small fraction of the complicated
QED industry which was developed after WWII. All the real processes discussed in Section
32.2.1 have only two vertices. However, for a given physical process, Feynman diagrams
with more vertices exist, whose contribution to the process must be taken into account.
For example, the e+-e−scattering of Figure 32.2 can also be described by any one of the
diagrams in Figure 32.6. These are all of second order because they include two (virtual)
photons. Figure 32.6(a) describes a process in which two photons are exchanged between
Higher-order Feynman
diagrams.
the two scattering electrons. In the four diagrams of Figure 32.6(b) one of the electrons
emits a photon and subsequently absorbs it. These diagrams represent the self-interaction
of the electrons or their self-energy. The two diagrams of Figure 32.6(c) alter the vertices
of the scattering and are therefore called vertex corrections. Figure 32.6(d) represents a
“self-interaction” of the exchanged photon. It is also called vacuum polarization.
What do you know? 32.4. How can the photons of Figure 32.6(b) bend back to be
recaptured? Are they being accelerated?
All these diagrams are legitimate and have to be included in any mathematical calcula-
tion of the e+-e−scattering. Furthermore, “higher-order corrections” involving six vertices
and more should also take part in e+-e−scattering. There are two opposing factors to
take into account when including higher-order diagrams. First, the vertex, where a pho-
ton line is attached to a charge line, has a numerical value representing the strength of
the interaction. In QED this numerical value is about 0.0854 per vertex. The strength
associated with a diagram—which is roughly the numerical value that the diagram con-
tributes to the process—is the product of the strength of all its vertices. Thus, the contri-
bution of the diagram of Figure 32.2 (recall that all diagrams in that ﬁgure are identical) is
0.0854×0.0854 = 0.00729, because there are two vertices in that diagram. The contribution
of the diagrams of Figure 32.6 is 0.08544 = 0.0000532, because there are four vertices in
those diagrams. We conclude that the diagrams of Figure 32.6 contribute much less to the
process than those of Figure 32.2.
Second, when calculating the diagrams that have loops—such as all diagrams of Fig-
ure 32.6—physicists encountered mathematical expressions that made no sense!
These
“loop” diagrams yielded inﬁnite contributions! Through the long and winded process of
renormalization, physicists were able to “tame” the inﬁnities, and make sense out of

some remarkable predictions with unprecedented accuracy, making it the most precise the-
ory ever. We brieﬂy discuss two of these predictions: the Lamb shift and the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron.
The vacuum polarization diagram of Figure 32.6(d), with the electron-positron loop
in its middle, aﬀects the nature of the exchange of photons between charged particles.
This in turn aﬀects the electromagnetic force exerted by charged elementary particles on
one another. QED, through the process of renormalization, can calculate the eﬀect of the

vacuum polarization on the force.
In essence it changes the Coulomb law of Equation
(12.1) ever so slightly.
This slight change aﬀects the potential energy of an electron in
the atom, and consequently its total energy. What this translates into is that the energy
levels of say hydrogen atoms are not −13.6/n2 as predicted by both the Bohr model and
the Schr¨odinger theory, because both these theories assume that the electric force obeys
the Coulomb law. The inclusion of vacuum polarization eﬀect changes the n = 2 energy
state of the hydrogen atom from −3.4 eV to −3.40000001122 eV. This is part of what is
called the Lamb shift, which, although tiny, is measurable; and the measurement agrees

remarkably with the theoretical calculation.
The other prediction that we intend to discuss, the anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron, has an interesting history worth telling. When an electric charge rotates about
a ﬁxed point (e.g., the center of its orbit if the orbit is circular) it acquires two properties,
angular momentum L and magnetic moment µ. We are already familiar with the former
(see Section 8.2.2). The latter arises due to the electric charge of the revolving object. A
charge in motion is an electric current; this current produces a magnetic ﬁeld. When the
charge moves on a loop, the magnetic ﬁeld can be associated with a magnetic moment,7
which is related to the angular momentum of the electric charge. Math Note E.32.2 on
Relation between
angular momentum and
magnetic moment.
page 140 of Appendix.pdf shows how to obtain this relation for a circular motion: for a
charge q with mass m, the result is µ = (q/2m)L.
In the early days of quantum mechanics, when angular momentum was quantized and
the spin of the electron was discovered, it became apparent that the magnetic moment µ
should also be quantized. Moreover, since electron spin (its intrinsic angular momentum)
is 1
2ℏ, it was concluded that the magnetic moment of the electron should be µe = qℏ/(4m).
Early experiments, on the other hand, were measuring µe to be qℏ/(2m) exactly twice the
expected value! This was partly the reason to realize that “spin” had nothing to do with

the “angular rotation.”
One of the early successes of the Dirac equation (see Section 32.1) was the prediction that
µe should be qℏ/(2m). Thus, Dirac’s marriage of relativity and quantum theory not only
gave us the antimatter, but also clariﬁed the mysterious notion of spin. As experimental

techniques improved, physicists could measure µe more and more accurately, and in the
process realized that it was slightly larger than that predicted by the Dirac theory. This
slight diﬀerence came to be known as the anomaly of µe.
It was quickly realized that the anomaly could be explained by going beyond the simple
Dirac theory and using the quantized version of the Dirac equation, i.e., employing the
full power of QED. When diagrams such as the two shown in Figure 32.6(c) and higher-
order Feynman diagrams are calculated and renormalized, QED predicts a very precise
value for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. In the following equation,
we compare the predicted theoretical value and the measured experimental value of the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron:

The 2 comes from the Dirac equation, the rest from QED corrections to it. That we have
a theory that can predict a physical quantity to such a high precision is remarkable. It is
even more remarkable that we have instruments that can measure that quantity with equal
precision. And it is miraculous that the two agree!
Food for Thought
FFT 32.2.5. Equation (32.1) greatly deserves our awe and admiration. It is the culmination of
a game; the kind of scientiﬁc game that dwarfs any major-league baseball event, any football bowl,
any basketball, wrestling, or hockey extravaganza. It is a 400-year-old game that Galileo started
with his inclined planes, a game between experimentalists and theorists that draws in the utmost
intellectual prowess of our race.
Not a single “practical application” of the precise determination of the electronic magnetic
moment anomaly has yet been found. Nevertheless Equation (32.1) remains an invaluable jewel of
humanity. Hidden from the eyes and minds of ordinary men and women, it shines with a light that
only the mind-eye of a few can detect.
Pause and ponder for a moment! Equation (32.1) contains a physical property of one of the
most fundamental constituents of nature, a particle that exists in everything we see, hear, touch,
and smell (as well as many other things that we don’t see, hear, touch, or smell); a microscopic
part of a fragrant rose and an unseeable galaxy.
Equation (32.1) also contains the result of a
calculation performed by the human mind using mathematical symbols invented by the human
mind. Now take one of the countless number of the electrons in the rose, or an unreachable one in
the unseeable galaxy; take it to any laboratory that can measure its magnetic moment accurately;
read the measurement on the computer interface; then consult any book on quantum ﬁeld theory
and learn the mathematical techniques developed there; take a piece of paper (a large one!) and
calculate the precise value of the magnetic moment of the electron; and feel the miracle of Equation
(32.1)!
How is it that the human mind can produce (predict) a number that happens to be hidden
in the heart of the matter at the heart of an invisible galaxy? Isn’t it spectacular that nature
has developed an organ that, through abstract manipulation, can understand its own origin and
constituents? Isn’t it unfortunate that only a small fraction of our race can appreciate this? And
isn’t it a disaster that this fraction is dwindling year in year out?

Answers to “What do you know?”
32.1. No! If it were, then Box 32.1.2 would allow a neutron of the nucleus of a radioisotope
to decay into an antiproton, an electron, and a neutrino.
The antiproton then would
annihilate a proton of the nucleus. This would increase the ratio of neutrons to protons,
making the nucleus less stable, causing more neutron decays, annihilating more protons,
etc., until the entire nucleus is annihilated.
32.2. Starting from left: First diagram is wrong because it has two photons attached to a
single vertex; second diagram is okay; third diagram is okay, it is positron-photon scattering;
fourth diagram is okay, it is photon-photon scattering; ﬁfth is wrong (you tell me why!);
last diagram is also wrong.
32.3. Yes! But the Feynman diagram is of a “higher order!” That is, you need four vertices
to get an appropriate Feynman diagram. The diagram

These photons are not physical. They are virtual photons and can violate certain
physical principles. After all, the photons of Figure 32.3 are horizontal, but it makes no
sense to say that they are going faster than light, because they are virtual (they are not
part of the initial or ﬁnal state).

Classifying Particles and Forces
The invention of the accelerators in the 1930s and their rapid development after WWII
opened up a new vista for fundamental physics research.
The few particles that made
themselves known in the early days of nuclear physics were only the tip of an iceberg. By
the mid 1950s the accelerators produced so many new particles that physicists felt like
eighteenth century zoologists facing a seemingly endless variety of “animals” to study. And
just like the zoologists, they embarked on their classiﬁcation.
The initial key to this classiﬁcation was the strength of the particles’ interaction with
matter. By forcefully injecting the new particles into varying thicknesses of lead, physicists
Hadrons and leptons.
could identify two major categories of particles: those that were stopped quickly (i.e., after
moving a short distance) were called hadrons1 because they must have interacted with
matter very strongly; the remaining particles, thought to be “lighter” than hadrons, were
named leptons—derived from the Greek word for light.
Another scheme of classifying particles, which was probably more important than their
stopping distance in lead, was their half-life. With the exception of the proton, electron,
neutrino, and their antiparticles, all known particles were unstable, i.e., they did not live
forever. For example, a free neutron was known to decay into a proton, an electron, and
an antineutrino in about 15 minutes.2 Based on the length of their half-lives, particles’
interactions were divided into three categories: strong, weak, and electromagnetic.
Particles partaking in the strong interaction had a very short half-life (of the order of
10−20 s); those participating in the weak interaction had a long half life (of the order of
10−6 s and longer); electromagnetic interaction was represented by an intermediate half-
life. By deﬁnition, only hadrons took part in strong interactions. They could, of course,
participate in other interactions as well. [For example, the neutron beta decay is known to
be a weak interaction even though neutron is a hadron.] However, particles that did not
have strong interactions were not hadrons. Before talking about hadrons and leptons, let’s
see what exactly is a particle.

The decade of the 1860s is a landmark in the history of mathematics. In the latter part
of that decade, a young Norwegian mathematician was playing with some geometric ideas,
which later were developed into one of the most charming branches of mathematics. The
young Norwegian was Sophus Lie (1842–1899), and his ideas culminated in what is now

physicists and mathematicians subsequently encountered many other types of diﬀerential

group theory, which had been created to investigate the possibility of ﬁnding the roots
of polynomials, he could systematically ﬁnd solutions to many diﬀerential equations, and
also explain why the ingenious tricks worked.
Both the technique and the ideas of Lie
group theory were highly abstract, to such a degree that, according to some historians,
mathematicians thought that they had ﬁnally stumbled on something that physicists had
no way of using. But the aesthetic appeal of Lie groups could not have escaped Nature,
who found it to be the best medium in which to compose her poetry.
Recognizing a generalization of the Lorentz transformations (called the Poincar´e trans-
formations) as a Lie group, Eugene Wigner (1902–1995), the Hungarian-born American
mathematical physicist, set out to analyze it. In mathematical jargon, he was looking for
a representation of the Poincar´e group. A representation is a set of matrices that have
identical properties as the group elements, and a set of states similar to the Ψ function of
the quantum theory (see Section 22.3). In 1939, in a historic paper that won him the Nobel
Prize, Wigner succeeded in ﬁnding the representation and the states. Of signiﬁcance to us
is the latter.
Wigner’s work showed that Einstein’s special theory of relativity, in the context of
Lorentz (or rather Poincar´e) transformations, classiﬁed particles using three numbers: one
associated with mass, another associated with spin, and the third associated with the pro-
jection of the spin (called the third component of spin) along some line. Mass, m, can be
any nonnegative number; spin, s, can be a nonnegative integer or a positive half-odd integer
(multiple of ℏ, as discussed also in Section 23.3.1); the third component of spin, s3, needs
a little more explanation.
Since most particles of interest are moving (more or less on a straight line), it is natural
to consider the directed line of their motion for the discussion of s3.
If the particle is
massive, s3 can take—in units of ℏ—any value between −s and +s incremented by 1 from
the lowest to the highest values.
Massless particles can have only two values for their s3: −s and +s, with no intermediate
values. The state with +s, i.e., with the projection of the spin along the direction of motion,

is called a positive helicity or a right-handed state, and the state with −s, i.e., with
the projection of the spin opposite to the direction of motion, is called a negative helicity
or a left-handed state. These two states are related via a mirror symmetry. Let’s see
what this means.3
Recall from our discussion in Section 8.2.2 that the angular momentum direction is
associated to a rotation via the right-hand rule: point the thumb of your right hand in the
direction of the angular momentum and curl your ﬁngers; the direction of your ﬁngers shows
the direction of the associated rotation. Figure 33.1 shows a massless particle moving with
velocity v (necessarily equal to the speed of light as pointed out in Box 28.3.3) having a
projection of spin along the line of motion. The particle in Figure 33.1(a) is right handed,
while that in Figure 33.1(b) is left handed.
Now suppose you look at Figure 33.1(a) in a mirror. The direction of the velocity changes
(if you move your ﬁnger towards the mirror, its image comes towards you). What about
the direction of the spin? Stand in front of a mirror and whirl your hand clockwise. Look
at the image of your whirling hand. It is also moving clockwise! Rotations do not change
3A word of caution! Quantum spin has no classical analogue. What is to follow is a classical analysis,
which, as far as mirror symmetry is concerned, also works for spin.

direction in the mirror. Therefore, the image of Figure 33.1(a) is precisely Figure 33.1(b).
Similarly, you can convince yourself that the mirror image of Figure 33.1(b) is Figure 33.1(a):
the mirror image of a right-handed particle is a left-handed particle and vice versa. And
Wigner showed that both right-handed and left-handed particles should be present in the
representation of the Poincar´e group. In summary,
Box 33.1.1. A particle is described by its mass, m, its spin s, and the projection of its
spin along motion direction. Spin can be a nonnegative integer multiple of ℏ(Bosons) or
a nonnegative odd multiple of 1
2ℏ(Fermions). In units of ℏ, spin projection of massive
particles can be any value between −s and s incremented by one, while massless particles
can have −s (left-handed state) or +s (right-handed state) for their spin projection.

33.2
Hadrons
Walking in the footsteps of the eighteenth century zoologists, the mid twentieth century
physicists began to divide the “kingdom” of particles into “families,” “genre,” and “species.”
Based on their spin, the hadrons were divided into baryons and mesons. The baryons are
hadrons that have half-integer spins, while the spins of the mesons are integer. Examples
of baryons are protons and neutrons, and of mesons, the pions.
The baryons seemed to hold a special place in the community of particles. It seemed
that in any collision process, as violent as it might have been and as many diﬀerent kinds of
particles it might have created out of the energy of the initial colliding particles, the total
number of baryons at the end was equal to that at the beginning. There was a baryonic

conservation.
charge conservation at work, very similar to the electric charge conservation: If you
subtract the total number of negative baryons from the total number of positive baryons
before the collision and do the same after the collision, the two are always equal. In other
words, every time a new positive baryon is created in a collision, it should accompany a
negative baryon. In general, positive baryonic charge is assigned to particles and negative to
the corresponding antiparticle. Thus, protons and neutrons have positive baryonic charge;
their antiparticles, negative.
Mesons, on the other hand, could be created and annihilated individually, and they
were produced profusely. One group of mesons caught the attention of physicists; they were

496

collectively called kaons or the K-mesons. Because of the mode of their production, the
electrically neutral kaons were expected to participate only in the strong nuclear interac-
tions; but they showed clear signs of weak nuclear interaction by their long half-lives. This
strange behavior prompted M. Gell-Mann and K. Nishijima to introduce another “charge,”
Kaons and strangeness.
similar to the electric and baryonic charge, called strangeness. However, unlike its pre-
decessors, which are strictly conserved in all kinds of interactions, strangeness can change.
In fact, it was soon realized that kaons could decay into nonstrange particles through the
medium of the weak nuclear force.

Σ+ + η0 →K0 + K+ + π0
and
Ξ−+ p →K0 + n + π0
Hint: Look at Figure 33.2 and invoke certain conservation law.
Kaons were only one group of hadrons that were assembled together because of their
strangeness. Soon physicists discovered that using other properties, which were invented for
classiﬁcation purposes, they could group particles into multiplets. For example, the oldest
particles, the proton and neutron, formed a doublet because of a property called isospin,
Isospin is a property of
particles used in their
classiﬁcation.
while the three pions formed an isospin triplet. The grouping of particles based on their
isospin was not random. Particles that fell into the same isospin multiplet shared many
common properties including mass: particles belonging to the same isospin multiplet had
almost the same mass, so in some sense, they were (almost) diﬀerent “states” of the same
physical entity.
33.2.1
Eightfold Way: Mathematical Poetry II
In the decade of the 1960s, as if to celebrate the Lie groups’ centennial, two physicists, M.
Eightfold way and
classiﬁcation of hadrons.
Gell-Mann and Y. Ne’eman, used them to successfully classify all the known hadrons of the
time into multiplets. This classiﬁcation, which employed isospin and strangeness, came to
be known as the eightfold way.
Following the mathematicians’ practice of the representation of Lie groups, Gell-Mann
and Ne’eman constructed two perpendicular axes. The horizontal axis was the (“third com-
ponent of the”) isospin I3, and the vertical was the strangeness S. The eightfold way then
more or less dictated how many and in what order the particles were to assemble themselves
in the I3S-plane. It also predicted that certain quantum numbers were shared by all the
particles in a multiplet. One of these quantum numbers was spin. For example, the three
pions, all four kaons, and another meson η0, which seemed to be a lonely singlet, all assem-
bled in a spin-zero octet shown in Figure 33.2(a). Similarly, the known baryons, including
our old friends the proton and neutron, formed a spin- 1
2 octet4 shown in Figure 33.2(b).
The construction and operation of accelerators in the decade of the 1950s produced
many new hadrons, for many of which the eightfold way found appropriate positions on the
I3S-plane. Moreover, since none of the multiplets were completely “ﬁlled,” the eightfold
way predicted many particles in the same fashion that Mendeleev table predicted many
elements a century earlier.5 For instance, in 1961, when the eightfold way was proposed,
Eightfold way predicts
the existence and
properties of η0.
only seven spin-zero mesons were known. The η0 had not yet been produced. The eightfold
way predicted not only the existence of η0, but also its approximate mass. Furthermore, the
shear membership of Ξ−and Ξ0 to the baryon octet of Figure 33.2(b) was suﬃcient proof
that their spin, which was unknown at the time of their discovery, would have to be 1
2, a
4Recall that spin is given in units of ℏ(Planck constant divided by 2π).
5There is a fundamental diﬀerence between Mendeleev table and the eightfold way: The former is purely
empirical, the latter purely mathematical.

prediction that was later veriﬁed by further experimental analysis. However, the greatest
success story of the eightfold way was yet to come.
In the “zoo” of many particles known in 1961 were four spin 3
2 baryons: ∆−, ∆0, ∆+,
and ∆++. These particles could not ﬁt in an octet, but either a decuplet (10-particle) or
a 27-particle multiplet could accommodate them. A decuplet would form a triangle in the
I3S-plane, while a 27-particle multiplet would correspond to a large hexagon. In the same
year, three new particles, Σ∗−, Σ∗0, and Σ∗+, were discovered, which had strangeness −1,
but their spin was not known at the time. These particles could also ﬁt in either a decuplet
or a 27-member family.
BIOGRAPHY
Murray Gell-Mann was born on September 15, 1929, in New York City. Upon graduation from high
school at the age of 15, he went to Yale University, where four years later he obtained his B.Sc.
For graduate work, Gell-Mann attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and after only
three years, at the young age of 21, he was awarded a Ph.D. degree. In 1953 he and the Japanese
team of Nakano and Nishijima independently proposed the notion of “strangeness” which became the
cornerstone of particle classiﬁcation, leading to the “eightfold way,” which Gell-Mann and the Israeli
physicist Ne’eman discovered independently. Gell-Mann’s persistent investigation of the eightfold way
led to the prediction of the omega minus, which was discovered shortly after its prediction, and the
quark theory, which is at the foundation of the successful theory of strong interactions. Gell-Mann won
the Nobel Prize in physics in 1969 for his classiﬁcation of particles.
At a 1962 conference of particle physicists held at CERN (Centre European pour la
Recherche Nucleaure), Geneva, now known as the European Center for Particle Physics, two
new particles, Ξ∗−with strangeness −2 and electric charge −1, and Ξ∗0 with strangeness
−2 and electric charge 0, were reported. They ﬁtted nicely in either the decuplet or the
27-member multiplet. However, the failure—also reported at the conference—to see any
other members that would ﬁll the 27-member multiplet made the choice clear. Here is how
Ne’eman described the excitement felt in that conference:

subsequent discovery of
Ω−.
The creators of the eightfold way, who attended the conference, felt that this ‘failure’
clearly pointed out that the solution lay in the decuplet.
They saw the [inverted]

missing, and with the aid of the model they had conceived, it was possible to describe
exactly what the properties of the missing particle should be! Before the conclusion of
the conference Gell-Mann went up to the blackboard and spelled out the anticipated
characteristics of the missing particle, which he called ‘omega minus’ (because of its
negative charge and because omega is the last letter of the Greek alphabet). [Pag 83,
pp. 200–201]
As Figure 33.3 suggests, unlike the other members of the decuplet family which have
siblings, the Ω−is a lonely isospin singlet with strangeness −3 and spin 3
2. Other properties
of the Ω−, including its mass (an important property for experimentalists, because it tells
them how much energy is needed to produce the particle), could be predicted from the
eightfold way formalism. After “hunting” for the particle for a couple months, the Ω−was
captured in one of about 100,000 photographs taken by a group of 33 physicists at the
Brookhaven National Laboratory at the end of 1963. In February 1964, the group oﬃcially
announced the discovery of the Ω−.

“Fundamentalism” in Hadron Physics: The Quarks
Whenever a phenomenological theory such as the eightfold way succeeds, physicists instinc-

discoveries in physics.
tively look for the “deeper” reason behind its success. We have already seen this instinct in
the case of Planck’s discovery of the electromagnetic quanta. This “fundamentalism” may
annoy some philosophers of science (see Section 20.2.2), but it is the only eﬀective way of
discovering hidden secrets of Nature. Fortunately for physics, the creators of the eightfold
way did not heed the warnings of the philosophers against such fundamentalism and sought
a deeper underlying theory.
The clue to a more fundamental theory is revealed from the Lie group theory itself. It
turns out that all the multiplets of the Lie group used in the eightfold way can be “built”
from a single shape: a triangle. Figure 33.4 shows the construction of the octet and the
decuplet from triangles. All the other multiplets can also be constructed out of triangles.
Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig, working independently at Caltech in 1964, came
up with the idea that the triangular mathematical building block of the eightfold way ought
to be reﬂected in Nature as three distinct spin 1
2 fundamental particles, from which all the
hadrons are built. This distinction is characterized by assigning a ﬂavor to each quark.
Quarks, quark model,
and up, down, and
strange ﬂavors.
Gel-Mann, borrowing from James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, called these particles quarks.
On the basis of this quark model, all hadrons are made up of three ﬂavors of quark and
their antiparticles. The three quarks (or ﬂavors of quark) are the up quark, denoted by u,

the down quark, denoted by d, and the strange quark, denoted by s. Their antiparticles
are designated by putting a bar over the symbol: ¯u, ¯d, and ¯s.
Their name is not the only thing that is weird about quarks. They have unusual electric
and baryonic charges as well. Every known particle has an electric charge that is an integral
multiple of the charge of a proton e (e = 1.6 × 10−19 Coulomb). However, quarks have
fractional charges. The charge of the up quark is + 2
3e. The down and strange quarks have
equal charges of −1
3e. Similarly, the baryonic charges of all known baryons are either +1
or −1, but for quarks it is 1
3, and for antiquarks −1
3. The important properties of quarks
are summarized in Table 33.1. The charges of antiquarks have opposite signs.

Table 33.1: Properties of quarks.
All the hadrons can be explained by the following simple rules:
Box 33.2.1. (Rules of quark model) All baryons are constructed out of three quarks
(antibaryons out of three antiquarks).
All mesons are made up of a quark and an
antiquark. The spin of each quark (or antiquark) is 1
2.
For example, a proton is made up of one down and two up quarks. One up and two down
quarks make a neutron. The positive pion π+ consists of one up and one antidown quark;
π−has one down and one antiup quark; and π0 is a hybrid of a down-antidown pair and
an up-antiup pair. All K-mesons have an s quark (or its antiparticle). For instance, K+
consists of an up and an antistrange quark; K−, the antiparticle of K+, consists of an
antiup and a strange quark. When a down quark combines with an antistrange quark, they
make a K0; when their antiparticles combine they form a ¯K0.
What do you know? 33.3. Look at Table 33.1 and explain why there is no meson
with strangeness −1 and electric charge +1.

and S for the strangeness.
Example 33.2.2. The quark model explained certain mysteries of particle production that were
hitherto unexplained. To understand the mystery, let us ask the following question:
Q1: How many diﬀerent kinds of meson can you get by combining the three quarks and their
antiquarks? Arrange these in order of decreasing electric charge.
A1: The highest electric charge of +1 is obtained by combining u with a ¯d or an ¯s. There
are ﬁve possibilities for neutral mesons: u¯u, d ¯d, s¯s, d¯s, and s ¯d. The mesons of the lowest electric
charge of −1 are simply the antiparticles of the mesons of highest charge: d¯u, and s¯u.
Therefore, there are only nine possibilities for mesons. This explains why there are no mesons
carrying two units of electric charge (while there is a baryon of electric charge +2, namely ∆++),
and why there is no meson of strangeness −1 and electric charge +1, or of strangeness +1 and
electric charge −1.
Q2: How many diﬀerent kinds of baryon can you get by combining three quarks? Arrange
these in order of decreasing electric charge.
A2: The highest electric charge of +2 is obtained by combining three u quarks. There are two
possibilities for the electric charge of +1: uud and uus; three possibilities for neutral baryons: udd,
uds, and uss; and four possibilities for the electric charge of −1: ddd, dds, dss, and sss.
■
What do you know? 33.4. Is it possible for a baryon (not an antibaryon) to have
strangeness +1? How about +2?
The example above illustrates the power and simplicity of the quark model.
Table
33.2 shows all the hadrons predicted by the quark model. The model does not allow certain
combination of charge and strangeness. For example, a baryon of strangeness −3 and charge
0 or +1 is not allowed by the quark model, while it could exist in a family of 27 members
according to the eightfold way. The fact that such baryons have not been discovered, lends
strong support for the quark model.
How does the quark model account for the spin of hadrons? Recall from Section 23.3.2
that there are two possible (and opposite) directions for a spin of 1
2. Call these directions
positive and negative. Now consider a quark and an antiquark making up a meson. If one
of the spins of the quark and antiquark is positive and the other negative, they cancel; the
spin of the meson is zero. If both spins are positive (or negative), they add and the spin
of the meson is 1 (the −1 arising from two negative spins is the projection of the resulting
spin; the spin itself is always positive). For baryons, if all spins align, the result is a spin
3
2 baryon; if one of the spins is opposite to the other two (thus canceling one of the spins),
we get a spin 1
2 baryon.
Figure 33.5 shows a sample of spin possibilities for some baryons and mesons. In the
ﬁrst row of the ﬁgure are collected four baryons of spin 1
2. The down spin cancels one of
the up spins leaving the baryon with only one quark spin. The baryons of row (a) belong

of Figure 33.5 are four mesons, the ﬁrst three of which show up in the spin zero octet of
Figure 33.2(a). The last meson, ρ+, is one of eight spin-1 mesons, which also make up an
eightfold way octet (which we have not discussed).
In fact, there are many higher-spin hadrons (e.g., spin-2 mesons and spin- 5
2 baryons),
called resonances, forming octets and decuplets (which we also have not discussed). The
highest spin one can get solely from the quark spins is 3
2 for baryons and 1 for mesons. So
where does the extra spin come from? Our discussion of spin in Section 23.3.2 showed that
the total angular momentum consists of two parts: orbital and spin. Thus, if the quarks
are orbiting one another inside a hadron, their orbital angular momentum could add to the
total spin of the composite particle. Since orbital angular momentum takes on only integer
values (see Box 23.3.2), it does not change the spin nature of the hadrons: mesons still have
integer spins, baryons half-integer.
The quark model described in this subsection was proposed in 1964; and for a long
time experimentalists tried to isolate a quark by violently bombarding hadrons. However,
Structure within protons

despite an exponential increase in the energy of the accelerators, no free quark has ever
been reported. The appeal and simplicity of the quark model is too much to give up just
because free quarks are not observed. In fact, in very energetic collisions, the so-called
“deep inelastic scatterings,” there has been clear evidence for “structure” within hadrons.
If these structures are an indication of quarks, as everybody thinks, why are there no free
quarks? How do quarks interact with one another? Are there really just three kinds of
quark? May there be more varieties that we have not seen yet? These and other questions
can be answered within the context of the forces that quarks experience from one another,
and a deeper study of the other group of particles we have ignored so far, the leptons. But
ﬁrst some collision chemistry!

Box 33.2.3. (Particle Collision Rules) In any particle collision, the following rules
hold:
1. The total ﬂavor (quark or lepton) of any kind before the collision equals the total
ﬂavor after collision.
2. The kinetic energy of the colliding particles can turn into matter according to
E = mc2. Every matter particle thus formed must accompany its antiparticle.
Similarly, every particle can annihilate its antiparticle into pure energy.
3. No free quark can be created. All the quarks “bag” themselves into hadrons ac-
cording to Box 33.2.1.
As an example consider a proton-proton collision shown in Figure 33.6. Initially [Fig-
ure 33.6(a)] there are four u quarks and two d quarks moving at very high speed represented
by the heavy long arrows attached to the two protons. Figure 33.6(b) shows schematically
the quark and energy content of the collision. Some of the large energy of Figure 33.6(b)
is converted into three quark-antiquark pairs (the shaded quarks) in Figure 33.6(c). Note
that each quark created is accompanied by its antiquark. The creation shown is only one
of many possibilities constrained only by energy conservation. If the available energy of
Figure 33.6(b) is small, fewer quark-antiquark pairs are created; and if the energy is too
small, no pairs may be created. The quarks so created cannot be free; they must assemble
themselves into hadrons. Figure 33.6(d) shows one possible result of quark-antiquark as-
sembly. The name of each hadron is shown next to its “bag.” It is worth noting that there
are two baryons in the ﬁnal state, as required by the baryon-number conservation.

The simple quark model we are considering cannot predict what the exact outcome of
each collision is. In fact, such a prediction is impossible due to the statistical nature of the
quantum theory. The most complete theory can only predict the probability of a particular
ﬁnal state out of all possible states. Our simple quark model cannot even do this. It can
only say that given suﬃcient amount of energy, the reaction of Figure 33.6, which can be
written as

is also possible. Furthermore, allowing for the variation in the types (ﬂavors) of quark-
antiquark pairs created, many other collision products become possible, the probability of
none of which is addressed by our simple quark model.

Refer to Figures 33.2 and 33.5 and Table 33.1 for quark content and quark properties.
You don’t need hadrons to create hadrons. One of the most common ways of creat-
ing hadrons is colliding electrons and positrons. In a typical experiment, e−and e+ are
accelerated to very high speeds in opposite directions and made to collide with one an-
other. Figure 33.7 shows a typical such collision. Initially [Figure 33.7(a)] the electron and
positron approach each other with high speed. The annihilation of e−and e+ results in
the creation of pure energy. Figure 33.6(b) shows schematically the energy content of the
collision. Some of the large energy of Figure 33.6(b) is converted into ﬁve quark-antiquark
pairs in Figure 33.6(c). The creation shown is only one of many possibilities constrained
only by energy conservation. The quarks so created cannot be free; they must assemble
themselves into hadrons. Figure 33.6(d) shows one possible result of quark-antiquark as-
sembly. Note that there is one baryon and one antibaryon in the ﬁnal state, as required by
the baryon-number conservation.
Hadrons are not the only particles created in either the p-p collision of Figure 33.6 or
the e+-e−of Figure 33.7. It is quite possible that other kinds of particles, for example
leptons, are also created. In fact, new leptons (discussed in the next section) were created
in collisions such a the ones described above.

33.3
Leptons
The world of leptons is nothing like the overcrowded world of hadrons. Since leptons do
not participate in the strong interaction, they cannot form particles as do quarks. So there
are only a handful of leptons, and despite subjecting them to violent collisions, no structure
has been found inside leptons. As far as we know, all leptons are fundamental particles.
33.3.1
The Electron
The ﬁrst lepton, the electron, was discovered in 1897 as one of the constituents of atoms.
It is negatively charged, has spin 1
2, and like proton, is absolutely stable, in the sense that
it never disintegrates.
There is a good reason for this stability. We know that electric
charge is conserved. We also know that electron is the lightest electrically charged particle.
Furthermore, in any disintegration, the ﬁnal decay products must be lighter than the de-
caying particle.6 Since there are no charged particles lighter than the electron, it becomes
impossible for it to disintegrate.
Electron is the best known elementary particle partly because it was the ﬁrst to be
discovered, but more importantly, because we have a remarkably successful theory (the
Dirac equation and its oﬀspring quantum electrodynamics) describing the electron with
unprecedented accuracy. Because of such precise knowledge of the electron, the electronic
industry has been able to harness this particle to a point where it can manipulate micro-
scopic currents, and construct miniature integrated circuits and microchips—the heart of
all computers.
33.3.2
The Muon
As mentioned earlier, in the confusion ensuing Yukawa’s proposal of a particle responsible
for nuclear forces, muon was erroneously identiﬁed as the Yukawa particle initially. Later,
6You can always move along with the (necessarily massive) decaying particle—which, therefore, appears
motionless to you—and watch its disintegration process (see Box 27.5.2). Then the mass of the decaying
particle is the source of the energy before decay (E = mc2), which must be distributed among the masses
and the KEs of the decay products.

Section 33.3

it was discovered that the pions were the true sought-after particles, and that muon was
a decay product of pions. Muons are one of the most abundant particles in the cosmic
radiation at the surface of the Earth. Each second thousands of muons pass through our
bodies, both due to their speed and because they are not strongly interacting.
Except for muon mass, which is about 200 times that of the electron, there is no other
appreciable diﬀerence between the two. Muon itself has spin 1
2 and is negatively charged
and its antiparticle has the same spin but positive charge. In fact, muon is so much like an
electron that it is sometimes called a “fat electron.” Its enormous mass is a good source
of energy for its decay. Unlike electron, which cannot ﬁnd a lighter charged particle into
which to decay, the muon can easily decay into an electron plus other particles.
BIOGRAPHY
Leon M. Lederman was born in New York in 1922 of immigrant parents. After graduating from high
school in 1943, Leon spent three years in the US Army. Then, in September of 1946 he entered the
Graduate School of Physics at Columbia, where he participated in the construction of a 385 MeV
Synchrocyclotron. After receiving his Ph.D. in 1951, he was invited to stay on, which he did, for the
next 28 years. In 1958, Lederman took his ﬁrst sabbatical at CERN where he organized a group to do
an experiment measuring the precise magnetic moment of the electron. In 1979, he became Director
of the Fermi Lab where he supervised the construction of one of the highest energy accelerators in
the world. Recently Lederman has been increasingly involved in promoting science education for gifted
children and public understanding of science. He helped to found the Illinois Mathematics and Science
Academy, a three year residence public school for gifted children in the State of Illinois. Lederman
shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in physics for his discovery of the muon neutrino.
33.3.3
The Neutrinos
An analysis similar to the beta decay of neutron (see Section 31.3.1) reveals that there are
two other particles accompanying the electron in the decay of muon; and the elusiveness
of those particles point to their identity as neutrinos. Neutrinos are so elusive that to stop
half of the ones produced in a typical nuclear decay, one needs a slab of lead that is not a
few centimeters, or a few meters, or a few kilometers, but a few light years thick!
The two neutrinos produced in a muon decay interact diﬀerently with matter. When
the energy of one of them is transformed into matter upon impact with other particles, a
positron is produced, while the other neutrino always produces a muon. Because of this
distinction, particle physicists call the ﬁrst one an electron neutrino, denoted as νe, and
the second one a muon neutrino, denoted as νµ. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of all
Flavor, also a property
of leptons.
reactions involving muons, electrons, and neutrinos indicates that, just as in the case of
quarks, there is a new kind of conserved leptonic charge called ﬂavor.
Electron and its neutrino carry an “electron ﬂavor,” while muon and its neutrino carry
a “muon ﬂavor.” Their antiparticles (and antineutrinos) carry the corresponding opposite
ﬂavor. In any reaction, the total electron and muon ﬂavor is conserved. Thus, in the muon
decay, the electron e−accompanies an electron antineutrino ¯νe and a muon neutrino νµ.
The ﬂavor of e−cancels the opposite ﬂavor of ¯νe (so that the total electron ﬂavor at the end
becomes zero and equal to the initial electron ﬂavor), and the initial muon ﬂavor is carried
away by νµ. We write this reaction as
µ−→e−+ ¯νe + νµ.
(33.3)
What do you know? 33.8. Which of the following reactions are possible?
e−+ e+ →µ−+ e+,
e+µ−→νµ + ¯νe,
µ−+ e+ →µ+ + e−,
e+µ−→νe + ¯νe
µ−+ ¯νe →e+ + νµ,
e−+ νµ →µ−+ νe

Neutrinos have another property which is unique to them. Although their spin is 1
2,
Neutrinos are
left-handed.
and they are expected to have positive and negative helicities (see Section 33.1), neutrinos
have only negative helicity; and antineutrinos have only positive helicity. Since neutrinos
participate only in the weak interaction, we say that weak interaction breaks the mirror-
image symmetry. In the high energy physics community, this property has been summarized
by saying: “God is a weak left-hander!”
That’s it! Only four leptons, two charged and two neutral! At least that was the story
until the 1970s when a “cultural revolution” in the physics of fundamental interactions
undermined the established wisdom, both theoretically and experimentally.

Answers to “What do you know?”
33.1.
It would mean that the special theory of relativity is wrong because STR with a
mathematical rigor implies that spin can only be integer of half integer.
33.2. They both violate baryon number conservation. The ﬁrst reaction has a baryon on
the left and none on the right. The second reaction has two baryons on the left and one on
the right.
33.3. To have strangeness −1, the meson must have an s quark. The other constituent of
a meson is an antiquark. If the antiquark partner is ¯u, then the charge of the meson will
be −1; if it is ¯d or ¯s, then the meson will be electrically neutral.
33.4.
No! A baryon consists of three quarks. If the baryon is to have any strangeness,
then it must have at least one s quark. But s quark has strangeness −1. So, no positive
strangeness is possible for baryons.
33.5. It would be purely energy, because all the quarks in p annihilate their antiquarks in
¯p and turn into energy.
33.6.
Determine the quark content of both sides and make sure that each ﬂavor of the
quark is preserved in the reaction, allowing for the cancellation of a quark by its antiquark
on the right-hand side. For example, the quark content of the left-hand side of the ﬁrst
reaction is uuduud, and the particles on the right-hand side, respectively, have the quark
contents, u¯s, d¯u, uus, uds, u ¯d, and d¯s. If you cancel all the quarks and their corresponding
antiquarks on the right-hand side, you’ll end up with uuuudd, which is the quark content
of the left-hand side. So, the ﬁrst reaction is possible. Similarly, the second reaction is
impossible; third is possible; and fourth is impossible.
33.7. The left-hand side doesn’t have any quark. So, all the quarks on the right-hand side
must accompany their antiquarks. Refer to Figures 33.2 and 33.5 and Table 33.1 for quark
content and quark properties. Following this rule, you should get the following answers:
The ﬁrst reaction is possible; the second and third reactions are impossible.
33.8. The ﬁrst reaction has no net ﬂavor on the left, but muon and antielectron ﬂavor on
the right. The second reaction is ﬁne. Third reaction has anti-electron ﬂavor on the left and
electron ﬂavor on the right, and the opposite for muon. Fourth reaction has muon ﬂavor
on the left but none on the right. Fifth reaction is ﬁne. The last reaction is ﬁne.

Conceptual Exercises
33.1. You send a beam of particles through a piece of lead a few centimeters thick, and
note that nothing comes out at the other end. Did the beam consist of hadrons or leptons?
33.2. You send a beam of particles through a piece of lead a few meters thick, and note
that a fraction of the beam comes out at the other end. Does the emerging beam consist
of hadrons or leptons or both?
33.3. A beam of hadrons consisting of a single species of particles is sent through an
inhomogeneous magnetic ﬁeld as in Section 23.3.2 and Figure 23.7. It is observed that four
blobs are formed on the capturing screen. Are the particles baryons or mesons?
33.4. In Figure 33.2, the meson hexagon is symmetric about the horizontal axis but the
baryon hexagon is not. Why? Hint: Think quarks!
33.5. With three quarks you can make only a handful of hadrons. Where do hundreds of
hadrons discovered in the 1950s and 1960s come from? Hint: Quarks in a hadron can be in
higher energy states, just like the hydrogen atom, but these energies are millions of times
larger than those of H-atom.

Chapter34
The Standard Model
The successful classiﬁcation of strongly interacting particles (or hadrons) in the scheme of
eightfold way and the subsequent discovery of the quark model answered the question of
which hadrons have similar properties and what they are made of. The question of the
dynamics of the interaction of hadrons remained unanswered (or alternatively, had multiple
answers).
Although the quark model explained the variety of the observed hadrons, the fact that
quarks were never observed in isolation made it hard for many physicists to take the model
seriously. If hadrons are made up of quarks, then by providing a hard blow to a given
hadron, we should be able to “knock” one or more quarks out of it just as we can “knock”
an electron—a constituent of the atoms—out of an atom. But regardless of the strength
of the “blow,” no isolated quark was ever observed.
In all experiments, irrespective of
the amount of the energy provided to the colliding hadrons, the ﬁnal products were more
hadrons. It appeared as if hadrons were simply transforming into each other rather than
being composed of more fundamental particles.
An attractive idea that caught the attention of the physics community in the early
1960s was the bootstrap hypothesis, or “nuclear democracy.” Since no structurally more
fundamental particles show up in the violent collisions of hadrons, the bootstrap hypothesis
argued, hadrons themselves—being the by-products of the interaction of hadrons—must
be fundamental: hadrons are both fundamental and composite! And just as the legendary
Baron von M¨unchhausen could lift himself up by his bootstraps, so does a hadron lift
itself up into existence by its bootstrap. Although the bootstrap hypothesis, for lack of a
better theory, remained popular into the early 1970s, it eventually lost its appeal due to its
enormously complicated assumptions, its use of labyrinthine mathematics, and its inability
to predict any new physics. The correct theory of hadrons found its origin in a little-noticed
1954 paper by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills.

Gauge Theory: Mathematical Poetry III
In the classiﬁcation of particles in the last chapter, one particle, the photon, is conspicuously
absent. Photon is neither a hadron nor a lepton; it belongs to a third class of particles called
gauge bosons. These particles, just like photon (which mediates the electromagnetic force
among charged particles), mediate various other forces. To understand the origin of the
gauge bosons, we must learn something about symmetry.

34.1.1
Global and Local Symmetries
A square is a more symmetrical shape than a rectangle. Why? Is it because the sides of a
square are all equal? A rhombus has four equal sides, but it is not as symmetric as a square.
Neither is it because the angles of a square are all equal; a rectangle has four equal angles
as well. It is because both the sides and the angles are all equal. But why does that make
a square more symmetric than both a rectangle and a rhombus? There is an operational
deﬁnition of symmetry, which can tell us quickly whether a shape is symmetric or not, and
how symmetric it is.
For geometrical shapes, the operation (also called transformation) is their motion, in
particular their rotation. If we rotate a shape by a certain angle and it does not change,1 we
say that the shape is symmetric under that rotational angle. A rectangle, a rhombus, and
Symmetry of
geometrical shapes.
a square are all symmetric under a 180◦rotation about their centers, but only the square
(among the three shapes) is also symmetric under a 90◦and a 270◦rotation. The larger
the number of symmetry angles, the more symmetric the shape. Thus, according to this
deﬁnition, a regular hexagon is more symmetric that a square, which is more symmetric
than an equilateral triangle, which is more symmetric than a rectangle (or a rhombus).
And the most symmetric shape becomes a circle, because it is symmetric under any (and,
therefore, inﬁnitely many) rotational angles.
Abstracting the idea above, mathematicians and physicists deﬁne the symmetry of a
system as the invariance of that system under some abstract transformation. More precisely,
Box 34.1.1. A physical system is said to be symmetric under a transformation if it
remains unchanged when that transformation is performed on it, i.e., if the system after
operation coincides with the original system.
For example, a homogeneous and isotropic universe (see Section 29.4) is symmetric under
translation and rotation. All (distant) points of a homogeneous universe are similar; there-

fore, if you translate one point of the universe to another, the universe does not change.
Similarly, (on a large scale) all angles of an isotropic universe are similar; therefore, if you
pick any point P of the universe and rotate other points of the universe about P, the rotated
universe coincides with the original one.
What do you know?
34.1. Which of the following is the most symmetric under
rotation in a plane: a square, an ellipse, a parabola, or a rectangle? Which one is the
least symmetric?
Rotation and translation are only two kinds of (concrete) transformations. There are
other more abstract transformations that can be applied to symmetric physical quantities
without changing that quantity. For example, the Lorentz transformation of Section F.4,
when applied to space and time coordinates, leaves the spacetime distance unchanged. In
general, certain physical quantities expressed in terms of physical variables are invariant
under certain transformations of the variables.
Symmetry—the epitome of perfection in mathematics—has found its most natural set-
ting in Lie groups, of which you heard in the context of particle classiﬁcation (see Section
33.2.1). While particle classiﬁcation exempliﬁed a static application of Lie groups to fun-
damental physics, the Lie groups in the present context is applied to the dynamics of the
fundamental constituents of matter.

Example 34.1.2. (This example is slightly technical, but not mathematical.)
You
have heard the words “Lie groups” a number of times by now. Let’s delve a little deeper into this
subject, as the discussion will be helpful later in this chapter. A paradigm of Lie groups is rotation,
whose basic understanding will shed some light in the nature of Lie groups in general, and their
application in physics, in particular.
Figure 34.1(a) shows a rectangle lying in a plane (here, the plane of the paper). Given a point
in the plane such as the center of the rectangle, one can rotate the rectangle about that point.
When you rotate the top ﬁgure of the left column by some amount, say 20◦(the angle between
the solid vertical line and the dashed line in the top ﬁgure), you get the middle rectangle; and if
Rotations in a plane
commute.
you rotate the middle rectangle by some other amount, say 50◦(the angle between the solid line
and the dashed line in the middle ﬁgure), you get the bottom ﬁgure. Now rotate the top ﬁgure of
the right column (which is identical to the top ﬁgure of the left column) by 50◦(the angle between
the solid vertical line and the dashed line in the top ﬁgure), you get the middle rectangle; and if
you rotate the middle rectangle by 20◦(the angle between the solid line and the dashed line in the
middle ﬁgure), you get the bottom ﬁgure. The bottom ﬁgures of the right and the left columns are
identical, indicating that the order of the two rotations is immaterial: the two rotations commute.
Figure 34.1(b) shows a brick standing on one of its edges in space. Given a point in space
Rotations in space do
not commute.
(here the center of the brick), one can rotate the brick about that point. Contrary to the plane,
where there is only one axis—the axis perpendicular to the plane—about which you can rotate, you
have three axes passing through the point about which you can rotate.2 Since picturing arbitrary
rotations in three dimensions is hard, let’s restrict rotations to 90◦, which for our purposes is
suﬃcient. Rotate the top ﬁgure of the left column by 90◦about the x-axis to get the middle brick;
rotate the latter by 90◦about the y-axis and get the bottom ﬁgure. Now reverse the order: rotate
the top ﬁgure of the right column (which is identical to the top ﬁgure of the left column) by 90◦

we need not go into, only three of them are “independent.”

about the y-axis to get the middle brick; then rotate the latter by 90◦about the x-axis and get the
bottom ﬁgure on the right. The bottom ﬁgures of the right and the left columns are not identical,
indicating that the order of the two rotations does matter: the two rotations do not commute.
This commutativity (or lack thereof) resembles the property of matrices mentioned in Section
22.2.2. In fact, the above rotations can be represented by matrices. Once this is done, one ﬁnds
that the matrices representing the two-dimensional rotation commute with one another, while
those representing the three-dimensional rotation do not. The discussion of rotations and matrices
is indeed more general: most of the abstract Lie groups encountered in physics can be regarded as
“rotations” in some abstract multi-dimensional space, and therefore, represented by matrices. The
rotation in the plane, having only 1 axis, has an abstract analog in Lie group theory denoted by
U(1). The letter U stands for unitary,3 and 1 indicates that the matrix is one by one, namely just
a (complex) number. The rotation in space, having 3 axes, has an abstract analog in Lie group
theory denoted by SU(2). Again U stands for unitary and S for special.4 The “2” in SU(2) is
related to the three axes of rotation via 22 −1 = 3. In general, abstract multi-dimensional rotations
are denoted by SU(n), and possess n2 −1 axes of rotations.
A Lie group all of whose matrices commute is called abelian, and if its matrices do not

commute, the group is nonabelian. Thus, rotations in a plane form an abelian Lie group, while
the Lie group of rotations in space is nonabelian. Similarly U(1) is abelian, but SU(n) is nonabelian
if n ≥2. As we shall see shortly, the commutativity property of Lie groups plays a signiﬁcant role
in the nature of the fundamental forces.
■
Abstract quantities require higher mathematical skills; and since the reader may not
have such skills, visual aids can be useful in representing abstract quantities. For example,
let a (inﬁnite) sheet of paper represent a ﬁeld as described in Box 32.2.1. Also assume
that the points of the paper represent points of space (more precisely, spacetime, but we
need not worry about such subtleties).5 Since space and time do not have any color, it
would be more realistic to replace the (usually white) paper sheet with a transparency
sheet. A visual representation of the invariant physical quantity, which depends on the
ﬁelds, although helpful, is not necessary because such a visualization is not crucial for the
present discussion. All you need to know is that such quantities exist, and that they do not
change under certain transformations of ﬁelds. Figure 34.2(a) shows a transparent sheet
representing a ﬁeld.
Now let’s see if we can come up with a visual representation of the transformation of a
ﬁeld. What is the most natural thing one can do to a transparency sheet? Write or draw
on it. And to do so, one has to pick a marker of a particular color. Pick a gray marker,
and don’t worry about the fact that gray markers are not easily found! For our discussion,
the usual writing or drawing is too complicated (nevertheless, we’ll come back to it later),
because the eﬀect of the marker is diﬀerent at diﬀerent points of the sheet. We want the
marker to have a uniform eﬀect at all points of the sheet. So instead of writing or drawing,
color the sheet gray uniformly. This will give you the sheet of Figure 34.2(b). The uniform
coloring of the sheet is called a global transformation, because the transformation is the

same at all points of the sheet. Translating back into the language of mathematics and
physics, a global transformation of a ﬁeld is that which changes the ﬁeld in the same way
at all points of space (and time).
What is the signiﬁcance of the global transformation? There is a clear mathematical pro-
cedure for writing down a physical theory that is symmetric under a global transformation.
Such a theory gives the same results whether you write it in terms of the ﬁeld represented
by Figure 34.2(a) or Figure 34.2(b); the theory is “color blind,” or more precisely, “gray
blind.”
3A unitary matrix has the property that if you complex conjugate each element of one of its rows and
multiply it by the corresponding element of another row and add all these products, you get zero. If you
add the square of the elements of a single row, you get 1. The same two properties hold for the columns.
4For readers familiar with determinants, “special” refers to the fact that the determinant of the matrix
is one.
5In reality, a ﬁeld varies from point to point and from time to time, but the sheet of paper looks the
same at all of its points; another subtlety that we should ignore.

transformation does not paint gray all points of the sheet. So when you write or draw
on a transparency, you are locally transforming the sheet. Figure 34.3 shows some local
transformations of the transparency sheet.

Gauge Fields
In their 1954 paper, Yang and Mills considered a ﬁeld theory that was symmetric under
a particular group of (global) transformations.6
The theory was, of course, not locally
symmetric. In our analogy of transparency sheets, the theory was the same whether you
used the sheet in Figure 34.2(a) or the one in Figure 34.2(b). But if you used any of the
sheets in Figure 34.3, the symmetry of the theory would be lost.
BIOGRAPHY
Born on September 22, 1922, in Hofei, Anwhei, China, Chen Ning Yang was brought up in the peaceful
and academically inclined atmosphere of the campus of Tsinghua University, just outside of Peiping,
China, where his father was a Professor of Mathematics. After receiving his M.Sc. degree in 1944, Yang
went to the USA, entering the University of Chicago in January 1946, where he came under the strong
inﬂuence of Professor E. Fermi, and where he obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1948. Yang has contributed
greatly to fundamental physics, but is mostly known for his prediction (with T. D. Lee) of the parity
violation in weak interactions, and his discovery (with Robert Mills) of gauge theories. He shared the
1957 Nobel Prize in physics with T. D. Lee.
Addition of
compensating ﬁelds
makes a theory locally
symmetric.
The next question was whether it was possible to somehow improve the theory to make
it locally symmetric. And Yang and Mills found the revolutionary answer. They realized
that if they added certain “compensating” ﬁelds, or gauge ﬁelds, which were determined
by the assumed initial symmetry, then the theory would become locally symmetric. Again
in the language of transparencies, this scheme corresponds to the introduction of the sheets
of Figure 34.4 to “make up” for the sheets of Figure 34.3. If you “gauge” the deﬁciencies of
any one of the sheets of Figure 34.3, you can build a corresponding sheet that covers those

deﬁciencies in such a way as to render the entire theory—consisting of the original ﬁelds
(sheets) plus the new gauge ﬁelds (sheets)—symmetric.
What are these gauge ﬁelds good for, anyway? To answer this question, theoretical
physicists simpliﬁed the Yang-Mills symmetry,7 and discovered that the localization of a

identiﬁed as photon!
Since the photon ﬁeld was known to mediate the electromagnetic
interaction, it was hoped that the gauge ﬁelds of the Yang-Mills theory could be made to
mediate the weak and strong interactions. However, there were serious theoretical problems
that had to be overcome before gauge particles could be identiﬁed as the exchange particles
of the other forces.
Example 34.1.3. The question of how many gauge ﬁelds are associated with a given Lie
group is an important theoretical question. We just saw that U(1) had only one gauge ﬁeld. It

was also pointed out in Example 34.1.2 that U(1) was the analogue of the rotation in a plane,
which has only one axis. Furthermore, the next Lie group, SU(2), was associated with rotations
in space, which had three independent axes, where the “3” was related to the “2” of SU(2) via
3 = 22 −1. In any locally symmetric theory, the number of independent “axes of rotation” in the
abstract multi-dimensional space in which the Lie group operates is also the number of gauge ﬁelds
of the theory. Thus, a theory based on the Lie group SU(2) has three gauge ﬁelds, and one based
on SU(n) has n2 −1.

ematical formulation of the theory, any “mass term” violates the local symmetry. On the
other hand, weak and strong nuclear forces are short ranged; therefore, their exchange par-
ticles had better be either massive (see Section 31.3.2 and the following example), or possess
some other property that conﬁned their interaction to short ranges. The latter part of the
1960s and the early part of the 1970s saw the solution to the dilemma in the contexts of
spontaneous symmetry breaking and conﬁnement.
Example 34.1.4. We can understand the connection between the mass of the gauge ﬁeld
and the range of the force by appealing to the uncertainty principle and the Feynman diagrams. In
the context of these diagrams, a particle is exchanged when it goes from one vertex to another. Let
∆t denote the ﬂight time of the particle from one vertex to the other. This ﬂight time is related
to the energy of the particle by the time-energy uncertainty relation: ∆E∆t ≥ℏ, where ≥is often
replaced by ≈, indicating that the left side of the inequality is not too much greater than the right
side, and the uncertainty is written as an approximate equality: ∆E∆t ≈ℏ.
Although ∆E is the uncertainty in the energy of the gauge particle, its order of magnitude
should not be too much diﬀerent from the energy of the particle. If the particle is not moving too
fast, its energy is mostly its rest energy, i.e., its mass (times c2). We now note that if the range

of the force is small, the ﬂight time ∆t is also small, making ∆E, or the mass of the particle,
large. Conversely, if the mass of the exchanged particle is large, ∆t will be small, making the force
short-ranged.
There is another aspect of the force that needs to be emphasized: its probability of occurrence.
The more massive the
gauge particles, the less
frequent the interaction
process.
If the gauge particle is massive, the force is short-ranged, and the two vertices are close together.
This means that the particles that exert this kind of force on one another must get very close to
each other. And since the occurrence of a close encounter is generally rare, the interaction will
be infrequent. Thus there is an inverse relation between the mass of the gauge particle and the
frequency of the phenomena resulting from the exchange of that gauge particle.

BIOGRAPHY
Robert Mills was born in Englewood, New Jersey, and graduated from George School. He studied at
Columbia College, 1944–1948, while on leave from the Coast Guard. Mills demonstrated his mathemat-
ical ability by winning the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition in 1948, and by receiving
ﬁrst-class honors in the Tripos. He earned a master’s degree from Cambridge, and a Ph.D. in Physics
from Columbia in 1955. After a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Mills became a
professor of Physics at Ohio State University in 1956 and remained there until his retirement in 1995.
Mills is best known for his work with C. N. Yang on the nonabelian gauge theory.
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB)
An important concept in any ﬁeld theory is the vacuum. Lacking any (real) particles, it is
the state of the lowest possible energy, and as such, also the most stable of all other “states”
of the ﬁeld theory. For our purposes, you can think of the vacuum state as the equilibrium
state of the physical system. As a concrete example, consider a perfectly spherical balloon
or ball (whose surface is perfectly smooth), which we keep inﬂating. As we add more and
more air in the balloon, the pressure inside increases, but the sphericity of the balloon
does not change: every point on and inside the balloon is similar to other points, i.e., the
equilibrium state (the vacuum) of the balloon and its content are rotationally invariant.
The inﬂation cannot, of course, go on forever; the balloon eventually pops. Just before
it pops, any part of the balloon is as likely to crack as any other part. However, the process
of popping picks out a particular part of the balloon through which the air gushes out.
Once this happens (and it happens “spontaneously”), the symmetry of the balloon and the
process is broken, and the equilibrium state is no longer rotationally invariant. There is
an analogous mathematical process, by which the choice of a vacuum (out of an inﬁnite
equivalent possibilities) spontaneously breaks the symmetry of a ﬁeld theory.
Jeﬀrey Goldstone, a British theoretical physicist, showed in the early 1960s that when
the global symmetry of a theory is spontaneously broken (due to the unavoidable choice
of a vacuum), some massless particles are created. These massless particles are called the
Goldstone bosons. This is the inverse of the process needed for short ranged interactions,

and therefore, by itself will not help us. However, soon after Goldstone’s discovery, Peter
Higgs, another British physicist, applied the idea of SSB to local symmetries, and found a
remarkable property, now called the Higgs mechanism. Based on this mechanism, when a

of the originally massless gauge ﬁelds become massive. Some of the gauge ﬁelds “eat up”
the Goldstone bosons and gain weight! Thus

Conﬁnement
Spontaneous breaking of local symmetry “fattens” the gauge ﬁelds and makes them good
candidates for short ranged interactions.
There is, nevertheless, another mechanism by
which interactions can be conﬁned to short ranges. This mechanism occurs for all but the

simplest Lie group (whose gauge ﬁeld is photon).8 More precisely, when the symmetry is
more elaborate than the simplest kind, the massless gauge ﬁelds interact among themselves9
in such a way as to make the corresponding force increase with distance. Because of the
similarity of this behavior and the (rubber) glue, these gauge ﬁelds are called gluons. The
particles exchanging gluons behave as free particles (in the sense that they don’t feel any
force) when they are very close, but experience strong forces when they are pulled apart.
What is Nature’s Symmetry?
Yang-Mills’ idea of local symmetry and gauge ﬁelds is appealing; and Higgs’ mechanism of
giving mass to the gauge ﬁelds adds to the appeal. In his Ode on a Grecian Urn, John
Keats said “Beauty is truth, truth beauty.” The intrinsic mathematical charm of Lie groups
lends strong support to its potential validity. The truth of fundamental interactions may,
therefore, reside in the Lie groups, but not every Lie group contains the truth.
Thus,
physicists ventured into the enchanting land of Lie groups in search of the group that held
the truth. The search was mainly aimed at unraveling the weak nuclear force. Among the
frenzy that ensued Goldstone and Higgs’ embellishment of the work of Yang and Mills, the
work of three prominent physicists of the time stood the test of time: Steven Weinberg,
Abdus Salam, and Sheldon Glashow. Their work not only gave a full explanation of the weak
nuclear force, but, as a prerequisite of doing so, it uniﬁed that force with the electromagnetic
force into what is now called the electroweak force.
34.2
Electroweak Interaction
Central to the application of Lie group theory to the interaction of particles is how the
particles are grouped together. We saw this grouping in the classiﬁcation scheme of the
eightfold way (see Section 33.2.1). We also saw how the correct grouping was crucial in
the placement of the two Ξ∗particles and the prediction of Ω−. The grouping narrows
down the choice of the Lie groups, and the right grouping may pick the Lie group that
Nature herself has decided upon. Glashow’s paper appeared in 1961, Salam’s in 1967, and
Weinberg’s in 1968. Between these three papers, a certain choice of Lie group was made
which was only one of many other choices proposed by other physicists in the 60s. However,

by the latter half of the 70s, experimental numbers were getting closer and closer to the
Weinberg-Salam-Glashow (WSG) model.
To understand how general Lie group theory is applied to particle physics, let’s examine a
special example, the simplest Lie group.10 In this simplest model, every electrically charged
particle constitutes one group, a singlet.11 To ﬁnd out what kind of interaction this simple
model entails, we need to examine the Feynman diagrams (see Section 32.2.1) of the theory;
and since the vertices of the Feynman diagrams are the building blocks of the entire theory,
we need to look at the possible vertices allowed by this simple theory. But ﬁrst we need
to know the general rule for constructing vertices. This rule, in conjunction with the other
Feynman rules given in Box 32.2.2, can yield many interesting physical processes.
Box 34.2.1. (Feynman Rule for a General Vertex) A vertex consists of an initial
particle drawn as a solid line directed upward, a ﬁnal particle also drawn as a solid line
directed upward, and a gauge particle, with all three attached at a single point. The
initial and the ﬁnal particles (not necessarily diﬀerent) must belong to the same group
of the model under consideration.
In the simple model we are considering, for each singlet there is only one vertex, with the
initial and the ﬁnal particles of the vertex being the same and the gauge particle being
necessarily neutral, because electric charge conservation demands that the total charge
entering a vertex equal the charge leaving it.
If the singlet consists of an electron, we
recover the vertex of Figure 32.1, i.e., the theory of quantum electrodynamics.
BIOGRAPHY
Steven Weinberg was born in 1933 in New York City. Encouraged by his father, he developed an early
interest in science, and by the time he was 15 or 16 his interests had focused on theoretical physics.
Weinberg received his BS degree from Cornell in 1954, and after a year of graduate study and research
at Niels Bohr Institute, he returned home to attend Princeton University, where he received his Ph.D.
in 1957. Weinberg’s research from 1959 to 1966—while at Berkeley—was mainly in theoretical high
energy physics. His active interest in astrophysics dates from 1961–62; he wrote some papers on the
cosmic population of neutrinos and then began to write a book, Gravitation and Cosmology. Published
in 1972, the book has become one of the standard references on the subject. While he was a visitor
at M.I.T. in 1967, his research turned in the direction of the uniﬁcation of weak and electromagnetic
interactions. In 1973 Weinberg was oﬀered and he accepted the chair of Higgins Professor of Physics at
Harvard. His work during the 1970s was mainly concerned with the implications of the uniﬁed theory of
weak and electromagnetic interactions and the uniﬁcation of all interactions. In 1982 he moved to the
physics and astronomy departments of the University of Texas at Austin, as Josey Regental Professor
of Science. Weinberg received the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979 for his work in the uniﬁcation of the
electromagnetic and the weak interactions.
34.2.1
The Lepton Sector
The next in complication, beyond the simplest Lie group discussed above, is a Lie group
associated with doublets. Charged leptons with their companion neutrinos (see Section 33.3)
are natural candidates for such doublets. These doublets are represented as

10If you have read Example 34.1.2, you’ll recognize this simple group as U(1).
11The double use of the word “group” in the present context is unfortunate but not conveniently avoidable.
I hope the context clariﬁes the distinction between “group” as an aggregate or collection of particles and
“group” as a mathematical entity (as in Lie groups).

where the last doublet is a convenient generic representation of the other two with l being
e or µ. In the 1960s when the Weinberg-Salam-Glashow (WSG) model was proposed, there
were only two doublets of leptons: the electron doublet and the muon doublet. The number
of doublets has no eﬀect on the validity of the model. In the general discussions of the
model, we use the generic doublet to emphasize the generality of the conclusions. As is
common in the literature, the member with lower electric charge is placed in the bottom
row of the doublet.
What kind of Feynman vertices do we get from this theory? With l representing either
of the leptons, Figure 34.5 shows the four possible electroweak vertices. In Figure 34.5(a),
the gauge ﬁelds, represented by a zigzagged line, are electrically neutral—because the initial
and ﬁnal leptons have the same charge—and it does not matter whether they are drawn in
the lower part (initial state) of the diagram or in the upper part. As discussed in Section
32.2.1, the exchanged particles are drawn horizontally anyway. Figure 34.5(b), on the other
hand, shows gauge particles that carry electric charge, because the initial lepton has a
diﬀerent charge than the ﬁnal. The gauge particle on the left of Figure 34.5(b) carries a
negative charge, while the gauge particle on the right is positively charged (to neutralize
the negative charge of the ﬁnal lepton).
BIOGRAPHY
Abdus Salam (1926–1996) was born in Jhang, a small town in what is now Pakistan. When he cycled
home from Lahore, at the age of 14, after gaining the highest marks ever recorded for the Matriculation
Examination at the University of the Punjab, the whole town turned out to welcome him. In 1946 Salam
was awarded a scholarship to St. John’s College, Cambridge, where in 1950 he received the Smith’s
Prize from Cambridge University for the most outstanding pre-doctoral contribution to physics. He also
obtained his PhD in theoretical physics at Cambridge. Salam returned to Pakistan in 1951 with the
intention of founding a school of research, but it soon became clear that this was impossible, and in 1954
he left his own country for a lectureship at Cambridge. Many years later, at the International Center for
Theoretical Physics, Trieste, which he created, he instituted the famous “Associateships” which allowed
deserving young physicists from the developing countries to spend their vacations there in an invigorating
research atmosphere. Salam used his academic reputation to inﬂuence international scientiﬁc aﬀairs.
He shared the Nobel Prize in physics in 1979 for his work in the uniﬁcation of electromagnetism and
the weak interactions.
Therefore, the electroweak interaction has four gauge particles, two neutral, one positive,
and one negative. Spontaneous symmetry breaking gives mass to three of these: the two
charged ones, which are now denoted by W + and W −, and one of the neutral ones, which is
given the symbol Z0. The other neutral gauge particle remains massless and is identiﬁable
as the photon γ, responsible for the electromagnetic interaction.

Example 34.2.2. The discussion leading to the four gauge particles of Figure 34.5 is not
entirely correct. If you have followed Examples 34.1.2 and 34.1.3, you have noticed that the Lie
group that is only one step more elaborate than the U(1) of QED is SU(2). But SU(2) has only
22 −1 gauge ﬁelds. So where does the fourth gauge ﬁeld come from? It turns out that the doublets
of Equation (34.1) are not entirely correct. Here is why.
At the time of the proposal of the electroweak theory, neutrino’s were assumed massless.12
Therefore, based on the discussion of Section 33.1, they should be right-handed as well as left-
handed. However, as early as 1955, it was known that weak interactions violate the mirror sym-
metry. This violation manifests itself in the elimination of the right-handed neutrinos. Somehow
Nature has chosen the left-handed neutrinos, but not their mirror image. So how do you group the
particles in the model?
Weinberg suggested splitting the massive lepton (i.e., the electron or muon) into its left-handed
and right-handed components,13 grouping the left-handed part with the lepton’s neutrino into a
doublet, and leaving the right-handed component as a singlet. The Lie group appropriate for this
arrangement of particles is a combination of SU(2) and U(1) denoted by SU(2)⊗U(1). The SU(2)
part deals with the left-handed doublet and gives three gauge bosons; the U(1) part deals with the
right-handed singlet and gives one gauge boson. Altogether, the theory yields four gauge bosons.

Food for Thought
FFT 34.2.3. On January 21, 1983, in a packed auditorium at CERN (now called European Center
for Particle Physics), the group working on the detection of the W bosons announced their success.
They had found a signal exactly at the predicted mass value. A few months later, the Z boson with
the expected mass was also discovered at CERN. Today thousands of sightings of these particles
have been reported, and their masses measured more and more accurately. In the latest Particle
Physics Booklet, the mass of W is given as 1.429 × 10−25 kg and that of Z as 1.604 × 10−25 kg.

excitement over the discovery of the bending of light in the Sun’s gravity or the discovery of a new

predicted such exotic phenomena.

Alas, today’s dominant pragmatic global ideology promotes larger SUVs, higher-resolution TV

and special eﬀects, and a thousand other futilely pleasurable inventions. And in such an envi-

discussed the electric part of the electroweak interaction in Chapter 32, we ignore processes
involving the exchange of photons. The simplest purely weak process is the exchange of a W
boson between a muon and an electron neutrino, in which the muon turns into its neutrino
and the electron neutrino turns into the electron [see Figure 34.6(a)]. The exchanged particle
could be interpreted as a W −moving to the right or a W + moving to the left; the two
interpretations are completely identical. This diagram represents a µ−-νe scattering into an
electron and a muon neutrino. While this process is important in its own right, it becomes
more interesting when we use the rules of Box 32.2.4, and turn the electron “leg” of the
Feynman diagram as shown in Figure 34.6(b), in which the sign of the W boson has been
suppressed, allowing either one of the two interpretations given above.

Some simple vertices, which were forbidden in QED can take place in the electroweak
theory. For example, the second diagram in Figure 32.5(b) is impossible, because the initial
photon is massless while the ﬁnal particles are massive. However, the analogue of that
diagram, such as the four shown in Figure 34.7 are possible physical processes. In fact,
these diagrams describe how the massive gauge bosons of the electroweak interaction decay,
and all of these decay processes have been observed and measured experimentally, in perfect
agreement with the theoretical predictions.
BIOGRAPHY
Sheldon Glashow was born in 1932 to a family who immigrated to the US to ﬁnd freedom and
opportunity denied to Jews in Czarist Russia. From an early age, partly due to the encouragement
of his elder brother, Glashow knew that he wanted to be a scientist. At the Bronx High School of
Science, he became friends with a group of bright students that included Steven Weinberg. The group
spurred one another to learn physics while commuting on the New York subway. Sheldon and Steven
attended Cornell University, where they once again became part of a talented class, including many
future prominent scientists. After getting his BS from Cornell, Glashow went to graduate school at
Harvard University in 1954, and wrote his PhD thesis under the supervision of Julian Schwinger, a
codiscoverer of QED and a Nobel laureate. After several years at Niels Bohr Institute, CERN, Stanford,
and Berkeley, Glashow returned to Harvard University in 1966 where he has remained since. He shared

nuclear force.
What do you know? 34.5. What can be exchanged between e−and νµ if they, and
only they, both appear in the initial state of a Feynman diagram?
Food for Thought
FFT 34.2.4. Weak interactions had been studied both theoretically and experimentally prior
to the WSG model. This model (plus other models proposed at the same time) suggested new
experiments which were performed in the 1970s. One such experiment, whose sheer possibility tells
of the enormous progress in the physics of the twentieth century, is the reaction νµ +e−→νµ +e−.
Why?
Recall from Section 31.3.1 how the neutrinos of the 1930s β-decay baﬄed physicists to the
point of abandoning the energy conservation. Through a persistent study of these elusive particles,
we came to know them, and to realize that they can penetrate thicknesses of lead not meters,
kilometers, or thousands of kilometers long but light years long! As elusive as they were, we found
many of their properties whenever we could catch a ﬂeeting glimpse of them. But there is no limit
to mankind’s scientiﬁc ability. By the 1970s we had the neutrinos under such a tight control that
we could send them in a collision course with electrons!
From the point of view of Feynman diagrams, the reaction mentioned above is interesting
because the only way that it can go is through the diagram
νμ

−, in which the exchanged
gauge boson can only be a Z0: it can’t be a photon because photons can couple only to charged
particles, and νµ is neutral; it can’t be a W + or W −, because the initial and ﬁnal particles at
each vertex have the same charge. This reaction was one of the ﬁrst strong indirect proofs of the
existence of the neutral weak gauge boson.
The more recent data from the νµ-e−scattering, as well as the data from the earlier days of
the weak interactions could be used to predict the masses of W ± and Z0.14 By the latter half of
the 70s the masses of these particles could be predicted. Based on the available data, the model
set these masses at MW = 1.4 × 10−25 kg and MZ = 1.6 × 10−25 kg.
14These data were not terribly accurate, as the techniques used to obtain them were at their earliest
stages. The data improved considerably over time.

The Quark Sector
Weak interactions are not conﬁned to the leptons. In fact, the earliest weak interactions
were observed in nuclei—thus the name “weak nuclear force”—in the process of the β-
decay, a paradigm of which is the disintegration of neutron into a proton, an electron,
and an antineutrino (see Section 31.3.1). The quark structure of the neutron and proton
suggests that in this disintegration, one of the down quarks in neutron changes to an up
quark at a W vertex much like the µ-νµ vertex of Figure 34.6(b).
If d is to change into u at a vertex, the two must belong to the same doublet, just like
µ and νµ of Equation (34.1). In the early 1960s there were only two lepton doublets: the

electron doublet and the muon doublet. The idea of arranging the quarks into doublets
seemed very attractive. However, there were only three quarks, and putting u and d in a
doublet would leave the s quark without a partner. Could it be that there was a fourth
quark yet to be discovered? That s indeed had a partner, but the hadron in which it was
hiding had not yet been detected? This idea was very “charm”ing mathematically. Glashow
and his collaborators could not resist this idea, not only from an aesthetic point of view,
but also from theoretical calculations which explained some of the diﬃculties associated
with a three-quark model of hadronic weak interactions. Charm was the name, and c the
symbol, they gave to this hypothetical fourth quark. Since s had a negative charge, c must
possess an electric charge of + 2
3, just like u.
November of 1974 was an exciting month for the high energy physics community. In that
month, the discovery of a new particle was reported by two groups: one on the east coast
at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) led by Samuel Ting who called the new particle
J; the other on the west coast at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) led by Burton
Richter who called it ψ. What was surprising about this new particle (now called J/ψ) was
the “very narrow peak in the cross section,” as opposed to the boring broad peaks signaling
very short-lived particles that occur frequently. The narrow peak meant that J/ψ lived
much longer than usual, and that the physicists could identify its mass very accurately.
Actually J/ψ had been peeping through the detectors at the two coasts months before it
fully exposed itself to the particle physicists. In January of 1974, the SLAC group noticed
a slight “bump” in the cross section of electron-positron scattering at around 3 GeV (giga
electron volt, where giga means 109), while plotting the cross section as a function of energy
in steps of 200 MeV. Imagine a giant walking on Earth with steps that are 20 miles apart.
This giant may put one step on the foot of a mountain peak on one side and the next
step on the other side. If you asked him whether he saw a mountain or not, he might say
that there was just a slight bump, but nothing substantial. The peak of the mountain was
missed between the two giant steps.
It turned out that the 200-MeV steps were like the giant’s step: they missed the peak.
By reducing the step size from 200 to 10 MeV, the SLAC group unmistakably pinpointed
the very sharp peak at 3.1 GeV in June 1974. However, due to some inconsistencies, they

but did not announce it. By early November, the inconsistencies of the SLAC group were
resolved, and the discovery announced on November 11, 1974. On exactly the same day
the BNL group also announced their ﬁndings. Four days later an Italian team at Frascati
conﬁrmed the observation of the J/ψ particle. This particle was identiﬁed as a bound state
of a charm and an anticharm, and was given a third name: charmonium.
What do you know? 34.6. Draw a Feynman diagram representing the production
of charmonium.
Once charmonium was discovered and the existence of the charmed quark established,
physicists ventured to construct hadrons consisting of a charm and some other quarks, a
hadron with a “naked charm.”
By 1976 the SLAC group was able to produce mesons
consisting of a charm and one of the older antiquarks: ¯u, ¯d, or ¯s. The 1976 Nobel Prize
went to Burton Richter and Samuel Ting for their discovery of the charmed quark.
No sooner had the charmed quark peeped through one detector at SLAC than a new
lepton started to crawl out of another. As early as 1974, a group at SLAC led by Martin
Perl was seeing certain “eµ” events from the collision of electrons with positrons at very
high energies. These events were unique in that aside from an electron and a positive muon
(or a positron and a negative muon), no other charged particle or photons were produced
as end products. In a typical e+-e−collision a lot of charged particles and photons are
also produced; but not in these eµ events. Perl suggested that these events come from
the production of heavy leptons (leptons that are much heavier than e and µ) and the
subsequent decay of these leptons into electrons and muons. For example, in the reaction
Tauon is discovered at
SLAC.
e+ + e−→ℓ+ + ℓ−, in which ℓrepresents a heavy lepton, ℓ+ could decay into a µ+ and
neutrinos and ℓ−into an electron and neutrinos. It took Martin Perl and his collaborators
four more years to convince the physics community that what they had discovered in 1974
was the τ lepton or tauon,15 and by the end of 1978 all the properties of tauon was nailed
down. One half of the 1995 Nobel Prize went to Martin Perl for his discovery of tauon.16
The fact that the third lepton was discovered 40 years after the second, and the second
40 years after the ﬁrst may be eﬀective ammunition for a numerologist, but to a physicist
it is only a coincidence. The discovery of tauon τ in 1977—40 years after the discovery of
muon in 1937 and 80 years after the discovery of electron in 1897—was a big surprise for
all physicists.17 Despite its huge mass (a τ −is 3500 times heavier than an e−), it is still a
point particle.
Tauon has its own neutrino ντ, and the two carry a tauon ﬂavor. Because of its huge
mass, tauon can easily decay into a muon or an electron, each reaction carrying a neutrino
and an antineutrino to preserve ﬂavor:
τ −→µ−+ ¯νµ + ντ
τ −→e−+ ¯νe + ντ.
(34.2)
In each case, there is a ντ to carry the initial tauon ﬂavor, and an antineutrino to cancel
the muon or electron ﬂavor.

decays of Equation (34.2). Hint: Look at the Feynman diagram of the muon decay in

15They chose τ from the Greek τρiτoν for “third”—the third charged lepton.
16The other half went to Frederick Reines for another signiﬁcant work: his detection of neutrinos.
17To put all numerological anticipations to rest, we should remark that there are strong theoretical
arguments against a “fourth generation” lepton in 2017 or anytime in the future!

Chapter 34
The Standard Model
With the word of the discovery of a heavy lepton getting around in the experimental
particle physics circles, the prospect of yet another quark loomed over many accelerator
labs. If charm raised the “quark sector” to the level of the then-existing two lepton pairs,
the discovery of tauon (and its neutrino) demanded a new quark doublet. As early as 1974,
there were mixed signals coming from detectors at Fermilab that hinted at a new hadron.
A ﬁfth quark, called
bottom is discovered at
Fermilab.
However, these “mixed” signals were not untangled until 1977, when the discovery of Υ—
pronounced upsilon—at Fermilab was announced. Υ, with the enormous mass of 9.4 GeV,
was shown to be a bound state of a −1
3-quark and its antiquark. Because of its negative
electric charge, this quark was thought to be the lower member of a doublet just as the
strange and down quarks are the lower members of their doublets. For this reason, the
quark was named bottom and given the symbol b.
Obviously, if you have a bottom quark, you need a top quark as well. The discovery
of the bottom quark at Fermilab started the “race to the top” in all laboratories capable
of accelerating particles (and their antiparticles) to a suﬃciently high speed.
After the
unsuccessful searches at “lower” energies, many laboratories dropped out of the race. Only
Fermilab and CERN remained the contenders.
With the bottom quark mass at about

5 GeV (almost half the mass of the Υ consisting of the equally massive b and ¯b), physicists
anticipated a mass of 10, 15, or 20 GeV for the top quark.
However, cranking up the
Υ-production energy by a factor of 4 or 5 yielded no results.
Factors of 10 and 15 to
production energies of 50 or 75 GeV also showed no sign of the top quark. After 18 years
of experimenting, Fermilab reported the detection of a top-antitop bound state at about
350 GeV in 1995, giving an approximate mass of 175 GeV to the top quark, a 35-fold
increase over the mass of the bottom quark!
How do the six quarks pair up together? While in the case of leptons it was clear which
neutrino belonged to which charged lepton [see Equation (34.1)], the assignment of quark
partners is not as clear-cut. How do we know that the (negative) s-quark belongs to the
(positive) c-quark and not to u or t? In fact, we don’t! And when we pair up the quarks,
we allow this possibility and write the pairs as


u
d, s, b

,


c
s, d, b


⇒

(34.3)
where it is understood that the pairings of the three negative quarks are not equal. For
example, u pairs mostly with d, occasionally with s, and rarely with b.
In the above
equation, the dominant negative member of the doublet has been written ﬁrst.
It turns out that this “polygammy” of the quarks is related to the fact that quarks are
Neutrino oscillation (or

massive. The “monogamous” partnership of neutrinos with their corresponding negative
leptons was based on the assumption that neutrinos were massless; and until recently, this
assumption seemed to be consistent with all experimental observations. However, since the
late 80s there have been a growing number of observations that indicate a neutrino “mixing.”
The earliest and strongest evidence came from the Sun, within which neutrino-producing
nuclear processes take place. These processes indicate a certain νe to νµ abundance ratio,
which is not observed on Earth. The explanation is that on the way to Earth, neutrino’s
transform into one another; and this can happen only if there is a mixing of νe, νµ, and ντ
similar to the d, s, b mixing in Equation (34.3).
Is there a fourth generation of leptons and quarks? Despite an exponential increase
in the energy of the accelerators, no new leptons have been discovered since 1977; and
although only four years after the announcement of the discovery of charm—the hidden
partner of the strange quark—the bottom member of a new generation of quarks showed
up at Fermilab, no new generation of quarks has been observed ever since. In fact, there
are strong theoretical arguments in favor of only three generations of quarks and leptons.

Food for Thought
FFT 34.2.5. The dream of the alchemists of the Middle Ages was to convert base metals into
gold. The grandchildren of alchemists had the less ambitious goal of combining or changing ordinary
material to get more ordinary material, but in the process understand the laws of such combination.
The melting of ice into water revealed a property shared by all solids; and the rust gathered on
some metals pointed to a reaction of an element in the air—later identiﬁed as oxygen—with the
metal. The discovery of the elements provided chemists with the powerful technique of fusing them
to form molecules, old and simple as well as new and complex.
But the dream of the alchemists was still just that, a dream. Molecules, although completely
diﬀerent from the atoms that built them, were not elements. Was it possible to change one ele-
ment into another? This required the identiﬁcation of elements as an aggregate of atoms and the
involvement of physicists. Once the atomic structure was discovered and the nature of the dif-
ference between atoms unraveled, the possibility of transforming one element into another opened
up. Nuclear physics became the modern alchemy; but alas, the force of economics inhibited the
production of gold out of base metals for practical and commercial use.
If chemistry is likened to the construction of buildings out of bricks, then a chemist is a builder
who has no control over the kind of bricks he uses. The atoms of the elements used to form the
molecules of compounds are the bricks, and a chemist has to work with these atoms given to him.
The nuclear physicist is the brick maker. She takes the naturally available clay and molds it into
diﬀerent shapes and colors of bricks. The clay is the naturally occurring protons and neutrons
required to form diﬀerent kinds of atoms. No other form of clay exists in the universe—at least
not in the present universe.
As long as protons and neutrons are the building blocks, the nuclear physicists can only trans-
form one atom into another, perhaps even a new kind of atom, but nevertheless an atom with a
nucleus and a number of electrons somehow conﬁgured around it. To make a diﬀerent kind of
clay, a new breed of builders had to be born. These were the particle physicists of the 1950s, who
created new kinds of building blocks, new kinds of clay. The naturally available “clay” consists of
the up and down quarks hidden inside protons and neutrons. By creating strange, charm, top, and
bottom quarks, particle physicists opened the gate to the world of hadrons, objects that had not
existed in the universe possibly since a tiny fraction of a second after its creation.
All this is good and exotically interesting, you may say, but what is the use of it? Clearly, we
are not going to see a toothpaste made of upsilons and charmoniums in the near future! Nor will
there be an opportunity for the application of hadrons made of bottom or strange quarks in our
cars’ engine. So why do physicists even bother with these weird particles? I have two answers to
these questions.
The ﬁrst answer is in the form of a question: Why do artists bother with impasto?
Why

526
Chapter 34
The Standard Model
do composers bother with sonatas? And poets with sonnets? Clearly, we are not going to see a
toothpaste made of the Moonlight Sonata, or the portrait of Mona Lisa, or the sonnets of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning? What use do these have in our lives? Isn’t the answer that they are part of
what makes us human? Aren’t they a distinguishing trait of homosapiens? If so, aren’t science,
physics and math equally—if not better—distinguishing traits of homosapiens? Perhaps we don’t
question art, music, and poetry because they are vehicles of enjoyment for us. But in order to
enjoy them, we must understand them; and with some training, which starts when we reach our
toddling age, we do understand them. It is not, however, as easy to understand the physics behind
the art of particle creation and interaction,18 and the question of practical utility has become a
comforting excuse for many people to avoid physics and other hard sciences altogether; and with
that, the most important trait of our species.
The second answer is that as homosapiens we have been trying to understand our surroundings
ever since we started to walk on our two feet. It is (no, it ought to be) quite natural for humans to
be curious, ask questions about the universe, and try to understand it without enslaving the exercise
of understanding with fetters of practical utility. While at the beginning, the evolutionary trait of
curiosity was naturally instilled in every individual, today that same curiosity is present mostly in
children and scientists. In a very real sense, scientists are the agents of our future evolution. If

we tie this curiosity with the rope of utility, pragmatism will become the dominant ideology of our
race, as it became the dominant ideology of our race inﬂuenced by the Roman empire two millennia
ago; and just as then, we may fall into the abyss of another dark age.
34.2.3
The Higgs Boson
We have talked about the spin- 1
2 matter ﬁelds—the leptons and quarks—that participate
in the electroweak interactions. We have also talked about the four gauge bosons (γ, Z0,
W +, and W −) that mediate the electroweak force between the matter ﬁelds. It appears
that we are done. After all, what else is there except material objects and forces among
them? Well, there is something else!
Remember the Higgs mechanism, whereby some of the gauge ﬁelds “eat up” the Gold-
stone bosons and become massive? (See Box 34.1.5 and the discussion preceding it.) In
order to give mass to the gauge bosons, the Higgs mechanism introduces a scalar ﬁeld—
usually denoted by φ—into the theory.19 And when you have a ﬁeld, you have a particle.
Higgs boson is the “God
particle.”
The particle content of the ﬁeld φ is the Higgs boson; sometimes called the “God parti-
cle,” because it gives mass (and somewhat erroneously, existence) to all the other particles.
This is the last piece of the electroweak theory left to be discovered. It is predicted to be
extremely massive, perhaps of the order of 100 to 150 GeV.
With all the predictions of the electroweak having been substantiated, there is little
doubt in the minds of the elementary particle physicists that the Higgs boson will eventually
be captured. It is only a question of when and where. The laboratory that can pump
suﬃcient amount of energy into its accelerator will be the ﬁrst to see the “God particle.”
At this point, all eyes are on Geneva, where the physicists at the European Center for
Particle Physics are attaching the last pieces of the largest accelerator ever, the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC),20 in the hope that within a few years, they can announce the
discovery of the Higgs boson.
18Not because physics is intrinsically hard, but because we do not start our training in physics at an
early age—if we ever do. In an unlikely world in which children learn physics and “play” in laboratories,
while being completely deprived of art and music, physics is easy and enjoyable, and art and music, “hard
subjects” in high school!

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
The last section described one of the nuclear forces, the weak one; and in the process, uniﬁed
the electromagnetic force with that force. What about the strong nuclear force? What holds
the protons and the neutrons inside a nucleus? More fundamentally, what holds the quarks
inside protons and neutrons? To answer these questions, we reexamine the quark model.
34.3.1
The Quarks
Section 33.2.2 discussed the quark structure of hadrons. One of these hadrons, the spin- 3
2
baryon we called ∆++, consists of three u quarks, all of whose spins are up. Now suppose
that we were to “bring” three u quarks together to form a ∆++, in analogy with forming
atoms by bringing electrons and nucleons together.
In the latter case, Pauli exclusion
principle limited the number of electrons one could assemble in the lowest energy state. For
example, only two of the three electrons of a lithium atom could end up in the lowest energy
state; the third one has to go to the next energy level. These energy levels diﬀer slightly (a
few eV), which is orders of magnitude smaller than the rest energy, E = mc2, of the atom,
which is billions of eV. In other words, the mass of a lithium atom is the same whether its
third electron is in the second energy level, or the third, or any other higher level.
The world of quarks is a world of much higher energies. If a quark inside a hadron moves
up to a higher “energy level,” the identity of the hadron will change, because the diﬀerence
in the energy of two levels can reach millions or even billions of electron volts, aﬀecting the
rest energy, i.e., the mass, of the hadron; and hadrons diﬀering in their masses are diﬀerent
hadrons. For example, there is a group of baryons which have very similar properties to
∆++ except for their increasingly higher masses. It is believed that the quarks of each
member of the group are in higher and higher energy levels, and that ∆++ itself is the
ground state of the group with all its quarks in the lowest energy level. In the context of
the atoms, it is like having the three electrons of a lithium atom in the lowest energy state
with all their spins pointing up.
To allow the quarks to be in the lowest energy level of a baryon without violating Pauli
exclusion principle, Gell-Mann introduced the notion of a color charge. Each quark in a
Quarks have color

baryon (including the ∆++) has a diﬀerent color; and a red quark diﬀers from a green
quark, and the two diﬀer from a blue quark. You can place a red quark next to a green
quark, next to a blue quark all in the lowest energy state of a baryon with all their spins
pointing up without violating Pauli exclusion principle! Furthermore, it is the “force” of
this color charge that holds the hadron together, just as the (electric) force of the positive
nucleus and the negative electrons holds the atom together.
We denote the color of a quark by a subscript under its symbol. For example, a red up

quark is denoted by ur, a green charmed quark by cg, and a blue strange quark by sb. The
net color charge of a hadron is zero. Stated diﬀerently, a hadron is colorless (or white). The
mathematical theory of colored quarks predicts two colorless combinations: a quark and
an antiquark of the same color, and three quarks of diﬀerent colors. The ﬁrst combination
gives the mesons, the second, the baryons. Thus, a positively charged pion could be formed
from any of the following three combinations: ur ¯dr, ug ¯dg, or ub ¯db; and the quark structure
of a proton could be urugdb, urubdg, or ubugdr.
34.3.2
The Gluons
The same mathematics that classiﬁed hadrons and uniﬁed the weak and electromagnetic
interactions also explains the strong nuclear force. The Lie group theory—in its local (gauge)
version—puts the three color charges of quarks in a triplet and allows the resulting eight

gauge bosons to intermediate the force between them.21
These gauge bosons are called
gluons, because they “glue” the quarks together inside hadrons; and the theory of quarks
interacting via gluons is called quantum chromodynamics or QCD.
BIOGRAPHY
David Gross was born in Washington, D.C., on February 19, 1941, to Bertram Meyer, son of immigrant
Jewish parents from Czechoslovakia-Hungary, and Nora (Faine), born in the Ukraine, immigrated to
the United States with her family after World War I. In David’s family, the children were encouraged to
read at a very early age. His father and mother treated their children as intellectual equals, thus greatly
bolstering their self-conﬁdence and interest in ideas of all kinds. In 1953, his father’s job took the family
to Jerusalem. One of the great advantages of growing up in Jerusalem at that time was the absence
of television and the many other distractions present then and now in the United States. Thrown back
onto his own resources, he became an avid reader. From the age of 13, he was attracted to physics and
mathematics. He studied mathematics on his own and soon, exceeding the knowledge of his teachers,
was excused from mathematics classes. Determined to become a theoretical physicist, upon graduating
from High School, he entered the Hebrew University and majored in physics and mathematics. After
receiving a B.Sc., Gross applied to graduate schools in the United States, and was only accepted at the
University of California at Berkeley. In 1964, he started to do research under the supervision of Geoﬀrey
Chew, the charismatic leader of the S-Matrix “bootstrap” approach to the strong interactions. Gross
found this revolutionary new theory very exciting at ﬁrst, but gradually became disillusioned. He rapidly
ﬁnished a thesis and spent most of his last year at Berkeley in thoughts of new directions. Concluding
his graduate studies in 1966, Gross was nominated to the Harvard Society of Fellows, where he started
on the path that led to the discovery of asymptotic freedom and QCD. In 1969, having had many oﬀers
for faculty positions, he decided to go to Princeton, as an assistant professor, where he had a remarkable
group of graduate students, especially Frank Wilczek (codiscoverer of QCD) and Edward Witten (one
of the founders of string theory). He shared the 2004 Nobel Prize in physics with his student Frank
Wilczek and David Politzer.
Our discussion of Section 34.1.2 told of two ways of having short-ranged forces: spon-
taneous symmetry breaking (SSB), by which gauge bosons acquire mass, and conﬁnement.
The latter is at work in the strong forces between quarks. In any nonabelian gauge theory—
i.e., any theory which has more than one particle in its multiplets—in which SSB is absent,
the gauge bosons carry charges (such as the color charge under present discussion), which
not only holds the particles together, but also the gauge bosons themselves. In the case of
the quarks, the color charges carried by the gluons makes them attract each other and the
quarks into a “sticky glue.”
An outcome of the interaction among gluons is that the strength of the force between
quarks increases with distance. In contrast to the electrical force between two electrically
charged particles, which decreases as you pull them apart, the color force between two
quarks increases when you pull them apart: quarks strongly resist separation.
This is

gluons are not found.
also true of the gluons themselves.
So, while the quarks and gluons materially reside
inside hadrons, one cannot forcefully knock them out of hadrons, because any attempt
at separating them will encounter a strong resistance which only increases with separation.
That is why isolated quarks and gluons cannot be found: isolation means inﬁnite separation,
and inﬁnite separation means inﬁnite resistance. The energy aimed at separating the quarks
will instead create other quarks and antiquarks which pair up with the original quarks to
form new hadrons (see Section 33.2.3).
The notion of color as a property of quarks originated in the quark model of hadrons
in the mid 1960s.
But it was not until 1973 that it was used as the main ingredient
in a dynamic theory of hadrons, quantum chromodynamics.
QCD has been extremely
successful in explaining and predicting the outcomes of hadronic collisions and structures.
It was because of this success that the 2004 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to the three
21If you are familiar with Example 34.1.2, then you may care to know that the Lie group associated with
the three colors is SU(3). Therefore, the number of gauge bosons is 32 −1 = 8.

remarkably successful in explaining and predicting all the fundamental interactions22 of all
particles. As we have numerously seen, these interactions are best described by Feynman
diagrams. Let’s take a look at some.
BIOGRAPHY
Frank Wilczek’s grandparents emigrated to the US from Poland on his father’s side and from Italy on
his mother’s side in the aftermath of World War I. Both his parents were born on Long Island, and he
was born in 1951. His parents were children during the time of the Great Depression, and their families
struggled to get by. This experience shaped many of their attitudes, and especially their aspirations
for Frank.
Frank went to public schools in Queens, and was fortunate to have excellent teachers.
Because the schools were big, they could support specialized and advanced classes. At Martin van
Buren High School there was a group of thirty or so students who went to many such classes together,
and both supported and competed with one another. More than half of them, including Frank, went
on to successful scientiﬁc or medical careers. Frank went to the University of Chicago with large but
amorphous ambitions. He read voraciously in many subjects, but he wound up majoring in mathematics,
largely because doing that gave him the most freedom. During his last term at Chicago, he took a
course about the use of symmetry and group theory in physics and he felt an instinctive resonance with
the material. For graduate work, he went to Princeton University’s mathematics department, but kept
a close eye on what was going on in physics. He became aware that deep ideas involving mathematical
symmetry were turning up at the frontiers of physics; speciﬁcally, the gauge theory of electroweak
interactions. He started to talk with a young professor named David Gross, and his proper career as a
physicist began. His collaboration with Gross led to the discovery of QCD for which they both won the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004.
The most common procedure for creating heavy hadrons is the collision of particles
and antiparticles. Fermilab uses protons and antiprotons, while electrons and positrons are
used at SLAC. In either case, a fundamental particle (electron or quark) collides with its
antiparticle at very high energies, converting some of the energy of motion into matter.
Figure 34.8 shows two important examples of such processes. In Figure 34.8(a) an electron
collides with a positron, both of which annihilate into a virtual photon, and the energy
carried by the photon turns into a charm and anticharm pair, which could bind to form a
charmonium (or could bind with other quarks and antiquarks produced similarly to form
a variety of hadrons). In Figure 34.8(b) an energetic up quark in a proton annihilates an
equally energetic antiup quark in an antiproton into a virtual photon, whose energy turns
into a bottom and antibottom pair, which could bind to form a bottomonium or—if other
quark-antiquark pairs are produced—a variety of other hadrons.
The gauge boson exchanged between the participating particles determines the kind of
interaction taking place. The exchange of photon in the ﬁrst two diagrams of Figure 34.8
makes those two processes electromagnetic. The ﬁrst process cannot be strong because
electrons do not have color charge. The only other alternative is the exchange of Z0, which
although possible, contributes negligibly to the process, as detailed calculations show. On
the other hand, the exchange particle of Figure 34.8(b) could be either a Z0 or a colored
gluon.
While the ﬁrst two diagrams of Figure 34.8 are collision processes, the last two represent
weak decays. Figure 34.8(c) is the beta decay of a d quark. This, of course cannot happen
22Gravity is an exception. It plays no role in the energies and distances available in accelerators. However,
it becomes important in energies that were once available moments after the big bang.

in isolation; however, if the d quark is inside a neutron (bound by the exchange of colored
gluons to two u quarks), then the decays can represent a neutron beta decay as shown in
Figure 34.8(d). These and other, more complicated diagrams corresponding to actual phys-
ical processes, can be translated into mathematical expressions, which theoretical physicists
have calculated, and the results of calculations have been compared with high energy exper-
iments. In these comparisons, the standard model has emerged as a remarkably successful
theory in describing three (electromagnetism, weak nuclear, and strong nuclear) of the four
fundamental forces of nature.
34.5
Grand Uniﬁcation
Our experience with gauge theories has shown that the more elaborate the symmetry of
the theory (the Lie group), the larger the number of gauge bosons, and therefore, the more
forces included in the theory. For example, the electroweak theory grouped two particles
together and came up with four gauge bosons, including the photon and three weak gauge
ﬁelds; thus unifying electromagnetism with the weak nuclear force.
The uniﬁcation of forces via the enlargement of the Lie group caught the attention of the
physicists in the 70s and 80s. It was thought that one could achieve a “grand” uniﬁcation
by grouping more fundamental particles together and using the machinery of Lie groups
and gauge theories. These grand uniﬁed theories or GUTs have not been as successful
as the electroweak theory; however, the idea is so elegant that a brief account of grand
uniﬁcation is worth our while.
The fundamental particles to be grouped together are, of course, the quarks and the
leptons. That there may be a kinship among these two categories of particles comes from
the following observations:
• there are six leptons and six quarks coming is three doublets [see Table 34.1 and
Equations 34.1 and 34.3];
• as far as we can tell, both leptons and quarks are point particles with no structure
within; the radius of the electron, for example is known to be less than 10−18 m;
• consider the lightest pairs of leptons and quarks;

b for the quarks, where the subscripts indicate the color of the pairs; if
you add all the electric charges of the quarks you get +1, which cancels the negative
charge of the lepton pair, giving a total electric charge of zero, an indication that
perhaps quarks and leptons belong to a (electrically neutral) family.
23Here we are ignoring the quark and neutrino mixing discussed after Equation (34.3).

three colors.
The most direct generalization of the electroweak uniﬁcation puts three colored quarks
and an antilepton pair in one family of 5 fundamental particles and 24 gauge ﬁelds.24 The
mathematics of this particular generalization makes a larger family as well. Equation (34.4)
shows two such groupings.

Note that in both cases the family is electrically neutral as a whole.
What are the 24 gauge ﬁelds? Some of them are already familiar. For example, the
gauge ﬁelds that connect—in the sense of Box 34.2.1—the ﬁrst three members of the ﬁrst
family of Equation (34.4) are the eight gluons; and the ones that connect the last two
members of the family are the four electroweak bosons. The remaining 12 gauge ﬁelds,
generically denoted by X (whose electric charge is ± 4
3) and Y (whose electric charge is
± 1
3) are responsible for new interactions. Some of the vertices of these new interactions are
shown in Figure 34.9. These vertices promise an intriguing possibility.
Take the last vertex of Figure 34.9; rotate it 90◦counterclockwise (see Box 32.2.2 to ﬁnd
out how processes are made out of vertices); take the ﬁrst vertex of Figure 34.9; rotate it
90◦clockwise; now tie the two gauge bosons together to obtain Figure 34.10(a). This ﬁgure
describes a physical process in which two up quarks turn into a positron and an antidown
quark.
Now imagine that the initial two u quarks are inside a hadron, say a proton, shown as
an oval in the lower part of Figure 34.10(b). At the end of the process, there will be three
fundamental particles: a down quark remaining intact from the initial proton; an antidown
quark coming from the interaction of the initial two up quarks; a positron also coming
from the two up quarks. The d and the ¯d interact via gluons and conﬁne themselves inside
a hadron, the π0, shown as an oval in the upper part of Figure 34.10(b). The positron,
having no color charge, cannot interact strongly, and escapes to outside (to be most likely
annihilated by one of the many electrons awaiting its arrival). The upshot of all of this is
the intriguing decay of a proton: p →π0 + e+.
24In the language of Lie groups, the symmetry group is SU(5), leading to 52 −1 = 24 gauge bosons.

What do you know? 34.8. Can you come up with another Feynman diagram for
proton decay?
The proton decay may seem to be a drawback for GUTs, because protons are the essential
ingredient of every element—including all the material we are made of; and the decay of
protons is tantamount to the decay of everything! This clearly is not happening. So why
do we even bother to talk about GUTs? The answer lies in the rate at which the proton
decays. Recall from Section 31.2.1 that any decay process is characterized by a half-life. If
the half-life is short, we can observe a lot of decays; if the half-life is long, we can observe
some decays; if the half-life is very long, we may observe only a few decays; and if the
half-life is incredibly long, we may have a hard time observing any decays.

Figure 34.10: (a) Two u-quarks interact via an X particle to turn into a positron and a d-quark. (b)
The proton decay p →π0 + e+.
In the case of the proton, the rate of decay depends on the mass of the X boson: the
more frequent the decay the less massive the X boson, and vice versa (see Example 34.1.4).
Experiments have shown that the half-life of the proton is at least 1031 years.25
This
sets the mass of X at about 1014 GeV. The electroweak bosons, which took an incredible
amount of resource for their discovery in 1983, are less than 100 GeV. To provide more and
more energy, the circumference of the accelerators need to be increased more and more.
For the electroweak bosons this circumference was a few kilometers. To produce X, the
circumference has to increase to many times the Earth circumference!
While it seems impossible to observe the X particle directly, proton decay, as rare as
it may appear, is actually observable. Equation (31.2), describing any decay process, is a
statistical equation. It gives the (approximate) number of particles left after some time. To
see half of particles decay, we, of course, need to wait one half-life. But if we are content
with observing only a few decays, we don’t have to wait that long. We can turn the question
around: How many initial protons do we need in order to see 100 decay events in one year?
With t = 1, N(t) = N0 −100, and thalf = 1031, Equation (31.2) gives N0 = 1.44 × 1033.
With 3.3 × 1029 protons per ton of water, we need 4360 tons of water to see approximately
100 proton decays in one year. Example D.34.1 on page 66 of Appendix.pdf gives the
numerical details.
In the summer of 1982 a group of experimental particle physicists ﬁlled a pool 22.5 m
long, 17 m wide, and 18 m deep in a salt mine near Cleveland, Ohio with 8000 tons of water.
The mine, safely located 600 m under Lake Erie, was fairly immune from the hundreds of
thousands of cosmic particles hitting the surface of the Earth every second. Furthermore, an

extra 2 m thickness of water on all six sides of the pool was designated as a shield rather than
a source of decaying protons. This left 3300 tons of water as the source, potentially yielding
about 75 proton decays per year. By early spring of 1983, after 204 days of observation and
hoping to see some of the 40 expected events, the group reported the absence of the decay
of protons, dealing a violent blow to GUTs.

Answers to “What do you know?”
34.1. A square is the most symmetric; a parabola is the least symmetric.
34.2. x3 and x2 + x3 are not symmetric under change of sign. The rest of the expressions
are.
34.3. The gauge particle in the left diagram must be positively charged to neutralize the
negative lepton in the initial state and make the initial total charge equal to the ﬁnal charge,
which is zero. The gauge particle in the right diagram must be negatively charged to make
the ﬁnal total charge equal to the initial charge, which is negative.
34.4. Consider the µ−vertex. You can have a νµ or µ−at the ﬁnal end of this vertex. If νµ
is at the ﬁnal end, then the gauge boson would be a W −moving away from the vertex. But
then the e−vertex cannot accept this W −, because, with electron having another minus
charge, the ﬁnal end of the electron vertex would have to be doubly charged, and there are
no such particles. Therefore, the ﬁnal end of the muon vertex has to be a µ−, in which
case the gauge particle has to be neutral, i.e., a photon or a Z0. Then this neutral gauge
particle can be absorbed by the e−vertex which would have an e−at the ﬁnal end of the
vertex.
34.5.
Neutrino cannot have a photon at its vertex, because it is neutral. So the only
exchanges could be W or Z0, and both are possible. The W exchange would give rise to
e−+ νµ →νe + µ−reaction, and the Z0 exchange would yield e−+ νµ →e−+ νµ.
34.6.
The simplest diagram has an electron and a positron in the initial state, such as
the diagram in Figure 34.11(a). This is one of the ways charmonium is actually produced.
Instead of electron and a positron one can use a quark and its antiparticle. For example, an
up quark in a proton and an antiup quark inside an antiproton could replace the electron
and positron of the ﬁgure.
34.7.
On the left of the µ−-decay diagram, replace µ−with τ −and νµ with ντ. This
will give the second decay mode in Equation (34.2). On the right of the diagram you just

obtained, replace e−with µ−and ¯νe with ¯νµ to get the ﬁrst decay mode in Equation (34.2).
34.8.
The quark content of π0 is not only d ¯d, but also u¯u. So, a diagram like the one in
Figure 34.11(b) is another candidate for proton decay.

New Age “Physics”
The decade of the 60s was a mixture of the good, the bad, and the nonsense. The unpop-
ularity of the American war in Viet Nam spread rapidly across campuses, into the streets,
and beyond borders. The misconceived association of science with the war initiated an
antiscience wave that propagated with unprecedented speed into all strata of human pop-
ulation, including the academia. The antidote of science very naturally emerged as the
folklore and tradition of the very peoples at which the atrocities of the war were aimed.
The oriental way of life became a panacea of the New Age. The new generation of
“revolutionaries” protested against everything rooted in western civilization, and strove
to replace them with their eastern counterparts: scientiﬁc medicine gave way to Qi-gong,
acupuncture, and a host of other alternative medicine practices; western religion and phi-
losophy were replaced by Hare Krishna and Eastern mysticism; the mind-body exercises
became increasingly popular.
The New Age Movement has a history that goes back to the nineteenth century spiri-
tuality, but it picked up momentum in the 1960s in the midst of a “cultural revolution” in
which all established institutions and ideas, including religion, came under scrutiny by the
new generation of students. The “establishment” became a hated word, and it eventually
encompassed anything that was “old.” The more authoritative western religions were re-
placed by the decentralized Eastern theosophy. In the absence of any authority, ideas from
atheism, monotheism, polytheism, Buddhism, Chinese folk religion, Christianity, Hinduism,
Islam, and Judaism, as well as astrological,1 ecological, and archaeoastronomical ideas could
coexist in the New Age spirituality.
Among the adherents of the New Age Movement were some physicists, who, in the
crowded marketplace of such diverse ideas, found a kiosk to place physics. But, being a
science, physics was at odds with the rest of the ideas sold in the marketplace. Was there
a way of reconciling physics with the spiritual world of the New Age Movement? Many
came to think so. And a pioneer was Dr. Fritjof Capra, who, “sitting by the ocean one
late summer afternoon” in 1969, saw “cascades of energy coming down from outer space,
in which particles were created and destroyed in rhythmic pulses; [he] ‘saw’ the atoms of
the elements and those of [his] body participating in [a] cosmic dance of energy; [he] felt its
rhythm and [he] ‘heard’ its sound, and at that moment [he] knew that this was the Dance
of Shiva, the Lord of Dancers worshiped by the Hindus.” With these words in the preface of
the ﬁrst edition of his inﬂuential book The Tao of Physics (abbreviated as TP here) Capra
sets out to “establish” his claimed parallel between modern physics and Eastern mysticism.
What is it about modern physics that attracts the New Agers? Several things: it is the
cornerstone of modern technology (therefore, it is the basis of the physical surrounding of

the New Agers), it has reached the smallest dimensions of matter and the farthest corners
of the universe (therefore, it ﬁts perfectly with the “universal” message of the New Age
Movement), it is counterintuitive (therefore, contrasting the intuitive established classical
physics), it is highly abstract (therefore, prone to interpretation), and, most importantly, it
cannot be expressed in any human language. If you cannot “express” quantum physics and
relativity, the New Agers may argue, then “any” expression (and interpretation), including
mine, is viable.
Modern physics, especially quantum theory, is more ﬁctional than any
speculative ﬁction writer could ever imagine. And the New Agers, as we shall see later in
this chapter, use this ﬁctional character to connect modern physics to their spirituality. But
ﬁrst, let us see how great physicists themselves put a mysterious halo around the quantum
theory and paved the way for the New Agers to abuse it.
35.1
Sins of the Fathers
The founders of our civilization, whether they are scientists, mathematicians, poets, writers,
musicians, or artists, share many of the same strengths and weaknesses that we possess.
Outside their areas of expertise they are quite ordinary characters, who, in particular, can
be poor judges of politics, religion, social structure, economic outlook, etc. Newton believed
in alchemy; Fourier, one of the greatest mathematical physicists of the nineteenth century,
was a close friend of Napoleon’s and joined him on some of his invasions; Einstein encour-
aged President Roosevelt to initiate the development of atomic weapons; Brian Josephson,

the discoverer of an important quantum mechanical eﬀect bearing his name and a Nobel
Laureate, is a strong believer in the paranormal; many great physicists participated in the
Manhattan Project and later regretted it. But these mistakes are not made right because
of the science of their makers, just as the science is not made wrong because of the mistakes
of its discoverers: It is the message that counts not the messenger.
Quantum theory has been the subject of the most cruel abuses by the outsiders as
well as, sad to say, the insiders, including some of the originators of the theory. The two
most important contributing factors are probably the quantum “weirdness” and quantum
universality; the latter making the theory’s presence known to a wide audience, some of
whom use the “interpretation” of the theory to legitimize their stance.
When we put the universality of the theory in the context of its time we may be able to
understand the tendency for its abuse. The 1920s were the years in which the Bolshevik rev-
olution had just succeeded in establishing the Soviet Union as an alternative socioeconomic
system which was foreseen by the believers to eventually replace capitalism. They were also
the years in which Freud was enjoying the credit of another kind of revolution: a revolution
in the “science” of the mind. These two revolutions oﬀered alternatives for the beliefs of
the existing society, and many, including some physicists, found it quite natural to oﬀer
theirs. These motives plus the desire of scientists to be able to communicate the excitement
of their discoveries to the public, and the mythically enchanting ﬂavor that quantum theory
could add to this communication, made the situation ripe for disaster.
It is unfortunate that some of the most harmful abuses of the quantum theory were
initiated by the very people who created it. Bohr, Heisenberg, Born, Pauli, and others,
prompted by the power and universality of the quantum theory, and ensnared by the charm
of its “interpretation,” proposed some of the most fatuous ideas, and made some of the
most provocative statements in the realm of politics, religion, philosophy, and psychology.
These physicists’ utterance of such amateurish statements is an unfortunate circum-
stance spurred by an enthusiasm for their revolutionary discoveries. Woefully, these state-
ments have been the starting points of the most strident attacks on physics, and the most
bizarre applications in the New Age Movement. To expose the nature of these attacks and
applications, it is therefore important to bring into the open the ﬂaws of these hasty state-
ments and to separate them from the scientiﬁc greatness of their originators. The following

Section 35.1
Sins of the Fathers
541
is a sample of this regrettable chapter in the social impact of the quantum theory.
35.1.1
Physics and Politics?
Max Born, one of the venerable founders of the quantum theory, the same Max Born that
paved the way for the rapid development of the theory with his introduction of probability
into the Schr¨odinger equation, had an interest in philosophy and politics as well.
This
interest, however, was marred by a serious confusion that stretched the relevance of the
quantum theory so far as to apply it to social phenomena. At a time when “Communism
versus Capitalism” was the topic of debate in practically all intellectual circles of Europe,
Born writes:
The thesis “light consists of particles” and the antithesis “light consists of waves”
fought with one another until they were united in the synthesis of quantum mechanics.
. . . Only why not apply it to the thesis Liberalism (or Capitalism), the antithesis Com-
munism, and expect a synthesis, instead of a complete and permanent victory for the
antithesis? There seems to be some inconsistency. But the idea of complementarity
goes deeper. In fact, this thesis and antithesis represent two psychological motives and
economic forces, both justiﬁed in themselves, but in their extremes, mutually exclusive.
. . . There must exist a relation between the latitudes of freedom ∆f and of regulation
∆r, of the type ∆f · ∆r ≈p. . . . But what is the “political constant” p? I must leave
this to a quantum theory of human aﬀairs. [Bel 98]
We can probably accept the “ﬁghting” between the particle and wave nature of light as
a metaphor, but to apply the quantum wave-particle duality to the human society makes
absolutely no sense. The wave-particle duality was achieved after a long theoretical and
experimental struggle stretched over many generations of physicists starting with Newton
and Huygens in the seventeenth century. The physicists did not invent the wave-particle
duality out of their whims; they had to accept it (somewhat reluctantly) after nature force-
fully imposed it on them. Is there any empirical evidence that Capitalism and Communism
are “dual?” If so, of what? Human society? But human society has gone through many
diﬀerent phases: hunting-gathering, tribal communes, slave-owning states, feudalism, etc.
Why not pick any two of these stages and proclaim them dual (or thesis and antithesis)?
Born then invokes the complementarity principle, and once again, without any justiﬁ-
cation, proclaims Capitalism and Communism as “two psychological motives and economic
forces” that only in the extremes are mutually exclusive, otherwise they are justiﬁed in
themselves. Then, associating freedom to Capitalism and regulation to Communism, he
writes an uncertainty principle for them. He does not say how to quantify freedom (one has
to if one wants to give meaning to ∆f) and regulation. He does not say how to assign a
matrix to each of these concepts—matrices are required for the formulation of uncertainty
principle. Finally, as though the rest of the concepts were clear and justiﬁed, he leaves the
“political constant” p to a quantum theory of human aﬀairs.
The truth is that Born’s idea can be (ab)used in practically all situations of conﬂict.
When there is no
empirical basis for an
argument, any wild
assumption can be a
basis for that argument.
When there is no empirical basis for an argument, anything can be a basis for that argument.
We could just as well (mis)apply the uncertainty principle to the present (2002) conﬂict
between the US-UK coalition and Iraq: let ∆U be the “latitude” of the US-UK interest
in the war and ∆I that of Iraq; then ∆U · ∆I ≥p. Similarly, let ∆W be the uncertainty
in Wall Street and ∆I the indecision of the investors, then ∆W · ∆I ≥E, where E is the
“economic constant” to be discovered in a future quantum theory of economics.
35.1.2
Physics and Mysticism?
If Born tried to merely connect (quantum) physics with the mundane politics, Pauli, the
great Austrian physicist, who has been compared to no less a giant than Einstein himself,

542
Chapter 35
New Age “Physics”
wanted to go beyond the secular aﬀairs of mankind. In a letter to Markus Fierz on 12
August 1948, Pauli writes:
Science and religion must have something to do with each other.
(I do not mean
“religion within physics,” nor do I mean “physics inside religion,” since either one
would certainly be one-sided, but rather I mean the placing of both of them within
a whole.) I would like to make an attempt to give a name to that which the new
idea of reality brings to my mind: the idea of reality of the symbol. . . . It contains
something of the old concept of God as well as the old concept of matter (an example
from physics: the atom. The primary qualities of ﬁlling space have been lost. If it were
not a symbol, how could it be “both wave and particle?”). The symbol is symmetrical
with respect to “this side” and “beyond” . . . the symbol is like a god that exerts an
inﬂuence on man. [Bel 98, p. 29]
In essence, Pauli is saying that because we cannot picture the electron as both a wave
and a particle, we have to accept the fact that it is only a symbol, and this symbol is a
manifestation of some kind of a god.
Pauli’s mysticism is also demonstrated in a series of letters he wrote to Jung, the Swiss
psychologist, in which not only did he report of his numerous personal dreams anonymously,
but also participated in a physics-psychoanalysis dialog with Jung. Pauli adopts the Jungian
concepts of “synchronicity” and “collective unconscious” and proposes that the simultaneous
appearance of the physical concept of “ﬁeld” and the psychological concept of “unconscious”
in the nineteenth century is a manifestation of this “collective unconscious” [Lak 70, p. 84].
The “collective unconscious” and the “symbol” are diﬀerent manifestations of a Neo-
Platonic spirit or soul that Pauli advocated because of his “interpretation” of the statistical
nature of the quantum theory. His argument goes something like this: Quantum physics
says that (microscopic) objects obey a fundamentally probabilistic law.
Therefore, the
microscopic and macroscopic world must be statistical; and in a statistical world one cannot
have causality. If causality is to be abandoned, we also have to abandon “rationality.” If
rationality and reason cannot explain the natural phenomena, there must be a universal
entity that governs the behavior of objects of reality. This entity is what Plato called the
Idea, or Form, or Soul (or anima mundi in Latin).
The ﬂaw of Pauli’s argument is, of course, to extrapolate a statement that applies to
individual atoms to a collection of trillions and trillions of atoms. We have already seen
what a qualitative diﬀerence exists between a few random events and a large collection of
such events, the diﬀerence that we stated as the law of large numbers (see Section 16.3).
Although atoms and their constituents obey the probabilistic laws of the quantum theory,
and their individual behavior is unpredictable and “irrational,” any macroscopic collection
of these atoms behaves quite predictably and rationally. That is the diﬀerence between

physics and philosophy: physics distinguishes between quantity and quality, philosophy
does not.
35.1.3
Observer-Created Reality?
The most damaging “interpretation” of the quantum theory is the abolition of objectivity,
the tenet of science. The alleged downfall of objectivity arises for two reasons: the prob-
abilistic nature of the theory and the interaction of the measuring device with the object
of measurement. The ﬁrst reason was advocated most strongly by Pauli, while Bohr and
Heisenberg promoted the second reason. Objectivity, the probability argument goes, means
the existence of the outside world independent of the observer. This, in turn, means that if
diﬀerent observers measure the same phenomenon they get the same result. For example,
if there is a total eclipse of the Sun in a region of the globe, everybody in that region will
see it the same way. The statistical nature of the quantum theory violates this notion of
objectivity. Two diﬀerent observers measuring, say, the position of an electron may obtain

Section 35.1
Sins of the Fathers
543
two diﬀerent answers. It therefore appears that knowledge of the outside world depends on
the observer.
The second reasoning goes something like this: since any measurement is an interaction
between the observer and the observed, one can no longer say that the outside world exists
independent of the observer. This line of argument is best described by Heisenberg:
We can no longer speak of the behaviour of the particle independently of the process
of observation. As a ﬁnal consequence, the natural laws formulated mathematically in
quantum theory no longer deal with the elementary particles themselves but with our
knowledge of them. Nor is it any longer possible to ask whether or not these particles
exist in space and time objectively. . .
When we speak of the picture of nature in the exact science of our age, we do not mean
a picture of nature so much as a picture of our relationships with nature. . . . Science
no longer confronts nature as an objective observer, but sees itself as an actor in this
interplay between man and nature. The scientiﬁc method of analysing, explaining and
classifying has become conscious of its limitations, which arise out of the fact that
by its intervention science alters and refashions the object of investigation. In other
words, method and object can no longer be separated. [Hei 58]
It is not a big logical leap from these remarks to conclude that reality (the outside world),
being dependent on the observer, is actually created by the observer [Pag 83, pp. 47–48]. An
observer-created reality, of course, undermines the very foundation of science and promotes
a variety of pseudoscientiﬁc quackery. “Physics, the most exact science, tells me,” a touch
therapist may argue, “that I, as an observer, can create the reality. And since my interaction
with reality is controlled by my brain, I can inﬂuence the outside world through my mind.
With some training, therefore, I should be able to inﬂuence the body of a sick person
through my mind, and extract the disease out of his/her body. Of course, I need to bring

my hands close to the sick person to transfer the ‘healing energy’ into his/her body.”
Both arguments against objectivity are wrong. The probability argument is wrong, be-
cause it extrapolates the behavior of an individual subatomic particle to the macroscopic
world.
The law of large numbers tells us that “individual chaos leads to collective de-
terminism.” Therefore, diﬀerent observers making measurements on identical macroscopic
samples obtain identical results, as predicted by the quantum theory. Quantum theory has
as much predictive power as the classical theory, if not more. The reader recalls from our
discussion of the law of large numbers in Section 16.3, that the prediction of the outcome
of a mere trillion random events (tossing of black and white coins) is so exact that to see a
violation of the prediction one has to wait more than the age of the universe! Even at the
individual level, the theory is predicting the probability of outcomes; the problem is that to
test this prediction, you need a large number of outcomes. The statement, “The probability
of getting a head is 50%” is not violated by throwing two coins and observing that both
are head. And reality does not become dependent on the observer simply because a second
observer’s coins showed up as two tails.
The second argument, in which the interaction between the observer and the observed
is used to undermine objectivity, is also wrong. The interaction is not between the observer
(a person) and the observed, but between the observed and an inanimate and consciousless
apparatus. This observation is completely observer-independent: two (or two thousand)
observers using the appropriate instruments for measuring a particular phenomenon will get
identical (statistical) results. For instance, suppose the theory predicts that the probability
of a radioactive decay of a particular material is 0.02 and two observers look at a sample
of a million atoms of that material. If one observer sees 19,800 nuclei decaying and the
other 20,200, are we to say that the theory is wrong? Or that the reality of nuclear decay
is observer-dependent? Of course not. Both these numbers lie within 1% of the “exact”
prediction of 20,000; and the veriﬁcation of the prediction of any theory to within 1% is
a remarkable success. The two observers can be completely detached from observation by

going home at night and let the counters, recorders, and computers register the results. The
will of the observer has absolutely no eﬀect on the outcome, as disappointing as this may
be for touch therapists and “quantum healers!”
35.2
Union of Philosophy, Science, and Religion
Two trademarks of the New Age Movement are its alleged “universality,” and its abhorrence
of reductionism, a characteristic of science and Western philosophy. This universality also
deﬁnes Eastern mysticism, and forges a strong tie between the New Age Movement and
Eastern mysticism. But is universality a merit or a drawback? Is it a mark of modernism
and sophistication, or a sign of stagnation in some primitive belief system? Let history tell
us what it knows!
The ever increasing reliance of the population of ancient civilizations on agriculture
created a caste in society whose task it was to ﬁnd means to guarantee suﬃcient irrigation
and good crops. The members of this caste had to make observations of the sky to predict
seasonal changes, and to follow the movement of “gods,” upon whose mercy so much of the
fate of the earthlings depended (see Section 1.1). And to communicate with them, the caste

constructed images of these gods in their temples. A member of this caste was a scientist, a
priest, and a philosopher all wrapped up in the same person. The priest’s main goal was to
befriend gods to win their compassion. Science (astronomy) was a peripheral tool forced on
the priests because of their desire to understand the motion of gods in heaven. It was the
infancy and the primitiveness of science that led to its union with religion and philosophy.
This process is known to have happened in Egypt and Babylon where all knowledge
was monopolized by the priesthood, and temples were centers of higher learning much the
same as universities are today. In fact, we know that the early Greek thinkers frequently
visited temples in Babylon and Egypt to acquire knowledge, which was a mixture of science,
religion, and philosophy. To New Agers, this is an ideal situation. The Tao of Physics
gloriﬁes the Greek philosophy of the sixth century BC, “a culture where science, philosophy,
and religion were not separated.” “The sages of the Milesian school in Ionia,” the book
goes on to say “were not concerned with [the] distinction [between science, religion and
philosophy.]” For these thinkers, the important task was to see “the essential nature, the
real [alive and growing] constitution of, things which they called ‘physis’ ” [Cap 84, p. 6].
Eastern philosophy is entirely based on the unity of all things including mind and matter,
religion and science, body and spirit. And in this respect, early Greek philosophers were
not much diﬀerent from the Eastern mystics. The later Greek philosophers called these

early thinkers “hylozoists,” meaning “those who think matter is alive.” As much as New
Agers lament the later development of Greek philosophy, such a development was as similar
in character and as inevitable as the much earlier development of language in homosapiens.
The criticism of the early philosophers by the later Greek thinkers was a natural evolution
of superior thought from the outmoded and inferior beliefs.
Partly because of the mysticism of the early sages, superstition reigned uncontrollably
among the Greek populace.
The hylozoism of the early philosophers translated into a
variety of “spirits” for inanimate objects in the minds of ordinary people. In response to
this widespread superstition the later philosophers developed more rational methodologies.
In the ﬁght against superstition two prominent ﬁgures deserve our attention: Plato (427–347
BC) and Epicurus (341–270 BC).

Plato

sions our senses convey to us. To correct this, he recommended to completely do away with
sense impressions and rely primarily on the mind. He doubted whether sight or hearing has

545
any truth, and quoted the poets as saying that we neither see nor hear anything accurate
or clear [Whi 76, pp. 63–65]. He argued that since unequal things could suggest the same
idea,2, the idea must have resided within us. Since our senses cannot distinguish between
equals and unequals, they cannot apprehend the “truth.” Therefore, Plato concluded, the
judgments made by thought are “accurate” and “true” whereas those made by sensation are
not. In fact, the emphasis on the “Ideas” (or “Forms”) was so great that Plato arrived at
the doctrine that sensible objects were in some sense copies, or poor imitations, of “Ideas.”
The supremacy of the mind in Plato’s doctrine had some profound eﬀect on the later
generation of thinkers. For example, it greatly promoted mathematics, and paved the way
for the genius of the golden age of Greece. However, it also had its drawbacks. The primacy
of the “Idea” led Plato to argue that since the ideas cannot come from our senses, they must
have existed in us from our birth, even possibly from a previous life [Ros 72, pp. 23–27].
This led Plato to the notion of the soul and suggested that the philosopher ought to pay
more attention to the desires of the soul than those of the body.
Plato was so enchanted by the power of the mind that he refused to allow anything
that originated from outside the mind to be used in his body of knowledge, in particular
mathematics. It is well known that his attack on the then current state of geometry was

twofold. In the ﬁrst place, he took geometers to task for relying on unsupported assumptions
or axioms, for which they were unable to provide any grounds. In the second place, he
maintained that it was the fault of their procedures that they relied on sensible ﬁgures such
as those drawn in the sand, whereas what they should have been talking about were not
those sensible ﬁgures but rather certain geometrical entities which were apprehended not
by the senses, but by the mind [Whi 76, p. 96].
Geometry was a fairly advanced science at the time of Plato. It had gone through a
long experimental stage in the hands of Egyptians and Babylonians, who had discovered
many rules of thumb concerning plane and solid ﬁgures. By the ﬁfth century BC a trend
of axiomatization of geometry had been established which tried to incorporate the rules of
thumb in a more systematic analysis of geometrical ﬁgures. Plato’s contemporary geome-
ters were caught up in this transition period from experimentation to pure axiomatization.
And, Plato, being a staunch Idealist, wanted to completely do away with any further ex-
perimentation and replace the process by pure speculation.
35.2.2
Epicurus
The second philosopher combating superstition was Epicurus. However, his ﬁght against
superstition came from a completely opposite direction than Plato’s. Epicurus argued that
the weird imagery that was at the root of all superstitions originated from our mind; that
superstition was human thought run amok.
Therefore, we should not trust our mind,
but rely solely on the experience that our senses impart on us. Our senses are the only
trustworthy means that connect us to the outside world and are in immediate contact with
it.
Epicurus’s emphasis on the interaction between the senses and the outside world led

him naturally to the concept of the atom. To him, atoms were the exclusive “messengers”
that emanated from the objects in the outside world and impressed the senses. Although
Epicurus’s atom was far diﬀerent from modern atom, its idea was truly revolutionary. Based
on this idea Epicurus was able to explain many natural phenomena, which were otherwise
hard to explain. For example, at a time when the cosmos was assumed to be ﬁnite and made
of crystals, Epicurus advocated an inﬁnite universe full of atoms moving in the pervasive
vacuum.
The materialistic philosophy of Epicurus,3 although far reaching, had its drawback. Epi-

curus was weary of anything that employed the mind even to the slightest degree, including
mathematics, especially geometry, which by his time had turned highly axiomatic. Being
a staunch experimentalist, he saw in the axiomatization of geometry another attempt at
perpetuating nonmaterial and speculative apprehensions. It was in reaction to such trends
that Epicurus attacked both Plato and mathematics. A contemporary of Euclid, he consid-
ered the latter’s work on the axiomatization of geometry a fulﬁllment of Plato’s dream of
the supremacy of Ideas over the senses.
In the struggle between the senses and the mind, the latter won. In fact, Plato’s inﬂuence
on philosophy and mathematics was so great that Archimedes, the forerunning implementor
of modern scientiﬁc methodology, who combined the senses (in the form of experimentation
with ﬂuids and their containers) with the mind (in the form of conjuring mathematical ideas
from the experiments and subsequently proving the ideas), kept his methodology a secret

for fear of being branded as one who “dirties his hands.” The primacy of the mind over the
senses was in tune with Christian ideology, and the two dominated philosophy for almost
two millennia, bringing about a mental stalemate that was terminated only by returning
to the Archimedean methodology, namely by combining the senses (observation) with the
activity of the mind (theory). This was done by Galileo and Newton, and has persisted ever
since.
Scientiﬁc progress requires a decisive break from superstition in any shape and form.
In the history of our race this breakage happened in Greece—and not in any other part
of the world—in a dual mode, Platonic and Epicurean. When Archimedes realized that
these two seemingly opposite approaches actually complimented each other, it was too late,
because the Romans, who cared only about politics, law, and rhetorics, took charge of
leading humanity. The revival of scientiﬁc methodology in its modern form fell upon the
post Renaissance scientists of Europe, and not in any other part of the world, including the
Orient.
This scientiﬁc development is not welcomed by New Agers, who are more in tune with
the early Greek philosophers such as Anaximander because he “saw the universe as a kind

of organism which was supported by ‘pneuma,’ the cosmic breath, in the same way as the
human body is supported by air” [Cap 84, p. 6]. Clearly, there is a connection between
this kind of philosophy and the Eastern mysticism in which the cosmos “is seen as one
inseparable reality—forever in motion, alive, organic; spiritual and material at the same
time” [Cap 84, p. 11]. The diﬀerence is that the Greeks discovered rational philosophy and
the scientiﬁc methodology (albeit ephemerally), but the Eastern mystics did not.
35.3
Physics-Eastern Thought “Parallelism”
Capra is one of the ﬁrst to attempt to establish a connection between modern physics and
Eastern philosophy or other New Age ideas, but he is not the only one. There is a plethora
of authors having written on the parallel between modern physics and some of the New
Age notions. Such parallelism, of course, does not exist, and it is the task of this chapter
to demonstrate this. How could the authors show the parallelism, then? By relying on
some faulty statements made by famous physicists; driving a wedge between classical and
modern physics and between classical physics and Eastern mysticism; attributing inaccurate
statements to physics; making universal analogies between New Age and modern physics
that could hold for any two activities; and presenting failed ideas as if they were at the
forefront of research, while refusing to acknowledge the successes of the current physics
because it contradicts the New Age philosophy.

35.3.1
Quotations from Famous Physicists
The opening section of this chapter contained numerous examples of unorthodox statements
made by some of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century. These and other similar
statements have become valuable tools in the hands of the New Agers to advance their
mystical ideas. Some New Age authors do not stop at suchlike statements. They take even
an innocent statement by a well-known physicist and, through a labyrinth of interpretations,
give it the appearance of supporting their views. Here are some illustrative samples.
Dr. Fred Alan Wolf, in his book, The Spiritual Universe: How Quantum Physics Proves
the Existence of the Soul, narrates a story about a wanderer who visits the Buddha and
asks if there is a soul; the Buddha remains silent. The wanderer asks if there is no soul;
again the Buddha remains silent. After the wanderer leaves, Ananda, the Buddha’s disciple
inquires about the master’s silence. The Buddha replies that if he had answered yes, he
would be siding with brahmanas who hold to the eternalist theory, and if he had answered
no, he would be siding with those who hold to the annihilationist theory.
Wolf then quotes Robert Oppenheimer4 (when a student asks him about the existence
and movement of an electron in an atom) as saying:
If we ask, for instance, whether the position of the electron remains the same, we must
say “no.”
If we ask whether the electron’s position changes with time, we must say “no.”
If we ask whether it is in motion, we must say “no.”
If we ask whether it is standing still, we must say “no.” [Wol 96, p. 176]
Wolf then concludes that Oppenheimer’s remarks and the Buddha’s answers “point to the
same thing. For in both Buddhist logic and QT [quantum theory], it is necessary not to
hold any ﬁxed opinion but to see things as they are without mental projections.”
On page 224 of the same book, there is a quote from Einstein:
As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as
they are certain, they do not refer to reality.
Wolf takes this profound statement, and through an ambiguous and meandering argument
involving order and chaos and the ancient Chinese system of thought and ch’i, connects it
to how the soul talks to us!
The Dancing Wu Li Masters, by Gary Zukav, is full of quotations and New Age conclu-
sions drawn from them. Page 29 of this book starts with a statement (of the sort sampled
in Section 35.1) by John Wheeler, a well-known American physicist:
May the universe in some strange sense be “brought into being” by the participation
of those who participate? . . . The vital act is the act of participation. “Participator”
is the incontrovertible new concept given by quantum mechanics.
It strikes down
the term “observer” of classical theory, the man who stands safely behind the thick
glass wall and watches what goes on without taking part. It can’t be done, quantum
mechanics says.
Then Zukav predictably concludes that the language of Eastern mystics and Western physi-
cists are becoming very similar.
Pursuing this line of thought, the participator cannot separate himself from the world,
the concept of the outside world loses it meaning, and since the existence of the outside
world is the tenet of objectivity, the notion of objectivity also loses its meaning.5 We then
read:
. . . We cannot eliminate ourselves from the picture. We are a part of nature, and
when we study nature, there is no way around the fact that nature is studying itself.
Physics has become a branch of psychology, or perhaps the other way round.
4A prominent American physicist noted for his leading role in the Manhattan Project.

Zukav then gives a quote, in which Carl Jung, the Swiss psychologist and psychoanalyst,
connects the psyche of an individual and the outside world. Finally, the following quote by
Wolfgang Pauli (who corresponded extensively with Jung),
From an inner center the psyche seems to move outward, in the sense of an extraversion,
into the physical world . . .
seals the conclusion that Zukav is trying to reach: “If these men are correct, then physics
is the study of the structure of consciousness.”
The preceding quotes are just representative samples. If you take any New Age book and
ﬂip through it, chances are that you’ll see many quotes from Bohr, Heisenberg, Born, Pauli,
and many other modern physicists. These quotes, the fault of some of which we analyzed in
Section 35.1, are the indispensable basis of the arguments used to connect modern physics
with Eastern mysticism.

While Plato’s rational philosophy, with its denial of the senses, promoted the idea of a Soul,
albeit of a diﬀerent kind than the soul or spirit of the early Greek philosophers, Epicurus,
with his emphasis on the senses and his hypothesis of atoms, drew a clear line between
matter and spirit. This distinction became the cornerstone of Western thought, including
both religion and science. Western religion separated matter and spirit and concentrated
on spirit; post-Renaissance science also separated matter and spirit but focused on matter.
Both science and Western religion broke away from their early Greek roots. And since
Eastern mysticism is very similar to the early Greek philosophy, science (in particular,
classical physics) and Western religion have nothing in common with the Eastern philosophy.
If Eastern mysticism is to parallel modern physics, and if the former has nothing in
common with classical physics, then it becomes essential for the New Agers to separate
classical physics from modern physics so they can tie the latter with Eastern mysticism.
To do so, they only look at the diﬀerence between the two. Consider the following passage
from Zukav’s book:
Li . . . means “organic pattern.” The grain in a panel of wood is Li. The organic
pattern on the surface of a leaf is also Li, and so is the texture of a rose petal. In
short, Wu Li, the Chinese word for physics, means “patterns of organic energy” . . . .
This is remarkable since it reﬂects a world view which the founders of western science
(Galileo and Newton) simply did not comprehend, but toward which virtually every
physical theory of import in the twentieth century is pointing! [Zuk 80, p. 5]
The words “organic” and “energy,” the telltale signs of the New Age Movement, are both
embraced in Wu Li, the Chinese word for physics. Do we need any stronger evidence for
the connection between (modern) physics and Eastern thought? And it has to be modern
physics, because there are no “patterns of organic energy” in classical physics.
Here is an argument for separation found in TP:
The concept of matter in subatomic physics, for example, is totally diﬀerent from the
traditional idea of a material substance in classical physics. The same is true for con-
cepts like space, time, or cause and eﬀect. These concepts, however, are fundamental
to our outlook on the world around us and with their radical transformation our whole
world-view has begun to change. [Cap 84, pp. 3–4]
After this quote, Capra claims that such changes brought about by modern physics lead
toward a worldview similar to those held in Eastern mysticism.
Alternative medicine is one of the hallmarks of the New Age Movement, and if there is
a “scientiﬁc” explanation for this kind of medicine, it has to be groped for in the quantum
theory and relativity. An alternative medical doctor, who associates quantum physics with

the healing process of his patients, ﬁrst has to dispose of classical physics as a science of
his medicine. Deepak Chopra, MD, uses some diagrams in his bestselling book, Quantum
Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine, to diﬀerentiate between classical
and quantum physics, and to aﬃliate the latter with Ayurveda, the ancient Indian medicine.
In these diagrams Chopra draws a horizontal line and speculates that everything that
we can explain in terms of cause and eﬀect occurs above the line. If event A causes event
B to happen, he puts A and B above the line and connects them with a straight arrow,
presumably showing that B follows from A. This, he claims, is the classical world of New-
tonian physics, the world of billiard balls, in which the collision of the moving ball A with
the stationary ball B will surely cause B to move, the world of the senses with which we
are familiar.
But Chopra wants to “explain” the connection between mind and body, between the
activity of the brain and the chemical and physical bodily processes that follow. To ac-
complish this, he takes advantage of the major ﬁndings in neurobiology, and reduces this
process down to its molecular level, saying that neuropeptides are chemicals that are pro-
duced and transmitted between neurons in many of the brain’s activities. But how are
the neuropeptides produced? How does one explain the creation of neuropeptides out of
thoughts?
We need to consult the quantum to really understand how the mind pivots on the
turning point of a molecule. A neuropeptide springs into existence at the touch of a
thought, but where does it spring from? A thought of fear and the neuro-chemical
that it turns into are somehow connected in a hidden process, a transformation of
nonmatter into matter. [Chop 90, p. 95]
Once again, quantum physics comes to the rescue of New Age mysticism. The region
underneath Chopra’s horizontal line is a mysterious region where inexplicable phenomena
take place. So if B follows from A and one cannot explain how A causes B, one simply
connects A to B via a U-shaped curve—a detour from the Newtonian straight line—the
lower half of which is in the region below the horizontal line. This region is outside space
and time, and unreachable by any of our senses or any physical or chemical device, so
Chopra says. And it is in this region where thought turns into neuropeptide, where non-
matter turns into matter. What does all this have to do with quantum physics? We’ll come
back to this question later.
Remark 1. It may be helpful to recount a bit of background to Quantum Healing. The hardcover
edition of the book came out in 1989 and its paperback edition in 1990. The book was dedicated,
“With a full heart and deepest thanks to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.”
In the Introduction, the
author narrates his meetings with Maharishi, in which the latter talks about some special ancient
techniques. Then he tells Dr. Chopra, “Now I want you to learn them, and at the same time I
want you to explain, clearly and scientiﬁcally, how they work”6 [Chop 90, p. 3]. And Chopra sets
out to ﬁnd the answer.
In the next few hours of their meeting, Maharashi teaches Chopra some “primordial sound”
techniques prescribed for speciﬁc illnesses, including some incurable ones. These techniques are
of such immense value that Chopra repeatedly mentions their source in his book: the book is
warmly and thankfully dedicated to Maharishi, there are many places in the book where he is
mentioned with reverence, and the index has his name as an entry with numerous reference pages.
It appears that all this takes place up to the 14th printing7 of the book! In the 15th printing, all
citations of Maharishi’s name are erased; the meetings with him, which were the starting point of
the quantum healing, are not mentioned at all; the crucial “primordial sound” techniques which
were “the strongest healing therapies in Ayurveda” and were prescribed for incurable diseases like
cancer, are gone.
■
6A technique that is in any way related to science comes after the prerequisite scientiﬁc knowledge has
been gained. One doesn’t start with a technique and then ask for (or order) a scientiﬁc explanation!
7Printing, not edition! As far as the publication date and publisher’s name are concerned, there is only
one edition of the book. All our references to Quantum Healing are made to the printings that came before
the 14th.

Chapter 35
New Age “Physics”
That classical and modern physics are diﬀerent is hardly debatable. However, what the
Modern physics has a lot
in common with classical
physics, contrary to
what New Agers want to
make us believe.
New Agers are completely avoiding is how much modern physics is dependent on classical
physics. Take the master equation in (nonrelativistic) quantum theory, the Schr¨odinger
equation. As every student of physics knows, this equation uses the concepts of momen-
tum, kinetic energy, and potential energy, all of which were directly linked to classical
physics. Furthermore, the mathematics used in writing the Schr¨odinger equation (diﬀer-
ential equations) was invented by classical physics itself. The commonality does not stop
here. Practically any concept (e.g., angular momentum and spin) introduced in the quan-
tum theory has a classical counterpart. The same is true of the relativity theory. (See
Without Newtonian
gravity, Einstein would
not have succeeded in
creating his general
theory of relativity.
Section 42.3.) When Einstein tried to write the equation of the general relativity that bears
his name, in one crucial step, he had to rely on the Newtonian gravity.
Modern physics evolved from classical physics, and when applied to circumstances in
which classical physics is valid, both give identical results. Classical physics, which explains
the motion of planets and moons beautifully, is not designed for atoms and subatomic
particles, just as quantum mechanics, which explains atoms and molecules, is not designed
for planets and moons. There is, of course, a diﬀerence in this dichotomy of the large and
the small. Quantum physics can, in principle, be used to describe planets and moons, but
its usage is so unwieldy, it is almost impossible.8 As an analogy, consider trying to measure
the distance between New York and Los Angeles. One could use a jet plane ﬂying at a
certain speed and time its ﬂight, thereby measuring the distance (by taking the product
of the time and speed). Another alternative is to use a ruler and measure the distance in
increments of one foot! Although we get practically the same result for the distance, it is
obvious which method is more feasible. Applying quantum physics to the motion of planets
and moons is as unwieldy (many times more so) as measuring the NY–LA distance with a
ruler. Similarly, applying classical physics to the motion of subatomic particles is like trying
to measure the length of a sheet of paper by sending an airplane from one side of it to the
other and timing the plane!
35.3.3
Customized Physics
Physics is the antipode of mysticism, and if the New Age authors took physics as is, they
would not be able to reconcile it with their mystical beliefs. So, they have to change it to
ﬁt their need. They do not present their altered customized physical ideas to physicists,
who can immediately identify their ﬂaws. They write their ideas for other New Agers and
the novice. These authors are, therefore, not fettered by accuracy and correctness. They
can take any one of their experiences and connect it to modern physics, once the latter has
been interpreted (im)properly.
Consider the notion of wave-particle duality. Some New Agers think that waves are
nonmaterial and wave-particle duality becomes nonmaterial to material transformation. We
have already seen how Chopra considers the area below the horizontal line of his diagrams a
region where nonmaterial thought can transform into material neuropeptide. With this kind
Here lies the connection
between mind/body and
quantum physics!
of transformation and ascribing materiality to particles and non-materiality to waves, the
connection between mind/body and quantum physics becomes irresistible. In the context
of this peculiar interpretation, light, which has both wave and particle properties, takes a
U-shaped detour whenever it transforms from wave (nonmaterial) to photon (material).
As discussed in Section 23.2, light consists of photons (particles), whose probability
distribution on a screen, after passing through a double-slit, looks like a wave.9 It is not a
single photon that can be a wave or a particle; a single photon is always a particle. However,
under certain circumstances, a macroscopic collection of photons can assemble into a wave.
8Classical physics, however, cannot—even in principle—be used for atoms and subatomic particles.
9Although Section 23.2 discussed the interference of electrons, all subatomic particles, including photons,
exhibit interference in a double-slit experiment.

Section 35.3
Physics-Eastern Thought “Parallelism”
551
Therefore, if anything, an electromagnetic wave is more material than a single photon! An
electromagnetic wave cannot turn into a photon either above or below the “line!”
Many people are intrigued by the masslessness of the photon. They equate the massless
to the nonmaterial. However, in the theory of relativity, mass has no signiﬁcance in deter-
mining a “concrete” particle. In fact, the equivalence of mass and energy through E = mc2,
allows particles to be massless, but possess energy. Photons, either individually as particles,
or in multitude as waves, are as real and as material as any other particle, large or small.
(See Food for Thought 28.3.4 for further detail.)
Remark 2. It is instructive to generalize the nonmaterial-to-material transformation occurring
under Chopra’s horizontal lines to a (more feasible) transformation of microscopic energy to macro-
scopic motion, which is as valid as the one he uses, because they are both conjectures. So, let’s
propose the following: there is no straight-line connection between (the energy of) a molecule and
the (motion of) tectonic plates. Therefore, we draw a U-shaped arrow, passing through the region
below the horizontal line, to connect the molecule to the tectonic plates. The whole area below the
line, as Chopra suggests, is not a region to be visited in space and time; it just stands for “wherever
it is you go” when you turn the energy of a molecule into the motion of tectonic plates.
Now consider the process of lifting a ﬁnger. Here is how Chopra gives an “explanation” of this
process:
If you want to lift your little ﬁnger (point A), a physiologist can trace the neurotrans-
mitter (B) that activates an impulse that runs down the axon of the nerve (C), causing
a muscle cell to respond (D), resulting in the lifting of your little ﬁnger (E). However,
nothing a physiologist can describe will get him from A to B—it requires a detour.
[Chop 90, p. 100]
A good example of illustrating the ﬂaw of this sort of reasoning is to utilize the molecule-tectonic

transformation to show how a sneeze in the American Midwest can cause an earthquake in Mexico
City. We use the argument verbatim, but change the physiological events to geological events. Here
is how it goes: the energy of one of the molecules exhaled in the sneeze (A) of a ﬂu-stricken person
in the American Midwest penetrated the Earth crust and turned into the motion of a tectonic plate
(B), carrying a seismic wave which ran to the fault under Mexico City (C), causing a displacement
of the Earth crust there (D), resulting in the collapse of a building (E). A seismologist can trace
the motion of the tectonic plate (B) that produces a seismic wave that runs to the fault under the
city (C), causing an earthquake there (D), leading to the collapse of the building (E). However,
nothing a seismologist can describe will get him from the sneeze A to B—it requires a detour.

We have so far seen how the New Agers have connected modern physics with Eastern
mysticism and Ayurveda. But New Agers are spiritual people, so they must have found a
way of connecting modern physics to spirits. Indeed Wolf has found the connection in his
book mentioned earlier. The connection takes us to the beginning of time:
. . . about 15 billion years ago, give or take ﬁve billion years, the physical universe
was created from nothing. It seems there was a big bang and some time later . . . the
universe will come to an end in a big crunch.. . . .
How about the spiritual universe? Did it have a beginning? Will it come to an end? . . .
we might wish to inquire how the soul ﬁts into this big bang and big crunch universe
. . . . What about Aristotle’s concept of the soul’s being a physical substance? Is the
soul a physical process . . . ? Or can it be simultaneously real and not physical? Does
the universe gush forth soul as it brings forth matter and energy? Does the soul require
energy? Or is the soul some form of energy itself?
. . . . If it turns out that the soul is physical, a new vision of the universe may appear—
nature not only produces matter and energy from nothing, but also creates soul. But
where is the soul? And how could nothing just produce something, anything at all?
. . . Perhaps it’s because nothing is really something after all.
. . . According to quantum theory, a vacuum . . . is not empty, but consists of a vast
amount of positive and negative ﬂuctuating energy. Thus, out of a vacuum can be

now, as I suggest, even spirit and soul.

[Our emphasis.]
[Wol 96, pp. 124–126]
The author then goes on to introduce the concept of zero-point energy, quantum vac-
uum, and the fact that vacuum, in quantum ﬁeld theory, contains (virtual) particles and
antiparticles. All these become a seemingly convincing tool to prove the existence of soul.
Let’s see how convincing the argument really is.
First, the universe did not come about from nothing. Once you say from nothing, even
if you mean vacuum, you are implying that space and time existed before the big bang. It
did not! Big bang not only created matter and energy, but also space and time. So, the
notion of “before big bang,” even if only implied, is wrong! Present physics is incapable
of describing the very moment of big bang. So, any statement made about the moment of
creation or before it, is pure speculation.
Second, the positive and negative energy that the author talks about are all virtual in
the context of Feynman diagrams [see Figure 32.2]. For example, the photon exchanged
between two electrons is virtual. Virtual photons are merely mathematical entities whose
pictorial representations are found to be convenient in theoretical calculations.
Virtual
particles and processes could have observable eﬀects only if they interact with an external
ﬁeld. And this observable eﬀect is not seeing particles and antiparticles or positive and
negative energies, but a small perturbation in an existing physical quantity. We have already
discussed one such eﬀect (see Lamb shift on page 488) resulting from vacuum polarization
and its interaction with the Coulomb force between the electron and proton of a hydrogen
atom.
Third, all the theoretical discussion in the quotation above seems to be a distraction for
the insertion of the last six words. We could replace the words “spirit” and “soul” with any
other pair of words, and nobody can tell us that our choice is less appropriate than “spirit”
and “soul,” because, ultimately, they are all “suggestions.”
Some authors take the most radical approach. They change the very methodology of
science. This approach is particularly emphasized by Fritjof Capra, who divides the scientiﬁc
methodology of physics into stages, and correctly identiﬁes the ﬁrst two stages as making
observations and developing mathematical theories. But he adds a third stage on which
Changing methodology

he dwells a great deal, because it is at the heart of his argument. Capra believes that the
crucial third stage of the methodology of physics is the physicists’ desire to convey their
results to nonphysicists, which requires them to express their ideas and theories in plain
language. Capra even require such a “translation” for physicists as well. That is, that
physicists, even when communicating their ideas among themselves, should not be content
with the formulation of their theories in the mathematical language, which nature itself has
forced upon them, but they ought to translate them into plain human languages [Cap 84,
pp. 17–18].
Physicists do feel an obligation to express their discoveries to the public. However, this
obligation stems not from a “third stage” in the scientiﬁc process, but from a desire to share
the excitement of understanding nature, and to arouse interest in a diﬃcult and mathemat-
ical ﬁeld among the youth, a minority of which will (have to) eventually constitute the
next generation of physicists. The physicists themselves have a perfectly suitable language
in which to communicate: mathematics. That is why they have to go through a rigorous
training lasting almost a decade after high school to learn this language. No doubt, they
will use a human language to communicate as well; but that is secondary to mathematics,
which contains the essential knowledge. One needs only to attend a physics conference to
see how crucial mathematics is in the communication among physicists.
To say that physicists are required to express their ﬁndings in human languages is like
saying that Chinese poets are required to translate their poetry into English. Not only is
the translation unnecessary, but the poetry often loses its meaning in the process. It would,

Section 35.3
Physics-Eastern Thought “Parallelism”
553
of course, be a great service to the English-speaking people if good Chinese poems were
translated into English. But the requirement of such a translation makes absolutely no
sense. It has been established ever since Pythagoras that Nature speaks in the language of
mathematics, and as physicists kept trying to understand Nature, they were forced to learn

this language ever so increasingly. The requirement of the translation of mathematical laws
of physics into human languages makes no sense either.
Modern physics, in particular, can only be spoken in the mathematical language. While
classical physics, which deals with familiar objects, is more tuned to our intuitive under-
standing of nature, relativity and quantum physics are so counter-intuitive and “strange”
that their comprehension demands the medium of mathematics. How else can one speak of
four-dimensional spacetime, of the creation of space and time at the big bang, and of the
inﬁnite-dimensional vectors?
35.3.4
Universal Analogies
Physics is a very precise, objective, and veriﬁable description of reality. Eastern mysticism
is a very vague, subjective, and personal experience of spirituality. They have nothing in
common. But the New Agers claim that the two are “parallel.” How do they substantiate
their claim?
One way is to ﬁnd a commonality between the two.
But their version of
commonality could, in principle, be used for any two activities. For example, Capra talks
about the long training period required of an experimental physicist before he/she can
repeat an experiment in subatomic physics. Then he goes on to say:
Similarly, a deep mystical experience requires, generally, many years of training under
an experienced master, and, as in the scientiﬁc training, the dedicated time does not
alone guarantee success. If the student is successful, however, he or she will be able
to “repeat the experiment.” The repeatability of the experience is, in fact, essential
to every mystical training and is the very aim of the mystics’ spiritual instruction.
[Cap 84, p. 23]
Just because two activities require long periods of training and have the property of
repeatability, it does not follow that there is a parallel between them. Any skill, even the
most primitive one like the punching of a boxer, requires “many years of training under an
experienced master, and . . . the dedicated time does not alone guarantee success.” And
the fact that the boxer has to “be able to ‘repeat the experiment’” is self-evident. This
similarity implies absolutely no connection between the experience of a boxer and that of a
physicist or a Zen student.
Capra introduced his third stage in the methodology of physics (see page 552) for a
purpose. Physics, especially modern physics, is highly mathematical, and as long as math-
ematics is the medium of the communication of physics, nothing unusual happens. But if
you try to translate modern physics in ordinary languages, peculiar things emerge which
could be made parallel to the “riddles” of Eastern mysticism.
The third chapter of TP opens with two quotations. The ﬁrst, by D. T. Suzuki, a Zen
master, states that since our “inner experience” transcends any kind of language, talking
about that experience leads to puzzling contradictions. The second quotation is by Werner
Heisenberg, who talks about the serious problems of language, and the fact that one cannot
talk about quantum mechanical entities such as atoms in ordinary human languages. Then
Capra argues that, since both the structure of the atom and the Zen experience cannot be
spoken in ordinary language, they must be related [Cap 84, p. 33].
The inability of two people or two groups of people to do the same thing does not mean
that those people or groups have any common characteristics. If neither Karl nor Emmy
can play tennis, do we conclude that there is some kind of sameness between Karl and
Emmy? That perhaps they have the same sport interest? It may be hard to translate
Bhojpuri poetry to English. It may be just as hard to translate Nahuatl poetry to English.

554
Chapter 35
New Age “Physics”
Does that mean that there is a similarity, a common characteristic, a parallelism, between
Bhojpuri and Nahuatl?
Some New Agers do not feel obligated to show any evidence for the mystic experience
which is allegedly parallel to modern physics. For example, a New Ager may claim that
a certain mystical experience jumps from a lower level to a higher level without oﬀering
any proof of the jump. He can then parallel the “jump” to a quantum jump and thus
“establish” the connection between mysticism and quantum physics.
That is precisely
how Chopra draws a connection between Ayurveda and quantum physics. The Ayurvedic
method of curing any disorder requires a level of total, deep relaxation. The fundamental
assumption in Ayurveda is that the human body knows how to maintain balance. A disease
throws oﬀthis balance. Therefore, to cure the disease, the lost balance should be restored
[Chop 90, p. 14].
How does one restore the balance? According to Chopra, some patients have an innate
ability10 to restore the lost balance—even if the disease that threw it oﬀis as deadly as
cancer—and in the process, they experience a dramatic shift in awareness.
At that moment [just before the cure] such patients apparently jump to a new level
of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer. . . . This leap in consciousness
seems to be the key. . . . The word that comes to mind when a scientist thinks of such
sudden changes is quantum. [Chop 90, p. 17]
Thus, according to this quote, a sudden jump from an existing level of anything to a
Any “jump” involves the
quantum theory?
new level is quantum mechanical: a jump up (or down) the stairs, a burst into laughter (a
jump in the volume of our voice), or a cough (a jump in the the amount of air coming out
of our mouths)! While the jumps just mentioned do actually exist and are veriﬁable, the
“jump to a new level of consciousness” cannot even be veriﬁed,11 let alone connected to the
quantum theory.
35.3.5
Oblivion to True Progress
The investigation of combustion started modern chemistry in the eighteenth century. A
ﬂame rises away from a burning substance. So it was quite natural to think of the burning
process as the removal of a substance from the burnt material. Phlogiston was the name
given to this substance. The phlogiston theory of burning was so predominant in the early
eighteenth century that when it was found that objects gain weight after combustion, the
advocates of the theory gave phlogiston a negative weight! The whole idea of phlogiston
was eventually abandoned in light of strong experimental evidence against it.
Heat was another concept that started on the wrong track. It was assumed to consist of
a “ﬂuid” called calorie, which ﬂows in and out of substances making them hot or cold. At
some point, two kinds of calorie were in existence: positive (causing a rise in temperature)
and negative (causing a drop in temperature). The caloric theory of heat eventually fell on
its face when it was irrevocably shown that heat was a form of energy.
Today only the historians and philosophers of science speak of the phlogiston theory of
combustion and the caloric theory of heat. Some of them take such rejected theories seriously
enough to challenge the existing theories of science. They argue that since phlogiston and
caloric theories were at some point in the past “acceptable” theories, they are as important
as, say the relativity theory “accepted” today. They completely overlook the fact that the
rejected theories were either short-lived or proposed without any experimental support, and
as soon as the theories were confronted with experiments, they proved wrong and had to
be discarded.
10Nowhere in his argument does Chopra say how to generate this innate ability in those patients who
don’t naturally have it. The cure, therefore, becomes the responsibility of the patient!
11The author himself uses the word “apparently.”

Section 35.3
Physics-Eastern Thought “Parallelism”
555
At the beginning of high energy physics in the early 1960s, numerous theories were
proposed, among which were some phlogiston-like ideas that, for lack of observational dis-
approval, survived for a few years. One such theory was the bootstrap hypothesis mentioned
at the beginning of Chapter 34. Bootstrap hypothesizes that hadrons are both fundamental
and composite. And if this sounds as if it’s coming straight from an Eastern mystic phi-
losophy book, it should be of no surprise. Bootstrap theory is a favorite among the New
Agers. For example, almost a quarter of TP, is devoted to this and the related S-matrix
theory.
Even though they are as dead as the phlogiston theory of combustion and the caloric
theory of heat, the New Agers adhere to the bootstrap and S-matrix theories.
Why?
Bootstrap’s relation to
Eastern mysticism.
Because they both existed in the physics community in the recent past, and because they
do not contradict New Agers’ beliefs.
This adherence is so strong that in the eyes of
some New Agers, any other theory is old-fashioned and futile. For example, Zukav divides

and leptons.
theoretical physics into two schools, one following the old way of thinking, the other the
new way. He associates physicists who are in search of the fundamental building blocks
of the universe such as quarks and leptons with the old school. As for the new school, he
notes the impossibility of presenting all the diﬀerent approaches pursued by the physicists
belonging to this school, mentions the ideas of a couple of physicists in this school, and
concludes:
Zukav admires
theoretical physicists
who propose unproven
speculative ideas.
These theories, at the moment, are speculative. . . .
The most successful departure from the unending search-for-the-ultimate-particle syn-
drome is the S-Matrix theory. In S-Matrix theory, the dance rather than the dancers
is of primary importance. [Zuk 80, pp. 244–245]
These words were written in 1980, four years after the charm quark, a “new building block,”
was discovered, three years after tauon, another “new building block,” was produced in the
laboratory, two years after the bottom quark, yet another “new building block,” was created,
and one year after the originators of the electroweak theory, a theory for the “building
blocks,” were awarded the Nobel Prize for physics. While all of these real discoveries are
branded “old school” and dismissed, some “speculative” theories are given legitimacy, and,
of course, the S-matrix theory gets the fullest attention.
Despite all this progress, and the recognition of the potential of the standard model
by the physics community in 1980, page 314 of the Dancing Wu Li Masters contains the
following quote from Geoﬀrey Chew, the founder of the bootstrap hypothesis:
Our current struggle [with certain aspects of advanced physics] may thus be only a
foretaste of a completely new human intellectual endeavor, one that will not only lie
outside physics but will not even be describable as “scientiﬁc.”
On page 280 of TP Capra writes:
In the Eastern view then, as in the view of modern physics, everything in the universe
is connected to everything else and no part of it is fundamental. The properties of any
part are determined, not by some fundamental law, but by the properties of all the
other parts.
Then on page 290, we ﬁnd the following quote also from Chew:
Carried to its logical extreme, the bootstrap conjecture implies that the existence of
consciousness, along with all other aspects of nature, is necessary for self-consistency
of the whole.
From this quote, Capra predictably concludes: “This view, again, is in perfect harmony
with the views of the Eastern mystical traditions which have always regarded consciousness
as an integral part of the universe.”

Chapter 35
New Age “Physics”
The ﬁrst edition of TP came out in 1975. By that time, elementary particle physicists
had discovered a promising venue to pursue their interest: gauge theories. Bootstrap and
S-matrix had left the land of physics and entered into the land of history, philosophy, and
mysticism. Only some New Agers elevated the bootstrap hypothesis and S-matrix to the
level of a viable theory. The fourth edition of TP came out in 2000. In the intervening 25
years, a lot of progress was made in the world of real physics. The charm quark, which was
proposed as part of the electroweak uniﬁcation, was discovered in 1976 (see Section 34.2.2).
The heaviest lepton, tauon, was found in 1977, and a year later the ﬁfth quark, bottom,
appeared in a particle detector at Fermilab. By 1983, enough energy could be transferred
to colliding particles at CERN that the heavy gauge particles of the electroweak theory
(W ± and Z0) could be produced there. And the last and heaviest piece of the puzzle of the
standard model of fundamental particles and interaction, the top quark, was discovered at
Fermilab in 1995. Yet there is absolutely no mention of any of these tremendous successes
in the fourth edition of TP!
Similarly, there is no mention of the successes of quantum chromodynamics, the correct
theory of the strong interaction of hadrons.
Although we see the acronym QCD in an
afterword to the second edition of the book, there is a considerable amount of misinformation
about its success. In this afterword, Capra talks about the fact that quarks have never been

observed; that physicists have invented various mechanisms to explain their conﬁnement;
that the existence of quarks “would lead to severe theoretical diﬃculties;” and that QCD
can be applied only to a very limited range of phenomena. Then he laments that “in spite
of all these diﬃculties, most physicists still hang on to the idea of basic building blocks of
matter which is so deeply ingrained in our Western scientiﬁc tradition” [Cap 00, p. 316].
This portrayal of QCD conveys the impression that physicists have invented “various
mechanisms” to ensure that quarks are conﬁned, as if they knew that quarks were not
free and then came up with a theory that conﬁned them. This is completely inaccurate.
QCD is the application of local Lie group theory (gauge theory) to the color charge. The
conﬁnement of quarks comes as a surprising by-product of this application, as explained at
the end of Section 34.1.2. The discoverers of QCD did not say to themselves, “We need
to conﬁne quarks, so let’s invent QCD!” Just as Einstein didn’t say to himself, “I need to
make light bend in the gravitational ﬁeld, so let me invent the general theory of relativity!”
Capra disparages QCD as being applied only to a very limited range of phenomena. It is
a pinnacle of either lack of knowledge or dishonesty to characterize QCD in this way while
glorifying bootstrap and S-matrix as the theories of hadrons. The fact is that QCD has been
successful in every situation in which hadrons interact strongly. Like any other good theory,
it has explained many hadronic phenomena, predicted many outcomes, and suggested new
experiments for its conﬁrmation. QCD has been so successful that the discoverers of the
theory were given the Nobel Prize in physics in 2004. On the other hand, bootstrap has
produced nothing but the satisfaction of some New Age mystics.
Capra’s lament as quoted above says it all. Holistic philosophy is opposed to any notion
of “basic building blocks of matter.” This notion is a reductionist notion, and reductionism
is in conﬂict with Eastern mysticism. Physicists, nevertheless, pursue the path that started
with Archimedes and Galileo and continues even today. At the heart of this pursuit is
speciﬁcity and reductionism, the nemesis of Eastern mysticism. Starting with the year in
which Capra conceived the uniﬁcation of Taoism and modern physics and ending with the
publication year of From Atoms to Galaxies, the following lists the Nobel Prizes in physics
awarded to those who “still hang on to the idea of basic building blocks of matter.”
1969 Murray Gell-Mann “for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classiﬁcation
of elementary particles and their interactions.”

Epilogue: The Eye of Physics
The discovery of the atomic nucleus opened the gates to a completely new territory, an
utterly unexpected entity that took all scientists by surprise. While the idea of an atom
had been in the making since the ancient times, and modern chemists had been dealing with
them for over a hundred years, Rutherford’s experiments of 1911 ushered the physicists into
unchartered terrains. The nucleus showed the theoretical physicists the right way of tackling
the problem of the structure of atoms, discovering along the way quantum physics, one of
the most encompassing theories ever.
36.1
Modern Experimental Techniques
Rutherford started an ingenious method of experimental investigation suited for the study
of atoms and subatomic particles. Prior to 1911, scientiﬁc observations were essentially
of two kinds.
First there were those observations that required direct participation of

the human senses: looking at an object either with a naked eye or through a telescope
or a microscope; putting two charged objects next to each other and “seeing” how they
attracted or repelled one another; pushing on a cylinder full of gas and “seeing” how the
thermometer’s reading changed. In all these cases, the instruments, as well as the systems
under study were in the domain of the human senses. The experimenter could see and feel
the telescope, the microscope, the thermometer, the gas, the cylinder, etc. And although
the instruments had gotten sophisticated, the reliability of their operation could be traced
back to the human senses: telescopes could see unseen planets and faraway galaxies, but
one could rely on their accuracy by comparing their performance with the performance of
the rigorously tested previous generation of telescopes in the domain of the applicability
of the previous generation. And the latter were trusted because they too were successfully
compared with their previous generation of telescopes. These comparisons went all the
way back to Galileo’s telescope. And one could rely on that telescope and its discovery
of Jupiter’s moons by comparing what it saw with what human eye saw when there was
grounds for comparison: Galileo’s telescope saw the same Jupiter that we saw, only bigger;
Galileo’s telescope saw the same Moon that we saw, only bigger; Galileo’s telescope saw
the same Milky Way that we saw, only in more detail. So, if Galileo’s telescope saw some
moons around Jupiter, they must be there.
The second kind of observation was done mostly by atomic chemists. Although the
outcome of their experiments impacted human senses (change of color or smell or other
physical properties of the products of a chemical reaction), the chemical processes of the
experiment involved hypothetical atoms and were therefore invisible.
Chemists had to
assume certain hypotheses, test the hypotheses by mixing chemicals and see if the outcome

chemical lore. If not, new hypotheses had to be proposed and tested, until observation
conﬁrmed them. Because one could see and smell chemicals, one was comfortable with the
experiments, although the invisible atoms made many people uneasy.
In Rutherford’s experiment no human sense was involved. Both the probes and the
targets were invisible! To rely on the experiment took a great leap of faith; faith in the laws
of physics and our theoretical understanding of nature. Whereas Galileo’s observation could

be “conﬁrmed” by our ability to see at least Jupiter, if not its moons, and atomic hypothesis
could be “conﬁrmed” by the visible change in chemical substances, Rutherford’s experiment
could not be “conﬁrmed” by our senses! Here lies the source of some philosophers’ mistrust
of modern experimental techniques of fundamental processes. The laws of physics are used
both in setting up the experiment and in interpreting the outcome. Can we trust such
experiments and the knowledge gained by them?
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
In the ancient village of Arud, due to some genetic disorder, the overwhelming majority

of the population was “green blind.” Anything that was green appeared gray to them. The
few who could see the color tried in vain to convince the rest of the village that the color of
trees, bushes, and grass was diﬀerent from the color of the sky just before a rainstorm. The
“green seers” would put a green leaf next to a gray picture of the leaf and would ask the
Arudians to look carefully at the two to ﬁnd the diﬀerence in color. Every time the green
seers would fail. The villagers could not tell the diﬀerence. This went on for many years.
Finally the green seers gave up, and the villagers accepted the fact that a few among them
had the extraordinary power of seeing a color that did not exist, and after a while they just
did not care about the green seers.
Not all the villagers forgot about the issue. Arudian philosophers were deeply interested
in the “epistemology of green,” as they called it. They argued that the existence of some-
thing is proved only if all (or overwhelming majority of) people agreed on it. We all agree
that horses exist, because we have all seen a horse and perhaps even ridden it. We all agree
that trees exist, because we have all seen them in our gardens or out in the country. We
have no disagreement about the blue color of the sky, or the orange color of the sunset. But
when a few people claim that the color of a tree is green rather than gray, and no one else
can see that color, then the existence of green should be questioned.
The arguments of the philosophers were so convincing that many villagers believed that
“green” did not exist. The green seers suggested a “test” for the existence of green. They
compiled a list of common green objects, gave it to a skeptic messenger, and told him to go
to the farthest village where no Arudian had gone before. Once there, the messenger was
to ask the green seers of that village to make a list of some common green objects without
showing the list he was carrying. If the two lists had a lot of overlap, then “green” must
exist. Although the test was successful, the philosophers were so eloquent and convincing
that the villagers remained skeptic, and never accepted the color “green.”
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
But nobody . . . seriously questions our knowledge of medium-sized physical objects
like trees and tables. In mainstream epistemology, sceptical arguments about trees
and tables reﬂect back on our assumptions: since we obviously do know about tables,
an argument that such knowledge is impossible challenges us to ﬁnd the ﬂaw in our
reasoning.
By contrast, scepticism in the epistemology of science is by no means just a philosoph-
ical exercise. For it is not at all obvious that we know about the entities postulated
by modern scientiﬁc theories, such as gravitational waves and neutrinos. After all, we
never have any direct sensory evidence for these entities. [Pap 97, p. 3]
This is a quote from a book on the philosophy of science, and the last sentence says it
all: Since we have no sensory evidence for neutrinos, electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms,

Section 36.2

563
molecules, genes, etc., we have all the rights to question their existence. By the same token,
since the Arudians did not have any sensory evidence for the color green, they had all the
rights to doubt its existence. But let’s go deeper into the reason that the villagers could not
see the color green: They were not equipped with the cone-shaped photoreceptors that were
sensitive to the green wavelength. On the other hand, the green seers had the equipment
or the instruments with which they could detect the green color. Looking from outside,
we can realize how silly the village philosophers were for denying the existence of the color
green simply because they could not see it.
Physicists and other scientists are the few “green seers” of our world, not because their
Scientists are the “green
seers” of our race!
physiology permits them to see what others can’t, but because their science and their
equipments are sensitive to what none of our senses can detect. An invisible alpha particle
emerging out of an invisible radioactive nucleus obeys the laws of physics as it approaches
and consequently scatters from an invisible gold nucleus all the way to the counter at which
it is detected. It’s quite natural to extend these laws, which have passed all the tests in
the visible world, to the invisible domain of the nuclei and the subatomic particles, unless
a clear and detectable contradiction results.
Why do we have to trust the click of a counter or the reading of an apparatus? Remember
the green seers’ test given to the messenger? Ask a physicist about the properties of a
proton: its charge, its mass, its spin, etc. He’ll give you a list of numbers, some to many
signiﬁcant ﬁgures. Go half way around the world; ﬁnd a qualiﬁed physicist; and ask her for
the list of the same quantities. Compare the two lists, and ﬁnd that they match exactly! On
your way back, stop at a third “village” and ask a third physicist. The third list matches
exactly with the other two. Just because we cannot see subatomic particles and processes,
it does not mean that they don’t exist. There are people who can see them. And the test of
their ability is the unprecedented accuracy with which they agree with one another. These
people are the physicists and chemists and biologists, who through laborious training and
unselﬁsh devotion to science have developed the ability to invent instruments and theories
that truly can see the domain that is invisible to ordinary human beings.
36.2
Modern Mathematical Techniques
Modern experimental techniques showed a whole new world at the heart of an atom.
The inhabitants of this world spoke in the same language that the heavenly bodies were
discovered—by Greeks and later by Galileo and Newton—to speak, only in a much more
sophisticated and poetic tone. The relativity of 1905 and 1916, and the quantum theory of
1925–26 had already employed some of the most elaborate mathematics of their time. Little
wonder that the names of the noted mathematicians of the time appear alongside the physi-
cists’. Henri Poincar´e, the brilliant French mathematician, codiscovered the special theory
of relativity (STR); Marcel Grossmann, the Hungarian mathematician and a classmate of
Einstein, discovered the connection between relativity and diﬀerential geometry, a connec-
tion that Einstein used to develop his general theory of relativity (GTR); David Hilbert,
the great German mathematician, laid the mathematical foundation of the quantum theory
half a century before the theory was discovered.
When Paul Dirac considered combining the quantum theory and STR, he had to ﬁrst
(re)invent some mathematical tools. He discovered the version of the language in which the
“Physical Laws should

beauty.”
Paul Dirac
dialogue with nature became much more transparent; the version in which nature spoke
of antiparticles and the mysterious spin. When asked about his philosophy of physics in
Moscow in 1955, Dirac responded “Physical Laws should have mathematical beauty.”
Mathematical beauty is a reﬂection of natural symmetry; and symmetry is studied in
geometry and another branch of mathematics known as group theory. When geometry and
group theory are combined with the common language of all branches of physics, namely
diﬀerential equations, a dialect of mathematics emerges called the theory of Lie groups.

564
Chapter 36
Epilogue: The Eye of Physics
Eugene Wigner, Dirac’s brother-in-law, was a pioneer in recognizing the necessity of
Lie groups in the manifold of relativistic spacetime. A quarter of a century later, when the
classiﬁcation of the “zoo” of particles created in the growing accelerators became a necessity,
Gell-Mann and Ne’eman found that these particles assemble themselves remarkably in the
representations of a speciﬁc Lie group. And Gell-Mann suggested that the most fundamental
representation of that Lie group must correspond to the most fundamental entities of nature.
That’s how he predicted the existence of quarks.
If particles assemble themselves in the representations of Lie groups, and if we know
that fundamental forces are the results of the exchange of particles, could the fundamental
forces also be connected to Lie groups? Once it was realized that the electromagnetic force
was associated with the simplest (local, gauge) Lie group, it was natural to try the next
Lie group—that was one step more complex—as a candidate for other forces. The ﬁrst
attempt by Yang and Mills was unsuccessful. However, the attempt by Weinberg, Salam,
and Glashow, which carried along the uniﬁcation of the electromagnetic and weak nuclear
forces, achieved miraculous success.
36.3
An Endangered Species?
The modern experimental and mathematical techniques have opened up a physical vista
comparable to that opened up four centuries ago by Galileo and Newton. And giants like
Einstein, Bohr, Schr¨odinger, Dirac, and others have made tremendous progress in unraveling
many of the secrets hidden inside atoms. But there are many unanswered questions and
many undiscovered pieces of the puzzle.
Today, a vanishingly small fraction of our race is pursuing the footsteps of Copernicus,
Galileo, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and Schr¨odinger. They work in ﬁelds such as high
energy physics, fundamental particles, cosmology, and string theory. In short, they are the
physicists who investigate the topics discussed in this (and the next) part of the book. En-
gaged in ﬁnding solutions to some fundamental questions of the kinds that those intellectual
giants asked, they seek answers to such questions as “How are the fundamental forces of
nature operating?” “How can we unify them?” “What is the nature of the fundamental
particles?” and “How did the universe begin and what happened subsequently?”
The pursuit of these questions have no foreseeable practical applications, just as the
pursuit of the puzzle of the hydrogen atom in the 1920s had no obvious potential for
industrial utility. However, because these questions are posed, and because they are the
unanswered questions derived from the natural pursuit of the earlier inquiries, it is the duty
of our race to expend some of its resources to support those who are asking them, even
though there is no immediate return for the expenditure. This is how it has been ever since
the people of Egypt and Babylon allotted part of their communal wealth to the investigation
of the sky by the priesthood.
Alas, the largest depositories of human resources, the proﬁt-hungry Wall Streets and
the practical-minded Sputnik-driven governments show little or no interest in supporting
such a noble pursuit. Because of the dwindling funds for fundamental research, many of
the brightest minds have left this pursuit for other occupations in ﬁnance and industry, for
which there are better ﬁnancial rewards. This “brain drain,” though unnoticeable now, will
be fatally damaging in the long run, because if continued, it will hamper an evolutionary
trend that started millions of years ago, a trend that has set us apart from the rest of the
animals.

atomic domain, brought physics to a higher stage at which it could explain the hydrogenic
nonrelativistic phenomena. Similarly, Einstein’s special relativity, also borrowing concepts
and procedures from the physics of Galileo and Newton, advanced physics to such a level
that it could explain the motion of objects that moved close to the speed of light. Classical
physics was a tree that lived for over 300 years with a single stem, growing taller and
stronger, until at the turn of the twentieth century it sprouted two new branches.
The discovery of the atomic nucleus, which used theoretical concepts entirely borrowed

from classical physics, and many experimental gadgetry also borrowed from classical ex-
perimental tools, became the playing ﬁeld for the two new branches of the tree of physics.
While the hydrogen atom was mostly explained in terms of the quantum theory alone, the
hydrogen nucleus, the proton, could not be understood but by a merger of the special theory
of relativity and quantum theory, a step taken by Paul Dirac in 1928, without being aware
of its use in the structure of the proton 45 years later.
All the progress in the understanding of the fundamental forces and particles has been
made by tackling speciﬁc problems. Quarks were the by-products of the mathematics of
Lie groups used in the speciﬁc task of classifying hadrons, whose proliﬁc production was
the result of the speciﬁc desire to learn more about the atomic nucleus; and the latter
was discovered when Rutherford sought an experimental veriﬁcation of Thomson’s speciﬁc
model of the atom. Every step that brought us closer to an understanding of the microworld,
was taken in response to a speciﬁc question, a speciﬁc problem, or a speciﬁc experiment.


Part VIII
Twentieth Century Physics:
Macrocosmology


Chapter37
Physics of the Cosmos
The material of the previous part of the book, once put in proper order, becomes the
storyline of the universe. How can the tiniest subatomic particles tell us about the vast
panorama of the cosmos? How is it that the ultimate “whole” can be understood in terms
of its paltry “parts?” If posed as philosophical questions, we may never know the answers.
But physics, in its quest for increasingly fundamental relations among natural phenomena,
has been able to give a rational and observationally conﬁrmed answer to these questions.
Brieﬂy stated, general theory of relativity (GTR) gives a picture of an expanding uni-
verse, which has been conﬁrmed by observation; the same theory predicts a time-reversed
contraction, which at a ﬁnite time in the past puts the universe at a “singularity,” an event
with no spatial or temporal extension, a point in the four-dimensional spacetime represent-
ing the universe itself at inﬁnite energy, inﬁnite temperature, and inﬁnite density. This
event has come to be known as the big bang.
Singularities are mathematical “diseases” that nature cannot tolerate. However, the
A combination of GTR
and quantum physics, a

singularity.
GTR does yield such a singularity. This simply means that GTR alone is not suited for the
extreme conditions of the big bang, although it predicts it. Since small objects are studied
in the quantum theory, only a consistent combination of GTR and quantum physics, a
theory of quantum gravity, can remove the singularity of spacetime. Unfortunately, such
a theory is, as of now, lacking.
Although today’s physics cannot explain the very onset of the big bang, as the universe
expanded and cooled down, the heat, energy, and temperature “reduced” to the amount
that the physics studied in the last part of the book becomes relevant. And that is where
we start our story of creation in the next chapter; but ﬁrst we have to look at how the two
constituents of the universe, namely matter and radiation, are held together.

interact among themselves. The dominant force being gravity, we examine its role in holding

universe, we need the full machinery of GTR. However, a (slightly modiﬁed) Newtonian
theory of gravity can also describe the behavior of a simple model of the universe surprisingly
well. The modiﬁcation involves giving mass to the energy of EM radiation and making it a
source of gravity. It is this modiﬁed Newtonian cosmology that will be the guiding light in
our search for the history of the universe.
To this end, consider two (distant) points P1 and P2 of our universe separated by a
distance R. Construct a sphere with its center at P1 and its radius equal to P1P2 as shown

in Figure 37.1, and concentrate on the motion of an object of mass m at P2. The sphere is
ﬁlled with matter and radiation exerting a force of gravity on m. The rest of the universe
has no eﬀect on m, because m happens to be in a spherical cavity as far as the rest of the
universe is concerned, and no force exists in such a cavity (see Math Note E.9.2).
As the mass m moves away from the center of the sphere due to the expansion of the
universe, it possesses both kinetic energy and potential energy, much like a projectile ﬁred
from the surface of a planet. Adding the two energies and writing the mass of the sphere
in terms of the density of the material ﬁlling it, Math Note E.37.1 on page 140 of

in. If k > 0, the expansion of the universe will eventually halt and the contraction begins.
We call this kind of universe closed. If k < 0, the universe will expand forever. We call
this kind of universe open. If k = 0, the universe will expand forever, but the expansion
constantly slows down, completely stopping only after an inﬁnite amount of time. We call
this kind of universe ﬂat. It is this latter kind of universe on which we shall concentrate,
because it is simpler, and observation points strongly in its favor.
The quantities in Equation (37.1) all vary with time (and only with time, as the universe
is assumed homogeneous and isotropic, barring any physical quantity from varying with
location or angle). For example, we know that ρ is a decreasing function of time, because
the amount of material in a given large volume of the universe remains the same but the
volume itself increases due to the universal expansion. Diﬀerent constituents of ρ may (in
fact, as we shall see, do) vary diﬀerently, and ρ may consist mostly of matter or mostly of
radiation, depending on the particular epoch of the universe under consideration.
We can obtain an estimate for ρ for a ﬂat universe. Setting k = 0 and noting that
v = HR by the Hubble law, Equation (37.1) yields ρc = 3H2/(8πG), where the subscript
under ρ stands for “critical,” because ρ for a ﬂat universe has come to be known as the

BIOGRAPHY
Aleksandr Friedmann was born to a father who was a ballet dancer and a mother who played professional
piano. He began as a very ordinary student, but soon rose to the top of his class. Upon graduation from
gymnasium in 1906, he entered the University of St Petersburg, ﬁnishing his undergraduate studies in
1910. He began his MS degree in 1911, but due to the turmoil in the prerevolutionary Russia, did not
submit his Master’s dissertation until 1922. By this time, he had taken up a new interest. Einstein’s
general theory of relativity was not known in Russia and by late 1920, Friedmann had already been
working intensively on the theory. In an article sent to Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik in 1922, he showed that
the radius of curvature of the universe can be either an increasing or a periodic function of time.
Einstein quickly responded to Friedmann’s article, saying “the solution given in it does not satisfy the
ﬁeld equations.”
Upon reading this comment, Friedmann sent Einstein the detailed calculations of
his article and asked Einstein to examine it. After analyzing Friedmann’s calculations, Einstein wrote
to Zeitschrift f¨ur Physik: “In my previous note I criticised [Friedmann’s work On the curvature of
Space]. However, my criticism, as I became convinced by Friedmann’s letter communicated to me by
Mr Krutkov, was based on an error in my calculations. I consider that Mr Friedmann’s results are correct
and shed new light.” Modern cosmology was born.
An accurate treatment of the Friedmann equation requires a knowledge of the exact
proportion of the matter and radiation contribution to the density. This makes the solution
to the equation prohibitively complicated. Fortunately, during various epochs of the uni-

verse, one of the two components was distinctly dominant, and therefore, the density in the
Friedmann equation can be assumed to be composed either entirely of matter or entirely of
radiation. The distinction between matter and radiation becomes fuzzy when the universe
is so hot that even matter particles may be moving close to light speed, in which case they
behave a lot like a photon. Thus, sometimes it is more convenient to classify constituents
as relativistic and nonrelativistic.
The dominance noted above refers not to the number, but the equivalent mass, because
it is this mass that gives rise to gravitational forces. In the case of matter, density, which
is denoted by ρm, is simply the mass density. In the case of radiation, it is the energy
density—for which there is an exact formula in terms of temperature as we shall see later—
divided by c2 (remember that E/c2 = m). When ρ consists mostly of matter, we refer
to the universe as matter-dominated, and if it consists mostly of radiation, we call it
radiation-dominated.
37.2
Matter Dominance
Let’s assume that the universe is composed mostly of matter, with negligible contribution
from radiation. Let ρm0 and R0 denote the present matter density and “size” of the universe,

572
Chapter 37

and ρm(t) and R(t) its density and “size” at time t after the big bang.
First, what exactly is the “size” of the universe? It does not refer to the actual extent
of the universe. By “size” is meant the scale of the universe, which is measured by the
separation of two “typical” distant galaxies. The best way to understand R is to concentrate
on two speciﬁc galaxies, say the Milky Way and another one far enough for homogeneity
and isotropy to hold, and let R be their separation. The variation of R tells of the variation
of the entire universe. For example, if the Milky Way is 500 Mly away from this reference
galaxy now (so that R0 = 500 Mly), and at some time t in the past their separation was
250 Mly, then we know that at time t the entire universe was half the present universe.
What do you know? 37.2. Does it make sense to say that the universe was “half”
its present size if the distance between two distant galaxies was half its present size?
Consider the sphere centered at the Milky Way (or any other galaxy) with radius R0.
The matter inside this sphere does not change as the universe expands. Using this fact,
Math Note E.37.2 on page 141 of Appendix.pdf ﬁnds R, ρm, and H as a function of
time.1 The results are displayed in the ﬁrst row of Table E.3.
Example D.37.2 on page 67 of Appendix.pdf looks at the universe when its size was
1% of its current size. It shows, for instance, that it was between 14 and 18 million years
old, that its matter density was about a million times the current density, and that its
Hubble constant was approximately 11,000 km/s per Mly, or about 600 times the current
Hubble constant.
As mentioned earlier, and as discussed in detail in the next section, the universe is—
and has been for most of its existence—dominated by matter.
Therefore, the formulas
in the ﬁrst row of Table E.3 are valid for our present universe.
In particular, the last
formula, when evaluated today, connects the value of the Hubble parameter to the age of
the universe. Since H lies between 21 and 23 km/s per Mly, or between 2.23×10−18 s−1 and
2.44 × 10−18 s−1, that formula gives an age of the universe between t0 =
2
3H = 3 × 1017 s
(9.49 billion years) and 2.73 × 1017 s (8.67 billion years), both of which are noticeably
diﬀerent from the measured age of 13.7 billion years.
Part of the discrepancy is due to the assumption of a perfectly ﬂat universe. What if
the universe were not ﬂat? A closed universe is ruled out, because it would be younger than
the two estimates calculated above. Here is why: A closed universe will eventually stop
expanding in the future. This implies that it is (and has been) slowing down, and therefore,
Accelerated expansion!
to have the present rate of expansion, it must have been expanding more rapidly than a
ﬂat universe at the earlier times. Therefore, it must have taken it less time to reach this
stage. An open universe is a more likely candidate. However, the recent observation of an
accelerating expansion casts doubt on the conventional standard cosmology. It appears that
the cosmological constant Λ, which Einstein introduced in his equation to “stop” the
expansion of the universe, plays an important role in modern cosmology and could explain
the strange acceleration.
At any rate, even if the simple ﬂat universe that we are studying is not a suﬃciently
accurate description of the present universe (although there are strong pieces of evidence
that it is), it turns out to be a good theory for the very early universe, which is physically
more interesting. This has to do with the notion of the horizon.
Horizon and the ﬂatness
of the early universe.
An observer at any point P of the universe can see events whose light signals have
had time to travel to P. The farthest of these events form a horizon. Any event farther
than the horizon from P is unobservable by P, because its light signal has not had enough
time to reach P. As the universe expands, the horizon expands with it, but at a faster
rate. In fact, while the scale of the universe increases in proportion to t2/3 [see Equation
1Instead of expressing ρm as a function of t, it is more common to write t in terms of ρm.

[see Equation (E.140) or the ﬁrst entry in the second row of Table E.3] when radiation
dominates, the horizon grows proportionately with time, as Example D.37.3 illustrates. It
follows that the horizon covers a larger and larger portion of the universe as time passes.
The horizon is a small part of a young universe; and the younger the universe, the smaller
the fraction of the universe covered by the horizon. Figure 37.2 illustrates the expansion of
the horizon relative to a two-dimensional spherical “universe.” The smaller the relative size
of a portion of a curved surface, the ﬂatter it looks (a football stadium looks completely
ﬂat, while a continent does not). Therefore, the horizon, which borders the only part of the
universe about which we can talk sensibly, covers an almost ﬂat portion of the universe at
the beginning, and the approximation of a ﬂat universe becomes especially valid for a very
young universe.
37.3
Radiation Dominance
When electromagnetic radiation is in thermal equilibrium with matter at a particular tem-
perature, it is described by the black-body radiation function (20.5). In its early stages of
evolution, when the universe is a hot plasma (a collection of positive ions and negative elec-
trons), radiation and matter are indeed in thermal equilibrium because of the interaction of
photons with the charged particles,2 and therefore, the EM radiation obeys Equation (20.5).
Decoupling of radiation
from matter.
However, as the universe cools and neutral atoms are formed, radiation no longer interacts
with matter, and the thermal equilibrium is broken. We say that radiation decouples from
matter. Two questions arise: (1) What happens to the wavelength and temperature of the
radiation? (2) How is the radiation described after decoupling?
Math Note E.37.3 on page 143 of Appendix.pdf shows that the wavelength of the
radiation increases in proportion to the scale of the universe, and that the radiation is still
a black-body radiation—even though it is no longer in equilibrium with matter—with a
temperature inversely proportional to that scale. This is a signiﬁcant conclusion, because
it tells us
Box 37.3.1. To look for the radiation left over from the big bang, watch for a black-body
radiation, including its characteristic curve.
With T0, λ0 and R0 denoting the present temperature, wavelength, and scale of the universe,
respectively, Equation (E.134) of Math Note E.37.3 yields the third row of Table E.3.
2Recall from Chapter 32 that the EM force—represented by the exchange of photons—exists between
charged particles only.

574
Chapter 37
Physics of the Cosmos
Our next task is to ﬁnd the equivalent mass density of radiation. This quantity, denoted
by ργ, is derived in Math Note E.37.4 on page 144 of Appendix.pdf and displayed in
the following equation and in the fourth row of Table E.3.
ργ(T) = 8.36 × 10−33T 4 kg/m3.
(37.2)
Combining the third and fourth rows of Table E.3 gives the density of radiation in terms
of the scale of the universe, displayed in the last row of Table E.3. This last expression,
which shows a decrease in ργ proportional to the inverse fourth power of scale size, seems
strange! After all, when we discussed the matter density, we argued that the increase in
volume—which is proportional to R3—and the constancy of the number of nucleons give
rise to an inverse R3 dependence for ρ. Why can’t we argue similarly and arrive at the same
inverse R3 dependence for ργ? The answer lies in the diﬀerence between the energy of a
nucleon and that of a photon. While the number density varies as inverse R3 for both cases,
the energy of a nucleon is mc2 and is independent of the scale of the universe. For photons,
the energy is hc/λ, which decreases with the increasing scale. This decrease introduces
another factor of R in the denominator.
With ργ—in terms of R—at our disposal, we can solve the Friedmann equation and
obtain the size of the universe, the density of the universe, and the Hubble parameter as
functions of time for a radiation-dominated universe. Math Note E.37.4 has all the details
and arrives at the formulas displayed in the second row of Table E.3.
The matter mass density is directly related to the matter number density, because the
two are related by a multiplicative constant (mass of the matter particle). This is not the
case with the radiation energy and number densities, as we saw above. Is there a formula
that connects the number density of photons to the temperature? Math Note E.37.5 on
page 146 of Appendix.pdf gives the answer in the aﬃrmative and also ﬁnds the average
energy of a photon as a function of the temperature. These results are:
nγ(T) = 2 × 107T 3 photons/m3,
⟨Eγ⟩= 2.7kBT = 3.726 × 10−23T J.
(37.3)
What do you know? 37.3. (a) What do you get when you multiply the two formulas
of Equation (37.3)? (b) What do you get when you divide the result by c2?
Suppose we are located at a point in the universe and we look out to see points as far
away from us as possible. Since the universe is 13.7 billion years old, any signal that we
receive from any point in the universe can be at most that old. This means that the signals
can come from within a radius of 13.7 billion light years. Therefore, we say that the horizon
is 13.7 billion light years now. A billion years ago the horizon was 12.7 billion light years;
10 billion years ago it was 3.7 billion light years, and so on.3
Starting at the big bang, we can also argue that the horizon radius one second after
the big bang was 300,000 km, two seconds after the big bang it was 600,000 km, etc.
This argument assumes that the horizon radius rh is speed of light times the time elapsed:
rh = ct. In the absence of gravity and universal expansion, this is true. But, as Math
Note E.37.6 on page 147 of Appendix.pdf shows, expansion increases the spread of horizon
further so that rh = 3ct for a matter-dominated universe, and rh = 2ct, when radiation is
dominant.
The scale of the universe grows in proportion to t2/3 when matter dominates and to
√
t
when radiation dominates. In either case, the horizon “catches up” with the universe: it
grows at a faster rate than the universe itself, and therefore, covers more and more fraction
of the universe. Example D.37.3 on page 68 of Appendix.pdf compares the fraction of
the universe covered by horizon one hour, one week, and one year after the big bang.
3As the next paragraph makes it clear, these statements are not entirely correct.

Expansion and Olbers’ Paradox
When the expansion of the universe was established, one of the mysteries of astronomy could
be explained. The mystery is this: “Why is the night sky dark?” Although the question may

sound childish, there is a deeper motivation for asking it, and no less an astronomer than
Kepler was one of the ﬁrst to recognize the signiﬁcance of the question. If the universe is
inﬁnite, homogeneous, and isotropic, then the number of stars in a spherical shell subtended
by a cone should grow in proportion to the distance squared. Figure 37.3 shows the cross
section of two spherical shells subtended by a cone centered at P, the observation point.
The bigger shell is twice as far as the smaller shell; therefore its area is four times as large.
Assuming the same thickness for both shells, the volume of the big shell is also four times
the smaller volume. Since the number density of the stars is assumed uniform, there are
four times as many stars in the larger shell than in the small one.
How do the amounts of light received by P from the two shells compare? Since there
are four times as many stars in the big shell, its light intensity is four times the intensity
of the smaller one. But intensity decreases as the square of the distance. This means that
a typical star in the big shell shines four times weaker than a typical star in the small
shell. Therefore, the overall intensity received at P from the big shell is equal to the overall
intensity from the small shell. This independence of the intensity from distance and the
assumption that the universe is inﬁnite (and therefore, that there are inﬁnitely many stars
in the universe) implies that we should be receiving inﬁnitely intense light from the sky day
and night!
What do you know? 37.4. Knowing that intensity or brightness is the amount of
power received (or emitted) per square meter, explain why the intensity of a source
decreases as inverse square of the distance.
The above paradox prompted Kepler to assume that the universe was ﬁnite. But a ﬁnite
universe, as Newton showed, was gravitationally unstable, and would collapse on itself. To
overcome these diﬃculties, Loys de Chesaux, a Swiss astronomer, attributed the darkness
of the night sky to the absorption of light by a hypothetical ﬂuid that supposedly ﬁlled
the entire universe. Almost 80 years later, in the 1820s, the German astronomer Heinrich
Olbers picked up on the same ﬂuid theory, and the entire paradox became known as the
Olbers’ paradox. But the ﬂuid theory did not solve the problem, because the absorption

stars.

microwaves and radio waves, which are not visible, rendering the sky dark.

Echo of the Big Bang
The runaway distant galaxies tell of an expanding universe, an expansion that is a whim-
pering reminder of a once colossal explosion. Galaxies are made of nucleons and other forms
of matter, and their running away tells us the story of the big bang as told by only one
component of the universe. Are there other observable remnants of the big bang coming
from the other component of the universe, radiation?
In 1964, two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, at Bell Laboratories
were using a horn antenna, built earlier for communication via the Echo satellite, to measure
the intensity of the radio waves coming from the Milky Way. The radio signals from all
astronomical objects come in as “noise,” much like the statics picked up by radios during
a thunderstorm. Distinguishing the signal noise from other spurious noises is not trivial,
although it is much easier if the source is small, such as a star. In this case, one can switch
the antenna beam back and forth between the source and the empty sky. If there is a
detectable diﬀerence, it must be due to the source. The enormous size of our galaxy makes
such a directional distinction diﬃcult. In order to observe any signal from the galaxy, the
antenna had better be as “noise free” as possible.
By a technique using liquid helium, Penzias and Wilson could reduce the expected
spurious noise considerably. They started their observation in the spring of 1964 using a

relatively short wavelength of 7.35 cm, where the radio noise from the Milky Way should
have been negligible. To their surprise, they detected a strong signal. They changed the
antenna direction; the noise was still there. It appeared that the noise was coming from
practically every direction.
To make sure that the fault was not of the antenna, they
dismantled the 20-foot horn, and discovered that some pigeons had nested in the antenna
and deposited a “white dielectric material” there! After cleaning the mess and pointing
the antenna to the sky in early 1965, they observed very little diﬀerence in the level of the
noise. The noise did not want to quit.
Puzzled by the persistent noise, Penzias contacted some colleagues, who eventually di-

rected him to Princeton University. It turned out that a group of physicists there had been
working on the formation of nuclei at the early universe. James Peebles, the theorist of the
group, had argued that the observed structure of the visible universe, indicating a compo-
sition of about 99% hydrogen and helium, was a strong evidence for an intense radiation
at the early universe. Peebles calculation revealed that during the ﬁrst few minutes of the
evolution of the universe, the nuclear processes would take place at such a rapid pace that a
large fraction of the nucleons would “cook” into the nuclei of heavy elements. The present
absence of such elements must be the result of a mechanism that prevented their formation.
The only candidate for such a prevention is a very dense and hot background radiation.
Peebles estimated the present temperature of this radiation to be around 10 K.
In a subsequent meeting, the Princeton group and Penzias and Wilson decided to publish
a pair of companion letters in the Astrophysical Journal, in which Penzias and Wilson
would announce their observation, and the Princeton group would explain the cosmological
implications. The radiation has come to be known as the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation. It is the same black body radiation that was discussed in Section 37.3.
Penzias and Wilson could detect only a small portion of the curve characteristic of a
black body radiator. As it reaches the Earth surface, CMB loses most of its content to the

atmosphere. Nevertheless, Penzias and Wilson could determine the temperature of CMB
from that small portion. To see the entire spectrum, and to determine the temperature
more accurately, the antenna has to be lifted above the Earth’s atmosphere. And that is
where the COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) comes in.
After the discovery of Penzias and Wilson, and the realization of the limitation of their
observation, physicists started to plan ways of getting their instruments above the atmo-
sphere. The obvious choice was a satellite, and by 1974 three groups of physicists from
east and west coasts submitted proposals to NASA. As the project was complicated and
NASA experienced the Challenger disaster in 1986, the COBE satellite was not launched
until November 18, 1989.
Less than two months after its launch, COBE had faithfully sent enough information

that the investigators could construct the shape of the radiation curve. Was the curve a
black body radiation curve as predicted by the big bang theory? In the winter meeting of
the American Astronomical Society, held outside Washington DC, on January 13, 1990, one
of the principal investigators put up on the screen an image of the plotted data points as
well as a theoretical black body radiation curve of the type introduced in Equation (20.5).
An eerie silence fell over the audience, which immediately turned into a frenzied applause
and a standing ovation. The data points fell exactly on the theoretical curve! The CMB
was a black-body radiator, and its temperature was 2.725±0.001 K. Figure 37.4 shows this
historically signiﬁcant plot.
If you have been following the math notes, you have no doubt noticed that many of
the formulas derived so far are dependent on the temperature alone. With COBE’s precise
measurement of the present temperature of the CMB radiation, we can determine the
present numerical value of many quantities. Let’s start with number densities. Substitute
2.725 for T in Equation (37.3) to obtain 4×108 photons/m3 for photon number density. On
the other hand, the present nucleon number density is about 0.25 per cubic meter. Thus,
there are 4 × 108/0.25 or about 1.6 billion photons for every nucleon. Radiation clearly
outnumbers matter. However, superiority is not measured by numbers; it is the density
that counts.
The present universe is
matter-dominated.
With 0.25 nucleons per cubic meter and 1.67 × 10−27 kg as the mass of a nucleon, the

578
Chapter 37
Physics of the Cosmos
present density ρb0 of baryonic matter is found to be 4.18 × 10−28 kg/m3. The present
radiation density is obtained from the fourth row of Table E.3, which yields ργ0 = 4.61 ×
10−31 kg/m3. We see that the present ρb is almost 1000 times larger than the present ργ,
verifying our earlier assertion that the present universe is matter-dominated. Moreover,
matter is not just baryonic. In fact, as already mentioned, it is mostly dark. If we include
the dark matter, the density jumps to about 2.5 × 10−27 kg/m3, and the ratio ρm0/ργ0
jumps to about 5400. The universe is deﬁnitely matter-dominated.
But has it always been that way? To answer this and other related questions, we need
to know how to express ρm as a function of temperature. Math Note E.37.7 on page
147 of Appendix.pdf derives an approximate formula, which we reproduce here:
ρm(T) = 1.24 × 10−28T 3 kg/m3.
(37.4)
The earlier epochs of the universe witnessed a faster rise in radiation density than in
matter density: ργ increases as the fourth power of T while ρm does so as the third power. In

fact, you can easily ﬁnd the temperature at which the two become equal: just equate (37.4)
and the fourth row of Table E.3 and solve for T. This procedure yields Teq = 14, 800 K,
where the subscript is a reminder of the equality of densities.
When the universe was
hotter than about 14,800 K, it was radiation-dominated. As it cooled down below this
temperature, it became matter-dominated.
An interesting question is “How long was the universe dominated by radiation?” Since
14,800 K is the transition from radiation to matter dominance, the question can be rephrased
as “How long after the big bang did the universe cool down to 14,800 K?” With T = 14, 800,
the second equation of the second row of Table E.3 gives t = 1.05 × 1012 s, or about 33,000
years. However, this is not quite right, because the calculation ignores the neutrinos which

also contribute to the density. It turns out [see Section 38.1, especially Equation (38.1)]
that neutrinos increase the density by a factor of 1.681 and reduce the time by
√
1.681. So,
instead of 33,000 years, we get 33000/
√
1.681, or 25,500 years. Thus, for over 25 millennia
(a tiny fraction of its age), the universe was dominated by radiation. However, those “few”
years were crucial in determining the fate of the universe as we shall see in the next chapter.
Now we can explain where the numbers used in Example D.37.3 came from. Example
D.37.4 on page 68 of Appendix.pdf provides the details.
Another interesting question is “When did the CMB radiation separate from the mat-
ter?” As long as the universe had positive ions and negative electrons, i.e., as long as it was
a plasma, photons could not escape. Only after the atoms formed, did the radiation decou-

ple from matter. And for atoms to form, the universe must be so cool that the photons lack
enough energy to ionize them. As an example, take the hydrogen atom, which is mostly
found in its ground state, i.e., what we called the n = 1 electron orbit in Section 21.3. The
energy associated with this state is −13.6 eV, and a photon with an energy of 13.6 eV or
more can kick the electron out of the atom, that is, ionize it. What is the temperature at
which the photons have this kind of energy?
Equation (37.3) gives the average energy of a photon as a function of temperature. For
this energy to be 13.6 eV= 2.18 × 10−18 J, the temperature of the photon “gas” has to
be 58,500 K. This is, however, a huge overestimation, because when the average energy
is 13.6 eV, there are a lot of photons (too many for our purpose) that have much higher
energies. Considering the fact that photons outnumber the hydrogen atoms by a factor of
1.6 billion, it is possible to have enough photons of 13.6 eV or higher energy to ionize the
atoms at a much lower temperature. Math Note E.37.5, using a little calculus, shows that
at about 5900 K, 1/(1.6×109) = 6×10−10 of the photon population has energies of 13.6 eV
or higher; i.e., for each H-atom there is a photon that has an energy of at least 13.6 eV.
Therefore, a black body radiator at 5900 K has suﬃcient number of photons at high enough
energy to ionize the available atoms, although the average energy of its photons—by the
second equation of (37.3)—is only 1.4 eV.

The consideration above is not the only argument reducing the overestimated ionization
temperature. Other factors, such as the probability of a photon interacting with the electron
of the hydrogen atom (the so-called scattering cross section) reduce the temperature to
about 3000 K, called the decoupling temperature and denoted by Tdec.
With this
temperature, we can now ﬁnd the age of the universe when radiation separated from matter.
Since Tdec is smaller than Teq found above, the decoupling occurred after matter dominated
the universe. Using the third row of Table E.3, we ﬁrst ﬁnd the ratio of the scales: R(t)/R0 =
2.725/3000, which is 0.00091; then use the ﬁrst row to get t/t0 = 0.000913/2 = 2.74 × 10−5,

so that t = 2.74 × 10−5t0 or t = 375000 years, assuming that t0 = 13.7 billion years. This
time is denoted by tdec and is called the decoupling time.

Answers to “What do you know?”
37.1. Larger ρ is achieved at earlier times, and at earlier times, the force of the big bang
explosion overcomes the gravitational attraction.
37.2. Yes! Look at the balloon analogy: When the radius of a (spherical) balloon doubles,
the distance between points on the surface of the balloon also doubles.
37.3.
(a) When you multiply the number of photons per cubic meter by the (average)
energy of each photon, you get the amount of energy the collection has per cubic meter,
i.e., the energy density. (b) When you divide energy by c2, you get the equivalent mass. In
this case, you get the equivalent mass density ργ.
37.4. Consider two spheres centered at the source, one having a radius twice as big as the
other. They both receive the same amount of power (the total power of the source) on their
entire surface area. Since area goes as radius square, the bigger sphere has four times as
much area as the smaller one. Therefore, the amount of power it receives per square meter
(the intensity) is one fourth the power received by each square meter of the smaller surface.
Thus, increasing the distance by a factor of two reduces the intensity by a factor of four.
37.5. The earliest time would be when the background radiation was no longer trapped in
the plasma of positive and negative charges, i.e., when atoms started to form 375,000 years
after the big bang. No electromagnetic information about the universe is available less than
375,000 years after the big bang.

Chapter38
Early Universe
The last chapter studied a universe consisting of matter and radiation, with matter domi-
nating the universe (but radiation outnumbering matter particles) at the present time, and
for almost the entire history of the universe, except for the ﬁrst few dozen millennia when
radiation ruled the universe. What about the earlier times? Did photons outnumber the
nucleons by the same factor of 1.6 billion? Did the short era of radiation dominance start
with the big bang, or was there a period in the early universe when matter’s importance
equated or surpassed radiation? These are important questions, because as we have seen,
the content of the universe determines its fate. The following example sets the stage for the
story of our very young universe.
Example 38.0.1. The average energy of a photon increases proportionately to the tempera-
ture. As there is no upper limit to how hot the universe was at the very beginning, it is possible
that the early photons were so energetic as to be able to create fundamental particles and their
corresponding antiparticles. For instance, quantum electrodynamics allows the possibility of the
creation of an electron-positron pair through the collision of two photons. The Feynman diagram
in Figure 32.4(d)—reproduced in Figure 38.1 for convenience—describes precisely this process.
Not any two photons can create an e+-e−pair. The conservation of energy requires that the
initial photon pair have a total energy at least equal to the rest energy of the e+-e−pair; or that
each photon have energy at least equal to the rest energy of an electron. Putting 9.1×10−31 kg for
the mass of an electron and 3 × 188 m/s for the speed of light in E = mc2, we obtain 8.2 × 10−14 J
as the required energy of each photon. Equating this to the average energy of a photon, given in
Equation (37.3), yields a temperature of 2.2 × 109 K.
We shall see later that, at temperatures well above 2.2 billion K, the electrons and positrons
move close to the speed of light, and therefore, behave much like photons. Other particles (and their
antiparticles) may also be present at higher temperatures; and if the temperature of the universe is
high enough, all these particles move close to light speed. So there is not much diﬀerence between
radiation and matter, and the radiation formulas apply to all components of the universe.
In
particular, to ﬁnd the approximate age of the universe at this temperature, you can use the second
row of Table E.3. However, the contributions of diﬀerent constituents to the density of the universe
diﬀer slightly from the photon contribution. The next section is devoted to this topic.

38.1
Content of the Early Universe
The example above showed that a black body radiator, the average energy of whose photons
is equal to the rest energy of an electron can create electron positron pairs. The minimum
temperature of such a radiator is 2.2 billion K, and is called the threshold temperature
for electrons. The e+-e−pairs so created have a tendency to annihilate each other back

into two photons. Thus the two processes of creation and annihilation are in equilibrium:

Chapter 38

e+ + e−↔γ + γ.
At temperatures above 2.2 billion K the equilibrium exists; below
that temperature, only annihilation takes place because now the photons are too “cold” to
produce e+-e−pairs.
Other particle-antiparticle pairs have their own threshold temperatures. For example,
protons, with a mass 1836 times larger than the electron mass, have a threshold temper-
ature of 4 trillion K. Lighter particles such as muons, pions, kaons, etc., have threshold
temperatures lying between 2.2 billion and 4 trillion K. Heavier particles such as neutrons,
tauons, W ±, Z0, the Λ’s, the Σ’s, etc. have threshold temperatures larger than 4 trillion K.
Thus, as we get closer and closer to the moment of the big bang, crossing the threshold
temperatures of various particles, the content of the universe becomes more and more diver-
siﬁed. This scenario gives a very complicated picture of the early universe, while, in reality,
the early universe was relatively simple, for the following reason.
What do you know? 38.1. W ± and Z0 are, respectively, 156,750 and 178,470 times
heavier than an electron. What are the threshold temperatures of W ± and Z0?
Although there is a large number of diﬀerent kinds of particles (and their antiparticles) in

the early universe, because of the tremendous heat present, all particles are relativistic; that
is, their rest energy (mc2) is negligible compared to their kinetic energy. Therefore, their
masses could be ignored: they become massless, just like photons (see Section 28.3.3). And
the universe can be treated as a hot gas of diﬀerent kinds of “photons.” The contribution
of these diﬀerent massless particles to the density of the universe is distinguished by the
product of three numerical factors which depend, respectively, on the number of orientations
(projections) of the spin of the particle, on whether the particle has an antiparticle or not,
and on whether the particle is a boson or a fermion.
The factors above stem from the calculation of the contribution of diﬀerent species of
particles to the total energy density. For example, since there are two spin states (up and
down) for a spin- 1
2 particle, one has to introduce a factor of two, one for spin up and the
other for spin down. Similarly, if the particle has an antiparticle, then the two contribute
equally to the energy density, and one has to introduce another factor of two. In general,
for a massive particle of spin s, the ﬁrst factor mentioned in the last paragraph is 2s + 1;
for a massless particle it is 2 (see Box 33.1.1). The second factor is 1 if the particle does not
have a distinct antiparticle, and 2 if it does. These plus the last factor, which is 1 for bosons
and 7/8 for fermions—and is harder to derive—are explained in some detail in Math Note
E.38.1 on page 148 of Appendix.pdf .
Thus the recipe for writing down the expression for the density of the universe is to add
all the densities of the diﬀerent (relativistic) particles in thermal equilibrium, which, except
for the numerical factors above, are identical to the photon density given in Equation (37.2).
For example, to ﬁnd the density ρe of the electron species, multiply ργ by 7
8 because electron
is a fermion, and also by 2 because electron has an antiparticle. The factor of 2 for the spin
of the electron is already included in ργ, because photon also has two spin orientations.

What do you know? 38.2. What is the density of the electrons in the universe when
its temperature T is well above 2.2 billion K?
Later, we will be interested in the relation between the temperature of the universe and
the time elapsed since the big bang. This relation is given in the second row of Table E.3
for a photon gas. To ﬁnd the same relation for a gas consisting of a variety of “photon”
species, we need to replace ργ with the total density ρ = ργ + ρe + ρν + . . ., where ργ is
the photon density, ρe the electron density, ρν the neutrino density, etc. Since all of these
densities are multiples of ργ, the total density ρ is also a multiple of ργ. Call this multiple
α, so that ρ = αργ. Then the middle equation of the second row of Table E.3 in Appendix
E will have a √α in the denominator:

use this and the current temperature of the universe in Equation (38.1), which gives
the time elapsed since the big bang? Why is the answer so wrong?
38.2
The Genesis as Told by Physics
The history of the early universe cannot be told chronologically. The reason is that events
proceed with extraordinary speed at the beginning. The number of things that happen in
the ﬁrst second may be far more than what happens in the next second. Our analysis so far
has shown that the important parameter is the temperature T, as it determines the content
of the universe, and therefore, the processes that take place in it.
It is convenient to divide the course of the development of the universe into epochs,
each epoch speciﬁed by a range of values of the temperature. Starting with a very simple
and symmetric universe, you will see how the laws of physics developed in the previous
parts can predict the content of each epoch, and ultimately of the present universe. It is
remarkable that the predictions of these laws so closely match the data collected in numerous
observations of the universe.
38.2.1
The First Epoch 1014 < T < ∞
The present laws of physics cannot explain how the big bang occurred. Such an explanation
requires a quantum theory of gravity, which as of this writing, is lacking. Ultimately, such
a theory combines the general theory of relativity—which works so well in the large scale
structures—with the quantum theory, which is the theory of the microscopic phenomena. So
we don’t know what happened at the start of the ﬁrst epoch, but it is reasonable to assume
that sometime during this epoch, the universe consisted of all the known fundamental
particles and gauge bosons. In fact, let’s assume complete symmetry among all particles
and their antiparticles, and let physics explain the ensuing asymmetry, i.e., the presence of
matter and the absence of antimatter.
What do you know?
38.4. Why is it reasonable to assume complete symmetry
between matter and antimatter at the beginning of the creation?

Figure 38.2: (a) Creation of pure matter. (b) Creation of pure antimatter.
Consider a very hot universe consisting of six quarks and six antiquarks, six leptons and
six antileptons, and all the gauge bosons. All particles are assumed to populate the universe
in equal numbers. At the beginning of the ﬁrst epoch, when the temperature is suﬃciently
high, every process takes place in both directions. For example, if a particle annihilates its
antiparticle to produce two photons, two (other) photons collide and produce the original
particle antiparticle pair.
As the universe expands and cools down, certain processes, whose threshold tempera-
tures lie above the prevailing temperature, take place only in one direction. For example,
W ± annihilate each other completely once the universe cools down below their threshold
temperature of about 4 × 1014. This kind of annihilation raises the question: If all parti-
cles are accompanied by exactly the same number of their antiparticles, why did they not
annihilate each other completely? After all, our existence indicates that matter survived!
The matter-antimatter asymmetry is a phenomenon for which we don’t have a complete
explanation. However, there is a strong experimental evidence for the asymmetry, and the
CP violation is the same
as matter-antimatter
asymmetry.
grand uniﬁed theories give a reasonable theoretical argument in favor of the phenomenon.
The experimental evidence, known as the CP violation, was discovered in 1964 by James
Cronin and Val Fitch, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1980 for this discovery. The
“C” stands for charge conjugation and “P” for parity. These are abstract mathematical
symmetry operations performed on ﬁelds: charge conjugation changes the sign of the charge
of the particle associated with the ﬁeld and parity reﬂects the position of the particle about
the origin.
To see how the grand uniﬁed theories (GUTs) can explain the absence of antimatter
in the present universe, consider the decay of the X particle and its antiparticle shown in
Figure 38.2. Recall from Section 34.5 that the X gauge boson of the grand uniﬁed theories

asymmetry.
attaches to two quarks or a quark and a lepton (see Figure 34.9). This allows the possibility
of the decay of X into two up quarks and its antiparticle1 X into a down quark and an
electron [Figure 38.2(a)]. This may give the impression that we have created pure matter
(u, u, d, e−) out of an equal amount of matter and antimatter (XX).
But that is not
true, because for every pair of processes depicted in Figure 38.2(a), there is a pair depicted
in Figure 38.2(b), which creates pure antimatter out of an equal amount of matter and
antimatter. Thus the decay of an (XX)-pair by itself cannot create pure matter.
However, the existence of the CP violation can produce pure matter out of an equal
amount of matter and antimatter. Suppose that—due to the CP violation—the processes
of Figure 38.2(a) take place slightly more frequently than those in Figure 38.2(b).
For
example, assume that for every billion occurrences of Figure 38.2(b), there are a billion and
one occurrences of Figure 38.2(a). Then matter particles outnumber the antiparticles by
1We are labeling the X with a positive charge as particle and the one with the negative charge as
antiparticle.

one part in a billion. Thus GUTs plus the CP violation can explain the matter-antimatter
abundance asymmetry. Although the universe is created with equal number of particles
and antiparticles, by the end of the ﬁrst epoch particles slightly outnumber antiparticles.
38.2.2
The Second Epoch 1012 K < T < 1014 K
The second epoch starts a few nanoseconds after the big bang (see Example D.38.1 on
page 69 of Appendix.pdf ). The universe consists of all the leptons and antileptons, ﬁve
quarks and their antiquarks, eight gluons and the photons. All the very heavy particles,
such as the weak bosons and the top quark, have disappeared because 1014 K is below their
threshold temperature. At the start of the epoch, all particles come in equal abundance,
but the heavier particles and their antiparticles start to annihilate, so that by the end of
the epoch only the lighter particles survive.
Food for Thought
FFT 38.2.1. As we have seen in the last chapter, and will see in the present one, physics can
explain fairly accurately the course of the development of the universe starting only a moment after
the big bang, and many observations testify to that explanation. At the present time, however,
physics cannot explain the act of creation itself. That is why we had to start a few nanoseconds
after the big bang. This is still a remarkable achievement for science; but some pseudoscientists
argue (and many people buy the argument) that since physics cannot explain the act of creation,
their particular story of creation is the story.
The realm of the unknown is continuously diminished by the advancement of science, but it
will never be completely annihilated. There was a time when the appearance of a comet in the
sky was a sign of the “wrath of God.” Now that Newtonian physics can explain the motion (and
predict the appearance) of all known objects in the solar system, no one panics when Halley’s
comet visits us every 76 years.2
There was a time when the synthesis of organic material was
considered interfering with the act of God, but now the production of synthetic substances is a
routine laboratory procedure.
Now, there are people, including scholars, who think that the use of embryonic stem cells
in research is committing murder; who insist on including the “intelligent design” hypothesis in
school curricula as an alternative to evolution; who question the very notion of objectivity of
science because they disapprove of its historical and cultural development.
All this makes the
science awareness of the public more necessary, and the task of the science educators more urgent.
Due to the small scale of the universe, the quarks are so close to each other at the
beginning of the second epoch that they do not feel any strong force.3
The quarks are
the “free” roamers of the universe. But as the universe expands, the interquark distance

increases and the quarks begin to feel the strong force of gluon exchanges and bag themselves
and the gluons inside hadrons. Example D.38.7 on page 72 of Appendix.pdf gives a very
crude estimate of the quark conﬁnement temperature.
What do you know? 38.5. Given that αq = 1.75, (a) what was the quark density
ρq at the end of the second epoch? (b) What was the quark energy density in eV/m3
then? (c) If the average energy of each quark was 10 MeV, what was the quark number
density then? (d) What was the volume (of the cube) occupied by each quark? (e) On
the average, how far apart were the quarks from each other? (f) How does this compare
with the size of a nucleon, 10−15 m?
2However, there are people who think that their souls can ride to heaven with a hitherto-unknown comet
if they commit suicide when it journeys through the sky.
3Recall from Section 34.3.2 that the strong force between two quarks increases with increasing distance.

38.2.3
The Third Epoch 1010 K < T < 1012 K
The universe is about a tenth of a millisecond old now and consists almost entirely of
electrons, muons, neutrinos and their antiparticles, and, of course, photons.
Hadrons,
which are heavier and which were formed out of quarks in the second epoch, have started
annihilating their antiparticles, and will complete this annihilation soon after the start of the
third epoch. A small number (small compared to the number of the other constituents) of
protons and neutrons—the minute “extra” matter particles produced in the ﬁrst epoch—are
immersed in the sea of other particles.
In the middle of this epoch, when the temperature is 1011 K, the muons disappear (µ+
and µ−annihilate each other), and the only survivors will be electrons, positrons, neutrinos
and antineutrinos, the photons, and a small “contamination” of protons and neutrons.
The small “extra” number of muons (created in the ﬁrst epoch due to matter-antimatter
asymmetry) decay very rapidly due to their very short half-life.
The density of the universe after µ+-µ−annihilation is approximately 4.5×1012 kg/m3,
as shown in Example D.38.2 on page 69 of Appendix.pdf . This is so large (a grain of
sand made of this material would weigh several tons!) that even neutrinos, which can easily
pass through layers of lead that are light years thick, are trapped.
Reactions such as p + e−↔n + ν and n + e+ ↔p + ¯ν keep the number of protons
and neutrons equal. Here is why. Suppose there are twice as many protons as neutrons.
Then—as there is no shortage of the electrons, positrons, and neutrinos—it is twice as likely
for the ﬁrst reaction to go from left to right (than right to left) and the second reaction to
Equality of proton and
neutron populations at
the beginning of the
third epoch.
go from right to left (than left to right), causing more protons to turn into neutrons than
vice versa. Ultimately, the numbers become equal. Therefore, the third epoch starts with
equal population of protons and neutrons.
However, as the end of the third epoch approaches, the p-n conversion becomes asym-
metric: Because n is heavier than p, more neutrons convert to protons than vice versa.
Example D.38.3 on page 70 of Appendix.pdf gives another reason for the smaller abun-
dance of neutrons. There is also the decay of neutron into proton [what is responsible for
beta decay in nuclei as discussed in Sections 31.2.1 and 34.4 and Figure 34.8(d)]. However,
this decay is too slow to have any eﬀect on the p-n imbalance, at least in the present epoch.
By the end of the third epoch, the protons outnumber the neutrons by a factor of three,
i.e., out of all the nucleons, 25% are neutrons and 75% protons.
38.2.4
The Fourth Epoch 109 K < T < 1010 K
About a second has passed since the big bang. The universe is still composed of electrons,
positrons, three kinds of neutrino, photons, and a small “contamination” of protons and
neutrons. The density has fallen down to the point that the neutrinos are no longer trapped.
They decouple from the rest of the universe.
What do you know? 38.6. For the constituents of the universe at the beginning of
the fourth epoch, α = 5.375. Using Equation (38.1), can you estimate the age of the
universe at the beginning of the fourth epoch?
A little after the neutrino decoupling, at a temperature of about 2.2×109 K, the electrons
and positrons annihilate each other, and the energy released as a result of the annihilation
heats up the photons, making the photon gas slightly hotter than the decoupled neutrino
gas. Math Note E.38.2 on page 148 of Appendix.pdf shows that the ratio of the photon
temperature Tγ to the neutrino temperature Tν is

4 . The end of this epoch coincides
with the end of the antimatter era. From now on, the matter of the universe is the “con-
tamination” of protons and neutrons formed in the second and third epochs out of quarks,

and the “contamination” of electrons (which were produced in the ﬁrst epoch along with
the extra u and d quarks that later formed the protons and neutrons) that survived the
e+-e−annihilation in the present epoch.
What do you know? 38.7. How long after the big bang did antimatter completely
disappear from the universe?
Hint: Right after electron-positron annihilation, α =
1.681.
Since the electric charge is strictly conserved, and no physical process can create a
positive charge without an equal negative charge, the number of electrons equals the number

of protons, and this equality will hold for eternity. Any process that changes the number
of protons will also change the number of electrons by the same amount. One such process
is the neutron decay, which becomes more important as the age of the universe becomes
comparable to the half life of a neutron, 614 seconds.
38.2.5
The Fifth Epoch 108 K < T < 109 K
The dominant constituents of the universe are now photons and the neutrinos. The universe
is about three minutes old (see Example D.38.4 on page 70 of Appendix.pdf ), and the
time span is long enough that neutron decays play a signiﬁcant role in the abundance of
p and n. In fact, Example D.38.5 on page 71 of Appendix.pdf shows that during this
time, about 20% of the neutrons turn into protons via beta decay. The nuclear particles
now consist of approximately 87% protons and 13% neutrons.
Shortly after the start of this epoch, 3 minutes and 16 seconds after the big bang,
something remarkable happens. Every couple of neutrons pair up with a couple of protons
and form a helium nucleus. This means that 26% of the nucleons end up inside the helium
nuclei, with free protons constituting the remaining 74%. Since nucleons have almost equal
masses, the mass of all nuclear matter in the universe is now 26% helium nucleus and 74%
proton.
The formation of helium nuclei, although quick, is not an instantaneous process. There
Helium nuclei are
formed 3 minutes and
16 seconds after the big
bang.
are intermediate steps that need to be taken before helium can be created. First a proton
and a neutron must fuse together to form a deuteron: p + n →D + γ. Then two deuterons
fuse into a helium nucleus D + D →4He+γ. Helium is a very tightly bound nucleus; once
formed it is very hard to break it apart. Even though the protons and neutrons had a lot
of opportunity to fuse at earlier times, they did not form helium. Why? The answer is the
deuteron bottleneck.
In order to make helium, ﬁrst we must make deuterons. And while 4He is very tightly
bound, deuteron is not. It takes only 2.224 MeV to break up the deuteron into a proton and a
neutron.4 At earlier times, although deuterons were formed, they were immediately broken
apart by the energetic photons, i.e., deuteron production went both ways: p + n ↔D + γ.
What exactly is the temperature at which deuterons are made and not broken apart?
What is the threshold temperature for D-formation? Math Note E.38.3 on page 149 of
Appendix.pdf shows that it is 950 million Kelvin, which is just under the initial temperature
of this epoch.
What do you know? 38.8. If you assume that the average energy of the photons
in the early universe is 2.224 MeV, the binding energy of a deuterium, what kind of
temperature would you get? Is that anywhere near the temperature you expect?
4This is about a third the energy needed to pull a single nucleon out of 4He.

590
Chapter 38
Early Universe
Because 4He is so tightly bound, it is energetically a more favorable ﬁnal product than
other multinucleon elements, which are also formed, though in much smaller quantities. For
example, some deuterons may survive; or a proton can fuse with a deuteron to form 3He;
or a D can fuse with a 4He to form a lithium. Although these other elements do form at
the temperature of 950 million Kelvin, most of them disintegrate immediately, because of
their small binding energies, leaving only a minute trace behind.
The formation of 4He via the deuteron bottleneck—as predicted by the laws govern-
ing nuclear interactions—points to two important cosmological predictions. First, that a
universal radiation must exist to prevent the formation of deuterons at earlier times, and
second, that the ratio of the hydrogen mass abundance to helium mass abundance in the
universe should be 74% to 26%. If radiation did not exist, neutrons and protons would form
He as soon as the temperature fell to the point that the average KE of the particle content
of the universe (nucleons and electrons) was not suﬃcient to—through violent collisions—
break apart the deuteron that was being formed. This would change the H-He abundance
ratio. Example D.38.6 on page 71 of Appendix.pdf estimates this ratio to 60%-40%, in
complete violation of observation!
38.2.6
The Sixth Epoch 15,000 K < T < 108 K
Approximately 4 hours and 56 minutes have passed since the big bang. Ignoring the neutri-
nos, which have their separate existence, the 4He nuclei, protons, and electrons are immersed
in a sea of photons. For every nucleon, there are 1.6 billion photons, and this ratio persists
for the rest of the life of the universe. The temperature of radiation (and matter, which
is in thermal equilibrium with it) is
3p
11/4 = 1.401 that of neutrino, and this ratio will
also persist forever. An analysis similar to Example D.38.4 shows that ργ = 0.836 kg/m3,
ρν = 0.57 kg/m3, and ρm = 0.000028
kg/m3. Thus, the universe is still dominated by
radiation and neutrinos, however matter has gained some grounds in the competition for
dominance: while radiation was 300,000 times more dense than matter at the beginning of
the ﬁfth epoch, it is only 30,000 more dense now.
Not much will happen during the sixth epoch. The universe keeps expanding, the wave-
length of the photons and neutrinos keep stretching, and because of the interaction between
the photons and the charged particles of the universe (the protons and the electrons), elec-
tromagnetic radiation is trapped until the end of this epoch.
38.2.7
The Seventh Epoch 3000 K < T < 15,000 K
Twenty-ﬁve millennia have passed since the big bang. The radiation and neutrinos have
cooled down to the point that matter is beginning to be the dominant contributor to the
density.5 And for another 300-400 millennia nothing of interest occurs. The photons’ and
neutrinos’ wavelengths keep increasing, and the photons are trapped in the plasma of the
positive ions (the helium nuclei and protons), and the negative electrons.
However, at the end of the seventh epoch, about 400 millennia after the big bang, the
photons reach a temperature that is no longer suﬃcient to ionize the helium and hydrogen
atoms that kept being formed all along. The bound electrons and ions can no longer interact
with the photons, and the latter are decoupled from matter, roaming the universe unnoticed
until 1964, when it is picked up by the horn-shaped antennas of two radio astronomers on
Earth. The helium and hydrogen gas mixture is now ready to form stars, galaxies, and
other structures.
5The baryonic matter (protons and neutrons) is not as dense as radiation at the temperature of 15,000 K.
Only if you include the dark matter—which must creep up in the universe at some stage—does matter
become dominant.

Answers to “What do you know?”
38.1.
Example 38.0.1 shows that the threshold temperature of a particle is proportional
to its mass. Since the mass of W ± is 156,750 times the mass of the electron, the threshold
temperature of W ± is 156,750 times the threshold temperature of the electron, which is
2.2 billion Kelvin. This gives 156,750 × 2.2 billion K or 3.45 × 1014 K as the threshold
temperature of W ±. Similarly, the threshold temperature of Z0 is 3.93 × 1014 K.
38.2.
For electron, the constant multiplying ργ is αe = (7/8) × 2 = 1.75. Therefore,
ρe = 1.46 × 10−32T 4 kg/m3.
38.3. With T = 2.725 K and αe = 1.75, Equation (38.1) yields t = 2.4×1019 s. Since there
are 3.15 × 107 seconds in a year, t would be 758 billion years, instead of 13.7 billion years!
The answer is wrong because Equation (38.1) assumes a radiation dominated universe, a
dominance which stopped after a mere 15000 years after the big bang.
38.4.
In many respects matter and antimatter are very similar. For example, the most
important property that distinguishes one particle from the rest, i.e., its mass is the same
for a particle and its antiparticle. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that at creation,
preference of any sort was given to either matter or antimatter.
38.5.
(a) ρq = 1.75ργ, and with ργ given by Equation (37.2) and T = 1012, we get
ρq = 1.46 × 1016 kg/m3. (b) To get the energy density, multiply result of (a) by c2. This
yields 1.32 × 1033 J/m3. Converting this to eV gives 8.23 × 1051 eV/m3. (c) The number
density nq is just the energy density divided by the average density of each quark, which is
107 eV. So, nq = 8.23 × 1044 quarks/m3. (d) If each cubic meter is shared by 8.23 × 1044
quarks, then the volume occupied by each quark is 1/8.23×1044 or 1.22×10−45 m3. (e) For
this volume, the side of the cube should be
3√
1.22 × 10−45 or 1.07×10−15 m. (f) Extremely
well!
38.6. With T = 1010 K and α = 5.375, Equation (38.1) gives t = 0.99 s.
38.7. With T = 2.2×9 K and α = 1.681, Equation (38.1) gives t = 36.65 s.
38.8. The average energy of photons is related to the temperature by the second formula in
Equation (37.3). Convert the binding energy of the deuteron to Joules to get 3.56×10−13 J.
Then the second formula in Equation (37.3) yields a temperature of 9.55 billion K, which
is over a hundred times larger than the expected temperature. The reason is that when
the average energy is 2.224 MeV, there are a lot of photons that have energies much higher
than this.
We don’t need this many photons to ignite the reaction.
Furthermore, the
photons outnumber the nucleons by a ratio of 1.6 billion to 1, which introduces another
overestimating factor. Math Note E.38.3 provides the technical reasoning for getting 950
million K as the desired temperature.

Chapter39
The Last Epoch
A few hundred thousand years after the big bang, when the universe is about a thousandth
of its present size, and the radiation—which kept the electrons away from the helium nuclei
and protons—has receded into the emptiness of space, atoms are formed. These atoms will

be the ingredients of all structures that take shape later. Matter, which has long fought for a
universal dominance, is now completely in control. Radiation and neutrinos have very little
say in the fate of the universe from now on. And the electromagnetic interaction, which
trapped the radiation in a soup of negative electrons and positive ions, is itself trapped
inside the atoms; and the stronger nuclear force is even more tightly imprisoned inside the
nuclei of the helium atoms. All forces have given way to gravity, which now commands the
universe.

Cosmic Structure Formation
In the global smoothness of the hydrogen-helium gas, here and there, a spot became slightly
denser than its surrounding. The slightly larger gravitational force of this spot attracted

the nearby atoms, becoming even denser and heavier. The atoms in the proximity felt even
a stronger gravitational attraction, and rushing to the site, made the spot even larger. This
snowball eﬀect continued at a faster and faster rate until a huge blob of H and He atoms was
formed. If the universal gas consisted of around 74% hydrogen and 26% helium, then this
blob, as well as the structures that followed from it, such as stars, galaxies, and globular
clusters, should also have the same abundance ratio. And they indeed do!
39.1.1
Jeans Mass
The accretion of atoms towards the middle of the blob creates an outward pressure that
resists the rush to the center. If the clumping is to take place, there must exist suﬃcient
amount of helium and hydrogen, whose gravitational attraction can overcome the pres-
sure resistance. Therefore, there must be a minimum mass at which the clumping begins.
This mass is denoted by mJ and is called the Jeans mass—after Sir James Jeans who
calculated it in 1902 for the conditions under which stars are formed—and is given by
MJ = (p/G)3/2/ρ2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, p is the pressure, and
ρ the density of the gas.
Radiation decoupling
was important for the
formation of structure in
the universe.
For gravitational clumping to occur, the mass of the blob must be larger than the Jeans
mass; and if the Jeans mass is too large, the clumping will be very unlikely, because a
gigantically massive blob is not a common occurrence in the universe. Example D.39.1

596
Chapter 39
The Last Epoch
on page 72 of Appendix.pdf shows how important the decoupling of radiation was for the
formation of structures.
What do you know? 39.1. Except for a numerical factor, pressure is just the energy
density. (Can you show this?) Compare the pressure before radiation decoupling, when
the radiation pressure dominated, to the pressure after decoupling, when the matter
pressure dominated (in the form of an ideal gas). For matter pressure, multiply its
number density by the average KE (17.1). To ﬁnd the number density, divide Equation
(37.4) by the mass of a nucleon, 1.67 × 10−27 kg.
39.1.2
Wrinkles in Spacetime
We learned in Example D.39.1 that matter clumps only after radiation decoupling, about
350,000 years after the big bang. But in order for the clumping to begin, some parts of
the universe must ﬁrst become denser than their surroundings, providing the “seeds” of
the cosmic structures we see today such as galaxies. Putting aside the question of how this
could have happened (after all the universe was supposedly homogeneous and isotropic, and
any variation in density would violate that), we can ask if there is any direct evidence for
this variation.
If the seeds were present 350,000 years after the big bang, then they may have been
present even earlier, before the radiation decoupling. Any variation in the density accom-
panies a variation in temperature: the denser spots are hotter than their surroundings in
proportion to their density. The radiation, being in contact with matter, would also be
hotter at some spots and colder at others. And when radiation decoupled from matter,
it should have carried this variation with it. However, COBE’s measurement of the back-
ground radiation (CMB) showed an almost perfect agreement with a black body radiation
curve of temperature 2.725 K, with little room for variation. That was in January 1990,
when the full capacity of COBE was yet to be used.
Looking at a full Moon you see a perfect circle with a perfect contour. Look through a
pair of binoculars, and you will detect some small raggedness on the contour of the Moon.
Use a powerful telescope, and you will discover mountains and valleys spreading all over
the Moon. In January 1990 COBE saw the CMB through its “binoculars.” It took another
two years to get its powerful “telescope” ready. What mankind saw on April 23, 1992 was
nothing less than the universal genesis. On this day, in a meeting of the American Physical
Society, the lead investigator of the COBE team presented to the audience the image shown
in Figure 39.1.
The “blobs” in Figure 39.1 are variations in the temperature of the CMB as small as
0.00001 K. These variations, too small to be seen in the black body radiation curve of CMB,
are remnants of the variations when CMB was in contact with matter before it decoupled
from it.
Figure 39.1 is a solid proof that matter indeed had areas of concentration (of
possibly dark matter), which later turned into structures such as globular clusters and
galaxies that we see today.
39.2
Problems with Standard Cosmology
The standard big bang cosmology has been very successful in describing the content and
development of the universe. And many observations vindicate its validity: the darkness
of the night sky; the hydrogen and helium abundance, with H outweighing He three to
one, and with practically no other primordial element in the universe; the expansion of the
universe; and the background radiation. However, all is not well with the standard model of
cosmology. There are three main problems with the model having to do with the ﬂatness

of the universe, with the causality and the inﬂuence of the horizons of far observers, and
with the distribution of structures in the universe.
The following subsections address
these problems one by one.
39.2.1
The Flatness Problem
The ﬂatness problem is best discussed in terms of a parameter denoted by Ωtot. It is the
ratio of the actual density to the critical density: Ωtot = ρ/ρc. The contribution of diﬀerent
components to the actual density carry a subscript on their corresponding Ω. For instance,
Ωγ = ργ/ρc is the contribution of radiation to Ωtot; Ωm = ρm/ρc is matter’s contribution
to Ωtot; Ων = ρν/ρc is neutrino’s contribution, etc. Therefore, Ωtot can be expressed as
Ωtot = Ωm + Ωγ + Ων + . . . A ﬂat universe has a total density equal to the critical density,
i.e., an Ωtot equal to 1.
To understand the problem associated with the ﬂatness, let’s go back to the very begin-
ning of our discussion of cosmology, to the Friedmann equation (37.1). Math Note E.39.1
on page 149 of Appendix.pdf shows that the Friedmann equation can be written as
Ωtot(t) −1 = kc2/(R2H2),
(39.1)
where R and H are, of course, functions of time. For a perfectly ﬂat universe, k = 0 and
Ωtot(t) = 1, meaning that the universe must have always (i.e., for all t) been ﬂat.
What do you know? 39.2. If the universe was perfectly ﬂat at some time, could it
become closed or open at some other time?
Now suppose that the universe is not ﬂat, say Ωtot = 1.5. Then, as Math Note E.39.1
A minute non-ﬂatness
early on grows into a
huge non-ﬂatness in the
present universe.
demonstrates, at the time of the radiation decoupling Ωtot must have been 1.000908, at
the onset of matter dominance it must have been 1.00018, and at the time of the helium
formation it must have been 1.0000000000000353. Thus a big deviation from ﬂatness now,
diminishes to a very small deviation at earlier times.
Turning the argument around, if
shortly after the big bang, the universe was even minutely nonﬂat, it would have evolved
into a universe completely diﬀerent from the very nearly ﬂat universe we observe. In fact,
the latest (July 2008) measurement of Ωtot puts it between 0.999 and 1.023!

show how the horizon in the xy-plane also increases in size. The dot at the center of the bottom circles is
the location of the observer O. The vertical line passing through O is his world line.
The ﬂatness problem can be posed as the question: Why out of an inﬁnite number of
possibilities available to it at the time of creation, did the universe choose to be ﬂat, i.e.,
with a constant Ωtot of exactly 1? Of course, one can retort the question with another
question “Why not?” But such a very special initial condition begs for an answer; and
there is one, as we shall see later.
39.2.2
The Horizon Problem
The horizon problem is even more serious than the ﬂatness problem. It has to do with
the very notion of causality and the amazing uniformity of the CMB radiation. COBE
Uniformity of CMB

cosmology.
measurements have revealed that the temperature of the background radiation is remarkably
uniform across the sky:1 regardless of the angle of observation, CMB has a temperature
of 2.725 K. On the other hand, uniform temperature of a system is achieved only when
diﬀerent parts of the system come in contact with one another or somehow communicate
information with each other. The following argument shows that points far away from each
other in the sky could never have communicated with one another!
Any observer O has two light cones, one that connects him to the future and one that
connects him to the past (see Figure 27.4). Concentrate on the past light cone. All events
that are inside or on the light cone are causally connected to O; i.e., O can receive, observe,
interact, etc.
only with those events.
Now suppose that O is located in the xy-plane,
not moving. All the points (events) in the xy-plane of the spacetime coordinate system
have t = 0. Figure 39.2 shows the spacetime geometry appropriate for this discussion. In
contrast to the discussion of Chapter 27, we have added an extra space dimension to make
the graphs more realistic.
Now let’s ask the question: “Which events occurring at some time t are causally con-
nected to O?” The answer: All the events that lie both inside O’s past light cone and in
the xy-plane. These are points that lie inside and on a circle in the xy-plane with O at
its center, the region that we have called the horizon. The size of the horizon depends on
t. This is because, although O is stationary in space (the xy-plane), it moves in spacetime
(on its vertical world line). So at later times, the vertex of the past light cone is farther
away from the xy-plane, cutting a larger circle out of it. Therefore, O can communicate
only with points in the xy-plane that lie within the horizon. At earlier times, only a small
portion of space (the xy-plane) have had suﬃcient time for their “signals” to reach O; at

later times more and more points become “observable” to O. It should be clear that the
radius of the horizon at time t is ct.
All discussions and graphs above pertain to spacetime geometry without gravity and
universal expansion.
When we include gravity, the only thing that changes is that the
horizon radius becomes not just ct, but a multiple of that (3ct when matter is dominant, and
2ct when radiation). Therefore, in an expanding universe, a point can be in causal contact
only with points in the universe that lie inside its horizon, which grows in proportion to
time. Now go back to Figure 39.2 and let t = 0 be the time of the big bang. Any time
after the big bang, the horizon covers only a ﬁnite portion of the universe. Thus, O can
communicate only with a ﬁnite portion of the universe. So, how did one point of the CMB
“know” what the temperature of the other points was?
What do you know? 39.3. What was the horizon radius right after the dominance
of radiation ended when the temperature of the universe was 14,800 K? (Hint: Use
Equation (38.1), with α = 1.681 to account for the presence of neutrinos. Then use
rh = 2ct to ﬁnd the horizon radius.) What was the distance between P1 and P2, two
diametrically opposed points of the horizon? Could two points, which were farther apart
than this, communicate with each other?
The immediate answer may be “Radiation was in contact with matter; so diﬀerent parts
just picked up the corresponding temperature of matter, which was after all uniformly hot.”
This is not a good answer, because then we have to answer the question of how one part of
matter knew the temperature of the other parts that were causally disconnected from it, a
precondition for the uniformity of the temperature. (If the horizon is ﬁnite for radiation,
it is also ﬁnite for matter.) Another answer may be that the entire universe was inside
the horizon, and therefore, all points of the universe were causally connected. This is not a
good answer either, because the horizon is only a fraction of the universe as Example D.37.3
showed. In fact, Example D.39.2 on page 73 of Appendix.pdf illustrates that points of
the present sky that are separated by very small angles could not have known of each
other ever since the domination of matter. Once the radiation decouples, diﬀerent regions
of it will develop independently, as radiation does not interact with itself. Yet COBE’s
measurements clearly indicate that over the entire sky, the CMB radiation is remarkably
uniform; and the only way that could happen is for diﬀerent parts of the radiation to have
communicated with one another. This is the horizon dilemma that standard cosmology
cannot resolve.
What do you know? 39.4. In the previous What do you know?, you calculated
the distance between P1 and P2, two diametrically opposed points of the horizon. As
the universe expands, this distance increases. What is this distance now? The light
coming from those two points have traveled almost 13.7 billion light years, i.e., the
distance between us and those two points is 13.7 billion light years. What is the current
angular separation between P1 and P2? Hint: Divide P1P2 by the distance from us to
P1 and P2 to get the angle in radian. Each radian is 57.3 egrees.
39.2.3
The Structure Problem
The problem associated with structure is twofold.
The ﬁrst has to do with the sheer
existence of structure. If the universe is homogeneous and isotropic, why are there regions
in which structures exist? These regions must have been the site of “seeds” (concentration
of dark matter, perhaps) that have existed since very early times. As we saw in Example

600
Chapter 39
The Last Epoch
D.39.1, the amount of material needed to clump matter together just before decoupling
was enormous. So much, in fact, so that diﬀerent parts of it could not have been causally
connected and could not have coherently collapsed to form structure.
The second problem has to do with the homogeneity and isotropy of the distribution of
structures in the universe. Once you go beyond the local structures, the universe looks very
similar at diﬀerent angles and at diﬀerent distances. Concentration of varieties of distant
galaxies look very much the same. You don’t ﬁnd a crowd of one galaxy shape in one region
of the sky and another in a diﬀerent region. How did this homogeneity of galaxy distribution
take place, when we know that regions of the sky only a few degrees apart could not have
communicated with one another?
39.3
Inﬂationary Cosmology
The solution to the shortcomings of the standard cosmology came from a completely un-
related ﬁeld.
Grand uniﬁed theories (GUT), of which we spoke brieﬂy in Section 34.5,
although appealing, had some serious ﬂaws. One of these ﬂaws was the unobserved pre-
diction of the decay of proton, mentioned at the end of Section 34.5. The other was the
Connection between
magnetic monopoles and
cosmology.
existence of magnetic monopoles, which was also not observed. Prior to the downfall
of the GUT in the mid 1980s, Alan Guth, an elementary particle theorist, was trying to
explain the scarcity of the magnetic monopoles in the universe. The standard cosmological
model predicted that there should be as many monopoles as there are nucleons! Since all
attempts at ﬁnding a monopole had failed, Guth suggested that the universe must have had
an inﬂation phase during which it expanded exponentially. This exponential growth was
so rapid that it diluted any existing monopoles so much so that today there may be only a
few in our observable universe.
BIOGRAPHY
Alan Guth was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1947. He attended the public schools in Highland
Park, NJ, but skipped his senior year of high school to begin studies at MIT, where he remained for
all his degrees, including Ph.D. Guth then held several postdoctoral positions including one at Cornell,
where he was approached by a fellow postdoctoral physicist, Henry Tye, who persuaded Guth to join
him in studying the production of magnetic monopoles in the early universe. This work changed the
direction of Guth’s career. The following year at SLAC, he continued to work with Tye on magnetic
monopoles. They found that standard assumptions in particle physics and cosmology would lead to a
fantastic overproduction of magnetic monopoles, contrary to observations, which have failed to detect
even a single magnetic monopole. Guth and Tye began a search for alternatives to avoid monopole
overproduction, and from this work Guth invented the inﬂationary universe.
The idea of inﬂation, designed to solve the magnetic monopole problem, gave an un-
expected explanation for the three problems of standard cosmology in one gigantic swoop.
Once the details of the microscopic physics of the grand uniﬁed theories are worked out, the
macroscopic eﬀect is the introduction of the notorious cosmological constant Λ in Einstein’s
GTR, and—from there—in the Friedmann equation, which is modiﬁed to

The expansion of the universe reduces both the ﬁrst (because ρ decreases with expansion)
and the second (because R increases with expansion) terms. Therefore, after a while the
third term becomes dominant, and noting that the left-hand side is just the Hubble param-
eter, one gets H =
p
Λ/3. Math Note E.39.2 on page 151 of Appendix.pdf shows that
in such a case, R increases exponentially.
This exponential increase solves the ﬂatness problem immediately. In fact, Math Note
E.39.2 also derives Equation (E.162), which describes an exponential decay of Ωtot. Even if

Section 39.4
Birth of a Star
601
Ωtot is not equal to 1, the exponential factor makes the right-hand side equal to zero after
a while, forcing Ωtot to become 1 for quite a long time. Example D.39.3 on page 74 of
Universe will never

inﬂation operates
between 10−34 s and
10−32 s after the big

Appendix.pdf illustrates that if the universe inﬂated between 10−34 s and 10−32 s after the
big bang (i.e., if inﬂation operated for a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth
of a millionth of a hundredth of a second), then, regardless of how nonﬂat it might have
been earlier, it becomes so nearly ﬂat that it would take 450 million million million million
million times the present age of the universe for it to have an Ωtot equal to 1.0001! In other
words, the universe will never become unﬂat if inﬂation operates for only a (incredibly)
small fraction of a second after the big bang.
The horizon problem is also solved beautifully with inﬂation. Math Note E.39.2 derives
the horizon radius as a function of time during the inﬂation, and Example D.39.4 on
page 74 of Appendix.pdf uses some reasonable numbers to estimate the rate of expansion
of a horizon. It is shown in that example that, during the extremely brief period of inﬂation
(a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a hundredth of a
second), the horizon grows from a subnuclear distance to over 85 light years! This means
that a tiny region of the universe, small enough to achieve thermal equilibrium before
inﬂation, can expand to be much larger than the size of the presently observable universe.
Finally inﬂation gives a solution to the structure problem as well. At the beginning

of the inﬂation, the radius of the horizon in our part of the universe was subnuclear, at
which distance the laws of quantum mechanics were relevant.
In particular, statistical
ﬂuctuations, inherent in the probabilistic nature of the quantum theory, could have caused
a slight variation in the density—the seeds of the future structures—of that region of the
universe. Because of the symmetry of the universe, the distribution of these seeds must
have been more or less uniform. Upon expansion of that subnuclear region, the seeds and
the uniformity of their distribution were carried over to the inﬂated universe.
What do you know? 39.5. Would it be possible to explain the structure formation
in the universe if we had not discovered the quantum theory?
39.4
Birth of a Star
The study of the formation of structure is challenging and not fully understood. Large
structures such as galaxies are the subject of intense observational and theoretical investi-
gations. One of the things (among many others) that make galaxies so hard to study is the
existence of the mysterious dark matter within them. We still don’t know what exactly dark
matter is. There have been numerous candidates for it (including massive neutrinos), but a
satisfactory explanation is yet to come. For this and other reasons, we avoid any discussion
of galactic formation and evolution. Instead, we focus on the formation and evolution of
much smaller structures, stars, which are far better understood.
The birth of a star starts with a large, cold, and diﬀuse cloud of a hydrogen-helium gas
mixture. A tiny region around a point P of this cloud is slightly denser than its surrounding.
The mutual gravitational attraction between this region and its nearby regions pulls them
together; and since P is more massive, it moves less than the surrounding, attracting atoms,
becoming heavier, and therefore resisting motion even further. P becomes the center of

accretion. As the atoms get attracted towards P, they accelerate, their (average) kinetic
energy increases, i.e., the region becomes hotter (see Box 17.2.5).
Further increase in the mass strengthens the gravitational ﬁeld, attracting more and
more atoms toward the center, heating up the core. Once suﬃcient quantity of hydrogen
and helium atoms is accumulated at the core (about a million years after the start of
the gravitational contraction), its temperature reaches about ten million Kelvin, and, as
Example 31.2.6 showed, nuclear fusion, mostly in the form of proton-proton cycle, sets

in. A star is born. What is the smallest mass at which the nuclear fusion starts? Math
Note E.39.3 on page 152 of Appendix.pdf estimates this minimum mass to be about half
a solar mass M⊙, concentrated in a sphere with a radius of 0.13R⊙.
A star lives, so long as the fusion process, which transforms hydrogen into helium,
continues. The life of the star is a balance between the gravitational force trying to collapse
the star and the outward pressure of the gas resisting this collapse. This pressure is caused
by the increase in the gas temperature, which in turn is a result of the interaction of radiation
(a by-product of fusion) with the atomic nuclei in the star. What is the largest mass that
the radiation pressure can support? Math Note E.39.4 on page 153 of Appendix.pdf
estimates this maximum mass to be about 7.5M⊙. The life-span of a star is determined by
its mass. A star as massive as the Sun is expected to live for over 10 billion years. More
massive stars (10 to 100 solar masses) cannot provide suﬃcient radiation resistance to the
strong gravitational force, and collapse much sooner, perhaps in a mere 10 million years.
The energy of the fusion is carried mostly (about 95%) by photons and the neutrinos
It takes light about a
million years to go from

(about 5%). The very energetic photons (in the form of gamma rays) travel from the core
to the surface, undergoing multiple scattering from the dense material along the way, and
losing considerable amount of energy to them, thereby heating them up and increasing their
pressure. By the time a photon reaches the surface, it has lost so much energy that it is
now visible. The photons emerging from the surface of a star are not the same photons that
started at the core. In the process of scattering, a photon is absorbed by a charged particle,
and another photon with a diﬀerent wave length is emitted, which in turn gets absorbed
by yet another charge particle, and a third photon is emitted, etc. Between the time that
the gamma ray starts at the core and the visible photon emerges at the surface, almost a
million years passes!
What do you know? 39.6. Estimate the speed of “light” as it goes from the core
of the Sun to its surface. The radius of the Sun is 700,000 km. Does this mean that a
photon travels this slow in the Sun?

of matter and escape into outer space unscathed. The solar neutrinos have been detected
on Earth with a puzzling twist. The neutrinos produced in the Sun are all electron neutrinos,
and based on the kind of reaction that takes place in the interior of the Sun, a certain
amount of electron neutrino ﬂux is expected on Earth. However, experiments since the
early 1990s have detected a weaker electron neutrino ﬂux than expected. An explanation
that has been gaining grounds is neutrino oscillation, which states that it is possible for
one neutrino ﬂavor to transform (oscillate) to another. This can happen only if neutrinos,
which have been assumed massless, are actually massive. Now there is strong evidence that
neutrinos indeed have mass, and that the ﬂavor of the electron neutrinos coming from the
Sun transform into other ﬂavors such as muon and tauon on their way to Earth.
39.5
Death of a Star
Hydrogen is the ﬁrst kind of fuel that a star uses. Once it is used up2 and the photons
that heated the gas surrounding the core and kept the star from collapsing are no longer
produced, gravity gets an upper hand again and the star begins a new phase of collapse.
Depending on the mass of the star, this phase goes through various stages in which lighter
elements are used up in the process of fusion, and heavier elements are formed until the
most stable nuclei like iron are reached, at which point the fusion stops. Why does it stop?
2The hydrogen is not completely used up in this stage. When only about 10% of the hydrogen is burned,
this stage comes to an end, and a new phase starts.

Section 39.5
Death of a Star
603
Because iron is at the peak of the stability curve of the nuclei (see Figure 31.1 and the
beginning of Section 31.2.3). No more fusion means no more radiation pressure. The star
has now reached the end of its life. Gravity, encountering no resistance, pushes the entire
stellar matter towards the core, and depending on its mass, the corpse of a star can take
three diﬀerent shapes: white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole.
39.5.1
White Dwarfs
For an ordinary star like the Sun, the gravitational collapse continues until a temperature
of a hundred million Kelvin is reached. At this point, helium3 starts to diﬀuse to form
carbon. The photons that are released in the fusion of helium are much more energetic
than those produced in the hydrogen fusion. Therefore, after the hydrogen supply ends
and helium burning begins, the energetic photons create a much larger pressure, pushing
the outer layers of the star outward until the star becomes a hundred or even a thousand
times larger. At this stage the star is called a red giant; red, because the spread of the

huge energy across its enormous area reduces the amount of power output of each square
meter of its surface, resulting in a lower temperature (longer wavelength) than a normal
star. When the Sun turns into a red giant, it will gobble up Mercury and Venus, possibly
Earth and even Mars.
What do you know? 39.7. Suppose that when the Sun turns into a red giant, its
power output will be 250 times its current power output of 4×1026 Watts, and its radius
100 times its current radius of 7 × 108 m. What is the brightness Je (i.e., power per
square meter) of the red giant? Using Equation (20.1), estimate the surface temperature
of the red giant. Using Equation (20.2), estimate the wavelength at which the BBR
curve of the red giant peaks. Recall that the area of a sphere of radius r is 4πr2.
The ﬁnal product of the collapse of a star similar to the Sun is a white dwarf, with a
density of about a million tons per cubic meter, a radius of a few thousand kilometers (about
the Earth radius), and a surface temperature of about 10,000 K. Math Note E.39.5 on
page 154 of Appendix.pdf outlines a very crude approximation to the physics of a white
dwarf. The white dwarf eventually releases its energy to the empty space and becomes a
black dwarf. This is the fate of a star like the Sun, and that is what will happen to it 6
to 8 billion years from now.
What do you know?
39.8. What is the gravitational acceleration at the surface
of a white dwarf? How much does the light bend when grazing a white dwarf? Use

and macroscopic world.
The electrons have now been pushed so much that the Pauli
exclusion principle (see Box 23.3.4) becomes relevant:4 electrons cannot get any closer
together, because two or more of them would have to occupy the same quantum state,
violating Pauli’s principle. A quantum principle, applicable to a strange quantum property
called spin, prevents a gigantically massive object from collapsing under gravity. That’s
astonishing!
3When we mention an element, we mean its nucleus, of course. No electron can be permanently captured
to form atoms at the extreme temperature of the core of a star.
4Although we used Pauli’s exclusion principle in Math Note E.39.3 for an ordinary star, it is in the
description of a white dwarf that the principle reveals its dramatic eﬀect.

a way for further collapse. However, for the process to take eﬀect, the star ought to be
more massive. If the mass of a star is larger than the Chandrasekhar mass, which is
about 1.4 solar mass, the gravitational force becomes so strong that, at the end of the fusion
cycle, the electrons and protons come in contact, and through the electroweak process of
e−+ p →n + νe, turn into neutrons and neutrinos. The electrons and protons almost com-
pletely annihilate each other; neutrinos escape into outer space, and only neutrons remain.
The electronic pressure due to Pauli’s exclusion principle—also called electron degeneracy
pressure—having terminated, the star collapses again until the neutron degeneracy prevents
it from further collapse. The star has turned into a neutron star, a gigantic (atomic) nu-
cleus composed of only neutrons, having a radius of about 10 km and a density of over
1017 kg/m3. The end of Math Note E.39.5 derives some properties of neutron stars.

10 km in radius, it will spin unimaginably fast; and if the electric charges secreted during
the collapse are trapped in the gigantic magnetic ﬁeld of the neutron star, they produce an
electromagnetic pulse that rotates with the star, sweeping the sky much like a searchlight.
When one of these pulses was ﬁrst discovered in 1967, it was thought to be coming from an
intelligent civilization. After all, how can anything else produce such regular pulses with
a period of exactly 1.34 s? Since 1967 hundreds of these pulsars have been observed, and
their origin is clearly understood to be the collapse of a stellar mass into a neutron star.

astronomers have recorded a supernova explosion in 1054 that was visible in the daytime
for many days. The expanding shell of that explosion is what today’s astronomers call the
Crab Nebula. At the center of the Crab Nebula is a pulsar with a period of 0.033 s.
One pulsar, discovered in 1974, appeared to have a strange behavior.
Its period of
0.059 s—corresponding to a frequency of 17 Hz—seemed to decrease slightly for a while
and then increase by the same amount a little later; and this change occurred regularly.
The discoverers of the pulsar quickly realized that the shift in the frequency was due to the
Doppler eﬀect, one caused by the motion of the pulsar towards and the other due to its
motion away from the Earth. For this to happen, the pulsar must be orbiting around an
unseen companion.
From the change in the Doppler shift, the period of the orbit was estimated as just 8

hours. This puts the pulsar very close to its companion (which is believed to be another
neutron star). If a planet were orbiting the Sun with such a period, it would have to be
at a distance of only 1.4 million kilometer from the Sun’s center.
Mercury, the closest
planet, is 58 million kilometers away from the Sun, over 40 times farther than the pulsar
is from its companion. And Mercury is already feeling the eﬀects of the general relativistic
curvature. With the companion having a mass larger than the Sun, and the pulsar orbiting
it at such a close distance, the general relativistic eﬀects are even more noticeable. In fact,
the curvature is so large that the rotation of the pulsar produces gravitational waves. We
have already seen how these waves aﬀect the period of the pulsar in Section 29.3.2.

From a general relativistic point of view, rs is the
distance—from the center of a spherical mass distribution—at which the geometry of space-
time breaks down. Any spherical object whose actual radius is smaller than its Schwarzschild
radius is a black hole.
Black holes abound in the universe. As they cannot emit any form of EM radiation
We can’t see a black
hole, but physics can!
(the primary source of cosmic information), black holes cannot be seen directly. To “see”
a black hole, one has to rely on observing the theoretical predictions applied to objects
that are under its inﬂuence. Black holes come in three general varieties depending on their
origin and their mass scale: black holes in X-ray binaries, black holes in galaxy centers, and
exploding primordial black holes.
Black Holes in X-Ray Binaries
Most of the stars are members of binary pairs in orbital motion about one another. One
member of some of these binaries may be a compact star—many times more massive than
the Sun—that has undergone a supernova explosion and turned into a black hole. If the
orbit of the normal partner is small enough, it may shed material and form an accretion
disk orbiting around the black hole (see Figure 39.3). The material in the disk may lose
energy due to various dissipative mechanisms and spiral closer to the center of the black
hole. The energy released can heat up the inner regions of the disk to such an extent that
X-rays are produced.
[Wien’s displacement law (20.2) tells us that for λmax to have a
typical X-ray value of 10−10 m, the temperature must be about 30 million Kelvin.]
X-ray binaries, detectable by X-ray telescopes in orbits around Earth, are some of the
brightest X-ray sources in the sky. These X-ray sources can be identiﬁed by the Doppler
shift of the optical spectrum of the normal partner. Thus, if X-ray telescopes detect a
source at a certain location of the sky, and optical telescopes detect a normal star in the
same location whose spectrum is Doppler-shifted, then there must exist an X-ray binary in
that location, with the invisible partner being a black hole.

holes.

606
Chapter 39
The Last Epoch
As in the case of the X-ray binaries, supermassive black holes are not directly observable.
Aside from their entrapment of light, these black holes comprise a tiny spot in the middle
of a galaxy. The Schwarzschild radius of even the most massive black holes is only a billion
kilometers, the size of the solar system, while the central bulge of a galaxy has a radius
of several thousand light years, or 10 million times larger than the black hole: spotting
something that is 10 million times smaller than the galaxy is not easy.
Identiﬁcation of supermassive black holes at galactic centers results from the observation
of the motion of the nearby matter, just as in the case of dark matter discussed in Section
9.1.3. From the rotational speed of the nearby matter and v =

GM/r [Equation (9.3)],
the mass M can be estimated; and if the estimate indicates a huge mass in a small region
at the center of a galaxy, that is evidence for a black hole.

more luminous than all the rest of the stars of the galaxy put together. The radiation

is not starlight, which is almost like a black body radiator. In fact, the centers of such
galaxies emit X-rays, optical radiation, and radio waves with almost equal intensity. These
are galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Almost all AGNs can be detected at
distances where the host galaxy is too dim to be observed. The brightest AGNs are 10,000
times brighter than a typical galaxy at the same distance. The size of a typical AGN is
several hundred thousand times smaller than a galaxy. All these properties point to the
possibility that AGNs are supermassive rotating black holes, and this rotation can be
one of the sources of the intense energy of the released radiation.

diagnosed with the motor neurone, or Lou Gehrig’s disease in early 1963.
The doctors predicted
that he would not live long enough to complete his doctorate. However, not only did he ﬁnish his
doctorate in 1966, but he became a Research Fellow, and then a Professorial Fellow at Gonville and
Caius College, Cambridge. In 1973 he joined the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical
Physics at Cambridge, becoming Professor of Gravitational Physics in 1977. Two years later Hawking
was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge, a post once held by Newton. Between
1965 and 1970 Hawking worked on singularities in the theory of general relativity in collaboration with
Roger Penrose. From 1970 Hawking began to apply his previous ideas to the study of black holes.
Combining quantum theory and general relativity, he discovered the remarkable property that black
holes can emit what is now called Hawking radiation. Today, over 40 years after the doctors gave him
only a few years to live, Hawking, although conﬁned to a wheelchair and talking through an electronic
device, is as alive and active as ever.
Primordial Black Holes
The ﬂuctuations in the density of the early universe depicted in Figure 39.1 could have
attracted enough material to form a collapsing star with a black hole as the end product.
These black holes would have a mass of about 1011 kg, and therefore, a Schwarzschild
radius of only 10−16 m, smaller than a proton! How does one look for these black holes?
Quantum-sized black holes require quantum physics.
Section 32.2.2 introduced the idea of vacuum polarization, in which a virtual electron-
positron pair is created and immediately annihilated. Although such pairs are not directly
observable, and have no observable eﬀect in an inﬁnite space with no external ﬁelds, they

Section 39.6
End-of-Chapter Material
607
have observable eﬀects when external ﬁelds—such as the electric ﬁeld of an atomic nucleus—
are present. Lamb shift, already discussed in Section 32.2.2, is precisely the vacuum polar-
ization eﬀect applied to the Coulomb ﬁeld of the hydrogen nucleus. Another eﬀect, relevant
to our present discussion is the following.
Near the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole, the gravitational ﬁeld is so strong that
it can lend energy to the creation of an electron-positron pair. One of the particles could
get sucked into the black hole and the other escape away from it. The latter is then part
of the Hawking radiation.
The escaped particle could be an electron or a positron.
Hawking radiation.
Furthermore, since photons are their own antiparticles, a pair of photons could also be
produced. Hawking radiation therefore consists of matter, antimatter, and photons. The
energy taken away by Hawking radiation reduces the gravitational energy of the black hole,
diminishing its size until it evaporates.
How long after its formation does a primordial black hole evaporate? The formula for
the lifetime (in years) of a primordial black hole is tevap = 1010  M/10123, where M is the
mass of the black hole in kilogram. For an ordinary black hole with a mass of a few, say
10, solar masses, this formula gives tevap = 8 × 1067 years. Even if such a black hole were
formed immediately after the big bang, we would now have to wait 8 × 1067 −1.37 × 1010
or 8 × 1067 years for it to evaporate! However, if a black hole has a mass of 1012 kg, its
lifetime is 1010 years, and if it was formed right after the big bang, it would be evaporating
now. Due to severe theoretical constraints on the number of such black holes, it is doubtful
that they would ever be detected.

Answers to “What do you know?”
39.1.
The energy density of radiation is ργc2. At the decoupling temperature of 3000 K
and ργ given by Equation (37.2), this gives a pressure Pγ of 0.06 Pa. For matter, as an
ideal gas, the energy is just KE, and the energy density is number density times average
KE. The average KE is just kBT [see Equation (17.1) and ignore the numerical factor], and
the number density is 0.074T 3 nucleons/m3. Multiplying these together and putting the
numbers in gives a Pm of 8.3 × 10−11 Pa, which is a billion times smaller than Pγ.
39.2.
If the universe is perfectly ﬂat at any time during its history, then k = 0, and
Equation (39.2) yields Ωtot(t) −1 = 0, making Ωtot(t) = 1 for all time t. Therefore, the
universe cannot become open or closed.
39.3. Equation (38.1), with α = 1.681 gives the time as 25,700 years. The horizon radius
is 2c(25700 years). The c and the “years” give light years. So, the radius is 51,400 light
years. The distance between P1 and P2 is just the diameter of the horizon or about 100,000
light years. Any two points whose distance was larger than 100,000 light years lay outside
the horizon, and therefore, could not communicate with one another.
39.4. The separation has increased in inverse proportion to temperature, i.e., by a factor
of 14800/2.725 or 5431. So, P1P2 has grown to 543,100,000 light years. Dividing this by
13.7 billion light years gives an angle of 0.04 radian or 2.27 degrees.
39.5. No! Only the probabilistic nature of the quantum theory allows for uniformly random
distribution of the seeds of structure right after the creation of the universe.
39.6. Dividing the distance of 7 × 108 m by the time of 1 million years or 3.15 × 1013 s, we
obtain 0.00002 m/s, or 0.002 cm/s, or 0.02 mm/s! This does not mean that photons travel
this slow in the Sun. Each photon gets absorbed by matter and after a while a diﬀerent
photon is emitted. Between emission and absorption, the photon travels with the speed of
light.
39.7. The total power output of the red giant is 1029 Watts. Its area is 4π(7 × 1010)2 or
6.16 × 1022 m2. Therefore the brightness (power divided by area) is 1.6 × 106 W/m2. Use

608
Chapter 39
The Last Epoch
this in Equation (20.1) and get T 4 = 2.86 × 1013 and T = 2313 K. Now substitute this
in Equation (20.2) and obtain λmax = 1.25 × 10−6 m or 1.25 µm, which is in the infrared
region of the EM spectrum.
39.8. Put the numbers in the formula for gravitational acceleration and get 667,000 m/s2.
Put the numbers in the formula for bending of light and get 0.000148 radian. Each radian
is 57.3 degrees. So, the angle is 0.0085 degrees, which is about 40 times larger than the
light-bending of the Sun. Note that Equation (29.1) gives half the actual angle because it
does not incorporate the curvature of spacetime.

Chapter Glossary
Active Galactic Nucleus A source of extremely powerful radiation in some galaxies.
These sources are believed to be supermassive rotating black holes at the center of
some remote galaxies.
Chandrasekhar Mass The critical mass above which a star undergoes a supernova ex-
plosion and turns into a neutron star or a black hole.
Flatness Problem A problem with the standard cosmology whereby a slight nonﬂatness
at the beginning of the universe turns into a huge unobserved ﬂatness now.
Hawking Radiation Radiation caused by the vacuum polarization in the presence of the
intense gravitational ﬁeld at the Schwarzschild radius of a black hole.
Horizon Problem A problem with the standard cosmology whereby even points separated
by a very small angle could not have communicated causally, and therefore, could not
have attained the uniform temperature observed in the present universe.
Inﬂationary Cosmology The assumption, introduced to reduce the number of monopoles
in the early universe, also solved the problems associated with the standard cosmology.
According to this assumption, the universe expanded at an exponentially rapid pace
for a minute fraction of a second after the big bang, and then expanded at the pace
set by the standard cosmology.
Jeans Mass The minimum mass required for a gas of particles to clump together gravita-
tionally.
Magnetic Monopoles Magnets with only south or north poles. These were predicted by
the GUTs to be as abundant as the nucleons in the universe.
Neutrino Oscillation The transformation of one neutrino ﬂavor into another. This oscil-
lation depends crucially on the massiveness of neutrinos.
Neutron Star The celestial body left over from a star a few times more massive than the
Sun after it reaches the end of its life.
Primordial Black Hole A hypothetical black hole with a Schwarzschild radius of only
10−16 m, formed right after big bang.
Proton-Proton Cycle A set of nuclear reactions (fusion processes) which turn four pro-
tons into a helium nucleus.
Red Giant The stage just before a star like the Sun turns into a white dwarf. In this
stage, the star grows to a hundred or a thousand times its original size.
Schwarzschild Radius The radius characterizing the ability of a black hole in capturing
light. If light gets closer to the black hole than this radius, it cannot escape the gravity
of the black hole.

Solar Neutrinos Neutrinos received on Earth and produced in the core of the Sun via
fusion processes.
Structure Problem A problem with the standard cosmology whereby even points sep-
arated by a very small angle could not have communicated causally, and therefore,
could not have attained the uniform structure distribution observed in the present uni-
verse. Furthermore, the assumption of isotropy and homogeneity does not allow the
formation of structure like stars and galaxies, which breaks isotropy and homogeneity.
Supernova The explosion of a star a few times more massive than the Sun just before it
reaches the end of its life.
White Dwarf The celestial body left over from a star such as the Sun after it reaches the
end of its life.

Epilogue: The Closing Dialogue
It was his last lecture of the semester.
The professor had been teaching PHY 101 for
over four months, and in doing so, he not only covered some hard-core physics, but also
implications that the laws and methodology of physics may have on students’ worldview. He
had emphasized the continuity of science, the pattern of universal discoveries that always
stem from the study of speciﬁc problems, the interplay between observation and theory, and
the connection between terrestrial physics and the celestial objects.
Now the professor wanted to wrap up the course in the most succinct way possible. He
wanted his students to leave the class taking the most important message of the course;
not necessarily in the form of the technical knowledge that they had gained, but in a more
subtle way. Since his students were not science majors, and his course was possibly the ﬁrst
and last physics course they would have taken, he wanted to convey to them the essence of
science, and he wanted to do so by a Socratic participation of the class. So, he started by
bluntly posing a question.
PROFESSOR: What is the single most important lesson you learned in this course?
CHAD: That physics is the hardest subject in the universe?
PROFESSOR: (Clearing his throat after the collective chuckle of the class subdued) Chad is
right in the sense that playing piano is hard, baseball is hard, hockey is hard, and writing is
hard. In fact, what skill is not hard, if you want to really master it? The reason that some
skills seem to be easy is because you have started them at an early age. If you had waited
until college to play baseball while in the ﬁrst grade you had started learning physics and
continued it year after year, physics would have been much easier for you in college than
baseball. Anyway, let’s not concentrate on what you learned about the course, but from it.
DAN: I liked how physics is relevant to our everyday lives.
PROFESSOR: That is deﬁnitely one aspect of physics, although not the one that I wanted
to emphasize in this particular course. What, beside the application of physics to industry
and technology, have you learned from the course?
KIMBERLEY: I liked how physical laws applied to the whole universe.
PROFESSOR: That’s good. Let’s concentrate on the laws. Kimberley, can you name a few
laws that apply to the whole universe?
KIMBERLEY: The law of gravity. The law that showed us how to calculate Sun’s tempera-
ture; I forgot the name of that law.
PROFESSOR: You mean Wien’s displacement law.
KIMBERLEY: Yes, that law. Also the relativity theory and the big bang.

612
Chapter 40
Epilogue: The Closing Dialogue
PROFESSOR: Any other lessons you learned?
ANDY: How observation and theory go hand in hand?
PROFESSOR: That’s an important lesson. Can you give us some examples?
ANDY: I thought how Galileo came up with the ﬁrst law of motion was really cool.
PROFESSOR: Do you remember how he came up with the ﬁrst law?
ANDY: Yes. He used inclined planes and made them smoother and smoother, and he used
smaller and smaller angles.
PROFESSOR: That’s great. To what kind of motion does the ﬁrst law apply? Anybody.
JULIE: To the motion of any object that is left alone.
PROFESSOR: Does it apply to objects in outer space?
JULIE: As long as the objects are not disturbed.
PROFESSOR: Objects in any part of the universe?
JULIE: I think so.
PROFESSOR: Would you say that, as long as objects are not disturbed, the ﬁrst law is
universally true?
JULIE: Yes.
PROFESSOR: Yes indeed! The law is valid in the entire universe, yet it was discovered on
an inclined plane here on Earth. Kimberley mentioned Wien’s displacement law, which was
also discovered on Earth, yet it could measure the surface temperature of Sun. While we
are talking about it, can anybody think of some other earthly physics applied to Sun?
MAT: The nuclear fusion inside Sun that makes it shine.
PROFESSOR: Excellent! Note that Wien’s displacement law, which was related to the black
body radiation, which was the start of atomic physics, gave us the surface temperature of
Sun; and nuclear physics gave us the physics of Sun’s interior. What did the subnuclear
physics, the physics of quarks and leptons give us?
ANDY: Last week you were talking about the universe right after the big bang, and you
started with quarks, leptons, and some other particles. I have forgotten their names.
PROFESSOR: You mean the gauge bosons? The particles responsible for fundamental forces?
ANDY: Yes.
PROFESSOR: Good! Is there a lesson to be learned here?
CHUCK: This is going to sound weird, but it looks like if we want to ﬁgure out the universe,
that is so big, we need to know how the tiniest fundamental particles and forces work.
PROFESSOR: Chuck, it is not weird at all. In fact, that is the essence of physics. Philosophers
call it reductionism, and some of them have made a hated word out of it. Just like liberalism,
which is a hated word among conservatives, and religious right, which is a hated word among
liberals. Some call it “fundamentalism;” and they are spared the attempt at making it a
hated word. But regardless of what philosophers call it or think of it, physics has always
been after fundamental processes.
JIM: But if you concentrate on the tree, wouldn’t you miss the forest? I had a class in the
philosophy of science, and my teacher taught us that most systems that we are in contact
with are complex, and they have to be studied as a whole. For example, even a cell, although
it may be made up of billions of molecules, should be studied as a whole, because only when
its separate parts work together do we have a live cell. How can dead atoms lead to a living
cell?
PROFESSOR: I’m glad you brought this up, Jim. The philosophy of science you just men-
tioned is called holism. It is popular among many philosophers, all alternative medical
doctors, a few biologists, even fewer chemists and physicists. According to this philosophy,

Chapter 40
Epilogue: The Closing Dialogue
613
science should not break down the object of its study into smaller and smaller parts, because
in so doing it loses the quality that made the object a whole. A cell, which Jim brought up
is a good example. But to understand the holism of a cell, it is instructive to start with a
simpler example. Take water, the most abundant material on Earth. How would a holistic
philosopher advise a chemist to study water? Anybody.
JULIE: By feeling it, smelling it, maybe weighing it and heating it?
PROFESSOR: That’s about it. Holistic philosophers don’t believe in the idea of breaking
water down to its smallest part, a molecule consisting of two hydrogen and one oxygen
atoms. But faced with the undeniable fact that water consists of countless molecules, what
would be the attitude of a holistic philosopher toward water now?
KIMBERLEY: Just study the molecule without worrying about what it is made of?
PROFESSOR: That’s what it looks like, doesn’t it?
JIM: But that is not a fair evaluation of what holistic philosophers say. They don’t apply
their philosophy to water molecules. They are concerned mainly with biological systems.
After all it is true that science has not been able to explain life from a combination of atoms
and molecules.
KIMBERLEY: Just because scientists can’t explain life now, it doesn’t mean that they will
never be able to do it. Who knows? Maybe 100 years from now, they will be able to make
living things out of nonliving molecules.
JIM: How do we know that they will be able to do that?
KIMBERLEY: A hundred years ago there were probably people who said that scientists would
never be able to synthesize organic material, but they are doing it now. So, why shouldn’t
we believe that 100 years, or 200 or 2000 years from now science will not only explain, but
even create life in the lab?
PROFESSOR: Let’s get back to the water molecule and the cell, and let’s not worry about
the cell’s property we call “life.”
I can also point to some properties of water, say its
liquidity, and claim that because hydrogen and oxygen are both gases, their assemblage
cannot explain the fact that water is liquid. A holistic philosopher would then argue that
water molecule cannot be studied by breaking it up into atoms. “Only by studying a water
molecule as a whole,” he might say, “can we understand its liquidity, just as life can only
be studied as a whole.” As a physicist should I or shouldn’t I try to understand atoms?
KIMBERLEY: Of course you should!.
PROFESSOR: And if physicists discover that atoms consist of nuclei and electrons, should
they or shouldn’t they try to understand nuclei and electrons?
JIM: But understanding nuclei and electrons will not help us understand life, will it?
PROFESSOR: Perhaps not directly. But history has shown that only by understanding the
parts, can we understand the whole. Only because we had had a good understanding of
molecules, could we have a better grasp of the unit of life, DNA. Besides, physicists have no
choice. Their pursuit of truth has led them to more and more fundamental entities. Any
holistic approach is against the entire tradition of not only physics, but all sciences. Remem-
ber that chemistry started the atomic theory, and beneﬁted tremendously from it especially
when physicists discovered the structure of the atom and a theoretical understanding of it.
CHAD: I don’t know much about philosophy, but I think it makes no sense to not try to
understand the parts whenever they are discovered. What is wrong with trying to see what
is inside the nucleus of an atom? What is wrong with looking inside protons and neutrons
to see if there are more fundamental particles there? It seems to me that the more we
understand about these tiny particles, the more we understand the bigger picture, the uni-
verse itself. I thought it was so cool to learn last week that the interaction among electrons,
positrons, neutrinos, protons, and neutrons explained the helium/hydrogen abundance in

614
Chapter 40
Epilogue: The Closing Dialogue
the universe. I can’t understand what the holistic philosophers have against this. Unless
they are against science itself, they should see the power of basic science.
JIM: I don’t know much about philosophy myself, and all I know about holism is what I learned
in the philosophy of science course I took last semester. But I think there is a deeper issue
here. Science cannot explain everything; and when it can’t, maybe other methods should
be used to explain things. For example, going back to a cell’s life, if fundamentalism or
reductionism does not work, maybe holism should be given a chance.
PROFESSOR: If we allow holism—which as we just saw, is opposite to science—to replace
science in explaining the life of a cell, then we should allow any other nonscientiﬁc ideas
to do so as well. I hope that you have learned in this course that if an explanation is not
scientiﬁc (i.e., supported by evidence and careful observation), then it is only an opinion, a
story, a fable, a conjecture, a hypothesis, or a myth that may or may not be true. As for
life, it is true that science cannot now make life by assembling nonliving molecules; but, as
Kimberley said, it is possible that if we wait long enough, it will eventually do it, unless we
fall into a long future Dark Age as our ancestors did for almost 20 centuries.
The hour came to an end sooner than the professor expected. The students were already
reaching for their backpacks. So, he wished them a good semester break, and started packing
his notes.
oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
The last four parts of the book summarize the last 100 years of physics. Built on the
classical notions of the previous three centuries, modern physics has been unimaginably
successful in explaining hundreds of puzzles, and opening new vistas of investigation. The
objects of the investigation of physics have been shrinking in size: from atoms, to atomic
nucleus, to protons and neutrons, all the way to quarks and leptons. At the same time the
domain of its application has been expanding in size: from earthly material, to stars, to
galaxies, all the way to the universe itself.
Box 40.0.1. Without a comprehensive knowledge of the fundamental particles and
forces, no understanding of stars, galaxies, and the universe is possible.
If we don’t follow the path of successive reduction, on which nature itself has placed us,
we have to artiﬁcially stop at a certain stage and unscientiﬁcally attribute qualities to that
stage that science, if given a chance, has the capability to explain. The following is a prime
example of this artiﬁcial brake applied to the natural motion toward increasing reduction,
and the bizarre conclusion drawn from it.
Remember Deepak Chopra from Chapter 35? He is a holistic medical doctor who was
charged by the Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to ﬁnd a scientiﬁc explanation of the
ancient Indian medicine Ayurveda, which uses a holistic approach of treating the mind
and body together. We saw in Chapter 35 how Chopra assigned nonmateriality to waves
and materiality to particles, and used the quantum mechanical wave-particle duality to
transform nonmaterial thought into material bodily action, thus “explaining” the mind-
body connection “scientiﬁcally.”
Mind is the residence of intelligence, and any “scientiﬁc” treatment of mind/body holism
is incomplete unless it includes an explanation of the source and the mechanism of the
emergence of intelligence. Modern biology has been able to come very close to unraveling
the molecular basis of memory. A chemical called neuropeptide is produced and transmitted
from neuron to neuron in any recorded brain activity. The details of the production and
transfer of neuropeptides and the exact nature of the connection between them and thought

Chapter 40
Epilogue: The Closing Dialogue
615
are as yet unknown, but under investigation. A further reduction, an examination of the
peptide at a more fundamental level, may be necessary to unlock its function.
However, like a genuine holist, Chopra chides modern biologists for trying to reach ﬁner
and ﬁner levels of physiology to explain intelligence. If reductionism is the wrong way to
go, what is the alternative? How does a holist “explain” intelligence? Chopra claims that
everything that makes up our body, large or small, has intelligence as a built-in feature.
Here are his own words:
Sugar molecules are
intelligent because they
make up the intelligent
DNA!
You may ﬁnd it easy to think of DNA, with its billions of genetic bits, as an intelligent
molecule; certainly it must be smarter than a simple molecule like sugar. How smart
can sugar be?
But DNA is really just strings of sugar, amines, and other simple
components. If these are not “smart” to begin with, then DNA couldn’t become smart
just by putting more of them together. Following this line of reasoning, why isn’t the
carbon or hydrogen atom in the sugar also smart? Perhaps it is. [Chop 90, pp. 65–66]
Atoms are intelligent
because they make up
the intelligent sugar
molecule!
Based on this line of reasoning, we are intelligent because all the atoms and molecules
that make up our body are intelligent! But if we accept the intelligence of all atoms and
molecules, how do we account for the fact that a piece of wood, also made up of atoms and
molecules, is not intelligent?

Misconceptions about Science
We have made quite a journey through the world of physics, and gained a substantial
amount of knowledge along the way. At the end of each part you saw a summary of what
the part taught us. This part of the book assembles these teachings and talks about the
nature of science from a physicist’s perspective. There has been a lot of discussion about
this topic recently, and a number of “theories” have been proposed as to “what science
is” and how it works. Our experience with the physical ideas and methodology exposed
throughout the book should have given us enough background to draw our own conclusion
about “what science is and how it works,” the subject of this part of the book. But before
doing that, let’s dispel some misconceptions about science.
There are a lot of activities that are not science, and their very nature reveals their
nonscientiﬁc character. No one confuses art, music, and poetry with science. But there are
activities which are wrongly taken to be science. Three of these activities, which are most
commonly confused with science are mathematics, technology, and medicine, discussed in
the next few sections of this chapter.
41.1
Mathematics
Nature writes her poems in the language of mathematics. This statement crystallizes the
relation between mathematics and nature (science, especially physics). Our long voyage
through the vastness of physical ideas has revealed that the most fundamental laws of
nature incorporate the most abstract mathematics. The deeper we cut through matter, the
more abstract and elegant the mathematics needed to explain it.
The analogy of language and poetry for mathematics and physics goes beyond a mere
Language, poetry,
mathematics, and
physics.
statement of similarity. There is a strong tie between physics and mathematics as we have
repeatedly observed in the book. While nature speaks in the language of mathematics,
it constantly creates the language. And in this sense, the analogy becomes even stronger:
poetry uses language, but some of the most eﬀective linguistic phrases are created by poetry.
Mathematics and language, while similar, are also diﬀerent.
Mathematics, once ab-
stracted from its natural origin, can grow on its own (through the activity of the human
mind). Language does not have this property; if it grows, it is because of the advancement of
human society. It is a remarkable phenomenon that the abstract mathematics developed by
the mind of humankind ﬁnds its way back in nature.1 Ignoring this diﬀerence, mathematics
1We saw striking examples of this in the application of Lie groups to the connection between spacetime
and matter (Section 33.1), to the classiﬁcation of hadrons (Section 33.2.1), to the uniﬁcation of electromag-
netism and the weak nuclear force (Section 34.2), and to the theory of strong nuclear force QCD (Section
34.3).

is to science as language is to poetry.
And just as the use of a language does not imply poetry, so does the use of mathematics
not imply science. There are many academic (as well as nonacademic) disciplines and trades

that use mathematics, mostly in the form of statistics. Are we to call those disciplines
“science?” Language is used in almost all human activities. Are we to call these activities
“poetry?”
What is the diﬀerence between the usage of the language in poetry and in
other human activities? Poets have a better command of the language and are a lot more
creative in its usage, while the usage in many of the other activities is very limited. Similarly,
physicists use the same mathematics that is used by pollsters, insurance companies, and
marketing ﬁrms. The diﬀerence is that the latter use mathematics in a very limited way
(mostly in the form of statistical data analysis), while physicists are forced by nature itself
to use it much more extensively, creatively, and abstractly.
Physics also uses statistics and probability as we saw in Sections 17.1 and 22.3. The
diﬀerence is that physics predicts the probability it uses; so it knows the probability of
the sample with which it is dealing. The other disciplines have no trace of the probability
of their sample.
They have to ﬁnd this probability empirically by taking “statistically
signiﬁcant” samples of participants. Each time a new question is posed or a new product
comes out, the pollsters have to ﬁnd a new “statistically signiﬁcant” sample of participants.
News media and their
misuse of the word
“science.”
It is an unfortunate fault of the scientiﬁcally uninformed media that any procedure that
uses statistical analysis is called “scientiﬁc.” Let us repeat loud and clear:
Box 41.1.1. The use of statistics or statistical analysis in a discipline or profession
makes that discipline or profession neither a science nor scientiﬁc.

Technology: Application of Science
The rapid development of thermodynamics and electromagnetism in the nineteenth century
opened up a whole new world of technology in the twentieth century. One could say that
the eﬀorts of the physicists of the late eighteenth and mid nineteenth centuries paved the
way for the technicians and inventors of the second half of the nineteenth and the ﬁrst half
of the twentieth centuries to create many novel and ingenious devices. This close connection
between the physicists and inventors has become a source of confusion in the sociology and
politics of science. And the disentanglement of this confusion is a necessary prerequisite for
a true appreciation of the nature and the workings of the scientiﬁc enterprise.
41.2.1
Medicine
Our discussion of technology and its relation to science ought to start with distinguishing
between science and medicine: Medicine is a technology not a science; and as such, it is
the application of science to the treatment of illnesses. In fact, medicine is to biology (and
biochemistry) what industrial technology is to physics (and chemistry). This is hard for the
layman to grasp because the coverage of “science” in the major source of public information,
the media, is restricted to medicine.
Medicine may have motivated some research, which has resulted in scientiﬁc break-
throughs, just as technology (such as steam engines) motivated some branches of physics
(e.g., thermodynamics). But motivation diﬀers substantially from the end product. If Ponzi
scheme results in the accumulation of wealth, we do not identify wealth with Ponzi scheme.
If a novel brings fame to an author, we do not equate fame with writing novels. And if sheer
curiosity brings about scientiﬁc discovery, we should not identify curiosity with science.
Despite the fact that many biological (biophysical, biochemical, biomolecular, . . . ) dis-
coveries may have taken place in medical and health institutions, medicine remains an art,

a technology. And the historical fact that medicine may have been the starting point of
modern biology does not change anything.

The Role of Culture

tential human use. If it has an eye, it is to see the hidden secrets of nature. If it has a
purpose, it is to connect what is known to what is unknown. If it is human, it is only due
to its apparent conﬁnement to the planet Earth. Any other intelligent species, regardless
of its location in the universe will discover the same science. The fact that scientiﬁc laws
are discovered by scientists, who happen to be human beings, does not make science itself
human-dependent.
That science is void of any humanistic trait is evident from its history of development.
It started in Egypt and Babylon, moved to Greece and India, went back to the Middle
East, and ﬁnally landed in the West. As diverse as these civilizations were, and as violently
as they clashed, the transfer of science was always inevitable, because it empowered the
conquering civilizations with new means to rule more eﬀectively. Unlike other culturally
motivated characteristics of humans such as language, which has numerously been trampled
to extinction by history, science has always strengthened on passage from one culture to
the next.
Technology, on the other hand, applies science sightedly, purposefully, and humanly, and
Technology is attached
to culture.
as such, is very much dependent on culture, politics, economy, and all the other character-
istics of the human society. In fact the very word “technology” comes from the Greek word
τϵχνικoσ (technikos), meaning art or artiﬁce. Just as a sculptor uses the raw material such
as stone and clay to create a statue for human pleasure and human consumption, so does
a technician use the raw material such as wires and circuits to create a television set for
human pleasure and human consumption.
Once the discovered laws of nature are put to application, they put on a human face with
all the cultural, political, and social cosmetics fashionable at the time. The same engine
that drives a truckful of food to a ﬂood-stricken community can propel a tank to bulldoze
dwellings, schools, and people. It is technology that takes electricity, a fundamental force
of nature, and either warms houses in the winters of Alaska, or electrocutes a death row
inmate in Texas. The laws of chemistry will not change whether we use them to make
aspirin or nerve gas.
Diﬀerence between
science and technology.
Box 41.2.1. The task of science is solely the discovery of the laws of nature. Technology
(including medicine) uses these laws to meet human needs. Science is independent of
any social, political, or economic conditions. Technology is driven by these conditions.
41.2.3
Science Is Blind to Future Applications
Science is that human activity whose sole purpose is to understand nature by observation
and experimentation, and subsequent condensation of this understanding in theories with
no consideration of the possibility or the consequences of any application. This
last statement requires some explanation. A scientist (when not commissioned by a gov-

ernment or industry) simply tries to solve a mystery or answer an unanswered question.
Whether this answer will have any future application or not is far removed from his or her
mind. History is ﬁlled with examples. In fact, all great theories of physics (including those
upon which our current civilization is based) have been discovered as answers to purely
intellectual questions, satisfaction of childlike curiosities, or reinterpretation of answers in a
more elegant and mathematical form. Applications, if they ever came, appeared much later

622
Chapter 41
Misconceptions about Science
in the ventures of entrepreneurs and inventors who had little knowledge of the deep science
involved. Below are some post-Renaissance examples of scientiﬁc discoveries and how they
relate to technology.
Motion and Gravity
All contributions of the versatile Galileo to the study of motion were the result of his
insatiable desire to know the universe. His experiments with inclined planes, leading to the
ﬁrst law of motion, were done with only one goal in mind: to unravel the secret of motion.
And when he turned his telescope to the sky, his only intention was to observe the detailed
features of stars, planets, and Moon.
If Newton had been after fortune, he would have tended his family farm. Instead he
turned to pure thought and mathematics, because his interest was in understanding the solar
system for the sake of understanding the solar system. This led him to the investigation of
motion (thence to the invention of diﬀerential calculus) and the study of gravity (thence to
the invention of integral calculus). His physics, although a monumental system of thought
with many social, political, and philosophical ramiﬁcations, had very limited technological
applications until very recently when man started to explore the outer space. Newton could
not have dreamed of a day when a nation would have a space agency, which launched
orbiting rockets. shuttles, and satellites using the laws he had discovered.
Newton’s law of gravitation was truly universal. However, its theoretical utility was
hampered by a lack of knowledge of the universal gravitational constant, which eluded all
experimental detections until the brilliant experimenter, Henry Cavendish, measured it
in 1798. Cavendish, an exceedingly shy and retiring person—so much so that he neglected
to publish many of his important discoveries—was in no way interested in commercial
applications of his discovery. In fact, being one of the richest men in England, he was in no
need of any ﬁnancial reward.
Electromagnetism
Perhaps the best examples of curiosity-driven discoveries are the electric and magnetic
phenomena. From a childlike game of kites and lightnings to the discovery of the law of
electrical forces, to the accidental discovery of the production of magnetic ﬁelds from electric
currents, and ﬁnally to the production of electricity from the motion of wires in magnetic
ﬁelds, the science of electromagnetism grew as an intellectual toy in the hands of some
nineteenth century grizzled children.
The ﬁrst application of electromagnetism was telegraph, whose rapid development came
with the discovery that electric impulses could be used to transmit signals along a wire.
Among the many electric systems attempted was the needle telegraph, based on Hans
Christian ¨Orsted’s discovery in 1820 that an electric current caused an adjacent magnetized
needle or pointer to deﬂect.
To further diﬀerentiate between science and technology, consider the following two bi-
ographies.
• The development of the electromagnet in the late 1830s provided the American in-
ventor Samuel Morse with a way to transmit and receive electric signals. The son
of a clergyman, he attended Yale and graduated with a degree, not in any branches of
science, but in art. After some failed attempt at ﬁnding patrons for his imported his-
torical canvases, he turned to politics, running for mayor of New York on the Nativist
ticket, advocating racism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-Semitism.
After failing in politics, in 1837, Morse solicited the partnership of Joseph Henry and
Alfred Vail, and, in 1838, of a US Congressman, in the belief that he could secure
federal funds for the construction of a telegraph line in the US. But when Congress

turned the group down, Morse’s partners gave up and Morse went on alone. In 1843,
he ﬁnally won Congressional support for a 41-mile telegraph line from Baltimore to
Washington, D.C.
• Thomas Alva Edison entered school in Port Huron, but because of hearing prob-
lems, he had diﬃculty following the lessons and his school attendance became sporadic.
Eventually, at the age of 12, Edison took a job as a trainboy on the Grand Trunk Rail-
way. He also began printing a weekly newspaper, which he called the Grand Trunk
Herald.
From 1862 to 1868, Edison worked as a roving telegrapher in the Midwest, the South,
Canada, and New England.
During this time, he began developing a telegraphic
repeating instrument that made it possible to transmit messages automatically. By
1869, Edison’s inventions, including the duplex telegraph and message printer, were
progressing so well, he left telegraphy and began a career of full-time inventing and
entrepreneurship.
Edison moved to New York City and within a year, he was able to open a workshop in
Newark, New Jersey. He produced the Edison Universal Stock Printer, the automatic
telegraph, the quadruplex, as well as other printing telegraphs, while working out of
Newark. Later, with ﬁnancial help from his widowed father, he built a new laboratory
and machine shop in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where he invented his incandescent
electric light bulb.
Compare the two brief biographies above (or the biography of any other inventor) with

that of any physicist (or chemist or biologist), and you will see the essential diﬀerence
between science and technology. With only a few exceptions, scientists have had to mas-
ter their scientiﬁc ﬁelds before they could contribute to them.
This typically—but not
exclusively—involves attending universities and obtaining the highest possible degree in
their chosen ﬁeld. Inventors, on the other hand, have very little or no training in their
“ﬁeld” of interest.
In fact, there is probably as much training in “How to become an
inventor” as there is in “How to make a fortune.”
If the discovery of electric currents and their magnetic eﬀects gave us the telegraph and
the light bulb, what came later—when electricity and magnetism were truly combined—was
nothing less than the founding of our modern civilization. And the bulk of the inventions
were made not by the scientists who wrote down the mathematical equations, but by en-
trepreneurs who had little knowledge of the science but a lot of desire to get rich. The
interplay between scientists’ discoveries and entrepreneurs’ inventions is crucial for the ad-
vancement of both. The technology that is developed as a result of new scientiﬁc discoveries
is inevitably used in the instrumentation of later scientiﬁc investigations.2 However, this
essential interplay between science and technology should not cause muddling the two. On
the contrary, it is more reason to make a clear demarcation between them and advertise this
demarcation, especially when the policy makers and funding agencies mix them up, and in
the long run, hurt both enterprises.
The true uniﬁcation of electricity and magnetism by the purely mathematical arguments
of Maxwell led to the prediction and subsequent production of electromagnetic waves. As
a theoretical physicist, Maxwell could not have dreamed of the use of his discovery in
telecommunication, electronics, computer industry, and a host of other enterprises on which
our modern civilization is built. As he was struggling with the mathematical inconsistency
of the existing electromagnetic equations under candle light in the darkness of many nights,
his motivation was to ﬁnd a solution, not to replace his candles with light bulbs!
Even Heinrich Hertz, who produced the ﬁrst man-made electromagnetic wave in his
laboratory, was not driven by any potential commercial application. His primary objective,
2Imagine a chemical laboratory without light bulbs, refrigerators, or computers!

624
Chapter 41
Misconceptions about Science
like all experimental physicists, was to prove (or disprove) the prediction of a theory; in
this case, Maxwell’s prediction.
Nowadays the funding agencies of science and their decision makers expect practical
applications (or potential for quick applications) from any scientiﬁc investigation. That is
why the National Institutes of Health receives very generous ﬁnancial allocations from the
US government, while the handful of theoretical physicists and mathematicians investigat-
ing the fundamental forces of nature are struggling for ﬁnancial survival. Yet the history
of physics reveals that the most drastic changes in our civilization arising from applied
technology were the progeny of some seemingly fruitless exercise of human curiosity.
Who could have predicted that the tinkering of the lodestone and amber of the sixteenth
century would give rise to the transmission of information over hundreds of miles in a fraction
of a second? Yet the technology of modern telecommunication is based entirely on electric
charges, conductors, wires, and magnets, the toys of the earlier practitioners of seemingly
futile exercises of human curiosity.
Quantum Physics
We now enter the twentieth century, and right at the gateway we ﬁnd the quantum idea
and a few years further the theory of relativity. As all great theories before them, these two
were molded by the human desire to answer a question, to solve a puzzle. Neither of the
two promised any entrepreneurial application. These were puzzles of the purest kind that
demanded solutions which could only come about as a result of the purest mental activity.
When Max Planck introduced quanta in 1900, he did it quite reluctantly. The sheer
incongruity of the idea, the reluctance of both Planck and the rest of the physics community,
the awe with which the truthfulness of the idea struck all the physicists of the time should
be enough evidence to convince everybody that at the time of its proposal, the quantum
idea could not and did not have any promise of application in it!
The quantum idea found its way into the structure of atoms in the work of Niels Bohr
who extended the discoveries of Planck and Einstein to an explanation of the behavior of the
hydrogen atom. Bohr’s work was so ad hoc and so strange that even the most imaginative
science ﬁction writer could not have concocted any application for it. Bohr’s only desire
was to resolve a contradiction suggested by the newly discovered nucleus of the atom.
Nuclear industry grew at a rapid pace during World War II both in Germany and in
the US. Although this growth was driven by the war eﬀorts, the discovery of the nucleus
itself was motivated by sheer curiosity. In an attempt to verify a theoretical model of the
atom, Ernest Rutherford bombarded gold atoms with highly energetic alpha particles in
1911. He was dumbfounded when his experiment showed that almost the entire weight of
the atom is concentrated in a very small region at the center of the atom. This discovery
raised some very deep questions about the stability of matter which led to one of the highest
human intellectual achievements ever.
The brain child of an international cooperation of theoretical physicists, quantum theory,
was developed in stages, and at each stage a great leap of counter-intuitive faith had to be
taken. By 1927, all the mysterious pieces of the puzzle came together to form a mathematical
structure which was logically consistent and observationally ﬂawless. However, the entire
theory was based on the notion of probability, and, as such, was immersed in a controversy
of which Einstein said “God does not play dice.” Amidst such confusion the last thing
anybody was thinking about was application! This newly opened window into the secrets of
the atomic world was showing too magniﬁcent a scenery for one’s mind to get distracted by
any entrepreneurial applications. The unraveling of this new mathematical theory and its
complete ramiﬁcation was too important for physicists to divert their thoughts to industrial
consequences of the theory. Today, as we have just crossed the exit gate of the century,
almost everything we touch in our daily lives runs on the idea of quantum.

Section 41.3
Science and Values
625
41.3
Science and Values
The confusion caused by identifying science and technology has prompted some science
critics to ridicule the notion of value-free science.3 Thus, in the introduction of his book
Value-Free Science? Robert Proctor writes:
Still we often hear that however foul its application, science itself is pure. Science may
be political in its application, but not in its origin and structure. And certainly it is
true that science and technology alone are hardly a threat to world peace. Politics and
moralities stand behind our sciences and give them life; science can be used for good or
evil. This is one sense of the “neutrality” of science—that science (or technology) “in
itself” is neither good nor bad; that science may be used or it may be abused. [Pro 91,
p. 2]
Note how the two words “science” and “technology” come together. Although the author
starts the paragraph with “science” alone, he immediately conjoins “technology” to it, and
in the last sentence, he practically equates the two by using the parenthetical phrase “or
Science and technology
are wrongly being
interchanged!
technology.” This allows the author to shift the attention from science to technology and
to cite numerous examples of its destructive (and certainly value-laden) application. The
good or bad and use or abuse are already incorporated in “technology.” Nuclear physics
is the science behind both the MRI of medicine and the bomb of the military. The latter
two are technologies, and they are by no means “neutral”: MRI is good, bomb is bad. Any
attachment of “neutrality” to technology opens the possibility of looking for something good
in a nuclear bomb!
Proctor goes on to say:
Yet this supposed neutrality describes only the simplest technologies, the most abstract
principles. The seven simple machines, perhaps, or the rules of arithmetic, may be
neutral in this sense.
But an abstract truth often conceals a concrete lie.
“Guns
don’t kill people, people kill people.” Yet is it surprising that a society that surrounds
itself with guns will use them? . . . Tools, we realize have alternative uses; the knife
bought for cooking might be used for killing. Yet knives or levers are not what modern
science-based technology is all about. A nuclear power plant, cruise missile, or linear
accelerator can hardly be used for ends other than those for which they are designed.
Science-based technologies are increasingly end-speciﬁc: the means constrain the ends;
it is no longer easy to separate the origins of a tool from its intended use. What does
it mean to “abuse” a cruise missile or a neutron bomb? [Pro 91, pp. 3–4]
Since these are typical assertions in the war against value-free science, let us analyze
them in detail so that the reader can judge whether the quote implies a value-laden science.
First let us correct the author in his favor and emphasize that even the simplest machines
Even the simplest
machines, such as a
lever or a catapult, are

are value-laden, because they are built with a human need in mind. A lever and a catapult
are technologies that are based on the simplest science,4 arithmetic. Yet one is used to
lift a boulder blocking the irrigation route of a village, and the other to hurl ﬁre to kill
the enemy. So, it is wrong to ascribe any neutrality to even the simplest machines. The
neutrality should correctly be ascribed to the science (arithmetic or algebra) behind the
technology and not to the technology itself.
Section 41.2 showed that any technological invention applies the knowledge gained
through science to create things speciﬁcally designed for human use. This principle ap-
plies to all technology, past, present, and future. The only diﬀerence is that the inventions
of thousands of years ago (simple machines) are so simple that nonscientists can under-
stand them, and, therefore, can separate them from the science of that time (arithmetic).
3In the present context, “value” refers to moral and ethical nature of science.
4The diﬀerentiation between science and math, although emphasized at the beginning of this chapter,
need not be highlighted here, as in ancient times, neither had any distinctive feature to set it apart from
the other.

626
Chapter 41
Misconceptions about Science
However, modern technology, which is based on such highly mathematical disciplines as
electromagnetic theory and quantum mechanics, is much harder to separate from the com-
plicated science that went into it.
It is not the simplicity of science that makes it neutral. General theory of relativity,
GTR, quantum ﬁeld
theory,
electromagnetism, and
Newtonian mechanics
are as neutral as
arithmetic.
quantum ﬁeld theory, electromagnetism, and Newtonian mechanics are as neutral as arith-
metic. Just as arithmetic, they are laws stated in the language of mathematics, generally
in the form of diﬀerential equations, that describe the behavior of (the constituents of) the
universe. This fact is extremely hard to understand for somebody who has not studied
these equations and their meaning, and only sees their technological applications.
Second, the often quoted sentence, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people,” is so
obvious a tautology that it is pointless. It is as pointless as saying: “Cars don’t drive, people
do,” or “Knives don’t cut, people do,” or “Pencils don’t write, people do.” It merely states
the simple fact that any machine needs an operator to operate it. There is no “abstract
truth” in this. It is as concrete as one can get! Abstract are the laws of science, and there
are no concrete lies in them. There is no concrete lie in the universal law of gravitation,
or in the four Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism, or the Schr¨odinger equation, or
Einstein’s equation of the general theory of relativity. Or the laws of thermodynamics and
chemistry. Concrete are the guns and the people who use them.
In the construction of a gun—the barrel, the ignition mechanism, the path of the bullet,
and the fabrication of its parts—the laws of motion, thermodynamics, and chemistry may
have been used, but these same laws are also used to operate a respirator or a pacemaker.
Guns, being the product of a technology motivated, ﬁnanced, and encouraged by war, were
made with no other purpose in mind than to kill. We did not invent the gun with which to
brush our teeth! A lot of values, ethics, morality (or lack thereof) has gone into the building
of a gun. An abstract truth which conceals no concrete lie is the following statement:
Box 41.3.1. The laws of physics and chemistry don’t kill people, guns do.
This statement captures the essence of the diﬀerence between technology (guns) and science
(the laws of physics and chemistry), a diﬀerence that is overlooked by most critics of science.
Third, the relation between ancient science and ancient technology is identical to the
relation between modern science and modern technology. Tools, whether invented by a
homo erectus, an ancient Egyptian, or a Medieval artisan, are as science-based as the laser
used in LASEK; and they are as much a part of technology as cruise missiles and power
plants. Knife, at the time of its invention in the Bronze Age, required as much cutting-edge5
science as laser did a few decades ago. And as it was built to replace the old Stone-Age
sharp stones, knife was as end-speciﬁc as a nuclear power plant, a cruise missile, or a linear
accelerator: it was meant to kill and cut with not to cook with!
A nuclear power plant is a “tool” that uses the abstract principles of physics—such as

for the production of a
cruise missile as much as

ago.
E = mc2—to produce electricity for consumption. It comes out of a branch of technology,
and, therefore, is not science! A cruise missile is nothing but a gloriﬁed gun. To it also
applies the statement of Box 41.3.1. It is a destructive power which was developed with
the clear intention of annihilating buildings and human beings. We can blame science for
its production as much as we can blame arithmetic for the production of simple “war”
machines of 2000 years ago such as catapults.
A linear accelerator is of a completely diﬀerent nature. Although a substantial amount
of advanced technology is used in its construction, it is not designed to produce anything for
human consumption, and certainly not for his annihilation. It is a machine that probes the
structure of matter to a deeper and deeper level. One can say that it is a huge microscope
5No pun intended!

Section 41.3

627
capable of “seeing” subatomic particles. Why the author puts linear accelerators alongside
power plants and cruise missiles is unclear.
We have already seen how the author starts with a sentence containing “science” alone,
but, to show its value-ladenness, he switches to “technology” in the next sentence. The
farther we read in the book, the more it becomes clear that science and technology are used
interchangeably. The following quote is an extreme case of this mix-up, in which the word
“science” is used instead of “technology:”
According to one common sense of science, however, politics or values are only to be
found external to the practice of science—in its uses but not its origin, in its failures
but not its triumphs, in the exceptional or the peripheral but not in the everyday and
fundamental. This is the ideology of pure or value-free science, the belief that science
“in itself” is pure and that values or politics enter only as contamination.
. . . And yet the myth confronts a reality: science throughout the modern world is
recognized as a vital part of industrial and military production. [Pro 91, pp. 3–4]
The “science” in the second paragraph is really “technology!” String theory, gauge theory,
quantum chromodynamics, and inﬂationary cosmology, some of the sciences of our day, are
not, by any stretch of imagination, “part of industrial and military production.”
Box 41.3.2. The complexity of both modern technology and modern science has caused
many critics, unfamiliar with either, to confuse the two, equate science with technol-
ogy and assign “value” to both. Our discussion in this section has shown that while
technology is loaded with value, science is completely value-free.


Chapter42
Characteristics of Science
One of the goals of this book, as implied by its subtitle, is to promote scientiﬁc awareness
and literacy and to combat irrationality. To do so, it has to fully explain the inner workings
and characteristics of rationality. As the epitome of rationality, science can be an eﬀective
sword in the battle against all forms of irrational thinking. And as the epitome of science,
physics can make this sword razor sharp. What are some of the characteristics of science?
42.1
Science Studies Matter
Materiality is one of the most distinguishing characteristics of science. Starting with Galileo
and his inclined planes and blocks or balls, meeting along the way Maxwell and his electro-
magnetic ﬁelds, and ﬁnally ending with the most exotic subatomic particles such as quarks
and gluons or the gigantic black holes billions of times heavier than Sun, physics exclusively
studies material objects. And yes, ﬁelds are as material as atoms, molecules, billiard balls,
and SUVs (see Section 15.4)! Take the EM ﬁeld, which consists of photons; the materiality
of photons has been established not only by the kicks and nudges they impart on other par-
ticles, but also by their capacity to turn into other particles such as electrons and positrons
[see Figure 32.4(d)]. Despite the claim of some advocates of the alternative medicine
Box 42.1.1. Everything that physics—both classical and modern—studies, including
ﬁelds and waves, is material. Nonmaterial objects have no place in physics.
Materiality is not conﬁned to physics. In fact, one can say that the form of matter

determines the branch of science: atoms and subatomic particles are studied in atomic,
nuclear, and particle physics; molecules are studied in chemistry; the matter of life, DNA,
is the subject of biology; a piece of bone in the hands of a paleontologist tells a story of
our prehistoric past; a pot or a tablet in the hands of an archaeologist tells of our past
civilizations; geology studies Earth; astrophysics studies stars; cosmology studies galaxies
and the universe itself.
No science deals with nonmaterial notions such as the id, ego, and superego of psy-
choanalysis, the subluxation of chiropractic, the Qi of acupuncture, or the energy ﬁeld of
therapeutic touch. The popularity of these pseudoscientiﬁc disciplines is a sad testimony
to the preponderance of irrationality in our modern society. To see the power of rational
thinking, let us go back to ancient Greece.

Chapter 42
Characteristics of Science
42.1.1
Materialistic Philosophy
Science is the modern discipline in which matter has a primary position. There was also a
time in antiquity when some philosophers insisted on the primacy of “matter” and on the
role of the senses as the gateway to knowledge. This materialistic philosophy led them
to conclude that the outside world has to stimulate the senses by some kind of material
agent originating from the source of the stimulation. And since we don’t see these agents,
Materialistic philosophy

they must be so tiny as to be invisible to the human eye. They called them atoms.
The ﬁrst person to systematically analyze and popularize the theory of atoms is Dem-
ocritus of Abdera (ca. 460 BC–370 BC). However, Democritus’ materialistic philosophy
was incomplete because it only considered atoms. A true philosophy was to put mankind
into the equation as well. It became the task of one of the greatest philosophers of antiquity,
Epicurus (341–270 BC), to dovetail the atoms and the human experience and create the
most remarkable philosophical system of his time.
Although he wrote more than any philosopher before him, very few of Epicurus’ writings
have come down to us in their original form. Aside from a number of fragments, only three
letters to his disciples have survived. The best introduction to Epicurus’ Canonic—a set
of rules by which Epicurus formulated his philosophy—is a passage by Cicero, the Roman
statesman, orator, and philosopher, who was a hostile critic of Epicurean philosophy. He
abolishes deﬁnitions, Cicero complains, he has nothing to say about how reasoning is carried
out and conclusions reached; he has nothing to say about how sophisms may be resolved
and ambiguities cleared up. He places the criteria of reality in the senses [Use 87].
But it is precisely this placement of “the criteria of reality in the senses” that makes
the Epicurean doctrine so akin to modern science. Listen to what Epicurus says in a letter
How Epicureanism and
science are alike!
to Herodotus: “For the similarity between the things. . . which we call real and the images
received as a likeness of things and produced either in sleep or through some other acts of
apprehension on the part of the mind, . . . could never be, unless there were some eﬄuences
of this nature actually brought into contact with our senses” [Wea 87, p. 312]. Then a little
after he demonstrates that hearing is caused by currents which “split up into particles,” he
gives this remarkable passage, which might as well have been written by a modern chemist:
“Furthermore, we must suppose that smell too, just like hearing, could never bring about
any sensation, unless there were certain particles carried oﬀfrom the object of suitable size
to stir this sense-organ . . . .”
Food for Thought

is by no means accurate. Similarly, the impressions we get from our social and political environment
may not be accurate. If we truly grasp this simple fact, it will become much easier to overcome the
prejudices and preconceptions we so tightly hold on to. It will make us wonder whether the picture
of people we have constructed in our mind—because of the color of their skin or the language they
speak or the culture in which they are raised—is the real picture. The history of the world is ﬁlled
with occurrences of prejudice and injustice, sometimes even backed by the residing government.
Here is one example.
For almost 300 years the political structure in South Africa fed its citizens only information
suited for the survival of apartheid. Thus, a white child “learned” from the beginning that she

was superior to all blacks, that it was quite natural for blacks to have separate buses, that it was
unthinkable for blacks to participate in any decision-making process. Only a costly upheaval, a
renaissance in the mentality of the people of South Africa, both white and black, a revolution in
the political order was capable of turning the society around and teaching the population of all
colors that the picture drawn in the minds of most people by the apartheid was a distorted picture,
and that the real picture gives blacks, whites, and people of diﬀerent colors equal weight in social
status.

Therefore, we ought to take this basic lesson of scientiﬁc methodology to heart and remember
that just as our senses are imperfect instruments and cannot reveal the true picture of reality,
so are our impressions of the society in which we live.
The picture of the latter is even more
distorted because it passes through numerous ﬁlters including tradition, media, advertising, and
entertainment industry, many of which have a single goal: to make a proﬁt.
By far, the most comprehensive account of Epicurean philosophy is a book of Latin
poems called De rerum natura—or The Nature of Things—written by Titus Lucretius
Carus who lived from about 95 to 55 BC There have been many translations of these poems
in English, of which the most noteworthy is that written by Lucy Hutchinson (1620–1664),
a seventeenth century woman of British nobility, who lived in an era when the science of
physics was beginning to emerge, and the notion of atoms and their motion became popular
again. Lucretius, as the only authentic Epicurean philosopher, came to be the hero of this
popular culture. However, due to the intense negative publicity of the Church, Lucretius
was made into a blemished hero. The rumors, spread by the foes of Epicureans, were so
strong that even those who admired Lucretius routinely accepted his “madness.” It is in
this vein that Lucy Hutchinson, who so marvelously translated Lucretius’ poems, casually
adds a marginal note to her translation informing the reader: “Here is one of the Poets
abrupt Hiatus for he was mad with a Philtrum his wife gave him and writt this booke but
in the intervalls of his phrenzie” [Hut 96, p. 55].
Let us see what Lucretius has to say about “things” in his poems. We quote a few
passages from Hutchinson’s translation [Hut 96] because of its clarity, its sincerity, and its
poetic character. On page 33 of this book, we ﬁnd the following passage, which could be
thought of as a version of the modern scientiﬁc principle of conservation of energy and
matter:
“God never aniething of nothing made;
But soe are mortall men restreind with dread,
As seing severall works in heaven and earth,
And ignorant of the cause that gives them birth,
They thinke a power devine brings forth those things;”
To convince the reader of the existence of atoms, Lucretius gives the following persuasive
argument on page 36:
“Yet least my sayings ﬁnd no faith with you,
Because ﬁrst bodies1 are from outward view
Concealed, attend and you your selfe shall learne
There are some bodies eies cannot discerne.
The wind ruﬂes the clouds, beats on the sands,
Overwhelms tall ships, and passing through the land
Strews it with torne up trees, the groves destroys
And rages through the hills with horrid noyse
. . . . . .
And yet the winds concealed bodies be
Which passe unseene through heaven, earth and sea;”
The Epicurean material analysis of the universe led to some uncomfortable (but accu-
rate) interpretations of nonmaterial phenomena. Epicureans felt that superstition was the
main cause of human misery, and did everything to eliminate it. This brought them face

to face with the established religion of the time, and on a collision course with the Greek
gods. Likewise, in his material analysis of love, Lucretius was led to human physiology, and
came frighteningly close to the modern chemical and hormonal explanation of that feeling.
Such an interpretation was, of course, dangerously ahead of its time and was considered

attack the contemporary scientiﬁc medicine for its attempts at understanding the material

these New Agers are turning the wheel of progress back to pre-golden era of the Greek
civilization; to a time when the “good spirits” in the teachings of Qi and Ayurveda were
summoned to get rid of the “bad spirits” in a patient.
42.2
Science Trusts Only Observation
The study of matter starts with observation. Scientiﬁc statements are summaries of ob-
servations made (sometimes over many generations). Never in the history of science does
one encounter a “decree” that is not suggested by observation. A claim that connects a
disease with an imbalance in some unobservable “energy ﬁeld,” or with a pinched nerve
in the spine, or an invisible imponderable Qi, or an ad hoc nonmaterial triad of id, ego,
and superego is as scientiﬁc as the tribal claim that connects a disease with the evil spirits.
Neither has any observational support whatsoever.
Food for Thought
FFT 42.2.1. Over 23 centuries have passed since the great Epicurus took his last breath, and
less than ﬁve centuries since his method of thinking and discovery were revived, and with this
revival, an explosion of human knowledge ensued. One can only wonder why humankind abandoned

such a natural habit of placing observation (or sensation) on top of all other means of gathering
information. Some people hold the Medieval Church responsible for the “darkness” of that Age.
This, then, begs the question “Why did people allow this to happen?” The answer may lie in what
happened between the Golden Age of Greece, and the Dark Ages of Europe.
Whatever the reason for this long stupor of humankind, our present world might have been
unrecognizably more advanced had the teachings of Epicurus been the guiding light of our ancestors.
It is quite possible that we would have had a Newton by the fourth century AD and an Einstein
by the sixth. Then today we would be living in a society that will be possible only 14 centuries
from now—if we don’t fall into another Dark Age!
History can teach us a lot of good lessons only if we can recognize the present analog of forces
that hindered the progress of the past. These forces come in shapes and forms that may appear
completely diﬀerent from their historical ancestors. During the Dark Ages, the center of hindrance
was cathedrals and royal palaces. Where do we have to look for these centers today? Are they
still in the more decentralized institution of religion? Or in the corporate headquarters of giant
broadcasting companies that decide what to tell the society and what not to? Or in the educa-
tional system where “social intelligence” and “social promotion” of pupils replace their satisfactory
performance in the lower grade? Or in the schools of education whose faculty’s response to the
repeated failure of the nation’s students in international mathematics and physics competition is
“[students] need to know how to decide which life insurance to buy, how pesticides aﬀect their
food and how interest rates aﬀect home mortgages?” [NYT 98] Or in the community of “science

border of science and non-science, and as a result, some authors ﬁnd common grounds for physics

exist an observation that is detached from the repertoire of valid scientiﬁc theories. Some
philosophers of science believe in the complete separation of observation and theories. They
think that “theory-laden” observations are invalid.
But that is not how science works.

Section 42.3
Continuity of Science
633
Science is full of examples in which the very device that is used to make an observation is
based on the earlier theoretical works. For example, a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)
spectrometer that chemists use to analyze the molecular structure of substances (thereby,
testing the quantum theory that describes the molecules) is built using the guidelines of the
quantum theory.
Many observations are indirect. To test a theory by experimentation or observation,

one may look for evidence and clues related to (but not necessarily identiﬁed with) the
prediction of the theory. It is impossible to test the theory of the creation of Sun, because
it occurred only once. And if we insist that “unless science can create a Sun, anything
it says about the Sun is just speculation,” we are closing our eyes to all the advances we
have made in the science of astrophysics. If the theory predicts a multitude of features and
properties of Sun that are observable now, and if all present observations agree with those
predictions, then the theory is observationally tested.
42.3
Continuity of Science
No science is the creation of a single man or a single age. Newton could not have solved the
mystery of gravitation without the works of Galileo and Kepler; and the latter could not
have made their contributions without the observations of Tycho Brahe and the theoretical
work of Copernicus. And Copernicus could not have revolutionized human thought had he
not studied the work of ancient astronomers. Einstein’s theory of relativity of 1905 depends
crucially on Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of 1865, which in turn was based on the work
of such people as Coulomb, Gauss, ¨Orsted, and Faraday, spanning over ﬁve decades of
hard work. And the earliest work on electromagnetism by Coulomb is directly connected
to Newton’s laws of motion of 1666.
Any scientiﬁc discipline has a body of interconnected knowledge accumulated over many
generations of scientists, on which all specialists of that discipline agree; and any new
knowledge that is to be added to that body uses all or part of the existing knowledge.
No discovery or advancement of science exists in history that is isolated from the existing
body of knowledge. A discoverer of DNA must know the structure of the chromosomes; the
discoverer of chromosomes must know the structure of the nucleus of a cell; the discoverer
of the nucleus of the cell must know the structure of the cell; the discoverer of the cell must
have a microscope in his possession. Thus, the science of the 1950s becomes continuously
connected to the science of the 1660s.
Box 42.3.1. A discipline in which the previous generation of its practitioners pro-
pose theories which are trampled by the current generation, whose theories are in turn
trampled by the future generation, is not science.
In the popular expositions of physics it is often asserted that modern physics has replaced
or undermined the classical physics of Newton and Galileo. They give the impression that
Relativity could not have

modern and classical physics have nothing in common, or worse, that they are in conﬂict
with one another. Nothing is further from the truth! A new theory, as revolutionary and
as radical as it may seem, simply extends the old theory into domains where the latter
fails. In fact, in arriving at the new theory, the old theory is always a crucial guideline; and
the commonality of the two theories can be shown by applying them to the domain of the
validity of the old theory and seeing that both give identical results.
Consider, as an example, the Newtonian and the relativistic theories of motion. The lat-

ter is dependent on the former in two ways. First, relativity is a logical necessity of Maxwell’s
prediction of the electromagnetic waves (see Section 25.2 for details); and Maxwell’s equa-
tions were derived using experiments involving forces on electric charges and currents that

634
Chapter 42
Characteristics of Science
obeyed Newtonian laws of motion. So in this sense, there is a direct link between relativity
and Newtonian physics.
Second, when Einstein tried to write equations governing the motion of relativistic parti-
cles under the inﬂuence of forces, he realized that all he had to do was to copy the Newtonian
second law of motion in a way that was consistent with relativity. And in his general theory
of relativity, at a crucial step in deriving Einstein’s equation, he had to use the Newtonian
law of gravity.
As we have seen in Part VI, relativity is the physics of objects that move close to light
speed. For such speeds, Newtonian theory fails while Einstein’s theory of relativity prevails.
Relativity becomes
identical to classical
physics when it is
applied to objects that
move slowly!
This is as expected, because at the time of Newton, no observational evidence pointed to
the uniqueness and universality of the speed of light. Furthermore, all observable speeds
were signiﬁcantly smaller than the speed of light, whose magnitude was not within the reach
of the technology of the time. The theory of relativity, on the other hand, was built on the
assumption that the speed of light is a special speed, beyond which no object is capable of
moving. Nevertheless, when the objects under consideration by relativity are moving with
very small velocities (small compared with the speed of light), the theory turns into the
Newtonian theory, and the two theories become one and the same!
The development of the quantum theory is also vitally tied to the Newtonian physics.
When Bohr applied the quantum hypothesis of Planck and Einstein to the hydrogen atom,
he used Newtonian second law of motion verbatim!
(See Section 21.3 and Math Notes
E.21.1 and E.21.2 for details.) Bohr model of the hydrogen atom was indispensable for the
quantum theory of Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg. Moreover, the master equation of quantum
theory, the Schr¨odinger equation, owes its existence to such quantities as momentum, kinetic
energy, and potential energy, all of which are genuinely Newtonian concepts. For example,
we have seen (see Section 8.1.1 and Math Note E.8.1) how the concept of kinetic energy is
a direct consequence of Newton’s second law of motion. Therefore, we can say without any
hesitation that
Box 42.3.2. If Newtonian theory had not existed, the two pillars of modern physics,
relativity and quantum theory, could not have been discovered.
This captures the essence of the continuity of science.
A number of authors have tried to take advantage of the diﬀerence between the New-
tonian and quantum theory to advance their philosophical agenda. They have attributed
to the old theory such pretentiously negative qualities as “mechanistic,” “Cartesian,” and
“linear,” while the new quantum theory is given such New Agedly positive attributes as
“holistic” and “universal.” They hide the fact that the “holistic” theory could not have
been discovered without the aid of the “mechanistic” theory, and that when applied to the
same objects for which the Newtonian theory is good, “holistic” theory becomes just as
mechanistic and Cartesian.
The continuity and interconnectedness of scientiﬁc ideas is the reason that they are
usually discovered simultaneously and independently by more than one scientist.
The body of theories and experimental results is available to all practitioners of a scientiﬁc
ﬁeld, and it is very common for a few people trying to solve the unique enigma of the
time to hit upon the same idea. The universal law of gravitation was suggested not only by
Newton, but also by some of his contemporaries. The special theory of relativity, credited to
Einstein, was also discovered by the great French mathematician Henri Poincar´e. Likewise,

in a recently discovered manuscript of the noted German mathematician David Hilbert,
there appears an equation, which we now call Einstein’s equation of the general theory of
relativity. In fact, the date of the manuscript was so close to the date of Einstein’s GTR
paper that it took historians many days to settle the question of “Who discovered GTR
ﬁrst?” in favor of Einstein.

Section 42.4
Science Is Detached from the Scientist
635
42.4
Science Is Detached from the Scientist
Because science is based on (and explains the results of) observations of nature, and since
nature is detached from the scientist, scientiﬁc ideas and discoveries are also detached from
the discoverers. The universal law of gravity, although discovered by Newton, has absolutely
no mark of Newton’s personality on it. It is an abstract mathematical statement about the
behavior of the universe under the inﬂuence of one of the fundamental forces of nature that
we call gravity. Students learning about gravity may know nothing (in fact, almost always
they do not) about Newton’s biography or the original work in which gravity was explained.
A remarkable example of this detachment of the discovery from the discoverer is the
Schr¨odinger equation. This equation was discovered in January of 1926 by the Austrian

physicist Erwin Schr¨odinger, who also solved it to obtain a successful description of the hy-
drogen atom. As a result of this solution, Schr¨odinger found a mathematical entity whose
correct interpretation demanded some very intense intellectual exercise. Schr¨odinger him-
self wanted to interpret this mathematical entity—what we called the Ψ function in Section
22.3—as a so-called “matter wave.” This interpretation, however, could not explain the
observational results satisfactorily. The correct interpretation was given in June 1926 by
the German physicist, Max Born, who proposed that the mathematical entity should be
interpreted as “probability waves.” Schr¨odinger, a determinist who abhorred the notion
of probability and indeterminacy, is said to have remarked that had he known the conse-
quences, he might not have written his paper. We now know that Born was right and the
Schr¨odinger equation has been completely detached from Schr¨odinger!
The detachment of science from the scientist completely eliminates the possibility of an
“authority ﬁgure” in science. There are no “gurus” and “followers” in science. If physicists
followed Einstein, it was because his theories were correct, and he happened to have a
remarkable aﬃnity with nature and its secrets. As soon as he proved to be wrong (as in his
insistence on keeping probability out of quantum theory) his followers declined considerably.
Because of this lack of authority ﬁgure, when giants of science die, there is no dispute,
disagreement, feud, and factional in-ﬁghting among the scientists.
The independence of science from the scientist is also called the objectivity of science.
However, many “postmodern” philosophers of science argue that such an objectivity does
not exist; that not only is science attached to the scientist that discovers it, but also to the
“disciples” of the discoverer; that diﬀerent groups of scientists believe in diﬀerent scientiﬁc
knowledge, and there is no way to tell who is right. Such an attitude towards scientiﬁc
knowledge started in the 1960s, and one of the most inﬂuential proponents of this attitude
is Thomas Kuhn.
In his trend-setting book The Structure of Scientiﬁc Revolutions, Thomas Kuhn argues

that scientists accept new theories2 only through persuasion and argumentation.
Kuhn
believes that the only way that a theory could be accepted unequivocally is by a formal
“proof;” and since no theory can be proven (all theories are “underdetermined” as discussed
in Section 5.3), the acceptance of a theory by the scientiﬁc community must be done by
persuasion [Kuh 96, p. 152]. And since persuasion is a subjective act, science cannot be
objective.
This, like any other philosophy of science, completely overlooks the role and the con-
vincing power of observation.
Philosophers of science scarcely mention observation and
experimentation in their analyses. Yet it is only observation that can “persuade” a scientist
to accept a theory (or paradigm, as Kuhn calls it). A thousand scientists have less persuasive
power on a fellow scientist than a single observation. Of course, a trillion observations can-
not form a “proof” demanded by underdeterminists. Nevertheless, a single experiment, such
as Rutherford’s 1911 experiment showing the existence of the atomic nucleus, is suﬃcient
proof for Niels Bohr to change his mind about the nature of the hydrogen atom and suggest

observational machines, and chooses mathematics as her language of communication.

42.5
Reductionism and Science
The act of observation with the aim of gathering useful information is, of necessity, also an
act of reduction. In the course of our journey through physics, we learned at every step
that great and universal discoveries were made when the discoverer studied a very speciﬁc
system:
• Aristarchus discovered the universal heliocentrism by asking a very speciﬁc question:
“What is the distance between the Earth and the Sun?”
• Galileo discovered the universal ﬁrst law of motion by studying a very speciﬁc system:
an inclined plane with blocks sliding on it. This law now applies to the motion of any
object from a molecule to a galaxy.
• Kepler discovered the universal laws of planetary motion by studying a very speciﬁc
system: Mars and Sun. His laws apply not only to all planets in the solar system,
but to anything that moves around a center of gravity such as the dark matter, which
was discovered using these laws.
• Newton discovered the laws of motion and the universal law of gravity by studying a
very speciﬁc system: Earth, Moon, and an apple. Newton’s laws are valid not only
for the motion of the Moon and the apple, but for any motion.3
• Maxwell discovered the universal electromagnetic waves by studying the very speciﬁc
equations of electricity and magnetism. The EM waves are now the only source of
information we obtain from every cosmic object.
• Planck discovered the universal quantum nature of the electromagnetic waves by
studying the very speciﬁc process of EM wave production through heat.
• Einstein discovered the truly universal theory of relativity by asking a very speciﬁc
question: “How do Maxwell’s equations look like in a moving reference frame?”
• Schr¨odinger and Heisenberg discovered the quantum theory by studying a very speciﬁc
and very simple system: the hydrogen atom. Quantum theory is now so universal that
solids, liquids, gases, plasmas, or any other form of matter are accurately described
by it; the entire discipline of chemistry is based on it; even the secret of life itself may
eventually be unraveled by a “quantum mechanical” treatment of DNA.
• Dirac discovered the universal notion of antimatter by asking a very speciﬁc question:
“How do we combine special relativity and quantum theory?”
• Einstein and Friedmann discovered the universal big bang by asking a very speciﬁc
question: “What happens if we apply the general theory of relativity to an isotropic
and homogeneous gas?”

merous to list—on purpose? Do physicists have a “holistic choice” but they just ignore it?
No! Physicists are forced to study speciﬁc systems and seek answers to speciﬁc questions,
because a single physicist—even a single generation of physicists—is incapable of studying
the entire holistic universe. Every era concentrates on some speciﬁc unanswered questions
left behind by the discoveries of the previous era.
Reductionism4 is a hallmark of not just physics, but of all sciences.
It gave us the
amazing materialistic philosophy and its ancient atomic theory 25 centuries ago. At the
turn of the nineteenth century it showed up again as modern atomic theory, when chemists
tried to make sense out of chemical reactions. The success of modern atomic theory in
chemistry prompted many physicists to take the notion of an atom seriously and to “reduce”
a thermodynamic system to a collection of “particles” obeying the laws of mechanics. This
led to the new branch of physics and chemistry, statistical mechanics, which clariﬁed many
of the hitherto mysterious notions of thermodynamics.
The physicists’ scrutiny of the simplest atom, hydrogen, led to the discovery of the
quantum theory, which in principle could explain the behavior of more complex atoms
and molecules. Chemistry has become the science of molecules using the quantum theory.
All the miraculous advances in modern chemistry are the results of the concentration of
chemists on the study of molecules.
Biology has also been “reducing.” The true study of life started with the discovery that

all living objects are made up of cells. Once the nucleus of the cell was discovered and
the complex structure inside it revealed, it became the subject of biologists’ study. Today,
biologists agree that the “unit” of life is a very large molecule called DNA, and to unravel
the secret of life we have to understand this molecule. So chemistry, and ultimately physics,
become the tools for understanding life.
Some science critics take the last sentence above to mean “physics alone can explain
life;” that if you ﬁnd the laws of physics governing the fundamental particles, you don’t

need to do anything else to understand DNA. This is, of course, a completely erroneous
statement. Physics to a biologist or chemist is like a ship to a sailor. The ship by itself is not
suﬃcient to discover new lands. You have to be an expert navigator, with a lot of knowledge
about maps, geography, astronomy, and of course, how to sail a ship, to be able to discover
new lands. Similarly, physics is only the beginning—but a necessary beginning—of the
understanding of molecules. A (bio)chemist has to know the structure of the atoms, the
conﬁguration of their constituents, any special features they may possess, how they interact
with one another, and of course how to use quantum physics, to be able to understand the
molecule formed from the atoms. Although the study of life can be reduced to the study of
the atoms making up the DNA molecule, it is not reduced to such a study in isolation.
42.5.1
The Whole and Its Parts
The recent holistic “school” of science has not come out of science itself, but imposed on
it from outside.
Certain philosophers and mystics, borrowing from Eastern mysticism,

combined with a misinterpretation of modern physics (see Chapter 35), have come up with
a “holistic” prognosis for science. They argue that “the whole is more than just the sum
of its parts,” and conclude that reductionism is wrong; that science should abandon its
reductionist approach. A scientist (a reductionist) does not refute the statement; he refutes
the conclusion. As mentioned above, understanding a molecule involves more than just a
4Reductionism is sometimes referred to as “fundamentalism” by some philosophers of science. We have
already pointed out how important “fundamentalism” has been in the development of science (see, e.g.,
Sections 20.2.2 and 33.2.2).

638
Chapter 42
Characteristics of Science
knowledge of the atoms of which it consists. But without an understanding of the atoms
making up a molecule, you cannot understand the molecule itself. Atoms form the main
part of the many ingredients that are combined to form a molecule.
Statistical mechanics can further elucidate the diﬀerence between a holist and a reduc-
tionist take on the above statement. When you put a large number of particles together to
form a thermodynamic system, statistical mechanics assigns a probability to every state of
that system, and if you know this probability, you can predict every property of the system;
i.e., you know the “whole.” But, this probability depends crucially on the energy of each
individual particle and how it interacts with the rest of the particles in the system (see
Sections 17.2.2 and 19.3). In other words, if you don’t know the properties of the individual
“parts,” you cannot know the bulk properties of the “whole.” Therefore,
Box 42.5.1. Although the whole is more than the sum of its parts, if you don’t know
the parts, you cannot know the whole.
A good example of the relevance of the statement in Box 42.5.1 is electrical conductivity.
Electrical conductivity of
the “whole” can only be
explained by the
quantum physics of its
“parts.”
In relation to this property, materials are divided into three major categories: conductors
oﬀer very little resistance to the motion of charges; insulators do not allow charges to
move in them; and semiconductors conduct electricity only when heated up. For a long
time the conducting property of materials remained a mystery until the discovery of the
quantum theory and the understanding of the atomic structure of materials. Only through a
good understanding of the atoms have physicists been able to explain electrical conductivity.
Here is another “wholistic” question that can be answered only through an understand-
ing of the parts: Why does water dissolve salt but not oil? A water molecule consists of
one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms. The chemists have shown that because of the atomic
structure of H and O, the most stable conﬁguration of the water molecule is when the three
atoms form a triangle. This leads to a polarization of water molecule (i.e., the center of
the positive charges in the nuclei and the negative charges of the electrons are separated).
Because of this polarization, certain molecules like salt split into positive and negative ions
when mixed with water, and the ions are attracted to the two ends of the water molecules
due to the electrical attraction. Other molecules like oil are too tightly bound for water
molecule to split them.
42.6
Commonality of Instrumentation
If science deals with matter and is based on observation, there should be a similarity among
the instruments used for observing the material structure of the objects of various branches
of science, as long as the circumstances of observation are the same. For example, the same
kind of machine that was used in the early 1900s to discover the arrangement of atoms in
a crystal was also used in the mid 1900s to discover the arrangement of atoms in a DNA
molecule.
The era of (crude) observation, which started the scientiﬁc age and was done by human
senses, is over. Science has become exceptionally reﬁned, demanding extraordinary means
for the perusal of matter.
If you go to any scientiﬁc laboratory, as large as a particle
accelerator—measuring kilometers in diameter—or as small as a high school chemistry lab,
you will see microscopes, telescopes, recording machines, etc., of various sizes and shapes
built for a single purpose: to “see” matter at diﬀerent levels of structure.
A non-scientiﬁc discipline has no (does not need) instruments; and if it does, they have

machine has little inﬂuence on the course of action taken by the practitioner.
42.7
Reproducibility?
In the nineteenth century, when chemistry became the dominant science of the time, and
most of physics could be performed on a table top, the notion of reproducibility—that all
scientists equipped with the same apparatus, and arranging the same experimental set-up,
should be able to get the same result out of the same table-top experiment—became a
primary characteristic of science.
Although all scientists still embrace the opportunity to reproduce scientiﬁc results, they
realize that the narrow-minded interpretation of reproducibility is not (cannot be) possible.
By the narrow-minded interpretation we mean the kind of reproducibility advocated by the
creation “scientists.” To be convinced of the theories of evolution and big bang, creationists
settle for nothing less than the recreation of man or the universe in a laboratory!
Reproducibility, in its more sensible connotation, refers to the reenactment of obser-
vation. If one observer looks at Sun and draws scientiﬁc conclusions about it, the same
conclusions should also be the result of the observation by another observer on the other
side of the globe. And if the theory tells us that at such and such stage of the development
of Sun, such and such phenomena must have taken place, a rational person cannot expect
the claimer to create a Sun to conﬁrm his claims! There are many other ways of testing the
claim; for example, by creating—on a small scale in the laboratory—the physical conditions
prevalent at that particular stage of Sun’s development; or by looking for stars similar to
Sun, but younger in age. This is precisely what is being done in laboratories and obser-
vatories around the world; and this is how the entire fabric of science is so strongly held
together.


Chapter43
Science versus Pseudoscience
There are many disciplines that use techniques that appear to be scientiﬁc. For example, we
have already mentioned the use of statistics in a business adventure or a survey. Although
the media report these as “scientiﬁc,” neither the surveyors nor the actuaries of the business
consider themselves scientists. Such endeavors, while resulting in useful knowledge, have no
claim to science.
However, there are other activities that have nothing in common with science, yet their
practitioners insist or imply that those activities are scientiﬁc. What is worse, somehow
the society has accepted their claims, and the practitioners obtain licenses for the practice
of their activities! Examples of these activities are all branches of alternative medicine,1
psychoanalysis,2 and intelligent design (formerly called creation science). There are also
activities that, although not classiﬁed (or claimed) as science, have implications that tres-
pass into the scientiﬁc territories. Examples of this category of activities are the claim that
we have been visited by aliens riding unidentiﬁed ﬂying objects, all psychic phenomena,
and faith healing. We study the nature of all these activities under the general heading of
pseudoscience, and in the next section list some of its characteristics.
43.1
Some Characteristics of Pseudoscience
Just as science has characteristics that distinguish it from other human enterprises, pseudo-
science also has certain characteristics that, in comparison with those of science, will help
us identify it. We shall ﬁrst list these characteristics and then look at some pseudoscientiﬁc
disciplines in some detail.
43.1.1
Observation and Reinterpretation
A common characteristic of all forms of pseudoscience is that unlike science, their claims are
not based on observation and material evidence, but on authority, hearsay, and unauthen-
ticated reports. Take the example of UFOs. Although there have been countless reports
of UFO sightings, and many “ﬁrst-hand” observers of them, not a single one of them has
been accompanied by hard evidence: an extraterrestrial vehicle, a watch, a camera, a piece
of clothing, or a toy.
All stories of the encounters of various kinds involve one or two

tellers adhere to. Her forecast is based entirely on these rules, and no amount of observation
will change them. These rules may have been originated decades or even hundreds of years
ago. In fact, the older these rules are the more “authentic” they appear to be. Psychoan-
alysts refer to the “original” books written by the gurus of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud
and Carl Jung. They are the masters, the experts, the “authority.” Creation scientists
refer to the Bible for clues. This book is the authority, the ultimate source of knowledge.
Everything we want to know and will ever want to know is in there.
But why do pseudoscientists have to keep returning to the authority?
The answer
is simple: In light of new observation and evidence, the “rules of the game” need to be
reinterpreted. And what better place to look for new interpretation than the original “au-
thoritative” source. While for scientists observation becomes the ultimate authority and
Reinterpretation is the

theories are modiﬁed or replaced to agree with observation, pseudoscientists maintain the
old statements of their authorities, but give new meanings to those statements as the occa-
sion arises.
Thus, if the book says that the universe was created in six “days,” and modern evidence
points to the formation of stars and galaxies that take millions of years, then the word
“days” becomes symbolic and could be equated to millions and billions of years. And if the
psychoanalytic theory of Oedipus complex fails the test of observation and experimentation
conducted on many children, psychoanalysts ascribe new meaning to Freud’s writings on
this subject.
43.1.2
Falsiﬁability
Perhaps the most important diﬀerence between science and pseudoscience is the testability
of their claims. The claims of science are testable (or falsiﬁable); those of pseudoscience are
not. A very simple-minded (but illustrative) example of a nonfalsiﬁable statement, which—
when cast in a more elaborate form—is not unlike statements made by pseudoscientists is:
“Ghosts exist, but cannot be observed or studied by a scientist or a disbeliever.” Obviously,
such a statement cannot possibly be tested.
Here is a more subtle example of the unfalsiﬁability of pseudoscientiﬁc statements. Uri
Geller, a psychic claiming to have supernatural power in the 1970s, was once invited to
appear on the Tonight Show to demonstrate his paranormal ability. He had claimed that
he could read people’s minds, bend spoons and keys by merely rubbing them, determine
the content of a container without looking inside, to name a few. On the advice of James
Randi, a magician and debunker of claims of paranormal, Johnny Carson, the host of the
show, took every precaution to ensure that the psychic had no access to the props prior to
his appearance. Thus, the crew of the show had put some drawings in sealed envelopes, and
had ﬁlled a few containers among many with water and covered them tight before Uri Geller
appeared on the show. When presented with this set of objects, Uri Geller was incapable
of predicting the subjects of the drawings or identifying the containers with water. Feeling
embarrassed, his only response was “I am always capable of mind reading, spoon bending,
and predicting the contents of containers without looking at them. However, tonight I feel
pressured, and only momentarily I have lost my powers.” There is simply no way that this
statement can be tested or falsiﬁed.
43.1.3
Abusing Limitation of Science
Another important diﬀerence between science and pseudoscience, related to falsiﬁability, is
that science carries the burden of proof of its claims while pseudoscience places this burden

on science. And because the proof entails demonstrating that something does not exist, it
becomes logically impossible. Let us dissect this a little further.
To prove that an apple exists, all I have to do is fetch one from my refrigerator. Science
works this way: it proves the positive. But to prove that Elvis does NOT visit Graceland

every midnight is an impossible task. If I say that nobody has seen him, many people may
come forward and claim that they have seen Elvis at midnight. If I suggest camping at
Graceland at night to catch Elvis when he shows up, and the attempt fails, I will be told
that I did not look hard enough, or that he came but he hid behind trees and bushes. If
I suggest illuminating the entire Graceland with powerful searchlight at midnight, and the
experience fails again, I’ll be told that I ruined everything, that he does not like bright light.
And this can go on and on. In fact, there are an inﬁnite number of “explanations” for why
Elvis does not show up when I am looking for him in Graceland at midnight.
Box 43.1.1. While for the proof of the existence of something you need only one in-
stance of that thing, to prove the nonexistence of something, you would have to eliminate
an inﬁnite number of possibilities—an impossible task!
The two camps of theorists and experimentalists in science are constantly watching each

other. If theorists claim something, the experimentalists immediately go to their labs to test
the theorists’ claim. This professional competition is a beneﬁcial symbiotic relation that is
advantageous to both camps and to the rest of humanity, and drives science to newer and
newer frontiers.
In complete contrast, pseudoscience is characterized by its exploitation of the limita-

tions of science. In fact, the very existence of pseudoscience depends on this limitation.
The smaller this limitation, the less chance for the survival of pseudoscience. Prior to the
advent of modern science—in the Dark Ages—pseudoscience was rampant. Many natural
phenomena were associated with the supernatural because there was no scientiﬁc explana-
tion for them. An eclipse would be interpreted as the wrath of god. A comet would be the
messenger of pestilence and destruction. Today, when we can predict the occurrence of an
eclipse or the arrival of a comet to within a fraction of a second, pseudoscience and super-
stition have a much smaller space in which to maneuver. But space they have! Knowledge
is like a huge ocean which we have just begun to explore. Scientists have discovered only a
small portion of a small region close to its shore. Pseudoscience has the rest of the ocean
to exploit.
43.1.4
Exploiting Mystery
Pseudoscience thrives on mysteries while science tries to solve them. As science expands
the borders of knowledge, pseudoscience gropes for new territory. At one time astrology
had a huge base of support among the public. In fact, as late as the seventeenth century,
well known astronomers such as Copernicus and Kepler studied the stars to control and
inﬂuence earthly phenomena. Over the course of many decades, it became clear that there
was no scientiﬁc basis for a connection between heavenly motions and earthly happenings.
So, astrology was conﬁned to narrower and narrower spheres until it shrunk to the conﬁnes
of the psychics, fortune tellers, and some politicians!
However, our understanding of the universe opened up new territories for pseudoscience.
Scientists do not deny
the possibility of alien
visits; they deny the
actuality of such visits
due to lack of any
material evidence.
If our Sun is only a star among billions of other stars, then what prevents us from assuming
that there are other planets revolving around other suns and supporting intelligent creatures
who may have a civilization far more advanced than ours.
And if these creatures are
advanced enough in technology, is it not reasonable that they have ventured out of their
planet in search of other civilizations? Is it not sensible to assume that this search has
brought them to our planet?

644
Chapter 43
Science versus Pseudoscience
All these claims may be true.
In fact, many scientists believe in the possibility of
intelligent life somewhere in the universe, maybe even in our own galaxy. As scientists,
they cannot outright deny the possibility of the visitation of Earth by those intelligent
beings. What they are denying is the actuality of such a visitation due to the nonexistence
of any material evidence.
It is in the nature of science to open up new questions every time it stumbles over a new
discovery or a new world outlook. Sometimes these questions could remain unanswered for
decades. In the mean time, it does not take a whole lot of imagination for the scientiﬁ-
cally uninformed—but otherwise motivated—people to fabricate stories, forge theories, and
manufacture far-fetched ideas that can live in the world of unanswered questions until those
questions ﬁnd answers and the cycle starts all over again.
Box 43.1.2. As long as science has not found all the answers (will it ever?), as long
as even a smidgen of the unknown survives (will it ever not?), there will be stories of
UFOs, of extraterrestrial creatures, of ghosts and poltergeists, and of faith healing and
psychic surgery.
43.2
Intelligent Design
One of the biggest public debates in America, next to abortion, is evolution vs creation.
Creation “scientists”3 believe that there is scientiﬁc support for the biblical story of creation
and that the theory of evolution is wrong. They overlook the fact that there are as many
There are many diﬀerent
stories of creation.
“stories” of creation as there are religions and ancient—sometimes extinct—civilizations.
If creation is to be a scientiﬁc theory, it has to be universal. The theory of relativity is as
valid in the US as it is in Argentina, Brazil, Yemen, or Zimbabwe. But the story of creation
in which a Buddhist, a Christian, a Jew, a Moslem, a Zoroastrian, or a Hindu believes is
diﬀerent from the rest. Why should a particular story be singled out as the “scientiﬁc”
creation?
Any science starts with observation.
Is it not, therefore, logical to ask whether the
biblical stories have any observational truth to them? If these stories are truly based on
observation, how long ago were these observations made? Two thousand years ago? Four
thousand years ago? If so, should we rely on the conclusions derived from such ancient
observations? Should we, therefore believe in the (3000-year-old) conclusion that Sun and
all the (ﬁve!)
planets move around Earth?
That there are only four elements: water,
Earth, air, and ﬁre? That the heaven is made of crystal spheres to which celestial bodies
are attached, and that the comets must shatter these crystals to enter our view?
Creationism (or intelligent design theory) claims to have the answer to the riddle of
creation.
It aims at replacing the scientiﬁc answer, i.e., the theory of evolution.
It is
therefore instructive to examine these two theories in some detail.
43.2.1
What Is Evolution?
The story of creation is without a doubt the oldest story of humankind, and the question
of how humans came into existence is probably the ﬁrst one asked by the conscious man.
We now have a surprisingly successful scientiﬁc story of creation: the big bang theory
of Part VIII, which originated in Einstein’s general theory of relativity. The answer to the
question of the creation of man came in 1859 when Charles Darwin published one of the

the intervention of some form of intelligence in the formation of life on Earth.

Section 43.2

masterpieces of scientiﬁc literature, The Origin of Species, in which he put forth the theory
of evolution, one of the most revolutionary scientiﬁc theories ever.
Darwin did not hypothesize evolution in the form of a dogma or a random wild hyp-
notic dream. Darwin’s theory, like all scientiﬁc theories, was based on a large number of
observations he had made over 20 years earlier. Examination of the ﬂora and fauna of

the Galapagos islands, which Darwin encountered in 1835 on the voyage of H.M.S. Beagle,
initiated his speculation of the evolution theory.

early as 1835, and he pondered over them for 24 years, it was only after he realized that
he was not alone in thinking in terms of evolution—that other naturalists, notably Alfred
Russel Wallace, had also come up with the same theory—that Darwin hastened to publish
his ideas in 1859.
The essence of evolution is that diﬀerent species have a common ancestor. The mecha-
nism operative in this theory is, according to Darwin himself, “modiﬁcation of the descen-
dants of any one species” and “[n]atural selection [which] leads to divergence of character
and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life” [Rus 88, p. 97].
With the advent of genetics, the dynamics of evolution now possesses a molecular expla-

nation. In fact, Darwin himself thought of a material transmission of traits from parents
to oﬀsprings. It is now well established that genes are the agents of this transmission. Al-
though all the characteristics of the parents are more or less preserved in the transmission,
once in a while a mutation takes place inside the genes causing the oﬀspring to be diﬀer-
ent from the parent. If the mutation assists the survival of the oﬀspring, it will persist in
future generations and new species will evolve. This is the “natural selection” component
of evolution.
The fact that genes mutate has been proven both in the lab and in the birth defects of
the oﬀsprings of humans as well as other animals. The fact that selection is operative is
evident from the variety of “pets” and cattle that humankind have bred. Even a superﬁcial
look at the diﬀerent breeds of dogs around us reveals the astonishing power of (artiﬁcial)
“selection.” All these breeds have been “created” out of a single variety, which thousands
of years ago was what we now call wolf.
43.2.2
What Is Creationism?
Creation “science” states that all the variety of animals were created exactly in the form in

which they exist now by a single all powerful creator. They insist that evolution is not a
science because “no one observed the origin of the universe, the origin of life, the conversion
of a ﬁsh into an amphibian, or an ape into a man” [Gis 73, p. 3].
What are the implications of this statement? Has anyone “observed” King Tutankhamen,
or Hammurabi? No. Yet creationists have no qualms about the fact that they lived 3000 or
4000 years ago. Why does anybody believe in these historical facts? It is not that someone
who can speak English has survived 30 or 40 centuries and has given us an eye-witness
account of the lives of the Egyptian and the Babylonian kings! It is because of the evi-
dence! This evidence is in the form of pyramids, tablets of wall paintings, sculptures, and
hieroglyphic writings or cuneiforms.
To understand these tablets, one inevitably ought to interpret them. One interpretation
is that some alien civilization has placed them on Earth. (There are some who believe
this “creationist” version of the evidence!) The other interpretation—based on countless
observations by many generations of archaeologists—would argue that primitive humans,
who at ﬁrst had no writing techniques4 settled in the valleys of the Nile and Tigris-Euphrates
4Because radioactive carbon dating proves that the oldest tablets with writing on them go as far as 5000
or 6000 years ago while the existence of primitive human beings capable of drawing goes back as far as
15,000 years ago.

Chapter 43
Science versus Pseudoscience
rivers, and gradually developed the skill of writing, and these tablets are their ways of telling
us their stories.
Every observation depends on the existing theories. So, when we observe the Egyptian
hieroglyphic tablets or the Babylonian cuneiforms, we have to accept the linguistic “theory”
gained by a careful and critical examination of the tablets by experts, in the process of
which hieroglyphics gets translated into modern languages. Then, we can safely say that
the tablets relay the story of a king or a queen or a prince that lived 4000 years ago. And
no aliens will be required to place the tablets and the pyramids on Earth.
There are countless pieces of evidence, both live and fossilized, pointing to the validity of
evolution, just as there are countless pieces of evidence pointing to the validity of the theory
that Hammurabi ruled Babylonian empire about 4000 years ago.
Scientists explain the
evolutionary pieces of evidence in terms of mutation and natural selection, just as historians
explain the archaeological pieces of evidence in terms of social and political progress. And
just as there are people who believe that pyramids were created by aliens from outer space,
so do creationists believe that species were created by an intelligent designer.
How do creationists “explain” the origin of species, once they discard evolution? If evo-
lution cannot create a reptile out of a ﬁsh, they argue, then creation is the only alternative.
However, the same logic that disposes of evolution is used in support of creation: “We
do not know how God created, what processes He used, for God used processes which are
not now operating anywhere in the natural universe. . . . We cannot discover by scientiﬁc
investigations anything about the creative processes used by God” [Gis 73, p. 25].5 The
italic, by the way, is original!
43.2.3
The Design Argument
One of the oldest arguments against evolution is the impossibility of the occurrence of
complicated design such as life forms without a “designer.”6 In his Natural Theology, the
eighteenth century theologian, William Paley writes:
In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked
how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that . . . it had lain there for
ever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But
suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the
watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer which I had
before given, that . . . the watch might have always been there.
Paley then concludes “that the watch must have had a maker.” If the watch has a maker,
What are the odds that

sentence from Hamlet?
shouldn’t such qualitatively and quantitatively more intricate a structure as the human eye,
or ear, or heart, or brain?
The impossibility of a complicated structure to come together on its own is best described
by the famous example of a monkey and a typewriter. How likely is it that a monkey bashing
away on a typewriter can produce Shakespeare’s Hamlet? To grasp the smallness of the
likelihood of this occurrence, let us drastically reduce our expectation, and look into the
probability that the monkey can produce a small—very small—phrase from Hamlet. In a
conversation with Polonius over the shape of a cloud, Hamlet says: “Methinks it is like
a weasel.” Including the spaces between words and excluding the period at the end, the
phrase consists of 28 letters. Let’s ignore the complication arising from the case of each
letter and assume that only capital letters are available. What is the probability that a
monkey at a typewriter can produce this sentence? Math Note E.43.1 on page 154 of
Appendix.pdf shows why it would take a monkey 12 trillion times the age of the universe
to do this even if it had the speed of a computer!
5This is a masterpiece of unfalsiﬁable claims! The statement says: All creatures were created by a creator
but there is no way that science can discover this “truth.”
6The discussion of the design argument is taken from [Daw 87, pp. 43–63].

Section 43.2
Intelligent Design
647
It is these staggering numbers that the advocates of the design argument use to refute
evolution.
However, there is a ﬂaw in this kind of argument.
We have to distinguish
between single-step selection and cumulative selection.
In the single-step selection, the
random choices made in each trial are completely independent of the previous trials. This
is what we calculated in Math Note E.43.1. The selection involved in evolution is not single-
step. The “letters” of life replicate themselves and the end product of one generation of
selection is the starting point of the next generation.
To mimic the cumulative selection, let us assume that our computer monkey begins
by choosing a random sequence of 28 letters as before. However, it now “breeds from”
this random phrase. It duplicates it repeatedly, but with a certain chance of random er-
ror—“mutation”—in the process of copying. The computer examines the mutant nonsense
phrases, the “progeny” of the original one, and chooses that which, however slightly, resem-
bles the target phrase. This goes on generation after generation. In actual runs, the target
is usually reached in less than 100 generations in at most a few minutes. A far cry from
trillion ages of the universe!
Other computer simulations mimicking the action of genes have shown a more intriguing
results. In one computer model, Richard Dawkins7 chose nine genes, each represented by
a number in the computer. The simulation draws one line segment (or branch) at a time,
and the genes tell the computer how to draw this branch. For instance, one gene might
inﬂuence the angle of branching, another, the length of some particular branch, and a third,
the depth of the recursion, the number of successive branchings.
In every generation, the program takes the genes that are supplied to it by the previous

where Darwinian selection comes in.

The genes of the chosen one are passed across to the simulation, and a new generation
begins. This process, like real-life evolution, goes on indeﬁnitely. Each generation of these
so-called “biomorphs” is only a single mutational step away from its predecessor and its
successor. But after 100 generations of evolution, much can happen. How much? Richard
Dawkins writes:
When I wrote the program, I never thought that it would evolve anything more
than a variety of tree-like shapes. I had hoped for weeping willows, cedars of Lebanon,
Lombardy poplars, seaweeds, perhaps deer antlers. Nothing in my biologist’s intu-
ition, nothing in my 20 years’ experience of programming computers, and nothing in
my wildest dreams, prepared me for what actually emerged on the screen. I can’t
remember exactly when in the sequence it ﬁrst began to dawn on me that an evolved
resemblance to something like an insect was possible. With a wild surmise, I began
to breed, generation after generation, from whichever child looked most like an insect.
My incredulity grew in parallel with the evolving resemblance.

emerging before my eyes.

behind my eyelids as I tried to sleep.

that he created on his computer desktop using a software developed by himself and in-
cluded on the disk accompanying the book. The collection sample shapes have a striking

43.3
Psychoanalysis
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, is probably the most inﬂuential ﬁgure of
the twentieth century.
Psychoanalytic approaches have been applied to such widely di-
verse ﬁelds as history, political science, literature, music, and the arts. Nonetheless, the
basis of psychoanalysis is pseudoscientiﬁc. This observation came about very slowly and,
unfortunately, very ineﬀectively.
The entire discipline of psychoanalysis is based on the dogma of the division of conscious-
ness into three levels. First, there is the conscious level; “below”8 this lies the preconscious.
The dogma of
psychoanalysis.
“Below” the preconscious lies the unconscious. According to Freud, unconscious contains
memories, desires, and feelings that have been repressed by the individual because they
would be too traumatic or painful to face directly due mostly to sexual inhibition.
Freud’s theory also deals in great detail with the development of personality and specif-
ically with the development of sexual behavior and sexual identity. He divided personality
into three “structures:”
The dogma of the
division of personality.
• The id is thought of as the “seed” of personality. The newborn has only an id and the
other structures of the personality develop from it. The id is also the most animalistic
part of the personality, seeking only to obtain pleasure and avoid pain.
• The ego develops as the child grows. It is reality-oriented and modiﬁes or controls
the desires of the id by taking into account the possible consequences of an action.
• The superego is the conscience of the individual. It judges whether an action is right
or wrong, according to whatever set of moral standards the child has been taught.
These three structures of personality interact in complicated ways. For example, the ego
may postpone the gratiﬁcation of the id, and the superego may “battle” with both the id
and the ego because behavior often falls short of the moral code it represents. But more
often in the normal person, the three work as a team, producing integrated behavior.
What evidence dictates this kind of division and the interaction among them is not clear.
Why not add another structure between id and ego, or between ego and superego? In fact,
in order to allow for more possibilities of interactions, perhaps we should let personality
have a multilevel structure. Divide the personality, in order of decreasing “animalisticity,”
into id, idd, iidd, subego, ego, superego! Or some equally arbitrary multilevel structure!
Two major characteristics of science are emphasis on observation and the material na-

ture of its objects of study. These two characteristics of science are conspicuously absent
in psychoanalysis. Freud never made any observation of any material object from which to
deduce psychoanalysis. His only object of “study” was personality and mind.
When a discipline starts with a dogma that is remote from and insensitive to observation
and experimental data, interpretation and reinterpretation becomes an essential part of the
discipline as we saw in Section 43.1.1; and psychoanalysis is no exception. By constantly
reinterpreting its content, psychoanalysis can accommodate every truth (or falsehood). Ev-
ery new case, regardless of its nature, is a new conﬁrmation of the psychoanalytic theory.
While a valid scientiﬁc theory, such as the general theory of relativity, makes the risky
prediction of the bending of light as it grazes the Sun, psychoanalysis is risk free, because
it makes either no prediction, or every possible outcome can be interpreted as a prediction
after the fact!

Section 43.3
Psychoanalysis

43.3.1
Neo-Freudians
Let us put psychoanalysis to the test of another characteristic of science: its detachment
from the scientists. The great ideas of science are so impersonal that scientists rarely refer
to the original writings of the discoverers. Because of this detachment, the idea will live a
long time after the discoverer dies. The theory of relativity is just as valid today as it was
in 1905 when Einstein discovered it. Neither the “charisma” of Einstein nor the “cult of
personality” of Newton has had any eﬀect on the validity and acceptance of relativity or
the laws of motion.
What happened to psychoanalysis after (even at the time of) Freud? In The History
of Psychoanalysis [Fin 90, p. 77], by Reuben Fine, himself a psychoanalyst, we read “From
the very beginning of psychoanalysis, schisms and dissensions within its ranks have been
notorious.” Should any reader with even a slight familiarity with the workings of science
not wonder “Why the schisms and dissensions?” Can the opposing parties not bring their
disagreements to the court of observation and let this ultimate judge of all sciences rule out
all claims except one to which all must adhere? We don’t hear anything about the “schisms
and dissensions” in the ranks of relativity theory! The history of relativity has no chapter
on the split among its rank due to disagreements on the power of c in E = mc2! Or on
what Einstein meant by the letter c in that formula!
Disagreement, schisms, and dissensions occur only in disciplines in which observation,
the most fundamental ingredient of science, is absent. This frequently occurs in politics and
religion where dogma replaces theories and interpretation of dogma replaces observation.
The similarity between religion and psychoanalysis is very well described in the following
statement:
The historian must oﬀer some rational explanation of these innumerable splits and
divisions, which are paralleled perhaps only in the history of religion. The analogy is
by no means inappropriate, for psychoanalysis has also been dominated by a long series
of charismatic ﬁgures, like the religious sects. When the works of these charismatic
ﬁgures are carefully pursued, they often make little or no sense . . . . [Fin 90, pp. 78]
Charisma playing a dominant role in science? Are relativists to be mesmerized by the
charm of a “charismatic ﬁgure” into believing that E = mc3? or E = mc4? Or perhaps
E = mc2.5? And why are these charismatic ﬁgures allowed to make statements that “make
little or no sense”? Why aren’t their works “carefully pursued” to begin with? Is there no
yardstick in psychoanalysis with which to measure the validity of psychoanalytic statements?
Psychoanalysis is so arbitrary that “neither Jung nor Adler grasped the bases of the ﬁrst
psychoanalytic system” [Fin 90, p. 78].
Here is a historian of psychoanalysis, himself a psychoanalyst, who proclaims that even
Psychoanalysis lacks
another characteristic of
science: its detachment
from the scientist.
Jung and Adler, the two most prominent psychoanalysts after Freud, did not grasp “the
bases of the ﬁrst psychoanalytic system.” In other words, only Freud could grasp psycho-
analysis, i.e., psychoanalysis cannot be detached from Freud.
The history of psychoanalysis after Freud is a history of sectarianism. We read about the
hatred that Freud developed toward Adler after the latter showed a mild independence in
the discipline; about the love-hate, father-son, and “unanalyzed homosexual transference”
relation between Freud and Jung [Fin 90, pp. 79–87].
But the best story is that of Wilhelm Reich, who “up to 1933 was one of the leading
ﬁgures” in psychoanalysis, and whose book Character Analysis “made a signiﬁcant contri-
bution to the understanding of character.” In his attempts to combine psychoanalysis and
Marxism, Reich developed a theory which he called “orgonomy,” and for which he found
some followers. In later years he saw “orgone energy” as the antidote of nuclear energy and
envisioned himself as the savior of mankind whom the FBI was protecting because of his
knowledge of secrets. He was convicted of fraud regarding the “orgone box,” leading to his
incarceration in a federal prison in which he died in 1957 [Fin 90, pp. 108–109].

Chapter 43
Science versus Pseudoscience
We are not attacking Reich’s personality here. Even a true scientist may be attracted
to the realm of pseudoscience as Newton was to alchemy. However, Newton’s attraction
to alchemy was completely detached from his scientiﬁc discoveries, and no other physicist
followed him into alchemy. On the other hand, the very fact that Reich attracted some
followers means that his “weird” ideas were the natural evolutionary products of his earlier
(more widely accepted) theories.
The discipline of psychoanalysis allows so much religion-like interpretation that “when-
ever anything out of the way is presented in analysis, the originator avoids criticism by
saying that he represents a diﬀerent ‘school’ ” [Fin 90, p. 87]. Adler, Jung, and Reich were
no exceptions; they were the rule. Nowhere in the history of science does one read about
scientists creating “schools.” You don’t read about “schools of light power,” each school
“believing” in a diﬀerent power than 2 in E = mc2! We see this kind of ﬂourishing of
schools over and over again, not only in psychoanalysis, but in any “scientiﬁc” ﬁeld founded
by a single person and based on a “dogma.” We see the same phenomenon in chiropractic,
founded at the end of nineteenth century by Daniel David Palmer, an American grocer,
phrenologist, and magnetic therapist.
As long as the “science” is attached to the personality of its founder, as long as one
has to go back to the founder to verify the correctness of “scientiﬁc statements,” as long
as students of the discipline—even a hundred years after its “founding”—are constantly
referred to the work of the founder, and as long as there is no solid observational yardstick
to check the claims of the “leaders,” the word “science” is only a decorative emblem attached
to the discipline to attract new “disciples.” At no time in the education of a physicist is
he/she referred to the original work of Newton, Planck, or Einstein.9 Why? Because gravity,
quantum theory, and relativity are completely detached from Newton, Planck, and Einstein.
And all students who study, say, relativity deal with exactly the same set of concepts. It
does not matter whether these students speak the same language, live in the same place,
and are close or far from where Einstein lived.
There is no need to refer to Einstein’s
original work on relativity (and if you do not know German you cannot anyway), because
the theory of relativity can be taught in any language.
The dogmatic nature of psychoanalysis, as in all other dogma-driven disciplines, leaves
its door open to every possible unchecked whim. Since the “master” has founded the entire
discipline on fancy, why should the loyal disciples refrain from proposing genuine fanciful
“theories.” When Freud himself arbitrarily divides human psycho into id, ego, and superego,
it is only natural for Jacques Lacan, one of his most prominent French followers, to claim
that the diversity in the geometrical and topological structures of sphere, M¨obius strip, and
the Klein bottle,10 “is very important as it explains many things about the structure of
mental disease” [Sok 98, p. 19].
Now, a M¨obius strip, and a Klein bottle are geometrical constructs—invented by math-
ematicians after whom the objects are named—with some strange and counter-intuitive
properties, for the demonstration of which the invention took place to begin with. These
constructs are utterly products of imagination which, so far, have not found applications in
even the most mathematical of all sciences, physics. When mathematics ﬁnd its way into
physics, it is in a most natural and compulsory manner. If Newton used calculus in his
description of motion, it was because it was natural (even necessary) to use it. If Maxwell
used vector analysis in his study of electromagnetic theory, it was because nature practically
forced it on him. Einstein did not use diﬀerential geometry for his general theory of rela-
tivity simply because diﬀerential geometry was “fashionable.” In fact, if anything, it was
the general theory of relativity that made diﬀerential geometry fashionable by heralding its
relevance to the workings of nature.
9Unless, of course, he/she is interested in the history of science.
10The use of the vocabulary of modern mathematics and physics has become fashionable in some post-
modern disciplines. It is not uncommon to encounter words like “nonlinear,” “topology,” “quantum,” and
“ﬁeld” in the texts of postmodern writers.

Section 43.3
Psychoanalysis
651
To cast aside any doubts that Lacan’s claims may be only metaphors, we quote his
response to a question suggesting that the mathematics and the topology used by Lacan
may be “an analogy for an explanation of the life of the mind.” Lacan replies: “. . . It is not
an analogy. It is really in some part of the realities, this sort of torus.11 This torus really
exists and it is exactly the structure of the neurotic. It is not an analogon; it is not even
an abstraction, because an abstraction is some sort of diminution of reality, and I think it
is reality itself” [Lac 70, pp. 195–196].
So, why is Lacan using the language of topology, geometry, and mathematics in his
psychoanalytic study of the mind? Is there some rational necessity for its usage? Is psycho-
analysis forcing these mathematical concepts on him? Does he gain simplicity and clarity
by their usage? Obviously not! Lacan’s use of mathematics as his medium of caprice may
be his futile ambition of bestowing exactness to the pseudoscience of psychoanalysis. After
all, physics uses mathematics, and it is considered an exact science. So, why not impose
mathematics on psychoanalysis and give it the appearance of an exact science as well!
43.3.2
How Can Psychoanalysis Become a Science?
Psychoanalysis analyzes (i.e., studies) the “psyche” or the mind. Is there any “matter”
associated with the mind? Although some self-proclaimed “scientists” try to separate the
mind from any form of matter, a proper scientiﬁc investigation of the mind ﬁrst identiﬁes its
material basis. Obviously, the matter of the mind is the brain. Therefore, if psychoanalysis
is to become a science, it has to study the brain.
Even a cursory look at the brain reveals that it is a very complicated “whole” consisting
of several equally complicated structures. When each of these structures is dissected further
and further, it is seen that the building block of the brain is a neuron, a nerve cell. Thus,
psychoanalysis is “reduced” to the understanding of neuron.
Before the “holistics” snap at this conclusion, we have to emphasize immediately that
understanding neurons is only the ﬁrst step. As clearly indicated in Box 42.5.1 and the
discussion before and after it, to understand the brain and its functions (mind), you have to
understand the neuron. But that is not the end! After (and only after) you understand the
neuron, you have to see how they interact, communicate, send chemicals, etc. among one
another. Psychoanalysts do not follow this procedure; that is why they are not scientists.
But there are scientists who are actively pursuing the understanding of neurons; these
are the neurologists, the neurobiochemists, the molecular biologists, the biophysicists, and
others.
Box 43.3.1. A truly scientiﬁc investigation of the “mind” will take the material organ
of the mind—the brain—and concentrate on its building blocks, the nerve cells. After
(and only after) the nerve cells are understood, can one put them together to get a
complete picture of the “whole” brain.
A neuron is a very complex arrangement of molecules, and its understanding will not
come easy. It will probably be decades maybe even centuries before we completely fathom
the workings of this (or any other) cell. Only then can we ask how they are put together to
form the brain and how this formation constitutes the mind. But the diﬃculty of the task
ahead of us should not be a reason for hastily inserting pseudoscientiﬁc techniques into the
science of the brain.
Should we wait centuries for a full comprehension of the brain before we treat the
mentally ill? Of course not! The absence of the scientiﬁc knowledge of the human body

did not prevent medical doctors from treating patients throughout history. Any technique
proven to be eﬀective in the treatment of mental diseases should not be prevented simply
because of our lack of knowledge of how it aﬀects the neurons. However, when there is a
choice between a drug that is based on the scientiﬁc research of the chemistry of the brain
and an herb or a procedure that is based on the practice of an alternative medical doctor,
the former should be selected.

Alternative Medicine
One of the ﬁrst items on the priority list of the American public is physical and emotional
well-being. The appetite and the desire for good health and good life has made the public
alarmingly vulnerable to medical quackery. In 2007, 85 million Americans spent some $34

billion for therapies ranging from acupuncture and Ayurveda to yerbera and yoga [Nah 07].
In 1993 the US Senate created the Oﬃce of Alternative Medicine in the National Institutes
of Health, and in 2000 it promoted the “Oﬃce” to the National Center of Complementary
and Alternative Medicine and increased its budget to $68.7 million [NIH website].
According to Wayne Jonas, one of the past directors of OAM, there are “people in both
extremes, advocates who believe in their alternative therapy wholeheartedly and not in
science, and skeptics who disbelieve it wholeheartedly and believe in science. The truth is
that reality is somewhere in between.” In the August 1997 issue of Nature: Medicine he
gets a chance to respond to critics of the OAM.12 Referring to the homeopathic claim that
biological information can be stored and transmitted by water and wires, he asks, “Even
though this concept is implausible, the potential implications it holds for understanding
basic biological and cellular communication are enormous.
Can we not aﬀord to invest
a small amount in pursuit of this question?”
If we were to apply this principle to the
claim that gold could be produced by puﬃng at dirt, it would read something like this:
“Even though the concept of producing gold by puﬃng at dirt is implausible, the potential
implications it holds for economy and commerce are enormous. Can we not aﬀord to invest
a small amount in pursuit of this question?” If we were to apply this principle to the concept
of ﬂying it would read something like this: “Even though ﬂying by ﬂapping ones arms is
implausible, the potential implications it holds for human transportation and urban traﬃc
are enormous. Can we not aﬀord to have a few people jump from Empire State Building
while ﬂapping their arms?”
The popularity of alternative medicine is a reﬂection of the scientiﬁc unawareness of
the American public, its inability to distinguish between real and false medicine, and its
hearty reception of pseudomedicine “doctors.” As part of the task of this book, we have
chosen to expose only three forms of the alternative medicine: chiropractic, therapeutic
touch, and magnetic therapy. A fourth form, quantum healing was discussed in Chapter 35.
Lack of space does not allow consideration of other forms of alternative medicine, but the
pseudoscientiﬁc bases of all branches of alternative medicine are so similar that our handful
of examples suﬃce to show the true nature of the entire discipline.
Before going into the details of the speciﬁc branches, we need to understand the nature
of the human body’s reaction to drugs and drug substitutes. In particular, we have to know
something about the so-called placebo eﬀect.
43.4.1
The Placebo Eﬀect
A lot more science is used in medicine today than a hundred years ago.13 Nevertheless,
remnants of the old unscientiﬁc practices still linger on. For example, doctors and their

practice of advocating alternative medicine. It is now investigating the eﬃcacy of alternative practices,

patients continue to ascribe healing powers to pills and procedures that have no intrinsic
therapeutic value for the condition being treated. Consider, for example, the widespread—
and medically pointless—use of antibiotics to ﬁght colds and ﬂu caused by viruses. It is not
that these treatments do not oﬀer beneﬁts: most of them do. But in some cases, the beneﬁt
may come from the placebo eﬀect, in which the very act of undergoing treatment—seeing
a medical expert or taking a pill—helps the patient to recover.
A typical medical research proceeds with a so-called double-blind study: in a group
of patients participating in the study, some are treated with a placebo (a pharmacologically
Double-blind study.
inert capsule or injection), and neither the doctors nor the patients (thus the term double-
blind) know who receives the placebo and who the drug. A landmark study in the early
1950s by a Harvard University team, and several studies of depression, suggested that
Box 43.4.1. For a wide range of aﬄictions, including depression, pain, high blood
pressure, asthma, and cough, roughly 30–40% of patients experience relief after taking
a placebo.
In some cases, the response can be even more pronounced: researchers of the University of
Kansas Medical Center in the late 1950s investigated the eﬀectiveness of the then routine
arterial ligation surgery to treat angina pectoris (chest pain caused by insuﬃcient blood
supply to the heart). The doctors performed the surgical procedure in one set of 13 patients;

with a second group of ﬁve patients, they made only a chest incision but did no further
surgery. Among the patients who received the actual surgery, 76% improved. Notably,
100% of the placebo group got better! (Arterial ligation surgery is no longer performed.)
The healing environment is a powerful antidote for illness. The decision to seek medical
assistance restores some sense of control. The symbols and rituals of healing—the doctor’s
oﬃce, the stethoscope, the physical examination—oﬀer reassurance. And merely the act
of taking a pill can have a therapeutic eﬀect. For example, the drug propranolol is often
prescribed after a heart attack to regulate the heartbeat and prevent further damage. In a
study of more than 2000 patients, the death rate was cut in half among patients who took
propranolol regularly compared with those who took the medication less regularly. But in
the same study, patients who took placebos regularly also had half the death rate of those
who took them less regularly.
Notably, placebos seem to be most reliably eﬀective for aﬄictions in which stress directly
aﬀects the symptoms: in certain forms of depression and anxiety, for example, distress is
the illness. And conditions such as pain, asthma, and moderate high blood pressure can
become worse when the patient is upset. Indeed, placebos may work in part by lessening
the apprehension associated with disease. Studies of both animals and humans have shown
that the functioning of the immune system falters under stressful conditions. For instance,
stress increases the secretion of hormones such as cortisol, which in turn lowers resistance to
disease. It is not inconceivable that by reducing anxiety, placebos could inﬂuence countless
diseases, including some that we do not usually think of as subject to psychological inﬂuence.
A patient’s expectation of improvement is also crucial. Researchers know that across
a wide range of illnesses, patients who think they will feel better are more likely to do so.
Expectation operates more speciﬁcally as well. A 1968 study done by a team of researchers
at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn showed that

patients with asthma who were given an inhaler containing only nebulized saltwater but
were told they would be inhaling an irritant or allergen displayed more problems with airway
obstruction. When the same group was told that the inhaler had a medicine to help asthma,
their airways opened up!
The placebo eﬀect is now understood to be due to the release of endorphins, the same
substances responsible for pain reduction caused by the physiological stress of excitement.
That the placebo eﬀect is a real chemical reaction has been demonstrated by eliminating

it with the injection of the drug naloxone which neutralizes endorphins. It has also been
shown that the release of endorphins in the placebo situation is a classically conditioned
response that can be taught to rats.
It may well be that in all “alternative” treatments, it is the placebo eﬀect at work
rather than the procedure. Very few practitioners of alternative medicine have been willing
to subject their practice to a double-blind study. In the few cases that they have,
Box 43.4.2. Double-blind studies have shown that “alternative” treatments are no more
eﬀective than placebo.

successes of acupuncture. There were 302 patients in the study. In 12 sessions over 8 weeks,
sham acupuncture, in which the needles are inserted in the “wrong” points, was just as
eﬀective as inserting them in the “correct” points.
43.4.2
Chiropractic
A very popular branch of alternative medicine, one that has exhibitions in the malls, adver-
tises in rented booths in county fairs, and has multiplied like mushrooms in the yellow pages
of all urban communities in the US, is chiropractic. The entire profession of chiropractic is
based on the assumption that every pain and disease (or “dis-ease,” as chiropractors call
it) is caused by the nerves pinched between the bones of the spinal column.
The founder of chiropractic is Daniel David (“D. D.”) Palmer (1845–1913).14 Palmer
started as a grocer in Davenport, Iowa, but soon was attracted to phrenology,15 and even-

tually practiced as a full-time “magnetic healer.” To attract patients, D. D.’s brother ran
articles in newspapers claiming that D. D. cured patients simply by the motion of his hands,
and that he could cure tumors and cancers without medicine. His technique was to locate
the dysfunctional organs and to impart a “life force from his hands into that dormant organ,
thereby assisting it to throw oﬀthe unnatural condition.”
Chiropractic dates its origin to September 18, 1895, when Palmer claims to have ma-
nipulated a spinal bone of Harvey Lillard, a janitor where he had his oﬃce, and curing him
of a 17-year-old deafness instantly. “Shortly after this relief from deafness, I had a case
of heart trouble which was not improving. I examined the spine and found a displaced
vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and
gave immediate relief” [Mag 95, pp. 10–11]. From these two instances of “cure,” Palmer
concluded that other diseases were caused by the same “pressure on nerves.” In Palmer’s
own words, “the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at
that time.”
Palmer referred to the “displaced vertebrae” as “luxations.” Then, shortly after the
turn of the century, one of his disciples began calling the alleged problem areas “subluxa-
tions.” The term subluxation soon became central to chiropractic theory and is still used
by chiropractors today.
To base the entire profession of chiropractic on “subluxation” and to diagnose all the dis-
eases and pains as pinched nerves in the spinal disks is nothing but pseudoscience, namely,
the replacement of observation and experimentation with the rule of authority and unproven
ideas. There is nothing wrong with stating a theoretical idea. Science is full of theories,
14For a detailed account of the controversial discipline of chiropractic, see [Mag 95]. Unless otherwise
referenced, what follows in this section is taken from this book.

principles, and laws. Scientiﬁc theories, however, are results of thousands of painstaking
observations and hundreds of unsuccessful or partially successful “little” theories and con-
jectures. The predictions and explanations of these theories (principles, laws, conjectures)
have been tested over and over again. When conventional medicine claims that penicillin
kills bacteria, it can prove it in an overwhelming majority of cases. But when chiropractors
claim that they can cure pain by manipulating the spine, the only “proof” they oﬀer is
word of mouth, claims of other practitioners, and in rare cases, patients who have been
“cured”—very likely due to other mechanisms such as the placebo eﬀect (Section 43.4.1).
In 1896, with the help of a local minister, Palmer coined the name chiropractic from
Greek words meaning “done by hand.” That same year, he incorporated his ﬁrst school
which was renamed Palmer Inﬁrmary and Chiropractic Institute in 1902. Several years
later, D. D. was jailed for practicing medicine without a license. His son B.J. took charge
of the Institute, and refused to give his father access to school grounds after the latter’s
release from prison. An arbitration committee resolved the dispute between father and son
by allowing the son to purchase the school upon which he renamed it Palmer School and
Inﬁrmary of Chiropractic (or Palmer School of Chiropractic) in 1907.
And this is how chiropractic started in America. From its inception, the discipline was
factionalized. There were those so-called “straights,” such as B. J. Palmer, who believed in
the centrality of the spine. There were also “mixers,” such as Willard Carver, who advo-
cated other modalities in addition to the spinal manipulation. Today, the same factionality
still exists among chiropractors.16 Some chiropractors practice under the assumption that
the dogma of the founders—D. D. and B.J. Palmer—is the truth and everything else fol-
lows from that [Kea 97, p. 41]. Others rely on spiritual inspiration (Innate Intelligence),
empirically testable but untested (and uncontested) hypothesis such as subluxation, and
uncritical rationalism. An example of this mentality is the claim of some chiropractors that
“chiropractic works because the nerve system is the master switchboard of the body.”
The existence of a wide spectrum of beliefs in the chiropractic community should be an
evidence of its pseudoscientiﬁc character. The factions among chiropractors resemble the
denominations of a religion. When there is such a wide variety of beliefs and methodologies

in any discipline, one has to conclude that the discipline has nothing to do with science.
We have to distinguish between the temporary polarization of a scientiﬁc community upon
the introduction of new radical ideas17 and the permanent division of the chiropractic
community which has lasted over 100 years.
What about subluxation? Is it still the central theme of chiropractic? Is there any exper-
imental proof of its role? Although in 1975 the American Chiropractic Association (ACA)
“disaﬃrmed the [monocausal] doctrine that holds to a singular approach to the treatment of
disease,” the ACA’s current “Chiropractic: State of the Art” booklet states that “classical
subluxation” theory and the “nerve compression hypothesis” still occupy a “central place
in the chiropractic rationale.” The policy handbook of the International Chiropractors As-
sociation (ICA) states that “subluxation is a reasonable and credible diagnosis” [Mag 95,
pp. 31–32]. In 1980, a prominent chiropractic educator asked 1000 chiropractors on the
ACA’s mailing list whether they agreed with various statements related to such beliefs.
Of 268 respondents, 4% agreed that subluxation is the cause of all diseases, and a whop-
ping 70% agreed that “the chiropractic subluxation may be related to the cause of most
diseases.” To the question of whether they thought that the subluxation hypothesis was
scientiﬁcally supported 95% said that it was only “partially” supported or not supported
at all! In other words, chiropractic “doctors” are consciously practicing a theory that has,
16A standard joke among chiropractors is: For every “DC” (“doctor” of chiropractic) there is an equal
and opposite DC.
17When Einstein introduced the notion of the relativity of time in 1905, many physicists opposed him,
partly because they did not understand him and partly because it was undermining the cherished ideas
with which they had grown up. The correctness of the relativity of time was quickly veriﬁed and the whole
physics community immediately rallied behind Einstein.

at best, “partial” scientiﬁc support.
When, in 1971, a medical doctor challenged his local chiropractic society to produce ten
sets of “before and after” X-rays that demonstrate the eﬀect of chiropractic treatment, the
society refused and referred him to the Palmer School of Chiropractic. When he contacted
the school, the vice president of the school replied:
Chiropractors do not make the claim to be able to read a speciﬁc subluxation from
an X-ray ﬁlm. [They] can read spinal distortions, which indicates the possible presence
of a subluxation and can conﬁrm the actual presence of a subluxation by other physical
ﬁndings. [Mag 95, p. 36]
43.4.3
Therapeutic Touch and Magnetic Therapy
Recently Therapeutic Touch (TT) has gained a powerful foothold in the American nursing
profession.18
According to Dolores Krieger, R.N., its leading proponent, “Therapeutic
Touch is a healing practice based on the conscious use of the hands to direct or modulate,
for therapeutic purposes, selected unphysical human energies that activate the physical
body” [Kri 93, pp. 3–4].
By centering your consciousness, “you will have stepped into
another, often unrealized dimension of yourself” [Kri 93, p. 19]. Thusly prepared, through
the palms of the hands held slightly above the body, the Therapeutic Touch practitioner
can scan the body for every deﬁcit or illness. The evidence that one has detected such
“living currents of energy ﬂow” comes through sensations such as tingling, heat, pressure,
or elasticity.
Following assessment of the patient’s energy ﬁeld, the practitioner, palms
facing the patient and about two or three inches from his body, “rebalances the patient’s
energies.” The practitioner sends energy from her hand chakras (energy centers) through
the patient’s energy ﬁeld, thereby inducing a health-promoting energy ﬂow.
In deﬁning this “nonmaterial energy ﬁeld that I cannot see or taste or smell,” Krieger
(p. 16) draws upon metaphors such as that of steam power and electricity. Yet she admits
that heat, one of the sensations practitioners sense through their hands, cannot be detected
by scientiﬁc instruments such as the thermocouple. This is an excellent example of the prime
characteristic of pseudoscience: sensation of heat exists, but no scientiﬁc instrument can
detect it. (Remember the paradigm statement: “Ghosts exist, but no scientist can observe
them”?) Krieger goes on to say, “Obviously Therapeutic Touch deals with a very diﬀerent

aspect or conception of temperature diﬀerential than the one we currently understand in
biophysics” (p. 31).
The idea of treating patients with nonmaterial “ﬁelds” is not anything new. For thou-
sands of years, wonder and magic were associated with the mysterious forces exerted by
lodestones. Paracelsus (1493–1543), a physician and alchemist reasoned that since magnets
have the power to attract iron, perhaps they can also attract diseases and leach them from
the body. But Paracelsus was also aware of the important role of the patient’s mind in the
process of healing. He wrote, “The spirit is the master, the imagination is the instrument,
the body is the plastic material. The moral atmosphere surrounding the patient can have a
strong inﬂuence on the course of the disease. It is not the curse or the blessing that works,
but the idea. The imagination produces the eﬀect.”
The development in eighteenth century England of carbon-steel permanent magnets
more powerful than lodestones brought renewed interest in the possible healing powers of
magnets, and among those interested was Maximilian Hell, a professor of astronomy at the
University of Vienna. Hell claimed several cures using steel magnets, but he was rapidly

cess with the “magnets from Hell” led directly to the widespread promotion of his theory of

“animal magnetism.” Although he ﬁrst used actual magnets, he later found he could “mag-
netize” virtually anything—paper, wood, leather, water—and produce the same eﬀect on
patients. He concluded that the animal magnetism resided in himself, the various materials
simply aiding the ﬂow of the “universal ﬂuid” between him and the patients.
In 1784 Mesmer sought the French government approval of his practice of a treatment
based on animal magnetism.
He considered his Animal Magnetism a physical force of
supreme interest to the sciences.
He had only to point a ﬁnger toward his patient to
induce a therapeutic “crisis,” such as this one: “Bodies would begin to shake, arms and
legs move violently and involuntarily, teeth chatter loudly. Patients would grimace, groan,
babble, scream, faint, and fall unconscious.” With repeated provocation the attacks would
gradually become less severe and eventually disappear, and recovery would follow.
Possibly in response to the turmoil generated by Animal Magnetism, the French King
Louis XVI appointed a commission to investigate the practice. The four commissioners
appointed ﬁve additional commissioners including the American ambassador, Benjamin
Franklin, and Lavoisier, the founder of modern chemistry. Avoiding a blind alley taken by
several contemporary researchers and funding groups, they rejected Mesmer’s demand that
they focus on cures.19 The commissioners considered that their ﬁrst duty was to ﬁnd out
whether animal magnetism existed; the question of its utility could be taken up only after
the question of its existence had been answered aﬃrmatively.
In one experiment, a woman who claimed an experience of warmth in every part of her
body that received magnetism, was blindfolded. The parts of her body which were exposed
to magnetism without her knowledge did not respond, but when she was made to believe that
she was being magnetized while blindfolded, she felt the usual sensations, although nothing
whatever was being done. From this study it was concluded that imagination controlled
these sensations. In another experiment, the commission sought to test the power of imagi-
nation in the production of convulsions. A particularly susceptible subject was blindfolded
and asked to touch four trees in succession, one of which had been charged with Animal
Magnetism. At the fourth tree, 24 feet from the magnetized one, he fell in a convulsion,
losing consciousness. Similarly, several nonmagnetized cups were presented in succession
to another subject.
The second cup agitated her somewhat and the fourth provoked a
crisis. She was calmed afterwards by drinking from an additional cup that had, in fact,
been magnetized. From their series of experimental ﬁndings the commission concluded that

“imagination without magnetism produces convulsions and . . . magnetism without imagi-
nation produces nothing” and “that this ﬂuid without existence is consequently without
utility.”
The report of the scientiﬁc commission on animal magnetism damaged Mesmer’s rep-
utation and he eventually faded from public view. However, “magnetizing” persisted in
various forms. Many early magnetizers evolved into students of hypnosis and developed
various forms of hypnotherapy.20 Daniel David Palmer, of whom we spoke earlier, devel-
oped chiropractic (see Section 43.4.2).
Others focused on hand gestures without actual
touch, an approach recently reborn as therapeutic touch. Mary Baker Eddy was “cured”
by a magnetizer, but she later became convinced that cures could best be achieved through
prayer, and founded Christian Science.
In the twentieth century, materials scientists and engineers developed stronger and
stronger permanent magnets—alnico magnets in the 1930s, ferrite (ceramic) magnets in
the 1950s, and rare-Earth magnets in the 1970s and 1980s. The latest rare-Earth magnets,
neodymium-iron-boron, are over a hundred times more powerful than the steel magnets
available in the nineteenth century. Both ferrite magnets and the latest “neo” magnets have
had a tremendous impact on modern technology, but they have also restimulated interest
19Although Mesmer might not have known of the placebo eﬀect, his practice clearly showed him the
power of this—to him unknown—eﬀect. Thus his insistence on cures.
20The trance induced in many of Mesmer’s patients is thought to be what is now called a hypnotic trance,
and most dictionaries today list mesmerism as a synonym for hypnotism.

Science versus Pseudoscience
in the use of permanent magnets for magnetic therapy. Unlike earlier magnetic materials
such as steel and alnico, the new magnets have great resistance to demagnetization. While
earlier magnets had to be long to avoid being demagnetized by the internal ﬁelds produced
by the poles at the ends, new magnets can be mounted in a variety of thin products that
can be applied to the body with the magnetic ﬁeld emanating from the surface.
Magnetic products are typically of two kinds: those whose north and south poles al-
ternate, and those with only one pole facing out. Many magnetic therapy products have
alternating arrays of north and south poles facing the patient. Some have detailed expla-
nations of why a circular array of poles is optimal, while others oﬀer poles in checkerboard
or triangular arrays. Nikken, the Japan-based ﬁrm that has used a multilevel marketing
scheme to expand from an annual business in the US of $3 million in 1989 to $150 million
in 1998, primarily oﬀers products with alternating poles.
The diﬀerence between such multipolar and unipolar magnetic devices is the “reach”
of the magnetic ﬁeld. The ﬁeld from even unipolar magnets decreases very rapidly with
increasing distance from the magnet, but the ﬁeld from multipolar magnets decreases much
more rapidly. If multipolar magnets really have any eﬀects on the human body, they will
be limited to depths of penetration of only a few millimeters. (Many refrigerator magnets
are multipolar, which limits the thickness of paper they can hold to the refrigerator, but
also limits the damage they can do to nearby credit and ATM cards.)
Most promoters of magnetic therapy recognize the need for oﬀering some plausible ex-
planation.
The broadest explanation has been presented by Kyochi Nakagawa, MD, of
Japan, who claims that many of our modern ills result from “Magnetic Field Deﬁciency
Syndrome.” The Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is known to have decreased about 6% since 1830,
and indirect evidence suggests that it may have decreased as much as 30% over the last
millennium. He argues that magnetic therapy simply provides some of the magnetic ﬁeld
that the Earth has lost.
In response to this claim we can also say that over the past 10,000 years (the last Ice
Age), the Earth temperature has risen considerably, and this may be the cause of “our
modern ills.” Maybe we are suﬀering from “Ice Deﬁciency Syndrome,” and we need to put

ice cubes around our neck and ankles! Or perhaps due to the eradication of malaria in most
parts of the world, many of our modern ills result from “Mosquito Deﬁciency Syndrome.”
To cure this, we may have to take a sizable dose of mosquito larva every day! When we
accept—without any scientiﬁc evidence—the eﬀect of one thing on another, any arbitrary
phenomenon can be the cause of any other phenomenon. (See Food for Thought 13.3.3 for
further discussion of magnetic therapy.)

A Project for the Reader
We have dissected psychoanalysis and some branches of alternative medicine with the scalpel
of scientiﬁc characteristics to further clarify the diﬀerence between science and what claims
to be science. You can take any other discipline claiming to be scientiﬁc (e.g., if it ends in
“-ology” or “-ics” or has the word “science” in its name), put it to the test of some of the
characteristics of science, and decide whether or not that discipline is indeed science. As a
ﬁrst step, go through its literature and history as much as you can; ﬁnd out about some
of the major scholars of the discipline; compare their writings and look for opposing views.
Then go back to Chapter 42 and put the discipline to the test of the characteristics in that
chapter. For example, ask yourself the following questions:21
1. Does the discipline study matter?
2. Does observation play a fundamental role in the discipline?
21This list is not necessarily exhaustive.

Section 43.5
A Project for the Reader
659
3. Does the discipline have historical continuity?
4. Does the discipline study the parts to understand the whole?
If the answer to any of the above questions is “no,” then the discipline is not science.
The ﬁrst two items are sometimes hard to evaluate. A discipline whose practitioners do
nothing but put a hamburger on the table and stare at it may be argued to aﬃrm the ﬁrst
two questions. The ﬁrst two questions are more useful when their answers are “no.” For
example, in the case of psychoanalysis, the answers are “no,” and one can conclude without
asking any further question that psychoanalysis is not science.
The third and fourth items are easier to evaluate, and usually give away the true nature of
the discipline. If upon examination of the history of the discipline you ﬁnd that generations
of “scientists” simply trampled the “theories” of the older generations, or if the “theorists”
keep going back and forth between contradictory ideas, you are dealing with a discipline
that is not scientiﬁc. Similarly, if the discipline studies a “whole” but does not care about
the parts, their structure, what they are made of, how they interact among themselves, etc.,
you have to raise doubts about the scientiﬁc nature of the discipline.

29.9 The one on Moon runs the fastest. The one on Earth runs the slowest.
29.11 Mercury is closest to Sun; therefore gravity is strongest there, and GTR eﬀects more
pronounced. The eﬀect for other planets is too small to measure.
29.17 First the gas is isotropic and homogeneous. Later it is not.

31.3 (a) 938.78 MeV. (b) 938.779986 MeV.
31.5 Stability means how hard it is to break the nucleus apart. The minimum energy
required to break the nucleus apart is the energy needed to separate one nucleon from the
nucleus. The larger the binding energy per nucleon, the larger this minimum energy.
31.7 No.
31.11 Carbon 14.
31.13 Decays take place because of neutron excess. The larger the ratio N/Z, the less
stable the nucleus and thus more likely the decay.
Alpha emission increases this ratio,
especially when N and Z are small.
31.15 In a nucleus the process can take place because of the existence of the binding energy:
the proton can borrow some BE and create a neutron. A free proton cannot do that.
31.17 No.
31.19 With too many protons and neutrons, the nucleus becomes less stable. So breaking
into smaller nuclei is energetically favorable.
31.21 No. Splitting a light nucleus (to the left of the peak of the stability curve of Fig-
ure 31.1) would create less stable nuclei.
