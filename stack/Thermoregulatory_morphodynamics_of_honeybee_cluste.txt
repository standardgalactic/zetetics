Abstract
During reproductive swarming, honeybees form clusters of more than 10,000 bees that
hang from structures in the environment (e.g., tree branches) and are exposed to diurnal
variations in ambient temperature for up to one week during the search for a new nesting site.
Swarm clusters collectively modulate their morphology in response to these variations (i.e.,
expanding/contracting in response to heating/cooling) to maintain their internal temperature
within a tolerable range and to avoid exhausting their honey stores prematurely. To understand
the spatiotemporal aspects of thermoregulatory morphing, we measured the change in size
and shape of swarm clusters over time and the internal temperature proﬁles in response to
dynamic temperature ramp perturbations. We found that swarm clusters can achieve a twofold
increase/decrease their volume/density when heated from 15◦C to 30◦C, but they do not reach
an equilibrium size or shape when held at 30◦C for 5 hours, long after the core temperature of
the cluster has stabilized. Furthermore, the changes in cluster shape and size are hysteretic,
contracting in response to cooling faster than expanding in response to heating. Although the
contact diameter of the cluster increased continuously when the swarm is heated, the change
in length of the swarm (base to tip) over time is non-monotonic. Consequently, the aspect
ratio of the swarm ﬂuctuated continuously even when held at a constant temperature. Taken
together, our results quantify the hysteretic and anisotropic morphological responses of swarm
clusters to ambient temperature variations while suggesting that both mechanical constraints
and heat transfer govern the thermoregulatory morphing dynamics of swarm clusters.
Introduction
Many social hymenopterans (i.e., ants, wasps and bees) engage in a class of collective behaviors
in which individuals link their bodies together to form self-assembled structures such as rafts
[13], bridges [19], droplets [2] and clusters [8]. These behaviors often serve adaptive functions,
aiding in ﬂood survival, predator evasion, food transport, navigation of complex environments,
etc. (see Anderson et al. [1] for a review). The microenvironment within these aggregates is
an extended phenotype of the colony that can give rise to emergent physiological functions. For
example, bivouacs and clusters formed by army ants [6] and honeybees [9] are able to maintain
relatively stable internal temperatures despite large variations in ambient temperature. Study-
ing these behaviors can provide insight into how the interplay between collective behavior and
microenvironment can lead to colony-level physiology.
In honeybee swarm clusters that can have of the order of ≈10, 000 bees that settle on a tree
branch (Fig. 1), exposure to a variable environment for days while scouts seek new nest sites
[21] causes the cluster to modulates its morphology in an attempt to maintain a relatively stable
microenvironment.
For example, when exposed to rain, the bees on the surface of the cluster
adjust their posture to collectively shed water much like a tiled roof does [4], while in response to
mechanical perturbations (such as being shaken by the wind), the cluster collectively ﬂattens out
and increases its attachment area to reduce mechanical strain on the cluster and increase its overall
stability [18]. Swarm clusters also modulate their morphology in response to changes in ambient

temperatures in order to maintain relatively stable internal temperatures, expanding to dissipate
heat when ambient temperatures rise and contracting to conserve heat when ambient temperatures
drop [8, 9].
Here, we investigate this behavior by quantifying the extent of thermoregulatory
adaptation via morphological variation.
Early experiments pioneered by Heinrich [8] measured the core and surface temperature swarm
clusters across a broad range of ﬁxed ambient temperatures (1 −35◦C). In large clusters(> 15000
bees), the core temperature of large swarms was relatively stable across this range at 35 −36◦C,
while in small swarms (< 10000 bees) the temperature was more variable, ranging from 20 −
35◦C. When the ambient temperature was below ≈17◦C, the surface temperatures were actively
maintained at ≈17◦C through shivering (i.e., vibration of the thorax) in order to prevent chill
coma (i.e., cold-induced immobilization). At ambient temperatures greater than ≈17◦C the surface
temperatures were maintained a few degrees above ambient temperature. Heinrich’s observations
showed that the cluster increased its volume and surface area dramatically as ambient temperatures
rose from 17 to 26◦C, allowing more metabolic heat to dissipate and avoiding overheating. As
ambient temperature dropped below 17◦C the cluster reduced its surface area and increase its
density to conserve metabolic heat. The change in size/shape below 17◦C was subtle suggesting
that bees may approach their maximum density. Heinrich also measured the collective metabolic
rate of the cluster and showed that oxygen consumption increased linearly as ambient temperature
rose above 17◦C and increased even more steeply as ambient temperatures dropped below 17◦C.
Taken together, these results suggested that the swarm modulates its metabolic rate below 17◦C
to prevent chill-coma and modulates its morphology above 17◦C to minimize energetic costs and
to prevent overheating [8].
Thermoregulation in swarm clusters is an intriguing multi-scale control problem wherein indi-
vidual bees (2cm) presumably sense/respond only to local information and yet collectively they
achieve relatively stable cluster (10 −30cm) temperatures. A simple way to explain this global
regulation is to recognize that it can emerge from coupling between local behaviors, the (geomet-
rical and topological) structure of the cluster and the environmental physics of heat transfer that
both enables and constrains function, as studied quantitatively in bees, termites etc. [15, 10, 3].
The speciﬁc problem of thermoregulation in bee clusters has been the subject of many theoret-
ical studies [16, 17, 11, 5, 14, 23, 22, 15]. All models involve the conduction and convection of
heat in a metabolically active materials and some include "thermotactic" behaviors in which bees
modulate their activity according to local temperature [14, 23, 22, 15]. These models focus pri-
marily on the steady state behavior of the loaded network of bees that are assumed to be able to
rapidly equilibrate with the environment by instantaneously breaking and reforming attachments
between neighboring bees. A natural question that remains open is that of the morphodynamics
of thermoregulation.
To understand the dynamics of swarm thermoregulation, here we focus on measuring the change
in size, shape and temperature proﬁles of swarm clusters over time in response to dynamic tem-
perature ramp perturbations. This allows us to measure the dynamical morphological response
of the system and thus shed light on the temporally transient and spatially anisotropic collective
behaviors that arise from local responses of individual bees.

Methods
Artiﬁcial swarms
The artiﬁcial swarm clusters used in experiments consisted of packages of honeybees purchased
from New England Beekeeping in Tyngsboro, Massachusetts in the spring of 2017 and 2018. These
packages consisted of approximately 1 kg of European honeybees Apis mellifera and a caged queen.
For at least two days prior to the experiments the bees were fed ad libitum 2:1 sugar water solution,
which is known to induce natural swarming behavior [20].
Experimental Apparatus
The experimental setup consisted of a 1.2 × 1.5 × 1.2 m box constructed from 3.8 × 8.9 cm di-
mensional lumber and insulated with a double layer of press-ﬁt 2.5-cm Styrofoam sheets (Fig.
2A). Two window air conditioners were inserted into holes at the bottom left and right corners
of one of the walls of the box, and three small space heaters were placed in the corners of the

box. Four temperature sensors were suspended in the airspace of the box and connected to an
Arduino microcontroller. The heaters and air conditioners were toggled on and oﬀin response to
this temperature feedback in order to maintain a desired set-point temperature. This set-point
temperature was modulated by a Matlab program to achieve controlled heating and cooling cycles.
Two wooden struts were used to support a scale (Ohaus Ranger 3000) approximately 10 cm
from the roof of the box, and a 60-cm diameter wooden board was hung from the scale (Fig.
2B). The queen cage was ﬁxed to the underside of this board with wires. The rest of the bees
were allowed to form a cluster around the queen until the mass reported by the scale was stable,
indicating that all of the bees had joined the swarm cluster. The bees were allowed to ﬂy freely,
both within the box and to ﬂy in/out of a 0.25×1 m window in the side of the box which connected
to the outdoors. This allowed the swarm to send scouts in search of new nest sites. In preliminary
attempts using a completely closed box we found that the bees would continuously search for an
opening in the box to escape from if they were not given freedom to ﬂy in/out of the window and
the mass of the cluster would not stabilize.
Each experiment was 10-16 hours long. Initially, the air temperature in the box was held at
15◦C for 4 hours, then ramped up to 30◦C for 5 hours, and ﬁnally ramped back down to 15◦C for
an additional 4 hours. Three heating/cooling rates were tested: 33.4◦C/hr (n = 6), (B) 8.6◦C/hr
(n = 9) and (C) 4.3◦C/hr (n = 5). On warm, sunny days the bees would occasionally ﬂy oﬀas
if to a new nest site only to return to cluster around the caged queen. This behavior became so
disruptive that some of the trials were conducted over night. See Table S1 for a list of dates/times
of individual trials as well as for the ID of the swarms used.
Image acquisition and analysis
A machine vision camera (1.3 MP, Point Grey Chameleon3) was placed 50 cm from the board
supporting the cluster and an LED back light (50 × 100 cm) was placed orthogonal to the camera
on the other side of the swarm. During each data collection bout, the back light was switched
on and the camera was rotated 360 degrees around the swarm (Fig. 2B, Movie S1). Images were
captured every 9 degrees of rotation resulting in 40 unique views of the swarm (Movies S1 and
S2). When the revolution was complete, the back light was turned oﬀto avoid luring bees away
from the cluster. This ﬁlming routine was executed approximately every 4 minutes during the
experiment. The mass of the swarm was also continuously recorded throughout the experiment.
Prior to analysis, each image of the swarm was undistorted using Matlab’s checkerboard cali-
bration tool (to correct for wide-angle lens geometry). The checkerboard was placed orthogonal to
the camera at the axis of rotation so that images in that plane could be converted from pixels to
centimeters. A custom Matlab image segmentation program was then used to deﬁne a wire frame
silhouette of the cluster in each of the 40 views (Fig. 2D). Because the cluster was rarely centered
at the camera’s axis of rotation, the silhouette of the cluster appeared to loom and recede during
the camera’s rotation. To correct for this, each silhouette was transformed such that its dimensions
(i.e., diameter and length) equaled the average dimensions of the set of 40 silhouettes (Fig. 2E).
The silhouettes were then averaged to achieve a single 2D approximation of the proﬁle shape of the
cluster centered at the axis of rotation (Fig. 2F). The diameter D of the swarm and the length L
cluster were determined using this averaged silhouette. The perimeter of the averaged silhouette
was revolved around the vertical axis to create an axisymmetric, 3D approximation of the shape of
the cluster, and to determine its surface area A and volume V (Fig. 2G, Movie S4). We chose to
use this method rather than hull reconstruction because it was more robust to bees ﬂying in front
of the camera (which was a persistent problem).
Recording internal temperature proﬁles
We used a custom sensor array (Fig. 2C) to record the internal temperature proﬁle of a single
swarm cluster over the course of two experiments with two diﬀerent heating/cooling rates (i.e.,
33.4◦C/hr and 8.6◦C/hr). We also attempted to record the internal temperature of a cluster at
a heating/cooling rate of 4.3◦C/hr, but we later noticed that the bees had begun building comb
on the sensor array. Bees elevate their body temperatures in order to build comb, which would
confound our experiments. Therefore, we excluded this trial.
The sensor array consists of a printed circuit board (PCB) with 32 temperature sensors (i.e.,
10k-ohm glass bead NTC linear response thermistors) spaced every 0.89 cm along the length of
the PCB. To ensure that the sensors measured the temperature of the air and/or bees within the

cluster rather than the surface temperature of the PCB itself, the sensors were suspended by their
lead wires inside of 0.32 cm holes in the PCB, such that the glass bead was not in direct contact
with the PCB. In order to avoid self-heating, a digital switch was used to ensure that the sensors
received power only while the measurement was being made (i.e., about 500ms). Measurements
from all 32 sensors were recorded every 10 seconds throughout the experiment. The sensors were
calibrated by running a temperature ramp experiment without the swarm present and ﬁtting a
linear model relating the output voltages to air temperature.
Results
The scaled change in each response variable (i.e., mass ˆ
M, volume ˆV , density ˆρ, area ˆA, diameter
ˆD, length ˆL) is is plotted in Figure 3A-C. Each variable y is scaled by dividing the change in that
variable by the initial value, ˆy = (y(t) −y(0))/y(0). This removes the dependence on the sizes of
the clusters, which were variable. See Table S1 for initial conditions for each response variable.
Changes in the Mass of Cluster
The clusters lose 8-10% of their initial mass over the course of a heating/cooling experiment (Fig.
3A-C). Although we did not quantify the source of this weight loss, we noticed several potential
sources of weight loss. First, we noticed that wax scales accumulated on the ﬂoor of the box during
the experiments. Honeybees regularly produce wax scales in preparation for colonizing a new nest
site [7]. In addition, some of the loss may be attributed to attrition of bees, as some dead bees
accumulated on the ﬂoor of the box. However, this did not appear to be enough to account for
the 8-10% weight loss. It is also possible that some of the weight loss resulted from bees leaving
the box and failing to return to the swarm, though scouts appeared to move in and out of the box
with ease. In fact, on a few occasions between experiments the entire swarm ﬂew out the window
(likely toward a newly selected nest sight), only to return to the box after discovering that their
queen was not with them. In these instances, the mass of the swarm was similar before and after
its departure, suggesting that the bees did not struggle to ﬁnd their way back to the box.
Interestingly, the rate of weight loss was aﬀected by the ambient air temperature (Fig. 3A-C,
panel 2). The clusters lost weight at an average rate of 2.8%/hr during the 30◦C plateau and was
virtually constant during the ﬁnal 15◦C plateau. This temperature dependent weight loss is not
unexpected, as [9] demonstrated that the metabolic rate of swarms increases two fold from 15◦C to
30◦C. Both behavioral mechanisms of weight loss (e.g., bees getting lost) and physiological mech-
anisms of weight loss (e.g., wax excretion, metabolic water loss, respiration, death of individuals)
are likely to be aﬀected by metabolic rate.
Morphological Response
To characterize the morphology of the swarm cluster, we measured the volume and area of the
cluster as well as its diameter and height as a function of the imposed temperature perturbations,
as shown in Figure 3A-C (see Table S2 for summary statistics). When the temperature was raised
from 15◦C to 30◦C the clusters nearly doubled in volume, but never actually reached a steady state,
even after a 5-hour heating phase. However, when the temperature was dropped to 15◦C during
the cooling phase, the volume V returned to the initial volume V0 within 2 hours for treatments 1
and 2, but did not quite return to V0 for treatment 3. Similar dynamics were observed for surface
area, although it did not quite return to its initial value by the end of the experiments. As expected
given the doubling in cluster volume, the density of the clusters was approximately halved by the
end of the heating phase.
We expected both the diameter and the length of the cluster to increase monotonically during
heating and decrease monotonically during cooling. However, while diameter increased monoton-
ically during heating and reached nearly 50% of its initial value, length showed a non-monotonic
response. In fact, length initially increased upon heating but reached a peak and began to fall
before the end of the 30◦C plateau. During cooling, diameter decreased monotonically and nearly
reached its initial value by the end for the experiment. Length, however, rapidly decreases upon
cooling, overshooting its initial value and ﬁnally begins to rise again during the 15◦C plateau,
almost reaching its initial value.

Internal Temperature Variation
Since the morphological response is correlated with the internal temperature proﬁle of the cluster,
we measured this along the central axis of a swarm cluster during experiments at two diﬀerent
heating/cooling rates (i.e., 33.4◦C/hr and 8.6◦C/hr), using the setup is depicted in Figure 3F, and
presented in Figure 3D-E. In both experiments, the core of the swarm was generally less variable and
warmer (30-36◦C) than the mantle (19-33◦C) which typically remained several degrees above the
ambient temperature when above 15◦C. These results are in agreement with previous reports from
Heinrich [9] and are consistent with the hypothesis that the bees attempt to maintain temperatures
between a lower bound (≈17◦C) and an upper bound (36◦C).
At the beginning of a heating protocol, the mantle began to warm immediately, but there was a
lag in the onset of heating at the core of the swarm of about 0.5 hrs for the 33.4◦C/hr experiment
and 1 hr for the 8.6◦C/hr. This lag was reﬂected by a corresponding lag in the morphological
response of the cluster as evidenced by the delayed increase in volume and surface area. These
observations are consistent with the morphological response to heating being triggered/driven by
bees in the interior of the swarm responding to a gradually rising local temperature due to the
conduction, diﬀusion and convection of heat from the boundary.
However, the core temperature of the swarm was signiﬁcantly lower at the end of that ex-
periments than the initial core temperature. This suggests that the swarm cluster is particularly
susceptible to cooling after extended periods at high temperatures, consistent with the fact that
clusters reduced their density by about 50% and increased their aspect ratio during the 30◦plateau.
The cluster is able to rapidly decrease its length in response to cooling in order to increase its den-
sity and conserve heat. However this results in a sub-optimal, high aspect-ratio shape (short and
wide) with a high surface area-to-volume ratio. When the cluster is already at high density, recov-
ering a lower aspect ratio shape with a low surface area-to-volume ratio seems to be a slow process.
The slow return to a compact shape may be responsible for the observed over-cooling of the core.
Hysteresis
To better understand the nonlinear response of the cluster to dynamic temperature perturbations,
we ﬁt the mean ˆV and ˆA to simple ﬁrst-order kinetic response functions associated with the slowest
time scale τ in the relaxation processes at play, assumed to be of the form dr/dt = (s(t) −r(t))/τ,
where r(t) is the response to a given stimulus s(t) (see Fig. 4A-B).
For the response to an increase in the temperature (i.e., expansion of the cluster), we ﬁt the
response to
yexp = ymax(1 −e−t/τexp)
where yexp is the response variable, τexp is the time constant of the response, and ymax is the value
at which y would eventually saturate if allowed enough time. For the response to a decrease in the
temperature (i.e., contraction of the cluster), we ﬁt the response variable to
ycont = y1(1 −e−t/τcont)
where y1 is the value of y at the start of the cooling ramp. For all trials, the timescale of volumet-
ric expansion was higher than that of contraction, indicating that expansion occurs more slowly
than does contraction (Fig. 4C-D). This diﬀerence in expansion/contraction timescales was more
pronounced for slow heating/cooling treatments than for fast heating/cooling treatments.
We
observed an even more dramatic diﬀerence in surface area expansion and contraction timescales.
Taken together, this suggests that the expansion/contraction response shows strong hysteresis.
Neither ˆV nor ˆA reached saturation during the ﬁve hour long 30◦C plateau. The parameters
ˆVmax and ˆAmax from the response model are estimates of the maximum values that ˆV and ˆA would
have reached if the 30◦C plateau was suﬃciently long (Fig. 4E-F). We expected that Vmax and
Amax would be constants, however they appear to decrease with the heating rate of the treatment.
This suggests that the ﬁnal volume and surface area of the cluster are greater if you heat them
more slowly.
Anisotropy and Shape Changes
The changes in diameter ˆD and length ˆL are plotted together in Figure 5A-C to highlight their
diﬀerent but coupled dynamics. The scaled change in aspect ratio ˆR = (R(t) −R(0))/R(0) is

plotted in Panel 2, where aspect ratio is the ratio of width to length R = D/L. Key transitions in
the shape/size of the clusters are denoted in Figure 5 by roman numerals (I-V). We note that these
transitions are related to the nature of the heating/cooling ramps, but they are not necessarily
coincident.
The aspect ratio stays approximately constant at the start of each experiment as
diameter and length increase together (I-II). However, length begins to decrease before the end
of the 30◦C plateau causing the aspect ratio to increase (II-III). At the onset of the cooling
ramp, aspect ratio undergoes a sharp increase as cluster length decreases dramatically faster than
diameter leading to an even ﬂatter shape (III-IV). This sharp increase is most pronounced for the
fastest treatment and is nearly absent for the slowest treatment. Finally, the cluster begins to
slowly return to its original shape during the 15◦C plateau (IV-V). Aspect ratio does not quite
return to its initial value by the end of the experiment (V).
These dynamics suggest that there are two distinct phases of the response to heating (Fig. 5E).
In the ﬁrst phase, as heating begins the bees begin to increase their volume and thus decrease their
density relatively quickly, allowing for convective cooling keeping the shape of the cluster invariant.
This of course cannot continue forever owing to the mechanical constraints of keeping the cluster
contiguous and strong enough to support itself. The second phase involves changing the shape of
the cluster subject to keeping the volume (and the mass) constant, but occurs much more slowly.
To quantify the morphological changes, we recall that for a generalized conically shaped cluster
with a base of radius r and height H, we can write
V = Hr2α
where α is a constant associated with the shape of the cluster (for a right cone α = π/3, while for
a cylinder α = π). The diameter and length of the cluster initially increase together to achieve this
increase (decrease) in volume (density), preserving the shape but increasing the size. However, as
the density of the cluster approaches a minimum (below which the structural integrity of the swarm
would likely be compromised), diameter and length can no longer increase together. Instead, the
cluster increases in diameter and decreases in length, i.e. the shape now changes. This allows
the surface area to continue to increase while slowing the increase (decrease) in volume (density),
thereby preventing mechanical failure. The surface area of the cluster is given by
A = πr2 + 2πrl sin β
where β is the half-angle of the cone.
An additional beneﬁt of this change in the shape (i.e.,
ﬂattening of the cluster) is the advantage that it proﬀers from a mechanical perspective, consis-
tent with a recent experimental and theoretical study [18]. This study demonstrated that ﬂatter
swarm clusters with broad attachment areas are more stable than elongated clusters with small
attachment areas (Fig. 6a) because they more eﬃciently distribute the load and further that bees
are able to increase their aspect ratio (and attachment area) in response to imposed mechanical
perturbation. These responses of the bee cluster shape to temperature and mechanical loads sug-
gest that in general the shape is a consequence of the ability of individual bees to respond using
fast limb extension or retraction movements and the slower body repositioning based both on local
temperature and mechanical information.
Discussion
Our study complements and build on the pioneering experimental work of Heinrich [9] on honeybee
swarm clusters that demonstrated their ability to maintain a relatively stable internal temperature
despite dramatic ﬂuctuations in ambient temperature.
The proposed mechanism for this was
postulated to be the modulation of metabolic heating (through shivering) at low temperatures and
by controlled heat dissipation at high temperatures (through collective expansion and contraction
of the cluster). This inspired many mathematical models which treat honeybee swarm clusters as
a metabolically active material which generates heat and also responds by changing its size, shape
and density [16, 17, 11, 5, 14, 23, 22, 15] in response to local temperature information. These
models demonstrate that thermoregulation is possible even without direct communication among
bees due to physical coupling between individuals. However, these studies typically consider the
steady-state of the swarm because previous experiments measured the temperature, metabolic
activity and size of the clusters at ﬁxed temperatures [9, 8].

Our work generalizes this and contributes to the understanding of collective thermoregulation
in swarm clusters by measuring their morphological responses to time-varying temperature per-
turbations. Our results show that expansion and contraction of swarm clusters has two phases, a
fast and a slow phase (Fig. 5).
At the start of the heating ramp the clusters initially increase rapidly in both diameter and
length (phase 1), but then the cluster begins to shorten in length while continuing to increase in
diameter (phase 2). The simultaneous expansion in length and diameter in phase 1 is possible only
until the density of bees approaches a minimum below which the bonds between bees begin to strain
and would eventually break. To avoid this limit, the clusters begin to shorten while increasing their
diameter in phase 2. This allows them to continue to increase their surface area without a dramatic
decrease in density. Alternatively, it is possible that phase 1 of expansion occurs in response to the
derivative of temperature with respect to time, suggesting that monotonic increases in diameter
and length are a strategy used to respond to increasing temperature rather than the absolute
temperature. For the slower 8.6◦C/hr and 4.3◦C/hr, this transition from phase 1 to phase 2 occurs
when the heating ramp ends and the plateau begins, suggesting that phase 2 may be a strategy
used in response to high absolute temperatures. If this is true, the transition may be delayed in
the fastest treatment (33.4◦C/hr) because the internal temperature of the swarm changes more
slowly than does the ambient air (Fig. 3D).
The contraction of the swarm in response to cooling also follows a two phase response. At the
start of the cooling ramp, the cluster initially decreases rapidly in length and decreases more slowly
in diameter (phase I), but when the temperature reaches the 15◦C plateau, the cluster begins to
increase in length as its diameter continues to decrease leading to a decrease in surface area to
volume ratio (phase 2). The rapid shortening of the swarm in phase 1 likely occurs because it is
relatively easy for bees to climb up chains of bees toward the center of the swarm to avoid cooling,
but it is more diﬃcult for bees at the base to move inward because they are bearing the load
of other bees. The transition from phase 1 to phase 2 may occur when the cluster approaches a
maximum density beyond which shortening of the cluster is no longer possible. Alternatively, phase
1 may be a response to the derivative of the temperature ramp and phase 2 may be a response to
the absolute low temperature during the plateau.
The slow, hysteretic and anisotropic nature of the morphological responses of the swarm clusters
to heating and cooling events point to the presence of mechanical constraints on the topological
rearrangements of these loaded networks of interconnected bees. The movement of a bee in response
to local temperature gradients may be limited not only by the local density of bees but also by
the network structure of the cluster and the loading of individual bees. Although the internal
structure of swarm clusters has not been rigorously quantiﬁed due to obvious methodological
challenges, previous observational work has suggested the presence of a dense ’mantle’ of bees on
the surface which push toward the center of the cluster at cool temperatures [9]. The center of the
cluster is thought to be composed by vertically oriented chains of loaded bees (which support the
swarm) as well as caverns in which other unloaded bees which are free to move around [12, 9].
Peleg et al. [18] recently discovered that swarm clusters are able to change their morphology in
response to mechanical perturbations. When a swarm is subjected to horizontal oscillations (simi-
lar to those imposed by a tree branch swaying in the wind), the cluster spreads out to increase its
attachment area, thereby reducing the overall mechanical strain experienced by the cluster. This
collective response requires individual bees to sense local strains and move from regions of low
strain to regions of higher strain in order to stabilize the cluster as a whole. Oscillations with low
accelerations induce little spreading, while oscillations high accelerations lead to lots of spread-
ing, suggesting a graded response. Taken together, these experiments suggest that morphological
responses of swarm clusters to their environmental conditions are multi-functional and require col-
lective multi-sensory integration. Figure 6 illustrates this phase space when the cluster reaches
a steady state (t = inf). At low temperature and low mechanical forcing the swarm is relatively
dense and conical (except when ∆T/T0 < 0 [9]). At high temperatures and mechanical forcing the
swarm tends to increase its attachment area and ﬂatten out. When temperatures are too high,
the cluster may break up (Fig. S1) and when mechanical forcing is too high the cluster may also
break up [9].
Taken together, our results suggest that thermoregulatory morphing behavior by honeybee
swarm clusters in response to ambient temperature ﬂuctuations is relatively slow, hysteretic,
anisotropic and history dependent. As a model system, honeybee swarms can shed light on how
stimulus-response behaviors of individuals and physical coupling through a shared environment

can give rise to collective physiological processes such as thermoregulation. More empirical work is
needed to understand the movements of individual bees, the internal structure of the cluster and
the integration of mechanical and temperature cues.

Figure 2: Experimental setup for quantifying the thermoregulatory response of swarm clusters.
(A) Swarms were housed in a large insulated box, outﬁtted with heaters and coolers that were
toggled on and oﬀto produce controlled temperature perturbations. (B) Within the box, a board
(to which the swarm was attached) was suspended from a scale. A motor was used to revolve
a camera and an opposing back light 360◦around the swarm. (C) In some trials, a PCB with a
32-sensor array (white arrow) was inserted in the swarm cluster to record the temperature gradient
within the swarm. Bars corresponding to D and L indicate the diameter and length of the cluster,
respectively. (D) During each rotation, 40 images of the swarm were captured from diﬀerent angles.
(E) The swarm was segmented from the background of each image using thresholding. (F) The
silhouettes of the 40 images were transformed so that diameter D and length L matched the average
values for the whole set, ¯D and ¯L. (G) An average shape was calculated from the 40 silhouettes,
and this shape was revolved around the z-axis to obtain an axisymmetric, 3D approximation of
the swarm’s shape.

Figure 3: The dynamic response of honeybee swarm clusters to controlled temperature ramp

change in volume ˆV , surface area ˆA, diameter ˆD, length ˆL, density ˆ
rho and mass ˆ
M are plotted for
3 treatments with varying heating/cooling rates: (A) 33.4◦C/hr (n = 9), (B) 8.6◦C/hr (n = 9) and
(C) 4.3◦C/hr (n = 5). The treatment mean is plotted in black and the gray error band indicates
standard deviation. In A and B, the blue line indicates the response for trials in which a sensor
array was used to record internal temperature data (as shown in D-E). Continuous measurements
of the temperature proﬁle within swarm clusters. Internal temperature data is provided for one
trial for two heating/cooling rates 33.4◦C/hr (D) and 8.6◦C/hr (E). The heatmap (top panel)
represents the temperature at various positions y within the cluster over time t, where y = 0 is
base of the swarm and y increases towards the tip of the swarm. Data recorded from sensors
external to the swarm are omitted. In the lower panel, the temperature at the base, core and
mantle of the swarm are plotted over time.

Figure 5: Dynamic changes to the shape of swarm clusters in response to temperature pertur-
bations. In the top panel, the change in length ˆL (green) and ˆD (orange) are plotted over time
for each treatment group (A-C). Each line represents the mean and error bands spans the mean
± standard deviation. In the second panel, The change in the aspect ratio ( ˆR = R/R(0) −1)
relative to the initial aspect ratio (R = D/L). The temperature perturbations are plotted in the
bottom panel to for reference. Key transitions are denoted by roman numerals (I-V). They are not
necessarily coincident with the transitions in the heating/cooling ramps. (D) Averaged silhouettes
of clusters at these transitions are are shown for a representative trial from each treatment group.
(E) The shape of the swarm is represented with a series of cones which change dimensions over
time in response to a temperature ramp perturbation (depicted below). In response to heating
(red cones), the swarm initially expands in diameter and length. However as diameter continues to
increase, length starts to decrease, likely to prevent the density from reaching a minimum density
below which the swarm would break. During cooling (blue cones), the length of the cluster rapidly
shortens. The unloaded bees at the surface likely move upward to ﬁll gaps in the swarm. Initially
bees at the edge of the clusters base are not able to move toward the center of the cluster because
they are loaded (or supporting the weight of other bees). But as the bees below them move in-
ward, they become free to shift as well. This may be why the decrease in diameter lags behind the
decrease in length.

Figure 6: A schematic of the known phase space of honeybee swarm cluster density/shape according
to this and previous studies [18, 9]. Mechanical forcing on the x-axis is reported as ∆g/g0 where
g0 = 9.8m/s2, the acceleration due to gravity. Temperature forcing on the y-axis is reported as
∆T/T0 where T0 = 17◦C. Below T0 the cluster reaches a maximum density and thermoregulates
primarily by modulating metabolic heat production through shivering. The shape of the cluster is
represented by cartoons (not to scale) and the density of the cluster is represented by the color axis.
How the swarm integrates both temperature information and mechanical information to maintain
stability when temperature and mechanical forcing are decoupled is unknown. This provides a
unique opportunity for future study of multi-sensory integration at the colony scale.
