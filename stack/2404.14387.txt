Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have sig-
nificantly advanced in various fields and
intelligent agent applications.
However,
current LLMs that learn from human or
external model supervision are costly and may
face performance ceilings as task complexity
and diversity increase. To address this issue,
self-evolution approaches that enable LLM
to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn
from experiences generated by the model
itself are rapidly growing. This new training
paradigm inspired by the human experiential
learning process offers the potential to scale
LLMs towards superintelligence.
In this
work, we present a comprehensive survey
of self-evolution approaches in LLMs.
We
first propose a conceptual framework for
self-evolution and outline the evolving process
as iterative cycles composed of four phases:
experience acquisition, experience refinement,
updating, and evaluation. Second, we cate-
gorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and
LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the
literature and provide taxonomy and insights
for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing
challenges and propose future directions to
improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping
researchers with critical insights to fast-track
the development of self-evolving LLMs. Our
corresponding GitHub repository is available

Introduction
With the rapid development of artificial intelli-
gence, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-
3.5 (Ouyang et al., 2022), GPT-4 (Achiam et al.,
2023), Gemini (Team et al., 2023), LLaMA (Tou-
vron et al., 2023a,b), and Qwen (Bai et al., 2023)

mark a significant shift in language understand-
ing and generation. These models undergo three
stages of development as shown in Figure 1: pre-
training on large and diverse corpora to gain a gen-
eral understanding of language and world knowl-
edge (Devlin et al., 2018; Brown et al., 2020),
followed by supervised fine-tuning to elicit the
abilities of downstream tasks (Raffel et al., 2020;
Chung et al., 2022). Finally, the human prefer-
ence alignment training enables the LLMs to re-
spond as human behaviors (Ouyang et al., 2022).
Such successive training paradigms achieve signif-
icant breakthroughs, enabling LLMs to perform
a wide range of tasks with remarkable zero-shot
and in-context capabilities, such as question an-
swering (Tan et al., 2023), mathematical reason-
ing (Collins et al., 2023), code generation (Liu
et al., 2024b), and task-solving that require interac-
tion with environments (Liu et al., 2023b).
Despite these advancements, humans anticipate
that the emerging generation of LLMs can be
tasked with assignments of greater complexity,
such as scientific discovery (Miret and Krishnan,
2024) and future events forecasting (Schoenegger
et al., 2024). However, current LLMs encounter
challenges in these sophisticated tasks due to the
inherent difficulties in modeling, annotation, and
the evaluation associated with existing training
paradigms (Burns et al., 2023). Furthermore, the
recently developed Llama-3 model has been trained
on an extensive corpus comprising 15 trillion to-
kens1. It’s a monumental volume of data, suggest-
ing that significantly scaling model performance
by adding more real-world data could pose a limi-
tation. This has attracted interest in self-evolving
mechanisms for LLMs, akin to the natural evolu-
tion of human intelligence and illustrated by AI de-
velopments in gaming, such as the transition from

AlphaGo (Silver et al., 2016) to AlphaZero (Silver
et al., 2017). AlphaZero’s self-play method, requir-
ing no labeled data, showcases a path forward for
LLMs to surpass current limitations and achieve
superhuman performance without intensive human
supervision.
Drawing inspiration from the paradigm above,
research on the self-evolution of LLMs has rapidly
increased at different stages of model development,
such as self-instruct (Wang et al., 2023b), self-
play (Tu et al., 2024), self-improving (Huang et al.,
2022), and self-training (Gulcehre et al., 2023). No-
tably, DeepMind’s AMIE system (Tu et al., 2024)
outperforms primary care physicians in diagnostic
accuracy, and Microsoft’s WizardLM-2 2 exceeds
the performance of the initial version of GPT-4.
Both models are developed using self-evolutionary
frameworks with autonomous learning capabilities
and represent a potential LLM training paradigm
shift. However, the relationships between these
methods remain unclear, lacking systematic organi-
zation and analysis.
Therefore, we first comprehensively investigate
the self-evolution processes in LLMs and estab-
lish a conceptual framework for their development.
This self-evolution is characterized by an iterative
cycle involving experience acquisition, experience
refinement, updating, and evaluation, as shown in
Figure 2. During the cycle, an LLM initially gains
experiences through evolving new tasks and gener-
ating corresponding solutions, subsequently refin-
ing these experiences to obtain better supervision
signals. After updating the model in-weight or in-
context, the LLM is evaluated to measure progress
and set new objectives.
The concept of self-evolution in LLMs has
sparked considerable excitement across various
research communities, promising a new era of
models that can adapt, learn, and improve au-

tonomously, akin to human evolution in response
to changing environments and challenges. Self-
evolving LLMs are not only able to transcend the
limitations of current static, data-bound models but
also mark a shift toward more dynamic, robust,
and intelligent systems. This survey deepens un-
derstanding of the emerging field of self-evolving
LLMs by providing a comprehensive overview
through a structured conceptual framework. We
trace the field’s evolution from the past to the lat-
est cutting-edge methods and applications while
examining existing challenges and outlining future
research directions, paving the way for significant
advances in developing self-evolution frameworks
and next-generation models.
The survey is organized as follows: We first
present the overview of self-evolution (§ 2), includ-
ing background and conceptual framework. We
summarize existing evolving abilities and domains
of current methods(§ 3). Then, we provide in-depth
analysis and discussion on the latest advancements
in different phases of the self-evolution process, in-
cluding experience acquisition (§ 4), experience re-
finement (§ 5), updating (§ 6), and evaluation (§ 7).
Finally, we outline open problems and prospective
future directions (§ 8).

Overview
In this section, we will first discuss the background
of self-evolution and then introduce the proposed
conceptual framework.
2.1
Background
Self-Evolution in Artificial Intelligence. Artifi-
cial Intelligence represents an advanced form of
intelligent agent, equipped with cognitive faculties
and behaviors mirroring those of humans. The as-
piration of AI developers lies in enabling AI to
harness self-evolutionary capabilities, paralleling
the experiential learning processes characteristic of

human development. The concept of self-evolution
in AI emerges from the broader fields of machine
learning and evolutionary algorithms (Bäck and
Schwefel, 1993). Initially influenced by the princi-
ples of natural evolution, such as selection, muta-
tion, and reproduction, researchers have developed
algorithms that simulate these processes to opti-
mize solutions to complex problems. The landmark
paper by Holland (1992), which introduced the
genetic algorithm, marks a foundational moment
in the history of AI’s capability for self-evolution.
Subsequent developments in neural networks and
deep learning have furthered this capability, allow-
ing AI systems to modify their own architectures
and improve performance without human interven-
tion (Liu et al., 2021).
Can Artificial Entities Evolve Themselves?
Philosophically, the question of whether artificial
entities can self-evolve touches on issues of au-
tonomy, consciousness, and agency. While some
philosophers argue that true self-evolution in AI
would require some form of consciousness or self-
awareness, others maintain that mechanical self-
improvement through algorithms does not consti-
tute genuine evolution (Chalmers, 1997). This de-
bate often references the works of thinkers like Den-
nett (1993), who explore the cognitive processes
under human consciousness and contrast them with
artificial systems. Ultimately, the philosophical in-
quiry into AI’s capacity for self-evolution remains
deeply intertwined with interpretations of what it
means to ’evolve’ and whether such processes can
purely be algorithmic or must involve emergent
consciousness (Searle, 1986).
2.2
Conceptual Framework
In the conceptual framework of self-evolution, we
describe a dynamic, iterative process mirroring
the human ability to acquire and refine skills and
knowledge. This framework is encapsulated within
Figure 2, emphasizing the cyclical nature of learn-
ing and improvement. Each iteration of the process
focuses on a specific evolution goal, allowing the
model to engage in relevant tasks, optimize its ex-
periences, update its architecture, and evaluate its
progress before moving to the next cycle.
Experience Acquisition
At the tth iteration, the
model identifies an evolution objective Et. Guided
by this objective, the model embarks on new tasks
T t, generating solutions Yt and receiving feed-
back Ft from the environment, ENV. This stage
culminates in the acquisition of new experiences
(T t, Yt, Ft).
Experience Refinement
After experience acqui-
sition, the model examines and refines these ex-
periences. This involves discarding incorrect data
and enhancing imperfect ones, resulting in refined
outcomes ( ˜T t, ˜Yt).
Updating
Leveraging the refined experiences,
the model undergoes an update process, integrat-
ing ( ˜T t, ˜Yt) into its framework. This ensures the
model remains current and optimized.

Evaluation
The cycle concludes with an eval-
uation phase, where the model’s performance is
assessed through an evaluation in external envi-
ronment. The outcomes of this phase inform the
objective Et+1, setting the stage for the subsequent
iteration of self-evolution.
The conceptual framework outlines the self-
evolution of LLMs, akin to human-like acquisition,
refinement, and autonomous learning processes.
We illustrate our taxonomy in Figure 3.
3
Evolution Objectives
Evolution objectives in self-evolving LLMs serve
as predefined goals that autonomously guide their
development and refinement. Much like humans
set personal objectives based on needs and desires,
these objectives are crucial as they determine how
the model iteratively self-updates. They enable
the LLM to autonomously learn from new data,
optimize algorithms, and adapt to changing envi-
ronments, effectively "feeling" its needs from feed-
back or self-assessment and setting its own goals to
enhance functionality without human intervention.
We define an evolution objective as combining
an evolving ability and an evolution direction. An
evolving ability stands for an innate and detailed
skill. The evolution direction is the aspect of the
evolution objective aiming to improve. We formu-
late the evolution objective as follows:
Et = (At, Dt),
(1)
where Et is the evolution objective, composed by
evolving abilities At and evolution directions Dt.
Take "reasoning accuracy improving" as an exam-
ple, "reasoning" is the evolving ability and "accu-
racy improving" is the evolution direction.
3.1
Evolving Abilities
In Table 1, we summarize and categorize the tar-
geted evolving abilities in current self-evolution
research into two groups: LLMs and LLM Agents.
3.1.1
LLMs
These are fundamental abilities underlying a broad
spectrum of downstream tasks.
Instruction Following: The capability to follow
instructions is essential for effectively applying lan-
guage models. It allows these models to address
specific user needs across different tasks and do-
mains, aligning their responses within the given
context (Xu et al., 2023a).
Reasoning: LLMs can self-evolve to recognize
statistical patterns, making logical connections and
deductions based on the information. They evolve
to perform better reasoning involving methodically
dissecting problems in a logical sequence (Cui and
Wang, 2023).
Math: LLMs enhance the intricate ability to solve
mathematical problems covering arithmetic, math
word, geometry, and automated theorem prov-
ing (Ahn et al., 2024) towards self-evolution.
Coding: Methods improve the LLM coding abil-
ities to generate more precise and robust pro-
grams (Singh et al., 2023; Zelikman et al., 2023).
Furthermore, EvoCodeBench (Li et al., 2024a) pro-
vides an evolving benchmark that updates periodi-
cally to prevent data leakage.
Role-Play: It involves an agent understanding and
acting out a particular role within a given context.
This is crucial in scenarios where the model must
fit into a social structure or follow a set of behaviors
associated with a specific identity or function (Lu
et al., 2024a).
Others: Apart from the above fundamental evolu-
tion objectives, self-evolution can also achieve and
a wide range of NLP tasks (Stammer et al., 2023;
Koa et al., 2024; Gulcehre et al., 2023; Zhang et al.,
2024b,c).
3.1.2
LLM-based Agents
The abilities discussed here are characteristic of
advanced artificial agents used for task-solving or
simulations in digital or physical world. These
capabilities mirror human cognitive functions, al-
lowing these agents to perform complex tasks and
interact effectively in dynamic environments.
Planning: It involves the ability to strategize and
prepare for future actions or goals. An agent with
this skill can analyze the current state, predict the
outcomes of potential actions, and create a se-
quence of steps to achieve a specific objective (Qiao
et al., 2024).
Tool Use: This is the capacity to employ objects
or instruments in the environment to perform tasks,
manipulate surroundings, or solve problems (Zhu
et al., 2024).
Embodied Control: It refers to an agent’s ability
to manage and coordinate its physical form within
an environment. This encompasses locomotion,
dexterity, and the manipulation of objects (Bous-
malis et al., 2023).
Communication: It is the skill to convey informa-
tion and understand messages from other agents

or humans. Agents with advanced communication
abilities can participate in dialogue, collaborate
with others, and adjust their behaviour based on the
communication received (Ulmer et al., 2024).
3.2
Evolution Directions
Examples of evolution directions include but are
not limited to:
Improving Performance: The goal is to continu-
ously enhance the model’s understanding and gen-
eration across various languages and abilities. For
instance, a model initially trained for question an-
swering and chitchat can autonomously extend its
proficiency and develop abilities like diagnostic di-
alogue (Tu et al., 2024), social skills (Wang et al.,
2024e), and role-playing (Lu et al., 2024a).
Adaptation to Feedback: This involves improving
model responses based on feedback to better align
with preferences or adapt to environments (Yang
et al., 2023a; Sun et al., 2024).
Expansion of Knowledge Base: The aim is to con-
tinuously update the model’s knowledge base with
the latest information and trends. For example, a
model might automatically integrate new scientific
research into its responses (Wu et al., 2024).
Safety, Ethic and Reducing Bias: The goal is
to identify and mitigate biases in the model’s re-
sponses, ensuring fairness and safety. One effective
strategy is to incorporate guidelines, such as consti-
tutions or specific rules, to identify inappropriate
or biased responses and corrected through model
updates (Bai et al., 2022; Lu et al., 2024b).

Experience Acquisition
Exploration and exploitation (Gupta et al., 2006)
are fundamental strategies for learning in humans
and LLMs. Among that, exploration involves seek-
ing new experiences to achieve objectives and
is analogous to the initial phase of LLM self-
evolution, known as experience acquisition. This
process is crucial for self-evolution, enabling the
model to autonomously tackle core challenges such
as adapting to new tasks, overcoming knowledge
limitations, and enhancing solution effectiveness.
Furthermore, experience is a holistic construct, en-
compassing not only the tasks encountered (Dewey,
1938) but also the solutions developed to address
these tasks (Schön, 2017), and the feedback (Boud
et al., 2013) received as a result of task perfor-
mance.
Inspired by that, we divide experience acquisi-

tion into three parts: task evolution, solution evo-
lution, and obtaining feedback. In task evolution,
LLMs curate and evolve new tasks aligning with
evolution objectives. For solution evolution, LLMs
develop and implement strategies to complete these
tasks. Finally, LLMs may optionally collect feed-
back from interacting with the environment for
further improvements.
4.1
Task Evolution
To gain new experience, the model first evolves
new tasks according to the evolution objective Et
in the current iteration. Task evolution is the crucial
step in the engine that starts the entire evolution
process. Formally, we denote the task evolution as:
T t = fT (Et, Mt),
(2)
where fT is the task evolution function. Et, Mt,
and T t denote the evolution objective, the model,
and the evolved task at iteration t, respectively.
We summarize and categorize existing studies on
the task evolution method fT into three groups:
Knowledge-Based, Knowledge-Free, and Selective.

Table 1: Overview of self-evolution methods, detailing approaches across evolutionary stages. Key: Pos (Positive),
Neg (Negative), R (Rationale-based), I (Interactive), S (Self-play), G (Grounded), C (Contrastive), P (Perturbative),
Env (Environment), In-W (In-Weight), In-C (In-Context), IF (Instruction-Following). For the evolution objectives,
Adaptation to Feedback is in green, Expansion of Knowledge Base is in blue, and Safety, Ethic and Reducing Bias
is in brown. Improving Performance is in the default color, black.
We detail each type in the following parts and show
the concepts in Figure 4.
Knowledge-Based
The objective Et may asso-
ciate with external knowledge to evolve where the
knowledge is not inherently comprised in the cur-
rent LLMs. Explicitly sourcing from knowledge
enriches the relevance between tasks and evolution
objectives. It also ensures the validity of relevant
facts in the tasks. We delve into the Knowledge-
Based methods seeking to evolve new tasks of the
evolving objective assisted by external information.
The first kind of knowledge is structured. Struc-
tured knowledge is dense in information and well-
organized. Self-Align (Sun et al., 2024) curates
topic-guided tasks generated covering 20 scientific
topics such as scientific and legal expertise. Apart
from topic knowledge, DITTO (Lu et al., 2024a)
includes character knowledge from Wikidata and

Wikipedia. The knowledge comprises attributes,
profiles, and concise character details for role-play
conversations. SOLID (Askari et al., 2024) gener-
ates structured entity knowledge as conversation
starters.
The second group consists of tasks evolving
from an unstructured context. Unstructured con-
text is easy to obtain but is sparse in knowledge.
UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023) gathers unstructured
knowledge of 20 types of text materials based on
30 meta-concepts to construct conversation tasks.
SciGLM (Zhang et al., 2024b) derives questions
from the text of diversified science subjects, which
covers rich scientific knowledge. EvIT (Tao et al.,
2024a) derives event reasoning tasks based on
large-scale unstructured events mined from the un-
supervised corpus. Similarly, MEEL (Tao et al.,
2024b) evolves multi-modal events in both image
and text to construct the tasks for MM event rea-
soning.
Knowledge-Free
Unlike previous methods that
require extensive human effort to gather external
knowledge, Knowledge-Free approaches operate
independently using the evolving object Et and the
model itself. These efficient methods can generate
more diversified tasks without additional knowl-
edge restrictions.
First, the LLMs can prompt themselves to gener-
ate new tasks according to Et. Self-Instruct (Wang
et al., 2023b; Honovich et al., 2022; Roziere et al.,
2023) is a typical methodology of Knowledge-Free
task evolution. These methods self-generate a va-
riety of new task instructions based on evolution
objectives. Ada-Instruct (Cui and Wang, 2023)
further proposes an adaptive task instruction gener-
ation strategy that fine-tunes open-source LLMs to
generate lengthy and complex task instructions for
code completion and mathematical reasoning.
Second, extending and boosting original tasks in-
creases the quality of instructions. WizardLM (Xu
et al., 2023a) proposes Evol-Instruct that evolves
instruction following tasks with in-depth and in-
breadth evolving and further expands it in code
generation (Luo et al., 2024).
MetaMath (Yu
et al., 2023b) rewrites the question in multiple
ways, including rephrasing, self-verification, and
FOBAR. It evolves a new MetaMathQA dataset for
fine-tuning LLMs to improve mathematical task-
solving. Promptbreeder (Fernando et al., 2023)
evolves seed tasks via mutation prompts. It further
evolves mutation prompts via the hyper mutation
prompts to increase the task diversity.
Third, deriving tasks from plain text is another
way. Backtranslation (Li et al., 2023b) extracts self-
contained segments in unlabelled data and regards
it as the answers to tasks. Similarly, Kun (Zheng
et al., 2024b) presents a task self-evolving algo-
rithm utilizing instruction harnessed from unla-
belled data towards back-translation.
Selective
Instead of task generation, we may start
with large-scale existing tasks. At each iteration,
LLMs can select tasks that exhibit the highest rel-
evance to the current evolving objective Et with-
out additional generation. This approach obviates
the intricate curation of new tasks, streamlining
the evolution process (Zhou et al., 2024; Li et al.,
2023a; Chen et al., 2023a).
A simple task selecting method is to randomly
sample tasks from the task pool like REST (Gul-
cehre et al., 2023), RESTem (Singh et al., 2023),
and GRATH (Chen and Li, 2024) do. Rather than
random selection, DIVERSE-EVOL (Wu et al.,
2023) introduces a data sampling technique where
the model selects new data points based on their
distinctiveness in the embedding space, ensur-
ing diversity enhancement in the chosen subset.
SOFT (Wang et al., 2024c) then splits the initial
training set. Each iteration selects one chunk of the
split set as the evolving task.
Li et al. (2024b) propose Selective Reflection-
Tuning and select a subset of tasks via a novel met-
ric calculating to what extent the answer is related
to the question. V-STaR (Hosseini et al., 2024) se-
lects the correct solutions in the previous iteration
and adds their task instructions to the task set of
the next iteration.
4.2
Solution Evolution
After obtaining evolved tasks, LLMs solve the tasks
to acquire the corresponding solution. The most
common strategy is to generate the solution directly
according to the task formulation (Zelikman et al.,
2022; Gulcehre et al., 2023; Singh et al., 2023;
Zheng et al., 2024b; Yuan et al., 2024). However,
this straightforward approach might reach solutions
irrelevant to the evolution objective, leading to sub-
optimal evolution (Hare, 2019). Therefore, solution
evolution uses different strategies to solve tasks and
enhance LLM capabilities by ensuring that solu-
tions are not just generated but are also relevant
and informative. In this section, we comprehen-
sively survey these strategies and illustrate them in

Figure 5: Solution evolution. Et, T t, and Yt are the evolving objective, task, and solution of tth iteration. R is the
rational thought.
Figure 5. We first formulate the solution-evolution
as follows:
Yt = fY(T t, Et, Mt),
(3)
where fY is the model’s strategy to approach the
evolution objective.
We then categorize these methods into positive
and negative according to the correctness of the
solutions. The positive methods introduce various
approaches to acquire correct and desirable solu-
tions. On the contrary, negative methods elicit and
collect undesired solutions, including unfaithful or
mis-align model behaviors, which are then used for
preference alignment. We elaborate on the details
of each type in the following sections.
4.2.1
Positive
Current studies explore diverse methods beyond
vanilla inference for positive solutions to obtain
correct solutions aligned with evolution objectives.
We categorize the task-solving process into four
types: Rationale-Based, Interactive, Self-Play, and
Grounded.
Rationale-Based
The model incorporates ratio-
nale explanations towards approaching the evolv-
ing objective when solving the tasks and can self-
evolve by utilizing such rationales. These meth-
ods enable models to explicitly acknowledge the
evolution objective and complete this task in that
direction (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2024; Besta
et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2022).
Huang et al. (2022) proposes a method where
an LLM self-evolves using "high-confidence"
rationale-augmented answers generated for unla-
beled questions. Similarly, STaR (Zelikman et al.,
2022) generates rationale when solving the task.
If the answer is wrong, it further corrects the ra-
tionale and the answer. Then, it uses the answer
and rationale as experiences to fine-tune the model.
Similarly, LSX (Stammer et al., 2023) proposes the
novel paradigm to generate an explanation of the
answer, incorporating an iterative loop between a
learner module performing a base task and a critic
module that assesses the quality of explanations
given by the learner. Song et al. (2024); Yang et al.
(2024c) obtain rationales in the ReAct (Yao et al.,
2022) style when solving the tasks. The rationales
are further engaged in training the agents in the
following step.
Interactive
Models can interact with the envi-
ronment to enhance the evolution process. These
methods can obtain environmental feedback that is
valuable for guiding self-evolution directions.
SelfEvolve and LDB (Jiang et al., 2023; Zhong
et al., 2024a) improve code generation ability via
self-evolution. They allow the model to generate
code and acquire feedback via running the code
on the interpreter. As another environment, Song
et al. (2024); Yang et al. (2024c) interact in em-
bodied scenarios and acquire feedback. They learn
to take proper actions based on their current state.
For agent abilities, AutoAct (Qiao et al., 2024)
introduces self-planning from scratch, focusing
on an intrinsic self-learning process. In this pro-
cess, agents enhance their abilities through recur-
sive planning iterations with environment feedback.
Following AutoAct, (Zhu et al., 2024) further en-
hances agent training by integrating self-evolution

and an external action knowledge base. This ap-
proach guides action generation and boosts plan-
ning ability through environment-driven corrective
feedback loops.
Self-Play
It’s the situation where a model learns
to evolve by playing against copies of itself. Self-
play is a powerful evolving method because it en-
ables systems to communicate with themselves to
get feedback in a closed loop. It’s especially ef-
fective in environments where the model can sim-
ulate various sides of the roles, like multi-player
games (Silver et al., 2016, 2017). Compared with
interactive methods, self-play is an effective strat-
egy to obtain feedback without an environment.
Taubenfeld et al. (2024) investigate the system-
atic biases in simulations of debates by LLMs.
On the contrary to debating, Ulmer et al. (2024)
engage LLMs in conversations following gener-
ated principles.
Another kind of conversation
via role-playing. Lu et al. (2024a) proposes self-
simulated role-play conversation. The process in-
volves instructing the LLM with character profiles
and aligning its responses to maintain consistency
with the character’s knowledge and style. Simi-
larly, Askari et al. (2024) propose SOLID to gen-
erate large-scale intent-aware role-play dialogues.
This self-playing aspect harnesses the expansive
knowledge of LLMs to construct information-rich
exchanges that streamline the dialog generation
process. Wang et al. (2024e) introduces a novel ap-
proach whereby each LLM follows a role and com-
municates with each other to achieve their goals.
Grounded
To reach the evolving objective and
reduce exploration space, models can be grounded
on existing rules (Sun et al., 2024) and previous
experiences for further explicit guidance when solv-
ing the tasks.
LLMs can generate desirable solutions more ef-
fectively by being grounded on pre-defined rules
and principles.
For instance, Self-Align (Sun
et al., 2024) generated self-evolved questions
with principle-driven constraints to guide the task-
solving process. SALMON (Sun et al., 2023) de-
sign a set of combined principles that requires
the model to follow when solving the task. Self-
Talk (Ulmer et al., 2024) ensures the LLMs gen-
erate a workflow-aligned conversation based on
preset agent characters. They generate the work-
flow in advance based on GPT-4.
Besides pre-defined rules, grounding on previous
experiences can improve the solutions. Memory-
Bank (Zhong et al., 2024b) and TiM (Liu et al.,
2023a) answer current questions by incorporating
previous question-answer records. Rather than pre-
vious solution histories, MoT (Li and Qiu, 2023),
IML (Wang et al., 2024a), and TRAN (Yang et al.,
2023b) incorporate induced rules from the histo-
ries to answer new questions. MemGPT (Packer
et al., 2023) combines these merits and retrieves
previous questions, solutions, induced events, and
user portrait knowledge.
4.2.2
Negative
In addition to acquiring positive solutions, recent
research illustrates that LLMs can benefit from
negative ones for self-improvement (Yang et al.,
2023b). This strategy is analogous to trial and er-
ror in human behavior when learning skills. This
section summarises typical methods of gaining neg-
ative solutions to assist in self-evolution.
Contrastive
A widely used group of methods is
to collect multiple solutions for a task and then
contrast the positive and negative ones to get im-
provements.
Self-Reward, SPIN (Yuan et al., 2024; Chen
et al., 2024) updates the model by comparing
the answers of high and low scores. Similarly,
GRATH (Chen and Li, 2024) generates both cor-
rect and incorrect answers.
It then trains the
model by comparing these two answers.
Self-
Contrast (Zhang et al., 2024c) contrasts the dif-
ferences and summarizes these discrepancies into
a checklist that could be used to re-examine and
eliminate discrepancies. In ETO (Song et al., 2024),
the model interacts with the embodied environment
to complete tasks and optimizes from the failure
solutions. A3T (Yang et al., 2024c) improves ETO
by adding rationale after each action for solving
tasks. STE (Wang et al., 2024b) implements trial
and error where the model solves the tasks with
unfamiliar tools. It learns by analyzing failed at-
tempts to improve problem-solving strategies in fu-
ture tasks. More recently, COTERRORSET (Tong
et al., 2024) obtains incorrect solutions generated
by PALM-2 and proposes mistake tuning, which
requires the model to void making mistakes.
Perturbative
Compared to Contrastive, Pertur-
bative methods seek to add perturbations to obtain
negative solutions intentionally. Models can later
learn to avoid generating these negative answers.
Adding perturbations to obtain negative solutions
is more controllable than contrastive methods.

Figure 6: Types of Feedback. Et and Yt are the evolving
objective and task solutions of tth iteration.
Some methods add perturbation to generate
harmful solutions (Yang et al., 2023a; Liu et al.,
2024a). Given a task, RLCD (Yang et al., 2023a)
curates both positive and negative instructions
and generates positive and negative solutions.
DLMA (Liu et al., 2024a) gathers both positive and
negative instructional prompts and subsequently
produces corresponding positive and negative solu-
tions.
Rather than harmful perturbation, incorporating
negative context is another way. Ditto (Lu et al.,
2024a) adds negative persona characters to gener-
ate incorrect conversations. The model then learns
from the negative conversations to evolve persona
dialogue ability.
4.3
Feedback
As humans learn skills, feedback plays a critical
role in demonstrating the correctness of the solu-
tions. This key information enables humans to
reflect and then update their skills. Akin to this
process, LLMs should obtain feedback during or
after the task solution in the cycle of self-evolution.
We formalize the process as follows:
Ft = fF(T t, Yt, Et, Mt, ENV),
(4)
where fF is the method to acquire feedback.
In this part, we summarize two types of feedback.
Model feedback refers to gathering the critique
or score rated by the LLMs themselves. Besides,
Environment denotes the feedback received directly
from the external environment. We illustrate these
concepts in Figure 6.
4.3.1
Model
Current studies demonstrate that LLMs can play
well as a critic (Zheng et al., 2024a). In the cycle
of self-evolution, the model judges itself to acquire
the feedback of the solutions.
One type of feedback is a score that indicates
correctness.
Self-Reward (Yuan et al., 2024),
LSX Stammer et al. (2023), and DLMA (Liu et al.,
2024a) rate their own solutions and output the
scores via LLM-as-a-Judge prompting. Similar
to that, SIRLC (Pang et al., 2023) utilizes self-
evaluation results of LLM as the reward for further
reinforcement learning. Self-Alignment (Zhang
et al., 2024e) leverages the self-evaluation capabil-
ity of an LLM to generate confidence scores on the
factual accuracy of its outputs.
Another type provides a textual description, of-
fering multi-dimensional information.
To alter
the distribution of the responses via supervised
learning, CAI (Bai et al., 2022) asks the model
to critique its response according to a principle in
the constitution. In contrast to supervised learn-
ing and reinforcement learning approaches, Self-
Refine (Madaan et al., 2023) allows the model to
generate natural language feedback on its own out-
put in a few-shot manner.
4.3.2
Environment
Another form of feedback comes from the envi-
ronment, common in tasks where solutions can be
directly evaluated. This feedback is precise and
elaborate and can provide sufficient information
for model updating. They may be derived from
code interpreter (Jiang et al., 2023; Chen et al.,
2023c; Shinn et al., 2024), tool execution (Qiao
et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2023), the embodied
environment (Bousmalis et al., 2023; Xu et al.,
2024b; Zhou et al., 2023b), and other LLMs or
agents (Wang et al., 2024e; Taubenfeld et al., 2024;
Ulmer et al., 2024).
For code generation, Self-Debugging Chen et al.
(2023c) utilizes execution results on test cases as
part of feedback while SelfEvolve (Jiang et al.,
2023) receives the error message from the inter-
preter. Similarly, Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) also
obtains the run-time feedback from the code inter-
preter. It then further reflects to generate thoughts.
This run-time feedback contains the trace-back in-
formation that can point out the key information
for improved code generation.
Recently, methods endow tool-using ability to
LLMs and agents. Executing tools leading to feed-

back in return (Gou et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024;
Song et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024c; Wang et al.,
2024b).
RoboCat (Bousmalis et al., 2023) and Sin-
ViG (Xu et al., 2024b) act in the robotic embodied
environment. This type of feedback is precise and
strong to guide self-evolution.
Communication feedback is common and effec-
tive in LLM-based multi-agent systems. Agents
can correct and support each other, enabling co-
evluation (Wang et al., 2024e; Taubenfeld et al.,
2024; Ulmer et al., 2024).
5
Experience Refinement
After experience acquisition and before updating in
self-evolution, LLMs may improve the quality and
reliability of their outputs through experience re-
finement. It helps LLMs adapt to new information
and contexts without relying on external resources,
leading to more reliable and effective assistance in
dynamic environments. This process is formulated
as follows:
˜T t, ˜Yt = fR(T t, Yt, Ft, Et, Mt),
(5)
where fR is the methods of experience refinement,
˜T t, ˜Yt are the refined tasks and solutions. We clas-
sify the methods into two categories: filtering and
correcting.
5.1
Filtering
Refinement in self-evolution involves two primary
filtering strategies: Metric-Based and Metric-Free.
The former uses external metrics to assess and filter
outputs, while the latter does not rely on these met-
rics. This ensures that only the most reliable and
high-quality data is utilized for further updating.
5.1.1
Metric-Based
By relying on feedback and pre-defined criteria,
metric-based filtering improves the quality of the
outputs (Singh et al., 2023; Qiao et al., 2024; Ulmer
et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023b), ensuring the pro-
gressive enhancement of LLM capabilities through
each iteration of refinement.
For example, ReSTEM (Singh et al., 2023) incor-
porates a reward function to filter the dataset sam-
pled from the current policy. The function provides
binary rewards based on the correctness of the gen-
erated samples rather than a learned reward model
trained on human preferences in ReST (Gulcehre
et al., 2023). AutoAct (Qiao et al., 2024) leverages
F1-score and accuracy as rewards for synthetic tra-
jectories and collects trajectories with exactly cor-
rect answers for further training. Self-Talk (Ulmer
et al., 2024) measures the number of completed
subgoals to filter the generated dialogues, ensuring
that only high-quality data is used for training. To
encourage diversity of the source instructions, Self-
Instruct (Wang et al., 2023b) automatically filters
low-quality or repeated instructions using ROUGE-
L similarity and heuristics before adding them to
the task pool.
The filtering criteria or metrics are crucial for
maintaining the quality and reliability of the gen-
erated outputs, thereby ensuring the continuous
improvement of the model’s capability.
5.1.2
Metric-Free
Some methods seek filtering strategies beyond ex-
ternal metrics, making the process more flexible
and adaptable. Metric-Free filtering typically in-
volves sampling outputs and evaluating them based
on internal consistency measures or other model-
inherent criteria (Huang et al., 2022; Weng et al.,
2023; Chen et al., 2022). The filtering in Self-
Consistency (Wang et al., 2022) is based on the
consistency of the final answer across multiple gen-
erated reasoning paths, with higher agreement indi-
cating higher reliability. LMSI (Huang et al., 2022)
utilizes CoT prompting plus self-consistency for
generating high-confidence self-training data.
Designing internal consistency measures that ac-
curately reflect output quality can be challenging.
Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2023) allows the
model to select the candidate answer with the high-
est interpretable verification score, calculated by
assessing the consistency between the predicted
and original condition values. For the code genera-
tion task, CodeT (Chen et al., 2022) considers both
the consistency of the outputs against the generated
test cases and the agreement of the outputs with
other code samples.
These methods emphasize the language model’s
ability to self-assess and filter its outputs based
on internal agreement, showcasing a significant
step forward in self-evolution without the direct
intervention of external metrics.
5.2
Correcting
Recent advancements in self-evolution have high-
lighted the significance of iterative self-correction,
which enables models to refine their experiences.

Figure 7: Experience refinement.
two categories: Critique-Based and Critique-Free
correction. Critiques often serve as strong hints
that include the rationale behind perceived errors
or suboptimal outputs, guiding the model towards
improved iterations.
5.2.1
Critique-Based
These methods rely on additional judging processes
to draw the critiques of the experiences. Then,
the experiences are refined based on the critiques.
By leveraging either self-generated (Madaan et al.,
2023; Bai et al., 2022; Shinn et al., 2023; Lu et al.,
2023) or environment-interaction generated cri-
tiques (Gou et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Zhou
et al., 2023b), the model benefits from detailed
feedback for nuanced correction.
LLMs have demonstrated their ability to iden-
tify errors in their outputs. Self-Refine (Madaan
et al., 2023) introduces an iterative process in which
the model refines its initial outputs conditioned on
actionable self-feedback without additional train-
ing. To evolve from the correction, CAI (Bai et al.,
2022) generates critiques and revisions of its out-
puts in the supervised learning phase, significantly
improving the initial model. Applied to an agent
automating computer tasks, RCI (Kim et al., 2023)
improves its previous outputs based on the critique
finding errors in the outputs.
Since weaker models may struggle significantly
with the self-critique process, several approaches
enable models to correct the outputs using critiques
provided by external tools. CRITIC (Gou et al.,
2023) allows LLMs to revise the output based on
the critiques obtained during interaction with tools
in general domains. SelfEvolve (Jiang et al., 2023)
prompts an LLM to refine the answer code based
on the error information thrown by the interpreter.
ISR-LLM (Zhou et al., 2023b) helps the LLM plan-
ner find a revised action plan by using a validator
in an iterative self-refinement process.
The primary advantage of this method lies in its
ability to process and react to detailed feedback,
potentially leading to more targeted and nuanced
corrections.
5.2.2
Critique-Free
Contrary to critique-based, critique-free methods
correct the experiences directly leveraging objec-
tive information (Zelikman et al., 2022; Chen et al.,
2023c,b; Gero et al., 2023). These methods offer
the advantage of independence from nuanced feed-
back that critiques provide, allowing for corrections
that adhere strictly to factual accuracy or specific
guidelines without the potential bias introduced by
critiques.
One group of critique-free methods modifies
the experiences on the signal of whether the task
was correctly resolved.
Self-Taught Reasoner
(STaR) (Zelikman et al., 2022) proposes a tech-
nique that iteratively generates rationales to answer
questions. If the answers are incorrect, the model
is prompted again with the correct answer to gener-
ate a more informed rationale. Self-Debug (Chen
et al., 2023c) enables the model to perform debug-
ging steps by investigating execution results from
unit tests and explaining the code on its own.
Different from depending on the task-solving sig-
nal, other information produced during the solving
process can be leveraged. IterRefinement (Chen
et al., 2023b) relies on a series of refined prompts
that encourage the model to reconsider and im-
prove upon its previous outputs without any direct
critique. For information extraction tasks, Clini-
cal SV (Gero et al., 2023) grounds each element

in evidence from the input and prunes inaccurate
elements using supplied evidence.
These critique-free approaches simplify the cor-
rection mechanism, allowing for easier implemen-
tation and faster adjustments.

Updating
After experience refinement, we enter the crucial
updating phase that leverages the refined experi-
ences to improve model performance. We formu-
late updating as follows:
Mt+1 = fU( ˜T t, ˜Yt, Et, Mt),
(6)
where fU is the updating functions. These update
methods keep the model effective by adapting to
new experiences and continuously improving per-
formance in changing environments and during
iterative training.
We divide these approaches into in-weight learn-
ing, which involves updates to model weights, and
in-context learning, which involves updates to ex-
ternal or working memory.
6.1
In-Weight
Classical training paradigms in updating LLMs in
weight encompass continuous pretraining (Brown
et al., 2020; Roziere et al., 2023), supervised fine-
tuning (Longpre et al., 2023), and preference align-
ment (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a).
However, in the iterative training process of self-
evolving, the core challenge lies in achieving over-
all improvement and preventing catastrophic for-
getting, which entails refining or acquiring new
capabilities while preserving original skills. Solu-
tions to this challenge can be categorized into three
main strategies: replay-based, regularization-based,
and merging-based methods.
6.1.1
Replay-based
Replay-based methods reintroduce previous data
to retain old knowledge. One is experience re-
play, which mixes the original and new training
data to update LLMs (Roziere et al., 2023; Yang
et al., 2024c; Zheng et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024;
Wang et al., 2023a). For example, Rejection sam-
pling Fine-Tuning (RFT) (Yuan et al., 2023) and
Reinforced Self-Training (ReST) (Gulcehre et al.,
2023; Aksitov et al., 2023) method iteratively up-
dates large language models by mixing seed train-
ing data with filtered new outputs generated by the
model itself. AMIE (Tu et al., 2024) utilizes a self-
play simulated learning environment for iterative
improvement and mixes generated dialogues with
supervised fine-tuning data through inner and outer
self-play loops. SOTOPIA-π (Wang et al., 2024e)
leverages behavior cloning from the expert model
and self-generated social interaction trajectory to
reinforce positive behaviors.
Another is generative replay, which adopts the
self-generated synthesized data as knowledge to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. For instance, Self-
Synthesized Rehearsal (SSR) (Huang et al., 2024a)
generates synthetic training instances for rehearsal,
enabling the model to preserve its ability without
relying on real data from previous training stages.
Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT) (Yang et al.,
2024b) generates a distilled dataset from the model
itself to bridge the distribution gap between task
datasets and the LLM’s original distribution to mit-
igate catastrophic forgetting.
6.1.2
Regularization-based
Regularization-based
methods
constrain
the
model’s updates to prevent significant deviations
from original behaviors, exemplified by function-
and weight-based regularization. Function-based
regularization focuses on modifying the loss
function that a model optimizes during training
(Zhong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023). For exam-
ple, InstuctGPT (Ouyang et al., 2022) employs a
per-token KL-divergence penalty from the output
probabilities of the initial policy model πSFT on the
updated policy model πRL. FuseLLM (Wan et al.,
2024) employs a technique akin to knowledge
distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), leveraging the
generated probability distributions from source
LLMs to transfer the collective knowledge to the
target LLM.
Weight-based regularization (Kirkpatrick et al.,
2017) directly targets the model’s weights dur-
ing training. Techniques such as Elastic Reset
(Noukhovitch et al., 2024) counters alignment drift
in RLHF by periodically resetting the online model
to an exponentially moving average of its previous
states. Furthermore, Ramé et al. (2024) introduced
WARM, which combines multiple reward models
through weight averaging to address reward hack-
ing and misalignment. Moreover, AMA (Lin et al.,
2024) adaptively average model weights to opti-
mize the trade-off between reward maximization
and forgetting mitigation.

˜Yt represent refined experiences, each containing task and corresponding solutions, respectively. Mt denotes the
updated model.
6.1.3
Architecture-based
Architecture-based methods explicitly utilize ex-
tra parameters or models for updating, includ-
ing decomposition- and merging-based approaches.
Decomposition-based methods separate large neu-
ral network parameters into general and task-
specific components and only update the task-
specific parameters to mitigate forgetting. LoRA
(Hu et al., 2021; Dettmers et al., 2024) inject train-
able low-rank matrices to significantly reduce the
number of trainable parameters while maintaining
or improving model performance across various
tasks. This paradigm is later adopted by GPT4tools
(Yang et al., 2024a), OpenAGI (Ge et al., 2024)
and Dromedary (Sun et al., 2024). Dynamic Con-
PET (Song et al., 2023) combines pre-selection
and prediction with task-specific LoRA modules to
prevent forgetting, ensuring scalable and effective
adaptation of LLMs to new tasks.
Merging-based methods, on the other hand, in-
volve combining multiple models or layers to
achieve general improvements, including but not
limited to merging multiple generic and specialized
model weights into a single model (Wortsman et al.,
2022; Ilharco et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2023a; Yadav
et al., 2024), through mixture-of-expert approach
(Ding et al., 2024) or even layer-wise merging and
up-scaling such as EvoLLM (Akiba et al., 2024).
6.2
In-Context
In addition to directly updating model parameters,
another approach is to leverage the in-context capa-
bilities of LLMs to learn from experiences, thereby
enabling fast adaptive updates without expensive
training costs. The methods could be divided into
updating external and working memory.
External Memory
This approach utilizes an ex-
ternal module to collect, update, and retrieve past
experiences and knowledge, enabling models to
access a rich pool of insights and achieve better
results without updating model parameters. The ex-
ternal memory mechanism is common in AI Agent
systems (Xu et al., 2023b; Qian et al., 2024; Wang
et al., 2024d). This section provides a detailed
overview of the latest methods for updating ex-
ternal memory, emphasizing the aspects of mem-
ory Content and Updating Operations, and summa-
rized in Table 2.
Content: External memory mainly stores two
type of content: past experiences and reflected
rationale, each serving distinct purposes. For in-
stance, past experience provide valuable historical
context, serving as a guiding force toward achiev-
ing improved outcomes. MoT (Li and Qiu, 2023)
archives filtered question-answer pairs to construct
a beneficial memory repository. Additionally, the
FIFO Queue mechanism in MemGPT (Packer et al.,
2023) maintains a rolling history of messages, en-
capsulating interactions between agents and users,
system notifications, and inputs and outputs of func-
tion calls.
On the other hand, reflected rationales offer
condensed explanations, such as rules, that sup-
port decision-making. For instance, TRAN (Yang
et al., 2023b) archives rules inferred from experi-
ences alongside information on mistakes to miti-

gate future errors. Correspondingly, TiM (Liu et al.,
2023a) preserves inductive reasoning, defined as
text elucidating the relationships between entities.
Moreover, IML (Wang et al., 2024a) and ICE (Qian
et al., 2024) store comprehensive notes and rules
derived from a series of trajectories, demonstrating
the broad spectrum of content types that memory
systems can accommodate.
MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2024b) and AesopA-
gent (Wang et al., 2024d) establish both experience
and reflection knowledge stores, which are the in-
tegration of both two memories.
Updating Operation: We categorize the opera-
tions to the memory into Insert, Reflect, and For-
get. The most common operation is insert, meth-
ods insert text content into the memory for stor-
age (Li and Qiu, 2023; Yang et al., 2023b; Zhong
et al., 2024b; Packer et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a;
Wang et al., 2024a). Another operation is reflection,
which is to think and summarize previous experi-
ences to conceptualize rules and knowledge for
future use (Yang et al., 2023b; Zhong et al., 2024b;
Wang et al., 2024a; Qian et al., 2024). Last, due to
the limited storage of memory, forgetting content
is crucial to keeping memory efficient and the con-
tent valid. MemGPT (Packer et al., 2023) adopts
the FIFO queue to forget the contents. Memory-
Bank (Zhong et al., 2024b) establishes a forgetting
curve on the insert time of each item.
Working Memory
The methods use past expe-
rience to evolve the capabilities of agents by up-
dating internal memory streams, states, or beliefs,
known as working memory, often in the form of ver-
bal cues. Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023) introduces
verbal reinforcement learning for decision-making
improvement without conventional model updates.
Similarly, IML (Wang et al., 2024a) enables LLM-
based agents to autonomously learn and adapt to
their environment by summarizing, refining, and
updating knowledge based on past experience di-
rectly in working memory.
EvolutionaryAgent (Li et al., 2024c) aligns
agents with dynamically changing social norms
through evolution and selection principles, lever-
aging environmental feedback for self-evolution.
Agent-Pro (Zhang et al., 2024d) employs policy-
level reflection and optimization, allowing agents
to adapt their behavior and beliefs in interactive
scenarios based on past outcomes. Lastly, ProA-
gent (Zhang et al., 2024a) enhances cooperation in
multi-agent systems by dynamically interpreting
teammates’ intentions and adapting behavior.
These collective works demonstrate the impor-
tance of integrating past experiences and knowl-
edge into the agents’ memory stream to refine
their state or beliefs for improved performance and
adaptability across various tasks and environments.

Evaluation
Much like the human learning process, it is essen-
tial to ascertain whether the present level of ability
is adequate and meets the application requirements
through evaluation. Furthermore, it is from these
evaluations that one can identify the direction for
future learning. However, how to accurately assess
the performance of an evolved model and provide
directions for future improvements is a crucial yet
underexplored research area. For a given evolved
model Mt, we conceptualize the evaluation process
as follows:
Et+1, St+1 = fE(Mt, Et, ENV),
(7)
where fE represents the evaluation function that
measures the performance score (St+1) of the cur-
rent model and provide evolving goal (Et+1) for
the next iteration. Evaluation function fE can be

categorized into quantitative and qualitative ap-
proaches, each providing valuable insights into
model performance and areas for improvement.
7.1
Quantitative Evaluation
This method focuses on providing measurable met-
rics to reliably assess LLM performance, such as
automatic (Papineni et al., 2002; Lin, 2004) and
human evaluation. However, traditional automatic
metrics struggle to accurately evaluate increasingly
complex tasks, and human assessment is not an
ideal option for autonomous self-evolution. Recent
trends use LLMs as human proxy for automatic
evaluators, offering cost-effective and scalable so-
lutions for evaluations.
For example, reward model score has been
widely used to measure model or task performances
(Shinn et al., 2024) and select the best checkpoint
(Ouyang et al., 2022). LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng
et al., 2024a) using LLMs to evaluate LLMs, em-
ploying methods like pairwise comparison, single
answer grading, and reference-guided grading. It
shows that LLMs can closely match human judg-
ment, enabling efficient large-scale evaluations.
7.2
Qualitative Evaluation
Qualitative evaluation involves case studies and
analysis to derive insights, offering evolving guid-
ance for subsequent iterations. Initiatives such as
LLM-as-a-judge (Zheng et al., 2024a) provide the
reasoning behind its assessments; ChatEval (Chan
et al., 2023) explores the strengths and weaknesses
of model outputs through debate mechanisms. Fur-
thermore, TRAN (Yang et al., 2023b) leverages
past errors to formulate rules that enhance future
LLM performances. Nonetheless, compared with
instance-level critic or reflection, qualitative evalu-
ation at the task- or model-level still needs compre-
hensive investigation.
8
Open Problems
8.1
Objectives: Diversity and Hierarchy
Section 3 summarizes existing evolution objectives
and their coverage. Nonetheless, these highlighted
objectives can only satisfy a small fraction of the
vast human needs. The extensive application of
LLMs across various tasks and industries high-
lights unresolved challenges in establishing self-
evolution frameworks for evolving objectives that
can comprehensively address a broader spectrum
of real-world tasks (Eloundou et al., 2023).
Furthermore, the concept of evolving objectives
entails a potential hierarchical structure; for in-
stance, UltraTool (Huang et al., 2024b) and T-
Eval (Chen et al., 2023d) categorize the capability
of tool usage into various sub-dimensions. Ex-
ploring evolutionary objectives into manageable
sub-goals and pursuing them individually emerges
as a viable strategy.
Overall, a clear and urgent need exists to develop
self-evolution frameworks that effectively address
diversified and hierarchical objectives.
8.2
Level of Autonomy: From Low to High
Self-evolution in large models is emerging, yet
lacks clear definitions for its autonomous levels.
We categorize self-evolution into three tiers: low,
medium, and high-level autonomy
Low-level
In this level, the user predefined the
evolving object E and it remains unchanged. The
user needs to design the evolving pipeline, namely
all modules f•, on its own. Then, the model com-
pletes the self-evolution process based on the de-
signed framework. We denote this level of self-
evolution in the following formula:
˜M = EvolL(M, E, f•, ENV),
(8)
where M denotes the model to be evolved. ˜M is the
evolving output. ENV is the environment. Most of
the current works lie at this level.
Medium-level
In this level, the user only sets the
evolving object E and keeps it unchanged. The
user doesn’t need to design the specific modules f•
in the framework. The model can construct each
module f• independently for self-evolution. This
level denotes as follows:
˜M = EvolM(M, E, ENV),
(9)
High-level
In the final level, the model diagnoses
its deficiency and constructs the self-evolution
methods to improve itself. This is the ultimate
purpose of self-evolution. The user model sets its
own evolving object E according to the evaluation
fE output. The evolving objective would change
during the iteration. Besides, the model designs the
specific modules f• in the framework. We repre-
sent this level as:
˜M = EvolH(M, ENV),
(10)

As discussed in previous open problem (§ 8.1),
there are a large of unfulfilled objectives. How-
ever, most of the existing self-evolution frame-
works are at the Low-level which requires specif-
ically designed modules (Yuan et al., 2024; Lu
et al., 2024a; Qiao et al., 2024). These frameworks
are objective-dependent and rely on large human
efforts to develop. Exhausting all objectives are
not deployment-efficient which brings about the
urgent need to develop medium and high levels
self-evolution frameworks. At the medium level,
it doesn’t require expert efforts to design specific
modules. LLMs can self-evolve according to tar-
geted objectives. Then at the high level, LLMs can
investigate their current deficiencies and evolve in
a targeted manner. In all, developing highly au-
tonomous self-evolution frameworks remains an
open problem.
8.3
Experience Acquisition and Refinement:
From Empirical to Theoretical
Suppose we have addressed the previous two chal-
lenges that we have developed promising self-
evolution frameworks, the exploration of self-
evolution LLMs lacks solid theoretical grounding.
This idea posits that LLMs can self-improve or cor-
rect their outputs, with or without feedback from
the environment. However, the mechanisms be-
hind it remain unclear. Studies show mixed results:
Huang et al. (2023) observed self-corrective be-
havior in models with over 22 billion parameters,
while Ganguli et al. (2023) finds LLMs struggle
to self-correct reasoning errors without external
feedback.
A related challenge is the use of self-generated
data for learning. Critics argue this approach could
reduce linguistic diversity (Guo et al., 2023) and
lead to "model collapse," where models fail to cap-
ture complex, long-tailed data distributions (Shu-
mailov et al., 2023). Furthermore, Alemohammad
et al. (2023) reveal that generative models trained
on their synthetic outputs progressively lose out-
put quality and diversity. Fu et al. (2024) extend
this by theoretically analyzing the impact of self-
consuming training loops on model performance,
emphasizing the importance of balancing synthetic
and real data to mitigate error accumulation.
Recent studies (Yang et al., 2024c; Singh et al.,
2023) also show that current methods struggle
to improve after more than three rounds of self-
evolution. One hypothesized reason is that the self-
critic of LLM has not co-evolved with the evolving
objective, but more experimental and theoretical
support is still needed. These findings highlight a
pressing need for more theoretical exploration in
self-evolving LLMs. Addressing these concerns
is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring that
models can effectively learn and improve over time.
8.4
Updating: Stability-Plasticity Dilemma
The stability-plasticity dilemma represents a cru-
cial yet unresolved challenge that is essential for
iterative self-evolution. This dilemma reflects the
difficulty of balancing the need to retain previ-
ously learned information (stability) while adapting
to new data or tasks (plasticity). Existing LLMs
either overlook this issue or adopt conventional
methods that may be ineffective. While training
models from scratch could mitigate the problem
of catastrophic forgetting, it is highly inefficient,
particularly as model parameters increase expo-
nentially and autonomous learning capabilities ad-
vance. Finding a balance between acquiring new
skills and preserving existing knowledge is crucial
for achieving effective and efficient self-evolution,
leading to overall improvement.
8.5
Evaluation: Systematic and Evolving
To effectively assess LLMs, a dynamic, compre-
hensive benchmark is crucial. This becomes even
more pivotal as we progress towards Artificial Gen-
eral Intelligence (AGI). Traditional static bench-
marks risk obsolescence due to LLMs’ evolving
nature and potential access to test data through
interacting with environments, such as search en-
gines, undermining their reliability. A dynamic
benchmark, like Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2023a), pro-
poses a solution by creating an LLM-based environ-
ment tailored for evaluating the social intelligence
of LLMs, thereby avoiding the limitations posed
by static benchmarks.
8.6
Safety and Superalignment
The advancement of LLMs opens the possibility for
AI systems to achieve or even surpass expert-level
capabilities in both supportive and autonomous
decision-making. For safety, ensuring these LLMs
align with human values and preferences is crucial,
particularly to mitigate inherent biases that can im-
pact areas such as political debates, as highlighted
by Taubenfeld et al. (2024). OpenAI’s initiative,
Superalignment (Leike and Sutskever, 2023), aims
to align a superintelligence by developing scalable
training methods, validating models for alignment,

and stress-testing the alignment process through
scalable oversight (Saunders et al., 2022), robust-
ness (Perez et al., 2022), automated interpretability
(Bills et al., 2023), and adversarial testing. Al-
though challenges remain, Superalignment marks
an initial attempt to develop a self-evolving LLM
that closely aligns with human ethics and values in
a scalable way.

Conclusion
The evolution of LLMs towards self-evolution
paradigms represents a transformative shift in artifi-
cial intelligence akin to the human learning process.
It is promising to overcome the limitations of cur-
rent models that rely heavily on human annotation
and teacher models. This survey presents a compre-
hensive framework for understanding and develop-
ing self-evolving LLMs, structured around iterative
cycles of experience acquisition, refinement, updat-
ing, and evaluation. By detailing advancements and
categorizing the evolution objectives within this
framework, we offer a thorough overview of cur-
rent methods and highlight the potential for LLMs
to adapt, learn, and improve autonomously. We
also identify existing challenges and propose direc-
tions for future research, aiming to accelerate the
progress toward more dynamic, intelligent, and effi-
cient models. This work deepens the understanding
of self-evolving LLMs. It paves the way for signifi-
cant advancements in AI, marking a step towards
achieving superintelligent systems capable of sur-
passing human performance in complex real-world
tasks.
