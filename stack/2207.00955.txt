We discuss the question of whether or not inﬂationary spacetimes can be geodesically complete in
the inﬁnite past. Geodesic completeness is a necessary condition for averting an initial singularity
during eternal inﬂation.
It is frequently argued that cosmological models which are expanding
suﬃciently fast (having average Hubble expansion rate Havg > 0) must be incomplete in null and
timelike past directions. This well-known conjecture relies on speciﬁc bounds on the integral of the
Hubble parameter over a past-directed timelike or null geodesic. As stated, we show this claim is an
open issue. We show that the calculation of Havg yields a continuum of results for a given spacetime
predicated upon the underlying topological assumptions. We present an improved deﬁnition for
Havg and introduce an uncountably inﬁnite cohort of cosmological solutions which are geodesically
complete despite having Havg > 0. We discuss a standardized deﬁnition for inﬂationary spacetimes
as well as quantum (semi-classical) cosmological concerns over physically reasonable scale factors.

INTRODUCTION
One of the oldest problems of philosophy is
whether the universe had an ultimate origin.
In
the context of relativistic cosmology, that is usually
translated into the question of whether there was
a past singularity. In standard Friedmann Robert-
son Walker (FRW) big bang models, causal develop-
ment of the initial curvature singularity is indeed a
past boundary of spacetime. By contrast, the once-
popular steady-state cosmological model, involving
the continuous creation of particles [1–3], is eternal.
Criticism of the big bang theory by advocates of the
steady-state theory were summed up by the apho-
rism that ‘it merely claims things are as they are
because they were as they were.’ In other words, the
observed nature of the universe is simply relegated to
unexplained initial conditions, and speciﬁcally to its
ordered, low-entropy, initial state. However, in the
steady state model the theory is also incomplete, but
for a diﬀerent reason. The metric for a FRW space
is given as:
ds2 = −dt2 + f 2(t)

dr2
1 −kr2 + r2dΩ2

(1)
with f being the scale factor and k being the spa-
tial constant sectional curvature, usually normalized
to k ∈{0, +1, −1}, and dΩ2 being the usual spher-
ical metric. The steady state universe is described
as a patch of de Sitter space with f (t) = eHt and
∗Email:jlesnefs@asu.edu

‡ Email:Paul.Davies@asu.edu
k = 0. The steady state universe, which expands at
all times, occupies one-half of the complete de Sitter
manifold (topologically R1
1 × Sn−1).
A coordinate
system that covers the entire de Sitter spacetime is
given by the metric of Eq. 1 with f = cosh (Ht)
and k = +1.
It describes a universe that con-
tracts to a minimum radius and then expands in
a time-symmetric manner.
Consider a world line
r = constant in the latter system. Tracing back in
time from future inﬁnity, the world line traverses the
steady state patch and eventually crosses the edge of
the coordinate system, and hence out of the steady
state universe. Clearly the steady state universe is
geodesically incomplete. Recognizing this shortcom-
ing, Hoyle and Narlikar proposed a modiﬁed theory
[1–3] using the entire spacetime, which involved a
contraction followed by an expansion. This so-called
C-ﬁeld cosmology approaches the steady state in the
far future and far past and can be made time sym-
metric by assuming matter creation to be oppositely
directed in the regions t > 0 and t < 0. A closely
analogous issue arises in the case of eternal inﬂation,
in which the ‘units of creation’ are not subatomic
particles but ‘bubble universes.’ A simple model of
eternal inﬂation uses the steady state metric outside
of the bubbles, and is therefore geodesically incom-
plete.
However, this model can be amended with
a minimum spacelike diameter, just like the full de
Sitter case, which is complete.
Some confusion arises from the ambiguous use of
the term ‘universe.’
One deﬁnition is the entire
spacetime, including all extensions, e.g. metric f =
cosh (Ht) and k = +1 in the foregoing example. An-
other deﬁnition is a congruence of worldlines orthog-
onal to a spacelike foliation bounded by horizons, e.g.
steady state metric in the foregoing. A steady state

observer on a worldline r = constant in this metric
perceives an eternally expanding ‘universe’ with an
event horizon, but the ‘universe’ (i.e. the timelike
foliated coordinate patch shown in Fig. 1) is past
incomplete.
Here we discuss how to characterize the geodesic
completeness of a generalization of FRW spacetimes,
and show that the aforementioned heuristic example
holds in a more general sense. Our result is purely
geometric, holding for any metrical theory of gravity.
II.
INFLATION AND GEODESIC
COMPLETENESS
Among the most compelling models of the early
universe is the inﬂationary universe paradigm [4].
Shortly after its conception the question naturally
emerged: could inﬂation be eternal, in particular,
eternal into the past? If so, the universe itself could
be eternal without the need for a deﬁnite beginning
[5–10]. A critical component needed to answer this
question is a thorough understanding of singularities
in general spacetimes, see e.g. [11–13], namely, space-
times without any further assumptions on structure.
If a spacetime contains a singularity (curvature
singularity or otherwise) it cannot inﬂate eternally.
One should ascertain whether a spacetime admits
even a single incomplete geodesic, namely a geodesic
which does not exist for all values of aﬃne parameter.
If such an incomplete geodesic exists, the spacetime
is singular; an observer on such a timelike geodesic
trajectory experiences a catastrophic halt to their
proper time, as their worldline cannot be extended
past a particular spacetime event. In the case of a
curvature singularity an observer’s clock stops be-
cause a spatial defect is encountered.
Venturing forward with pedantic mathematical
concern, one must restrict to the class of maximal
geodesics–curves which cannot be further extended.
A maximal geodesic line γ is deﬁned as
γ : (a, b) →M
(2)
where a, b is are real numbers in open interval (a, b)
and M is the spacetime in question. Additionally,
one can deﬁne a maximal geodesic ray emanating
from a point p = γ (a) by
γ : [a, b) →M
(3)
The singularity structure of a spacetime may be elu-
cidated by studying the world lines of observers on
maximal geodesic trajectories. If γ is complete the
domain is deﬁned on all R.
Now consider a smooth past directed causal
geodesic segment γ ([a, b]) as the image of a geodesic
γ deﬁned over the compact set [a, b]. Smooth (hence
continuous) maps preserve compact sets and there-
fore γ ([a, b]) is compact.
Could γ ([a, b]) be com-
plete? The answer is no. Either:
1. A singularity is encountered in the image of
γ and the preimage of such must be excluded
from the domain (hence [a, b] cannot be all R)
2. γ (a) and / or γ (b) ∈∂M, the boundary of the
spacetime, and is trivially incomplete
3. γ (a) and / or γ (b) ∈int M, the interior of the
spacetime, and is extendable
In the ﬁrst two cases the spacetime is incomplete be-
cause any past directed causal geodesic arising from
the interior which intersects the spacelike boundary
abruptly stops, else it would have to change causal
character to propagate along the spacelike bound-
ary which cannot occur for a geodesic. In the third
case, any geodesic segment which realizes an end-
point on the interior can be extended by considering
a semi-Riemannian normal neighborhood centered
at γ (b) and calculate expγ(b)
˙
γ (b), where expp X is
the exponential map centered at p ∈M – calcu-
lated by ﬁnding the geodesic at p with initial veloc-
ity X and evaluating the point at unit time. Such
an extension must always occur, even if the diameter
of such a semi-Riemannian normal neighborhood is
very small. Any extendable geodesic segment can-
not be complete because it does not contain all the
possible information contained in the maximal curve,
namely the information contained in the extensions.
In a general model with very little structure, it
can be diﬃcult to classify all geodesics in a space-
time. Even if structure is introduced allowing such
a classiﬁcation of geodesics, the geodesic equation
may not have an analytic solution: thus advanced
methods vis à vis hyperbolic diﬀerential equations
and functional analysis are required.
However, a
suﬃcient condition for an incomplete geodesic can
be found utilizing Jacobi ﬁelds to ﬁnd conjugate or
focal points, which is often easier to calculate than
solving all possible geodesic equations: this is the
basis for the singularity theorems of [11].
Demonstrating that a spacetime is free of incom-
plete geodesics does not mean that the spacetime
is physically reasonable. While free of singularities,
such models may violate reasonable energy condi-
tions with ‘exotic’ sources required to ensure that
all geodesics are complete. Nonetheless, spacetimes
which are geodesically complete are void of singular-
ities at the geometric level and one may hope that
a reasonable metric theory of gravity exists, capable
of supporting these spacetimes.
Returning to the discussion of eternal inﬂation,
the title of [9] claims that any inﬂationary spacetime

3
must be geodesically incomplete.
Below, we pro-
vide an uncountably inﬁnite cardnality of monsters
– see [14] – applications of a theory to prickly ex-
amples at the boundary of the domain of discourse
which helps to clarify tenets of the theory, showing
that this cannot be the case. These simple monsters
are well deﬁned within the realm of GR, although in
that context, they violate energy conditions for an
arbitrarily short time. We begin with a brief discus-
sion of [9] elucidating some of the contentious points
therein. We then introduce the class of Generalized
Friedmann Robertson Walker spacetimes (GFRW),
and discuss their geodesic completeness.
Next we
discuss properties of scale functions yielding inﬂa-
tionary monsters which satisfy the Havg > 0 condi-
tion of [9] yet are geodesically complete. Finally, we
speculate on how quantum gravity may ultimately
constrain the domain of discourse with respect to
physically reasonable scale functions.
III.
WHAT IS INFLATION?
Much of the contention surrounding Havg in [9]
stems from ambiguous underlying assumptions. We
remedy this by attempting to explicitly state the un-
derlying assumptions.
Fittingly, we begin by dis-
cussing what is meant by the term inﬂationary.
In the introduction of [17], inﬂationary theory pi-
oneer Alan Guth aptly states, “the term inﬂation
encompasses a wide range of detailed theories”, and
refrains from deﬁning inﬂation in a mathematically
precise manner. Popular deﬁnitions of inﬂation in-
clude “a quasi-de Sitter period”, “a period when grav-
ity acted as a repulsive force” or “a period during
which the Hubble sphere is shrinking”. Several au-
thors prefer to discuss inﬂation in terms of what it
does, avoiding the need for a precise or rigorous def-
inition. In [18], the authors deﬁne inﬂation as “any
epoch during which the scale factor of the Universe
is accelerating”, and provide the deﬁning equation
Deﬁnition 1. INFLATION ⇐⇒¨f > 0 ,
where we take f to be the scale factor and “·” denotes
diﬀerentiation with respect to cosmic time t. This
deﬁnition assumes that the metric can be expressed
as a warped product from [19] as
g = dπ∗
1g1 + f 2 dπ∗
2g2
(4)
where topologically the manifold in question is a
Cartesian product M1×M2 of two semi-Riemannian
manifolds (M1, g1) and (M2, g2) and dπ∗
1, dπ∗
2 are
the metric pullbacks of the canonical projections
π1 : M →M1, π2 : M →M2 in the Cartesian
product construction.
Additionally, f is a strictly
positive smooth function “warping” the contribution
of the second metric g2 to the overall metric g.
Relating this to the standard Friedmann Robert-
son Walker (FRW) model of cosmology and cos-
mogony, one has already foliated out a privileged
time dimension by assumption and by deﬁning a
scale function f with respect to this time dimension.
The spacetime metric is that of Eq. 1.
In fact, the results apropos scale functions dis-
cussed in this paper are applicable to the broader
class of Generalized Friedmann Robertson Walker
(GFRW) spacetimes. These GFRW spacetimes are
deﬁned as the warped product
R1
1 ×f Σ
(5)
where (Σ, gΣ) is a complete1 Riemannian manifold –
taken to be the spacelike leaf – and R1
1 is the timelike
foliation. Note that the subscript is used to denote
a negative deﬁnite index of the metric in R1
1 as in
[12, 13]. Finally a positive deﬁnite smooth warping
function f is used in the ×f notation for speciﬁcation
of the warped product metric g = −dt2 +f 2 gΣ. Ad-
ditionally, the dπ∗
t , dπ∗
Σ are unambiguous and have
been suppressed.
One of the goals of [9] is to generalize concepts
from a highly structured FRW spacetime, so one may
ask if a spacetime which cannot admit a global fo-
liation of a time direction should be considered in-
ﬂationary or not. In fact, if a dimension 3 or higher
open neighborhood U ⊂M admits a curl-free, lo-
cal Killing vector ﬁeld it is isometric to a warped
product spacetime – see [13] Lemma 3.78. Are such
spacetimes to be considered inﬂationary? In partic-
ular, it is much easier for local Killing vector ﬁelds
to exist than global ones, so many spacetimes which
cannot globally foliate out a time direction fall into
this category.
An additional concern with respect to Defn. 1 are
bouncing cosmologies. Clearly, we must have ¨f > 0
for a time during the transition from contraction to
expansion; however, the contracting phase strictly
violates the deﬁnition of [18]. Although strict deﬁni-
tions of a spacetime varies subtly between authors,
the canonical literature typically demands that the
Lorentzian manifold be time oriented, thus it makes
sense to talk about ¨f being explicitly positive or neg-
ative. Because there can only be a single choice of
time orientation, once this time orientation is ﬁxed
1Any diﬀerentiable manifold admits a Riemannian met-
ric - which can be pulled up from the underlying Euclidean
space via the atlas, and any Riemannian metric is conformal
to a complete metric [50]. Thus, given any (Hausdorﬀ, sec-
ond countable) reasonable space Σ, it can be endowed with a
complete Riemannian metric.

4
what constitutes inﬂation or deﬂation is ﬁxed. Given
the above, we feel that it is myopic to exclude the
possible bouncing phenomenology from inﬂationary
models and a rigorous deﬁnition for inﬂation should
encompass bouncing cosmologies (in the cosmolog-
ical bounce the co-moving hubble radius decreases,
as it does during inﬂation and there is at least a
short period during which ¨f > 0 during the bounc-
ing phase.).
Given these considerations, we feel that the inﬂa-
tion deﬁnition of Defn. 1 is overly restrictive. We
propose a new deﬁnition for an inﬂationary space-
time:
Deﬁnition 2. Let (M, g) be an n dimensional
spacetime which admits a connected open neighbor-
hood U ⊂M which is isometric to (a, b) ×f V as a
warped product open submanifold, where (a, b) is a
timelike codimension n −1 embedded submanifold,
V is a spacelike codimension 1 embedded submani-
fold and no assumptions are made concerning f ex-
cept that it is a well deﬁned function between sets.
The spacetime (M, g) is an inﬂationary spacetime
if there exists some t0 ∈(a, b) such that (assuming
that it exists and is well deﬁned), ¨f (t0) > 0 where
derivatives of f are taken with respect to the time-
like (a, b) coordinate and the sign of ¨f is given with
respect to the time orientation of M.
In this deﬁnition, no assumptions about the con-
tinuity of f or its derivatives are made.
There is
debate in the literature about what precise assump-
tions functions in metrical theories of gravity must
have for well deﬁned curvatures to exist – see [11]
Chapter 3.1 for example – we do not comment on
this issue here. Additionally, we do not assume that
f > 0, as in [12, 13, 19], so as not to exclude the
possibility of an initial singularity caused by f →0.
There are several technicalities apropos Defn. 2.
The ﬁrst is a local global relationship of the local
inﬂationary neighborhood (a, b) ×f V to the global
spacetime (M, g).
As written in Defn.
2, the in-
ﬂationary canonical time axis must be timelike with
respect to the global metric and V must be spacelike
with respect to this metric as well.
This assumes
the existence and causal knowledge of (M, g) non-
locally. If one holds the view that inﬂation is purely
a local phenomenon, Defn. 2 is overly restrictive, ex-
cluding the possibility of two distant observers un-
dergoing inﬂation orthogonal to each other, each be-
lieving the other’s time axes to be spacelike - see
Fig. 1. In fact, upon accepting these arguments one
could even theorize that having a well deﬁned met-
ric is a local property! If one demands causality –
even exotic causality such as in closed timelike curves
or vicious spacetimes2 – this possibility must be ex-
cluded as it is in the deﬁnition.
However, by ex-
amining various inﬂationary neighborhoods within
a single spacetime under Defn. 2, it gives valuable
information as to the causal structure, and subse-
quently the overall metric of the global spacetime,
especially as one extrapolates upon a distant inﬂa-
tionary neighborhood which may exceed one’s ob-
servable universe.

An example spacetime which does not con-
form to Defn. 2. The external rectangle is schematic for
overall spacetime (M, g) which contains two potential
inﬂationary neighborhoods U, V . Neighborhood V has a
canonical time axis which is timelike with respect to over-
all metric g and is indeed inﬂationary with respect to the
above deﬁnition. However, neighborhood U has a canon-
ical “time” axis which, in its native immersed Lorentzian
(causal) structure is taken to be timelike; however, it is
spacelike with respect to overall metric g. Such a situa-
tion is excluded by Defn. 2. Light cones are shown with
respect to overall metric g.
We now discuss various subtleties concerning the
immersion versus the embedding of the inﬂationary
neighborhood. Should a spacetime like that of Fig. 2
be licit under the deﬁnition of inﬂation?
As was
mentioned in the previous paragraph, the reader’s
opinion of local versus global concerns drives possi-
ble deﬁnitions of inﬂation. If one believes inﬂation
to be observer dependent, an immersed submanifold
deﬁnition is superior and the spacetime of Fig. 2 is
allowed because what occurs outside of the observer’s
observable universe is absurd. This has the drawback
that every observer could potentially have a diﬀer-
ent immersed topology. However, if one believes that
the “top down” structure of the entire spacetime is
paramount, the embedded submanifold deﬁnition –
2A spacetime is vicious at a point if the causal future /
past encompasses the entire spacetime, namely J ± (p) = M.
A spacetime is totally vicious if it is vicious everywhere – see
[13, 51]

5
this is what is assumed in Defn. 2 – and all possible
observers must be compatible with the entire space-
time’s topology, and Fig. 2 is excluded.

An example spacetime (M, g) conformal to
R1
1 × S1 × S2. The vertical perimeter is glued aligning
the arrows as is done in a standard quotient topology di-
agram. The cylinder admits a single inﬂationary neigh-
borhood U with canonical time axis wrapped around the
cylinder. In the topology of the overall space one consid-
ers a neighborhood V - circle neighborhood in the center,
but the intersection with the inﬂationary subspace topol-
ogy yields a disconnected subset - one connected compo-
nent shaded dark. In the (embedded) overall topology all
points in V are “close”, however in the (immersed) sub-
space topology the connected components are “far away”.
Defn. 2 excludes this possibility.
What about the maximality of inﬂationary neigh-
borhoods? As discussed in the introduction, it might
be possible to ﬁnd an extension of an inﬂationary
neighborhood enlarging it.
Thus, the length of a
geodesic to the boundary of an inﬂationary neigh-
borhood can vary depending upon the arbitrary se-
lection of neighborhood boundary. However, if one
chooses to use the maximal inﬂationary neighbor-
hood and a geodesic intersects the boundary in ﬁnite
length then the space is incomplete. Defn. 2 does
not comment on this phenomena, and it is possi-
ble one could be interested in inﬂationary phenom-
ena in a particular coordinate system without want-
ing maximality. However, if one desires to compute
geodesic completeness in an inﬂationary neighbor-
hood, it must be maximal.
Does an inﬂationary neighborhood need to be con-
nected? The explicit use of the term “connected” in
Defn. 2 is equivalent to the connectedness of the spa-
tial section V in the Cartesian product construction
of (a, b)×f V . In order for the deﬁnition to correlate
with observation it is necessary that the inﬂationary
neighborhood be connected: how would one observe
a distinct3 distant connected component? However,
in some theories - in particular those which admit
pocket universes - it is possible that inﬂation is oc-
curring in multiple distinct distant places at once,
and as long as the geometry of the inﬂating regions is
uniformly scaled by the same f the inﬂationary patch
could be disconnected (topologically (a, b)×f
`
i∈I Vi
for some index set I). One could consider the union
of all inﬂating regions - even those with diﬀering scale
functions - as a union: this could be useful in calcu-
lations of inﬂating region volumes [8–10]. All of the
aforementioned concerns are built on the ediﬁce of
Defn. 2; the deﬁnition itself, however, only deﬁnes
the geometry of a single connected inﬂating region
akin to our observable universe.
Finally one can consider the dimension of the
spacelike foliation V . In standard metric theories of
gravity, this must be a codimension 1 submanifold,
akin to a hypersurface. If, however, one would like
to accommodate a theory with extra dimensions, it
is conceivable that other codimensions might be con-
sidered, perhaps for various D-branes populating the
bulk. This is not accommodated by Defn. 2 in order
to agree with FRW historical convention. It would
not be diﬃcult to alter the deﬁnition to include this
phenomenology.
Defn. 2 broadly expands the phenomenology which
is considered inﬂationary. In the absence of a unique
model of the nascent universe supported by experi-
mental evidence, we choose to be overly accommo-
dating with respect to the inﬂationary paradigm,
which is consistent with known observations.
Ad-
ditionally, there is precedent with deﬁning a catego-
rization of a spacetime with respect to a quantity at
a single point – consider the general condition of [11].
One my also discuss how much inﬂation a spacetime
is experiencing by using statements like it is “com-
pletely inﬂationary” where it inﬂates for all time, or
only inﬂates on (a, b), to accommodate realistic mod-
els and also bouncing models.
We adopt Defn. 2 as a working deﬁnition for in-
ﬂation, attempting to address some of the topologi-
cal machinery enthymeme in Defn. 1. Naturally, de-
pending on one’s bias apropos phenomenology, there
are other potential deﬁnitions for inﬂation which
might be superior.
For example, the topological
criteria for an inﬂationary neighborhood to exist –
namely the existence of a curl free local Killing vec-
3The use of the term “distinct” implies each spatial folia-
tion is disjoint from every other one.

tor ﬁeld – might uniquely specify a deﬁnition upon
further investigation and proof. We leave such ex-
ploration for future work.
IV.
DISCUSSION OF Havg
We now compare our proposed deﬁnition for an
inﬂationary spacetime, Defn. 2 with a discussion of
Havg in [9]. There, the authors propose a gedanken
experiment of measuring the tidal forces in a general
spacetime (M, g) along a geodesic γ with velocity
V µ = dγ
dλ by subsequent measurements of a massive
test particle moving along some timelike geodesic
α : J →M with velocity U µ =
dα
dλ in a locally
Minkowski neighborhood. The quantity
Hγ = −
Vµ (λ)
β2 (λ) + κ
DU µ (λ)
Dλ
(6)
along geodesic γ, where a spatially dependent gen-
eralized Lorentz factor is given by β2 (λ) = VµU µ,
and κ = VµV µ is taken to be κ = −1 for γ be-
ing a timelike geodesic, and κ = 0 for γ being a
null geodesic.4 Additionally, we denote the parallel
transport of U µ along γ as DU µ
Dλ . The above may be
written succinctly in geometers notation as
Hγ = −g (V, ∇V U)
g (U, V ) + κ
(7)
where g is the metric and ∇is the Levi-Civita con-
nection.
Note that Eq. 6 reduces to the usual deﬁnition of
the Hubble parameter
H (t) =
˙f (t)
f (t)
(8)
in the special case that the spacetime is inﬂationary,
and in the inﬂationary neighborhood, V µ is purely
spacelike and U µ is purely timelike5. In fact, in a
gedanken experiment where timelike observer V =
a ∂
∂t +A measures a timelike test particle U = b ∂
∂t +B
with both A, B purely spacelike, we ﬁnd
Hγ = −

(9)
where dπΣ∇AB is the projection of the Σ-tangential
components of ∇AB onto spacelike slice Σ and
∥A∥2
g = g (A, A). By utilizing the fact that in warped
product constructions ξ2
A ≡f 2∥A∥2
g is a constant –
which corresponds to the initial speed of a test par-
ticle with respect to cosmic time, not a Nöether con-
served quantity – Eq. 9 can be expressed as

quantity
Hγ = g


g (X, Y )
(13)
where X, Y are purely spacelike (horizontal) vector
ﬁelds and II (X, Y ) = nor∇XY is the second fun-
damental form yielding extrinsic curvature, where
nor∇XY is the projection of ∇XY onto the linear
subspace normal to the hypersurface in question. In
a GFRW
II (X, Y ) = −
˙f
f g (X, Y ) ∂

(14)
thus, for any X, Y as stated above, one reaps Hγ =
˙f
f . There are of course drawbacks to this deﬁnition:
ambiguity of precisely knowing
∂
∂t or that II is an
abstract geometric quantity and X, Y are spacelike;
neither of which can be directly measured.
We now state what we consider to be the main
result of [9]:
Theorem 1. Inflationary spacetimes are past
incomplete - Let (M, g) be a spacetime, and γ :
[λi, λf] →M be some causal geodesic. If one com-
putes the quantity
Hγ
avg =
1
λf −λi
Z λf
λi
Hγ (α) dα
(15)
to be strictly positive along the image of γ, the space-
time is geodesically incomplete.
We study the implications of this theorem and its
results. First we will examine topological subtleties
calculating6 Havg and introduce two other methods
to calculate this quantity including the asymptotic
past and / or futures. Next we will enumerate an
uncountably inﬁnite cardinality of classical monsters
with respect to Thm. 1 which are geodesically com-
plete despite having various values of Havg depend-
ing on the underlying topological assumptions. Some
of the calculated Havg > 0 are strictly positive which
violates Thm 1.
Here we consider only metrical theories of gravity;
and while cursory computations of the Einstein Field
Equations (EFE) will be discussed within the con-
text of energy conditions, all proofs that follow re-
quire only assumptions at the geometric level. Given
6In Thm 1 the deﬁnition of Hγ
avg includes the superscript
‘γ’ to reinforce the idea that Havg is potentially geodesic de-
pendent. In the case where choice of geodesic is unambiguous
the superscript will be supressed.
this, however, our aforementioned GFRW spacetime
monsters do exist within the scope of general rel-
ativity, with only an arbitrarily small necessity for
energy-condition-violating exotic matter.
On the
other side, these completeness results hold for any
metrical theory of gravity which may ultimately pre-
empt general relativity.
Any further speculations
on relationships between geometrical quantities and
mass-energy is beyond the scope of this paper.
Our ﬁrst criticism of Eq. 15, involves the implicit
assumption that the integral is computed over a com-
pact interval.
Careful study of [9] Eqs.
5, 10, 11
reaps that the computed integrals are evaluated on
the boundary per Stokes’ Theorem7 and thus the un-
derlying topology of the Havg calculation is a com-
pact set, seeing as no mention is made of any limiting
procedure not including the boundary. In this way,
the integral is predestined to converge, assuming the
minimum condition that Hγ (λ) is never inﬁnite on a
set of non-zero (Borel) measure. Canonically, prop-
erties of geodesic completeness are formulated with
respect to maximal geodesic rays of domain [0, b).
A strict reading of Thm.
1 then begs the ques-
tion of what underlying interval to select, and the
value of Havg varies depending on the interval. No
matter which compact interval is chosen, any com-
pact geodesic segment is necessarily incomplete by
the discussion from Sec.
II. By deﬁning geodesics
in this manner over compact intervals it is diﬃcult
to compare Thm. 1 to the standard mathematical
literature, and even worse is equivalent to incom-
pleteness. A strict application of Thm. 1, exactly
as written, never allows for the possibility that an
inﬂationary spacetime could be complete.
Addressing
these
criticisms
we
propose
two
amended deﬁnitions of Havg
H−,γ
avg =
lim
a→−∞

b −a
Z b

Hγ (α) dα
(16)
and
H±,γ

Z b

Hγ (α) dα
(17)
The ﬁrst, H−
avg, includes the asymptotic past and
the latter H±
avg includes the entire worldline includ-
ing both the asymptotic past and future. With re-
spect to the maximality requirements of geodesic
completeness, the proposed deﬁnitions of Eqs. 16,
17 remove the topological ambiguity of interval se-
lection inherent in Thm.

Geodesic ray candi-
dates for past complete geodesics correspond to H−
avg

not the speciﬁc application seen in surface geometry.

8
and the maximal curves as candidates for a complete
geodesic line correspond to H±
avg .
In particular, if one deﬁnes Hγ by Eq. 15, the
suppression by a ﬁnite
1
λf −λi makes it diﬃcult for
Havg →0 in the limit, yielding false positives for
geodesic incompleteness: this is equivalent to an a
priori assumption of incompleteness.
Considering
this, it is not surprising the aforementioned use of
Havg claims to ﬁnd all inﬂationary spacetimes to be
incomplete. However, if H−
avg is utilized the ﬁnite
contribution from the start of the geodesic ray, γ (b),
is quenched in the limit a →−∞and if Eq. 16 is
substituted for Eq. 15 in Thm. 1, one ﬁnds H−
avg = 0
in many cases – with the notable example of a coﬁ-
nite tail of f = exp Ht which is already well-known
to be incomplete (see Example 7.41 in [12]) – and
Thm. 1 almost never applies. This occurs for ex-
amples such as the monster of Figs. 3, 4 which are
non-decreasing and inﬂationary, and yet H−
avg = 0.
Interestingly, if one includes the asymptotic future
and calculates H±
avg, the coﬁnite deSitter phase re-
stores the support needed for H±
avg > 0 and such an
inﬂationary spacetime has a positive averaged Hub-
ble parameter as expected, however this calculation
is highly sensitive to the order the limits are taken
in.
Another interesting subtext of Thm. 1 is the de-
pendence of Hγ
avg on a particular choice of geodesic
γ. In particular, the geodesic which one selects might
not happen to yield a Hγ
avg > 0: in order to properly
classify geodesic completeness of M one must ex-
amine supγ∈MGeo(M) Hγ
avg, where MGeo (M) is the
space of maximal geodesics over M. Utilizing meth-
ods of analysis and the fact that the space of com-
plete maximal geodesics is closed in the C0 Whitney
topology – see Theorem 4.7 in [21] – one should be
able to calculate the range of Hγ
avg when viewed as
a functional on the space of geodesics over a (ﬁxed)
spacetime, which we leave to future work. Finally,
the fact that both the observer and test particle are
assumed to follow geodesics has not been used in the
derivation of Hγ.
It is obvious that the Havg of Eqs.
15, 16, 17
is not linear.
Having some generalization of lin-
earity for Havg would be ideal.
A geodesic seg-
ment γ : [λ0, λℓ] →M could be decomposed into
[λ0, λℓ] = Sℓ−1
k=0 [λk, λk+1] with γk = γ ([λk, λk+1]).

to the monsters discussed in the next section.
V.
MONSTERS
We now present an uncountably inﬁnite class of
classical monsters which have Havg ≥0 but are
geodesically complete. We would like to remind the
reader that this a purely geometric result: it applies
to any metrical theory of gravity. For any GFRW
R1
1 ×f Σ with a smooth scale function f – thus guar-
anteeing there will not be any curvature singularities
– the geodesic completeness of GFRWs is enumerated
by the following [20, 21]:
Theorem 2. Geodesic Completeness Criterion for
GFRW Spacetimes - Let M = R1
1 ×f Σ be a GFRW
spacetime
1. The spacetime M is future timelike complete
iﬀ
R ∞

f(t)dt
√
(f(t))2+1 diverges for all t0 ∈R.
2. The spacetime M is future null complete iﬀ
R ∞
t0 f (t) dt diverges for all t0 ∈R.
3. The spacetime M is future spacelike complete
iﬀM is future null complete or if
R ∞
t0 f (t) dt <
∞then f is unbounded; for all t0 ∈R.
4. The GFRW is past timelike / null / spacelike
complete if, for items 1-3 above, upon reversing
the limits of integration from
R ∞
t0
to
R t0
−∞the
word “future” is replaced by “past”.
5. The spacetime M is geodesically complete iﬀ
it is both future and past timelike, null, and
spacelike geodesically complete.
Thus, one can deﬁnitively calculate the geodesic
completeness of a given GFRW with Thm. 2 and
compare the predictions to Thm. 1. In particular, if
the condition that
inf
R f = a > 0
(19)
holds then the GFRW spacetime is geodesically com-
plete. One can imagine a class of GFRW spacetimes
with a smooth scale function obeying infR f = a > 0,
limt→−∞f = c with c ≥a > 0, however for t > t0
with respect to some given t0 ∈R behaves as de Sit-
ter space with f = eHt. Such scale functions can be
constructed with smooth partitions of unity.
As discussed in Sec. IV, the generalization of the
Hubble parameter to Eqs. 6, 7 yields Eq. 10 which
diﬀers from the expected
˙f
f . However, in a GFRW
one can always choose a spacelike geodesic measuring
a timelike test particle for which Hγ does in fact

9
reduce to the expected value. For the remainder of
this section, unless otherwise noted, we will make
such a choice that Hγ =
˙f
f .
Now one must examine the question of Havg with
respect to these monsters. If one calculates Havg di-
rectly from Thm. 1 one must determine an interval
to calculate over. Ignoring the fact that any compact
interval cannot parameterize a maximal, hence com-
plete, geodesic one may still calculate Havg over the
selected interval; however, the value of Havg varies
depending on the interval selected:
if an interval
that only contains the de Sitter phase is selected one
yields H, but as f →c the value of Havg is quenched
by the support of the coﬁnite past towards but never
attaining zero. Depending on the behavior of f in
the ﬁnite past as well as the interval selected, Havg
may obtain any real value. However, as more of the
coﬁnite de Sitter phase is included in an interval,
any bounces are oﬀset by the increasing exponential
function, and Thm. 1 applies.
The calculation of H−
avg = 0 proceeds as in the
previous paragraph, except the asymptote of zero
is actually realized. This is particularly concerning:
one such monster in this cohort is that of Fig. 3. In
fact, the monster exp Ht + c with c > 0 (see Fig. 4)
inﬂates eternally but has H−
avg = 0. If H−
avg is calcu-
lated in this fashion, Thm. 1 does not apply to any
monsters in this cohort.
If one selects a past directed geodesic ray with
starting point extremely far but still ﬁnite in the fu-
ture – say Σ (216) where Σ (n) is the busy beaver
function of [52] – the observable universe of such an
observer8 is only privy to the de Sitter phase and
would measure Havg = H, however the truth is that
there was a coﬁnite loiter into the asymptotic past
and the “correct” measurement of H−
avg = 0. Such a
universe inﬂates into the coﬁnite asymptotic future
in a de Sitter phase and yet has H−
avg = 0: a para-
doxical result. A criticism of this argument is that
a universe in the epoch of Σ (216) could be a very
strange place, perhaps one that does not support
life if an anthropomorphic principle is invoked. It
might be possible that a clever experiment utilizing
novel physics might be able to detect the loitering
phase at a starting point of only a few Hubble times,
or perhaps not.
Pragmatically one must consider
empirical and epistemological considerations of var-
ious observers piercing various horizons to be able
to measure the scale function f and calculate Havg.
8Observable universe radius is taken to be the speed of
light divided by the Hubble constant. This also assumes that
H of the model is commensurate to the H of the physical
universe such that Σ (216) · H ≫1, thus an unfathomable
number of e-folds have occurred
We have tacitly assumed that global knowledge of f
can always be measured and communicated but this
may not be true considering the existence of horizons
such as the observable universe in a de Sitter phase.
The Σ (216) model above features an extreme praxis
which calls such an assumption of global knowledge
of f – and thus the applicability of Havg – into ques-
tion. Any further discussion on this matter is beyond
the scope of this paper.
Finally, the calculation of H±
avg is even more con-
cerning. The outcome is predicated upon what order
the limits of Eq. 17 are taken. If one executes the b
limit ﬁrst
lim
a→−∞lim
b→∞
1
b −a
Z b
a
Hγ (α) dα = H
and if the a limit is executed ﬁrst
lim
b→∞lim
a→−∞
1
b −a
Z b
a
Hγ (α) dα = H−
avg = 0
Additionally for any q ∈R+
∗, the strictly positive real
numbers, one can parameterize the H±
avg calculation
as
lim
b→∞
1
b · (q + 1)
Z qb
−b
Hγ (α) dα ∈(0, H)
which varies by choice of q. This is particularly con-
cerning, because if H±
avg ∈[0, H] Thm. 1 both ap-
plies and does not simultaneously to the monsters in
this cohort.
All that matters to construct this class of counter
examples is that the tail of f behaves as de Sitter,
and it can be smoothly combined with any other
function of positive inﬁmum on the interval (−∞, t0)
with a smooth partition of unity over a compact in-
terval, and approaches a strictly positive constant
in the distant past. The size of the function space
over this interval enumerates a cohort of classical
monsters, see Fig. 3. Additionally, because the di-
mensionality of C∞((−∞, t0)), the space of smooth
functions on the interval (−∞, t0), is uncountably
inﬁnite, there are an uncountably inﬁnite number
of GFRW spacetimes which have Havg ≥0 but are
geodesically complete.
One can apply the theory developed here to the
loitering monster of Fig.
3.
The application of
Thm.
2 guarantees that this monster is geodesi-
cally complete for all geodesically complete space-
like foliations (Σ, gΣ). Application of Eqs. 15, 16, 17
yield Havg ∈(0, H] depending on choice of incom-
plete causal geodesic segment, H−
avg = 0 for all past
directed maximal geodesic rays, and H±
avg ∈[0, H]
depending on parameterization and order the limits
are taken over any maximal (both past and future)
geodesic line chosen.
In particular, Thm.

or may not apply, depending on the Havg variant
chosen. At this point we remind the reader that a
strict reading of Thm. 1 cannot produce complete
geodesic segments because all computations are per-
formed over compact intervals.
However, with re-
spect to H±
avg Thm. 1 both simultaneously does and
does not apply depending on how the limit is taken
(see Table I).
We now revisit Eq. 18. A natural decomposition
of a maximal geodesic line into geodesic segments
yields γ = γ(−∞,−1] ∪γ[−1,0] ∪γ[0,t0] ∪γ[t0,∞) where
γ(−∞,−1] is the loitering asymptotic past, γ[−1,0] is
the smooth transition region, γ[0,t0] is the ﬁnite past
de Sitter phase, and γ[t0,∞) is the de Sitter asymp-
totic future. Ideally one would like the Havg sum
of Eq. 18 to be equality. However, from a math-
ematically pragmatic standpoint, what matters for
the computation of Havg is the natural logarithm
of the scale function at the boundary endpoints as
is shown in [9] Eq. 10, not what occurs in the in-
terior. This is one of the reasons Thm. 1 fails to
predict geodesic completeness but Thm. 2 - which is
derived by manually solving the geodesic equation -
does.
The question now emerges, are such classical mon-
sters physically reasonable?

the above cohort of monsters due to the additive
constant in the asymptotic future, the authors argue
that such a scale function possesses non-zero quan-
tum mechanical tunneling probability when treated
with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, thus eliminat-
ing the viability of an eternally loitering phase prior
to inﬂation and expansion. In particular, they ar-
gue that the class of aforementioned classical mon-
sters (belonging to the “emergent universe” scenario
[30–34]) should be excluded from the domain of dis-
course of physically reasonable scale factors (see also
[35]). In fact, the implications of cosmologies which
inﬁnitely loiter in a steady state generates the prime
antinomy of temporal Copernicanism: why do we ex-
ist NOW even though it is inﬁnitely likely we should
exist at some other time? For the current discussion,
however, we have little to contribute.
We do feel it is important to point out that calcu-
lational use of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, pred-
icated on the Arnowitt Deser and Misner (ADM)
formalism – see [25] and [26] – has somewhat of a
contentious past, see e. g.
[23, 24].
In particu-
lar, resolving the factor ordering problem eliminates
the consistent canonical quantization of most gen-
eral Hamiltonians in curved spacetimes [28], a de-
tail which has simply been assumed to have been
resolved in [25]. With respect to the current prob-
lem at hand, one criticism of the calculation of [22] is
the semi-classical treatment and subsequent elimina-
tion of time-ordering terms from the potential; a well
known point of controversy apropos the Wheeler-
DeWitt equation. For future work, it would be in-
teresting to repeat the calculation including these
terms, possibly utilizing methods contained in [27].
Many semi-classical physical quandaries are resolved
when treated in a complete quantum formalism.
Besides the above concern, it is not possible to
have such a loitering universe exit the loitering
phase or a bounce into an expanding phase in GR
while obeying the weak energy condition (WEC):
Tµνtµtν ≥0, for timelike vectors tσ. As shown in
Fig. 3 the WEC is violated very brieﬂy in the tran-
sition between the two phases during t ∈[−1, 0].
Indeed, even the null energy condition (NEC) is vi-
olated in this region. However, this transition zone
can be made arbitrarily small, perhaps even smaller
than a Planck time, so the need for any such exotic
matter such as galileons [36] which can stably sup-
port such a NEC violation [37], or any other new
physics such as strings to accommodate a loitering
phase [38, 39], is ﬂeeting. Of course, even the stan-
dard inﬂationary scenario necessarily violates the
strong energy condition (SEC); indeed, our current
period of accelerated expansion indicates the SEC is
being violated even today, and it is well known that
all of the energy conditions can be violated at the
quantum level.
Because of their ability to violate the NEC,
galileon ﬁelds have been used to construct monsters
of the type discussed above, including loitering, in-
ﬂationary and bouncing cosmologies [37, 40–44] and
other exotic cosmological solutions [45–47]. Stabil-
ity arguments in such theories are complicated and
depend on external background matter [48]. Even
properly deﬁning energy conditions in non-canonical
scalar-tensor theories is non-trivial [49]. The devil is
in the details, and it is unclear how similar quantum
stability arguments of [22] apply to these models.
VI.
CONCLUSION
For a mathematical model to aspire to be a plausi-
ble description of the actual universe (or multiverse),
additional criteria are often brought to bear. Such
criteria may depend on the theoretical framework
adopted in the treatment. Within classical theories
of gravity, a frequently invoked question is whether a
proposed solution is ‘generic’. More precisely, if the
solution involves either a parameter value or initial
conditions that must be chosen from a set of measure
zero, the model is often dismissed as unphysical. A
simple example is in Newtonian cosmology, where an
initial density singularity will exist if the distribution
of matter is exactly spherically symmetric. However,
if the coeﬃcients of the higher multipoles are not all
strictly 0, inﬁnite densities may not occur. In general
relativity, however, departures from sphericity may
not serve to remove the singularity if certain energy
conditions apply, but it may be that most matter will
‘miss’ the singularity and the corresponding world
lines will be geodesically complete in the past. In
this paper, we have presented a set of geodesically
complete solutions of inﬂationary metric theories of
gravity that belong to an uncountable continuum,
which is therefore a set of non-zero measure in the
space of (continuous) initial conditions.
As such,

12
these ‘monsters’ are generic and thus are stable to
perturbations in initial conditions, which are impos-
sible to know precisely. We note that the measure
of the set of initial conditions being described here
is predicated on the assumption of the continuity of
spacetime, which may be transcended in the context
of quantum cosmology.
Another criterion that might be used as a ﬁlter
for physically plausible theories is the second law of
thermodynamics, generalized to include cosmologi-
cal event horizons. Such horizons are a feature of
inﬂationary cosmological models. In the case of de
Sitter space, the event horizon area is constant, but
in FRW models where f is concave upward as t tends
to inﬁnity, the event horizon area will shrink and will
generally imply a violation of the generalized second
law of thermodynamics. Such models might then be
regarded as unphysical. There may, of course be ad-
ditional criteria beyond a solution being generic and
not violating the generalized second law. The point
we wish to make is that the plausibility or otherwise
of a mathematical model to describe the real uni-
verse goes beyond it merely being a correct solution
to a set of accepted dynamical equations.
In this paper, we oﬀered a critical discussion of
the Havg > 0 geodesic completeness criterion for in-
ﬂationary spacetimes with respect to the arguments
presented in [9].
Our ﬁrst area of discussion in-
volved the deﬁnition of inﬂationary spacetimes. In
the voluminous body of literature on the subject,
what is rigorously meant by an inﬂationary space-
time varies between authors. By introducing Defn. 2,
we have suggested a standardized deﬁnition for inﬂa-
tion which underpins the geometrical requirements
while broadly encompassing physically reasonable
phenomenology. We have further introduced Hγ and
Hγ
avg and discussed both advantages and disadvan-
tages to this deﬁnition, culminating with the gener-
alizations of Eqs.
16, 17 removing the underlying
topological ambiguities of Thm. 1 by including the
asymptotic past and future. Drawing on this equa-
tion, we discussed an uncountably inﬁnite cohort of
classical monsters which are geodesically complete
despite having Havg > 0 in some computations, in
contradiction to the arguments found in [9] being
supplanted by the calculations of [20]. These results
are purely geometric and apply for any metrical the-
ory of gravity.
The solutions presented necessarily violated tradi-
tional energy conditions within the context of pure
GR; although it is possible, such solutions may exist
within non-canonical scalar ﬁeld theories in a stable
way as discussed above. Again within the context of
GR the solutions may suﬀer from quantum consid-
erations, as discussed in [22], leading to the possible
exclusion of this class of classical monsters from the
domain of discourse for physically reasonable scale
factors; however, a deeper understanding of quan-
tum gravity is needed to deﬁnitively make such a
statement. For the time being, the question of the
viability of eternal inﬂation, and the controversy of
Havg is far from settled, leaving many possibilities
for future work.
