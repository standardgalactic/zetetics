ABSTRACT
Spectral unmixing decomposes an hyperspectral image into a collection of reflectance spectra of the macroscopic
materials present in the scene, called endmembers, and the corresponding abundance fractions of these constituents. The
purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of several algorithms that process unsupervised endmember
extraction from hyperspectral images in the visible and NIR spectral ranges. After giving an analytical formulation of the
observations, two significantly different approaches have been described. The first one exploits convex geometry the
problem answers to. The second one is based on statistical principles of Independent Component Analysis, which is a
classical resolution of the Blind Source Separation issue. First, the performance of the algorithms are compared on
synthetic images and sensibility to noise is studied. Then the best methods are applied on part of a HyMap image.
Keywords: Hyperspectral imagery, spectral unmixing, unsupervised endmember extraction, Independent Component
Analysis.

INTRODUCTION
Hyperspectral sensors provide images which are usually acquired in a few hundred wavelengths simultaneously. After
atmospheric correction, the visible and near infrared spectral radiances are converted into pixel reflectance spectra.
Consequently, each pixel is characterised by a reflectance measurement vector. Generally, several macroscopic
components, called endmembers, are present in the scene: soil, vegetation, water, human buildings, etc. Their spectral
signatures contribute to the observed spectra of the pixels. Spectral unmixing is the procedure by which the spectrum of
each pixel is decomposed into a series of pure spectra and their respective abundances. The analytical model which is
chosen to describe the observations intrinsically determines the techniques that can be implemented to perform spectral
unmixing. The most commonly used model is linear [5]. It constitutes a good approximation in this context, that is to say
the reflective spectral domain ranging from 0.4 µm to 2.5 µm. It assumes that the spectrum
p

of a pixel p in L
bands is a linear combination of the spectra
iS of the M pure materials that appear in the scene. It can be written:

To solve equation (1) where both A and S are unknown, two kinds of approaches have been already suggested. The
first one calls upon convex geometry principles the problem answers to and is going to be described in the second
paragraph. The second one, dealt in the third paragraph, is funded on blind source separation, a technique that proved
reliable in the fields of acoustics, biomedical, etc.

THE SPECTRAL UNMIXING, A CONVEX GEOMETRY ISSUE
The spectra of observed pixels can be represented in an L -dimensional scatterplot, the hyperspectral space, as points
whose coordinates are L -tuples of reflectance values. If the previously defined mixing model is correct, it can be shown
that the dataset of the observations does not occupy all this hyperspectral space. More precisely, there is a link between
the number of endmembers which appears in the image and the dimension of the subset really occupied by the data: the
pixels of an image where M materials are present form a M -simplex, that is to say the simplest geometric shape that
encloses a space of dimension
1
−
M
. For instance, a 2-simplex is a segment, a 3-simplex is a triangle (Fig. 1), a 4-
simplex is a tetrahedron, etc. Moreover, the vertices of this simplex are the sought endmember spectra.
Figure 1 : A simplex in 2-dimension space
According to the considerations of the last paragraph, to determine the number of constituents present in the image,
unknown a priori, it is sufficient to find the dimension of the space really occupied by the dataset.
A dimension reduction via Principal Components Analysis (PCA), which consists in looking for the high variance axes,
allows decreasing the number of bands in an image to be one less than the number of endmembers. This classical pre-
processing step allows projecting the data vectors onto the Principal Component Space. Let X be the
N
L×
matrix
which collects the spectra of the N pixels of the image in L spectral bands. The data are centered:

Several approaches can be used to determine the number of bands to be retained after the PCA. We chose the following
one. Since the eigenvectors are sorted according to the magnitudes of the eigenvalues, most of the information is
contained in the first components which are thoses with largest variance. Taking bands in decreasing order of their
eigenvalues until their sum be higher than a predefined thresholdη , for instance 99%, the number of bands are reduced
significantly to

2.1 N-FINDR algorithm
The vertices of the simplex defined by the dataset are the sought spectra. Two algorithms have been tested to estimate
them. The first algorithm, called N-FINDR [9], looks for the “largest” simplex that could be inscribed inside the data. It
assumes that the endmembers are present among the mixed pixels. Let
+
Sˆ
be the augmented matrix of the pure
components:

Therefore, the procedure consists in searching the set of M pixels with the largest possible volume. The algorithm has a
finite complexity since the number of iterations is the combinatory number

if N is the number of pixels in the
image.
2.2 ICE algorithm
The second algorithm, “Iterative Constrained Endmembers” [2], has a more statistical nature. It is based on estimations
iS~ and

of the parameters
iS and
pi

It deals with a least square minimisation issue. The solutions of this problem are all the M -simplex which encloses the
dataset formed by the observations. It is necessary to introduce a regularisation term to take into account the size of the
simplex. Instead of using the volume of the simplex, which would require too much computation time due to the
computation of the determinant, another measure of the size is used : it is the sum of the squared distances between the
vertices of the simplex. Then, the quantity to be minimised is :

THE SPECTRAL UNMIXING, A BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION ISSUE
For a decade, a lot of publications have focused on Independent Component Analysis, and more generally Blind Source
Separation, because it represents a efficient means to resolve problem of mixing/unmixing. The issue can be formulated
in the following way [3] :

Under three additional assumptions – the sources are mutually independent, there are more observations than sources, at
the most one source has Gaussian distribution –, the problem consists in finding a linear transformation W to be applied
on the observations in order to obtain the most statistically independent estimated sources.
As it deals with exploiting the independent feature of the sources, a criterion that measures this independence has to be
introduced. In the information theory framework, the mutual information

implementation of this approach was tested with sources different from those presented. However, the algorithm too
often diverges.
Finally, we chose to implement the “extended infomax” algorithm as it is described by Lee et al. [7]. It allows to separate
mixed sources with subgaussian and supergaussian distributions, that is to say respectively with negative and positive
kurtosis values. The learning rule is :

At this point, it is imperative to make a parallelism between ICA and spectral unmixing. Precisely, we have to answer the
following questions. What are observations called? What are sources called? In the literature, it can be found two ways
of answering these questions.
The first intuitive approach (ICA1) consists in considering pixel spectra as observations. Therefore, the sources are the
endmember spectral signatures. The mixing equation introduced by spectral mixing is identically the ICA one.

Now, one observation is the reflectance values in one band for all the pixels. Consequently, one source is the abundances
of one material in all the pixels. However, in this configuration, the sources are not statically independent as the linear
mixing model imposes that, for each pixel, the sum of all the material abundances is equal to 1. In this constrained case,
it can be demonstrated that ICA will generate estimated sources that will be variations with an average abundances [6].
The minimum and the maximum of these sources indicate pure pixels. By picking these extreme values in the estimated
source matrix, the original endmember spectra can be found. Therefore, with this approach, only two sources can be
recovered.
4.
TEST ON SYNTHETIC IMAGES
To test the two algorithms on synthetic images, two aspects have to be chosen: firstly, the pure components involved in
the mixture and, secondly, their spatial repartitions and respective abundances in the image. The chosen endmembers are
representative of urban or suburban environment. The spectra of the components are shown Fig. 2.
The spatial repartitions are displayed Fig. 3. On these simulated images, several areas are defined where one or several
components are distributed randomly with different averages.
Proc. of SPIE Vol. 5982  598213-5

Figure 2 : Spectra of the endmembers involved in the mixture
Figure 3 : Spatial repartition of the original materials
To evaluate the robustness of the algorithms, an additive uniform noise is added to the observations in all the bands and
for each pixel. The mixing equation becomes :
B
AS
X
+
=
where B is a
L
N ×
matrix if N pixels compose the image and if the reflectances are acquired in L spectral bands
with
ijb
uniformly distributed in [-β ;+ β] . The tests are done with values of β equal to 0, 0.15 and 0.40.
To measure the quality of the estimation, a quantity which gauges the likelihood between the real spectrum x and its
estimation xˆ has to be introduced. In the field of hyperspectral imagery, the comparison of signals resorts to the variable
called spectral angle which measures the angle between two spectra in the hyperspectral space [4]:

The ICA 2 algorithm appears to be very sensitive to the level of noise (Fig. 4). For a mixture of two components, N-
FINDR performs an accurate endmember extraction. The two other algorithms provide approximately the same results,
less accurate than those obtained with N-FINDR and they seem to be sensitive to the sources nature.

As previously, for a mixture of three components, N-FINDR is the most accurate. The two algorithms based on
Independent Component Analysis are not able to estimate the spectra of the endmembers reliably (Fig. 5). At this stage
of the simulations, it was decided to carry on with the two most performing algorithms based on geometric
considerations, that is to say the N-FINDR and the ICE algorithms.

Figure 6 : Cosines of the Spectral Angles between real endmembers spectra and endmembers spectra estimated
by N-FINDR and ICE algorithms for two different mixtures of four components
When four components are present in the image (Fig. 6), N-FINDR still gives an accurate estimation of the endmembers,
even with moderately noisy spectra (β=0.15). For higher (β=0.4), the quality of the retrievals begins to decrease, but is
still acceptable.
At the issue of these tests on synthetic images, N-FINDR seems to provide the most accurate endmember estimates. ICE
results are less satisfying, as the

values are less than 0.99 in most cases. The ICA 1 algorithm fails for more
than two sources; the ICA 2 algorithm is very sensitive to the noise.

TEST ON HYMAP IMAGE
The two “geometric” algorithms are tested on a hyperspectral image acquired by the HyMap instrument over
the
Hartheim conifer forest. On Fig. 7, the 66x66 pixels of the studied image are represented at the wavelength λ=0.701 µm
(spectral band 19). The forest is crossed by grass tracks. Two water points appear in black on the image. We defined
regions of interest (ROIs), characteristic of each constituent, where the spectra of the pixels are averaged.

On Fig. 8, the estimated endmembers spectra (red curve) are superposed with the ground measurements over conifer
(blue curve) taken from a 10 meters pylon, and with the extreme airborne spectra in the corresponding ROIs. Spectral
angles between endmembers and ROIs mean spectra are computed.

angles).
The extraction of the water is difficult because of its low reflectance. The conifer spectrum is well estimated by the two
algorithms and the third endmember is quite representative of spectra collected on the track composed of a mixture of
more or less dry and green grass.

CONCLUSION AND FINAL REMARKS
This paper consisted in comparing performances of four algorithms dedicated to resolving the problem of endmembers
extraction in hyperspectral images. A description of the observations by a linear model allowed introducing two different
approaches. The first one, based on stochastic notion of Independent Component Analysis, does not seem to provide an
efficient mean to estimate the sought spectra reliably as soon as more than two components are present in the image or as
soon as the observations are very noisy. The second approach exploits geometric characteristics the problem answers to.
At the issue of tests on synthetic images, N-FINDR seems to provide the most accurate endmember estimates. ICE
results are less satisfying, as the values of the spectral angles cosine between real and estimated endmembers spectra are
less than 0.99 in most cases. On the other hand, when applied to a part of HyMap image, the “geometric” algorithms, are
able to provide good estimates of endmembers spectra, with slightly better results for the ICE algorithm.
