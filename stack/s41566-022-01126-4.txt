Optical metasurfaces—subwavelength-patterned surfaces that interact 
strongly with light—have been an active area of research for more than a 
decade. The field has been driven by the key advantages of this concept, 
including the ultimate miniaturization of optical elements, empowering 
novel functionalities that process hidden modalities of light, and the 
opportunity to tune their properties on demand. A large number of 
applications with a focus on smart vision have emerged, foreseeing a 
meta-optical device under the hood of any robotic system. Nowadays, the 
field is experiencing a solid industry pull that defines the challenges and 
research directions. This review overviews the application focus of the field 
defined by the growing number of optical functionalities. We describe the 
current challenges and outline the research frontiers in the field.
Light carries an enormous amount of information that enables 
humans and autonomous machines to see and understand the world. 
However, this information is often hidden from our eyes, which only 
react to light intensity and colours in the visible spectral range. The 
hidden attributes of light, including phase, polarization or angular 
momentum, can be extracted by smart optical devices that enable 
machine vision to surpass conventional vision. Novel smart optical 
systems can also allow us to see such hidden information through 
human–machine interfaces, such as virtual and augmented reality 
(VR/AR) displays, wearable sensors and artificial intelligence in the 
photonic domain. But what is under the hood of a robotic system 
that can enable superior vision across multiple spectral bands? 
Conventional optical technologies are too bulky to allow advanced 
functionalities in a small device. For example, how many more lenses 
can one fit on a mobile phone? Such miniaturized advanced-vision 
technologies require radically new approaches for smart optical 
systems. The concept of meta-optics might provide the awaited 
solution. Meta-optics is based on subwavelength-patterned sur-
faces, called metasurfaces, which acquire optical functionalities 
through the scattering of nanoparticles rather than by refraction. 
Metasurfaces offer extreme miniaturization of optical components, 
together with smart functionalities beyond what is possible with 
conventional optics. The name stems from the Greek word μετά 
(meta), meaning ‘after’ or ‘beyond’, referring to optics beyond the 
three-millennia-old conventional optics. The meta-optics concept 
provides a viable pathway for developing advanced machine vision 
by engineering—with unprecedented spatial resolution—the light 
wavefront, emission and absorption.
The field of meta-optics has emerged from pioneering works on 
wavefront and polarization control1,2. The name ‘meta-optics’ was 
coined by Ross McPhedran and colleagues in 20113 and has found wide 
acceptance worldwide. Over the past decade, the field has grown expo-
nentially, with over 160 groups working in the field, including major 
research centres worldwide. We are witnessing thousands of research 
publications and industrial patents every year. Although this growth 
reflects the importance of meta-optical development, it also presents 
challenges where novel and disruptive ideas cannot easily be noticed4. 
This Review aims to map the active research areas in the field over the 
past five years, identify key concepts, discuss the existing challenges 
and provide a vision for the impact of the technology.
By mapping the activities in the field, we have identified three main 
stages of importance. These are presented as an artist-impression map 
in Fig. 1. At the focal spot of this map is the fundamental research on 
understanding the physics of metasurface elements. Their response 
is driven by optical resonance (localized or lattice-type5) and can be 
tailored by their geometry for efficient light manipulation, generation 
and detection. A composition of metasurface elements forms a metade-
vice that can deliver enhanced optical functionalities. The research on 
metadevices represents an increasingly large set of activities. It focuses 
on metasurface functionalities that cannot be achieved conventionally 
or exhibit improved performance with a miniaturized footprint. Exam-
ples include (Fig. 1, middle) flat metalenses6–9, polarization routers10,

seeking new applications. One can conclude that a strong industry drive 
currently defines the progress in the field. Namely, the new industrial 
applications define the research problems the field needs to solve. Sev-
eral other inspiring applications beyond vision can be identified. These 
include using metasurfaces in light sail technologies20,21, light-fidelity 
(LiFi) communications22 and thermal management23.
To understand how such applications can benefit from the integra-
tion of optical metasurfaces, we next review their basic functionalities. 
We then describe how these functionalities can be achieved and outline 
the challenges in recent research.
Metasurface functionalities
Metasurfaces have gained a great deal of attention for their ability 
to control the spatial wavefront of light1,2, linking the fields of dif-
fractive and nano-optics. Subsequently, metasurface functionalities 
have greatly increased, as summarized in Fig. 2 and described in the 
following.
Spectral and dispersion control
The frequency selectivity of metasurfaces stems directly from their res-
onant behaviour and, to a large extent, borrows ideas from the field of 
frequency-selective surfaces in radio waves. It is one of the oldest appli-
cations of optical metasurfaces, aiming at realizing notch or bandpass 
filters in a single nanostructured layer. Application examples include 
eye protection from harmful lasers, such as in existing commercial 
products by Meta Materials Inc. (www.metamaterial.com). Over recent 
specialty microscopy coverslips11,12 and biosensors13,14. The product 
development of such metadevices has been the focus of several start-up 
companies, such as Metalenz (www.metalenz.com), NILT Technologies 
(www.nilt.com) and Meta Materials Inc. (www.metamaterial.com), to 
mention a few. In the search for markets, this industrial uptake also 
sets new challenges and seeks solutions from the research community.
However, the biggest driver for the meta-optics field comes from 
integrating metadevices into optical systems to offer new consumer 
optoelectronics applications. Importantly, meta-optical systems ena-
ble novel applications not conceivable before, adding to so-called 
Industry 4.015. Such applications include the Internet of Things (IoT), 
vision for autonomous cars, wearable devices, AR and remote sensing. 
For example, an autonomously driving car requires three-dimensional 
(3D) vision enabled by light detection and ranging (LIDAR) devices in 
the infrared. Wearable sensors must see under the skin tissue, and AR 
systems must display objects in conjunction with eye movements. 
Several examples of current industrial applications of metasurfaces 
are listed in Fig. 1 (right), and many more system-level applications 
are likely to emerge. Without a doubt, vision applications dominate, 
including (from top to bottom) 3D imaging by point-cloud illumina-
tion, AR vision16, holographic displays17, 3D LIDAR vision18, and image 
processing and classification19. Over recent years, big industry players 
such as Apple, Google, Samsung, Meta (Facebook), Huawei, Sony and 
STMicroelectronics have explored such meta-optical applications. 
These and other companies have been actively investing in integrating 
meta-optical systems in their products, hiring graduates in the field and

years, researchers have extended the concepts to filters in the infrared 
and terahertz spectral regions, where conventional materials do not 
perform well24. Furthermore, narrow-bandpass filters with flat angular 
dispersion are of great importance in machine vision applications25.
Another important application of the spectral selectivity of 
metasurfaces is the development of structural colours26,27, where the 
frequency selectivity of metasurfaces has been explored to create 
bright colours spanning the entire chromaticity diagram. Examples 
include plasmonic26 and Mie resonant metasurfaces28. Several design 
techniques have been used to enhance the visual performance of such 
colours, including forward, inverse and machine learning designs. 
Some recent works have made a further nontrivial extension, aiming 
at routing different spectral components to selected pixels29 instead 
of filtering them. Such colour-routing schemes direct all incom-
ing photons towards the detector and could benefit applications in 
low-light conditions.
The metasurface frequency response is highly dispersive (having 
a π phase shift across the resonance), allowing for effective dispersion 
control. This functionality enables achromatic30 or hyper-dispersive31 
metasurfaces, with achromatic metalenses being one of the most 
prominent examples8,32. Dispersion control is achieved by careful 
engineering of the meta-atom geometry. However, the obtained 
group delays are relatively small, limiting the transverse size of the 
meta-optical elements8.
Temporal control of light wavepackets
Temporal light control in metasurfaces can be realized by two 
approaches. The first comprises engineering of the group-delay 
dispersion, thereby imposing temporal reshaping of the transmit-
ted wavepackets. This opportunity was proposed in ref. 33 and was 
recently demonstrated using a Fourier-transform set-up34 and by direct 
dispersion engineering35. Although the overall group-velocity dis-
persion remains low, metasurfaces can still outperform conventional 
pulse-shaping techniques.
The second approach for temporal control is achieved by realizing 
metasurfaces with time-varying characteristics36. This approach is 
difficult at optical frequencies. However, it is feasible in the terahertz 
and microwave regions. Importantly, it allows for implementing spati-
otemporal light modulations to manipulate the electromagnetic waves 
in both spectral and spatial domains37. Spatiotemporal programmable 
metasurfaces bridge the physical and digital worlds, leading to an 
entirely new platform of information-operating metamaterials, which 
can be coined ‘informational metasurfaces’. The reprogrammable 
capability offers numerous applications ranging from LiFi communi-
cations to self-adaptive and cognitive radars empowered by artificial 
intelligence algorithms.
Notably, the time variation of the metasurface properties can be 
explored for breaking optical reciprocity, leading to applications in 
free-space optical isolators. The required ultrafast time modulation 
can be achieved using Kerr-type optical nonlinearity38. However, the 
small modulation depth limits the overall applicability of the approach 
in the optical spectral range.
Wavefront control
Wavefront control of light beams is the driving-force functionality of 
optical metasurfaces. It relies on spatially tailoring the metasurface 
properties and altering the transmitted or reflected light wavefront. 
As such, spatial engineering can be achieved at a subwavelength 
scale, diffraction is suppressed, and the wavefront manipulation 
can have close-to-unity efficiency. We note that wavefront control 
can be accomplished by either amplitude or phase modulation (or 
a combination of both). For increased efficiency, phase modulation 
is preferred and can enable beam focusing and imaging32,39, as well 
as holographic projections40. Achieving full 2π phase modulation in 
reflection is more accessible, as it only requires control of a single 
resonant mode41. In transmission, more than one mode is necessary 
for a 2π phase modulation. This multimode response is achieved in 
dielectric metasurfaces using Huygens-condition33 or waveguiding39 
approaches. The latter offers higher efficiency and is commonly used 
in industrial designs.
Polarization control
Metasurfaces can enable the polarization control of light waves, 
because anisotropic meta-atoms can have vastly different responses to 
orthogonal polarizations. Ideally, the meta-atoms should have unitary 
transmission/reflection for both polarizations, but different phases. 
The meta-atoms can therefore act as nanoscopic waveplates for the 
incoming light. Placing such nano-waveplates at different spatial posi-
tions and orientations offers unprecedented polarization control39. 
Critical applications include polarimetry and polarization imaging10.
In addition, metasurfaces can be engineered to enhance chirality 
and chiral near-fields42, as well as to be achiral but enhance the sensi-
tivity to chiral molecules in their proximity43. The latter opens new 
applications in biosensing chiral molecules that are important for the 
pharmaceutical industry.
Emission control
Metasurfaces can alter the rate of spontaneous emission processes 
through resonant Purcell enhancement. This enhancement is propor-
tional to the quality factor of the resonance and inversely proportional 
to the mode volume. The latter, however, requires special considera-
tions, as metasurfaces are open systems and radiate into free space44. 
The Purcell enhancements can be considerably higher in plasmonic 
metasurfaces due to their localized mode volume. For optically excited 
emitters, the emission rate can be further enhanced by resonances 
at the pump wavelength. In addition, the directionality of emission 
could be engineered through multipolar interference in dielectric 
metasurfaces45. For delocalized emitters, such as 2D transition-metal 
dichalcogenides46,47, or thermal emission23,48, careful engineering of 
the metasurface modes is required to take advantage of their near-field 
enhancement. Critical applications include brighter light-emitting 
diodes and thermal sources.

In the case of high-quality-factor metasurfaces, lasing action can 
also be obtained49 where the directionality50 and mode profile51 can 
be engineered. The process of nonlinear frequency conversions, such 
as second harmonic generation (SHG) to a large extent, can also be 
considered an emission process due to the excitation of nonlinear 
currents inside the metasurfaces. SHG has been explored in plasmonic 
and dielectric metasurfaces52. However, the dielectric metasurfaces 
enable substantially higher frequency conversion rates due to their 
larger mode volume and higher pumping powers. Although the achiev-
able conversion efficiencies remain below 1%, possible applications 
include frequency upconversion of infrared imaging53 for night- 
vision applications.
Manipulating the quantum properties of light
Optical metasurfaces have been explored for quantum light gen-
eration, including single- or bi-photon states and for manipulat-
ing quantum states54. The brightness of single-photon emitters 
can also be enhanced following the emission-control functionality 
described above. However, such emitters are highly localized, requir-
ing high-precision placement on the metasurface. Such placement 
remains a substantial challenge, and the benefits of integrating 
single-photon emitters with metasurfaces remain elusive. The genera-
tion of bi-photon quantum states by spontaneous parametric down-
conversion from nonlinear quadratic metasurfaces shows greater 
promise. Mie resonant55 and high-quality-factor metasurfaces56 have 
been successfully used to generate bi-photon states and complex 
quantum states57. A metalens array, combined with a bulk nonlinear 
crystal, has also been used to generate multiphoton quantum states58. 
The generation of quantum entanglement from metasurfaces has also 
been demonstrated recently56.
Finally, metasurfaces have shown a great ability to manipu-
late the state of quantum light after its generation. Manipulations 
of single-photon59 and multiphoton states60 have been successfully 
demonstrated. These pioneering experiments are paving the way for 
novel quantum applications of metasurfaces, such as quantum imag-
ing, sensing and communications.
Detection control
The engineering of the modes of metasurfaces allows for enhancing 
light absorption in ultrathin layers. The absorbed energy can be con-
verted into heat, photocurrent or hot carriers. Plasmonic enhanced 
photo-thermoelectric conversion61 and plasmon-induced hot carri-
ers62 are showing great promise for applications in infrared detection, 
despite their lower efficiency.
The resonance phenomena in dielectric metasurfaces containing 
p–n junctions have been used to enhance the absorption of specific col-
ours at the pixel level63. Dielectric metasurfaces have further enabled 
the detection of different light modalities, including angle selectivity64. 
The exploration of such enhanced detection has allowed the realization 
of important devices, such as spectrometers65 and cameras63.
Control of chemical reactions
Metasurfaces have recently attracted attention to control chemical 
reactions based on light-driven charge exchange or strong coupling. 
Such control is mainly suitable for plasmonic metasurfaces66, although 
semiconductor systems, such as TiO2 and other metal oxides67, could 
also be employed. Plasmonic tunnel junctions for redox chemis-
try have been tested68, opening up critical applications in CO2 and  
water splitting.
Furthermore, light–matter hybridization can alter the chemical 
properties of the coupled system. Strong coupling between resonant 
metasurfaces and the material in their proximity can modify molecular 
transitions, chemical reactivity and superconductivity69.
Challenges for metasurface development
Although the meta-optics field has matured and is testing market 
opportunities, there are several challenges ahead. These can be divided 
into two broad categories: (1) materials and fabrication challenges, 
including large-scale and scalable fabrication, incorporating differ-
ent materials platforms, and (2) physics and engineering challenges, 
focusing on novel concepts, developing new designs with enhanced 
functionalities, and hybridizing metasurfaces with other materials—
multi-physics metasurfaces.

Materials and fabrication challenges
Metasurfaces are fabricated by planar fabrication technology, effec-
tively merging optics and chip-making. This planar fabrication presents 
a tremendous advantage for translation to industrial applications. In 
comparison, nanostructuring of bulk 3D materials remains a considera-
ble challenge. Although techniques such as 3D laser writing70 are getting 
closer to sub-100-nm resolution, volumetric metamaterials operating 
in the visible and near-infrared remain out of reach. As a result, planar 
metasurfaces dominate research and applications. However, many 
materials used in the research laboratories for metasurface fabrica-
tion are incompatible with the industry standards of semiconductor 
fabrication foundries. It is therefore often challenging to translate the 
technology to scalable manufacturing and industry-ready standards. 
For example, common plasmonic metals like gold and silver are incom-
patible with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) fab-
rication. Dielectric metasurfaces, often made of silicon, have bridged 
that gap. However, although conventional CMOS chip-making uses 
silicon-on-insulator wafers, silicon on transparent substrates is required 
for optical metasurfaces. The technology of amorphous silicon (a-Si) on 
glass wafers has recently been demonstrated by Metalenz together with 
STMicroelectronics, using extreme ultraviolet (XUV) lithography (www.
metalenz.com). However, this fabrication is not without challenges, 
including the reproducibility of the a-Si-layer deposition, its robustness 
to environmental changes, and process challenges when using glass 
wafers. Implementing other materials for operation in the visible and 
UV spectral ranges will further challenge the fabrication processes.
In terms of the design aspect, metasurfaces have made enormous 
progress over recent years, figuratively named by Federico Capasso as 
a transition from realism to surrealism. Indeed, the initial ‘work-horse’ 
nano-cylinder meta-atoms have been replaced by high-performing 
inverse design structures. Figure 3a shows one example used for 
large-angle beam deflection71. Complex dispersion-engineered 
meta-atoms65 have also been explored (Fig. 3b), and full 3D designs 
achieved by laser printing (Fig. 3c) have been employed for moving 
holographic images70.
With the expansion of meta-optics applications, the community 
is actively exploring the fabrication of different high-index dielectric 
materials. For example, crystalline materials with second-order non-
linearity are required in nonlinear applications52, such as SHG. One of 
the most used materials in this regard is GaAs and its Al compounds72. 
However, challenges due to the limited transparency of GaAs and its 
off-diagonal nonlinear susceptibility tensor, and metasurfaces from 
other transparent crystals, have been sought. An enhanced SHG has 
been demonstrated in lithium niobate73 (Fig. 3d) and in GaP metas-
urfaces74 (Fig. 3e). Beyond nonlinear applications, other dielectric 
materials, such as TiO2
32, GaN40, SiN75 and SiC76, have also been tested. 
Although many of these semiconductor metasurfaces can operate from 
the visible to the infrared spectral regions, the extension of their opera-
tion to the ultraviolet (UV) range has been a challenge. This challenge 
lies in the transparency of the materials in the UV range and the required 
small feature sizes. Nevertheless, the first demonstrations of functional 
UV metasurfaces using hafnium oxide have been presented77. Vacuum 
ultraviolet nonlinear metalenses based on ZnO meta-atoms have also 
been demonstrated recently78.
Finally, the fabrication of large-area metasurfaces that can 
replace existing optical elements is not without challenges. Most 
electron-beam lithography tools used in the laboratory cannot pat-
tern large areas, and advanced photomasks are required for deep-UV 
lithography. Nevertheless, large-area meta-optical elements have 
recently been demonstrated79 (Fig. 3g), and this is expected to increase 
industry interest further.
Physics and engineering challenges
It is impossible to identify all the challenges in a field with so many 
diverse applications, so we focus here on some of the global ones. As 
the major challenge, we identify the tunability of the optical response 
of metasurfaces, including the tunability of transmission amplitude, 
phase and polarization. Such tunability can enable the realization of 
programmable meta-optical elements, which can perform arbitrary 
operations depending on an external stimulus. For example, spatially 
variant tuning of the transmitted phase can allow a single metasurface 
to become a length lens, a beam shaper or a hologram. Because the 
meta-atoms have nanoscale volumes, it should be easier to tune their 
properties. However, so far, no unified approach exists, and most works 
consider only amplitude modulation. To our knowledge, no continu-
ous 2π phase modulation (with unity efficiency) nor full polarization 
control has been reported. The difficulty is that for both phase and 
polarization tuning, simultaneous control of the spectral positions of 
two optical modes is needed, and this requires two control parameters.
The tunability of metasurfaces can be enabled by three generic 
principles: (1) altering the resonator material (Fig. 4a) through a mate-
rial phase change80,81, thermo-optics82, electro-optics83 or carrier

injections37,84; (2) modifying the surrounding environment (Fig. 4b) 
by liquid crystals85,86 or optofluidics87; (3) changing the geometry  
(Fig. 4c) by mechanical actuations88 or stretching89. Which of these 
tuning mechanisms will meet the industry standards remains to be 
seen, but is likely to be defined by the specific application constraints.
Another major challenge in the field is the complete control of 
angular and spectral dispersion90 (Fig. 4d). Such control is expected to 
have a powerful impact on applications of dispersive31 and achromatic 
meta-optics91,92. The angular dispersion also plays a vital role in optical 
image processing, including edge detection by image differentiation11,93 
(Fig. 4d).
As meta-optical elements are becoming integral to various optical 
systems, it is becoming increasingly important to have tools for a full 
system design. This need has triggered strong activity regarding inverse 
design, including end-to-end designs94, large-scale meta-optics79 and 
3D inverse designs95 (Fig. 4e).
Finally, the coupling of optical metasurfaces to other material 
degrees of freedom, including atomic96, excitonic97, phononic88 and 
polaritonic excitations98, is facilitating completely unknown opportu-
nities for multi-physics metasurfaces (Fig. 4f). In the strong coupling 
regime, the optical and materials properties are hybridized, leading 
to novel polaritonic regimes and phenomena. The modification of 
chemical reactions, discussed in Fig. 2h, is an important example of 
such a novel phenomenon.
Frontiers in metasurface research
To meet the above challenges, research frontiers have focused on sev-
eral fundamental and applied directions. On the fundamental side, 
these include the implementation of deep learning and inverse design 
approaches99,100 for obtaining the desired spectral, phase, polarization 
and transverse momentum responses. For example, Fig. 5a shows a 
neural network technique for tailoring the metasurface transmission

spectrum101. The next frontier is focused on achieving metasurface 
tunability on a pixel level. Here, challenges associated with pixel cross-
talk, tuning speed and electrical control need to be solved to enable 
electrically programmable mega-pixel metasurfaces. Figure 5b shows 
one promising approach based on phase-change materials81. Another 
important frontier is spatial dispersion engineering through the design 
of nonlocal metasurfaces102. Figure 5c shows the use of a spatially dis-
persive metasurface in biosensing103.
Arguably, one of the most exciting research frontiers is the appli-
cation of optical metasurfaces for quantum light generation56,57, 
detection104 (Fig. 5d) and classification60. Although still in its infancy, 
quantum light direction promises important applications. Metas-
urfaces with gain and loss can also be considered as an upcoming 
frontier. Such metasurfaces can be designed to exhibit unconventional 
non-Hermitian properties, supporting exceptional points for unidirec-
tional propagation and adiabatic mode conversion. Figure 5e presents 
an example of non-Hermitian metasurfaces, which allow for ultrasensi-
tive measurements105. The integration of 2D materials47 also opens new 
opportunities for frontier optoelectronic applications, enabled, for 
example, by precision control of excitonic excitations97 (Fig. 5f). Finally, 
the concept of space–time metasurfaces is important for complete 
spatiotemporal wavefront control. This has been demonstrated in

the microwave spectral range106 (Fig. 5g), and it is highly desirable to 
translate it to the optical domain.
On the application side, research frontiers are focusing on devel-
oping smart vision, with three key aspects in mind. The first is the reali-
zation of better imaging devices through multi-layered metasurfaces. 
Although single-layer metasurfaces have been successfully employed 
in many meta-optical applications, multi-layered metasurfaces are 
required for full aberration correction and novel functionalities. 
Stacking of multiple metasurfaces is still challenging, but it offers an 
increased degree of design freedom and allows for multi-wavelength107 
and white-light focusing108 (Fig. 6a) or multicolour holograms109. 
The second aspect of smart vision is focused on image-processing 
metasurfaces. An important example of image processing is the edge 
detection of images, as shown in Fig. 6b. However, more complex 
imaging functions, including image classification19, are also being 
investigated. The third aspect focuses on machine–human interfaces, 
such as AR vision sets, where the display, processing and tracking func-
tions must be combined. A recent example of simultaneous display 
and eye-tracking functions by guided-wave metasurfaces110 is shown 
in Fig. 6c. We expect this set of frontier technologies to expand fur-
ther, as metasurfaces prove their potential and reliability in end-user 
optical systems.
Perspective
Overall, optical metasurfaces present several essential benefits to mod-
ern optical technologies. First, they allow for the ultimate miniaturiza-
tion of optical components, reducing the size, weight and power (SWaP) 
requirements for optical systems. Such miniaturization is essential in 
modern consumer optoelectronic devices, drones and space applica-
tions. Second, they enable smart functions that are not readily achiev-
able with conventional optics. These include visualizing the hidden 
information carried by light (for example, polarization, phase and 
other modalities) and integrating multiple functions in a single optical 
element, which is at the essence of Industry 4.0 applications. Third, the 
nanoscale volumes of the resonators offer opportunities for fast and 
real-time reconfigurability of optical functions, something that remains 
to be accomplished. We should also flag the advantages metasurfaces 
offer in exploring other spectral ranges, such as long and mid-wave 
infrared, which are not easily accessible with conventional glass optics 
and CMOS cameras. The development of novel optical components 
is particularly important for detecting infrared light, where no good 
detectors exist. Metasurface-enhanced infrared detectors can find 
important applications in night vision and the spectral identification 
of chemical compounds.
The research field of meta-optics has experienced an exponential 
growth of ideas over the past five years. These ideas have attracted 
industry interest that, in return, has defined new scientific questions 
and is driving the modern development of the field. Among the numer-
ous applications, machine vision is the most important market oppor-
tunity, offering capabilities surpassing human vision and enabling 
machine autonomy, for example, in autonomous vehicles. We are 
also seeing opportunities for meta-optics in enhancing human vision 
through AR technologies, and the formation of new machine–human 
interfaces. Of course, the path from research to market is much more 
complex than the published laboratory demonstrations. Market analy-
sis must consider the technology’s cost, reproducibility, scalability 
and long-term stability. For example, stringent space testing must be 
performed for space-flight stability and compatibility to deploy light-
weight meta-optics in space. We envision that the first metadevices 
to be translated to the market will be metalenses and holographic 
elements for monochromatic imaging, such as in face ID or driver 
fatigue monitoring applications. These will probably be followed by AR 
applications about five years from now. However, one thing is sure—we 
will increasingly see optical metasurfaces under the hood of many 
consumer devices and Industry 4.0 applications.
