In this letter, we extend the tree-level Kawai–Lewellen–Tye (KLT) and Bern–Carrasco–Johansson
(BCJ) amplitude relations to loop integrands of gauge theory and gravity. By rearranging the prop-
agators of gauge and gravity loop integrands, we propose the ﬁrst manifestly gauge- and diﬀeomor-
phism invariant formulation of their double-copy relations. The one-loop KLT formula expresses
gravity integrands in terms of more basic gauge invariant building blocks for gauge-theory am-
plitudes, dubbed partial integrands.
The latter obey a one-loop analogue of the BCJ relations,
and both KLT and BCJ relations are universal to bosons and fermions in any number of space-
time dimensions and independent on the amount of supersymmetry. Also, one-loop integrands of
Einstein–Yang–Mills (EYM) theory are related to partial integrands of pure gauge theories.
INTRODUCTION
A uniﬁed perspective on fundamental forces intertwin-
ing gravity with gauge interactions is suggested by string
theory: Gravitons arise as the massless vibration modes
of closed strings which are in turn formed by joining
the endpoints of open strings with gauge bosons among
their ground-state excitations. A prominent perturbative
manifestation of gravity’s resulting double-copy structure
was revealed by Kawai, Lewellen and Tye (KLT) in 1985:
The KLT formula [1] assembles the tree-level S-matrix of
closed strings from squares of color-stripped open-string
amplitudes. Accordingly, its point-particle limit relates
tree amplitudes of Einstein gravity (and its supersym-
metric extensions) to squares of gauge-theory partial am-
plitudes. The structure of the KLT formula turned out to
apply universally to tree amplitudes in a variety of non-
gravitational theories, opening up a double-copy perspec-
tive on Born–Infeld theory and special Galileons [2], as
well as, surprisingly, even the open string [3–5].
It is remarkable that the double-copy structure appears
to extend to the quantum regime [6], as supported by
impressive constructions of multiloop supergravity am-
plitudes from gauge-theory input such as [7, 8]. The un-
precedented eﬃciency of this method gives rise to hope
that it allows to pinpoint the onset of ultraviolet di-
vergences in various supergravity theories, see e.g. [8].
So far, such double-copy constructions have been car-
ried out at the level of cubic diagrams which have to be
represented in a particular gauge of the spin-one con-
stituents and thereby obscure the diﬀeomorphism invari-
ance of gravity amplitudes. In this letter, we close this
gap and give the ﬁrst manifestly gauge- and diﬀeomor-
phism invariant “KLT-like” double-copy formula for their
loop integrands.
It does not depend on any particu-
lar gauge in arranging the cubic-diagram representation
of the gauge-theory integrands, and it takes a universal
form for bosons and fermions, regardless of the number
of spacetime dimensions and supersymmetries.
The double-copy approach to perturbative gravity re-
lies on a hidden symmetry of the gauge-theory S-matrix
– the duality between color and kinematics due to Bern,
Carrasco and Johansson (BCJ) [9]. Similar to the KLT
formula, the manifestly gauge invariant tree-level in-
carnation of this duality known as the BCJ relations
among color-stripped amplitudes was initially derived
from string theory [10] and turns out to also apply to ef-
fective scalar theories including non-linear sigma models
(NLSM) [5, 11]. Generalizations of BCJ relations to one-
loop integrands have already been given in a ﬁeld-theory
[12] and string-theory [13] context, and we will provide
an alternative formulation which is tailored to play out
with a KLT formula for one-loop gravity integrands.
A convenient framework to complement the string-
theory perspective on double copies as well as KLT and
BCJ relations is the CHY formalism due to Cachazo,
Yuan and one of the current authors [14].
The CHY
prescription for loop amplitudes [15, 16] manifests their
relation with forward limits of tree-level building blocks
[17] where one sums over the polarization and color de-
grees of freedom of two extra legs with back-to-back mo-
menta [18]. Indeed, the implementation of forward limits
in [16, 17] led us to identify the main results of this let-
ter, as will be detailed in [19]. By the same argument, we
ﬁnd similar results for Einstein–Yang–Mills (EYM) the-
ory. Given the wide range of double-copy theories, our
results should extend to the NLSM and its double copies
and reveal universal structural insights into the quantum
regime of perturbative ﬁeld and string theory.

MAIN RESULTS
A. Deﬁnition of loop integrands: The key ingredi-
ent in our construction is a new representation of loop
integrands in gauge and gravity theories, ﬁrst consid-
ered in [16] and [20]. The new representation can be ob-
tained by ﬁrst rearranging any Feynman loop integrand
via partial-fraction relations and then shifting the loop
momentum, which will not change the integrated result
in dimensional regularization. At one-loop level, this pro-
cedure converts an n-gon integral into a sum of n terms,
where all the inverse “propagators” but one become lin-
ear in the loop momentum. For example, the n-gon scalar
integral in ﬁgure 1 can be written as
Z
2n−1 dDL
L2(L+k1)2. . .(L+k1+k2+ . . . +kn−1)2 =

with inverse propagators sij... ≡1
2(ki+kj+ . . .)2 and
sij...,ℓ≡ℓ· (ki+kj+ . . .) + 1
2(ki+kj+ . . .)2 .
(2)
The procedure can be applied to any one-loop amplitude
with local propagators, and the result can be identiﬁed as
tree diagrams involving two oﬀ-shell legs with momenta
±ℓ[17].
For non-supersymmetric theories, tree ampli-
tudes diverge in the forward limit, but the divergences
can be regulated using the prescription of [20], or that
of [17] in the CHY representation.
In this way, one can rewrite one-loop n-point gravity
amplitudes Mn in the new representation as
Mn =
Z dDℓ
ℓ2
mn(ℓ) .
(3)
We will refer to mn(ℓ) as the integrand for one-loop grav-
ity amplitudes – its n−1 propagators are linear in ℓafter
stripping oﬀthe overall 1/ℓ2, and it can be obtained from
a KLT formula to be spelt out below.
B. Partial integrands: The backbone of our KLT
formula for mn(ℓ) is a novel reﬁnement of color-stripped
gauge-theory amplitudes A(1, 2, . . . , n). Given the rear-
rangement of loop integrals in (1), it is natural to col-
lect all terms with the loop momentum ﬂowing from leg
i to i+1 (cf. ﬁgure 1) in the more basic building block
a(1, 2, . . . , i, −, +, i+1, . . . , n). Identifying k± ≡±ℓ, this
partial integrand can be viewed as a tree amplitude with
cyclic ordering (1, 2, . . . , i, −, +, i+1, . . . , n) in the for-
ward limit of two oﬀ-shell legs −and +. Hence, par-
tial integrands are individually gauge invariant, assuming
that forward-limit divergences are suitably regulated. By
deﬁnition, the sum of n such partial integrands gives the
complete integrand of one-loop color-ordered amplitudes:
A(1, 2, . . . , n) =
Z dDℓ
ℓ2
n
X
i=1
a(1, 2, . . . , i, −, +, i+1, . . . , n) .
(4)
The notion of partial integrands is naturally motivated by
the one-loop formula in [16], but we emphasize that the
deﬁnition here is general and independent of any partic-
ular representation. Moreover, the decomposition (4) of
color-ordered amplitudes diﬀers signiﬁcantly from Q-cut
approach in eq. (6) of [20]. In the following we propose
BCJ relations among these a’s, and KLT relations that
combine them to the gravity integrands mn in (3).
C. One-loop BCJ relations: Having deﬁned par-
tial integrands of the form a(π(1, 2, . . . , n), −, +) with
permutations π ∈Sn, one deﬁnes a(α, −, β, +) for non-
adjacent legs −and + (with multiparticle labels such as
α = {α1, α2, . . . , αp}) via Kleiss–Kuijf relations of the
underlying (n+2)-point trees [21].
We conjecture that
they further satisfy universal BCJ relations like (n+2)-
point trees [9], leaving at most (n−1)! independent par-
tial integrands, even though additional relations may ex-
ist for special theories. These relations can be generated
by fundamental BCJ relations which involve changing the
position of one leg only. For instance, choosing + or 1
and deﬁning k12...i ≡k1 + k2 + . . . + ki yields
n−1
X
i=1
(ℓ· k12...i) a(1, 2, . . ., i, +, i+1, . . . , n, −) = 0 ,
(5)
and, by a similar use of momentum conservation,
n−1
X
i=2
(k1 · k23...i) a(2, 3, . . . , i, 1, i+1, . . . , n, −, +)
= (ℓ· k1) a(2, 3, . . . , n, −, 1, +) .
(6)
The BCJ relations should hold universally in D space-
time dimensions, for external bosons and fermions in the
adjoint representation of the gauge group and indepen-
dently on the extent of supersymmetry in a, ˜a.
D. One-loop KLT relations: As our main result,
we conjecture that the gravity integrands mn(ℓ) in (3)
can be obtained as bi-linears of partial integrands a, ˜a
of (possibly diﬀerent) gauge theories.
This manifestly
gauge- and diﬀeomorphism invariant incarnation of the
double copy [6] matches the (n+2)-point tree-level KLT
relations [1] with two additional legs k±= ± ℓ,
mn =
X
π,ρ∈Sn−1
a(+, π, n, −) S[π|ρ]ℓ˜a(+, ρ, −, n) ,
(7)
where π, ρ are permutations of 1, 2, . . ., n−1.
The all-
multiplicity KLT matrix S[π|ρ]ℓidentiﬁed in [22] has
been studied in the momentum-kernel formalism [23] and
allows for the recursive deﬁnition [5]
S[α, j|β, j, γ]ℓ= kj·(ℓ+kβ) S[α|β, γ]ℓ,
S[∅|∅]ℓ= 1 , (8)
with kβ = kβ1+. . .+kβp and β, γ = {β1, . . . , βp, γ1, . . . γq}
denoting the composition of multiparticle labels β and γ.
The KLT relations (7) should be valid for any (possibly
asymmetric) double copy of gauge theories whose partial
integrands satisfy the above one-loop BCJ relations.

EXAMPLES
In this section, we provide evidence for one-loop BCJ and
KLT relations, using examples of (partial) integrands a
and mn in gauge theories and supergravities with max-
imal or half-maximal supersymmetry. Supergravity in-
tegrands with 24 supercharges can be obtained from the
double copy of a1/2 and ˜amax. We exemplify the degen-
erations of the BCJ basis in these supersymmetric cases
below (n−1)! elements and leave explicit checks for the-
ories without supersymmetry to the future.

IMPLICATIONS FOR EINSTEIN–YANG–MILLS
Given the one-loop KLT relations (7) between amplitudes
of pure (super-)gravity and pure gauge theories, it is nat-
ural to investigate their minimal coupling within EYM
theories. At tree level, EYM amplitudes were related to
pure gauge-theory amplitudes [32, 33], and we will give
one-loop extensions of such relations in this section.
A. Partial integrands for EYM: In analogy to (4),
one can decompose the single-trace sector of one-loop
EYM amplitudes with insertions of m external gravitons
{p} = {p1, p2, . . . , pm} into partial integrands aEYM,
AEYM(1, 2, . . . , n; {p}) =
Z dDℓ
ℓ2
(24)
×
n
X
i=1
aEYM(1, 2, . . . , i, −, +, i+1, . . . , n; {p}) ,
where any propagator in the second line is rendered lin-
ear in ℓvia (1).
With the convention that (24) only
tracks the propagation of gauge multiplets in the loop,
any aEYM can be obtained from the forward limit of
a tree-level EYM amplitude with single-trace ordering
(1, 2, . . . , i, −, +, i+1, . . . , n).
Extensions of (24) to in-
corporate graviton propagators are related to trees with
additional pj and go beyond the scope of this work.
B. One-loop amplitude relations:

A similar identiﬁcation of legs (1, n) →(+, −) can be
performed to promote the results of [33] with additional
graviton insertions to loop level, resulting for instance
in the two-graviton example (28) in the appendix. Such
amplitude relations take a universal form, irrespective of
the supersymmetries preserved by a or aEYM, and a CHY
derivation will be given in [34]. It would be interesting to
convert the multitrace results of [33] into one-loop contri-
butions to EYM amplitudes with graviton propagators.
CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER DIRECTIONS
In this letter, we have identiﬁed partial integrands as
basic gauge invariant building blocks for one-loop gauge-
theory amplitudes; they arise naturally from the new rep-
resentation of one-loop amplitudes [16, 20], such as (1) of
n-gon integrals, and can be derived using forward limits
of tree amplitudes, or CHY representations [17]. These
partial integrands inherit BCJ relations (5), (6) from
tree level, and similar relations for partial integrands of
one-loop EYM amplitudes (25). Most importantly, they
are suitable for constructing one-loop gravity integrands
through our main result (7), a one-loop generalization of
the KLT formula [1] valid for the gravitational double
copies of a wide range of gauge theories.

5
Furthermore, the notion of partial integrands and their
one-loop BCJ relations directly carry over to NLSM am-
plitudes. Parallel to tree-level case [2, 35], the one-loop
KLT formula with two copies of NLSM gives the one-
loop integrand of special Galileons, and that with NLSM
and (super-)Yang–Mills theory yields integrands of Born–
Infeld theory along with supersymmetric extensions to
Dirac–Born–Infeld–Volkov–Akulov theories [36].
The one-loop KLT formula is manifestly gauge- and
diﬀeomorphism invariant, and it holds regardless of any
particular representation of gauge-theory partial inte-
grands.
Once a gauge-theory amplitude has been ex-
pressed in accordance with the duality between color and
kinematics [9], one can view the formula (7) as reorganiz-
ing the cubic diagrams in the double-copy representations
of [6] into gauge invariant building blocks. In absence of
duality-satisfying representations, however, (7) yields su-
pergravity integrands which have been previously out of
reach. In order to take maximal advantage of the KLT
formula, it remains to systematically develop integration
routines for rearranged loop integrals in mn (see [20] for
an example of four-point one-loop integration relevant to
both partial integrands and Q-cuts). It should be fea-
sible to reinstate the standard propagators quadratic in
the loop momenta through an algorithmic procedure. On
the other hand, it is highly desirable to directly extract
physical information, such as unitarity cuts or ultraviolet
divergences of one-loop amplitudes, from the new repre-
sentation of the integrands.
Although the discussion has been adapted to the one-
loop case, we expect that the notion of partial inte-
grands and their KLT composition to permutation in-
variant gravity integrands extends to any loop order. For
instance, we have identiﬁed all two-loop four-point par-
tial integrands in maximal SYM, obtained from double
forward limits of eight-point tree amplitudes [37]. These
naturally lead to a new proposal for maximal supergrav-
ity integrands through the corresponding KLT formula,
which is similar to that of eight-point trees. We leave it
to future work to verify the proposal and to gather more
evidence for higher loops and multiplicities.

APPENDIX: EYM WITH TWO GRAVITONS
Starting from the relations for single-trace EYM tree am-
plitudes with two gravitons [33], we relabel two gluon legs
(1, n) →(+, −) with momenta k± = ±ℓto obtain

partial integrands (24) for one-loop EYM amplitudes
with two graviton insertions to partial integrands (4) of
gauge-theory amplitudes.

polarizations, including extra-dimensional ones, see [17].
