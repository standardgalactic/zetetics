Preface
This book provides an overview of the idea of behavioral decision theory and
related research ﬁndings. Behavioral decision theory is described brieﬂy as the
general term for descriptive theories to explain the psychological knowledge related
to people’s decision-making behavior. It is called theory, but it is a combination of
various psychological theories, for which no axiomatic systems such as those with
which the utility theory widely used in economics have been established, but it is
often limited to qualitative knowledge. As the studies of H. A. Simon, who won the
Nobel Prize for economics in 1978, and D. Kahneman, who won the prize in 2002
suggest, however, the psychological methodology and knowledge of behavioral
decision theory have been applied widely in such ﬁelds as economics, business
administration, and engineering, and are expected to become useful in the future.
Behavioral decision theory is related closely to behavioral economics and
behavioral ﬁnance, which have been popular in recent years. Behavioral economics
is an attempt to understand actual human economic behavior, and behavioral
ﬁnance studies human behavior in ﬁnancial markets. The research of people’s
decision-making represents an important part also in these ﬁelds, in which various
aspects overlap with the scope of behavioral decision theory.
This book covers a range from classical to relatively recent major studies related
to behavioral decision theory. It comprises six parts––Part I: Behavioral Decision
Theory and the Idea of It (Chap. 1), Part II: Preference Reversal Phenomenon and
Description of the Phenomenon (Chaps. 2, 3, and 4), Part III: Expected Utility
Theory and Counterexamples (Chaps. 5 and 6), Part IV: Decision Making and
Prospect Theory (Chaps. 7 and 8), Part V: The Framing Effect and Its Descriptions
(Chaps. 9 and 10), Part VI: Decision-making Process and Its Theory (Chaps. 11 and
12), and Part VII: Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making
(Chap. 13).
Chapter 1 in Part I describes the relations between the decision-making
phenomenon and behavioral decision theory. Chapter 2 in Part II explains the
phenomenon by which a preference is reversed depending on the mode of making
v

a decision (preference reversal phenomenon), followed by Chap. 3, which
addresses the causes of such preference reversal phenomenon, and Chap. 4,
which presents the model to explain the psychological process of the preference
reversal phenomenon. Subsequently, Chap. 5 in Part III highlights the relation to
expected utility theory, which is often used in economics and psychology.
Chapter 6 presents consideration of the axioms of expected utility theory and the
Allais and Ellsberg Paradoxes. Chapter 7 in Part IV explains the preference paradox
and nonlinear utility theory, particularly the prospect theory that Kahneman and
others proposed. Chapter 8 introduces prospect theory and cumulative prospect
theory, which uses the Choquet integral, and illustrates the decision-making phe-
nomenon that is explainable using this theory. Chapter 9 in Part V introduces the
framing effect, in which the decision-making result varies depending on how
decision-making problems are described, which is followed by Chap. 10 that
presents the theory to explain this framing effect. In Part VI, empirical studies of
decision-making processes are introduced in Chap. 11, along with the theories and
knowledge of neuroeconomics to explain decision-making processes presented
in Chap. 12. Finally in Part VII, theoretical discussions of multiatrribute
decision making are introduced using the possibility theorem and other properties
of decision theory. Chapter 13 presents a critical examination of the psychological
models of multi-attribute decision-making, ﬁndings obtained from them, and ratio-
nal decision-making and considers what constitutes a “good decision.”
Reading this book requires no advanced expertise. Nonetheless, introductory
knowledge of psychology, business administration, and economics and approxi-
mately high school graduate level mathematics should improve a reader’s compre-
hension of the content. In addition, each chapter includes a corresponding
bibliography, which can be referred to when studying more details related to
behavioral decision theory.
The early draft version of this book is based on the series of Japanese articles of
Keizai Seminar (Economic Seminar). Ms. Fukiko Konishi of Nippon Hyoron Sha,
who was responsible for serials of Keizai Seminar, provided me with many helpful
remarks, related even to small details. Dr. Hajimu Ikeda, Union Press suggested that
I should write this book, and provided me with a number of helpful comments for
the English manuscript. Mr. Yutaka Hirachi, and Mr. Yoshio Saito, Springer Japan
also provided me with valuable comments for the manuscript.
The information provided in this book has been used for lectures at Waseda
University, Gakushuin University, Rikkyo University, The University of Tokyo,
Tokyo Institute of Technology, Nagoya University, Kansai University, Osaka
University of Human Sciences, Kobe University, University of Tsukuba, and
Saint Petersburg State University, Russia. Questions and answers exchanged with
students at all of those places have contributed greatly to the compilation of this
book. Particularly I have received highly valuable opinions from graduate students
taking the Takemura Seminar at Waseda University and from researchers in

decision-making studies through usual discussions. Above all, Dr. Yuki Tamari,
Mr. Hajime Murakami, Ms. Junko Takeuchi, Ms. Mariko Shinozuka of Waseda
University, Mr. Shigetaka Ohkubo of Keio University helped with some of the
proofreading and corrections.
Professor Satoshi Fujii at Kyoto University, who has been conducting joint
research on decision making for nearly a decade, also provided me with extremely
informative advice and suggestions on a regular basis. A part of our joint research
is introduced in this book. Professor Hidehiko Takahashi at Kyoto University,
Prof. Takayuki Sakagami, Prof. Toshiko Kikkawa, Mr. Shigetaka Ohkubo at Keio
University, Prof. Kaori Karasawa at the University of Tokyo, Prof. Henry
Montgomery, Prof. Ola Svenson at Stockholm University, Prof. Tommy Ga¨rling
at Gothenburg University, Prof. Marcus Selart at the Norwegian School of
Economics and Business Administration, Prof. Michael Smithson at the Austra-
lian National University, Prof. Yuri Gatanov at Saint Petersburg State University,
Prof. Baruch Fischhoff, Carnegie Mellon University, and Prof. Colin Camerer,
California Institute of Technology have given me useful comments for our joint
research on decision making through daily practice, which also beneﬁtted
this book.
In addition, the research discussions and workshops for experimental Social
Sciences Project (headed by Prof. Tatsuyoshi Saijo at Osaka University)
conducted under a Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research on Priority Areas of
The
Ministry
of
Education,
Culture,
Sports,

and
Technology
(No. 19046007), and for the Prescriptive Social Psychology Project (headed by
Kazuhisa Takemura) conducted under a Grant-in-Aid for Scientiﬁc Research
A (No. 24243061) in which I am currently taking part, have allowed me to
exchange opinions with researchers from various ﬁelds including experimental
psychology, behavioral economics, and experimental economics. I have found
those opportunities to be extremely beneﬁcial. I have been participating in the
20-year-old Cognitive and Statistical Decision Making Research SIG (headed by
Prof. Kazuo Shigemasu at Teikyo University) from its inception. Moreover,
I continue to learn much from researchers in decision-making studies such as
Prof. Yutaka Nakamura of University of Tsukuba, Dr. Yasuaki Kobashi of
Taikasha and Prof. Kimihiko Yamagishi of Tokyo Institute of Technology,
Prof. Kenpei Shiina, Prof. Shuzo Abe, Prof. Mamoru Kaneko, Prof. Tsuyoshi
Moriguchi, Prof. Naoto Onzo, Prof. Kazumi Shimizu, and Prof. Shin-ichi Hirota,
Dr. Yuki Tamari, Mr. Takashi Ideno, of Waseda University, Prof. Tetsuo
Sugimoto of Sophia University, Prof. Mikiya Hayashi of Meisei University, and
Prof. Makoto Abe at The University of Tokyo. In addition, Prof. Tsuyoshi Hatori
of Ehime University has remained supportive of me through daily discussion
related to decision-making research.
I am most appreciative of the guidance and encouragement offered by pre-
decessors such as the late Prof. Sotohiro Kojima (Doshisha University), Prof.
Osamu Takagi (Kansai University), Prof. Kazuo Shigemasu (Teikyo University),

Behavioral Decision Theory
and the Idea of It

Chapter 1
Decision-Making Phenomenon
and Behavioral Decision Theory
This chapter ﬁrst presents the conceptual framework of the decision-making
phenomenon, which is apparently almost universal among decision-making studies
and which explains how decision-making under certainty, risk, and uncertainty can
be understood. Consequently, the way in which behavioral decision theory is
positioned in the study of decision-making and how it is related to other theories
of decision-making are explained.
1
What Is Decision-Making?
Although decision-making broadly refers to the function of consciousness to make
a decision, it can also be deﬁned technically as the act of selecting an alternative
from a group of alternatives, i.e., the choice of action (Takemura 1996). Selecting a
preferred means of transportation, deciding which product to purchase, and deter-
mining which proposal to adopt are examples of decision-making. We make
decisions as consumers about purchasing various goods. At times, we must make
decisions related to corporate activities and political issues.
At this point, we review the decision-making phenomenon using the concept of
aggregation. Let A denote a ﬁnite set of alternatives. Its elements are organized into
mutually exclusive alternatives a1, . . ., ai, . . ., al (l is the number of alternatives),
which can be described as the set A ¼ {a1, . . ., ai, . . ., al} (Although set A can be
assumed as an inﬁnite set, it is considered a ﬁnite set in this case for simpliﬁcation.
The following is also treated as a ﬁnite set to simplify the expressions). The method
of deﬁning a set by enumerating its components in this way is called extensional
deﬁnition. For instance, the elements of A can be interpreted as the alternatives
consisting of stocks invested, which are a1, . . ., ai, . . ., al.
Subsequently, we consider the set of outcomes from choosing these alternatives
as X ¼ {x1, . . ., xj, . . ., xm}. For instance, the elements of X include x1 ¼ a loss of
$10,000, x2 ¼ neither a gain nor a loss, and x3 ¼ a gain of $10,000. When a speciﬁc
alternative ai is adopted, an outcome, xj is expected to appear. However, ai and xj

do not necessarily mutually correspond on a one-to-one basis. In fact, ai and xj
mutually correspond in many cases with some uncertainty. In other words, the
result xj from adopting the alternative ai can be thought to depend at least on
conditions such as the state of nature, as Θ ¼ {θ1, . . ., θk, . . ., θn}. The examples
include θ1 ¼ a decline in interest rates, θ2 ¼ maintenance of the current conditions,
and θ3 ¼ an increase in interest rates. Although, in general, a decrease in interest
rates causes an increase in stock prices, stock price ﬂuctuations vary depending on
the stock. They are also affected by factors other than the level of interest rates. In
this case, however, we simplify the situation and consider that there are various
stocks. We assume that the stock trading conditions are determined by changes in
interest rates, as shown in Table 1.1. Consequently, as presented in Table 1.1, the
result of purchasing a stock is determined by interest rates.
The information presented in Table 1.1 suggests that the outcome is determined
by the function (mapping) from the alternative selected and conditions related to the
outcome, which is
f : A  Θ ! X:
In this case, A  Θ is a Cartesian product representing the set of the possible
combinations of the set A and the set Θ. Although the sign is the same as that for
arithmetic multiplication, the meaning differs. The set is expressed as
A  Θ ¼
ai; θk
ð
Þ
ai ∈A, θk ∈Θ


:
This equation states that the set with elements including all pairs (ai, θk) that
incorporates the order of an arbitrary element ai of set A and an arbitrary element θk
of set Θ is speciﬁed as A  Θ. Such a method of deﬁning the set based on the
properties of the elements of the set is called an intentional deﬁnition. Furthermore,
f : A  Θ ! X
is an expression showing that when the alternative ai and the state θk are speciﬁed,
then one of the results, xj is determined. As described later, in actual decision-
making, which elements in the set of Θ appear and what the elements of the set of Θ
actually are remain uncertain in many cases.

The element of the set of outcomes is money in the case of Table 1.1. It might be
apparent, in general, that the state of no gain and no loss (x2) is preferred to a loss of
$10,000 (x1), and that a gain of $10,000 (x3) is preferred to the state of no gain and
no loss (x2). However, we will intentionally express these relations. Letting A  B
mean “A is preferred to B”, then the preference relations can be expressed as
x3  x2, x2  x1, and x3  x1. The result is simply a state. Cases other than those
that can be expressed with money exist; there might also be peculiar individuals
who would not mind the difference between $10,000 and $11,000. Therefore,
inquiring into the preference relations that are associated with the results is an
important undertaking.
The simplest preference relation is a binary relation for which one of two
alternatives is preferred. We consider the preference relations of a decision-maker
in connection with the elements of the set of the results, X. In other words, we
assume such relations as “which one is preferred” and “both are equally attractive,”

that are empirically observed. We express them using the symbol, ≿. When we
assuming a relation of “which one is preferred”, we express it using symbol .
When the set that has collected all ordered pairs (xi, xj) that become xi ≿xj is R, it
can be expressed as
R ¼
xi; xj

xi ≿xj; xi; xj ∈X

:
This set R forms a subset of the Cartesian product set of the set of results X,
which expresses the binary relation of X. In other words,
R  X  X ¼

holds true.
A set that speciﬁes a set and its relations and other properties is called a relational
system. The set hX, Ri consisting of binary relations on the set, X, is also a relational
system. It is called a preference structure because it is a relational system related to
preference (Ichikawa 1983).
In summary, the ﬁve-tuple including the set of alternatives A, the set of states Θ,
the set of results X, mapping f : A  Θ ! X, and preference structure hX, ≿i can
be regarded as minimally expressing the problem of decision-making that depends
on the state. In the theory of decision-making, this set hA, Θ, X, f, hX, ≿ii is often
expressed as “decision-making problems” (or, sometimes “decision problems under
uncertainty”). In addition, in cases of interactive conditions and social decision-
making that assume multiple decision-makers, if the set of decision-makers is I and
the alternatives, Ai, and preference relations, Ri, vary depending on i ∈I, then the
decision-making problem can be expressed as hA1, A2, . . ., An, Θ, X, f, hX, ≿1i,
hX, ≿2i, . . .,hX, ≿nii (Ichikawa 1983). This example assumes that the alternatives
and preference relations of the decision-makers differ, and that the mapping f to the
state Θ and the set of results X is common among all members. However, the
description of decision-making problems that vary among individuals is also
possible.

Decision-Making and Uncertainty
Although it might be a simple term, decision-making takes various forms.
Decision-making cases are broadly categorized into three groups, as presented in
Fig. 1.1, based on the characteristics of the knowledge of the decision-making
environment, i.e., how much the decision-makers know about their surrounding
environment. The following describes each of the three.
6

Decision-Making Phenomenon and Behavioral Decision Theory

3.1
Decision-Making Under Certainty
The ﬁrst is decision-making under certainty, which is the type of decision-making
in a situation where the result of selecting an alternative is certainly determined. For
instance, a situation to decide whether to use $50 in cash or $60 in gift certiﬁcates
for a purchase is decision-making under certainty. If explained using the expres-
sions with the sets described earlier, then it is the case in which θk of the set of
states, Θ, will occur is already known or the result, xj, is determined solely by the
alternative, ai, irrespective of the condition of θk (even with an arbitrary θk).
Another expression is that it is the case in which mapping, g : A ! X, from the
set of alternatives A to the set of results X exists.
3.2
Decision-Making Under Risk
The second is decision-making under risk. Although risk has broader meanings
such as “danger” and “a loss” in the ﬁeld of psychology and risk analysis (Hirota
et al. 2002), in the context of decision-making research, it refers to a condition
that occurs with known probability as the result of selecting an alternative. We
consider, for example, decision-making as whether to take an umbrella or not.
When the prospects for rain can be expressed as a probability, the decision of
whether to take an umbrella or not constitutes decision-making under risk.
Additionally in this case, although the value of taking an umbrella is high if it
rains, it will be merely inconvenient if it does not rain. In this way, the result of
choosing an alternative can be regarded as depending on conditions such as the
weather.
For organizing decision-making under risk using the expression of sets, we
assume a situation in which a probability distribution is deﬁned on the set of
states Θ. In the case presented earlier, for instance, we assume that the probability

distribution is known to be the probability p(θ1) ¼ 0.3 of a decrease in interest
rates, θ1, the probability p(θ2) ¼ 0.5 of maintaining the current situation, θ2, and
the probability p(θ3) ¼ 0.2 of an increase in interest rates, θ3. Consequently, the
probability of the result X for each alternative ai can be determined as presented
in Table 1.2. The results in Table 1.2 were converted based on results presented
in Table 1.1 based on the probability distribution on Θ. We speciﬁcally address,
for instance, the p33 part in Table 1.2, which is the probability of the result (x3),
which is a gain of $10,000 when Stock 3 is selected. Table 1.1 indicates that this
result occurs when the states θ1 and θ2 take place. Consequently, the probability,
p33, is p(θ1) + p(θ2) ¼ 0.3 + 0.5 ¼ 0.8. Therefore p33 ¼ 0.8, as presented in
Table 1.2.
Consequently, the problem of decision-making under risk, i.e., which element of
the alternative set A is selected, can be replaced with the problem of which of
the probability distribution p1 ¼ [p11, p12, . . ., p1m], p2 ¼ [p21, p22, . . ., p2m], and
pl ¼ [pl1, pl2, . . ., plm] on X is selected. Therefore, decision-making under risk can
be expressed using the preference structure, hP, ≿i, in which the preference
relation, ≿, is added to the set P ¼ {p1, p2, . . ., pl} of probabilities of X.
3.3
Decision-Making Under Uncertainty
Finally, the third group is decision-making under uncertainty. Uncertainty in this
context refers to a state in which the probability of the result of selecting an
alternative is not known. Decision-making under such uncertainty can be
sub-classiﬁed as follows (Takemura 1996). The ﬁrst group is decision-making
under ambiguity. This ambiguity refers to a state in which, although the condition
and results that will occur are known, the probabilities of the condition and results
to occur are unknown.
When expressed as sets, it is a state in which all the elements θi of the state Θ and
the elements xj of set X of the results are already known. However, the probability
distribution on Θ or that on X is unknown. In the earlier example, we assume that
the probability p(θ1) of a decrease in interest rates, θ1, the probability p(θ2) of
maintaining the current condition, θ2, and the probability p(θ3) of an increase in
interest rates, θ3, are all either ambiguously known or unknown. Consequently, the

Decision-Making Phenomenon and Behavioral Decision Theory

probability of the set of the results of adopting the selected alternatives becomes
either ambiguous or unknown, as presented in Table 1.3.
In this case, the probability cannot be expressed in numerical values; instead,
linguistic expressions such as “probably high,” “rather low,” and “moderate” might
be used. In fact, even weather forecast experts who have received natural science
training are found to have the tendency of using language rather than numerical
values to express probabilities (Beyth-Marom 1982). Furthermore, even if uncer-
tainty is expressible in numbers, measures such as probability that do not satisfy
additivity (e.g., measure of possibility and Dempster–Shafer measure) might be
used (Smithson 1989; Takemura 2000).
The second category of decision-making under uncertainty is decision-making
under ignorance when the elements of the set of states or the elements of the set of
results are unknown (Smithson 1989; Smithson et al. 2000), which refers to, for
instance, a state in which the situation and results, and even the possibility of the
results as a consequence of adopting a social policy are unknown. Therefore, when
expressed in sets, the state in which the element θ of the set Θ of states and the
element x of the set X of results are not known.
Decision-making under ignorance includes cases in which the range of alterna-
tives, possible states, and the range of results are not clearly known. Such cases of
decision-making under ignorance occur frequently as exempliﬁed by the various
types of decisions made in an unknown land in the actual society. When the level of
ignorance is high, not only the elements of the set X of results, the set A of
alternatives, and the set Θ of states, but the ignorance of the entire set itself might
also occur. This ignorance can be categorized further depending on which of X, A,
and Θ is unknown. Currently, however, theories that can accommodate such a case
of decision-making under ignorance in which the entire set is unknown are nearly
nonexistent.

As might be evident from the discussion presented above, the same decision-
making takes various forms. What are the theoretical frameworks that could be used
to explain the decision-making phenomenon? Although numerous theories related
to decision-making have been developed, they are, in essence, often broadly
divided into two types: normative theory and descriptive theory (Hirota
et al. 2002; Kobashi 1988; Sayeki 1986). The former is a theory that is intended
to support rational decision-making. It is a platform used to assess a desirable form
of decision-making. The latter is a theory that describes how people actually make
decisions.
Both normative and descriptive theories reﬂect the nature of actual human
decision-making to a degree. Even descriptive theory seeks a certain level of
10

Decision-Making Phenomenon and Behavioral Decision Theory

rationality in actual human decision-making. Consequently, the two are mutually
indistinguishable. Nonetheless, a major example of normative theory is regarded as
the system of utility theory that is widely used in economics. A salient example of
descriptive theory is probably behavioral decision theory. Utility theory has numer-
ous variations. Most theories have established axioms and mathematically devel-
oped principles (Edwards 1992; Fishburn 1988; Barbera´ et al. 1998). In contrast,
behavioral decision theory covers a considerably wide range of variations of
theoretical expressions, including theories that have been developed mathemati-
cally and those expressed only with natural language (Edwards 1961; Hirota
et al. 2002; Poulton 1994; Sayeki 1986; Takemura 1996; Wright 1985).
In the study of decision-making, the study of normative theory has traditionally
preceded the other. A comparison between theoretical and actual human decision-
making activities has engendered the research of behavioral decision theory, which
is a descriptive study of theories (Kobashi 1988). When asked who the founder of
behavioral decision theory is, many people might think of Simon or Kahneman:
psychologists who were awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. However,
W. Edwards actually originated the theory (Sayeki 1986). He began his psycholog-
ical research in 1948 (http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/psychology/people/edwards.
html) and had written a review article entitled Behavioral Decision Theory already
in 1961 (Edwards 1961).
The study of behavioral decision theory has traditionally been conducted in the
ﬁeld of psychology. The methodology particularly can be regarded as having been
developed by mathematical psychologists and experimental psychologists who are
divided according to research ﬁelds into cognitive psychologists and social psy-
chologists. Some ﬁelds of study are affected by behavioral decision theory. They
have become more popular in recent years, including ﬁelds such as behavioral
economics (e.g., Tada 2003; Camerer et al. 2004) and behavioral ﬁnance (e.g.,
Goldberg and von Nitzsch 2001). Additionally, recent years have shown a trend of
adopting certain characteristics of descriptive theory into normative theory as
opposed to a one-sided relation in which normative theory studies precede descrip-
tive theory studies (Camerer et al. 2004; Edwards 1992; Fishburn 1988).
Finally, an approach called a prescriptive approach exists as the third one after
normative theory and descriptive theory (Bell et al. 1988). The term “prescriptive”
is derived from prescriptions issued by physicians. The prescriptive approach aims
to support rational decision-making according to the actual conditions of problems.
In actual decision-making problems such as social consensus-building and man-
agement decision-making, strict normative theory cannot be established in some
cases because of uncertainty including ambiguity and ignorance, rendering the
approach using normative theory unfeasible. Sole dependence on description, as
the descriptive theory espouses, might not engender problem-solving. Accordingly,
this approach is extremely important considering the support for decision-making
in solving real problems. The knowledge of behavioral decision theory that
describes how people make decisions in reality is expected to facilitate the adoption
of this approach considerably.

Behavioral Decision Theory and Psychologists
The answer to the question of whether behavioral decision theory is a major
part of the ﬁeld of psychology is that it is slightly less dominant than clinical
psychology and other ﬁelds of experimental psychology. If asked whether the
founders of the theory, Edwards, Simon, and Kahneman, are very well-known
psychologists among others, the answer is that, actually, they are not: clinical
psychologists tend to be interested in such matters as abnormal psychology
and personality; experimental psychologists tend to examine detailed exper-
imental techniques more speciﬁcally. Moreover, the fact that, unlike eco-
nomics, many psychologists are traditionally interested in the results of
experiments and research rather than theory might be somehow relevant.
In recent years, however, research of behavioral decision theory has
become increasingly popular in the U.S. and Europe. Academic conferences
related to behavioral decision theory include the European Association for
Decision Making (EADM: http://eadm.eu/) in Europe and the Society for
Judgment and Decision Making (SJDM: http://www.sjdm.org/) in the
U.S. Both consist principally of psychologists. Although no academic con-
ferences for behavioral decision theory exist in Japan, a study group called
the Cognitive and Statistical Decision Making Research SIG, whose regular
meetings (research paper presentations) are held a few times a year at the
University of Tokyo, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Waseda University
on a rotating basis (representative, Kazuo Shigemasu; managers, Kimihiko
Yamagishi and the author). Announcements of regular meetings and other
information are posted on the website of Dr. Yasuaki Kobashi (http://
homepage3.nifty.com/hiway/dm/d-conts.htm). Any interested person might
participate in the meetings (no particular restrictions on participation apply).
In addition, this website introduces documents related to behavioral decision
theory, which might be used as a reference by readers who are interested in
behavioral decision-making theory.

Preference Reversal Phenomenon
and Description of the Phenomenon

Chapter 2
Ordinal Utility and Preference Reversal
Phenomenon
Chapter 1 described that decision-making phenomena are broadly divisible into
those under certainty, those under risk, and others under uncertainty. This chapter
ﬁrst introduces the concept of utility used to explain such decision-making phe-
nomena and brieﬂy presents the idea of traditional ordinal utility theory.
Ordinal utility theory is assumed in many theories in economics. However, it
includes some phenomena that constitute counterexamples that cannot be justiﬁed
from the perspective of behavioral decision theory. Among such cases, this chapter
presents speciﬁc examination of a case in which the transitivity premised on ordinal
utility is not satisﬁed, and presents a phenomenon known as preference reversal.
Transitivity refers to a relation between two alternatives, which is a consistent
attribute of preference relation that, for instance, if oranges are preferred to bananas
and apples are preferred to oranges, then apples are preferred to bananas. In
addition, preference reversal is regarded as a phenomenon that deviates from the
procedural invariance that preference cannot be reversed by the preference revela-
tion procedures. In this type of case, for instance, when making a purchase decision,
although Brand A is said to be more desirable than Brand B when their values (e.g.,
the prices considered reasonable) are assessed independently, Brand B is chosen if
the two are actually compared.

What Is Utility?
Utility is interpreted in daily usage as the subjective value or desirability of a result
of selecting an alternative. In decision-making theory, it is often technically con-
sidered a real-valued function to express a preference relation; it is therefore
sometimes called a utility function. Utility is considered in terms of real numbers
because the mathematical analysis of a decision-making phenomenon provides the
beneﬁt of facilitating the prediction and explanation of the phenomenon. Expres-
sions using utility are also used in decision-aid based on technologies using
computers and other tools that are designed to support decisions with which

decision-makers can be satisﬁed. Such technologies have yielded practical
advances (Kobashi 1988).
The following presents some simple examples of utility. We consider a case of
decision-making under certainty, in which a product––either Brand A or Brand B––
is to be selected. In this case, utility refers to the relative preference for Brand A to
Brand B (Brand A ≿Brand B). Only in such a case is the real number that the utility
of Brand A (u(Brand A)) higher than the utility of Brand B (u(Brand B)). In other
words, when a relation
u Brand A
ð
Þ  u Brand B
ð
Þ , Brand A ≿Brand B:
holds true, then the preference relation is expressed with a utility function u.
Particularly, the type of utility that maintains only the order of preference is called
ordinal utility. Ordinal utility does not lose its fundamental meaning even if
monotonic increasing conversion of its utility function is performed; it corresponds
to the ordinal scale used in psychology and statistics. For instance, if u represents
ordinal utility, then the preference relation is maintained even if, for example,
u(Brand A) ¼ 5 and u(Brand B) ¼ 2 are changed to ϕ(u(Brand A)) ¼ 8
and
ϕ(u(Brand B)) ¼ 3 using the function ϕ that increases the values monotonically.
The following expresses ordinal utility slightly more formally. Assuming that
Set A of alternatives is ﬁnite nonempty and that the preference structure ⟨A, ≿⟩is a
weak order, then the preference structure refers to the set that combines the set of
alternatives and a preference relation ≿of some kind. The weak order in this case
represents the relation in which the following two conditions hold:
1. Comparability 8 x, y 2 A, x ≿y _ y ≿x.
In other words, this is such a relation in which x, y (8 x, y 2 A), x ≿y, or y ≿x
of Set A of alternatives exists. In this case, the symbol _ is a logical symbol for
“or,” which means that at least one of them holds true. Comparability is also
called connectedness or completeness. For instance, if the set of brands consid-
ered is A and x ≿y is interpreted as a relation by which y (Brand y) is preferred
to x (Brand x) or is interpreted as indifference, then this is a case that can be
determined as one in which Brand x is preferred to Brand y or indifference or one
in which Brand y is preferred to Brand x or indifference. A situation for which it
is unknown “which one is preferred, or whether the chooser is indifferent” does
not satisfy comparability.
2. Transitivity 8 x, y, z 2 A, x ≿y ^ y ≿z ) x ≿z.
In other words, this is a relation in which, if x ≿y and y ≿z, x ≿z holds for the
arbitrary elements x, y, z (8 x, y, z 2 A) of A. In this case, the symbol ^
represents a logical symbol for “and,” which means that both relations hold
true. For instance, if A is a set of alternatives of product brands just as in the
example presented above and x ≿y is interpreted, then the transitivity is satis-
ﬁed if there is a relation by which Brand x is preferred to Brand z or indifference
when Brand x is preferred to Brand y or indifference or Brand y is preferred to
Brand z or indifference.

Ordinal Utility and Preference Reversal Phenomenon

If transitivity does not hold, it is a three-cornered deadlock relation. For
instance, if the power relation of rock–paper–scissors is , then rock  scissors
and scissors  paper, but not rock  paper. Consequently,  does not satisfy
transitivity.
We know that the following theorem holds for the weak order that satisﬁes these
two characteristics (Krantz et al. 1971).
The theorem related to a weak order on a ﬁnite set (Krantz et al. 1971)
If a preference structure of a ﬁnite nonempty set A, ⟨A, ≿⟩, is a weak order, then
there exists a real-valued function (ordinal utility function) u : A ! Re on A such
that for all x, y 2 A,
x ≿y , u x
ð Þ  u y
ð Þ:
In other words, this theorem means that if the preference such as a weak order is
being made, then it can be expressed with a function that takes real numbers that
maintain the preference relation. Therefore, it indicates that the preference relation
of a qualitative weak order can be examined by quantifying it using ordinal utility.
Although this theorem is based on a ﬁnite set in this case, we know that it also
applies to a countably inﬁnite set and further to an uncountably inﬁnite set with
certain conditions added (Krantz et al. 1971).
In addition, the following theorem holds for ordinal utility (Krantz et al. 1971).
The theorem related to weak order uniqueness on a ﬁnite set (Krantz et al. 1971)
If the preference structure ⟨A, ≿⟩on a ﬁnite nonempty set A is a weak order, then
⟨A, ≿⟩is expressed as ⟨Re, ⟩through the real-valued function u : A ! Re of
A indicated in the theorem above; the structure ⟨⟨A, ≿⟩, ⟨Re, ⟩, u⟩becomes an
ordinal scale.
Although this theorem assumes a ﬁnite set, we know that it applies also to
countably and uncountably inﬁnite sets (Krantz et al. 1971).
Aside from ordinal utility, cardinal utility, which is often used in economics, is a
type of utility that does not lose its fundamental meaning even with an interval
scale, i.e., positive linear transformation (a linear transformation of multiplication
by a constant and adding with a constant), as used in psychology and statistics.

Tversky (1969) used experiments to examine whether the transitivity assumed
by weak orders was satisﬁed in decision-making. He presented two cards with a pie
chart test to subjects as presented in Fig. 2.1. He then asked the subjects which
gamble they would prefer. The respondents were not allowed to express an indif-
ferent preference relation. They were requested to indicate which was preferred.
Therefore, this choice indicates a strong preference relation x  y, i.e., x ≿y ^ not
(y ≿x) (where ≿is a weak order). The cards had the amount of prize money
written above the pie charts. The percentage of the area of the black sector in the
circle was presented as the winning percentage.
Although multiple patterns were prepared in the experiment, the typical pattern
was that two of ﬁve cards as in Table 2.1 were combined and the respondents were
asked which one they would prefer. The winning percentage rose and the amount of
prize money decreased while moving from a to e. In the case of comparative
judgments such as those between a and b and between b and c, a slight difference
in the winning percentages was ignored and the graph showing a larger prize tended
to be selected. In contrast, for a combination with a signiﬁcant difference in the
winning percentages such as a and e, then e, the choice with a higher winning
percentage, tended to be preferred. This tendency illustrates a relation of a  b,
b  c, c  d, d  e, e  a, which demonstrably does not satisfy transitivity.
Tversky (1969) also presented the percentile rank points from the assessment of
the intelligence, emotional stability, and sociability of ﬁve college applicants, as in
Table 2.2, to test subjects. He had them answer which applicant should be admitted

to a college based on a paired comparison with the priority on their intelligence. For
a comparative judgment such as those between a and b and between b and c, a slight
difference in the intelligence assessment was ignored and other factors with a better
assessment tended to be selected. In contrast, for a combination with a signiﬁcant
difference in the intelligence assessment such as a and e, then e, with a better
intelligence assessment, tended to be preferred. This result also indicates a relation
of a  b, b  c, c  d, d  e, e  a, which clearly does not satisfy transitivity.
Tversky (1969) proposed a mathematical model called the additive difference
model to explain such preferences that do not satisfy the transitivity. This model
ﬁrst posits that a set of alternatives consists of multiple attributes A ¼ A1  A2 
. . .  Am as shown in Table 2.2. Additionally, each alternative is regarded as
comprising the values of multiple attributes such as x ¼ (x1, x2, . . ., xn) and
y ¼ (y1, y2, . . ., yn). The additive difference model is expressed as follows using
u1 as a real-valued function and ϕi as an increasing function.

where ϕi(δi) ¼  ϕi(δi), δi ¼ ui(xi)  ui(yi) for an arbitrary attribute, i.

which produces an additive utility model. Although non-transitivity cannot be
explained when ϕi can be assumed with such linearity, if ϕi is a step function
with a threshold (e.g., if ε  δ, then ϕi(δi) ¼ 0 where ε is a threshold of ϕi), then
this additive difference model can explain non-transitivity.

Does a Weak Order Empirically Hold?
21

Nakamura (1992) conducted an experimental examination of the conditions that
deviated from the transitivity. Results suggest the following: (1) In the case of a
preference judgment based on a single attribute, the judgment was clariﬁed, even if
the difference in the utility was small. (2) When the utility of two or more attributes
was traded off and the difference was slight, the judgment would be ambiguous.
(3) If the utility of a certain attribute could be considered equivalent while the utility
of other attributes might not be deemed equivalent, then the effect of the attribute
that is probably equivalent would be neglected. In an effort to explain the
non-transitivity of people’s preferences, he proposed a preference model termed
the additive fuzzy utility difference structure model, which assumes utility as a set
with an ambiguous boundary: a fuzzy set.
The fact that the transitivity in a weak order would not always hold has been
described. Based on experience, comparability is unlikely to hold at all times, as
well. For example, inadequate knowledge of product brands would make it difﬁcult
to present a preference relation that would satisfy comparability in all cases.
Furthermore, the study by Tversky (1969) forced test subjects to choose between
two alternatives. In reality, however, selecting one from two might be difﬁcult in
some cases. Takemura (2007, 2012) expanded the model of Nakamura (1992) and
the analytical techniques of Takemura (2000, 2005) and proposed a model that
included the weight utility function and attempted to express, approximately, the
preference relation that did not satisfy the transitivity.

Preference Reversal Phenomenon
Concepts similar to decision-making include the concept of judgment. Although
decision-making is the act of selecting one from a group of alternatives, judgment is
deﬁnable as the act of specifying the subject to a particular position in an assess-
ment continuum. Judgment includes, for instance, assessing the risk of a trafﬁc
accident with a probability between zero and one and rating the desirability of a
result on a scale of seven or nine levels of “not desirable at all” to “very desirable.”
Another example of judgment is pricing the value of alternatives in product brands.
According to common reasoning, judgment and decision-making differ only in the
patterns of reactions. They are expected to reﬂect preference and assessment in the
same direction. As a result of judgment, for example, if the assessed value of an
alternative x is found to be higher than that of an alternative y, then a relation by
which x is likely to be chosen over y can be expected as a result of decision-making.
A situation in which alternative y is likely to be chosen over alternative x in
decision-making despite the higher assessed value of alternative x than that of
alternative y in judgment is improbable based on common reasoning.
In general, utility theory implicitly assumes that the preference ranking relations
of the assessed subjects are maintained even if many different methods are used.
This assumption is apparently self-evident considering the measurement of the
physical quantity. In other words, when weighing each of two ﬁsh that have been
22
2
Ordinal Utility and Preference Reversal Phenomenon

caught, for example, whether comparing their weights on a balance or measuring
their weights in grams, there is expected to be little difference in the order relation
as to which ﬁsh is heavier, even if the scales lack accuracy to some degree.
However, psychological studies conducted in the past suggest that preference
order based on judgment and preference order based on decision-making are not
necessarily the same and might be reversed in some cases. This phenomenon in
which the preference order is reversed because of the difference between the
reactions to judgment and decision-making is called the preference reversal phe-
nomenon. This phenomenon was reported ﬁrst by psychologists such as Lindman
(1971) and Lichtenstein and Slovic (1971) as a phenomenon of preference relation
inconsistency attributable to the methods of selection and pricing in gambles. The
selection problem of these studies necessitated that test subjects choose between
Gamble H, with a high winning percentage and a small amount of prize money
(e.g., the winning percentage is 8/9 and a prize is $4) and Gamble L, with a low
winning percentage and a large amount of prize money (e.g., the winning percent-
age 1/9 and a prize is $40). The pricing question asked the lowest probable prices at
which Gamble H and Gamble L could be sold if the respondents owned them. In
most cases, Gamble H was preferred in the selection problem and Gamble L was
priced higher than the other in the pricing question (Tversky and Thaler 1990).
Although many economists were skeptical about this preference reversal phenom-
enon initially, experimental economists repeatedly discovered effects that led to the
recognition that this phenomenon certainly existed. The existence of this phenom-
enon implies that the type of reaction associated with judgment and decision-
making affects the preference order rather than a phenomenon by which each result
of judgment and decision-making is simply expressing a certain preference pattern
(Tversky et al. 1988).
Tversky et al. (1988) examined other types of preference reversals in decision-
making under certainty. In a study, the experimenter gave the following instructions
to test subjects under each set of conditions.
Conditions for the selection problem: “In Israel, 600 people die in trafﬁc accidents
every year. The Ministry of Transport studied various measures to reduce the
victims of trafﬁc accidents. Please consider the following two proposed measures.
The annual cost and the number of victims as a result of adopting each of the
proposed measures are shown (Table 2.3). Which proposal would you adopt?”
Conditions for the matching problem: In the matching problem, a table resembling
Table 2.4 with missing sections was presented to the test subjects, who were asked
to deduce the missing information so that Proposed Measure X and Proposed
Measure Y would become equivalent.

Preference Reversal Phenomenon

Accepting the assumption that a decrease in the casualties in trafﬁc accidents and
a low cost of measures are desirable allows the prediction of the results of the
selection problem based on the results of the matching problem. We assume, for
example, that a test subject has estimated $40 million in the matching problem.
Therefore, the proﬁle of Proposed Measure X (500 victims and $40 million) and the
proﬁle of Proposed Measure Y (570 victims and $12 million) are equivalent. Based
on the assumption, the proﬁle of Proposed Measure X (500 victims and $40 million)
and the proﬁle of Proposed Measure Y (570 victims and $12 million) are superior to
the proﬁle of Proposed Measure X (500 victims and $55 million) in the selection
problem. Based on such reasoning, Proposed Measure Y is predicted to be selected
from the results of the matching problem.
Nonetheless, Tversky et al. (1988) found that most test subjects would select
Proposed Measure X in the selection problem and that most would prefer Proposed
Measure Y in the matching problem. Such a preference reversal phenomenon has
been identiﬁed in personal and social decision-making processes and also in risk
judgment and other situations (Grether and Plott 1979; Lindman 1971; Lichtenstein
and Slovic 1971; Slovic 1995; Slovic et al. 1990; Starmer 2000; Tversky et al. 1988;
Takemura 1994, 1996).
The following Chap. 3 will describe the causes of this preference reversal
phenomenon and models to explain its occurrence.

Chapter 3
Causes of Preference Reversal Phenomenon
Chapter 2 provided descriptions of preference reversal phenomenon. This
phenomenon was reported ﬁrst by psychologists such as Lindman (1971) and
Lichtenstein and Slovic (Slovic and Lichtenstein 1968; Lichtenstein and Slovic
1971) as the phenomenon of preference relation inconsistency that results from the
methods of selection and pricing in gambles. The selection problem of these studies
had the test subjects choose between Gamble H with a high winning percentage and
a small amount of prize money (i.e., the winning percentage is 28/36 and the prize is
$10) and Gamble L with a low winning percentage and a large amount of prize
money (i.e., the winning percentage 3/36 and the prize is $100). The pricing
question asked how much the lowest probable price at which Gamble H and
Gamble L could be sold if the respondents owned them. In most cases, Gamble
H was preferred in the selection problem and Gamble L was priced higher than the
others in the pricing question (Slovic and Lichtenstein 1983; Slovic 1995; Tversky
and Thaler 1990).
According to Tversky et al. (1990), this preference reversal phenomenon is
divisible into three phases. The ﬁrst is the phase of the discovery of this phenom-
enon by psychologists that occurred between the end of the 1960s and the beginning
of the 1970s (e.g., Lindman 1971; Slovic and Lichtenstein 1968; Lichtenstein and
Slovic 1971). The second was the phase of follow-up research conducted by
economists between the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s, which
led to the discovery that the preference reversal phenomenon was ﬁrmly present
even if the monetary incentive was manipulated (e.g., Grether and Plott 1979).
Subsequently, the third was the phase of theoretical studies designed to reveal the
causes of the preference reversal phenomenon that began increasing in the 1980s
(e.g., Loomes and Sugden 1989; Tversky et al. 1990). Studies designed to ﬁnd the
causes of the preference reversal phenomenon continue today in the ﬁelds of
psychology and economics (Takemura 1996; Starmer 2000; Cubitt et al. 2004).
This chapter introduces major studies that have sought the causes of the preference
reversal phenomenon and characterizes this decision-making phenomenon.

Summary of the Preference Reversal Phenomenon
Researchers have long argued about the manner in which the preference reversal
phenomenon can be theoretically positioned and what the causes of this phenom-
enon are. These arguments are made through articles in economics magazines such
as Econometrica and the American Economic Review. Various positions are
adopted to interpret the preference reversal phenomenon. However, they is divisible
broadly into an interpretation that this phenomenon can be described as a deviation
from “transitivity,” which assumes that no recurrence relation such as a three-
cornered deadlock relation can occur in the preference relation, and an interpreta-
tion that transitivity is not necessary.
In an attempt to explain this, we will reorganize the preference reversal phe-
nomenon and express it symbolically.
First, we assume that CH and CL are the monetary values (the lowest prices at
which the seller is willing to sell) of Gambles H and L, respectively, that have been
deﬁned in advance. Subsequently,  is assumed to be a strong preference relation.
A strong preference relation is a relation by which something is preferred to others.
It is such a relation by which, if the weak order relation, in which transitivity and
comparability hold, is ≿and a set of alternatives is Set A, then x ≿y holds for the
arbitrary elements, x and y, of Set A, but y ≿x does not hold. In other words, this
relation is expressed in symbols as follows.
8x, y ∈A, x ≿y ^ not y ≿x
ð
Þ:
Furthermore,  is assumed to be an indifference relation. An indifference
relation is one in which something is liked about equally to some other thing. It is
such a relation that if the weak order relation is ≿, and the set of alternatives is
Set A; then both x ≿y and y ≿x hold for the arbitrary elements x and y of Set A.
In other words, this relation is expressed symbolically as
8x, y ∈A, x ≿y ^ y ≿x:
A standard preference reversal phenomenon represents a relation by which H is
preferred to L more strongly (a strong preference relation holds) and CL is greater
than CH. This relation can be expressed symbolically as shown below.
H  L ^ CL > CH:
In addition, this case evidently assumes that a higher monetary value (higher
price) is preferred. Consequently, it is assumed that if X > Y holds for arbitrary
monetary values, X and Y, X  Y holds. Although a standard decision-making
theory such as expected utility theory commonly used in economics assumes
H  L ^ CL > CH, the preference relation in the selection and pricing is reversed
in the preference reversal phenomenon.

Explanation Based on Regret Theory That Assumes
Non-transitivity
An example of major theories representing attempts to explain this preference
reversal phenomenon using non-transitivity (Tversky 1969) is regret theory. This
theory was proposed simultaneously by Bell (1982), Fishburn (1982), and Loomes
and Sugden (1982). Among them, the studies that attempted to explain this theory
by its application to the preference reversal phenomenon are Loomes and Sugden
(1983, 1989). Their explanation (Loomes and Sugden 1989; Loomes et al. 1991) of
the preference reversal phenomenon based on regret theory is described below.
First, they considered the case of decision-making under risk and deﬁned the set
of states as S and the state of n units of the elements of the set as s1, s2, . . ., sn
(Loomes and Sugden 1989). The results of each of the states when a certain
alternative i was adopted was deﬁned as x ¼ (xi1, xi2, . . ., xin). Additionally, the
probability of the state sj to occur would be pj, and ∑n
j¼1pj ¼ 1 was assumed.
The psychological assumption underlying regret theory is that, in a paired
comparison of alternatives xi and xk, the decision-maker evaluates the alternatives
not only from the results experienced in all states in S, but also from the relative
relations with xi and xk.
The paired comparison model of alternatives xi and xk can be expressed as
presented below.

Therein, ψ(xij, xkj) represents the proﬁt from selecting xi over xk with a real-
valued function. Assuming that this represents skew-symmetry, then ψ(xij, xkj) ¼
 ψ(xkj, xij) is inferred. Based on this, ψ(xij, xij) ¼ 0 is found to hold for
arbitrary xij.
Furthermore, they assumed the following characteristics, which indicate regret
aversion as an attribute of this function ψ. Consequently, there are results, y1, y2,
and y3, of arbitrary money and the following relation holds when y3 > y2 > y1.

The greater the difference in the results becomes, the better the assessment.
For that reason, the relation of this regret aversion expresses the urge of a person to
avoid regretting that “the other alternative should have been selected” in advance.
On the premise of such an assumption of regret theory, the following explains
the preference reversal phenomenon based on the composition of the alternatives
presented in Table 3.1. The four lines, p1, p2, p3, and p4 in Table 3.1 represent the

probability of each state to occur. The monetary result is assumed to be a > b >
c > d, e. Alternative C (x3 in Table 3.1) produces the same result in any of the state
that occurs, constituting a deﬁnite alternative. If p1 + p3 > 0.5 > p1 + p2 then
alternative L (x3 in Table 3.1) can be interpreted as Gamble L with a low winning
percentage and a large amount of prize money that is adopted in the preference
reversal phenomenon, and alternative H (x2 in Table 3.1) can be interpreted as
Gamble H with a high winning percentage and a small amount of prize money.
According to Loomes and Sugden (1989), the preference reversal phenomenon
represents non-transitivity that is H  L, L  C, and C  H. Therefore, the
relation described below holds true based on Table 3.1 and the assumptions.
In fact, they assumed that the preference relation would be a weak order even
if the selection ranking was a strong preference relation and distinguished between
the selection ranking and conjectured preference relations. This study, however,
introduces both as equivalent to simpliﬁcation of the explanation.

that p2 ¼ 0 and d  e would facilitate a simpler explanation of the preference
reversal phenomenon. Table 3.1 apparently shows that such assumption would not
change the qualitative attributes such as Gamble H, Gamble L, a deﬁnite alternative
C. With this assumption in place, the ﬁrst, third, and fourth terms are positive––only
the second term is zero––making the value of the equation a positive number.
In this case, even if non-transitivity were to be established, non-transitivity
patterns such as L  H, H  C, and C  L could not occur from the assumptions
of regret theory.
That earlier study presented various gambles that could be Gamble L and
Gamble H in the preference reversal phenomenon shown in Table 3.2 and used
them to conduct three experiments (Loomes and Sugden 1989). Experiment 1 used
283 subjects who were undergraduate and postgraduate students, Experiment
2 used 120 subjects, and Experiment 3 used 186 subjects. Experiment 1 found
29 subjects who indicated non-transitivity, of which 26 indicated non-transitivity,
which was consistent with the predictions of regret theory. The other three
displayed inconsistency with such predictions. Experiment 2 revealed 29 subjects
demonstrating non-transitivity, of which 23 revealed non-transitivity consistent
with the predictions of regret theory. The other six displayed inconsistency. In
Experiment 3, half of the test subjects took selection problems only and the other
half took a normal test of pricing. The presence of preference reversals can only be
conﬁrmed through normal tests. Of 93 subjects, 43 showed preference reversals, of
which 28 revealed the preference reversal phenomenon that was in the predicted
direction and 15 in the opposite direction. Non-transitivity was demonstrated by
18 subjects in the selection problems and by an estimated 17.75 subjects in the
normal tests. Furthermore, 14 subjects were found to show behavior consistent with
the predicted direction in the selection problems; an estimated 11.75 subjects were
consistent in the normal tests. They demonstrated the validity of regret theory,
maintaining that, of the non-transitivity patterns, the statistical tests had found a
signiﬁcant number of results predicted from regret theory. They additionally
performed similar analysis in another experimental study (Loomes et al. 1991)
and claimed the effectiveness of regret theory in explaining the preference reversal
phenomenon.

Explanation Based on a “Deviation from Procedural
Invariance” That Does Not Assume Non-transitivity
Although the regret theory of Loomes and Sugden explained the preference reversal
phenomenon using the non-transitivity of preference relations, others have argued
that non-transitivity is not necessary for the preference reversal phenomenon. This
point is asserted particularly by a research group of psychologists including
Tversky et al. (1990). Tversky et al. have claimed that although the explanation
based on regret theory was certainly consistent with the direction of non-transitivity
indicated by the test subjects, the subjects who displayed non-transitivity were few
to begin with, comprising merely 10 % of the subjects who displayed preference
reversals in the results of the analysis of the experiments conducted by them. The
other 90 % did not demonstrate non-transitivity. They also pointed out that the test
subjects indicating non-transitivity in the experiments of Loomes et al. comprised
only 15–20 % of all subjects and argued that the preference reversal phenomenon
could be more appropriately interpreted as rather than non-transitivity, a phenom-
enon that deviated from “procedural invariance,” in which the preference relation
was presumably maintained even if different procedures of preference revelation
were used.
Tversky et al. claimed that the following relation holds in the standard prefer-
ence reversal phenomenon.
H  L ^ CL > X > CH:
Therein, X is the amount of money between CL and CH. They also stated that the
following four preference patterns might logically exist without the assumption of
equally ranked subjects.
1. Non-transitivity: A case in which L  X and X  H hold and result in
L  X  H  L.
2. Overpricing of L: A case in which X  H and X  L hold and result in
CL  X  L.
3. Underpricing of H: A case in which H  X and L  X hold and result in
H  X  CH.
4. Concurrence of overpricing of L and underpricing of H: A case in which H  X
and X  L hold and result in H  X  CH and CL  X  L.
They performed a preference reversal experiment on 198 men and women who
had been gathered through an advertisement on college bulletins for estimating
these conceivable patterns (Experiment 1). All 620 reactions in the experiment
were categorized into the four patterns described above, which is presented in
Table 3.3. The results reveal that the number of cases that were explainable with
non-transitivity is small (10.0 %), many of which resulted from overpricing of
Gamble L with a low winning percentage and a large amount of prize money (only
the overpricing of L is 65.5 %, which totals 83.9 % when combined with the
32
3
Causes of Preference Reversal Phenomenon

concurrence of underpricing of H). These results suggest also that the preference
reversal phenomenon should be understood as a deviation from procedural invari-
ance rather than as non-transitivity.
The preference reversal phenomenon is explainable even without the assumption
of non-transitivity of preference when viewed from a deviation from an axiom of
expected utility theory called the independence axiom in utility theory (Holt 1986;
Karni and Safra 1987) or a deviation from the reduction axiom (Segal 1988). It can
also be explained consistently based on nonlinear utility theory, which is an
extension of expected utility theory. According to the opinions related to these
positions, the preference reversal phenomenon is explainable consistently simply
by eliminating the independence axiom or reduction axiom from expected utility
theory even without the procedural invariance assumed by Tversky et al. (1990) or
non-transitivity assumed by Loomes and Sugden (1989).
If x  y holds for arbitrary results x, y, z ∈A, then the independence axiom
means px(1  p)z  py + (1  p)z for arbitrary p ∈[0,1]. In other words,
assuming that the independence axiom is appropriate, this represents that the
decision-maker’s entire preference relation depends only on preference relations
with x and y and is independent from the probability of obtaining z that commonly
exists. Additionally, the reduction axiom is an axiom that demands that a compound
lottery or compound gamble be reduced to a simple lottery or gamble to be treated.
In other words, in the reduction axiom, if Lottery or Gamble G, from which
Result x is obtainable with Probability p and Result y is obtainable with Probability
1  p, are further combined and Gamble G is obtainable with Probability q and
Result y is obtainable with Probability 1  q, such a compound lottery or com-
pound gamble is demanded to be indifferent from a simple lottery or simple
gamble, from which Result x is gained with Probability pq and Result y is achieved
with Probability 1  pq.
Researchers who attempt to explain the preference reversal phenomenon using
deviations from such independence axiom or reduction axiom have not conducted
particular experiments, but have merely presented theoretical possibilities.
In the experiment results of Tversky et al. (1990), however, 90 % of the data
showed a deviation from procedural invariance. They argued that neither a
deviation from the independence axiom nor a deviation from the reduction
axiom would constitute the necessary or sufﬁcient conditions to explain the
preference reversal phenomenon.

Consequently, Tversky et al. (1990) states that the preference reversal
phenomenon can be interpreted as a deviation from procedural invariance, which
results from overpricing of Gamble L. Why, then, is Gamble L overvalued in the
pricing? The next chapter presents a description of the psychological interpretation
of this phenomenon and the contingent-weighting model (Tversky et al. 1988;
Slovic et al. 1990; Takemura 1994) that supports the interpretation and introduces
some decision-making phenomena related to this psychological process.

Chapter 4
Psychology of Preference Reversals
and Prominence Hypothesis
Chapter 3 introduced the experimental research of Tversky et al. (1990), arguing
that the preference reversal phenomenon can be interpreted as a deviation from
procedural invariance. A deviation from procedural invariance refers to a trait by
which preference is reversed by preference revelation procedures. Tversky
et al. asserted that the preference reversal phenomenon was explainable by partial
modiﬁcation of expected utility theory such as transitivity and independence axiom.
This chapter will describe the prominence hypothesis as a psychological interpre-
tation of this phenomenon and the contingent-weighting model (Tversky
et al. 1988; Slovic et al. 1990) of the speciﬁc representation of the hypothesis and
introduce some experiments related to the model.
1
Prominence Hypothesis and Preference Reversal
Phenomenon
Tversky et al. (1988) developed the contingent weighting model to explain the
preference-reversal phenomenon. This model was built on the assumption of the
prominence hypothesis. The prominence hypothesis assumes that attributes that
are more noticeable are weighted in selection problems rather than pricing prob-
lems, and more lexicographic decisions are made.
Lexicographic decision-making refers to a method of evaluating alternatives in
which the alternatives with the most desirable attribute values among the attributes
that are emphasized the most are the most highly regarded. If some attributes are
equally ranked among the most examined attributes, they are compared similarly
among the next most examined attributes. According to their contingent weighting
model, the decision-maker does not determine the preference order in a strict
sense lexicographically (i.e., not the lexicographic order in a strict sense). Rather,
the model includes the assumption that decisions are made in a form resembling the

lexicographic order in which prominent attributes are weighted more heavily in the
selection problems.
In an attempt to explain this prominence hypothesis, we assume a situation in
which a college graduate selects her place of employment following the examina-
tion of Tversky et al. (1988).
Kaori, a college student, has decided after applying for jobs that she will choose
either Company A or Company B as her employer. She will make the decision
based on two attributes: the appeal of the work and the amount of the salary.
If Company A surpasses Company B in both the appeal of the work and the amount
of salary, then she could easily choose Company A because Company A is superior
in all attributes to be considered. If, however, Company A were to pay higher
salaries and if Company B were to offer a more appealing job, then neither option
would be superior to the other.
In such a case, she confronts a tradeoff between the attributes. A tradeoff
between the attributes means, in essence, that if the job is fulﬁlling, she must
tolerate the lower salary to some degree. The tradeoff places a psychological burden
on her because it involves some tolerance, possible sacriﬁce, and consideration of
various aspects of the problem. Then, the decision-maker is likely to reconstruct
decision-making problems psychologically or reconsider particular attributes to
create alternatives that are psychologically superior. If, for example, she prioritizes
the appeal of work over the amount of salary, then the appeal of work is likely to be
emphasized more and the salary will be less important in the selection problem
according to the prominence hypothesis.
As this example illustrates, the psychological process by which people are
expected to distort the way they understand decision-making problems or consider
biased attributes was assumed not only in the prominence hypothesis of Tversky
et al. (1988), but also in the dominance structure search model of Montgomery
(1983, 1993). These two, however, mutually differ in the sense that, although the
dominance structure search model concerns the psychological process of decision-
making, the prominence hypothesis is to predict the relative weight between the
attributes in decision-making.
According to Tversky et al. (1988), the following two can be presented as
psychological reasons for the weight of more prominent attributes in decision-
making in selection problems to grow heavier and the decision-making method to
become lexicographic, as represented by the prominence hypothesis. The ﬁrst is
that a lexicographic method of decision-making requires no tradeoff between the
attributes: decision-making is possible without making great mental and emotional
effort. In other words, this gives a beneﬁt on the part of the decision-maker with
little burden of data processing required for lexicographic method of decision-
making (in short, decision-making will become easier). The other reason is that
the lexicographic method of decision-making facilitates the type of decision-
making that involves a tradeoff between attributes justifying the reasons why the
selected alternative is superior to the other alternatives that are not selected. Put
succinctly, because fewer attributes are examined, the reason for the superiority is
easy to explain to both the decision-maker himself and others. For these reasons,
38

Psychology of Preference Reversals and Prominence Hypothesis

Tversky et al. inferred that the prominence hypothesis would hold true in the
preference reversal phenomenon.
In pricing problems, the weight of decision-making on prominent attributes is
smaller than in the selection problems, and the prominence hypothesis assumes that
the lexicographic method of decision-making is unlikely to be adopted. What is the
psychological reason for this? In pricing problems, the winning percentages of two
gambles are known. Some adjustment is made so that the differences between the
two winning percentages and the amounts of prize money become equal. At such a
point, the weight of the winning percentages and amounts of prize money are
thought to be adjusted after the amounts of prize money because a mooring point
is determined such that the differences in the winning percentages and amounts of
prize money would be equal. Studies of judgment in the past have discovered that
when adjusting the assessed value after the mooring point is determined, the
adjustment is incomplete and an assessed value that has not changed much from
the mooring point tends to be estimated (e.g., Kahneman et al. 1982). For this
reason, the relative weight of prominent attributes was predicted to be smaller in
pricing problems than in selection problems.
2
Contingent Weighting Model
Tversky et al. (1988) developed the contingent weighting model to explain the
preference reversal phenomenon based on the prominence hypothesis. This model
is an approximate expression of the prominence hypothesis. The prominence
hypothesis can explain not only the inconsistency in preference in the selection
problems and pricing problems in the preference reversal phenomenon, but also the
inconsistency in the overall matching problems such as selection problems and
pricing. Therefore, this model based on this prominence hypothesis is also useful to
explain the inconsistency phenomenon in the entire selection and matching prob-
lems in addition to the preference reversal phenomenon. Accordingly, the following
will expand the pricing problems to the matching problems and explain them.
According to the expression of Tversky et al. (1988), this model takes the
following format.
The set of the ﬁrst and most examined attributes is A ¼ {a, b, c, . . .}; the set of
the secondary attributes to be examined next is Z ¼ {x, y, z, . . .}. Then we consider
the subject of selection as a Cartesian product: A  Z. The preference relations ≿c
and ≿m that satisfy a weak order are assumed to be a preference relation obtained
through a selection and a preference relation obtained through matching,
respectively.
We assume that the value of one attribute is independent from the ﬁxed value of
the other attribute. In other words, for arbitrary a, b ∈A and y, z ∈Z,

ay ≿i by , az ≿i bz

hold where i ¼ c, m.
Based on the assumption presented above, we assume that functions Fi and Gi
that indicate the following relations that are deﬁned on A and Z, respectively, exist.
In other words, for arbitrary a, b ∈A and y, z ∈Z,
az ≿i by , Fi a

By assuming (4.1) and (4.2), the existence of functions F and G that indicate the

hold where θi ¼ αi/βi and i ¼ c, m.
Tversky et al. (1988) attempted to explain the preference reversals in the
selection and matching problems based on the relations presented in (4.3). There-
fore, they expected that preference reversals would occur because of differences in
the values of θc and θm. Under the conditions that (4.3) holds true, the indifference
curves of the attributes receiving the most emphasis and the attributes receiving the
second most emphasis are parallel straight lines in the areas of selection problems
and matching problems, as portrayed in Fig. 4.1. If θ ¼ θc/θm, then the case of
θ ¼ 1 represents a case in which preference reversals are not occurring, and the
case of θ < 1 represents a case in which the prominence hypothesis holds true.
Tversky et al. (1988) proposed the contingent weighting model, which assumes
that such weight, θ, varies depending on the selection problem. Assuming for
simpliﬁcation that F and G are linear functions, then relation (4.3) becomes the
following.

Psychology of Preference Reversals and Prominence Hypothesis

We also assume that C(az, by) and M(az, by) respectively represent the ratios of
preferring by to az in a selection problem and a matching problem. Preference
reversals might occur in selection problems and matching problems. Therefore,
M(az, by) ¼ C(az, by) does not generally hold true. Accordingly, if y* is a value
that satisﬁes M(az, by*) ¼ C(az, by), then this holds when the following relation
can exist based on (4.4) and the additional assumption of stochastic conjoint
measurement (Tversky et al. 1988).

is deﬁned.
According to the prominence hypothesis, the value of θ is less than 1. This
hypothesis predicts that the weight of prominent attributes is greater in selection
problems than in matching problems.

Veriﬁcation Experiments for Contingent
Weighting Model
The following describes how the veriﬁcation experiments for the contingent
weighting model are performed and analyzed based on the study of Takemura
(1994). This study used psychological experiments to examine whether the contra-
diction in the judgment based on the selection problems and matching problems
developed by Tversky et al. (1988) were observable in the risk judgment of the
identical test subject in an extremely urgent situation. This study included six
experiment topics, of which the ﬁrst three were related to social decision-making
issues associated with risk; the last three used judgment issues relevant to the scale
of risk.
The subjects in this experiment were 23 adults, of whom 21 were junior and
senior engineering students at the University of Tsukuba. The other two were high-
school teachers. The test subjects received instructions on the topic in a classroom
and worked on selection and matching problems. The experimenter explained the
topic while writing the problems on the blackboard.
1. Selection problem
The topic was a decision-making problem, as presented below.
Every year, many people who lose their lives in trafﬁc accidents. Some
measures to reduce trafﬁc accidents have been developed according to the
government’s policy, and eventually, the following two proposals were
presented. Please look at the table on the blackboard (Table 4.1). Proposed
Measure x is predicted to reduce deaths in trafﬁc accidents by 85 %, but it
costs ¥1,000 million (approximately $10 million). Proposed Measure Y is
predicted to reduce deaths in trafﬁc accidents by 38 %, but it costs only ¥200
million (approximately $2 million). If you were to decide on the policy, which
proposal would you adopt?
2. Matching problem
After completing the selection problem, the experimenter gave the following
instructions related to the matching problem.
Please look at the table on the blackboard (Table 4.2). The cost of Proposed
Measure x is missing. Please estimate the cost so that Proposed Measures X and
Y will be equivalent.
The preference rates of the proposed measures in the selection and matching
problems are presented in Table 4.3. The test subjects who had reversed their
preference (judgment contradiction) on an individual basis were seven (30.4 %)
of those who changed their preference from X to Y and none from Y to X. In the
matching problem, the median of the estimated values of the missing value was
¥600 million (approximately $6 million). Those test subjects who indicated a
contradiction of risk assessment between the selection and matching problems
were seven individuals (30.4 %). The 95 % conﬁdence intervals of the rates
based on angular transformation (Iwahara 1964) were 8.3–59.2 %. This result
42

Psychology of Preference Reversals and Prominence Hypothesis

implies that the minimum of 8.3 % to the maximum of 59.2 % of the test subjects
are estimated to be cause contradiction in their risk assessment at the 95 %
conﬁdence interval. Such results suggest the occurrence of preference reversals
between the selection and matching problems and the change from the tendency to
examine reducing mortality speciﬁcally in the selection problem to the tendency to
examine the cost in the matching problem speciﬁcally at both the individual and
group levels. Like Tversky et al. (1988), assuming that the ﬁrst attribute to be
emphasized the most was the reduction of the percentage of deaths in trafﬁc
accidents and that the second attribute was the cost, then the θ value was 0.50.
This result is consistent with the prominence hypothesis because the θ value is less
than 1 in this hypothesis.
This study revealed a substantial contradiction of judgment ranging from
30–60 % in the ﬁrst three experiments on social decision-making related to risk.
The judgment contradiction among 10–20 % of the test subjects in the last three
experiments on the scale of risk. The reasons for the difference in the percentages of
test subjects who demonstrated contradiction is likely to include the difference in
the characteristics of the judgment problems. The issues for which the selection
aspects are emphasized, such as the case of social decision-making, appear more
likely to cause risk judgment contradiction than assessment issues such as the
scale of risk. Despite such differences in the issues, this study revealed that only
a change in the measurement procedure in risk judgment could cause preference
results to be reversed completely by the same test subject, even in an extremely
urgent situation.

The θ values based on the results of this experiment were 0.50, 0.40, and 1.20 in
the experiments of social decision-making and 0.83, 0.79, and 0.84 in experiments
in the judgment of the scale of risk. With the exception of results of the decision-
making experiment on automobile safety devices, the range of values consistent
with the hypothesis of Tversky et al. (1988) was obtained. Although the fact that the
value θ was greater than 1 in only one instance leaves room for future examination,
the series of experiment results can be regarded as corresponding generally to the
prominence hypothesis that
•
in selection problems, more important attributes such as mortality are empha-
sized and the speciﬁc examination of secondary attributes is reduced; and
•
conversely, in matching problems, the weight of the second attributes including
cost increases, thereby showing the effect that corresponds to the prominence
hypothesis.

Interpretation of Interpret Procedural Invariance:
The Scale Compatibility Principle
The prominence hypothesis presented herein indicates a deviation from procedural
invariance, in which the psychological process of decision-making varies
depending on the preference revelation procedures, and explains the preference
reversal phenomenon and contradiction between the selection and matching prob-
lems as a result of such deviation. Why, then, is the prominence hypothesis
developed? Tversky et al. (1988, 1990) and Slovic et al. (1990) proposed the
scale compatibility principle as a more general principle underlying the prominence
hypothesis.
The scale compatibility principle states that the weight of attributes in the
assessment of a subject increases if the type and measure of the response and
assessed attributes mutually correspond. In the preference reversal phenomenon,
for instance, the weight of the amount of prize money is expected to increase in
the pricing problem, which is a measure of response to an amount of money.
Conversely, in the selection problem, a decision with weight on the winning
percentage, which is considered important in the selection, is expected to be
made. In fact, we know that gambles with a low winning percentage and a large
amount of prize money are highly regarded in the preference reversal phenomenon.
This scale compatibility principle consistently explains such preference patterns in
the preference reversal phenomenon.
In addition, the following can be predicted from the scale compatibility principle
in connection with the preference reversal phenomenon. In the matching problem,
pricing with some prize money information missing makes the weight of the
amount of prize money higher than when estimating the winning percentage with
inadequate winning percentage data. Consequently, a gamble with a low winning
percentage and large amount of prize money (Gamble L) will be preferred to a
44
4
Psychology of Preference Reversals and Prominence Hypothesis

gamble with a high winning percentage and small amount of prize money
(Gamble H). Slovic et al. (1990) conducted an experiment with 200 students at
the University of Oregon to examine this hypothesis. The results are presented in
Table 4.4, which reveals that the results are consistent with the hypothesis based on
the scale compatibility principle.
Finally, the phenomenon called deviation from procedural invariance explained
in this chapter appears to conﬂict with the premise of psychology and social science
that one true value exists in the assessed values. Currently, few reasonable grounds
exist for whether it is the selection problem or matching problem that can measure
the true value of the judgment-maker. Addressing the issues such as which method
should be used to make social judgments that are accepted by more people or what
types of methods are justiﬁable is necessary in the future. Furthermore, future
judgments and decision-making studies are necessary to consider this apparent
contradiction in human judgment.

Expected Utility Theory and Psychology
Expected utility theory is a major theory of decision making under risk. Decision
making under risk is a type of decision-making in which the probability distribution
of the results is known. This expected utility theory is assumed in numerous
theories of economics. Certainly, any student taking economics should have been
taught it in a course of some kind.
The history of expected utility theory is long; it had already been proposed in the
eighteenth century and is closely related to psychology constituting the origin of
behavioral decision theory. This chapter ﬁrst explains the basic idea of the initial
expected utility theory and then, and how this theory is related to psychological
theories. Subsequently, psychological studies of utility measurement based on
expected utility theory will be introduced in the ﬁnal part.
1
The St. Petersburg Paradox and Expected Utility
Decision making under risk is often explained using the idea of expected value of
utility, namely, expected utility. For example, the utility of taking an umbrella when
going out can be described as follows:
EU taking an umbrella when going out
ð
Þ
¼ p1 It rains
ð
Þ  u1 going out with an umbrella when it rains
ð
Þ
þ p2 It does not rain
ð
Þ  u2 going out with an umbrella when it does not rain
ð
Þ
In that equation, p1 and p2 are probabilities and p1 + p2 ¼ 1 based on the
probability axiom. Such a theory that addresses the expected value of utility in
decision-making under risk is called expected utility theory. The type that assumes
a subjective probability is particularly called subjective expected utility theory.

1.1
St. Petersburg Paradox
Expected utility theory of decision making under risk dates back to the formulation
of D. Bernoulli, an eighteenth century mathematician. He proposed the application
of expected utility to solve the St. Petersburg paradox introduced by his uncle,
N. Bernoulli.
This paradox can be described as follows (Tamura et al. 1997). A coin with the
probability of showing a head or tail being 0.5 is tossed repeatedly until a head
appears. Win $2n if it is tossed n times until the ﬁrst head appears. The question,
then, is what the maximum price considered fair to pay to participate in the game
would be (Apparently, the original unit of money is replaced with dollar here).
Assuming that the trials are repeated inﬁnite times, the expected value EV of
participating in this game would be
EV ¼
X

n¼1
2n  2n ¼ 2 1

 
þ 4 1
4
 
þ 8 1
8
 
þ    ¼ 1 þ 1 þ 1 þ    ¼ 1
which would exceed any ﬁnite price if the expected value is the judgment criterion.
The author administered a questionnaire survey to undergraduate and graduate
classes on the question of up to how much would be the acceptable price to pay for
this game. Most students responded that they would pay less than $10. This answer
was generally common among humanities students at Waseda University and
science and technology students at University of Tsukuba and Tokyo Institute of
Technology.
Such intuition of people contradicts the idea of expected value. People’s intui-
tion should not have varied signiﬁcantly since the time of Bernoulli, which is
presumably why it was called a paradox.
1.2
Solution to the Paradox
Bernoulli considered the following expected utility, EU, which is the expected
value of the utility of logarithmic function u(2n) ¼ log(2n).
EU ¼
X
1
n¼1
log 2n
ð
Þ  2n
ð
Þ ¼ log4
He demonstrated that the expected utility in this example would converge to a
rather low ﬁnite value, i.e., log4 (approximately 1.4) which is worth $4. He argued
that the paradox would be solved by considering such an expected value of the
logarithmic utility function.

Expected Utility Theory and Psychology

The utility function that is expressed with such a logarithmic function shown in
Fig. 5.1 indicates a characteristic of “diminishing marginal utility”: the larger the
amount of money, the lower the rate of increase in utility. In actuality, that is a
function that is concave downward (concave function), signifying risk-averse
decision-making.
This paradox, however, might not be a paradox if we assume that the budget of
the banker is ﬁnite as suggested by Kaneko (2003). As exempliﬁed by Kaneko
(2003), even if the banker’s budget were equivalent to $80 trillion (more than
20 times of a national budget of the United States and more than 70 times of a
national budget of Japan) is only between the 46th and 47th power of $2. Therefore,
the expected value of the game is only between $46 and $47, which translates into
the following.
X
46
n¼1
2n  2n ¼ 46 < EV <
X
47
n¼1
2n  2n ¼ 47
Therefore, even if the banker had as much money as the national budget of the
United States, the expected value would be considerably low and would not be a
paradox.
Although some might argue that the interpretation of St. Petersburg paradox
need not consider the logarithmic utility function that was formulated by Bernoulli,
the inclusion of this function can be fully justiﬁed when considered from a
psychological perspective. The following describes the relevance between the
logarithmic utility function and research ﬁndings in the perceived quantities in
psychology.

Relevance Between Fechner’s Psychophysics
and Logarithmic Utility Function
Since early times, the ﬁeld of psychophysics has existed in psychology, in which
the theory of perceived quantity that can be expressed in a logarithmic function
has been developed. The perceived quantity is deﬁned based on human sensory
judgment and utility is deﬁned based on selection and preference, whose measure-
ment procedures therefore mutually differ despite their remarkably similar
concepts.
The founder of psychophysics, G. T. Fechner, proposed psychophysical
methods of measurement in his book, Elemente der Psychophysik (Elements of
Psychophysics) published in 1860 (Fechner, 1860). He developed the constant
measurement method and scaling method to identify the functional relation
between stimulus intensity and psychological quantity gained through judgment
and derived the theory of perceived quantity that is expressed in the logarithmic
function.
He proposed the theory, the so-called Fechner’s law, that the intensity of a
sensation, S, as judged based on the experiment ﬁndings of E. H. Weber et al. that
the ratio, ΔI/I, of stimulus intensity, I, and its differential threshold, ΔI, is constant,
which is the so-called Weber’s law, and is proportional to the logarithm of the
stimulus intensity, I (S ¼ klogI where k is a constant) (Wada et al. 1969; Indo 1977).
Weber’s law states that an increase in a barely detectable stimulus, i.e., the
differential threshold, is proportional to the initial intensity of the stimulus. The
following experiment, might be a helpful illustration.
A test subject holds two glasses ﬁlled with water (both mass whose value is I) as
in Fig. 5.2 and closes his eyes. Then, the other person slowly pours water into
either of the glasses. The test subject tells the other person which one has become
heavier when he feels the additional weight. Then, the increase (ΔI) in the mass of
the water is measured.
Through these steps, the value of the Weber ratio, ΔI/I, can be inferred. This
experiment is repeated multiple times for each person to calculate the average
Weber ratio. Weber’s law holds that when the glass with water weighs 100 g, even
if the additional weight is sensed when more water is added to produce 115 g in
comparison to 100 g, the difference between 200 and 215 g cannot be felt, but the
difference between 200 and 230 g is recognizable. In other words, Weber’s law
holds that the ratio, ΔI/I, between the stimulus intensity, I, and its differential
threshold, ΔI, is constant.
This law is known to be applicable to various senses such as hearing, vision, and
touch (Wada et al. 1969). Not only it is applicable to such basic senses, but it is also
known to be generally valid for such a sense as the feeling of having struck a good
bargain when given a product price discount (Kojima 1986). Weber’s law suggests,
for example, that a 30-cents discount on a $1 product and the same discount on a
52
5
Expected Utility Theory and Psychology

$100 product would not give the same sense of a bargain, although a 30-cents
discount on a $1 product and a $30 discount on $100 product would be felt equally
as a good bargain.
In the derivation of Fechner’s law, he considered ΔI in differentiation, assumed
ΔI ¼ dI, and further assumed that this was proportional to the minimum unit
ΔS ¼ dS of senses, leading to dS ¼ k dI/I (k is a constant). He took the integral
of both sides of this equation to form
S ¼ klogI þ C ðC is a constantÞ:
If the stimulus intensity is I0 when S ¼ 0, then C ¼  klogI0 should result,
which therefore engenders
S ¼ klogI  klogI0 ¼ klog I
I0
:
IfweassumethatI/I0isastimulusintensitythathasbeenstandardizedbythe stimulus
threshold value I0, we obtain the so-called Fechner’s law, which can be expressed using
the same formula as that of Bernoulli’s logarithmic utility function. Assuming the
perceived amount of money, a diminishing effect that is equivalent to the nature of
diminishing marginal utility in the utility function assumed by Bernoulli is visible.

Possible Psychophysical Laws and Utility Function
Gustav Theodor Fechner
Born in 1801; deceased in 1887. According to Schultz (1981), Fechner began
studying medicine at the age of 16 at the University of Leipzig in 1817. He
started to give lectures at that university in 1824, and became a professor at
the university in 1833. His studies cover widely various ﬁelds, including
physiology, physics, mathematics, psychology, experimental aesthetics, and
philosophy (Schultz, 1981).
He is the founder of psychophysics and demonstrated that psychology
could be studied using quantitative models and experiments. His psychophys-
ical studies not only strongly affected modern psychology, but also left a
substantial impact on such philosophers as E. Mach, E. Husserl, and
H. Bergson.

Like this Fechner’s law, the law for the relation between physical and psycho-
logical quantities is called a psychophysical law, on which various studies have
been conducted up to the present. The propriety of the psychophysical function in
Fechner’s logarithmic function has been challenged by some who criticize that the
derivation of Weber’s law involves an illogical leap, and by S. S. Stevens who
argues in his theory (S ¼ αIβ where α and β are constants) that a power function,
rather than a logarithmic function, is appropriate (Wada et al. 1969). Although such
arguments are made, Fechner’s logarithmic function, together with the power
function of Stevens (1975), is generally accepted as a psychophysical function for
stimuli and reactions.
54

Expected Utility Theory and Psychology

In connection with this, D.
Luce––a
mathematical
psychologist––used
functional equations to develop an argument about “possible psychophysical
laws” that correspond to an interval scale and a ratio scale (Luce 1959, 1990).
His study was an attempt to derive theoretically possible psychophysical laws from
the perspective of an admissible transformation of scales.
First, assuming that perceived quantity u(I) is an interval scale, then changing
the unit of the scale value of I and converting it by constant multiplication (k times)
can be expected to yield the following functional equation because u(I) is
thought be linearly transformed based on the deﬁnition of an interval scale, which
means that
v kI
ð
Þ ¼ K k
ð Þu Ið Þ þ C k
ð Þ k > 0, K k
ð Þ > 0:
Luce has proved that the only continuous function, u(I), that could satisfy the
above functional equation above would be the following two functions.
u Ið Þ ¼ αlogI þ β
u Ið Þ ¼ αIβ
Therefore, Fechner’s law or Stevens’ law holds when the judgment uses an
interval scale.
If the stimulus is I ratio scale and the perceived quantity, then v(I) is also a ratio
scale based on the deﬁnition of a ratio scale; changing the unit of the scale value of
stimulus I and converting it by constant multiplication (k times) is only likely to
multiply the scale v(I)(> 0) of the perceived quantity by K(k) in response, resulting
in homomorphic correspondence. Therefore, the following functional equation is
thought to hold.
v kI
ð
Þ ¼ K k
ð Þv Ið Þ k > 0, K k
ð Þ > 0:
Luce proved that the continuous function
v(I) that satisﬁes the functional
equation above would be the following power function.
v Ið Þ ¼ αIβ, α > 0
Consequently, Luce’s theoretical study described here can be summarized as
showing that when the stimulus can be measured using a ratio scale, Stevens’ law
holds if human judgment uses a ratio scale and Fechner’s law or Stevens’ holds if
the judgment uses an interval scale. Although neither law is related to a utility
function, it is interesting that Fechner’s law resembles Bernoulli’s logarithmic
utility function and that Stevens’ utility function resembles the Cobb–Douglas
function, which is often used in economics.

Possible Psychophysical Laws and Utility Function
55

This Luce’s formulation has been criticized by some who argue that it is not
applicable to a case in which there is no unit of stimulus intensity (i.e., being made
dimensionless) (Indo 1977). Researchers are still discussing Luce’s formulation to
the present day (Iverson and Luce 1998). Additionally, Takemura (1998, 2001)
proposed an assessment function for the judgment that consumers make. The
mental ruler theory alleges the function’s characteristics as being concave down-
ward near the lower limit of a stimulus that can be judged and convex downward
near the upper limit. That formulation includes the laws of Fechner and Stevens as
special cases.
As suggested, the conclusion of Luce’s formulation necessitates further
studies. Despite such arguments, Fechner’s logarithmic function and Stevens’
power function are generally accepted to a considerable degree as a psychophysical
function for stimuli and reactions. Apart from the ﬁeld of senses, numerous theories
that use value functions and utility functions equivalent to the psychophysical
functions of Fechner and Stevens have been developed in the theories of value
and utility.
For example, estimation of value function using a power function is conducted
also in nonlinear utility theories such as the prospect theory of A. Tversky and
D. Kahneman, which describes the assessment of monetary beneﬁts (Tversky
and Kahneman 1992). Because the measurement procedures for the utility function
and psychophysical function mutually differ, even if they are expressed in the same
formula, their axiomatic systems differ. Therefore, they cannot be considered
identical. However, they certainly share a close relation.

of Jerusalem in 1961 and earned a Ph.D. degree from University of Michigan
in 1965. He taught classes at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem between
1966 and 1978 and at Stanford University from 1978 until he passed away.
He spent many years studying decision-making under risk and uncertainty
with Daniel Kahneman, the winner of the 2002 Nobel Prize in economics.
There must be many researchers who think that he would have received the
Nobel Prize jointly with Kahneman if he had lived until 2002.
He also conducted joint research on the preference reversal phenomenon
with Paul Slovic, who is well-known for his studies of risk perception.
Although he is considered a pioneer of behavioral economics, he is highly
recognized among psychologists in the ﬁelds of cognitive psychology and
cognitive social psychology that include cognitive biases.

Study of the Measurement of Utility Based
on the Expected Utility Theory
Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944/1947) demonstrated that a utility function
based on an objective probability exists when multiple axioms are satisﬁed; that
utility can be measured when the expected utility theory is assumed. Unlike
Bernoulli’s expected utility theory, their expected utility theory does not necessar-
ily assume a logarithmic utility function, but they formulate a utility function in a
more abstract form.
The expected utility in the expected utility theory of von Neumann and
Morgenstern is expressed as follows (Tamura et al. 1997). First, we assume that
the set of alternatives is
A ¼ al; am; . . .
f
g
and that the probability of obtaining the result xi when the decision-maker selects

respectively. This expected utility theory assumes that the decision-maker adopts
the alternative that results in the maximum expected utility from the set, A, of
alternatives. In addition, this utility function is known not to lose its essential
meaning even after a positive linear transformation and is known to have the nature
of cardinal utility (interval scale).
Mosteller and Nogee (1951) conducted an experiment to measure people’s
utility after assuming the expected utility theory. They explained the gamble by
expressing it as a payoff matrix shown in Table 5.1 to the test subjects and
repeatedly asking them whether they would accept the gamble of poker dice in an
attempt to measure utility. In their experiment, the probabilities of all outcomes in
the poker dice are presented to the test subjects.
According to the expected utility theory, the equation below holds true when the
expected utility values of gambling and not gambling are equivalent:

Therein, p is the known probability of winning the gamble. Because the utility is

They attempted to measure the utility by considering the payoff (x) systemati-
cally and setting the condition in which the probabilities of selecting gambling and
not gambling are both 50 % as the equivalence point.

Expected Utility Theory and Psychology

Nine Harvard University students and ﬁve National Guard members of the State
of Massachusetts participated as test subjects; numerous trials were conducted over
a period of 4 months. Utility ranging from $0.05 to $5.50, depending on the
experiment, was measured. Consequently, a concave downward utility function
was obtained for the students and a downward convex utility function was acquired
for the National Guard members.
A problem with the experiment of Mosteller and Nogee (1951) was that,
although the objective probability was presented to the test subjects in their
experiment, they were unable to eliminate the possibility that the probability was
converted to a subjective ﬁgure. Particularly based on the idea of the subjective
expected utility theory of Savage (1954), their experiment was unable to identify
whether the subjective probability had changed or whether the utility had changed.
According to the subjective expected utility theory of Savage, if multiple axioms of
selection behavior were accepted, then it would be equivalent to the fact that
people’s preference relations select the alternative that would maximize the sub-
jective expected utility based on subjective probability.
To overcome such a problem, Davidson et al. (1957) assumed subjective expected
utility theory and considered an experiment in which the subjective probability would
become 1/2 in an attempt to measure both the utility and subjective probability. If the
probability of event E is 1/2, then the subjective probability of its complementary
event Ec also becomes 1/2 according to the probability axioms. Under subjective
expected utility theory, if a gamble in which x is gained when E occurs and y is gained
when Ec occurs, and conversely, a gamble in which y is gained when E occurs and x is
gained when Ec occurs are not different, then the subjective probability of E and that of
Ec are equal and 1/2.
Because test subjects tend to prefer either heads or tails systematically in coin
tossing, they used a six-sided die with meaningless words such as “ZEJ” written on
three sides and “ZOJ” written on the other three sides to eliminate the systematic
preferences and created an event, E, that would generate a subjective equal prob-
ability. Subsequently, they performed a gamble selection experiment by changing
the payoffs in the payoff matrix, as shown in Table 5.2.
According to subjective expected utility theory, the utility function, u, and
subjective probability, s, that satisfy the following relation exist.

Furthermore, because they set E so that s(E) ¼ s(Ec) in their experiment, the
subjective probability is eliminated, resulting in

By arbitrarily selecting the payoffs, they arbitrarily set the upper and lower
limits of the utility function at 5 and  5, respectively, from the inequality derived
from the selection. They subsequently estimated the utility value and inferred the
form of the utility function (see Fig. 5.3).
This experiment estimated the utility of 15 test subjects selected by removing
4 who had made a decision contradictory to the theory from among 19 subjects at
Stanford University.
They also arbitrarily selected the payoffs so that G1 and G2 would be mutually

Using this procedure, they measured the subjective probability of an event
whose objective probability was 1/4, discovering that most of the test subjects
tended to underestimate the objective probability.

Chapter 6
Axioms and Counterexamples Expected
Utility Theory
Chapter 5 explained the relevance between the initial idea of expected utility theory
and psychology and introduced some studies of utility measurement based on
expected utility theory. This chapter will ﬁrst explain the axiomatic system of
expected utility theory, then how to approach the axiomatic system, with introduc-
tion of some counterexamples.
A study of one theory of decision-making that derives a group of axioms
expressing decision-making and preference relations (Barbera` et al. 1998; Bell
et al. 1988; Edwards 1992; Fishburn 1988; Ichikawa 1983; Iverson and Luce
1998; von Neumann and Morgenstern 1944/1947; Savage 1954; Tamura
et al. 1997). This approach is an axiomatic method that has been adopted by
mathematical psychologists and mathematical economists, which is intended to
develop a structure of theoretical studies to derive the small number of qualitative
axioms that underpin the quantitative models of decision-making. Empirical testing
of the axioms of decision theory supports the investigation of the essential charac-
teristics of decision-making and preference relations. A group of axioms has been
studied empirically in the ﬁeld of behavioral decision theory.
Empirical examination of the axioms of expected utility theory has produced
some ﬁndings that cannot be fully supported: the Allais paradox (Allais 1953) and
the Ellsberg paradox (Ellsberg 1961).

1.1
Review of the Structure of Decision-Making Under Risk
Before explaining the axioms of expected utility theory, we will review the structure
of decision-making under risk. First, when a set of ﬁnite alternatives is A and
its elements are organized as mutually exclusive alternatives a1, . . ., ai, . . ., al

(l is the number of alternatives), then the set can be written as A ¼ {a1, . . ., ai, . . ., al}.
Subsequently, we consider the set, X ¼ {x1, . . ., xj, . . ., xm}, which is the result of
adopting these alternatives. For instance, the elements of X include x1 ¼ a gain of
$100, x2 ¼ no gains, and x3 ¼ a gain of $200. When a speciﬁc alternative, ai,
is adopted, a result, xj, is likely to appear. However, ai and xj are not necessarily
mutually correspondent. Result xj of adopting alternative ai should depend at least on
a state of some kind, Θ ¼ {θ1, . . ., θk, . . ., θn}, and the probability distribution of
Θ in decision-making under risk is known.
We assume, for example, some gambles in which a die is rolled, yielding
the following results.
θ1 ¼ 1, 2, or 3,
θ2 ¼ 4, or 5, or
θ3 ¼ 6:
We also assume that the amount of prize money is determined depending on the
pips on the dice rolled, as shown in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1 reveals that the result is determined by the function (mapping) from
the alternative selected and state to the result, which is
f : A  Θ ! X,
where
A  Θ ¼
ai; θk
ð
Þ
ai ∈A, θk ∈Θ

:
Regarding the probability in this case, the probability of θ1 is p(θ1) ¼ 1/2, the
probability of θ2 is p(θ2) ¼ 1/3, and the probability of θ3 is p(θ3) ¼ 1/6. These
probabilities can also be considered in terms of subjective probability based on
frequency theory. Consequently, the probability on the results, X, for each alternative
aj ∈A can be determined as presented in Table 6.2. For instance, p33 in Table 6.2 is
the probability of the result (X3) that $200 is gained when Gamble 3 (a3) is selected.

According to Table 6.1, this is the result of the states θ1 and θ2; the probability
p33 becomes p(θ1) + p(θ2) ¼ 1/2 + 1/3 ¼ 5/6, leading to p33 ¼ 5/6 shown in
Table 6.2.
Therefore, the question of decision-making under risk by which one alternative,
ai ∈A, should be selected can be replaced with the question of which of the
following probability distributions on X should be selected.
p1 ¼ p11; p12; . . . ; p1m

p2 ¼ p21; p22; . . . ; p2m

  
pl ¼ pl1; pl2; . . . ; plm

These equations signify that decision-making under risk can be expressed with a
preference structure 〈P, 〉, in which a preference relation, , is added to the set of
probabilities P ¼ {p1, p2, . . ., pl} on X (This was explained in Chap. 1 using a
different example).
1.2
Redeﬁnition of Gambling
In an attempt to examine decision-making under risk further, we will ﬁrst review
the deﬁnition of probability by following the explanation of Tamura et al. (1997) to
redeﬁne gambling.
First, we consider the set of results, X. The A subset, E(E  X), of this set X is
an element of 2X of the power set of X(E ∈2X). In this case, the power set of X
refers to the set of all subsets of the set X, which is expressed as 2X. Each element of
a power set is a set itself. When X ¼ {x1, x2, x3}, for instance, 2X is a set consisting
of the following eight elements (ϕ, however, is an empty set).
2X ¼ ϕ; x1

We next consider what is called a ﬁnitely additive probability measure, p, on 2X.
The name, ﬁnitely additive probability measure might sound forbidding, but in
simple terms, this refers to such a “probability” that can be expressed, for instance,

as p({x1}) ¼ 0.2. The ﬁnitely additive probability measure, p, on 2X is a set
function that satisﬁes the following conditions for all Ei, Ej ∈2X.
1. p(X) ¼ 1
2. p(Ei)  0
3. Ei \ Ej ¼ ϕ ) p(Ei [ Ej) ¼ p(Ei) + p(Ej)
In other words, if (1) the probability of the entire set of results, X, is 1, then
(2) the probability of an arbitrary subset, Ei of X is 0, and (3) the product set,
Ei \ Ej, of an arbitrary subset of X is an empty set (meaning that Ei and Ej do not
intersect mutually), the probability of the union of Ei and Ej (i.e., the set combining
Ei and Ej) is equivalent to p(Ei) + p(Ej).
Next, we consider a convex set, PX, of the ﬁnitely additive probability measure
on 2X (which is simply designated as a probability measure in the following).
When PX is a convex set, if 1  λ  0 and arbitrary p and q are elements of
PX( p, q ∈PX), then λp + (1  λ)q is also an element of PX(λp + (1  λ)
q ∈PX). In other words, a combination of the probabilities of two arbitrary results
still represents an element of PX.
When Ei ∈PX is a ﬁnite set, the probability measure resulting in p(Ei) ¼ 1 is
said to be simple. This simple probability measure can be interpreted as
representing gambling and lotteries based on the example of Table 6.2. Therefore,
if PX is a convex set, then this can be interpreted that a compound lottery or
compound gambling that combines multiple lotteries or gambles with certain
probabilities, λ and 1  λ, is also an element of PX.

price judgment including the feeling of good bargain when given a product
price discount.
We continue to explain the axiomatic system of expected utility theory using the
expressions of Tamura et al. (1997).
First, because PX can be interpreted as a set of alternatives, we consider the
binary relations on PX and can assume a real valued function, Φ, on PX  PX that
satisﬁes p  q , Φ( p,q) > 0 for all p, q ∈PX. Therein,  represents a strong
preference relation (i.e., 8 p, q ∈PX, p ≿q ^ not(q ≿p), where ≿is a weak
preference relation).
Based on this real-valued function, Φ, the expected utility theory of von Neu-
mann and Morgenstern (1944/1947) introduced in the previous chapter is explained
using the following linear utility model.
2.1
Linear Utility Model
A linear utility model refers to a linear functional, U, on PX that satisﬁes
Φ( p, q) ¼ U( p)  U(q) for all p, q ∈PX. A linear function is deﬁnable as follows:
assuming that PX is a linear space on R, when mapping U : PX ! R has the
following two properties (linearity), i.e., when the following are true,
1. 8 p, q ∈PX, U( p + q) ¼ U( p) + U(q)
2. 8 a ∈R, 8 p ∈PX, U(ap) ¼ aU( p)
then U is a linear functional on PX.
2
Axiomatic System of Expected Utility Theory
67

The fact that U is linear means, in a different expression, that
U(λp + (1  λ)q) ¼ λU( p) + (1  λ)U(q) is true for all p, q ∈PX and all
0 < λ < 1.
Therein, Φ maintains its uniqueness even after positive constant multiplication
(meaning it is a ratio scale) based on the deﬁnition of the linearity of U. Therefore,
we know that U maintains its uniqueness with a positive linear transformation
(meaning it is an interval scale). The reason is that the assumption of U0 ¼ αU +
β (α > 0) results in αΦ( p,q) ¼ U0( p)  U0(q).
A linear utility model based on the utility U( pi) of a simple probability measure,
pi, that generates m units of results xj ∈X of Gamble ai ∈A with the probability of
pij(∑m
j¼1pij ¼ 1) each can be regarded as seeking the expected value of U(xj)
because U( pi) ¼ ∑m
j¼1pijU(xj) holds based on the linearity of U, in which U( pi) is
seeking the expected value of U(xj). In this sense, this linear utility model, U, can be
regarded as an expected utility model. It also means that the expected utility theory
of von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944/1947) seeks expected utility using the
linear utility model U.
Some necessary and sufﬁcient conditions exist for the expected utility theory of
von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944/1947) to hold. Although they also presented
an axiomatic system exhibiting necessary and sufﬁcient conditions, in general, the
axiomatic system of Jensen (1967) is often used, as provided below. We assume
that the axiomatic system displayed below holds true for all p, q ∈PX and all
0 < λ < 1 that were deﬁned earlier (the expressions of axiomatic systems are based
on Tamura et al. 1997).
Axiom A1 (Order Axiom)  on Px represents a weak order.
The fact that the preference relation  is a weak order means that
1. asymmetry, p  q ) not(q  p), and
2. negative transitivity, not( p  q) ^ not(q  r) ) not( p  r),
hold true.
This is equivalent to the fact that
1. transitivity, p ≿q ^ q ≿r ) p ≿r, and
2. comparability, 8 p, q ∈Px, p ≿q _ q ≿p
hold for the weak preference relation, ≿.
Axiom A2 (independence axiom) If p  q, then λp + (1  λ)r  λq + (1  λ)r.
Axiom A3 (continuity axiom) If p  q and q  r, then certain α, β ∈(0,1) exists
and αp + (1  α)r  q and q  βp + (1  β)r.

Axioms and Counterexamples Expected Utility Theory

2.2
Theorem of Expected Utility of von Neumann
and Morgenstern
When and only when Axioms A1, A2, and A3 hold, the linear functional, U, on Px
exists and
p  q ) U p
ð Þ > U q
ð Þ
holds for all p, q ∈Px. Additionally, U maintains its uniqueness with a positive
linear transformation (U is an interval scale).
Axiom A2, the independence axiom, is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition
because U is linear, and Axiom A3, the continuity axiom, is a necessary axiom
because U is a mapping to the set, Px, of real numbers.
The independence axiom is a particularly important property in expected utility
theory. Deviation from this axiom can be interpreted as causing the Allais paradox
and Ellsberg paradox that will be described later. The independence axiom means
that when the preference relation of two alternatives (gamble) is certain, even if
another gamble with equivalent results and probability of each result is combined,
the preference relation of these alternatives is maintained.
We assume, for instance, that Gamble 2 is preferred to Gamble 1 in the case
of the gamble in Table 6.2. Composing compound gambles incorporating the pair of
Gamble 1 and Gamble 3 and the pair of Gamble 2 and Gamble 3 with a probability
of 0.5 results in Gamble 1 and Gamble 2 in Table 6.3. The independence axiom
demands that Gamble 2’ be preferred to Gamble 1’ if Gamble 2 is preferred to
Gamble 1.

Counterexamples of Expected Utility Theory
Does such utility theory reﬂect the decision-making of actual people? The
phenomena called the Allais paradox (see Fig. 6.1) and the Ellsberg paradox (see
Fig. 6.2) constitute counterexamples of expected utility theory, which deviate from
the independence axiom of expected utility theory described earlier. Such phenom-
ena suggest that expected utility theory does not fully reﬂect decision-making in
reality (Slovic and Tversky 1974).

Axioms and Counterexamples Expected Utility Theory

3.1
The Allais Paradox
Allais (1953) presented counterexamples of expected utility theory (Takemura
1996). We assume the following decision-making problem. First, Problem 1 is
related to the selection between Alternatives A and B, as shown in Fig. 6.1.
Selecting Alternative A results in a deﬁnite gain of $1 million. Alternative B is a
lottery that offers a gain of $5 million with a probability of 10 %, $1 million with
a probability of 89 % and $0 (no prize money) with a probability of 1 %.
A comparison of A and B is likely to lead most people to select A, which promises
a deﬁnite gain of prize money.
Subsequently, Problem 2 is one of two lotteries, which are Alternative C that
provides $1 million with a probability of 11 % and Alternative D that offers a gain
of $5 million with a probability of 10 %. In this case, many people presumably
prefer D to C.
This result, however, clearly contradicts expected utility theory. The reason is
that, ﬁrst, the sections enclosed by dashed rectangles are common among problems.
Therefore, they need not to be considered in the preference based on the indepen-
dence axiom of expected utility theory and also in the sections without the dashed
rectangle enclosures, A of Problem 1 and C of Problem 2 are the same and B of
Problem 1 and D of Problem 2 are the same (see Fig. 6.1).
The Allais paradox has been indicated by numerous test subjects in psycholog-
ical experiments (Slovic and Tversky 1974; Tversky and Kahneman 1992), which
is thought in psychology to be a result of the certainty effect that a deﬁnite gain is
preferred to an uncertain gain.
3.2
The Ellsberg Paradox
Ellsberg (1961) expressed preference in connection with ambiguity in the case in
which the probability distribution of the results is unknown using speciﬁc examples
and presented counterexamples of expected utility theory (subjective expected
utility theory) (Takemura 1996).
We consider the following situation by following the paradox presented by
Ellsberg (see Fig. 6.2). We know that a total of 90 balls are in a pot, of which
30 are red balls and 60 are a mix of black and yellow balls, the composition ratio of
which is unknown. Assuming that one ball is taken out of this pot, we consider the
following decision-making problem.
As presented in Fig. 6.2, in Problem 1, Alternative A is a gamble that yields a
gain of $100 if a red ball (r) comes out and $0 if any other color comes out. The
other Alternative B is a gamble that provides a gain of $100 if a black ball (b) comes
out and $0 for any other color. A comparison of these two alternatives is likely to
lead most people to prefer A to B (A  B).

Next, as shown in Fig. 6.2, in Problem 2, Alternative C provides $100 if a red or
yellow ball (r or y) comes out and $0 for any other color. Alternative D is a gamble
yielding a gain of $100 if a black or yellow ball (b or y) comes out and $0 for any
other color. In this case, most people are likely to prefer D to C (D  C).
Such results of preference, however, clearly contradict expected utility theory,
which assumes additivity of probability that a sum event of mutually exclusive
events equals the sum of probabilities of individual events. In other words, the
preference (A  B) in Problem 1 means that the probability P(r) of taking out a red
ball is higher than the probability P(b) of picking a black ball (P(r)  P(b)); the
preference (D  C) in Problem 2 means that the probability P(r [ y) of picking a
red or yellow ball is lower than the probability P(b [ y) of taking out a black
or yellow ball (P(r [ y) < P(b [ y)). The pair of r and y and the pair of b and
y are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, P(r [ y) ¼ P(r) + P(y) and P(b [ y)
¼ P(b) + P(y) when additivity of probability is assumed.
Based on this, the preference, D  C in Problem 2 indicates P(b) > P(r),
clearly contradicting the conclusion P(r) > P(b) from the preference in Problem 1.
This Ellsberg paradox can be interpreted as implying a deviation from the
independence axiom in expected utility theory. One conceivable psychological
cause of this Ellsberg paradox is ambiguity aversion, an attitude of a decision
maker to seek to avoid ambiguity. In other words, this is an attitude of people to
dislike ambiguity when the probability of the results is unknown and avoid
selecting the ambiguous alternative. In recent years, various explanations have
been proposed for why such aversion arises. Numerous empirical studies have
been conducted.

The

explained
that

included
counterexamples called the Allais paradox (Allais 1953) and the Ellsberg paradox
(Ellsberg 1961). The Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes are interpreted as deviations
from the independence axiom. This chapter ﬁrst explains the relations between
these paradoxes and the independence axiom.
In recent years, these paradoxes have become explainable using such theory
systems called nonlinear utility theory (Fishburn 1988; Edwards 1992), which does
not assume this independence axiom, and generalized expected utility theory
(Quiggin 1993). Prospect theory as proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979),
Tversky and Kahneman (1992) is a theory that particularly integrates knowledge
and past ﬁndings in behavioral decision-making theory and nonlinear utility theory
(or generalized expected utility theory). This chapter explains the idea of
non-additive probability assumed in nonlinear utility theory and the expected utility
based on such non-additive probability. The chapter ﬁnally describes the basic
assumptions in prospect theory.

Relations Between Independence Axiom and Paradoxes
The Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes can be described using deviations from the
independence axiom in expected utility theory. Because the Allais paradox is a
paradox of decision-making under risk, the probability distribution in the state of
nature is known. The Ellsberg paradox, on the other hand, is the case in which,
generally, only the state of nature is known, constituting a problem under uncertainty.
In the case of decision-making under risk, the independence axiom demands that
if p  t for arbitrary probability distributions p, t, and r, then the preference relation
between the convex combination (λp + (1  λ)r) of probability distributions,
p and r, and the convex combination, λt + (1  λ)r, of t and r are the same.
In other words, for all probability distributions p, t, r ∈Px and for all probabilities
0 < λ < 1,

holds true. Therefore, if the independence axiom cannot be established, then a

Furthermore, αt + (1  α)r ≿αp + (1  α)r holds in spite of p  t (Tamura

Independence Axiom Under Risk
Daniel Ellsberg
Daniel Ellsberg was born in Detroit, Michigan, the United States of America
in 1931. After graduating from Harvard University Department of Economics
in 1952, he attended the University of Cambridge, served as a U.S. Marine
between 1954 and 1957, and worked as a Harvard University Junior Fellow
between 1957 and 1959. Subsequently in 1962, he earned a doctoral degree
from the same university. In his doctoral dissertation, he introduced the
so-called Ellsberg paradox and pointed out the problems of expected utility
theory. His studies can be considered the pioneer of the current nonlinear
utility theory and behavioral decision-making theory. Many of his numerous
papers are still studied today. In 2002, he was invited into the Society for
Judgment and Decision Making for behavioral decision-making theory, at
which time he presented a lecture entitled “the Allais and Ellsberg Paradoxes:
40 Years Later.” The author attended this lecture in this occasion, but he
described decision-making research only a little and spoke for an extended
time to deliver his anti-war message.
In fact, Ellsberg is well-known also as a historic anti-war activist who
made an accusation against the problems of the Vietnam War. The following
gives a brief background in this regard. Ellsberg worked at a military-related
job at a research institute, The RAND Corporation, in 1959, and joined the
U.S. Department of Defense in 1964. After serving as a special assistant to the
Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs of the
Department of Defense, he was sent to Vietnam in 1965. In 1967, he returned
to The RAND Corporation as a fellow researcher while working under Robert
McNamara, then Secretary of Defense. While working at these jobs, he
gradually became skeptical of the direction of the Vietnam War. In 1969,
he began making copies of secret documents, eventually collecting 7,000
pages that vividly reﬂected the history of the U.S. government’s deception of
the people. In 1971, he handed the copied documents to the media such as the
Washington Post and New York Times for informing people of the truth.

In Problem 1 of the Allais paradox, selecting Alternative A provides a deﬁnite
gain of $1 million and Alternative B is a selection of a lottery that results in a gain of
$5 million with a probability of 10 %, $1 million with a probability of 89 %, or $0
(no prize money) with a probability of 1 % (see Chap. 6). Alternative A can be
broken down into $1 million with a probability of 10 %, $1 million with a
probability of 89 %, and $1 million with a probability of 1 %. Consequently, the
common factor between A and B is that $1 million can be gained with a probability
of at least 89 %. If Alternative A is expressed as p and Alternative B as q, and a
lottery that offers $5 million with a probability of ten-elevenths (10/11) while
providing no gain at all with a probability of one-eleventh (1/11) is expressed
as t, the relations can be expressed as
p ¼ 0:11p þ 0:89p and
q ¼ 0:11t þ 0:89p:
Therefore, according to the independence axiom, if p  t, then p  q will result.
Problem 2 involves two lotteries—Alternative C, which offers $1 million
with a probability of 11 %, and Alternative D, which offers $5 million with a

probability of 10 %. They share a common factor that there is at least 89 %
probability of gaining nothing at all. If Alternative C is expressed as r, Alternative
D as s, and a lottery that deﬁnitely provides $0 as t0, then the relations are expressed
as shown below.
r ¼ 0:11p þ 0:89t0
s ¼ 0:11t þ 0:89t0
Therefore, if p  t, then r  s, based on the independence axiom.
The discussion up to this point can be summarized that the independence axiom
demands that if p  t, then p  q and r  s, and if t  p, then p  q and s  r. In
the actual selection however, the test subjects express p  q and s  r (Slovic and
Tversky 1974), which therefore does not satisfy the independence axiom.
1.2
Independence Axiom Under Uncertainty
The independence axiom under uncertainty is the following (Tamura et al. 1997):
ﬁrst, we assume that X is the set of results, Θ is the set of states of nature, A  Θ
represents events, and two alternatives are f : Θ ! X and g : Θ ! X. The inde-
pendence axiom demands that if f(θ) ¼ g(θ) for arbitrary θ =2 A, then the
preference relation between f and g is independent of a complementary event Ac.
Therefore, if the independence cannot be established, the following is true.
If certain alternatives f, g, f 0, and g0 are θ ∈A for a given event A, then f(θ) ¼ f 0(θ)
and g(θ) ¼ g0(θ); furthermore, if θ =2 A when f(θ) ¼ g(θ) and f 0(θ) ¼ g0(θ), then
g0 ≿f 0 in spite of f  g.
Let us explain this point using the Ellsberg paradox. We know that a total of
90 balls are placed in a pot, of which 30 are red and 60 are a mix of black and yellow
balls. The composition ratio of the black and yellow balls is unknown. In this
problem of decision-making under uncertainty, the decision-maker is assumed to
confront some type of probability p. In Problem 1, Alternative A is a gamble that
results in a gain of $100 if a red ball (r) comes out and $0 if any other color such as
black (b) or yellow (y) comes out. Alternative B is a gamble that yields a gain of
$100 if a black ball (b) comes out and $0 when any other color emerges. When
Alternative A is expressed as f and Alternative B is expressed as g:

Because p is a probability, additivity holds for mutually exclusive events.

Similarly, Problem 2 assumes Alternative C constituting a gamble that yields a
gain of $100 if a red or yellow ball (r or y) comes out and $0 if any other color comes
out. The other Alternative D is a gamble that provides $100 for a black or yellow
ball (b or y) that comes out and $0 for any other color. Because the preference is
g0  f 0 when Alternative C is expressed as f 0 and Alternative D as g0, then
g0  f 0 , p b
ð Þ > p rð Þ must hold true:
This result clearly contradicts p(r) > p(b) and indicates that g  f and g0  f 0
cannot be established simultaneously. The result also suggests that expected utility
theory cannot explain the Ellsberg paradox irrespective of how the subjective
probability is set.
The fact that the Ellsberg paradox does not satisfy the independence axiom in
decision-making under uncertainty is evident in Table 7.1. In other words, the
invalidity of independence means that, given that alternatives f, g, f 0, and g0 are
θ ∈A for a given event A (red, or black), then f(θ) ¼ f 0(θ) and g(θ) ¼ g0(θ).
Furthermore, if θ =2 A (if θ is yellow), then g0  f 0 when f(θ) ¼ g(θ) and
f 0(θ) ¼ g0(θ) in spite of f  g. Therefore, the Ellsberg paradox indicates g0  f 0
in spite of f  g and therefore does not satisfy the independence axiom.

Non-additive Probability and Nonlinear Utility Theory
Both the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes can be understood as being caused by the
empirical invalidity of the independence axiom. Various theoretical frameworks
explain such paradoxes (Camerer et al. 2004; Einhorn and Hogarth 1986;
Nakamura 1992; Takemura 2000; Seo 1994; Tamura et al. 1997; Takemura 1996a).

Non-additive Probability and Nonlinear Utility Theory

A salient example is the explanation based on nonlinear utility theory that has
relaxed the independence axiom and other factors. This body of theory forms the
generalization of expected utility theory (Starmer 2000; Tamura et al. 1997).
Although this body of theory is called nonlinear utility theory (Fishburn 1988;
Edwards 1992) or generalized expected utility theory (Quiggin 1993) in the ﬁeld of
economics, it is nearly equivalent to the body of theory related to fuzzy integrals in
fuzzy measure theory in the ﬁeld of engineering (Sugeno and Murofushi 1993).
The body of nonlinear utility theory often assumes a non-additive probability
weighting function that converts probabilities for which additivity does not hold
even if probability information is given for decision-making under risk, such as in
the case of the Allais paradox. In the case of the Ellsberg paradox, non-additive
probabilities in which additivity does not hold for the measure of subjective belief
in a state of nature are formulated.
A non-additive probability is sometimes expressed as a “capacity,” but is called,
in some cases, “fuzzy measure” in the ﬁeld of engineering. Its mathematical
deﬁnition is the same despite the varying names. A non-additive probability refers
to a set function, π : 2Ω ! [0,1] from an aggregate consisting of a subsets of a
nonempty set, Ω, to a closed interval, [0,1], which is also a set function that satisﬁes
both a boundedness condition (π(ϕ) ¼ 0, π(Ω) ¼ 1) and a monotonicity condition
(if the relation of subsets E and F of Ω is E  F, then relation π(E)  π(F) is
satisﬁed). A non-additive probability is so named because it does not necessarily
satisfy the conditions of additivity.
In the problems of Ellsberg, too, if boundedness conditions π(ϕ) ¼ 0 and
π(r [ b [ y) ¼ 1 are assumed and additionally a monotonicity condition is
assumed for the assessment of probability, then the paradox does not necessarily
occur. Whereas relations such as π(r [ b [ y) > π(b [ y) > π(r) > π(ϕ) must
be satisﬁed based on the monotonicity condition, even assumptions such as
π(r) ¼ 1/3, π(b [ y) ¼ 2/3, π(b) < 1/3, and π(r [ y) < 2/3 would not deviate
from the conditions of non-additive probability. Therefore, no contradiction
occurs in problems 1 and 2 of Ellsberg. In this case, however, this non-additive
probability is π(r) + π(b) < π(y [ b), π(y) + π(r [ b) < π(y [ r [ b), which
satisﬁes the conditions of superadditivity.
In expected utility theory, although the criterion of expected utility maximiza-
tion can be viewed from the perspective of Lebesgue integration related to a
probability measure, there are a few ways of integral expression other than
Lebesgue integration for the expected utility related to a non-additive probability
as deﬁned above. In the ﬁeld of fuzzy measure theory in engineering, integrals are
expressed in a few ways in view of fuzzy integrals (Sugeno and Murofushi 1993).
Of these expressions, those that are studied enthusiastically by researchers of
nonlinear utility theory and fuzzy theory are the expected utility using Choquet
integrals (Choquet 1954). The expected utility theory based on this integral is also
called rank-dependent utility theory.
The expected utility using Choquet integrals can be expressed as follows
(Quiggin 1993; Camerer 1995): ﬁrst, we assume that a state of nature θi ∈Ω is
ranked as u( f(θ1)) > u( f(θ2)) >    > u( f(θn)) according to the utility u( f(θi)) of
82

the result f(θi) of an alternative, f. The expected utility using Choquet integrals on a

:
If π is an additive measure and a state of nature θi is mutually exclusive, then the
expected utility shown above becomes consistent with that in subjective expected
utility theory (Camerer 1995).
Are non-additive probabilities appropriate as a measure for assessment of peo-
ple’s subjective uncertainty? To begin with the conclusion, even a non-additive
probability assuming only monotonicity without the condition of additivity might be
too difﬁcult in its psychological aspects. The condition of monotonicity is not
as mathematically difﬁcult as a probability measure that assumes additivity and
might be regarded as applicable, in general, to people’s judgment. Psychologically,
however, cases in which the condition of monotonicity is invalid are occasionally
observed.
Tversky and Kahneman (1983) found that when given a description of an
intelligent and active 31-year-old single woman called Linda, more test subjects
estimated that the probability of an event that “she is currently a bank teller and is
enthusiastic about women’s rights movement” would be higher than the probability
of the event that “she is currently a bank teller.” This result means that the subjective
probability, π(t \ w), of the product set of the event, (t), that Linda is a bank teller
and the event, (w), that she is enthusiastic about the women’s rights movement is
assessed higher than the subjective probability (π(t)) that she is a bank teller.
However, assuming that a subjective probability satisﬁes the condition of monoto-
nicity, then the subjective probability of a product event must be below the subjec-
tive probability of a single event (because π(t \ w)  min(π(t), π(w)) based on the
condition of monotonicity). Therefore, the result implies that the assessment of
many of the test subjects in their study deviated from the condition of monotonicity.
Such assessment is named a conjunction fallacy as a bias in the judgment of a
conjunctive event and has been eagerly studied by psychologists. This conjunction
fallacy has been found to occur easily even in the judgment that allows the
ambiguity of fuzzy rating for expressing a probability with an interval such as an
upper limit and lower limit (Takemura 1996b). Probability judgment that does
not satisfy such monotonicity means that the expression with a non-additive
probability assuming monotonicity has a limitation as a descriptive theory.
Murofushi et al. (1994) proposes a Choquet integral of a measure that has a
non-monotonous nature, and empirical research on the judgment and decision-
making based on this theory is expected to develop in the future.
Although the expression of expected utility using Choquet integrals is also
adopted in the body of fuzzy theory and expected utility theory, it is also used in
the body of psychological descriptive theory of decision-making called prospect
theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979; Tversky and Kahneman 1992).

3
Basic Assumptions of Prospect Theory
Prospect theory was proposed by Kahneman and Tversky, which combines
the knowledge of behavioral decision-making theory and nonlinear utility theory
(or, generalized expected utility theory). Prospect theory was proposed initially as a
descriptive theory that handles decision-making under risk (Kahneman and Tversky
1979). It was subsequently developed into a theory that can explain decision-
making under uncertainty (Tversky and Kahneman 1992).
The word prospect in prospect theory refers to the various results of selecting an
alternative and combinations of probabilities that correspond to the results, which is
equivalent to the “gamble” in decision-making under risk. In decision-making
under risk, a desirable prospect is selected from several prospects. In other words,
assuming the set X ¼ {x1, . . ., xj, . . ., xm} of results that occur, this can be replaced
with a problem of which of the probability distributions, p1 ¼ [p11, p12, . . ., p1m],
p2 ¼ [p21, p22, . . ., p2m], . . ., pl ¼ [pl1, pl2, . . ., plm] on X is selected. At this point,
one prospect is expressed as
(x1, pl1; . . .; xj, plj; . . .; xm, plm). Prospect theory
assumes that this prospect is assessed in a way that differs from expected
utility theory.
In prospect theory, the decision-making process is divided into the editing phase,
in which a problem is recognized and the framework for decision-making is
determined, and the evaluation phase, in which alternatives are evaluated according
to the recognition of the problem (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). The former phase
is situation-dependent and varies depending even on a slight difference in linguistic
expressions. In the latter phase, on the other hand, evaluation and decision-making
are independent of the situation once a problem is identiﬁed.
3.1
Editing Phase
The editing phase is a stage at which alternatives are cognitively restructured, and
the recognition even of the same decision-making problem varies depending on the
framing of the problem, which can change because of even a slight difference in
linguistic expressions. In the editing phase, mental operations including (1) coding,
(2) combination, (3) segregation, (4) cancellation, (5) simpliﬁcation, and (6) detec-
tion of dominance are conducted.
1. Coding is a mental operation that divides results into either a gain or loss. This is
a case, for example, in which a part-time worker usually making $8 per hour
would perceive a sudden raise to $9 per hour as a gain and a cut to $7 per hour as
a loss. In this case, the normal wage of $8 per hour functions as a reference point.
2. Combination is a mental operation in which the same gains are combined and
simpliﬁed. For example, the prospect (200, 0.25; 200, 0.25) in which a proba-
bility of gaining $200 is 0.25 and another probability of gaining $200 is 0.25 can
be edited as the prospect (200, 0.50) whose probability of gaining $200 is 0.50.
84

Preference Paradox and Nonlinear Expected Utility Theory

3. Segregation is a mental operation that separates the portion of deﬁnite gain
and the portion of risky gain. For example, the prospect (300, 0.80; 200, 0.20) in
which a probability of gaining $300 is 0.80 and a probability of gaining $200 is
0.20 presents a separation between the prospect (200, 1.00) with a deﬁnite gain of
$200 and the prospect (100, 0.80) entailing a probability of gaining $100 (0.80).
4. Cancellation is a mental operation in which two prospects being compared
are perceived with common elements being ignored. For example, the prospect
(200, 0.20; 100, 0.50;  50, 0.30) and the prospect (200, 0.20; 150, 0.50;
 100, 0.30) are perceived by being reduced to the prospect (100, 0.50;
 50, 0.30) and the prospect (150, 0.50;  100, 0.30).
5. Simpliﬁcation is a mental operation that rounds and simpliﬁes results and their
probabilities. For example, the prospects (101,0.49) are simpliﬁed to (100,0.50)
to be understood.
6. Detection of dominance is a mental operation in which dominant alternatives
are detected. If, for example, the send elements of both the prospect (500, 0.20;
101, 0.49) and the prospect (500, 0.15; 99, 0.51) are simpliﬁed to (100, 0.50),
the comparison would be between the prospects (500, 0.20) and (500, 0.15); the
former is found to be dominant over the latter.
3.2
Evaluation Phase
Each prospect is restructured in the editing phase, based on which the prospect that
has been evaluated the highest is selected in the evaluation phase. In the evaluation
phase, the prospects are evaluated based on a type of utility function that they call
the value function and the probability weighting function. This method of evaluat-
ing in the evaluation phase is basically the same as the rank-dependent utility theory
in nonlinear utility theory.
As depicted in Fig. 7.1, the value function is a concave function in the area of
gain and thus risk-averse and is a convex function in the area of loss and risk-taking.
In addition, the slope of the value function is generally steeper in the area if
loss than in the area of gain, which implies that a loss would have a greater impact
than a gain.
A special aspect of prospect theory is the assumption that the part corresponding
to the origin of utility theory is the reference point, which easily shifts depending on
how the decision-making problem is edited in the editing phase. In prospect theory,
the results are evaluated based on their deviation from the reference point
representing the psychological origin; the decision-maker evaluates the results
either as a gain or loss. Furthermore, prospect theory assumes the decision-maker’s
evaluation of a gain as risk aversion and a loss as risk-taking. Even the same
decision-making problem shows risk-aversion when the alternatives are perceived
in the area of gain; it also shows risk taking when in the area of loss.
Moreover, a non-additive probability weighting function in prospect theory is
π(0) ¼ 0, π(1) ¼ 1, whose form is presented in Fig. 7.2. Assuming that this

probability weighting function is π and the objective probability is p, this proba-

It satisﬁes the condition of π( p) + π(1  p)  1.

Preference Paradox and Nonlinear Expected Utility Theory

Finally, the method of prospect evaluation in prospect theory can be described as
follows: According to Kahneman and Tversky (1979), assuming that x and y are the
results, p and q are the probabilities of each respective result, π( p) and π(q) are
the probability weights for p and q, and v(x) and v(y) are the values of each result,
the value of evaluated prospect V(x,p;y,q) is the following:
If any one of p + q < 1, x  0  y or x  0  y holds and v(0) ¼ 0, then
V(x, p; y, q) ¼ π( p)v(x) + π(q)v(y).
If p + q ¼ 1 and x > y > 0 or x < y < 0, then
V(x, p; y, q) ¼ v(y) + π( p)(v(x)  v(y)) holds.
Forecasting based on prospect and theory and research on this subject will be
described in the next chapter.

Prospect Theory and Decision-Making
Phenomena
Prospect theory, proposed by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992), is a theory that combines the knowledge of behavioral decision
theory and nonlinear utility theory (or generalized expected utility theory). This
chapter ﬁrst reports the forecasts derived from the basic assumptions of prospect
theory and empirical examples of such forecasts. It subsequently provides an
overview of a new version of cumulative prospect theory that explains decision-
making not only under risk but also under uncertainty and in light of experimental
research into this theory.

Empirical Research on the Value Function
and Reﬂection Effect
Prospect theory assumes that the value function v(x) is a concave function
(a function that is concave downward) in the area of gain above the reference
point and is a convex function (a function that is convex downward) in the area of
loss below the reference point, which is v00(x) < 0 when x > 0 and v00(x) > 0 when
x < 0. This relation reﬂects the decision-maker’s risk-averse behavior in the area of
gain and risk-taking behavior in the area of a loss.
Kahneman and Tversky (1979) distributed questionnaires to students and
instructors at universities in Israel, the U.S., and Sweden and examined this
assumption related to the value function.
Problem 1 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
A. a gain of $4,000 with a probability of 80 % (Prospect A ¼ (4000, 0.80))
B. a certain gain of $3,000 (Prospect B ¼ (3000, 1.00))

Problem 2 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
C. a loss of $4,000 with a probability of 80 % (Prospect C ¼ (4000, 0.80))
D. a certain loss of $3,000 (Prospect D ¼ (3000, 1.00))
For Problem 1, 20 % of 95 respondents selected A; 80 % preferred B. Regarding
Problem 2, 92 % of 95 respondents preferred C; 8 % opted for D. This pattern of the
majority selection is consistent with the forecasts of prospect theory that are risk-
averse in the area of gain and risk-taking in the area of loss. Such a phenomenon in
which the risk attitude is reversed between the areas of gain and loss is called the
reﬂection effect.
Kahneman and Tversky also reported, based on the response patterns below, the
phenomenon in which preference is reversed by the reﬂection effect even for
prospects that have identical ﬁnal results.
Problem 3 You ﬁrst receive $1,000. Select either of the alternatives below.
A. a gain of $1,000 with a probability of 50 % (Prospect A ¼ (1000, 0.50))
B. a certain gain of $500 (Prospect B ¼ (500, 1.00))
Problem 4 You ﬁrst receive $2,000. Select either of the alternatives below.
C. a loss of $1,000 with a probability of 50 % (Prospect C ¼ (1000, 0.50))
D. a certain loss of $500 (Prospect D ¼ (500, 1.00))
Of 70 test subjects who responded to Problem 3, 16 % selected A; 84 %
chose B. Of 68 test subjects who responded to Problem 4, 69 % preferred C;
31 % opted for D. This pattern of the majority selection is consistent with the
forecasts of prospect theory that are risk-averse in the area of gain and risk-taking
in the area of loss.
Focusing only on the ﬁnal results, Problems 3 and 4 prove to be identical.
In other words, the ﬁnal results of A (¼(2000, 0.50; 1000, 0.50)) and C and those
of B (¼(1500, 1.00)) and D are the same. This result suggests that the test subjects
did not take the $1,000 and $2,000 initially received into consideration when
making the judgment. Such an experimentally obtained result demonstrates that
people make a judgment and decision based on the change from the reference point
rather than the amount of the ﬁnal assets and become risk-taking or risk-averse
depending on the case.
Toshino (2004) explains the behavior of stock investment as an example of
the value function of prospect theory. He used an example in which the price of
stocks purchased for ¥1,000 (approximately $10) per share rises to ¥2,000
(approximately $20) and then drops to ¥1,500 (approximately $15), and despite
the gain of ¥500 (approximately $5) per share from the purchase price, the
stockholder keeps the stocks rather than selling it. This case is perceived as a
loss of ¥500 (approximately $5) if the reference point is ¥2,000 (approximately
$20), which tends to result eventually in a person’s retaining the stocks without
selling them. The act of retaining the stocks is more risk-taking than selling
them to realize the gain or loss, which is, thereby, consistent with prospect
theory. Furthermore, prospect theory states that the ¥500 (approximately $5) is
90

Prospect Theory and Decision-Making Phenomena

perceived as a gain if the reference point is ¥1,000 (approximately $10), which
often results in a risk-averse attitude and sale of the stocks.
A phenomenon that can be interpreted as indicating the reﬂection effect based on
such a value function has been observed in the actual stock market. Odean (1998)
analyzed stock trading data and reported that the period of keeping ownership of
stocks was a median of 104 days when a gain was realized and 124 days when a loss
was incurred. This result can be interpreted as showing that investors tend to
become risk-averse and quickly sell their stocks when they are proﬁtable. They
become risk-taking and hold on to their stocks for a long period of time when the
stocks represent a loss to the holder (Camerer 2000).
Such a pattern of investment behavior is known in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance as the
disposition effect (Shefrin and Statman 1985; Toshino 2004). This disposition
effect is found not only in the ﬁeld of ﬁnance, but in the housing market. In other
words, by this phenomenon, the period for which homeowners retain their homes
rather than selling them is longer while a loss is incurred because a decline in the
housing prices has been reported, which is explainable with the disposition effect
(Camerer 2000).
2
Empirical Research on the Value Function
and Loss Aversion
The value function of prospect theory in the area of loss has a slope that is steeper
than that in the area of gain, which, therefore, is v0(x) < v0(x) when x > 0, where
v0 is the derivative of the value function, v. That result implies that the impact of a
loss is greater than that of a gain, which is called loss aversion.
From the property of loss aversion assumed in prospect theory, avoidance of a
gamble with zero expected value is derived. For instance, in the selection of either
a gamble for a gain of $10,000 with a probability of 50 % or a loss of $10,000 with a
probability of 50 % (the expected value is $0) or not gambling at all (the expected
value is $0), the option of not gambling results from the property of loss aversion.
When x > y > 0, the prospect (y, 0.50; y, 0.50) is preferred to the prospect
(x, 0.50; x, 0.50) (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). In other words, both

can be derived.

A phenomenon related to this is the problem of the equity premium in the ﬁeld of
ﬁnance. Because the price ﬂuctuations in the stock market are greater than those in
the bond market, if the same return can be expected, in general, investment in bonds
is likely to be preferred. This outcome is consistent with the property of loss
aversion described earlier. Benartzi and Thaler (1995) authored a hypothesis
based on the property of loss aversion of prospect theory that investments that
can cause a large loss despite a potentially large proﬁt such as the case of stocks are
valued low, which explained the very high excess proﬁtability (premium) in the
stock market.
One of the phenomena that can be derived from the property of loss aversion is
the endowment effect (Kahneman et al. 1990, 1991), which is a phenomenon by
which the selling price of certain goods that are given and retained becomes higher
than the purchase price in the case where the goods are not given. Put in simple
terms, this is a phenomenon by which the goods that are initially retained become
difﬁcult to give away, which is interpreted in some cases as expressing the status
quo bias.
Kahneman et al. conducted a series of experiments to verify the endowment
effect. In one such experiment, they ﬁrst randomly divided 77 students from Simon
Fraser University into three groups: the “sell” condition group, “buy” condition
group, and “select” condition group (Kahneman et al. 1990). The test subjects in the
“sell” condition group were given coffee mugs and asked at what price they would
sell them. The test subjects in the “buy” condition group were asked at what price
they would buy those mugs, and those in the “select” condition group were
provided with various prices and asked whether they would select the mugs or
prefer to receive cash.
As a result, the median price of the “sell” condition group was $7.12, that of the
“buy” condition group was $2.87, and that of the “select” condition group was
$3.12. Such price disparity is considered attributable to the reference point that was
the state of possessing the mugs for the “sell” condition group and the state of not
possessing the mugs for the “buy” and “select” condition groups.

Empirical Research on Probability Weighting Function
According to prospect theory, the probability is overvalued when the probability
is very low, resulting in the relation, π( p) > p. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
asked the university students and instructors who were their test subjects the
following questions and examined this assumption about the probability weighting
function.
Problem 1 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
A. a gain of $5,000 with a probability of 0.1 % (Prospect A ¼ (5000, 0.001))
B. a certain gain of $5 (Prospect B ¼ (5, 1.00))
92

Prospect Theory and Decision-Making Phenomena

Problem 2 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
C. a loss of $5,000 with a probability of 0.1 % (Prospect C ¼ (5000, 0.001))
D. a certain loss of $5 (Prospect D ¼ (5, 1.00))
Of 72 test subjects, 72 % selected A and 28 % chose B for Problem 1. In
addition, 17 % opted for C and 83 % preferred D for Problem 2.
This result reveals that, in Problem 1, the test subjects preferred the gamble for a
proﬁt with a very low probability more than the amount of expected value. In
Problem 2, the test subjects preferred the amount of expected value to the gamble
with a very low probability of a loss.
Based on the response pattern of most of the test subjects in Problem 1, the
relation
π 0:001
ð
Þv 5000
ð
Þ > v 5
ð Þ
is presented. Assuming that the value function, v, of prospect theory is a concave
function in the area of gain, the following relation holds.
π 0:001
ð
Þ >

ð Þ
v 5000
ð

Similarly, based on the result of Problem 2, the relation
π 0:001
ð

is indicated. Assuming that the value function v of prospect theory is a convex
function in the area of loss, the following relation holds.
π 0:001
ð
Þ >
v 5
ð
Þ
v 5000
ð
Þ > 0:001
This result demonstrates that a probability is overvalued when it is very low and
the relation, π( p) > p, is formed.
Subsequently, prospect theory assumes that non-proportionality, π(pqr)/π(pr) >
π(pq)/π( p) holds for a probability 0  p, q, r  1. Kahneman and Tversky (1979)
asked their test subjects the following questions and examined this property.
Problem 3 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
A. a gain of $6,000 with a probability of 45 % (Prospect A ¼ (6000, 0.45))
B. a gain of $3,000 with a probability of 90 % (Prospect B ¼ (3000, 0.90))
Problem 4 Which one of the following alternatives is preferred to the other?
C. a gain of $6,000 with a probability of 0.1 % (Prospect C ¼ (6000, 0.001))
D. a gain of $3,000 with a probability of 0.2 % (Prospect D ¼ (3000, 0.002))

Of 66 test subjects who responded to Problem 3, 14 % selected A and 86 %
chose B. Of 66 test subjects who responded to Problem 4, 73 % preferred C and
27 % opted for D. Assuming that the value function, v, is a concave function in the
area of gain based on the results of Problems 3 and 4, the relation

relation

is found to hold true.
A few phenomena are explainable by the property of the probability weighting
function of prospect theory (Camerer 2000; Tada 2003). The ﬁrst is the favorite
longshot bias in horse racing. As reported by Thaler and Ziemba (1988), although
the expected dividend yield of a long shot with an extremely low probability of
winning is much lower than that of betting on the favorite, people are generally
willing to bet on a long shot at the races, which is explainable by the characteristics
of the probability weighting function that indicates an overvalued probability when
the probability is very low. Similarly, the impulses of many people to purchase
lottery and lotto tickets are explainable by the characteristics of the probability
weighting function.
Furthermore, the reason for numerous people to purchase insurance policies is
explainable by the characteristics of the probability weighting function.
Phone line repair insurance, for instance, is 45 cents per month although the
repair cost is $60 and the expected cost of the repair is only 26 cents per month
(Chiccheti and Dubin 1994). As this illustrates, the phenomenon of buying insur-
ance coverage is explainable by the interpretation of prospect theory that the weight
of an event whose probability is low grows larger.

Cumulative Prospect Theory
In the initial paper in 1979, prospect theory was a model to express decision-making
under risk (Kahneman and Tversky 1979). In the subsequent paper in 1992, it was
expanded to a model that expressed decision-making under uncertainty including
ambiguity and risk, which was called cumulative prospect theory (Tversky and
Kahneman 1992). Cumulative prospect theory can be interpreted as a type of rank-
dependent nonlinear expected utility theory (Quiggin 1993; Starmer 2000; Tamura
et al. 1997).
94
8
Prospect Theory and Decision-Making Phenomena

First, the elements of a decision-making problem are deﬁned. Assuming that
X is a set of results and assuming that Θ is a set of states of nature, the prospect
(alternatives) under uncertainty is deﬁned as f : Θ ! X. In other words, we
consider that such a function that becomes f(θ) ¼ x exists if x ∈X results
under a state of nature, as θ ∈Θ. For simpliﬁcation, however, the result
x ∈X is assumed to be a monetary value. For example, f is a lottery that
gives $100 (x1) if a roll of the dice yields an odd number and $200 (x2) if an
even number comes out.
As preparation for considering cumulative prospect theory, the results are
ranked in order of increase in the desirability of the results. For example, the
increase in the desirability is arranged from $100, $200, and $400. . . according to
the result. This method of deriving the comprehensive assessment based on the
rankings of the desirability of results is basically the same as the case of obtaining
the rank-dependent nonlinear expected utility through the Choquet integral
(Choquet 1954). In fact, cumulative prospect theory also uses the Choquet
integral.
Assuming also that {θi} is a subset of Θ and that xi results if θi occurs, the
prospect, f, can be expressed with a line of pairs of (xi, θi). The case of rolling the
dice described earlier, for instance, can be expressed as Prospect f($100; odd
number; $200, even number). In this case, too, the states of nature corresponding
to the results are lined up according to the order of desirability of the results.
Cumulative prospect theory assumes that the value function differs between
the area of gain and area of loss. Therefore, f + as a prospect with a positive
result and f  as a prospect with a negative result are distinguished. Therefore, if
f(θ) > 0, then f +(θ) ¼ f (θ); if f (θ)  0, then f +(θ) ¼ 0; if f(θ) < 0, then f (θ) ¼
f (θ); and if f (θ)  0, then f (θ) ¼ 0. In the earlier case of the dice, f +(θ1) ¼ $100,
f +(θ2) ¼ $200, f (θ1) ¼ $0, and f (θ2) ¼ $0.
As with expected utility theory, if Prospect f is strictly preferred over
Prospect g or is indiscriminate, we consider a function that becomes
v( f )  v(g) and assume that the comprehensive assessment can be derived
with the sum of the functions of the prospect in the area of gain and the
prospect in the area of loss.

Expected utility theory considers an additive set function related to a set of states
of nature just as in the case of the body of subjective expected utility of Savage
(1954). Cumulative prospect theory, however, considers a non-additive set function
from generalized probability measures, which is equivalent to the “capacity” and
“fuzzy measure” described in the previous chapter. In other words, it is a set
function, W : 2Θ ! [0,1] from an aggregate consisting of subsets of a nonempty
set, Θ, of states of nature to a closed interval, [0,1]. Additionally, the boundedness
conditions, W(ϕ) ¼ 0, W(Θ) ¼ 1, and a monotonicity condition (a relation in
4
Cumulative Prospect Theory

which when a subset, Ai, of Θ is a subset of Aj, i.e., Ai  Aj, W(Ai)  W(Aj)) are is
satisﬁed. If, for instance, the degrees of belief that 1, 2, and 3 will be rolled on the
dice are 0.1 for each and the degree of belief that odd numbers will be rolled is 0.4,
then the additivity condition of probability measures is not satisﬁed but the mono-
tonicity condition is satisﬁed.
Cumulative prospect theory assumes that the narrow sense of the monotonically
increasing function, v : X ! Re is considered the value function and is normalized
to satisfy v(x0) ¼ v(0) ¼ 0. For instance, whereas such a function as v(x) ¼ 2x0.8
might be presumed as a speciﬁc example, the value function is often discussed in
general terms just as when explaining the utility function. The comprehensive
assessment, V( f ), of the prospect is explained using the sum of V( f +) and V( f )
as described earlier, and V( f +) and V( f ) are further speciﬁed as shown below.

The above equations are explained brieﬂy in the following. First, the decision-
making weight πþ
i concerns the area of gain, in which the results are positive, and is
the difference between the non-additive probability of an event that produces a
result that is at least equally desirable as xi and the non-additive probability of an
event that produces a result that is more desirable than xi. The decision-making
weight, π
i , concerns negative results and is the difference between the non-additive
probability of an event that produces a result that is at least equally desirable as xi
and the non-additive probability of an event that produces a result that is less
desirable than xi. If each W is additive, then W is a probability measure and πi is
simply the probability of Ai.

Subsequently, cumulative prospect theory is explainable as follows. If the
prospect, f ¼ (xi, Ai) is given by the probability distribution, p(Ai) ¼ pi, it becomes
a problem of decision making under risk, and the prospect can be expressed as
f ¼ (xi, pi). The decision weight for this problem of decision making under risk is

We consider the following situation to present an example of prospect theory
under risk (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). If the number rolled once on the dice is
x, then x ¼ 1, . . ., 6. We consider a game in which we gain $ x if x is an even
number and pay $ x if it is an odd number. Then, f can be thought to be a prospect
that produces the results of (5,  3,  1, 2, 4, 6) with a probability of 1/6 for
each result. This inference then engenders the expressions f + ¼ (0, 1/2, 2, 1/6;
4, 1/6, 6, 1/6) and f ¼ (5, 1/6,  3, 1/6;  1, 1/6, 0, 1/2) because the probability
of $0 in f + is the probability of an odd number, which is 1/2, the probabilities of
gaining $2, $4, and $6 are 1/6 each, the probabilities of gaining  $5 ,  $3, and
 $1 in f are 1/6 each, and the probability of $0 is the probability of an even
number, which is 1/2. Therefore, the following can be derived.

This relation is expressed in Fig. 8.1. The V( f +) is the area on the left-hand side

ment in cumulative prospect theory can be derived as follows: First, the weight of

probability of gaining $2 or more and the weight, w, of the probability of gaining $4
or more. Other weights π are obtainable in the same manner. The sum of products of
this π and the value v engenders the comprehensive assessment.

Experiments on Cumulative Prospect Theory
Tversky and Kahneman (1992) conducted selection experiments by presenting
various prospects on computers to a total of 25 graduate students at Stanford and
Berkeley and estimated the value function of cumulative prospect theory. They
presented such prospects as the probability of gaining $150 was 25% and the
probability of gaining $50 was 75%. They also compared such prospects with
deﬁnite prospects and conducted experiments of selecting desirable ones. They
assumed the following power functions as value functions.

Based on the results of the selection in this experiment, they performed a
nonlinear regression analysis and estimated 0.88 for both α and β and 2.55 for λ.
The fact that the estimated values of α and β are less than 1 indicates that the value
function is concave downward in the area of gain and convex downward in the area
of loss. The estimated value of λ suggests that the loss has an impact that is
approximately twice as great as that of a proﬁt, implying the strong nature of loss
aversion.
They further considered the following functions as speciﬁc decision weight
functions, W+ and W, of cumulative prospect theory, and estimated the form of
the decision weight functions illustrated in Fig. 8.2 from this selection experiment.

The Framing Effect and Its Descriptions

Chapter 9
The Framing Effect of Decision Making
The body of utility theory that explains the phenomenon of decision making has
developed new theories such as nonlinear utility theory to explain decision making
under uncertainty. There is, however, a phenomenon called the framing effect
which cannot be explained in its essence by the body of utility theory. The framing
effect refers to phenomena in which preference is reversed even for the same
decision making problem because of changes in perspectives resulting from differ-
ences in the linguistic expressions used to describe the decision making problem,
resulting in varied results of decision making.
This chapter reports the ﬁndings of studies of behavioral decision-making
theory, including the reasons underlying the inability of utility theory to explain
the framing effect, the observed intensity of the framing effect, and the types of
factors affecting the framing effect.
1
What Type of Phenomenon Is the Framing Effect?
The framing effect can be interpreted as a phenomenon in which the results of
decision making vary because of differences in the mental framework of under-
standing the decision making problem, i.e., the decision frame (Tversky and
Kahneman 1981).
We assume the following situation. A tumor was discovered in your lungs during
a medical checkup and your doctor has recommended that you have a surgery. Your
willingness to have the surgery is likely to vary substantially in the cases when your
doctor tells you, “I have performed the surgery on 1,000 patients in the past, of
whom 950 patients lived for more than ﬁve years. Why don’t you have the surgery,
too?” and when he says, “I have performed the surgery on 1,000 patients in the past,
of whom 50 patients died within ﬁve years. Why don’t you have the surgery, too?”
(Takemura 1996). The former expression presents a decision frame that emphasizes
survival, although the latter expression is a decision frame that emphasizes death.
The information provided by the former linguistic expression, rather than the latter,

Descriptions of Human Choice Behavior, DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-54580-4_9,

is likely to encourage more people to opt to undergo the surgery. The phenomenon
in which such a difference arises in the results of a decision is designated as the
framing effect.
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) were the ﬁrst to study this framing effect
systematically. They assumed the following decision making problem, which
would be an example of the framing effect research, for their investigation.
The problem of an Asian disease: “We assume that a peculiar Asian disease that
is expected to kill 600 people in the U.S. has broken out. Measures of two types
were proposed to cure this disease. The precise scientiﬁc estimates of these mea-
sures are presented below. Which one of the measures would you adopt?”
They ﬁrst divided 307 college students into two groups and presented the
alternatives using the following expressions to 152 students for the frame condi-
tions that emphasize survival (positive frame conditions).
Measure A: “Two hundred people will be saved if this measure is adopted.”
Measure B: “The probability that 600 people will be saved is one-third and the
probability that no one will be saved is two thirds if this measure is adopted.”
As a result, 72 % selected Measure A and 28 % opted for Measure B.
Meanwhile, they presented the following measures––which are frame conditions
for the same decision making problem but expressed in terms of mortality (negative
frame conditions)––to the remaining 155 students.
Measure C: “Four hundred people will die if this measure is adopted.”
Measure D: “The probability that no one will die is one-third and the probability
that 600 people will die is two thirds if this measure is adopted.”
Measures A and C and Measures B and D differ only in their expressions. The
extensionally recognizable meanings should be same despite the different expres-
sions. In other words, “being saved” is equivalent to “not dying” and “not being
saved” means “to die.” Nevertheless, those students who selected Measure C
comprised 22 % whereas those who chose Measure D were 78 %. This reversal
of selection patterns indicates the framing effect. Tversky and Kahneman (1981)
have reported that most test subjects use risk-averse selection (A ¼ C) when the
aspect of beneﬁt is emphasized in the expression such as positive frame conditions
and risk-taking selection (D ¼ B) when the aspect of the loss in the decision
problem is emphasized in the expression such as negative frame conditions.

Why Can Utility Theory Not Explain
the Framing Effect?
One of the most representative theories of decision making is utility theory, which
attempts to explain the overall decision making phenomena based on the concept of
utility. This utility theory dates back to Bernoulli in the 18th century. Although
numerous variations have been developed (Fishburn 1982, 1988; Schmeidler 1989;
104
9
The Framing Effect of Decision Making

Starmer 2000), it is a mathematical model based on the subjects deﬁned by factors
that allow objective observation and instruction (extensionally deﬁned subjects) as
do mathematical models in the natural sciences.
The existence of the framing effect means that different decisions are made even
for extensionally identical decision problems, which deviates from the principle of
description invariance (Arrow 1982) that the theoretical conclusion is the same if
the subject is extensionally deﬁned. Description invariance is therefore a principle
that demands no changes in the result resulting from the manner of speech and
description. Consequently, the framing effect cannot be explained in essence by
utility theory that assumes description invariance, which is explained more specif-
ically in the following using the example of decision making under certainty.
Imagine the case of decision making under certainty explained below (Takemura
1994b). Consider making the decision of selecting either fried rice or Tenshindon
(crab meat omelet on rice) at a Chinese restaurant. In this case, the utility refers to
the value of the real number that makes the utility of Tenshindon (u(Tenshindon))
greater than or equal to the utility of fried rice (u(fried rice)) when and only when
preferring fried rice to Tenshindon or equally liking both (fried rice ≿Tenshindon).
Therefore, the relation,
fried rice ≿Tenshindon , u fried rice
ð
Þ  u Tenshindon
ð
Þ,
holds true. We assume, at this point, that a “Tenshindon” refers in this Chinese
restaurant to a “Chinese-style egg bowl” and a “Chinese-style egg bowl” refers to a
“Tenshindon.” Then, according to description invariance, both the relations
fried rice ≿Tenshindon , fried rice ≿Chinese-style egg bowl
and u fried rice
ð
Þ  u Tenshindon
ð
Þ , u fried rice
ð
Þ  u Chinese-style egg bowl
ð
Þ
must be valid.
If the framing effect occurs and these relations cannot be established in such a
case as
fried rice ≿Tenshindon , fried rice ≺Chinese-style egg bowl,
then the relation becomes
u fried rice
ð
Þ  u Tenshindon
ð
Þ , u fried rice
ð
Þ < u Chinese-style egg bowl
ð
Þ
according to the deﬁnition of utility, which does not satisfy description invariance.
Consequently, if fried rice is preferred when the other dish is called Tenshindon but
the same dish is preferred to fried rice when it is called a Chinese-style egg bowl,
then neither of the preference relation or utility function satisﬁes description
invariance. Utility theory that assumes description invariance therefore cannot
explain the framing effect. This inability to explain is also true, in general, not
only in decision-making under certainty presented here, but also in nonlinear utility

theory under uncertainty. Therefore, the point underscores the inability of utility
theory to explain the framing effect.
Furthermore, the framing effect cannot be explained by any theory that assumes
description invariance in addition to utility theory, which suggests the difﬁculty of
explaining the framing effect using an extensionally deﬁnable set. Because of this,
the presence of the framing effect brings us the question of “what is a meaning?” The
same problem was introduced by Frege, the founder of the predicate logic, who noted
that “the morning star” signiﬁes Venus just as “the evening star” does. Therefore,
the situation of two utterances having the same meaning (Bedeutung), but having
different signiﬁcance (Sinn) lies under the purview of the problem of framing.
Although the framing effect appears to be very difﬁcult to treat in a theoretical
manner, as shown up to this point, the veriﬁcation of the effects and their explanation
using approximate descriptive theories have been achieved in various ways.
3
Framing in Social Life
The framing effect might be observed in various scenes in social life. This framing
effect has long been recognized in the world of market research professionals as the
wording effect of a slight change in the linguistic expressions of the questions that
would change the responses to the questions. It had been long known also in the world
of marketing professionals as the promotion effect of a variation in the linguistic
expressions used in advertisements: despite providing the same product information,
different linguistic expressions can drastically alter effects on sales. In consumer
behavior research, Kojima (1986) addressed the phenomenon that spending attitudes
vary depending on the context even for the same commodity. Kojima referred to
the effect of a “psychological wallet,” which is equivalent to the framing effect.
The framing effect can be detected easily ﬁrst in consumers’ decision making.
It is no secret that, in communication activities such as advertising and sales,
subtle differences in expressions having the same meaning in messages delivered
to consumers alter shoppers’ assessments, judgments, and purchase decisions.
Ground meat, for instance, is divisible into lean meat and fatty meat. We know
that consumers tend to assess the meat more favorably when it is labeled “75 % lean
meat” than when it is labeled “25 % fatty meat” (Levin and Gaeth 1988). The
framing effect can also be observed when making a decision to purchase auto
insurance. An example is a case of an insurance policy for which the premium is
$1,000 with a $600 deductible on each claim settlement and another insurance
policy for which the premium is $1,600 that covers damage of $600 and offers
$600 cash back to a policyholder with no accidents. Although both policies are
ultimately equivalent, we know that the latter is preferred by more people
(Johnson et al. 1993). In recent years, foreign-owned insurance companies have
been advertising such insurance policies as the latter that offer cash back, which is
also regarded as using the framing effect of consumers. Additionally, the framing
effect has been identiﬁed in physicians’ medical decision making (McNeil
et al. 1982) and business managers’ decision making (Qualls and Puto 1989).
106
9
The Framing Effect of Decision Making

The effect can be further detected in interpersonal interactions. Kelly and
Thibaut (1978) assumed the proﬁt matrix in their theory of interpersonal depen-
dency as a given matrix in an experiment game and concluded that people would
psychologically convert this matrix to an effective matrix before making a decision.
They pointed out that the conversion from the given matrix to an effective matrix in
interpersonal relationships included various types. The problem of converting from
the given matrix to an effective matrix argued by them can be regarded as a problem
of framing in interpersonal decision making.
The mode of framing by decision makers has been found to affect decision-
making signiﬁcantly also in experiment games (Colman 1995). Eiser and Bhavnani
(1974), for example, examined how decision making would vary as a result of
changes in the instructions for the situation of prisoner’s dilemma games with
identical structure. They instructed the test subjects under each set of conditions
on the situation setting as problems of economic negotiations, international negoti-
ations, and human relationships, and the game counterpart (a decoy) used a retribu-
tion strategy under all conditions in the experiments. The reported result was that the
percentage of participants selecting cooperation to achieve Pareto optimality was
higher when the test subjects were instructed as a problem of international negoti-
ations or human relationships rather than the problem of economic negotiations.
This experimentally obtained result is thought to indicate the framing effect.
The problem of framing is extremely important when considering decision-
making in disputes, which is particularly clariﬁed when considering the issue of
international disarmament (Tversky 1994). We assume that two countries are
negotiating the reduction of the number of missiles. Reducing the missiles of
one’s own country is perceived as a loss from the current conditions and reducing
the missiles of the other country is viewed as a beneﬁt. According to Tversky (1994),
the impact of a perceived loss is approximately twice the impact of a perceived
beneﬁt. Therefore, eliminating two missiles of the other country and eliminating one
missile of one’s own country presumably balances out. Agreement between the two
countries is therefore extremely difﬁcult because both negotiators could be expected
to regard the problem similarly. Although the idea of losing or gaining from the
current position might be acceptable in general, how the current position is under-
stood depends substantially on the framing of the situation of the problem.
4
Framing and Mental Accounting
This framing effect is interpreted as resulting from mental structuring of a decision
frame based on the linguistic expressions of a decision making problem and other
factors. How, then, is such a decision frame structured? Particularly in decision
making related to money, Tversky and Kahneman (1981) used the concept of
so-called mental accounting to explain how the decision frame was structured.
Mental accounting refers to the form used by people for cognitive processing of
monetary decision making problems, which is the state of “psychological wallet”
introduced by Kojima (1986).

Framing and Mental Accounting
107

4.1
Losing a Ticket and Mental Accounting
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) asked the following questions to 383 test subjects
and thereby examined the state of mental accounting. They asked 200 test subjects
the following question under the conditions of losing a ticket.
Conditions of losing a ticket: “Imagine the following scenario. You have decided to
go to see a movie and go to the theater after purchasing a ticket priced at $10. When
you are about to enter the theater, you notice that you have lost the ticket. Would
you buy another ticket?”
They asked the remaining 183 test subjects the following question under the
conditions of losing cash.
Conditions of losing cash: “Imagine the following scenario. You have decided to go to
seeamovieandgotothetheater.Theticketispricedat$10.Whenyouareabouttoenter
the theater, you notice that you have lost the $10 in cash. Would you buy the ticket?”
As a result of the questions, although 46 % of the test subjects under the
conditions of losing the ticket answered that they would buy another ticket, 88 %
of the test subjects under the conditions of losing the cash answered that they would
buy the ticket.
The point requiring attention here is the fact that, in both cases, the loss is
equivalent to $10 and the decision of whether to buy a ticket that is worth $10 must
be made. Tversky and Kahneman (1981) explain that the difference in the results is
attributable to the varied state of mental accounting between the conditions of
losing a ticket and losing cash. In other words, this can be interpreted as a situation
in which, although the conditions of losing the ticket require a purchase of another
ticket from the account of ticket expenditure (a type of psychological wallet), the
conditions of losing the cash do not cause the pain of buying two tickets because the
cash and ticket expenditures are in separate accounts, resulting in greater willing-
ness to purchase the ticket. Only the ticket account is used when purchasing the
ticket. Therefore, the loss of cash is regarded as having a moderate effect.
Consequently, Tversky and Kahneman (1981) conclude that mental accounting
tends to be conducted for each topic rather than constituting a comprehensive
monetary assessment.
4.2
Purchasing a Calculator and Mental Accounting
Tversky and Kahneman (1981) also asked 192 test subjects the following question
on the mental accounting of consumers. They asked 88 test subjects the question
below related to conditions surrounding the purchase of a $15 calculator.
Conditions of a $15 calculator: “Imagine the following situation. You are going to
purchase a $125 jacket and $15 calculator, but the store attendant tells you that the
$15 calculator is sold for $10 at a branch store that is 20 min by car from this store.
Would you go to the branch store to buy the calculator?”
108
9
The Framing Effect of Decision Making

They asked the remaining 93 test subjects the question below under the condi-
tions of a $125 calculator.
Conditions of a $125 calculator: “Imagine the following situation. You are going to
purchase a $125 calculator and $15 jacket, but the store attendant tells you that the
$125 calculator is sold for $120 at a branch store that is 20 min by car from this
store. Would you go to the branch store to buy the calculator?”
The two sets of conditions are common as a case of making a decision to
purchase a calculator and jacket and identical in the question of whether to do the
shopping of $140 in all or go to the branch to save $5 at the cost of driving a car for
20 min. As a result of the questions, although 68 % of the test subjects under the
former conditions of the $15 calculator answered that they would go to the branch
store, 29 % of the test subjects under the latter conditions of the $125 calculator
answered that they would go to the branch store.
This result might be attributable to the fact that the test subjects framed the two
decision-making problems separately rather than considering the purchase of the
calculator and the purchase of the jacket as a combination, which is another
indication that the state of mental accounting is not comprehensive; rather, each
topic is processed separately. Recognizing the problem as the question of whether
to do the shopping of $140 or $135 in all should make the assessment results of the
two sets of conditions identical. In the conditions of the $15 calculator, however,
the fact that the calculator whose list price is $15 becomes $10 is presumably
emphasized; in the conditions of the $125 calculator, the fact that the calculator’s
list price, $125, becomes $120 is emphasized. The cost reduction from the calcu-
lator’s list price of $15 to $10 would be valued more than the cost reduction from
$125 to $120 if a negative utility function that is convex downward was assumed,
just as in prospect theory.

Hedonic Framing
Thaler (1985, 1999) argues that the state of mental accounting is based on the
principle of hedonic framing, in which diverse factors of decision making problems
are separated and combined to achieve higher total assessments. Assuming two
factors, x and y, and assuming that x ∘y is the combination of x and y, he argues
that hedonic framing is conducted according to such a rule as
v x∘y
ð
Þ ¼ max v x þ y
ð
Þ, v x
ð Þ þ v y
ð Þ
ð
Þ:
Based on the assumption of the value function of prospect theory, he points out
that the characteristics described below can be found in hedonic framing.
1. Gains are framed by separating each topic (because the value function of a gain
is concave downward, the total assessment becomes higher when separated).
2. Losses are framed by combining various topics (because the value function of a
loss is convex downward, the total assessment becomes higher when combined).

3. Minor losses and major gains are combined and framed (loss aversion is offset).
4. Minor gains and major losses are separated and framed (because the slope of the
value function in the area of gain is steep near the origin, slightly increasing a
gain has a greater impact than slightly reducing a major loss).
According to the principle of hedonic framing of Thaler (1985, 1999), a gain to
consumers such as that of a discount tends to be separated and framed. As suggested
by the results of the questions related to the calculators asked by Tversky and
Kahneman (1981), if discounts are separated for each product and framed, when a
consumer intends to purchase two or more products, then increasing the discount on
a lower-priced product is expected to have a greater marketing effect than increas-
ing the discount on a higher-priced product.
Supermarkets, for instance, often use the strategy of collecting customers by
offering a large discount on a product such as a pack of eggs––reduced from the
normal price of $2.50 to $1.00––without substantially reducing the prices of high-
priced products, which increases the unit price of all purchased products as a whole
(egg prices are stable, making it easier for consumers to recognize discounts). The
$1.50 discount on the eggs is expected to have a greater effect even if a high-priced
product such as a television is discounted by $5.00 or more if the supermarkets
provide consumers with a total discount equivalent to or greater than the discount
on a pack of eggs.
Accordingly, using mental accounting by understanding its characteristics helps
develop strategies that are meaningful in the sense of marketing. It also allows
consumers to avoid manipulation by companies.

Robustness of the Framing Effect
Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1986) state that the framing effect in decision-
making is a very robust phenomenon. Contradictory judgments are made in the
process, which might be noticed after the fact, just as the phenomenon of optical
illusion in perception.
They speak to the difﬁculty that, like the Muller–Lyer illusion in psychology, the
framing effect is extremely prone to biases that are difﬁcult to eliminate even if
detected (Tversky and Kahneman 1986). The Muller–Lyer illusion is a strong
phenomenon presented in Fig. 9.1: when arrow feathers are attached to both ends
of lines of equal length, inward attachment makes the line look shorter (upper panel)
although outward attachment makes the line appear to be longer (lower panel).
The framing effect can also be compared to the Ebbinghaus areal illusion. This
optical illusion is a phenomenon by which, as portrayed in Fig. 9.2, a middle-sized
circle appears smaller when surrounded by multiple large circles (upper panel) and
larger when surrounded by multiple small circles (lower panel). In both optical
illusions, a small amount of contextual information makes the subjects of the same
size appear differently. Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1986) report that the fram-
ing effect has a function that is similar to such phenomena of optical illusions.

The Framing Effect of Decision Making

We are unable in most cases to correct our contradictions in decision making if
the framing effect is a robust phenomenon, as they argue. Nonetheless, in contrast
to their claim, there have been cases in which the framing effect is not observed
(Fagley and Miller 1987; Rybash and Roodin 1989). In addition, Takemura (1992,
1993, 1994a) has found that the framing effect is controlled by such operations as
prolonging the time required for decision-making or justifying a decision before
making a decision.
Takemura (1994b) examined the following hypothesis in psychological
experiments. This hypothesis forecasts that while the framing effect is observed
under the conditions that require no justiﬁcation of a decision prior to decision
making, it is not observed under conditions requiring justiﬁcation, in which the test
subjects are to write the reasons for their decisions in a form.
The test subjects were 180 male and female college students, and the problem of
the Asian disease in Tversky and Kahneman (1981) was used as the subject of
decision making (cf. p.124). The test subjects are assigned randomly to one of two
(justify decision or not) times two (decision frames: positive and negative) groups.
The results, presented in Table 9.1, support the hypothesis. The framing effect
was detected under the conditions without the procedure of justiﬁcation. In other
words, 80.0 % of the test subjects made a risk-free selection under positive frame

illusion

conditions; conversely, however, 68.9 % of the test subjects made a risky selection
under the negative frame conditions. Meanwhile, no statistically signiﬁcant framing
effect was identiﬁed under the conditions with the procedure of justiﬁcation.
Therefore, 46.7 % of the test subjects made a risk-free selection under the positive
frame conditions and 37.8 % of the test subjects made a risky selection under the
negative frame conditions.
Such experimentally obtained results presented by Takemura (1994b) are made
to question the robustness of the framing effect, suggesting that the effect might be
eliminated by such operations as cognitive elaboration. In this connection, Fujii and
Takemura (2001) report that the framing effect can be controlled by manipulating
attention using the size of literal information. Kuhberger (1998) meta-analyzed
numerous experimental studies of the framing effect made in the past and reported
that the framing effect was controlled in some cases by response modes and
characteristics of decision problems.
The controversy surrounding the robustness of the framing effect has continued
in recent years. An experiment has been reported as showing that the framing effect
appears robustly, as asserted by Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1986), which is not
eliminated by the procedure of justiﬁcation, irrespective of whether the need for
cognition of the test subjects is high or low (LeBoeuf and Shaﬁr 2003). In contrast
to this report, Simon et al. (2004) produced ﬁndings from experiments and studies
that question this robustness. They present that the framing effect does not disap-
pear when those with a low need for cognition go through the procedure of
justiﬁcation. However, those with a high need for cognition related to the form
of analytical thinking are able to eliminate the framing effect through the process of
justifying their decisions.
Consequently, although no clear conclusion related to the robustness of the
framing effect has been identiﬁed, at least it has been found not to be as robust as
Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1986) initially surmised. Considering, however, that
we do not often engage ourselves in cognitive elaboration in our normal social life
(e.g., Langer 1978), the framing effect is expected to occur almost constantly in
decision making in our social life.

The Framing Effect of Decision Making

Chapter 10
Theories Used to Explain the Framing Effect
Chapter 9 introduced empirical studies of the framing effect. This chapter will
explain the reasons why the framing effect occurs. Tversky and Kahneman (1981)
explained the framing effect based on prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky
1979, Tversky and Kahneman 1992), which they proposed. This chapter will ﬁrst
use this prospect theory to explain the framing effect, and subsequently use the
contingent focus model (Takemura 1994; Takemura and Fujii 1999, Fujii and
Takemura 2001a)––an alternative explanation to prospect theory––for the expla-
nation and introduce the empirical research related to this model.
1
Using Prospect Theory to Explain the Framing Effect
How does the framing effect occur? According to prospect theory proposed by
Tversky and Kahneman (1981), the decision making process is divided into the
editing phase, in which the problem is recognized, and the evaluation phase, in
which alternatives are evaluated based on recognition of the problem (see
Fig. 10.1). During the editing phase, decision-related problems, despite having
the identical objective characteristics, entail different recognition depending on
framing that is altered by even a slight difference in linguistic expressions.
Prospect theory deﬁnes a result as a deviation from the reference point, consti-
tuting the psychological origin. The decision maker is thought to evaluate the result
as either a gain or loss. Figure 10.2 presents the framing effect of the problem of the
disease in Asia described in the preceding chapter using the value function of
prospect theory. The value function is a concave function in the area of gain. It
signiﬁes risk-averse behavior, and is a convex function in the area of loss, indicat-
ing risk-taking behavior. Moreover, Fig. 10.2 shows that the slope of the value
function is generally steeper in the area of loss than it is in the area of gain. A
peculiarity of prospect theory is that the reference point corresponds to the origin in
utility theory, which is assumed to shift easily depending on how to frame the
decision problem, which explains that such a shift of the reference point causes

risk-averse behavior under positive frame conditions and risk-taking behavior
under negative frame conditions, even for an identical decision-related problem.
More speciﬁcally, the decision maker evaluates the result that 200 people survive
under the positive frame condition as a gain using the concave function and same
result that 400 people die under the negative frame condition as a loss using the
convex function.

Theories Used to Explain the Framing Effect

In addition, Tversky and Kahneman (1981) pointed out, as another cause of the
framing effect, that the size of the load of probabilities on preference has a
nonlinear relation. Therefore, the value of the deﬁnite gain or loss from an alterna-
tive would be greater, thereby increasing the framing effect.
These ideas of prospect theory explain why the description invariance by which
formally equivalent decision making problems that bring about the same preference
order cannot be satisﬁed. Although the difference in the characteristics of the value
functions between the areas of gain and loss and the non-additive effect of proba-
bilities on preference have been adopted in many other nonlinear utility theories,
the essence of prospect theory is that preference is reversed by a shift of the
reference point.
2
Problems of Prospect Theory
The presence of the reference point is extremely important for explanation of the
framing effect based on prospect theory. What type of formulation can then
provide a theoretical explanation of a shift of the reference point? Tversky and
Kahneman (1981) presented the following opinions in this regard. “The frame
used by the decision maker relies on the form of the selection problem or the
norms, customs, or personal characteristics of the decision maker (Ref. p. 453).”
However, they have merely presented such a qualitative remark and fail to furnish
the reader with a clear answer up to the present. Currently, prospect theory fails
to clarify how the reference point changes and has difﬁculty in forecasting
preference and selection. In other words, although assuming that the decision
maker converts the coordinate system, prospect theory has a problem of not
indicating how the decision maker converts the coordinate system (Takemura
1994; Fujii and Takemura 2001a).
On the assumption that prospect theory is correct, Fischhoff (1983) attempted to
identify the position of the reference point theoretically from the result of selection.
For many test subjects, however, the position of the reference point was not
identiﬁed successfully. Furthermore, Fischhoff discovered in the responses of
many of the test subjects that the value of the reference point as reported by a test
subject in person after the test was not consistent with the reference point inferred
from the result of selection.
In addition, although prospect theory assumes only one reference point, the
reference point of decision making is not necessarily only one. The possibility
exists that a decision maker uses multiple reference points (Takemura 1998, 2001).
In fact, in the analysis of the linguistic reports on the test subjects in the problem of
the Asian disease, slightly more than 40 % of the test subjects (5 out of 12) were
found to have made decisions based on multiple reference points in at least one of
the two decision problems (Maule 1989).
Prospect theory is therefore difﬁcult to use as a theory for quantitative descrip-
tion of behavioral decision making (Fujii and Takemura 2001a) for the two reasons

of the problem of identifying the reference point (Fischhoff 1983) and the problem
of the possible presence of multiple reference points (Maule 1989; Takemura 1998,
2001).
3
Basic Assumptions of the Contingent Focus Model
as an Alternative Explanation
In an effort to explain the framing effect theoretically without using the concept of
the “reference point”, which presents quantitative problems, Takemura and Fujii
proposed a model––the contingent focus model––that assumes dependence of the
framing effect on the attention of the decision maker (Takemura 1994; Takemura
and Fujii 1999, Fujii and Takemura 2001a). This model includes the assumption
that an increase in the weight of attributes being focused upon and changes in the
attributes focused upon by the decision maker are caused by linguistic expressions.
In this model, the framing effect is regarded as occurring not necessarily because
of changes in the reference point as claimed by prospect theory, but because of
changes in how the value of the result and uncertainty are focused depending on the
situation. The decision is likely to be risk-averse under positive frame conditions
because relative weight is placed on “certainty,” rather than the “value of possible
results,” and risk-taking under negative frame conditions as a relative weight is
placed on the “value of possible results,” rather than on “reduction of uncertainty”
(see Fig. 10.3).
The basic hypothesis of this contingent focus model is that the amount of
attention increases when evaluating a result in negative aspects rather than in
positive aspects. This hypothesis is consistent with the loss sensitivity principle
that the decision-maker is more sensitive to a loss than a gain (Ga¨rling and
Romanus 1997, 1999).

Mathematical Expressions of Contingent Focus Model
First, the assumptions of the contingent focus model are described below.
Assuming a set of alternatives is A and that its elements are mutually exclusive
alternatives, a1, a2, a3 . . ., Set A is described as {a1, a2, a3 . . .}. Subsequently, we
consider the set of the results of adopting these alternatives: X ¼ {x1, x2, x3 . . .}.
The elements of X, for instance, include x1 ¼ 200 people will survive, x2 ¼ no one
will survive, and x3 ¼ 600 will people survive.
The result, xi, of adopting the alternative, ai, should depend at least on a state of
some kind, Θ ¼ {θ1, θ2, θ3, . . .}, which can be replaced with the probability
distributions p1 ¼ [p11, p12, p13, . . .], p2 ¼ [p21, p22, p23, . . .],
p3 ¼ [p31, p32,
p33, . . .], . . . on X if the probability distribution on Θ is known in decision making
under risk (cf. Chap. 6). In problems of decision making under risk, the subject of
selection is regarded as a Cartesian product, X  P, assuming the set of the results
of an alternatives, X ¼ {x1, x2, x3 . . .}, and the set of probabilities of values in the
interval [0,1].
At this stage, we consider only the cases in which result xj occurs and does not
occur for simpliﬁcation, as in the studies of Tversky and Kahneman (1981), and the
value of the situation in which result xj occurs (i.e., the situation that no one will
survive) as zero.
In the contingent focus model, then, when describing the value of adopting an
alternative ai, the description is possible only from the pair of a result and proba-
bility (xj, pj). In the example of the problem of an Asian disease of Tversky and
Kahneman (1981), because the value of the situation in which no one will survive is
zero, the description is made only from the situation (200 people, 1) in which
200 people will survive and the situation (600 people, 1/3) in which the result that
600 people will survive with a probability of 1/3 occurs.
The contingent focus model expresses the values under positive frame condi-
tions as UPo[FPo(xj), GPo( pj)] and the values under negative frame conditions as
UNe[FNe(xj), GNe( pj)] (Takemura 1994). Subsequently, preference relations ≿Po
and ≿Ne, which satisfy the nature of weak order (preference relations satisfying
comparability and transitivity), are assumed respectively as the preference relation
under positive frame conditions and the preference relation under negative frame
conditions. At this point, we assume that the value of one attribute is independent of
the ﬁxed value of the other attribute for all values of attributes under each set of
frame conditions. In other words, for arbitrary x1, x2 ∈X and p1, p2 ∈P,

where i ¼ Po, Ne.
Based on the assumptions presented thus far, the nature of weak order of the
preference relation, ≿i, and the assumption that the equivalence class of X  P has

order-dense countable subsets, the presence of functions Fi, Gi, and Ui that indicate
the following relations deﬁned on X, P, and Re  Re is derived. Apparently, these
assumptions are necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the existence of the follow-
ing function (Krantz et al. 1971). Consequently, for arbitrary x1, x2 ∈X and
p1, p2 ∈P,

where Ui, i ¼ Po, Ne are the monotone increasing functions of each argument. The
equation above is a general form of the contingent focus model that explains the
framing effect.
The contingent focus model considers the values under positive frame conditions
UPo[FPo(xj), GPo( pj)]. The values under negative frame conditions, UNe[FNe(xj),
GNe( pj)], are considered more speciﬁcally as the following functions.

In the above, each of Fi, i ¼ Po, Ne is a function to convert the value of results
subjectively, Gi, i ¼ Po, Ne are the functions to convert probability subjectively,
and Ui, i ¼ Po, Ne are the functions to evaluate Fi and Gi comprehensively.
Furthermore, in the contingent focus model, the preference relation between two
alternatives is Fi(xj)αiGi( pj)βi, i ¼ Po, Ne, which becomes equivalent to the size
relation of the value of Fi(xj)wiGi( pj) when assuming wi ¼ αi/βi. In this case, αi, βi,
and wi are parameters that are inherent in each frame condition. In other words,
Ui[Fi(xj), Gi( pj)], i ¼ Po, Ne is expressed with the functions, F and G, which are
common in both framing conditions. In addition, exponents αi, βi, and wi are
inherent in each frame condition. Therefore, the framing effect is thought to
occur because of the relation of how αi and βi are cast.
Accordingly, in the contingent focus model shown below holds true.

Veriﬁcation Experiment of the Contingent Focus Model
The most basic and important hypothesis among the hypotheses of the contingent
focus model is the “focusing hypothesis” that the allocation of attention to the
results and probabilities in decision-making inﬂuences the risk attitude. For veriﬁ-
cation of this hypothesis, Fujii and Takemura (2001a) conducted two experiments
to determine whether the risk attitude of test subjects would change as predicted by
the focusing hypothesis by experimentally manipulating the attention used for
establishing recognition during the decision making process.
In Experiment 1, the test subjects consisted of 180 students and faculty members
at Kyoto University. In all, six conditions, including two levels of frame conditions
(positive and negative) and three levels of emphasis conditions (emphasis on
results, no emphasis, and emphasis on risk), were adopted as experiment conditions.
Then 30 test subjects were randomly assigned to each condition. As presented in
Fig. 10.4, under the condition of emphasizing the result, letters indicating the result
were enlarged and written in bold. They were then added with auxiliary words for
additional emphasis. Similarly, under the condition of emphasizing the risk, the
letters indicating probabilities were enlarged, written in bold, and added with
auxiliary words to emphasize them.
Under the condition of emphasizing the result through such experiment manip-
ulation, the amount of attention paid to the result is expected to increase in
comparison to the risk-emphasizing condition. Therefore, based on the focusing
hypothesis, the risk-taking tendency is predicted to be stronger under the result-
emphasizing condition than the risk-emphasizing condition under both the positive
and negative conditions. The results are presented in Table 10.1. Under the negative
condition under the risk-emphasizing condition and no-emphasis condition, no
clear tendency of risk aversion or acceptance was evident. This result is not
necessarily consistent with the prediction of prospect theory. Meanwhile, the
contingent focus model forecasted that a negative result would draw greater
attention than a positive result. This result therefore supports the basic hypothesis
of the contingent focus model rather than prospect theory. The results also reveal
that the risk-taking tendency is stronger under the result-emphasizing condition than
the risk-emphasizing condition under both the positive and negative conditions.

Veriﬁcation Experiment of the Contingent Focus Model

This result implies that the tendency to accept risk is stronger under the result-
emphasizing condition than the risk-emphasizing condition, which is consistent with
the prediction of the focusing hypothesis representing the basic hypothesis of the
contingent focus model.
In Experiment 2, the problem of the disease in Asia was used. The test subjects
were 180 students and faculty members, and the experiment conditions, methods
of presenting the problem, and other conditions were the same as those in
Experiment 1. Table 10.2 presents the results. As in Experiment 1, the risk-taking
tendency that is stronger under the result-emphasizing condition than under the risk-
emphasizing condition irrespective of the frame conditions is apparent from the
results. The above results prove to support the forecast of the contingent focus model.
In addition to this, experiments in which the contingent focus model was
examined include one in which the information was provided on personal com-
puters (Takemura et al. 2001). In this experiment, the information was presented as
shown in Fig. 10.5. The forecast using the contingent focus model was veriﬁed on
the assumption of greater attention paid to letters presented with a higher frequency
than others. Fujii and Takemura furthermore attempted to measure the focusing
reaction directly using an eye movement measurement system and discovered
selection results opposite of the prediction of prospect theory caused by changes
in eye movements (Fujii and Takemura 2003). Additionally, Fujii and Takemura
(2001) incorporated the concept of random utility in the contingent focus model and

Theories Used to Explain the Framing Effect

conducted meta-analysis based on some results of investigations and experiments in
which the propriety of the contingent focus model was determined.
The contingent focus model demands further theoretical elaboration and empir-
ical examination. This model presents policy implications that differ from those
brought about by prospect theory. In fact, a study of social consensus-building
(Fujii et al. 2002) and a study of consumer marketing policy (Takemura et al. 2004)
were conducted based on the contingent focus model.

Decision-Making Process and Its Theory

Chapter 11
Decision-Making Process
This chapter presents a description of a decision-making process. The previous
chapters have explained the decision-making phenomenon and theories to describe
the phenomenon, which, however, have largely omitted a description of the process
through which a decision is made. Accordingly, this chapter presents a description
of how the psychological process used in decision making is explainable using a
technique to follow the decision-making process. This chapter also elucidates the
task variables and emotional factors affecting the decision-making process. The
ﬁnal section explains the changes made to cognition in psychological processes
after decision making.
1
Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
and Information Search
We assume a set of circumstances related to purchasing a product at a store.
Presume, for instance, that we purchase a digital audio player. Consumers make a
purchase decision after comparing multiple attributes such as the prices, number of
recordable tracks, sound performance, and designs at stores or using catalogs. Such
decision making after considering multiple attributes is called multi-attribute deci-
sion-making.
Multi-attribute
decision-making
is
presumably
performed
by
obtaining information of multiple types.
Consumers’ information search normally begins with internal information
search to obtain related information from their memories. If adequate information
is not stored in their memories, then external information is sought from sources
such as information at stores and product catalogs (Engel et al. 1993; Mowen 1995).
In this context, the word “internal” in internal information search refers to the brain
structure that includes consumers’ memories, and the word “external” in external
information search refers to consumers’ external environment. One report
described in the literature has revealed that many consumers rely mostly on internal

information that is sought from their memories when they make a decision related
to auto-repair service. Only 40 % of them perform an external information search
(Biehal 1983). Studies have also revealed that satisfaction with a previous purchase
encourages total dependence of decision-making on internal information search
(Engel et al. 1993), which is particularly the case in a repeated purchase of the same
brand that was purchased previously.
Whether consumers make decisions solely based on internal information search
is affected in part by their reliance on the knowledge they already have (Takemura
1997a). An example is the case of purchasing a PC for the ﬁrst time. Consumers
visiting stores have very little knowledge about products. Therefore, the informa-
tion that is needed for decision making cannot be identiﬁed through internal search.
Necessary information must therefore be obtained through external search using
catalogs, asking store attendants, and using other means.
The methods of information search and the assessment of alternatives are closely
related to each other. Decision making in the purchase of a television, for example,
involves assessment of various televisions. Information about what attributes of a
television are sought in what order strongly affects the overall assessment of the
television. As presented in Fig. 11.1, the assessment of alternatives is expected to
differ clearly when information search is performed for all attributes of all alterna-
tives and when the search is limited to information related to a part of the attributes
(Takemura 1997a). The assessment of alternatives and the results of decision
making often vary between cases in which the most appropriate brand based on
the most important attribute such as price is identiﬁed by acquiring information on,
ﬁrst, the prices of all brands, then on the second most important attribute (attribute-
based information search) and cases in which the optimal brand is determined by
searching for information related to each brand and then making a comprehensive

evaluation (alternative-based

search)
(Bettman
1979;
Bettman
et al. 1991; Takemura 1997a). The methods of information search and the assess-
ment of alternatives are thereby inseparable.
2
Various Decision Strategies
An important concept in understanding the decision-making process from the
perspective of information search is a decision strategy. A decision strategy deter-
mines the type of a series of mental operations used to assess and select alternatives.
A decision strategy is also called decision heuristics. The idea of heuristics is in
contrast to algorithms, which are action strategies that always result in optimal
solutions.
In comparison to the use of algorithms, the use of heuristics often supports
prompt and efﬁcient problem solving. In some cases, however, inappropriate
solutions or inconsistent and circumstantial decisions might result. Decision strat-
egies for people’s decision making are mostly heuristic, which are therefore often
called decision heuristics. Although decision strategies are conceptually distin-
guished from information search strategies, they mutually correspond in most
cases. In fact, studies of decision strategies frequently involve the analysis of
information search patterns of decision makers, as described later (Klayman
1983; Bettman et al. 1991).
Preceding studies of decision-making process have shown that people’s deci-
sion strategies rarely follow the procedures of utility maximization assumed by
utility theory (Simon 1957; Abelson and Levi 1985; Gigerenzer and Selten 2001).
Simon (1957) has stated that, rather than making decisions according to the
principle of maximization or optimization for selecting the best from all available
options, people opt for the principle of satisfaction to seek an alternative that
satisﬁes them to a degree because of the limitation of their information processing
capacity. Since then, several decision strategies derived primarily from the
limitation of people’s information processing capacity have been developed
(Beach and Mitchell 1978; Payne 1976; Payne and Bettman 2004; Takemura
1985, 1996a, b, 1997a).
The decision strategies that have been developed to date include the following.
Additive strategy: A decision strategy of this type includes consideration of all
alternatives at every level, which are assessed comprehensively to determine the
best alternative. Additive strategies include a weighted additive strategy that places
different weights on each attribute and an equal weight strategy, which is contrary.
Additive difference strategy: A decision strategy of this type compares the assess-
ment values of each attribute between an arbitrary pair of alternatives. Three or
more alternatives are paired and compared. Then the winners of the comparison are
compared further in sequence in a tournament. The last remaining alternative
is used.
2
Various Decision Strategies
129

Conjunctive strategy: A decision strategy of this type speciﬁes necessary conditions
of each attribute; any alternative failing to meet even one of its necessary conditions
is excluded from the information processing and is rejected irrespective of the
values of its other attributes. The ﬁrst alternative that satisﬁes the necessary
conditions of all of its attributes is the one to be selected based on this decision
strategy.
Disjunctive strategy: A decision strategy of this type speciﬁes sufﬁcient conditions
of each attribute; any alternative meeting at least one of its sufﬁcient conditions is
selected irrespective of the values of its other attributes.
Lexicographic strategy: A decision strategy of this type selects the alternative that
is assessed as the highest in the most important attribute. Two or more alternatives
scoring equally highest in the most important attribute are screened based on the
next most important attribute. Alternatives with a slim margin to an extent, how-
ever, are regarded as ranking the same, and screening based on the next important
attribute is called a lexicographic semi-order strategy.
Elimination by aspects (EBA) strategy: A decision strategy of this type examines
whether each attribute satisﬁes its necessary conditions and rejects those failing to
meet such conditions. This decision strategy is similar to the conjunctive strategy,
except that it is an attribute-based strategy of examining multiple alternatives for
each attribute.
3
Categories of Decision Strategies
Such various decision strategies have been identiﬁed, which are often categorized
into two when studied: compensatory and non-compensatory strategies. A compen-
satory decision strategy makes a comprehensive evaluation, in which any attribute
with a low assessment value is compensated by other attributes with a high value.
Additive and additive difference strategies are included in this category.
A compensatory strategy examines the information related to all alternatives.
Non-compensatory decision strategy has no such compensatory relation among
attributes, which includes conjunctive, disjunctive, lexicographic, and EBA
strategies.
Decision results might vary depending on the examined alternatives and attri-
butes based on the non-compensatory decision strategy, which might cause incon-
sistent decision making. Presuming, for instance, that a consumer makes a decision
about television brands using the conjunctive strategy, then the conjunctive strategy
selects the ﬁrst alternative that has satisﬁed its necessary conditions. Therefore, the
order of brands to examine is extremely important. Even if the consumer’s most
preferred television brand is available at another store, if one satisfying the neces-
sary conditions is sold at the ﬁrst store, the ﬁrst will be purchased. Whether the
consumer purchases the preferred brand the most is therefore likely to be affected
by situation factors such as in-store product placement and store locations.
130
11
Decision-Making Process

In actual decision making, compensatory and non-compensatory decision strat-
egies tend to be combined according to the decision level. In other cases, consumers
often narrow down the alternatives through elimination such as the EBA strategy to
reduce their cognitive strain; they then use a compensatory strategy such as the
additive method (Bettman 1979; Takemura 1996a, 1997a). As this process illus-
trates, decision strategies themselves might vary depending on the decision-making
process. Such a type of decision making is sometimes called a multistage decision
strategy (Takemura 1993).
4
How to Identify Decision Strategies
Methods to identify decision strategies include two: the verbal protocol method and
the method of monitoring information acquisition (Bettman et al. 1991; Payne and
Bettman 2004; Takemura 1997a).
The verbal protocol method is to have the test subject speak or write about the
subject’s own decision-making process, which is recorded and used to determine
the type of decision strategy that was adopted. The verbal protocol method includes
cases in which the subject speaks simultaneously during the decision-making
process and cases in which memories are recorded immediately after decision
making. A variation of this method is to present a list of decision strategies to the
test subject in advance, who reports afterwards which strategies have been used.
A study of Takemura (1996a) that used the verbal protocol method, for example,
had people who were considering the purchase of various products to keep a diary.
A protocol suggesting that the conjunctive decision strategy was used at the ﬁnal
stage of making a decision was reported as shown in Table 11.1 in this study. The
diary presented in Table 11.1 was written by a 22-year-old female college student
who reported the process of purchasing a half-length coat in preparation for a trip to
Canada.
Table 11.1 Example of verbal protocol
(omitted)
January 6, I heard on the radio that the temperatures in Canada and the East U.S. were below the
freezing point and thought that I would purchase a very warm and waterproof coat
January 12, I went to a sporting goods store in Umeda. I went to the skiwear section and found
half-length coats there. I found a half-length coat with a hood attached to it. The edge of the
hood was decorated with faux fur, which is cute. The outer material is not waterproof, but is
made water-resistant, so it should be okay even if it gets a little wet. I do not like the color very
much, but it looks very warm. I decided to compromise on the color and purchased the
half-length coat

How to Identify Decision Strategies
131

The method of monitoring information acquisition is to have the test
subject freely search the information related to brands and analyze the attributes
of the alternatives searched and the order of the search. This method includes
the use of information displays, computer-based search systems, and measuring
devices such as an eye camera (Bettman et al. 1991; Takemura 1996a, b,
1997a). Figures 11.2 and 11.3 depict photographs of the experiment of Okubo
et al. (2006) on the method of monitoring information acquisition using an eye
camera.
Analysis of data of an experiment using the method of monitoring infor-
mation acquisition is performed by deducing, for instance, that examining the
information related to all alternatives using the alternative-based information
search will be an additive strategy or that reducing the alternatives to examine
in sequence using the attribute-based information search will be an EBA
strategy. As pointed out by Klayman (1983), some cases prevent the estima-
tion of speciﬁc decision strategies based solely on information search. Com-
bining the use of the verbal protocol method and the method of monitoring
information acquisition in such a case allows identiﬁcation to a considerable
degree. At least whether the strategy is compensatory or non-compensatory or
whether the information search is attribute-based or alternative-based is
identiﬁable.

Decision-Making Process

Task Dependence of Decision Strategies
The results of preceding reports have indicated that these decision strategies are
altered according to the properties of the task such as the number of alternatives and
the number of attributes (Bettman 1979; Bettman et al. 1991; Payne and Bettman
2004; Takemura 1996a, b, 1997a). The reports suggest, in other words, that a small
number of alternatives encourages the use of a complementary decision strategy
and that a larger number of alternatives tends to promote the use of a
non-complementary strategy. Takemura (1993), for example, conducted an exper-
iment to assess decision making in the purchase of a radio-cassette recorder using
the verbal protocol method. The numbers of alternatives and attributes were altered
between two (4 and 10 for each) and the decision strategies used under each set of
experimental conditions were compared. The decision strategies which were used
under respective sets of conditions are presented in Table 11.2. Many test subjects
adopted the style of combining multiple decision strategies at multiple stages. In
general, non-compensatory strategies were used more often under the conditions of
numerous alternatives or attributes. The analysis of these data also revealed that
numerous alternatives would encourage the use of attribute-based decision
strategies.

Task Dependence of Decision Strategies
133

The reason for such alternation of decision strategies based on changes in
the number of alternatives or attributes is interpreted as an effort to avoid the
cognitive strain from information overload caused by processing a large amount
of information required by the conditions of many alternatives or attributes by
selecting simpler decision strategies with less burden of information processing.

Decision-Making Process

The state of information overload is thereby presumed to simplify the decision
strategies selected, leading to varying results of decision making (Information
overload not only simpliﬁes decision strategies, but tends to provoke the avoidance
of the state of decision making. Takemura (1996a) conducted an in-store interview
survey of consumers at supermarkets and reported that those consumers in confu-
sion in the state of information overload tended to leave the store to avoid conﬂicts).
Not only the number of attributes and alternatives, but factors such as the form of
information display in a decision-making task, operation of decision-making task
variables such as reaction modes of decision making, and operation of motivation
variables such as the level of psychological involvement of the decision maker in
the decision making have been found to affect decision strategies (Abelson and
Levi 1985; Bettman et al. 1991; Engel et al. 1993; Takemura 1996a, b).

Emotions and Decision Strategies
135

Decision strategies are evidently inﬂuenced also by the emotions of the decision
maker (Cohen and Areni 1991; Luce et al. 2001; Payne and Bettman 2004;
Takemura 1996c, 1997b).
Isen and Means (1983) studied the effects of positive emotions (good feelings)
on decision strategies. The study revealed that the test subjects who had received
false feedback that they had been successful in a sensorimotor task (positive
emotion group) would take a longer time for ﬁctitious selection of an automobile
and search less for information about the decision than those test subjects who had
not received feedback (control group).
This study also revealed the use of the verbal protocol method by which the test
subjects with positive emotions, as opposed to those in the control group, tended to
make decisions through an EBA strategy of sequentially eliminating the alterna-
tives based on the attributes that were to be emphasized. Despite the lack of
certainty in generating optimal decisions, EBA decision strategies involve less of
a cognitive burden, which was presumably the reason for positive emotions to
encourage the use of strategies of such a nature.
Additionally, Takemura (1987) showed that those test subjects voluntarily
reported in a questionnaire on their feelings that they were feeling good on the
day took less time to select their ﬁctitious date partners, searched less for informa-
tion, and were more conﬁdent after making their decision than the counterpart
group. Forgas (1991) made a similar study of the task of opposite-sex partner
selection and also reported that positive emotions would reduce the time of decision
making and promote the use of simple decision strategies in selection.
Takemura (1988) further demonstrated that the test subjects given false feedback
that they had scored highly (the standard score of 67.5 and ranked within top 4 %)
on a mental test (actually, Uchida–Kraepelin psychodiagnostic test) took a shorter
time to make decisions in both actual selection (high involvement condition) and
hypothetical selection (low involvement condition) of a radio-cassette recorder,
searched less for information, and re-examined less information than those in the
control group (Fig. 11.4 presents the mean number of information searches). The
result of this experiment added with the involvement factor remained the same as a
result of the study of Isen and Means in the effects of positive emotions.
In addition to positive emotions, Takemura (1988) considered the effects of
negative emotions. This study operated negative emotions by giving the subjects
false feedback that they had scored low (the standard score of 32.5 and ranked in the
lowest 4 %) in the mental test. The result conﬁrmed the interaction between
negative emotions and the involvement factor. In other words, the test subjects
with negative emotions were found to take a longer time to make decisions, search
for more information, and re-examine more information under the high involve-
ment condition, and conversely, take a shorter time in decision making, search less
for information, and re-examine less information under the low involvement con-
dition in comparison to the control condition group.
This method operates emotions by feeding back a test result, which, in a sense, is
a social stimulus and might have affected cognitive variables other than emotions
such as self-image and self-esteem. Accordingly, Akiyama and Takemura (1994)
136
11
Decision-Making Process

conducted a similar experiment using garbage odors to solve this problem. The
result was fundamentally the same related to the interaction between negative
emotions and involvement.
Recent studies have begun to examine other dimensions such as the dimension
of arousal rather than the dimension of positive and negative emotions alone; the
effect reportedly varies depending on the level of arousal (Lewinsohn and Mano
1993). As noted earlier, the effect of emotions has been found to interact with the
effect of involvement (Takemura 1988). Evidently, emotions therefore affect deci-
sion strategies, and how they affect them is thought to change according to the
degree of involvement or arousal.

The process leading up to decision making has been described so far with
speciﬁc examination of the concept of decision strategies. The following describes
the psychological changes that occur after decision making.
Festinger (1957) proposed a theory called cognitive dissonance theory and
described the qualitative characteristics of the psychological changes after decision
making. He used the term “cognition” to refer to all knowledge collectively,
including opinions, beliefs, and emotions about oneself in a personal environment,
and hypothesized that people would attempt to eliminate dissonance when it arose
between units of cognition. He argued that the state of dissonance was uncomfort-
able, and that effort to reduce this discomfort would cause changes in cognition,
variation of behavior, addition of new cognition, and selective exposure to new
information.
Festinger believed that dissonance was likely to arise after decision making
when action had already been taken in many cases, thereby prompting measures to
eliminate the dissonance. For this reason, the appeal of an alternative after selection
is expected to increase from the state before the selection. A study of cognitive
dissonance that asked people who had just bought and those who were about to buy
their betting tickets at a racetrack about the probability of the winning of their bets
indicated that they believed in their chance of winning more strongly after the
138
11
Decision-Making Process

purchase of their tickets than they did before the purchase (Knox and Inkster 1968).
This result can also be interpreted as the justiﬁcation of one’s decision to eliminate
dissonance that arose after the decision was made.
Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) reported that people who were paid $1 for telling
other experiment participants an untruth that a task that was actually dull was
interesting tended more to justify their action and believed that the task was
interesting than those who were paid $20 for the same action.
This result is consistent with cognitive dissonance theory. The reason is that
telling that a dull task is interesting despite the low pay-off of $1 is considered more
dissonant than receiving $20 for the same action, making the subject susceptible to
a change of cognition.
Cognitive dissonance theory covers a wide area of decision making studies, and
research using the concept of cognitive dissonance continues to date (Harn-Jones
and Mills 1999; Matz and Wood 2005). While cognitive dissonance theory specif-
ically examines the process of justiﬁcation after decision making, some researchers
including Montgomery (1983, 1993), Svenson (2006), and Luce et al. (2001) have
pointed out the effect that justiﬁcation of decision making has on decision strategies
used before decision making.

various

related
to
decision-making processes. As explained last time, decision strategies for
decision-making take numerous forms. The selection of decision strategies is
affected by such condition factors as the number of alternatives and the number
of attributes. Numerous models have been proposed to explain the psychological
processes related to such a selection of decision strategies. This chapter will
introduce some models that are useful to explain decision-making processes.
It ends with some speculation about the future of modern behavioral decision
theories while referring to their relation with ﬁelds related to neuroscience, such
as neuroeconomics, that have been developed in recent years.
1
Dominance Structure Search Model
The dominance structure search model proposed by Montgomery (1983, 1993)
explains the mechanism of selecting a range of decision strategies. Montgomery
argued that being able to justify a decision that one had made was an important goal
of decision making and that various strategies could be used to justify the decision
that was made. This model used such a decision strategy that would convince the
decision-maker about the reasons for opting for the alternative that he/she had
selected over other alternatives. We examine the case of making the decision to
purchase a personal computer (PC) as an example. The dominance structure search
model includes the assumption that when we compare and consider different kinds
of PCs that we might purchase, the decision is made by selecting such a decision
strategy that convinces us that the PC we intend to purchase eventually is superior
to others.
In fact, the decision-maker has been able to determine the kind of situation in
which each of the various decision strategies would be appropriate. Adelbratt
and Montgomery (1980) presented multiple decision strategies to decision-makers
and had them assess the degree of propriety of a particular strategy under

particular circumstances. The study found consistency between the observation of
behavior as to which strategies were adopted by the test subjects and the assessment
of the possibility of adopting such strategies.
According to Montgomery (1983), the goal of decision-making is to search for
dominant alternatives. Dominance corresponds to an order relation between the
subjects in terms of a certain attribute. When a decision-making problem is a
multi-attribute decision-making problem that can be expressed with multiple
attributes, if one of the alternatives is desirable at least to an equivalent degree
in terms of at least one attribute, then the former is said to be dominant over the
latter. If, for instance, one PC is more desirable than another in the aspects of
price, performance, and design, then it is “dominant” over the other one. The
dominance structure search model adopts a dominant alternative if available;
otherwise, it assumes that a dominant alternative is created by the decision-
maker through psychological reorganization of decision-making problems and
the use of various decision strategies.
To facilitate the understanding of Montgomery’s dominance structure search
model, Kobashi (1988) rearranged the ﬂowchart of this model into the one
presented in Fig. 12.1 and summarized the stages of the model as shown below.
I.
Preliminary editing: Specify the alternatives and attribute groups in a decision-
making problem. In preliminary editing, the decision-maker evaluates the
importance of attributes and might eliminate less-important attributes. Alter-
natively, conjunctive (CON) and elimination by aspects (EBA) decision strat-
egies are used to eliminate less-promising alternatives at the preliminary
editing stage.
II.
Selection of promising alternatives: Select one alternative that is likely to
satisfy the dominance from the alternatives that have gone through the prelim-
inary editing phase. Because the alternatives whose attributes are particularly
desirable are more likely to be considered promising, at this stage, disjunctive
(DIS), lexicographic (LEX), and EBA decision strategies are likely to be used.
III. Dominance test: At this stage, promising alternatives are tested for their
dominance over all other alternatives. In other words, this stage uses
the dominance rule (DOM) to select dominant alternatives. Failure on this
test results in the exercise of dominance structuring of the next stage, IV.
IV. Dominance structuring: This process is implemented following failure on a
dominance test as a subroutine at the dominance test stage. The goal is to
eliminate the disadvantages of promising alternatives, i.e., factors preventing
them from becoming dominant alternatives. An alternative is canceled if it fails
in the process of dominance structuring.
In the ﬁnal stage of the dominance structuring process, a dominance structure is
sought through operations of dominance structuring. A dominance structure is a
state in which alternatives are given dominance through psychological compensa-
tion, although no single likely alternative is dominant over all other alternatives.
The four operations included are “de-emphasizing,” “bolstering,” “cancellation,”
and “collapsing” (Kobashi 1988).
144
12
Behavioral Decision Theories that Explain Decision-Making Processes

“De-emphasizing” is to obscure a disadvantage of a promising alternative
through, for instance, cognitive processing to consider the attribute constituting
the disadvantage insigniﬁcant or that the disadvantage might not actually exist or
appear. Lexicographic (LEX), additive utility (AU), and addition of utility differ-
ence (AUD) strategies correspond to this operation. An example of this is purchas-
ing a PC of which only the design is not satisfactory. The design attributes are
ignored when using the lexicographic decision strategy based on such attributes as
price and functionality.
“Bolstering,” is the opposite of “de-emphasizing,” which is a cognitive opera-
tion that emphasizes the advantages of an alternative and disadvantages of other
alternatives. Disjunctive (DIS) and conjunctive (CON) strategies correspond to this
operation. When purchasing a PC, for example, the decision might be made using

the disjunctive strategy based only on the attributes of notable CPU functions or
using the conjunctive strategy to select one alternative that satisﬁes the minimum
criteria for the price, functionality, and design.
“Cancellation” is an operation to offset a disadvantage of a particular attribute by
an advantage of another attribute to seek a dominant structure. The decision
strategies of the addition of utility difference (AUD) and winning percentage
maximization (MNA: maximizing number of attributes with a greater attractive-
ness) correspond to this operation. Winning percentage maximization is to select an
alternative that is left after a tournament among those alternatives with numerous
good attributes selected through paired comparison. In the case of a low-priced and
highly functional PC and a high-priced and less functional PC, for instance, the
advantages and disadvantages of these two attributes are offset in winning percent-
age maximization. Taking this into account, if one has better design, then it is
dominant over the other, thereby forming a dominant structure.
“Collapsing” is to reduce the desirability of two or more attributes and integrate
them at a level that is easier to understand. The additive utility (AU) decision
strategy corresponds to this operation. In the example of purchasing a PC, the AU
strategy might be used to seek dominant alternatives by expressing them in respec-
tive acceptable prices.
As described so far, Montgomery’s dominance structure search model includes
the assumption that the decision-maker seeks a dominant alternative. If no domi-
nant alternative is found, then the decision-maker develops a state in which the
disadvantage of a likely alternative is compensated using a decision strategy
operation. In this sense, this model is regarded as emphasizing the aspect of
motivation based on “acceptance” and “justiﬁcation” rather than the perspective
of human data processing.
2
Adaptive Decision-Maker Model
Payne et al. (1993) has proposed the adaptive decision-maker model. Rather than
emphasizing the process of motivation based on justiﬁcation just as the dominance
structure search model, this model speciﬁcally examines the aspect of data
processing efﬁciency in decision-making. This model includes the assumption
that, to adapt to the situation, a decision-maker selects an appropriate decision
strategy by considering the cost (expenditure) such as cognitive load and the beneﬁt
that an accurate selection will be made through the decision strategy.
The original idea for this model dates back to the contingent model for decision
strategy selection of Beach and Mitchell (1978). Payne et al. extended and elabo-
rated the basic idea of this model to allow computer simulation. Payne
et al. reported that a particular decision strategy will be selected under certain
conditions as a result of a decision-maker trading off the degree of cognitive effort
required for the decision and the propriety (accuracy) of the decision-making. In
other words, this model includes the assumption that a decision-maker places more
146

weight on either the accuracy or ease (reduced cognitive effort) depending on the
circumstances when selecting a decision strategy.
Figure 12.2 presents the case of the tradeoff between accuracy and effort
described by Payne et al. The horizontal axis of this ﬁgure represents the
number of operations in elementary information processes (EIP) such as com-
parison and removal, which constitutes the indicator of cognitive effort (cogni-
tive load). Payne et al. have stated that EIP involves the operations presented in
Table 12.1. The vertical axis of Fig. 12.3 is the indicator of the relative
accuracy of the results of decision. The indicator of relative accuracy is the
value resulting from dividing the difference between the expected values of
random selection and the decision strategy by the difference between the
expected values of random selection and the expectation maximization strategy.
More speciﬁcally, the relative accuracy is deﬁned operationally by the indicator
that takes the value of 1 when the result is identical to the load addition strategy
and 0 when the response is entirely random.

The dotted line in Fig. 12.2 shows the indifference curve (assumed as a straight
line in this case) when accuracy is focused in the relative weight of accuracy and
reduced cognitive effort. The solid line in Fig. 12.2 is the indifferent straight line
when the relative weight is placed on the reduced cognitive effort. Although each
indicates dominance on the upper right side, the steeper the slope of the indifferent
straight line, the more focused the reduced cognitive effort. This ﬁgure suggests that
the emphasis on accuracy tends to result in the selection of equal load addition
strategy. The emphasis on reduced cognitive effort is likely to engender the
adoption of an EBA strategy.
Payne et al. (1993) performed a computer simulation using the Monte Carlo
method by varying the numbers of alternatives and attributes and the degrees of
dispersion of decision-making loads. The cognitive effort (operationally deﬁned by
the number of EIP operations) for the exercise of each strategy and relative
accuracy (operationally deﬁned by the indicator that takes the value 1 when the
result is identical to the load addition strategy and 0 when the response is entirely
random) of the results of decision were included in the conditions for the
calculation.
Figure 12.3 depicts the tradeoff between cognitive effort and accuracy on the
condition of large and on the condition of small dispersion of load on the attributes
of decision-making. The vertical axis is the relative accuracy when the accuracy of
load addition strategy is 1. The horizontal axis is the relative effort when the
number of operations in the load addition strategy is 1. The two decision strategies

added with a plus sign in Fig. 12.3 represent a multistage decision strategy by which
a strategy is selected after narrowing the alternatives down to three or fewer with
the ﬁrst strategy.
According to Fig. 12.3, if accuracy is emphasized, then the lexicographic
strategy is dominant over other decision strategies when the dispersion of load on
the attributes is large, and the equal load addition model is dominant over other
decision strategies when the load dispersion is small. It is also suggested that more
cognitive effort is required when the dispersion of load on the attributes is large
rather than when it is small. Furthermore, although the relative accuracy of decision
is variable because of the load dispersion, the cognitive effort does not change
signiﬁcantly.
Figure 12.4 presents the results of relative accuracy and cognitive effort through
various strategies when the quantities of attributes and alternatives have been
changed. As indicated in Fig. 12.4, although the load addition strategy allows
accurate decisions, an increase in the numbers of alternatives and attributes requires
an extremely large amount of cognitive effort. In the lexicographic strategy, an
increase in the numbers of alternatives and attributes only slightly requires any
cognitive effort, and simultaneously, maintains the accuracy to a certain degree.
Furthermore, non-compensatory decision strategies such as lexicographic and
conjunctive approaches would not require as much cognitive effort as the load
addition strategy would, even with an increase in the numbers of alternatives and
attributes.
Experimental studies in the past demonstrated that an increase in the numbers
of alternatives and attributes would raise the percentage of non-compensatory
decision strategies being adopted. This phenomenon can be interpreted consis-
tently based on the results of simulation. In other words, small numbers of
alternatives and attributes would not require much cognitive effort, for which
compensatory strategies with high accuracy such as load addition tend to be
employed. For large numbers of alternatives and attributes, compensatory deci-
sion strategies requiring an extremely large amount of cognitive effort would not
be adopted; rather, non-compensatory strategies requiring less cognitive effort
would likely be used.
Payne et al. (1993) and Payne and Bettman (2004) associated the results of this
simulation with the results of a number of psychological experiments, traded off the
accuracy of selection and cognitive effort, and concluded that the decision-makers
were adaptively selecting decision strategies. This model of Payne et al. alone,
however, does not necessarily explain the situation-dependent assessment of alter-
natives and decision-making. The framing effect and emotional and motivational
effects have not been fully explained to date. Yet, the model of Payne et al. allows
quantitative forecasting of what kinds of decision strategies would be adopted in
what situations and what kinds of decisions would likely be made, which should
thereby be useful for predicting decision-making behavior and for supporting
decision-making.

Metacognitive Mechanism Model
This model, proposed by Takemura (1985, 1996b), aims at a uniform explanation of
the effects of the complexity of the tasks, involvement, emotions, and other factors
on the selection of decision strategies using the mechanism of metacognition. The
term metacognition refers the “cognition of cognition,” which, in this case, is the
awareness of the state of thinking about decision-making such as “I am confused
and cannot decide on one,” “I am not satisﬁed with the decision,” and “I want to
make a good decision.” The roles of this metacognition include monitoring of the
decision-making process and allocation of processing resources to control the
decision-making process. First, monitoring is the function of observing the psycho-
logical process of acknowledging a decision-making problem and implementing a
selection method. The feeling of oneself being confused or the decision-making
problem being difﬁcult in the decision-making process is conceivably the result of
monitoring. This monitoring is probably conducted while the decision-making
problem is being cognized. This monitoring, however, is not practiced when the
decision-making is typical or when the time is limited.
The metacognitive mechanism model adopts a decision strategy based on the
information acquired from this monitoring, which is governed by the function of
processing resource allocation. Processing resources are the resources for cognitive
processing that support expectation, attention, or effort. Although selection of
decision strategies is intended to allocate processing resources efﬁciently,
completely efﬁcient allocation of the resources is difﬁcult to achieve when adopting
a selection method. It is assumed that the process of implementing certain decision
strategies by trial and error is monitored, and that the strategies are modiﬁed and
adjusted until an appropriate decision strategy for efﬁcient allocation of processing
resources is identiﬁed. Figures 12.5 and 12.6 suggest that monitoring starts at the
stage of mental construction of the problem at the beginning of the decision-making
process, which continues through evaluation, selection of decision strategies, and
implementation and even after the decision is made.
The characteristics (complexity of the task) and context (time restrictions, etc.)
of decision problems and the abilities and psychological state, such as involvement,
of the decision-maker are thought to be related closely to these processing
resources. For example, a complex decision-making problem with large numbers
of alternatives and attributes and information overload would require a large
amount of processing resources for the understanding of the decision problem
and other mental activities. As a consequence, the processing resources allocated
at each stage of the decision-making process are conceivably reduced (see
Fig. 12.5). In contrast, a high level of involvement is likely to engender cognitive
elaboration, which would increase the processing resources allocated at each stage
of the decision-making process (see Fig. 12.6).
Similarly, the characteristics and context of decision problems and the abilities
and psychological state of the decision-maker are thought to be closely related
also to monitoring. For example, the monitoring function at each stage of the
3
Metacognitive Mechanism Model
151

decision-making process is likely to decline for a complex decision-making prob-
lem with large numbers of alternatives and attributes and information overload (see
Fig. 12.5). Meanwhile, a high level of involvement is likely to result in cognitive
elaboration, which would increase the monitoring function at each stage of the
decision-making process (see Fig. 12.6).
Figure 12.5 presents the process assumed for the metacognition mechanism and
decision-making in the case of a complex decision-making problem with numerous

alternatives and attributes and information overload. First, when the task is complex
and overloaded with information, the processing resources allocated is likely to be
reduced and the monitoring function is likely to decline, which tends to cause the
so-called framing effect (Tversky and Kahneman 1981) in the mental construction
of the decision-making problem. The psychological probability, assessment of the
result, and the form of information integration in the selection of decision strategies
are expected to be simple and non-compensatory.
Figure 12.6 presents the process assumed for the metacognition mechanism and
decision-making in the state resulting in cognitive elaboration. First, a high level of
involvement is likely to result in cognitive elaboration, which would increase the
processing resources allocated and increase the monitoring function. Consequently,
the so-called framing effect (Tversky and Kahneman 1981) is controlled in the
mental construction of the decision-making problem. The psychological probabil-
ity, assessment, and the method of information integration in the selection of
decision strategies might be compensatory, and the processing might be complex
and involve repeated examination of information.
Furthermore, this metacognition mechanism model explains the problem of the
effect of emotion and involvement on the decision-making process, which was
presented last time (Takemura 1996b). In other words, positive emotions reduce the
monitoring function of the metacognition mechanism and the processing resources
to be allocated, which is, thereby, likely to result in selection of a simple decision
strategy and shorter time until the decision is made. Negative emotions increase the
monitoring function of the metacognition mechanism, but reduce the processing
resources allocated. Therefore, a simple form of information integration would not
be adopted and longer time than usual would be taken for the decision-making.
Because negative emotions would increase only the monitoring function, the
interaction effect because of involvement would emerge. Because positive emo-
tions would reduce the monitoring function, the interaction effect attributable to
involvement is unlikely to appear.
This metacognition mechanism model is qualitative and inappropriate for quan-
titative forecasting. It might be useful, however, for uniformly interpreting or
explaining the effects of various factors on the selection of decision strategies.

Behavioral Decision Theory and Neuroeconomics
Behavioral decision theory has also been connected with the ﬁeld called
neuroeconomics in recent years. Neuroeconomics is the research area that is
intended to integrate psychology, economics, and neuroscience. It seeks to identify
appropriate models of people’s selection and decision-making and explain the
neuroscientiﬁc basis of decision-making phenomena using various theoretical
approaches and experimental methods (Sanfey 2007a, b; Takemura et al. 2008b;
Takemura 2009). The area of fusion between marketing and neuroeconomics called
neuromarketing has also been developing.

Behavioral Decision Theory and Neuroeconomics
153

The
reasons
for
the
progress
of
such
ﬁelds
as
neuroeconomics
and
neuromarketing are, ﬁrst, that noninvasive measurement of brain activity such as
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography
(PET) has developed, and the system of making ﬁndings, which have been made
only through the behavioral experiments done by psychologists and economists in
the past, in cooperation with neuroscientists, has been established. The second
reason is that, as noted earlier, the human model of a “rational economic human”
assumed in economics in the past was questioned by numerous economists and
psychologists. That inquiry produced behavioral decision theory and behavioral
economics to describe the actual human behavior of decision-making and theorize
the behavior.
The most experimentally examined theory in the studies of neuroeconomics is
prospect theory. Knuston et al. (2007) performed an experiment in which an
actual product was presented, and subsequently, the price was presented to the
test subjects using fMRI, who were, then, to decide whether they would pur-
chase the product. The result was that the more attractive the product, the more
active the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) in the ventral striatum. When high prices
were shown, the insula was active and the activity of the medial prefrontal
cortex (MPFC) decreased (see Fig. 12.7). This result suggests that the brain
activities in the areas of loss and gain differ and can be interpreted as being
consistent with prospect theory, which uses different value functions in the areas
of loss and gain.

12
Behavioral Decision Theories that Explain Decision-Making Processes

What is important in prospect theory is that the results are assessed based on the
difference from a reference point. Previous studies have revealed activity of the
MPFC and NAcc when compensation is not paid against expectations rather than
according to expectations (Loewenstein et al. 2008). These parts are likely to be
related to the reward system, which suggests that there is the brain activity
corresponding to the editing phase assumed in prospect theory such as the differ-
ence from expectations rather than the ultimate condition of a result.
Gonzalez et al. (2005) who investigated the editing phase in prospect theory,
found that people’s decision-making would vary depending on whether the linguis-
tic expression of the same decision-making problem was positive or negative, and
that a negative expression would tend to promote risk-taking selection. Activity of
the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the intraparietal sulcus was detected
from fMRI when a risk-taking selection was made (Gonzalez et al. 2005).
De Martino et al. (2006) examined the decision-making that corresponded to the
evaluation phase using fMRI. The risk-aversion tendency was observed when proﬁt
was to be selected, and risk-taking orientation was evident when loss was to be
selected. Examination of functional brain imaging in each state of proﬁt and loss
suggested that decision-making based on emotions triggered by the amygdale was
related to the reversal of preference. This study also implied that the orbitofrontal
cortex and MPFC that are related to the control of decision-making
In addition, there is a research ﬁnding to suggest that a state in which the
probability distribution can only be vaguely identiﬁed, rather than a situation with
the risk of a known probability distribution, in decision-making has more active
orbitofrontal cortex and amygdale. The ambiguity is not considered just as the
expected utility theory, but rather, it is consistent with prospect theory
(Loewenstein et al. 2008).
Cognitive psychological methods such as the process tracing technique might be
used to learn the ambiguous decision-making process. Using neuroscientiﬁc
methods is also extremely promising.
Hsu et al. (2005) compared decision-making under ambiguity and decision-
making under risk and observed activation of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)
(presumably related to the integration of emotions and cognitive input), the
amygdale
(which
presumably
reacts
to
emotional
information),
and
the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) (which presumably adjusts the activity
of the amygdale) in decision-making under ambiguity and activation of the caudate
nucleus in decision-making under risk. Hsu et al. (2005) also demonstrated that the
more active the OFC, the stronger the tendency of ambiguity aversion.
Huettel et al. (2006) demonstrated, based on experiments that used secure
alternatives, risky alternatives, and ambiguous alternatives that decision-making
involving ambiguous alternatives had indicated activity in the posterior inferior
frontal sulcus (pIFS) [included in the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)], the anterior
insular cortex (aINS), and the posterior parietal cortex (pPAR). Huettel et al. (2006)
also estimated the parameter of ambiguity aversion for each test subject based on
the results of the experiments and explained that the greater the activity of the pIFS,
the stronger the tendency of ambiguity aversion.

Levy et al. (2010) showed through decision-making problems under ambiguity
and under risk that the subjective value under ambiguity correlated with a larger
number of brain parts than the subjective value under risk (see Fig. 12.8). No parts
speciﬁcally related to each form of decision-making were found, however, and the
striatum and MPFC were identiﬁed as the parts activated least in common.
Although not in the context of decision-making, Bach et al. (2009) performed
fear conditioning with situations under risk, under ambiguity, and under ignorance
as the condition stimuli and presented the posterior inferior frontal gyrus (pIFG),
the right posterior parietal cortex (pPAR), and the lateral occipital cortex as the
parts indicating greater activity in the situation under ambiguity in comparison to
those under risk and under ignorance.
Before the studies described earlier were reported, Krain et al. (2006) conducted
a neuroscientiﬁc study of decision-making using gambling tasks, in which the tasks
were categorized into risky decision-making and ambiguous decision-making
according to the characteristics of the tasks used; a meta-analysis was performed.
They categorized the studies with tasks that demanded selection between high-
risk and low-risk alternatives as risky decision-making and those requiring selec-
tion from alternatives whose degrees of the result and probability were equivalent
as ambiguous decision-making. They argued that studies using the Iowa gambling

Behavioral Decision Theories that Explain Decision-Making Processes

task and Cambridge risk task, which are often used in decision-making studies in
conventional neuroscience, constituted studies of risky decision-making and not
neuroscientiﬁc research that directly examined decision-making related to
ambiguity.
They also assumed a dual-process consisting of a “hot” cognitive processes and
“cool” cognitive processes as a premise of the examination, in which decision-
making under risk corresponded to an emotional and intuitive “hot” process and
decision-making under ambiguity corresponded to a rational and deliberate “cool”
process.
On the assumption of the knowledge that the “hot” and “cool” cognitive pro-
cesses corresponded to the localization of brain function between the OFC and the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and assuming it as a result of meta-analysis,
decision-making under risk suggested the activity of the OFC and decision-making
under ambiguity suggested the activity of DLPFC, just as they had expected.
The categorization criteria used by them, however, are not consistent with the
deﬁnition of decision-making under ambiguity based on the framework of decision
theory that has been discussed in this article. The tasks used in the studies catego-
rized as ambiguous decision-making according to their criteria include one that
consecutively presented screens showing a red or blue ball and asked which color
had appeared more, a high-and-low game using cards from 1 to 10, one that asked
whether a red or black card would appear from a stack of playing cards, rock–
paper–scissors, and others. These tasks would be included in decision-making
under risk in the framework discussed in this article.
For this reason, their ﬁndings might not be accepted directly. The perspective of
the “hot” and “cool” cognitive processes assumed by them might provide many
suggestions to studies of decision-making under uncertainty. However, it cannot be
assumed to handle the difference from decision-making under risk and decision-
making directly under ambiguity. In fact, those studies described earlier deﬁned
ambiguity based on strict criteria from the perspective of decision theory, which
observed activity in parts that differ from those found in the meta-analysis of Krain
et al. (2006). Further improvement of methods that incorporate consideration of the
knowledge of decision theory is expected for the future.
As presented so far, the research of behavioral decision theory suggests that
people’s decision-making process is extremely situation-dependent and that various
psychological processes develop. Neuroeconomic research in recent years suggests
that decision-making is done through a multiplex system (Sanfey 2007a, b).
Decision-making has been found to involve an automatic process that is executed
half unconsciously and automatically and a controlled process consciously regu-
lated based on thoughts. Emotional processing is considered an automatic process,
whereas a cognitive process involving high-level thinking is conceived as a con-
trolled process. The important roles played not only by a high-level cognitive
process but by emotions in decision-making have already been identiﬁed in a series
of studies done by the group of Damasio et al. (Bechara et al. 1994, 1996, 1999,
2000). How emotional processing responds to prospect theory has not been
explained fundamentally. Therefore, it is left as a theme for future research.

Future of Behavioral Decision Theory
Numerous studies of behavioral decision theory in the past have proved that
people’s decision-making rarely follows the steps assumed by expected utility
theory (Simon 1957; Abelson and Levi 1985; Gigerenzer and Selten 2001). Partic-
ularly, Simon (1957) argued that rather than the principle of maximization and
optimization for selecting the best one from all available alternatives, people make
decisions based on the principle of satisﬁcing to seek an alternative that is satisfac-
tory at a certain level because of their limited information-processing capacity.
Simon pointed out that, in this sense, people only had “bounded rationality.”
Simon’s idea of bounded rationality was further developed into a recent study
based on the paradigm of fast and frugal heuristics proposed by Gigerenzer
et al. (1999) and Gigerenzer (2004). Fast and frugal heuristics (cognitive rules of
thumb) is a method of making adaptive decisions in the actual environment based
on the minimum time, knowledge, and calculation required. Gigerenzer and Gold-
stein (1996), for instance, exempliﬁed the use of computer simulation: when
determining which of two cities had a larger population, recognition heuristics
that would make the decision based only on the familiarity with the cities would
still be relatively appropriate. This ﬁnding suggests that relatively appropriate
decisions can be made even based on name recognition, by which a purchase is
made because the brand is known. They have demonstrated in various cases that
even fast and frugal heuristics would allow relatively appropriate decision-making.
Studies based on this paradigm include the explanations of Hirota et al. (2002) and
Nakamura (2004).
They proposed the idea of a priority heuristic as a fast and frugal heuristic and
demonstrated that various decision-making phenomena could be explained solely
by the assumption that most decisions were made simply based on one reason
(Brandsta¨tter et al. 2006). They have questioned the basic assumption of decision
theory used in expected utility theory and prospect theory that people make
decisions by integrating the utility and value of results and probability. Such a
point is shared in common with the contingent focus model proposed by Fujii and
Takemura, which assumes a simple and unitary process of decision-making through
the mechanism of attention, which does not separate the probability weighted
function and value function in prospect theory. Their alternative models suggest a
paradigm of experimental research that differs from the conventional expected
utility theory and prospect theory. Future behavioral decision theory must be
developed in concert with neuroeconomic research in the paradigm based on new
models other than prospect theory.
Whereas the paradigm of fast and frugal heuristics assumes that people’s
decision-making goes through serial information processing, a new trend
in decision-making research is based on connectionist models that assume
parallel information processing of people’s decision-making. A connectionist
model is an approach to understanding human cognitive mechanism using a
network of simple processing units that considers brain neurons, which are
158
12
Behavioral Decision Theories that Explain Decision-Making Processes

used with almost identical meaning as in the parallel distributed processing
model and neural network model (Tsuzuki and Asakawa 2003). Decision-
making research through this approach ranges widely in its variety (Mori
et al. 2001; Tsuzuki and Asakawa 2003; Busemeyer and Johnson 2004); major
studies include decision ﬁeld theory proposed by Busemeyer and Townsend
(1993). Decision ﬁeld theory is an attempt to explain diverse phenomena asso-
ciated with decision-making process using such tools as mathematical models
and computer simulation, for which a new revision has been proposed (Roe
et al. 2001; Busemeyer and Johnson 2004).
Although research on the cognitive process of decision-making has thus been
elaborated, research on the social psychological process of decision-making has
also advanced in recent years. Schwartz (2004) and Schwartz et al. (2002) socio-
psychologically extended Simon’s theory and identiﬁed the relations with a sense
of happiness and clinical adaptation through investigation. Schwartz et al. (2002)
developed a psychological scale using a questionnaire titled “Regret and Maxi-
mization Scale.” They designated a person who used a conjunctive decision
strategy based on the satisﬁcing criteria of Simon (1957) a “satisﬁcer” and
designated a person who collected as much information related to the alternatives
as possible to select the best alternative as a “maximizer” and studied the
psychological tendencies of the two. The results revealed positive correlations
between the maximizer’s tendencies and depression, perfectionism, and the level
of regret and negative correlations with a sense of happiness, optimism, satisfac-
tion with living, and self-esteem. According to Schwartz (2004), the “maximizer”
regrets the alternatives that have not been selected. Therefore, such a person is
less satisﬁed with the decision than the “satisﬁcer” is. Such a tendency was also
identiﬁed in the study done by Hisatomi et al. (2005) examining Japanese people
throughout the Japanese islands from the north to south. The research results
obtained by Schwartz suggest that a rational economic actor who makes optimal
decisions through consideration of as many alternatives as possible is not clini-
cally suitable in modern society. The suggestions that can be inferred from such a
ﬁnding are extremely interesting.
Finally, approaches that might be beneﬁcial in the future include, although they
are not new, the research paradigm of the selection behavior of animals that might
be integrated with modern behavioral decision theory (Hernstein 1961; Mazur
1998; Sakagami 1994, 1997) because, if animals’ selection behavior and human
decision-making are uniformly explained, behavioral decision-making research
could bring about great development.
In the studies of selection behavior, the matching law––which states that the rate
of selection response and the number of reinforcers obtained from the responses
correspond mutually––is said to hold true generally, and many studies have been
done (Hernstein 1961; Mazur 1998; Sakagami 1994, 1997). The generalized
matching law developed by expanding the original matching law has also been
proposed (Baum 1974, 1979).
Both the matching law and generalized matching law allow the prediction of
selection phenomena that differ from the forecasts based on expected utility theory.
5
Future of Behavioral Decision Theory
159

Some theoretical studies (Rachlin et al. 1986; Sakagami 1994) claim that prospect
theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979) can be deduced based on this generalized
matching law.
Although many arguments have been made of the reasons why the matching law
and generalized matching law can be established, no adequate theoretical conclu-
sion has been reached (Mazur 1998; Sakagami 1997). As a theory to explain the
matching law, the theory of melioration (Hernstein and Vaughan 1980; Vaughan
1981) has been proposed. The theory holds that animals make adjustments succes-
sively to increase either or both of time and effort for better alternatives and make
selections to equalize the strengthening efﬁciency gained among alternatives. Some
theoretical studies (Fujii and Takemura 2001, 2002; Takemura and Fujii 2004) state
that the generalized matching law can be derived from the psychophysical function
expressed with the logarithmic function of Fechner (1860) and the random utility
theory of Thurstone (1927). Such a research paradigm of selection behavior is
expected to engender more interesting ﬁndings when combined with experiments
incorporating neuroscientiﬁc information such as cognitive psychological experi-
ments on human decision-making and neuroeconomics or when examined in terms
of relevance with different behavioral decision theories.
Behavioral decision theory that has thus far been described brieﬂy might be
combined more with ﬁelds such as neuroeconomics, neuromarketing, behavioral
economics, and experimental psychology in the future. The research objective of
behavioral decision theory to explain people’s decision-making process is likely to
bring about interactions with various research ﬁelds and affect not only descriptive
research but normative and prescriptive studies.
6
Future Philosophical Issues Related to Behavioral
Decision Theory
The B.C. philosopher Aristotle (trans. 1971) developed his ethics from the perspec-
tive of what kinds of decision-making would be appropriate. His book, the
Nicomachean Ethics, begins with this line: “Every skill and every inquiry, and
similarly every action and rational choice, is thought to aim at some good
(Agathon); and so the good has been aptly described as that at which everything
aims.” The Nicomachean Ethics, as the name implies, is a book on ethics. Aristotle
purportedly wrote this book in support of good decision-making.
The viewpoint of Aristotle is necessary also in modern decision theory. Con-
templating what constitutes good decision-making belongs to the ﬁeld of normative
decision theory in decision-making theory. In the past, good decision-making has
often been considered only in view of rationality. Taking norms into consideration,
however, “what is good” must be deﬁned. Such an issue has been contemplated in
various ways by ethicists in the past, which must be considered also in decision
theory. Along with this, behavioral decision theory is useful to examine whether
people’s decision-making deviates from this “good.”
160
12
Behavioral Decision Theories that Explain Decision-Making Processes

“Good decision-making” must be observed from a pluralistic perspective. First,
decision-making should be conducted based on facts and should take rational and
convincing procedures, which is also suggested by the conventional normative
decision theory. It should be provided with consistency and completeness if possi-
ble. Secondly, it is important that decision-making brings happiness to people. Even
if it satisﬁes procedural rationality, decision-making without achieving people’s
happiness could not be good decision-making. Achievement of happiness is unques-
tionably an important constituent of good decision-making. Thirdly, moral correct-
ness is required of decision-making. Even if decision-making satisﬁes procedural
rationality and helps individuals achieve happiness, morally wrong decisions could
not be good ones. For example, decision-making that serves the happiness of the
decision-makers only while hindering the wellbeing of others could not be good.
Fourthly, beauty and virtue are important for good decision-making.
Even if decisions which are made satisfy the procedural rationality, bring
happiness to individuals, and are morally correct, actions and decisions that are
not regarded as beautiful could be regarded as only slightly as good decision-
making. Take the case of splitting a bill with friends at a restaurant as an example.
In view of moral fairness, happiness of individuals, and rationality, splitting the bill
to the last cent and settling the payment at the restaurant would not pose any
problem. Many people, however, might feel that splitting to the last cent would
not be “beautiful.” Good decision-making should include the element of beauty.
Beauty might also be expressed with integrity, bravery, dignity, and other qualities.
The ﬁnal dimension of beauty should take an important position in a decision-
making study. In the study of behavioral decision-making, the issue to be examined
is what kinds of decision-making are regarded as beautiful by people.
In decision-making, an alternative that is dominant in all these dimensions
would be unquestionably desirable, which, however, is a highly unlikely situation
in reality. In decision-making in reality, there might be no dominant alternative and
the composition of the alternatives does not even satisfy the comparability in many
cases. Under such circumstances, people are forced to take a multidimensional
approach to problem solving while simultaneously considering several aspects.
Investigating how people make decisions with such pluralistic value will be a
highly important research theme also for behavioral decision theory. Furthermore,
the knowledge of behavioral decision theory will have an extremely important
effect on normative decision theory and prescriptive decision theory.

Chapter 13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good
Decision Making
The ﬁnal chapter of this book presents a critical examination of the psychological
models of multi-attribute decision-making, ﬁndings obtained from them, and ratio-
nal decision-making and considers what constitutes a “good decision.” First, a basic
framework for ordinal utility theory based on Takemura (2011a, b) is presented as
normative analysis and is examined in view of rationality. By subsequently deﬁning
the version of ordinal utility theory expanded to multi-attribute decision-making, we
will re-interpret the rationality of multi-attribute decision-making based on Arrow’s
general possibility theorem. Re-interpretation of the general possibility theorem of
Arrow (1951) suggests that the rational multi-attribute decision-making deﬁned here
could not be performed with the exception of one-dimensional decision-making
based only on speciﬁc attributes. We descriptively analyze people’s multi-attribute
decision-making to demonstrate, based on the psychological model of decision-
making, the tendency of people to use one-dimensional decision-making to solve
issues of multi-attribute decision-making. Finally, prescriptive examinations of
multi-attribute decision-making are performed to support the argument that decision
making from a pluralistic perspective results in a “good decision” even though
one-dimensional decision-making should be avoided and even though rationality
in the above sense might not be satisﬁed, particularly in important decision-making.

Multi-Attribute Decision Making and Best Decision
1.1
Best Decision
We make various decisions in our daily life. We make decisions on every occasion:
from casual ones such as what to eat for lunch to more serious decisions such as
an individual’s future course and government policy. Decision-making, therefore,
becomes a rather important concept when considering practical activities and
making choices in life.

As described in Chap. 12, Aristotle (trans. 1971) in the Nicomachean Ethics
purportedly seeks the highest good (agathon) in people’s act of selecting. This can
be made more comprehensible by asking and answering the following questions:
Why do people wish to go to a good college? Because they are more likely to get a
good job. Why do they wish to get a good job? Because they wish to live a good life.
Why do they wish to live a good life? Because they seek something good. This good
thing might be the highest good. One might consider another example. We assume
that of a person who is going to purchase a car. He has decided to buy a car with a
brand name X sold by Company A. Why does he purchase the X-branded car from
Company A? First, he considered the high durability and resale value of cars from
Company A. Cars of the X brand are fuel-efﬁcient and are presumably environmen-
tally friendly for being hybrid cars. He also liked the design. The price is lower than
that of similar cars from other automakers. He was also given a large discount. He
also noted that the salesperson treated him well. These factors suggest that people
make decisions for various and complex reasons. We can think about why the high
fuel economy and likable design are positive factors and what implications that
environmental friendliness might have. Good gas mileage and design are appreci-
ated possibly for the satisfaction added to the life of the car buyer as a consumer.
A better environment meanwhile might be associated with welfare of both the
car buyer and other people. If we seek more factors that increase the value, we
might arrive at the highest good. Examining optimal decision-making reveals that
rationality is necessary in the course of making the decision. A decision for which
the purpose and method are contradictory is somehow not right. When we intend to
make a good decision, it appears that we often assume that we will select the
optimal alternative, i.e., the best decision-making. This is what is called the “best
decision-making” in the world of business.
1.2
Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
Decision-making in many cases has a multi-attribute structure. Consider the exam-
ple of multi-attribute decision-making in the selection of a personal computer
presented in Fig. 13.1 (Okubo and Takemura 2011). In the purchase decision making
to select a PC from Brands A, B, and C, we assume that the consumer makes the
decision by comparing two brands to select one with more preferable attributes than
the other and that the consumer purchases the one that remains in the end. Such a
means of making a decision is often witnessed in the technique called monitoring
information acquisition, which we use to analyze the process of obtaining informa-
tion, and a verbal protocol for making verbal reports. It might seem that the option
that will ultimately prevail would be the same irrespective of the order of selection.
If we follow this procedure and compare Brands A and B ﬁrst, Brand A prevails over
Brand B in the price and performance whereas Brand C outscores Brand A in the
performance and design in the comparison between Brands A and C. If the compar-
ison begins with Brands B and C, however, Brand B would remain after the ﬁnal
168

Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

stage. Despite the preference for Brand A to Brand B and Brand B to Brand C,
therefore, the transitivity by which Brand A is preferred to Brand C is not satisﬁed.
Instead, the result is the reverse relation in which Brand C is selected over Brand A
(see Fig. 13.1).
1.3
Difﬁculty of Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
and Its Psychological Cause
Under such circumstances, information related to the order in which the brand
options are focused suggests the ﬁnal result of the selection. Although Fig. 13.1
exempliﬁes only simulated conditions, this implies that the result of selection could
not be predicted without knowing the order of processing information in the
decision making process even when it is based on the same decision-making
standard. Our past research ﬁndings related to decision-making process indicate
that people’s decision-making process, in fact, relies on the path. Such reliance on
the circumstances or paths increases along with a larger number of options, and
evidently, also with increased emotion or excitement.
Such a phenomenon hints that people’s actual preference relations do not satisfy
the properties of weak orders (properties that satisfy both transitivity and connect-
edness) assumed in the expected utility theory and multi-attribute utility theory
described later. This inference further suggests that people are incapable of making
the best decision and of maximizing the utility.
Studies of good decision-making belong to the ﬁeld called “normative decision
theory.” Conventional normative decision theory often assesses “goodness” in view
of the rationality of form. This chapter, too, ﬁrst examines decision-making from a
pluralistic perspective based on the formal rationality in this sense. Normally,
theories to consider decision-making from a pluralistic perspective include the
system of the so-called multi-attribute utility theory. This theoretical system con-
cerns the method of deriving the eventual decision by trading off the value in
multiple dimensions. Although such a concept is extremely important, this book

and Takemura (2011)

Multi-Attribute Decision Making and Best Decision
169

ﬁrst develops an argument from a perspective that is slightly different from the
ordinary multi-attribute utility theory. In other words, rather than considering the
tradeoffs of various values as the starting point of the argument, we ﬁrst perform a
normative analysis from the perspective that no values can be compared. Although
this assumption might seem somewhat unnatural, it has certain signiﬁcance as the
starting point of the argument, considering the difﬁculty of trading off values and
determining values of higher importance in the actual decision-making. For
instance, the question of whether respect for a human life or achievement of justice
is more important cannot be answered easily. Trading off one for the other would be
considerably difﬁcult because some decision of an organization is necessary even
though some value tradeoffs would ultimately be necessary.
Although acknowledging the importance of the tradeoff issue, this chapter ﬁrst
develops the argument without assuming the possibility of tradeoffs from the
beginning. This is similar to the idea of not assuming the comparison of utility
among individuals as the starting point of an argument. There is also a method of
normative analysis that uses game theory by setting up multiple subjects to
examine the interaction among the subjects of decision-making. This chapter,
however, does not perform the analysis from this type of perspective. Although
the perspective of game theory allows interesting studies as to whether honest
expression of preference is rational and whether individual rationality engenders
collective rationality, this chapter uses an extremely simple view that decision-
making of both individuals and a group seemingly involves general intentions.
Examination based on such assumption is likely to facilitate a general under-
standing of multi-attribute decision-making despite the probable limitation posed
by the simpliﬁcation of the issue.
This chapter exempliﬁes the perspective of form that, when multi-attribute deci-
sion-making is viewed from the perspective described above, it satisﬁes such ratio-
nality standards as transitivity and connectivity and conditions considered
appropriate in multi-attribute decision-making contradict. This can be derived
by application of and re-interpreting the mathematical structure of the general
possibility theorem of group decision-making presented by Arrow (1951) to the
multi-attribute decision-making deﬁned above. Applying Arrow’s general possibility
theorem on this assumption results in the ﬁnding that rational decision-making is
possible only when it is based on one-dimensional standards, which suggests that
rational decisions generally cannot be made if the pluralistic values cannot be ranked,
which means that making the best decision would also be meaningless. Although the
actual decision-making involves the issue of such unfeasibility of decision-making, it
appears that we do not normally face the unfeasibility in the psychological aspect.
The question of whether people psychologically make their problems
one-dimensional to avoid the confrontation with the unfeasibility of decision-
making will be examined based on the theory of “mental ruler” proposed by the
author. According to this theory, people reduce the difﬁculty of decision-making by
one-dimensionally viewing a multidimensional problem. Making an issue
one-dimensional reduces psychological burden in some respects and encourages
more efﬁcient decision-making, which, however, involves the risk of ignoring the
170
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

attributes of important decision-making. This chapter claims that, from prescriptive
view, one-dimensional criteria of decision-making should be avoided. If the result
of decision-making is particularly important, decision based on one value only
might be risky. To make a good decision, it is important to make the decision
comprehensively by particularly addressing the plurality of values. It should be
pointed out that pluralistic value must be considered based on a prescriptive view
and originally a normative view, and various values must be combined or traded off
even though such practice is extremely difﬁcult. This discussion is intended to
reveal the conditions that are likely to require judgment based a one-dimensional
“mental ruler.” The argument will add at the end how to make a decision for which
such one-dimensional judgment is not necessary.

Weak Order in Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
and Additive Conjoint Structure
2.1
Making the Best Decision with a Single Attribute
Before we consider multi-attribute decision-making, we will review single-attribute
decision-making. As discussed in Chap. 2, the theorem for a weak order of
preference indicates the conditions for the best decision-making and conditions
for utility maximization.
2.1.1
Theorem for a Weak Order on a Finite Set (Krantz et al. 1971)
If the preference structure of a ﬁnite nonempty set, hA, ≿i, is a weak order, then
there exists a real-valued function u on A (u : A ! Re) such that,
8x, y ∈A, x ≿y , u x
ð Þ  u y
ð Þ:
In other words, this theorem means that if the preference made is a weak order, it
can be expressed with a function that takes real numbers that maintain the prefer-
ence relation. Therefore, this indicates that the preference relation of a qualitative
weak order can be examined by quantifying it using ordinal utility.
2.1.2
Uniqueness Theorem for a Weak Order on a Finite Set
(Krantz et al. 1971)
If the preference structure hA, ≿i of a ﬁnite nonempty set A is a weak order and
only in such a case, hA, ≿i is expressed by hRe, i through the real-valued
function u : A ! Re indicated in the above theorem, and the structure hhA, ≿i,
hRe, iui becomes an ordinal scale. Although this theorem assumes a ﬁnite set, we
2
Weak Order in Multi-Attribute Decision-Making and Additive Conjoint Structure
171

know that it also applies to countably and uncountably inﬁnite sets (Krantz
et al. 1971). In this sense, if the preference satisﬁes connectivity and transitivity,
preference or equality of an arbitrary pair of alternatives can be expressed, then at
least one best option can be selected, and this preference is equivalent to utility
maximization. Although the best selection can be made if the preference is acyclic
even if it is not a weak order, being a weak order guarantees the maximization of
utility. This is true not only in the case of a single attribute, but in the preference
relation of alternatives in multi-attribute decision-making. This can be described as
an additive conjoint system of multi-attribute decision-making.
2.2
Multi-Attribute Decision-Making and Additive
Conjoint Structure
The types of analysis that assumes a preference weak order include conjoint
analysis, which assumes the additivity of the operation to totalize the utility values
of attributes. Conjoint analysis is often used particularly for understanding prefer-
ence for marketing purposes. In new product development, for example, it is used to
ﬁnd out which attribute value of an existing product should be changed to produce a
new product that can attract consumers the most. It is also used to calculate the
market share of the new product through simulation. Currently, conjoint analysis is
used most frequently in marketing. It can also be applied to studies of preference
judgment such as a survey of high school students in their selection of a college to
attend. Not only for preferences, it is also used for studies of risk assessment by civil
engineering experts, and its potential applicability to other ﬁelds is markedly high.
As indicated in the pioneering study of Luce and Tukey (1964), conjoint analysis
is an analytical technique originally developed in the ﬁeld of mathematical psy-
chology to compose an additive real-valued function (additive utility function) that
is equivalent to the interval scale from preference data at the level of ordinal scale
(or more precisely, a scale that satisﬁes weak ordering). We know that the prefer-
ence relation must satisfy a group of axioms to compose such an additive real-
valued function.
Initial utility estimation based on conjoint analysis in many cases was affected by
studies in view of such axioms, which assumed an ordinal scale for the respondents’
preference judgment and used monotonic transformation methods such as monotone
analysis of variance (MONANOVA) for the estimation [e.g., (Shepard et al. 1972)].
In recent years, however, conjoint analysis using ordinary least squares based on
dummy variables has been used more frequently (Louviere 1988; Cattin and
Wittink 1989). While conjoint analysis using ordinary least squares requires, to be
exact, that the preference judgment is at or above the interval scale level, simulation
results of studies have shown that the result will be similar to MONANOVA
when monotonic transformation is performed on the assumption of an ordinal
scale (Carmone et al. 1978).
The following brieﬂy describes the conjoint analysis that uses least squares
contained in ordinary statistical packages. Conjoint analysis uses the following
172

linear model to express the response (assessment result) ri of a particular respondent
to the subject of assessment.
ri ¼
X

j¼1
uj kji


Where uj(kji) is the utility (partial utility) of element (attribute) j of the assess-
ment subject i at the level kji (simpliﬁed as ujk in the following).
The method of calculation for partial utility function uj in the estimation of
assessment result ri varies depending on whether the case is (1) discrete elements
for which a relation such as a linear equation and quadratic expression cannot
always be assumed between each level of the elements, (2) linear elements for
which a linear relation can be assumed between each level, or (3) quadratic function
factors [either with an ideal point (ideal factor) or anti-ideal point (anti-ideal
factor)] for which a quadratic function relation can be assumed between each
level. For linear elements, for instance, the estimated assessment value changes
with the linear function of level values, and for quadratic function factors, the
estimated assessment value changes with the quadratic function of level values. We
will estimate ujk by specifying these functions.
When obtaining the actual data, we will present all proﬁles of assessment sub-
jects to the respondents and collect the assessment scores and ranking data. How-
ever, an increased number of attributes considered and attribute levels will make it
more difﬁcult for the respondents to make assessments through ranking and other
means. We will need various measures to reduce their burden. The number of
proﬁles presented to the respondents is often reduced using an orthogonal design.
The decision maker must have the axiomatic property of additive conjoint
structure for such conjoint analysis to be feasible. When this condition is satisﬁed,
the decision maker can make a rational decision to a certain degree. The following
describes the additive conjoint structure (Luce and Tukey 1964; Krantz et al. 1971).
Let X1, X2,. . . , Xq be the set of possible values of q attributes, and let the
set of alternatives be the corresponding Cartesian product set, A ¼ X1  X2 
. . ..  Xq. A particular alternative x ∈A is given by x ¼ (x1, x2, . . ., xq),
y ¼ (y1, y2, . . ., yq), where x1, x2, . . ., xq, y1, y2, . . ., yq
are the corresponding
values of X1, X2, . . ., Xq, respectively. If the following relation, x ≿y ,
u(x)  u(y), holds, the following additive utility functions represent the prefer-
ence structure.

Krantz et al. (1971) pointed out that the additive utility function represented
the preference structure if and only if the additive conjoint structure holds.
For simplicity, we assume that two attributes determine the weak ordering, ≿.

Let X1, X2, be the set of possible values of q attributes, and let the set of alternatives
be the corresponding Cartesian product set, A ¼ X1  X2. Let x1, y1, a1 be three
independent levels of X1, and let x2, y2, a2 be three independent levels of X2. Krantz
et al. (1971) stated that the additive conjoint structure, ﬁrstly, requires the he
independence axiom, in which the ordinal relation between two levels of an
attribute is independent of any and all levels of the other attribute. That is, the
independence axiom holds if and only if, for x1, y1 ∈X1, (x1, x2) ≿(y1, x2) for
some x2 ∈X2 implies that (x1, y2) ≿(y1, y2) for every y2 ∈X2; and, for x2,
y2 ∈X2, (x1, x2) ≿(x1, y2) for some x1 ∈X1 implies that (y1, x2) ≿(y1, y2) for
every y1 ∈X1. Krantz et al. (1971) also requires other ﬁve axioms, that is, a weak
ordering, Thomsen condition, a restricted solvability, Archimedean property, and a
property that each attribute is essential.
Thomsen condition satisﬁes, for any x1, y1, a1 ∈X1, and x2, y2, a2 ∈X2,
(x1, a2) ~ (a1, y2) and (a1, x2) ~ (y1, a2) imply (x1, x2) ≿(y1, y2). A relation
≿on X1  X2
satisﬁes restricted solvability provided that: (1) whenever there
exist x1, y1, y1 ∈X1 and x2, y2, y2 ∈X2 for which
y1; y2
ð
Þ≿x1; x2
ð
Þ≿y1; y2

, then
there exists y1 ∈X1 such that (y1, y2) ~ (x1, x2); (2) a similar condition holds on
the second attribute. The Archimedean condition is the property of continuity
named after the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes. The Archimedean
condition states that any strictly bounded sequence on either attribute is ﬁnite
(Krantz et al. 1971). This property concerning inﬁnite sets for example are basically
untestable through direct observation. The property that attribute X1 is essential
requires there exists x1, y1 ∈X1 and p2 ∈X2 such that not ((x1, p2) ~ (y1, p2)).
The property of the essentiality requires similar condition holds for X2.
Multi-attribute decision-making that satisﬁes this additive conjoint system
guarantees the best decision to be made, which allows maximization of multi-
attribute utility. Whereas the empirical testing of solvability and Archimedean
conditions is nearly impossible, the conditions of single cancellation and double
cancellation can be tested empirically. Decision-making that satisﬁes these condi-
tions would be difﬁcult even in the study of double-attribute cases, which implies the
difﬁculty of the conditions established. In this sense, assuming an additive conjoint
system in multi-attribute decision-making is empirically difﬁcult, suggesting the
difﬁculty also of best decision-making.

Theoretical Examination When Multi-Attribute
Decision-Making Does Not Dissatisfy a Weak Order
Quantitative analysis is easy if multi-attribute decision-making can be expressed by
an additive system of utility of attributes as assumed in conjoint analysis and the
preference is a weak order. As explained below, however, multi-attribute decision-
making does not always have a weak order structure.
First, we will consider preference based on the dominance principle presented
below as an example of the property of connectivity of a weak order.
174

Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

3.1
Preference Based on the Dominance Principle
Preference that “x is indifferent or preferred to y” as the overall preference only
when the preference relation of all attributes is “x is indifferent or preferred to y.” In
other words, there is a type of preference based on the dominance principle that
becomes x ≿y only when “x ≿i y for all attributes i.” The following theorem holds
for the dominance principle based on the properties below.
1. Connectivity: Relation (8 x, y ∈A), x ≿y or y ≿x holds for arbitrary ele-
ments x, y of the set of alternatives A that is expressed by multiple attributes. In
addition, the preference relation x ≿i for different values of a given Attribute
i satisﬁes connectivity.
2. Transitivity: Relation x ≿z holds if x ≿y, y ≿z for arbitrary elements x, y,
z (8 x, y, z ∈A) of the set of alternatives A expressed by multiple attributes. In
addition, the preference relation x ≿i for different values of a given attribute i
satisﬁes transitivity.
3. No limitation of space for multi-attribute decision making problems: As long as
connectivity and transitivity are satisﬁed, any type of preference is applicable to
each attribute value in multi-attribute decision-making and any combination of
preferences can be made among the multiple attributes.
Theorem of decision-making based on the dominance principle Preference
based on the dominance principle under the above conditions (1), (2), and
(3) above, i.e., the preference that becomes
x ≿y only when “x ≿i y for all
attributes i” does not satisfy connectivity, is not a weak order, and involves no
multi-attribute value function that expresses a preference relation.
Proof Consider a case of preference based on the dominance principle in which
x ≿k y holds for a given attribute
k and y is weakly preferred to x for other
attributes. In this case, connectivity cannot be established because x ≿y and
y ≿x do not hold to begin with. The above theorem, therefore, holds true.
This result suggests that such decision-making based on the dominance principle
assumed for a number of psychological models would be difﬁcult to perform even
for ordinary quantitative analysis, which differs from the so-called principle of
utility maximization (Takemura 2011a, b).
3.2
Preference Based on the Principle of the Maximum
Number of Dominant Attributes
Preference that “x is indifferent or preferred to y” as the overall preference only
when the number of attributes whose preference relation is “x is indifferent or
preferred to y” is large. The following theorem holds also for this type of
reference.

Theorem of decision-making based on the principle of the maximum number
of dominant attributes Preference based on the principle of the maximum num-
ber of dominant attributes under the conditions of (1) connectivity, (2) transitivity,
and (3) no limitation of problem space is not a weak order and does not involve any
multi-attribute value function that expresses a preference relation.
Proof If the number of attributes is an even number and the number of dominant
attributes is the same, then none of them will be preferred. They will incomparable,
which will not satisfy connectivity. If the number of attributes is an odd number, a
cyclic order that does not satisfy transitivity can be made easily. The preference
relation above, therefore, is not weak order, which does not involve any multi-
attribute value function.
This consequently suggests that decision-making would be difﬁcult with multi-
ple attributes. Nevertheless, people must make decisions even under such
conditions.

Theorem of Impossibility of Multi-Attribute
Decision-Making
Decision-making for multiple purposes that considers pluralistic aspects such as
monetary value, ethical value, and aesthetic value has a structure called “multi-
attribute decision-making” in the decision theory. Multi-attribute decision-making
considers a multi-attribute alternative x as an alternative expressed by q-dimen-
sional attributes and the set of attributes X1, X2, . . ., Xq expressing various values
as the elements of the subspace of the Cartesian product set. In other words,
x ∈X1  X2  . . .  Xq:
Assuming a Cartesian product Xk  Xk for an arbitrary attribute k, we consider
that the ordered pair of this element expresses the preference relation of the attribute
value. If this preference relation is Rk, Rk is a subset of Xk  Xk. It is natural to
assume that Rk satisﬁes the properties of transitivity and connectivity for each
attribute as the basis of rationality.
When Rq ¼ R1  R2  . . .  Rq, we assume that the function to apply the
preference relation R based on multi-attribute decision-making to the elements of
Rq is called the multi-attribute value function. In other words, the multi-attribute
value function U can be expressed as shown below.
U : Rq ! R:
It is also natural to assume a weak order for the multi-attribute value function.
Although the deﬁnition of the multi-attribute value function presented up to this
point does not contradict the deﬁnition of an ordinary multi-attribute utility theory,
adding the following conditions would make it different from the system of an
176
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

ordinary multi-attribute utility theory. Such conditions are added because it would
presumably be more natural as a starting point of an argument to assume that, as
described in the Introduction, the incomparability (difﬁculty of comparison) of
various values and each value can only be judged in the sense of ordinal numbers.
In addition, as stated in the Introduction, one social choice theory that is used to
consider decision-making of social groups is Arrow’s general possibility theorem
(Arrow 1951) of democratic group decision-making. The conditions presented by
this theorem are of a multi-attribute decision-making problem and re-interpreting
the results in the general possibility theorem of the following multi-attribute
decision-making. This theorem indicates that composing a multi-attribute value
function that satisﬁes all the conditions below is impossible, meaning that condi-
tions to satisfy connectivity and transitivity, which are the conditions for rationality,
and the following conditions presumably appropriate for rational decision-making
do not hold simultaneously.
4.1
Conclusion of General Possibility Theorem
of Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
We assume that the Cartesian product of Sets X1, X2, . . ., Xq of attributes that
express various values is A, and its elements (ordered set expressing the q-term
relations) such as x, y, and z are alternatives described by multiple attributes. If there
are three or more multi-attribute alternatives described by two or more attributes,
there is no multi-attribute value function that satisﬁes the following conditions, and
satisfying these conditions simultaneously would be contradictory. The value
function that satisﬁes the conditions (1), (2), (4), and (5) under this condition of
three or more alternatives with two or more attributes is one-dimensional or
expresses an imposed preference relation. In this case, being one-dimensional
means that preference is expressed only by a single-attribute preference relation,
and being imposed means that a preference relation is determined for a given pair of
alternatives irrespective of the values of attributes.
1. Connectivity: Relation (8x, y ∈A), x ≿y or y ≿x holds for arbitrary elements
x, y of the set of alternatives A that is expressed by multiple attributes. Addi-
tionally, the preference relation x ≿i for different values of a given attribute
i satisﬁes connectivity.
2. Transitivity: Relation x ≿z holds if x ≿y, y ≿z for arbitrary elements x, y, z
(8x, y, z ∈A) of the set of alternatives A expressed by multiple attributes.
Additionally, the preference relation x ≿i for different values of a given attribute
i satisﬁes transitivity.
3. No limitation of space for multi attribute decision making problems: As long as
connectivity and transitivity are satisﬁed, a preference of any type is applicable
to each attribute value in multi-attribute decision-making and any combination
of preferences can be made among the multiple attributes.
4
Theorem of Impossibility of Multi-Attribute Decision-Making
177

4. Monotonicity (Pareto principle): If the preference relation of all attributes is
“x is preferred to y,” the overall preference is also “x is preferred to y” (In other
words, “x ≿i y for all attributes i “ results in x ≿y).
5. Independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA property): Preference for alterna-
tives x and y is determined only by ordering the attributes of these two alterna-
tives. In other words, they are unaffected by the attribute preference for the other
alternative z. (Therefore, ﬁnding out whether x ≿y holds only requires a proﬁle
describing either one or both of x ≿i y and y ≿i x hold for those speciﬁc x, y in all
cases of attribute i).
6. Multiple goals (multi-dimensionality): No preference is based only on a single
attribute (an attribute that always makes the overall preference of x over y if
the attribute prefers x to y) (In other words, there is no attribute i that makes
“x ≿y if x ≿i y for an arbitrary preference proﬁle). This condition demands
that people make decisions for multiple goals and never make decisions only on
one dimension.
If Arrow’s general possibility theorem (Arrow 1951) is interpreted in this
manner, then when three or more alternatives exist, no multi-attribute value func-
tion satisﬁes all the conditions for the six axioms related to the overall preference of
the decision-maker described above. In other words, the two conditions (prefer-
ences can be comparable and transitive) for the decision-maker to make rational
selection of alternatives and the four conditions suggesting the rationality of multi-
attribute decision-making do not hold true simultaneously, which implies that it is
extremely difﬁcult for the decision-maker to make the optimal and rational decision
in multi-attribute decision-making, which suggests that even if we seek rational
decision-making to achieve our welfare, it is likely impossible as long as we have
multiple dimensions and multiple goals. Considering that imposed decision-making
is not rational, a rational decision might require decision-making based on a
one-dimensional attribute. Although this seems to be rather counter-intuitive, it
might be the key to explaining why an individual seeking rationality intends to
make a one-dimensional judgment.

Scale of Decision Strategy and Multi-Attribute
Decision-Making
Although the discussion presented above suggests the difﬁculty of making the best
decision in multi-attribute decision-making, the following examines how people
actually make their decisions. In our laboratory, we use the following scale of
178
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

decision-making for decision strategy in multi-attribute decision-making (Ideno
et al. 2012).
Various biases and heuristics have been reported in the context of behavioral
decision theory; there has not been much progress in the examination of the causes.
Accordingly, we have developed a scale by application of the anomalies in behav-
ioral decision theory that have been described in earlier reports.
We conducted an internet survey. Survey participants were 1,600 individuals,
including age cohorts of 200 each (100 men and 100 women consisting of 20 each
in their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s) assigned to seven locations (Sapporo, Sendai,
Tokyo metropolitan area, Nagoya, Osaka, Hiroshima and Matsuyama, and Fuku-
oka). The scale of decision-making used for this study was developed based on
items extracted from various theories and phenomena related to decision-making.
The following are some examples of such items. These include “the most pre-
ferred alternative would be the same in any combination of alternatives to
compare” for transitivity, “there should be a combination of alternatives that
could not be compared” for comparability, “would examine whether a fairly
satisfactory alternative exists” for satisﬁcing, and “Prefer to avoid a decision
whose probability is not known” for tendency of uncertainty avoidance. Table 13.1
presents details.
We used the survey results to perform factor analysis for the decision-making
scale using the principal factor method for factor extraction and Promax rotation for
axis rotation. Table 13.2 presents the results, including the ﬁve factors—(1) careful
consideration, (2) uncertainty preference, (3) uncertainty avoidance, (4) satisﬁcing,
and (5) consistency—that were extracted. The factors correlated mutually, and a
correlation coefﬁcient of 0.3 or above was observed between the careful
consideration factor and three other factors (0.33 between careful decision-making
factor and uncertainty factor, 0.33 between the careful decision-making factor
and satisﬁcing factor, and 0.39 between the careful decision-making factor and
consistency factor). Furthermore, a factor correlation of 0.4 was found between the
uncertainty avoidance factor and satisﬁcing factor.
The results presented above have revealed the central role in decision strategy
played by the careful consideration type of decision-making. The act of making the
best decision is included in this careful consideration type of decision-making,
demonstrating the high correlation between decision-making based on multiple
attributes and attempts to make the best decision. Table 13.3 shows that the
satisﬁcing strategy positioned opposite of careful decision-making maintains a
high correlation with careful decision-making and also that it has strong ties with
uncertainty avoidance. This also supports the ﬁnding that a psychological
connection exists between best decision making and the satisﬁcing type of
decision-making.

Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

As demonstrated up to this point, seeking the best decision is related to consid-
ering multiple attributes in decision-making. As suggested by the earlier theorem of
impossibility, however, multi-attribute decision-making make the best decision-
making extremely difﬁcult. Then, how do people make their decisions in real-life
decision-making?
After given a lecture on the difﬁculty of decision strategy and multi-attribute
decision-making in the class on decision theory in the Department of Psychology at
Waseda University and the University of Tokyo, 38 graduate and undergraduate
students aged between 20 and 32 were asked to discuss how decisions should be
made when the best decision cannot be made in multi-attribute decision-making.
After the discussion, they were asked to select the most preferable alternative from
(1) making the ultimate decision by abstracting the multiple attributes and using
only one-dimensional attributes (change to one dimension), (2) compromising the
best decision to make satisﬁcing decision-making (satisﬁcing), and (3) distorting
their understanding to believe that the best decision is made (psychological dom-
inance structuring). As a consequence, alternative 1 was selected by 11 students,
alternative 2 was chosen by 16 students, and alternative 3 was chosen by 11 stu-
dents. Therefore, almost one-third of the respondents would attempt to make the
attributes one-dimensional in multi-attribute decision-making. Furthermore, many
of them attempted to make the attributes one-dimensional based on monetary
values and beneﬁts. It is also interesting that nearly one-third of the respondents
would adhere to the best decision even by distorting their understanding. More than
a half of them would go through psychological manipulation to turn the attributes to
one-dimensional or distort their understanding if the best decision cannot be made
in multi-attribute decision-making.
5.2
Mental Ruler Model in Multi-Attribute Decision Making
The ﬁndings presented above suggest that rational decision-making is extremely
difﬁcult in general considering the multiple attributes involved and that decision-
making based on one-dimensional attribute satisﬁes rationality. This analysis,
however, is still based on an ideological perspective. In view of behavioral decision
theory that describes the actual decision-making, how do people tend to make
decisions in their daily life?
Based on the conclusions presented to this point and through decision-making
studies and behavior observation, the author proposes a psychological model called
the “mental ruler model,” assuming that people tend to make a decision based on a
one-dimensional attribute in multi-attribute decision-making (Takemura 1998,
2001). This model includes the assumption that, for instance, people tend to make
the overall evaluation of universities based only on their standard scores merely
representing the difﬁculty of their entrance examinations, or people’s performance
is assessed one-dimensionally based only on their sales ﬁgures, the number of
papers written, or some criterion such as an impact factor.

5.2.1
Qualitative Description of “Mental Ruler”
Basic Hypothesis of the Model and Basic Property of Mental Ruler
From this point, the “mental ruler” model is presented to solve the problems
described previously and to develop basic ideas of a decision frame model (Tversky
and Kahneman 1981) and psychological purse model (Kojima 1959, 1994).
The basic hypothesis of this model postulates that people make decisions as if
they have a ruler. In everyday life, it is often said metaphorically that every person
uses a ruler with a different value to make decisions. Although a metaphor of this
kind is valid only in our daily conversations, if we consider this metaphor thor-
oughly and scientiﬁcally, it is more useful than we might think to explain contin-
gent decision-making. Objects of the mental ruler are divisible into gain and loss
areas just as the decision frame model, but phenomena that cannot be classiﬁed into
gain and loss areas can be included, such as the judgment on personal impressions
such as those related to generosity or calmness, or a judgment related to probability.
Let us ﬁrst consider the basic meaning of “ruler.” A ruler is used to measure
“length”. The reason people use a ruler is, of course, that merely looking at an
object is not good in judgment on length because it causes unevenness or distortion.
Psychologically, people cannot judge with conﬁdence without using a ruler. We use
a ruler as a standard for judgment. A physical ruler enables us to judge length with
certainty and relief. What do we do if we have no physical ruler? I assume that
people construct a ruler internally in their mind in a sense for such a situation. This
can be regarded as a creative process in recognition of decision-making problem.
Next, one can consider the mental ruler characteristics further, and capture and
discuss the characteristics of decision-making metaphorically.
1. Basic Property 1: The ruler has graduation.
The author assumes that people make a decision based on the graduation of the
mental ruler, which can be ﬁne or rough, just as units of millimeter or centimeter
on the graduation of a physical ruler. For example, let us consider a judgment of
price. With ﬁne graduation, consumers must be sensitive to a difference by even
1 cent. In contrast, with rough graduation, they can be insensitive to a difference
by several units of $100. Such a difference of sensibility about prices can be
described using the ﬁneness or roughness of the graduation of the mental ruler.
As described later, we can imagine the roughness of the graduation of the ruler
might change for the same person depending on the situation.
2. Basic Property 2: The ruler length is bounded (boundedness).
This property seems quite basic, but the metaphor denotes a great deal. For
example, for judgment related to price, we cannot judge easily whether the price
of an object exceeds the length of the mental ruler greatly in both directions,
i.e. when the price is extremely high or extremely low. Consumers might joint
several rulers when the ruler is too short, but the elicited judgment probably
varies widely.
184
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

3. Basic Property 3: The ruler is one-dimensional.
A physical ruler measures a one-dimensional property called length. Even
though people make a judgment founded on multidimensional information, it
is quite possible that they ﬁnalize the judgment one-dimensionally. In Japan,
many people think that education based on the standardized value of test scores
is not good, but simultaneously they tend to be concerned about the standardized
value of test scores very much. People like to check rankings of various kinds,
such as a “best seller” ranking at a shop. These tendencies seem to indicate an
important facet of human nature: one-dimensional judgment.
Basic Function of Mental Ruler
Based on the basic properties of the mental ruler described above, some theoretical
predictions about its basic functions are presented below.
1. Basic Function 1: People construct an appropriate mental ruler depending on the
situation.
People construct a mental ruler with appropriate graduation and of appropriate
size, depending on the situation. People do this so naturally that they usually do
not perceive it themselves. This phenomenon, however, can often be perceived if
we compare purchasing situations. For example, in Japan, if a person thinks of
purchasing a new car, a consumer constructs a mental ruler with graduation of
$100 unit when negotiating with a car dealer about the price or optional
equipment because a brand-new car often costs more than $10,000. In such a
situation, a price differential of several $1 is treated as an error, and is seldom
examined. The same consumer, however, goes to a supermarket after the car
dealer and can be satisﬁed with the price of a package of 10 eggs that is lower
than usual by 20 cents, or be disappointed by a price that is higher than usual by
30 cents and might not buy the eggs. A person concerned about a price of
10-cents units to make a judgment or a decision in this situation. Similarly, we
can presume that people speciﬁcally examine the ongoing situation and con-
struct the situation subjectively, and construct a mental ruler upon the situation.
2. Basic Function 2: Reference points or endpoints of the ruler are applied differ-
ently depending on the situation.
For example, in judging on price, a reference point changes according to the
object group that is compared. Either a price that is lower than that at another
shop or than a prior price makes the reference point of the ruler move to a
different position. A judgment of the price or the decision on the purchase might
be changed. The ruler endpoints are also assumed to change according to the
situation such as a comparison of groups of objects.
3. Basic Function 3: Graduation of the ruler becomes particularly ﬁner around the
reference point and the endpoints (nonlinearity of the ruler).
This property does not apply to a physical ruler. For instance, a consumer who is
trying to buy an article for the budget of $100 becomes more sensitive to the
5

185

difference between $95 and $100, than that between $50 and $55. It becomes
extremely difﬁcult to evaluate if the comparing prices exceed the endpoints. For
instance, if the budget is $100, then the consumer becomes insensitive to the
difference between $150 and $155. The evaluation becomes unstable.
4. Basic Function 4: More knowledge or more involvement creates ﬁner graduation
of the ruler.
If a consumer has much knowledge related to an article, alternatively if a
consumer is involved in an article to a great degree, the graduation of the ruler
becomes ﬁner. Then the consumer becomes sensitive to small differences, which
engenders classiﬁcation of similar articles very precisely. Therefore, it happens
that the consumer tends to buy the article at a higher price if and only if its
quality is only a little better than that of the others.
5. Basic Function 5: Even if information is given multidimensionally, a
one-dimensional judgment is elicited using the mental ruler.
This not only denotes that people merely simplify the problem while avoiding
the data processing load. Consumers might construct another ruler to cope with
the situation as a kind of creative process in the recognition of decision-making
problem. For instance, by reading fashion magazines or through repeated shop-
ping experiences, consumers construct a ruler such as “good taste” based on the
complicated information about clothes to make a purchase decision. The mental
ruler in this case is also fundamentally one-dimensional.
6. Basic Function 6: It is difﬁcult to compare different mental rulers.
It is presumably difﬁcult for consumers to compare and to evaluate various
mental rulers themselves they have constructed mentally, depending on the
situation. Such contradictory judgments or decisions among situations such as
examples of a car purchase and an egg purchase cannot be perceived by the
consumers themselves, which is true because people usually speciﬁcally exam-
ine the situation, construct the situation subjectively, and construct a mental
ruler on the situation. It therefore becomes difﬁcult to construct more than two
rulers for one situation from the cognitive load perspective. People sometimes
use a different ruler for the same value from an economic rationality perspective,
or use the same ruler for situations in which they should use different rulers.
Compatibility of Stimulus–Response Structures as a Mental Ruler
Construction Principle
Lastly, I discuss the mental ruler construction principle.
I presume that the compatibility of stimulus–response structures plays an impor-
tant role in constructing the mental ruler. The compatibility of stimulus–response
structures denotes compatibility between structural characteristics of the input
mode and response mode (Selart 1997). The efﬁciency of the information process
in a judgment or a decision increases if they match or correspond well. I assume that
a consumer constructs a mental ruler as an input mode corresponding to a given
response mode. For instance, the purchase choice situation “to buy or not to buy”
has a two-valued response mode; the consumer constructs a two-valued mental
186
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

ruler, “good or bad.” However, if a consumer is asked to evaluate an article by
ranking or by points, then the consumer constructs a mental ruler of multiple values.
A consumer has difﬁculty in judgment if the stimulus–response structure does
not correspond well. For instance, if a mental ruler has already been constructed,
then a consumer cannot judge precisely if the ruler only has rough graduation, and
vice versa.
From this compatibility of a stimulus–response structure perspective, too, the
reason why the mental ruler is one-dimensional might be explained. The environ-
ment’s structure requires a one-dimensional response mode of the judgment or the
decision. Therefore, the mental ruler becomes one-dimensional. In addition, one
can also assume that we often use linguistic terms of dual values such as “good or
not good” to evaluate merchandise and so forth, which is true because decisions are
constructed in dual-value response modes such as “to buy or not to buy.”
5.2.2
Mental Ruler Explanation Using Set Theory
and Its Mathematical Description
For simpliﬁcation, an explanation is presented here using set theory for the mental
ruler and its partial mathematical description. Below, I elucidate the qualitative and
metaphorical description that was mentioned earlier by adding the structure.
Therefore, no qualitative or metaphorical description is perfectly retrieved. Nev-
ertheless, to create a psychometric model or to conduct various quantitative
experiments, we must undertake formulation to some degree. To that end, the
following is attempted.
Deﬁnition of the Situation
Let X0 denote the whole situation to be discussed. Actually, X0 is generally regarded
as a ﬁnite set. Let (S0  X0), which is a subset of X0, denote the focused situation.
For instance, presuming that X0 denotes the purchasing situation in a supermarket,
and presuming that S can be a situation in which one must decide whether to buy
some cola or not, or whether to buy a set of ﬁve notebooks or not, etc., then problem
here is the focused situation that is determined cognitively by the decision-maker.
In fact, although it is more natural to presume that a situation S0 denotes a subset of
X0 for the Cartesian product (S0  X0  X0  . . .  X0) because situations are often
a set of relation in a situation, one can presume a state S a subset of X0 for simplicity.
An important point here is that S 0 is subject to how the decision-maker pays
attention: S0 will have a different element if the same person speciﬁcally examines
another side of the same situation, according to one’s mood. Nevertheless, the
hypothesis here is that S0 is a commonly subjective situation that can be recognized
by other people, too. S0, which can be denoted extensively, is a set of events which
exist over an individual’s subject. For example, whether an article of $10 sells for
$2 off or for 20 % off is the same situation, as long as the meaning of the event is
stated denotatively.
5
Descriptive Analysis of Multi-Attribute Decision-Making and the Psychology. . .
187

Deﬁnition of Subjective Situation
Next, we assess the subjective situation. Let the limited set X denote the entire
subjective situation, whereas S represents the subjective situation surrounding the
decision-maker. Therefore, X0, the set of the whole situation, corresponds to X, and
S0, the subjective situation, corresponds to S. One element in a situation, however,
can have more than two elements in a subjective situation because the compatibility
of X0 and X, and S0 and S are a many-to-one mapping (univalent correspondence)
from the subjective situations to the objective situations. For instance, although
both descriptions—“$2 off” and “20 % off”—for an article of $10 represent the
same choice as long as they denote an event extensionally, they can be different
elements in a subjective situation. Furthermore, even if in the same situation S0,
plural subjective situations are regarded as existing, such as the subjective situation
S1, S2, . . ., Sn which is subject to the mode of the mental structure. Consequently,
mapping f to the situation S0 is regarded as being subject to the mode of the mental
structure on the decision-making problem and can exist like f1, f2, . . ., fn. The set of
these functions F ( f1, f2, . . ., fn ∈F) is regarded as constrained according to the
cognitive ability of human beings [e.g., (Holyoak and Thagard 1995)]. Finally, the
mapping from the subjective situation to the objective situation, f, is not onto
mapping generally. Therefore, elements of the subjective situation do not neces-
sarily cover the elements of a situation but can be omitted partially, which can be
considered because of the cognitive constraints of the decision-maker’s attention,
memory capacity or searching ability. Presumably, mapping has the direction to
promote the stimulus–response compatibility stated earlier, or to create the domi-
nance structure (Montgomery 1983, 1993) in a decision-making problem.
Structure of a Mental Ruler
Therefore, the mental ruler can be deﬁned. The mental ruler approximately differs
with positive and negative areas, just like the value function in the prospect theory.
The greater the number, the better it is in one case and the worse it is in another.
Nevertheless, as stated earlier, the objects of the mental ruler model also include
rather neutral ones such as probability judgment, not only the gain and loss areas.
For simpliﬁcation, however, this matter is discussed only in the positive area.
Moreover, the author ﬁrst discusses the mental ruler model for a case in which
the evaluation object as an element of subjective situation S can be described
objectively using an additive measurement such as price, length, or size. Then,
the mental ruler can be described as a set function from the subsets of the subjective
situation S to one-dimensional real number space R.
First consider a case in which an element x of the subjective situation, S can be
described objectively as an additive function to price, length, proportion, probabil-
ity, and so forth, as m(x) ∈R. Consider a function m from S to one-dimensional
real number space R, m: S ! R. For instance, let m(x) denote the discount rate
m for an article x. Moreover, consider the mental ruler using the function v from
188
13

one-dimensional real number space R, which is mapped by m, to one-dimensional
real number space R, which describes the evaluation value v: R ! R. Here, v has
the following property.

Formulas (13.1) and (13.2) denote the boundedness of the mental ruler. For
example, the evaluation for the relative income of $0 is 0, where the evaluation for
the evaluation object that has the most value in the subjective situation is a real
number k. Here, x* denotes x, which maximizes m(x). For instance, when the upper
limit of a relative income is regarded as $10,000, then the alternative, which gives
$10,000 is x*. Alternatively, considering the evaluation for a price using the mental
ruler, if the upper limit of the budget is $100, then the article equivalent to the $100
is equivalent to x*. Formula (13.3) describes the monotonicity of the mental ruler,
which suggests that evaluation using the mental ruler does not exceed k in the
subjective situation S. Moreover, if the mental ruler is unique with regard to the
positively proportional transformation (the similarity transformation), by an ade-
quate scale transformation, then
v m x

x ∈S
As stated earlier, x* denotes x which maximizes m(x), where x* always denotes
the same quantity in the following discussion. Additionally, for simpliﬁcation, the
evaluation function of the mental ruler is presumed to hold always for Formula
(13.4) in the discussion below.
Subadditivity of the Mental Ruler and Its Mathematical Description
Although the mental ruler has monotonicity of Formula (13.3), it has no additivity
such as the following.
v m x
ð Þ þ m y
ð Þ
ð
Þ ¼ v m x

ð

ð13:5Þ
The mental ruler is regarded as holding subadditivity of the following two kinds
(Tversky and Fox 1995; Tversky and Wakker 1995).

Formula (13.6) shows that the evaluation function becomes concave downward
when m (x) is low. This property is the same as that of the weighting function for
lower probability in the prospect theory; it is also the same as that of diminishing
marginal utility in the utility theory.

This property is related to an event for which the evaluation function of the
mental ruler becomes convex downward when m(x) is high. This is the same as
the property of the certainty effect indicating that the weighting of probability
1 is much greater than the probability less than 1, as explained using the prospect
theory.
The mental ruler model, however, forecasts that this property holds not only
with the weighting probability but also with the values of the outcomes. This
forecast is completely contrary to the property of the diminishing marginal utility
in the utility theory or in the prospect theory. In the utility theory or the prospect
theory, a function that is concave downward is always assumed, although the
mental ruler model includes the assumption that a function exists that is convex
downward around the upper bound. For example, when negotiating on a discount
for the price, the sensibility rises around the target. Let m(x*) denote the targeted
gain for the negotiation. The function becomes convex downward around the
targeted price, but it becomes concave downward around the zero gain, where m
(x) ¼ 0. The function which holds the property of Formulas (13.6) and (13.7) is
an S-shaped function. An S-shaped mathematical description that has such a
property is

Prelec (1998) originally used this function as a weighting function for probabil-
ity (see Fig. 13.1). Here, m(x)/m(x*) takes interval [0, 1]; its price interval is also
[0,
1]. Then the ﬁxed point becomes 1/e  0.36 irrespective of the value of γ
(Wu and Gonzalez 1996).

Here, if λ ¼ 1, then it is the same as probability weighting function of Karmakar

function presented by Tversky and Kahneman (1992).
190
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

Wu and Gonzalez (1996) conducted a psychological experiment to investigate
the weighting function to probability, applied functions of many kinds, and proved
that the function by Tversky and Kahneman (1992) showed high applicability,
as did the function of Prelec (1998). They also proved that although the weighting
function is concave downward around the probability 0.40, it becomes convex
downward if it exceeds about 0.40. Although the weighting function they obtained
is expressed only against the probability, it can be assumed that the expertise of the
same kind is obtainable for the value such as money, from the mental ruler
perspective. Additionally, it is already proved that the evaluation function of the
number of surviving lives is S-shaped, as shown in the evaluation experiment later.
Moreover, the following function has been proposed neither in the research on
the existing probability weighting function nor in the research on the prospect
theory, but is now being proposed in Takemura (1998), and is assumed to be an
evaluation function that satisﬁes upper subadditivity and lower subadditivity, as

Therein, if λ ¼ 1, then it is the same as probability weighting function of
Karmakar (1978) (see Fig. 13.2); if λ ¼ 1/γ, then it is the same as the probability
weighting function of Tversky and Kahneman (1992).
This section brieﬂy described that the mathematical system underlying utility
theory has difﬁculty in completely explaining contingent decision-making. Subse-
quently, the author introduced the qualitative decision frame model (Tversky and
Kahneman 1981) and the psychological purse model (Kojima 1959, 1994) of
contingent decision-making. Finally, this chapter introduced the “mental ruler”
model to explain contingent decision-making qualitatively. The basic hypotheses
were considered along with the basic function of the mental ruler and the basic
structural theories. The concept of the model is that people judge or make decisions
using a mental ruler that is constructed for subjective situation, which was struc-
tured as a support so that a one-dimensional mental ruler can be easily made on
it. The main characteristic of the model is that—contrary to the recent utility theory
or prospect theory—it treats utility or value and subjective probability as funda-
mentally the same evaluation function. The author also described the instability of
the judgment in the area beyond the length of the mental ruler: not as in previous
theories. The mathematical model was presented for its more rigorous formulation
in the future.

the
one-dimensionality of the evaluation in judgment and decision-making. The dis-
cussion, however, has restrictions. In some cases, people evaluate multidimensional
attributes and evaluate information multidimensionally. For example, cases are
often observed in which people make a judgment or a decision while consciously
considering multidimensional information as assumed in multi-attribute attitude
theory or multi-attribute decision-making theory. It will be necessary in the future
to clarify situations in which one-dimensional evaluation, as assumed in the mental

ruler model, occurs easily, and situations in which evaluation considering
multidimensional information is done more often.
6
Focusing Attention on the Causes of One-Dimensional
Decision-Making and “Good Decision-Making”
Apart from Takemura et al., Gigerenzer and his group have been actively claiming in
recent years that people make decisions based on one-dimensional attributes. They
are proposing the concept of fast and frugal heuristics and developing their studies of
judgment and decision making. Initially, Gigerenzer and Goldstein (1996) used a
computer simulation to illustrate that when selecting a city that is more populated
than the other from two alternatives, a decision made using recognition heuristics,
based only on whether the respondents knew the cities or not, would still be rational.
They demonstrated that a property not directly related to the issue of comparative
judgment such as the ease of recognition might be an important factor in the decision
(Gigerenzer and Goldstein 1996). The series of studies begun with this were not
originally research on decision making, but were attempts to present a counterex-
ample to conventional research on judgment biases that availability heuristics
relying on memory would engender irrational judgment. In 2006, however, by
expanding the idea of fast and frugal heuristics to decision-making and by develop-
ing the concept of priority heuristics (Brandsta¨tter et al. 2006), they demonstrated
that various decision-making phenomena can be explained solely based on the
assumption that decisions were made easily for only a single reason in most cases.
They questioned the basic assumption of decision theory made in expected utility
theory and prospect theory that people made decisions by combining the utility of
the result, value, and probability. This aspect is shared by the mental ruler model.
It similar to the assumption of the simple, one-dimensional process of decision-
making based on the attention mechanism of the contingent focus model
described next.
Although one-dimensional decision-making might lead the process in a rational
form, it is exposed to some risk. In the case of developing the reconstruction policy
after the Great East Japan Earthquake, for example, determining a policy based
only on the economic efﬁciency or on safety without considering the economic
aspect would not necessarily be “good” decision-making. In fact, many people tend
to make assessments based on limited attributes and tend to draw conclusions even
for extremely important decision-making, which should be given a warning and
remedied in some cases.
Why do people often make decisions based on one-dimensional attributes?
One might explain that one-dimensional assessment makes it easier to ﬁnd an
optimal alternative that satisﬁes various conditions for rationality and gives people
psychological contentment. In other words, this claims that people distort objective
recognition and made decisions without considering information from other attri-
butes. The author believes that explaining such a phenomenon, including such
psychologically defensive reasons, involves the psychological property called
192
13
Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

focus of attention. Focus of attention means that people’s attention is drawn to
speciﬁc attributes because of linguistic messages, image expressions, etc., and that
decisions are often made based on the assessment of such attributes attracting the
attention. Why does people’s decision-making process depend on the situation or
path? One reason might be that the range of our attention is limited and that
decision-making is led by our attention. Based on that idea, we have developed a
decision-making model called the contingent focus model (Takemura 1994),
described in Chap. 10, to explain and forecast decision-making. When this model
is generalized, the amount of attention to focus actually changes depending on the
condition factors, as illustrated in Fig. 13.2, which causes the weight of decision-
making attributes to change. Because decisions are made based on the changes, the
decision-making process is expected to depend on the situation. Path dependency is
explainable by the mode of making decisions that does not incorporate information
related to all alternatives because of such a focus of attention and limitation of the
attention range (Takemura 1996).
Those points explained above have been clariﬁed to some degree by experimen-
tation. We use the method of monitoring information acquisition with an eye
movement measurement system to examine decision-making processes. Eye-
movement-measuring devices include the contact type shown in Fig. 13.3 and the
non-contact type in Fig. 13.4, which we use according to the research purposes. The
contact type allows the test subject to move freely, which has the beneﬁt of
measuring the actual eye movement while making, for instance, a purchase deci-
sion. However, the range of vision shifts as the test subject moves, which makes
data collection more difﬁcult. We analyzed the decision-making process to seek the
number of times the test subject focused the users’ attention at each stage of
decision-making, the average span of attention, the number of alternatives to
which attention is devoted, and to the share of attention paid to the alternative
that was eventually chosen. Our ﬁndings suggest, as shown in Fig. 13.5, that rather

than equally observing all information available, people tend to make decisions
based on considerably asymmetric information. This might be the reason why the
process of people’s decision-making tends to be situation-dependent and path-
dependent (Fujii and Takemura 2001a, b, 2003, 2014; Takemura 1994).
The author and others generalized the contingent focus model described in
Chap. 10 and established the function that maintains the following multi-attribute
preference relations as the expression of multi-attribute utility function (Takemura
et al. 2004). If αxk is the parameter of focus of attention to the kth attribute of
Alternative x, then only the parameter of attribute k is considerably large, which
indicates that one-dimensional decision-making is taking place. Taking the
logarithm of both sides while assuming that U is a positive value illustrates
clearly that the relative sizes of the focus of attention has a linear effect on the
logarithmic utility.

The author and others are proposing a pshological model, designated as the
contingent focus model, to explain decision-making based on such a focus of
attention. This model explains that, in decision-making for risk taking, for exam-
ple, the risk attitude changes depending on the level of attention focused on the
result and probability. The author and others have revealed from psychological
experiments of decision-making that results of decision-making that differ from
those of prospect theory can be derived by manipulating attention to attribute
information.
The contingent focus model suggests that preference changes by calling peo-
ple’s attention to other attributes. Based on such a perspective, Fujii et al. (2002)
and Takemura and Fujii (2014) demonstrated that in decision-making not only for
gambling tasks, but in that related to social dilemmas such as trafﬁc issues,
people’s cooperation can be encouraged to a degree and some decisions to solve
social dilemmas can be made by promoting attention to speciﬁc attributes with a
payoff matrix. The fact that decision-making can be changed by attention implies
that “good decision-making” might be possible by changing how information is
presented and what information is emphasized. Calling people’s attention to
other attributes might cause confusion or reduce conﬁdence in rational
decision-making. However, it is important for the performance of pluralistic
decision-making.

Towards Good Decision Making
Although Aristotle developed an argument on good decision-making on the
assumption that the highest good existed, does one-dimensional value really
exist? In the proof of Aristotle, something called welfare purportedly represented
the highest good. However, he might have suggested welfare to be not only pleasure
or not only virtue but something more pluralistic. According to Isaiah Berlin,
however, the ﬁrst one to argue the plurality of value in Western thought was
Niccolo Machiavelli. Berlin was the one to explain it more clearly. Plurality of
value means, for example, that when respect for human life is extremely important,
freedom is also important. These two values are both important in an absolute sense
but only one of them can be maintained under certain circumstances. A good
example of an extreme situation is a dilemma in life, many of which are presented
in literature as well. In reality, people argued at the time of the Great East Japan
Earthquake whether to issue a large amount of government bonds to fund recon-
struction in view of respect for human life and welfare or whether to prevent any
issuance of a large amount of government bonds in view of economic stability of
the country. This also demonstrates that coexistence of at least two values can
present difﬁcult circumstances. In this case, it is understandable that the two values
are both important in an absolute sense and that both are reasonably important.
Currently, there might be three levels to the argument of plurality of value
(Crowder 1994). The ﬁrst is to perceive the plurality of value as a fact. The second
is to require the plurality of value normatively. The last is a meta-ethical argument.
Among these, the strongest argument for the value of plurality is the third one. The
strong stance of plurality of value at the meta-ethical level is represented by
Berlin’s succession or interpretation of intellectual inheritance (Berlin 1969, 1990).
Berlin described the diversity of value, impossible coexistence and conﬂict of
different values, and the incommensurability of value. These three elements con-
stitute the core of today’s value pluralism. Although people who argue the plurality
of value generally approve these three aspects, their opinions are divided particu-
larly in connection with the concept of incommensurability of value. George
Crowder organized the incommensurability of value also into three stances
(Crowder 2002).
The ﬁrst is to interpret the incommensurability as an incomparability of value,
which is the strongest interpretation of incommensurability. The second is to
interpret incommensurability as the immeasurability of value, constituting the
weakest interpretation of incommensurability. In this interpretation, only the
returning of different values to “utility” just as in utilitarianism and quantitatively
comparing them is rejected. Ordinal ordering of value, however, is allowed. The
last is, in effect, a stance between these two, which is interpreted as the
unrankability (impossibility of ranking) of value. This is the stance of Crowder
himself. Crowder explained his value pluralism based on the following four aspects.
1. Existence of universal value: Certain values are universal and objective.
2. Plurality: Many values have crucial importance to people’s prosperity.
7
Towards Good Decision Making
197

3. Incommensurability: Values cannot be ranked in a manner that is irrelevant to
the context or in an abstract manner.
4. Conﬂict of values: Conﬂict of values is not accidental but is unavoidable in the
human world [(Crowder 2002), pp. 45–46].
In this chapter, too, we consider the stance of value pluralism argued by
Crowder. The following discusses what good decision-making would be like
when viewed from such a perspective. In other words, a “good decision” is regarded
as pluralistic and to satisfy at least pluralistic standards such as formal rationality,
welfare, justice, beauty, and virtue.
Decision-making from a pluralistic perspective is psychologically difﬁcult, as
discussed in this chapter, and it is also difﬁcult in view of form. According to the
author, however, psychological ease or rationality from a formal perspective does
not necessarily engender a “good decision.” In an extreme case, decision-making
based on one-dimensional attributes satisﬁes rationality and facilitates the best
decision-making. Although one-dimensional decision-making is easy for many
people to perform, it is not necessarily preferable considering the plurality of
value. In modern society, serious conditions arise in various situations, information
to be processed comes in large amounts, and decision-makers carry a heavy
psychological burden, which might increasingly drive people to resort to psycho-
logically easy and formally rational decision-making. People are seemingly
inclined towards the selection of decision-making falling into excessive formalism,
for example, by overly applying legal compliance and accountability or demanding
procedural rationality. In terms of value standards, many people seem to be
attempting to make decisions only in view of formal procedures and fairness.
Takahashi et al. (2010) conducted a questionnaire survey and suggested that the
psychological tendency to pursue such formalism derived not from a moral sense,
but from the intention of avoiding responsibility. Individuals showing a strong
tendency to act this way were actually less altruistic than others. In addition, past
studies in social psychology reveal that people seeking rationality tend to be rather
susceptible to depression and a low level of subjective welfare (Schwartz
et al. 2002). Considering these aspects, in the author’s opinion, purposely placing
oneself in the multidimensional confusion to consider multidimensional decision-
making while recognizing rationality as an important standard might lead to “good
decision-making.”
Multidimensional thinking might cause information overload and might engen-
der more confusion. People are therefore inclined towards one-dimensional think-
ing. However, what could be done to prevent such a tendency? One strategy is to
narrow down the attributes to a few important ones or to abstract multiple attributes
appropriately. In this way, the information load can be reduced by narrowing it
down to a smaller number of attributes. Another measure is to make a decision
through a non-compensatory form of lexicographic or conjunctive (satisfactory)
method while considering multiple attributes rather than an additive method. The
information load might be reduced by avoiding a complex combination of infor-
mation across multiple attributes to make decisions in a simple manner.

Behavioral Decision Theory and Good Decision Making

Unlike the conventional multi-attribute utility theory, this chapter did not
assume the possibility of tradeoffs among the attributes in advance when norma-
tively considering multi-attribute decision-making. As suggested by Arrow’s gen-
eral possibility theorem (1951), however, we found that rational decision-making
would be impossible without the assumption of attribute tradeoffs unless the
decision-making is based on one-dimensional standards. Conversely, both rational
and appropriate standards of decision-making could be satisﬁed only allowing
attribute tradeoffs. For the types of tradeoffs that should be performed, experts of
multi-attribute utility theory are proposing superior techniques. Attribute tradeoffs
are extremely important, at least prescriptively, despite the unknown extent of
justiﬁcation allowed from a normative perspective.
The author, however, is uncertain as to whether it is really appropriate to perform
tradeoffs so easily for any type of decision-making problem. For example, the
problem should be solved easily if a decision is made by trading off human life for
economic efﬁciency to determine a price per person. However, making a decision
based on such a scheme itself is unethical and might not necessarily result in a
“good decision.” Considering that alternatives across multiple attributes is impor-
tant to prevent simple, one-dimensional decision-making.
In the ﬁeld of normative decision theory related to what constitutes good
decision-making, the conventional normative decision theory often considered
“goodness” in view of the rationality of form. This chapter has exempliﬁed from
the formal perspective that multi-attribute decision-making satisﬁes such rationality
criteria as transitivity and connectivity and that conditions deemed appropriate in
multi-attribute decision-making contradict when multi-attribute decision-making is
viewed from the above formal perspective. By interpreting Arrow’s general possi-
bility theorem (1951), one ﬁnds that rational decision-making is possible only when
it is based on one-dimensional standards. Additionally, in view of behavioral
decision theory, which is the descriptive decision theory of the actual decision-
making process, decision-making based on one-dimensional standards occurs eas-
ily; pluralistic decision-making tends to be avoided attributable to the nature of
people’s attention (Takemura 2011a, b) Yet for decision-making for which the
result is important, making the decision based only on one value is extremely
dangerous considering that people hold multidimensional values. To produce a
“good decision,” it is important to regard the decision comprehensively by focusing
on a plurality of values. From a prescriptive or normative perspective, it is impor-
tant to consider values pluralistically and attempt to combine or trade off different
values. Applying such a perspective might result in the abandonment of consistent,
rational decision-making based on utility maximization. The pluralistic perspec-
tive, nonetheless, is considered necessary for good decision-making. Use of formal
rationality in any manner would not help solve a problem of this type. Moreover,
the actual social research or descriptive surveys of actual conditions such as
psychological experiments alone would not help ﬁnd the answer. In decision theory,
or even in health psychology or social psychology, extremely normative questions
such as “what is a good way of living a life?” or “what is a good society?” could not
be avoided once the path to seek good decision-making is chosen. Psychology is a

descriptive study and idealistic argument is strictly prohibited in psychology
education. This might reﬂect tragic experiences in human history caused by ideal-
istic stances that are not based on facts. Although such trends offer some positive
effects, the purpose of behavioral decision research would be unclear if it only
aimed at description. Normative examination is important also for descriptive
research. Descriptive research is necessary for normative research. Similarly, pre-
scriptions for actual decision-making cannot be developed solely from normative
examination. As hinted by Aristotle, whether using a normative approach, descrip-
tive approach, or prescriptive approach, decision research should ultimately pursue
the answer to the question of what a good decision is. Aiming only at description,
however, would obscure the goal of decision research. Decision research, therefore,
must begin with consideration of what a good decision is.
