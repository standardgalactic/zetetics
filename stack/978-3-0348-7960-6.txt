INTRODUCTORY PREFACE 
How I have (re-)written this book 
The book the reader has in hand was supposed to be a new edition of [14]. I have 
hesitated quite a long time before deciding to do the re-writing work-the first 
edition has been sold out for a few years. 
There was absolutely no question of just correcting numerous misprints and 
a few mathematical errors. When I wrote the first edition, in 1989, the convexity 
and Duistermaat-Heckman theorems together with the irruption of toric varieties 
on the scene of symplectic geometry, due to Delzant, around which the book was 
organized, were still rather recent (less than ten years). I myself was rather happy 
with a small contribution I had made to the subject. I was giving a post-graduate 
course on all that and, well, these were lecture notes, just lecture notes. 
By chance, the book turned out to be rather popular: during the years since 
then, I had the opportunity to meet quite a few people(1) who kindly pretended 
to have learnt the subject in this book. 
However, the older book does not satisfy at all the idea I have now of what 
a good book should be. So that this "new edition" is, indeed, another book. 
First of all, it is written more carefully. In particular, I have tried to follow the 
recommendations of [16]. The first edition, of course, contains only those results 
known(2) up through 1989. During the intervening fifteen years, I have enlarged 
both my knowledge of new results and my point of view, arising from work on more 
general integrable systems. I now find the relations among them to have gained in 
importance, and this has enlarged the book as well. It is not only a thicker book 
but also 
(l)often former MIT students, so that I guess the advertisement was made by Guillemin 
(2) To quote [54J, "after a decade of dramatic progress, many chapters of the theory [hadJ reached 
the final stage" .

INTRODUCTION 
- it contains more mathematics: I have split the previous chapter on the bases 
of symplectic geometry, adding more considerations on integrable systems, 
and I have (coherently) added a chapter on integrable systems and torus ac-
tions on certain moduli spaces (following Goldman and Jeffrey-Weitsman) 
because this is a beautiful example of use of the results of this book, but also 
because moduli spaces are the spaces of the future and cannot be ignored 
in a new book; 
- besides, it contains more theorems, even on the previously treated sub-
jects, for instance Atiyah's Kahler refinement of the convexity theorem and 
Delzant's uniqueness result; 
- it contains much more relevant examples and many new exercises; 
- it contains more proofs. Contrary to what happened in the old treatment, 
there is no proof "left as an exercise to the readers"; 
- it contains fewer misprints(3) (thanks to automatic spell-checking with Ex-
calibur); 
- it contains more figures and, this time, the figures are beautiful (but there 
will be no advertisement for expensive software in this book); 
- the bibliography has been completed and up-dated; 
- there is an index. 
. .. Well, to make, eventually, a long story short, I have worked a lot on 
this new book, I have enjoyed it most of the time and I hope that this will be a 
genuinely good reference book. In any case, this is the last time I will write it.

INTRODUCTION

I also owe a special debt of gratitude to Leonor Godinho, Dusa McDuff and 
Sebastien Racaniere for helping me to improve the penultimate version of this 
book, and especially to Edwin Beschler, copy-editor at Birkhiiuser, who read it 
very carefully and made a lot of useful suggestions and to Claude Sabbah who 
helped me to hunt out widows and orphans. 
What I have written in this book 
At least since the Felix Klein Erlangen program, everybody knows that it is useful 
to make groups act on sets, the action providing information both on the group 
acting and on the set acted on. 
In this book, we shall be interested in "differentiable" (i. e., locally linear) 
objects: the set will be a smooth manifold and the group a Lie group, acting by 
diffeomorphisms. 
The group action allows one to decompose the manifold into pieces (strata) 
corresponding to the various orbit types. When the manifold is not too compli-
cated, it is possible to recover "everything" from this stratification: this is the case 
for example when the group is the circle 8 1 and the manifold a surface. .. but 
there are rather few examples of such a simple situation. 
The two principal motivations to investigate group actions on symplectic 
manifolds might be: 
(1) This is a natural (?) framework for the Hamiltonian mechanics: since La-
grange, we are able to consider the phase space of any mechanical system 
as a symplectic manifold, the group then represents the more or less hidden 
symmetries of the system(4). 
(2) From the point of view of the group itself, what is called the "orbit method" 
(Kostant, Kirillov, etc.) and which is a tool to construct representations of 
the group, uses symplectic geometry in an essential way. The fundamental 
objects in the theory are the coadjoint orbits, which are naturally symplectic 
manifolds. 
There is another good reason to investigate symplectic actions: this is easier! 
The so-called Hamiltonian actions are actually, by the very definition, those for 
which there is a function on the manifold, the critical points of which correspond to 
the fixed points of the group action. It is thus possible to use the well-understood 
methods (invented by Morse, Thom, and many others) of Morse theory to study 
the group action. 
(4) A good reference for this point of view is the book [123].

INTRODUCTION 
For example, the central theorem in the first part of this book is the following 
statement (that any neophyte is allowed to find abstruse) due to Frankel [51] and 
Atiyah [7]: 
Theorem (Corollary IV.3.2). Let X be an almost periodic vector field on a connected 
symplectic manifold (W, w). Suppose H is a function W -+ R such that i XW = dH. 
Then all the levels H-l(t) are (empty or) connected. 
For those who felt the statement was indeed abstruse, here are a few appli-
cations which should be clearer. 
A theorem of Kushnirenko. In the first application, we enumerate the solutions 
of a particular system of algebraic equations. Consider a finite subset S c zn of 
multi-exponents, and the system of n equations and n unknowns: 
L ~za = 0 for 1 ~ j ~ n, 
aES 
the parameters C!. being complex and the unknown z an element of the complex 
torus (c*)n. 
For example, 
- If n = 1 and inf S = k ? 0, the system consists of an equation 
m-k 
zk L cczc 
c=o 
and thus has, in general, m - k (the length of the shortest interval contain-
ing S) nonzero solutions. 
- If S = {el ' . . . , en} is the set of the vectors in the canonical basis of zn, then 
our system is a homogeneous linear system and has in general no solution 
(in (c*)n). 
- If we add 0 (then S = {el , " " en, O}), the system is a linear system and 
has in general exactly one solution.

INTRODUCTION

The following theorem, due to Kushnirenko [90], generalizes the observations 
made in these examples: 
Theorem (Theorem IY.4.25). The number of solutions of the system 
L c1,zn = 0 for 1 ~ j ~ n 
nES 
for general enough coefficients c~ is 
N(S) = n! Vol(S) 
where S is the convex hull of S in Rn. 
The Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem. This is a classical problem, the Toeplitz-
Hausdorff problem, to determine the numerical image of an operator A on a Hilbert 
space H. This is simply the set W(A) of all the values taken by the inner product 
(Av, v), when v varies in the unit sphere of H. Here, we will only consider matrices, 
that is, we will restrict ourselves to the finite dimensional case, H = en, endowed 
with the standard Hermitian form. In this case, A is an n x n complex matrix.

INTRODUCTION 
The numerical image can have rather different shapes, according to the spe-
cific chosen A. The examples given here are inspired by those in [65]; they corre-
spond to the matrices

for which it is (more or less easily) checked that the numerical image is that shown 
in Figure 2. Notice that all these subsets are convex, this being a more general 
fact. 
Theorem (Theorem IV.4.I). The numerical image W(A) is a convex subset of C. 
It turns out that this theorem is also a consequence of Corollary IV.3.2, as 
I have learned it in V. A. Ginzburg's paper [53]. 
The Schur-Horn theorem. This is a classical result (and the most classical 
application of the convexity theorem above), originally due to Schur and Horn, 
which describes the possible values of the diagonal entries in a Hermitian matrix 
of given spectrum. 
Theorem (CorollaryIV.4.11). The mapping which, to any Hermitian matrix, asso-
ciates its diagonal entries, maps 'H(>\l, ... ,An ) onto the convex hull in Rn of the set 
('\'-(1),"" .\,-(n)) (for (J in the symmetric group 6 n). 
Figure 3 shows this image, in the hyperplane LVi = L Ai in Rn for n = 3 
(hexagon) and n = 4 (permutahedron) in the case where the Ai'S are distinct.

INTRODUCTION 
7 
Although I did my best to present rather different applications of Corollary 
IV.3.2, I cannot hide that they have two important common points: 
- in their assumptions: the manifolds (c*)n and H)., are both endowed with 
an action of the torus Tn. 
- in their conclusions: both contain the word "convex": actually, Corollary 
IV.3.2 is the essential step in the proof of the so-called A tiyah , Guillemin 
and Sternberg convexity theorem. 
Our abstruse statement, in addition to giving unified proofs of previously 
different theorems, allows us to classify certain group actions on symplectic man-
ifolds. 
Contents of this book. As its title says, this book is mainly devoted to the study 
of torus actions in symplectic geometry. Hence, I start with some generalities on 
Lie group actions on manifolds. This is Chapter I, in which I spend some time on 
Sl-actions on surfaces and on 3-manifolds, especially on Seifert manifolds. Then 
I introduce symplectic geometry (in Chapter II) and Hamiltonian group actions 
(in Chapter III), especially torus actions and action-angle variables. 
Chapter IV is the core of the book. Devoted to some applications of Morse 
theory to Hamiltonian group actions, it contains all the convexity theorems men-
tioned in this introduction. I have tried to give a lot of examples, in the main text 
as well as in the exercises. The next chapter, Chapter V, describes a family of ex-
amples of symplectic manifolds (moduli spaces of flat connections) endowed with 
integrable systems (Goldman's functions), the action-angle variables (investigated 
by Jeffrey and Weitsman) of which give further examples of convex polyhedra ap-
pearing in symplectic geometry. Another reason to have included these examples 
here is the fact that this is an opportunity to introduce the basic definitions on 
connections, that I use to do the algebraic topology needed in Chapter VI. This one 
is devoted to the other beautiful achievement of the theory in the 1980s, namely, 
the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem. It happens that the language of equivariant 
cohomology fits very well with the study of Hamiltonian actions, since the exis-
tence of a momentum mapping for the G-action on the manifold W is equivalent 
to the existence of an extension of the symplectic form to the Borel construction 
WG on W. This remark allowed Berline and Vergne [22] to give a lucid proof 
of the spectacular theorem of Duistermaat and Heckman [44]. I present here this 
perfect example of a theorem which becomes practically tautological once the right 
language to state it in is found. 
In Chapter VII, I present a topological construction of the complex toric 
varieties. This comes from the work by Delzant [39]' the seminal paper [38] by 
Danilov and the book [85] by Kirwan. In the last chapter (Chapter VIII), I dis-
cuss the Hamiltonian circle actions on 4-manifolds, around results due to Dusa 

8 
INTRODUCTION 
McDuff [103], myself [13] (and independently Ahara and Hattori [1]) and Yael 
Karshon [83]. The main reason to present these results hie et nunc is that the 
proofs given here are an illustration of all the methods introduced in the book, 
since I use Seifert manifolds, Morse theory, the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem 
and toric manifolds. 
Prerequisites and bibliography. The readers are assumed to know the basic 
definitions on manifolds (see [124, 91]' as a good general reference for all these 
notes, [84, § 5] and, for the calculus used in this book, [43]). I also use, of course, 
the classification of surfaces [101, 59] and, to stay in the spirit of the book, [58]' 
which might also be used as an introduction to Morse theoretical methods. As to 
algebraic topology: the reader is supposed to learn a few elementary notions as 
she or he goes along, being assumed to know nothing at the beginning and a little 
more at the end. There will always be a reference or a hint of proof for what I shall 
use, but not always a complete proof. 
I have tried to make an extensive and rather complete bibliography. There 
are quite a few good books on symplectic geometry on the market. I like very much 
the concise and efficient survey [6] of Givental and Arnold. I also recommend, of 
course, among many others, [96] and [106]. 

CHAPTER I 
SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
In this chapter, we list the basic definitions and properties of Lie group actions. 
Then we investigate the actions of the circle Sl on surfaces and 3-manifolds. 
1.1. Generalities 
To make this book reasonably self-contained, we start with a few generalities. The 
material here is quite classical and can be found in numerous good books. This is 
why some proofs are only sketched. The books I have used are [27, 32, 71, 91]. 
I.1.a. Lie group actions. Let G denote a Lie group(1) the unit element of which 
is 1 and the Lie algebra of which is g. 
G-manifolds. Let W be a smooth (i.e., eOO ) manifold on which G acts by diffeo-
morphisms. The action is written 
This is a left action, that is, 
G x W ------+ W 
(g,x) I-------+g·x. 
g. (h· x) = (gh) . x for all g, hE G, x E W. 
A manifold endowed with a G-action is called is a G-manifold. 
Equivariant mappings. If the group G acts on the two manifolds V and W, and 
if t.p : V ----t W is a smooth map, it is said that t.p is an equivariant map if 
'ixEV, 'igEG, 
t.p(g·x)=g·t.p(x). 
(l)The readers will find a summary of useful results on Lie groups, Lie algebras, the exponential 
mapping and all that in § 104. 

10 
CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Clearly, if the equivariant mapping <p is a diffeomorphism, the inverse diffeomor-
phism <p-l is also an equivariant mapping. 
G-vector bundles. We shall call a G-vector bundle over a G-manifold W any vector 
bundle E ~ W endowed with a G-action which is linear in the fibers and such 
that the projection is an equivariant map. 
For instance, the tangent bundle TW of a G-manifold has a natural structure 
of G-vector bundle, given by 
g. (x, v) = (g. x,T xg(v)). 
Orbits and stabilizers. If x is a point in W, its orbit will be denoted G . x, 
G . x = {y E W I y = g . x for some g E G} , 
and its stabilizer Gx , 
Gx = {g E Gig· x = x} . 
Stabilizers of points are obviously closed subgroups, and hence Lie subgroups 
(see Theorem I.4.6) of G. Notice that stabilizers of points in the same orbit are 
conjugate to each other, as Gg.x = g-lGxg (this equality also shows that all 
possible conjugates appear). With each orbit is associated a conjugation class of 
subgroups of G, called the type of the orbit. The conjugation class of H is denoted 
by·(H). Thus the type of G· x is (Gx ). 
Notice also that, if <p : V ~ W is an equivariant mapping, we have 
G x C Gcp(x)' 
Ll.b. Orbit mappings and fundamental vector fields. For each point x E 
W, the mapping 
Ix: G ---+ W 
g I------t g . x 
is a smooth map, called the orbit mapping. Its image is the orbit of x. Its differential 
at 1 is the linear map: 
With each vector X Egis thus associated a vector 
tangent to W at x. Allowing x to vary in W, we get a vector field, the fundamental 
vector field associated with X, denoted by wx, X, or even X when there is no 
risk of confusion. By definition, the flow of X is exp(tX) . x. Notice that the Lie 
bracket is related to the bracket of vector fields by the simple formula 
[X,Yj = [X,Yj. 

1.1. GENERALITIES 
11 
The stabilizer of x is a Lie subgroup of G, the homogeneous space G/Gx is 
thus a smooth manifold (see Theorem 1.4.8) and one shows 
Theorem 1.1.1. The orbit map 
fx : G/Gx --+ W 
is an injective immersion. 
Proof We simply evaluate the kernel of the differential of the orbit map 
By invariance, it is sufficient to study the case where 9 = 1. We are thus looking 
at the kernel of T Ii 
x, that is {X E 9 I X x = o}. It is easily checked that this set 
is the Lie algebra gx of Gx. 
0 
Thus, orbits are images of manifolds by injective immersions. It does not 
follow that they are submanifolds. The most classical (counter-)example is that of 
R 2 acting on a torus by irrational translations (Exercise 1.1). Recall however that 
a proper injective immersion is an embedding, in particular this problem does not 
occur when the group is compact. 
Corollary 1.1.2. If G is a compact Lie group, its orbits are submanifolds of w. 
0 
Notice that, by the very definition, the fundamental vector fields generate 
the tangent space to the orbit. 
I.1.c. Examples. 
Example 1.1.3. The linear group GL(n,R) acts on Rn, as does GL(n; C) on cn. 
We will use mainly compact subgroups of GL(n; R) or GL(n; C), as the 
orthogonal group O(n) or the unitary group U(n) and especially Abelian compact 
subgroups (namely, tori), but we will also need the complex torus (c*)n. 
Example 1.1.4. The circle Sl acts on C n by complex multiplication 
t· (Zl,"" zn) = (tz 1 , ... , tzn). 
The point 0 is fixed; all the other orbits are circles. The spheres 
are stable under this action. This apparently trivial example will turn out to be 
the fundamental example for this book! 

12 
CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
ExampleLI.5. The circle Sl also acts on S3 C C 2 (for instance) in a more sophis-
ticated way 
t· (Zl,Z2) = (tmlz1,tm2z2) 
(here m1 and m2 are any elements of Z). 
Example LI. 6. The unitary group U (n) acts on the real vector space of Hermitian 
n x n-matrices by conjugation 
It follows from the diagonalizability of Hermitian matrices that the orbits are the 
manifolds 'It).. mentioned in the introduction of this book (this is Exercise 1.4). 
Ll.d. More definitions. The G-action is said to be effective if each element 
9 i= 1 moves at least one x in W, that is to say, if: 
n Gx = {I}. 
xEW 
Any action may be replaced by an effective one: 
Proposition LI. 7. The group n Gx is a closed normal subgroup in G, and the G-
action in W induces an effective action of G / n Gx in W. 
Proof This an intersection of closed subgroups, hence a closed subgroup. Let now 
9 E n Gx and h be any element of G. For x E W, we have 
since 9 fixes all elements, hence h- 1gh E n Gx • 
o 
E,xample Ll.B • . Let Sl act on C by t· w = t2w. This is not an effective action, 
since the subgroup {±l} fixes all the points. However, the quotient Sl/ {±l} acts 
effectively. 
. 
Example LI.9. The Sl-action on S3 by 
t· (Zl,Z2) = (tmlz1,tm2z2) 
is effective if and only if m1 and m2 are relatively prime (an exercise for the 
readers). 
Example LI.IO. If the group G is simple, the action is either effective--if the 
normal subgroup n Gx is the trivial subgroup {I }--or trivial-if this is the whole 
group G. This is the case for instance for G = SO(3). 

1.2. EQUIVARIANT TUBULAR NEIGHBORHOODS 
13 
The action is transitive if it has only one orbit, free if all the orbits have the 
trivial subgroup {I} as stabilizer, semi-free if they have G or {I} as stabilizer (in 
other words if it is free outside fixed points). 
The last notion in this paragraph is that of orbit space. This is the quotient 
space WIG endowed with the quotient topology. Even for a smooth Lie group 
action on a smooth manifold, the quotient can be very bad. In general, it is not 
even Hausdorff (think of the example of the irrational flow on the torus T2, there 
is another example in Exercise 1.2). Anyway: 
Proposition LI.11. If G is compact, WIG is a Hausdorff space and the projection 
7r: W ---t WIG is a proper and closed mapping. 
Proof Recall that the quotient map 7r for the quotient by a group action is an 
open mapping, since, for any open set U C W, we have 
7r-l(7r(U)) = U g. U, 
gEG 
an open set as a union of open sets. It turns out that, when G is compact, the 
projection 7r is also closed, 
7r- 1(7r(A)) = 8(G x A) 
being closed for any closed subset A. The map 8 here is simply the action map 
8 : G x W ------7 W, 
the point here being that 8 is a closed map when G is compact. To see this, 
let C c G x W be any closed subset and let y be a point of the closure 8(C). 
There are sequences (gn), (xn) such that y = limgn . xn. As G is compact, we 
may assume that (gn) converges to some element g. Then (xn) = (g;;l . (gn . xn)) 
tends to g-l(y), thus (gn,xn) ---t (g,g-l(y)) E C, since C is a closed subset. Hence 
y = g. g-l(y) E 8(C), so that 8(C) is closed. 
We know that 7r is closed, its fibers are compact, hence 7r is a proper map. We 
still need to prove that WIG is Hausdorff. Let G· x and G· y be two distinct orbits. 
They are compact (as images of G). As W is Hausdorff, they can be separated by 
open subsets. There is an open neighborhood U of x such that Un G· y = 0. Now 
7r(U) and the complement of 7r(U) are both open subsets, they do not intersect, 
the former contains 7r(x) and the latter 7r(Y).

1.2. Equivariant tubular neighborhoods and orbit types decomposition 
I.2.a. The slice theorem (equivariant tubular neighborhood). Although 
this is not the most general possible assumption, we will restrict ourselves to the

CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
case where the group G is compact. In this case, according to Corollary 1.1.2, its or-
bits are submanifolds of W. We now describe the manifold W in the neighborhood 
of an orbit. 
Let x E W. Let Vx denote the quotient vector space T x W /T x (G . x). For 
9 E Gx , the tangent map: 
Txg: TxW ------t Tg.xW = TxW 
is an isomorphism, sending the tangent space of the orbit into itself (by the identity 
map), and in particular it induces a linear isomorphism from Vx to itself. Thus, 
with each point x in W, is associated a linear representation of its stabilizer, i.e., 
a group homomorphism: 
Gx ------t GL(Vx). 
Hence, the stabilizer Gx acts on G x Vx , by left multiplication on G and by the 
linear representation just described on Vx ' 
More generally, if H is a closed subgroup of G, and if V is a vector space 
endowed with an H-linear action, there is a free action of H on G x V, namely 
h· (g,v) = (gh-1,h·v). 
The quotient is denoted GXH V, and [g, vl represents the equivalence class of (g, v); 
this is a vector bundle on G/H with fiber V: 
GxV---+GXHV

G

and it is endowed with a G-action by 
g'. [g,vl = [g'g,vl· 
We may consider G/H as a submanifold in G XH V, the zero section of the vector 
bundle, namely 
{[g,Oll 9 E G} c G XH V. 
The next theorem (the slice theorem) says that there exists an extension f x of the 
orbit map:

Theorem L2.1 (The "slice theorem" [89]). There exists an equivariant diffeomor-
phism from an equivariant open neighborhood of the zero section in G x Gx Vx to 
an open neighborhood of G . x in W, which sends the zero section G/Gx onto the 
orbit G . x by the natural map f x' 
C·x 
Figure 1 
Sketch of a proof of theorem 1.2.1. In the nonequivariant case, to prove the exis-
tence of a tubular neighborhood for a compact submanifold YeW, one uses the 
exponential map of a Riemannian metric(2) on W which induces a diffeomorphism 
from a suitable neighborhood of the zero section in the normal bundle of Y onto 
a neighborhood of Y in W (see [124]). 
To adapt this proof in the equivariant case, it suffices to choose the Rieman-
nian metric in such a way that it is G-invariant (i.e., such that G acts on W by 
isometries), thus making it possible to identify Vx with the orthogonal complement 
of T x(G . x). 
To be convinced of the existence of an invariant metric: 
(1) The group G can be endowed with a Haar measure (this is to say, a measure 
invariant by left translations). As G is a Lie group, the proof of this fact is 
very easy: choose an n-linear skew-symmetric form (where n is the dimen-
sion of G) 0 E An (g) * on 9 = T 1 G, define an invariant differential form on 
G by Og = g. O. This defines a measure. As G is compact, it is possible to 
normalize the measure in such a way that fG Og = 1, multiplying 0 by an 
ad hoc scalar. 
(2) Given a G-vector bundle E -+ W, we have a G-action on the sections of E 
by: 
(g. s)(x) = gS(g-lx). 
Given a section s, associate to it an equivariant section s by: 
s(x) = fc gS(g-lX)Wg . 
(2)The reader is invited to have a look at her or his favorite differential geometry textbook to 
find a proof of the existence of such a metric; it goes without saying that here all the manifolds 
are implicitly assumed to be paracompact (and Hausdorff)!

CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
If E is the bundle of symmetric bilinear forms on the tangent bundle TW 
and if s is a Riemannian metric, it is easily checked that the invariant section 
s is still a Riemannian metric.

I.2.h. Applications. 
Proposition L2.2. The union of all the orbits of a given type is a submanifold of w. 
Proof Fix a type, that is, a conjugacy class (H) of subgroups of G and let W(H) 
be the union of all the orbits of type (H): 
W(H) = {x E W I Gx E (H)} . 
Let x E W(H)' Let us prove that W(H) is a submanifold (this is a local property) 
in the neighborhood of the orbit of x. For this, we look at the orbits of type (H) 
in G XH V. If g' E G[g,v], we have: g'. [g, v] = [g' g, v] if and only if, for some h E H, 
g' 9 = 9 h -1 and v = h . v. 
Thus G[g,v] = gHvg- 1 is in the conjugation class of Hv and all conjugates do 
appear when 9 varies (and v is fixed). 
The orbit of [g, v] is of type (H), if and only if Hv = H, that is if and only if 
v is a fixed point of the H-action in V. Let 
F = {v E V I h· v = v, V hE H} 
be the set of these fixed points. This is a vector subspace of V and 
(G XH V) n W(H) = {[g, v] E G XH V I G[g,v] E (H)} = G XH F 
is a subbundle of G x H V and in particular a submanifold. 
The simplest example is that of the orbits of type (G): 
Corollary L2.3. 
The set of fixed points of G is a submanifold of w. 
o 
o 
Of course these submanifolds are not connected in general, and their compo-
nents do not all have the same dimension. Anyway, the orbit types give a decom-
position of W into submanifolds. This decomposition is locally finite: 
Proposition L2.4. If W is compact, there are only finitely many orbit types. 
Proof Let n = dim W. If n = 0, the proposition is obviously true: W itself is 
a finite number of points. Suppose that the proposition is proved for all the G-
manifolds of dimension ~ n - 1. Thanks to the compactness of W, it is sufficient 
to show that each tube N = G x H V contains only a finite number of orbit types. 
Choose an H-invariant metric on the H-vector space V, call SV the unit 
sphere for that metric and write SN = G XH SV (this is the sphere bundle of N). 

I.2. EQUIVARIANT TUBULAR NEIGHBORHOODS 
17 
This is a G-manifold of dimension n - 1, so that we can apply the induction 
hypothesis: in SN, there is only a finite number of orbit types. 
We compare now the types in SN and in N. As the H-action on V is linear, 
for any nonzero A, the orbit type of [g, AV] EN is the same as that of [g, v] E SN. 
Thus the types in N are: those in SN on the one hand, and that of the central 
orbit in G IH on the other hand. 
0 
It is not only true that there are few orbit types. It happens, moreover, that 
one of the types takes up a lot of room: 
Proposition L2.5. If WIG is connected, there is an orbit type (H) in W for which 
W(H) is a dense open subset of W. Moreover, W(H)/G is a connected manifold. 
Such orbits are called principal orbits. If all the orbits are principal, the action 
is said to be principal. 
Proof Assume that G is connected. We prove the result by induction on n = 
dim W. If n = 0 and WIG is connected, there is only one orbit and the proposition 
is obvious. As previously, assume the result proved for G-manifolds of dimension 
~ n - 1 and consider N = G x H V. 
In order to apply the induction hypothesis to SN we would have to know 
that SNIG is connected. Nearly always, SN itself is connected (and thus a fortiori 
its quotient SNIG is): call n the projection of the vector bundle N ---+ G/H; to 
connect two points a and b of SN by a path, choose a path from n(a) to neb) 
in the connected orbit G/H and lift it to a path beginning at a in the boundary 
SN of the tube. The end b' of the lift is in the same fiber as b and to be able to 
connect it to b' (thus to a), it is sufficient that this fiber, which is a sphere in V, 
is connected. 
The only possible problem occurs in the case where the unit sphere in V has 
dimension O. In this case, dim V = 1 and SN ---+ G/H is a twofold covering. If this 
covering is not trivial, it is connected and we are done; if it is trivial, it means 
that H acts trivially on the "slice" V = R . .. in which case all the orbits contained 
in N are the same and we do not need the induction hypothesis to conclude that 
the proposition is true in N. In the other cases, the induction hypothesis applies 
to SN and there exists an orbit type (H) such that (SN)(H) is open and dense in 
SN. As in the proof of I.2.4, it is easily seen that the same happens in N. 
Thus the proposition is proved in each equivariant tube. Choose a locally 
finite covering of W by such tubes and conclude, with the help of the connectedness 
of the orbit space, that the type (H) is the same in all the tubes. 
0 
Example L2.6. If G is commutative, let (H) = {H} be the type of the principal 
orbits. The subgroup H fixes all the points of an open dense subset of W, and 

18 
CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
thus fixes all the points of W. If the action is effective, the principal orbits have 
type (1). 
Remarks L2. 7. An orbit is principal if and only if the representation in V of its 
stabilizer is trivial. In this case, the quotient is a manifold. Notice that principal 
orbits have maximal dimension among all orbits. 
An orbit is called exceptional if it is not principal but has the same dimension 
as the principal orbits, singular if its dimension is strictly less. 
1.3. Examples: S1-actions on manifolds of dimension 2 and 3 
In this section, we give examples of classification theorems. The most interesting 
one is that of fixed point free S1-actions on orientable 3-manifolds (Seifert man-
ifolds), which will be used in the sequel to understand periodic Hamiltonians on 
4-manifolds. Both as an introduction and a preliminary exercise, we consider first 
S1-actions on surfaces. 
1.3.a. S1-actions on surfaces. We begin with a list of examples. 
The torus. The circle S1 acts on the torus T2 = S1 X S1 by multiplication on one 
summand. This is the unique principal S1-action on a surface. The readers are 
invited to prove this, solving Exercise 1.8) in the statement of which they will find 
some hints. 
The sphere. The group S1 also acts on the unit sphere S2 of R3 as the group 
of rotations around a fixed axis. All the orbits are principal, except for the two 
fixed points where the axis meets the sphere. The orbit space is a closed interval 
(Figure 2). 
The projective plane. The same circle also acts on the projective plane p2(R). 
Here are three possible (but nevertheless equivalent) descriptions(3) of this action: 
- If p2(R) is the quotient of the sphere S2 by the antipodal map (x f--t -x), 
the action previously defined on the sphere descends to the quotient. 
- If p2(R) is the "projective completion" of R2 (to which a line at infinity 
is added), then the linear S1 = SO(2)-action on R2 may be extended to 
P2(R). 
- If p2(R) is the set of lines in R3 and is described by homogeneous coordi-
nates [x, y, z], then S1 = 80(2) acts by A . [x, y, z] = [A. (x, y), z]. 
(3) The reader wanting to know more about the projective plane might enjoy having a look at 
the nice book [4]. 

1.3. EXAMPLES: SI-ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 2 AND 3 
19 
In each of the three descriptions given it is clear that all orbits are principal 
except for two of them. One is a fixed point and the other has a Z/2 as stabilizer 
(it corresponds to the equatorial circle of S2 for example). The orbit space is a 
closed interval, each of its ends corresponding to a non-principal orbit (Figure 3).

Figure 2 
Figure 3 
The Klein bottle. The circle also acts on the Klein bottle K . Recall (see Figure 4) 
that K is the quotient of R2 by the group of affine transformations generated by 
t: (x, y) !------) (x + 1, y) and s : (x , y) !------) (-x , y + 1). 
We make R act on R2 by (x, y) t---> (x, y + a). This induces an action of R/Z = Sl 
Figure 4 
on K. The quotient map is identified with 
K -------+ R/(x rv x + 1,x rv -x) 
[x, y] !------) [x] 
and this identifies the orbit space with the interval [0,1/2]. All the orbits are 
principal, except those corresponding to 0 and 1/2 which have a Z/2 as stabilizer. 
We prove now that this list exhausts all possible examples of closed surfaces 
endowed with effective Sl-actions. Assume W is a closed (i. e., compact and without 
boundary) connected surface. 
The closed subgroups (and thus the possible orbit types) of Sl are: Sl itself 
and the finite cyclic groups {I}, Z/m. 

20 
CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
The principal orbits. As Sl is a commutative group and the action has been as-
sumed to be effective, the principal orbits must have type {I}. In the neighborhood 
of a principal orbit, according to the slice theorem (Theorem I.2.1), the action is 
the product over Sl x R of the multiplication and the trivial action. A neighbor-
hood of such an orbit in the quotient space is thus homeomorphic to R. 
The exceptional orbits. The orbits of type Zjm (m ;? 2) are exceptional. That 
group must have an effective action on the normal space to the orbit, the dimension 
of which is 1. This can happen only if m = 2, the action being x f---7 -x. In the 
neighborhood of such an orbit, a tube looks like: 
Sl XZ/2 R = (Sl x R)j(z, u) '" (-z, -u). 
This is a Mobius strip, thus the existence of an exceptional orbit forces W to be 
non-orientable. In the neighborhood of the orbit, the quotient map is [z, t] f---7 It I 
and the quotient space is a half line. 
The singular orbits. They have type Sl: they are fixed points. Near such a point, 
the action linearizes as the standard S 1 = SO (2 )-action on R 2 . 
We have thus proved that the orbit space is a manifold of dimension 1 with 
boundary, it is of course compact and connected as W is. It suffices now to inves-
tigate all the possible cases. 
(1) If WjS1 is a circle, the action is principal, and we have said that W is a 
torus, with the usual action. 
(2) If not, WjS1 is a closed interval. The inverse image of the interior of this 
interval is Sl x R and each of the ends is the image, either of a fixed point, 
or of an exceptional orbit, with Zj2 as stabilizer (see Figure 5).

- If there are two fixed points, W is obtained by adding two points to 
Sl x R, and is thus a sphere. 
- If there is only one fixed point, and one exceptional orbit, we must 
glue a disc to a Mobius strip along the boundary (which is a principal 
orbit). We thus get a projective plane. 

1.3. EXAMPLES: S'-ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 2 AND 3 
21 
- If both ends correspond to exceptional orbits, we must glue two 
Mobius strips along their common boundary, thus getting a Klein 
bottle. 
I.3.b. Principal SI-actions on 3-manifolds. The study of 3-manifolds with 
fixed point free SI-action was initiated by Seifert during the 1930s [122]. The 
classification of these SI-actions is due to Raymond [118]' who actually classi-
fied topological actions. Of course we shall restrict ourselves to the differentiable 
classification ... However, both classifications turn out to be the same one. 
We start with principal actions. The quotient space is then a closed surface 
B and the projection 7r : W ----+ B is a "principal SI-bundle" over B (this is indeed 
a locally trivial bundle, according to the slice theorem). 
In addition to the diffeomorphism type of B, we shall exhibit another invari-
ant, a number called the Euler class. This is an integer when B is orient able (and 
an integer modulo 2 otherwise). 
Figure 6 
Assume the surface is orientable. Here is a description of the Euler class e. 
Choose a point in B and a disc Do around this point. The complement of the 
point has a wedge of 2g circles as deformation retract (see [101] and Figure 6). 
Note that 9 can be zero, the complement of Do is then a disc. 
Recall (see, for instance, Exercise 1.11) that a principal SI-bundle over a 
graph (or a topological space having the same homotopy type as a graph) is trivial. 
This allows us to choose a section (Y : B - Do ----+ W - Va. When restricted to Do 
the bundle is trivializable as well, thus Va = 7r- l (Do) is a solid torus 
Va = Do x SI 
and W = (W - Do) Ua Va. On the boundary avo we see two natural curves: 
(1) The meridian a. By definition, this is a closed simple curve which bounds a 
disc in Va. Its homotopy class is (up to sign) well defined by this property: 
a is a generator of the kernel of 
7rl (aVo) ~ Z2 -----+ 7rl (Va) ~ Z 

22 
CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
au 
Figure 7 
so that we can choose for a the boundary of a section of 1TI Do. 
(2) Any orbit b of the Sl-action. This is also a simple closed curve; with a 
chosen as above, the two curves meet at exactly one point. 
As the surface B was supposed to be orient able and the action principal, it is 
easily checked that the manifold W is orient able as well. We choose an orientation 
of W, the induced orientation on Vo, the boundary orientation(4) on avo. We also 
orient b by the orientation of Sl and choose the orientation of a in such a way that 
a·b=+l. 
If au is oriented oppositely to the boundary orientation, it meets b at one 
point and positively and we may write 
8u rv a - eb 
for some e E Z. This integer is the Euler class of the principal Sl-action on W (or 
of the principal Sl-bundle W -t B). 
Proposition L3.1. 
The integer e is independent of all the choices made. Together 
with the diffeomorphism type of B, it determines the equivariant diffeomorphism 
type of W. For any orientable surface B and any integer e, there exists a manifold 
W endowed with a principal Sl-action, the orbit space of which is B and the Euler 
class e. 
Proof. One constructs, given Band e, a manifold W with an Sl-action the invari-
ants of which are Band W: 
We firstly choose a disc Do in B, then write Wo = (B - Do) x Sl, endow it 
with the product action, thus u(x) = (x, 1) is a section. We consider also a solid 
torus D2 x Sl with the product action, and define an equivariant diffeomorphism 
'P : awo ----+ 8(D2 x Sl) 
(4)The convention we use to orient boundaries is the one in which the outward normal followed 
by the orientation of the boundary gives the orientation of the whole manifold. 

1.3. EXAMPLES: S1-ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 2 AND 3

reversing orientations. Make the choice of cp precise by prescribing which curve in 
awo is sent to a meridian (i. e., is homotopic to a constant in the solid torus). Take 
aao + eb, where b denotes the homotopy class of any orbit. 
The manifold obtained this way has the right invariants. Conversely, if W is 
endowed with a principal Sl-action with these invariants, it is easy to write down 
a diffeomorphism of W with the above model. 
0 
Remark L3.2. The Euler class e vanishes if and only if the fibration W ---'> B has a 
section, in other words is trivializable. 
Example L3.3. The S I-action on S3 by t . (Zl' Z2) = (tzl' tZ2) is principal and the 
quotient is a sphere S2 which we may consider here as the complex projective line 
pI (C), the quotient mapping being the Hopf fibration: 
S3 -----+ pI (C) 
(Zl' Z2) !-------+ [Zl' Z2] 
which associates with each unit vector the complex line it generates. The projective 
line p I (C) is the union of the two discs 
Do = {[Zl,Z2] I IZII ~ IZ21} ~ {t E C Iitl ~ I} by t = Zl 
Z2 
and 
Z2 
Doo = {[zl,z2]llzll;? IZ21} ~ {u E C Ilul ~ I} by u =-, 
Zl 
neighborhoods respectively of 0 = [0,1] and of 00 = [1,0]. Hence the sphere de-
composes into two solid tori on which the fibration is trivializable (see Figure 8). 
Figure 8 
With the same notation as above, we can choose for a meridian a in avo the 
image of the section 
and for the curve b the orbit 
{~(w,w) I W E Sl} 
1 
of the point J2(l,l).

I.3.c. Oriented Seifert manifolds. We want now to generalize the previous 
study to the case of closed 3-manifolds endowed with an S1-action, still without 
fixed points but with possibly exceptional orbits. We shall restrict ourselves to the 
case of oriented manifolds. The proof we shall give of the classification theorem 
can be found in [115], another useful reference is [24]. 
Let W be an oriented manifold of dimension 3, endowed with an S1-action. 
There are principal orbits, of type {I}, and exceptional orbits, of type Z/m (for 
m ~ 2). As in the case of surfaces, we try to understand the local structure of the 
orbit space near an exceptional orbit with the help of the slice theorem 1.2.1. 
Orbits of type Z/m. The slice has dimension 2 and S1 acts on V = R2 as a 
subgroup of 0(2). If m ~ 3, Z/m sits in SO(2) as the subgroup of rotations 
of order m, but if m = 2, there are two different ways in which Z/2 can be 
seen as a subgroup of 0(2): it can be generated either by a reflection or by a 
rotation. Written with the help of a well-chosen complex coordinate in R2 and 
with ~ = e2i1f 1m , 
and possibly, if m = 2, 
~·v =v. 

1.3. EXAMPLES: Sl-ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 2 AND 3 
25 
In this case, the equivariant tube is 
Sl x C/(z, v) "-J (-z, v). 
Writing v = x + iy, we see that this is the product of a Mobius strip and a line R. 
This cannot happen since we have assumed that W was orientable. 
Hence, all the orbits have tubular neighborhoods of the form Sl X Z/m C 
where Z/m acts on C by rotations of order m. 
RemarkI.3.4. The exceptional orbits are isolated in W: in Sl XZ/m C all the orbits 
are principal, except for the central (v = 0) one. In particular, as W is compact, 
there are only finitely many exceptional orbits. 
Figure 10 
Near an orbit of type Z/m, the orbit map is identified with 
Sl xZ/m C ----+ C/(Z/m) 
[z,v] f-----+ [v] . 
In particular, the quotient space is a closed topological surface B, together with 
the additional structure inherited from the differentiable structure of W: this is 
the structure of a differentiable manifold except at a finite number of points, where 
B has a conical "singularity". One says that B is an orbifold(5) (see § III.2.f). The 
additional structure is included in the Sl-action on W . In this chapter we shall 
therefore concentrate on the topological surface B. 
We shall only need to consider the case where B is an orientable surface: 
when these objects will appear again, in Chapter VIII, they will be symplectic 
(and hence oriented). In the sequel of this section, W is thus an oriented manifold 
and the quotient surface B is assumed to be orient able as well. The projection

CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
The Seifert invariants of an exceptional orbit. Thanks to the slice theorem, a 
tubular neighborhood of an exceptional orbit looks like: 
V=Sl xz/ m D2 
where Z/m acts as a subgroup on Sl and acts in a linear fashion on the disc 
D2 C R2 = C. This action is by rotations of order m, thus the quotient is given 
by 
(z, v) '" (C f3 . z, ( . v) (= e2i1f / m 
for some integer 13, that is prime to m (and defined only modulo m). 
The two relatively prime integers (m, 13) with 0 < 13 < m are called the Seifert 
invariants of the exceptional orbit. 
Let us show now that V is a solid torus. Let v be an integer such that 
j3v = -1 mod m. Consider the map 
ip : Sl x D2 -----+ Sl X D2 
(z, v) f--------+ (zm, z-Vv). 
We have 
ip(Cf3z,(v) = (cmf3 zm, (C f3z)-V(v) = (zm,z-vv) 
so that ip factors through the Z/m-action, defining a map 
i.p: V -----+ Sl X D2. 
For t E Sl, we have 
<p(t· [z,v]) = i.p([tz,v]) = (tmzm,Cvz-vv) = t· <p(z, v) 
for the Sl-action on Sl x D2 defined by 
t· (Z, V) = (tm Z, CVV). 
In other words, <p is an equivariant mapping. Moreover, it is clearly bijective and 
an equivariant homeomorphism, hence the tube V is indeed a solid torus.

We have seen that any principal orbit turns m times around the exceptional 
orbit and thus meets any "meridian" at m points (see Figure 11 in which m = 3 
and 1/ = 2, where the principal orbit is bi , composed of m segments in the figure, 
and where ai is a meridian). 
Examples L3.5. Before giving the classification, let us investigate some examples. 
(1) We have seen that, if ml and m2 are relatively prime, the 81-action on 83 
by 
t· (Zl,Z2) = (tmlzl,tm2z2) 
is effective. The orbits (Zl' 0) and (0, Z2) are exceptional (if ml and m2 are 
at least 2), with respective types Zjml and Zjm2. 
A tubular neighborhood of the orbit (Zl,O) is a solid torus 8 1 x D2 on 
which 8 1 acts as above. 
If a are 13 are chosen both by Bezout and by equation 
13m2 - amI = 1 
with 0 < 13 < ml, 0 < a < m2, then the orbit invariants are (ml,f3) and 
(m2,m2 - a). 
(2) Let Zjp act on 83 by 
~. (Zl,Z2) = (~Zl,~qz2) 
where ~ = e2i7r/ p and q is prime to p. 
This is a free action of a finite group on a compact manifold. The quotient 
is a 3-manifold, denoted L(p, q) and called a lens space(6) of type (p, q). 
Then the circle acts on L(p, q) by projecting any action on the sphere. For 
instance, from the principal action we get an action with one exceptional 
orbit of type Zjq if q ~ 2. 
Let us now come back to the classification problem: we have a finite number 
r of exceptional orbits in W, having Zjml,"" Zjmr as stabilizers and respective 
Seifert invariants (ml,f31),"" (mr,f3r)' On the other hand, we have an orient able 
quotient surface B. 
We remove r discs D1 , ... ,Dr from B around the r points corresponding to 
the exceptional orbits, and we also remove a disc Do around a point corresponding 
to any principal orbit. This removes r + 1 solid tori Va, VI"'" Vr from W. 
Thus, when restricted to W - (Va U··· U Vr), the 8 1-action is principal and 
has a section (even if r = 0). We choose such a section 
(6)This is an example of a manifold the fundamental group of which is Zip.

CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Its boundary oa has a component over each oDi, that we call Oia. Consider the 
curve Oia. We know that it meets bi at exactly one point, thus (Oia, bi) is a basis 
of 1r1 (OVi). Choose a meridian ai as above and a "parallel" £i in such a way that 
(ai, £i) is a basis of 1r1 ( oVi) (oriented as (Oia, bi)) (see Figure 11). 
We have ai . bi = mi and £i . bi = Vi, and thus 
{ Oia = xai + Y£i 
bi = -Viai + mi£i 
that is 
where xmi + ViY = 1. Invert the matrix to get 
Hence 
ai = mioia - ybi 
with YVi = 1 - xmi that is -y == (3i mod mi. The meridian ai is thus written 
ai = mioia + nibi 
where mi is actually the order of the central orbit stabilizer in Vi and ni is con-
gruent to (3i mod mi· 
We can now modify the section a in such a way that ni is exactly Ik any 
map rp : (B - UDi ) -+ 8 1 can be used to modify a just by multiplication 
a<p(x) = rp(x) . a(x). 
If the degree of rploD, is di, then Oia<p '" Oia + dibi and 
ai = mioia<p + (ni - dimi)bi. 
To replace ni by (3i in the decomposition of the meridian above it is thus sufficient 
to find a map rp : B - UDi -+ 8 1 , such that deg rploDi = di and 0 < ni - dimi < mi· 
Now use the lemma: 
Lemma L3.6. Let V be a connected surface the boundary of which has r + 1 (circle) 
components oV = U~=O Ci . Let 7/J : oV -+ 8 1 be a continuous map and let di = 
deg( 7/JlcJ. There exists an extension of 7/J to V if and only if L, di = o. 
Proof Stokes formula shows that the condition is necessary: we can assume that 
7/J is differentiable, if there exists an extension, there exists a smooth extension 
;J: V -+ 8 1 . If dO denotes the volume form on 8 1, we compute 
t di = r 7/J*dO = r d(;J*dO) = O.

We prove the reciprocal by induction on r. If r = 0 (the case where the boundary 
is connected) and do = 0, then 't/J is homo~opic to the constant map. We can use 
the homotopy to construct the extension 't/J: take it to be constant outside a collar 
(see Figure 12). To proceed from r to r+ 1, we cut the surface along the boundary

of a small strip connecting the components of the boundary labelled rand r + 1 
(as shown on the right part of the same figure). The boundary of the new surface 
has r connected components. Notice that the closed surface obtained from this 
new surface is the same as before. Moreover, the degree along the new boundary 
component is the sum dr + dr+I , so that the total sum is zero and the induction 
hypothesis gives the desired extension 't/J.

Using the lemma, one can find a map <p which can be used to modify the n;'s 
over all the 8D;'s for 1 ~ i ~ r. This forces 
and at the same time forces an invariant (3 such that 80 rY + (3bo is the meridian in 
Vo to appear and explains why we needed the "extra" tube Vo. This way, we have 
determined a list of (normalized) invariants: 
and we have, just as in Proposition 1.3.1: 
Theorem L3. 7. Let W be a fixed point free oriented S I-manifold the orbit space of 
which is an oriented surface of genus g. The diffeomorphism type of W is deter-
mined by the list 
in which r is the number of exceptional orbits, (3i is a number which is prime to 
mi and is chosen such that 0 < (3i < mi and (mi, (3i) are the Seifert invariants of 
the orbit numbered i. Reciprocally, given such a list one can find an SI-manifold 
with these invariants.

CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Up to the order, the list is unique once we require the Seifert invariants to be 
normalized. Previous remarks (how to get normalized invariants) show moreover 
that the gluing data 
or 
or even 
(g I 0, (1, -/3 - (d1 + ... + dr)), (ml,/31 + d1md,···, (mr,/3r + drmr)) 
define the same Seifert manifold. 
I.3.d. Associated principal actions and Euler class. If W is a Seifert man-
ifold, then for any integer n, one can make Zjn act on W as a subgroup of 8 1. 
Proposition L3.8. Let W be an oriented Seifert manifold. Let n be a common 
multiple of the orders of the exceptional orbits. The manifold W', quotient of W 
by the Zjn-action, is endowed with an action of 8 1 j(Zjn) ~ 8 1 which is both 
effective and principal. 
Proof. We look at the neighborhood of an orbit (principal or exceptional). We will 
prove that the action on W' is effective and principal, and, at the same time, that 
W' is a manifold. 
Consider a tube V, neighborhood of an orbit with stabilizer Zjm (m might 
be equal to 1), and write n = mk. On V ~ 8 1 X D2, the circle 8 1 acts by 
t· (z,u) = (tmz,Cvu). 
Take the quotient of the tube by Zjn C 8 1: 
8 1 x D2 -----t 8 1 X D2 
(z,u) f--------t (zk,umk). 
The quotient Viis a solid torus as well and the quotient map an n-fold covering 
(branched along the central orbit when this orbit is exceptional, that is, when 
m ~ 2). Looking at each tube, we see that the quotient W' of W by Zjn is a 
manifold. Let us look now at the 8 1-action. The diagram 
V ----+ V' 
(z, u) f-I -------1) (zk, umk) = (Z, U) 
1 1 
I 
I 
V ----+ v' 
shows that the 8 1-action on V (resp. W) induces an action of 8 1 j(Zjn) on V' 
(resp. W') which is indeed effective and principal: after identification of 8 1 and 
81j(Zjn) by t f---t tn, this can be written (tZ,rVU) on tubes.

1.3. EXAMPLES: S"-ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 2 AND 3 
31 
Notice that the quotient of W' by this principal action is the same surface B 
that was the quotient of W: each orbit of the action on W gives one and only one 
orbit in W'. 
To define an Euler class for the Sl-action on W, one can try to divide by n 
the Euler class of the principal action just defined on W'. We need then to verify 
that the rational number obtained in this way does not depend on the choice of n. 
It is of course sufficient to understand what happens when a multiple n' of n is 
chosen. 
Proposition L3.9. Let W be a manifold of dimension 3 endowed with an action 
of the circle Sl. Let W' be the quotient of W by the subgroup Zjk of Sl. Make 
Sl ~ Sl j (Zj k) act on W'. The Euler class e' of the new action is e' = ke. 
Proof. Use the same notation as in I.3.b. Let p be the projection of W on W'. If 
eJ is a section of 
W - Vo ----t B - Do, 
then p 0 eJ is a section of 
W' - Vb ----t B - Do. 
On Figure 13, a and b represent a meridian and an orbit in oVo, a' and b' represent 
p 
Figure 13 
analogous objects in oVb. Now, 
sends the class of a to that of a' and the class of b to that of kb'. It sends of course 
the class of oeJ to that of o(p 0 eJ). Thus: 
a' - e'b' = [oeJ'] = [o(p 0 eJ)] = p*(a - eb) = a' - keb'.

CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Thus we get a well-defined Euler class e E Q for all (oriented, with oriented 
base space) Seifert fibrations. 
There exist other definitions of the Euler class for a Seifert fibration. We 
shall have the opportunity to meet one more later on. The interested readers may 
consult [24] for a rather complete list of definitions and references. 
1.4. Appendix: Lie groups, Lie algebras, homogeneous spaces 
Recall that a group G is said to be a Lie group if this is both a group and a manifold, 
the two structures being compatible in the sense that the group operations are 
differentiable mappings. This structure is particularly interesting, because it allows 
one to use the infinitesimal calculus. 
The main examples are the ones used in this book, the (compact) torus 
Tn = Rnjzn, the (complex) torus (c*)n, the linear groups GL(n;R), GL(n;C) 
and their subgroups, O(n), U(n), and so on. 
The Lie algebra. Let G be a Lie group with unit 1. Denote by 9 its tangent 
vector space T 1 G at the point 1. Recall that the map which, to a vector field 
tangent to G, associates its value at the point 1, defines an isomorphism from the 
vector space of left invariant vector fields on G to the tangent space 9 (this is 
obviously a linear map, and it is easy to check that it is one-to-one). 
We can thus think of the elements of 9 as being vector fields on the group G. 
Moreover, the bracket of two left invariant vector fields is again a left invariant 
vector field (easy verification) so that the bracket of vector fields induces a bracket 
on g. As the bracket of vector fields, this bracket is skew-symmetric and satisfies 
the Jacobi identity 
[[X, Yl, Z] + [[Y, Zl, X] + [[Z, X], Y] = 0, 
so that 9 has, indeed, the structure of a Lie algebra, this is the(7) Lie algebra of 
the group G. 
Here is an alternative description of the Lie bracket, through the useful no-
tions of "Adjoint" and "adjoint", representations. Firstly, the group acts on itself 
by conjugation 
'V g E G, G ---+ G 
h 1-------+ ghg-l. 
(7) Any Lie algebra will define (more or less uniquely, with some additional assumptions) a Lie 
group. When speaking of a Lie algebra g, I will always mean "the Lie algebra of the Lie group 
Gn (whether the group G is explicitly mentioned or not). 

1.4. APPENDIX: LIE GROUPS, LIE ALGEBRAS, HOMOGENEOUS SPACES 
33 
We may differentiate this map at 1, this is the Adjoint action 
V g E G, Adg : 9 ------+ 9 
X~Adg(X), 
which we may perfectly well consider as a map 
and differentiate at 1 
G ------+ End(g) 
g~Adg 
9 ------+ End(g) 
X~adx· 
The Lie bracket can also be defined by 
9 x 9 ------+ 9 
(X, Y) ~ 
adx(Y), 
namely [X, Y] = adx(Y), as is easily checked from the definitions. 
Another viewpoint on the same object: adx is a vector field on 9 (which value 
at Y is [X, Y]), this is the fundamental vector field of the adjoint action associated 
with X. 
Examples L4.1 
(1) If the Lie group G is the torus Tn, the Lie algebra is R n, as a vector space, 
with the trivial Lie bracket [X, Y] == 0, this reflecting the fact that the 
group is Abelian and thus the Adjoint action trivial. 
(2) Consider the group G = SO(n) of the positive isometries in the Euclidean 
space R n. Differentiating the relation tAA = Id at Id gives that the tangent 
space is the vector space 9 = .5o(n) of n x n skew-symmetric matrices. 
Using the definitions above, one sees that the group SO(n) acts on .so(n) 
by conjugation (this is the Adjoint action here) and that the Lie bracket 
on 9 is simply the commutator [X, Y] = XY - Y X (this will always be the 
case with a group of matrices, notice that in this case, the Jacobi identity 
for the Lie bracket becomes obvious). 
There are other examples in the exercises at the end of this chapter. 
The exponential mapping. Let X E g. We can consider X as a vector field on 
G and, as such, integrate it: there exists a map 
]- E, E[ ------+ G 
t ~ 
CPt(X) 
defined for E small enough, and such that 
d 
dtCPt(X) = X(cpt(X)) and CPo(X) = 1.

CHAPTER 1. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Using the fact that G is a group, it is checked that 'Pt is indeed defined on R (that 
is, for all values of t) and is a group homomorphism, namely 
This allows us to define a mapping 
Rxg~G 
( t, X) 1----------7 'Pt (X) 
and the exponential mapping: 
g~G 
X 1----------7 exp( X) = 'PI (X). 
Example L4.2. 
Let G be the torus of dimension 1, G = R/Z, so that g = R 
exp : R --t 8 1 is the ... exponential mapping t I-t e2i7rt . Notice that we can also 
consider this torus as being the unit circle 
81 = {u E C Ilul = I} 
and the exponential mapping () I-t ei (). They are not exactly the same, since the 
former has period 1 while the latter has period 27r. We shall try to be precise, 
using the notation t for the I-periodic coordinate and () for the 27r-periodic one. 
The main properties of the exponential mapping are listed in the next propo-
sition. 
Proposition L4.3. The exponential mapping is a differentiable mapping that satisfies 
(1) exp(t + u)X = exptX . expuX, 
(2) exp(-tX) = (exptX)-I. 
Moreover, this is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of 0 E g onto a neighbor-
hood of1 E G. 
Proof. The proof of the two equalities is straightforward, starting from the defini-
tion. The differentiability properties also come from the definition, which implies 
both the fact that exp is differentiable and that (d exp)o = rd. 
D 
Remark L4.4. The exponential mapping is not in general a global diffeomorphism. 
Think for instance of the example of the circle above. 
Notice that it follows from the proposition that there is a whole neighborhood 
of 1 in the image of the exponential mapping. From this the next proposition is 
deduced. 
Proposition L4.5. 
In a connected Lie group, any element can be written as a 
product of exponentials. 

1.4. APPENDIX: LIE GROUPS, LIE ALGEBRAS, HOMOGENEOUS SPACES 
35 
Proof A connected Lie group is path-connected. Let 9 be any element of the group 
G and let "( : [0, 1] ~ G be a path from 1 to g. Let U be an open neighborhood 
of 1 that is included in the image of the exponential mapping. Let gl = "((td be 
an element of U n "(([0, 1]), for some h > 0. We select then g2 = "((t2) (for some 
t2 > t1) in gl . Un "(([0, 1]), and so on. We thus get a covering of the compact set 
"(([0,1]) by the open subsets gk . U, which we can assume to be finite. Hence, 9 
belongs to, say, gn-1 . U, so that 9 = gn-1 exp(Xn), but gn-2 belongs to gn-2 . U, 
and so on, so that eventually

Closed subgroups of Lie groups. A classical and very useful theorem of Cart an 
asserts: 
Theorem L4.6. 
A closed subgroup of a Lie group is a Lie subgroup. 
The main points are, H c G being a closed subgroup, to show that 
~ = {X E g I exp(tX) E H "It E R} 
is a vector space (this will be the Lie algebra of H), and to prove the following 
lemma. 
Lemma L4. 7. 
Let~' be a vector subspace supplementary to ~ in g. The mapping 
cp : ~ EEl ~' ----+ G 
(X,X') f----+ expX'expX 
is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of 0 onto its image. 
The lemma itself is a consequence of the inverse function theorem and of the 
fact that (dcp)o(X + X') = X + X'. 
Another very important property is that homogeneous spaces of Lie groups 
are manifolds, this is what allows us to work with the orbit mappings as in § 1.1. b. 
Theorem L4.B. Let H be a closed subgroup of the Lie group G and let 
1f : G ----+ G/H 
be the quotient map. There is a unique manifold structure on G /H such that 
-
the quotient map 1f is a differentiable mapping, 
-
for any point [x] of the quotient, there exists a neighborhood U of [x] and a 
differentiable local section cr : U ~ G of 1f. 
Notice that 1f is then a submersion. 

36 
CHAPTER I. SMOOTH LIE GROUP ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
Proof The quotient space GjH is endowed with the quotient topology. The Lie 
group G is Hausdorff and the subgroup H is closed, hence G jH is Hausdorff. Let 
us now look at the differentiability properties. 
The proof of the uniqueness property is fairly standard. Assume (GjH)' is 
the same set but with a (maybe) different differentiable structure. Let [x] E GjH, 
we have a neighborhood U and a differentiable section 
a:U~G 
so that Idu = 7r 0 a is a differentiable mapping, thus proving that 
Id: GjH ~ 
(GjH)' 
is differentiable at [x]. The same reasoning for the "other" identity map 
Id: (GjH)' ~ 
GjH 
shows that Id is a diffeomorphism, which is the expected uniqueness property. 
Let us now prove the existence. To begin with, we prove the result in a 
neighborhood of [1] E GjH. Let us write, as in Lemma 1.4.7, g = ~ EB ~', so that 
the mapping 
'P: ~EB~' ~ 
G 
(X, X') f----> exp(X') exp(X) 
is a diffeomorphism from a neighborhood of 0, say V onto its image. We can assume 
that V = VI X V{, for some VI C ~, V{ C ~'. Let U = 7r('P(V)). The set 
7r-I(U) = U 7r-I([x]) = U y. H = U 'P(V) . h 
[xJEU 
yE'P(V) 
hEH 
is an open subset of G, as 'P(V) . h is open. Hence U is open, by definition of the 
quotient topology. Now the mapping 
T:U~~' 
[x] f----> X' where x = exp(X') exp(X) 
is both 
- well-defined: let x E 'P(V), x = exp(X') exp(X) and y E H n exp(V), 
y = exp(Y), then 
xy = exp(X') exp(X) exp(Y) = exp(X') exp(Z) for some Z E ~ n V 
(because 'P is a diffeomorphism) and thus T([XY]) = T[X], 
- and injective: if x = exp(X') exp(X) and y = exp(X') exp(Y), we have 
y-Ix = (exp(y))-l(exp(X'))-l exp(X') exp(X) = (exp(y))-I exp(X) E H, 
thus [x] = [y]. 

EXERCISES 
37 
We can then use 7 to put a differentiable structure on U, defined so that 7 is a 
diffeomorphism (a local chard). Let us now prove that this structure satisfies the 
expected properties. 
The mapping 
g=f)EBf)' ~ 
f)' 
(X, X') f----+ X' 
is differentiable, and so is the mapping 
<.p -1 : <.p(V) ------+ V. 
It follows that the composition 
p = po <.p-1 : <.p(V) ------+ V{ 
exp(X') exp(X) f----+ X' 
is differentiable and that 7- 1 0 P : <.p(V) ----t U is a differentiable mapping as well. 
But 
7- 1 0 p(x) = 7- 1 0 p(exp(X') exp(X)) = 7- 1(X') = X 
so that 7-1 0 P = 7r, hence 7r is differentiable. 
Now, the expected section (Y : U ----t G is defined as (Y = exp07, an obviously 
differentiable mapping, that satisfies 
7r 0 (Y([x]) = 7r 0 expo7([X]) = 7r(exp(X')) = [exp(X')] = [exp(X') exp(X)] = [x] 
so that 7r 0 (Y = Idu. 
We have thus proved the theorem in a neighborhood of [1] E G/H. To prove 
it at the other points, we just need to use the left translations 
Lx[Y] = [xy].

CHAPTER II 
SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
In this chapter, we define symplectic manifolds, give their basic properties, and give 
a few examples of such objects, among which the 'H)..'s we have already met: 'H).. is 
the set of all n x n Hermitian matrices with given spectrum A = (AI, ... ,An) ERn. 
We already know that 'H).. is indeed a manifold, as this is an orbit of the compact 
group U(n) (see Example 1.1.6) acting by conjugation on the vector space 'H of all 
Hermitian matrices. We will prove that they are symplectic manifolds. 
IL1. What is a symplectic manifold? 
II.1.a. Symplectic vector spaces. A symplectic vector space is a real vector 
space endowed with a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. 
ExampleIL1.1. Consider a vector space F, its dual F*, and the direct sum F(JJF*. 
The bilinear form 
(F EEl F*) x (F EEl F*) ----t R 
((x, 'P), (x', 'P')) f-------> 'P(X') - 'P' (x) 
is obviously skew-symmetric and nondegenerate, and thus gives FEEl F* the struc-
ture of a symplectic vector space. 
Example ILl.2. Consider the complex vector space en, endowed with its standard 
Hermitian form, denoted 
(X, Y) f-------> (X, Y). 
We look at en as a real 2n-dimensional vector space and consider the real bilinear 
form 
w(X, Y) = Im(X, Y). 
This is skew-symmetric 
Im{X, Y) = 1m {X, Y) = 
- 1m{X, Y), 

44 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
and nondegenerate: if Im(X, Y) = 0 for all Y, then Im(X, iY) = 0 for all Y, and 
(X, Y) = 0 for all Y, hence X = 0 since the Hermitian form is nondegenerate. 
These two examples are not very different. They are actually isomorphic, 
since there is a unique (up to isomorphism) symplectic vector space in any (even) 
dimension. More precisely, the dimension of a symplectic vector space is even and 
is the only invariant of its isomorphism type. This is a consequence of the existence 
of symplectic bases, asserted by the following proposition. 
Proposition ILl.3. 
Let w be a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form 
on a finite dimensional real vector space E. There exists a symplectic basis 
(eI, ... ,en,h, ... ,fn), namely a basis of E such that w(ei,/j) = 8i,j, and 
w(ei,ej) =w(/i,fj) =0. 
Proof. As w is nondegenerate, it is not identically zero. Hence, there exist two 
vectors el and h such that w(el, h) = 1. One then checks that the restriction 
of w to the orthogonal complement (with respect to w) of the plane (el' h) is 
nondegenerate. One eventually concludes by induction on the dimension-once 
noticing that an alternated bilinear form on a vector space of dimension 1 is 
~. 
D 
Example ILl.4. Let (XI, ... , xn) be any basis of the vector space F, (xi, ... , x~) 
be the dual basis of F*. Then the basis 
((Xl, 0), ... , (xn, 0), (0, -xt), ... , (0, -x~)) 
is a symplectic basis for the symplectic vector space FEEl F* of Example II. 1. 1. 
Example IL1.5. Let (el' ... ,en) be a unitary basis of the complex vector space en. 
Write fJ = -iej, then 
Im(ej,/k) = -Im(ej,iek) = -Im(-i(ej,ek)) = (ej,ek) = 8j,k 
and, analogously, w(ej, ek) = w(/j, /k) = 0, thus the basis 
is a symplectic basis of the symplectic vector space en of Example II.1.2. 
The symplectic group. This is the group Sp(2n; R) C GL(2n; R) of all "isome-
tries" of the symplectic form. This is of course a Lie subgroup of GL(2n; R). If J 
denotes the skew-symmetric matrix 
J = 
( 
0 Id) 
-Id 0 
(so that w(x, y) = ixJy), 
Sp(2n; R) = {g E GL(2n; R) I tgJg = J}.

Its Lie algebra is the space of matrices X such that 
tXJ + JX = 0, 
45 
the linear equation obtained as the differential, at the point Id, of the equation 
tgJg-J=O. 
The symplectic form as a differential form. Let E be a symplectic vec-
tor space of dimension 2n. We choose a symplectic basis, according to Proposi-
tion 11.1.3 and write the coordinates of a vector 
n 
x = i)Xiei + ydi) 
i=l 
in this basis, so that 
n 
w(x, x') = ~)XiY~ - X;Yi). 
i=l 
One can thus write w as a differential form 
n 
w = L dXi 1\ dYi· 
i=l 
This is an exact differential form (the differential of a degree I-form): 
n 
w = d(L XidYi) = -da, 
i=l 
where the form a is E~=l Yidxi. The I-form a is called the Liouville form. 
II.1.b. The definition of a symplectic manifold. Let us try now to under-
stand what could be the definition of a symplectic manifold W. One would first 
ask that each tangent space is endowed with the structure of a symplectic vector 
space as defined above. For any x E W, we should be given a skew-symmetric 
bilinear form Wx , say, on TxW. Of course, Wx should depend smoothly on x, in 
other words, the collection of all the wx's should be a differential2-form on W. We 
should ask, moreover, that the skew-symmetric form Wx is nondegenerate, which 
can be expressed by writing, if the dimension (obviously even) of the manifold W 
is denoted 2n, 
n 
2n 
1\ Wx i 0 E 1\ T~W 
for all x, that is to say that the 2n-form wAn is a volume form on W. Note in 
particular that, wAn being a volume form on W, this manifold must be orientable. 
In fact this is not sufficient: the calculus that wallows on W should be 
locally the same as that on our standard linear examples. Recall from above that 
the bilinear form on a symplectic vector space is an exact 2-form (since w = -da). 
We could try to require that the symplectic form w on our supposed symplectic 

46 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
manifold is an exact form. Unfortunately, this would prevent the manifold W 
from being compact (which is a little embarrassing if one wants the H>.'s to be 
symplectic manifolds) because of the following proposition. 
Proposition ILl.6. Let W be a compact manifold. There exists no 2-form on W 
which is both nondegenerate and exact. 
Proof We have said that the 2-form w is nondegenerate if and only if wAn is a 
volume form. Now, if w = d(3 is exact, then 
wAn = d((3/\ wA(n-l)) 
is also an exact form. This is forbidden by the Stokes formula, the integral on W 
of the volume form is positive, hence this would give: 
0# { wAn = ( d((3/\ wA(n-l)) = { (3/\ wA(n-l) = 0

Jaw 
since W is a closed manifold. 
o 
In fact, this was not a very good idea, in order to be able to calculate locally 
as in a symplectic vector space, to use a. .. global property such as of the exactness 
of a differential form. The local notion corresponding to exactness is the notion of 
closeness. .. and eventually we can define a symplectic manifold as a pair (W, w) 
where W is a manifold and w a closed nondegenerate 2-form. 
We shall very often call the manifold W itself a symplectic manifold (where 
no ambiguity is possible). 
Examples ILl. 7 
(1) Any symplectic vector space, with its "constant" symplectic form E dXj /\ 
dYj is a symplectic manifold. 
(2) If V is a manifold, consider the total space of its cotangent bundle, with 
the projection: 
7r: T*V -----t V. 
On T*V, there is a canonical(1) differential 1-form, the Liouville form, Q, 
defined by 
Q(x,<p)(X) = cp(T x7r(X)), 
where x E V, cp E T~V is a linear form on TxV, and X E T(x,<p) (T*V). 
The 2-form w = -dQ is exact, hence closed. If (XI, ... , xn) are local 
coordinates on V, and if (Yl, ... , Yn) are the "dual" coordinates, then 
(Xl, ... , Xm Yl, ... , Yn) is a system of local coordinates on T*V in which 
Q = E Yidxi and w = E dXi /\ dYi. This shows that w is nondegenerate. 
(1)8ee Exercise II.12 for a justification of the word canonical. 

ILl. WHAT IS A SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLD? 
47 
We shall often refer to this form w as the symplectic form on the cotan-
gent bundle(2). The example of F EB F* above may be considered as the 
special case where V = F = R n. 
(3) If W is a surface, then the notion of symplectic form coincides with that of 
volume form: all the orientable surfaces may thus be potentially considered 
as symplectic manifolds. Here are two examples, that are also shown in 
Figure l. 
(4) Consider, in particular, the unit sphere 82 in R3. The tangent space of 8 2 
at a point v is the plane orthogonal to the unit vector v. Put 
wv(X, Y) = v· (X x Y) = det(v,X, Y). 
This is a nondegenerate 2-form and thus a symplectic form. 
(5) The 2-torus is the quotient of R2 by its subgroup Z2. The "constant" sym-
plectic form dx 1\ dy is invariant by the integral translations, hence it de-
scends to a symplectic form on the torus. 
o 
Figure 1 
Remark ILI.8 (The symplectic volume). As we have noticed, if w is a symplectic 
form, wlln is a volume form. The 2n-form Wlln In! is called the symplectic volume 
form. Notice that 
hence the normalization, which gives volume 1 to the torus R 2n Iz2n. 
(2)One more example of an exact symplectic form, on a noncornpact rnanifold. 

48 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
II. I.e. The Darboux theorem. The fact that all the symplectic vector spaces 
of the same dimension are isomorphic is the linear version of a more general result, 
the Darboux theorem, which asserts that, locally, all the symplectic manifolds are 
isomorphic. We will use a more general form, due to Weinstein, which describes 
symplectic manifolds in the neighborhood of certain submanifolds. 
Theorem IL1.9 ([128]). Let Wo and WI be two symplectic forms on a manifold W. 
Assume they coincide on a closed submanifold V. Then there exists a neighborhood 
Uo of V in Wand a map 
'lj;:Uo--tW 
such that 
'lj;lv = Idv and'lj;*wI = WOo 
Remark ILI.IO. The map 'lj; given by this statement is automatically a local dif-
feomorphism because w~n = 'lj;*wtn and because these two 2n-forms are volume 
forms. 
Corollary ILI.II (Darhoux). 
Let x be a point in a symplectic manifold (W,w). 
There exists a system of local coordinates (Xl, ... ,Xn, YI, ... ,Yn) centered at X in 
which W = L dXi 1\ dYi. 
Proof of the corollary. We want to apply the theorem to the submanifold V = {x}, 
by comparing W with the (constant) form on T x W. The theorem does not allow 
this, the two forms not being defined on the same space. We must first use a local 
diffeomorphism T x W ~ Wand for instance the exponential of any Riemannian 
metric will do. 
Thus let <p = expx : Vo ~ Uo, where Vo C T x Wand Vo C Ware open 
subsets, so small that <p is a diffeomorphism. Define Wo = (<p-l)*wx. Now Wo and 
ware two symplectic forms on Uo, which coincide at x by definition. We can thus 
apply the theorem: if necessary by restricting Uo, there exists a diffeomorphism 'lj; 
such that 'lj;*w = W00 If (Xl, ... ,Xn,YI, ... ,Yn) are coordinates with respect to a 
symplectic basis of the vector space T x W, the local chart 'lj; 0 <p transforms them 
into a system of local coordinates in which W = L dXi 1\ dYi. 
D 
Proof of the theorem. We apply the path method due to Moser [111]. This means 
that we consider the form Wt = Wo + t(WI - wo). This is a closed form, and, 
as Wo and WI coincide on V, it is nondegenerate on V and thus on a tubular 
neighborhood of V (nondegeneracy is clearly an open property). The segment 
[0,1] being compact, there exists a tubular neighborhood U of Von which all the 
forms Wt are symplectic. 
As Wo and WI are closed, so is Wo - WI and it is thus possible to find, on a 
neighborhood of V, a 1-form {3 such that d{3 = Wo - WI. Indeed, U is diffeomorphic 

11.1. WHAT IS A SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLD? 
49 
with an open neighborhood of the zero section of a vector bundle on V, hence 
retracts on V. The Poincare lemma applies to Wo - Wl. It gives us the form /3, that 
can be chosen so that /3x = 0 for all x E V. 
The 2-form Wt being symplectic, it defines a pairing between tangent and 
cotangent spaces, we thus get, for all t, a vector field Xt dual to /3 through Wt, 
that is, such that ixtwt = /3. We consider now X t as a vector field depending 
on time, vanishing on V for all t. Its flow CPt keeps V fixed, thus one can find a 
neighborhood Uo of x where CPt is defined and such that CPt(Uo) C Uo. 
We thus get: 
! [cptWtJ = CPt [~t + .cXtWt] = CPt [Wl - Wo + Wo - W1J = 0 
because £XtWt = dixtwt+ixtdwt = d/3 using the Cartan formula and the definition 
of cpo The form CP~Wt does not depend on t, it equals Wo for t = 0 and we deduce 
the result with 'Ij; = CPl. 
0 
The theorem has corollaries which describe a normal form for a symplec-
tic manifold in the neighborhood of a submanifold on which the symplectic form 
has constant rank. We will use the case where the submanifold is symplectic (this 
is Corollary 1I.1.12), but notice that it describes, for instance, tubular neighbor-
hoods of isotropic submanifolds (those on which W vanishes(3)) of W. It asserts 
in particular that if L is an isotropic submanifold of maximal dimension (then 
dimL = ~ dim Wand L is said to be Lagrangian), a tubular neighborhood of L 
in W is (in a symplectic fashion) isomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero section 
in T* L (with the canonical symplectic form). 
These corollaries are deduced from the theorem as the Darboux Theorem 
is, comparing a neighborhood of the submanifold under consideration with some 
model space (the tangent space T x W in the case where the submanifold V was a 
point). We will need the notion of the symplectic normal bundle to a submanifold 
V C W on which the symplectic form has constant rank. This is simply the vector 
bundle 
(TV)O j(TV) n (TVt 
denoting by ° the orthogonality, in TW, with respect to w. This is indeed a vector 
bundle (this is the constant rank assumption) and it is symplectic in the sense 
that the fibers are symplectic vector spaces. Notice that this is indeed a normal 
bundle, namely a supplement of the tangent bundle TV C j*TW if and only if V 
is a symplectic submanifold. 
(3)This is a good opportunity to define a coisotropic submanifold, namely a submanifold V such 
that, for any point x, the orthogonal of T x V is contained in T xV. 

50 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
Corollary IL I. 12. Let (W, w) and (W', Wi) be symplectic manifolds. Suppose that V 
is a manifold that embeds both in Wand W', that the pull backs of wand Wi have 
constant rank and such that the symplectic normal bundles of V in Wand W' are 
isomorphic as symplectic vector bundles. Then the map identifying the images of 
V in Wand W' extends to a diffeomorphism <p between neighborhoods of these 
images such that <p* Wi = w. 
Proof. The proof is the same as that of Corollary 11.1.11, using tubular neighbor-
hoods of V. See, for instance, [96]' for detail. 
D 
Remark ILI.13. In case we need them later, notice all the proofs above become 
easily "equivariant proofs" if there is a Lie group G acting on W, preserving the 
symplectic forms and the submanifolds{4}. This is the reason why we used <p = expx 
in the above proof instead of any local chart: it suffices now to choose an invariant 
metric to get equivariant local coordinates. 
Remark ILI.14. A statement analogous to 11.1.9 for Riemannian metrics would 
be definitely false: in the Riemannian case, there is a local invariant which distin-
guishes between the neighborhood of a point and the tangent space at that point, 
namely the curvature. We have just proved that there exist no local invariants in 
symplectic geometry. 
II.1.d. Examples: U (n )-orbits in Hermitian matrices. Consider the group 
U(n) acting by conjugation on the vector space 1t of Hermitian matrices 
1t = {X E Mn(C) I X = X} . 
Recall that Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues and are diagonalizable in a 
unitary basis, so that the orbits of this action are the submanifolds 
1t>. = {A E 1t I spectrum of A = (Al, ... , An)} for A = (Al, ... , An) ERn. 
Let us describe first these orbits as manifolds. 
Proposition IL I. 15. 
Assume that A consists of k distinct values with multi-
plicities nl, ... , nk. The orbit 1t>. is diffeomorphic with the homogeneous space 
U(n)/U(nl) x ... x U(nk). 
Proof. We put the eigenvalues in increasing order J.Ll < ... < J.Lk. Then any element 
in 1t>. is determined by the sequence Ql, Q2, ... , Qk of its eigenspaces, Qi having 
dimension the multiplicity ni of J.Li (recall once again that Hermitian matrices are 
diagonalizable) and the Q/s being mutually orthogonal (Hermitian matrices are 
diagonalizable in a unitary basis). The stabilizer of the matrix corresponding to 
Qi = {O} X cn; X {O} is U(nl) x ... x U(nk). This gives the proposition. And this 
(4)The equivariant form of Corollary 11.1.12 is due to Marie [100].

shows that the orbit under consideration is diffeomorphic with the manifolds of 
flags 
o 
Examples II.1.16 
(1) Complete flags. If all the eigenvalues AI, ... , An are distinct, any element in 
H>. defines (and is defined by) the family of its eigenspaces, here a family 
of pairwise orthogonal lines in en. One thus defines a bijection from H>. 
onto the manifold of complete flags in en, 
associating to a matrix h the subspaces Pi = £1 EEl ..• EEl £i where £i is the 
eigenspace of h corresponding to Ai. The dimension of these orbits is n 2 - n. 
(2) Trivial case. On the other hand, if all the eigenvalues are equal, there is 
only one point in the orbit. There is not much to say here. 
(3) Complex projective space. Suppose now that Al i- A2 = ... = An. Then the 
eigenspace associated with Al is a line and the one associated with A2 is the 
orthogonal hyperplane. The map: \]! >. : H>. ---7 pn-1 (e) which associates 
the AI-eigenspace with h is a diffeomorphism. 
Notice that the diffeomorphism type of the orbit depends only on the multi-
plicities of the eigenvalues, not on their actual values. 
We check now what was announced at the very beginning of this chapter: the 
orbits H>. are symplectic manifolds. To begin with, some (bi)linear algebra in the 
space of all Hermitian matrices. 
The mapping h 1---7 ih is an isomorphism from the real vector space H onto the 
real vector space u(n) of skew-Hermitian matrices, which is indeed the Lie algebra 
of the group U(n) (Exercise 1.15). Now we have a symmetric bilinear form, defined 
on H: 
(X, Y) f------> tr(XY) = tr(XY). 
This is an inner product, since 
tr(XY) = L Xi,jYi,j = 2 L Re(xi,jYi,j) + L Xk,kYk,k' 
i,j 
i<j 
k 
The same formula defines a (negative definite) bilinear form on u(n). Notice that 
these forms are invariant under conjugation. They allow us to identify H = iu( n) 
with the dual vector space u(n)*. 
Define now, for any matrix h E H, a skew-symmetric bilinear form Wh on 
u(n) = T1 U(n) = iH by 
Wh(X, Y) = tr([X, Y]ih). 

52 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
Notice that Wh(X, Y) = tr(X(Yih - ihY)) and Yh - hY E H. The kernel of Wh is 
thus the subspace 
Kh = {Y E u(n) I [Y, ihl = O} . 
If we differentiate the relation ghg- 1 = h with respect to g, we see that Kh is 
nothing other than the Lie algebra of the stabilizer of h for the action of U(n) on 
H by conjugation. 
Let us consider now the orbit map !h : U(n) --t H and its derivative 
Tdh: u(n) ------+ ThH>. c H. 
We know that its image is indeed T h H>., that is, it is generated by the fundamental 
vector fields [X, h], and its kernel is the Lie algebra Kh of the stabilizer. Hence, Wh 
defines a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form Wh on T hH>. by the formula 
Wh([X, hl, [Y, h]) = tr([X, Ylih) for X, Y E u(n). 
Thus we have defined, on any orbit H>., a nondegenerate 2-form w. The only 
thing which is left to prove is the fact that W is indeed a closed form. It is enough 
to prove that 
dWh([X, h], [Y, h], [Z, h]) = 0 for all X, Y, Z E u(n). 
Now, if X denotes the fundamental vector field associated with X, namely X h = 
[X, hl, one has 
3dW(X, Y,Q) = X· w(Y,Q) - y. w(X,Q) + Q. w(X, Y) 
+ w([X, Yl, Z) + w([Y,Q],X) + w([Z, X], Y). 
Now the form w is invariant, by definition, and the vector fields are fundamental 
ones, so that the first three terms vanish. And the sum which is left vanishes 
because of the Jacobi identity in the Lie algebra u(n) (there is indeed a close 
relation between the closedness of symplectic forms and the Jacobi identity, see 
Remark I1.3.4 and Exercise I1.27). 
Thus all the orbits H>. under consideration are compact symplectic manifolds. 
Notice that, if the diffeomorphism type of the manifold H>. depends only on the 
multiplicities of the eigenvalues, its symplectic form depends on the actual values 
of the Ai'S. 
For instance, we have thus exhibited a lot of symplectic forms on pn-l(C), 
one for each pair of distinct real numbers. See Exercise I1.13. 
11.2. Calibrated almost complex structures 
Recall that cn is a model for the symplectic vector spaces of dimension 2n. This is 
not accidental: on any symplectic manifold, there are almost complex structures. 

11.2. CALIBRATED ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES 
53 
A (linear) complex structure on a real vector space E is an endomorphism J 
of E such that j2 = -l. Analogously, an almost complex structure on a manifold 
W is a section J of the bundle End TW such that f; = - IdTxw for all x in W. 
For instance, if W is a complex manifold (namely a manifold with complex holo-
morphic change of local coordinates), its tangent space T x W at any point has a 
natural structure of complex vector space and the multiplication by i is an almost 
complex structure. This is the situation we are trying to mimic: J plays the role 
of multiplication by i. Note that J gives TW the structure of a complex vector 
bundle, each T x W becoming a complex vector space by 
(a + ib) . ~ = a~ + bJ~. 
Let, for instance, W be an oriented surface, endowed with a Riemannian 
metric, in such a way that we have a notion of rotation by +7r /2 in every tangent 
plane. The family of all such rotations defines an almost complex structure on W, 
thus any oriented surface admits almost complex structures. Of course, not any 
manifold, even of even dimension, even oriented, may be endowed with an almost 
complex structure(5). 
In C n , the standard Hermitian product decomposes into its real and imagi-
nary parts: 
(u,v) = (u,v) +iw(u,v) 
the Euclidean inner product of R 2n and its symplectic form, respectively. One 
easily checks that w(iu, v) is the Euclidean inner product and moreover that 
w(iu,iv) = w(u,v): multiplication by i is an isometry of w. We now try to mimic 
this situation in the following definition. 
An almost complex structure J on a symplectic manifold (W, w) will be called 
calibrated(6) if J is an "isometry" of wand if the symmetric bilinear form w( J X, Y) 
is positive-definite at each point. 
II.2.a. The linear case. The linear group GL(2n, R) acts on the space of com-
plex structures on R2n by conjugation: g. J = gJg- 1 . Using a J-complex basis, 
one sees that this action is transitive and that the stabilizer of a given almost 
complex structure Jo is the group of all complex (for Jo) automorphisms. In other 
words, the set of all linear almost complex structures on R 2n can be identified 
with the homogeneous space 
.In = GL(2n, R)/ GL(n, C). 
(5) For instance, it can be shown that this is not the case for the 4-sphere. 
(6) implicitly: "by the symplectic form". 

54 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
Let us now show that there exist calibrated complex structures on any sym-
plectic vector space (E, w). First choose a Euclidean inner product (X, Y). As (,) 
and ware nondegenerate, the relation (X, AY) = w(X, Y) defines an isomorphism 
A : E --+ E. Write the polar decomposition of A, namely A = BJ, were B is 
symmetric positive definite, A and B commute and J is isometric. 
Lemma IL2.I. The endomorphism A is skew-symmetric, J is an isometry for w, 
it satisfies J2 = -1 and JB = BJ. 
Proof. We have 
(X, AY) = w(X, Y) = -w(Y, X) = -(AX, Y) 
thus A is skew-symmetric. Writing J = B- 1 A, we get 
tJ = tAtB- 1 = -AB- 1 = -B- 1A = -J. 
But J is an isometry, so that tJ J = 1, and J is indeed a complex structure. 
Moreover 
t(BJ) = tJtB = tJB = -BJ 
hence Band J commute, thus A and J commute as well, and we are done: 
w(JX, JY) = (JX,AJY) = (JX,JAY) = (X,AY) = w(X, Y). 
D 
Now the inner product defined by B is 
((X, Y)) = (BX, Y) = w(JX, Y). 
We have shown the existence, on every symplectic vector space, of calibrated com-
plex structures. Moreover, the form ((,)) + iw(,) is Hermitian. 
Remark IL2.2. Doing the construction of J above fiberwise gives the fact that any 
symplectic vector bundle has the structure of a complex vector bundle. 
Now that we know that there exist calibrated complex structures, we show 
that the set of all such structures is contractible. The proof given here is due to 
Sevennec (see [12]), another proof is sketched in Exercise II.16. Denote by.Jc(w) 
the set of almost complex structures calibrated by w. 
Proposition IL2.3. Let Jo be a complex structure on R2n calibrated by the form w. 
The map 
J t-----t (J + JO)-l 0 (J - Jo) 
is a diffeomorphism from Jc(w) onto the open unit ball in the vector space of 
symmetric matrices S such that JoS + SJo = o. 
Corollary IL2.4. The space .Jc(w) is contractible. 
D 

II.2. CALIBRATED ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES 
55 
Proof The endomorphism J + Jo is invertible, since, for x "# 0, 
w((J + Jo)x,x) = w(Jx,x) + w(Jox, x) > O. 
Thus the map in the statement is well-defined. Now, we put A = J01 0 J, so that 
S = (J + JO)-1 0 (J - Jo) 
= (Jo 0 (J01 + J))-1 0 (Jo 0 (J - Jo)) 
= (A + Id)-1 0 (A - Id). 
We want to prove that IISII < 1, that is, that IIAx - xl12 < IIAx + xl12 for all x "# o. 
But, 
IIAx + xl12 -IIAx - xl12 = 4(Ax) . x 
=4w(JooAx,x) 
= 4w(Jx,x) > O. 
Now, J is calibrated if and only if for any x, y E R 2n, 
w ((Id -S) x, (Id -S) y) = w ((Id +S) x, (Id +S) y), 
which is equivalent to 
w (Sx, y) + w (x, Sy) = O. 
Hence J is calibrated if and only if S is symmetric. Moreover, J is an almost 
complex structure (J-1 = -J) if and only if JoS + SJo = o. 
Conversely, let S be a symmetric matrix such that IISII < 1, which implies 
that Id -S is invertible and that the endomorphism 
J = Jo 0 (Id +S) 0 (Id _S)-1 
is well-defined. The two maps J f--> Sand S f--> J are obviously inverse of each 
~~.

II.2.b. Calibrated almost complex structures on a symplectic manifold. 
Let W be a 2n-dimensional manifold endowed with a symplectic form w. With its 
tangent bundle are associated the bundles 
J (TW) ----+ W 
with fibre In 
Jc (TW,w) ----+ W with fibre Jc(w) 
of almost complex structures, resp. calibrated almost complex structures on W. A 
calibrated complex structure is simply a section of the bundle Jc (TW, w) ---> W. 
As this bundle has a nonempty contractible fiber, we get: 
Proposition IL2.S. 
The space of almost complex structures calibrated by w is 
nonempty and contractible. 
o 

56 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
This proof gives in particular the existence of a calibrated almost complex 
structure on any symplectic manifold. This can be proved directly, in the very same 
way that we have proven the existence of a calibrated (linear) complex structure 
on R 2n. We just have to replace the inner product by a Riemannian metric and 
to notice that the map A f---+ B = vtAA in the polar decomposition is smooth. 
Remark IL2.6. The symplectic form w induces a symplectic form on any submani-
fold of W which is preserved by a calibrated almost complex structure. Indeed, if 
j : Z C W is the inclusion of such a submanifold, j*w is nondegenerate: 
't/ X E TzZ - {O},:3 Y E TzZ such that w(X, Y) -I- 0 
because Y = J X works. 
The equivariant case. Assume now that our symplectic manifold W is acted 
on by a compact Lie group G. Assume that the G-action preserves the symplectic 
form in the sense that 
't/gE G 
g*w = w. 
Due to the compactness of G, we know that there exists an invariant Riemannian 
metric ( , ) on W (see § 1.2.a). The calibrated almost complex structure J obtained 
by the method above (polar decomposition) is invariant. To prove this, it suffices 
to prove that the field of endomorphisms A defined by 
is invariant. Let g E G, x E W, X E TgoxW, Y E TxW. Then 
(X, T xg 0 Ax(Y))gox = ((T xg- 1 )-l(X), Ax(Y))x by invariance of (,) 
= wx(T xg- 1 )(X), Y) by definition of Ax 
= wgox (X, T xg(Y)) by invariance of w 
= (X, Agox 0 T xg(Y))gox. 
This shows that Agox 0 T xg = T xg 0 Ax, that is, that A is invariant. 
Examples. Once the orbits H).. of U(n) have been described as flag manifolds of 
en, they clearly have a natural additional structure: they are complex manifolds. 
As above, the complex diffeomorphism type depends only on the multiplicities. 
Let us describe the underlying almost complex structure. One can write u( n) = 
u(nI) EB··· EBu(nk) EBm where m is a complex vector space. One simply decomposes 

II.2. CALIBRATED ALMOST COMPLEX STRUCTURES

where Ai E u(ni) and Xi,j is a complex matrix. The complex structure on m is 
given by the complex structure of the spaces where the blocks Xi,j live, not by the 
complex structure of the space of big matrices: if 
x = (-~1'2 ~.1:2 ~.1:3 :::) Em

call j(X) the same matrix with each Xk,l replaced by iXk,l: this is the complex 
structure of m. Of course, m is not a Lie subalgebra of u(n), but 9 = u(nl) EB··· EB 
u(nk) is. 
Now m is a good representative of the tangent space to the homogeneous 
space U(n)jU(nI) x ... x U(nk) at the point image of Id E U(n), and it has 
a natural complex structure. Everything is invariant enough to define something 
on H)... 
Fix a diagonal matrix D = (J-LI,"" J-LI, .. ·, J-Lk,···, J-Lk) in the orbit H).. with 
J-LI < ... < J-Lk (so that the stabilizer of D is indeed U(nl) x ... x U(nk))' Any 
element in T dH).. can be written in a unique way as [X, D] for some X E m (the 
tangent space to the orbit is generated by fundamental vector fields, the uniqueness 
comes from the specification X E m, this subspace being a supplement of the Lie 
algebra of the stabilizer). 
Define now JD[X, D] = [j(X), D] in such a way that JD is a complex structure 
on T DH)... Let now h = gDg- I be any element in the orbit. Any element in T hH).. 
can be written uniquely (once 9 is chosen) as [gXg-l, h] with X E m. Put 
Jh [gXg-I,h] = [gj(X)g-l,h] 
thus defining an almost complex structure J on the orbit H)... This complex struc-
ture is calibrated by the symplectic form W, as is shown in Exercise 11.19. 
Kahler manifolds. Assume now that W is a complex manifold. That is to say, 
the almost complex structure J is the multiplication by i. Suppose that ( , ) is 
a Hermitian metric on W. Its imaginary part is a (type (1,1)) nondegenerate 2-
form w. If w is symplectic, that is to say, if it is closed, one says that the metric 
is Kahler. The manifold W endowed with this metric and with the form w is also 

58 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
called Kahler. By its very definition, the complex structure is calibrated by the 
Kahler form. Moreover, in a Kahler manifold, the symplectic volume form wAn In! 
associated with the Kahler form is also the Riemannian volume. 
Kahler manifolds are very common: any complex submanifold of a Kahler 
manifold is Kahler (for the induced (1, I)-form), thus all projective complex alge-
braic manifolds are Kahler-it suffices to prove that the projective space is, and 
it is (see Exercise H.21). 
11.3. Hamiltonian vector fields and Poisson brackets 
1I.3.a. Hamiltonian vector fields. Being nondegenerate, the symplectic form 
w defines a pairing between the tangent and cotangent spaces of W (already used 
in the proof of H.l.9). In particular, for any function H : W ---) R, there is a 
symplectic analogue of the gradient, namely a vector field XH defined by 
that is, by iXHW = -dH. We shall call X H the symplectic gradient of H or the 
Hamiltonian vector field associated with H. If X is the Hamiltonian vector field 
associated with a function H, we shall also say that H is a Hamiltonian for X. 
Remark IL 3. 1. As w is nondegenerate, the zeros of the vector field X H are precisely 
the critical points of the function H. 
ExampleIL3.2. Consider, on the symplectic manifold en with the standard (linear) 
symplectic structure, the function 
From

j=l

one gets 
Remark IL3.3. If J is an almost complex structure calibrated by w, and if grad 
denotes the gradient for the Riemannian metric w(JX, Y), then Xf = Jgradf. 
A vector field X on W will be said to be Hamiltonian if the I-form ixw is 
exact, locally Hamiltonian if this I-form is closed. One writes H(W) and H\oc(W) 
respectively for the spaces of Hamiltonian and locally Hamiltonian vector fields 
on W. 

II.3. HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND POISSON BRACKETS 
59 
II.3.b. The Poisson bracket. Assume now that Hand K are two functions 
on W. Their Poisson bracket {H, K} is the function defined by the formula 
{H,K} = X H · K = dK(XH). 
It follows from this definition that 
{H,K} = dK(XH) = W(XH,XK ) 
= -W(XK, XH) = -dH(XK ) 
= -XK·H = -{K,H}. 
The Poisson bracket is thus skew-symmetric in Hand K. This is also a derivation, 
this is to say that it satisfies the Leibniz identity: 
Using the general formula 
Lxiy - iyLx = i[x,Y] 
(see Exercise II.24) and the Cartan formula 
one gets 
Lx = dix + ixd, 
i[XH,XK]W = LXHiXKW - iXKLxHw 
= dixHiXKW + iXHdixKw - iXKdixHW - iXKixHdw 
= dixHiXKW = d(W(XK,XH)) = -d{H,K}, 
that is, the fact that 
[XH,XKJ = X{H,K}. 
Hence we also have, for any three functions j, g and h, 
From this, we shall deduce that the Poisson bracket also satisfies the Jacobi identity 
{j, {g, h}} + {g, {h, f}} + {h, {j, g}} = 0 
and thus that it defines the structure of a Lie algebra on eoo (W). Moreover, the 
mapping 
eOO(W) ----t X(W) 
H f----t XH 
is a morphism of Lie algebras from e'Xl (W) (endowed with the Poisson bracket) 
into the Lie algebra of the vector fields (endowed with the Lie bracket). 

60 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
Proof of the Jacobi identity. By definition of the Lie bracket of vector fields, one 
has 
[Xf,Xg]· h = X f · (Xg · h) - Xg · (Xf · h). 
Using the definition of the Poisson bracket and the previous inequality, one gets 
{{f,g},h} = [Xf,Xg]· h 
= X f . (Xg . h) - Xg . (Xf . h) 
= Xf· {g,h} - Xg · {f,h} 
= {j, {g, h}} - {g, {j, h}} , 
which is equivalent to the expected identity. 
D 
Remark IL3.4. 
The fact that the Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity is 
equivalent to the fact that the symplectic form is closed. This is one more good 
reason to insist that only closed 2-forms are symplectic. See Exercise I1.27. 
II.3.c. Poisson manifolds. More generally, a Poisson bracket on a manifold V 
is a Lie algebra structure, denoted { , }, on the vector space eOO(V) of functions, 
satisfying the Leibniz identity. This notion was first investigated by Lichnerow-
icz [97] and by Weinstein [130]. 
It is strictly larger than the notion of symplectic manifold. Here is a family 
of examples of Poisson manifolds which are not symplectic. 
The dual vector space to a Lie algebra. Let 9 be a Lie algebra and let 
g* be the dual vector space. Notice that, up to now, this is only a vector space. 
In particular, the Lie algebra structure of 9 defines no (canonical) Lie algebra 
structure on g*. What it does define is a canonical Poisson structure, created by 
Kirillov, Kostant and Souriau [84, 87, 123] and which I describe now. 
For f, 9 E eoo (g*) and ~ E g* one writes: 
where dh : T ~g* = g* ---) R is identified to an element of 9 (by biduality). The 
Jacobi identity for { , } is easily deduced from that for [,] in g. 
There is no reason why g* should be a symplectic manifold. For instance, 
nothing prevents its dimension from being odd. 
The perspicacious reader will already have realized that there is a relationship 
between this general construction and that of the symplectic form on 11>. in § II.I.d. 
There we have considered the Lie group G = U(n), its Lie algebra 9 = u(n), 
the dual being identified to 11 = iu(n) by the invariant inner product tr(XY). 
Modulo these identifications, the formal analogy with the definition of { , } is only a 
special case of a forthcoming result (see § II.3.c): the coadjoint orbits are symplectic 

II.3. HAMILTONIAN VECTOR FIELDS AND POISSON BRACKETS 
61 
submanifolds of g*, in the sense that, when restricted to any orbit, the Poisson 
bracket is the same as the one defined by the symplectic form of the orbit. 
Adjoint and coadjoint actions. As we have seen in the Appendix to Chap-
ter I, any Lie group G acts on its Lie algebra 9 through the adjoint action, the 
fundamental vector field 9X associated with X E 9 being 
9Xy = [X,Yj. 
To define the coadjoint action we merely have to transpose the adjoint G-action 
on g: 
(Ad;~,X) = (~,Adg-1X) 
where Greek letters denote elements of g*, Latin ones elements of g, and brackets 
duality. Thus Ad* is a (left) G-action on g*. Of course, the fundamental vector 
field on g* associated with X E 9 by the coadjoint action is defined by 
(9*~, Y) = (~, [Y,X]). 
Remark IL3.5. The principal orbits of the coadjoint representation of a compact 
connected Lie group have a maximal torus as stabilizer. 
Indeed, as the group G is compact, it is easy to define an invariant inner 
product on its Lie algebra g, and this allows us to identify 9 with its dual. The 
assertion is then equivalent to the fact that the stabilizer of any X E 9 for the 
adjoint representation contains a maximal torus. The infinitesimal analogue of this 
assertion-that is, the centralizer of any element in 9 contains the Lie algebra of 
a maximal torus-is an easy consequence of the fact that all adjoint orbits meet 
the Lie algebra of any maximal torus (see [25]): if X E t, its centralizer contains t. 
The symplectic form on the orbits. Just rewriting what we did for 1{).. 
in § H.l.d, one defines for any ~ E g* a skew-symmetric bilinear form on 9 by 
W~(X, Y) = (~, [X, Y]). 
Lemma II.3.6. The kernel of W~ is the Lie algebra g~ of the stabilizer of ~ E g* for 
the coadjoint representation. 
Proof Let X, Y E g. By the very definition of Ad*, we have: 
(Ad:xp( -tX) ~, Y) = (~, adexp( tX) Y). 
Differentiating at 0 with respect to t: 
(:t Ad:xp(_tX) ~It=o, Y) = (~, :t adexp(tx) Y) 
= (~, [X, Y]) = w~(X, Y). 
Thus the kernel of Wt; is g~. 
o 

62 
CHAPTER II. SYMPLECTIC MANIFOLDS 
In particular, w~ defines a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form on 
g/g~, a vector space of which we know (from §1.l.b) that it is identified with 
T ~ (G . ~) c g*. The proof that there exists a canonical symplectic structure on 
each coadjoint orbit, induced by the canonical Poisson structure of g*, proceeds 
exactly as the proof we have written for the orbits 1i).. in § I1.l.d (Exercise 11.29). 
The symplectic foliation. In general the Poisson bracket of a Poisson manifold 
W defines nothing on a submanifold V c W. If it defines a Poisson bracket, 
that is, if {I, g} Iv depends only on ilv and glv, then V is said to be a Poisson 
submanifold. If moreover, the restricted Poisson bracket on V can be defined by a 
symplectic form, then V is a symplectic submanifold. 
Now, any Poisson manifold has a symplectic foliation, a (singular) foliation 
the leaves of which are the maximal symplectic submanifolds. I will not discuss 
this in great generality, but refer the reader to [96] or [125] for instance. However, 
in the case of the dual g* of the Lie algebra of a group G, this is quite simple: the 
symplectic leaves are just the coadjoint orbits.

CHAPTER III 
SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN 
GROUP ACTIONS 
In this chapter, we define symplectic and Hamiltonian actions. These are the main 
topics of this book, so that we spend some time on their properties. Hamiltonian 
actions of tori of maximal dimension are a special case of integrable systems. We 
prove (this is the Arnold-Liouville theorem), that they are also the local form of 
all integrable systems with compact level sets. 
111.1. Hamiltonian group actions 
III. La. Symplectic actions. We have already said that a G-action on the sym-
plectic manifold (W, w) is symplectic if any element 9 of G defines a diffeomorphism 
which preserves w: 
g*w = w. 
Let us write now the infinitesimal version of this equality. Let X E 9 and let X be 
the associated fundamental vector field. Let gt be the flow of X. If we differentiate 
(with respect to the time t) the equation gtw = w, we get: 
LXW = dd g;wlt=o = o. 
-
t 
Thus the infinitesimal version of our equality is: 
v X E g, 
LXW = O. 
We use now both the Cartan formula 
LX = dix +ixd 
and the fact that w is closed, to get: 
dixw = o. 

72 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Proposition IlLJ.J. If the G-action preserves the symplectic form w, then all the 
fundamental vector fields of the action are locally Hamiltonian. 
D 
III.1.b. Hamiltonian actions. Consider now the following diagram. 
eOO(W)~ ... 
IL ....... g 
1 
1 
H(W) ----+ Hloc(W) ----* Hl(W; R) ----* 0 
One says that the symplectic G-action on W is Hamiltonian if there exists a 
morphism Ji of Lie algebras g -t eoo (W) making the diagram commute. It follows 
in particular that the fundamental vector fields of the action are then Hamiltonian. 
Remarks IlLJ.] 
(1) If the group is connected, we know (see Proposition 1.4.5) that each of its 
elements is a product of exponentials 
9 = expX1 expX2 ·· ·expXn 
and thus the existence of IL, which always implies the infinitesimal "sym-
plecticity" of the action, implies that here the action is actually symplectic. 
It is thus useless to require that the action is symplectic: this will be a 
consequence of the existence of the map 11. 
(2) Some authors, among them some of the best ones (for instance Souriau, who 
was one of the inventors of Hamiltonian actions(1) [123]' see also [96]), call 
Hamiltonian an action for which there exists a map Ji making the diagram 
commute, without requiring that IL is a Lie algebra morphism. Suppose 
that X 1--+ Jix is only a map from g to eOO(W). Then Jix is a function 
the symplectic gradient field of which is X, in particular {Ji x, Jiy} is a 
Hamiltonian for [X, Y]. Thus it is always true that {Jix,Jid - Ji[X,Y] is 
(locally) constant on W. We are just assuming, in our definition, that the 
constant vanishes. 
(3) To finish with remarks, note that if G is commutative and W compact (the 
case we are mainly interested in), any lift Ji is automatically a Lie algebra 
morphism: the Lie bracket in g is trivial thus {Jix, Jiy} is locally constant. 
The function Jix must have a critical point on W, which we assumed to be 
compact, thus there exists a point at which {Jix, Jiy} vanishes, and so it is 
zero everywhere.

The momentum mapping. Associated with Ii is the momentum mapping: 
f-l: W ------7 g* = Hom (g, R) 
x f----------7 (X ~ Ii x ( x ) ) . 
Then the fundamental vector field X is the Hamiltonian vector field of the func-
tion x ~ (f-l(x) , X). The fact that Ii is a morphism of Lie algebras gives, for the 
momentum mapping f-l: 
Proposition IlLl.3. The momentum mapping f-l : W ~ g* is a Poisson mapping. 
Proof We want to prove that, for any two maps f, 9 : g* ~ R and any point x of 
the manifold W, one has 
(using, as usual, the same notation for the Poisson bracket on Wand that on the 
dual of the Lie algebra g*). By density of polynomials in eoo functions, it is enough 
to prove this for two polynomials f and g. Using the Leibniz rule, we can even 
assume that f and 9 are linear functions on g*, that is, f = X E g, 9 = Y E g. 
For such an f, the Hamiltonian vector field of the composed map f 0 f-l is 
defined by 
wx(Z,XjOJl ) = (df)Jl(x)Txf-l(Z) 
= (Txf-l(Z),X), 
so that XjOJl = X and XgOJl = Y. We have now 
{fo f-l,g 0 f-l} (x) =wx(Xx,Yx) 
= (Txf-l(Xx) , y) 
= (X Jl(x) , Y) 
as above. On the other hand, 
as well. 
o 
The definition of a Hamiltonian action can be reformulated in terms of the 
map f-l instead of Ii. The condition that lix is a Hamiltonian for the fundamental 
vector field X translates into a condition on the tangent mapping 
T xf-l : T xW ------7 g* 
Y f----------7 T x f-l (Y) , 
namely 
\:j X E g, 
(T xf-l(Y), X) = -ixw(Y) = w(Y, X). 

74 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Example IIL1.4. If H : W --t R is any function and if the Hamiltonian vector field 
XH is complete, its flow defines a Hamiltonian R-action, the momentum mapping 
of which is H. 
Example IILl.5. More generally, let H1, ... , Hk be k commuting functions (in 
the sense that {Hi, Hj } = 0 for all i, j) on a symplectic manifold W. Assume 
that, for some reason (for instance because W is compact), the flows CPI,···, CPk 
of their Hamiltonian vector fields are complete). Then, these flows determine a 
Hamiltonian Rk-action with momentum mapping 
M= (H1, ... ,Hk): W ~Rk. 
This is true because the vector fields X H1 , • .. , X Hk commute 
so that the flows CPI, ... , CPk commute. 
Tori. Suppose that W is compact and the group is a torus T. Choose a basis 
X 1, ... , X k of t. The existence of the momentum mapping is equivalent to that of 
a primitive JiXi of iXiW for any i. It is thus sufficient, in order to define Ji, to write 
k 
k 
Jix = LAiJiXi for X = LAiXi. 
i=1 
i=1 
Assume for instance that H1(W; R) = 0 (for example because W is simply con-
nected). Then any symplectic T-action is Hamiltonian. The momentum mapping 
M is then well-defined up to the addition of a constant vector of t*.

!II.l. HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS

One should notice that the image of f-L is the "first quadrant" , namely the subset of 
Rn defined by (Xl;? 0, ... ,Xn ;? 0), a fact which is not unrelated with the convex 
polyhedra we shall encounter in the next chapter. 
Semisimple groups. If the Lie algebra 9 is generated by the Lie brackets of its 
elements, namely if 9 = [g, g], all the symplectic G-actions are Hamiltonian(2). It 
is not hard to see (Exercise II.25) that, if X and Yare two locally Hamiltonian 
vector fields, then the vector field [X, Y] is globally Hamiltonian. But, if 9 satisfies 
9 = [g, g], any element of 9 may be written as a sum of brackets, and thus defines 
a fundamental vector field which is globally Hamiltonian. This is the case, for 
example, for the groups G = SO(3) or SU(2) (see Exercise I.19). 
Let us go back to the general case. The momentum f-L was defined by a 
map fi : 9 --+ eoo (W) such that the function fix is a primitive of the I-form 
ixw. Hence, the momentum mapping is not a priori unique. One can add locally 
constant functions c x such that 
fi[x,y] + C[X,Y] = {fix + Cx, fiy + cy} = {fix, fiy} = fi[x,y] 
(that is c vanishes on [g, g]) to fix. Thus f-L is defined up to the addition of a 
constant linear form in the annihilator [g,g]O of [g,g]. For instance, as we have 
already said, in the case where the group G is commutative, any constant will do. 
However, if Gis semisimple, the momentum mapping, if it exists, is unique. 
Notice that there is a simple procedure to construct examples of momentum 
mappings. 
Proposition IIL1.8. 
Let f-L be the momentum mapping for the Hamiltonian action 
of a Lie group G on a symplectic manifold W. Then, for any Lie subgroup H of 
G, the composition of f-L and the canonical projection: 
W~g*~f)* 
is a momentum mapping for the induced action. 
D 
III.1.c. The coadjoint representation of a Lie group. The dual-of-a-Lie-
algebra-coadjoint-action machinery can be used to produce examples. 
The canonical momentum mapping. Let G . ~ be a coadjoint orbit in g*. We 
thus have a Lie group G acting on a symplectic manifold G· ~ and (obviously!) pre-
serving the symplectic form. Everything is so canonical that the following propo-
sition is almost tautological: 
(2) Compact Lie groups the Lie algebra of which satisfy 9 = [g, gJ are said to be semisimple, see 
Exercise 1.19. 

76 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Proposition IILl.9. 
The inclusion G . ~ c g* is a momentum mapping for the 
G-action on its orbit. 
Proof. We want to check that the inclusion J.l : G . ~ --+ g* satisfies the relation 
(T~J.l(Y),X) =w~(Y,X) 
for all tangent vectors Y to G . ~. The tangent space to the orbit is generated by 
the fundamental vector fields, so that the relation we want to prove is just 
(9*~, Y) = (~, [Y, X]), 
but this is exactly the relation defining the fundamental vector field on g*. 
D 
This construction generates a lot of examples, using Proposition II1.1.8. For 
instance we have seen (Remark 11.3.5) that the type of the principal coadjoint 
orbits is the conjugacy class of any maximal torus. It is thus especially interesting 
to study the action of a fixed maximal torus T c G on these orbits(3). We deduce 
a lot of examples of torus actions on symplectic manifolds. .. thus, even if one is 
only interested in commutative groups, this excursion into noncommutativity was 
not useless. 
The case of U(n). Let us make the torus of diagonal unitary matrices act on the 
orbits 'Ii)... 
Proposition IILl.lO. The map 'Ii).. --+ Rn, which associates with any Hermitian 
matrix its diagonal entries, is a momentum mapping for the T -action. 
Proof. According to Propositions II1.1.8 and II1.1.9, the momentum mapping is 
the composition 
'Ii).. C 'Ii = u(n)* ~ 
t*, 
for the map u(n)* --+ t* defined by the inclusion T C U(n). Now, T is the subgroup 
of diagonal (in the canonical basis of Cn ) unitary matrices, hence t* is isomorphic 
to Rn and the projection is indeed the mapping that maps a matrix to its diagonal 
entries. 
D 
Example/II.J.ll. 
Let A = (Al,A2, ... ,A2). We have seen in §11.l.d that 'Ii).. is 
a complex projective space pn-l(C). We have thus exhibited a Hamiltonian Tn_ 
action on the complex projective space pn-l(C). 
(3) For instance, the fixed points will be the points in the orbit the stabilizer of which is precisely 
T and not one of its conjugates. 

III.2. PROPERTIES OF MOMENTUM MAPPINGS

The case of 80(3). The Lie algebra 50(3) is the Lie algebra of 3 x 3 skew-
symmetric matrices. Identify it with R3 in such a way that the Lie bracket be-
comes the vector cross product and with its dual 50(3)* with help of the canonical 
Euclidean structure of R 3 . The adjoint and coadjoint actions are then identified 
with the usual action of 80(3) on R3 by rotations (see, if necessary, Exercise I.16). 
The coadjoint orbits are thus the point 0 and the concentric spheres 82's (with 
stabilizer 80(2)). We choose the third vector of the canonical basis, its orbit is 
Figure 1 
the unit sphere, the corresponding maximal "torus" is simply a circle that acts by 
rotations about the z-axis and the momentum mapping is just the Hamiltonian 
(x, y, z) I-t z. We merely copy here a figure that already appeared in Chapter I. 
Notice that the quotient map there is our momentum mapping here, a special case 
of a more general result (Exercise IV.12). 
111.2. Properties of momentum mappings 
11I.2.a. Fixed points. A momentum mapping J1, is a map from our manifold W 
into the vector space g*. We will use it to investigate the group action. Here is a 
simple example of what can be expected of such a situation. 
Proposition IIL2.1. Let W be a compact symplectic manifold endowed with an 
action of 8 1 . Assume the action is Hamiltonian. Then it has fixed points. 
Proof A momentum mapping for an 8 1-action is simply a function 
H: W ----*R. 
The manifold being compact, any function on it must have critical points. Let 
x be such a point, namely x is such that (dH)x = 0, and hence, such that the 
Hamiltonian vector field X H vanishes at x. But the latter is the fundamental 
vector field associated with the action. Thus, x is a fixed point. 
0 
Think of the situation depicted in Figure 1, where the fixed points of the 8 1_ 
action are the extrema of the momentum mapping. Notice that there are symplectic 

78 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
8 1-actions without fixed points. For instance, rotations on one factor 8 1 on the 
torus 8 1 x 8 1, namely the formula 
t· (x, y) = (t . x, y) 
defines a symplectic action (which is not Hamiltonian). 
III.2.h. The tangent map. The tangent map 
T xJL : T x W ------t g* 
is, by definition, the transpose of 
ty xJL : 9 ------t T~W 
X f-----+ (ixw)x. 
In particular, its image 1m T xJL is the annihilator in g* of Ker ty xJL, that is, the 
annihilator of 
{x E 9 I (iXw)x = o} = {X E 9 I Xx = o} = gx· 
Proposition IIL2.2. The annihilator in g* of gx is the subspace 1m T xJL. Dually, the 
annihilator in 9 of 1m T xJL C g* is gx. 
D 
Thus the rank of T xJL is the dimension of the orbit of x. We deduce, in 
particular: 
Proposition IIL2.3. 
The momentum mapping JL is a submersion at the point x if 
and only if the stabilizer Gx is discrete. 
Proof This property is indeed equivalent to the nullity of gx. 
D 
Corollary IIL2.4. 
Let G be a commutative Lie group acting in an effective way 
on a symplectic manifold W. Assume the action is Hamiltonian with momentum 
mapping JL : W -+ g*. Then JL is a submersion on the open dense subset of principal 
orbits in W. 
Proof We already know that the stabilizer of the principal orbits is the (discrete) 
subgroup {I} c G. 
D 
If G is not commutative, it may happen that the momentum mapping JL is 
nowhere submersive, even if the action is effective, as the next example shows. 
Example IIL2.5. Let the group SO(3) of rotations act on 8 2 x W by the usual 
(effective) action on 8 2 and by the trivial action on W. It preserves any "product" 
symplectic form W1 EB W2, and the image of the momentum mapping 
JL: 82 X W ------t 50(3)* = R3 
is a sphere 8 2 (and, in particular, contains no open dense subset of 50(3)*) so that 
JL is nowhere submersive.

Proposition IlL2.6. 
The kernel Ker T xJ.l is the orthogonal (for wx) of the tangent 
space to the orbit through x. 
Proof This is straightforward, T xJ.l(Y) is zero if and only if (T xJ.l(Y) , X) = 0 for 
all vectors X E £I, that is, if and only if wx(Xx, Y) = 0 for all X, that is, if and only 
if Y is orthogonal to the subspace generated by the fundamental vector fields. 
D 
III.2.c. Noether theorem. We consider now the "levels" of the momentum 
mapping(4) J.l : W -+ £1* of a Hamiltonian G-action on the symplectic manifold 
(W, w). The most classical form of Noether's theorem seems to be stated nowadays 
as follows: 
Theorem IlL2. 7. Let H be a function on W which is invariant under the G-action. 
Then J.l is constant on the trajectories of the Hamiltonian vector field X H. 
Proof Indeed, if "'((t) is a trajectory of X H, one can write, for any X E £I: 
d 
dt(J.l0"'((t),X) = (Ty(t)J.l(XH("'((t))),X) 
= (XH("'((t)), ~,(t)J.l(X)) 
= (XH("'((t)), (ixw),(t)) 
= w(X,XH),(t) 
= -dH,(t) (X). 
But the Hamiltonian H is invariant and X is a fundamental vector field of the 
action, so that 
H(exp(sX) . "'((t)) = H("'((t)) 
a relation which, when differentiated at s = 0, gives 
dH(X("'((t))) = O. 
D 
Notice that this theorem means that the Hamiltonian vector field X H is 
tangent to the levels J.l-1(~) of the momentum mapping. 
Example IlL 2. 8 (Periodic Hamiltonians). Even the most trivial cases of the previous 
theorem are already interesting. Consider for instance the case where the group 
acting is Sl and the function is the very momentum mapping of this action. We 
get that the fundamental vector field is tangent to the hypersurfaces of constant 
"energy" H. 
Such a function is called a periodic Hamiltonian. We see that all the regular 
levels of a periodic Hamiltonian are oriented submanifolds endowed with a fixed 
point free Sl-action. For example in dimension 4, the regular levels are Seifert 
(4)1 shall call level ~ the inverse image J.L-l(~) of an element~, even if ~ is not a number.

CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
manifolds. We shall see later how it is possible to use the constructions of Chapter I 
to investigate periodic Hamiltonians. 
III.2.d. Equivariant momentum mappings. The momentum mapping JL 
maps the G-manifold W into another G-manifold g*. It is thus natural to ask 
whether this is an equivariant map. 
Proposition IlL 2. 9. 
Let JL be the momentum mapping for the Hamiltonian action 
of the connected group G on the symplectic manifold W. Then JL is an equivariant 
map. 
Proof We consider an element X of 9 and we prove 
(w 
_ g* 
TxJL 
Xx) -
X/l(x) , 
that is, the infinitesimal version of the proposition (this will be enough, because 
the group is connected). Thanks to the relation defining the fundamental vector 
fields of the coadjoint action, we have, on the one hand 
and on the other hand 
(g*X /l(x) , Y) = (JL(X) , [Y, Xl) 
= -ji[X,Y] (x), 
(T xJL(wXx), Y) = (WXX, t-r xJL(Y)) 
= (WXX, (iwrw)x) 
= wx(wY, wX) 
= -{jix,jiy}(x) 
= -ji[X,Y] (x). 
Hence the two sides are equal. 
o 
This endows Hamiltonian actions with very specific properties. For exam-
ple, Proposition III.2.9 forces the inclusion of stabilizers Gx C G/l(x). Here is an 
example: 
Proposition IIL2.10. 
Let W be a symplectic manifold endowed with a nontrivial 
symplectic action of G = 80(3) or 8U(2). Then the stabilizer of the principal 
orbits is a commutative subgroup of G. 
Proof We have seen in § III.l.b that, because G is semisimple, the action is Hamil-
tonian. Let J-t : W ----+ g* be the (unique) momentum mapping for this action. Let x 
be a point in W. Then we have the inclusion Gx C G/l(x) and the orbit stabilizers 
in g* are either G or the circle 80(2) C 80(3) or 8U(2) (see § UI.l.c). If G x is not 
contained in 80(2), we have G/l(x) = G, or JL(x) = o. If this was the case for all 

III.2. PROPERTIES OF MOMENTUM MAPPINGS 
81 
the points of the principal orbits, J.l would vanish on an open dense subset of W, 
thus everywhere. But the operation would then be trivial. 
D 
In the same way, one can show more generally (using Remark II.3.5) that, if 
J.l is a submersion at at least one point, then "the" stabilizer of the principal orbits 
is commutative and discrete. 
III.2.e. Level sets. Let us return to the general case. For a regular value ~ E g* 
of J.l, call ~ = J.l-l(~). As J.l is equivariant, the subgroup G~ c G keeps the set V~ 
invariant: if x E ~ and 9 E G~, then 
J.l(g. x) = g. J.l(x) = g. ~ =~. 
Look now at what happens to the symplectic form when we restrict it by the 
inclusion map j~ : ~ C W: 
Lemma IIL2.11. 
The kernel of the pulled back 2-form jtw at a point x is the 
subspace Tx(G~ . x). The rank of this 2-form is constant (namely, it does not 
depend on x) and 
rkJrw = 2 dim ~ + dim(G·~) - dim W. 
Proof We have, by definition, 
Ker(jE"w)x = TxV~ n (TxV~t. 
On the other hand, T x V~ = Ker T xJ.l and we have (this is Proposition III.2.6) that 
KerT xJ.l = (T x(G· x)t. 
Thus 
Ker(jtw)x = KerT xJ.l n T x(G· x). 
The tangent space T x(G . x) to the orbit is generated by the fundamental vector 
fields wx. According to the proof of Proposition III.2.9, X x is in Ker T xJ.l if and 
only if the corresponding fundamental vector field in g* vanishes at J.l(x) , that 
is, if and only if X belongs to the Lie algebra gJL(x) of the stabilizer GJL(x). Thus 
Ker(jt w ) x is generated by the fundamental vector fields coming from g~. Hence 
Ker(jtw)x = Tx(G~· x), its dimension is 
dim G~ - dim Gx = dim G~ 
(because ~ is a regular value so that Gx is discrete). Its rank is 
rk(Hw)x = dim V~ -
(dimG~ - dimGx ) 
= dim ~ - dim G~ + dim G - dim W + dim ~ 
, 
" 
v 
dimG·~ 
= 2 dim ~ - dim W + dim G . ~ 
and thus is constant on V~. 
D 

82 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
These results allow us to characterize the Hamiltonian actions of Abelian 
groups. 
Proposition IIL2.12. 
Let G be a connected Lie group acting effectively on a sym-
plectic manifold W with momentum mapping J.£. The three following properties are 
equivalent. 
(1) The orbits of G are isotropic. 
(2) The momentum mapping J.£ is constant on the orbits. 
(3) The group G is commutative. 
In this case, dim W ~ 2 dim G. 
Proof The orbit G . x is isotropic if and only if 
In this case, for any X, Y E g, the map 
x f------+ -wx(Xx, Y x) 
is identically zero. But we have seen (in Exercise 1I.25) that its differential is the 
I-form ilK,Ylw, Thus ilK,Xjw = 0, from which it follows that [X, Y] = 0 and, 
due to the fact that the fundamental vector field of the bracket is the bracket of 
fundamental vector fields (see §I.l.b), that [X, Y] = 0 for any X, Y E G, so that 
G is commutative. 
Reciprocally, if G is commutative, Ge = G for all e in g* and thus Ker Hw is 
the whole tangent space to the orbit which is thus isotropic. 
D 
The inequality in III.2.12 is easily generalized. 
Proposition IIL2.13. Let W be a symplectic manifold endowed with a Hamiltonian 
action of a compact connected Lie group G, with momentum mapping J.£ : W -+ g*. 
Let T be a maximal torus in G. If J.£ is submersive in at least one point in W, then 
dimG + dimT ~ dim W. 
Proof It is sufficient to observe that the rank of (j;w)x is a nonnegative integer, 
and to compute: 
rkj;w = 2 dim Ve - dim W + dimG· ~ 
= 2(dim W - dim G) - dim W + dimG· ~ 
= dim W - 2dimG +dimG - dimGe. 
Hence dim W ~ dim G + dim Ge ~ dim G + dim T, thanks to Remark 1I.3.5. 
D 
For example a manifold endowed with a symplectic SO(3)-action the mo-
mentum mapping of which is submersive somewhere has dimension at least 4. 

III.2. PROPERTIES OF MOMENTUM MAPPINGS 
83 
The hypothesis "submersion at one point" is necessary: for example the SO(3)-
action on the unit sphere S2 by isometries preserves the volume form and is thus 
symplectic. 
11I.2.f. Symplectic reduction, examples. The essence of what is called sym-
plectic reduction is contained in a rather obvious algebraic lemma. Recall that 
we call coisotropic any vector subspace (resp. submanifold) of a symplectic vector 
space (resp. manifold) the symplectic orthogonal of which is isotropic: FeE is 
coisotropic if and only if Fa c F. 
Lemma IIL2.14 (Symplectic reduction). 
Let E be a vector space endowed with a 
(constant) symplectic form w. Let F be a coisotropic subspace. 
(1) The form w induces a symplectic form on FIFo. 
(2) If L is any isotropic subspace transversal to F, then the composite map 
L n F c F ---t FIFo is the inclusion of an isotropic subspace. 
Proof The subspace Fa is, by definition, the kernel of the restriction of w to F. 
Hence the first assertion. For the second one, we just have to check that (L n F) n 
Fa = {O}, but we have 
(L n F) n Fa = L n Fa = (La + F)O c (L + F)O = {O}. 
0 
Straightaway, we have an application. Consider a torus T acting effectively 
on a compact symplectic manifold (W, w) with momentum mapping J.L : W ---t t*. 
We know that in this case there must exist regular values. Let e be such a value. 
For x E V~, we have 
TxVe = KerTxJ.L = (Tx(T· xW· 
Moreover, the tangent space to the orbit, being generated by fundamental vector 
fields, is isotropic since T is commutative (Proposition 111.2.12). Thus T x Ve is 
coisotropic and its orthogonal is the tangent space to the orbit. Hence Wx induces 
a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form on T x V~ IT x (T . x). 
The T -action on W defines by restriction aT-action on the level V~, of 
which we know that all its stabilizers are finite, as T xJ.L is surjective thus t* is the 
annihilator of tx ' 
If moreover all these stabilizers are trivial, in other words if the T-action on 
the regular level V~ is free, then the quotient VeIT is a manifold B~ (of dimension 
dim W - 2 dim T) and T x V~ IT x (T . x) may be identified to its tangent space at 
the point [xl = T· x. 
Proposition IIL2.15. Let the torus T act on the symplectic manifold W, with mo-
mentum mapping J.L : W ---t t*. Assume it acts freely on the regular level v~ of J.L. 
Then the orbit space Ve IT is a manifold naturally endowed with a symplectic form 
a~ called the reduced symplectic form. 

84 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Proof The form defined by Wx on T x ~ IT x (T . x) does not depend on the point 
x we chose in the orbit T· x, thanks to the invariance of w. The diagram 
defines a 2-form 1Jt:, by P~IJt:, = jEw. From which it follows that p~dlJt:, = 0 and that 
1Jt:, is closed. 
D 
Let G be a (not necessarily commutative) Lie group. Consider a Hamiltonian 
action with momentum mapping 
J-L: W ------+ g*. 
Let ~ be a regular value of J-L and Gt:, its stabilizer (for the coadjoint action). 
According to Proposition 111.2.6, the 2-form induced by jEw is nondegenerate on 
J-L-1(~)/Gt:,. So that we have: 
Proposition IIL2.16. Let the Lie group G act on the symplectic manifold W, with 
momentum mapping J-L : W -. g*. Assume ~ is a regular value of J-L the stabilizer 
Gt:, of which acts freely on the regular level J-L-1~. Then the orbit space J-L- 1(O/Gt:, 
is a manifold naturally endowed with a symplectic form 1Jt:,. 
D 
Corollary IIL2.17. Assume 0 is a regular value of the momentum mapping J-L and 
G acts freely on J-L- 1(O). Then J-L- 1(O)/G is a manifold naturally endowed with a 
symplectic form. 
D 
Example IIL2.18 (Symplectic form on the complex projective space). Consider the 
Sl-action on Cn by multiplication t· (Zl, ... , zn) = (tz1, ... , tzn). This is a Hamil-
tonian action with momentum mapping 
as follows, for instance, using Example 111.1. 7 and Proposition 111.1.8, from the 
fact that the projection map Rn -. R induced by the diagonal inclusion Sl -. Tn 
is the map 
(Xl, ... ,Xn ) f--------+ Xl + ... + xn . 
All nonzero real numbers are regular values of J-L. Choose any such value a > O. 
The level J-L-1(a) is the sphere of radius ffa. The quotient by the Sl-action is 
the projective space pn-1(C). The symplectic reduction procedure provides a 
symplectic form (for each value of a) on this projective space. 

III.2. PROPERTIES OF MOMENTUM MAPPINGS 
85 
Symplectic orbifolds. In general, the torus action may well have exceptional 
(that is, with finite stabilizer) orbits in regular levels. It is then no longer absolutely 
correct that the orbit space Bt; is a symplectic manifold. We have already met 
this kind of problem in § L3.c, where the topological structure of the quotient Bt; 
happened to be enough for what we needed. Now we have to look carefully at what 
is preserved of the differentiable structure near the singular points in order to be 
able to speak of a symplectic form on the quotient. 
The right notion here is that of orbifold, invented by Satake [120] under the 
name of V-manifold. The idea of a symplectic form on an orbifold was made pre-
cise by Weinstein in [129]. Since then, symplectic orbifolds (and the way the type 
of techniques explained in this book extend to them) have been extensively inves-
tigated by numerous authors, among which are Prato (unpublished) and Lerman 
and Tolman [95]. 
Locally, orbifolds are the open subsets of the quotient spaces R n Ir, where 
r is a finite group equipped with a representation P in GL(n,R), the fixed point 
set of which has codimension at least 2. The local isomorphisms UI --t U2 are the 
pairs (<p,,/,), where,/,: r l --t r 2 is a group homomorphism and <p : UI --t U2 is a 
diffeomorphism of the saturated open subsets of Rn, over UI and U2 , and all the 
diagrams 
<p 
-
UI ----t U2 
PI (g) r r 
P2 (g) 
are commutative. 
We call orbifold a topological space modeled on the local structure just de-
scribed. A differential form on an orbifold is of course given by the prescription, 
on each open local chart U, of a differential form (that is, a r-invariant differential 
form on U). A symplectic form is a 2-form, which, in each local chart, is closed 
(this is a local notion!) and nondegenerate. 
Example IIL2.19. The cyclic group r = Z I m acts by rotations on R 2 . Then R 2 Ir 
is an orbifold. The surfaces B, quotients of Seifert manifolds by their SI-action, 
that we have discussed in § L3.c are orbifolds. See also Exercises HLl7 and HLl8 
and the orbifolds shown in Figure 6 (page 101). 
Proposition IIL2.20. Let Vt; be a regular level of the map IL : W --t t*. The orbit 
space Bt; = Vt; IT is an orbifold, naturally endowed with a reduced symplectic 
form a~. 

86 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Proof The symplectic reduction lemma (Lemma III.2.14) asserts that, for any 
point x, the bilinear form Wx induces a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear 
form on the quotient space 
TxVdTx(T· x) = Ex· 
The latter is a slice at x for the T-action on V~. A neighborhood of T . x in V~ 
has the form T XTx Ex. Thus a neighborhood of x in B~ has the form Ex/Tx. 
Now Tx is a finite group of isomorphisms of Ex, and we may assume that it 
preserves a complex structure (calibrated by the form induced from wx ), so that 
the (co-) dimension of its fixed point set is even. If the codimension is positive, it 
is then greater than or equal to 2. 
D 
Example IIL2.21. Let H be a periodic Hamiltonian on a compact 4-dimensional 
symplectic manifold. Its regular levels are Seifert manifolds, with oriented topo-
logical surfaces as base spaces (one should check that symplectic orbifolds are 
oriented). We shall see in Chapter VIII that all the Seifert manifolds we have met 
in § I.3.c appear in this framework. 
Poisson structures on quotient spaces. Assume that the group G acts on the 
symplectic manifold Wand that the quotient WIG is a manifold. Of course, there 
is no reason why this quotient should be symplectic. However, if we assume that 
the G-action is Hamiltonian, there is something left from the symplectic structure, 
as asserted by the next proposition, a rather useful result that we shall have the 
opportunity to use in Chapter V. 
Proposition IlL 2. 22. Let G be a Lie group acting on a symplectic manifold W with 
momentum mapping 
J.t: W ----t g*. 
The Poisson bracket of W defines a Poisson bracket on W /G the symplectic leaves 
of which are in one-to-one correspondence, via J.t, with the coadjoint orbits of G 
in the image J.t(W) C g*. 
Proof The Poisson bracket of two functions f, 9 : W /G -+ R is defined by 
{f, g} = {f 0 7r, go 7r} where 7r is the projection W -----+ W /G. 
Let ~ E g* and G . ~ be its orbit. Endow G . ~ with the opposite of its standard 
symplectic form and consider G acting on W x G . ~ diagonally, so that 
J : W x G", ----t g* 
(x,'T}) ~ 
J.t(x)-'T} 
is the momentum mapping of the action. Perform the symplectic reduction of 
W x G . ~ at the level 0 of J, getting a symplectic structure on J-1(O)/G. The

87 
mapping 
J- 1(O)/G = {(x, 17) E W x G· ~ I J.l(X) = 17} /G ---> J.l-l(G· ~)/G 
is an isomorphism, and this puts a symplectic structure on the latter space. 
D 
Example IIL2.23. Look once again at the standard SI-action on C n+1 . When 
restricted to cn+l - {O}, this is a free action. The quotient Cn+1 - {O} /SI is a 
manifold, foliated by the projective spaces J.l-l(a)/SI (a > 0). We know that all 
these leaves are symplectic manifolds (Example III.2.18 above). The proposition 
asserts that this foliation is the symplectic foliation associated with a Poisson 
structure on the quotient. 
111.3. Torus actions and integrable systems 
III.3.a. Integrable systems. Consider a Hamiltonian torus action on a sym-
plectic manifold, with momentum mapping J.l : W --t R k. Assume the action is 
effective. We know that, in this case, 2k ~ dim W = 2n (Proposition III.2.12). 
Consider the maximal case, namely the case where the dimension of the torus 
acting is half the dimension of the manifold (k = n). Look at the n component 
functions of the momentum mapping 
They are independent over the open dense subset of regular points of J.l and they 
commute in the sense that 
We will call, more generally, completely integrable system or, more simply, in-
tegrable system, a collection of n independent (in the sense above) commuting 
functions defined over a symplectic manifold of dimension 2n. 
Notice that, by definition, the momentum mapping of an effective Hamilto-
nian torus action on a symplectic manifold of the right dimension is an integrable 
system. This is why we will call completely integrable the Hamiltonian action of a 
torus on a symplectic manifold of dimension double (of that of the torus). Notice 
however that any nonconstant function on a surface is an integrable system-so 
that there are many completely integrable systems that do not come from inte-
grable torus actions. 
Why is this called a "system"? This is because one thinks of the differential 
(Hamiltonian) system defined by one of the Hamiltonian vector fields, X h' say, 
namely 
x(t) = Xfl (x(t)). 

88 
CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
The other functions are then playing an auxiliary role. As {Ii, III = 0, they will 
be constant along the trajectories of X h -and thus said to be first integrals of the 
vector field X h . 
Remark III.3.1. Although it gives a symmetric role to all the h's, the present 
definition is certainly not the best possible. Very often, one is only interested 
in the subalgebra of eoo (W) generated by the h's and not in a specific set of 
generators. For a formally better definition, see, for instance, [126]. 
Example IIL3.2 (The simple pendulum). The simple pendulum is the mechanical 
system constituted by a bob at the end of a rope the other end of which is fixed, 
in a constant gravitation field (Figure 2). It is considered that the bob stays in 
a vertical plane. Call 0 the angle between the rope and the vertical (this is the 
direction of the gravitation field r). The differential equation describing the motion 
of the bob is jj = - sinO. The phase space is SI x R (a symplectic manifold as 
ri I 
r 
Figure 2. The simple pendulum 
the cotangent bundle T*SI). We use a real variable q (such that 0 is q modulo 271") 
and the dual variable p = q. The differential equation is equivalent to the system 
q =p, 
jJ = - sinq. 
The vector field X(q,p) = (p, - sinq) is the Hamiltonian vector field associated 
with the function H = ~p2 - cosq = ~p2 - cosO (this is the total energy of the 
simple pendulum). 
There are numerous beautiful examples of integrable systems (see, for exam-
ple, [15, 18]). The aim of this section is to prove that, near a compact connected 
component of a regular level of an integrable system, there is a Hamiltonian torus 
action with the same levels. This is the Arnold-Liouville theorem. 
III.3.b. The Arnold-Liouville theorem. We consider an integrable system, 
namely a symplectic manifold (W, w) of dimension 2n and a map I : W ---t R n the 
components II, ... , In of which are independent and commute. 

III.3. TORUS ACTIONS AND INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS 
89 
The local Rn-action. Let Xl, ... , Xn denote the Hamiltonian vector fields as-
sociated with the Ii's. They commute 
and define an Rn-action by 
t· x = rp;n 0 rp~n~{ 0 ···0 rpi" (x) 
where rpi denotes the flow of Xi and t = (tl, ... , tn ) E Rn belongs to a neigh-
borhood of 0, in such a way that rp;i is defined. This action is locally free at any 
regular point, since the fundamental vector fields are independent. 
Completeness. Assume now that the vector fields Xi are complete, namely that 
the flows rp~ are defined for all real numbers t. What we have now is a locally free 
Rn-action on the open subset ofregular points in W. Notice that this preserves the 
levels of I, because the Hamiltonian vector fields Xi are tangent to these levels. 
The connected components of the regular levels of I are homogeneous spaces, 
quotients of Rn by discrete subgroups. The discrete subgroups of Rn are the 
lattices Zk in the k-dimensional linear subspaces. The connected components of 
the regular levels must thus be of the form Rn-k x Tk for some k such that 
o ~ k ~ n. 
Liouville tori. The compact connected components of the regular levels are thus 
tori Tn and these tori are Lagrangian. We have thus proved the first assertion of 
Arnold-Liouville's theorem. 
Theorem IlL3.3 (The Arnold-Liouville theorem [5]). 
Let f I, ... , f n be n inde-
pendent commuting functions on a symplectic manifold (W,w) of dimension 2n. 
A ny compact connected component of a regular level of (II, ... , f n) is a La-
grangian torus. Such a torus has a neighborhood on which there are coordinates

In these coordinates, the Hamiltonian system associated with Ij tS 
The coordinates Ji are the action coordinates, while the rpi'S are the angle 
coordinates. The rest of this chapter is devoted to the proof of this theorem (cum 
commento).

CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Remark IIL3.4. The Arnold-Liouville theorem is proved in [5] (an early 1970s 
book), where it is attributed to Liouville, who certainly did not even state it. Hence, 
probably following Arnold's theory (according to which a theorem is given the 
name of the last person who proves it), it is called the Arnold-Liouville theorem. 
The statement and a sketch of a proof were also given by Mineur [110], who 
committed what is called in French a plagiat par anticipation [92]. For the history 
of this theorem, see [127]. 
Torus action and action variables. The regular levels of an integrable system 
thus have a natural affine structure, defined by the integration of the Hamiltonian 
vector fields of the first integrals. Notice that, by definition, the solutions of the 
Hamiltonian system are linear in this affine structure. 
What we aim to describe now is a transverse affine structure, determined by 
the action coordinates, that we are going to define. We fix a regular value q of 
the map f. We assume that the level f-l(q) has a compact connected component 
Fq , that we fix as well. We investigate the situation in a neighborhood of Fq • The 
regular values of f constitute an open subset of W, so that there is a neighborhood 
U of q in Rn which consists of regular values. 
Example IIL3.S (The simple pendulum, continuation). The zeroes of the Hamilto-
nian vector field are obtained for p = 0 and sinq = 0, thus the levels H = ±1 are 
singular and the other ones regular. Here U is any open subset of R - {-1, 1}. 
As Figure 3 shows, the regular levels are indeed unions of tori (circles). Let us 
Figure 3. Energy levels for the simple pendulum 
consider, for instance, U =]- 1,1[. Note that H-l(U) has two connected compo-
nents. We restrict our attention to one of them. This is what the picture on the 
right shows. The Hamiltonian vector field has periodic orbits. The difference with 
a periodic Hamiltonian is that here the period depends on the orbit.

The submanifold (torus) Fq being compact, there is a relatively compact 
neighborhood V of Fq in W such that f(V) c U. Let us call 9 the restriction of 
f to V. The mapping 9 : V -t U is submersive, that we can assume to be proper. 
If U and V are chosen small enough, the fibration 9 can be trivialized (this is the 
Ehresmann fibration theorem [46, 47]). We thus get a diffeomorphism 
r : V ------t U x Fq 
such that r-1({u} x Fq) = g-l(u) (this is the fiber of u). Using r, we can also 
construct sections of g. Let us fix a point p of Fq • In the model U x Fq , we have 
an obvious section u ~ (u,p). Look at its image a under r-1 (Figure 4): 
a(u) = r-1(u,p). 
This is indeed a section of g.

Using the section a, we prove now that the tori g-l(U) deform continuously, 
in the sense that g-l(u) is the quotient of Rn by the stabilizer P(a(u)) (I denote 
P(p) the stabilizer of p, this is a lattice(5) in Rn), a lattice that depends only on u 
(and depends smoothly on u). We want to apply the implicit function theorem to 
the equation 
t· a(u) = a(u). 
Let thus to be a point in P(p) eRn. Let A be a neighborhood of to in Rn and B 
be a neighborhood of pin Fq , small enough so that 
tEA and u E U ===* r(t· a(u)) E {u} x B. 
The open subset B of Fq can be considered as an open subset of R n, since Fq ~ 
Rn / P(p). We have thus defined a map

torus Fq). We have 
8(t, u) = 0 ¢=:} T(t· a(u)) = p 
¢=:} t· a(u) = a(u) 
¢=:} t E P(a(u)). 
The partial differential (dt 8)(t,u) of 8 with respect to the variables t is the com-
position of the differential (dTka(u) of the diffeomorphism T and the differential 
of t I-t t . a(u). The latter has rank n, because it maps the vectors : 
of the 
uti 
canonical basis onto the independent vectors Xi (a( u)). 
The partial differential (dt 8)(t,u) being of rank n, the implicit function the-
orem gives a function T : U -f Rn (we may have to shrink the open subset U) 
such that 
{ (t,U) E A x U and t = T(u) {:} t· a(u) = a(u) 
T(p) = to. 
Making to vary in a basis of the lattice P(p), we get a basis of the lattice P(a(u)), 
depending smoothly on u. 
Let thus (Tl (u), ... , Tn (u)) (for u E U) be such a basis of the lattice P( a( u)) 
in R n. Its avatar (Y1 (v), ... , Yn (v)) in Tv V is a basis of the tangent space to the 
fiber. In formulas, if Ti (u) is written, in the canonical basis of R n ,

then

The vector fields Y1, ... ,Yn are periodic of period 1 by definition. Moreover, we 
have, denoting 'ljJ; the flow of Yi, 
We deduce 
'ljJf(v) = (tTi(J(V))) . V. 
'ljJf 0 'ljJr (v) = tTi(J('ljJr (v))) . 'ljJj' (v) 
= tTi(J(V)) . (t'Tj(J(v)) . v) 
= tt'Ti(J(V))Tj(J(v)) . v 
(using the fact that f('ljJf (v)) = f(v)). Hence Yi and lj commute. Hence we have 
defined an action of the torus Tn = Rn /zn on V.

Action coordinates. Action coordinates are defined by the integration of a 1-
form on the trajectories of the vector fields Y;. We need to construct firstly such 
a I-form. We can assume that the open subset U is a ball, and thus that Fq is 
a retract of V. In particular, we have H2 (V; R) ~ H2 (Fq; R). The torus Fq is 
isotropic, so that the cohomology class [w] of the symplectic form w is zero in 
H2(Fq; R). Hence it is also zero in H2(V; R). The symplectic form is thus exact 
on V. Let>. be one of its primitives, that is, a I-form such that w = d>.. We define 
Ji(v) = 11 >.(Y;) 0 'lj;f{v)dt, 
that is, we integrate the function of t that is obtained computing >., at the 
point 'lj;f ( v), on the tangent vector Yi. Putting "Ii (t) = 'lj;f ( v), we define a loop 
parametrized by [0,1]' the orbit of v for the circle action corresponding to the 
vector field Y;. The function Ji ( v) is the integral of the form >. on the loop "Ii, 
that is, 
Proposition IIL3.6. The Tn-action on V is Hamiltonian and its momentum map-
ping is 
Proof We apply a somewhat more general lemma (Lemma III.3.8 below). The 
only thing we need to check is the fact that any of the fundamental vector fields 
Yi satisfies iY,[-Yi = O. Using the Cart an formula, we get 
iY,[-Yiw = iYidiYiw 
= iYi d (2: Ti,jdfJ ) 
= iYi (2: dTi,j 1\ dfj) . 
But Yi is tangent to the fibers of f and Ti,J is constant on these fibers, hence Y; 
is in the kernel of dTi,j and in that of dfj as well.

CHAPTER III. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
LemmaIIL3.8. Let (W,w) be an exact symplectic manifold. Let A be a I-form on 
W such that w = dA. Let 8 1 act on W with fundamental vector field Y. Assume 
that iy.cyw = O. Then the 81-action is Hamiltonian, with Hamiltonian 
J(x) = r A. 
}SloX 
Proof The proof is direct. We compute (dJ) x (Z) for Z in T x Wand we prove that 
(T xJ(Z) = w(Z, Y(x)). 
Let thus x be a point of Wand Z be a tangent vector to W at this point. First, 
we extend Z to an invariant vector field along the orbit of x by putting 
Z(t . x) = T xt(Z). 
Then, we extend Z to a vector field on W, still denoted Z. We write 
J(x) = 11 Atox(Y(t· x))dt 
(in which expression, t denotes both an element of 8 1 = R/Z and the correspond-
ing element in [0,1]). We differentiate. We have to compute, for a fixed t in 8 1 , 
the differential of the function 
X f---+ Atox(Y(t· x)), 
evaluated on Z. This is 
(.cZA}t.x(Y(t· x)) + Atox((.czY)(t· x)). 
The second term of this sum is zero, since.cz Y = -.cyZ and (.cyZ)(t·x) depends 
only on Z along the orbit of x; the vector field Z being invariant along the orbit, 
we have .cyZ(t· x) = O. 
Let us compute the first term. We have 
(dA)(Z, Y) = Z· A(Y) - Y . A(Z) - A([Z, Y]). 
We have said that, at the points t· x, the Lie bracket [Z, Y] vanishes. Hence the 
last term vanishes and we have 
(.cZA}t.x(Y(t· x)) = (dA}t.x(Z(t· x), Y(t· x)) + (.cyA}t.x(Z(t· x)). 
To end the computation of T xJ(Z), we have to integrate these two terms on [0,1]. 
Let us start with the latter. We differentiate the function 
t f---+ Atox(Z(t . x)) 
and get 
d 
dt (Atox(Z(t· x))) = (.cyA}t.x(Z(t· x)) + Atox((.cyZ)(t· x)) = (.cyA}t.x(Z(t· x)). 

III.3. TORUS ACTIONS AND INTEGRABLE SYSTEMS 
95 
We thus get, by integration, 
11 ('cyA)t.x(Z(t· x))dt = 11 :t (At.x(Z(t· x))) dt = o. 
Up to now, we have used the fact that the 2-form W is exact and that it was 
possible to extend Z as a vector field which is invariant along the orbit of x. We 
need now to use the properties of the fundamental vector field Y. Since Y and Z 
are invariant along the orbit of x, the derivative of the function 
t f----t Wt.x(Z(t· x), Y(t· x)) 
with respect to t is 
(:tWt.x) (Z(t·x), Y(t,x))+Wt.x «'cyZ)t.x, Y(t· x))+Wt.x (Z(t· x), (,Cy Y)(t· x)). 
The second term is zero by the assumption we have made on Y. The two others 
are obviously zero. The derivative with respect to t is zero, hence the function 
itself does not depend on t. We get eventually 
11 Wt.x(Z(t· x), Y(t· x))dt = wx(Z, Y(x)), 
namely 
TxJ(Z) = wx(Z, Y(x)) 
and this is what we wanted to prove. 
o 
Notice that the map J has rank n, hence the torus action is effective. We 
have indeed 
and this linear mapping has rank n because the vectors Y; are independent and 
the form W is nondegenerate. 
Angle coordinates. What we have got up to now is a symplectic fibration 
J: V ----+ U, 
the fibers of which are Lagrangian tori, and a Tn-action with momentum map-
ping J. We can use, as above, a section a of the fibration and a diffeomorphism 
T with U x Fq. As Fq is a torus R n /zn, we have coordinates «(h, ... , en) on Fq 
and thus also coordinates (J1 , ... , In, e1 , ... , en) on V. Notice that the e/s, being 
angles, belong to R/271"Z, while our torus is Rn /zn (hence the normalization in 
the formula for the symplectic form). 
In these coordinates, the symplectic form is written 
1 
W = 271" 2:= dJi 1\ dei + 2:= ai,jdJi 1\ dJj 
(there are no terms dBi 1\ dBj because the fibers are Lagrangian). 

96 
CHAPTER Ill. SYMPLECTIC AND HAMILTONIAN GROUP ACTIONS 
Put TJ = L ai,jdJi 1\ dJj. The ai,/s might depend on the Ok'S, but this is not 
the case: the form w being closed, TJ is closed as well, in other words, TJ does not 
depend on the Ok'S. In a more intrinsic way, TJ = (J*w is closed as w is. Thus we 
have a closed form on U. We have already assumed (and used the fact) that U is 
contractible. Hence TJ is exact, TJ = dA for some I-form A on U that we write 
The Ai's are functions on U. We use them to modify the section (J, putting 
<Pi = Oi - Ai 
(the new "angles") or 
s(J1, ... , In) = (J1, ... , In, 01 - A1, ... , On - An), 
in short 
Eventually, 
s*W = (J*W - dA = 0 
thus 
1 
W = 271" L dJi 1\ d<pi. 
Notice that J can be modified by the addition of a constant, <P by the addition of 
a function of J. 
Remark IIL3.9. 
The symplectic volume of our neighborhood V is simply the 
(Lebesgue) measure of U. 
The Hamiltonian system in the action-angle coordinates. Let H be any 
function in the algebra generated by the fJ's. The Hamiltonian system i; = XH(x) 
has a specially simple form in the action-angle coordinates. Firstly, the Hamilto-
nian H is in the algebra generated by the first integrals and thus is a function of 
J1, ... , I n . We put 
H(x) = h(J1 , ... , I n ). 
Then, the coordinates (J1, ... , I n, <P1, ... , <Pn) are symplectic (up to a factor 271", 
thus the Hamiltonian system is written, in these coordinates, 
. 
ah 
ah 
Ji = - a<pi = 0 and rpi = aJi = ai(J1, ... , I n). 
In this form, it is easy to check that the solutions are indeed angles <Pi depending 
linearly on the time on the levels of J. It is clear that such a system can be solved 
by quadratures, hence the terminology "integrable system" . 
I will give examples of action-angle coordinates in Chapter V.

Exercise IIL19 (Symplectic cutting). Let H be a periodic Hamiltonian on a sym-

Notice that both are Sl-invariant and that the first one is diffeomorphic to H-1(t). 
Check that the second is equivariantly diffeomorphic with H- 1 (]t, +oo[) x Sl. 
Deduce that the reduced symplectic manifold jj-l(t)/Sl contains an open sub-
manifold diffeomorphic with the open submanifold H-1(]t, +oo[) and that the

We have thus cut the symplectic manifold W at the level t of H and "closed" 
it by the addition of a symplectic submanifold isomorphic with H-l(t)/Sl. This 
simple and elegant construction is due to Lerman [93]' it has beautiful applications, 
see for instance [94].

CHAPTER IV 
MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
This chapter is the heart of the book. Quite a few spectacular theorems will be 
proved. The main ones are 
- the famous convexity theorem of Atiyah [7] and Guillemin-Sternberg [63] 
which asserts that the image of a compact connected symplectic manifold 
under the momentum mapping of a Hamiltonian torus action is a convex 
polyhedron (this is Theorem IV.4.3) 
- the uniqueness theorem of Delzant [39], according to which, when the torus 
acting is half the dimension of the manifold, the polyhedron determines the 
manifold (this is Theorem IV.4.20). 
I will also prove refinements (the Kahler version of the convexity theorem, 
due to Atiyah) and beautiful applications (the Schur-Horn, Toeplitz-Hausdorff 
and Kushnirenko theorems stated in the introduction). 
In the case of the Hamiltonian action of a torus, the fixed points of the action 
are the critical points of a function. This is why the study of Hamiltonian actions 
is in some sense easy: one can use Morse theory. We shall not avoid it here, so we 
shall begin by proving that the functions under consideration have very convenient 
properties from that point of view (Frankel's theorem [51]' here Theorem IV.2.3, 
from which we shall derive, as Atiyah does it, the basic result (Corollary IV.3.2) 
announced in the introduction, then the convexity theorem itself and some of its 
applications) . 
In this chapter, we thus consider a symplectic manifold endowed with the 
Hamiltonian action of a torus T, with momentum mapping J-l : W ----+ {*. 
IV.1. Critical points of almost periodic Hamiltonians 
IV.1.a. Almost periodic Hamiltonians. We know that the fixed points of T 
correspond to certain critical points of J-l. It would be more convenient to have a 
single function (with values in R) allowing us to study the whole T-action. It is 

106 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
not very difficult to find: choose any X E t which generates T in the sense that 
the one parameter subgroup exp(tX) is dense in T. The associated Hamiltonian 
W ~ 
t* ------. (RX)* 
has the fixed points of T as critical points. 
We shall say that a function H : W --t R is an almost periodic Hamiltonian 
if the flow of its Hamiltonian vector field XH generates a subgroup of the group 
of all diffeomorphisms of W the closure of which is a torus. 
Remark IV.I.I. 
The closure of the subgroup generated by any vector is a con-
nected commutative subgroup; it is thus equivalent to requiring that the subgroup 
generated by the flow of X H is compact. This is not a mild assumption. It makes 
a difference, for instance, between a Hamiltonian H and its square H2 (see for 
instance Exercise II!.2l). 
Example IV.I.2 (The complex projective space). 
Consider the projective space 
pn(c), endowed with its standard symplectic form (Example III.2.18). The torus 
Tn = {(to, .. . , tn) E T n+ 1 I IT ti = l} 
,=0 
acts on pn (C) by 
(to, ... ,tn) . [zo, ... ,zn] = [tozo, ... ,tnzn] 
(brackets denote homogeneous coordinates). The fixed points of this action are the 
n + 1 points [0, ... , l, 0, ... ,0]. The action is, of course, Hamiltonian (as that of 
T n +1 on Cn +1 was, see Example III.l.7) and is even a special case of the action 
described in Example II!.l.ll. The momentum mapping is deduced from that in 
Figure 1 
Example III.l.7, this is the map

107 
which takes its values in the hyperplane 2:7=0 Xi = ~. The image of J.l (in the case 
n = 2) is shown in Figure 1. Fix real numbers ao, ... , an. The function (projection) 
is an almost periodic Hamiltonian. 
IV.1.h. Critical points. Let us now investigate the fixed points of an almost 
periodic Hamiltonian H. Call T the torus "generated by H". The critical points 
of H are the zeros of X H , or the fixed points of T. We have seen in Corollary 1.2.3 
that the set Z of fixed points is a submanifold in W. 
The symplectic form w is preserved by T and by definition(1). With the help 
of an invariant Riemannian metric, one derives an invariant calibrated almost 
complex structure J and an invariant Hermitian metric (see §I1.2). 
Let z E Z. Then the torus T acts on the complex vector space T z W preserving 
J and the Hermitian form, that is to say, as a subgroup of U(n). Notice first that 
all these transformations are diagonalizable: the exponential map t ---7 T is onto 
and the elements of t, sitting in u(n) (the skew-Hermitian matrices) cannot avoid 
being diagonalizable. As T is commutative, there is a basis of T z W in which all 
the elements of T are diagonal. We can thus write: 
where Vo is the subspace of fixed points of T, in other words Vo = T zZ c T z W, 
and each Vj is T-invariant. 
Let us look at how expXH acts on this decomposition. On each complex 
subspace Vj, it acts as multiplication by some scalar exp( i.>\j) for a real number Aj, 
since X H EtC u(n). Moreover, Aj is nonzero if j i=- 0, because X H generates the 
whole torus T. Notice, by the way: 
Proposition IV.I.3. Each component of the set Z of zeros of the almost periodic 
vector field X H is a symplectic submanifold. 
Proof. As we have just seen, this is an almost complex submanifold for a structure 
calibrated by w.

At each fixed point z, the above gives the second derivative of H: 
(1) This is one more zeugma.

Notice also that the second derivative is nondegenerate in the direction trans-
verse to the fixed submanifold. This leads us to the next notion. 
IV.2. Morsefunctions (in the sense of Bott) 
IV.2.a. Definitions. A function f on a manifold W is called a Morse function 
(in the sense of Bott) if its critical set is a submanifold of W, and if its second 
derivative is a nondegenerate quadratic form in the transverse directions. 
Example Iv'2.I. If the critical points are isolated, this means that the second 
derivative is nondegenerate and f is a Morse function (in the sense of Morse!) 
We will use a Morse lemma "with parameter": 
Proposition Iv'2.2. There exist local coordinates (x, y) in the neighborhood of the 
point z of the critical submanifold Z in which 
(1) the submanifold Z is described by y = 0, 
(2) the function f may be written 
f{x, y) = f{z) + qx{Y) 
where qx is a quadratic form, nondegenerate in the y variables (transverse 
to Z). 
Proof All the constructions in the classical proofs of Morse lemma (see [108] for 
example) can be parametrized without any difficulty. 
D 

IV.2. MORSE FUNCTIONS (IN THE SENSE OF BOTT) 
109 
The index of the second derivative (number of "negative squares") is locally 
constant along the critical submanifold. Its value on a connected component Zj 
will be called the index of the critical submanifold Zj and denoted by >'(Zj). 
Thanks to the Morse lemma, one can construct subbundles (each isomorphic 
to each other) of rank >.( Zj) of the normal bundle to Zj on which the second 
derivative is negative. Such a subbundle is called "the" negative normal bundle. 
What we have said may be summarized as: 
Theorem IV,2.3 (Frankel [51]). Let H be an almost periodic Hamiltonian on a sym-
plectic manifold (W, w). Then H is a Morse function, all the critical submanifolds 
of which have an even index. 
D 
Example Iv'2.4 (The complex projective space (continuation». We consider again 
the projective space with a Morse function f deduced from the momentum map-
ping of the Tn-action, in two different cases (shown in Figure 2).

The function f is then a Morse function. The point [1,0, ... ,0] is the ab-
solute minimum, the critical point [0, ... ,0, 1,0, ... ,0] (with the 1 at the 
k-th place) is a critical point of index 2k, corresponding to the k-th critical 
value, ak. The function f is a perfect(2) Morse function.

CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
There are only two critical values. The minimum, 0, is obtained on the 
submanifold Zn = 0, a projective hyperplane, critical submanifold of index 0. 
The maximum, ~, is obtained at the point [0, ... ,0,1]. 
IV.2.h. Reconstruction. In the case of isolated critical points, one can recon-
struct the manifold with the help of the critical points and their indices (see [108]). 
When he introduced these more general Morse functions, Bott proved that that 
was also the case for them. Let, for a E R, Wa = {x E W I f(x) ::;; a} and 
Va = {x E W I f(x) = a} the level a. The two main results of the theory are 
the two next theorems. 
Theorem IV.2.5. If W is compact and if the interval [a, b] c R contains no critical 
value of f, then Wb is diffeomorphic to Wa. 
Hence the topology does not change if we are not going through a critical 
level. Here is what happens when we cross one: 
R 
b 
c 
a 
Figure 3 
Theorem IV.2.6. 
If C E [a, b] is the unique critical value of f in this interval, the 
homotopy type of Wb is described by the addition to Wa of the negative normal 
bundle of the critical submanifold at level c. 
See Figure 3, in which the critical submanifold is a point (the point Z), and 
its negative normal bundle an interval (the curve E). 
Sketch of a proof of Theorem IV.2.5. See [108] for details. Choose a Riemannian 
metric on W, thus getting a gradient vector field grad f, which does not vanish on 
f- 1[a, b]. Modify it with the help of a differentiable function p on W which takes

the value 1/ [[grad f[[2 on f- 1 [a, b] and which vanishes outside a neighborhood, as 
follows: 
x = pgradf. 
Calling <Pt the flow of X, it is easily checked that <Pb-a sends Wb onto Wa' 
D 
Proof of Theorem IV.2.6. Let Z be the critical submanifold corresponding to c 
and Uc be a small enough tubular neighborhood of Z in W. We describe now the 
homotopy type of the pair 
Let N be the normal bundle to Z in Wand E be the negative normal bundle 
along Z. Identify UE with a part of N, thus getting a projection p : Uc --+ Z. Call 
Ac the image of E: 
Ac = {v E UE [ v E Ep( v) } 
and A;- the complement of Z in AE (see Figure 4).

Choosing a supplement bundle D of E in N, it is now very easy to write 
down a retraction N - D --+ E, and it is not more difficult to prove the following 
lemma. 
Lemma Iv.2. 7. For E small enough, there exists a retraction (by deformation) 
o 
(We, We) n Uc ------+ (Ac:, A;-). 
This ends the proof. 
IV.3. Connectedness of the fibers of the momentum mapping 
Let us begin by stating and proving the key result of [7]. 
D 
D 

112 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
Connectedness of the levels. 
Theorem Jv.3.1. 
Let f be a non degenerate function (in the sense of Bott) which 
has no critical submanifold of index 1 or n-l. Then it has a unique local minimum 
and a unique local maximum. Moreover, all of its nonempty levels are connected. 
Proof We use Theorem IV.2.6. The homotopy type of Wa can change only by 
crossing a critical level, in which case it changes by adding to Wa the negative 
normal bundle of the critical submanifold. If the critical submanifold has index 0, 
that is if this is a local minimum, we add a connected component. To connect all 
pieces later on, as W is connected, we must go through a new critical level, for 
which the sphere bundle of the negative bundle must be connected. .. but this is 
impossible except if the index of the submanifold is 1. Thus it is seen that there 
can be only one local minimum, and, applying the result to - f, only one local 
maximum 
Moreover, Wa is connected, and, for the same reasons, 
W - Wa = {x I f(x) ;;;: a} 
is connected as well. Assume v;, = f-l(C) is a nonconnected level. Any component 
of v;, thus defines a nontrivial element in Hn - 1 (We). But this group is zero: indeed, 
if c is strictly contained between the minimum and the maximum of f, the critical 
submanifolds of critical levels lower than c all have negative normal bundles of 
dimension ~ n - 2 which cannot create nonzero elements of H n - 1. 
0 
The case of almost periodic Hamiltonians. One easily deduces the next 
corollary from Theorems IV.2.3 and IV.3.1. 
Corollary [V.3.2. 
Let (W, w) be a compact connected symplectic manifold and let 
H : W -7 R be an almost periodic Hamiltonian. All the levels H-1(t) of Hare 
empty or connected. 
0 
Remark [V.3.3. This use of Morse theory and this connectedness result are the core 
of the topic treated in this book. Morse theory will also be used in Chapter VIII. 
It also plays a role in more difficult problems, for instance in the results analogous 
to Theorem IVA.3 for noncommutative groups, which for a relatively long period 
were not completely solved. When Kirwan succeeded, in [86], this was with the 
help of the function 11J.l11 2, which is rather degenerate, but has nevertheless enough 
of the properties of Morse functions to be handled and give results [85]. There are 
now alternative ways of proving the convexity theorems, for instance [34, 2, 94]. 

IV.4. APPLICATION TO CONVEXITY THEOREMS 
113 
IV.4. Application to convexity theorems 
IV.4.a. Ginzburg's proof of the Toeplitz-Hausdorff theorem. Recall its 
statement, already given in the introduction. 
Theorem IV.4.1. 
Let A be an n x n complex matrix, and let A ERn. The image 
of the mapping 
fA: H).. --------t C 
X f---------t tr( AX) 
is a convex subset of c. 
We begin by proving a direct application of Corollary IV.3.2. 
Lemma IV.4.2. Let (W, w) be a symplectic manifold. Let hand 12 be two functions, 
the Hamiltonian vector fields of which generate a relatively compact subgroup in 
the diffeomorphism group of W. The image of h x 12 is a convex subset of R 2 . 
Proof of the lemma. Let H : W ---) R be the composition of h x 12 with any linear 
projection R2 ---) R. The Hamiltonian vector field of H generates a relatively com-
pact subgroup in the group of diffeomorphisms of W, thus H is almost periodic. Its 
fibers are connected ... bllt all these fibers, when H varies, are all the intersections 
of the image of h x 12 with the straight lines in R2. Hence this image meets any 
straight line in an interval, thus it is convex. 
0 
Proof of the theorem. Apply the lemma to 
W = H).., 
h = Ref A, 
12 = ImfA. 
The only thing we need to check is that the Hamiltonian vector fields of hand 12 
generate a relatively compact subgroup in the diffeomorphism group of H)... This 
is true because these are fundamental vector fields for the action of U(n) on H).., 
the subgroup they generate is then a subgroup of the compact group U(n): indeed 
if one writes A = U + iV with U and V Hermitian matrices, then h (h) = tr( U h), 
12(h) = tr(Vh), and h is a Hamiltonian for the vector field iU, 12 a Hamiltonian 
for the vector field iV, as we have seen in Exercise II.26. 
0 
IV.4.b. Convexity of the image of the momentum mapping. Imitating 
the proof of Lemma IV.4.2, we get Atiyah's proof of the Atiyah [7] and Guillemin-
Sternberg [63] convexity theorem. 
Theorem IV.4.3. 
Let (W, w) be a compact connected symplectic manifold. Assume 
that h, ... , fn are n functions on W, the flows of the Hamiltonian vector fields of 
which generate a subgroup of the diffeomorphism group of W the closure of which 
is a torus. Then the image of W by the mapping f = (h, ... , fn) is a convex 
subset of R n . Moreover if Z 1, ... , Z N denote the connected components of the set 

114 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
of common critical points of the fj's, then f(Zj) is a point Cj and f(W) is the 
convex hull of the points Cj. 
Remark IV.4.4. As we have noticed (in Remark IV.l.1), the fact that X Ji generates 
a compact subgroup is very sensitive to the actual function Ii used. This is also, 
even more obviously, the case for the conclusion of the theorem (imagine what 
happens to the polyhedron if you replace one of the fi'S by its square for instance). 
In particular, if J.l is the momentum mapping for a Hamiltonian action of the 
torus Tn on W, the choice of a basis of Tn identifies t* to Rn and the components 
of J.l to n functions h, ... , fn satisfying the assumption of the theorem. 
Corollary IV.4.5. Let (W, w) be a compact connected symplectic manifold endowed 
with a Hamiltonian torus action with momentum mapping J.l. The image of J.l is 
a convex polyhedron in t*, the convex hull of the images of the fixed points of the 
torus action. 
Example IV.4.6 (The complex projective space (continuation». 
The image of 
pn-l (C) under the momentum mapping (shown in Figure 1) is the convex hull of 
the n points ~(O, ... , 0,1,0, ... ,0), images of the fixed points [0, ... ,0,1,0, ... ,0] 
of the Tn-action. 
Proof of the theorem. We prove the following statements (in which n is the number 
of component functions of f): 
(An) The level set f-l(t) is empty or connected for all tERn. 
(Bn) The image f(W) is convex. 
(en) If Zl,"" ZN are the connected components of the set of common critical 
points of the j/s, then f(Zj) is a point Cj and f(W) is the convex hull of 
the points Cj. 
Having noticed that (B 1) is obvious, we first prove that (An) implies (Bn+1 ). 
For this, consider the diagram 
Rn 
where 7f is any linear projection. The assumption applies to g = 7f 0 f, since any 
connected closed subgroup of a torus is a torus. As in the proof of Lemma IV.4.2, 
the subsets 
f(W) n 7f-l(t) = f(g-l(t)) 

IV.4. APPLICATION TO CONVEXITY THEOREMS 
115 
describe, when 7r and t vary, the intersections of f(W) with all the straight lines 
in Rn+1. By Property (An), g-l (t) is empty or connected, likewise its image by f, 
thus f (W) is convex. 
Let us now prove that (Bn) implies (Cn). Denote by Xl, ... ,Xn the Hamil-
tonian vector fields associated with h, ... , f no Let T be the torus they generate. 
The Zj's are the connected components of the set of fixed points of T. On such 
a component, the X;'s vanish, thus the fi'S are constant, so that f(Zj) = Cj is 
indeed a point of R n. Let now ifJ be a linear combination ifJ = L Adi' the real 
numbers Ai'S being chosen so generic that the vector field X = L AiXi generates 
a dense subgroup of T. Then the Zj's are the components of the set of critical 
points of ifJ. In particular, the maximum of ifJ occurs on Z. Hence the restriction 
of the linear form L Ai~i on R n to f (W) reaches its maximum at one of the Cj's. 
As this is true for almost any choice of the Ai'S, the image of W is contained in 
the convex hull of the points Cj. We already know that it is convex. It contains Cj 
by definition, so we have proven (Cn ). 
Let us now show by induction on n that (An) holds. Statement (Ad is exactly 
Corollary IV.3.2. We now assume, by induction assumption, that (An) is true. Let 
h, ... ,fn+1: W ----+ R 
be n + 1 functions satisfying the assumption and let ~ = (6, ... , ~n+l) be a point 
in Rn+1. We want to show that 
r1(~) = f1 1(6) n··· n f;;~l (~n+d 
is empty or connected. If f has no regular value, then one of the dfi is a linear 
combination of the others, we may forget it and apply (An), so that we are done. 
Otherwise, the set of regular values is dense. By continuity, we may thus assume 
that ~ is a regular value of f. Then N = f1 1(6) n··· n f;;l(~n) is a submanifold 
of W. By (An), we know that this submanifold is connected. 
Let us now check that fn+1lN satisfies the assumptions of Theorem IV.3.1. 
Consider its critical points on N. These are the points of W where (on W) dfn+1 
is a linear combination of the dfi'S, 
n 
dfn+1(X) = :LAi(x)dfi(x). 
i=l 
Lemma Iv.4.7. The Ai's are locally constant on the set of critical points of fn+1 
in N. 
Proof Let x be such a critical point. We have 
n 
Xn+1(X) = :L Ai(x)Xi(x). 
i=l 

116 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
Hence the Lie algebra of the stabilizer of x contains the line generated by X n+1 -
L:AiXi. Let X be any vector in this stabilizer. By definition of N, we know that 
the vector fields X!, ... , Xn are independent at x, so that X is a multiple of 
Xn+l - L: J.LiXi for some scalars J.Li's. Hence 
n 
(Xn+1 - LJ.LiXi)(X) = 0, 
i=l 
hence J.Li = Ai(X) and the Lie algebra of the stabilizer of x is the line generated 
by Xn+l - L: Ai(X)Xi. Now the manifold W is compact, so that there are only 
finitely many orbit types and hence finitely many stabilizers. The Ai'S must thus 
be locally constant. 
0 
Let x E N be such a critical point. The Ai'S are constants near x. Put 
F = fn+l - L: Adi and let Z be the component of critical points of F (on W) 
which contains x. The function F is an almost periodic Hamiltonian on W as well, 
to which we cannot refrain from applying Frankel's theorem (Theorem IV.2.3). 
Lemma Iv.4.8. The submanifolds Z and N are transversal at x. 
Proof. We must show that d/1(x), ... , dfn(x) are still independent when restricted 
to Z. Let X!, ... , Xn be the Hamiltonian vector fields associated to /1, ... , fn. 
They are tangent to Z because the Poisson brackets {Ii, F} vanish, but Z is sym-
plectic, thus for all (al,"" an), there exists Y E TxZ such that w(L: aiXi, Y) i= 0, 
which may be equally well written L: aidji(Y) =f O. 
0 
Now we know that Z n N is a critical submanifold of FIN. Moreover, the 
transversality of Z and N implies that the normal bundle of Z n N in N is the 
restriction to Z n N of the normal bundle of Z in W. Thus, Z n N is a critical 
submanifold of even index. Now, when restricted to N, F = fn+l - L: Ai~i, (and 
thus fn+l) has the same property. We may then apply Theorem IV.3.l to fn+lIN, 
from which it follows that 
(fn+1IN )-l(~n+l) = N n f-l(~n+d = f-l(~) 
is connected, hence (An+d holds. And this is the end of the proof.

Remark IV.4.9. We deduce that the vector fields Xl, ... ,Xn have common zeros (in 
other words the torus action does have fixed points): it follows from the theorem 
that Z is not empty. Moreover, there may be a lot of those fixed points, as the 
following corollary shows. 
Corollary Iv.4.10. Let T be an n-dimensional torus acting in an effective and 
Hamiltonian way on a compact symplectic manifold (W,w). The action has at 
least n + 1 fixed points. 

IVA. APPLICATION TO CONVEXITY THEOREMS

Proof We have noticed in Corollary III.2.4 that, for an effective action, there 
exists at least one point at which the momentum mapping fL is submersive, and 
thus open. Hence the image fL(W) is a convex polyhedron with nonempty interior 
in R n, it must thus have at least n + 1 vertices, which cannot avoid being the 
images of at least as many fixed points. 
D 
This corollary generalizes the remark we have made for n = 1 at the beginning 
of § III.2. 
IV A.c. Application: a theorem of Schur on Hermitian matrices. We shall 
apply the convexity theorem to the action by conjugation of the torus of diagonal 
unitary matrices on Hermitian matrices. Thanks to § III.l.c, we already know that 
the momentum mapping of this action maps a Hermitian matrix h to its diagonal 
entries (h1,1,"" hn,n), and the convexity theorem says: 
Corollary IV.4.11 ([121], and also [88, 7, 63]). 
Let h be a Hermitian matrix with 
spectrum A = (A1, .. . , An) E Rn and let S = {(A~.(1), ... , Au(n)) I (J' E en}. Then 
the diagonal of the matrix h is in the convex hull S of S. Conversely, any point of 
S is the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with spectrum A. 
Proof The only thing we have to check is that the points in S are the fixed points 
of the action of Ton HA. It is thus enough to notice that an element h of HA is 
fixed by T if and only if it is diagonal. 
0 
We have h1,1 + .. ·+hn,n = trh = A1 + .. '+An constant on H A, in particular, 
its image is included in a hyperplane and the action is not effective. 
Figure 5 shows some examples, in the case n = 3. In the first picture, the three 
Figure 5 
eigenvalues are distinct, HA is the manifold of complete flags in C 3 (a symplectic 
manifold of dimension 6) and its image is a hexagon. In the second one, there are 
only two distinct eigenvalues, HA is a complex projective plane and the image a 
triangle (the very same triangle, indeed, that appears in Figure 1). Figure 6 shows 

118 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
the image of a principal SU(4)-orbit (this is the manifold of complete flags in e 4 , 
so that it has dimension 12). This polyhedron, the faces of which are rectangles 
and hexagons, is a permutahedron(3). 
Figure 6 
Permutahedra can be understood as geometric representations of the sym-
metric group. The permutahedron Pn is also the image by the momentum mapping 
'Hl ,2, ... ,n+1 --) Rn+1 of a principal coadjoint orbit of SU(n + 1). 
More generally, let 0 be a principal coadjoint orbit in the dual g* of the 
Lie algebra of a compact Lie group G. Recall from Remark II.3.5 that (9 is the 
homogeneous space G/T for some maximal torus T of G. Now, the fixed points of 
the T-action on (9 correspond to elements in N(T)/T = W(G), the Weyl group 
of G (here, N(T) denotes the normalizer of T in G). The vertices of the image of 
the momentum mapping 
J.1 : (9 C g* ---+ {* 
look like the Weyl group of G. For more information on images of orbits, see [62]. 
IV.4.d. Orbits, stabilizers and the image of the momentum mapping. 
The polyhedra we get as images of momentum mappings are rather special ones. 
Applying the equivariant version of the Darboux Theorem, we shall now investigate 
them and especially look at the "equations" of their faces. 
Let z be a fixed point of the Hamiltonian action of torus Tn on the symplectic 
manifold W. The group Tn acts in a linear way on the tangent space T z W as above, 
Here, each Vi is a complex line on which Tn acts by multiplication 
t'Vi = tD:i Vi where t = (tl,"" tn) E Tn = Sl X ... X Sl c en 
(3)The permutahedron Pn is defined as the convex hull of the points (0'(1), ... ,O'(n)) when 0' 
describes the symmetric group 6 n . See Exercise IV.II.

for some multi-exponent ai = (at, ... , ai) E zn. We can also consider ai as the 
element of t* defined by 
(ai,ej) =a; 
where (e1, ... , en) is the basis of t defined by the above decomposition. To say the 
same thing in a more intrinsic way, the T -action on Vi is defined by its character 
ai : T --+ 81 ; differentiating and transposing, we get a map R --+ t*, and ai is just 
the image of 1, the weight of the representation. 
Proposition IV.4.12. 
Let z be a fixed point in the symplectic manifold Wand let 
p = J.L(z) E t* be its image under the momentum mapping of the torus action. 
There exists a neighborhood U of z in Wand a neighborhood V of p in t* such that 
J.L(U) = V n Cp(a1"" ,an) 
where Cp (a1, ... , an) denotes the convex cone with vertex p generated by the vec-
tors (a1, ... ,an) in t*. 
Proof We first apply the Darboux Theorem in its equivariant form (this is Re-
mark ILl.13) near the fixed point z. The exponential of any invariant Riemannian 
metric 
exp: TzW ----t W 
conjugates the T -action on Wand the linear action on T z W described above. 
Moreover, it sends a neighborhood Uo of 0 in T z W onto a neighborhood U of z 
in W. If Uo is small enough, one finds a T -equivariant map 
such that 'ljJ* exp* w = woo We now have two momentum mappings: 
, 
exp 
p, 
J.L : TzW::::> Uo ----t U ----t t* 
on the one hand, and 
J.Lo : TzW ----t t* 
(associated with the linear action) on the other hand. They can only differ by a 
constant vector, we may thus fix J.Lo(O) = J.L'(O) = J.L(z) = p in order that they agree 
everywhere. Of course we have 
and hence the image of U by J.L (as that of Uo by J.Lo) is the cone

Corollary IV.4.13. The hyperplanes which delimit the polyhedron P in t* have in-
tegral equations. 
0 

120 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
This statement may be understood, either in coordinates, or, in a more in-
trinsic way, as follows. The equation of any hyperplane in t* may be written as 
(X,~) = a for some X E t and a E Rj and in our case we can assume that X 
generates a circle S x in T, namely, that exp X = l. 
Choose one of these hyperplanes, say H, and such an "integral" vector X. 
The vector field X is periodic and is the Hamiltonian vector field of the function 
x ~ 
(X,J-t(x)) = /ix(x). 
Let F c H be the face of P which is contained in H. Consider J-t-l(F). By the 
very definition, /ix is constant on J-t-1(F), that is to say that the circle Sx fixes 
all points of J-t-1(F), which is thus included in the union of the fixed submanifolds 
of S x, and hence is a symplectic submanifold of W. 
As the T -action on W is effective, T / S x is a torus with an effective action 
on J-t-1 (F). The open set consisting of principal orbits corresponds to those points 
x of J-t-l(F) for which 1m T xJ-t = H (this is always a subspace of H). In this case, 
(1m TxJ-tt = Sx 
is indeed the Lie algebra of the stabilizer. In particular 
dimJ-t-l(F) = dimH -l. 
The momentum mapping of the T/Sx-action on J-t-l(F) is obtained from 
- the exact sequence of groups 
1 ----4 Sx ----4 T ----4 T / S X ----4 1 
- which may be differentiated, giving the exact sequence of Lie algebras 
o ----4 s X ----4 t ----4 t/ s x ----4 0 
- and then transposed to the exact sequence of vector spaces 
o ----4 (t/sx)* ----4 g* ----4 Sx ----40 
which exhibits (t/sx)* as a hyperplane of g* (parallel to H!). The momentum 
mapping J-t, which takes its values in this hyperplane (up to translation), is the 
momentum mapping for the action of the quotient group. 
IV.4.e. Effective actions and Delzant's uniqueness theorem. We con-
centrate now on effective completely integrable actions, that is actions of half-
dimensional tori. 
Corollary IV.4.14. Let W be a compact connected symplectic manifold endowed 
with an effective completely integrable action. For any point Z E W, the rank of 
the momentum mapping J-t at z is the dimension of the face of J-t(W) to which J-t(z) 
belongs. 

IV.4. APPLICATION TO CONVEXITY THEOREMS 
121 
Proof. Let H be the (neutral component of the) stabilizer of z. Let k be its dimen-
sion. We look at the action of H on W as a subgroup of T. Now z is a fixed point. 
We can choose a basis (XI, ... ,Xk ) of~, completed as a basis (Xl, ... ,Xn ) of t 
(here 2n = dim W), so that the projection IT : t* -+ ~* is just 
and the momentum mapping f.LH is IT 0 f.L. We apply Proposition IV.4.12 to the 
fixed point z of H and get 
f.LH(U) = V n Cp (Ol" .. ,Ok), 
Now, as H is the (neutral component ofthe) stabilizer of z, the weights 01, ... , Ok 
generate (a rank-k sublattice of) the lattice Zk, so that the cone Cp has p as its 
unique vertex and the dimension of the face of f.L(W) to which p belongs is n-k. 
0 
Remark Iv.4.15. 
As we assume the action to be effective, the interior of the 
polyhedron P under consideration is nonempty (f.L being a submersion at some 
point). As we also assume that the torus acting is of maximal dimension (half the 
dimension of the manifold), the points with trivial stabilizer in W correspond to 
the points in the interior of the polyhedron. According to Proposition III.2.3, the 
interior points of the polyhedron are then(4) the regular values of the momentum 
mapping. 
This proof of the corollary above gives a more precise result. 
Proposition IV.4.16. Let P be the image polyhedron of the momentum mapping f.L 
of an effective completely integrable action. Let F be any k-dimensional face of P. 
Then f.L-1(F) is a symplectic submanifold of dimension 2k and 
o 
0 
f.L1/,_l(P) : f.L-1(F) ----+ F 
is a fibration with fiber a torus Tk. 
o 
o 
In this statement, F denotes the relative interior of F, namely its interior in 
the affine space it spans. 
Still considering the effective completely integrable action of a torus T, let 
now z be a fixed point of the whole group T and let p = f.L(z). We know that z is 
an isolated fixed point, hence the weights of the linearized action of Ton 
T zW=V1 EB"'EBVn 
form a basis of t*. Hence, at each vertex of the polyhedron P, we see a polyhe-
dral cone generated by n independent vectors. Such a polyhedron is said to be 
(4) This is not the case when the dimension ofthe torus is smaller. See, for instance, Exercise IV.lO. 

122 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
simple. Recall that the action is also effective, so that the weights must form an 
integral basis of the lattice zn E t*. Such a simple polyhedron is called primitive 
(see Figure 7). We thus have proved the following proposition.

Figure 7 
Proposition 1V.4.17 ([39]). The polyhedron image of the momentum mapping of an 
effective completely integrable action on a compact connected symplectic manifold 
is primitive. 
D 
A theorem of Delzant asserts the converse: all primitive polyhedra are indeed 
images of such momentum mappings(5). We will check that this is true in Chap-
ter VII. 
Remarks IV.4.18 
(1) If the action is not effective, the polyhedron will not be primitive. See 
Exercise IV.3. 
(2) There is of course no claim that the polyhedron itself should be integral. 
The reader has certainly understood, for instance, that multiplying the 
symplectic form by A will result in a dilation (by A) on the polyhedron. 
Remark W,4.19 (Global action-angle coordinates). Let fL : W -t R n be the mo-
mentum mapping for an effective completely integrable action. We know (this is 
assertion (An) in the proof of Theorem IV.4.3) that all the levels of fL are con-
nected. Moreover, we have seen (this is Remark IV.4.15) that the points in the 
interior of the polyhedron P = fL(W) are regular values of fL. Let t be a point of the 
o 
interior P. Its inverse image fL-l(t) is a Tn-orbit and a Liouville torus (according 
to the terminology of §III.3.b). Also 
(5)This is why primitive polyhedra are sometimes (see for instance [61, 31]) called Delzant 
polyhedra.

is a submersion and, in particular (Ehresmann's theorem as in § III.3.b, plus the 
0 0 0  
fact that P is contractile), the open subset J.t -1 (p) is diffeomorphic to P x Tn. 
o 
Still because the interior P is contractile, the symplectic form w is exact on 
o 
the inverse image J.t-1(p): we have 
o 
[w] E H2(J.t-1(p);R) ~ H2(Tn;R), 
but the fibers Tn are Lagrangian, so that [w] = o. Hence, following the proof of the 
Arnold-Liouville Theorem (Theorem III.3.3), the components of the momentum 
mapping J.t are already action coordinates and we deduce angle coordinates using 
any section. Hence, we have seen that there are global action-angle coordinates(6) 
o 
onJ.t-1(p). 
Let us now come to the main result of this subsection, namely, Delzant's 
uniqueness theorem, which asserts that the polyhedron determines the symplectic 
manifold. Precisely: 
Theorem W.4.20 (Delzant [39]). 
Let (W,w), (W',w') be two compact connected 
symplectic manifolds of dimension 2n. Assume that both are endowed with an 
effective completely integrable action and that the two momentum mappings 
J.t : W -----t R n , 
J.t': W' -----t R n 
have the same image. Then there exists an equivariant (symplectic) diffeomorphism 
r.p : W -----t W' such that p/ 0 r.p = J.t. 
The only reason why I have put the word "symplectic" in parentheses is 
that I will not prove that part of the statement, proving only that the equivariant 
diffeomorphism type of the symplectic manifold is determined by the polyhedron. 
The proof I give here is the original proof of [39]. 
Let p E p,(W) be a point of the polyhedron P and let F be the face the relative 
interior of which p belongs to. From Proposition IV.4.16, we know that p,-l(F) is 
a symplectic submanifold acted on by a half-dimensional torus Tk. Moreover, its 
normal bundle is trivial. Using action-angle coordinates (see Theorem III.3.3), we 
get: 
-
-
Proposition W.4.21. Let U be a small open ball centered at p, such that u = Un F 
is a relatively open ball in F. Then a neighborhood of J.t-1(U) is diffeomorphic to 
Tk x U X B2n-2k(e) C Tt X U X Cn- k 
(6) This is not always the case that there exist global action-angle coordinates over the set of regu-
lar values of an integrable system. See, for instance, the references about the spherical pendulum 
given in Exercise III.22.

The next lemma will allow us to glue these data together. 
Lemma Iv.4.22. Let <p be a diffeomorphism ofTk x U X S2n-2k-l(E) such that 
-
i.p is Tn -equivariant, 
-
J.l 0 <p = J.l. 
Then <p can be extended to a diffeomorphism 0 of Tk X U X B 2n- 2k (E) having the 
same properties. 
Proof The diffeomorphism <p has the form 
<p(B, J, Zl,···, Zn-k) = (B + Bo, J, 'l/Jl, ... , 'l/Jn-k) 
with I'l/Jj 12 = IZj 12 and 
'l/Jj (B, J, UlZl, ... , Un-kZn-k) = Uj'l/Jj (B, J, Zl, ... , Zn-k). 
We look at the function 'l/Jl. We have, for (Xl, ... , Xn-k) real, 
l'l/Jl(B,J,Xl"",Xn-k)12 = IXll2 
and 
'l/Jl (B, J, -Xl, ... , Xn-k) = -'l/Jl ((), J, Xl, ... , Xn-k) 
so that the function f defined by

125 
is an even smooth function of each of its entries x j's, from the sphere sn-k-l (E) to 
the circle Sl. According to a classical result of Whitney, we deduce the existence 
of a smooth function g, defined on the simplex 
n-k

Xl ~ 0, ... ,Xn - k ~ 0,

taking its values in Sl, and such that 
f((}, J, Xl,·'" Xn-k) = Xlg((}, J, xi,···, X~_k) 
= Xl exp(ih((}, J, xi,···, X~_k))' 
Now, for any (complex) (Zl,"" Zn-k) in the sphere, we have 
'ljJl ((}, J, Zl,···, Zn-k) = Zl exp(ih((}, J, Zl,···, Zn-k)) 
a formula which allows us to extend 'ljJl (and analogously, the other 'ljJj's). 
D 
Proof of the (equivariant diffeomorphism assertion of the) theorem 
The proof of Delzant's uniqueness theorem now proceeds as follows. We cover 
the polyhedron P by open subsets 
such that 
P = U 
Ui,F where the F are the faces, 
i,F 
Ui,F n Uj,FI = 0 for F =f. F', 
o 
Ui,F n F is relatively closed in the relative interior F and we have, over 
Ui,F, coordinates as in Proposition IV.4.21. 
-
Ui,F n (Uj>iUj,F) contains the image of the Tk x (Ui,F n F) X s2n-2k-1 (E) 
contained in the neighborhood of /-L-l(Ui,F n F used in Lemma IV.4.22. 
The mentioned proposition gives an equivariant diffeomorphism 
compatible with the momentum mappings, while the mentioned lemma allows us 
to glue these diffeomorphisms by stages. 
D 
IVA.f. The Kahler case. Assume now that we have a (compact) torus acting 
in a Hamiltonian way on a compact Kahler manifold W. In addition to being 
symplectic, our manifold is now endowed with a Riemannian metric and a complex 
structure, all this being compatible, as we have said in § II.2.b. We require the torus 
action to preserve also the Riemannian metric, namely we ask that the torus act 
by isometries. Because of all the compatibility assumptions, this implies that the 
complex structure also is preserved. 

126 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
Hence our torus acts by automorphisms of the complex manifold. This implies 
that the action extends to a complex torus action, either because we know that 
the group of automorphisms of a complex manifold is a complex Lie group, or, 
more concretely, as follows. We consider Tn as the compact torus in the complex 
torus 
(c*)n = {(eU1tl. ... , eUntn) I (t1,"" tn) E Tn and Ui E R} ~ R n x Tn. 
Let Xj be the fundamental vector field associated with the action of the j-th 
circle {( 1, ... , 1, tj, 1, ... , 1} in Tn, consider the flow cpl of the vector field J X j 
and define 
(eU1tl,"" eUntn) . x = (<P~l 0'" 0 <p~J((h, ... , tn) . x) 
(this is well-defined because we have assumed the manifold to be compact). The Lie 
Figure 8 
algebra of Tn is a copy tn of Rn. That of (c*)n is C n, decomposed as Rn x tn, so 
that the fundamental vector field associated with (Y, X) E Rn x Rn is X + JY. In 
this situation, Atiyah proves, in [7], a refinement of his convexity theorem IVA.3. 
Theorem IV.4.23. 
Let W be a compact connected K iihler manifold endowed with 
the Hamiltonian action of a compact torus Tn, with momentum mapping 
J.l:W~Rn. 
Let V C W be an orbit of the complexified action of the complex torus (c*)n and 
let V be its closure. Let ZI, ... ,Zk be the components of the set of fixed points of 
Tn in W which intersect V. Then J.l(V) is the convex hull of the points Ci = J.l(Zi) 
in Rn. 
Proof We can (and thus will) assume that the components of J.l are independent 
functions on V (otherwise, we consider an independent subset). We are thus as-
suming that dim V = 2n = 2 dim Tn and that Tn (or a quotient of Tn by a finite 
group) acts freely on V, or that the restriction of J.l to V is submersive. 

IV.4. APPLICATION TO CONVEXITY THEOREMS 
127 
We consider, as in the proof of Theorem IV.4.3, the components Ji of J.L and 
the Morse-Bott function 
n 
J = ~Adi. 
i=l 
Notice that the gradient of J (with respect to the Riemannian metric which is part 
of the Kahler structure) is 
gradJ = JXj 
and its gradient flow <.pt is the action of the corresponding one-parameter subgroup 
in (c*)n. 
Let now x be any point of the orbit V. We look at the limit points of <.pt(x) 
for t -Y 00. Notice that, at a limit point, the vector field must vanish, so that the 
limit points are critical points. 
Lemma w'4.24. The limit lim t---> 00 (<.pt (x)) exists and is the supremum of J on v. 
Proof of the lemma. We look at the function 
R --------) R 
t 1-----+ J(<.pt(x)), 
clearly an increasing function. As this is also a bounded function, it has a limit 
for t -Y +00, which is equal to J(x oo ), for Xoo a limit point. Now J is constant on 
the component, say Z, of its critical points to which Xoo belongs. Moreover, Z is 
an invariant submanifold for the (C*)n-action. Hence, 
for any z E (c*)n, 
so that, V being an orbit, f(x oo ) does not depend on anything and we have 
J(xoo ) = sup J(x). 
D 
xEV 
Back to the proof of the theorem, we choose the Ai'S so that the function J is 
generic and the torus it generates is the whole Tn. Then the critical submanifold 
Z above is one of the Zj's. We thus have 
sup J(x) = sup J(Zj) 
xEV 
j=l, ... ,k 
and we have proved that J.L(V) is contained in the convex hull P of Cl, ... , Ck. 
Let us prove the reverse inclusion. Let x be a point of V. We want to find 
a neighborhood of J.L(x) in P which is contained in the image J.L(V). Let J be 
the distance of J.L(x) to the boundary of P. Recall that we are assuming J.L to be 
submersive on V, so that J.L(x) must be an interior point of P and J a positive

For t = 0, we are at x and h(x) = O. Then the function increases along the

unique point <p~.\(x) of the trajectory. This gives us a number t), and A ........ t), is 
a continuous function of A. Look now at the vectors Y in Rn that have the form

For any point ( E au', there is a A (with IIAII = 1) such that L Ai(i = 8/2 
and in particular 11(11 ~ 8/2, so that the ball centered at 0 with radius 8/2 is 
contained in U'. We have thus proved that the interior of P is contained in the

IV.4.g. Application: a theorem of Kushnirenko on monomial equations. 
We prove the theorem of Kushnirenko, stated in the introduction of this book, as 
a consequence of Theorem IV.4.23. This proof, written in [8], is due to Arnold and 
Khovanski. 
Consider a finite set S c zn of multi-exponents and the system of n equations 
and n unknowns: 
OtEB 
where 1 :::; j :::; n, the parameters c1, are complex and the unknown z sits in the 
complex torus (c*)n. 
Theorem Iv.4.25. The number of solutions of 
L~zOt =0 
OtEB 
for a general enough choice of the coefficients c1, is 
N{S) = n!Vol{S) 
where S denotes the convex hull of S in Rn. 
Proof Let m be the cardinality of Sand ao, . .. ,am-I be its elements. We consider 
the action of the complex torus {c*)n on Cm by 
z· (uo, ... , Um-I) = (zOt° UO , .•. , zOtm-1 Um_I). 
The orbit of the point (1, ... , 1) is a faithful orbit (the orbit map is injective) if 
and only if the elements of S generate the lattice zn. 
In order to use Theorem IV.4.23, we need a torus action on a compact Kahler 
manifold, so that we will rather look at the same torus acting, by the same formula, 
on pm-I{C) and at the orbit Vs of the point [1, ... ,1]. In order that Vs be a 
faithful orbit, we need that the set 
{a -,81 a,,8 E S} 
generate the lattice zn. We will assume, to begin with, that this is true. Our 
number of solutions is then exactly the number of intersection points of VB (an 
open complex variety of complex dimension n) with the codimension-n projective 
subspace P{E) defined by the linear equations 
L ~ZOt = 0 j = 1, ... ,no 
OtES 

130 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
We assume the coefficients to be generic, so that the intersection is transversal. 
Now the closure ofVs is an algebraic subvariety of pm-l (C) (I will not discuss here 
the question of whether this is (or is not) a smooth submanifold of the projective 
space, see §VIL2.c), we have 
dime (V s - Vs) < n, 
so that the "boundary" does not intersect the generic projective space P(E). 
Let w be the standard(7) Kahler form on pm-l(C), so that the cohomology 
class dual to P(E) is [w]n and that our number of intersection points is 
N(S) = ( wn=n!Vol(Vs) 
Jvs 
(recall from Remark 11.1.8 that wn In! is the Riemannian volume element). What 
the refined theorem IV.4.23 tells us is that the restriction of the momentum map-

Vol(Vs) = Vol(Tn) Vol (p) = Vol(S) 
since Tn has volume 1 (see Remark IIL3.9). Eventually, we have got the expected 
relation. .. under the assumption that the a - f3 generate zn. If this is not true, 
this may be because 
- they generate a lattice of rank < n, in this case both sides of the equality 
we want to prove vanish: 
• the convex hull S is contained in a hyperplane, thus has volume zero, 
while 
• the orbit is too small and does not intersect the codimension-n sub-
space when the ~'s are general enough, hence N(S) = OJ 
- or because they generate a lattice A of rank n, so that r = zn I A is a 
finite group. We can work with the torus Rn I A instead of our original 
Tn = R n Izn and multiply both sides of the equation by the order of r. 0

IV.5. Appendix: compact symplectic SU(2)-manifolds of dimension 4 
In this appendix, we give a classification of the compact symplectic manifolds of 
dimension 4 endowed with a symplectic action of SU(2). The classification is, in 
essence, due to Iglesias [70], who actually considered the group SO(3), but the case 
of SU(2) is a little easier and a little less technical, that is why we have chosen 
it (the SO(3)-case will be presented in Exercise IV.18). As we have done in the 
case of Delzant's theorem (here Theorem IV.4.20), we shall not worry about the 
symplectic forms, but we shall concentrate instead on the manifolds with action. 
Recall that SU(2) is the group of matrices 
SU(2) = { (: -;) IIxl2 + lyl2 = I} 
from which description it is easy to recognize that the manifold SU(2) is diffeo-
morphic to S3. 
IV.5.a. A list of examples. We start from the standard linear action of SU(2) 
on C2 and from the induced action on pI (C). 
The complex projective space. We can of course compactify C2 into the projective 
plane P2(C) by adding to it a projective line PI(C) at infinity. The SU(2)-action 
extends. It can also be described as the action of the subgroup 
SU(2) c U(2) c U(3) c GL(3; C) 
on P2(C). This is of course a symplectic action and thus a Hamiltonian action(8) 
(SU(2) is semi-simple) and it is effective. Notice that the origin of C2, alias the 
point [0,0,1] E P2(C), is a fixed point. 
SU(2)-actions on bundles over pI (C). Still starting from the linear action on C2, 
we can also cross C2 by a copy of C on which SU(2) acts trivially and twist 
everything by an SI-action. We look at the quotient S3 x 81 C, where 
u· ((a, b)z) = ((ua, ub), u-mz) for some m E Z. 
The space itself is a complex line bundle over PI(C), via the projection mapping 
[(a,b),zll-----t [a,bl. 
The SU(2)-action descends to the quotient so that we have a space E_m with an 
SU(2)-action. This action is effective if and only if m is odd. If 
(g. (a, b), z) = ((ua, ub), u-mz) for some u E s1, 
(R)The IllOIllentuIll Illapping can be deduced froIll Exercise III.8. 

132 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
then (a, b) must be an eigenvector of g. If 9 = ± rd, all the vectors are eigenvectors 
and 
(- Id ·(a, b), z) = ((-a, -b)), z) if and only if m is even. 
Note that if this is the case, we get an effective action of SU(2)/ {± Id} = SO(3). 
Obviously, the points of the zero section (z = 0) have stabilizer SI (and the zero 
section is an orbit) while the other points have stabilizer Z/m (which is thus 
the principal stabilizer). The manifold E_m can also be considered as a complex 
submanifold of a product pl(C) x C N (N = 2m). The mapping 
defines an embedding 
S3 x C --+ pl(C) x (c2)®m 
(v, z) 1-----+ ([v], z(v 0··· 0 v)) 
S3 XSl C = E_m <------+ pl(C) X (c2)®m 
and our action of SU(2) is just the restriction of the diagonal action 
SU(2) X (Pl(C) X (C2)®m) --+ pl(C) X (c2)®m 
(A,.e, w) 1-----+ (A·.e, A®m . w). 
The symplectic form on C2 being SU(2)-invariant, the usual product Kahler form 
will be invariant as well. 
To make E_m a compact manifold, we glue to it a copy of Ern by the map 
[(a, b), z]1-----+ [(a, b), z-l] for z "# o. 
The resulting compact SU(2)-manifold Wm is the quotient 
Wm = S3 XSl pl(C) 
under the SI-action 
u· ((a, b)[x, y]) = ((ua, ub), [x, umy]). 
This is a bundle over pI (C), the fibers themselves projective lines(9). The bundle 
has two sections, "at zero" and "at infinity", both are orbits with stabilizer SI. 
All the other orbits have stabilizer Z/m. 
The embedding of E_m into Pl(C) X (C2)®m extends to an embedding 
Wm <------+ pl(C) X P((c2)®m Eli C) 
(v, [x,y]) 1-----+ ([v],[x(v0···0v),y]). 
(9)This is the bundle P(C>(m) $ 1), a complex manifold called a Hirzebruch surface, see Exer-
cises IVA and IV.17. 

IV.5. APPENDIX: SU(2)-MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
133 
As above, the standard Kahler form is SU(2)-invariant and thus defines an invari-
ant symplectic form on Wm . The SU(2)-action cannot refrain from being Hamilto-
nian. We will not need it explicitly, but it is easy to write the momentum mapping 
for this action (this is Exercise IV.16). 
Which gives us a list of compact symplectic manifolds of dimension 4 endowed 
with an effective Hamiltonian action: P2(C) and the Hirzebruch surfaces Wm (for 
odd m). Notice that (this is proved in Exercise IV.17) all the Wm's for m odd are 
diffeomorphic with P2(C), the projective plane blown up at a point. However the 
SU(2)-actions are different (have different principal stabilizers, for instance). 
IV.5.h. Classification. We assume now that W is a compact symplectic mani-
fold of dimension 4 endowed with an effective symplectic action of SU(2). We will 
assume that the momentum mapping 
J.L : W -----t 5u(2)* 
is submersive at at least one point in W. We investigate the orbit types in W. 
Principal orbits. From Proposition III.2.1O, we know that the principal stabilizer 
is both discrete and a closed subgroup of the maximal torus 
Hence this is a cyclic group Z/m. We deduce that principal orbits have dimension 3. 
Exceptional orbits. The exceptional orbits have dimension 3 as well. Let x be a 
point in such an orbit. We know that 
KerTxJ.L = (Tx(SU(2)· x)t, 
so that dim Ker T xJ.L = 1 and J.L is submersive at x. Moreover, the image of an orbit 
of dimension 3 has dimension 2 and is contained in a coadjoint orbit in 5u(2)*. 
This is thus a sphere S2 C 5u(2)*; hence the stabilizer of the orbit is a subgroup 
of the stabilizer of this point in the sphere. This is thus also a cyclic group, Z/q, 
say. According to the slice theorem, a neighborhood of an orbit with stabilizer 
Z/q has the form SU(2) xZ/q R. The cyclic group Z/q acts on R, either trivially 
or (only if q is even)by ± rd. Notice that, in the case of a nontrivial action, the 
manifold would not be orientable, so that the Z/ q-action on R must be trivial. All 
the orbits in such a neighborhood have stabilizer Z/q, therefore q = m and there 
are no exceptional orbits. 
SingUlar orbits. On the contrary, there are singular orbits. Consider a circle sub-
group S1 C SU(2). The corresponding Hamiltonian H must have critical points 
on the compact manifold W. Let x be such a point. This is a fixed point of the 
8 1-action and thus its stabilizer (for the SU(2)-action) contains our 8 1 , so that 

134 
CHAPTER IV. MORSE THEORY FOR HAMILTONIANS 
the orbit of x is singular. The stabilizer of a point x is a subgroup of the stabilizer 
of J1.(x) for the coadjoint action, and this is a circle unless J1.(x) = O. Moreover, if 
this is the case, the orbit of x is isotropic, because 
T ASU(2) . x) C KerT xJ1. = {T x(SU(2) . x)V . 
Either the stabilizer of x is the whole group SU(2), x is a fixed point, or it is 
a closed subgroup of dimension 1, so that the orbit of x has dimension 2 and is 
Lagrangian. 
The stabilizer of a singular orbit which is not a fixed point is a closed 
dimension-1 subgroup H of SU(2), that is, a subgroup covering SO(2) or 0(2) 
by the restriction of the covering map 
cp : SU(2) --7 SO(3). 
The singular orbit has a neighborhood (once again the slice theorem) of the form 
SU(2) XH R2, where H acts on R2 
- as 0(2) is cp(H) = 0(2), 
- as 8\ either by u· z = uz or by u· z = u2z. 
Except in the case of the standard 8 1-action, this gives an open subset of W 
on which the SU(2)-action is not effective, in contradiction with the assumptions 
made (see, if necessary, Exercise 1.7). 
The dimension-2 singular orbits are thus spheres. Moreover, such a sphere 
cannot be Lagrangian. Otherwise, it would have a neighborhood both of the form 
SU(2) XSl R2, with 8 1 acting on R2 by rotations (the slice theorem, plus effec-
tiveness) and of the form T* 8 2 (the Darboux theorem, see § II.l.c). But these two 
bundles over 8 2 are not diffeomorphic (as manifolds), the former has Euler class 
±1 while the Euler class of the latter is ±2. 
Notice eventually that a singular orbit which is not mapped to 0 by J1. is a 
sphere and is mapped to a symplectic sphere 8 2 C 5u(2)* by the immersive Poisson 
mapping J1. (T xJ1. is injective when restricted to the orbit) and hence is a symplectic 
submanifold of W. 
We summarize these remarks in a proposition. 
Proposition IV.5.l. A singular orbit of an effective symplectic SU(2)-action on a 
4-dimensional compact manifold with somewhere submersive momentum mapping 
J1. is 
either an isolated fixed point, mapped to 0 by J1., 
or a symplectic sphere mapped on a nontrivial sphere in 5u(2)*. 
0 
Remark Jv.5.2. Notice that we have proved that there is no Lagrangian orbit. In 
the case of the group SO(3), such orbits can appear. For example if we make it 
act as a subgroup (the real part) of SU(3) C U(3) on P2(C), the real part P2(R) 

IV.5. APPENDIX: SU(2)-MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4

is a Lagrangian orbit [70j. This is the small difference which makes the investi-
gation of SU(2)-actions a little easier than that of SO(3)-actions. See, however, 
Exercise IV.18. 
To deduce a classification theorem, we look at the "square of the momentum 
mapping" function. 
Lemma Jv.S.3. The function f = ! IIMI12 : W ---t [0, +oo[ is a quotient map for the 
SU(2)-action on W. 
Proof. We know, thanks to the slice theorem and to the study of orbits and their 
stabilizers above that the quotient will be a manifold with boundary, of dimen-
sion 1, the ends corresponding to the singular orbits. If we assume W to be con-
nected, this must be a compact interval and there are exactly two singular orbits. 
The function f descends to the quotient as 
g: WI SU(2) ~ 
[0, +00[, 
a smooth function from one interval to another. Computing its tangent mapping 
Txf(Y) = M(X)' TxM(Y), 
we see that, if x is a fixed point with M(x) =f. 0, then 
Y E KerTxf ¢:? TxM(Y) E M(X)l. = TJl(x)82 
where 82 is the coadjoint orbit of M{X). Hence Txf vanishes exactly when x is on 
a singular orbit, and 9 is strictly monotone, which shows that f may be identified 
with the quotient mapping. 
D 
Remark Jv.S.4. The map 
.5u(2)* ~ 
[0, +oo[ 
A f-----* ! IIAI12 
is a quotient map itself (see Exercise I.16). 
Let [a, bl = f(W) and let c E la, b[. Then the maximum f-l(b) is a symplectic 
sphere, f-1([c,b]) is a tubular neighborhood of this sphere, given by the slice 
theorem and so this is an E(±m) used in our list above (Iml, odd, is the order of 
the principal stabilizer). There are only two possibilities: 
- Either a > 0, then f-1([a,c]) is an E(n) as well, necessarily Iml = Inl and 
actually n = -m in order to be able to glue, so that W is a Hirzebruch 
surface Wm . 
- Or a = 0, then f-l(a) is an isolated fixed point near which the SU(2)-
action is the standard linear action on C2. In particular, Iml = 1 and W is 
obtained by gluing a disc to E±l) so that W is a copy of p2(C).

in the examples considered here). It nevertheless has minimal degeneracies (in a 
precise sense), investigated by Frances Kirwan [85] who used it as the main tool 
in, for instance, her proof of the noncommutative convexity theorem [86].

- the group SU(2) has no fixed point in 62.

CHAPTER V 
MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
In this chapter, we consider the moduli space of flat connections on a (trivial) 
bundle over a surface (defined in §V.l). There is a Hamiltonian group action that 
allows us to endow this space with a Poisson structure, as we show in §V.2 (this 
is due to Atiyah and Bott [10] in the case of a closed surface and to Fock and 
Roslyi [50] in the general case of a surface with boundary). We then look at a 
special case in § V.3, in which there is an integrable system (due to Goldman [56]) 
on the moduli space. Following Jeffrey and Weitsman [77], we exhibit a torus 
action and its momentum mapping, that is, action-angle variables for this system. 
V.l. The moduli space of flat connections 
The moduli space that I want to consider is that of flat connections on the trivial 
principal G-bundle on a surface E, namely on the bundle 
P=Gx~----7~ 
endowed with the natural action of G on itself by left translations. The surface E 
is supposed to be compact and oriented, but may (and will often) have a bound-
ary 8E. The genus of ~ will be denoted by g and the number of boundary com-
ponents by d. 
The group G is a Lie group. I will use (and thus assume the existence of) a 
nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form 13 on the Lie algebra 9 which is invariant 
under the adjoint G-action. Such a form certainly exists when G is a compact Lie 
group. The example I have in mind is mainly that of SU (n), so that I will usually 
assume in addition that G is simply connected-although I will also use SI. 
I will consider only the trivial bundle P = G x E. Notice that this is not 
a very big restriction: when the group G is simply connected, all the principal 
G-bundles on E are trivializable. They are classified(l) by the homotopy classes 
(l)See §VI.l for the definition and construction of the classifying space BG. 

148 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
of maps E ~ BG. If 1l'1(G) is trivial, then because 1l'2 of a group is always trivial 
(this is a theorem of Cartan [33]), Gis 2-connected and BG is 3-connected. For 
a surface E, any continuous map E ~ BG is thus homotopic to a constant map 
and any principal G-bundle is trivializable. However, in the case of S1, we know 
perfectly well that there are nontrivial principal S1-bundles over surfaces. In any 
case, to simplify notation, we will assume that a trivialization is given and fixed. 
Being trivialized, our bundle carries a canonical "trivial" connection(2), the 
horizontal subspace of which at (g, x) E G x E is 
Notice that, although the space of connections has only the natural structure of 
an affine space, the space of connections on the trivial bundle can be considered 
as a vector space (see § VA): the chosen trivialization is used as an origin. 
The curvature mapping. Following Atiyah and Bott, we will consider the cur-
vature as a mapping F from the vector space of connections on P to that of 2-forms 
with values in g, 
We shall need to compute its tangent mapping. 
Proposition V.I. I. Let A be a connection and <p E ~V(E, g). Then 
F(A + <p) = F(A) + dA<P + [<p, <pl. 
Corollary V.1.2. For any connection A and any g-valued I-form <p, one has 
D 
Proof of the proposition. Using the definition of F via the vertical projection V 
(see §VA), 
F(A + <p)(X, Y) = VA+cp([hA+cp(X), VA+cp(Y)]), 
Obviously (see Figure 11), for any vector field X on E, 
and for any invariant vector field Z on P, 
(2)The basic definitions and results used here are gathered in § V.4 

V.l. THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
149 
A direct computation gives, for F(A + cp)(X, Y), 
VA+'P ([hA(X), hA(Y)] + [hA(X), cp(Y)] + [cp(X), hA(Y)] + [cp(X) , cp(Y)]) 
= VA[hA(X), hA(Y)]- cp[X, Y] 
+ VA[hA(X), cp(Y)]- cp 0 1f[hA(X), cp(Y)] 
+ VA[cp(X),hA(Y)]- CP 0 1f[cp(X),hA(Y)] 
+ [cp(X), cp(Y)] 
= F(A)(X, Y) + VA[hA(X), cp(Y)]- VA[hA(Y), cp(X)] 
- cp[X, Y] + [cp(X), cp(Y)] 
= F(A)(X, Y) + V~cp(Y) - V¢(X) - cp[X, Y] + [cp(X), cp(Y)] 
= F(A)(X, Y) + dACP(X, Y) + [cp, cp](X, Y). 
o 
Flat (integrable) connections. A flat connection is a connection without cur-
vature (that is, an A such that F(A) = 0). Notice that this means that the bracket 
of any two horizontal vector fields is again a horizontal vector field, so that the 
horizontal distribution is integrable in the (Frobenius) sense that it is at each 
point, the tangent distribution to a submanifold through this point. This is why 
flat connections are sometimes called integrable. 
The gauge group. The gauge group is the group 9 of automorphisms of the 
bundle. Still using the trivialization, we can identify it with the (functional) group 
of all the mappings ~ ---7 G. Similarly, its Lie algebra g is that of all mappings 
~ ---7 g. The gauge group acts on A, (traditionally on the right) by 
g. A = g-l Ag + g-ldg 
where "g-ldg" is a symbolic notation for the I-form on ~ with values in 9 defined 
by 
To get the fundamental vector field Q. associated to both the element 0: E g 
and the g-action, we only need to differentiate. We find that this is the vector 
field, defined on A by 
The holonomy. Assume we are given a connection A on our bundle P. Let p 
be any point in P and x be its image in ~. For any differentiable loop "y based 
at x in ~, the existence and uniqueness theorem for differential equations gives a 
unique lift ;:y starting at p and horizontal in the sense that the tangent vector -;Yet) 

150 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
is horizontal for any t. This lifted path ends at some point of the fiber of x, which 
can be written g. p for some element g E G, which is the bolonomy of the loop 'Y. 
Figure 1 
The subgroup of G consisting of all elements obtained this way is called the 
bolonomy group of the connection A at the point p. Using the fact that our spaces 
are path-connected, it is easily seen that all the holonomy groups (when p varies 
in P) are conjugated subgroups of G. This is why it is usually spoken of as "the" 
holonomy group. 
Assume now that the connection A is fiat. As we have noticed above, the 
horizontal distribution is integrable, so that any differentiable map from a disc to 
the surface I; can be lifted horizontally. Hence any loop 'Y which is homotopic to 
a constant loop in I; lifts to a loop in P and thus has trivial holonomy. 
The holonomy (or monodromy) representation is thus a map 
p: 7f1(I;,x) ----) G 
well-defined up to conjugation. 
Conversely, it is not hard to construct, from any conjugacy class of such map, 
a gauge equivalence class of flat connections over I; x G. 
The moduli space. The space M we want to consider is the quotient of the 
space Afl of flat connections by the gauge group action: 
M = Aflj(]. 
Example V.I.3. Assume G = Sl, so that 9 = R, the Lie bracket is trivial and dA 
is just the ordinary exterior derivative d, the curvature is dA. Remember that the 
bundle is trivial, so that the curvature of any connection must be an exact form 
on I; (see § V.4 and more precisely Remark V.4.6). Flat connections are closed 
1-forms, the gauge group acts by translations 
g . A = A + g -1 dg = A + g * (J 

V.l. THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
151 
where a is the form dz / z on S 1. Thus M is the quotient of the space of closed 
I-forms by the equivalence relation defined by the above translations, namely 
M = Hl(E; Sl). 
From the set-theoretical or topological viewpoints, the space is quite easy to 
describe (even if this does not mean that it is very simple). We assign to each flat 
connection its holonomy as explained above. This gives a one-to-one correspon-
dence between the moduli space M and the quotient Hom(1l"l S, G)/ Ad G. This 
even describes M as a topological space(3), at least if the group G is compact ... 
and I will only use the case of Sl and that of SU(n). 
Singularities. The space Hom(1l"lE, G) is itself often singular if the surface E is 
closed (d = 0). In this case, the fundamental group has a presentation with 2g 
generators and one relation 
1l"lE = (al,"" ag, bl , ... , bg; al bl a1"l b1"l ... agbga;lb;l), 
so that Hom(1l"lE, G) is the hypersurface 
{(AI,"" Ag, Bl , ... , Bg) E G2g I AlBlA1"l Bll ... AgBgA;l B;l = Id} C G2g, 
a singular hypersurface in general. 
Even when the boundary of E is not empty (that is, when d ~ 1) and 
Hom(1l"lE, G) is smooth, the G-action is not locally free, so that M is almost 
always singular, although it is Hausdorff, according to Proposition I.1.11 as we 
assume that G is compact. 
Regular points correspond to representations p, the centralizer in G of which 
has the same dimension as the center of G. In the case of Sl or SU(n), these 
correspond to irreducible representations. I will ignore singularities in what follows 
and refer the interested readers to Goldman's paper [55]. 
There are points at which the action is principal. The dimension of the moduli 
space is then 
(2g + d -1)dimG - dimG = (2g - 2 + d)dimG. 
Remark V.l.4. If BE is not empty, 1l"1 (E) is a free group on 2g + d - 1 generators 
(recall that g is the genus of E and d ~ 1 is the number of components of the 
boundary) and Hom(1l"lE, G) is the product of 2g + d - 1 copies of G. 
This shows, among other things, that different surfaces may give moduli 
spaces which are homeomorphic: it depends only on 2g + d - 1. For instance the 
sphere with three holes (g = 0, d = 3) and the torus with one hole (g = 1, d = 1) 
shown in Figure 2 both give G x G/ Ad G as moduli spaces. We shall see, however, 
(3)Strictly speaking, to use 7l"1(~), we need to have chosen a base point. However, the space 
Hom(7rlS, G)I Ad G is independent of this choice, because we have factored out by conjugation. 

152 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
that these two spaces are endowed with natural Poisson structures which are quite 
different. 
Figure 2 
I will use these simple examples of surfaces, but also the simple example of 
the group SI already mentioned to illustrate the constructions. 
Example v'1.5. Let us now come back to a general surface of genus g with d holes 
and suppose that G = SI. The commutativity of the group leads to two important 
simplifications. Firstly, the Ad G action is trivial, so that the moduli space is simply 
Hom(7rI2:, SI). Secondly, the group 7r12: has a presentation 
~lE ~ ( aJ, ... , ag, ~l"" '~9' ~J, ••. , ~d; J1 ~j II (a;~;ail~il)) 
with a single relation, involving commutators, so that 
1 
{ (SI )29 
if d = 0 
Hom(7rI2:, S ) = 
(SI )29 X (SI )d-l if d?: l. 
This is of course the same thing as above (Example V.l.3), where we had found 
that the moduli space M was HI (2:; SI) in this case, except that here we have 
used a basis. 
Remark V,I.6. This moduli space can be considered as a topological version of the 
Jacobian. See for instance [119, 60]. 
The case of SU(2), the polyhedra of Jeffrey and Weitsman. Let us con-
centrate on the case where G = SU(2). We begin with a few specific features of 
the moduli space M in this case: 
- Recall that all the elements of SU(2) are diagonalizable. More precisely, for 
any A E SU(2), there is a unitary basis of C 2 in which A takes the form 
A rv (e
iO °0 ) 
o e-' 

V.l. THE MODULI SPACE OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
153 
for some real number 0 E [0, 1TJ, and, provided A :f:. ± Id (which is equivalent 
to tr A :f:. ±2), the stabilizer of A in SU(2) is simply the 8 1 involved in the 
choice of the first eigenvector. 
- As the group SU(2) is compact, the regular points of M correspond to the 
irreducible representations of 1T1E. 
- Moreover, there are rather few singular points: if all the matrices have a 
common eigenvector, they must have a second one, since the second eigen-
line is just the orthogonal complement of the first. In other words, they are 
diagonalizable in the same basis-and in particular they commute. 
Let me make the last remark more precise. Assume that 
is a reducible representation. Let Ml, ... , Md be the images in SU(2) of the loops 
around the holes of E. As the image of p is commutative, the relation in 1T1E gives 
only M1 ... Md = Id. Write now all the Mj's in a common basis of eigenvectors 
for €j = ±1 (recall that I assume OJ E [0, 1T]), so that the relation becomes simply 
L€jOj == 0 mod 21T. 
Example v.l. 7 (The three holed sphere). Consider the case where E is a sphere with 
three holes (g = 0, d = 3). The moduli space is 
By conjugation, it may be assumed that

is then (ei01 a) = cos (}3, or 
cos (}l cos (}2 + sin (}l sin (}2 cos f3 = cos (}3' 
This is reminiscent of spherical trigonometry: one may solve this for cos f3 if and 
only if (}l, (}2 and (}3 are the lengths of the edges of a spherical triangle (see 
Figure 3). The representation is irreducible if and only if the triangle is an actual 
triangle, so that we can state: 
Proposition V.1.8. 
The moduli space MO,3(SU(2)) can be identified with the set of 
isometry classes of spherical triangles. The map

Lest us make a remark about this seemingly trivial example: the singularities 
of MO,3 are indeed those of the tetrahedron (namely the boundary points). 
V.2. A Poisson structure on the moduli space of flat connections 
We prove now that the space of flat connections, modulo gauge equivalence, is 
endowed with a Poisson structure. 
A summary of notation. The Lie group is G, its Lie algebra is g, the latter 
is endowed with an invariant nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form, that is, a 
linear map 
~:g 0 g----tR. 
The gauge group is g, its Lie algebra g. If a E g = nl(E;g), !K denotes the 
associated fundamental vector field on A. The moduli space is M and also Aft/g, 

V.2. A POISSON STRUCTURE ON THE MODULI SPACE 
155 
but this M is only a shorthand for MdG), or Mg,d(G) (if 9 is the genus of ~ and 
d the number of components of the boundary 8~), or Mg,d if the group is clear. 
V.2.a. The symplectic form on A. Following Atiyah and Bott, one defines 
a skew-symmetric bilinear form on the vector space A, that can be written, as a 
differential form, as: 
WA(<p,7jJ) = h 
13*('1' 1\ 7jJ). 
Notice that W is "constant" (this is just a bilinear form, WA does not depend on A) 
so that it is closed: this is a good reason to use the infinite dimensional description 
here; in the usual(4) finite dimensional descriptions, it is rather hard to prove that 
the forms obtained are closed (see [56] and [82]). 
In the above formula, one considers the product of forms 
1\ : 0* (~, g) ® 0* (~, g) ------. 0* (~, 9 ® g) 
and 13* as a mapping 
It is obvious that W is nondegenerate (being defined by two nondegenerate objects: 
the form 13 and the pairing of I-forms on the surface). Now, A is a symplectic 
(vector or affine) space. 
The purpose of this section is to understand what structure the form W defines 
on M. We will prove: 
Theorem V.2.I. 
The symplectic form W on A defines a Poisson structure on the 
moduli space M, the symplectic leaves of which are obtained by fixing the conjugacy 
classes of the holonomies along the components of the boundary of~. 
V.2.h. Symplectic properties of the gauge group action. The gauge group 
action preserves the symplectic form (because it is defined by the invariant form 13): 
(g*W)A(<p,7jJ) = Wg·A (T Ag(<p), T Ag(7jJ)) 
= WA (g-l<pg,g-l7jJg) as the Q-action on A is affine 
= h 
13*((g-l<pg) 1\ (g-l7jJg)) 
= WA(<p,7jJ). 
What we would like to do now is to write that the action is Hamiltonian 
and to describe its momentum mapping. We thus want to find, for any a E g, 
(4) See also the Fock and Roslyi description in [50,17]. 

156 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
a function Ha, the Hamiltonian vector field of which is the fundamental vector 
field Q and such that the mapping 
is a morphism of Lie algebras (the Lie algebra structure on eOO(A) is that defined 
by the Poisson bracket associated with w). 
Atiyah and Bott have shown in [10] that, if 8~ = 0, a solution to this 
problem is given by 
Ha(A) = ~ B* (0: /\ F(A)). 
In other words, when ~ has no boundary, the curvature is a momentum mapping 
for the gauge group action. This is a simple consequence of Corollary V.1.2. Here, 
some difficulties will arise from the boundary of ~. 
Proposition V.2.2. For 0: E g = nO(~, g) and A E A, let 
Ha(A) = r 13* (0: /\ F(A)) + r 13*(0: /\ A). 
J~ 
Ja~ 
The Hamiltonian vector field of Ha is the fundamental vector field Q, but 
{Ha, H(3} (A) = H[a,(3] (A) + r 13*(0: /\ d(3).

Proof Our candidate Ha should satisfy 
(T AHa) (<p) = WA(QA, <p)

13* (dAo: /\ <p)

so that the last assertion is a consequence of the invariance of 13. 
D 

V.2. A POISSON STRUCTURE ON THE MODULI SPACE 
157 
The central extension. The formula in the previous proposition shows that the 
mapping a f--7 Ha is not exactly a morphism of Lie algebras. If a, (3 E g, put 
c( a, (3) = r 'B* (a 1\ d(3). 
JaY.:, 
This defines a skew symmetric bilinear form on g, which has the additional prop-
erty of being a cocycle, in the sense that 
c ([a, (3], ')') + c ([(3, ')'], a) + c ([,)" a], (3) = 0 
(direct verification). This gives the idea to consider the vector space g = g Efl R 
and to endow it with the bracket 
[(a, t), ((3, u)] = ([a, (3], c(a, (3)). 
This gives it the structure of a Lie algebra. We have an exact sequence of Lie 
algebras 
o -----t R -----t g -----t g -----t 0 
so that g is an extension of g. As the additional R obviously lies in the center 
of g, this is called a central extension of g. The structure on g was made so that, 
defining H(a,t) (A) = Ha(A) + t, Proposition V.2.2 can be rephrased as: 
Corollary V.2.3. The mapping 
g -----t eoo (A) 
(a, t) ~ 
H(a,t) 
is a morphism of Lie algebras. Moreover, the Hamiltonian vector field of the func-
tion H(a,t) : A ---> R is the vector field Q.. 
0 
The last assertion tells us that g acts infinitesimally on A via the infinitesi-
mal g-action we already know. This remark can be integrated to define a central 
extension 9 of the gauge group itself, acting on A via the gauge action of g. 
What I want to describe now is the momentum mapping for these actions. 
I must first say something about the dual of the Lie algebra g. The proof of the 
next proposition is straightforward. 
Proposition V.2.4. The pairing of 0 2 (~, g) Efl 0 1 (a~, g) Efl R with g by 
(R,rp,z)0(a,t)~ r 'B*(a1\ R) + r 'B*(al\rp)+zt

is nondegenerate. 
o 
In this way, 0 2 (~, g) Efl 0 1 (a~, g) Efl R can be seen as a subspace of g* and 
the previous study can be summarized in:

CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
Corollary V.2.5. The mapping 
J..l : A -----t g* 
A f------+ (F(A), Ala~, 1) 
is a g-equivariant momentum mapping fOT the gauge group action. 
D 
Notice that the central part of 9 does not act on g*, so the statement makes 
sense. 
When the surface ~ is closed, the momentum mapping J..l is just the curvature, 
so that the space of flat connections modulo the gauge group action is a reduced 
level set of a momentum mapping, and thus a symplectic manifold(5), as was 
explained in [10]. In the general case where the surface has boundary components, 
the curvature is the momentum mapping for the action of a smaller group. Let us 
consider the subgroup go of the gauge group g defined by 
go = {g E g I gla~ = I} . 
This is the kernel of the morphism of restriction to the boundary and, in particular, 
this is a normal subgroup. 
Proposition V.2.6. The normal subgroup go of g acts on A with momentum mapping 
A f-t F(A). The space Mo of fiat connections modulo the go-action is symplectic. 
Proof The Lie algebra of go is 
go = {a E g I ala~ = o} 
so that one can embed 
n2(~, g) EB R '--------t go* 
and conclude that the momentum mapping for the go-action is the composed map: 
po J..l : A f------+ (F(A), Ala~, 1) f------+ (F(A), 1) E g5. 
Hence Mo = (p 0 J..l)-l(O, 1)/90 is a symplectic reduced space. 
D 
V.2.c. The Poisson structure and its symplectic foliation. As go is normal 
in g, the gauge group g also acts on Mo, the action preserves the symplectic 
structure, and the quotient Mo/9 is, of course, our moduli space M. Being the 
quotient of a symplectic space by a symplectic group action, it inherits a natural 
(i.e., coming from the form w on A) Poisson structure. The next aim is to describe 
its symplectic foliation. We apply Proposition III.2.22 to the action of g /90 on Mo. 
There is an exact sequence

Let us now identify each component Ci with the circle 8 1, so that OO(Ci;g) ~ 
0°(8\ g) is the Lie algebra Lg of the loop group 
LG = e')O(81, G) ~ eOO(Ci , G). 
We thus have to understand the coadjoint action of the loop group LG on the dual 
~* 
~ 
Lg of the central extension Lg defined by the same co cycle as g above. 
I shall postpone the description of these orbits, and thus the proof of the next 
proposition, to the end of this section. Here is the result: 
Proposition V.2.7. 
The space 0 1 (8 1 , g) EB {I} can be embedded as a subspace in the 
~* 
dual Lg . The map which associates to any form on 8 1 its holonomy along the 
circle gives a one-to-one correspondence from the set of coadjoint orbits of LG in 
0 1 (8 1 , g) EB 1 to the set of conjugacy classes in G. 
Notice that we will eventually have proven Theorem V.2.1. 
D 
Example V.2.8 (The case of 8 1). Consider the case of the group G = 8 1 . Fixing a 
conjugacy class in 8 1 amounts to fixing an element of 8 1 . The symplectic leaves 
in Mg,d = (8 1 )2g X (8 1 )d-1 are the (8 1 )2g X {C1, ... , Cd-1}. 
Example V.2.9 (Different Poisson structures on the same space). Let us turn now to 
our second favorite class of examples (Figure 2), the three holed sphere and the 
one holed torus, that is, the moduli spaces MO,3 and M1,1. As we have already 
noticed, both are copies of G x G / Ad G. 
An element of MO,3 consists of three elements M 1, M2 and M3 E G such 
that M1M2M3 = 1, up to simultaneous conjugation by group elements. To fix a 

160 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
symplectic leaf, we have to fix the conjugacy classes Cl, C2 and C3 of Ml, M2 
and M 3 . It turns out (this is the subject of Exercise V.1) that the map 
Cl xC2 xC3 ~G 
(Ml' M2, M3) I-----t MIM2M3 
has maximal rank at a solution of the equation MIM2M3 = 1 corresponding to an 
irreducible representation. The dimension of the symplectic leaf M~~,C2,C3 is thus 
L:dimCi - 2dimG. 
As for an element of M l ,l, it also consists of three elements A, B, MEG, but 
now the relation is ABA -1 B- 1 M = 1 and, to fix a symplectic leaf, we need only fix 
the conjugacy class C of M. In the same way, it is shown that dim Mf,1 = dim C. 
Generic conjugacy classes have the form G/T for a maximal torus T, and 
thus have dimension dim G - rk G, so that, for G a simple Lie group, the generic 
symplectic leaves have dimension dim G-3 rkG in MO,3 and dim G-rk Gin M l ,l, 
so that the Poisson spaces obtained are indeed very different. 
Example V.2.IO (The case of MO,3(SU(2) ). According to Proposition V.l.8, this 
moduli space is simply the tetrahedron shown in Figure 4. the conjugacy classes 
have dimension 2, so that the symplectic leaves have dimension 0: the Poisson 
structure on the tetrahedron is trivial. Notice that in M l ,I(SU(2)), the leaves have 
dimension 2. We shall see in Example V.3.10 that these leaves are spheres. 
Notice that these computations of dimension work only for a simple Lie 
group. Consider for instance M l ,1 in the case of the commutative group Sl. The 
only conjugacy class giving rise to a nonempty leaf is that of 1, so that M l ,1 (SI) 
is actually symplectic.

Description of the central extension Lg. Identify SI with R/27rZ and define,

the co cycle c as above. The adjoint action of Lg on itself is actually an Lg-action, 
by 
ad,(a,t) = (b,a],c(')',a)) 
and this is the infinitesimal version of the adjoint action of the group LG. To write 
the latter, we need some notation: for 9 : SI ---t G, we will consider g-lg' as a 
mapping SI ---t g and hence as an element of Lg; a bilinear form on Lg, which will 
still be denoted by 'B, is defined by

Remark V.2.11. This is an LG-action. However, notice that it depends, for each 
"level" z, on the actual value of z. The momentum mapping and the orbits we are 
interested in correspond to the value z = 1. 
End of the proof of Proposition V.2.7. The last argument comes from [117, § 4.3]. 
Consider an element cp E 0 1 (Sl, g) and write it as cp = adO for some a E Lg. Solve 
the differential equation 
{ f'. f- 1 = a 
1(0) = 1 
at least for a function f : R ~ G. As a is a function on the circle SI, 
f(O + 211") = f(O)f(211"). Call m(cp) (m is for monodromy, an alias for "holonomy") 
the element f(211") E G. Let us make an element 9 E LG act on (cp, 1), obtaining 
<p = Adg cp - (dg)g-l, that is, 
Q. = Adga _ g'g-l. 
It is easy to check that m(Adg cp) = g(O)m(cp)g(O)-1 and this proves Proposi-
tion V.2.7.

Remark V.2.12. The description of the symplectic leaves we have given was sketched 
by Atiyah in [9]. The symplectic form of the leaves is described in many papers (for 
instance in [3]). I have chosen a global description of the Poisson structure (which 
I learned from Volodya Fock (see [49])) because it shows why the symplectic leaves 
are obtained by fixing the monodromy along the boundary components, so that 
the symplectic foliation appears in a very natural way. 
It is also possible to describe the Poisson structure in the infinite dimen-
sional setting without using the loop group, as explained by Jeffrey in [72]: she 
considers connections A that are identically zero on some neighbourhood of the 
boundary, which makes the approach slightly simpler but less canonical than the 
one presented here, as she is forced to use a parametrization of the boundary. 

162 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
V.3. Construction of commuting functions on M 
In this section, we define functions on M, following Goldman [56], and prove that 
they are in involution. 
V.3.a. Goldman's functions. They are usually described in the following way. 
Consider both an invariant function I : G -+ R and a simple closed curve C on E, 
and define a map 
Ie: M ------+ R 
[p] r---+ l(p(C)) 
where p is a representative 1Tl E -+ G of the class [p] and C is considered as an 
element of 1Tl E in any obvious way, the invariance of I implying that the result 
does not depend on the choices made. 
For C a simple closed curve, let ge be the subgroup of the gauge group 
g consisting of mappings g : E -+ G that are identically equal to 1 on C. The 
subgroup ge is, of course, normal. Call Me = Aft/ge. The map 
~* 
Me: Me ------+ Lg 
A r---+ (Ale, 1) 
(with the notation of § V.2), defined using a diffeomorphism C -+ S\ is the mo-
mentum mapping for the ge-action on Me and thus defines a mapping 
~* 
4>c: M ------+ Lg ILG, 
which associates, to the gauge equivalence class of the flat connection A, its holon-
omy along C. The Goldman functions are just the quantitative (numerical) versions 
of the mapping 4>e: invariant functions on G more or less describe the conjugacy 
classes in G. The flow of a function Ie (as defined above) will preserve the levels 
of the map 4>e. Such a level is a set of flat connections, the holonomy along C of 
which is in a given conjugacy class (notice that Ie depends only on the homotopy 
class of the free loop C). So we have the following proposition: 
Proposition V.3.1. Let C be a simple closed curve on E. The flow of Ie acts on the 
class [A] EM of a flat connection by some element of the stabilizer Gm(<I>c([A])) of 
its holonomy along C. 
D 
After having defined these functions, Goldman has proved two beautiful the-
orems: 
- He has computed the Poisson brackets of any two functions IeI' ge2 , 
roughly speaking in terms of the intersections of the two curves C1 and C2 . 
- He has given an explicit formula for the flow of Ie, viewed as a Hamiltonian 
onM. 

V.3. CONSTRUCTION OF COMMUT ING FUNCTIONS ON J'y( 
163 
We will not prove these theorems here, contenting ourselves to send the readers to 
the original paper [56]. 
Theorem V.3.2 (Goldman [56]). Let C1 and C2 be two disjoint simple closed curves 
on the surface E. Then, for any two invariant functions f and 9 on the group G, 
{fcI' gcJ = o. 
Notice that Goldman considers a closed surface E, but this does not make 
any difference here. 
Corollary V.3.3. 
Let C be a simple closed curve on the surface E. Then for any 
two invariant functions f and 9 on the group G, {fe, go} = O. 
0 
As for the second theorem, I will use only a special case, which is a quanti-
tative version of Proposition V.3.1, in § V.l. 
V.3.b. Integrable systems? 
Counting commuting Goldman functions. Recall that 9 is the genus and d 
the number of boundary components of E. Assume d ~ 1 if 9 = 1 and d ~ 3 if 
9 = O. Then the maximum number of disjoint (nontrivial) curves on E is 3g-3+d. 
00 
Figure 5. Thinions 
This yields a trinion(6) decomposition, see Figure 6, so that Goldman gives us 
(3g - 3 + d) rk G (hopefully independent) commuting functions on M. This will 
be an integrable system. .. provided it is defined on a symplectic manifold of 
dimension 2(3g - 3 + d) rk G. Notice that the Goldman functions defined by the 
boundary components are Casimir functions: this is more or less equivalent to 
saying that the symplectic leaves are obtained by fixing the conjugacy classes of 
(6)The beautiful French terminology turns out to be very inconvenient when translated into 
English, as French people simply wear "pantalons" while the British need "pairs of pants". In 
any case, a trinion is just a sphere with three holes See Figure 5. 

164 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
the holonomy along the boundary. This is the reason why I have not included them 
in the enumeration here. 
Figure 6. A trinion decomposition 
In the case of a closed surface (d = 0) the moduli space itself is a symplectic 
manifold. If moreover the Lie group G is simple, we have seen that the dimension 
of Mg,o is (2g - 2) dim G and we have (3g - 3) rk G functions. Thus Goldman gives 
us an integrable system if and only if 
This happens with G = SU(2). 
dimG = 3. 
rkG 
Another way to have enough functions would be to consider a surface with 
nonempty boundary and choose a small enough symplectic leaf. Consider for in-
stance the moduli space Ml,I(SU(n)). Goldman allows us to use one curve and 
n - 1 invariant functions. .. and this might give us (provided the functions are 
independent) an integrable system on any symplectic leaf of dimension 2(n - 1). 
In both cases, it can be shown that the Goldman functions are actually inde-
pendent. I will concentrate on the case of SU(2). In this case, Jeffrey and Weitsman 
[76, 77J have exhibited a torus action that I describe now and which is nothing 
other than the action-angle coordinates for the Goldman system (see §III.3.b). 
A point in Mg,d(SU(2)) is a conjugacy class of a representation p : 7Tl (~) ---+ 
SU(2). Let M 1, ... ,Md be matrices corresponding to the d boundary components 
of ~. Each M j is an element of SU(2) so that its conjugacy class is well-defined 
by its eigenvalues eiOj , e- iOj . We have: 
Proposition V.3.4. Let (h, ... , Bd E [O,7TJ be such that, 
for all Ej E {±1}, 
LEjBj ¢ 0 mod 27T. 
Then the symplectic leaf defined by the conjugacy classes of the diagonal matrices

ifold of dimension 6g + 2d - 6. 
0 
Goldman's functions on SU(2). Let us turn to Goldman's functions in this case. 
The only invariant function is the trace, which defines a function f e and a flow on 
M for any curve C. The first remark is a very special case of Proposition V.3.1: 
Proposition V.3.5. All the orbits of the flow of fe are periodic. 
Proof. The stabilizer of a generic element of SU(2) is a circle. 
o 
Remark V.3.6. The Hamiltonian system defined by the function fe on M is super-
integrable, in the sense that there are many ("count" the curves not intersecting C) 
functions commuting with fe (of course they do not pairwise commute). The 
trajectories of the flow lie on the common level sets of all these functions. As there 
are enough functions, these common level sets are 1-dimensional. A good reason 
for the flow to be periodic. 
Now we normalize so that this periodicity corresponds to an Sl-action. Define 
he: M -? [0,1] by 
he( [p]) = ~ arccos (~ tr p( C) ) 
(up to the factor 1/7r, this is just the () in a matrix corresponding to C as above, 
namely, ei8 is an eigenvalue). Let Ue C M be the open subset consisting of all the 
classes of representations p : 7rlE -? SU(2) such that p(C) -::J ±Id, so that he is 
smooth on Ue and he(Ue) C (0,1). 
Proposition V.3.7. The Hamiltonian he : Ue ........ R is periodic. 
Sketch of the proof. This is a quantitative version of Propositions V.3.1 and V.3.5 
and a special case of Goldman's result described in § V.3. The function he is the 
Hamiltonian of the Sl-action 
{

in the case where the curve C does not disconnect the surface. When E - C has 
two components El and E2 say, if'Y n C = 0, (z . p)(-y) = p(-y) if'Y is homotopic 
to a curve in El say, and 
(z . p)(-y) is the conjugate (~ ~) p(-y) (~ ~) 
if 'Y is homotopic to a curve in E2.

CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
Trinion decompositions and torus actions. Let us now fix 3g + d - 3 curves 
on the surface L; as in Figure 6. Together with the d boundary components of L;, 
this gives us a set e of 3g + 2d - 3 curves which divide the surface into 2g + d - 2 
trinions (see Figure 6). To each curve C E e, associate the corresponding Be, he. 
Let 
h: JY( --) R e = R 3g+2d- 3 
be the map the components of which are the functions he (C E e). To each 
trinion in the decomposition is associated a tetrahedron in the subspace R 3 eRe 
corresponding to its three boundary curves. Let 
Ue = n Ue· 
eEe 
Proposition v'3.B. 
The restriction to Ue of the mapping 
h: JY( ---+ R e 
is the momentum mapping for a T 3g+2d- 3 -action on the Poisson manifold Ue C 
JY(g.d. The closure of the image of h is the convex compact polyhedron Pe obtained 
by taking the product of the tetrahedra corresponding to the trinions defined by e 
and intersecting it with the hyperplanes corresponding to the gluing of two trinions. 
Proof That the image is included in the polyhedron Pe is clear. We have only 
to check that all the interior points are actually obtained. Now any point of Pe 
gives a point in all the tetrahedra corresponding to the trinions defined bye, that 
is, according to V.l.8, a family of representations of the fundamental groups of 
the various trinions, or a gauge class of flat connections on each trinion (one even 
constructs local sections of the momentum mapping this way). One then checks 
that there exist either morphisms 1flL; --. SU(2) or flat connections on L; that 
extend the given data. 
D 
This proves that the he are the action coordinates corresponding to our 
angles (in the torus). This also proves that the Goldman functions under consid-
eration are independent, as Pe is a polytope with nonempty interior. 
Notice also that Proposition V.3.8 is not an application of the convexity 
theorem (Theorem IV.4.3) even when restricted to the intersection of a symplectic 
leaf with Ue, as this is not a compact smooth symplectic manifold. 
Let me make this remark more precise. Choose 
t=(t1, ... ,td),ti E [0,1] such that LCiti¢.O mod2 
and cut the polyhedron by the affine subspace defined by t (corresponding to the 
boundary curves). This gives a compact convex polyhedron p& which is the image 
of the compact smooth symplectic leaf JY(t under the mapping h. However, nobody 
claims that p& is the image of the momentum mapping of a torus action on JY(t: 

V.3. CONSTRUCTION OF COMMUTING FUNCTIONS ON ]V{ 
167 
this is the image of h and also the closure of the image of the momentum mapping 
for a torus action on Mt n Ue (which is, indeed, the restriction of h). Obviously, 
if the genus of L: is large enough, there can be some matrices equal to ± Id in an 
irreducible representation of 1l"1L:. 
In the sequel of this §, I will discuss some examples, in order to explain the 
meaning of this result. 
Example V.3.9 (The three holed sphere). Notice that Proposition V.1.8 is a special 
case of Proposition V.3.8, the case of MO,3' As the Poisson structure is trivial, a 
diffeomorphism can be a momentum mapping. 
Figure 7. The moduli space MI,I (SU(2)) 
Example V.3.10(The torus with one hole). Consider now (once again) our second 
favorite example, the torus with one hole, that is, the space MI,I' The moduli space 
is 3-dimensional, as is MO,3. But now, the momentum mapping is for a T 2-action 
and takes its values in R2. With the notation defined by Figure 7, the image 
of the momentum mapping is a triangle (intersection of the basic tetrahedron 
with the plane tl = t2)' The symplectic leaves are defined by t3. Notice that 
all of them are smooth surfaces, provided t3 # 0, 1. As this implies that tl = 
t2 E (0, 1), Ue n Mt = Mt. Thus the symplectic leaves have dimension 2 and are 
endowed with a Hamiltonian SI-action, and so they must be 2-spheres (see, if 
necessary, Exercise III.2), the image of the corresponding momentum mapping is 
the intersection of the triangle with the line t3 = const (Figure 7). 
Example V.3.11 (The torus with two holes). The next example is a torus with two 
holes, that is, the moduli space MI,2. Using the trinion decomposition shown in 
Figure 8 and Proposition V.3.8, one gets a momentum mapping, the image of 
which is a 4-dimensional polytope. To obtain a symplectic leaf, fix the numbers t3 
and t~ corresponding to the boundary components. The leaf is then mapped onto

the rectangle shown in Figure 8 (and, again according to Theorem IV.4.20, this is 
an 82 x 82). 
t' 3

Figure 8. A symplectic leaf in the moduli space M 1,2(SU(2)) 
Dependence on the decomposition. There can exist many different trinion 
decompositions for a given surface. Consider the simple example of a closed surface 
of genus 2 (g = 2, d = 0). It has two trinion decompositions as shown in Figure 9, 
which also shows the closures of the images of the corresponding momentum map-
pings h : M 2,o -t R3. The two polyhedra are quite different. For instance the 
pyramid cannot be obtained as the image of the momentum mapping of a torus 
action on a smooth compact symplectic manifold as it has a vertex with valency 4, 
which is forbidden by the linearization theorem for torus actions. 
Let me make a last remark on these two examples: the tetrahedron in Fig-
ure 9 turns out to be the same as the image of the momentum mapping for the 
T3-action on P3(C) (Example IV.4.6). To compare them, we must be rather care-
ful with the integral lattices the tori define in R 3 . In the case of p3 (C), this is 
the standard integral lattice in R3. The T3-action on M 2,o I have written is not 
effective (see [77]), so that the lattice to consider in Figure 9 is . .. precisely the 
one generated by the vertices of the tetrahedron. 
For the sake of completeness, let me recall that, following [112], M2,O(SU(2)) 
is homeomorphic with the projective space p3(C). 
Applications. The system on Mg ,d and the torus action on Ue may help to 
understand the Poisson and/or symplectic geometry of the moduli space, as I 
have explained in the previous examples. 
As a first application, Proposition V.3.8 and its symplectic specializations 
make it very easy to compute the volume of a symplectic moduli space, as this 
is simply the volume of the image polytope (with respect to the ad hoc lattice). 

V.3. CONSTRUCTION OF COMMUTING FUNCTIONS ON M 
169 
Figure 9. Torus actions on JVb,o 
For instance, an argument by induction on the genus 9 which is based on the 
decomposition of a surface with one hole shown in Figure 10 and on the volume 
of the rectangle of Figure 8 allows Jeffrey and Weitsman to give a simple proof 
of a theorem of Donaldson's, which states that the volume of the symplectic leaf 
defined by tin Mg,l, as a function of t, is a Bernoulli polynomial (see [78]). 
Figure 10 
The torus actions on the moduli spaces are also used by Jeffrey and Weitsman 
to understand the cohomology of M. Consider in particular the case of a closed 
surface, so that M is symplectic. They compute the number of integral points in 
mPe (this is where you have to be very careful with the definition of the integral 
lattice-which I was not). It turns out that this number is given by the Verlinde 
formula(7). Now this can be interpreted in the following way. The torus action 
defines a complex structure on Ue, and being integral, the symplectic form defines 
a complex line bundle £ on Ue. Now, if we were in ordinary toric geometry (i.e., 
with complete complex toric manifolds), the dimension of the space of holomorphic 
(7)80 that in particular, it does not depend on the actual trinion decomposition chosen! 

170 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
sections of £®m would be the number of integral points in mPe and thus would 
also be given by the Verlinde formula (see [76] for the details). 
V.4. Appendix: connections on principal bundles 
V.4.a. Principal bundles. A principal G-bundle is a space P endowed with a 
free G-action such that the orbit map P -+ B is a locally trivial fibration(8). 
When the slice theorem (Theorem 1.2.1) can be applied, the local triviality 
condition is automatically satisfied by a free action. We shall only consider compact 
groups here, but we cannot restrict to the case where P and B are manifolds, 
mainly because (in Chapter VI) we shall need some infinite dimensional spaces. 
There is an obvious notion of isomorphism of principal G-bundles. 
I shall, of course, take the liberty of denoting with the same letter the bundle 
and its total space. 
Examples V,4.1 
(1) In Chapter I, we have investigated principal Sl-bundles over Sl and over 
surfaces. 
(2) Of course the natural Sl-action on the unit sphere s2n+1 C Cn+1 makes 
the quotient map s2n+1 -+ pn(C) a principal Sl-bundle as well. 
(3) We consider now a slightly more complicated group, more precisely we look 
at the complex Stiefel manifold Vk(Cn+k) of unitary k-frames in Cn+k. The 
unitary group U(k) acts naturally on Vk(Cn+k). This is a free action and 
the quotient is the complex Grassmannian(9) Gk(Cn+k) of all k-dimensional 
vector subspaces in C n+k . The projection 
Vk(Cn+k) --+ Gk(Cn+k) 
is a principal U(k)-bundle (for k = 1, this is s2n+1 -+ pn(c)). 
(4) If the group G is discrete, a principal G-bundle is a Galois covering. 
V.4.b. Connections. A connection on P is the choice of a horizontal subspace 
of T pP for all points p of P, namely of a splitting of the exact sequence of vector 
bundles

which is also G-invariant. Here V P, the vertical bundle, is the kernel of T 7f, in-
trinsically defined, contrary to the horizontal subbundles. 
(8)Notice that the G-action on P is free and not only principal, a small incoherency in the 
terminology. 
(9) See also Exercise III.16. 

V.4. APPENDIX: CONNECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL BUNDLES 
171 
Example V.4.2 (The trivial bundle). Assume the principal bundle is (globally) triv-
ial. Then there is an obvious connection on P, the trivial one, the horizontal 
subspace of which at (g, x) E G x B is 
{O} x TxB c TgG x TxB = T(g,x) (G x B). 
For any other connection on the trivial bundle, the horizontal space H(g,x) is the 
graph of a linear map T xB -+ T gG. The invariance property leads us to a linear 
map T xB -+ g (the Lie algebra of G), so that the space of all connections can be 
identified with the space n1 (B, g) of I-forms on B with values in g. This example 
is not only trivial, but also very important as any principal bundle is locally trivial. 
More generally, a connection on P being fixed, the horizontal space of any 
other connection can be understood as the graph of a I-form on B. The difference 
of two connections is an element of the vector space n1 (B, g). The space A of all 
connections on P has thus the natural structure of an affine space modeled on this 
vector space. Notice that there exist, indeed, connections on principal G-bundles, 
as is asserted by Proposition V.4.3 below. 
An important tool is the canonical I-form on G. This can be considered as a 
complicated way to define a connection on the trivial bundle G -+ pt over a point. 
Concretely, this is the I-form 00 with values in g defined, at the point g E G and 
on the vector T 19(X) E T gG (for X E g) by 
(OO)g(T1g(X)) = Adg(X) E g. 
This is an invariant form in the sense that 
Indeed, for h, g E G, X E g, we have 
(h*Oo)g(Tg(X)) = (Oo)h.g(Tgh(Tg(X))) 
= (Oo)h.g(T1(h· g)(X)) 
= -Adh.g(X) 
= Adh(Adg(X)). 
For instance, the horizontal distribution on the trivial bundle is the kernel of the 
form 00 , viewed on B x G. 
Proposition V.4.3. 
On any principal G-bundle, there are connections. 
Proof We construct a I-form 0 on P with values in g. The required horizontal 
distribution will be the kernel of O. Let (Ui)iEI be a covering of B such that 
- the bundle is trivialized over Ui by diffeomorphisms 'Pi : p-1(Ui ) -+ G x Ui, 
- there exists a partition of unity ('l/Ji)iEI with 'l/Ji = 0 out of Ui and Li 'l/Ji == 1. 

172 
CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
We choose any connection on the trivial bundles Ui x G, for instance we choose 
the horizontal direction tangent to i.pi(Ui x G). Let now (h be the I-form defined 
on p-l(Ui ) by 
(}i = i.p7 (}o 
and () be the 1 form defined on P by 
((})x = L 1/!(P(X))((}i)x. 
i 
Thanks to the invariance property of (), the kernel of () has the required invariance 
properties. 
D 
Notice that we have constructed here a I-form () on P satisfying certain invariance 
conditions. This is actually equivalent to giving a connection (see Exercise VA). 
A connection A being given, we have

- a horizontal lift X 1-+ hA(X) for all vector fields on E 
- a vertical projection Y 1-+ VA(Y) for all invariant vector fields on P. Notice 
that VA(Y) is nothing other than (}(Y) for the I-form () constructed in 
Proposition VA.3. 
They are shown in Figure 11. 
Connections as derivations. The connections act on O-forms with values in g 
as: 
for f E nO(B, g), 
Notice that 
For instance, for the trivial connection on the trivial bundle, this is simply the 
usual exterior derivative 
(doJ)(X) = X . f. 

V.4. APPENDIX: CONNECTIONS ON PRINCIPAL BUNDLES 
173 
This extends to all g-valued forms, as the exterior derivative does. For instance, if 
tp E n1(p, g), dAtp is the g-valued 2-form defined by 
(dAtp) (X, Y) = \7~tp(Y) - \7¢tp(X) - tp[X, Y]. 
The curvature. The curvature A of the connection A is defined as the 2-form 
on B with values in 9 such that: 
for X, Y vector fields on B, 
F(A)(X, Y) = VA([hA(X), hA(Y)])' 
VA.c. The case of Sl-bundles. Assume now that the group G is simply a 
circle Sl. The Lie algebra is R, the form 00 is the closed I-form dz/z (better 
not call it dO here). What Proposition V.4.3 gives us is an invariant I-form, more 
precisely, a connection form, namely a I-form 0: on P that satisfies, if X is the 
fundamental vector field of the Sl-action, 
- the invariance property £xo: = 0, 
- the normalization condition ixo: == 1 (so that, for any vector field Z on P, 
o:(Z) is simply VA(Z)), 
Example V,4.4. 
Let s2n-1 C en denote, as usual, the unit sphere L IZil2 = 1. 
Make Sl act diagonally by 
Recall that the fundamental vector field (associated with a / aO) of this action is 
or, writing Zj = qj + ipj, 
Let 0: be the I-form (on en, or on S2n-1) defined by 
n 
0: = I: (-pjdqj + qjdpj) . 
j=l 
By definition, we have ixo: == 1. On the other hand, 
do: = (-I: dpj A dqj + I: dqj A dpj) 
= -2w

CHAPTER V. MODULI SPACES OF FLAT CONNECTIONS 
where W = L dpj 1\ dqj is the canonical symplectic form on Cn . Since the vector 
field X preserves w, we have 
LXW = dixa. + ixda. 
=ix(-2w) 
= 2dH = 0 
for H = ! L IZiI2, constant on the sphere. In other words, 0'. is a connection form 
on the principal Sl-bundle 7r : s2n-l -? pn-l(C). 
Turning back to a general principal Sl-bundle, let us look now at the form do.. 
rt satisfies ixda. = 0 and Lxda. = dixda. = O. Thus there exists a 2-form fJ, the 
curvature form, such that 7r*fJ = do. and which is closed because do. is. 
Example V.4.5. 
Consider once again the Hamiltonian H = ! L IZil2 and its re-
duction aa at the level a (see Example III.2.18). That is, consider the sphere of 
radius ffa and its projection on pn-l(c). As above, the form 
is a connection form, with

with the notation of III.2.18, so that the curvature form, on pn-l(c), is precisely

the 2-form --. 
a 
The definition of the curvature used here is of course just another viewpoint 
on the same object as above, namely, for an Sl-bundle, the curvature FA and the 
curvature form a agree (up to sign). Indeed, let Y, Z be two vector fields on B. 
Let us lift them to P as hA(Y), hA(Z) and compute 
a(Y, Z) = (da.)(hA(Y), hA(Z)) by definition of a 
= hA(Y) . a.(hA(Z)) - hA(Z) . a.(hA(Y)) - a.([hA(Y)' hA(Z)]) 
= -a.([hA(Y), hA(Z)], horizontal vectors being in the kernel of 0'. 
= -VA([hA(Y),hA(Z)]) by definition of 0'.. 
Remark V.4.6. If 0'., a.' are two connection forms on the same principal Sl-bundle 
7r : P -? B, the I-form 0'. - a.' is invariant and vanishes on vertical vectors, since 
ixa. = ixa.' = 1 for the fundamental vector field. Hence there exists a I-form {3 on 
the basis B, such that 0'. - a.' = 7r*{3 ... so that we have, for the curvature forms, 
fJ - fJ' = d{3, 

EXERCISES 
175 
in particular, the de Rham cohomology class of the curvature form TJ does not 
depend on the choice of the connection form. In particular, if the bundle is trivial, 
choosing a trivialization gives a trivial connection, the connection form of which 
is simply the volume form on Sl, a closed 1-form on Sl x B, so that the curvature 
of any connection form on a trivial principal Sl-bundle is an exact 2-form.

CHAPTER VI 
EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY AND THE 
DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
Another famous and spectacular theorem in the theory of Hamiltonian torus ac-
tions is the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem [44] (as we have learned since that 
time, similar results had been proved by Karasev [81] in 1981). This theorem has 
two versions, both asserting, once again, the importance of linear phenomena in 
the theory. 
In the first theorem (here Theorem VI.2.3), the authors consider the reduced 
symplectic forms w~ and Wry on the quotients of two regular levels /-1-1 (~) and 
/-1-1 ('f}) which correspond to values ~ and 'f} located in the same component of the set 
of regular values of the momentum mapping /-1. One may then identify the quotients 
B~ and Bry and consider the difference of cohomology classes [w~]- [Wry] E H2(B~). 
The theorem asserts that it is a linear function of ~ - 'f}. 
The second statement (here Theorem VI.3.18) is usually shortened to: a pe-
riodic Hamiltonian satisfies the "exact stationary phase formula" . 
It was Berline and Vergne [22] who first explained that this statement is 
a special case of a "localization theorem" in equivariant cohomology. This was a 
very productive idea: the language of equivariant cohomology actually fits very well 
with the investigation of Hamiltonian actions, as one might be readily convinced 
by looking at Proposition VI.2.1. 
Later came two "survey" papers on the subject, one by Atiyah and Bott [11] 
in 1984 and one by Ginzburg [53] in 1987. From these come the methods and 
results I shall discuss in the present chapter. 
As I have already said, the language of equivariant cohomology fits so well 
here that we shall see that the first of the Duistermaat-Heckman theorems becomes 
practically tautological (this will not detract from its beauty) ... Of course we will 
have to pay for this, namely we will have to define equivariant cohomology, the 
Borel construction and classifying spaces. .. Thus we shall begin by recalling the 
classical results and constructions of Milnor and Dold, recommending the reader 
to consult these authors and [69] for details.

VI.1. Milnor joins, Borel construction and equivariant cohomology 
VI.1.a. Principal and universal bundles. We shall consider numerable cov-
erings, that is, locally finite coverings (Ui)iEI such that there exists a partition of 
unity (Ui)iEI with: 
Uil(]O, l]) CUi, 
Vi E I. 
Notice, for instance, that any paracompact space has a numerable covering. 
A principal bundle over B is said to be numerable if there exists a numerable 
covering of B which makes it locally trivial. In this chapter, all the principal 
bundles will be assumed to be numerable, even if I forget to mention it explicitly. 
Let p : E -t B be a principal G-bundle, and let I : B' -t B be a continuous 
map, then the pull-back 
f*E = ((e,b') I p(e) = I(b')} 
or fibered product in the diagram

is a principal G-bundle as well, and one ShOWS(l) without too much difficulty: 
Theorem VI.l.l. Let It : B' -t B be a homotopy. Then the two bundles It E and 
Ii E are isomorphic. 
D 
Universal bundles. We try now to construct a principal G-bundle which is 
universal. In other words, we want a bundle £ -t B such that any principal G-
bundle is induced by a map B -t B. More precisely, we will say that a numerable 
principal G-bundle £ -t B is universal if 
- For any numerable principal G-bundle E -t B, there exists a map I : B -t 
B such that E is isomorphic to f* £. 
- Two maps I, 9 : B -t B induce isomorphic bundles if and only il they are 
homotopic. 
Milnor [107] has given a very beautiful (and, furthermore, explicit) construc-
tion of universal bundles, called the Milnor join. Let 
EG = G*G*···*G*··· 
be the "infinite join" , or more explicitly: 
EG = limEG(n) 
---> 
(1)8ee for example [69]. 

VI.l. EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY 
where EG(n) is the quotient of the product 
Gn+1 x ~n = {(xo,to;x1,tr; ... ;Xn,tn) I Xi E G,ti E [O,lj,Lti = 1} 
by the equivalence relation 
179 
We shall write (xo, to; ... ; xn, tn) for the equivalence class of the element under 
consideration. 
Examples VI.l.2 
(1) Assume first that G = Z/2 = {±1}. Then EG(n) can be identified with sn 
by the map 
EG(n) 
~ 
sn 
(xo, to;··· ;Xn, tn) f---------* (ytOxo, ... , vT,;xn). 
(2) Let now G be the circle Sl. The very same formulas identify EG( n) with 
the sphere s2n+ 1. 
The limit EG is defined by the inclusion maps 
EG(n) 
EG(n + 1) 
Any element in EG will thus be written 
or for brevity e = (x, t). Notice that, for any element of EG, all the ti'S, except 
a finite number, are zero. We endow this set with the least expensive topology(2) 
such that all the maps 
and 
ti: EG ~ 
[0,1] 
(xo, to;··.; Xn, tn) f---------* ti 
~G 
are continuous. Notice that the group G acts on EG(n) and EG by 
g. (x, t) = (gx, t), 
(2)This the direct limit topology. See the comments on the possible names for this topology 
in [109, p. 63]. 

180 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
clearly free actions. The quotients will be denoted respectively BG(n) and BG. 
Since G does not act on the coordinate t i , there is also a continuous map 
ti : BG ----+ [0,1]. 
It turns out that the open subsets V; = til(]O, 1]) constitute a numerable covering 
of BG and that the principal bundle EG --t BG is trivialized on these open sets 
(see [40] for detail). 
Examples VL1.3 
(1) As we have seen, for G = Zj2, EG(n) = sn. Thus 
EZj2 = SOO = {(xo, ... , xn"") I almost all Xi = 0 and LX; = I} . 
The group acts by the antipodal map, so that BG(n) = pn(R) and BG = 
Poo(R). 
(2) In the same way, for G = S\ BG(n) = pn(C), and BG = Poo(C). 
We shall now explain (without too much proof) that these spaces were made 
to be universal. One begins by showing that all numerable bundles have a numer-
able partition of unity which makes them locally trivial. Granted this, we consider 
the ti'S on EG as a "universal partition" of unity (2: ti = 1), to prove: 
Proposition VL1.4. For any numerable principal G-bundle, E over B, there exists 
a map f : B --t BG such that 1* EG is isomorphic with E. 
Proof We construct two maps f and 9 such that the diagram 
E~EG 
L~JG 
commutes. For that, we use a partition of unity (un)n~O on B such that Elu;;:l(jO,l]) 
is trivial. Put Un = U~l(]O, 1]). Let 
Un 
be a local trivialization, and call qn the projection Un X G --t G. The map 9 we 
want to define is simply 
g(z) = (qOhr;l (z), uo(p(z)); ... ; qnh~l (z), Un (p(z)); ... ). 
This is better defined than one might think: of course, h:;; 1 (z) is defined only for 
Z E p-l(Un), but, if this is not the case, un{p{z)) = O. 

VLl. EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY 
181 
The map g is necessarily an isomorphism. We have more generally: 
Lemma VLI.S. Let El ----t Bl and E2 ----t B2 be two principal G-bundles. Any 
morphism 
g 
E2~El 
1 f 
lp 
B2~Bl 
induces an isomorphism g' : E2 ----t f* El . 
Of course, this lemma ends the proof of the proposition. 
Proof of the lemma. Recall that f* El can be defined as the fibered product 
so that the map g' : E2 ----t f* E 1 , defined by 
o 
is a morphism of principal G-bundles over B2.1t is easy to check that g' is injective. 
If g' (e) = g' (e'), then p( e) = p( e') and e' = x· e for some x E G; applying g' again, 
one sees that x = 1. Moreover g' is surjective as well: let e E f* E 1 , and let e' 
be a point in the fiber of the image of e in B2 . One can find an x E G such that 
g'(xe') = e. 
0 
It is slightly more technical, but not much more difficult, to prove that the 
Milnor join is indeed universal. From this universality, some kind of uniqueness 
follows: if El ----t Bl and E2 ----t B2 are two universal principal G-bundles, writing 
explicitly this property for the former gives a morphism 
E2~El 
1 f 1 
B2~Bl 
and similarly, writing that E2 ----t B2 is universal gives a morphism g : Bl ----t B 2. 
As fog: Bl ----t Bl induces an isomorphism, it is homotopic to the identity, and 
the same is true for g 0 f: thus the homotopy type of the universal space BG is 
well defined. As we shall use these spaces only in algebraic topology calculations, 
the uniqueness of their homotopy type will be sufficient for our purposes. 
In the same mood, one proves (see [40]) the following useful result. 
Proposition VLI.6. Let E ----t B be any numerable principal G-bundle such that the 
total space E is contractible, then this is a universal principal G-bundle. 
0 

182 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
In [107], Milnor has proved that his spaces are weakly contractible (this 
means that their homotopy groups are trivial), but in the mentioned paper, Dold 
has shown that Milnor joins are actually contractible. Consider for example the 
infinite sphere SOO, namely our example of space EG for G = Z/2 or G = S1. 
Using the fact that sn is (n - l)-connected immediately gives the fact that soo 
is weakly contractible. The reason why the infinite sphere is actually contractible 
is that any sphere sn can be contracted to a point in sn+1. To derive a complete 
proof is a little bit more elaborate (see Exercise VI.1). We shall admit the general 
fact that the spaces EG we have described are indeed contractible. This has readily 
a few applications. 
Examples VI. 1. 7 
(1) If H is a subgroup of G, it acts freely on EG, so that EG/H is a model for 
BH. 
(2) If G and H are two groups, the product G x H acts on EG x EH in the way 
you imagine and the quotient is BG x BH which is a model for B(G x H). 
(3) If f : G -+ H is a group morphism, it induces a continuous map BG -+ BH: 
this is easy to construct on the "Milnor join" models. 
From these "theoretical" examples, one gets concrete examples of universal 
bundles. 
Examples VI.1.8 
(1) From the inclusion of the cyclic group Z/m c S1, we deduce that the 
quotient of s2n+1 by the equivalence relation 
namely the lens space Lm , is a finite approximation to B(Z/m), the latter 
then being the "infinite lens space" soo /(Z/m). 
(2) In the same way, the torus Tm = S1 X ... X S1 acts diagonally on the 
product s2n+1 X •.• X S2n+1, which is thus found to be an approximation 
to ETm and BS 1 x ... x BS 1 becomes therefore a model for BTm. 
(3) Consider the join EU(k)(n) = ((Ao,to; ... ;An,tn) I Ai E U(k)} and the 
map into the Stiefel manifold Vk(Ck(n+1)) which, with any (A, t), associates 
the k column vectors in the k(n + 1) rows matrix 

Vr.1. EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY 
183 
Taking limits and passing to quotients, this induces a morphism 
As for the infinite sphere (which is the case k = 1), it is easy to prove that 
the infinite Stiefel manifold Vk(C OO ) is weakly contractible: the homotopy 
exact sequence of the fibration(3) 
Vk_l(CN) ~ 
Vk(CN) ~ 
S2N-l 
gives that the map 
7rn (Vk_l(CN)) ~ 
7rn (Vk(CN)) 
is an isomorphism for N large enough, from what the expected result is de-
duced by induction on k. We conclude that the infinite Grassmann manifold 
Gk(COO) is a model for BU(k). 
VI.1.b. The Borel construction. If W is a space acted on by the group G, we 
know perfectly well that the orbit space WIG may be rather complicated. The idea 
in the Borel construction is to try to get a reasonable substitute for this quotient. 
Make G act on EG x W by 
g. (e,x) = (g. e,g· x). 
This action is free, simply because it is free on the first factor. The quotient space 
W G = EG x G W is called the Borel construction on W. 
Remark VLl.9. In this way we have only defined the homotopy type of this space. 
Consider the two projection maps from the product EG x W: 
- the projection to EG 
EGxW~EG

WG

induces a fibration WG --t BG with fiber W, 
- the projection EG --t W induces a map 
a:WG~WIG. 
The latter is not a fibration in general, but we have nevertheless: 
(3)See Exercise VI.2.

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
Proposition VLl.lO. 
Let G be a compact Lie group acting freely on a space W. 
Then the map

is a fibration with contractible fibers, and in particular a homotopy equivalence. 
Proof. Denote by [] the classes, either in EG XG W or in WIG. Let us investigate 
first the fibers of a in the general case. Let x E W. The fiber of [x] is 
a-I ([xl) = {[e, y] E EG x G W I proj[e, y] = [xl} . 
Let us look for the classes [e, x] for e E EG. Of course, [e' , x] rv [e, xl if and only if 
there exists an element g E G such that e' = g. e and x = g. x, that is, such that 
g E Gx . Hence a-1([xl) = EGIGx , which is a model for BGx • 
When the G-action is free, all the fibers are thus spaces EG, in particular 
they are contractible. The local triviality is a consequence of that of W ---t WIG, 
that is, of the slice theorem. 
0 
It is in this sense that one may say that W G is the homotopy theoretical 
quotient of W: 
- this is a "good" quotient, 
- when the genuine quotient is "good", it has the same homotopy type. 
On the contrary, if the G-action on W is trivial, then W G = BG x W; this 
is the case, for instance, when W is a point, in which case WG = BG. 
VL1.c. Equivariant cohomology. Let W be a topological space acted on by 
a group G. The equivariant cohomology of W is the cohomology of the Borel 
construction W G. It is written He (W). 
There are as many possible theories as there are cohomology theories. Here 
we shall mainly use de Rham cohomology. That is to say that we shall assume W 
to be a smooth manifold, with a G-action which is smooth as well. Unfortunately, 
neither EG nor a fortiori W G are manifolds, which causes some trouble: what 
could be a differentiable form on W G? All the groups we shall be interested in 
are subgroups(4) of some U(n) This allows us to use the infinite Stiefel manifold 
Vn(Coo) = UkVn(cn+k) of unitary k-frames in Coo (or any other union of mani-
folds that would fit) as a model for EG. A differentiable form on such a space is 
simply a family of differentiable forms, that agree via the inclusions(5) . 
Remark VL1.11. The reader may ask why we are doing such complicated things. A 
simpler way to define an "equivariant cohomology" would seem to be to consider 
the cohomology of G-invariant forms on W. Actually, when G is compact and 
(4)Every compact Lie group can be embedded in some unitary group U(n) for n large enough. 
(5)In general, we shall content ourselves with finite approximations of EG or WG. 

Vl.l. EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY

connected, this is nothing else than the usual de Rham cohomology of W, as 
Exercise VI.4 shows. This fake "equivariant cohomology" has nothing more to say 
than the cohomology of W. On the contrary, we have very good reasons to think 
that the cohomology of W G says more: for example, if W is a point, then W G = BG 
and Ha(pt) = H*(BG), which is never zero. 
On the other hand, Ha (W), being the cohomology of a space W G, is, in 
particular, a ring. It has even more structure: using the projection map 
7r 
WG -----7 BG, 
it receives the structure of an Ha(pt)-module. We shall mainly concentrate on this 
structure, which has a lot to say about the action. For instance if the action is 
free, Ha(W) ~ H*(W/G) is a torsion HG(pt)-module. 
The first thing to understand is what kind of a ring Ha (pt) is. We limit 
ourselves to the case where G is a torus, and we begin of course with the case of 
the group G = 8 1. 
Theorem VI. 1. 12. The cohomology ring H*(BS1) is a polynomial ring, on a gen-
erator u of degree 2. 
Remark VI. 1. 13. This is true over Z and therefore over any ring of coefficients, as 
will be the case for all statements in this chapter which are not given with more 
precision. 
We have said that the infinite complex projective space is a model for B81• 
We only need to calculate its cohomology. This is deduced from the cohomology 
of the (finite) projective spaces. Recall the classical proposition: 
Proposition VL1.14. The cohomology ring H*(pn(c); Z) is a truncated polynomial 
ring Z[u]/un+1 on a generator u of degree 2. The inclusion j : pn(c) C pn+1(C) 
induces the obvious (truncation) map 
j* : Z[u]/un+2 -----7 Z[u]/un+1 . 
The theorem follows easily from the proposition (the cohomology of a direct 
limit of spaces is the inverse limit of the cohomologies). As a benefice to innocent 
readers, there is a proof of the proposition in § VI.4. Merely recall here that u is the 
Euler class of the complex line bundle <9(1), the canonical bundle over POO(C). 
Consider now a torus, written as a product of circles 
Tn = 8 1 X ... X 81 
to derive: 
Corollary VI. 1. 15. Let T be a torus of dimension m. Then H*(BT) is a polynomial 
ring on m variables of degree 2.

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
Generators for de Rham cohomology. Using the previous results, we exhibit 
now "the" generator of H2(BS1; R). 
Consider the connection form a given in Example VAA for the Sl-principal 
bundle s2n-1 ~ pn-1(c). Its curvature form TJ is a closed 2-form on pn-1(c). 
This form is not exact, as it is, up to a scalar factor, the reduced symplectic form, 
precisely 
aa 
TJ=--a 
for aa the reduced form obtained from the sphere of radius ffa (see Exam-
ple VA.5). It thus represents a nonzero element in H2(pn-1(C);R). 
The cohomology classes defined are compatible via the inclusion maps 
cn C Cn+1 , so that what we have actually defined is a nonzero element [TJ] in 
H2(BS1; R). We still have to compare it with u, which is characterized by the 
fact that (u, [p1(C)]) = 1. Recall from Example VA.5 and Exercise HUI that 
r 
aa = 27ra, so that r 
TJ = -271'. 
jPl(C) 
jPl(C) 
Thus the cohomology class of -TJ/271' coincides with u. 
Let us now consider the cohomology of BT. Once a basis (Xl, ... , Xm) of 
the kernel of the exponential in t ~ R m has been chosen, we get an isomorphism 
<p : Sl x ... X Sl ---t T 
a homotopy equivalence 
q> : BS1 x ... X BS1 ---t BT 
and a ring isomorphism 
q>* : H* BT ---t H* BS1 ® ... ® H* BS1 ~ R[U1, ... , um ] 
(using de Rham cohomology). The torus T acts on (Cn ) m by 
(h, ... , tm) . (Zl,"" Zm) = (t1Z1, ... , tmZm) 
where Zi E C n . We can thus use the product of m copies of the unit sphere 
s2n-1 X .•. X s2n-1 as a finite approximation to ET. On this product, we have m 
forms ab ... , am with iXjai = 8i ,j and the isomorphism 
H2(BT) ---t t* 
which sends (U1,"" um) to the basis dual to (X!, ... , Xm). It is easily checked 
that this isomorphism does not depend on the choice of the basis (Xb ... , Xm). 
Hence we can identify H2(BT; R) with t* and the polynomial ring R[U1, ... , um ] 
becomes the algebra 8(t*) of multilinear symmetric forms on t. 
Remark VI. 1. 16. The reader may find that this is not very elegant to 
- choose a basis. 

VI.l. EQUIVARIANT COHOMOLOGY

- then use it to define an isomorphism 
- and then prove the latter does not depend on the basis. 
If this is the case, she or he should re-write this paragraph in a more intrinsic way. 
Euler classes for fixed point free T-actions. Using equivariant cohomology, 
let us define the Euler class for an Sl-bundle or a T-bundle, thus generalizing the 
definition given in Chapter 1. 
To begin with, we consider a free Sl-action on a space W, and the quotient 
B of this action. We have seen (in Proposition V1.l.lO) that the natural map 
is an isomorphism. There exists thus a unique element in H2(B; Z) that is mapped 
to -u. This is called the Euler class of the principal Sl-bundle W -+ B. Notice 
that this Euler class is natural, in the sense that, in a pull-back diagram 
W'-----+ W 
1 1 
B'-----+B 
f 
of principal bundles, 1* e = e'. Indeed, it is sufficient to use the diagram 
HSI (W) -----+ HSI (W') 
r 
ra'* 
H*(B) ~ 
H*(B'). 
Example VLI.17. The Euler class of the principal Sl-bundle s2n+l -+ pn(c) is 
-u (one can either use this example as an exercise or look for a proof in § V1.5). 
Notice that -u is the cohomology class of rJ/27r, where rJ is the curvature form for 
a connection on the principal bundle. 
The last property is fairly general, as the next proposition asserts. 
Proposition VLI.18. Let 7r : P -+ B be a principal Sl-bundle. Let Q be a connection 
form on P, with curvature rJ. The cohomology class of the form rJ/27r in H2(B; R) 
is the Euler class of the bundle. 
Proof Recall that, according to Remark V.4.6, the cohomology class of rJ does not 
depend on the connection form rJ comes from. We may thus choose any convenient 
connection form and prove the result for it. We know that there exists a "classifying 

188 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
map" B _ pn (C) for n large enough and a commutative diagram 
p~82n+1 
1 1 
B,pn(c). 
We pull back our old a and TJ on the model bundle, so that F* a is a connection 
form on P, the curvature of which is f*TJ. This gives the result, by naturality of 
the Euler classes. 
0 
There is a more precise statement in Exercise V15. 
The definition of the Euler class can be extended to all fixed point free 81_ 
actions by the very same method as in § l3.d. Let W be a manifold acted on by 
8 1 and assume the action has no fixed points. Choose a common multiple n of 
all the orders of the exceptional orbit stabilizers and consider the quotient W' of 
W by the Zjn-action. It is endowed with an 8 1 j(Zjn) ~ 8 1-action. Call p the 
projection map p: W - W'. 
Although W' is rather an orbifold than a manifold, we may apply the previous 
definition to W' (as long as we are dealing with de Rham cohomology, there is no 
difficulty). Look at the diagram 
2( ) (0")* H2 
(W') 
H B ----+ 
51 jCZjn) 
lp* 
H§1(W) 
and at the Euler class e' of the principal 8 1-bundle W' -
B. This is the unique 
element in H2(B) which satisfies O"*e' = -u'. Let us prove that, in fact, p*u' = nu. 
This is an assertion that may be checked at the classifying space level, where we 
must show that the map induced by the n-fold covering map 
p : 8 1 -----t 8 1 
is the multiplication by n in H 2(B8 1). But the induced map from B81 onto itself 
is precisely the one which classifies the bundle e>(n) as will be shown in §VI.5. 
We thus have a unique class e E H2(B) (namely e' jn) such that O'*e = -u. 
Notice that the result does not depend on n. We call it the Euler class of the 8 1_ 
action on W. We still have to prove (having used the same name for two apparently 
different notions) that if dim W = 3, it is the same Euler class as in Chapter 1 
This will be done in § VI.5, which will be specially devoted to the study of these 
various Euler classes. 

VI.2. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS AND THE DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 189 
In the same way, dealing with a principal (resp. without singular orbits) torus 
T-action (dim T = m) on the manifold W with quotient B, one can define an Euler 
class e E H2(B)m (resp. with coefficients in a ring containing the inverses of the 
orders of the stabilizers). If we do not insist on being intrinsic, this can be defined 
as the unique element e = (el, ... ,em) E (H2(B))m such that 
(J'*e = (-Ul, ... , -um) E Hi(W). 
Using de Rham cohomology, e E H2(B; R) ® t is the unique class such that, if we 
identify H2(BT) with t* in the diagram 
we have (J'* (e,~) = ~ (where (e,~) is the element of H2(B) we get using duality 
in t in an obvious way). 
For example, any regular level of the momentum mapping J.l : W --+ t* of a 
Hamiltonian T-action on the manifold W (assumed to be symplectic!) defines an 
Euler class e in the cohomology of the symplectic reduced orbifold (see § III.2.f) , 
at least with rational coefficients. 
VI.2. Hamiltonian actions and the Duistermaat-Heckman theorem 
VI.2.a. Relationship between equivariant cohomology and Hamiltonian 
actions. As we have already had the opportunity to mention, equivariant co-
homology is a very convenient language in which to speak of Hamiltonian group 
actions. This is clear in the statement of the next easily proven proposition, in 
which 0 denotes a connection form on EG as constructed in Proposition V.4.3. 
Proposition VL2.1. Let (W, w) be a symplectic manifold endowed with a symplectic 
action of the Lie group G. Let J.l : W --+ g* be any differentiable map. The formula 
w~ = w + d(O,J.l) 
defines a closed 2-form on the Borel construction W G if and only if the G-action 
is Hamiltonian with momentum mapping J.l. 
Notice that 0 ® J.l is a 1-form taking values in 9 ® g*, and may be contracted 
to give a 1-form taking values in R, which we denote (0, J.l). 
Proof Assume the G-action on W is Hamiltonian and that J.l is its momentum 
mapping. Consider the 2-form W = w + d(O, /1) on EG x W. It is G-invariant by 

190 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
definition. Moreover, we have, for all X in £I, 
Hence w satisfies 
ixw = iXw + iXd(O, J-l) 
= iXw - diX(O, J-l) 
= iXw - d(iXO, J-l) 
= ixw - d(X, J-l) 
= iXw - djix = O. 
LXW = 0 and iXw = O. 
Moreover, this form is obviously closed. It thus comes from a closed 2-form w~ on 
the Borel construction W G. 
Conversely, consider again the pull back w on EG x W. The same computation 
gives, for X E £I, 
iXw = ixw + iX(O, J-l). 
Using Cartan's formula, we get 
ixw = ixw + (adx 0, J-l) + (0, X . J-l) - d(X, J-l)

Now, X is a fundamental vector field, so that

VI.2.h. Variation of the reduced symplectic forms. Consider now a torus T 
acting on a symplectic manifold (W, w) with momentum mapping J-l : W ....., t*. Let 
~ be a regular value of J-l. We consider, as usual, the two maps 
namely the inclusion 
j~: Ve c W 
of the corresponding level V~ = J-l-l(~) and the quotient map 
(J"~: V~ --7 B~. 
As the map j~ is T-equivariant, it induces a map 1 XT j~

VI.2. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS AND THE DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 191 
(the vertical map is, since T acts freely on VE, the homotopy equivalence induced 
by the fibration O"E; we slightly abuse notation and call it O"E). The form 
w: = (1 XT jE)*w~ 
is the unique closed form on ET x T VE which can be lifted to ET x VE as 
j;w + (d()'~l' since we have 
w~ = w + d((),j.ll 
= w + (d(),j.ll - ((),dj.ll, 
and, by the definition of ~, 
(1 x jd*w~ = j;w + (d(),~l. 
From this, we deduce immediately the inverse image of the class [w:l by the mor-
phism 
O"E : H2(BE) ~

As j(w gives the reduced symplectic form and d() the Euler class of the T-bundle 
VE ~ BE, we have 
(0";)-1 [w:l = [wEl + (e,~l· 
Let now U be a convex open subset of t*, all the points of which are regular values 
of j.l, so that the T-action on the open subset j.l-1(U) of W has no singular orbit. 
Consider then, for ~ E U, the diagram of quotients and inclusions

where all the maps are isomorphisms (jE is a homotopy equivalence, because this 
is the inclusion of a fiber over the contractible space U). 
We consider [w~l as an element of Hi (j.l-1 (U)) by restriction. There is thus 
a unique (that is, independent of ~ E U) class 
x = (I7*)-l[w~l E H2(j.l-1(U)/T)

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
the image of which by (j~ is [w~l. Hence, from the relation above, we deduce: 
Proposition VI.2.2. Let U be a convex open subset of t* consisting of regular values 
of the momentum mapping J1: W --+ t*. There exists a class x in H 2(J1-1(U)/T) 
such that 
v ~ E U, i(x = [wel + (e,~) E H2(Be) 
where we is the reduced symplectic form at the level ~ and e is the Euler class of 
any of the T -bundles ~ --+ Be.

Fixing an element ~o in U, we get an equivariant isomorphism J1- 1(U) ~ 
U x Veo and, passing to quotients, a way to identify each H2(Be) with H2(Beo), 
and thus a way to compare the various classes [wel. As a corollary, this gives the 
famous Duistermaat-Heckman theorem.

Remark VL2.4. The sign in this statement comes from the orientation conventions 
in Chapter I where we managed to get -1 as Euler class for the Hopf bundle. 
Example VL2.5. Consider for example the case of a circle action on a 4-manifold. 
All the reduced regular levels are smooth surfaces-the same smooth surface--
on which the symplectic form is characterized by its integral, the volume of the 
reduced space. The theorem asserts that the function 
t t-------> Vol Bt 
is piecewise linear, more precisely that it is linear (affine) over each component of 
the set of regular values, the slope being the opposite of the Euler class. Consider 
for instance the Sl-action on P2(C) by 
U· [x, y, zl = lux, y, z], 
associated with the Hamiltonian

z = ~

The fixed points are the projective line x = 0, the minimum of H, and the point 
[1,0,0]' its maximum. The regular values are all the points of 10, H The reduced 
regular levels are all 2-spheres. 
Figure 1 shows the graph of this volume function. The slope is -1, according 
to the fact that the Euler class of the bundle Vi --+ Bt is + 1. This is not by pure 
chance that this looks very much like one of the triangles shown in Figure 2 of

VI.2.c. Duistermaat-Heckman with singularities. In this section, we de-
scribe a construction, independently due to Brion and Procesi [29] on the one 
hand and to Guillemin and Sternberg [64] on the other, and which generalizes the 
previous remarks. 
For the sake of simplicity, we shall assume throughout that all actions are 
semi-free (see nevertheless Remarks VI.2.7). We recall first a useful operation, 
already met in Exercise HI.19. 
Blowing up 0 in Cn • Consider the space one gets by replacing, in Cn , the point 0 
by the set of all straight lines through it. In other words consider 
en = {(v,£) I v E £} c Cn X pn-l(c). 
From the viewpoint of the projection on pn-l(C), this can be considered as the

total space of the tautological line bundle over pn-l(C), but we will rather look 
at it from the viewpoint of its projection onto cn: 
1r : cn ----+ cn 
(v, i) 1------+ v. 
If v i= 0, the fiber 1r-1(v) contains only one point: the nonzero vector v defines 
a unique line. But, if v = 0, there is a whole pn-l(c) above it. It is called the 
exceptional divisor(6). 
The space en is a complex manifold: it may be described by the algebraic 
equation 
en = {((Xl' ... ' Xn), [a!, ... , an]) I aiXj - ajXi = 0 for all i,j}. 
It is also easy to find local coordinates for it: 
ai 
- If an i= 0, put Yi = -, then 
an 
cn ----+ en c cn X pn-l(c) 
(Y!,.··, Yn-l, x)) 1------+ ((XYl, ... , XYn-!, x), [Yl, ... , Yn-!, 1]) 
is a diffeomorphism onto its image. 
- One would write just as easily local coordinates on the other affine charts 
ai i= o. 
As a complex submanifold, the blown-up cn has symplectic forms, induced by 
those ofCn x pn-l(c). As we have seen in Exercise IlI.19 (see also Exercise VL7), 
it is even possible to construct symplectic forms inducing the standard form of Cn 
outside any given disc centered at O. This allows us, via Darboux, to blow up 
any point in any symplectic manifold and to obtain new symplectic manifolds (see 
more generally [102]). 
Here is now another way to describe the blow up (see also Exercise IlLIg). 
Consider, on W = C X cn, the Sl-action 
u· (x, Yl, ... , Yn) = (ux, uY!,··., uYn). 
Choose the Hamiltonian 
so that 0 is a critical point and 0 the corresponding critical value. Let E: be a 
positive real number. Let us look at the regular levels: 
(6) Divisor simply means complex codimension 1 here. 

V1.2. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS AND THE DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 195 
They are respectively diffeomorphic to s2n-1 X C and to Sl X cn. The quotients 
by the Sl-action are diffeomorphic, respectively, to 
B_ ~ en and B+ ~ Cn. 
Remark VI.2.6. This endows en with various reduced symplectic forms (as noticed 
in Exercise III.19). I will come back to this in §VI.4.b. 
Crossing a critical value, simple situation. Let H be a periodic Hamilto-
nian on a symplectic manifold W. We consider a critical submanifold Z of H with 
signature (2, 2p). We study the situation in a neighborhood of the critical subman-
Figure 3 
ifold, so that, using an invariant metric, we can assume that, transversally to Z, 
W = C x CP with

H = ~ (lxl2 -IYlI2 _ ... -IYpI2) .

The situation, transversally to Z, is described in Figure 3, where the gradient flow 
is indicated as well. Consider the map

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
Restricted to a level of H, this descends to the quotient 
H-1(t) ____ 
1T' ___ 
----t) CP 
~/ 
Notice that, for t > 0, on the level t, we have 
Ixl = J2t + L lyd2 
so that the map H-1(t)/Sl ---+ CP can be considered as the quotient map (and the 
quotient is CP). On the other hand, for t < 0, the level H-l(t) is diffeomorphic 
with C x S2p-l and the quotient space H-1(t)/Sl is the blow up CP of CP at 0, 
in other words the total space of the tautological bundle <9 ( -1) over the quotient 
pp-l(C) of S2p-l. The map H-1(t)/Sl ---+ CP contracts the projective space 
[Yt. ... ,Yp] and is precisely the blow up. 
In other words, the surgery upstairs (from negative to positive levels) corre-
sponds downstairs to the blow up of a point (transversally to Z). 
Remarks VI.2.7 
(1) A straightforward computation shows that at the -c; level, the reduced 
symplectic form integrates to c; on the generator of the second cohomology 
group of the exceptional divisor. We thus see, using the Hamiltonian H, 
a (real) I-parameter family of symplectic manifolds which, for negative 
values of the parameter c; are CP's such that the volume of their exceptional 
divisor decreases to 0 as c; ---+ O. For nonnegative values of the parameter 
the exceptional divisor has disappeared and the symplectic manifolds are 
CP's. 
(2) Once we accept working with orbifolds as quotients, there is no essential 
difference with non semi-free actions. .. in particular with actions of the 
form 
u· (x, Yl, ... , Yp) = (ux, ti"'Yl, ... , ti"'yp) , 
which will appear in the following, even after having started with semi-free 
actions. 
(3) We will come back to this situation in the simple case where p = 1, on a 
symplectic manifold of dimension 4, a case where blowing up a point does 
not change the topology, in § VIII. I. 
The general case. We consider now a critical submanifold Z of signature (2p, 2q). 
Transversally to Z we can assume as before that W = Cp+q, Z = {O}, and 

VI.2. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS AND THE DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 197 
and the trick is to blow up W along Z in order to mimic the previous simple 
situation. We thus look at 
cp+q = {([TJ, (], y, z) I (y, z) E [TJ, (]} 
(here [TJ, (] is a line in Cp+q while (y, z) is a vector in the same Cp+q ). This is 
endowed with the Sl-action extended linearly as usual: 
U· ([TJ,(],y,z) = ([UTJ,u(],uy,uz). 
The fixed "point" Z = 0 becomes two fixed submanifolds included in the excep-
tional divisor y = z = 0: 
- a projective space pq-1(C), that of equation TJ = 0, 
- and a Pp-1(C), of equation (= O. 
Note that all points of the exceptional divisor now have a Z/2 as stabilizer. 
Let ii be a Hamiltonian for the Sl-action (with respect to some invariant 
symplectic form on the blown up manifold). Look now at the normal bundles 
and indices of critical submanifolds. The projective space pq-1(C) embeds in 
pp+q-1(C) with normal bundle the sum of p copies of the line bundle c)(1). The 
latter is in turn a submanifold of Cp+q , with normal bundle C) ( -1). The situation 
for 
is quite similar. 
What we want to understand is what happens when the critical value, 0, say, 
is crossed. Let us call V_, V+ respectively, regular levels just before 0, just after 0, 
the O-level itself being denoted by Vo. Let us denote B_, B+, Bo, the corresponding 
quotients. In the blown-up manifold, let V' be a regular level between the two (new) 
critical submanifolds. 
Figure 4 shows, schematically (it is not that easy to draw a blow up in two 
dimensions), the situation: we have split our critical value in two. The new critical 
submanifolds are joined by an "exceptional divisor" E. A better picture could be 
that in Figure 5. 
Following the gradient or minus the gradient we get a diagram 
B'~B+ 
1 1 
B - ------+ Bo 
as in [29] where B' was defined as a fiber product, a definition which could seem 
rather artificial from the topological viewpoint (if not from the algebraic one). 
Recall that Vo was a critical level, thus Bo is not smooth in general.

Let us now describe more precisely the topology of V' and B' and the map 
B' ----+ Bo. The regular level V' = ji-l(O) meets the exceptional divisor pp+q-l(C) 
along the submanifold of equation 
This submanifold of pp+q-l(C) is the quotient of S2p-l x S2q-l C S2p+2q-l by 
the diagonal Sl-action. Being the common boundary of tubular neighborhoods 
of pp-l(C) and pq-l(C) in pp+q-l(C), this is a sphere bundle over pq-l(C), 
precisely 
S(pCJ(-l)) ~ 
pq-l(C), 
as well as over Pp-l(C), this time 
S(qCJ(-l)) ~ 
pp-l(C). 
Look now at quotients: to construct B', we have removed the singular point and

replaced it with V' n E /81 (E is the exceptional divisor). This is the same as the 
quotient of the sphere bundle 
S(pe:J(l)) ------7 pq-l(C) 
by the equivalence relation 
Thus, this is nothing other than the projectivized bundle 
P(pe:J(l)) ------7 pq-l(C). 
Of course the projectivized bundle is trivial and the quotient is a pp-l(C) x 
pq-l(C). 
Remark VI.2.8. If q (or p) equals 1, we get the blowing up of a point (or a smooth 
submanifold) of Bo which in this case is smooth as we have already remarked. In 
general the map B' ---7 Bo is a blow up in the algebraic sense. 
Application: the Duistermaat-Heckman problem at critical values. We 
are thus looking for a diagram like

In the Duistermaat-Heckman Theorem VI.2.3, all the regular quotients of 
H-1 (±E) were identified with the same manifold B± and this allowed us to 
compare the classes 
and to prove that in each case, staying in the same component of the set of regular 
values, lac] was an affine function of c. Our diagram will be used to compare [ac ]

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
and [O"-El even if ° 
is a critical value. Let us look at the diagram we get by taking 
cohomology: 
0"* 
H 2(B') +----=- H2(B+) 
0"+ r 
H2(B_) 
which enables us to compare the classes of the reduced symplectic forms in H2 (B'). 
Recall (see Proposition VI.4.5 below) that the two maps 0"+ and 0"_ induce inclu-
sions at the H2-level. Using the reduced symplectic forms O"t at levels t > 0, t < ° 
and these inclusions, we consider the curve 
defined, for all t > 0, as follows: 
-
[O"tl is the class of the reduced symplectic form at level t considered as an 
element in H 2(B') via the inclusion. 
-
[O"tl for t < 0, being an affine function of t, is easy to extend as an affine 
function for all t, [O"~l denotes its value for the positive values of t (once 
again the inclusion is omitted). 
Theorem VI.2.9 (Brion and Procesi [29]). 
The curve t 1---+ [O"tl -
[O"~l is a half-line, 
directed by the class of the exceptional divisor of the map B' ~ Bo. 
Proof The exceptional divisor of the map B' ~ Bo is the sum of the two excep-
tional divisors of B' ~ B±. Since everything is affine it is thus sufficient to prove 
the theorem in the "simple" case where it is an obvious consequence of the remark 
on reduced symplectic forms in § VI.2.c. 
0 
Example VI.2.10. Assume the symplectic manifold has dimension 4, so that the 
reduced levels B_ and B+ are surfaces. To blow up a point in a surface does not 
change its topology. It is thus possible to compare 0" E and 0" -E just by looking at 
the function 
t f------t Is 0" t· 
Over each component of the regular set, the graph is a straight line (with an 
integral slope in the semi-free case we are considering). When crossing the critical 
level Va, the slope will decrease by 1. In this situation, the change in the topology 
is trivial, but it is not at the level of reduced symplectic forms, the blow up reflects 
in the change of the slope. 

V1.3. LOCALIZATION AT FIXED POINTS 
201 
Remark VL2.11. As noticed by Guillemin and Sternberg in [64], everything we 
did, we could have done in an equivariant way for any group action which com-
mutes with the 8 1-action. Consider for instance a Hamiltonian torus action with 
momentum mapping J.l : W --+ t* and try to compare the reduced symplectic forms 
when crossing a codimension-l wall between two polyhedra of regular values of J.l. 
It is sufficient to be able to cross it orthogonally and thus to consider a 8 1 X Tn-1 
situation which can be studied as before. This is why a result like Theorem VI.2.9 
is called a "wall crossing formula" . 
VI.3. Localization at fixed points and the Duistermaat-Heckman 
formula 
VI.3.a. The support of an H* BT-module. As usual, we use de Rham coho-
mology. Having chosen a basis of the Lie algebra t of a torus T, we can identify 
H* BT ~ S(t*) ~ R[uI, ... ,un] 
(the last isomorphism depending on the choice of the basis). In particular, this 
will allow us to consider elements of H* BT as functions on t or as polynomials 
in (UI, ... , un). For any f E H* BT ~ S(t*), let Vf be the subset of zeros of the 
polynomial f 
Vf = {X E t I f(X) = O}. 
Let M be an H* BT-module. Its support is defined as the intersection 
Supp M = n Vf C t. 
Ulf·M=O} 
Examples VL3.1 
(1) The module {O} has empty support. 
(2) Let M be a free module. If f annihilates M, then f is zero and Vf is t, 
so that Supp M = t. Hence the modules having a proper support do have 
torsion. 
(3) If T = 8 1 , the ring H* BT is a ring of polynomials in one variable, hence a 
principal ideal domain. If f is a generator of the ideal annihilating M, then 
Supp M consists of the zeros of f. In this example, one can imagine why it 
is often more convenient to use complex coefficients. It suffices for that to 
replace H* BT by H* BT ® C ~ H*(BT; C) and t by t ® C. Thus, when 
M does have torsion, there is a (proper) support. We shall see that in the 
Hamiltonian case there is no problem and we can "stay real": the supports 
we shall have to consider will be unions of vector subspaces. 
Lemma VL3.2. 
If M' ~ 
M ~ 
Mil is an exact sequence of H* BT-
modules, then Supp M C Supp M' U Supp Mil. 

202 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
Proof Put S = SUpp M, S' = SUpp M' and S" = Supp Mil. Let x ¢ S' U S". 
Then, as x ¢ S', there exists a polynomial f such that f(x) i= 0 and f . M' = O. 
For the same reasons, there exists a polynomial 9 annihilating Mil but not x. But 
b(g· M) = 9 . b(M) c 9 . Mil = O. 
Thus 
9 . M c a(M') and f· (g . M) c a(f . M') = 0, 
hence 
(fg) . M = 0, 
f(x)g(x) i= 0, and so x ¢ S. 
o 
The next two results are proved similarly. 
Lemma VI.3.3. Let M and M' be H* BT -algebras with units. Let a : M' -t M be 
a morphism of algebras. Then Supp M c Supp M' . 
Proof If x ¢ SuppM', there is a polynomial f annihilating M' but not x. The 
unit 1M' is killed by f, 
a(f . 1M ,) = f· 1M = 0 
so that f kills M and x ¢ SuppM. 
o 
Proposition VL3.4. If 0 -t M' -t M -t Mil -t 0 is an exact sequence of H* BT-
modules, then Supp M = Supp M' U Supp Mil. 
0 
Supports of H!J:(U), examples. We begin to investigate now the structure of 
H* BT-module of the equivariant cohomology of T-manifolds. 
Lemma VI.3.5. Let H be a closed subgroup of the torus T. Then 
Supp HT(T /H) = I) c t. 
Proof We first notice that 
ET XT T/H rv ET/H rv BH. 
We deduce that HT(T/H) is simply H* BH with the H* BT-module structure 
given by the restriction 
H*BT~H*BH. 
On the other hand, H is a closed subgroup of the torus T, and so, up to the fact 
that it might not be connected, this is a torus. More precisely, this is the product 
of a torus Ho by some finite group that de Rham cohomology will not even notice 
and hence we can suppose that H is a torus. 
The structure of H* BH as an H* BT-module is rather easy to understand. 
The inclusion of the Lie algebra 
i:l)~t 

V1.3. LOCALIZATION AT FIXED POINTS 
203 
induces the restriction of polynomials 
S(ti) : S(t*) ~ 
S(~*). 
The torsion elements of H* BH are thus all the polynomials on t the restriction to 
~ of which vanishes. Thus 
SuppHi-{T/H) = n Vf =~.

o 
Corollary VI.3.6. Let V be aT-manifold. Assume there exists an equivariant map 
V ---+ T/H. Then SuppHf(V) c ~. 
Proof. The induced map 
1* : Hi-{T /H) ~ 
Hf(V) 
is a ring morphism. Applying Lemma VI.3.3, we find that 
SuppHf(T/H) :J SuppHf(V). 
o 
This corollary may be applied in particular when V is an equivariant tubular 
neighborhood of any orbit of the smooth T-action on a manifold W (thanks to 
the slice theorem) and gives: 
Corollary VI.3.7. 
Let V be an equivariant tubular neighborhood of an orbit of 
type (H) in the T-manifold W. Then SuppHf(v) c ~. 
0 
In the same way, we have also: 
Corollary VL3.8. Assume T acts freely on W. Then SuppHi-{W) = O. 
0 
Considering now the union of all orbits in W the stabilizer of which is a 
proper subgroup of T, that is, the complement of the fixed point set F, we are 
going to prove: 
Proposition VL3.9. Let F be the fixed point set of aT-action on a compact mani-
fold W. Then 
SuppHf(W - F) c U~ 
H 
where H describes the (finite) set of all the (proper) stabilizers of points in W. 
Remark VL3.10. In particular, this support is a proper subspace of t, contained in 
a finite union of vector subspaces, thus Hf(W - F) is a torsion H* BT-module. 
Proof of the proposition. The space W - F has the same (equivariant) homotopy 
type as the complement of a small equivariant neighborhood of F. The comple-
ment may be covered by open subsets Ul, ... ,Uh which are equivariant tubular 
neighborhoods of orbits, with proper subgroups of T as stabilizers. 

204 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
We may apply Corollary VI.3.7 to each Ui . This allows us to prove, by in-
duction on h, that: 
SuppH.j.(U1 U··· UUh) C ~l U··· U ~h. 
We start the induction by applying Corollary VI.3. 7 to U1. Suppose then the result 
to hold up to order h, put 
Vh = U1 U ... U Uh and thus Vh+l = Vh U Uh+l. 
We have

in which 
- the intersection Vh nUh+l C Uh+l is endowed with an equivariant map onto 
the central orbit of Uh+l in such a way that Supp M' C ~h+l' 
- we have the inclusion 
h 
SuppM" = SuppHT(Vh) U SUppHT(Uh+d = U 
~i U ~h+l 
i=l 
by Proposition VI.3.4. 
This gives the result for Supp Vh+l. For Supp M it follows from Lemma VI.3.2. 0 
VI.3.h. The localization theorem. Our goal in this investigation is to prove 
rather precise versions of the fact that, forgetting torsion, the H* BT-module 
HT(W) looks very much like the free H* BT-module HT(F). 
Theorem VL3.1l. 
Let i : F ~ W be the inclusion of fixed points of the action of 
a torus T on a manifold W. Then the supports of both the kernel and cokernel of 
i* : H.j.(W) ------t HT(F) 
are included in UH stabilizer f-T ~. 
Proof Let U be an equivariant tubular neighborhood of the fixed point set F. We 
know that 
SuppHT(W -U) C U ~ 
Hf-T 

VI.3. LOCALIZATION AT FIXED POINTS

and that the same is true of SuppH;(a(W - U)). Using the long (equivariant) 
cohomology exact sequence of the pair (W - u, a(W - U)), the same is true for 
the support of H;(W - U, a(W - U)). 
Let V be another equivariant tubular neighborhood, a little larger than U, 
such that V - U rv a(W - U) = au. We have isomorphisms: 
H;(W,F) ~ H;(W, V) excision) ~H;(W -U, V-U) ~ H;(W -U,a(W -U)). 
In particular, 
Supp H;(W, F) C Uf). 
The exact cohomology sequence of the pair (W, F) 
H;(W, F) ----+ H;(W) ~ 
H;(F) ----+ H;(W,F) 
allows us to conclude. 
o 
The rank of the H*BT-module H;(W) is thus the same as the rank of the 
free module H;(F). It is possible to give an even more precise statement, using the 
notion of localization. If f E H* BT is a nonzero element, consider the localized 
subring (H* BT)j of the ring of fractions H* BT, consisting of all the fractions 
which have a power of f as denominator. In the same way, for any module M, 
consider the localized (H* BT)rmodule 
Mj = M 0H*BT (H* BT)j 
obtained by extension of scalars. 
Let f be a polynomial which vanishes on all the f)'s. Consider the induced 
morphism 
This is an isomorphism because of the next lemma.

In other words, the H*(BT)-module (H* BTh is fiat.

Reciprocally, let x E Kerb'. By the definition of Mf, we can find an integer m 
such that fmx E M and as we have b'(x) = 0, b(Jmx) = fmb'(x) = 0 so that 
fm x E Kerb = lma. We can thus write fmx = a(y) and 
x = a(y) = a' (JL) E lma'.

According to the lemma, the kernel and the cokernel of the (localized) mor-
phism i* are the localizations of the kernel N and the cokernel C. On the other 
hand, we know that 
Supp N C Vf and Supp C C Vf 
by the definition of f. Thus Nf and Cf are zero and i* is actually an isomorphism. 
Because of the adjunction formula (Proposition VI.4.6 below) relating i* and 
the Gysin morphism i*, 
i*i*l = eT(v), 
we suspect that i* is more or less the inverse isomorphism, up to the inversion of 
some Euler classes. This is what we shall make precise now. Let us begin with two 
properties of i* analogous to Theorem VI.3.11 for i*: 
Proposition VI. 3. 13. The kernel and cokernel of 
i*: H.j.(F) -+ Hi(W) 
both have support in the union u~ of the Lie algebras of the stabilizers ¥- T of 
points ofW. 
Proof. We just have to consider the cohomology exact sequence of the pair 
(W, W -F), 
Hf(W - F) ----+ Hf(W, W - F) ----+ Hf(W) ----+ Hi (W - F)

and to deduce the result from the previous lemmas. 
o 
Let us now invert Euler classes. Any polynomial f vanishing on the support 
is suitable to define a localization. We are going to construct a minimal such f. 
Let Z be a component of the fixed point set F ofthe T-action on W. Consider 
its equivariant Euler class eT(vz) E Hf(Z) (see §VI.4.b). As the T-action on Z 
is trivial, Hf(Z) ~ H*(Z) 0 H* BT and we may decompose 
eT(vz) = :La{ 0 f4m-i E H*(Z) 0 H*BT 
i,j 

VI.3. LOCALIZATION AT FIXED POINTS

where the lower index denotes the degree of the cohomology class under consider-
ation, and 2m is the codimension of the submanifold Z in W. 
Of course, all the elements of positive degree in H*(Z) are nilpotent, so that 
we have: 
Lemma VL3.14. The Euler class, eT(vz) is invertible in H.j.(Z) if and only if its 
component I:j ai ® f4m in HO(Z) ® H2m(BT) is invertible. 
D 
Let z E Z be a fixed point. The sum I: ai ® f4m may be interpreted as the 
restriction of eT (v z) in HO (z) ® H2m BT ~ H.j. (z). Let us compute this restriction. 
Write 
T z W = T zZ EB L1 EB ... EB Lm 
where T acts on Li by the morphism Cl:i : T --+ Sl. Also denote by Cl:i : t --+ R the 
linear form which is the derivative of Cl:i at 1. Then the restriction of eT(vz) is (up 
to sign) the product of the linear forms Cl:i (considered as a polynomial on t)(7). 
Remark VL3.15. It is clear that the kernel of Cl:i is one of the ~ 's in the support of 
H.j.(W - F). Indeed, the subgroup H = KerCl:i C T fixes vectors in the complex 
subspace Li, but the T-action on Li is nothing other than the derivative at z of 
that on W. 
Let us put fz = I1 Cl:i (this is eT(vz ) for some z in Z) and f = I1zcF fz· 
Then all the classes eT(vz) are invertible in (H.j.(F))t and the map

Remark VL3.17. Actually, in the Hamiltonian case, using a well chosen projection

- It is not absolutely necessary to assume that the fixed points are isolated. 
There is a more general statement in [44]. 
- Similarly, it is not necessary to consider only circle actions, analogous results 
hold with higher dimensional tori. 
- The formula must be read as an equality of formal series in the variables u 
and u- 1. We shall come back to this remark later on. 
Proof of the theorem. As H is a periodic Hamiltonian, we know that the symplec-
tic form w may be "extended" to WSI (according to Proposition VI.2.1) as a closed 
2-form w~. Consider the latter and all its powers. In order to deal with all of them 
at the same time, we use formally a = exp[w~] as if this was an element of H~l (W). 
Apply first the localization Theorem V1.3.16 to get:

as 'Tf*i* = 1, according to § VI.4.c applied to the section

We therefore calculate iza = expizw~. The "form" w~ is the projection of 
w + d(OH), 
so that izw~ is the projection of 
iz(w + dOH - 0 A dH). 

VI.3. LOCALIZATION AT FIXED POINTS 
209 
As Z is a point, this is simply the projection of dOH(Z), that is -uH(Z). Our 
right-hand side is thus 
e-uH(Z) 
:2: eSl (vz) . 
ZEF 
Let us look now at the left-hand side: 
7r*0! = 7r*expw~. 
We thus have to consider 
exp(w + dOH - 0 1\ dH) on ESI x W, 
to integrate over Wand to project. During the integration process over W, all the 
terms in the exponential of degree different from 2n vanish. There remains only 
wlln In! and other terms which are all exact forms, as for instance (dH)2n 1(2n)!.

Image of the symplectic measure. Replacing the formal variable u by it and

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
for a periodic Hamiltonian, the phase H is stationary at the fixed points of the 
circle action and the result consists in only one term 
(notice that t appears with the exponent n at the denominator as well). This is 
why the Duistermaat-Heckman formula is often qualified as an exact stationary 
phase formula. 
VI.3.d. Examples of applications. The aim of this paragraph is to make 
Theorem VI.3.18 talk. The left-hand side of the formula is a formal series in u, 
but not a priori its right-hand side: if Sl acts near the fixed point Z by 
then 
±a1·· . an un = eSl(vz) 
appears in the denominator. The Duistermaat-Heckman formula implies therefore 
that certain elements must vanish. 
Here are some examples of these cancellations. Assume for simplicity that H 
is the Hamiltonian of a semi-free action, that is, that ai = ±1 for all i. Let >'(Z) 
be the number of minus signs (so that the index of Z as a critical point of His

its symplectic volume is the length of the segment image of the Hamiltonian

case, using the methods of Chapter VIII, we shall see that W = 
S2 X S2, and that the SI-action extends to a T2-action ... of course 
the trapezium is related with the image of the momentum mapping. 
(3) The case where n = 3. With the same notation, and the same hypotheses, 
the same method gives for example 
Po - PI + P2 - P3 = o.

This, added to the fact that Po = P3 = 1, gives Pi = P2. More generally, 
notice we always have Pi = Pn-i in dimension 2n when the fixed points are 
isolated: this is Poincare duality, as H is a "perfect" Morse function and so 
Pk = dimH2k(W). 
Remark VL3.21. In dimension 6 (n = 3) and with the hypotheses above, it can 
be shown that Pi = P2 = 3. .. using essentially the same method, a localization 
formula near fixed points analogous to Theorem VI.3.16, but in equivariant K-
theory. In some sense, this is even easier: the group KT(W) is defined (starting 
with T-vector bundles over W) much more simply than H;(W) for which we had 
to use classifying spaces and the Borel construction. 
The functor "equivariant K-theory" KT has properties analogous to that of 
the "equivariant cohomology" Hi, which allows us to prove a localization theorem. 
From this theorem, Hattori remarked in [67] that it was possible to deduce, among 
other things, with our hypotheses (periodic Hamiltonian, isolated critical points, 
semi-free action) that Pi = (7). For n = 2, we have already explained this several 
times. For n = 3, remark that the method, even if analogous, is nevertheless more 
powerful, as we are not able to deduce Pi = P2 = 3 from Theorem VI.3.16 or 
Theorem VI.3.18. It is also with the help of the localization formula in equivariant 
K-theory, for Hamiltonian torus actions on toric varieties (see Chapter VII) that 
Brion gave very elegant proofs of some results about convex polyhedra (see [28]). 
The localization formula has many applications. There are also "non-Abelian" 
localization formulas (for other groups than the torus), due to Lisa Jeffrey and 
Frances Kirwan, see [73, 74, 75] with applications to the cohomology of symplectic 
quotients and in particular to that of moduli spaces. 
VI.4. Appendix: some algebraic topology 
We give here some hints of proofs and references for the main notions of algebraic 
topology used in this chapter. There are a lot of good books. We have already 
mentioned [69] when we have used it at the beginning of the chapter. I like very 
much and used a lot the one by Milnor [109] especially for this appendix. 

VI.4. APPENDIX: SOME ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY

VI.4.a. The Thorn class of an oriented vector bundle. Let E ---) B be an 
oriented (for example, complex) vector bundle of (real) rank n. Denote Eo the 
complement of the zero section in E, F a fiber and Fo the intersection F n Eo. 
The fiber F is the vector space Rn and we have 
so that the chosen orientation (which specifies the last isomorphism) gives, for each 
fiber F an element U F which generates the infinite cyclic group Hn (F, Fo; Z). The 
Thorn isomorphism theorem asserts the existence of a class on E the restriction 
of which to each fiber is U F. 
Theorem VL4.1 (Thorn isomorphism). There exists a unique cohomology class U E 
Hn (E, Eo; Z) the restriction of which to Hn (F, Fo; Z) is U F (for any fiber F). 
Moreover the map: 
H*(E) ----+ H*(E, Eo; Z) 
y 
f--------7 
Y '-../ U 
is an isomorphism. 
For the proof, first look at the case of the trivial bundle, which is rather easy, 
then cover the base space by open subsets which trivialize the bundle, and (at least 
if the base space B is compact) deduce the result by induction on the number of 
open subsets, with the help of Mayer-Vietoris and the Five Lemma (see [109] for 
details). 
D 
The class U is called the Thorn class of the oriented bundle E. It is clear that 
a change in orientation will change the sign of U. It is also clear that U is natural: 
if f : B' ---) B is a continuous map, then U(f* E) = J*U(E). The isomorphism 
y I-t Y '-../ U is the Thorn isomorphism. 
VIA. h. The Euler class of an oriented bundle, equivariant Euler class. 
The Thorn class U allows us to define the Euler class of the oriented vector bundle 
7r: E ---) B. This is the unique class e E Hn(B; Z) such that 7r*e = j*U where the 
maps are the natural ones 
Hn(E, Eo; Z) ~ 
Hn(E; Z) ~ 
Hn(B; Z). 
Remark VL4.2. Changing the orientation of E changes the sign of e. On the other 
hand, e is natural as is the Thorn class we used to define it. 
The equivariant Euler class. Recall that E ---) B is a G-vector bundle if it is a 
vector bundle, endowed with a G-action which is linear in the fibers and compatible 
with some G-action on the base space. This is what we need to form the vector 
bundle EG Xc E ---) EG Xc B. As such, it has an Euler class (if E is oriented) 

214 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
which we shall denote eG(E) E Ha(B) as we intend to call it the equivariant Euler 
class of the bundle E -t B. 
A G-vector bundle may be trivial as a vector bundle without being trivial as 
a G-vector bundle, as the following example shows. 
Example VL4.3. Let B be a point, so that a G-vector bundle over B is nothing 
other than a linear representation of the group G. Such a representation has an 
Euler class in H* BG. For instance if G = S1 and if E = C with the action 
u· v = umv, then ES1 XSI E is the bundle <9( -m) over BS1 (see Appendix VL5). 
Proposition VI.4.4 (Gysin exact sequence). There exists an exact sequence 
-----t Hi(B) ~ 
HHn(B) ~ 
HHn(Eo) -----t HH1(B) -----t . 
Proof Use the long cohomology exact sequence of the pair (E, Eo) and the previ-
ous isomorphisms in the diagram 
to conclude. 
o 
The cohomology of the projective space. To prove Proposition VLl.14, we 
use the Gysin exact sequence for the "tautological" line bundle 
E = <9(-1) = {(i,x) lie Cn+!,x E i} c pn(c) X Cn+1. 
The complement Eo of the zero section is the set of all pairs (i, x) for x i= o. 
It is easily identified with C n+! - {O}. Its homotopy type is that of the sphere 
s2n+1. Let v be the Euler class of the bundle E (the class u in the statement of 
Proposition VI.1.14 is just -v). We may write the Gysin exact sequence 
-----t Hk+1(S2n+!) -----t Hk(pn(c)) ~ 
Hk+2(pn(c)) ~ 
7r* 
~ 
Hk+2(S2n+1) -----t 
from which we immediately deduce that all the H2k+1(pn(c)) vanish, and that 
'-../ v: H2k(pn(c)) -----t H2k+2(Pn(c)) 
is an isomorphism for 0 :::; 2k :::; 2n - 2. 
o 

VI.4. APPENDIX: SOME ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY 
215 
The cohomology of a blow up. Recall that the blow up Cn of Cn at 0 is 
also the total space of a complex line bundle over pn-l(C), so that it has the 
same homotopy type (and the same cohomology) as this projective space. Using 
the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence, one easily deduces the cohomology of any 
(symplectic or complex) manifold of dimension 2n blown-up at a point. 
Proposition VIA.5. As a group, the cohomology of W is the direct sum 
H*(W) = H*(W) E!1 H*(pn-l(c)). 
D 
In dimension 4 (or complex dimension 2), it is easy to be more precise. As in 
the proposition, the cohomology groups of the blown-up manifold Ware the same 
as those of W, except for the H2, which is the direct sum 
H2(W) ~ H2(W) E!1 H2(pl(C)) ~ H2(W) E!1 Z. 
Moreover, the factor Z is generated by the cohomology class dual to the class 
E E H 2 (W) of the exceptional divisor and the intersection pairing (or, equivalently, 
the cup product) is determined by the fact that 
E· E = -1 and E· C = 0 for all C E H2(W), 
VI.4.c. The Gysin homomorphism. Let us start with the case of an embed-
ding. Let i : Z <-t W denote the inclusion of a codimension-m submanifold, with 
normal bundle 1/ (assumed to be oriented). We define the Gysin homomorphism 
i*: Hk(Z) ~ 
Hk+m(w) 
(which goes the wrong way and which does not preserve the graduation) as the 
composition 
Hk(Z) ~ 
Hk+m(l/, I/o) excision) Hk+m(w, W _ Z) restriction) Hk+m(W) 
where of course, <P denotes the Thorn isomorphism for the bundle 1/. 
Proposition VL4.6. 
Let i : W C W be the inclusion of a submanifold, the normal 
bundle of which is denoted 1/. We have 
i*i*l = e(l/) 
and 
i*i*x = x ......, e(I/). 
Proof The commutative diagram 
1 f-i ------t) U 

216 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
proves the first equality. As 1f'* and j* preserve multiplicative structures and x 1-+ 
x '--' U is the Thorn isomorphism, this also proves the second one. 
0 
The equivariant case. Suppose the Lie group G acts on Wand Z, the embed-
ding i being equivariant. Up to finite approximations, we may consider that the 
inclusion 
i : EG Xc Z "-----? EG Xc W 
is the embedding of a submanifold. Therefore we have a Gysin homomorphism 
i* : H(;(Z) ----+ Hc(W). 
Computing i*i*l gives the Euler class of the normal bundle of EG Xc Z that is, 
the equivariant Euler class of v: 
i*i*x = x '--' ec(v). 
Integration in the fibers. Let 1f' : E -t B be a locally trivial bundle with 
compact fiber F. Assume that Band E are manifolds and, moreover, that F is 
an oriented manifold of dimension m. Let W be a k-form on E. We can associate 
to it a (k - m)-form on B, denoted 1f'*W and defined in the following way. We first 
define an m-form CY on F = 1f'-I(b) by 
CYx (VI, ... , Vm) = Wx (X\(x), ... , Xk-m(X), VI"'" Vm) 
in which formula X\(x) is any vector in T xE such that T x1f'(Xi(X)) = Xi E TbE 
(it is clear that the result of this process is well-defined). Then we define the form 
1f'*W by 
{ if k < m, 
otherwise, 
1f'*W = 0 
(1f'*W)b (Xl, ... ,Xk- m) = J7r-"(b) CY. 
We have defined this way a map 
1f'* : O,k(E) ----+ O,k-m(B) 
at the level of forms. 
Proposition VL4.7. The diagram 
commutes. 
Proof This is a straightforward verification. 
D 

VI.4. APPENDIX: SOME ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY 
217 
We thus get a morphism, still denoted 1r*, 
of which it is not hard to make a relative version which will appear in the following 
example (of course, in this paragraph, we are dealing with de Rham cohomology). 
Example VL4.8. The (constant) map 1r : sm ---t pt may be considered as a fibration 
with fiber sm. The homomorphism 
1r* : Hm(sm) -------t HO(pt) 
W 
f-------+ J 
8 m W 
sends the generator to 1. From the definition of the Thom class U, we deduce that 
if E is an oriented rank n vector bundle over B, then 
maps U to 1. 
The reader may be frightened by the present terminology and ask (with 
some reason) what relationship exists between the * considered here in the case of 
a fibrations and the * defined above in the case of an embedding. She or he may 
remain calm: 1r* and i* are two aspects of a single Gysin homomorphism f* defined 
for any proper map f : V ---t W from one manifold into another. One possible way 
to define f* is precisely to decompose f as the composition of an embedding and 
a fibration 
i : V -------t W X sn for n large and 1r : W X sn -------t W 
and to put f* = 1r* 0 i* (it is not very hard to prove that this does not depend on 
the choices). 
Consider for instance the case of the inclusion of a section i : B <---+ E of the 
bundle. We then have, for any y E H*(B), 1r*i*y = y. In fact, i* is the composition 
of the horizontal maps in the diagram 
Y f-I ----t) Y ........, U 
but we have seen in the previous example that the Thorn class is mapped to 1.

CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT- HECKMAN THEOREM 
VI.5. Appendix: various notions of Euler classes 
We have already met two notions of Euler classes for fixed point free Sl-actions: in 
Chapter I for 3-manifolds, where we got a number, and in § VI.l.c where a degree-2 
cohomology class was constructed. On the other hand, we have also used the Euler 
class of a (real) oriented vector bundle. In this appendix, we shall investigate the 
relations between these various notions. 
VI.5.a. The case of S1-bundles. Because all relevant definitions can be ulti-
mately expressed in terms of principal bundles (or free actions), it is enough to 
study this case. We shall thus prove: 
Theorem VI. 5. I. 
Let V be an oriented compact 3-manifold endowed with an S1_ 
action. Let B be the oriented surface which is the quotient. If e E H2(B) is the 
Euler class of the S1-bundle V --+ B (in the sense of Chapter VI), then (e, [BJ) E Z 
is the Euler number in the sense of Chapter I. 
Proof We first reduce to the case where B is a sphere. Indeed, write B = B - DoU 
Do so that the bundle is trivialized over each piece. Define a map f : B --+ S2 by 
collapsing the complement of a collar B - Do onto a point (see Figure 9, the small 
white disc is mapped to the upper hemisphere, the complement of the annulus to 
the South pole, the annulus itself onto the lower hemisphere). 
Figure 9 
The map 1* : H2(S2) --+ H 2(B) is an isomorphism. Moreover, by the defini-
tion of f, the bundle V --+ B is exactly the pull-back by f of the bundle over the 
sphere, which is trivial over each hemisphere and described by the same gluing 
data as V --+ B along the equatorial circle. 
We thus assume that B is a sphere S2. We reduce now to the case where 
V --+ S2 is the Hopf bundle. In fact, if g : S2 --+ S2 is a degree-m map, it multiplies 
Euler classes (in the sense of Chapter VI) by m, but in the sense of Chapter I as 
well: we may assume it induces the map z I-) zm on the equatorial circle aDo. In

the diagram

S2~S2 
with obvious notation a' f-t ma and similarly oa' f-t moa, but b' f-t b as it is an 
orbit. We deduce that e = me' (in the sense of Chapter I). 
For the Hopf bundle S3 ~ p1 (C), the statement is clear, as we have e = -1 
in the sense of Chapter I and in the sense of Chapter VI as well by definition 
~u. 
0 
Remark VI.5.2. We have just checked by explicit computation, and used the fact 
that the Hopf bundle S3 ~ P1(C) is universal among the principal S1-bundles 
over surfaces. 
VI.S.b. Complex line bundles. To any principal S1-bundle P ~ B we asso-
ciate (this is actually what is called an associated bundle) a rank-1 complex vector 
bundle E ~ B using the usual linear S1-action over C 
E = P XSl C 
where S1 acts on P x C by t· (v, z) = (tv, h). 
Example VI.5.3. Take P = s2n+1 with the action defining the Hopf fibration. The 
map 
s2n+1 X C ------t pn(c) 
(zo, ... ,Zn; z) t------t [zo, ... ,Zn] 
becomes, taking quotients, the vector bundle 
s2n+! XSl C ------t pn(c). 
Using the injection 
s2n+1 XSl C <----+ pn(c) X cn+! 
[zo, ... ,Zn; z] t------t ([zo, ... , zn], ZOZ, . .. ,Znz) 
we may identify the vector bundle obtained with the tautological bundle <9(-1). 
For any mE Z we also know how to define a bundle called <9(m) over pn(c) 
<9(m) = s2n+1 X C/(zo, ... , Zn; z) rv (tzo, ... , tzn; tmz). 
Conversely, given a complex line bundle E over a manifold B, the choice of a 
Hermitian metric on E allows us to consider its circle bundle S(E), which is then 
a principal S1-bundle over B (thanks to the linear S1-action by rotations in the 
fibers). Of course we may recover E from S(E) as above. 

220 
CHAPTER VI. DUISTERMAAT-HECKMAN THEOREM 
We now have to compare the Euler class of E as an oriented vector bundle 
and the Euler class of S(E) as a principal 8 I -bundle. But we have actually defined 
the class u E H2(pn(C)jZ) in such a way that e(C>(-l)) = -u (see VL4.b). By 
universality, we deduce that they coincide. 
As a conclusion to this appendix, let us now check the assertion about mul-
tiplication by n which we used to define the Euler class in the non-principal case 
and in § VLl.c. 
Proposition VI.5.4. The map z 1--+ zn induces multiplication by n on H2(B8 I ). 
Proof Coming back to the previous examples, we see that we have to prove that 
the Euler class of C>(n) is nu. On the other hand, as this only concerns H2, the 
assertion needs only be checked on pI (C). Consider thus the map 
<p: pI(C) ----t pl(c) 
[x, yJ 
1------+ [xn, ynJ. 
It has degree n, which means that it induces multiplication by n in the group H2. 
Moreover it is (almost) obvious that it satisfies <p*C>(1) ~ c>(n). By naturality we 
thus have 
e(c>(n)) = <p*e(C>(l)) = ne(C>(l)) = nu.

CHAPTER VII 
TORIC MANIFOLDS 
The goal of this chapter is to present a very beautiful family of symplectic mani-
folds endowed with Hamiltonian torus actions, the toric varieties{l). Long before 
their symplectic aspects were understood, toric manifolds were introduced by De-
mazure as closures of complex torus orbits in algebraic manifolds. They have been 
investigated since then by numerous authors(2). These are algebraic varieties which 
can be defined over any field (of course we shall restrict ourselves to the field of 
complex numbers). The prototype is the closure of any orbit of a (complex) torus 
acting in a linear way on a projective space which we already met in Theorem 
IVA.25. We shall present here an alternative description. 
The manifolds under consideration have properties which coincide a priori 
with those which we are interested in: 
- They are endowed with the action of a "big" torus (of maximal dimension: 
half that of the manifold) and with symplectic structures for which this 
action is Hamiltonian. 
- They are constructed from something very close to a convex polyhedron, 
namely a fan (this is exactly what allows us to recover the combinatorics of 
the faces of a convex polyhedron, but not the size of the faces, see VII.l.a). 
Moreover, an invariant ample line bundle on such a manifold allows us to 
construct a convex polyhedron with integral vertices. 
- According to the uniqueness theorem of Delzant (here Theorem IVA.20), 
they are the compact symplectic manifolds endowed with completely inte-
grable torus actions. 
(l)This is to insist on the fact that we are mainly interested in the complex and smooth case 
that we used the word "manifold" in the title of the chapter.

beautifully updated in [35, 36, 37].

CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
After the publication of the convexity theorem (Theorem IV.4.3), various 
authors hurried to remark that, in the case where the cohomology class of the 
symplectic form is the Euler class of a complex line bundle, the polyhedron image 
by the momentum mapping was actually the one that was classically associated 
with the line bundle under consideration (see Jurkiewicz's paper [80] and the proof 
by Khovanski and Arnold of Theorem IV.4.25 in [8] that we have already used). 
Here, we shall describe a complex toric variety(3) as the "quotient" of some 
C N by a complex subtorus of (C*)N. Here, the "quotient" will be the honest 
topological quotient of a big open subset of C N . According to a rather general 
idea of Kirwan, this quotient is identified to the symplectic reduction of some 
regular level of a momentum mapping on C N . We thus meet a description due to 
Delzant, from which we deduce, as in [39] that with each (integral or not) convex 
polyhedron satisfying the necessary conditions implied by Proposition IV.4.12, we 
are able to associate a compact symplectic manifold of dimension double that of 
the polyhedron, the latter being the image of the momentum mapping. 
This construction gives, in a very natural way, many of the classical results 
on the topology of these manifolds (simple connectedness, cohomology, invariant 
line bundles and symplectic forms). 
The ideas in this chapter come from [85]' [8] and, of course, [39]. I have chosen 
to discuss toric varieties here, mainly because I wanted to relate the topological 
aspects of the theory I enjoyed learning in the very beautiful paper by Danilov [38]. 
I enjoyed reading [30] as well, so that I have used it, especially in the description 
of fibrations and of toric surfaces. 
VII.1. Fans and toric varieties 
VII.1.a. Fans. The idea one must have in mind is that a fan is what is left from 
a convex polyhedron when the "sizes" of its faces are forgotten. 
Consider the vector space R n with its integral lattice zn. Let P be a convex 
polyhedron in the dual space (Rn)v. We are thinking of polyhedra as those we 
have met in Chapter IV (this is why they live in a dual space) so that we will 
assume that the faces of P have integral equations, namely equations of the form 
(v,cp) = a for some v E zn and a E R. 
With any face r we may associate its tangent cone (Figure 1). Chose a point m 
o 
in the (relative) interior of r (notation mEr) and define 
O"r = U r· (P - m).

O"r 
Figure 1 
The result is obviously a convex cone (and, as it is easily checked, it does not 
o 
depend on the choice of the point m in r). This is the tangent cone(4). Figure 2 
Figure 2 
shows the polyhedron (on the left) and its tangent cones (in the middle). Notice 
that all the tangent cones have dimension n (if the interior of the polyhedron is 
not empty). For the example shown in Figure 2, the tangent cone 
- to the dimension-2 face is the whole vector space, 
- to each edge is a half-plane limited by the line through 0 parallel to the 
line supporting the edge (note that, for clarity, these cones have not been 
drawn on the picture), 
- to each vertex is a cone with vertex at O. 
Lemma VILI.I. For any two faces r, r', we have 
r c r' ===} O"r C O"r' 
and 
O"rnr' = O"r n O"r' . 
Proof The first property is due to the fact that, if the face r is included in the 
o 
face r', any neighborhood of mEr contains a point of the relative interior of r'. 
This implies the inclusion O"rnr' C O"r n O"r', so that we only need to check the 
(4)The word "tangent" is used here in the same sense that the tangent space to an affine space 
is the underlying vector space.

CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
reverse inclusion. But, if x E ar n ar', there is an m in the relative interior of the 
intersection r n r' such that the half line [mx) contains points of the polyhedron. 
Again, as close to m as we wish, we can find points nand n' of the relative interiors 
of rand r' and, if they are close enough, the half-lines [nx) and [n'x) will also 
contain points of the polyhedron. 
D 
The right part of Figure 2 shows the associated fan, that we define now. This 
is the family 
E(P) = {an 
of the convex dual cones, that is, the family of all the a v, where 
a V = {v E R n I ip(v) ~ OVip E a}. 
Notice that, as usual with duality, 
a c a' ===} a v :J aN. 
In the example of Figure 2, 
- the cone dual to the whole vector space (corresponding to the dimension-2 
face) is the point 0, 
- the cone dual to a half-plane (corresponding to a dimension-l face) is a 
half-line, 
- the cone dual to a cone corresponding to a vertex is a convex cone of 
dimension 2 (in the picture, the "color" of a cone is the same as that of its 
dual). 
A fan in Rn is a family E of convex polyhedral cones in Rn all having 0 as 
a vertex, all generated by integral vectors, and such that 
- any face of a cone in E is a cone in E, 
- the intersection of two cones in E is a face in each of them. 
Remark VIL1.2. One may replace R n by Qn in this definition: the important things 
are the vector space structure, allowing us to define cones, and (last but not least) 
the lattice zn. 
Proposition VILl.3. 
The family of the convex dual cones associated with a convex 
polyhedron the faces of which have integral equations is a fan. The cone associated 
with a codimension-k face has dimension k. 
Here the dimension of a cone is, of course, the dimension of the linear subspace 
it spans. 
Proof Consider a facet r, namely a codimension-l face of the polyhedron. It has 
an equation of the form 
(v,ip) = a 

VIl.1. FANS AND TORle VARIETIES 
229 
for some integral vector v and real number a. The tangent convex cone is one of 
the half-spaces limited by the linear subspace spanned by the facet, say 
Then the dual cone is the half-line generated by v. Now a codimension-k face is 
the intersection of k facets, say r = r 1 n··· n rk, so that 
and that at is the convex cone generated by the vectors Vb ... , Vk defining the 
facets. Hence the result. 
D 
The union E(k) of all the cones of dimension k is called the k-skeleton of E. 
The 1-skeleton E(l) may (and actually will) be considered as the set of the N 
(primitive) vectors in zn which generate the half-lines which are the cones in E(l). 
One of the reasons why people usually prefer to work with the fan instead of 
using the family of tangent convex cones is that the properties of the polyhedron 
are easier to read on the fan. Think for instance of the simple description of 
the cones of the fan in Proposition VII.1.3. Remember also how complicated the 
figure of the tangent cones is (even for instance in the simple case represented in 
Figure 2). Here comes another illustration. 
The support of the fan E is the union lEI of all the cones. We say that a fan 
is complete if its support is the whole space R n . 
Proposition VILl.4. 
The convex polyhedron P is compact if and only if the fan 
E(P) is complete. 
Proof. The convex polyhedron P is compact if and only if its projection on any 
line is compact, and in particular if and only if for any vERn the map 
(Rn)v ~R 
cp~ 
cp{v) 
sends P onto a compact interval. Considering -v as well, we see that P is compact 
if and only if 
'Vv ERn, 3a E R such that 'Vcp E P, cp{v) ~ a. 
As P is a convex polyhedron, a may be considered as the value at v of a linear 
form m on the (relative) interior of some face of P. Thus P is compact if and 
only if 
o 
'VV ERn, 3r face of P and mEr such that '</cp E P, cp{v} - m{v} ;;;:, o. 

230 
CHAPTER VII. TORlC MANIFOLDS 
The last condition is equivalent to the existence for any v of a face r such that v 
is in the dual convex cone: the fan covers the whole space.

VII.1.b. The action of T~ and its subgroups on C N • We denote by TN 
the compact (real) torus of dimension N, 
and T~ the complex torus 
We make these two groups act on C N as usual, 
(tl,"" tN) . (ZI, ... , ZN) = (tIZl, ... , tNZN)' 
Notice(5) that, restricted to (C*)N the action is free and transitive! 
Nontrivial stabilizers. Call (eb ... , eN) the canonical basis in any of the spaces 
For I C {I, ... , N}, denote 
- by e[ the "coordinate" subspace generated by the e/s for i E I, that is, 
- by T[ the corresponding complex toruS(6) 
- by e~ the open cone 
e~ = {z I j ct I {::} Zj = O} 
- and by 1 the complement of I. 
so that Z E e[ if and only if its stabilizer contains Tyand Z E e~ if and only if 
its stabilizer is T y. 
Figure 3 shows the example of eI and e~ for I = {1,2} and I = {I}, in C3. 
(5) Silly as it may seem, this remark is the basis of this chapter. 
(6) Trying to economize on notation which is already very heavy we shall denote in the same way 
both the complex and real torus. No confusion is to be feared.

Subtori. Consider a linear map 
7T : ZN -----7 zn. 
We shall use the same letter 7T (when no confusion is to be feared) for the maps 
7T 0 Q, 7T 0 Rand 7T 0 C. Assume that 7T 0 Q is surjective and call K C ZN the 
kernel of 7T. Similarly K C TN will be the kernel of 
RN /ZN ~ 
Rn/zn. 
The definition of Ke is analogous. All these groups are now acting on eN as 
subgroups of T~. Call k = N - n the dimension of K . 
Proposition VILI.5. The points in the singular orbits of Ke in eN are the points 
of the subspaces e[ for I such that 
K 0 eney# O. 
Proof We know that z lies in a non-principal orbit of Ke if and only if there exists 
a (proper) subset I of indices in {I, ... , N} such that 
z E e[ and Ke n Ty # 1. 
Linearizing the latter condition, we find that K 0 e n ey # O. Note that this gives 
no information on the exceptional orbits (case where KenTy is a finite group). 0 
Example VII.I.6. Put N = n = 2 (and k = 0), and let 7T : Z2 ~ Z2 be the linear 
map, the matrix of which in the canonical bases is (6 ~ ). Then, 7T itself is injective 
(in the notation above, K = 0) but its avatar T2 ~ T2 has a nontrivial kernel 
K ~ {( e, e) I e = ± I} C T2. 
In this case, Ke acts on e 2 without singular orbit, but the point (0,0) is, in itself, 
an exceptional orbit. 
Given the (integral) map 1r , we thus deduce: 

232 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
Proposition VILl.7. The open set 
Un = CN -
U e[ 
KneylO 
is the biggest open subset in CN on which Kc acts without singular orbits. 
D 
Remark VILl.8. Recall that dimK = N - n = k, and that, if #1 > n, then 
K ® C n ey :f:. o. Therefore, in Un, there is no coordinate subspace e[ such that 
#I<k. 
Example VILl.9. Let 7r : zn+1 ---+ zn be the map which sends the n first vectors 
el, ... , en of the canonical basis to the vectors having the same names, representing 
the canonical basis of zn and sending en+! to -(e1 + ... + en). The kernel K is 
the line generated by e1 + ... + en + en+1 and K the diagonal torus (t, ... , t). Here 
Un is cn+1 - O. This is shown in Figure 4 in the case n = 2. 
Figure 4 
Real and imaginary parts. If T c is a complex torus and T the real torus which 
is its compact component, then tc = t EB it, and we shall simply write the element 
9 of Tc as 9 = kexpiX where k E T and X E t. For example, if Tc = C*, then 
T = 8 1 , t = iR and any element z E C* may be written z = ueX where x E R 
and u E 8 1. 
VII.1.c. Closing a fan, toric varieties. Given a fan~, choose a numbering of 
the primitive vectors generating its i-skeleton, 
~(1) = (Xl, ... , XN). 
Consider the unique linear map 
7r:ZN ~zn 
which sends the vectors (e1, ... , eN) of the canonical basis (respectively) onto the 
vectors (Xl' ... ' X N) and assume that 7r ® Q is surjective (this will be the case 
for instance if ~ contains a cone of dimension n). Here n is the dimension of the 

VII.I. FANS AND TORle VARIETIES 
233 
ambient vector space (and lattice) while N is the number of cones of dimension 1 
in the fan. 
Denote (XI the cone generated by the vectors Xi (i E 1), that is, 
(XI = {alxil + ... + arXir I aj ~ 0, 1 = {il , ... , ir }} . 
To the projection 7r, we know how to associate an open subset Un in eN. Just 
as 7r, the latter depends only on the I-skeleton of I:. We now want to construct 
an open subset UE of Un which will really depend on I:. Let us make a restriction: 
we will use smooth fans. A fan I: is smooth if each of its cones is generated by a 
part of a Z-basis of the lattice zn. 
Example VII.l.10. The fan associated with the standard n-simplex (as in Figure 2) 
is smooth, while the one shown on the right part of Figure 5 is not: as 
I=~ ~I ~ ±I, 
the darkest cone does not satisfy the requirement. See also Exercise VII.7. 
Figure 5 
This notion is of course related with the primitivity property of the polyhedra 
we have met in Chapter IV. 
Proposition VII. 1. 11. The fan associated with a polyhedron is smooth if and only if 
the polyhedron is primitive. 
0 
Remark VII.1.I2. As we have assumed that 7r ® Q was surjective, then 
eI n K ® e = {O} ====} #1 ~ n 
and therefore the smoothness condition implies that all the cones of dimension n 
in E are simplicial, that is, generated by n vectors. 

234 
We can now define 
CHAPTER VII. TORlC MANIFOLDS 
Uy:. = eN -
U eI· 
{II(XT~y:.} 
This is an economical way of writing that a point z in Uy:. may have zero coordinates 
Zi, = ... = Zir = 0 if and only if (Xi! , ... ,Xir E ~. 
Notice that the Kc-orbits in Uy:. are dosed, so that the quotient X y:. = Uy:./ Kc is 
Hausdorff. The quotient space X y:. is called the toric variety associated with ~. 
Remark VILl.13. Assume the fan ~ is smooth. Let (x I be one of its cones of 
dimension h. Up to renumbering in ~(1), we may assume that 1 = {l, ... , h}. 
Then 
'[ nK0C ~ {t,a,e, I' (2:>") ~o} 
= {taiei I Laixi = o} 
2=1 
=0. 
Hence (XI E ~ =} eI n K ® e = O. Thus, for a smooth fan ~, the open set Uy:. 
is contained in U7r , so that the complex torus acts on Uy:. without singular orbits. 
Notice that the condition 
(XI E ~ =} eI n K ® e = 0 
is sufficient to get a quotient X y:. with (at most) orbifold singularities. Our smooth-
ness assumption is stronger, as it gives the smoothness of X y:. (hence the termi-
nology). However, the weaker assumption has better properties, such as the fact 
that, if ~' c ~ and if ~ satisfies it, then ~' satisfies it as well. 
Proposition VIL1.14. 
The torie variety X y:. is smooth if and only if the fan ~ is 
smooth. 
Proof The quotient X y:. is smooth if and only if K c has no finite stabilizer in Uy:., 
in other words if and only if 
(XI E ~ =} KnTI = {l}. 
As we assumed the linear map 7r ® Q to be surjective, this is equivalent to 
(XI E ~ and #1 = n =} K n TI = {l} 
as well. But the torus K is the kernel of 7r : RN /ZN -+ Rn /zn. In other words, if 
K contains a nontrivial element, this means that there exists a nonintegral vector 
in QN the image of which lies in zn. Renumbering the xi's if necessary, assume 

VILI. FANS AND TORle VARIETIES 
235 
that I = {I, ... , n}. Then K n T[ is a nontrivial finite group if and only if there 
exist relatively prime integers a1,' .. , an and m ~ 2 such that 
This says that we have found a vector L aiXi of zn the "coordinates" of which 
are relatively prime and which is divisible: thus it is not written in a Z-basis. D 
First properties of X~. By definition, all the cones (Xi of the I-skeleton belong 
to the fan ~, so that 
(Xy ~ ~ ===} #"1 ~ 2 ===} codime[ ~ 2. 
To construct U~, we have thus taken off subspaces of complex codimension ~ 2 
in eN. Hence U~ is 2-connected. The homotopy exact sequence of the fibration 
Kc ----+u~ 1 
x~ 
gives that X ~ is I-connected and that 
1l'2(X~) ---t 11'1 (Kc) 
is an isomorphism. The latter is isomorphic with H2(BKc; Z). Dualizing, we get: 
Proposition VIL1.15. 
The toric variety X ~ is simply connected. Moreover, the 
Euler class of the principal Kc-bundle U~ ---t X~ gives an isomorphism 
D 
Notice that the Euler class of this principal Kc-bundle lives in H2(X E; Z)k 
where k = dim K is a Z-basis of H2(X E; Z). Notice also that H2(BK; Z) can be 
considered as the integral lattice in t*. 
Examples. To begin with, as a zero-th example, the open set UE itself is a toric 
variety of dimension N, associated with the fan ~ obtained when closing~, that is, 
-(1) 
-
~ =(e1, ... ,eN)and(e[E~{=}(X[E~. 
In Figure 2, the reader can imagine the fan pictured on the right as being (in three 
dimensions) in R 3 . 
By definition, the closed fan E contains only cones of the first quadrant. 
Moreover, as soon as N > n (which will always be the case if ~ is complete), it 
contains no cone of dimension N. In other words we then have UE c eN - O. 

236 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
(1) Let ~ be the fan consisting of the unique cone u = {O} eRn. We are not 
exactly in the framework investigated above, since the I-skeleton is empty, 
so that we are looking at the zero map 
1[' : ZO ------t zn. 
The kernel is zero as well, U'E = (C*) n and X'E is the complex torus as 
well. 
(2) Take for (Xl, ... , xn) the canonical basis of zn and let ~ be the set of all 
the cones (of the first quadrant). Then N = n, 1[' = rd, K = 0, Kc = 1 and 
U" = U'E = U'E/Kc = cn. 
The toric variety associated with the first quadrant fan is C n . This is shown 
(in the case n = 2) on the left part of Figure 6. 
c 2 - {O} 
Figure 6 
(3) With the same I-skeleton as in the previous example, define now ~ as the 
set of all the cones in the first quadrant except the n-dimensional one. 
Nothing has changed except U'E from which we must take off e0 = O. Hence 
X'E = U'E = C n -
O. This is what the right part of Figure 6 shows (for 
n = 2). 
(4) Consider again the fan in Figure 2, that is the vectors Xi = ei (1 :( i :( n) 
and Xn+l = -(Xl + . .. + xn) and the fan in Rn consisting of all dimension 
:( n cones on these vectors (at least if n = 2 we have already seen that it 
is the fan associated with the standard simplex). Here U'E = C n+! - 0, the 
map 1[' is that shown in Figure 4, so that K is the diagonal Z, namely the 
set (m, ... , m) E zn+! and therefore Kc is the diagonal C* and X'E is the 
complex projective space pn(c) (once again). 
(5) As on the left part of Figure 7, consider the fan in R2 the I-skeleton of 
which is (el,e2,-el,-e2) and the 2-skeleton of which consists of all the 
cones (Xi,i+l (considering the numbering mod4). Looking for the I's such 
that (XI rf- ~ we find that 
U'E = C4 - ({Zl = Z3 = O} U {Z2 = Z4 = O}) . 

VII.l. FANS AND TORle VARIETIES 
237 
Thus 
The group Kc is C* x C* acting diagonally. The toric variety is the product 
PI(C) x PI(C). 
(6) The open subset UE depends only on the combinatorics of the fan. For 
instance, all the fans in R 2 the I-skeleton of which consists of four vectors 
Xl, X2, X3, X4 and whose 2-skeleton contains all the cones (Xi,HI give the 
same UE = (C2 - 0) X (C2 - 0). Of course, the torus Kc changes. Consider 
the case where Xl = el, X2 = e2, X3 = -el, X4 = -el -ae2 for some integer 
a (right part of Figure 7). This time, the torus K c acts by 
The toric variety X E we get this way is a Hirzebruch surface (already met 
in Exercise IV.4) as we shall prove in Section VII.4. 
Figure 7 
(7) Here is an example of a nonsmooth fan. We have shown one in Figure 5. To 
simplify the investigation here, concentrate on the cone which was responsi-
ble for the trouble there and consider Figure 8. Working in Z2, the I-skeleton 
is Xl = el, X2 = el + 2e2. As the determinant of (Xl, X2) equals 2, this is not 
a Z-basis. Add now the cone generated by Xl and X2. Then UE = Urr = C2, 
and K = O. The group K is the kernel of 
1f = (1 1) : 
T2 ----> T2 
02' 
which we have already considered in §VII.l.b, where we saw that the 
group K is generated by (-1, - 1) E T2. The variety X E is the quotient

of this complex surface: the map

descends to the quotient as an injection X E --+ e 3, the image of which is 
the surface satisfying the equation Z2 = XY.

at least two zero coordinates, and, if it has only two they are not con-

The big torus. From the action of the torus T~, the toric manifold X I; keeps an 
operation of a torus. Indeed, the T~-action descends to the quotient and induces 
a T~ / K e-action on X I;, which is therefore endowed with the action of a complex 
torus we shall denote Qe, the real torus it contains being denoted Q. We have 
dime XI; = dimeUI; - dime Ke = N - k = dime Qe = n. 
Moreover, the complex torus Qe has an open dense orbit in XI;. Each cone (XI 
in ~ defines an open subset XI in XI;. For example, the cone {O} = (X0 defines 
U0 = (C*)N = T~ and X0 = T~/Ke = Qe, which thus appears as an open 
dense subset in X I;. The torus Q is the big torus of the toric manifold X I;. 
Morphisms. The map we have used in the last example above is a special case 
of a morphism of fans. A morphism 
f : ~ ------t E' 
is an integral linear map 
f : zn ------t zn' 
such that, for any cone ()" of~, there exists a cone ()"' of~' for which f(()") c ()"'. For 
instance, in the example of the blow up, the linear map f is the identity Z2 ----. Z2, 
giving a morphism of fans ~' ----. ~ (I apologize for the inversion in the notation). 
Proposition VII.1.16. A morphism of fans ~ ----. ~' defines a map

We must now compare the ~tions of Kc ~nd K~ on these open subsets. The

so that f is equivariant and defines a map

which is equivariant with respect to the big torus actions.

and (e2' -el +be2, is mapped to the fan defining Pl(C) by a projection, the 
kernel of which is the central vector (Figure 11). We shall see in §VII.2.b 
that this is the projection of a line bundle onto pl(C). 
Fixed points and complex curves. A cone of dimension n in ~ corresponds 
to a fixed point of the torus Qc in the toric manifold X ~> This can be deduced 
from the examples of the fans shown in Figure 6 above. 
Consider now a cone (XI of dimension n - 1. If #f = n - 1, the coordinate 
subspace ey is a subspace of C N , of dimension k + 1, the set ey n UE is an open 
subset (as (XI E ~) on which the complex torus Kc still acts. We thus have the 
inclusion 
eynUE/Kc C UE/Kc 
of a complex curve in X E . As it is endowed with an action of the torus Qc, it 
is a Pl(C) . There are two fixed points, corresponding to the adjacent cones of 
dimension n. This is shown in Figure 12.

UE ----+ X E · 

VII.I. FANS AND TORle VARIETIES 
243 
A convenient way to present UE from the point of view of the K c-bundle UE -t X E 
is the following: 
Lemma VILl.19. Let UI be the open subset (complement of coordinate subspaces) 
UI = {z E CN I Zj = 0 ::::} j E I} . 
This is the product of #1 copies of C* and of #1 copies of C and we have 
UE = U UI· 
(xIEE 
Proof We may write UI = eI x ey. For any Z E CN , call I(z) C {I, ... , N} the 
set of the indices of those coordinates which are zero (thus Z E UI(z))' We have 
and 
Z E eI -¢::::::} 1 C I(z) 
Z E UE -¢::::::} (z E eI ::::} (Xy E E) 
-¢::::::} (I C I(z) ::::} (XI E E) 
-¢::::::} (XI(z) E E 
so z E UE <=> (XI(z) E E <=> UI(z) CUE. 
D 
In the case of a smooth fan, and thus of a principal Kc-bundle UE -t XE , 
the open subsets UI of UE give local trivializations of the bundle. 
Proposition VILl.20. With each cone (x I of the smooth fan E is associated an open 
subset XI of the toric variety X E , over which the principal Kc-bundle UE -t X E 
is trivialized. 
Proof Choose a basis of K. Let A be the matrix (with k columns and N rows) 
giving this basis in the canonical basis of eN. The torus Kc acts on eN by 
(Ul, ... ,Uk)· (Zl, ... ,ZN) = (UmlZl, ... ,UmnZN) 
where um ; is the monomial in the Uj'S given by the multi-exponent mi E Zk which 
is the i-th line of A. 
Consider this action on one of the open subsets UI we are interested in. 
Remark first that the #1 = n case is actually sufficient; as the fan is complete, 
any cone (xJ E E with #J < n is a face of a cone (XI E E with #1 = n and then 
UJ C UI. Furthermore, we merely have to change the numbering of the vectors in 
the I-skeleton of E to be able to assume that I = {I, ... , n}. Then 
UI = {(Zl, ... , ZN) I Zn+l # 0, ... , ZN # O}. 
The fact that Kc then acts freely on UI corresponds to the fact that the k last 
rows (recall that N = n + k) of the matrix A give an invertible (over the integers) 

244 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
matrix. In other words, we can change the parametrization of Kc in such a way 
that the action is written: 
Denote (in analogy with homogeneous coordinates in the projective space) 
[Zl, .. . , ZN] the element in XE which represents the class of (Zl, ... , ZN) E UE 
modulo Kc. We can define a section 0"] : XI ---+ UI to the projection UI ---+ XI by

VII.2. Symplectic reduction and convex polyhedra 
o 
In the previous section, we have associated, with every convex polyhedron, a fan. 
And to any fan a toric manifold. We try now to go back and to associate, to the 
toric manifold, a polyhedron. 
Recall that a toric manifold X E of complex dimension n is endowed with the 
action of a torus Q of dimension n, its big torus. 
The idea (of Delzant and) of what follows is to prove that X E can be endowed 
with symplectic forms for which the action of the compact torus Q is completely 
integrable and the image of the momentum mapping is one of the convex polyhedra 
leading to the fan E-the shape of the polyhedron determines the fan, the volumes 
of its faces then determine the symplectic form. This way, we will prove (this is 
Theorem VII.2.1 below) that all the primitive polyhedra are indeed images of 
momentum mappings of completely integrable torus actions(7). 
Look once again at the example of pn(c) as a quotient of Cn+1 - {O} (this 
is one of the examples above). We consider the fan described above and shown 
in Figure 2. The closed fan E is just the first quadrant fan in Rn+l, with all the 
possible cones of dimension ~ n, so that UE is C n+! - {O}. The linear map 
7r : Zn+ 1 ____ Zn 
maps ei to Xi and en+l to - L Xi, so that the torus K is the diagonal C* and 
X E is indeed pn(c). What we aim to do now is to understand pn(c) with its 
reduced symplectic forms, in this context. 
(7)which, together with the uniqueness theorem IV.4.20, constitute the classification theorem of 
Delzant [39). 

VII.2. SYMPLECTIC REDUCTION AND CONVEX POLYHEDRA 
245 
For this particular toric variety, let us make a few observations: 
(1) The complex space Cn+1 can be replaced by the compact S2n+1, noticing 
that s2n+1 X ]0, +oo[ £:! Cn+1 - 0. 
(2) The previous decomposition is compatible with that of C* as the product 
Sl x ]0, +00[, and thus pn(C) is the quotient of s2n+1 by Sl. 
(3) Moreover, all this can be done in the Hamiltonian framework: the sphere 
is a level manifold of a momentum mapping and the projective space is its 
symplectic reduction. 
(4) Of the action of the torus Tn+! on cn+1, there remains a (Hamiltonian) 
Tn-action on the projective space, for which the image of the momentum 
mapping is the standard simplex in R n . .. polyhedron, the associated fan 
of which is precisely the one we used to construct pn(c) as a toric variety 
(see Figure 2)! 
Of course, the aim of this section is to generalize the above remarks to all 
toric manifolds. 
VII.2.a. Delzant's existence theorem. 
Theorem VII.2.1. 
Let P be a primitive polyhedron in (R n) v. Let E be the fan 
of R n associated with P. There exists, on the toric manifold X ~, a symplectic 
form such that the action of the compact component of the big torus of X ~ is 
Hamiltonian and P is the image of the momentum mapping. 
Together with Theorem IV.4.20, this asserts the identity between primitive 
polyhedra and compact connected symplectic manifolds endowed with the inte-
grable action of a torus. 
Proof of the theorem 
First step. Following Delzant [39], we describe the convex polyhedron P in (Rn) v 
as the intersection of some n-dimensional affine subspace with the first quadrant 
in a big space (RN)V. 
Here N will be the number of facets of the polyhedron. We will write equa-
tions of the hyperplanes spanned by these facets in the form 
(Xi, rp) = Ai 1 ~ i ~ N 
where the vectors Xi ERn have been chosen integral, primitive and such that the 
polyhedron is 
As above, we consider the projection 
7r: RN ----* R n

which sends the vectors of the canonical basis to the Xi'S and the dual inclusion 
tn: (Rn)V ---t (RN)V. 
Consider the affine space II" through A = (AI, ... , AN) parallel to the image of 
(Rn)v in (RNt, so that P can be considered as the intersection of II>. with the 
first quadrant, that is, with the image of the momentum mapping 
J-l: C N ---t (RN)V 
for the standard TN -action. 
Let us look now at the torus j : K C TN as above and at the momentum 
mapping 
J-l': CN ~ 
(RN)V -'!!..- t*. 
Let rJ = p(A). The projection p is the transpose of the injection j : teRN, namely, 
't/<p E t*,'t/x E t, 
(p(<p),x) = (<p,j(x)). 
The kernel p-l(O) is thus the annihilator of tin RN, that is, tn(Rn)v, and p-l (rJ) 
is the subspace parallel to tn(Rn)v through A, namely II", so that 
J-L'-l(rJ) = J-l-l(II" n J-l(C N )) = J-l-l(p). 
Notice that J-l is obviously proper, and we have assumed P to be compact, so that 
J-l'-l(rJ) is compact. 
Let us prove now that the torus K acts freely on J-l'-l (rJ). Fix a point z E 
J-l,-l (rJ) C C N . Let I = {i 1, ... , ir } be the set of indices of the coordinates of z 

VII.2. SYMPLECTIC REDUCTION AND CONVEX POLYHEDRA 
247 
that are zero, 
Zi = 0 if and only if i E I. 
The intersection of the corresponding hyperplanes 
(XiI, <p) = AiI, ... , (Xir' <p) = Air 
is not empty, and its intersection with P is not empty either, since p,( z) belongs 
to its image in ITA' So that there is a vertex of the polyhedron in this intersec-
tion and, by the primitivity assumption, there exist indices ir+ 1, ... ,in such that 
(XiI, ... , Xin ) is an integral basis of the lattice zn. The linear map 
IT: RN ----+ R n 
is thus (of course, we could have to renumber coordinates) 
Rn x Rk ----+ Rn 
ei I-------t ei 1 ~ i ~ n 
ej I-------t Xj n + 1 ~ j ~ N. 
The kernel of IT is parametrized by 
and of course the torus K = R k /Zk is parametrized, as a subgroup of T = 
R N /ZN, by the same formulae. 
Now the coordinates Zl,"" ZN of our point Z are all nonzero, so that the 
stabilizer of this point is trivial. Hence we have proved that the K -action on p,'-l ("') 
is free. The quotient is a compact 2n-dimensional manifold Wand it is endowed 
with a reduced symplectic form w".,. 
Moreover the Hamiltonian action of the n-dimensional torus Q = TN / K on 
C N descends to the quotient and so does the map p,. It takes values in the subspace 
ITA and its image is, by construction, the polyhedron P. 
Second step. Let us prove now that the manifold W is, indeed, the toric manifold 
X E associated with the fan E defined by P. On the one hand, we have performed 
the quotient of the open set UE by the complex cone Kc (think of C N - {O} with 
the C*-action). On the other one, we have performed the quotient of the compact 
set p"-l(,,,) by the compact torus K (think of S2N-l with the Sl-action). 
We need first to remark that p"-l(,,,) is contained in UE , namely that, if 
Z E p"-l(,,,) and Zi = 0 for all i E I, then the cone (Xy E E. But this is exactly 
what we have done above in the proof of the freeness of the K-action. 
We follow now a general argument due to Kirwan ([85, Theorem 7.4]). Choose 
a metric on e* and consider the function f : UE -+ R which, to z, associates the 

248 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
real number II/-l'(z) -1]11 2 • The function f is nonnegative and it is minimal on 
/-l'-1(1]). Its derivative is given by 
Tzf(X) = 2(/-l'(z) -1])' Tx/-l'(X), 
hence it vanishes at the points of /-l,-1(1]) and at the points z such that 1m T z/-l' C 
(/-l'(z) - 1])1. ... but we have assumed that z E Ur" where we know that K acts 
freely and thus, that /-l' has maximal rank. So that our only critical points are the 
points of /-l,-l(",). Hence for any z E Ur" the gradient trajectory descending from z 
will reach a point in /-l'-l(",). 
Let us calculate this gradient: 
(gradz f, X) = 2 «/-l' (z) - 1]), T z/-l' (X)) 
= 2 (trz/-l'(/-l'(z) -1]),X) 
= 2 (illl(z)-lIz W, X) 
=2wz(/-l'(z)-1] ,X) 
'----'.--"--------'..z 
= -2i(/-l'(z) -1] ,X). 
''---'---'-----'-z 
Hence gradz f = -2i/-l'(z) -", , where of course we have used the metric to iden-
'----'.--"--------'..z 
tify /-l'(z) -", with an element of t and underlining denotes as usual the associated 
fundamental vector field. Thus the gradient flow consists of exponentials of ele-
ments of it: this is the "imaginary part" of the torus Kc (the analogue of ]0, +oo[ 
in the torus C*). 
In particular, any gradient trajectory is included in a Kc-orbit. From what 
we have said before, we derive that each Kc-orbit meets /-l,-1(1]). Let us now show 
that they meet along a unique K-orbit, that is to say that if z E /-l,-l(",), then 
Kc . z n /-l,-l(",) = K· z. 
Assuming that /-l' (9 . z) = ", for some 9 EKe we shall show that we then 
have 9' z = k· z for some k E K. As /-l,-l(",) is K-invariant, we may assume that 
9 = expiX for some X E t. We thus want to check that 9' z = z. 
Consider the function h : R --+ R defined by h(t) = /-l'«expitX) . z) . X. We 
have h(O) = h(l) = 1]'X and therefore h' must vanish between 0 and 1: ::Ito E [0,1] 
such that h' (to) = O. But 
h'(t) = Ty/-l'(iXy)' X 
= wy(iXy,Xy) = ± IIXyl12 
putting y = exp itX to save notation. For Yo = exp itoX, we thus have X Yo = 0 
and therefore expitX fixes Yo and z. 
D 
Notice that the fan (namely the u/s) determines the manifold, but this is the 
polyhedron (the 1\ 's) which determines its symplectic form. 

VII.2. SYMPLECTIC REDUCTION AND CONVEX POLYHEDRA 
249 
Compactness of X ~> In the case of a fan defined by a polyhedron P, we have 
expressed X E as p,,-1 (TJ) / K where K was a compact group. For X E to be compact, 
it is thus necessary (and sufficient) that p,,-1 (TJ) is. 
On the other hand, p,,-l(TJ) = p,-1(p-1(TJ)) and it is clear that p, is proper. 
We need thus only know when p-1(TJ) nIm(p,) is compact, but this is precisely the 
polyhedron under consideration. We have therefore proved that the toric manifold 
X E is compact if and only if one of the polyhedra defining the fan ~ is compact. 
Taking Proposition VIL1.4 into account, we thus also have proven: 
Proposition VIL2.2. The toric manifold X E associated with a convex polyhedron is 
compact if and only if the fan ~ is complete.

Xl + Al ~ 0, 
X2 + A2 ~ 0, 
-(Xl + X2) + A3 ~ o. 
These inequalities define indeed a triangle if and only if Al + A2 + A3 > o. 
The linear map 7r maps ei to Xi for i = 1,2 and e3 to -Xl -
X2. Thus the 
image of the transpose trr is the plane X + y + z = 0, while II).. is the plane 
X + y + Z = Al + A2 + A3 
which does intersect the positive quadrant when Al + A2 + A3 > o.

Xl + Al ~ 0, 
X2 + A2 ~ 0, 
-(Xl + X2) + A3 ~ 0, 
-X2 + A4 ~ 0, 
which define a trapezium if and only if

Al + A3 > A4·

is possible to associate, with any fan, polyhedra. 
Polyhedra. Using the construction in the proof of Theorem VII.2.I, we prove: 
Proposition VIL2.4. Let ~ be a fan in R n. Let C be the subset of t* consisting of 
the ry 's such that the intersection of p-l(ry) with the first quadrant is a polyhedron, 
the associated fan of which is 1::. Then C is an open convex cone in t* . 
Proof Consider a cone a of dimension n in the fan ~. Call J(a) the set of indices 
(il, ... , in) such that the corresponding cones of the I-skeleton generate a. Given 
A E RN, define a linear form 'Pa,).. by 
This defines a linear form on R n, since the xi's with i E J (a) constitute a basis of 
(the lattice in) Rn. Hence we have a finite set of points 
{'Pa,)..}aEE(n) C (Rn)v. 
According to the Krein- Milman theorem, the convex set 
is the convex hull of the set of 'Pa,).. if and only if for all i and for all a, 
'Pa,).. + Ai ? O. 
Hence the set of A'S such that P).. is the convex hull of the 'Pa,).. is a closed convex 
OO~.

The boundary of the cone C consists of the A's for which there exist an n-cone 
a and a vector Xi not in a (that is, i rf. I(a)) such that 4?a,A(Xi) = -A( through 
the vertex corresponding to a, there are too many supporting hyperplanes. Here 
are two examples of this situation, continuations of Examples VII.2.3. 
Examples VIL2.5 
(1) In the case of the triangle, the map p : (R3)V --+ t* is the projection 
(x, y, z) f---t X + y + z. A real number is in the image of the set of (A1' A2, A3) 
such that A1 + A2 + A3 > ° 
if and only if it is positive. The cone C c t* is 
the positive half-line in this case. 
(2) In the case of the trapezium, the dimension of t* is 2, the map p : (R4)V --+ 
t* sends (x, y, z, t) to (u, v) = (x + y + z, y + t), so that the inequalities 
A1 + A2 + A3 > 0, 
A2 + A4 > 0, 
A1 + A3 > A4 
define the cone 
C = {(u, v) E R2 I u > 0, v> ° 
and u > v} . 
This is suggested in Figure 16. Notice that, when the fat dotted line moves 
up, the polyhedron will change its shape (we shall be on the boundary 
of the cone C), becoming a triangle, then stop to be convex (we shall be 
outside C), the inequalities defining the empty set.

Figure 16 
In order that the interior of the cone C be nonempty, there must exist A = 
(A1,". ,AN) such that the #"'f.(n) points 4?a,A of (Rn)v are the vertices of their 
convex hull. This is not the case, for instance, for the fan described in Figure 17. 
This is a very classical example (see [38]). The fan consists of the convex cones on 
the triangles shown (this is a triangulation of a tetrahedron with a vertex cut off), 
the origin (vertex of the cones) is in the interior of the polyhedron. 
Let 9 : R n = I ~ I --+ R be a convex function such that 

252 
CHAPTER VII. TORlC MANIFOLDS 
Figure 17 
- it is linear on each n cone of E, but 
- distinct cones correspond to distinct linear forms. 
Such a function g is usually said to be strictly convex (as g is piecewise linear, it is 
not strictly convex in the usual sense, however, this terminology is very convenient 
in the present context, so that we will use it). The problem with the fan evoked 
in Figure 17 is that a convex function on such a fan cannot be strictly convex. 
Corollary VII.2.6. Let g : Rn --+ R be a strictly convex map, with respect to a 
smooth complete fan E. Then the convex set 
P = {cp E (Rn)V I CP(Xi) ~ g(Xi)} 
is a convex compact polyhedron, the fan associated to which is E. 
D 
Line bundles. It turns out (see [38, 30]) that integral strictly convex functions 
on E correspond to ample, and even to very ample line bundles on X ~> Recall 
that these are the line bundles which have enough sections so that the sections 
can be used to define an embedding of the toric variety X ~ into a big projective 
space. .. and, by pull back, a Kahler form on it. 
This is completely coherent with the fact that the strictly convex functions 
are those which allow us to define a (reduced) symplectic form on X~. 
In this paragraph, we consider all the complex line bundles E --+ X ~ the 
total space of which are themselves toric manifolds. 
Let g : Rn --+ R be a continuous map satisfying the two properties: 
(1) This is the restriction of a linear map gO' on each n-cone a E E(n). 
(2) It takes integral values on lEI n zn. 
Remark VIL2.7. This is equivalent to requiring that g is the projection of an 
integral linear map, still denoted g : R N --+ R. We shall consider g sometimes as 
one and sometimes as the other. 
With such a map, we associate a fan Eg in Rn+l = Rn x R which is more 
or less the graph of g on E:

Notice that the projection zn+l = zn X Z ----; zn defines a morphism from 
the fan ~g to the fan ~ and thus also a map X ~g ----; X~. 
Proposition VIL2.8. The toric variety X ~g is smooth if and only if X ~ is. It is 
endowed with a natural map 
X ~g ------t X ~ 
which makes it a complex line bundle over X ~ . 
Proof The former assertion follows immediately from Proposition VII.1.14, since 
~g is obviously complete if and only if ~ is. To prove the latter, consider carefully 
the open subset U~g of eN +l: 
and notice that

by g(ei) = 0 for 1:::;; i :::;; nand g(en+l) = m, we get the bundle <9( -m) (see §VI.5). 
For n = 1, Figure 18 shows the bundles <9( -1) and <9(1) over Pl(e). Looking back 
O( - 1)

Figure 18 
at the example illustrated by Figure 10 (Examples VII.l.18), notice that there is 
a map pl(e) -; <9(m) induced by a morphism of fans if and only if m ~ 0 ... 
and this is indeed the condition under which the bundle <9(m) has a holomorphic 
section. 

VII.2. SYMPLECTIC REDUCTION AND CONVEX POLYHEDRA

Remark VIL2.10. If <p is already a linear map on zn, the bundle obtained is trivial. 
Indeed, the bundle associated with <p = 0 is trivial, since the torus Kc does not 
act on the factor C in this case. Then, for <p E (zn) v, define rp : zn X Z -+ zn X Z 
by (a, b) 1--+ (a, b + <p( a)) and remark that the map rp defines an isomorphism from 
I:o onto I:<p and thus an isomorphism from X ~o onto X ~g over X~. 
We may thus consider that we have defined a map 9 1--+ X ~g from the set 
of all linear maps ZN -+ Z (modulo those zn -+ Z) into the set of isomorphism 
classes of Q-invariant complex line bundles over X~. 
The space (ZN) v / (zn) V is just KV. As to the set of line bundles, and although 
we did not require any analyticity, we might call it PicQ (X ~). 
The map in question is a morphism of groups; if gl, g2 E (ZN)Y, the group 
K c acts on U~ x C 
- using gl by U'l (x,y) = (U' x,gl(U)-l y), 
- using g2 by U'2 (x,y) = (U' X,g2(U)-l y), 
- and using gl + g2 by 
U . (x, y) = (u . x, (gl ( u) g2 (u)) -1 y), 
which correspond to the tensor product of line bundles (this is where the 
group structure on PicQ(X~) comes from). 
Composing with the Euler class, we get a group morphism 
K V ------+ PicQ(X~) ------+ H2(X~; Z) 
which is just the isomorphism of Proposition VII.l.15. 
VII.2.c. Polyhedra as projections. In the construction of Delzant above, we 
have used the fact that any convex polyhedron is the intersection of the "first 
quadrant" cone with some affine subspace. A different viewpoint is to consider 
the polyhedron as the projection of a big simplex. I describe this idea now and 
show that this leads to a description of toric manifolds which we have already met 
(in § IV.4.g) in connection with the proof of Kushnirenko's theorem .

To simplify the exposition, let us assume here that P is a compact convex 
polyhedron with integral vertices in (R n) v. Let m be the number of its vertices, 

256 
CHAPTER VII. TORlC MANIFOLDS 
denoted Ao, ... , Am - I and let ~m-I be the standard simplex, the vertices of which 
are (0, el, ... , em-I) in (Rm-I)V. Notice that m - 1 ~ n. Let 
IV: (zm-It ~ 
(zn)v 
be the integral affine map defined by r (0) = Ao, r (ei) = Ai for 1 ~ i ~ m - l. 
It maps the simplex ~m-I to the convex hull of the Ai's, namely onto P (see 
Figure 19). Choose the origin of (zn)v at Ao and consider the transpose of r, 
still an integral map 
I:Rn~Rm-1 
and the map it induces at the level of tori, still denoted I, 
I : Tn = R n /zn ~ 
Rm-I/zm- I = T m- I. 
We know that ~m-I is the image of the momentum mapping 
J.l: pm-I(C) ~ 
(Rm-It 
associated with the Tm-I-action, so that P is the image of the same pm-I(c) by 
the momentum mapping 
J.l': pm-I(c) ~ 
(Rn)v 
associated with the Tn-action. Let us now consider the fan ~ = ~p defined by the 
polyhedron P. 
Lemma VIL2.11. The integral map I defines a morphism of fans from ~p to the 
fan ~~ associated with the simplex ~m-I. 
Proof Recall from Proposition VII.l.3 that the vertices of the polyhedron corre-
spond to the cones of maximal dimension in the fan (and in particular, m is the 
number #~(n) of dimension-n cones). Let A be a vertex of P and s a vertex of ~ 
such that fV (s) = A. By convexity, we have also the inclusion 
r(Ts ) C TA 
(the T'S are the tangent cones). Dualizing, we get 
f(T~) CT;. 
Hence the cones of dimension n of ~ are all mapped into cones of ~ 
~. As the fan ~ 
is complete, all its cones are sub cones of cones of dimension n, so that I is indeed 
a morphism of fans. 
0 
Hence, f defines a map 
X E ~pm-I(c) 
and our polyhedron is the image of X E under J.l'. Notice that, if P is primitive, ~ 
is a smooth fan. This is an alternative way to construct a symplectic manifold the 

VII.3. COHOMOLOGY OF X I; 
257 
image of which is the polyhedron P (at least if the latter has integral vertices). 
Notice that, by construction, Tn is the big torus of X E . 
I also want to check that the construction of the "manifold" V s in § IV.4.g 
gives, indeed, a toric manifold X E. Recall that V s was constructed as the closure 
of the orbit of the point [1, ... , 1] E pm-l (C) under the action of a complex 
torus. This construction is the same as we explained just above: starting from 
0:0, ... ,O:m-l E (zn) v, we have constructed 
then we have looked at the dual map f at the torus level, namely at 
f : Tn ----+ Tm-l 
U ~ 
(U"'1-"'0, ... ,u"'m-1-"'0) 
and eventually we have looked at its action on pm-l(c) as a subgroup of Tm-l, 
namely, as 
[

[

"'m-1-"'0] 
U· Zo, ... ,Zm-l = Zo,U 
Zl,···,U 
Zm-l 
- [ "'0 
"'m-1] 
-
U 
Zo, ... , U 
Zm-l . 
Then we have defined V s as the closure of the orbit of the point [1, ... ,1] under 
the complexified torus Te. According to our previous constructions, this closure 
must be the toric manifold X E . Notice that there is no reason why the convex 
hull S of the points 0:0, ... , O:m-l should be a primitive polyhedron, so that our 
fan ~ and our toric "manifold" X E can perfectly well not be smooth. 
VII.3. Cohomology of X E 
VII.3.a. Euler classes of line bundles and reduced symplectic forms. 
We have an isomorphism 
H2(BK; Z) ----+ H2(XE; Z) 
given by the Euler class of the principal Kc-bundle, and H2(BK; Z) can be con-
sidered as the integral lattice in £*. Now, to any complex line bundle on X E is 
associated an element of H2 (X E; Z), while, with any polyhedron P, we have asso-
ciated a symplectic form Wry and, in particular, a cohomology class in H2 (X E; R). 
Recall from Proposition VII.2.4 that C c £* denotes the open cone of elements rJ 
corresponding to polyhedra. 
Proposition VIL3.I. The Euler class of the complex line bundle defined by the 
strictly convex integral function gEe c £* is the cohomology class of the reduced 
symplectic form associated with the integral polyhedron corresponding with g. 

258 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
Corollary VIL3.2 (Delzant [39]). The map 
C --+ H2(X'E;R) 
TJ I----t [w'1l 
extends to a linear isomorphism 
~* --+ H2(X'E; R), 
the restriction to the integral lattice of which coincides with the isomorphism 
H2(BK; Z) --+ H2(X 'E; R) 
given by the Euler class of the principal bundle U'E --t X'E. 
Proof of the proposition. Once a basis of K is chosen, we may write the torus K c 
as a product of k factors C*. We know that a Z-basis of H2(X'E; Z) is constituted 
with the k components of the Euler class of the principal Kc-bundle U'E --t X 'E. 
Let 9 be an integral element in t* and TJ = gle E ~* be its projection, such 
that TJ E j.l'(U'E)' Call cr (= dz/z) the volume form on 8 1. Consider the principal 
8 1-bundle which is the circle bundle of X'Eg --t X'E: 
j.l,-1(TJ) x 8 1 ---+ j.l,-1(TJ) 
1 
1 
(the vertical arrows are the quotients by the dimension-k compact tori K', K). 
On j.l,-1(TJ) x 8 1, a EB cr is a connection I-form for the trivial bundle repre-
sented by the upper horizontal arrow. The torus K' acts on j.l,-1(TJ) x 8 1 with the 
fundamental vector fields (Y, -TJ(Y)). In particular, 
'v'Y E ~, i:da EB cr) = ira - TJ(Y) = 0 
and therefore a EB cr descends to the quotient and gives a I-form of connection 
on X'Eg' Its curvature form, the cohomology class of which is the Euler class of 
XEg --t X E , is the reduced symplectic form w'1' 
0 
Proof of the corollary. The convex open cone j.l'(U'E) generates ~* by definition. 
Moreover, the map TJ 
1---+ [w'1l is affine according to the Duistermaat-Heckman 
theorem (see Theorem VI.2.3), thus there is no difficulty to extend it as an affine 
map 
~* --+ H2(XE; R). 
It suffices now to apply the previous proposition together with Theorem VI.2.3 to 
see that the "slope" of this map is given by a Z-basis of H2(X E; Z). It therefore 
cannot avoid being a diffeomorphism.

VII.3. COHOMOLOGY OF XE

Corollary VIL3.3. Assume ~ is smooth and complete. Let Ui be the Euler class of 
the complex line bundle over X I; which is associated with ei E (ZN) v. The group 
H2(X I;; Z) is the commutative group generated by (U1' ... ,UN), with the relations 
( tg(ei)Ui = 0) 
2=1

Proof We have an explicit description of K* and of the above isomorphism: 
0------+ (zn) V ------+ (ZN) V ------+ H2(XI;; Z) ------+ O.

VII.3.h. The cohomology ring. Assume now that the toric manifold X I; is 
described by a polyhedron P C q*: we fix a Q-invariant symplectic form on XI; 
and look at the corresponding momentum mapping 
f..L : X I; ------+ q*. 
Choosing a vector X E q, we get a Morse function 
f..Lx : X I; ------+ R 
x f---+ (f..L(x) , X)). 
As in Chapter IV, the critical points of f..Lx correspond to the vertices of the 
polyhedron (and maybe one or two edges). Choosing X generically, all the critical 
points are isolated. Any vertex can be given an index (relative to X). This is the 
number of edges starting from this vertex with a directing vector <p such that 
<p(X) < 0 (we call these edges descending edges). For instance, in Figure 20, the 
vertex A has index 0, B has index 1, C has index 2 and D has index 3. 
D 
\\ ...... :-.. 
A..................... it· 
Figure 20 
Recall that our polyhedron is primitive and in particular simple, so that the 
number of descending edges of any vertex is the dimension of the face these edges 

260 
CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
generate. For instance, in Figure 20, the shaded face corresponds to the negative 
bundle at the critical point corresponding to the vertex C. 
Proposition VIL3.4. Let M be a vertex of the polyhedron P, corresponding to the 
critical point m of J.tx. The index of m as a critical point of J.tx is twice the index 
of M relative to X as a vertex of the polyhedron. 
D 
Hence, the integral homology of X ~ consists of classes represented by the 
faces of the polyhedron. Recall that the faces of dimension k of P correspond to the 
cones of codimension k of ~ and to submanifolds of X ~ of complex dimension k. 
Moreover the intersections of these submanifolds are given by 
X"nr = X" n Xr 
so that we get all the cohomology classes from the degree-2 ones and we have 
proved: 
Theorem VIL3.5. 
Assume E is the smooth and complete fan corresponding to a 
polyhedron P. The group H*(X~; Z) is a free Abelian group of rank the number an 
of cones of dimension n in E, this number being the Euler characteristic of X ~ 
as well. 
The cohomology ring H* (X ~; Z) is generated by its classes of degree 2. 
D 
Corollary VIL3.6. If ~ is the smooth and complete fan corresponding to a polyhe-
dron P, the composition 
H*(BT;Z) ~ 
H*(BK;Z) ~ 
H*(X~;Z) 
is a surjective ring homomorphism. 
D 
Notice that, if we had taken care of the algebraicity questions, we would have 
also proved: 
Corollory VIL3.7. If ~ is the smooth and complete fan corresponding to a polyhe-
dron P, the natural map from the Chow ring to the cohomology 
A*(X~) ~ 
H*(X~; Z) 
is a surjective ring homomorphism. 
D 
Being slightly more careful, it is possible to describe completely the cohomol-
ogy ring. 
Theorem VIL3.8. 
The cohomology ring H* (X ~; Z) is isomorphic with the quo-
tient Z[Ul, ... , UN 1/ (J + J), where J is the ideal generated by the linear rela-
tions (:Eg(ei)ui = O)gE(zn)* and J that generated by the monomials uI such that 
(XI f/.~. 

VII.3. COHOMOLOGY OF X E 
261 
Example VIL3.9. Consider the fan L: defining the complex projective space pn(C) 
(see Example (4), page 236). The linear map zn+l -+ zn maps the first n vectors 
of the canonical basis to el, ... ,en and the last to - I: ei, so that the dual map 
(zn)v -+ (zn+l)V is ei f---+ ei -
e~+1' Hence H2(pn(c); Z) is isomorphic to Z (as 
expected!), generated by any of the Ui (corresponding to the I-skeleton). Now, to 
get the cohomology ring, we must look at the idealJ. namely we must look at the 
monomials U~' ... u~ for (XiI'" Xim rf. L:. The only such cone is (Xl ... Xn+ I, so 
that J is generated by UI ... Un+l and Theorem VIL3.S asserts, in this case, that 
H*(pn(C); Z) ~ Z[UI,.'" Un+1]/(UI + ... + Un+l, UI'" un+d 
~ Z[u]/un+1 
as expected. 
Remark VII.3.10. Theorem VIL3.S is due, in principle, to Jurkiewicz [79] in the 
projective case and to Danilov [38] in the general case. However, the proof we give 
here relies on a previous work by Ehlers [45], who was smart enough to imagine 
and construct a cellular decomposition, the very same cellular decomposition we 
have here (associated to the Morse function /Lx) without even needing a Morse 
function! 
(Half-)Proof of Theorem VIJ. 3. B. Recall that we have a natural ring homomor-
phism 
H*(BT; Z) ~ Z[UI,"" UN] ---) H*(X E; Z) 
which maps Ui to the class corresponding to the cone (Xi. 
Of course, the ideal J is contained in the kernel and the ideal J as well, 
since (XI rf. ~ means exactly that the facets corresponding to the i/s in I do not 
intersect. Hence we have a surjective ring homomorphism 
Z[UI,"" UN]/(J + J) ---) H*(X E; Z). 
To prove the theorem, the only thing which is left to do is to check that 
Z[UI,"" UN]/J + J is a free Abelian group of the same rank as H*(X E; Z), 
namely of rank #~(n). This is a pure algebra question, which is solved in [38]. 
0 
Remark VIL3.11. The statement of Theorem VII.3.S can be given an equivari-
ant cohomology interpretation. According to Remark VL3.I7, H'QXE is the free 
H*BQ-module generated by H*XE. It is not hard to check that ET xQ XE and 
ET x T UE have the same homotopy type, so that H'Q (X E, Z) is an H* (BT)-
module. Thus we have ring homomorphisms 
H*(BT)

CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
Remark VIL3.12. 
The class UI + ... + UN is the first Chern class of the toric 
manifold X E (this is proved in Exercise VII.14), which is thus the dual class to 
the divisor represented by the sum of all the facets of the polyhedron. 
VilA. Complex toric surfaces 
In this section, we describe all the compact complex toric surfaces. A reason to do 
so is that we shall need the result in § VIII.2.c. The description is very simple: 
Theorem VIL4.1 (Oda [113]). Any compact complex toric surface is obtained from 
p2 (C) or from a Hirzebruch surface by a finite sequence of blowing ups. 
The fans. In dimension 2, a fan is well-defined once we know its I-skeleton, and 
thus is given by a family of N primitive vectors (Xl, ... , XN) of Z2 (indices are 
considered as if in Z/N) such that all the (Xi-I,Xi) are Z-bases with the same 
orientation. The cones of dimension 2 are then the (Xi-l,i. Writing the direct basis 
(Xi+I,Xi) in terms of the direct basis (Xi , Xi-d, notice that 
for some integer mi. To give a fan is thus equivalent to giving the integers 
(ml,"" mN)' Every cone of dimension 1 defines a PI(C) in our toric surface. 
The integer mi is the Euler class of the normal bundle to the pI (C) corresponding 
to the cone generated by Xi.

VIl.4. COMPLEX TORIC SURFACES 
Fans with N = 3. We have three vectors xo, Xl and X2. Writing 
we get 
Xo = -Xl + m2X2 
= -Xl + m2( -Xo + mlxl) 
= (mlm2 - I)XI -
m2XO· 
263 
Thus m2 = -1 and ml = -1 as well. There is only one fan with three cones in its 
I-skeleton, this is the fan shown in Figure 2 page 227, and the toric surface is the 
projective plane. 
Fans with N = 4. As above, the four vectors Xo, Xl, X2 and X3 must satisfy 
X3 = -Xl + m2X2 
= -Xl + m2( -Xo + mlxl) 
= -m2XO + (mlm2 - I)XI 
and the determinant of X3 and Xo (in this order) is equal to 1, that is, 
so that ml or m2 is zero. The I-skeleton of our fan is 
and the toric surface is a Hirzebruch surface. 
The general case. To prove Theorem VII.4.1, it is thus sufficient to prove the 
next lemma. 
Lemma VIL4.2. For N ~ 5, at least one of the mi 's is equal to 1. 
Proof We first prove that there are, in EI, two opposite vectors. This is based on 
the following sublemma. 
Sublemma VIL4.3. Assume (u, u') and (v, v') are two direct bases of Z2. Then, if v 
is in the interior of the cone generated by u and u' and v' in the cone generated 
by u' and -u, then v' = u' or v' = -u. 
This sublemma forbids situations shown in Figure 22 (the situation depicted 
on the right is the sublemma applied to the bases (u', -u) and (v, v')).

for some integers a, a' ;;:: 1, band b' ;;:: O. The determinant of (v, v') is ab' + ba' = 1, 
so that b or b' must be zero.

Let us proceed with the proof of the lemma. Assume that there are no indices 
i and j such that Xi + Xj = O. We can number the vectors xi's so that, starting 
from Xl, more than half of them appear before -Xl (and -Xl -=I- Xi for all i). Let 
Xj be the last vector before -Xl. We have j > 2 and 
Xj+! -=I- -Xl and -
X2· 
Applying the sublemma to the bases (u, u') = (X2, -Xl) and (Xj, xj+d, we deduce 
that Xj+l cannot lie between -Xl and -X2. By convexity, it must be strictly 
between -X2 and -Xj' This is shown in the right part of Figure 23. The left part

of the same figure shows what happens between X2 and -Xl, where we find not 
only the vectors X2, ... ,Xj but also -Xj+l, ... , -XN and -Xl (these are the dotted 
vectors), N distinct vectors. Now, there is certainly a plain vector between two 
dotted ones, a contradiction with our sublemma. 
Hence, there must be two opposite vectors among the generators of the 1-
skeleton of the fan. Renumber the vectors so that Xi = -Xo (for i ~ 3). Now 
express all the vectors xl's in the basis (xo, xd: 
and define 
Ci = bi + b~. 
We have Ci = 1 since bi = 1 and b~ = O. Moreover, since (Xl, X2) is a direct basis, 
we must have b2 = 1, and we can assume that b; ~ 2: if this is 0, then X2 = -Xo 
which is not, and if this is 1, X2 = -Xo + Xl and this is what we wanted to find. 
Hence we can assume that C2 ~ 3. As we also have Ci = 1, there is an index j < i 
such that 
{ Cj-l ~ Cj 
Cj+l < Cj. 
The claim is now that, for this j, mj = 1. Indeed, we have 
which implies both that 
{ -bjbj+1 + bj+lbj = 1 
bjbj_l - bj-Ibj = 1, 
bj(bj_l + bj+l) - bj(bj _ l + bj+d = 0 
and that bj and bj are relatively prime. Hence there exists an integer A such that 
{ bj_l + bj+l = Abj 
bj- l + bj+l = Abj . 
Now, let us use the property of Cj defining the index j: 
2cj > Cj-l + Cj+1 = bj_l + bj - 1 + bj+1 + bj+1 = A(bj + bj) = ACj. 
Hence A = 1, 
and mj = 1.

CHAPTER VII. TORIC MANIFOLDS 
Of course, one can also describe the fan of a toric surface by a weighted 
graph. This is done in [113] and [30] and this was repeated in [14]. The ver-
tices of the graph correspond to the 2-dimensional cones of the fan, the edges 
to the l-dimensional cones and there is a weight on each vertex, the correspond-
ing mi. For instance, Figure 24 shows the graphs corresponding, respectively to 
p2(c), pI (C) X PI(C), P2(C) and, more generally, to the Hirzebruch surface Wk.

normal bundle to a pl(C) corresponding to the cone generated by Xi, which is a 
weight on the graph, is just a slope in the polygon: two consecutive edges of our 
primitive polygon are generated by a basis of Z2, write the generator of the next 
edge in this basis, you get a relative slope, which is just mi.

CHAPTER VIII 
HAMILTONIAN CIRCLE ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS 
OF DIMENSION 4 
In this chapter, we will investigate symplectic 4-manifolds endowed with Hamil-
tonian circle actions. Together with what was done in the previous chapters, this 
will give us a rather complete description of all the compact symplectic manifolds 
endowed with a Hamiltonian group action. 
To investigate Hamiltonian group actions on 4-manifolds, we need only to 
focus on the cases of the groups 8 1, T2, SO(3) and SU(2). There are of course 
symplectic and even Hamiltonian actions of bigger groups on 4-manifolds. For 
instance, in the same way as SO(3) acts on the sphere 82 (or SU(2) on P1(C)), 
SO(4) acts on 82 x 82 (see Exercise 1.20). However, if the group acting is semi-
simple, we know that the action will be Hamiltonian and we will be very happy if 
the momentum mapping is submersive somewhere. But we must then have, for a 
maximal torus T of our group G, 
dim G + dim T ::::; 4, 
so that we are left with the groups 80(3) and 8U(2). For tori, the same argument 
leaves us the groups 8 1 and T2. 
We have already mentioned the classification theorem ofIglesias [70] in § IV.5. 
This theorem gives a complete symplectic classification of manifolds of dimension 4 
endowed with an SO(3)-action (this result was quoted here in Exercise IV.1S). 
The case of SU(2)-actions, which is completely analogous (although simpler) was 
explained in § IV.5. A few years after Iglesias' theorem came the general result of 
Delzant [39] (here Theorems IV.4.20 and VII.2.1) on Tn-actions on 2n-dimensional 
manifolds, including the case of 4-manifolds endowed with Hamiltonian T2-actions. 
The case of 8 1-actions, to which this chapter is devoted, is somewhat 
different, as the inequality above is strict. On the topological side, all the 
8 1-actions on 4-manifolds were classified by Fintushel [48] a long time ago(l). 
Of course the symplectic (and even more: Hamiltonian) character of the actions 
(l)There are of course a lot of 4-manifolds with 8 1-action which do not admit an invariant 
symplectic form; to be convinced of this, the reader needs only to look at the "list" of 8 1_ 
manifolds of dimension 4 given by Fintushel [48] and Exercises VIII.12 and VIII.13. 

272 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
under consideration here changes the landscape, mainly because, as we have 
already said, one can use Morse theory to study the fixed points. Free (principal) 
actions were investigated in detail by Bouyakoub [26]. It is reasonable to think 
that fixed point free actions may be handled in grosso modo the same pattern. 
Of course these actions do not have the ghost of a chance to be Hamiltonian 
(all the manifolds we will consider are compact). A very beautiful application 
of the fiber connectedness theorem (Corollary IV.3.2) and of other tricks was 
given by McDuff [103]: in dimension 4, an Sl-action is Hamiltonian if and only 
if it has fixed points. These methods allowed the author to give a list of those 
4-manifolds which may be given a symplectic form invariant by an Sl-action 
with at least one fixed point [13]; a somewhat longer and less geometrical proof 
of these results independently appeared in [1]. Since then, Karshon [83] gave a 
symplectic classification theorem. 
We will present these results in this chapter. 
VIII.1. Symplectic Sl-actions, generalities 
The first question is whether a given symplectic Sl-action is, or is not, Hamiltonian. 
VIII.1.a. Characterization of those circle actions that are Hamiltonian. 
In the paper [51] which we already met in Chapter IV, Frankel also showed, 
using Hodge theory, that, on a Kahler manifold{2}, a circle action preserving the 
Kahler form is Hamiltonian if and only if it has a fixed point. The same is true for 
symplectic actions on 4-manifolds, according to a beautiful theorem of McDuff. 
Theorem VIIL1.1 (McDuff [103]). 
Let (W, w) be a compact symplectic manifold 
of dimension 4, endowed with an Sl-action which preserves the symplectic form. 
Then, 
either the action has no fixed points and W is the total space of a bundle 
over Sl, 
or it has at least one fixed point, and then it is Hamiltonian. 
Remark VIIL1.2. The fact that, if there are no fixed points, the manifold should 
be fibered over the circle is part~at least when the action is free---of a theorem 
of Bouyakoub [26]. 
Proof Let us first list the steps in the proof. We will show that: 
(1) It suffices to investigate the case where the cohomology class of the form 
[w] is integral. 
(2)see the definition in § II.2.h. 

VIlLI. SYMPLECTIC Sl-ACTIONS, GENERALITIES 
273 
(2) In this case, there exists a map h, taking values in Sl, which generalizes the 
momentum mapping and has all the properties of a periodic Hamiltonian 
(from the Morse theoretical viewpoint). 
(3) Assuming the action is not Hamiltonian, one deduces, by an argument sim-
ilar to Theorem IV.3.I, that h has no local extrema. 
(4) By a nice argument (a la Duistermaat-Heckman with singularities, as 
in § VI.2.c) using Euler classes of Seifert manifolds (§ I.3.d), one shows that 
there is no critical point at all. 
First step. The set of all invariant symplectic forms 'rJ such that the I-form ix'rJ 
is exact is a closed subset in the set of all invariant symplectic forms. On the 
other hand, as close to w as one wants, there is an invariant symplectic form the 
cohomology class of which is rational. Hence we get the existence of an invariant 
rational symplectic form w', such that, if ixw is not exact, then ixw' is not either. 
As w' is rational, we just have to multiply it by a large enough integer N to give 
it an integral cohomology class. Of course, it stays symplectic, and ix(Nw') is as 
exact as ixw' is. Hence there exists a Hamiltonian for w if and only if there exists 
one for Nw'. Rename Nw' as w. 
D 
Second step. As the cohomology class of w is integral, that of the closed I-form 
i Xw is integral as well: if C is any I-cycle, then r.p( C), got by pushing C with the 
Sl-action, is a 2-cycle, and we have 
r ixw = 1 wE Z 
Jc 
<p(c) 
(for the agnostics, this is proved in Exercise VIII.I). For any Xo (fixed) in W, the 
values of 
h(x) = l
x ixw 
Xo 
are thus well-defined modulo Z, and this defines a map h : W ---+ R/Z = Sl which 
satisfies 
h*dt = ixw. 
The map h has the very same properties as a periodic Hamiltonian: restricted 
to any W -h-1(to), this is a periodic Hamiltonian. In particular, Frankel's theorem 
(Theorem IV.2.3) applies in this (slightly more general) situation. 
D 
Third step. Suppose that the action is not Hamiltonian. Then h is surjective. From 
Frankel's theorem, one derives, as in the proof of Theorem IV.3.I, that the number 
of connected components of the fibers of h is constant: it may only change by 
critical submanifolds of index 1 or n - 1. .. which do not appear here, because all 
have even indices. If h is surjective, there is no local extremum. 
D 

274 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
Fourth step. Let us now use the fact that our manifold has dimension 4. We enu-
merate the possibilities for the critical submanifolds, their dimensions and indices. 
The critical submanifolds are symplectic, hence even dimensional, so that they are 
either surfaces or isolated points. The index of any critical surface, being even, 
may only be 0 or 2, so the critical surfaces are extrema, but we have just proved 
that there were no extrema. We are left with isolated critical points, the indices of 
which cannot be 0 or 4 ... in short: the map h has, at most, isolated critical points 
of index 2. 
Near such a point, the action may be linearized as usual: 
where U E S\ (x, y) E C 2 , and p and q are nonnegative integers which we shall 
assume to be relatively prime (reducing to the case of an effective action). 
Consider two regular values a and b of h between which there is only one 
critical value c. The fibers Va and Vb are 3-dimensional submanifolds of W, each 
endowed with an action of Sl without fixed points, since the vector field X does 
not vanish on the regular levels. Hence, Va and Vb are Seifert manifolds, exactly 
as in the case of a genuine Hamiltonian. 
The trick to end the proof is the following: one shows that the Euler class of 
Vb is strictly larger than that of Va, hence, if some critical points actually appear, 
we get a nondecreasing function. .. defined on the circle, which is absurd: after a 
while, one has to come back to Va. 
D 
To end the proof of Theorem VIII.l.l, we just have to prove the next lemma, 
which could be seen as an orbifold Euler class version of what was done in § VI.2.c 
(see more precisely Example VI.2.10). This can be considered as a wall crossing 
formula. 
Lemma VIILl.3. Let z be an isolated critical point of a periodic Hamiltonian h on 
a symplectic manifold of dimension 4. Let a and b be regular values so that h(z) 
is the only critical value between a and b and let Va, Vb be the corresponding level. 
If the Sl-action, linearized at z, has the form 
U· (x, y) = (uPx, u-qy), 
then 
Proof We study the surgery which allows us to go from Va to Vb. Notice first that 
there exists on our manifold an invariant metric and an invariant calibrated almost 
complex structure so that, in a neighborhood of z, the Sl-action is, indeed, that 
given by the linearization. 

VIlLI. SYMPLECTIC S'-ACTIONS, GENERALITIES 
275 
Consider then a neighborhood of z of the form D; x D~ C C 2 (product of 
two discs). Our level Va is 
Va n (D; x D~) '" D; X S~. 
It has an exceptional fiber of type Zlq fiber for x = 0 (we shall consider this fiber 
as exceptional even if q = 1). Similarly for Vb: 
Vb n (D; X D~) '" S~ X D~ 
where now the exceptional (at least if p ? 2) fiber of type Zip is given by y = o. 
Hence, the surgery when crossing the critical value h(z) replaces an exceptional 
orbit of type Zlq by an exceptional orbit of type Zip. Let now u and v be the 
smallest positive integers such that 
pv-qu=I. 
Then by definition, (see § L3.c), the Seifert invariants of the orbit x = 0 in Va are 
the numbers (q, v), those of the orbit y = 0 in Vb are (p, u). The other possibly 
exceptional orbits are the same in Vb and Va, and, calculating as in Exercise 1.13: 
o 
And this is the end of the proof of Theorem VIILI.I. 
o 
VIII.1.b. Symplectic reduction of the regular levels. Let now H be a 
periodic Hamiltonian on a manifold of dimension 4. We know that the regular 
levels of H are Seifert manifolds Va and that enough is kept over from the smooth 
structure of Va after forming the quotient to enable us to say that the quotient Ba 
is a symplectic orbifold (see § III.2.f). 
The previous section gave us a hint of what was happening to Va when going 
through a critical value of H. We shall now concentrate on the adventures of 
Ba during the same operation. We still use an invariant metric and an invariant 
calibrated almost complex structure. 
What happens near an extremum reached on a surface B. Call L the 
normal bundle of Bin W, that we consider as a complex line bundle over B. Near 
each point z of B, both the action and the symplectic form are conjugate to the 
linear ones 
T zW=T z BE8Lz 
u· (x, y) = (x, umy) 
where m equals ±1 because of the effectiveness of the action (the sign depending on 
the kind of extremum we are dealing with). The regular levels Va (for a close to the 
critical value) are the circle bundles of L, the action is principal, and the quotient 

276 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
can be identified with B. Hence, all the reduced levels close to the extremum are 
the same surface as the extremum itself. This is shown, schematically, in Figure 1.

Figure 1 
Figure 2 
What happens near an extremum reached at an isolated point. With 
the very same method, we find ourselves in C2, with the action 
where m and n have the same sign and are relatively prime. The Hamiltonian may 
be written 
122 
H= 2(mlxl +nlyl ). 
The levels close to the critical one are ellipsoids (topologically, spheres S3). If m 
or n ? 2, there are one or two exceptional orbits. Considering 
Va 
--------) P 1 ( C) 
(X,y) f-----7 [xn ,ym], 
one sees that the reduced surface of these regular levels is a sphere S2. Hence, all 
the reduced levels close to an extremum reached at an isolated point are 2-spheres. 
This is shown in Figure 2. 
What happens when going through a critical value. If we are speaking 
of going through it, the critical level must correspond to some critical point of 
index 2. Another very beautiful remark due to McDuff is that the topology of the 
quotient surface does not change: 
Lemma VIILI.4 (McDuff [103]). Let a and b be two regular values of H . There 
exists a smooth map 
such that: 
-
The restriction 7rIVb : Vb -t Bb is the quotient map. 

VIII.l. SYMPLECTIC S'-ACTIONS, GENERALITIES 
277 
-
For any regular value t of H, there exists a homeomorphism <Pt making the 
diagram 
commute. 
Proof The lemma is obviously true when there is no critical value between a and b, 
because we merely need to push using the gradient flow of H to get a map 
7r: H-1([a,b]) ~ 
Vb ~ 
Bb 
with the desired properties. 
Then, of course, it is enough to prove the lemma in the case where there is 
only one critical value between a and b. For this, we shall try to show, as above, 
that the topology of Va does not change (!) and to understand where we are wrong. 
Let us thus try to prove that it is possible to retract H- 1 ([a, b]) on Vb by 
pushing along the gradient flow. If we push by the gradient up to the level b, any 
m 
~--->----1 rp( m) 
Figure 3 
point of H-1([a, b]) has an image <p(m) which is well-defined in Vb ... except those 
which fell into the hole, more precisely those of the stable manifold of a critical 
point at the level under consideration. 
Consider as usual a neighborhood of the critical point, identified with a neigh-
borhood of 0 in C 2 . If the action is written (uPx,u-qy), the points of the y-axis 
are those which are forced to stay on the critical level. Associate with them the 
"points of the x-axis which are on Vb". Of course, this does not define a map into 
the level Vb ... but notice that all these points lie in the same Sl-orbit in Vb, so 

218 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
that we have a perfectly well-defined map into the quotient Bb, which has the 
required properties. 
D 
Remark VIIL1.5. We have just rephrased what we have already understood in 
§ VI.2.c, in the simple case of a manifold of dimension 4 (except that we have not 
assumed the action to be semi-free). Notice that the topology of the reduced levels 
does not change here. .. because we know it should change by a blowing up, but 
this is trivial in dimension 2. 
VIII.1.c. First applications. If the maximum of H is reached on a surface 
B max , nothing prevents us, in the previous proof, from following the gradient until 
the end. If both the minimum and the maximum of H are reached on a surface, 
we get in the very same way a smooth map 
7r : W -----+ Bmax 
and homeomorphisms 
CPt : B t -----+ Bmax 
(as long as t is not the image of a critical point of index 2) making the diagram 
11/ 
>W 
1 
17r 
Bt~Bmax 
commute. In particular, B min and Bmax are two copies of the same surface. 
If one of the extrema is reached at an isolated fixed point, then the other 
one is reached either on a sphere, or at an isolated critical point. Let us formulate 
these remarks as a proposition. 
Proposition VIIL1.6. Let H be a periodic Hamiltonian on a compact symplectic 
manifold of dimension 4. If the maximum and minimum of H are reached on 
surfaces, the two surfaces are diffeomorphic to each other. If one of the extrema 
is reached at an isolated point, the other one is reached, either at an isolated point 
or on a sphere. 
D 
Assume now that the Sl-action is semi-free (that is, without any exceptional 
orbit) and that both the maximum and the minimum are reached at an isolated 
point. Near the minimum, the action can be written as 
u· (x,y) = (ux,uy) 
(because it is semi-free). In particular, the symplectic reduction of a given nearby 
level is just the Hopf map 

VIII.2. PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS ON 4-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS 
279 
and so has Euler class -1 (see Example L3.3). There must be also a critical point 
of index 2, otherwise, with a Morse function with only two critical points, W would 
be a sphere(3) 8 4 , which would prevent it from being symplectic. Still because of 
the semi-freedom of the action, at the first critical point of index 2, the action 
must linearize as 
u· (x,y) = (ux,uy). 
According to Lemma VIIL1.3 (or to its more elaborate version, in this semi-free 
case, Theorem VI.2.9), the Euler class is zero. But now, there must be still another 
critical point, as otherwise we would have, near the maximum, an action of 8 1 on 
the sphere 83 with Euler class O. Hence we have proved: 
Proposition VIlLI. 7. Let W be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4 en-
dowed with a semi-free Hamiltonian circle action. The action has at least four fixed 
points. If moreover, the fixed points are isolated, there are exactly four of them. 0 
Notice that the last assertion had already been proved in § VL3.d (see Figure 8 
in Chapter VI). 
VIII.2. Periodic Hamiltonians on 4-dimensional manifolds 
VIII.2.a. What happens when there are only two critical values? When 
there are only two critical values, the minimum and the maximum, they can be 
reached 
- either on two copies of the same surface B, 
- or at an isolated point and on a sphere 8 2 • 
Notice that it is impossible that both are reached at an isolated point, since the 
4-sphere 8 4 is still not symplectic. 
Recall that our symplectic manifold is endowed with an invariant metric and 
a calibrated almost complex structure. 
Consider first the case where one of the critical values is reached at an isolated 
point and the other on a sphere. Then all the regular levels are 83's. The action 
near the isolated critical point can be written 
u· (x, y) = (umx, uny). 
On the other side, the levels are principal bundles over 8 2 , thus we must have 
m = n = ±1, and the principal bundles over 8 2 are the Hopf bundle. 
According to the ad hoc version of Darboux's Theorem (equivariant form of 
Corollary ILl.12, see Remark ILl.13), we know that a tubular neighborhood of 
(3) See, for instance [108] for this classical result due to Reeb. 

280 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
this sphere is equivariantly and symplectically isomorphic to a neighborhood of 
pl(C) C p2(C) 
embedded as, say, the line x = 0, with the symplectic form which gives it the same 
volume as our sphere has, say, W a , and the Sl-action 
u· [x, y, z] = [x, uy, uz]. 
At the other end, a neighborhood of the point at which the minimum is 
reached is isomorphic with a neighborhood of the other fixed point [1,0,0] of this 
Sl-action on Pl(C). Following the gradient (minus the gradient would be more 
accurate here) gives an equivariant diffeomorphism preserving the Hamiltonians, 
from our manifold to p2 (C). Our manifold W is thus p2 (C) and the action that 
of Sl by u· (x, y) = [x, uy, uz] . This is shown in Figure 4. The same proof, in any 
dimension, would apply to give a result due to Delzant (see Exercise VIII.2): 
Proposition VIII.2.1 (Delzant [39]). A compact connected symplectic manifold en-
dowed with a periodic Hamiltonian with only two critical values, one of which is 
reached at an isolated point, is a complex projective space. 
0 
Figure 4 
Remark VIII.2.2. It is true, but a little harder to prove, that there is indeed an 
isomorphism from W to P2(C) (resp. pn(C)), in the sense that the symplectic 
structures also are the same. See [39]. 
The other possibility is that the two critical values are reached on two copies 
of the same surface B. Each regular level is the circle bundle of the normal bundle L 
of Bmin in W. The manifold W is thus a compactification of the vector bundle L, 
obtained by adding to it the critical surface Bmax. As above, let us construct a 
model space, namely a symplectic manifold with a Hamiltonian Sl-action and the 
same structure of fixed points. 
Roughly speaking, if we follow the gradient, we will add a point to each fiber 
of L. 

V1I1.2. PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS ON 4-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS 
281 
In order to add a point at infinity to a complex line E, the easiest thing we 
can do is to projectivize the plane E E& C. Here we do this fiberwise, that is, we 
consider the projectivized bundle 
P (L E& 1) = {( z, £) I z E B, £ c L z E& C} 
where 1 denotes the trivial complex line bundle over B, and, for any z E B , Lz is 
the fiber of L at z. The map 
(z, £) t----t z 
defines a projection onto B, the fiber of which is the projective line pl(C). More-
over, there are two inclusions (sections of the bundle) of Bin P(L E& 1): 
- the "zero section" z i-' (z, 0 E& C), 
- and the "section at infinity" z i-' (z, Lz E& 0). 
Example VIII.2.3 (Hirzebruch surfaces). In the case where the basis surface B is 
a sphere, B = pl(C), the manifold P(O(k) E& 1) is a Hirzebruch surface (these 
4-manifolds are actually complex surfaces). We have already met these examples 
in Exercise IV.4, where they appeared endowed with T2-actions, and in §IV.5.a, 
where they were endowed with SU(2)-actions. Notice that the image of the mo-
mentum mapping, a trapezium as shown in Figure 11 in Chapter IV, which we 
reproduce in Figure 6, rotated by a right angle, resembles very much the situation 
in Figure 5 here. This is not by pure chance (of course ... ), the projection onto 
B m in 
Figure 5 
Figure 6 
the horizontal in Figure 6 is indeed the Hamiltonian for the action of a sub circle 
of T2 that has a unique maximum and a unique minimum, both reached along a 
copy of pl(C). 
Let us come back to the general case and write (a, b) when a is a vector 
in Lz and b a complex number, so that (a, b) E Lz E& C. Then it is natural to 

282 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
write [a, b]-using the same notation as for honest homogeneous coordinates-for 
the complex line generated by (a, b), an element of P(Lz EB 1). The zero section 
corresponds to a = 0 and the section at infinity to b = O. 
There is also a natural SI-action on P(L EB 1), that can be written 
u· (z, [a, b]) = (z, [ua, b]) 
(in our "homogeneous" coordinates). Both the zero section and the section at 
infinity are submanifolds consisting of fixed points, so that the situation is close to 
the one we have on the symplectic manifold we are trying to model. However, we 
must still construct a symplectic form on the manifold we have just constructed. 
There are a lot of different possible ways to do so. We showed one in § IV.5.a 
when the basis B is a sphere (case of Hirzebruch surfaces). The one I give here is 
reminiscent of the construction of the equivariant symplectic form we have met in 
Proposition VI.2.1 and was suggested to me by Iglesias. 
Let us endow L with a Hermitian metric, so that we can consider its unit 
circle bundle 
1r: S(L) ------t B, 
a principal SI-bundle, the circle acting by rotations, or complex multiplication, in 
the fibers. The construction is based on the following remark. 
Lemma VIIL2.4. 
Let S(L) -+ B be the unit circle bundle (associated with any 
Hermitian metric) of the complex line bundle L. The mapping 
<p: S(L) x P1(C) ------t P(L EB 1) 
((z, v), [x, y]) 1----------+ (z, [xv, y]) 
is invariant by the Sl-action 
u· ((z,v), [x,y]) = ((z,uv),[x,uy]) 
and induces a diffeomorphism 
Proof. Obviously, 
'P: S(L) XSl pI(C) ------t P(L EB 1). 
<p(u· ((z, v), [x, y]) = <p((z, uv), [x, uy]) 
= (z, [xv, uy]) 
= (z, [xv, y]) 
so that <p descends to a map 'P which is differentiable and one-to-one. 
0 
Let us proceed to the construction of the symplectic form. To begin with, we 
construct a closed 2-form on S(L) x pI (C). We first consider the principal bundle 
1r: S(L) ------t B.

Notice that, if it is trivial, this means that Land P(L EEl 1) are trivial bundles, 
P(L EEl 1) 9! B X pl(C) 
so that it is easy to construct a symplectic form on P(L EEl 1), the product of a 
symplectic form on B and of one on P l (C). 
Otherwise, let e E Z be its Euler class. Fix a volume form 7] on the oriented 
surface B. There is a unique real number A such that 
e = A !s7]. 
Notice that A is zero exactly when the bundles Land S(L) are trivializable, so 
that we are assuming that A # o. 
We have seen in Chapter VI (more precisely in Exercise V1.5) that there 
exists an invariant I-form 0: on S(L) such that 
- if X is the fundamental vector field of the SI-action, ixo: == 1,

Let us consider now pI (C) with the SI-action u . [x, y] = [x, uy] and the usual 
symplectic form woo Let us choose a momentum mapping (a Hamiltonian) H for 
this action and put: 
w = d(Ho:) + woo 
This is a closed 2-form on S(L) x P l (C). Let us investigate its kernel. Consider a 
point ((z,v), [x,y]) E S(L) x pl(C), that we denote ((,w) for simplicity, and two 
tangent vectors 
(Z,P), (Z',P') E T(S(L) x T ropl(C). 
Then (Z, P) is in the kernel of w if and only if 
V (Z', P'), 
(d(Ho:) + wo)((Z, P), (Z', P')) = O. 
But we have 
(d(Ho:) + wo)((Z, P), (Z', P')) = dH(P)o:(Z') - dH(P')o:(Z) 
Hence (Z, P) is in Kerw if and only if 
+ H(w)do:(Z, Z') + wo(P, P') 
= (-o:(Z)dH + ipwo)(P') 
+ (dH(P)o: + H(w)izdo:)(Z'). 
{ -O:(Z)dH + ipwo = 0 
dH(P)o: + H(w)izdo: = O. 
Call X the fundamental vector field of the SI-action (on anything). The first 
equation gives 

284 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
which is equivalent to P 
dH(X) = 0, 
o(Z)X. As for the second equation, it gives, as 
H(ro)izdo = O. 
If we were careful enough to have chosen a function H which does not vanish on 
pl(C) (this is of course possible by adding a constant to it), the second equation 
just gives 
izdo = O. 
From the definition of 0 (starting from a volume form, in particular a nondegen-
erate form TJ), we know that the kernel of do is generated by the vector field X 
hence Z = r X and P = o( Z)X = r X for some real number r. 
The vector field (X, X) is the fundamental vector field of the diagonal SI_ 
action on S(L) x Pl(C), so that we are led to consider this action. Using our 
convention, (X,X) should be called X. We have 
ixw = 0 and £xw = O. 
This is proved exactly !IS the (formally) identical assertion in Proposition VI.2.1. 
One deduces that w descends to the quotient as a symplectic form w on 
S(L) XSl pI (C), and thus, according to Lemma VIII.2.4, on peL EB 1). Moreover, 
the symplectic form w so defined is invariant by the SI-action we are interested in, 
namely 
u· (z, [a, bJ) = (z, [ua, b}). 
Indeed, this action comes from 
u· ((z,v), [x,yj) = (z,uv, [x,yj) on S(L) x pl(C) 
(rotations in the fibers), for which w itself is invariant. 
Now, we have our model space. The consideration of tubular neighborhoods 
of Bmin and Bmax in W leads to the same conclusion as before. To summarize: 
Proposition VIIL2.5. 
Let W be a compact connected symplectic manifold of di-
mension 4 endowed with a periodic Hamiltonian H with only two critical values. 
Then W is equivariantly(4) diffeomorphic, by a diffeomorphism which preserves 
the Hamiltonians,

Remark VIIL2.6. The manifolds P(LEB 1) are called symplectic ruled 4-manifolds, 
by analogy with the ruled surfaces of algebraic geometry, since they are unions of 
(complex projective) lines. Symplectic ruled 4-manifolds are the subject of beau-
tiful work by McDuff [104]. 
VIII.2.h. Critical points of index 2. To begin with, let us prove that there 
are other 4-manifolds endowed with Hamiltonian circle actions than the ones listed 
in Proposition VIII.2.5: it is easy to create examples with many critical points of 
index 2, simply by blowing up fixed points. 
Blowing up fixed points. Let us consider now a Hamiltonian circle action (on 
a manifold of dimension 4) and a fixed point of the action. Using the technique 
explained in § VI.2.c, let us blow up this fixed point. Near this fixed point, the 
action can be written: 
u· (x,y) = (uPx,u-qy) 
for some integers p, q. Notice that, as we are interested in effective actions, we 
must assume that p and q are relatively prime. I do not make any assumptions on 
the signs of p and q (that is, on the index of the critical points) yet-of course, 
for a genuine point of index 2, both will be positive. The Sl-action extends to the 
blown up manifold by 
u· ((x,y), [a,b]) = ((uPx,u-qy),[uPa,u-qb]). 
Consider now the fixed points on the blown up manifold. 
- Outside the exceptional divisor (namely the points such that x = y = 0), 
the situation has not changed. 
- In the case where the blown up fixed point was a point of a fixed sur-
face, assuming that p = 1 and q = 0 (to preserve the effectiveness of the 
Hamiltonian action), the strict transform of the fixed surface (that is, of 
the submanifold x = 0) is a fixed surface as well (this is the submanifold 
consisting of the points ((O,y), [0,1])). We have added a new fixed point, 
the point ((0,0), [1,0]), near which, in local coordinates (x, v) (such that 
v = b / a and y = vx), the action is written 
u· (x,v) = (ux,uv). 
We have thus created a new fixed point, this is a critical point of index 2. 

286 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
- If p > ° 
and q > 0, the blown up fixed point was an isolated critical point of 
index 2 of our Hamiltonian. Let us call this a fixed point of type (p, q). To 
blow it up replaces it with two fixed points: the point ((0,0), [0, 1]), a fixed 
point of type (p+q,q), and the point ((0,0), [1,0]), that has type (p,p+q). 
These two critical points are connected by a sphere, the exceptional divisor 
of our blowing up. Notice that, in the standard metric of C2 we are using 
near the critical point, this is a gradient sphere, namely the closure of the 
stable or unstable manifold of some critical point. 
- If p and q have opposite signs, then the blown up fixed point was an iso-
lated extremum of the Hamiltonian. Changing both the signs of p and q if 
necessary, the action may be written: 
where m and n are positive and relatively prime (with this choice of signs, 
the fixed point is a minimum). The Sl-action on the blown up manifold is: 
so that: 
• When m = n = 1, the whole exceptional divisor consists of fixed 
points; we have replaced an isolated fixed point with a fixed pl(C) . 
• Otherwise, one may assume that m > n > 0. Then the point 
((0,0), [0, 1]) is a minimum, near which the Hamiltonian action is 
written 
u· (v,y) = (um-nv,uny), 
and the point ((0,0), [1,0]) is an isolated critical point of index 2 and 
type (n, m - n). 
Figure 7 shows the two fixed points, connected by the gradient sphere, in the 
blown up manifold. 
Gradient spheres and exceptional divisors. The blowing up of a critical 
point of index 2 gives us the following situation: 
- Before blowing up (left of Figure 7) the gradient manifolds are the y-axis, 
stable manifold of the fixed point, the points of which have stabilizer Zlq, 
and the x-axis, unstable manifold of the fixed point, the points of which 
have stabilizer Zip. 
- After having blown up (right of Figure 7) we have two critical points, the 
u-axis (on the x side) and the v-axis (on the y side) are the two discs which 
form the exceptional divisor. The latter is actually the gradient manifold 
connecting the two fixed points.

Notice that, the invariant metric (and, with it, the almost complex structure) 
having been chosen, we are in a situation similar to the Kahler situation investi-
gated to prove Theorem IV.4.23, That is, the Sl-action extends to a C*-action. 
The gradient vector field is JXH , so that the C*-orbits are either fixed points or 
symplectic surfaces in our manifold W, 
Of course, a nontrivial C*-orbit is a cylinder, more precisely, it is symplec-
tically diffeomorphic with Sl x la, b[, for some interval la, b[ (and symplectic form 
dB 1\ dx), the momentum mapping being 
(u,x) 1-----+ x. 
Moreover, since the nonconstant trajectories of the gradient have limit points 
which are critical points of H, the closures of the C*-orbits must be (at least 
topologically) spheres, These are the gradient spheres. 
Example V//L2.7. The exceptional divisor in the blowing up process described 
above is a gradient sphere. 
Being defined by the gradient of H, in particular by the Riemannian metric we 
have chosen, the gradient spheres depend, a priori, on this metric. Notice however, 
that some of them can be defined in terms of the Sl-action only, so that they do 
not, a posteriori, depend on any choice. These are the spheres with nontrivial 
cyclic stabilizer, as asserted by the next proposition. 
Proposition VI/L2.8. 
Let W be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4 
endowed with a Hamiltonian Sl-action. For any integer k :) 2, the set W Z / k of 

288 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
points with stabilizer Z/k is a manifold, the closure of any connected component 
of which is a symplectic 2-sphere on which S1 acts with two fixed points. 
Moreover, for any Riemannian metric compatible with the Sl-action, all the 
Z/k-spheres are gradient spheres. 
Proof. The fact that WZ / k is a manifold is a special case of Proposition 1.2.2. Let 
us chose any invariant metric, together with a calibrated complex structure J, so 
that the S1-action extends to a C*-action. This C*-action preserves WZ / k , so that 
its connected components are C*-invariant. The C*-orbit of any point of WZ / k 
is thus a connected component of WZ / k . We have seen that the closure of such a 
component is a 2-sphere, on which the Sl-action has two fixed points ... so that 
this closure is also a gradient sphere.

Symplectic blow down. Assume now that ~ is an invariant symplectic sphere 
the Euler class of the normal bundle of which is -1. Assume its symplectic volume 
(area) is a positive number 1f'r2. Then, an equivariant neighborhood of ~ in W is 
isomorphic with an equivariant tubular neighborhood of the exceptional divisor 
in (52. Thus we can remove this tubular neighborhood and replace it by a ball 
of radius r, getting a new symplectic manifold, with an Sl-action. This is the 
equivariant symplectic blow down. 
VIII.2.c. The list of examples. We have now introduced everything we need 
to understand the topology of the manifolds under consideration: they will be 
organized around the gradient spheres. 
In § VIIL2.a, we have constructed examples of compact symplectic manifolds 
endowed with periodic Hamiltonians: all the P(L EB 1) (with two surfaces as the 
set of fixed points), and p 2 (C) with an isolated fixed point and a fixed sphere. 
On p 2 (C), we know that there are plenty of other periodic Hamiltonians, for 
example the Morse function 
H x 
z 
_ ~ mlxl2 +nlyl2 
([ ,y, j) - 21xl2 + lyl2 + Iz12· 
This is a Hamiltonian for the Sl-action 
u· [x, y, z] = [umx, uny, z], 
which is effective as soon as m and n are relatively prime, and which has three 
fixed points when m and n are distinct and nonzero. 
Similarly, when the base space B of the bundle L is a sphere, we may combine 
an Sl-action on B and the action in the fibers to get more complicated actions on 
P(L EB 1). This is the case of the Hirzebruch surfaces, considered here as 
Wk = {([a,b],[x,y,zj) E pl(C) x p2(C) laky = bkx} 

VIII.2. PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS ON 4-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS 
289 
with the induced symplectic form and the Sl-action 
U· ([a, b], [x, y, z]) = ([uma, b][umkx, y, unz]). 
Notice that the actions we have just described are restrictions, to some subgroup 
Sl C T2 of T2-actions on p 2(C) or Wk (see Exercise IV.4). 
Now that we have got all these basic examples, we are able to state the first 
result we want to prove. 
Theorem VIIL2.9. 
Let W be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4, en-
dowed with a Hamiltonian Sl-action. Then W can be obtained by a sequence of 
blow ups from 
-
either a manifold of the form P(Lffi 1), with two fixed surfaces and no other 
fixed point 
or a projective plane or a Hirzebruch surface with the restriction to some 
subgroup Sl of a Hamiltonian T2-action. 
If this statement gives a list of all the 4-manifolds that can be endowed 
with both a symplectic form and a Hamiltonian Sl-action, this is not really a 
classification theorem, as 
- the list might be (and actually is) redundant, 
- there is no uniqueness assertion, especially on the symplectic structure, but 
not even on the momentum mapping. 
It must thus be completed by a uniqueness result (due to Karshon), which I will 
explain later on (this is Theorem VIII.2.14). However, it gives an extensive list 
of all the compact symplectic 4-manifolds that can be endowed with a periodic 
Hamiltonian. 
The proof given here is inspired by my original proof [13, 14] together with 
that of Karshon [83]' and, mainly, by the observation made by McDuff that we 
need only to blow down spheres. 
The proof of Theorem VIII.2.9. We start with two lemmas, that describe the 
relations between the various gradient spheres. 
The submanifolds on which the extrema are reached and the gradient man-
ifolds as well, are (almost complex) surfaces with normal bundles which describe 
their neighborhoods in W. 
Lemma VIIL2.10. 
Assume L -+ S2 is a complex line bundle of Euler class e, 
endowed with an Sl-action such that 
the principal stabilizer of the zero section is Zjk, 
the Sl-action on the zero section has two fixed points at which the linear 
action on the fibers of L has weights m and n.

The line bundle is obtained by gluing S:. x C and S~ x C along their common

cp(v,z) = (w,v-ez).

cp(u· (v, z)) = u· cp(v, z), 
namely 
that is, n = -ke + m.

Let us consider now a chain of gradient spheres. 
Lemma VIIL2.11. 
Let C = E1 U ... U Er be a chain of gradient spheres, such 
that the south pole Pi-1 (minimum of H) of Ei is the north pole (maximum of 
H) of Ei - 1 . Let ki denote the order of the principal stabilizer on Ei . Then ki and 
ki+1 are relatively prime and - ki - 1 ~ ki+l is the Euler class of the normal bundle 
to Ei (in particular, this Euler class is a negative integer).

Pi 
Figure 9 
Proof The first assertion is a consequence of the effectiveness of the action. The 
second is a consequence of Lemma VIII.2.1O. Look at Figure 9: the cyclic group 
Zjki is the principal stabilizer of I:i but -ki - 1 is the weight of the action on the 
fiber at its south pole Pi-l while ki+l is that of the action on the fiber at the north 
pole Pi. Thus, Lemma VII1.2.10 gives, for the Euler class ei, 
o 
Let us now proceed to the proof of Theorem VIII. 2.9 when both the maximum 
and the minimum are reached on a surface. We look at a chain of gradient spheres. 
It is enough to prove that such a chain contains a sphere with normal Euler class 
(or self-intersection) -1. Then we can blow it down and prove the theorem by 
induction on the number of critical points of index 2. 
Denote by kl' ... ,kr the orders of the stabilizers of the spheres in our chain. 
For instance, kl and kr are the weights of the Sl-action on the neighborhood of 
the fixed surfaces, so that, by effectiveness of this action, kl = kr = l. 
If we assume that all the weights ki's are equal to 1, then, according to 
Lemma VIII. 2. 11 , the last sphere has normal Euler class 
-(1 + 0) = -1 
1 
and we are done. Assume thus that all the k/s are not equal to 1. Let ks 
max {kd. We have 
As two consecutive ki's must be relatively prime, we have actually strict inequali-
ties 
so that 

292 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
But we know that this number should be a positive integer, so that it must be 
equal to 1. But then the s-th sphere ~s has normal Euler class -1, according to 
Lemma VIII.2.11. Thus we are done in the case where there are two fixed surfaces. 
Assume now that the minimum of the Hamiltonian is reached at an isolated 
point. As above, we can blow down either the top sphere of a chain of gradient 
spheres or, if some isotropy group is larger than its neighbors, the correspond-
ing sphere. Hence we can assume that all the chains of gradients spheres in our 
manifold consist of spheres with increasing isotropy group orders. 
If there are indeed critical points of index 2 in our manifold, the Sl-action 
near the minimum must have the form 
U' (Zl,Z2) = (UmlZ1,Um2z2) 
for some positive integers m1 and m2 that are not both equal to 1. Assume that 
m2 = 1. This means that, either there is only one gradient sphere (with isotropy 
group Zjm1 starting from the minimum, or that there is another one, but without 
any critical point of index 2 on it. Thus, we have at most two chains of gradient 
spheres in our manifold. 
Proposition VIIL2.12. 
Let W be a compact symplectic manifold of dimension 4 
endowed with an effective Hamiltonian Sl-action such that 
-
an extremum of the Hamiltonian is an isolated fixed point, 
-
for some invariant metric, there are no more than two nontrivial chains of 
gradient spheres. 
Then, the Sl-action extends to an effective Hamiltonian T2-action. 
Assuming the proposition true for the moment, we deduce that our original 
manifold was obtained by a sequence of blowing ups starting from a toric surface. 
According to Theorem VII.4.1, the latter is itself obtained from p2(C) or from a 
Hirzebruch surface by a sequence of blowing ups. So that the theorem is proved. 0 
Proof of the proposition. From the numerical data along the chains of gradient 
spheres, we construct a fan. Denote as above k1, ... , kr , k~, ... , k~ the orders of 
the isotropy groups along the two chains of gradient spheres. Recall that, having 
maybe blown down a few spheres, we can assume that the two sequences are strictly 
increasing, two consecutive weights are relatively prime and so are k1 and k~, and 
kr, k~ as well. 
With this data, we construct a fan. We start at the minimum, that we assume 
to be reached at an isolated point. Near this point, the Sl-action reads 

VIII.2. PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS ON 4-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS 
293 
Bezout gives us two integers bl and b~ such that 
We consider the two vectors 
Xl = GJ and x~ = (~~~) , 
which constitute an integral (direct) basis of Z2 by construction. Notice that there 
is a choice here, as we should expect: there is no reason why there should be only 
one torus action extending our circle action. 
By induction, we construct vectors 
Xi = G:) and xj = (~~j) for 1 ~ i ~ r, 1 ~ i ~ s 
such that (Xi-I, Xi) and (x~, x~_l) are (direct) integral bases of Z2. The claim now 
is that these vectors constitute the I-skeleton of a fan I: and that our manifold is 
equivariantly diffeomorphic with the toric manifold X~, endowed with the action 
of a circle subgroup of its big torus. Notice that all the Xi'S are on the right side 
and all the xj's on the left side of the y-axis, so that we actually have a fan. The 
only problem is what happens between X T and x~. 
X' 1 
Figure 10 
There are two possibilities: 
- either the maximum is reached on a sphere, 
- or it is reached at an isolated point. 
Xr 
Figure 11 
In the first case, we add the vector X T+! = X~+l to our collection of vectors. The 
fan got this way is smooth, since we know that in this case, the stabilizers near 

294 
CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
the maximum are trivial, so that kr = k~ = 1 and 
The second case is a little more intricate. We want to prove that 
I 
I Ikr -k~1

Xr xs+l = br 
b~ = . 
We conclude with the help of an argument due to Karshon [83]. We look at the 
volume function on our manifold, as in § VI.2.b. Near the maximum, we know that 
its slope is __ 
1_. On the other hand, viewed from our chains of gradient spheres, 
krk~ 
this should be also be the difference of the "slopes" of the lines orthogonal to Xr

Now we have a toric manifold XI;, which is diffeomorphic with our mani-
fold W, with an Sl-equivariant diffeomorphism, by construction. It is, as usual, 
easy to construct a symplectic form on X I; which looks like the one we have on W. 
From the fan ~, we deduce a polygon, just assigning to each edge the length given 
by the symplectic volume of the corresponding gradient sphere as in § V1.3.d (this 
is shown in Figure 12, note that the upper corner of the polygon is the one used 
above and shown in Figure 11).

VIII.2.d. Karshon's uniqueness result. As we have noticed in Proposi-
tion VIII.2.8, some of the gradient spheres on our 4-manifold are only defined 
by the Sl-action and do not depend on the invariant metric we have chosen: 
these are the spheres with stabilizer Z/k (k ~ 2). This is the basis of Karshon's 
construction. She associates, with any 4-manifold endowed with a periodic 
Hamiltonian, a graph 
- the vertices of which correspond to the critical submanifolds (there are 
two kinds of vertices, those corresponding to isolated fixed points (ordinary 
vertices) and those corresponding to critical surfaces (that I will draw as 
horizontal segments)) 
- the edges of which correspond to the Z/k-spheres. 
The vertices are labelled by the values of the function (and the genus and sym-
plectic area of the surface if they correspond to a non-isolated critical point). The 
edges are labelled by the order k of the stabilizer. Notice that the labels of the 
vertices keep track of the symplectic form, while the labels of the edges are defined 
by the action. Notice also (and this is something rather unpleasant) that there 
is no reason why such a graph should be connected (see Figures 13 and 14). For 
instance, the graphs associated, respectively, to the Sl-actions on p2(C) 
- by u· [x, y, zJ = lux, y, zJ; the bottom vertex corresponding to a sphere 
(x = 0, the minimum) and the top one to an isolated critical point ([1,0,0]'

complex projective lines joining these points are the gradient spheres (and

- by u· (v,w) = (u· v,uk • w) on 8 2 x 8 2 , the dot standing for the rotations 
about the z-axis, there are four isolated critical points and two Z/k gradient 
spheres, 
- by rotations in the fibers of P(L EB 1) --t B (here the Euler class of L is e 
and A denotes the total variation of H). 
There is an obvious notion of isomorphism of such graphs. 
The subtle observation which allows Karshon to prove her uniqueness result 
is that the gradient spheres which are not Z/k-spheres, that is, the occurrence of 
which is not forced by the 8 I-action, are unimportant, since they can be avoided by 
a small perturbation of the (invariant and compatible) metric. She proves indeed 
that a generic invariant compatible metric has only Z / k-spheres as gradient spheres 
relating critical points of index 2. 
Remark VIIL2.13. Notice however that there are two gradient spheres meeting at 
any critical point of index 2. Let us consider the Karshon graph on the right of 
Figure 15 (this corresponds to a periodic Hamiltonian on 8 2 x 8 2, see Figure 23). 
The next graph shows a possible arrangement of gradient spheres descending from 
the two critical points of index 2. A metric giving such a graph is not generic; for 
a generic metric, the gradient spheres would descend to the minimum, as shown 
in the last part of the figure. 
After having defined the graphs, Karshon proves the uniqueness result her 
graphs were designed for: the graph determines the symplectic manifold and the 
action. 
Theorem VIIL2.14 (Uniqueness theorem of Karsh on [83]). Let (W, w) and (W', w') 
be two compact connected symplectic manifolds of dimension 4 endowed with pe-
riodic Hamiltonians H and H'. Assume the corresponding graphs are isomorphic. 
Then there is a symplectic diffeomorphism 'P : W --t W' such that H' 0 'P = H.

As for the symplectic aspects of Delzant's uniqueness theorem (Theo-
rem IV.4.20), I will not give the proof and rather send the readers to the original 
paper [83]. 
Notice that, together with Theorem VIII.2.9, Theorem VIII.2.14 gives the 
nice following corollary. 
Corollary VIIL2.15 ([83]). A ny symplectic 4-manifold endowed with a periodic 
Hamiltonian is Kahler.

This is very nice but leaves us with the following problem: to prove an ex-
istence theorem, since Theorem VIII.2.14 does not tell us which graphs indeed 
appear. There are obviously obstructions coming from the Duistermaat-Heckman 
theorem, which gives restrictions on the areas of the surfaces under consideration. 
There is also the obvious fact that there are only two gradient spheres meeting at 
a point of index 2. Some obstructions are more subtle. Consider for instance the 
graph shown on the left part of Figure 16. I claim that this graph can only exist

if k = 2. This is a consequence of Theorem VIII.2.9, which tells us that such a 
graph would come from a manifold obtained from a P(L EEl 1) by a sequence of 
blowing ups. So we should start from the graph on the right of Figure 14 and blow

up fixed points. Figure 16 shows what happens and proves our assertion(5). Notice 
that this proves more generally that an isolated edge connecting two critical points 
of index 2 can only carry the label 2. This can also be viewed as a consequence 
of Lemma VIII. 2. 11 , which of course imposes a lot of constraints on our graphs, 
since it forces, for any consecutive three gradient spheres, that

VIII.2.e. Graphs associated with actual periodic Hamiltonians. Accord-
ing to Theorem VIII.2.9, the graphs that are actually obtained from Hamiltonian 
circle actions on 4-manifolds are obtained by blowing up the simple examples of 
P(L E91) and p 2(C). We thus need 
- to consider the graphs associated with the simple examples 
- and to understand the effect of a blow up. 
When both the maximum and the minimum are reached at isolated fixed points, 
the graph is divalent and the weights of the vertices can be characterized using 
the same ideas as in the proof of Proposition VIII.2.12 as those from which a toric 
surface can be constructed. I will thus concentrate on the case where at least one 
of the extrema is reached along a surface (and I will assume this is the case for the 
minimum). The graphs will thus have a "basis" that I will label by the genus 9 of 
the surface and the opposite b of the Euler class of its normal bundle (this number 
can be deduced from the data present on Karshon's graph, using Duistermaat-
Heckman, on the other hand, we lose the information on the size of the surface 
with respect to the symplectic form). 
Basic graphs. As announced above, we concentrate on graphs with a bottom 
vertex which is actually an edge, corresponding to a fixed surface. The basic graphs 
correspond to Hamiltonian actions on P(L E9 1) for some complex line bundle L 
over a surface B, hence they are the graphs shown in Figure 17.

Blowing up a vertex. Let us turn now to the question of blowing up. From 
now on, it will be more convenient to use a slightly modified version of the graphs, 
taking Remark VIII.2.13 into account and adding to the graph a (dotted) edge 
labelled 1 relating the lowest vertex (corresponding to a critical point of index 2) of 
each connected component to the minimum, and similarly between the top vertices 
and the maximum. The effect of a blow up is shown in Figure 18. 
, • 
I: 
Figure 18. Blowing up fixed points 
Given a Karshon graph (completed as explained above), we will look at the 
complement r of whatever vertex corresponds to the maximum. The graph r has 
the shape of a star. Notice that it is equivalent to label its edges with new labels 
which are minus the self-intersection number of the sphere it represents: according 
to Lemma VIII.2.11, this replaces ki by 
b _ ki - 1 + ki+1 
, -
ki 
which is an integer (the case of an isolated minimum is different, see Exer-
cise VIII.5). Now we have a star-shaped graph the edges of which are labeled 
with the self-intersection numbers of the corresponding gradient spheres. Let us 
add to the picture minus the self-intersection number of the minimum surface (it 
will be determined from the rest of the graph later). The new labels are shown in 
Figure 19. The main advantage of this new labelling, which is equivalent to the 
k3 
Figure 19 
previous one, is that it is completely transparent with respect to blow ups: the 
labels are (minus) the self-intersection numbers, so that to blow up a fixed point 
produces a sphere of self-intersection number -1 and hence a new edge labelled 1.

CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
Plumbing. These new graphs describe a construction called plumbing. This is a 
classical construction in low dimensional topology- also used in singularity theory, 
see for example [115, 68](6). This is one of the many reasons to present this 
construction here. Some other ones are 
- the relations with the Seifert manifolds investigated in Chapter I, 
- the fact that plumbing describes quite accurately the 4-manifolds considered 
here, 
- the fact that this allows one to determine which graphs are actual graphs 
of symplectic 4-manifolds endowed with periodic Hamiltonians, 
the main reason being the fact that I like plumbings and continued fractions. 
Let me explain now how to plumb two complex line bundles on surfaces. 
Let E1 --t B1 and E2 --t B2 be the disc bundles of two complex line bundles on 
surfaces. Choose two discs D1 and D2 respectively in B1 and B2. We know that 
the bundles E1 and E2 are trivializable, over D1 (resp. D2) as well as over B1 - D1 
(resp. B2 - D2)' Choose trivializations 
Ell Dl ~ D1 X B2 ~ B2 X B2 
E21D2 ~ D2 X B2 ~ B2 X B2 
using which it is possible to glue, inverting factors. The result is an almost com-
Figure 20. Plumbing 
plex 4-manifold with boundary (and corners, that can easily be smoothed), which 
contains the two surfaces B1 and B2, with normal bundles E1 and E2. This is 
what Figure 20 schematically shows. The diffeomorphism type of the plumbed 
manifold is well-defined by that of B1, B2 and by the isomorphism type of the 
vector bundles. 
Then we can iterate the process (and this is indeed something we have already 
done, see Figure 9). Given a graph with integral labels on its edges, we consider the 
line bundles having (minus) the label as Euler class on the corresponding surface 
(if no genus is indicated, the surface is a sphere) and we plumb the two bundles 
together if the corresponding edges have a common edge(7). 
(6) Notice that the usual plumbing graphs are duals to the graphs used here. 
(7)The usual convention in differential topology is to use the dual graph to the one we have here. 

VIII.2. PERIODIC HAMILTONIANS ON 4-DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS 
301 
Consider for instance the graph associated with our periodic Hamiltonian. 
Remove the top vertex. What we have then is a star-shaped graph that we can 
consider as a plumbing graph. The 4-manifold with boundary that we obtain by 
plumbing along this graph is diffeomorphic with the complement of a neighborhood 
of the maximum in our original manifold. 
Figure 21 
Notice that the abstract 4-manifold with boundary obtained by plumbing 
along a star-shaped graph can be endowed with an Sl-action. 
- If the basis B of the disc bundle E is not a sphere, we endow it with the 
trivial Sl-action and make the circle act by rotation in the fibers of E 
(assumed to be Hermitian). 
- Otherwise, namely if B is a sphere, we write it as the union of two hemi-
spheres S2 = st u s~, viewed as discs 
S! = {z E C Ilzl ~ 1} 
and 
S=- = {z E C U 00 Ilzl ~ 1} ~ {z E C Ilzl ~ 1} . 
Then the bundle E ---+ B can be obtained by gluing two copies of the trivial 
bundle: 
by 
'P : Sl X B2 -----t Sl X B2 
(z, u) 
f---+ (z, 'Pz(u)) 
over Sl = S! n S=- for some 'Pz E 80(2) for all z. The isomorphism class 
of the bundle is well-defined by the homotopy class of the mapping

Z f---+ 
'Pz

CHAPTER VIII. HAMILTONIAN ACTIONS ON MANIFOLDS OF DIMENSION 4 
which we may assume to have the form rpz(u) = zku for some integer k. 
The bundle obtained this way is denoted E(k). 
Let SI act on each piece, by 
t· (z, u) = (tm1 z, tn1u) 
on S~ X B2 and by 
t· (z, u) = (tm2 z, tn2u) 
on S=- x B2. Both actions must agree via the gluing map rp, that is: m2 = -ml 
and n2 = -kml + nl. Eventually, 
(1) The bundle E(k) is defined by the gluing map rp : SI X SI ---t SI X S1, the 
matrix of which (on fundamental groups) is: 
rp* = ( =! ~) . 
(2) If the SI-action is given, on the S~ -side, by the integers (ml, nI), it will be 
given, on the S=--side by (m2, n2), with 
( :: ) = ( =~ ~) ( 
:11 ) . 
The boundary aW(r) is thus endowed with a fixed point free SI-action, in 
other words, this is a Seifert manifold. The next theorem allows us to compute the 
Seifert invariants of this manifold. Before stating it, we need to define a (signed) 
version of continued fractions. We write 
1 
[b1 , ... , bsJ = h - -----
1 
b2 -
.,------
b3 -
... 
A good general reference on continued fractions is the book [66J. The fact that 
we have signs here does not make things very different. If we require that all bi's 
are ~ 2, any rational number ~ > 1 can be written [b1, ... , bsJ as one can easily 
q 
show using a slight modification of the usual algorithm of Euclid(S). The reduced 
fractions we get here are nonincreasing, and with standard notation 
[b1, ... , bnJ = ~:, 
we have 
NnDn+1 - Nn+1Dn = 1 
for any n, which can be considered more convenient than the analogous relation 
for continued fractions with "plus" signs.

have a nonzero rational value, then

We have used here the notation for Seifert manifolds introduced in Theo-
rem 1.3.7. 
Remarks VIII.2.17 
(1) The invariants so obtained are not necessarily normalized in the sense that 
f3i is not assumed to be less than ai. 
(2) The determination of 13 in terms of band bi,j, that we do not make explicit 
here can be considered by the readers as an exercise. 
Example VIII.2.IS. If f = (g I b), aw (r) is a disc bundle of the line bundle with 
Euler class -b on the genus 9 surface B. Glue a disc bundle of the line bundle 
with Euler class b to get the manifold P(L EB 1) (with e(L) = ±b). 
The proof of the theorem will use the following lemma (an assertion on the 
manifold aW(f) rather than on an 8 l-action). 
Lemma VIII.2.19. 
If f = (bl , ... , bs ), then the manifold aW(f) is the lens space 
L(p,q) wherep/q= [bl, ... ,bsj. 
Proof We must glue the bundles E( -bl ), ... , E( -bs ). One checks by an easy 
induction on s that this is the same as gluing the two solid tori SH x 8 1 (where 
SH is the first hemisphere in the first sphere Sl) and Ss- x 8 1 by the map 
aSH x 8 1 -----4 ass -
x 8 1 
with matrix 
As = ( ~sl ~) (~ ~) ... (~ ~) ( ~11 ~) .

To use less cumbersome notation, put Ns = p, D s = q (this is the notation in the

We recognize the lens space L(p, q) (see § 1.3.5). 
D 
Proof of the theorem. We apply the lemma in each branch of the graph. We know, 
as the action is trivial at the "head", that we have to glue the lens space L(p, q) 
with the trivial action in the fibers over 81+: the action on 81+ x B2 is 
t· (a, z) = (ta, z). 
At the end of this branch, we know that the 8 1-action is 
t . (a, z) = (tm~ a, tn~ z) 
with 
( :~ ) = As ( ~) = ( ~u ~v) (~) = ( ~u ) = ( -~-l ) . 
The exceptional orbit is the central (a = 0) one, the order of its stabilizer is 
n~ = Ns = p. To get the Seifert invariants (p, 13) it is enough, up to normalization, 
to find some 13 such that m~f3 = +1 mod n~. But m~ = -Ns- 1 = -u, we thus 
have to solve 
-uf3 = 1 mod p. 
As we have pu - qv = 1, 13 = p - q works. 
D 
Eventually, the algorithm to decide whether a given graph is indeed the graph 
of some Hamiltonian action on a 4-manifold is the following: 
- add to the graph the descending gradient spheres as explained above, 
- relabel the edges, 
- compute the continued fractions. 
If the result is the inverse of an integer, we are done.

of which are equal to 2. Recall that the matrix Bs is 
( 8+1 
8 
) 
(18) 
-8 -(8 - 1) 
'" ° 
1 . 
Check that the S1-action on the closed 4-manifold constructed this way(9) has 8 
isolated fixed points and a fixed surface which is a torus T2. 
(9)There exists an analytic complex surface, endowed with a C*-action with these properties. 
The spheres we used to plumb constitute a cycle of rational curves, and the torus T2 is an elliptic 
curve. This surface (parabolic Inoue surface) has remarkable properties, but has no nonconstant 
meromorphic functions (see for example [98] and [114]). For instance, it has no symplectic form 
defining the orientation we consider (a fortiori calibrating the complex structure). In fact the 
intersection pairing is negative definite (the proof of this fact is easy and thus left as an exercise).
