Abstract
Recent research has revealed the diversity and biomass of life across ecosystems, but how
that biomass is distributed across body sizes of all living things remains unclear. We compile
the present-day global body size-biomass spectra for the terrestrial, marine, and subterra-
nean realms. To achieve this compilation, we pair existing and updated biomass estimates
with previously uncatalogued body size ranges across all free-living biological groups.
These data show that many biological groups share similar ranges of body sizes, and no sin-
gle group dominates size ranges where cumulative biomass is highest. We then propagate
biomass and size uncertainties and provide statistical descriptions of body size-biomass
spectra across and within major habitat realms. Power laws show exponentially decreasing
abundance (exponent -0.9±0.02 S.D., R2 = 0.97) and nearly equal biomass (exponent 0.09
±0.01, R2 = 0.56) across log size bins, which resemble previous aquatic size spectra results
but with greater organismal inclusivity and global coverage. In contrast, a bimodal Gaussian
mixture model describes the biomass pattern better (R2 = 0.86) and suggests small (~10−15
g) and large (~107 g) organisms outweigh other sizes by one order magnitude (15 and 65 Gt
versus ~1 Gt per log size). The results suggest that the global body size-biomass relation-
ships is bimodal, but substantial one-to-two orders-of-magnitude uncertainty mean that
additional data will be needed to clarify whether global-scale universal constraints or local
forces shape these patterns.
Introduction
Body size is a widely used metric in biodiversity, ecological, and evolutionary sciences because
it is understood to mechanistically link physical, physiological and demographic processes
[1,2]. Organisms on Earth range from 10−17 (Nanoarchaeum equitans) to 109 g (Sequoiaden-
dron giganteum) in body size when estimated as carbon weight. Body size representations
within various taxa have been a major focus in macroecology and biogeography. Such repre-
sentations are called size spectra, with size-biomass spectra being the cumulative biomass of
selected organisms distributed across body size classes, integrated over all individuals and taxa
(i.e., not averaging over species). These spectra are also known as biomass size spectra, which
are related to size-abundance or normalized size-biomass spectra [3] (see Table 1 for summary
of key terms).

Theories have attempted to predict and explain size-biomass spectra in terms of energy
availability and transfer, species interactions, metabolic scaling, and aquatic trophic structure
[4–9]. Such theories have been applied within limited taxonomic ranges, especially for the rela-
tionships between body size and abundance in terrestrial mammalian herbivores [10], marine
phytoplankton [11], cross-realm producers [12], and marine trophic communities [4,9].
Within groups that share an energy source (not necessarily with trophic links), energetic
equivalence (equal energetic availability to all populations) predicts a power law exponent of
-0.75 for size-abundance or size-normalized biomass spectra (where biomass is divided by the
size class or bin width), or an exponent of 0.25 for size-biomass spectra [10,13] (Table 1). How-
ever, empirical studies show that substantial residuals exist within groups and that the expo-
nent deviates across groups [14]. Across trophic levels, size-ordered predator-prey interactions
(especially in aquatic communities) can lead to a power law exponent of -1 or less for size-
abundance or normalized size-biomass spectra, which is equivalent to an exponent of 0 or less
for size-biomass spectra [8,15–17]. Beyond fundamental science, the power law exponents
have also been considered as indices of productivity among marine ecosystems [18]. Devia-
tions from expected exponents can be used to understand perturbations to ecosystems, such as
inferring changing food web structure and fish biomass due to fishing [3,19–21], or inferring
changes to the real breadth of the energetic base in coral reef systems [22]. Thus, size spectra
are important for understanding biological and anthropogenic constraints to life within bio-
logical communities.
Despite this progress on power laws, important questions remain about whether small,
medium, or large organisms dominate standing biomass of life on Earth at the global scale
[8,21,23]. Different disciplines have proposed different biomass modes with or without refer-
ence to power laws. From a microbiology or marine perspective, microbes appear to dominate
life [9,24]. From the terrestrial perspective, large plants dominate [25]. Each has a legitimate
claim based on analysis of particular ecosystems or sets of taxa, but these approaches also pre-
vent a different and novel synthesis in which traditionally excluded organisms may fit in.
Empirical studies of size-biomass relationships have yet to include both terrestrial producers
and consumers, or both small and large marine producers. The common phrase of bacteria-
to-whale, meant to convey a complete marine size range [2,3,9], actually leaves out macroalgae,
seagrass, hard corals, and mangroves that have maximum sizes near that of blue whales.

Increased inclusivity could reveal deviations from previous theoretical assumptions about size-
structured trophic communities that lead to power law predictions. However, macroecological
power laws themselves first arose from empirical relationships [4,10,26,27], which only later
inspired still-evolving theoretical explanations [7,28]. The fact that some organisms, habitats,
and parts of biological materials are routinely excluded from macroecology suggests these enti-
ties are poorly understood and a larger picture is missing. Revealing global patterns is a key
step towards understanding universal constraints. For example, metabolic and biochemical
theories predict universal constraints that govern how biological rates vary with body size and
temperature across all organisms, which are largely independent of between-organism interac-
tions and habitat variations [28,29]. Inspiring and testing theories on biomass distributions at
biome scales will depend on assessing the current state of living things, but this empirical exer-
cise has so far been prevented by a lack of data synthesis on body size itself.
Our objective here is to compile the first global and taxonomically inclusive size-biomass
spectra of present-day terrestrial, marine, and subterranean realms. Specifically, we compile—
for the first time—data on body size range within major biological groups that include all free-
living organisms. The groups we use are not strictly taxonomically consistent, but they are
functionally meaningful and follow the convention of our main biomass data source [30]. We
then offer statistical descriptions (Table 1) of the global and habitat realm-specific spectra and
their uncertainties. Our statistical tests focused on pattern detection rather than on previous
theoretical hypotheses because these do not directly apply to global size-biomass spectra. Both
the methodology of size spectra construction and statistical analyses serve as guides for how to
integrate a taxonomically inclusive set of data with substantial uncertainties. The resulting cat-
alogue of biomass data matched to body sizes stands as a record of present knowledge about
life on Earth. We then focus on assessing the quality of available data in order to guide future
research on causal mechanisms.
Results
The body sizes (Tables 2–4) that comprise the most biomass on Earth are the small (mainly
bacteria and archaea, 10−15 g per individual) and the large (mainly plants, 107 g), and these
peaks (15 Gt and 65 Gt per log size) outweighed intermediate sizes (10−11 g to 10−2 g, ~1 Gt)
by an order of magnitude (Fig 1A). The pattern is particularly clear on a linear biomass scale
(Fig 1B). Biomass uncertainty persisted across all sizes, with 95% confidence bounds being two
orders of magnitude from the smallest size to about 10 g and about one order of magnitude at
larger sizes. Multiple unrelated groups exhibited similar upper size limits, including forest
plants, grassland plants, fungi, wild terrestrial mammals, mangroves, fish, hard corals, seagrass,
and marine mammals that contribute to the cumulative biomass peak at the size of 107 g. All
data and code are provided at https://github.com/EWTekwa/BodySizeBiomass.
Our inferred within-group size-biomass relationships (Fig 2) appear reasonable, with fish
and plant spectra being comparable to previous community-level results that are relatively
well-studied [8,100]. Total biomass in the smallest size classes (<10−16 g) is dominated by
marine bacteria (Fig 2AA). The biomass peak around 10−15 g is dominated by subterranean
bacteria (Fig 2AH). Next, terrestrial fungi top the size range of 10−12 g to 1 g (Fig 2AG). Finally,
grassland plants (1 g to 10 g, Fig 2GI) and forest plants (10 g to 109 g, Fig 2GJ) make up almost
all remaining biomass. We note that mangroves, hard corals, macroalgae, and seagrass make
up 45% of total marine biomass even though they have been ignored in previous size spectra
studies [2,3,9].
Terrestrial and marine spectra are different. Large body sizes dominate on land and across
habitat realms, while the marine spectrum is roughly even across sizes (Fig 3). Marine

organisms may only contribute significantly to the global biomass spectrum at the size range
of 10−12 g to 10−3 g and below 10−16 g. Marine biomass is overall likely dwarfed by terrestrial
and subterranean biomass, though there is higher uncertainty in total biomass across size clas-
ses in the marine realm when compared to the terrestrial realm.
Linear regression of log biomass on log body size indicates a global power exponent β of
0.086±0.001 (s.d. across bootstraps) with a mean R2 of 0.56 (Fig 4A). For the terrestrial realm,
we obtained a similar β of 0.100±0.008 with a mean R2 of 0.66 (Fig 4F). These results show that
biomass increases with size. Even though the variances explained are high, these power laws
fail at the small size range, with confidence bounds missing the size class with the most bio-
mass, filled by microbes. For the marine realm we obtained a much lower β of 0.019±0.005
with a mean R2 of 0.11, indicating a similar biomass across log size bins (Fig 4K).
The overall and terrestrial spectra show similar small mean power law exponents β (0.051
to 0.086 and 0.047 to 0.100 respectively), while the marine spectrum has an effectively zero β
(-0.007 to 0.022) across choices of within group truncation methods, use of ramets (physiologi-
cal individuals) instead of genets (colonies of genetically identical individuals) as body sizes,
and exclusion of metabolically inactive biomass like subterranean microbes (Table 5, S1 Fig).
If the linear regressions were performed on log size-log abundance instead (equivalent to nor-
malized size-biomass spectra), we would obtain exponents α of -0.90±0.02 (R2 = 0.98), -0.80
±0.05 (R2 = 0.88), and -0.96±0.03 (R2 = 0.98), which are approximately β-1 as abundance is
biomass divided by size (but not exactly because the data, not the mean exponents, were
directly transformed, S2 Fig). As the inflated R2 suggest, the transformation from biomass to

slightly higher at large sizes on land), and there are little deviations visible from the power laws

size-abundance, with the -1 slope between size and abundance being the “trivial” trend on top
of which both linear (power laws) and nonlinear (multimodal) patterns emerge.
Across terrestrial, marine, and subterranean (under both land and sea) organisms, there is a
consistent log10 ratio of maximum to minimum size (size range) across all groups regardless of
median size (slope = 0, p = 0.99), with a mean ratio of 7.0±4.2 (S.D.). In other words, as mean
size increases, size range also increases with a power law exponent of 0 (S3 Fig). This supports
the view that the non-normalized size-biomass spectra are an appropriate way to investigate
representation across size, in addition to the statistical reasons outlined above.
Gaussian mixture models capable of multiple biomass modes reveal decreasing AICc scores
with increasing number of Gaussian components overall and within realms, indicating better
statistical descriptions than power laws (linear regressions) (Fig 4B–4E, 4G–4J and 4L–4O).
However, visual inspection suggests the size-biomass relationships are well described by two
mixture components, and further complexities appear hard to substantiate given the spectral
uncertainty and variations in AICc across bootstraps (Fig 4C, 4H and 4M). These two-mode
regressions explain much more of the data variation (R2 = 0.86, 0.84, and 0.56 for all realms,
terrestrial, and marine respectively) than power laws, the main difference being the ability to
identify both small and large size-biomass modes. These results indicate two size modes are
important and useful description of the global biomass spectra, beyond simple power laws.

dotted curves) cumulated across biological groups from 1000 bootstraps over within-group biomass and body size error distributions. Groups were organized
from the least massive at the bottom to the most massive at the top for visibility on the log scale (ordered from top left to bottom right in color legend for group
identity). Group biomasses are stacked so each group’s biomass is represented by its upper y-axis location minus its lower y-axis location (not by the upper y-
axis location alone). See Tables 2–4 for within-group biomass uncertainties, and S3 Table; for icon sources. B. Median biomass in linear biomass scale.
Confidence bounds are not shown here because they are so large as to obscure the median patterns on the linear scale.

Discussion
We performed a novel synthesis of the mass of all life in the biosphere, revealing size-biomass
patterns that contain features reminiscent of published results [4,8,9,20,21], but also new fea-
tures attributable to a greater taxonomic and error inclusion than previous efforts. Our three
major biological findings were: 1.) lower and upper size limits were shared by diverse organ-
isms, and these extreme sizes appear to contain most of the biomass on Earth; 2.) there was rel-
atively consistent biomass across log body size classes, described by power law exponents near
zero; and 3.) there was a greater proportion of total biomass on land concentrated in large
organisms when compared to the ocean. Methodologically, we found that analyses relating
log-biomass to log-size bins across all organisms (rather than size-abundance or normalized
size-abundance), while retaining uncertainties in both size and biomass, revealed the most
nuanced patterns.

The first pattern indicates near-universal lower and upper size limits where the highest bio-
mass accumulates. It is well-known that bacteria and archaea would share the lower size limit
of all living things at around 10−17 to 10−16 g. More surprisingly, multiple producer and con-
sumer groups on land and in the sea coincide with maximum body sizes between 107 and 109
g–a relatively narrow range compared to the 26 orders of magnitude spanning all free-living
things–including such diverse organisms as Sequoiadendron giganteum, Holcus mollis, Armil-
laria ostoyae, Rhizophora mangleo, Posidonia oceanicao, Porites lutea, and Balaenoptera muscu-
lus. This coincidence suggests an underlying upper size constraint, but multiple mechanisms
may simply coincide [101,102]. Gaussian mixtures with two components describe size-bio-
mass spectra better than power laws across-realm and within terrestrial and marine realms,
again showing that the lower and upper size limits across all free-living things are also modes
where biomass is most concentrated. While our mean estimates indicate these modes contain
roughly one order magnitude more biomass per log size than intermediate body sizes, uncer-
tainty in biomass was consistently higher than this magnitude, indicating that the data is too
poorly resolved to unequivocally support the bimodal pattern.
The second pattern indicates similar biomass across a large size range (a zero power law
exponent explaining how biomass varies with body size). This is highly consistent with size
spectra documented for aquatic ecosystems or within some taxonomic groups [4,10,13,28],
which supports metabolic, competitive, and trophic explanations [17,28]. However, unlike
previous studies, we included microbes, large producers, and other traditionally excluded
marine groups summing to 45% of total marine biomass [2,3,9]., and propagated both biomass
and size uncertainties. The fact that a near-zero exponent still persisted across all habitat
realms and analytical assumptions is surprising because our global-scale patterns are not likely

shaped by interactive forces such as trophic or competitive interactions previously proposed to
cause near-zero exponents [17]. We found some evidence for bimodality that diverged from
power laws, but large uncertainties prevent clear conclusions about whether or why such non-
linear patterns occur.
The third finding, that biomass in the ocean is somewhat more evenly distributed across
size classes than on land offers clues to a future theoretical synthesis. The marine realm exhib-
its trophic positions roughly determined by body size, thus the marine spectrum conforms
closer to a trophic-mediated uniform log-log size-biomass expectation [21,28]. Biophysics and
ecology–competition for nutrients—explain why primary producers are small in the ocean
versus large on land [4,103,104]. However, this narrative overlooks the striking similarities
between the two realms. Large primary producers that also provide physical structures to eco-
systems dominate both land and sea (grass, tree, mangroves, corals, seagrass and kelps).
Despite their large biomass, however, we note that large marine primary producers are
restricted to shallow seas in which access to light and nutrients in the sediment create a
biophysical environment part way between ocean and land, do not dominate all marine eco-
systems (e.g., pelagic), and may be considered its own realm. In addition, excluding “metaboli-
cally inactive” material such as wood, subterranean microbes, and skeleton produced by living
corals would flatten the size-biomass spectra globally and in both terrestrial and marine realms
(closer to β = 0, Table 5), but without erasing the apparent global bimodality and differences
across realms (S1D Fig). The causes of size-biomass differences in different habitat realms
remain to be explored.
Together, the findings of universal size limits possibly coinciding with a bimodal biomass
distribution, overall similar biomass across sizes, and differences between habitat realms sug-
gest possible roles for both universal and local explanations, depending on which feature of

size-biomass spectra we focus on. Previously unexplored universal constraints, perhaps similar
to known biochemical [29] or spatial-cellular mechanisms [105], can conceivably explain size
limits and multiple high-biomass modes at different sizes, but these constraints may be modi-
fied or overwritten by local interactions between different organisms at finer spatial scales. The
relative strengths of universal versus local constraints may be partially understood by compar-
ing size-biomass spectra and their uncertainties across-realm versus within-realm. For
instance, if the multiple modes observed across-realm are shared by different realms, then
spectral uncertainties should be lower across-realm because of more data (lower observation
error and greater taxonomic coverage [106,107]) and universal constraints may be responsible.
On the other hand, if different realms contribute different size modes, then spectral uncertain-
ties should be higher for the across-realm spectrum because of higher biological variance, sup-
porting the hypothesis that local constraints likely shape the across-realm pattern. However,
this reduction in uncertainties at smaller scales is only detectable if sample coverage does not
drastically decrease. In our analyses, some size modes coincide across all realms, leaving for
the possibilities of both universal and local constraints. In addition, the across-realm data
exhibits narrower confidence bounds and a stronger signal of bimodality than the terrestrial
realm alone (Fig 4H and 4M), and even more so when compared to the relatively hard-to-sam-
ple marine realm alone, because of higher aggregate data availability. These mode overlaps and
uncertainty patterns indicate that universal constraints may strongly shape size-biomass spec-
tra everywhere in similar ways, but this impression may also be due to a lack of data.
Our study shows that body size biomass spectra include substantial uncertainties. Within-
group biomass uncertainties are high among some taxa, especially in microbes [30]. Data and
synthesis of within and between-study uncertainties on biomass that we base our study on
remain crude across groups [30] but are consistent with estimates from independent studies
on plant and fish [8,100,108]. We have also filled the important gaps of marine habitat builders
[59,88,109,110] and incorporated latest estimates for subterranean microbes [96,111]. Defini-
tions of body size (ramets vs. genets), mass (with vs. without metabolically inactive compo-
nents like wood, skeleton, and subterranean microbes), and realm (mangroves being marine,
terrestrial, or partial) remain open for debate. Sensitivity analyses of these variations on cumu-
lative size-biomass spectra show crude patterns like power laws are consistent, but nuances
like the location of size-biomass peaks are uncertain. Our methodology was designed to mini-
mize biases and propagated different sources of uncertainty. Indeed, this approach identified
that large uncertainty persists through all sizes. In contrast, most previous macroecological
studies have assumed certainty in minimum and maximum sizes (size classes) instead of prop-
agating size error [4,7,9,12,112,113]. This assumption would have resulted in nearly uniform
biomass distributions across log sizes within biological groups, which though did not affect

mean power law parameter estimates, severely underestimated biomass uncertainty particu-
larly at large sizes. Intuition tells us we are nowhere near as certain about where biomass is
concentrated at large sizes (1.2-fold uncertainty at sizes 10 to 109 g assuming near-uniform
within-group distributions in S1B Fig, which is just the total biomass uncertainty for plants
independent of size). Error propagations in both size and biomass, as well as flexible within-
group size-biomass distributions rather than strong assumptions like uniformity or a particu-
lar skew (like power law, Gaussian, or lognormal), result in ~10 fold uncertainty at the same
size range (Fig 1). Given current knowledge on how size range varies with size within biologi-
cal groups and how biomass varies across sizes, we recommend studying the relationship
between log-biomass and log-size (i.e. size-biomass spectra) using both power laws and non-
linear statistics such as Gaussian mixtures. Our results highlight as much the current knowl-
edge about the Earth’s biosphere as it does potential gaps in observation. For instance, missing
observations in specific size classes will tend to create an impression of multimodality even if
in reality there is a continuum of biomass across sizes. Multiple within or between-study bio-
mass estimates for particular biological groups may not be spatially independent and thus not
representative, which can lead to an underestimation of uncertainty and bias in expected total
biomass. However, we would not know what these uncertainties and biases are without more
sampling. In light of these limitations, uncertainties of our knowledge of size-biomass spectra
were likely underestimated (but to a less severe degree than other macroecologoical studies
[4,7,9,12,28,112,113]), yet even these optimistic estimates reveal how little we know about our
global biosphere. Quantifying uncertainties while identifying knowledge gaps remain priorities
for macroecology [114].
The state and change of size-biomass spectra should be an urgent biodiversity assessment
objective and a fertile ground for fundamental theories. The massive data requirement to con-
duct a more detailed spectral survey may resemble modern cosmology and its collaborative
search for patterns in matter distribution [115]. Our results provide a first crude roadmap for
what patterns may exist, but they will likely drastically change if size-biomass spectra become
targets for research programs. Moving forward, macroecology should embrace taxonomic
inclusivity and unexplored scales that defy existing explanations.
Materials and methods
Biomass data
To compile the global aggregate body size biomass spectrum among biological groups defined
by habitat and taxonomy, we used global biomass (gigatons [Gt] in carbon content) assess-
ments and minimum, median, and maximum body sizes (grams [g] in carbon content) within
groups (Tables 2–4). We started with the most comprehensive existing synthesis of global bio-
mass estimates, which incorporate uncertainties within and between multiple studies [30]. We
followed the biological grouping in Bar-On’s database [30], which is not at a consistent taxo-
nomic level but instead reflect the highest resolution at which a biomass estimate is available
and comparable to other groups. Bar-On et al. drew from hundreds of studies that reported
either biomass per sampled area or global extrapolations. The biomass per sampled area data
was extrapolated by Bar-On et al. to the global scale based on the spatial distribution of envi-
ronmental variables such as temperature and habitat type (akin to species distribution models
but at a higher taxonomic level). The best estimates were obtained from the geometric mean of
multiple data sources within group, and within- and between-study uncertainties were propa-
gated (S4 Fig; see Bar-On et al.’s supplementary). We recognize that estimates of mean biomass
and uncertainty can likely be improved for all groups, but this is not the main goal of our
paper. Instead, we complemented Bar-On’s database only when biological groups with

potentially high biomass were missing or clearly outdated, including cryptogamic phototrophs
[109], hard corals [88,110], mangroves [59], and subterranean prokaryotes [96,111]. We placed
mangroves in the marine realm because they live in coastal salt water, support a high diversity
of marine fish, and are considered an integral part of blue carbon accounting [58,59,116].
Details for these new estimates are described in the footnotes of Tables 2–4. For some biologi-
cal groups, new and potentially relevant data has appeared after Bar-On’s publication. How-
ever, these studies cataloged only biomass by species without assessing their contributions to
overall group biomass (e.g., bird [117] and mammals [118]), did not directly address present-
day biomass (e.g., fish [119]), or were nearly identical to Bar-On’s original estimates (e.g., ter-
restrial plants [108]). We included the plant woody material and coral skeleton produced by a
living individual as part of biomass in our primary analysis, as was done in a previous global
biomass synthesis [30]. This approach is consistent with the idea that all biomass regardless of
metabolic status contributes to ecosystem functioning, though we also explored removing this
biomass for sensitivity analyses and for future investigations.
Body size data
Size was defined as the carbon content (grams) of a unicellular or multicellular organism.
Defining an organism is not entirely straightforward for clonal life forms like grasses, corals,
and fungi. Here, we used genets as our primary definition but also explore the consequences of
using ramets to measure body size. Genet is a colony of genetically identical ramets in a loca-
tion from a single parent, whereas a ramet is a physiologically distinguishable individual.
Genet is a widely accepted functional definition of a biological unit because genetically identi-
cal cell agglomerates function as coherent units and actively share resources, and often seem
like separate organisms only because the connecting tissues are invisible to us above the sub-
strate [61,120,121]. We collected minimum, median, and maximum genet sizes from a litera-
ture search (Tables 2–4). Three points for biomass distribution within each group is
minimalistic but, given our current knowledge of most groups, there are few other reliable size
data to serve as additional reference points across each biological group. In the literature,
mean sizes are often reported without specifying the species while assuming a log-normal size-
biomass distribution [30], so we can record these mean sizes as median size in our dataset
without transformations. In cases where no mean or median sizes were reported in [30], we
used sizes mentioned in the literature as qualitatively representative species (those mentioned
as most “common” or “widespread”), which are likely closer to the median rather than the
mean size, given no a priori knowledge of the distribution. We used sizes at maturity because
this is likely where biomass is concentrated within species [21], and because data are not avail-
able for most taxa on the contribution of spore or juvenile stages. However, our choices of
body size cutoffs in subsequent estimates of within-group size-biomass spectra can approxi-
mate the biomass share of these immature sizes.
We converted all size observations to an estimate of mass in terms of carbon. The body
sizes of some species were reported in units of grams carbon, but for many species we needed
to extrapolate from wet or dry mass. When size estimates in the literature were reported in wet
mass, we first searched the literature for a species-specific wet weight to grams carbon conver-
sion. When a species-specific conversion was not available, we used the conversion from the
closest relative within the taxon (see online repository tables). When taxon-specific conver-
sions were not available, we assumed 30% dry mass per wet mass unit, and 50% carbon per dry
mass unit following previous conventions [30]. In some cases, body size was reported in units
of length (particularly among annelids, nematodes, and fishes). For these taxa, we found exist-
ing length to weight conversions for the species or the closest relative within the taxon. If body

size was reported in diameter, as was the case for most unicellular species, we found the vol-
ume assuming that the organism was either spherical [56] or tubular [57], and then found
existing biovolume to biomass conversions for the species or the closest relative within the
taxon. For hard corals, since each corallite or colony is often tightly packed among other units,
we estimated that volume as the cube of the reported diameter. While some of these assump-
tions may introduce size errors that we do not explicitly track in our uncertainty analyses, the
different plausible conversion factors are within an order of magnitude. This error magnitude
is much smaller than the size ranges estimated for each biological group based on the uncer-
tainties that we did track (Fig 2).
We excluded from our body size (dry carbon mass) any non-free-living disease organisms,
which are mainly found within trematode, nematode, virus, bacterial, and fungal groups. Dis-
ease organisms tend to represent extreme body sizes within their groups and may have been
double counted as host biomass, which present a special challenge to estimating within-group
size-biomass distributions that we do not address here. It is likely that the total biomass of dis-
ease organisms is low both within hosts (3% or less) and together as a group (similar to wild
birds, the second lowest biomass among free-living groups) [24,122] and thus should not
appreciably affect the cross-taxa spectrum, even though parasites and microbiome-associated
organisms may have disproportionate effects on the biomass of other organisms.
To determine how biomass should be tallied by size class, we assessed how a group’s body
size (mass) range (as directly observed from data) is related to median body size. A group’s
size range represents an aspect of biological variation within which organisms can be consid-
ered similar. If groups with larger sizes vary in size by the same magnitude (rather than same
order of magnitude) as groups with smaller sizes (e.g., group #1 contains 1-10g organisms,
group #2 contains 1001g-1010g organisms), then tallying biomass by log size bins would
group together increasingly different organisms at large median sizes. This is the rationale for
normalized size-biomass, which divides the measured biomass of a size class by the class’s pre-
sumably artificial size range [8]. Conversely, if groups’ size range increases as a power function
of median size, then larger size classes conceivably contain larger size variations that represent
similar organisms. In this case normalization does not seem necessary on biological basis, and
the size-biomass spectrum relating log biomass to log size, as often assumed [123], is natural.
We performed a linear regression of the ratio of log10 maximum size to log10 minimum size
(from known species) on log10 median size across biological groups. A slope (power exponent)
of 0 would support the use of size-biomass spectra without normalization.
Notes on biomass and body size calculation
For Tables 2–4, calculations and references for within-group body size and biomass different
from [30] are documented below. The notes are labelled by alphabetical superscripts.
a. Among lichens, likely the most abundant among cryptogams, we estimate that 87% contain
phycobionts (Trebouxia 8–21 μm) [124] and 13% contain cyanobionts (Nostoc punctiforme
5 μm) [35]. This composition was used to estimate the mean body size.
b. The total lichen biomass and uncertainty were obtained from [109]; to obtain cryptogamic
phototrophs’ biomass, the fungal portion of lichen was subtracted out. Twenty percent of
fungi species occur in lichens [125], so 20% of the total fungal biomass was subtracted from
the lichen biomass to get the cryptogamic phototrophs’ biomass.
c. Assumes amphibian habitat area is mainly rainforest, 5.50x1012 m2 [31], and 0.1 individual
per m2 (lower than [30]’s likely overestimate). Uncertainty is unknown, so copied from rep-
tiles which is the taxon with the highest uncertainty.

n. Mean colony size was estimated as the geometric mean of corallite or maximum colony
sizes. Only maximum colony sizes were found across species and may contain several gen-
ets, hence the geometric mean. For each estimate, measures for four coral types were con-
verted first to cubic volumes using 3D morphologies, assuming branching morphotype for
"competitive" and "weedy" corals, and massive morphotype for "generalist" and "stress-tol-
erant" corals [110]. Each volume estimates were then converted to mass using type-specific
skeletal densities [128], C per CaCO3, and weighted by global coral cover contributions
[88].
o. Mean skeleton biomass was the geometric mean of two biomass estimates based on global
coral cover having heights corresponding to either corallites or maximum colony sizes.
Mean tissue biomass was 0.05 Gt with a 10 fold uncertainty [30]. Overall mean biomass was
the sum of mean skeleton and tissue biomass, and overall uncertainty was obtained from
assuming that the overall min/max correspond to the sum of min/max skeleton and tissue
estimates.
p. Total subterranean microbial biomass was assumed to be the geometric mean of 23 to 31
PgC (which is 27 PgC) from [96]. 70% of microbial abundance is expected to be bacteria
[129].
q. Range of total subterranean microbial cell count from four models in [96] was 1.6 to 11.2 x
1029, with a geometric mean of 4.2 x 1029. This range corresponds to a three-fold uncer-
tainty, which is similar to bacteria and archaea groups in other habitat realms.
r. 30% of microbial abundance is expected to be archaea [129]. See note for bacterial biomass.
s. Same as uncertainty for subterranean bacteria.
Within-group size-biomass spectra
We used the truncated generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution to infer the body size-
biomass distribution (with size on a log scale) within biological groups (see S4 Fig for exam-
ples). The probability distribution function for biomass y(x) in gigatonnes was written in term
of log size x, with B being the total biomass of the group, and the three parameters μ, σ, and ξ

We chose the GEV distribution because it is flexible, encompassing previously proposed
body size- biomass relationships outlined below. Cross-taxa size-biomass relationships are
often described using power laws, with positive [10,13] or negative [8,15–17] exponents result-
ing in extremely left or right-skewed distributions (where the body size with the maximum
biomass is at the end of the size range). For plant communities where community-level size-
biomass relationships are better documented than other groups, the right-skewed Weibull dis-
tribution was used [100], which is a special case of the GEV. On the other hand, empirical
studies on size-species frequency distributions, though not easily translatable to size-biomass
spectra (except when all species have equal biomass), exhibit dome-shaped [130] and becomes
less consistently right-skewed as one descends into finer taxonomic classifications [21,131],
which are possibilities for size-biomass spectra that cannot be captured by power laws. At the
extreme, ontogeny within many species leads to a greater total biomass for large adults than
for small larvae (left skew) [21]. The possibilities of both left and right skews in addition to
nonlinearity make standard distributions like lognormal, exponential, and gamma inappropri-
ate because each only produces one type of skew. We used truncation because, without it, con-
tinuous distributions would typically imply finite biomass at unrealistic body sizes, especially
for groups with high total biomass (e.g., bacteria having finite biomass at the size of trees). We
also renormalized the distribution to retain the total biomass under the curve. Other similar
distributions such as skew normal and extreme value can also be used, but they cannot be
meaningfully distinguished from GEV because of the paucity of data, nor favored for mecha-
nistic reasons because of a lack of theories on size-biomass relationships.
Two steps were involved in generating a bootstrapped estimate of median size-biomass
spectra per group. We first interporate probability distributions (Eqs 1 and 2) to three
observed reference sizes for each organismal group compiled from the literature: minimum,
median, and maximum sizes (S1–S3 Tables). This fit was achieved by minimizing the sum of
squares of the residuals between the three observed reference (log) sizes and the 0.05th, 50th,
and 99.95th percentiles of the truncated generalized extreme value distribution. The probability
distribution thus placed close to 99.9% of the biomass within the reported size range. Trunca-
tion was applied at two orders of magnitude below the reported minimum size, but not to the
maximum size, to accommodate uncertainties associated with undetected small species and
immature individuals. This assumption is compatible with empirical evidence across marine
and terrestrial life with offspring being around two orders of magnitude smaller than adults in
mass [132,133]. For microbes, offspring length (L) is around 0.2 to 0.5 times of the parent
among model organisms [134]. Since volume (proportional to mass) is approximately 4/3 πL3
[56], offspring mass is one to two orders of magnitude smaller than parent mass. We note that
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one of the best-known bacteria that live in a wide range of human
and natural habitats, have offspring that are two orders of magnitude smaller than parents in
mass [135]. The upper size limits are likely more accurate than the lower size limits because
larger species are easier to observe; in addition, the upper limits are not influenced by

ontogeny, hence the asymmetry in truncation. We explored different truncation amounts to
both lower and upper limits in sensitivity tests.
In the second step, we used the initial distribution fit from step one to represent our uncer-
tainty in where the median biomass occurs within groups (S4 Fig). A probability distribution
is by definition the uncertainty in a parameter’s value; in this case the parameter is the median
size because it is the most uncertain among the three datapoints that was fitted to data. We
then resampled 1000 sets of these within-group median body size and biomass, keeping mini-
mum and maximum sizes constant, and re-fit the truncated generalized extreme value distri-
bution each time to generate bootstrapped size-biomass relationships. This way, even in cases
where biomass estimates have low uncertainty, such as in grassland plants, uncertainty in
median size leads to large uncertainty in biomass at each possible grass size. In particular, to
propagate median size uncertainty, the median size was randomly generated from the initially
fitted truncated generalized distribution per bootstrap. To propagate biomass uncertainty, we
randomly sampled in log space using standard deviation σ = λ/1.96, where the fold uncertainty
λ correspond to the 95% confidence interval (with the log upper/lower bounds deviating by λ
from the log mean according to a lognormal error model) following previous report [30]. The
2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstraps represent the lower bound, median, and
upper bound of the within-group size-biomass spectra.
Statistical trends and modes across groups
Global median size-biomass spectra and confidence intervals were obtained by cumulating
biomass density (Gt biomass per log body size) of all groups in a habitat realm (or realms) cen-
tered at each size bin (1/40 of a log unit) per bootstrap. In other words, the cumulative biomass
density is the biomass probability density and then normalized so that the area under the
curve matches the total biomass within realm(s). In the main text, we simplified the term “bio-
mass density” to “biomass.” Statistical descriptions were obtained for three different classifica-
tions of organisms: all realms, terrestrial, and marine.
To fit statistical relationships between size and cumulative biomass in each habitat realm,
we did not perform simple regressions directly on the best estimated spectra because 1) bio-
mass datapoints are not independent across sizes within groups, and 2) the cross-taxa biomass
totals in any size class depends on all groups in that size class, making the error structure corre-
lated across the size range. To obtain confidence bounds, we relied on a parametric boot-
strapped ensemble of possible size class–total biomass spectra (size-biomass spectra). For each
bootstrap, the possible continuous size-biomass spectrum was sampled 40 times per log size
class from -18 to 11 in the same way that it was plotted for visualization (size bin width was 1/
40 of a log unit). We then performed statistical regressions on each of the 1000 bootstrap sam-
pled sets. The 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the outputs at each size represented each regres-
sion model’s 95% confidence bounds. The result is that the confidence bounds may not strictly
resemble the regression models; for example, single Gaussian fits across bootstraps may iden-
tify different peaks and thus the upper and lower bounds across size may be multimodal (S4
Fig). Size bins with total biomass lower than 10−5 Gt (1000 t), which is an order of magnitude
below the lower bound of amphibian biomass (the lowest among all groups), were not
included as datapoints for the regression. A cutoff is necessary to avoid large or infinitely nega-
tive values after log transformation, which would prevent regression from proceeding.
We fit two kinds of regression models to test for trends in the amount of biomass across
size classes across all taxa. For allometric power law relationships, ordinary least-squares
regressions were performed to obtain power exponents β that explain the discrete sampled log
size-log biomass (x-y) relationships. For Gaussian mixture models, up to four modes

(components) were fit using an expectation maximization algorithm to minimize nonlinear
least squares (‘gauss1’, ‘gauss2’, etc. in Matlab R2017a, MathWork, Natick, MA). During fitting
for the Gaussian mixture, we added log10(10−5)+1 to log biomasses to ensure that the mini-
mum value was 1; smaller values were already removed previously. For plotting, we subtracted
log10(10−5)+1 from the solutions. We measured R2 and the corrected Akaike Information Cri-
terion (AICc) for model comparison [136], which results in means and standard deviations
across bootstraps.
We additionally obtained power laws for two alternative types of size spectra using linear
regressions (Table 1). First, the size-abundance spectra [137] replaces biomass with abun-
dance. Abundance is biomass divided by body mass, so the power law exponent α for size
(mass)-abundance is approximately the exponent for size (mass)-biomass minus one [3]. Sec-
ond, the normalized size-biomass [8] replaces biomass with total biomass divided by the width
of biomass size class, centered in the middle of the size class along the x-axis. In our data syn-
thesis, the width is a constant of one in log size scale, since each point along the x-axis repre-
sents the biomass density, or biomass per log size unit. Consequently, normalized biomass BN
at log size x is BN = B/(10x+0.5-10x-0.5) where B is the cumulative biomass density at size x. By
taking the log of both sides of this equation, we obtain log10BN = log10B-x-0.454. Since log10B-
x is log10(B/10x), or log10(abundance), log normalized biomass in our data is just log abun-
dance minus 0.454. Thus, the power law exponent for the normalized size-biomass spectrum
is identical to α.
Sensitivity analyses
We repeat the regression analyses on global size-biomass spectra with datasets composed
using different truncation limits for the within-group GEV distributions, different definitions
of body size (ramets vs. genets), and different mass inclusivity (with vs. without metabolically
inactive material) (S1 Fig, Table 5).
Changing truncation limits should affect the GEV distributional fit for within-group size-
biomass spectra. In particular, we experimented with the different size truncation limits of [-1,
+1] and [0,0] on log scale. A small-enough truncation window should result in a distribution
that is relative flat like most continuous probability distributions that have at most one interior
inflection point. This implies size-biomass distributions that approach uniform distributions.
Additionally, a truncated uniform size-biomass distribution is expected to minimize biomass
uncertainty propagation because all bootstraps will have the same size range and only varia-
tions from biomass uncertainty.
The unit ‘genets’ was dissolved into smaller units of ramets for the variant definition of
body size. Grassland plants, seagrass, soil fungi, and hard corals were affected by the switch to
the ramet definition (S1 Table). In particular, the original large size range for soil fungi was
reduced but remained the largest among all groups. This large size range reflects the group’s
unique history of having evolved and lost multicellularity many times [138], and having inde-
terminate growth through hyphae [139] that manifest in all possible sizes up to the upper lim-
its. Some of the referenced species exhibiting minimum, median, and maximum sizes were
changed based on the alternative definition.
We re-calculated the biomass spectrum only including the portion of the world’s biomass
that is “metabolically active”, which would exclude skeletons, wood, and subterranean
microbes [140]. This affects both the body size and biomass of forest plants, grassland plants,
mangroves, and hard corals (S2 Table). Excluding biomass with low metabolism potentially
reduces all reported minimum, median, and maximum sizes we reference from the literature
withing groups because this biomass is taken out of all genets or ramets (individuals). In all

cases we found that species with the minimum, median, and maximum sizes remained the
same, but their sizes were reduced.

S4 Fig. Estimating within-group size-biomass spectrum. The size-biomass relationship for each
group is composed of biomass and size estimates. Biomass estimates and uncertainties were
mostly based on published syntheses that incorporate multiple independent sets of sampled bio-
mass (black dots on maps) that are projected over habitat ranges (akin to species distribution
models). Body size distribution and uncertainty were based on literature search for minimum,
median, and maximum sizes within groups (green dots). A truncated generalized extreme value
distribution was first fitted to the three points that result in an uncertainty estimate for median
size. 1000 pairs of resampled total biomass and median size were then used to refit a truncated
generalized extreme value distribution, resulting in a set of bootstrap samples that create the final
median estimate and 95% confidence intervals for the size-biomass spectrum.
