The book series Trends in Logic covers essentially the same areas as the journal Studia Logica, that is,
contemporary formal logic and its applications and relations to other disciplines. The series aims at publishing
monographs and thematically coherent volumes dealing with important developments in logic and presenting
signiﬁcant contributions to logical research.
Volumes of Trends in Logic may range from highly focused studies to presentations that make a subject
accessible to a broader scientiﬁc community or offer new perspectives for research. The series is open to
contributions devoted to topics ranging from algebraic logic, model theory, proof theory, philosophical logic,
non-classical logic, and logic in computer science to mathematical linguistics and formal epistemology. This
thematic spectrum is also reﬂected in the editorial board of Trends in Logic. Volumes may be devoted to
speciﬁc logical systems, particular methods and techniques, fundamental concepts, challenging open problems,
different approaches to logical consequence, combinations of logics, classes of algebras or other structures, or
interconnections between various logic-related domains.
This book series is indexed in SCOPUS.
Authors interested in proposing a completed book or a manuscript in progress or in conception can contact

Karl Popper at Aoraki / Mount Cook, New Zealand in May 1945.

Preface
Although Karl Popper was one of the outstanding philosophers of the twentieth
century, his writings on deductive logic are little known. They deserve to be known
better: not only historically as part of the work of a great philosopher of science, but
also systematically as a significant contribution to the debate on the foundations of
logic. Here Popper advocates a view of logic which in more modern terms would be
called “inferentialist” (he himself spoke of “inferential definitions” of logical signs).
He developed this view of logic during his time in New Zealand (1937–1945) and
afterwards in London1, and published his results in a series of articles in the late
1940s. This work is far more than a by-product. After the composition of The Open
Society and Its Enemies in 1940–1942 (Popper, 1945a)2, which upon its publication
in 1945 established Popper’s fame as a social and political philosopher, he spent
most of his research time during the following years on formal logic. His articles of
1947–1949 were written “with much enthusiasm”3, and one can well imagine that
Popper would have continued these investigations, had they found a better reception
in the logic community at the time. Popper even planned to write a textbook on

Mount Cook, New Zealand, in May 1945. On the trip back he received a cable from Friedrich Hayek
notifying him that the appointment committee of the London School of Economics and Political
Science (LSE) had decided positively on his application for a readership in logic and scientific
method, which shaped Popper’s future career; cf. Dahrendorf (1995, pp. 422-427) and Hacohen
(2002, p. 499).

of 15 October 1942 (this volume, § 23.1).

wife Hennie, of Easter 1947, to a range of New Zealand friends in which she describes “his recent
occupation with the salvation of logic” (Hennie Popper, 1947a): “He returned and simply dived back
into his logic, saying only sh-sh-sh-sh and do you think one could type this sign on the typewriters?
And there was a meeting of some biologists in London, and he went there for the whole day and
came back at night late and returned again to his papers. He is terribly excited about it and says
he is finding all sorts of simplifications and it’s getting simpler and simpler, and more and more
interesting! And it just absorbs him completely.”. Brian Boyd has kindly pointed us to this passage.

elementary logic, as a remark in a letter to John C. Eccles of 10 November 1946
shows.4
Popper’s writings on logic were reviewed by prominent mathematical logicians,
and many other logicians and philosophers knew his papers or were at least aware of
their existence, as occasional references show. Nevertheless, the overall consideration
of this work as a philosophically significant contribution to formal logic and to the
foundations of deductive reasoning was limited – something that remains the case
today. To improve this situation, our idea was to produce an edition which allows the
reader easy access to Popper’s logical works, which at the same time is sufficiently
comprehensive to cover most aspects of what we consider to be their essence.
The central part of this collection are the six articles published in 1947–1949 on
the foundations of deductive logic (Chapters 2–7). They are also the topic of our
introduction to Popper’s inferentialist conception of logic (Chapter 1). These articles
are accompanied by a short note of 1943 (Chapter 8). This note deals with negation in
a manner that shows traces of what would be fully developed in the later articles, and
which is interesting from the point of view of modern discussions on paraconsistent
logics, the ex falso rule and disjunctive syllogism. These articles are furthermore
accompanied by three later papers written in the 1950s, which exemplify that Popper
continued to be interested in logic, although not primarily from the inferentialist
perspective. Chapter 9 shows Popper’s abiding interest in Tarski’s work, here in
the definitions of satisfaction and truth in contradistinction to logical consequence,
which is the basis of the inferentialist approach. Chapter 10 takes up a discussion
of the liar paradox by Fitch, arguing that declaring a liar sentence to be neither
true nor false does not escape paradoxicality. Chapter 11 discusses the subjunctive
conditional, which plays a significant role in philosophy of science when it comes
to the meaning of natural laws. Chapter 12 is reproduced from Schilpp (1974) and
presents Popper’s reply to Lejewski (1974), who had dealt with Popper’s inferential
approach to logic. This reply contains many interesting comments on the background
to Popper’s development of his inferentialist approach. In Chapter 13 we reprint the
reviews of Popper’s articles on logic. These were written by renowned logicians, and
some of them were very critical of Popper’s approach, both for conceptual reasons
and for reasons of technical exposition. We doubt, however, that these reviews were
the reason for the poor reception of Popper’s logical works then and now. Even the
most critical of these reviews left open the possibility to pursue certain basics of
Popper’s works in revised forms. We would rather claim that Popper’s inferentialism
as well as his extensive discussion of dualities and non-classical negations (beyond
just intuitionism) was too much ahead of its time. Inferentialism, proof-theoretic
semantics and corresponding theories of meaning, apart from their implicit presence

Alexander Carr-Saunders, the then director of the LSE, in which he writes: “I may say that I am at
present preparing a textbook on formal logic, not because I like writing a textbook (it interferes,
on the contrary, badly with my own research programme) but because I find it necessary for my
students. The existing textbooks have aims totally different from what I consider to be the aim of a
modern introductory course in Logic.”. A table of contents with possible titles for such a textbook
can be found in Popper’s Nachlass (KPS Box 371, Folder 1).

in the work of Gentzen, became prominent only in the late 1960s in the aftermath of
Prawitz’s (1965) interpretation of natural deduction and the establishment of a general
proof theory that made the structure of proofs and inferences a topic of philosophical
interest.
The second part of this volume presents a number of manuscripts from Popper’s
Nachlass, which are related to the published papers. Chapter 14 is a draft of a joint
paper by Bernays and Popper that did not make it into a publication. Chapter 15
discusses the relation between logical and descriptive signs and situates it in relation
to Tarski’s concept of logical consequence and to ideas by Carnap in his Introduction
to Semantics (Carnap, 1942). Chapter 16 is an introduction to an intended study of
classical and non-classical negations, which figures prominently in Chapters 5 and 6.
Chapter 17 is a somewhat later draft from 1952 which tries to derive truth tables from
inferential characterizations. Chapter 18 deals with the distinction between derivation
and demonstration, a topic that according to our assessment Popper would have
pursued more deeply had he continued to systematically publish in logic. Chapters 19
and 20 are lecture notes (from 1939–1941) and general considerations on the origins
of modern logic, respectively. These texts put modern formal logic in a broader
philosophical perspective and elucidate how Popper saw logic as a discipline. We
here present only a selection of these notes, which we consider to be representative
of Popper’s views. There are considerably more manuscripts in his Nachlass, though
many of them are variants of what is published here.
In the third part we reproduce letters to and from Popper dealing with his logical
works. As with the second part, this is a selection of items based on what we consider
best suited to situate Popper’s logical work and its background in the context of
his interactions with colleagues. For somebody who wants to study sophisticated
historical issues, letters exchanged with other authors might be relevant, many of
which are available in the Karl Popper Collection Klagenfurt and at the Hoover
Institution Library & Archives, Stanford.5
We decided to omit from this collection materials that deal with one nonetheless
important theme, namely Popper’s work on Boolean algebra. Popper had studied
Boolean algebra already before he moved on to the inferential approach to logic
presented here, and studied and discussed it for the rest of his career, combining
purely algebraic (lattice-theoretic) investigations with his attempts to axiomatize
probability without presupposing deductive logic, and with his interpretation of
quantum mechanics and its logic (cf. Miller, 2016; Del Santo, 2020). In Popper’s
Nachlass one finds a large number of manuscripts dealing with these topics, including
bundles full of algebraic calculations, but also with proofs of theorems, some of which
are both systematically and historically relevant.6 In retrospect, in his autobiography
of 1974 (Popper, 1974c), Popper even claims that problems in probability theory
5 Popper’s literary estate is located at the Hoover Institution Library & Archives in Stanford. The
Karl Popper Collection in Klagenfurt contains copies of the literary estate and Popper’s private
library.
6 Del Santo (2020) gives a list of materials from the Karl Popper Collection which are related to
the logic of quantum mechanics. Popper himself refers to this work, for example, in the letter to
Carnap of 28 May 1944 (this volume, § 23.5). His correspondence with Forder (Chapter 26) is full

Preface
led him to his logical work, pointing to the well-known formal relationship between
lattice-theoretic and logical properties (Popper, 1974c, fn 188). However, even if this
is historically correct and not simply a later attribution7, we have two strong reasons
to not include Popper’s work on Boolean algebra in the present volume. Firstly, formal
relationships between Boolean algebra and some aspects of inferentialist logic do
not affect at all the philosophical rationale for inferentialism. Popper’s inferentialist
approach to logic is a philosophical conception in its own right and is also understood
and presented by him as such. Thus the present volume is self-contained, even though
some ideas and results have formal counterparts in other areas. Secondly, the quantity
of the notes and papers on Boolean algebra in the Nachlass, if one combined them
with an edition of his published papers on probability theory and probabilistic logic,
together with Popper’s correspondence on these matters, would be so large that it
could easily make a volume of its own. Such a volume would be a very welcome
companion to the present one, with many interesting interconnections.
Editorial notes Our editorial corrections and additions are marked by ⟨⟩. Published
errata have been included tacitly. Other errata, such as those found in letters or
unpublished works are marked by ⟨⟩. Obvious typographic errors have been corrected
without indication; however,some orthographic errors in Popper’s German letters were
left in place since he explicitly mentions that he is making them. In our transcriptions
of handwritten manuscripts and letters we write ⟨word?⟩or “word⟨?⟩” where we
were unsure about the correct reading of a word. In quotations we use [], as usual, to
frame ellipses and our additions or conversions to facilitate the flow of reading.
Popper’s expressions 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . 𝑎𝑛and 𝑎1, 𝑎2. . . .𝑎𝑛have been replaced by
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛throughout. The typesetting of formulas has been unified to some
extent, and we have made further minor typographic modifications. For example,
section numbers or letters have been moved from the beginning of first paragraphs to
centered headings, some lists have been reformatted for better readability, and we
have changed the font style of author names from small capitals to normal.
Popper usually cites without providing bibliographic details or bibliographies. We
provide references in the text in the format ⟨Carnap, 1942⟩or in editorial footnotes,
which are marked by letters a, b, . . .. Numbers 1, 2, . . . always signify author footnotes.
The references sections at the end of chapters have been added by us. The bibliography
at the end of this volume comprises all references.
Page concordances for Popper’s published works are provided at the end of this
volume. In published works, original page breaks are indicated by the symbol | with
the original page number in the left margin. Three papers, namely Popper (1947d,
1948a,c), were published both by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences and in
Indagationes Mathematicae using the same printing plates (with minor adjustments
of references to Boolean algebra and of discussions of Boolean algebra problems related to logic.
The letter to Kleene (§ 28.1) relates to his later interest in the logic of quantum mechanics.
7 Namely, an attribution made at a time when Popper was involved in issues of probability theory
and quantum mechanics. In the logical writings themselves he always describes Tarski’s notion of
logical consequence as his starting point.

to the titles in Indagationes Mathematicae). We give preference to the former, but
also provide page numbers of the latter in the respective concordances.
In Popper’s unpublished manuscripts and in his correspondence we indicate page
breaks also by the symbol | with page numbers in the left margin. Underlined text is
rendered in italics. English translations of letters written in German are provided by
us. In many cases, only carbon copies or drafts of letters sent were available to us.
These may lack the sender’s signature; we have not added it in these cases.
There is a combined person and subject index for the whole volume. As this book
is published open access, the reader can also use the freely available electronic version
for searches.
Popper almost never wrote abstracts. Those featured in this collection are our
additions. Editorial notes for the respective works are given below these abstracts.
References like “KPS Box 12, Folder 10” refer to Popper’s Nachlass in the Karl

Chapter 1
Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
Abstract We present Popper’s theory of deductive logic as exhibited in his articles
published between 1947 and 1949. After an introduction to Popper’s inferentialist
approach and his idea of “inferential definitions” of logical constants, we discuss in
more formal detail Popper’s general theory of the deducibility relation (which, using
Gentzen’s terminology, might be called his “structural” theory), as well as his special
theory of logical constants. We put special emphasis on his inferential notion of duality,
which includes his analysis of the “anti-conditional” (today called “co-implication”),
his systematic study of various forms of negation including classical, intuitionistic and
weaker negations, his system of bi-intuitionistic logic, and his theory of quantification
and identity. We also touch on his treatment of modal operators, which is based on
Carnap’s Meaning and Necessity.
Key words: Karl Popper, logic, inferentialism, logical constant, deducibility, nega-
tion, duality, co-implication, intuitionistic logic, bi-intuitionistic logic, quantification,
identity, modal operators
Karl Popper’s published articles most relevant for his inferentialist theory of logic
are listed in Table 1. These core papers are accompanied in our edition by a few
other papers on deductive logic published by Popper before and after them (cf.
Preface). We provide a commentary to these papers and also discuss some of the
objections raised by contemporary reviewers, who were quite prominent figures
in mathematical logic. Even though Popper’s articles appeared in well-accessible
journals and proceedings (Mind, Aristotelian Society, Royal Netherlands Academy
of Sciences, 10th International Congress of Philosophy) and were reviewed in the
standardperiodicals (ZentralblattfürMathematikundihre Grenzgebiete,Mathematical
Reviews, Journal of Symbolic Logic), a wider reception did not take place. One may
speculate about the reasons why the academic community ignored these papers, in
spite of the fact that their author was a well-known figure, although not in logic, but in
both philosophy of science (Logik der Forschung) and social and political philosophy
(The Open Society and Its Enemies). Why was it that the reviewers, or at least some

of them, who had read his papers in detail, did not see the promising features of
Popper’s approach, which should have been visible in spite of certain shortcomings
(often based on misunderstandings) that they rightly or wrongly criticized? Was it that
Popper’s bold claims – “new foundations”, “trivialization” etc. – made them sceptical?
Was it Popper’s proof-theoretic framework, which he considered sufficient to lay the
foundations for logic, independent of any additional sort of semantics? There were
exceptions. The proof-theorist Bernays saw the merits of such an approach, which
from today’s perspective we would call “inferentialist”,1 as did Brouwer, Kneale and
Quine (cf. § 2).
From a modern standpoint, where inferentialism and proof-theoretic semantics
have become respected foundational approaches, Popper’s views look quite advanced.
Perhaps Popper was, with his inferentialist perspective, too much ahead of his time,
and did not come back to his logical investigations, when in the spirit of a re-appraisal
of Gentzen’s work foundational proof-theoretic approaches started to flourish. Formal
logic is not what one normally associates with Popper, and there were so many
important debates in philosophy of science in the late 1960s in which Popper was
involved, such that contributing to the debate on the foundational role of proof theory
(Dummett, 1975; Kreisel, 1971; Prawitz, 1971) was way beyond his interests at that
time.
A particular role seems to have been played by Tarski, whom Popper admired,
but whose semantical approach was incompatible with the inferentialism Popper
put forward in his logical papers. Popper wrote in a letter of 9 July 1982 (this
volume, § 32.2): “I was discouraged at the time by the fact that Alfred Tarski, whom I
admire very much, did not want to have a look at these works. I had no one else”.2
1 He indeed planned to write a foundational paper on logic together with Popper, which unfortunately
did not materialize beyond initial stages (this volume, Chapter 14).
2 Tarski received reprints from Popper in December 1947, and it is most likely that these were
reprints of Popper (1947b,c,d). Apparently, Tarski was very busy at the time and just asked Woodger
in a letter of 16 December 1947 to pass to Popper his greetings: “I got a few reprints from Popper.
Would you please give him my best greetings when you see him?” (Mancosu, 2021, p. 94).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
3
With his inferentialist approach, Popper entered uncharted logical terrain. It can
well be imagined that in spite of the fact that his logical papers were written “with
much enthusiasm” (Popper, 1974b, p. 1095, this volume, Chapter 12, p. 217), he
felt somewhat insecure and preferred to leave a field in which he did not enjoy the
authority and reputation he had acquired in the philosophy of science.
In any case, Popper’s theory of deductive logic is worth reading and discussing, in
particular from our modern point of view. This theory brings with it a lot of conceptual
and technical insights which later became fundamental aspects of the foundational
debate, such as his anticipation of Prior’s operator tonk, the collapsing of intuitionistic
into classical negation in a combined system, the inferential notion of duality and the
notion of co-implication, the idea of dual-intuitionistic and bi-intuitionistic logic, the
formal theory of substitution, and many more.
This chapter is structured as follows. A general introduction (§ 1) presents the
fundamental ideas and concepts behind Popper’s approach, in particular his theory
of metalinguistic “inferential definitions” of logical constants. It proposes a reading
that relates these definitions to the introduction of function symbols in first-order
languages andtherebytries to justifyPopper’s viewofinferentialdefinitions as “explicit
definitions”. This reading characterizes Popper’s theory as a variant of inferentialism
which, however, puts no emphasis on the specific form of basic inference rules as
done in modern proof-theoretic semantics. § 2 discusses the reception of Popper’s
logical work, in particular the above mentioned reviews, and points to some critical
misunderstandings of Popper’s views. In § 3 we discuss Popper’s overall framework,
pointing to his insistence that the whole matter is a metalinguistic approach, where,
for the definition of logical constants, only restricted means – essentially positive
logic with propositional quantification – are permitted. § 4 presents Popper’s general
theory of deduction, which is the theory of “structural” rules (to use Gentzen’s
terminology) without taking into account the internal deductive form or power of
sentences. Popper’s two approaches to characterizing this structural foundation, called
“Basis I” and “Basis II” are discussed in detail. It becomes obvious that Popper’s
ignorance of the works of Hertz and Gentzen (Hertz, 1929a, Gentzen, 1935a,b; cf.
also Schroeder-Heister, 2002) makes it more complicated than it otherwise could
have been. In § 5 we discuss Popper’s special theory of deduction, that is, his theory
of logical constants and their inferential definability. Here we take up issues from § 1
and argue that this theory can be reconstructed in a consistent way. We discuss in
particular Popper’s inferential account of duality, which leads to his discussion of
co-implication (called “anti-conditional” by Popper). § 6 gives a systematic account of
Popper’s theory of negation; more precisely, of various forms of negation including the
classical and intuitionistic ones and their duals, as well as his development of a system
of dual-intuitionistic logic. His discovery that certain distinct operators collapse into a
single operator when combined within one system, the typical example being classical
and intuitionistic negation, is particularly emphasized. § 7 is a sketch of Popper’s
treatment of modal logic, which is in the spirit of Carnap’s Meaning and Necessity
(Carnap, 1947). Though it is interesting to see how it fits into Popper’s inferential
framework, it is a bit outdated given that modal logic has made such impressive
progress since Carnap’s pioneering book. § 8 points to Popper’s anticipation of

4
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
what today is called bi-intuitionistic logic and gives a full proof of the result, only
sketched by Popper, that intuitionistic negation and dual-intuitionistic negation can
be combined in one system without their collapsing into one single negation. Finally,
§ 9 reconstructs Popper’s account of quantifier logic based on a basic notion of
substitution which is characterized by a list of axioms and thus represents a kind of
theory of explicit substitution.
We heavily rely on our previous work on Popper’s logic which resulted in four
articles (Schroeder-Heister, 1984, 2006; Binder and Piecha, 2017, 2021), but deviate
in several respects from the interpretation given there. The reader may well skip this
chapter and study Popper’s contributions directly, the most general and readable being
“Logic without Assumptions” (Popper, 1947b), followed by “New Foundations for
Logic” (Popper, 1947c).
1 General introduction
1.1 Deducibility: From Tarskianism to inferentialism
In his papers of 1947–1949, which are the core of the present collection, Popper
claims to lay “new foundations for logic” (title of Popper, 1947c), which, at the same
time, represent a “trivialization of mathematical logic” (title of Popper, 1949a). By
“logic” he understands the theory of deducibility. His central notion is the deducibility
of a statement 𝑎from statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, written as 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎. By deducibility
he does not mean the derivability in a formal system, but the semantical notion of
logical consequence. For Popper, “𝑎is a consequence of 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛”, “𝑎follows
from 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛”, “𝑎is deducible from 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛” and even “𝑎is derivable from
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛” are metalinguistic expressions which are synonymous. Providing new
foundations for logic thus means developing a theory of deducibility or consequence
in a novel way.
There is already the Bolzano-Tarski approach to logical consequence. Popper was
well-acquainted with Tarski’s version of this approach. Tarski’s seminal paper on the
notion of logical consequence had appeared in 1936 (Tarski, 1936b), so it was still
“fresh” when Popper started working on logic.3 Moreover, Popper was an admirer of
Tarski throughout his lifetime, and it was Tarski’s theory of truth that led him to give
up his hesitation to use the concept of truth still prevailing in his Logik der Forschung
(Popper, 1935, § 84; cf. Popper, 1959b, § 84, fn *1 and Popper, 1974c, § 20).
Tarski’s notion of logical consequence is based on the idea of truth transmission:
𝑎follows logically from 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛if every interpretation which makes 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛
true, makes 𝑎true as well. As Tarski had pointed out, this definition hinges on
the definition of what a “logical constant” or “logical sign” is. An interpretation
that makes 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛true and carries this truth over to 𝑎, can give all non-logical
3 According to Popper’s letter to Forder of 7 May 1943 (this volume, § 26.4) Popper even assisted
Tarski in preparing the German version of this paper.

expressions in 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎an arbitrary meaning, but the meaning of the logical
signs must be kept fixed throughout. That, for example, 𝑎follows from 𝑎-or-𝑏and
not-𝑏, only depends on the meaning of “or” and “not”, which is fixed, and not on the
interpretation of “𝑎” or “𝑏”, which is variable.
Therefore, so one can argue, by providing a satisfying definition of what a
logical constant is, we obtain a satisfying theory of logical consequence and thus of
deducibility, given that the notion of truth itself is not problematic and is sufficiently
clarified by Tarski’s theory of truth. This situation is the systematic starting point of
Popper’s investigations (in particular of Popper, 1947c).
There are nevertheless certain consequence laws which are independent of logical
constants. These are the laws constituting a finite consequence relation in Tarski’s
sense. In a proof-theoretic setting, Gentzen (1935a,b) called them structural rules
(“Struktur-Schlussfiguren”), where “structural” means independent of the “logical”
form of the statements involved. Popper calls them “absolutely valid” since for
their validity we need only be able to distinguish sentences from non-sentences,
disregarding the internal structure of sentences. These rules and the various forms
they take in Popper’s theory will be discussed in further detail in § 4, especially in
§ 4.6. For our initial discussion it suffices to know that there is a core set of rules which
essentially comprises reflexivity, monotonicity and transitivity, as well as permutation
and contraction laws depending on whether the left side of a consequence claim is
considered a list, multiset or set:
1. 𝑎/𝑎.
2. If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎, then 𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎.
3. If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎and 𝑎, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏, then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏.
As the validity of these rules is unproblematic, we can assume that, whenever we are
dealing with deducibility, it is given as a consequence relation.4
In what follows, “sentence” and “statement” are used synonymously. “Statement”
is the term preferred by Popper. We do not use the term “proposition” since this
is often used in a semantic sense as denoting the meaning of a sentence. Popper
deals with syntactic entities throughout, although he emphasizes that the distinction
between syntactic statements and semantic propositions does not affect his theorizing
(cf. Popper, 1947b, fn 4, p. 261, this volume). His syntactic stance is quite natural, as
he is throughout working in a proof-theoretic setting.
In spite of this Tarskian motivation and starting point, the idea to define the
logicality of operations and thus logical consequence for complex statements leads
Popper to develop a conception entirely different from Tarski’s. This conception has
at least three central characteristics:
1. It is not assumed that a specified formal object language is given, in which
logical operations are represented by functional expressions (“sentential functions”)
which combine one or more sentences to a compound sentence (or, in the quantifier
case, operate on open sentences). A sentence 𝑐may be a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏
without having a special syntactic form such as 𝑎∧𝑏or 𝐾𝑎𝑏(depending on one’s
4 By that we always mean a finite consequence relation. Tarski’s (1936b) consideration of con-
sequences from an infinite number of assumptions goes beyond Popper’s finite proof-theoretic
framework. Insofar it is much more related to Gentzen (1935a,b) and Hertz (1929b).

logical notation). Tarski’s approach of truth transmission under preservation of logical
structure assumes that such a specification is given.
2. Logical operations are relationally and not functionally characterized. For
example, that 𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏is a three-place metalinguistic relation
which is formally defined in the following way:
𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
where Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) is a certain metalinguistic condition. This relational view can
leave open whether a logical operation, in our example conjunction, (1) always exists
and (2) is uniquely determined. Both features would have to be presupposed if one
preferred a functional characterization of logical operations as implicit in standard
logical notation. Tarski, in considering a structure based on logical constants, sticks
to a functional view from the very beginning.
3. The relational characterization of logical operations proceeds in terms of
deducibility. For Popper, results of logical operations (conjunctions, disjunctions,
implications, . . .) are characterized by their deductive or inferential behaviour. In the
above definition of conjunction, Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) describes characteristic inferences in-
volving conjunction in terms of /. There are various options for choosing Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
(cf. § 5.5 below), the most straightforward of which leads to the following relational
definition of conjunction:
(RelDef-conj)
𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and 𝑐/𝑎and 𝑐/𝑏
which means that Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) is “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and 𝑐/𝑎and 𝑐/𝑏”. Thus Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
formulates the standard introduction and elimination rules for conjunction in the
form of consequence statements. According to this definition, we call something
a conjunction if it obeys these introduction and elimination rules. For Tarski, the
deductive behaviour of conjunction would not be its definiens, but a consequence of
its non-deductive (e.g., truth-theoretic) characterization.
Note that we speak of the logical “operation” in contradistinction to the logical
“operator” of conjunction. The operator of conjunction is the logical connective that
has the form of a two-place sentential function like ∧, whereas the logical operation
of conjunction denotes the relation between 𝑎, 𝑏and one of its conjunctions 𝑐in the
sense of (RelDef-conj), independent of what 𝑐looks like. This terminology is not
perfect, as talking of an operation of “conjunction” might suggest that we are talking
of a function. However, in our sense, an operation is not necessarily deterministic,
(though in the case of conjunction it is5).
The third point turns the project of justifying deducibility upside down as compared
to Tarski. Since we rely on a notion of consequence in the relational definition of
logical operations, we can no longer use this notion of logical operation to define the
5 At least with respect to logical equivalence. In a language with a conjunction operator ∧, the
sentences 𝑎∧𝑏and (𝑎∧𝑏) ∧(𝑎∧𝑏) are two syntactically different conjunctions of 𝑎and 𝑏in the
sense of (RelDef-conj), but they are logically equivalent and thus have the same deductive power.

validity of consequences along Tarskian lines. In fact, such a definition of validity
in terms of truth transmission becomes obsolete, as deducibility must already be
available at the level of logical operations. Thus the notions of truth and truth
transmission do not play a role any more in the justification of logical inference. They
are discarded in favour of deducibility as a primitive notion. Logical rules are set
up and explained in an inferentialist framework without any recourse to truth. All
this makes Popper a logical inferentialist in the genuine sense of the term, which
was only much later coined by Brandom (1994, 2000). Actually, although Popper
does not use the term “inferentialism” to denote his orientation, he speaks of the
“inferential characterization” of expressions and, in the case of logical constants, of
their “inferential definitions”. So the term “inferential” is present, and even abundant,
in Popper’s logical writings.
At first glance this might be surprising, given that Popper is an outspoken realist
according to whom science is attempting to reach truth, and given that inferentialism is
normally associated with anti-realist and sometimes even instrumentalist approaches
to validity, something that Popper strongly opposes (cf. Popper, 2004). However,
on a closer, second look, the inferentialist approach fits very well with Popper’s
conjectural approach to scientific reasoning. Logic is not only a tool used in the
testing of theories, in particular in the attempt to falsify them, but is itself something
that is open to criticism. The great advantage of the inferentialist framework Popper
proposes is that it allows for the development of many alternative logics with a variety
of logical operations. In modern terminology, he is giving a logical framework, that
is, a framework for presenting logics. Within such a framework we can compare
and challenge systems of logic, also taking into account their applicability in the
empirical sciences. Viewed from this perspective, the inferentialist theory fits even
better into Popper’s conjecturalist approach than a monolithic theory of truth. Popper’s
inferentialist foundation of logic is not an approach justifying a certain logical system
as the right logic. For Popper, logical laws are always relative to given definitions, and
whether to pose a certain definition is not a matter of principle but a matter of whether
it serves one’s purposes. Thus Popper’s inferentialist approach allows one to check in
a perspicuous way what it means to base one’s reasoning on one or other system of
logic. His new foundations of logic is definitely not a foundationist approach in the
sense strongly criticized by him at various places (e.g., Popper, 2004, Introduction).
1.2 Logical relations
As relational characterizations of logical constants, Popper gives metalinguistic defi-
nitions of the following form (which the already mentioned definition (RelDef-conj)
of conjunction belongs to):
𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if . . .
𝑐is a disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if . . .
𝑐is an implication from 𝑎to 𝑏if and only if . . .

8
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
𝑐is a negation of 𝑎if and only if . . .
𝑐is a universal quantification of 𝑎with respect to 𝑥if and only if . . .
𝑐is an existential quantification of 𝑎with respect to 𝑥if and only if . . .
Besides such relational definitions for the standard operations, many more for
various classical and non-classical logical operations are given (details are discussed
below in §§ 5.5–5.7, § 6, § 7 and § 8). The relations defined we here call logical
relations. The defining conditions, above represented by dots (with Rconj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
being our example for conjunction), contain as their central notion deducibility /.
Here we call them “inferential conditions”. It is inferential properties described in
terms of deducibility that make an operation a logical operation. An operation is
logical if it can be relationally defined by an inferential condition. By means of these
logical relations, Popper is implicitly giving a criterion of logicality (cf. § 5.3 below).
A relation is logical if the definiens (the dots above) is a deducibility condition of a
certain form.
Now what does such an inferential condition look like syntactically? We are
dealing with a metalanguage which is not fully formalized. However, from the many
examples of relational definitions Popper discusses in his papers, it is fairly clear
what is intended (cf. § 3.3). The only “material” sign of the metalanguage occurring
in the defining condition of a logical relation is the deducibility operator /. For the
treatment of quantification, we need also a substitution operation. As metalinguistic
logical constants we use the constants of positive logic with propositional universal
quantification, where disjunction is employed only for the relational definition of
modal operations. Thus negation and existential quantification are not used, and
disjunction only in a special case. For example, if 𝑐is a disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏, an
inferential condition Rdisj(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) characterizing disjunction would be “for all 𝑑:
𝑐/𝑑if and only if 𝑎/𝑑and 𝑏/𝑑”, which at the metalinguistic level uses conjunction,
implication and propositional quantification. Therefore a relational definition of
disjunction would be the following:
(RelDef-disj)
𝑐is a disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if
for all 𝑑: 𝑐/𝑑if and only if 𝑎/𝑑and 𝑏/𝑑.
The operators used in the metalanguage are essentially those needed to describe
inference rules, namely universal propositional quantification to express the generality
of rules; conjunction to express that there may be more than one rule and that a rule
may have more than one premise; and implication to express the inference lines in
rules leading from consequence statements to consequence statements.
This does not mean that the metalanguage does not contain further means of
expression, such as negation or existential quantification. It only means that those
metalinguistic means which may occur in the defining condition of a logical operation
– the right side of its relational definition – are restricted. Popper does not give
a clear specification of these restrictions, but it is clear that what he has in mind
are restrictions in the spirit of inferentialism, and this is essentially a fragment of

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
9
positive logic. What this exactly means can only be concluded from the inferential
characterizations Popper is giving in his writings. There is never a negation occurring
in inferential conditions – their positivity is essential. Further means that do not seem
to be problematic at all, such as quantification over finite sets of sentences rather than
only sentences, are not considered by Popper. This led to considerable difficulties in
formulating some of his structural frameworks (cf. § 4.6 below).
As mentioned in the previous section, it is not presupposed at all that operators of
conjunction, disjunction etc. are available in the object language considered. This
means that sentential functions like ∧or ∨do not need to exist. In fact, as also
mentioned there, a conjunction or disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏need not be available at all,
whether expressed by a sentential function or not. It is easy to construct consequence
relations without there being conjunctions or disjunctions of given sentences (cf.
Koslow, 1992, p. 108f.). By the relational definitions of conjunction or disjunction,
(RelDef-conj) and (RelDef-disj), we are only characterizing a sentence 𝑐, whatever it
may look like, as a conjunction or disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏, provided it exists at all. We
are not expecting that we have a formal language with fully specified operators, which,
by its formation rules, would make sure that any 𝑎and 𝑏can be conjunctively and
disjunctively composed, and, by its inference rules, would make sure that introduction
and elimination rules for these connectives are assumed to hold.6
This makes it possible to consider logical relations that cannot exist in consistent
languages. Popper’s prominent example is the logical relation “𝑐is an opponent
of 𝑎” (opp), which is defined in such a way that the existence of opponents for
arbitrary sentences makes the underlying language inconsistent; that is, it allows for
the derivation of any consequence statement. He thus antedates the discussion about
Prior’s (1960) operator tonk. However, for Popper opp would be a logical operator, if
it existed (cf. § 5.2 below).
The relational view of logic – the definition of “𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏”,
“𝑐is a negation of 𝑎” etc. rather than the consideration of logical operators 𝑎∧𝑏,
¬𝑎from the very beginning – allows for a very general view on logical phenomena.
We are not confined to formal languages of a specific format, but can just study
arbitrary consequence relations and the availability of logical relations within these
consequence relations. If we further restrict the inferential conditions allowed in the
definiens of logical relations, we can single out logical relations of a specific kind.
We might, for example, consider inferential conditions which describe introduction
and elimination rules, or rules expressing that operators generate strongest or weakest
statements obeying certain rules. The latter approach is followed by Koslow (1992) in
his structural approach to logic, where arbitrary consequence relations and maximality
and minimality principles in the definientia of logical relations are studied. A concrete
logic with certain logical operators in an object language is then a kind of model of
this relational approach. In this theory we are considering logical relations in a very
general way, comparable to model theory dealing with the general structural features
6 We do not always thoroughly distinguish between a language and an (axiomatized or non-
axiomatized) theory within that language. That is, we often assume that with a language certain
inference rules are given as well. It will always be clear from the context, in which sense the term
“language” is being used.

of concrete theories. Schroeder-Heister (2006) proposed to interpret Popper’s theory
in this structuralist sense, reading it as a descriptive theory of consequence relations
structured by logical relations. However, even though this reading is a viable option,
it does not do full justice to Popper’s introduction of logical operators, which is a
crucial step beyond the relational definition of logical operations. While the latter can
be understood purely descriptively, the former cannot.
1.3 Logical operators and inferential definitions
For a foundation of logic, we need more than just a theory of consequence relations
and the definition of logical relations within such a theory. We want to introduce
logical operators as specific formal signs and to formulate valid rules governing these
signs.
It may well be, of course, that the language under consideration already contains
suchoperators,butthis is nota formalrequirement. Popper’s foundations forlogicapply
to any language with the only restriction that its deducibility notion is a consequence
relation. The main idea of Popper’s “new foundations” is that a consequence relation
is given, and that a logician, as the investigator of this consequence relation, extracts
a logical structure out of it by identifying sentences that might be considered results
of logical operations applied to other sentences. Once such operations have been
defined by the logical relations “is a conjunction of”, “is a disjunction of” etc., we
may, in a next step, introduce syntactical operators representing these operations. This
introduction of a syntactical operator is called an “inferential definition” by Popper.
This means that we must distinguish between a relation such as “is a conjunction
of” and an operator such as “∧” syntactically representing the relationally defined
operation of conjunction.7
While the relational definition of “𝑐is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏” leaves it open
whether, given 𝑎and 𝑏, there is a 𝑐at all, whether there is a single 𝑐or whether
there are multiple 𝑐’s, a logical operator (“logical constant”) must be unique. The
conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏is the result of a sentential function ∧generating from 𝑎
and 𝑏the compound expression 𝑎∧𝑏. As deducibility is our basic concept, by
uniqueness we mean uniqueness up to interdeducibility, written by Popper as “//”.
That we have uniqueness in the case of conjunction is clear from its relational
definition (RelDef-conj). It can easily be seen that if 𝑐and 𝑑are both conjunctions of
𝑎and 𝑏, then 𝑐and 𝑑are interdeducible: 𝑐//𝑑. The fact that for an operation to be
logical we do have uniqueness, must always follow from the relational definition of the
operation in question. There are operations which are not unique but nevertheless play
an important logical role, even though, strictly speaking, they cannot be represented
by (functional) operators. A prominent example is Johansson’s negation (cf. § 5.3 and
§ 6.4). There can be two non-equivalent Johansson-negations of the same sentence.
The second requirement to be able to talk of the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏is existence:
7 In these introductory remarks we only consider propositional operators; for the whole picture
including quantification cf. § 9 below.

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
11
there must be a 𝑐in the language considered which is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏in the
sense of the relational definition. We can, of course, postulate its existence by means
of formation rules which say that for every 𝑎and 𝑏the expression 𝑎∧𝑏belongs
to our language and by introduction and elimination rules for conjunction assumed
as (metalinguistic) axioms. We might call this way of proceeding the generation
of logical constants by postulation. This is certainly legitimate and also done by
Popper when constructing a logical language (cf. Popper, 1947c, beginning of § 4).
However, we must make sure that in this way we do not generate undesired results,
and in particular no inconsistency. This would actually happen in the case of the
opponent opp(𝑎) of 𝑎. If we postulated the availability of opp(𝑎) for every 𝑎with the
rules characteristic of opp, we would obtain a language which is inconsistent. This
would not be conceptually faulty in any sense. But it would, of course, mean that the
language constructed is of no use.
Popper is fully aware of this situation. According to his approach, we either
consider a language given by a consequence relation, in which uniquely determined
operations exist which can be relationally defined, or we construct such a language.
Whether the language is consistent is a highly important but different question, which
does not impair its character as a logical language.8,9
Now suppose we have a relational definition of a logical operation where exis-
tence and uniqueness are met. In the example of conjunction, we suppose we have
(RelDef-conj) with conjunctions existing and their uniqueness following from the
right side of (RelDef-conj). Defining an operator of conjunction means to define 𝑎∧𝑏
in such a way that the relation of being a conjunction is the graph of the function ∧.
Due to uniqueness, 𝑎∧𝑏can be viewed as a special term representing any conjunction
(mathematically, a representative of the equivalence class of all conjunctions). It is
introduced by Popper by postulating
(InfDef-conj)
𝑐//𝑎∧𝑏if and only if 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and 𝑐/𝑎and 𝑐/𝑏.
Metalinguistic statements of this kind are called “inferential definitions” by Popper,
as they uniquely define the deductive power of certain operators.
For a better understanding we consider the following parallel situation in first-
order logic. Here an analogue to inferential definitions is an axiom that would be
used to introduce a function sign into a first-order theory with identity, for example
8 Here it is important to remember that on the right side of a relational definition only positive
metalinguistic operators are allowed to occur. Otherwise we could construct conditions which
are metalinguistically inconsistent, as Lejewski (1974) has shown (misleadingly using them as a
counterargument against the Popperian approach); cf. § 5.2 below.
9 Although not discussed by Popper, one could discard the existence requirement by considering a
logical operator to be a partial function, which allows that for certain arguments the result of the
operation is not defined. For example, there might be an opponent of certain, but not of all sentences.
This would certainly result in an elegant theory, comparable to recursive function theory in which
not every partial recursive function need be total. The advantage of this partial approach would
be that we do not have to make sure that an operation must deliver a result for any argument. The
totality of this operation would then be something to be proved subsequently and not something to
be assumed in advance.

Peano arithmetic. Suppose there is a formula 𝜑(𝑦, 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) such that we can prove
existence of uniqueness for the leftmost argument:
∀𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛∃𝑦∀𝑧(𝑧= 𝑦↔𝜑(𝑧, 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)).
Then we can conservatively introduce a function symbol 𝑓by means of the axiom
(Ax-f)
∀𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛, 𝑧(𝑧= 𝑓(𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) ↔𝜑(𝑧, 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛)).
Conversely, if the theory in question contains already a function constant 𝑓for which
(Ax-f) is derivable, we may call 𝑓“explicitly definable” in the theory. It is therefore
not absurd to call the axiom (Ax-f) a “definition” of 𝑓, as it fixes the meaning of the
newly introduced constant 𝑓, even though it is not a fully explicit definition, which
would define 𝑓through a term 𝜏:
𝑓(𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) = 𝜏(𝑥1, . . . , 𝑥𝑛).
Correspondingly, it is perfectly legitimate that Popper speaks of expressions of
the form (InfDef-conj) as (inferential) definitions and even calls them “explicit
definitions”, even though they are not fully explicit definitions in the sense in which,
for example, conjunction 𝑎∧𝑏can be defined through the Sheffer stroke10:
𝑎∧𝑏↔(𝑎| 𝑏) | (𝑎| 𝑏).
As in the example from first-order logic, the operator introduced by an inferential
definition is eliminable from any context, if the inferential definition is assumed as
an axiom.11. Thus, formally, Popper’s inferential definitions are well-formed entities,
which makes them a precise conceptual tool. For a further discussion cf. § 5.2 below.
1.4 Logical laws and the trivialization of logic
Given inferential definitions of certain logical constants, we immediately obtain from
them basic laws for these constants, namely the right hand side of the inferential
definitions with the logically composed statement inserted for the leftmost variable.
From the inferential definition of conjunction we obtain Rconj(𝑎∧𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏), from
the one of disjunction Rdisj(𝑎∨𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) etc. And since these conditions uniquely
(up to interdeducibility) describe what is meant by conjunction, disjunction etc.,
they are exhaustive in the characterization of these connectives. This means that we
10 For Popper’s discussion of the Sheffer stroke under the term “alternative denial” cf. the handwritten
note Popper (n.d.[a]). Cf. also § 5.8.
11 This cannot be spelled out in detail here. A proof would proceed along the lines of the first-order
case, which is very closely related to the elimination of definite descriptions. For a semantical proof
cf. Mendelson (1997, § 2.9), for syntactic proofs Hilbert and Bernays (1968, § 8) and Kleene (1952,
§ 74). Another analogy is the handling of set terms in set-theoretic languages (which normally do
not contain explicit set terms as primitives).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
13
obtain all logical laws involving these connectives by taking Rconj(𝑎∧𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) and
Rdisj(𝑎∨𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) etc. as axioms or rules for the deducibility relation.
This makes sense only if Rconj(𝑎∧𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) and Rdisj(𝑎∨𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) etc. are formulated
in such a way that they can be read as axioms or rules governing deducibility. As
already mentioned above, this is always guaranteed for the inferential definitions
Popper presents, even though the expressive means of the metalanguage are not
formally specified. Thus a relational definition of a logical operation could always be
formulatedas: “. . . ifandonly ifthe following rules hold” ratherthan metalinguistically
circumscribing these rules. In the case of conjunction, rather than (InfDef-conj), we
would write:
𝑐//𝑎∧𝑏if and only if 𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏obey the following rules:
(InfDef-conj′)
𝑎
𝑏
𝑐
𝑐
𝑎
𝑐
𝑏
Substituting 𝑎∧𝑏for 𝑐, we immediately obtain that the following rules hold:
𝑎
𝑏
𝑎∧𝑏
𝑎∧𝑏
𝑎
𝑎∧𝑏
𝑏
which are inference rules fully characterizing conjunction.
More generally we can say that the universal form of an inferential definition of an
𝑛-place propositional operator 𝑆(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) is
(InfDef-S)
𝑐//𝑆(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) if and only if
𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛obey the rules R𝑆(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛).
By substituting 𝑆(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) for 𝑐we obtain the inference rules
R𝑆(𝑆(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛), 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
governing 𝑆. As this instantiation is immediate and yields inference rules in a
trivial way, Popper may speak of the trivialization of logic, namely the metalinguistic
deduction of valid inference rules immediately from a definition. One may consider
this terminology misleading and argue that the main conceptual work lies in the
formulation of the rules R𝑆(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) in the first place,and thus in the formulation
of the inferential definition of 𝑆. But this is a different matter. Given the inferential
definitions of logical constants in the form (InfDef-S) (for conjunction in the form
(InfDef-conj′)), obtaining their governing rules is trivial.
1.5 Popper and proof-theoretic semantics
We do not find any particular reflection in Popper what the basic rules for an operator
– the R𝑆(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) in (InfDef-S) – should look like. When reading Popper’s
discussions, one gets the impression that there is no preference whatsoever. The only

14
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
criterion seems to be that for a logical constant an inferential definition of whatever
form can be given. There does notseem to be any criterion to distinguishbetween better
and worse inferential conditions, provided the criteria of existence and uniqueness
are met. From this point of view Popper’s approach looks as if any kind of inferential
characterization of logical operators is possible, in particular a characterization by any
finite list of inference rules. This makes his inferentialism differ from proof-theoretic
semantics (Schroeder-Heister, 2018; Francez, 2015; Wansing, 2000; Piecha and
Schroeder-Heister, 2016), where one tries to directly justify specific inference rules
as meaning conveying, and as appropriate to provide epistemologically convincing
argument steps. To be sure, one finds all the rules considered in proof-theoretic
semantics also in Popper, such as introduction and elimination rules, sequent-style
right and left introduction rules etc. But Popper does not specifically argue in favour
of any of these presentations.
The fact that Popper does not consider consistency or conservativeness to be
an admissibility criterion when introducing logical operators confirms this view.
Whereas in proof-theoretic semantics great emphasis is put on conservativity and
on the fact that the introduction of new operators is non-creative, this is not an issue
in Popper. His consideration of opp as an example of a logical operator (and not as
a counterexample comparable to the discussion of tonk in modern proof-theoretic
semantics), or his observation that different negations collapse into classical negation,
if the latter is present, show that consistency and conservativeness are no big issues
for Popper. This also corresponds to the fact that Popper finds the distinction between
classical and intuitionistic logical systems very interesting without considering it to
be his task to argue for one of these systems against the other, or at least to provide
criteria along which to differentiate between alternative logical systems.
From the standpoint of proof-theoretic semantics, this looks more like delineating
logics than providing a semantics of logical signs. Schroeder-Heister (1984) actually
proposed to read Popper’s approach as a theory of logicality rather than a semantics
of logical constants, considering an inferential definition to be a logicality condition
for the operator in question rather than a semantic definition of its meaning. It is
certainly correct that Popper wants logicality determined that way (cf. § 5.2 below).
And, as just mentioned, for a genuine proof-theoretic semantics of logical operators a
more specific discussion of semantical rules should be required. However, reducing
Popper’s approach to a definition of logicality gives too little justice to the fact that
inferential definitions extract inferential content from consequence relations and
generate logical rules, beyond the pure fact that the operators involved are logical.12,13
Thus Popper definitely wants to give a semantics for the logical signs and not only
a criterion of their logicality. But this sort of semantics is only very rudimentarily
12 Cf. also the letter by Popper to Schroeder-Heister of 10 July 1982 (this volume, § 32.3): “[. . .] my
first goal was the characterization of formative signs. But then it seemed to me that, if one succeeds
with it, one can immediately justify [German: ‘begründen’] propositional logic; and somehow this is
possible, although it is a separate step.”.
13 This holds, by the way, also for other proof-theoretic definitions of logicality, which can be read as
semantical conditions, for example for Došen’s (1989) definition, from which inference rules both in
natural deduction-style and sequent-style format can be deduced.

15
and implicitly present in his writings. The most important point in this respect is that
after Gentzen he is the first to consider the format of the sequent calculus (with “/”
interpreted as the sequent arrow) for foundational considerations. With that comes the
aspect that his characterization of logical constants uses a strict separativity criterion,
which is inherent in the sequent calculus: namely, that for every constant there is a
separate set of rules which does not involve any other constant. This means that Popper
is not an inferentialist in the holistic sense that all inference rules taken together
somehow simultaneously determine the meaning of all operators involved in these
rules. Instead he puts great emphasis on the individual definability of logical operators
and on the investigation of how operators interact when they are available in the same
system, though defined independently.14 This is a great achievement two decades
before the philosophical considerations on the format of reasoning in the aftermath of
Gentzen’s systems took off the ground (e.g., in Prawitz, 1971). Furthermore, various
forms of criteria discussed in proof-theoretic semantics can be modelled in the
Popperian framework, such as Lorenzen’s (1955) and Prawitz’s (1965) inversion
principle (cf. Schroeder-Heister, 2007; de Campos Sanz and Piecha, 2009), Dummett’s
(1991) and Prawitz’s (2006) harmony requirements (cf. Schroeder-Heister, 2015,
2016; Tranchini, 2021), Sambin et al.’s (2000) “Basic Logic” (cf. Schroeder-Heister,
2013), Došen’s (1989) approach of double-line rules, Schroeder-Heister’s (1984) idea
of the common content of rule systems, Tennant’s (1978) maximality and minimality
principles and so on. Taking this together, one might say that Popper is a full-fledged
inferentialist and a rudimentary proof-theoretic semanticist.
In not insisting on a specific form of inferential conditions, that is, of the right hand
side of his inferential definitions, Popper is much more liberal in admitting semantical
rules than modern proof-theoretic semanticists. This re-emphasizes the view that, in
accordance with Popper’s general standpoint, the distinction of the proper logic is not
a matter of foundationist, but rather of consequential reasoning, which would take
into account all ends to be achieved and side conditions to be observed.
To summarize the overall philosophical structure of Popper’s way of proceeding:
We assume that a consequence relation is given, or we construct one by postulation.
By means of relational definitions we characterize logical operations which may be
available in this consequence relation. By means of inferential definitions we introduce
logical operators as names for these operations. Using logically structured sentences
thus introduced, we obtain the inference laws for these sentences immediately from
the inferential definitions.
2 The reception of Popper’s logical writings
Popper’s articles on logic were reviewed by Ackermann (1948, 1949a,b), Beth (1948),
Curry (1948a,b,c,d, 1949), Hasenjaeger (1949), Kleene (1948, 1949) and McKinsey
(1948). Kemeny (1957) and Nagel (1943) are reviews of the papers Popper (1955a)
14 Cf. § 6.3 below.

16
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
and Popper (1943), respectively, which accompany the key papers of our selection.
All reviews are reprinted in Chapter 13 of this volume.
Ackermann gives a summary of Popper’s views, which is in line with our interpre-
tation. Beth stresses the relationship to the works of Gentzen (1935a,b), Jaśkowski
(1934) and Ketonen (1945), without any further criticism. Curry in his five reviews
emphasizes the similarity to Hertz’s (1929b) and Gentzen’s (1935a,b) approaches
and points to the deficiencies of what Popper calls his “Basis II” of structural rules,
which we discuss in detail in § 4.6. He acknowledges Popper’s extensive treatment of
negations (discussed in § 6) including the collapsing result when classical negation is
present (cf. § 6.3). The final sentence of his last review (Curry, 1948d) summarizes
his critique: “The whole program is very obscure, and has not been without serious
error [. . .]; likewise it was anticipated, in many respects, by the work of Gentzen and
others.”
Hasenjaeger criticizes hidden existence assumptions in inferential definitions,
something that is also the main point of Kleene’s reviews. However, as shown above,
this view is misleading and in any case cannot be taken as a critique of Popper. There
are certainly existence assumptions: we cannot inferentially define an operator if
the corresponding relationally defined operation yields no result for the arguments
considered. But this is something of which Popper is well aware. Inferential definitions
are always made under the supposition that results of logical operations exist, to
which the inferential definition gives a name. This becomes absolutely clear from
our analogy drawn between inferential definitions and the introduction of function
symbols in a language with equality, which is a standard way of proceeding in
mathematical logic (cf. § 1.4).
McKinsey criticizes that the consequence sign “/”, which is introduced to denote
absolutely valid inferences, is extended to cover inferences involving logical constants.
As is also the case with Kleene, he misses the fact that Popper’s metalinguistic
theory applies to the established deductive practice in an object language which is
not normally specified formally and employs from the very beginning conjunctions,
disjunctions etc. in the sense of his relational definitions. This does not exclude, as
a limiting case, that the object language is formally structured. However, when we
define such a formal language, we do a creative job and must be prepared for unwanted
results that may show up, including inconsistencies; Popper does not ignore these
issues. A discussion of McKinsey’s criticism by Popper himself can be found in an
unpublished manuscript (cf. this volume, Chapter 17, Typescript 1, § 3, footnote 8).
An important point in several reviews is the emphasis that Gentzen’s work (and also
the related work of Hertz, 1929b, Jaśkowski, 1934 and Ketonen, 1945), in particular
his sequent calculus, is highly relevant to Popper’s undertakings. As pointed out in
§ 4.6, it can be asked whether or not Popper was aware of Hertz’s and Gentzen’s work
when he developed his theory.
Bernays, Brouwer, Kneale and Quine responded quite positively, as their corre-
spondence with Popper shows (cf. Chapters 21, 22, 29 and 30). Bernays planned to
write a foundational paper on logic together with Popper, which unfortunately did
not materialize beyond initial stages (this volume, Chapter 14). Brouwer presented

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
17
several of Popper’s papers to the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences.15 For
Kneale, Popper’s formulation of logical rules became a key ingredient of his theory
of logicality (cf. Kneale, 1956 and also Kneale and Kneale, 1962, § IX), which itself
provides a background to later proof-theoretic approaches to logical constants (cf.,
e.g., Hacking, 1979 and Došen, 1989). Detailed investigations of Popper’s theory are
given in the articles of Lejewski (1974) in the Schilpp volume on Popper (cf. Schilpp,
1974)16; Schroeder-Heister (1984, 2006) and Binder and Piecha (2017, 2021), which
were already mentioned above; Bar-Am (2009), which discusses a distinction between
the notions of sound inference and proof; and Moriconi (2019), which provides a
detailed overview and elucidates in particular Popper’s treatment of negation and
implication by making use of a sequent calculus setting. There are some unpublished
theses dealing with Popper’s logic, of which we know Cohen (1953b), Brooke-Wavell
(1958) and Dunn (1963). Here we just sketch Cohen’s thesis, as for systematic reasons
it is the most interesting one.
Cohen’s (1953b) Oxford B.Litt. thesis is highly relevant to matters discussed below
in § 5.4 and § 6.2. Its second part concerns the development of a system of dual-
intuitionistic logic.17 Cohen starts from Gentzen’s observation that intuitionistic logic
can be obtained from the sequent calculus for classical logic by restricting the number
of formulas occurring in the succedent of sequents to at most one. He then formulates
a sequent calculus where the number of formulas occurring in the antecedent of
sequents is restricted to at most one (without restricting succedents), which he calls
the “dualintuitionistic restricted predicate calculus GL2”. The idea of developing this
system was suggested to him by Popper.18 The inception of dual-intuitionistic logic
can thus be attributed to Popper, and Cohen was the first to develop and investigate a
system of dual-intuitionistic logic. Cohen’s sequent calculus GL2 is, however, not
exactly dual to intuitionistic logic, since it contains rules for both the anti-conditional
and the conditional.19
15 These are Popper (1947d), communicated at the meeting of 25 October 1947, and Popper (1948a,c),
both communicated at the meeting of 29 November 1947.
16 Popper’s (1974b) reply to Lejewski is reprinted in Chapter 12 of this volume.
17 Popper (2004, fn 8, p. 431f.) cites this system as an answer to his question “whether we can
construct a system of logic in which contradictory statements do not entail every statement.” However,
“[i]n [Popper’s] opinion, such a system [which lacks e.g. modus ponens] is of no use for drawing
inferences.”
18 As remarked by Cohen (1953b, p. 188). Popper (2004, fn 8, p. 431f.) first refers to his (1948a;
1948c), and then mentions that “[. . .] Cohen has developed the system [of dual-intuitionistic logic]
in some detail.” In fact, Cohen also gave a full analysis of this system, including a proof of cut
elimination. Popper (ibid.) has “a simple interpretation of this calculus. All the statements may
be taken to be modal statements asserting possibility.” This interpretation can already be found
in a letter from Popper to Cohen of 28 July 1953 (this volume, § 25.7), where he interprets every
statement 𝑎as “𝑎is possible” or, equivalently, as “𝑎is satisfiable”. In this letter Popper says that he
“consider[s] publishing these results”, without, however, doing so. Cohen (1953b, p. 208f.) names
Popper’s (1948a, p. 181) interpretation of sequents in terms of relative demonstrability (cf. § 4.4) as
the most suitable one.
19 Cohen (1953b, part II, § 3) first formulates the system GL1, which includes the rules FS and FA
for the conditional. This system is then extended to his dualintuitionistic restricted predicate calculus

3 Popper’s structural framework
Popper considers an object language L together with a deducibility relation on L,
which today we would call a finite consequence relation in Tarski’s sense. As already
mentioned, Popper uses the terms “deducible”, “derivable”, “follows from” and “is
a consequence of” synonymously. Popper knew Tarski’s work very well. Whether
he knew any details of Hertz’s and Gentzen’s work, in particular of their structural
framework, or whether he was aware of it at all, is questionable, as mentioned above
and further discussed in § 4.6. The set of axioms characterizing a deducibility relation
is called a basis. Popper mainly uses two alternative bases, called Basis I and Basis II,
which also occur in different versions. We use a version of Basis I as the foundation
for the rest of this introduction.20
3.1 Object languages
In contradistinction to modern approaches that proceed by giving an alphabet of the
object language under consideration and either a grammar or inductive definition of
those expressions that are to be counted as terms and formulas, Popper’s approach
does not presuppose any knowledge about the form or syntactic structure of the object
language under consideration. Popper explicitly points to this difference; he gives a
sketch of the classical approach at the beginning of Popper (1949a). The idea that
logical analysis is not only applicable to formally specified languages is still present
later, in Popper (2004, addendum 5 from 1963), where he stresses this fact in the
context of discussing Tarski’s theory of truth:
It has often been said that Tarski’s theory of truth is applicable only to
formalized language systems. I do not believe that this is correct. Admittedly it
needs a language—an object-language—with a certain degree of artificiality;
and it needs a distinction between an object-language and a meta-language
[. . .] [N]ot every language which is subject to some stated rules, or based
on more or less clearly formulated rules [. . .] need be a fully formalized
language. The recognition of the existence of a whole range of more or less
artificial though not formalized languages seems to me a point of considerable
importance, and specially important for the philosophical evaluation of the
theory of truth.
His approach is indeed intended to be not only applicable to formally defined
languages but also to natural language. For example, the conjunction of two statements
𝑎and 𝑏of the object language need not have any particular syntactic form like “𝑎∧𝑏”
or “𝑎and 𝑏”.
GL2 by adding the rules GS and GA for the anti-conditional; cf. Cohen (1953b, part II, § 4). Cf.
Kapsner, Miller, and Dyckhoff (2014) and Kapsner (2014, p. 128, fn 6).
20 This version of Basis I can be found in Popper (1947c).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
19
[Forming the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏] is done, in English, by linking them
together with the help of the word “and”. But we need not suppose that any
such word exists: the link may be effected in very different ways; moreover,
the new statement need not even contain the old ones as recognizable separate
parts (or “components”). (Popper, 1947c, p. 205)
To make this point clearer, consider as an example the propositional language
containing only signs for negation (¬) and disjunction (∨) together with a calculus
in which all classically valid formulas of this restricted language are derivable. This
language nevertheless contains for any two formulas 𝜑and 𝜓a conjunction of 𝜑
and 𝜓. One such conjunction may be ¬(¬𝜑∨¬𝜓); but other variants are possible,
and there is in general no way to specify the canonical form of conjunction in that
language.
This does not preclude that an object language is formally specified in the common
way by inductive definitions. Popper himself considers such languages. However, it is
not required at all, and Popper considers any sort of language, formal or non-formal,
provided we know what it means that a sentence of the language follows from other
sentences.
We will write L for an object language and, following Popper, use small Latin
letters 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . (also with indices) as variables ranging over L. The members of an
object language are assumed to be statements (the Popperian term; we also speak
of “sentences”), so that it makes sense to say that some of them are deducible from
others. Popper (1947c, p. 204) calls them “expressions of which we might reasonably
say that they are true or that they are false”.21 We furthermore assume that any object
language considered is nonempty.
3.2 The concept of deducibility
Popper’s approach is based on the concept of deducibility (or “derivability”). It is
the only undefined notion as far as propositional logic (including modal logic) is
concerned. An operation of substitution is added for the treatment of first-order logic
(discussed below in § 9.1). Deducibility is a relation, written with the solidus /, that
ranges over the object language and holds between finitely many premises (including
the case of no premises) 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛and exactly one conclusion 𝑏. In /-notation,
Popper writes
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏
to express that the statement 𝑏can be deduced from the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. The
case 𝑛= 0, in which no premises occur, was not yet considered in Popper (1947c). It
was added later in Popper (1948a), where the so-called 𝐷-notation is introduced. In
21 He states explicitly (ibid.): “Nothing is presupposed of our 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . except that they are
statements, and our theory shows, thereby, that there exists a rudimentary theory of inference for any
language that contains statements, whatever their logical structure or lack of structure may be.”

20

this notation, 𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) stands for 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1, and the special case 𝐷(𝑎1)
corresponds to /𝑎1, meaning that 𝑎1 is deducible without premises.
The /-notation is introduced as a horizontal variant of the notation
𝑎1...
𝑎𝑛
𝑏
that is often used to state rules of inference like, for example,
If 𝐴, then 𝐵
𝐴
𝐵
which says that from the premise “If 𝐴, then 𝐵” together with the premise 𝐴the
conclusion 𝐵can be deduced (cf. Popper, 1947c, p. 194). The /-notation is also used
to express rules that lead from deducibility statements to deducibility statements, for
example, the rule called Thinning by Gentzen:
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑏
(ibid. p. 196).
In the context of deducibility neither the order of premises nor the multiplicity
of identical premises is relevant, since deducibility enjoys the following structural
properties, which we state as a lemma:
Lemma 3.1
1. Exchange of premises:
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏, then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖+1, 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.
2. Contraction of premises:
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏, then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.
These properties are consequences of Popper’s characterization of deducibility by his
Basis I.22 Premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛can thus be understood as a set {𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛}.
3.3 The metalanguage
When Popper defines logical operations inferentially, this is carried out in a meta-
language, whose basic relation is deducibility /, and not in a syntactically specified
object language. If we consider, for example, a two-place logical operation ◦, which
we call “connection” and which can stand for any operation such as conjunction
or implication, or mutatis mutandis for operations of other arities such as negation,
Popper relies on relational definitions of the form
22 Cf. also Popper (1947c).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
21
𝑐is a connection of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
and on inferential definitions of the form
𝑐//𝑎◦𝑏if and only if R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏).
As already mentioned above (cf. § 2), in most cases the defining condition R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
has the form of a rule, which is described in terms of deducibility /, metalinguistic
conjunction, metalinguistic implication and metalinguistic universal quantification.
Popper does not specify exactly the means of expression allowed in a defining
condition, but from all contexts it is clear that positive logic is sufficient.
To improve readability of metalinguistic expressions,we use the following symbolic
notation for it, which is similar to Popper’s:
Symbol
→
↔
&
Ô
(𝑎)
Meaning
if-then
if and only if
and
or
for all 𝑎
The universal quantifier (𝑎) ranges over statements 𝑎of the object language. Popper
notes that as long as one does not want to introduce modal connectives, one can do
without disjunction.23 Therefore, given the special status of disjunction (discussed
below in § 7) and the definability of equivalence in terms of conjunction and
implication, the fundamental logical operations used in the metalanguage to define
arbitrary logical operations of the object language are conjunction, implication and
universal quantification (over sentences). We have therefore omitted negation and
existential quantification from our list of symbols (though we use, of course, these
operations in our metalanguage, but in the usual informal way, not within the defining
condition of a logical operation).24
Due to the fact that only positive logic is permitted in the defining condition of an
operation, the existence of this operation can never imply that the metalanguage is
inconsistent. The trivial deducibility relation, which holds for all arguments, validates
any defining condition R and therefore falsifies the negation of it, which means that
not every metalinguistic statement is true. Trivialization of the object language does
not imply trivialization of the metalanguage. We state this as a lemma:
Lemma 3.2 In any nonempty object language with a trivial deducibility relation (i.e.,
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏holds for any 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏), every defining condition R for a logical
operation is satisfied.
23 Cf. Popper (1947d, p. 1216): “[. . .] it may be mentioned that the only logical rules needed in the
metalanguage (except where we treat modalities) are those of the positive part of the Hilbert–Bernays
calculus of propositions as far as they pertain to ‘if-then’, ‘if, and only if’, and to ‘and’ [. . .], and the
rules for identity. The rules for negation need not be assumed [. . .]; but we need rules for universal
quantification, especially the rule of specification [. . .].”
24 In his letter of 10 July 1982 to Schroeder-Heister (cf. this volume, § 32.3), Popper compares this
restriction of the metalinguistic means of expression to Hilbert’s programme: “[. . .] you will find
that the metalinguistic use of ∀and →needed for their full object-linguistic use is greatly restricted.
[. . .] Here is indeed something similar to Hilbert’s programme of finding a finite justification for a
non-finite calculus.”.

22
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
This will become relevant in the discussion of the logical constant opp later on (cf.
§ 5.2).25
For certain expressions of the metalanguage Popper uses a special vocabulary.
Statements of the form
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏
are also called absolute rules of derivation, and statements of the form
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑚/𝑑
and iterated versions thereof are also called conditional rules of derivation or just
rules of derivation. Note that rules of derivation are not rules in a calculus understood
as a proof system. Popper does not develop a calculus in this sense, and what he calls
rules of derivation are metalinguistically formulated statements about the deducibility
relation.26 However, due to their specific form they can be read as descriptions of
rules, as they tell us that from certain deducibility statements we may pass over to
another deducibility statement. Thus we follow Popper in using the term rule to speak
about such metalinguistic expressions. This means in particular that we will often
speak of R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) as “defining rules” instead of “defining conditions”, even if they
cannot be translated immediately into rules of some object language.
3.4 The characterization of deducibility by a basis
So far, the deducibility relation / has only been defined by saying that it ranges over
an object language L. The next step consists in providing what Popper calls a basis
for this relation.27
A basis is a complete and independent set of rules, formulated in the metalanguage,
that axiomatizes the deducibility relation /. Completeness is here defined with respect
to Popper’s notion of absolute validity, which is similar to the notion of validity
obtained by allowing only structural rules of inference.28 Popper’s idea seems to be
25 Another simple example is the metalinguistic statement “there exists 𝑎, such that ⊢𝑎&
∠
𝑎”,
where ⊢𝑎stands for the demonstrability of 𝑎and
∠
𝑎for the refutability of 𝑎(cf. § 4.2 and § 4.3).
This statement is also only true for object languages with a trivial deducibility relation, although it is
a satisfiable expression of the metalanguage.
26 Popper (1948c, p. 327) once uses the term “metalinguistic calculus”.
27 Popper (1947d) is an exception to this approach: the requirement to specify a basis for the
deducibility relation is dropped, and the burden of making sure that the logic has certain structural
properties is shifted to the definitions of the logical constants. For this reason he uses an extended
definition of conjunction, called basic definition (DB2), to ensure reflexivity and transitivity of / as
well as exchangeability of premises. Unfortunately, (DB2) corresponds to the defective Basis II of
Popper (1947c), and is therefore just as problematic (cf. § 4.6).
28 Popper gives his analysis of absolute validity in terms of so-called statement preserving interpre-
tations in Popper (1947b), where he writes about absolutely valid inferences (ibid, p. 274): “There
are inferences which are valid according to all our definitions, in spite of the fact that the logical
form of the statements involved is irrelevant.”

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
23
that even if we abstract away from any concrete logical system (containing a specific
set of logical constants) under consideration, we still have a rudimentary residuum of
deduction consisting of structural29 inferences, like the inference from a statement 𝑎
to the statement 𝑎.
Popper’s Basis I is given by a generalized reflexivity principle, called (Rg), together
with a generalized transitivity principle, called (Tg):30
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)
(Rg)


𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1



→(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(Tg)
The principle (Tg) is not a rule in the strict sense, but rather a schematic rule. This
means that (Tg) has, depending on the value of 𝑚, many rules as instances. There is
therefore no way to directly express the content of (Tg) by means of a single formula
of the metalanguage. This fact was very unsatisfactory for Popper. He searched for a
replacement of (Tg) that could be expressed directly in his metalanguage. We discuss
his proposals and their problems in § 4.6.
The fact that (Tg) is parametrized by a natural number actually applies not only to
the multiplicity of premises by 𝑚, but also to the multiplicity 𝑛of sentences on the left
side of / within both (Rg) and (Tg). This could have been overcome easily by adopting
a notation for finite sets of statements corresponding to contexts Γ, Δ etc. in Gentzen
sequents, where the multiplicity 𝑚of premises can be modelled by conjunctively
understood sets of sentences on the right hand side of /, as in the multiple premises the
left hand side of / is always the same. Obviously, Popper did not want to enlarge the
formalized part of his metalanguage by such additional means of expression, insisting
on the fact that deducibility / is the only primitive concept of the metalanguage
(for propositional logic). Instead of talking metalinguistically about finite sets of
formulas,Popperpreferred,underthe heading “Basis II”,to incorporate objectlinguistic
conjunction into his structural rules. Finite conjunctions yield, of course, a substitute
for talking about finite sets, and technically this has the effect of getting rid of the
parametrization of structural rules with natural numbers. Conceptually, this is not
unproblematic, as it blurs the distinction between the metalinguistic association of
sentences by means of a comma and their objectlinguistic association by means of a
conjunction operator.
29 Although Popper does not use the term “structural”.

4 The general theory of derivation
Popper’s general theory of derivation does not refer to any logical signs of the object
language. It studies properties of statements and relations on statements that can be
defined using only the deducibility relation. Examples of such properties are being
a theorem in the deducibility structure, that is, being a demonstrable statement, or
being a statement that is refutable.
We discuss the following properties and relations: mutual deducibility, comple-
mentarity, demonstrability, contradictoriness, refutability and relative demonstrability.
Our focus is on mutual deducibility and relative demonstrability. Relative demon-
strability in particular contains the notions of complementarity, demonstrability,
contradictoriness and refutability as special cases.
4.1 Mutual deducibility
The relation of mutual deducibility // is explicitly defined as follows:
(D//)
𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑎)
We also speak of “interdeducibility”. It is an equivalence relation, as one can see by
checking the rules of Basis I. Two mutually deducible statements 𝑎and 𝑏are said to
have the same logical force.31 The equivalence classes induced by // are thus logical
forces.
Popper (1947c, p. 203) also calls two mutually deducible statements logically
equivalent, and then calls (D//) the substitutivity principle for logical equivalence.
The following substitution lemma holds:
Lemma 4.1 If 𝑎and 𝑏are mutually deducible, then we may substitute 𝑏for 𝑎in
every deducibility relation, that is, the following two statements are true:
1. 𝑎//𝑏→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏).
2. 𝑎//𝑏→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑚/𝑐).
Proof (1) follows directly from (Tg), and (2) follows from (Tg) and Lemma 3.1. □
Popper also considers the following definition of //:32
(D//′)
𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑐↔𝑏/𝑐)
For this alternative definition we can prove the following lemma:
Lemma 4.2 In the presence of (Tg) and (Rg), (D//) is equivalent to (D//′).
Proof We have to show that (𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑎) ↔(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑐↔𝑏/𝑐) is true. The proof
from left to right uses (Tg), and the proof from right to left uses (Rg).

32 Cf. Popper (1947d, def. (DB1)) or Popper (1947b, def. (7.1)).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
25
According to (D//), 𝑎//𝑏means that 𝑎and 𝑏are interdeducible; according to (D//′)
it means that 𝑎and 𝑏have the same deductive content, that is, that their respective
sets of consequences are the same.
4.2 Complementarity and demonstrability
The notion of complementarity for statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, written ⊢𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, is
defined as follows:
(D ⊢1)
⊢𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛↔(𝑏)(𝑐)((𝑎1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑎𝑛/𝑐) →𝑏/𝑐)
For 𝑛= 1, we obtain the definition of a self-complementary or demonstrable statement,
written ⊢𝑎:
(D ⊢1′)
⊢𝑎↔(𝑏)(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑐→𝑏/𝑐)
Intuitively, what is expressed by the complementarity of the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛
is that at least one of them has to be true, that is, that taken together they exhaust
all possible states of affairs. This idea is captured by saying that if the statements
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are complementary, then any statement 𝑐that follows from each of the
statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛individually follows from any statement 𝑏. From (D ⊢1′) one
can thus obtain
⊢𝑎↔(𝑏)(𝑏/𝑎)
by instantiating 𝑐by 𝑎and by using basic rules. A demonstrable statement is thus a
statement that follows from any statement whatsoever.33
4.3 Contradictoriness and refutability
The notion of contradictoriness for statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, written
∠
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, is
defined as follows:
(D
∠
)
∠
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛↔(𝑏)(𝑐)((𝑏/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑏/𝑎𝑛) →𝑏/𝑐)
For 𝑛= 1, we get the notion of refutability of a statement 𝑎, written
∠
𝑎:
(D
∠
′)
∠
𝑎↔(𝑏)(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑎→𝑏/𝑐)
The intuition lying behind these notions is the following: a statement is refutable
if it is false no matter the state of affairs, and a sequence of statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛
is contradictory if its members cannot be true together. Contradictoriness of the

For the definition of complementarity cf. Popper (1948a, def. (D3.1)).

26
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is therefore defined by saying that any statement 𝑏that implies
each of the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛individually implies any statement 𝑐.34 From (D
∠
′)
one can thus obtain
∠
𝑎↔(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑐)
by substituting 𝑎for 𝑏and by using basic rules. This is the definition of a self-
contradictory statement, that is, of a refutable statement. From such a statement any
other statement follows.
4.4 Relative demonstrability
Complementarity and contradictoriness can be combined in one relation that holds
between statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛and 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚. This relation is called relative demon-
strability (or relative refutability), written 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚. One of the
definitions given by Popper is:35
(D ⊢2) 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔(𝑐)((𝑏1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑐) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
For reasons explained in § 4.5, we will use the following slightly modified definition
of relative demonstrability in the remainder of this paper:
Definition 4.3 Relative demonstrability 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚is defined by
(D ⊢3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔
(𝑐)(𝑑1) . . . (𝑑𝑘)((𝑏1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐) →
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐)
Note that in contradistinction to Popper’s (D ⊢2) the definiens in (D ⊢3) is now
formulated with context statements 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘for 0 ≤𝑘, which occur as additional
premises in each of the deducibility relations. Definition (D ⊢3) is thus more general
than (D ⊢2).
Lemma 4.4 The concept of relative demonstrability contains, as special cases, the
concepts of complementarity, demonstrability, contradictoriness and refutability.
Proof Let 𝑘= 0. For complementarity, let 𝑛= 0. For demonstrability, let 𝑛= 0 and
𝑚= 1. For contradictoriness, let 𝑚= 0. For refutability, let 𝑛= 1 and 𝑚= 0.
□
Lemma 4.5 For all 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏: 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏.
Proof For 𝑚= 1 in (D ⊢3) we have to show that (𝑐)(𝑑1) . . . (𝑑𝑘)(𝑏1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐→
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐) is equivalent to 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1. Let 𝑘= 0. Instantiating 𝑐

by 𝑏1 yields 𝑏1/𝑏1 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1, and by (Rg) we get 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1. Likewise
for the other direction.
□
This lemma allows us to replace / by ⊢in all formulas of the metalanguage. This
will be necessary further on to bring some of Popper’s definitions into a form that
makes them dualizable. Note that, conversely, ⊢can only be replaced by / if ⊢has
exactly one succedent 𝑏. For mutual deducibility we have 𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑎⊢𝑏& 𝑏⊢𝑎).
Lemma 4.6 The following structural rules hold for 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚:
1. Weakening on the left (LW) and weakening on the right (RW):
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎𝑛+1 ⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
(LW)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑏𝑚+1
(RW)
2. Exchange on the left (LE) and exchange on the right (RE):
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑖+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖+1, 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
(LE)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑗, 𝑏𝑗+1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑗+1, 𝑏𝑗, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
(RE)
3. Contraction on the left (LC) and contraction on the right (RC):
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑖, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
(LC)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑗, 𝑏𝑗, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑗, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
(RC)
4. If there are 𝑖, 𝑗(for 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛and 1 ≤𝑗≤𝑚) such that 𝑎𝑖= 𝑏𝑗, then
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.
Proof Consider the definiens of 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚:
(𝑐)(𝑑1) . . . (𝑑𝑘)((𝑏1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐) →
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐).
1. We can always strengthen the antecedent of the implication or weaken its
succedent. Left weakening of / follows from Basis I. We thus get (LW) by weak-
ening the succedent 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐to 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎𝑛+1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐. The
antecedent can be strengthened by adding the conjunct 𝑏𝑚+1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐, which
gives us (RW).
2. Exchange on the left (LE) is due to Lemma 3.1(1). Exchange on the right (RE)
follows from the commutativity of metalinguistic conjunction.
3. Contraction on the left (LC) is due to Lemma 3.1(2). Consider 𝑎, 𝑎/𝑏; by (Rg)
we have 𝑎/𝑎, and (Tg) yields 𝑎/𝑏. By replacing / by ⊢and subsequent applications
of weakening and exchange we obtain (LC). Contraction on the right (RC) follows
from the idempotence of metalinguistic conjunction.
4. For 𝑎𝑖= 𝑏𝑗we have 𝑎𝑖/𝑏𝑗by (Rg). Lemma 4.5 gives 𝑎𝑖⊢𝑏𝑗. By applications
of (LW), (RW), (LE) and (RE) we get 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.

Relative demonstrability 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚can be interpretedas derivability
ofthe disjunction of 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚from the conjunction of𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. This interpretation
is justifiedbythe factthatforobjectlanguages containing conjunction ∧anddisjunction
∨one can show the following:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔𝑎1 ∧. . . ∧𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1 ∨. . . ∨𝑏𝑚.
This is a consequence of Lemma 5.5, proved below. The concept of relative demon-
strability gives thus an interpretation of Gentzen’s (1935a; 1935b) sequents.36
4.5 Relative demonstrability and cut
Popper’s definition (D ⊢2) of relative demonstrability
(D ⊢2) 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔(𝑐)((𝑏1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑐) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
is not wholly satisfactory, since it does not allow to show that
(Cut)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐→
(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚)
holds for any object language.
Theorem 4.7 The rule (Cut) does not follow from (D ⊢2) and Basis I.
Proof We show this by means of a counterexample for the instance
(𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐& 𝑐, 𝑎⊢𝑏) →𝑎⊢𝑏.
The negation of this claim is metalinguistically equivalent to
(𝑑)((𝑏/𝑑& 𝑐/𝑑) →𝑎/𝑑) & 𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏& ¬(𝑎/𝑏).
Now consider an object language that contains only the three statements 𝑎, 𝑏and 𝑐.
Then this is equivalent (also using the rules (Rg) and (Tg) of the Basis I) to the
statement
(𝑐/𝑏→𝑎/𝑏) & (𝑏/𝑐→𝑎/𝑐) & 𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏& ¬(𝑎/𝑏).
The model under which the deducibility relation is only true for 𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏(and the
instances required by (Rg)) satisfies (Tg) and is the desired countermodel.
□
However, if one presupposes that the object language contains conjunction, dis-
junction and implication, then (Cut) can be shown to hold.

Theorem 4.8 In the presence of conjunction, disjunction and implication, (Cut) does
follow from (D ⊢2) and Basis I.
Proof In the presence of conjunction and disjunction, and in view of Lemma 5.5,
it is sufficient to show that (𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐& 𝑐, 𝑎⊢𝑏) →𝑎⊢𝑏holds, which is done as
follows:
1. From the instance 𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏of (Rg) and (C>) we get 𝑏⊢𝑎> 𝑏.
2. From the assumption 𝑐, 𝑎⊢𝑏and (C>) we get 𝑐⊢𝑎> 𝑏.
3. From the assumption 𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐and (D ⊢2) we then get 𝑎⊢𝑎> 𝑏.
4. From (C>) and (LC) we get 𝑎⊢𝑏.
□
Since we do not want to presuppose the existence of any specific logical constants in
objectlanguages,we use (D ⊢3) as a more generaldefinition ofrelative demonstrability,
which is formulated with additional context statements 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘(for 0 ≤𝑘)
occurring as additional premises in each of the deducibility relations in the definiens
(cf. § 4.4), which we reproduce here for easier reference:
(D ⊢3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔
(𝑐)(𝑑1) . . . (𝑑𝑘)((𝑏1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐) →
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐)
Given this definition, (Cut) follows from the rules of Basis I alone, without presup-
posing the existence of any logical constants.
Theorem 4.9 If relative demonstrability is defined by (D ⊢3) instead of (D ⊢2), then

(where 𝑒is the cut formula). We assume 𝐴and 𝐵, and have to show 𝐶. In order to
show 𝐶, we further assume 𝑏1, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐, and have to
show 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐.

(1),(2) and (3) togetherimply 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐,and by contracting
the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛we get 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘/𝑐.
□
A disadvantage of definition (D ⊢3) is that it is not an explicit definition. As in
Popper’s framework no mechanism is available to handle contexts consisting of finite
sets or of finite lists of statements, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚is defined through an
unspecified number 𝑘of context statements 𝑑1, . . . , 𝑑𝑘. The relation ⊢is thus not
eliminable in general. Nonetheless, it is always eliminable in a given logical argument,
because the number 𝑘can then be specified.
4.6 The development of Popper’s formulation of a basis
Popper presented several formulations to capture what he understands by a basis.
We trace this development following the order of his publications. Note, however,
that the exact order of Popper (1947b) and Popper (1947c) is not completely clear;
both reference the other as forthcoming and were probably written at around the
same time. We restrict ourselves again to propositional logic, and do not comment on
additional constraints regarding substitution that have to be made for the treatment of
quantification (cf. § 9).
There are two decisive points in this development. The first is the impasse that
Popper found himself in while trying to get rid of the generalized transitivity principle
(Tg), which led him to develop Basis II. But Curry (1948a, this volume, § 13.5)
showed that Basis II is not, contrary to what Popper claims, equivalent to Basis I.
We will point out Popper’s error and will show how it may be corrected. The second
decisive point was when Popper rediscovered a solution of how to replace (Tg) by
a simpler rule, something which had been done similarly before by Gentzen for a
system of Hertz.
In Popper (1947b) the notion of absolute validity is developed, which justifies the
rules of a basis:
There are inferences [. . .] which can be shown, on our definition of validity,
to be valid whatever the logical form of the statements involved. [. . .] We
shall say of these inferences that they are absolutely valid. (Ibid., p. 274)
The basis that he considers consists of the generalized reflexivity principle (Rg) and
the rule (Tg),37 which he claims, without giving a proof, to be complete with respect
to his notion of absolute validity:
It can be shown that all absolutely valid rules of inference [. . .] can be
reduced to two [namely (Rg) and (Tg)]. By “reduced”, I mean here: every
inference which is an observance of some of the rules in question can be
shown to be an observance of these two rules [. . .]. (Ibid., p. 277)
This claim is plausible,especially in view ofLejewski’s (1974) proofofthe equivalence
of Popper’s Basis I and the systems developed in Tarski (1930a,b, 1935b, 1936a).
37 Cf. § 3.4. In Popper (1947b) these rules are labeled (6.1g) and (6.2g), respectively.

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
31
In Popper (1947c) two different approaches to axiomatizing the deducibility
relation are developed, which are summed up ibid., p. 211. Approach I (developed
ibid., § 2) consists of one of several possible variants of rules equivalent to (Rg) and
(Tg). Approach II (developed ibid., § 3) takes a simpler transitivity principle than
(Tg) and postulates the availability of conjunction in the object language. These two
approaches are exemplified by Basis I and Basis II, respectively.
Popper considers each of the combinations (Tg) + (Rg), (Tg) + (2.1) + (2.2) + (2.3)
and (Tg) + (2.41) + (2.7) as a possible basis. The components are:
𝑎/𝑎
(2.1)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑏
(2.2)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏
(2.3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(for 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)
(Rg) = (2.4)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1
(2.41)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑏
(2.7)



→(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(Tg) = (2.5g)
The combination (Tg) + (Rg) is called Basis I by Popper.
All these combinations have the downside that they have to include the complicated
transitivity principle (Tg) instead of a simpler one. Popper considers the rule (Tg)
to be problematic and wants to get rid of it. He explains the exact problem later, in
Popper (1948a, p. 177, fn 6):
The objection against [(Tg)] is that it makes use of an unspecified number
of conjunctive components in its antecedent; this may be considered as
introducing a new metalinguistic concept – something like an infinite product.
This leads him to Approach II, which contains Basis II (cf. Popper, 1947c, § 3). It
is supposed to axiomatize the deducibility relation by using the simpler transitivity
principle (Te)
(Te) = (2.5e)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
and by additionally requiring that for any two statements 𝑎and 𝑏of the object language
L their conjunction 𝑎∧𝑏is also contained in L. Popper (1947c, p. 206) expresses
the motivating idea behind Basis II as follows:
But the main point of using conjunction is that it should permit us to link up
any number of statements into one. If it does this, then we can always replace
the 𝑚conclusions of 𝑚different inferences from the same premises by one
inference.
One problem with this approach is that in the absence of (Tg), the rules for

32
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
conjunction have to be sufficiently strengthened in order to work. Popper also noticed
this and proposed the following slightly tweaked rules for conjunction:38
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(Cg1)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐
(Cg2)
Basis II thus consists of (Rg), (Te), (Cg1), (Cg2) and the existence postulate for
conjunctions.
Popper uses these additional rules for conjunction to prove that (Tg) can be obtained
from Basis II. That his proof contains an error was pointed out by Curry (1948a), who
provided the following arithmetical counterexample: Let the object language consist
of the natural numbers. Let 𝑎∧𝑏be the minimum of 𝑎and 𝑏. Let 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏hold
if, and only if, min(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ≤𝑏+ 𝑛−1. Under this interpretation (Te), (Rg) and
(Cg) of Basis II are satisfied but the rule (Tg) of Basis I is not. To see this, let, in (Tg),
𝑛= 1, 𝑚= 2, 𝑎= 𝑏1 = 𝑏2 = 1 and 𝑐= 0. A different but analogous arithmetical
countermodel is given by Bernays in a letter to Popper of 12 May 1948 (cf. this
volume, § 21.7) by interpreting 𝑎∧𝑏as the maximum of 𝑎and 𝑏, and 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏
as 𝑎1 + . . . + 𝑎𝑛≥𝑏.
The crucial step in the proof that Basis I and Basis II are equivalent is to
show that (Tg) follows from the rules of Basis II. Popper’s attempted proof (ibid,
p. 210f.) proceeds as follows. He assumes 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖, for 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚, as well as
𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐, and has to show that 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐follows. He attempts to do this in
the following way:
1. From 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖(for all 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚) obtain 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ∧. . . ∧𝑏𝑚.
2. From 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐obtain 𝑏1 ∧. . . ∧𝑏𝑚/𝑐.
3. From 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ∧. . . ∧𝑏𝑚and 𝑏1 ∧. . . ∧𝑏𝑚/𝑐obtain 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
Step (1) can be proved by induction on 𝑚and iterated applications of (Cg2); Popper
gives this part of the proof explicitly. Step (3) is just an instance of his transitivity
principle (Te). It is therefore step (2) which must be responsible for the failure of
Popper’s attempted proof, and it is indeed this inference that fails to be satisfied by
Curry’s counterexample: if 𝑚= 3, 𝑏1 = 𝑏2 = 𝑏3 = 1 and 𝑐= 0, then 𝑏1 ∧. . . ∧𝑏𝑚/𝑐
does not follow from 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐; an analogous counterexample can be given for
Bernays’s arithmetical interpretation. This derivation would be possible if Popper’s
rule (3.4g), that is,
(3.4g)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑
were secondary to (i.e., derivable from) Basis II.39 However, both Curry’s and
Bernays’s interpretations invalidate (3.4g)40. Popper (1947c, p. 210) erroneously
thinks he has already proven (3.4g):
38 In Popper’s formulation, (Cg1) and (Cg2) appear as one rule (Cg), which is here split up into two
parts.
39 Cf. footnote 61 for Popper’s use of the term “secondary”.
40 Bernays explicitly mentions this point in his letter, and Popper explicitly acknowledges Bernays’s
critique of Basis II in his reply of 13 June 1948 (cf. § 21.8).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
33
But this situation changes completely if we drop the generalised transitivity
principle (Tg) and replace it by the simpler form (Te). In this case, all the
rules 3.1 to 3.5 and 3.1g to 3.4g still follow from 3.5g [= (Cg)]; but the
opposite is not the case.
If rule (3.4g) were indeed secondary to Basis II, then step (2) could be proved by a
simple induction on 𝑚. Basis II might therefore be salvageable if we added to the
rules (Cg1) and (Cg2) the rule (3.4g).41
Popper (1947d) starts with a characterization of “[t]he customary systems of
modern lower functional logic, such as Principia Mathematica, or the systems of
Hilbert–Ackermann, Hilbert–Bernays, or Heyting, etc.” (ibid., p. 1214). The fourth
point of this characterization is:
(d) Some further very general primitive rules of inference (such as some
principles stating that the inference relation is transitive and reflexive) which
do not refer to formative signs are assumed, either explicitly or, more often,
tacitly.
This corresponds to what Popper uses his basis for. But in this article he proposes to
also get rid of the basis:
The inferential definitions of the conjunction [. . .] can be reformulated in
such a way as to incorporate all the rules of inference mentioned. In this way,
we can get rid of even the few trivial primitive rules (d) which were left in
the previous approach; in other words, we obtain the whole formal structure
of logic from metalinguistic inferential definitions alone. (Ibid., p. 1215)
Popper provides the following inferential definition (DB2) for conjunction, which
contains (Cg), (Te), (2.1) and (2.2):
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1) . . . (𝑎𝑛)((𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐))
& (𝑏/𝑐→(𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐))
(DB2)
& (𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏/𝑐) & 𝑎1/𝑎1))
As this approach is based on the rules of Basis II, it suffers from the same problems.
Hence (Tg) does in general not hold for the deducibility relation.
In Popper (1948a) a new notation for the deducibility relation is introduced:
𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) stands for 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1, and Popper from now on explicitly
allows the number of premises to be 0, that is, he allows 𝐷(𝑎), which stands for /𝑎.
The new basis that Popper considers consists of the following two rules (translated
from 𝐷-notation into /-notation):
𝑎2/𝑎1 ↔𝑎2, 𝑎2/𝑎1
(BI. 1)
𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1 ↔(𝑎𝑛+1) . . . (𝑎𝑛+𝑟)(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑛+𝑟→
𝑎𝑛+𝑟−1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+1, 𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎2/𝑎𝑛+𝑟)
(BI. 2)
41 What is actually only needed of (3.4g) is the implication from right to left.

34
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
From these two rules Popper obtains (Rg) and the rules
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏
(1.44′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟/𝑏
(1.45′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(1.46′)
Popper then shows how to derive (Tg) from (1.44′), (1.45′) and (1.46′) by an
induction on the number 𝑚in (Tg). He thus achieves the replacement of (Tg) by a
rule which can, in contrast to (Tg), be stated in the metalanguage. He comments:
The problem of avoiding [(Tg)] was discussed, but not solved, in [Popper
(1947c)]. The lack of a solution led me there to construct Basis II, the need
for which, as it were, has now disappeared. (Popper, 1948a, p. 177, fn 6)
This result also allows him to modify the implementation of the programme of Popper
(1947d). Instead of using his definition (DB2), he can use this new formulation of
Basis I. He mentions this possibility in Popper (1948a, p. 177, fn 6).
Already Curry (1948c) pointed out that this part of the proof is similar to what
Gentzen (1932, esp. § 3) had shown, namely that the rule of “Syllogismus” of the
system of Hertz (1929b) can be replaced by his cut rule, while Popper showed that
his rule (Tg) can be replaced by the abovementioned rule (1.46′). The “Syllogismus”
rule is practically identical to Popper’s rule (Tg), and Gentzen’s cut rule is identical to
(1.46′). Gentzen’s and Popper’s proofs proceed in a very similar fashion. The question
is how much Popper knew of the systems of Hertz and Gentzen. Popper (1947c,
p. 204) remarks in a footnote that Bernays pointed him to the articles of Hertz (1923,
1931), and he mentions Gentzen (1935a,b) in order to compare his concept of relative
demonstrability with Gentzen’s sequent arrow. There are no further references to
either of these authors in Popper’s articles. In his autobiography, Popper (1974c, § 25)
writes about his logic work in New Zealand: “I invented for myself something now
called ‘natural deduction’”. Obviously, “natural deduction” is here understood not in
the specific sense of the calculus of natural deduction, but in a generic sense covering
Gentzen-style systems, in particular the sequent calculus.42 This remark suggests that
he had not been aware of Gentzen’s systems and their foundational significance until
the basic framework of his inferential logic was conceived.43
42 Popper’s (n.d.[b]) unpublished and undated handwritten notes entitled “Natural Deduction” and
“Natural Deduction with Sheffer Strokes” confirm that Popper used the term “natural deduction” in
this wider sense, which includes sequents formulated with relative demonstrability ⊢.
43 In Popper (1948a, fn 7) we find a discussion of Gentzen sequents in relation to his own turnstile
operation (which denotes relative demonstrability; cf. § 4.4). This footnote reads as a later comparison
of his own conception with others that had come to his attention after their completion. In a letter to
Paul Bernays of 22 December 1946 (this volume, § 21.1) he lists major papers of Hertz and the first
paper of Gentzen, which is a direct discussion of Hertz’s work, as items borrowed from Bernays,
which indicates that Popper received knowledge of the development from Hertz to Gentzen not
before 1947. However, Popper had always been aware of Gentzen’s consistency proofs for arithmetic,
as remarks in his correspondence with Forder show, but without any detailed knowledge of Gentzen’s
proofs, wrongly claiming that Tarski anticipated Gentzen’s proof (cf., e.g., this volume, § 26.2 and
§ 26.4). Popper’s unpublished notes on derivation and demonstration (cf. this volume, Chapter 18)

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
35
At the very end of Popper (1948a) a new Basis III is introduced. Popper takes two-
place deducibility (or “two-termed derivability”, as he says), that is, 𝑎/𝑏, characterized
by transitivity and reflexivity as a starting point, together with one of the two rules
(the second is here translated into /-notation)
𝑏/𝑎↔(𝑐)(𝑐/𝑏→𝑐/𝑎)
[BIII]
𝑏/𝑎↔(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑐→𝑏/𝑐)
(2.1)
and the following definition of relative demonstrability:
(D3.3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔
(𝑐)(𝑑)((𝑏1/𝑑& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑑) →((𝑐/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑐/𝑎𝑛) →𝑐/𝑑))
The resulting basis is equivalent to Basis I.
Popper (1949a), the last of Popper’s core articles on logic, does not contain a lot of
technical development but gives an overview of his general intentions instead. Popper
now seems to have adopted the approach with Basis III. He writes:
As the sole definiens of our definitions, the idea of deducibility or derivability
will be used. We can restrict ourselves to using deducibility from one premise.
We write “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” for “𝑎is deducible from 𝑏”. [. . .] We do not need, for
the derivation of mathematical logic, to assume more about deducibility than
that it is transitive and reflexive. [. . .] With the help of “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” it is easy
to define deducibility from 𝑛premises. (Ibid., p. 723)
He (ibid., p. 723) also considers to define a generalized deducibility relation
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚in terms of 𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) alone, with the intended meaning that if
each of the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is true, then at least one of the statements 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
must be true. This corresponds to relative demonstrability.
While most of the technical development in Popper’s articles is done using
Basis I, a tendency can be observed towards his using two-place deducibility 𝑎/𝑏
as the underlying concept, together with derivative 𝑛-place notions like relative
demonstrability that are defined in terms of two-place deducibility (which,incidentally,
is the approach followed by standard categorial logic as based on two-place arrows
𝑎→𝑏; cf. Lambek and Scott, 1986).
Approach II seems ill-chosen to us, even if the suggested corrections were to
be carried out. It requires conjunction in the object language in its formulation of
the basis, and it confounds structural properties of the deducibility relation with the
definition of a logical constant.
Our choice of (a version of) Basis I, on the other hand, allows us to stay as close as
possible to Popper’s technical development, which proceeds mostly by using Basis I
with 𝑛+ 1-place deducibility 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏. This choice also makes it possible to
refer to Gentzen’s system of natural deduction without discussing it in detail. Popper (1947c, § 8),
which partially overlaps with Chapter 18 of this volume, does not contain any reference to Gentzen.
In his preface to Stegmüller and von Kibéd (1984, p. VII), Stegmüller mentions that he first learned
of the existence of Gentzen’s theory of natural deduction through Popper in 1949.

36
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
avoid a certain awkwardness in the formulation of proofs, which is already present in
several proofs involving relative demonstrability; in order to show that some statement
involving relative demonstrability holds, one often has to unfold the definition of
relative demonstrability first, then work with the definiens, and finally reintroduce
relative demonstrability. Besides its conceptual superiority, Basis I has thus also
practical advantages.
5 The special theory of derivation
The general theory of derivation was purely structural (in Gentzen’s terminology)
and based solely on the deducibility of statements without regard for their individual
form and their individual deductive power. The subject of Popper’s special theory of
derivation are relations between statements, which are logically complex or have a
specific deductive power, and their components44, and deals with the logical laws
emerging therefrom. It is based on the relational definitions of logical operations and
the inferential definitions of logical operators.
5.1 Definitions of logical constants
As discussed in § 1.3, logical constants are characterized in terms of the role they
play with respect to the deducibility relation /. Such characterizations proceed by
what Popper calls inferential definitions. A sign of an object language L is a logical
constant if, and only if, it can be defined by an inferential definition.45 In Popper’s
terminology, logical constants are called formative signs, in contradistinction to what
he calls descriptive signs, such as “mountain” or “elderly disgruntled newspaper
reader”; cf. Popper (1947b, p. 257). According to Popper (1947b, p. 286), “inferential
definitions [. . .] are characterized by the fact that they define a formative sign by its
logical force which is defined, in turn, by a definition in terms of inference (i.e., of
‘/’).” Popper (1947c, p. 220) summarizes his inferential approach as follows:
The upshot of all these considerations is this: If we have an artificial model
language with signs for conjunction, the conditional . . . etc. (we have called
them “formative signs” of the language in question) then the meaning of these
formative signs can be exhaustively determined by the rules of inference in
which the signs occur; this fact is established by defining our definitions of
these formative signs explicitly in terms of rules of inference.
44 Note that “components” are not necessarily subsentences, but sentences that are deductively
related to the original sentence in a certain way, such as sentences 𝑎and 𝑏which are deductively
related to a conjunction 𝑐of 𝑎and 𝑏, even if 𝑐does not syntactically contain 𝑎and 𝑏. Cf. § 1.2
above.
45 Cf., e.g., Popper (1947b, p. 286).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
37
As before (cf. § 3.3) we use ◦as representing an arbitrary logical operation called
“connection” with R as its defining condition (“rule”), which is used in the relational
definition
𝑐is a connection of 𝑎and 𝑏if and only if R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏)
and the inferential definition
(D◦)
𝑐//𝑎◦𝑏↔R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏).
As already mentioned, R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) is an expression of the metalanguage containing as
relations the deducibility relation / as well as the defined relations ⊢and
∠
. In the
course of a logical argument, definitions of logical constants containing ⊢and
∠
can
always be replaced by definitions that contain only /.
The relational definition makes no special assumption about the object language
– it just singles out connections 𝑐of 𝑎and 𝑏if they are available in the object
language (otherwise there simply is no connection of 𝑎and 𝑏). The inferential
definition, however, requires existence and uniqueness, which means that it is based
on the presupposition that there is exactly one connection 𝑐of 𝑎and 𝑏in the object
language considered. Here “uniqueness requirement” and “exactly one” is understood
modulo interdeducibility. That is, there is a connection 𝑐of 𝑎and 𝑏and all other
connections 𝑐′ of 𝑎and 𝑏are interdeducible with 𝑐: 𝑐//𝑐′. Note that in any case,
every 𝑐′ interdeducible with a connection 𝑐of 𝑎and 𝑏is itself a connection of 𝑎
and 𝑏. This follows from the fact that according to the general theory of derivation,
we have substitutivity of interdeducibles (Lemma 4.1), which means that all our
inferential concepts and results are invariant with respect to interdeducibility. Popper
is fully aware of these existence and uniqueness requirements, which have not been
appreciated by some of his reviewers (cf. § 2)
As explained in § 1.3, (D◦) can be viewed as an explicit definition of a connective ◦,
and Popper is fully entitled to call it that way. (D◦) conservatively introduces into
a language a sign for a new operator ◦, which is eliminable following the standard
procedures used for the introduction and elimination of function symbols or definite
descriptions (cf. footnote 11 in § 1.3). It should be noted, however, that (D◦) is
a definition of a metalinguistic function which associates with any 𝑎and 𝑏their
connection 𝑎◦𝑏, which is unique up to interdeducibility, so 𝑎◦𝑏essentially denotes
an equivalence class of objectlinguistic sentences, none of which must have a special
form. However, once we have reached that stage, we can, of course, introduce into
our object language sentences of the form “𝑎◦𝑏”, where ◦is now an objectlinguistic
operator in the usual sense, and take it to be the objectlinguistic representative of
𝑎◦𝑏(understood metalinguistically). Viewed that way, (D◦) can be used to introduce
a logical operator into a suitable object language, provided the connection operation
as a relation between (not further specified) sentences is available.
In fact, we can even devise a formal object language in the usual way and lay down
the rules R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) for all 𝑎and 𝑏. In that case a connection 𝑎◦𝑏of 𝑎and 𝑏with
certain inferential properties always exists by stipulation. However, when proceeding
in that manner, we must be aware (and Popper is) that such a stipulation may have
undesired consequences up to the generation of inconsistencies. In any case, for (D◦)

to hold, we still must make sure that uniqueness is satisfied. If this is the case, we can
proceed with the rule
(C◦)
R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏)
as the characterizing rule (C◦),which corresponds to the definition (D◦). If uniqueness
is satisfied, (D◦) and (C◦) are obviously equivalent. So we will often work with (C◦)
rather than with (D◦), as it is easier to handle and as it incorporates the rules of
inference in which one is interested. Philosophically, however, it is the relationship
between (D◦) and (C◦), more precisely the derivation of (C◦) from (D◦), what
constitutes Popper’s “trivialization” of logic, that is the derivation of logical laws
from inferential definitions (cf. § 1.4).
5.2 Popper’s definitional criterion of logicality
The question we are facing now is what form characterizing rules like R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏)
might be allowed to take. Should certain rules be disallowed because their use in a
definition of form (D◦) does not in fact define a logical constant, or does any rule R
give rise to a definition of a logical constant?
For Popper any characterizing rule which is equivalent to an inferential definition
characterizes a logical constant. He calls such rules fully characterizing. We state this
as a definition:
Definition 5.1 A rule R characterizing an operation ◦is fully characterizing if, and
only if, it is equivalent to an inferential definition of ◦.46
In case that R is given in the form R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏), this means uniqueness of R for
its first argument. For Popper uniqueness is essential for any definition of a logical
constant.47 We state this as an immediate corollary of our definition.
Corollary 5.2 A rule of the form R(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) is fully characterizing if, and only
if
(R(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) & R(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)) →𝑎//𝑏.
In other words, if, and only if, a rule R characterizes a statement 𝑐up to mutual
deducibility, then R is fully characterizing 𝑐.
We distinguish between the definition and the corollary because not every characteriz-
ing rule has the form R(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) and can thus be used in a relational definition.
Only logical constants, which are fully characterized, are always definable by rules of
the form R(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛).
What about the existence requirement? The inferential definition (D◦) is a proper
definition only if, in addition to uniqueness, there exists a connection of 𝑎and 𝑏
46 Cf., e.g., Popper (1948c, § VI); this volume, Chapter 6, p. 187f.
47 Cf. Popper (1948c, p. 324).

in the object language considered, for which we define a name. We may, of course,
stipulate that there be a connection of 𝑎and 𝑏and even denote it by 𝑎◦𝑏, but this is
nothing an inferential definition can do by itself without becoming creative. Unique
connections must be there before we can single them out by means of an inferential
definition. This is a point Popper’s reviewers have strongly emphasized (cf. § 2), but
also a point of which Popper is aware.
Forcing an operation to exist in an object language can make the object language
inconsistent. However, if it is uniquely characterized, it is a logical constant. Popper
thus allows, for example, the following definition for “opponent” (opp), with its
characterizing rule:
𝑎//opp(𝑏) ↔(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑎& 𝑎/𝑐)
(Dopp)
(𝑐)(𝑏/opp(𝑏) & opp(𝑏)/𝑐)
(Copp)
This obviously trivializes any system, since it implies (𝑐)(𝑏/𝑐) for any 𝑏. But this
does not lead Popper to reject (Dopp) as a definition. In a system, where opp exists
(thus an inconsistent system), it is a logical constant because it is unique for trivial
reasons.48 Historically, it is interesting to note that the connective opp is quite similar
to the connective tonk, which was later introduced into the philosophical discussion
by Prior49, there with the intention to discredit inferentialism.
Lejewski (1974, p. 644) considers an even stronger version of opp, called opp∗.
This supposed logical constant not only turns the object language inconsistent but
also the metalanguage. Its definition and characterizing rule is supposed to be:
𝑎//opp∗(𝑏) ↔(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑎& 𝑏/𝑐)
(Dopp∗)
(𝑐)(𝑏/opp∗(𝑏) & 𝑏/𝑐)
(Copp∗)
The definition (Dopp∗) is formulated using metalinguistic negation (
). This
contrasts with all definitions considered by Popper, who never uses negation in his
metalinguistic definitions of logical constants. So while it is true that the definition of
opp∗would turn any metalanguage inconsistent in which it is stated and where opp∗
is forced to exist, this criticism cannot be applied to the system of Popper. Relying on
positive logic within defining conditions, which is mandatory (cf. § 3.3), in view of
Lemma 3.2 there can be no such characterization.50
48 Cf. Popper (1947b, p. 284): “We need not make sure, in any other way, that our system of definitions
is consistent. For example, we may define (introducing an arbitrarily chosen name ‘opponent’): [see
(Dopp)]. This definition has the consequence that every language which has a sign for ‘opponent of
𝑏’ [. . .] will be inconsistent [. . .]. But this need not lead us to abandon [(Dopp)]; it only means that
no consistent language will have a sign for ‘opponent of 𝑏’.”
49 Prior (1960) cites Popper (1947b), but only for giving an example of what he understands by
an analytically valid inference. He does not mention the fact that Popper (1947b) discusses the
tonk-like connective opp. Neither Belnap (1962) nor Stevenson (1961) noticed this in their responses
to Prior’s article, even though they both also explicitly mention Popper’s article. It is noted, however,
by Merrill (1962).
50 For an extensive discussion of Popper’s criterion of logicality cf. also Schroeder-Heister (1984,
2006).

40
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
Another question concerning the form of definitions of logical constants is the
following: For two given alternative rules R and R′, which are equivalent, is one
preferable over the other in defining a logical constant? Popper often considers more
than one possible definition of a logical constant, showing (or in some cases only
indicating) that these alternative definitions are equivalent. There seems to be no
logical or philosophical criterion that makes Popper prefer one definition rather than
another, equivalent definition. Often, it seems, he just chooses the brevity of some
definition, or the ease with which he is able to explain it.
This contrasts with more modern approaches concerning definitions of logical
constants. Especially in proof-theoretic semantics as initiated by Gentzen, Prawitz
and Dummett there is a strong sense of preferring one special kind of rules (either
introduction rules or elimination rules) as being constitutive of the meaning of logical
constants. Such considerations play no part in Popper’s definitions. For example,
Popper’s (1947c, p. 228) definition of the universal quantifier resembles its elimination
rule, while his definition of the existential quantifier resembles its introduction rule.
For a further discussion cf. § 1.5.
However, the fact that Popper does not explicitly give a philosophical criterion
for preferring one form of definition over another does not preclude the possibility
that he has a logical one. In the more mature version of his theory presented in
Popper (1948a,c), he sometimes states definitions of logical constants in a form that
highlights the duality of certain of his definitions. We will follow this lead and give
the definitions in a way that allows for the formulation of a duality function that
transforms any definition of a logical constant into a definition of a dual logical
constant.
5.3 Not-strictly-logical operations and the understanding of logical
notation
It is the existence of fully characterizing rules that distinguishes logical constants
from non-logical constants, and it is this criterion of logicality that leads Popper
to reject, for example, Johansson’s negation as a logical constant (cf. § 6.4).51 As
characterizing rule R 𝑗for this negation Popper gives the following:
𝑎, 𝑏⊢¬j 𝑐→𝑎, 𝑐⊢¬j 𝑏.
This actually characterizes a negation weaker than Johansson’s. For example, the rule
𝑎, 𝑐⊢¬j 𝑐→𝑎⊢¬j 𝑐
51 In contradistinction to more modern terminology, for Popper “Johansson’s negation” and “minimal
negation” are different items, the latter denoting dual-intuitionistic negation. We will follow this
terminology and refrain from designating Johansson’s negation as “minimal”.

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
41
which is valid in Johansson’s system, is not derivable from it. Therefore, we here
speak of “𝑗-negation” rather than “Johansson’s negation” (though our argumentation
holds for Johansson’s negation as well). It can be shown that the characterizing rule
R 𝑗is not fully characterizing (cf. Theorem 6.12), that is, it is not equivalent to an
inferential definition.
Even though it cannot be inferentially defined, we nevertheless want to talk about 𝑗-
negation and its laws in a symbolic way. We want, for example, to say that 𝑎, ¬j 𝑎/¬j 𝑐
holds for any 𝑐and that 𝑎, ¬j 𝑎/𝑐does not hold for all 𝑐. By that we mean that from
the characterizing rule R 𝑗we can infer these claims. However, how can the notation
“¬j 𝑎” be understood if there cannot be an inferential definition of ¬j?
Consider an object language, in which for every sentence 𝑎there is at least one
𝑗-negation of 𝑎. Consider the law
𝑎, ¬j 𝑎/¬j 𝑐.
It can plausibly be read as follows: Suppose we have a fixed selection function (in
short: “selection”) which chooses, for every sentence 𝑎, one of the 𝑗-negations of 𝑎.
Let ¬j denote this selected 𝑗-negation of 𝑎. Then this law holds for the given selection
of 𝑗-negations. In fact, this law not only holds for a specific selection, but for any
selection.
Generalizing this idea means that laws for not-fully-characterizable operations
are interpreted with respect to certain selections, and that such a law is valid, if
it holds for any selection. This interpretation can be used even for unique (fully
characterized) operations such as classical negation ¬k, with the only difference that
there is only one possible selection (up to interdeducibility), which means that, when
we (metalinguistically) define the validity of an inference, we need not quantify over
selections. For example
𝑎, ¬k 𝑎/¬k 𝑐
is valid as it holds for the unique selection of classical negations, namely for the
classical negation of 𝑎and the classical negation of 𝑐, whereas
𝑎, ¬j 𝑎/¬j 𝑐
is valid as it holds for every selection of 𝑗-negations of 𝑎and of 𝑐.
Elaborating on this idea, something that cannot be done here, we propose to read
a connection 𝑎◦𝑏, be it unique or not, as an 𝜖-term as used in the epsilon calculus of
Hilbert and Bernays (1939), that is, 𝑎◦𝑏is understood as 𝜖𝑐R(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏). This means
that 𝑎◦𝑏just selects one element from the connections of 𝑎and 𝑏. We do not have
the problem of non-denoting terms, as with logical operations we always assume
that they generate a result, even if this is by stipulation. As the availability of a
connection for any two statements 𝑎and 𝑏is guaranteed, the use of 𝑎◦𝑏and the
instantiation of universally quantified formulas of the metalanguage with terms of
the form 𝑎◦𝑏is no longer problematic. Reading 𝑎◦𝑏as an 𝜖-term also makes the
existential presupposition explicit in cases where 𝑎◦𝑏is the result of an instantiation
of a universal quantifier of the metalanguage. If a connection is unique, that is, if ◦is

42
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
a logical constant, then we have a definite description as a limiting case of the epsilon
operator.52
Our discussion serves as a philosophical explication of Popper’s idea that we can
define a unique logical operation ◦by an inferential definition and a corresponding
full characterization R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏), and non-unique logical operations ◦or ¬j by
characterizations R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) or R 𝑗without there being an inferential definition.
For the following more technical discussions and results this philosophical distinction
does not matter very much: we can just start from the rule R(𝑎◦𝑏, 𝑎, 𝑏) as a
characterization of ◦, or from R 𝑗as a characterization of ¬j, be it unique (fully
characterizing) or not. Uniqueness and many other metalogical features are then
possible results of our investigations.
This interpretation gives a clearunderstanding ofwhatis meantwhen throughouthis
articles Popper uses notations like 𝑎∧𝑏, 𝑎∨𝑏and 𝑎> 𝑏to speak about conjunctions,
disjunctions and implications, respectively, as well as various negation signs to speak
about certain uniquely-characterized and certain not-fully-characterizable negations
of some object language L. It can also be used to rectify certain objections by
reviewers of Popper’s papers, notably Kleene (1948), and by later commentators such
as Lejewski (1974, §§ 5–6) and Schroeder-Heister (2006, § 3.1); cf. § 2.
5.4 Popper’s notion of duality
Although Popper makes frequent use of duality,53 he nowhere gives an explanation of
his notion of duality. We think such an explanation is needed, since Popper does not
only discuss duality in the context of classical logic, where the well-known duality
based on truth functions can be applied, but also in the context of non-classical logics
such as intuitionistic logic, where a different notion of duality is called for.
We propose to understand his notion of duality as being based on his concept
of relative demonstrability (⊢). More precisely, an inferential definition is said to
be dual to another inferential definition, if it results from exchanging all statements
on the left side of ⊢with the statements on its right side, that is, by transforming
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚into 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚⊢𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.54 Note that it is in general
not possible to invert the direction of the sign of derivability (/), for it allows multiple
statements on the left but only a single statement on the right (for alternative versions
cf. § 4.6). As already mentioned in § 4.1, the replacement of / by ⊢is allowed.
One can therefore formulate definitions of logical constants in terms of relative
demonstrability instead of deducibility. This allows us to make the duality of logical
52 This is more complicated in a case like 𝑗-negation, where R 𝑗does not have the form R 𝑗(¬j 𝑎, 𝑎),
that is, where we do not have a relational definition in the strict sense. One would have to say that
¬j 𝑎selects one of the 𝑗-negation-functions satisfying R 𝑗and applies it to 𝑎.
53 He speaks of “the dual of”, “dual rules”, “dual definitions” etc.
54 Cf. Kapsner (2014, p. 76), who also mentions this possibility. There is, however, a difference
between the semantical concept |= that Kapsner considers and Popper’s defined concept ⊢.

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
43
constants obvious.55 In the case of binary connectives we have to swap the arguments
to produce its dual.56 We make this understanding of the notion of duality precise by
using a duality function, defined as follows:
Definition 5.3 Let ★be a unary connective and ◦a binary connective. The duality
function 𝛿is defined by the following clauses, where Γ and Π are lists of statements,
and Γ𝛿(resp. Π 𝛿) is the application of 𝛿to each member of Γ (resp. Π):
𝑎𝛿=df 𝑎, for non-compound statements 𝑎;
(★𝑎) 𝛿=df ★𝛿𝑎𝛿;
(𝑎◦𝑏) 𝛿=df 𝑏𝛿◦𝛿𝑎𝛿;
(Γ ⊢Π) 𝛿=df Π 𝛿⊢Γ𝛿.
There are no clauses for / and //. This does not restrict the range of applicability of
𝛿, since / can always be replaced by ⊢(cf. Lemma 4.5). In the following we show
that the function 𝛿maps definitions of logical constants to definitions of what Popper
considers to be their duals. We do this for conjunction and disjunction, conditional
and anti-conditional, and for modal connectives.
5.5 Conjunction and disjunction
As was already mentioned, Popper gives several characterizing rules for conjunction
(∧). We choose the following definition:
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑎⊢𝑑↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑)
(D∧)
𝑏∧𝑐⊢𝑑↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑
(C∧)
If we apply our duality function 𝛿to the characterizing rule (C∧), we obtain:
(C∧) 𝛿
𝑑⊢𝑐∧𝛿𝑏↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐
which is equivalent to Popper’s definition of disjunction (∨):57
55 To our knowledge, Popper mentions this duality based on relative demonstrability only once, in
Popper (1948a, p. 181): “For certain purposes – especially if we wish to emphasize the duality or
symmetry between ‘⊢’ and ‘
∠
’ – the use of ‘(. . .) ⊢’ turns out to be preferable to that of ‘
∠
(. . .)’.”
56 Our definition of duality resembles Cohen’s (1953b, p. 82): “We define the dual of a postulate
of any Gentzen-type system as the result of writing each sequent 𝑝1, . . . , 𝑝𝑚⊩𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑛as
𝑞𝑛, 𝑞𝑛−1, . . . , 𝑞1 ⊩𝑝𝑚, 𝑝𝑚−1, . . . , 𝑝1, of interchanging 𝐾𝑝𝑞with 𝐴𝑞𝑝(hence also inter-
changing 𝐴𝑝𝑞with 𝐾𝑞𝑝), of interchanging 𝐹𝑝𝑞with 𝐺𝑞𝑝(hence also interchanging 𝐺𝑝𝑞
with 𝐹𝑞𝑝) [. . .], and of reversing the order of premises whenever the postulate is a rule of inference
having two premises.” Here 𝐾stands for conjunction, 𝐴for disjunction (“alternative”), 𝐹for the
conditional, and 𝐺for the anti-conditional.
57 Our definitions (D∧) and (D∨) correspond to Popper’s (1948a) rules (3.71) and (3.72), respectively.

𝑎//𝑏∨𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑑⊢𝑎↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐)

(C∨)
We immediately obtain the following introduction and elimination rules for
conjunction and disjunction:
Lemma 5.4 The following rules for conjunction and disjunction hold:
(1) 𝑎∧𝑏/𝑎
(4) 𝑎/𝑎∨𝑏
(2) 𝑎∧𝑏/𝑏
(5) 𝑏/𝑎∨𝑏
(3) 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎∧𝑏
(6) (𝑐)((𝑎/𝑐& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎∨𝑏/𝑐)
Proof For (1) consider the substitution instance 𝑎∧𝑏⊢𝑎↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑎of (C∧);
𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑎holds by (Rg). Thus 𝑎∧𝑏⊢𝑎. Rules (2)–(5) are shown analogously.
For (6) consider the substitution instance 𝑎∨𝑏⊢𝑎∨𝑏↔𝑎∨𝑏⊢𝑎, 𝑏of (C∨);
𝑎∨𝑏⊢𝑎∨𝑏holds by (Rg). Thus 𝑎∨𝑏⊢𝑎, 𝑏. From definition (D ⊢3) we get
(𝑐)((𝑎/𝑐& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎∨𝑏/𝑐).
□
Lemma 5.5 Conjunction and disjunction can be introduced and eliminated within
contexts, that is, the following equivalences hold:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐⊢𝑑;
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐, 𝑑↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐∨𝑑.

→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐⊢𝑑→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑).
For the second equivalence we first show the direction from left to right:
1. From 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐, 𝑑and two applications of (Cut) with 𝑐/𝑐∨𝑑
and 𝑑/𝑐∨𝑑we obtain 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐∨𝑑, 𝑐∨𝑑.
2. By (RC) we obtain 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐∨𝑑.
For the direction from right to left:
1. Assume 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, 𝑐∨𝑑.
2. This is equivalent to (𝑒)((𝑏1/𝑒& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑒& 𝑐∨𝑑/𝑒) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑒).
3. Assume 𝑏1/𝑒to 𝑏𝑚/𝑒, 𝑐/𝑒and 𝑑/𝑒.

Lemma 5.6 Conjunction and disjunction are logical constants, that is, their rules
are fully characterizing.
Proof For conjunction we have to show that
((𝑑)(𝑎1 ⊢𝑑↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑) & (𝑑)(𝑎2 ⊢𝑑↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑)) →𝑎1//𝑎2
is true. Assuming the antecedent, we substitute 𝑎2 for 𝑑in both its conjuncts to obtain
𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑎2 and 𝑎2 ⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑎2. By (Rg) we obtain 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑎2 from
the second conjunct, and with 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑎2 we obtain 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2 from the first conjunct.
Likewise for 𝑎2 ⊢𝑎1. The proof for disjunction is similar.
□
5.6 Conditional and anti-conditional
Again, we choose those formulations of the characterizing rules that highlight the
duality of the definitions. For the conditional (>) this definition is:
𝑎//𝑏> 𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑑⊢𝑎↔𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐)
(D>)
𝑑⊢𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐
(C>)
If we dualize (C>), we obtain:
(C>) 𝛿
𝑐>𝛿𝑏⊢𝑑↔𝑐⊢𝑑, 𝑏
which is equivalent to Popper’s definition of the anti-conditional (≯):58
𝑎//𝑏≯𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑎⊢𝑑↔𝑐⊢𝑑, 𝑏)
(D≯)
𝑐≯𝑏⊢𝑑↔𝑐⊢𝑑, 𝑏
(C≯)
As an informal observation we may state that the conditional is characterized by
the deduction theorem and the anti-conditional by the dual of the deduction theorem.
On the basis of these definitions we can show that modus ponens holds for the
conditional, and that a dual to modus ponens holds for the anti-conditional.
Lemma 5.7 The following rules hold:
1. 𝑏, 𝑏> 𝑐⊢𝑐
(modus ponens),
2. 𝑐⊢𝑐≯𝑏, 𝑏
(a dual rule to modus ponens).
Proof (1) In (C>) let 𝑑be 𝑏> 𝑐to obtain 𝑏> 𝑐⊢𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏⊢𝑐. By (Rg),
𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏⊢𝑐follows.
58 Our definitions (D>) and (D≯) correspond to Popper’s (1948a) rules (3.81) and (3.82),respectively.

(2) In (C≯) let 𝑑be 𝑐≯𝑏to obtain 𝑐≯𝑏⊢𝑐≯𝑏↔𝑐⊢𝑐≯𝑏, 𝑏. By (Rg),
𝑐⊢𝑐≯𝑏, 𝑏follows.
□
Lemma 5.8 Conditional and anti-conditional are logical constants, that is, their
rules are fully characterizing.
Proof For the conditional we have to show that
((𝑑)(𝑑⊢𝑎1 ↔𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐) & (𝑑)(𝑑⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐)) →𝑎1//𝑎2
is true. Assuming the antecedent, we instantiate 𝑑by 𝑎1 in both its left and right
conjunct. From the left one gets 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎1 ↔𝑎1, 𝑏⊢𝑐, and thus 𝑎1, 𝑏⊢𝑐by (Rg).
From the right one gets 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑎1, 𝑏⊢𝑐, and thus 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2. Likewise for
𝑎2 ⊢𝑎1. The proof for the anti-conditional is similar.
□
Following Popper, we will use the terms “implication” and “conditional” inter-
changeably to refer either to the connective > or to statements of the form 𝑎> 𝑏. In
the modern discussion, the logical constant introduced and discussed by Popper as
“anti-conditional” figures under the heading “co-implication” (cf. Wansing, 2008).
5.7 Characterizations of implication and Peirce’s rule
As is well known, if implication (i.e., the conditional >) is defined solely by the usual
implication introduction and elimination rules of natural deduction, then the addition
of classical negation by its natural deduction rules is a non-conservative extension of
the logic. For example, Peirce’s law ((𝑎> 𝑏) > 𝑎) > 𝑎is not derivable using only the
introduction and elimination rules for implication, but becomes derivable if the rules
of classical negation are added.59
Popper (1947c) already made this observation in the context of his characterizing
rules. He calls positive logic that part of propositional logic obtained by the definitions
of the logical constants excluding negation, and remarks in Popper (1947c, p. 215):
“Positive logic as defined by these rules does not yet contain all valid rules of inferences
in which no use is made of negation: there is a further region which we may call the
‘extended positive logic’ [. . .].” Kleene’s (1948) review (cf. this volume, § 13.12) of
Popper (1947d) cites Popper’s observation and turns it into a critique of Popper’s
claim to give explicit definitions of the logical constants: “If his definitions were
‘explicit,’ as he claims, it should make no difference whatsoever, in the case of a
formula containing only ‘>’, whether or not the definition of classical negation has
been stated.” But it is clearly not enough to just “state” the definition. It is the existence
postulate which tells us that for every statement there exists a classical negation of it
in the object language which permits the proof of the demonstrability of, for example,
Peirce’s law to go through.
In order to make statements such as Peirce’s law deducible without invoking
negation, Popper considers the use of the following additional rule for the conditional:
59 Cf. Dummett (1991, p. 291f.); cf. also de Campos Sanz, Piecha, and Schroeder-Heister (2014).

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
47
(4.2e)
𝑎, 𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏↔𝑎/𝑏
Reading (4.2e) from left to right amounts to a characterization of implication by
Peirce’s rule60, that is, a rule version of Peirce’s law ((𝑏> 𝑐) > 𝑏) > 𝑏. Popper also
mentions that in the presence of (4.2e), the rules for classical negation can be obtained
from the definitions of intuitionistic negation.61
Popper thus had the following insights, which were far from trivial at the time: The
addition of classical negation to a logic containing implication defined by its usual
introduction and elimination rules forms a non-conservative extension. Alternatively,
implication can be characterized by a stronger set of rules containing a version of
Peirce’s rule. If this stronger set of rules for implication is used, then intuitionistic
and classical negation coincide. Whether Popper was the first to consider Peirce’s
rule is not completely clear. Seldin (2008, § 3) “think[s . . .] that Popper and Curry
thought of this rule independently.”
Further remarks on implication
In later unpublished typescripts, entitled “A Note on the Classical Conditional” (this
volume, Chapter 17), which were written at the beginning of 1952, Popper wants to
show how to derive the truth table of classical implication from the generally accepted
inference rules of implication (e.g., modus ponens), together with the definition
of a valid inference as an inference which transmits truth from its premises to its
conclusion. One can thus say that the inference rules are considered to be primary, and
the truth tables are to be justified in terms of the generally accepted rules of inference,
and are thus secondary. Popper furthermore discusses the difference between classical,
strict and intuitionist implication, and makes the following remark on intuitionism
(this volume, Chapter 17, Typescript 2, § 8):
While contending that the truth table of the classical conditional does not,
upon closer inspection, conflict with the usages of an “ordinary language”,
the tendencies and the consistently developed usages of an ordinary language,
I am very ready to admit with the Intuitionists (Brouwer, Heyting) that
“ordinary language” usages involve us into difficulties when problems of
infinities are involved, and that we may have to sacrifice classical negation,
with its characteristic truth table, and especially ⟨6.5⟩[𝑏is false if and only
if ¬𝑏is true] (and the law of the excluded middle).
60 Popper did not call his rule “Peirce’s rule”.
61 Cf. Popper (1947c, p. 216): “Also we do not need, in the presence of rule 4.2e, the whole force of
our rule of negation 4.6 [i.e., classical negation], but can obtain this rule as a secondary rule from
some weaker rules [. . .] (from the rules of the so-called intuitionist logic).” Popper (1947c, p. 200)
calls a rule secondary if it is derivable from a set of given so-called primary rules, that is, if “every
inference which is asserted as valid by the secondary rule could be drawn merely by force of the
primary rules alone.”

5.8 Conjoint denial, alternative denial and further connectives
Popper (1947c, p. 219) defines some connectives in terms of connectives that
have already been defined by characterizing rules, noting that these definitions are
unnecessary in the sense that one can always use the characterizing rules directly
instead. We mention the conjoint denial
(D↓)
𝑎//𝑎↓𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎∨𝑏)
and the alternative denial
(D )
𝑎//𝑎
𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎∧𝑏)
In a letter to Alonzo Church of 2 February 1948 (this volume, § 24.3) Popper provides
characterizing rules for these two connectives as follows and notes their duality:
𝑎↓𝑏⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐
(C↓)
𝑎⊢𝑏
𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐⊢
(C )
In a handwritten note Popper (n.d.[a]) defines negation, conjunction, disjunction,
conditional, anti-conditional and bi-conditional both in terms of alternative denial
and in terms of joint denial.
After introducing the bi-conditional
(Db=)
𝑎//𝑏b= 𝑐↔(for any 𝑎1: 𝑎1/𝑎↔𝑎1, 𝑐/𝑏& 𝑎1, 𝑏/𝑐)
Popper defines the exclusive disjunction as follows:
(D≠)
𝑎//𝑎≠𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎b= 𝑏)
Further connectives defined by using already defined logical constants are the
tautology
(D𝑡)
𝑎//𝑡(𝑏) ↔𝑎//𝑏∨¬𝑏
and the contradiction
(D 𝑓)
𝑎// 𝑓(𝑏) ↔𝑎//𝑏∧¬𝑏
Since, for any 𝑎and 𝑏, 𝑡(𝑎)//𝑡(𝑏) and 𝑓(𝑎)// 𝑓(𝑏) hold for these unary connectives,
one can simply write 𝑡and 𝑓; that is, these connectives correspond to the nullary
constants verum and falsum (cf. also the end of § 6.4).

6 Negations
Popper considered several different kinds of negation. We discuss their definitions
and investigate how they relate to each other. These definitions are taken from Popper
(1948c) unless indicated otherwise.62 Some of the following results were only stated
without proof by Popper, and for some he gave only proof sketches. We will provide
more details and fill in the missing proofs.
6.1 Classical negation
For classical negation (¬k) Popper considers several definitions, among them the
following two:63
𝑎//¬k 𝑏↔(𝑎, 𝑏⊢& ⊢𝑎, 𝑏)
(D¬k1)
𝑎//¬k 𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑑, 𝑎⊢𝑐↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐)
(D¬k2)
with the following two characterizing rules:
¬k 𝑏, 𝑏⊢& ⊢¬k 𝑏, 𝑏
(C¬k1)
(𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐)
(C¬k2)
These two definitions reflect two different ways of characterizing classical negation.
Definition (D¬k1) is based on the idea that the classical negation of a statement 𝑏is a
statement which is at the same time complementary and contradictory to 𝑏, whereas
(D¬k2) is very similar to the rules for negation used in classical sequent calculus.
Lemma 6.1 The definitions (D¬k1) and (D¬k2) are equivalent.
Proof We consider the characterizing rules, and show first that (C¬k1) follows from
(C¬k2):
In (𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐) let 𝑑be 𝑏to obtain (𝑐)(𝑏, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐↔
𝑏⊢𝑏, 𝑐). By (Rg) one obtains (𝑐)(𝑏, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐), that is, 𝑏, ¬k 𝑏⊢; hence ¬k 𝑏, 𝑏⊢
by (LE). In (𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐) let 𝑐be ¬k 𝑏to obtain (𝑑)(𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢
¬k 𝑏↔𝑑⊢𝑏, ¬k 𝑏). By (Rg) one obtains (𝑑)(𝑑⊢𝑏, ¬k 𝑏), that is, ⊢𝑏, ¬k 𝑏; hence
⊢¬k 𝑏, 𝑏by (RE).
To show that (C¬k2) follows from (C¬k1) it is sufficient to show that the two
implications ⊢¬k 𝑏, 𝑏→(𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐→𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐) and ¬k 𝑏, 𝑏⊢→(𝑑⊢𝑏, 𝑐→
𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐) hold. This can be done by using (Cut). To show the first implication we
assume ⊢¬k 𝑏, 𝑏, from which we obtain 𝑑⊢¬k 𝑏, 𝑏by (LW). Assuming 𝑑, ¬k 𝑏⊢𝑐
we get 𝑑, 𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐by (Cut), from which we get 𝑑, 𝑏⊢𝑐by (LC). The second
implication is a direct instance of (Cut), where the cut formula is the statement 𝑏.□
62 Popper’s notation for negations varies; we write ¬k 𝑎, for example, where Popper would, e.g.,
have written 𝑎𝑘.
63 In Popper (1948c), (D¬k1) is (D4.3), and (D¬k2) is (4.31).

50
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
The use of (Cut) can be justified by using our definition (D ⊢3)64 for relative
demonstrability (⊢) instead of Popper’s definition (D ⊢2), or by assuming that the
object language contains conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨) and the conditional (>); cf.
§ 4.5.65 We take the first option here, and presuppose our definition (D ⊢3).
Lemma 6.2 Classical negation ¬k is self-dual, that is, (¬k 𝑎) 𝛿= ¬k 𝑎for the duality
function 𝛿.
Proof By applying the duality function 𝛿to (D¬k1).
□
6.2 Intuitionistic negation and dual-intuitionistic negation
The study of formalized intuitionistic logic started with Heyting’s set of axioms.66
Originally, Heyting’s formalization was written in response to a prize question pro-
posed by Mannoury in 1927, which also asked “to investigate whether from the system
to be constructed [for intuitionistic logic] a dual system may be obtained by (formally)
interchanging the principium tertii exclusi and the principium contradictionis.”67
Thus the idea of dualizing intuitionistic logic was present from the very beginning
of its development.68 The principium tertii exclusi is in Popper’s theory mirrored
by the property of a negation of 𝑏to be complementary to 𝑏, and the principium
contradictionis is mirrored by the contradictoriness of 𝑏and the negation of 𝑏. Popper
uses the term “minimum definable negation” when he writes about what we call
dual-intuitionistic negation (¬m), but still mentions the fact that it forms some kind
of dual to intuitionistic negation.69 For intuitionistic negation (¬i), Popper gives the
following definition and characterizing rule:70
𝑎//¬i 𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑎↔𝑐, 𝑏⊢)
(D¬i)
𝑐⊢¬i 𝑏↔𝑐, 𝑏⊢
(C¬i)
If we dualize (D¬i), we get
(D¬i)𝛿
𝑎//¬i 𝛿𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑎⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑐, 𝑏)
64 Cf. the discussion in § 4.5.
65 Popper states that (D¬k1) and (D¬k2) are equivalent if the existence of either conjunction or
disjunction is guaranteed for arbitrary statements.

67 Quoted from Troelstra (1990, p. 4).
68 Cf. Kapsner (2014, p. 128).
69 Cf. Popper (1948c, p. 323). Cohen (1953b, p. 188) remarks that “[t]he negation functor in the
dualintuitionistic restricted predicate calculus GL2 [developed by Cohen] has the same properties
as Popper’s ‘minimum definable (non-modal) negation [¬m].’” To avoid misunderstandings, it
should be emphasized that Popper’s usage of the term “minimum negation” has nothing to do with
Johansson’s (1937) “minimal calculus” and its negation.

which is identical to Popper’s definition for dual-intuitionistic negation (¬m):71
𝑎//¬m 𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑎⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑐, 𝑏)
(D¬m)
¬m 𝑏⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑐, 𝑏
(C¬m)
Lemma 6.3 For intuitionistic negation 𝑏, ¬i 𝑏⊢holds, and for dual-intuitionistic
negation ⊢𝑏, ¬m 𝑏holds.
Proof In (C¬i) let 𝑐be ¬i 𝑏; by (Rg) and (LE) we get 𝑏, ¬i 𝑏⊢. In (C¬m) let 𝑐be
¬m 𝑏; by (Rg) and (RE) we get ⊢𝑏, ¬m 𝑏.
□
Lemma 6.4 Intuitionistic negation ¬i and dual-intuitionistic negation ¬m are logical
constants, that is, their rules are fully characterizing.
Proof For intuitionistic negation we have to show that
((𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑎1 ↔𝑐, 𝑏⊢) & (𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑐, 𝑏⊢)) →𝑎1//𝑎2
is true. In both conjuncts let 𝑐be 𝑎1 to obtain
𝑎1 ⊢𝑎1 ↔𝑎1, 𝑏⊢
and
𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2 ↔𝑎1, 𝑏⊢.
From the first conjunct we get 𝑎1, 𝑏⊢by (Rg), and from 𝑎1, 𝑏⊢and the second
conjunct we obtain 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2. The proof of 𝑎2 ⊢𝑎1 is similar.
For dual-intuitionistic negation we have to show that
((𝑐)(𝑎1 ⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑐, 𝑏) & (𝑐)(𝑎2 ⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑐, 𝑏)) →𝑎1//𝑎2
is true. In both conjuncts let 𝑐be 𝑎1 to obtain
𝑎1 ⊢𝑎1 ↔⊢𝑎1, 𝑏
and
𝑎2 ⊢𝑎1 ↔⊢𝑎1, 𝑏.
From the first conjunct we obtain ⊢𝑎1, 𝑏by (Rg), and from ⊢𝑎1, 𝑏and the second
conjunct we get 𝑎2 ⊢𝑎1. The proof of 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2 is similar.
□
6.3 Non-conservative language extensions
Popper(1948c,§ V) considers non-conservative language extensions,althoughwithout
using these terms. Popper (1947b, p. 282, fn 20) observes that “if, in one language,
a classical as well as an intuitionistic negation exists of every statement, then the
latter becomes equivalent to the former, or in other words, classical negation then
absorbs or assimilates its weaker kin.”72 Moreover, he observes that this does not
happen if classical negation is put together with Johansson’s negation (or with yet
71 Cf. Popper (1948c, def. (D4.2)).
72 Cf. also Popper’s remark at the end of § 3 in Chapter 16 of this volume.

another negation, “the impossibility of 𝑏”, proposed by him ibid., p. 283). However,
Johansson’s negation ¬j is not a logical constant in Popper’s sense (cf. Theorem 6.12).
An example of a non-conservative language extension is the addition of classical
negation ¬k to a language containing both intuitionistic negation ¬i and dual-
intuitionistic negation ¬m since this addition makes classical laws hold for the two
weaker negations ¬i and ¬m.
Theorem 6.5 In the presence of ¬k we have ¬k 𝑎//¬i 𝑎, ¬k 𝑎//¬m 𝑎and ¬i 𝑎//¬m 𝑎.
In other words, the three negations ¬k, ¬i and ¬m collapse into a single one (i.e., they
become synonymous).
Proof Classical negation ¬k satisfies the rules for ¬i and ¬m, that is, we have
𝑎⊢¬k 𝑏↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢and ¬k 𝑎⊢𝑏↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏, respectively. Both equivalences are
direct consequences of (C¬k1) and (C¬k2), by using (Cut). Since the rules for ¬i
and ¬m are fully characterizing, we have ¬k 𝑎//¬i 𝑎and ¬k 𝑎//¬m 𝑎. Hence also
¬i 𝑎//¬m 𝑎, for any object language containing ¬k, ¬i and ¬m.
□
Popper (1948c, p. 324) also considers the more general situation where two logical
functions 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 have been introduced by sets of primitive rules 𝑅1 and 𝑅2,
respectively, such that 𝑅2 ⊂𝑅1. If both 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 are definable, and 𝑆1 is given, then
one can show that 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 are equivalent.
This can be generalized further, since 𝑅2 need not be a subset of 𝑅1; it is sufficient
that 𝑅1 implies 𝑅2. Consider the following setting with two fully characterizing rules
R1 and R2 for two 𝑛-ary constants such that R1 implies R2:
R1(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
(1.1)
R2(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
(1.2)
R1(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) →R2(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
(1.3)
Now assume that R2(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) holds. We get R2(𝑎, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) from (1.1)
and (1.3), which implies 𝑎//𝑏, since we have fully characterizing rules. Hence
R1(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛). The two characterized constants become thus synonymous; in
other words, adding R1 yields a non-conservative extension of systems containing R2.
Popper’s treatment of conservativeness also throws some light on his logical
approach in general. Based on the fact that Popper does not use conservativeness as a
criterion for accepting characterizing rules, one could argue that Popper is not aiming
at a semantic justification of logical theories, since from a semantic theory we expect
that the introduction of a new constant is always a conservative extension; cf. § 1.5.

6.4 Six further kinds of negation
Popper (1948c, § VI) considers three further kinds of negation explicitly, namely
¬j, ¬l and ¬n. He mentions their duals in a footnote73 but does not study them. The
negation ¬n coincides with what is nowadays called subminimal negation74.
Definition 6.6 The six negations ¬j, ¬dj, ¬l, ¬dl, ¬n and ¬dn are given by the following
characterizing rules. We also indicate the respective duals. (The characterizing rules
for ¬k, ¬i and ¬m are repeated below for comparison.)

Popper (1948c, p. 328) explains his names for these negations as follows: “In view
of 6.2 [cf. Definition 6.6], we may call [¬l 𝑎] the ‘left-hand side negation of 𝑎’ (in
contradistinction to Johansson’s [¬j 𝑎] which, in view of 6.1 [cf. Definition 6.6], is a
‘right hand side negation’). [¬n 𝑎] may be called the ‘neutral negation’; it is neutral
with respect to right-sidedness and left-sidedness [. . .].” As mentioned above (cf.
§ 5.3), Popper is wrong in calling the 𝑗-negation ¬j “Johansson’s negation”.
The two rules (C¬i) and (C¬m) differ slightly from the other rules in that they
have only two instead of three statements occurring in each relation of relative
demonstrability. However, they can also be given the same form with three such
statements, as the following lemma shows.
Lemma 6.7 The rule (C¬i) is equivalent to
(C¬i′)
𝑎, 𝑐⊢¬i 𝑏↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐⊢
73 Popper (1948c, p. 328, fn 16) writes: “There are, of course, dual rules of 6.1 [¬j], 6.2 [¬l] and 6.3
[¬n], two of which are satisfied by [¬m], just as 6.1 [¬j] and 6.3 [¬n] are satisfied by [¬i].” (In Curry
(1949, this volume, § 13.9), ¬l is mistakenly considered to be the dual of ¬j, which it is not in the
sense used by Popper.)
74 Cf., e.g., Dunn (1999) and the references therein.

54
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
and the rule (C¬m) is equivalent to
(C¬m′)
¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐.
Proof Rule (C¬i) follows from (C¬i′) by substituting 𝑎for 𝑐and applications of
(LC). Rule (C¬m) follows from (C¬m′) by substituting 𝑏for 𝑐and applications of
(RC).
Next we show that (C¬m′) can be obtained from (C¬m). For the direction from right
to left, assume ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐and use (Cut) with ⊢𝑎, ¬m 𝑎, which holds by Lemma 6.3.
For the direction from left to right, we first show that ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏
holds:
1. Assume ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑎, 𝑏.
2. Use (Cut) with ⊢𝑎, ¬m 𝑎(Lemma 6.3) to obtain ⊢𝑎, 𝑎, 𝑏, from which ⊢𝑎, 𝑏
follows.
3. Applying (C ¬m), ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏follows.
We now show that ⊢𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐implies ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐.
1. Assume ⊢𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐.
2. By using definition (D ⊢3) and by applying universal instantiation twice, we
obtain (𝑎/𝑑& 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑐/𝑑) →¬m 𝑎/𝑑.
3. Assume 𝑐/𝑑to obtain (𝑎/𝑑& 𝑏/𝑑) →¬m 𝑎/𝑑.
4. Using an instance of ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏, we obtain 𝑏/𝑑→¬m 𝑎/𝑑.
5. Reintroduce 𝑐/𝑑to obtain (𝑐/𝑑& 𝑏/𝑑) →¬m 𝑎/𝑑.
6. By universal quantification and application of (D ⊢3) we get ¬m 𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐.
To show that (C¬i′) can be obtained from (C¬i), we first apply the duality function 𝛿
to (C¬i), which yields (C¬m). An application of 𝛿to the equivalent (C¬m′) yields
(C¬i′).
□
In the following, we show how all these negations relate to each other.
Theorem 6.8 The following statements hold for the characterizing rules given in
Definition 6.6:
(1) ¬k satisfies the rule for ¬i.
(6) ¬k satisfies the rule for ¬m.
(2) ¬i satisfies the rule for ¬j.
(7) ¬m satisfies the rule for ¬dj.
(3) ¬j satisfies the rule for ¬n.
(8) ¬dj satisfies the rule for ¬dn.
(4) ¬k satisfies the rule for ¬l.
(9) ¬k satisfies the rule for ¬dl.
(5) ¬l satisfies the rule for ¬n.
(10) ¬dl satisfies the rule for ¬dn.
Proof We show (7), (8), (9) and (10). The structural rules (LE) and (RE) will be used
tacitly.
(7) We have to show ¬m 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬m 𝑏⊢𝑎, 𝑐, presupposing (C¬m). By
Lemma 6.7 we can use (C¬m′) equivalently.
a. Assume ¬m 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏.
b. Therefore ⊢𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏, by (C¬m′).
c. Therefore ¬m 𝑏⊢𝑎, 𝑐, again by (C¬m′).
(8) We have to show 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬dj 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dj 𝑐, presupposing (C¬dj).

a. Assume 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏.
b. We have ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬dj 𝑐→¬dj ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑐, as an instance of (C¬dj).
c. We have ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬dj 𝑐, by (Rg) and (RW).
d. Therefore ¬dj ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑐, from (b) and (c) by modus ponens.
e. Therefore ¬dj ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏, from (a) and (d) by (Cut) and (RC).
f. We have ¬dj ¬dj 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬dj 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dj 𝑐, as an instance of (C¬dj).
g. Therefore ¬dj 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dj 𝑐, from (e) and (f) by modus ponens.
(9) We have to show 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬k 𝑏→𝑏⊢𝑎¬k 𝑐, presupposing (C¬k).
a. Assume 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬k 𝑏.
b. We have ¬k 𝑏, 𝑏⊢and ⊢𝑐, ¬k 𝑐, by (C¬k).
c. Therefore 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑎, from (a) and (b) by (Cut).
d. Therefore ⊢𝑐, ¬k 𝑐, from (b) and (c) by (Cut).
(10) We have to show 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏→¬dl 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl 𝑐, presupposing (C¬dl).
a. Assume 𝑐⊢𝑎, 𝑏.
b. We have ¬dl 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl 𝑏→𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl ¬dl 𝑏, as an instance of (C¬dl).
c. We have ¬dl 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl 𝑏, by (Rg) and (RW).
d. Therefore 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl ¬dl 𝑏, from (b) and (c) by modus ponens.
e. Therefore 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬dl ¬dl 𝑏, from (a) and (d) by (Cut) and (RC).
f. We have 𝑐⊢𝑎, ¬dl ¬dl 𝑏→¬dl 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl 𝑐, as an instance of (C¬dl).
g. Therefore ¬dl 𝑏⊢𝑎, ¬dl 𝑐, from (e) and (f) by modus ponens.
Statements (2)–(5) can be shown analogously, and were already presented by Popper
(1948c, p. 328) without proof. For statements (1) and (6) cf. Theorem 6.5.
□
Corollary 6.9 By transitivity we have in addition that ¬k satisfies the rules for ¬j, ¬n,
¬dn and ¬dj; ¬i satisfies the rule for ¬n, and ¬m satisfies the rule for ¬dn.
Theorem 6.10 We have the following dualities: (¬k, ¬k), (¬i, ¬m), (¬j, ¬dj), (¬l, ¬dl)
and (¬n, ¬dn).
Proof The self-duality of ¬k is given by Lemma 6.2. For the duality between ¬i
and ¬m cf. § 6.2. The dualities (¬j, ¬dj), (¬l, ¬dl) and (¬n, ¬dn) can be shown by
applications of the duality function 𝛿.
□
Our results on negations are summarized in Figure 6.1.75
In contradistinction to classical, intuitionistic and dual-intuitionistic negation, the
six negations ¬j, ¬dj, ¬l, ¬dl, ¬n and ¬dn are not given by fully characterizing rules.
Hence, these negations cannot be considered as logical constants.76 This is especially
75 That ¬m does not satisfy ¬n was already observed by Popper (1948c, p. 328).
76 The idea that certain negations could be too weak to be still considered as logical constants is
already present in Popper (1943, p. 50): “Systems containing the operation of negation may be so
much weakened that contradictoriness [i.e., the derivability of any two formulas such that one is
the negation of the other] only implies n-embracingness [i.e. we can prove that any negation of any
formula whatsoever can be derived (ibid., p. 49)]. It appears, however, that we cannot weaken them
further without depriving negation of the character of a logical operation.”

interesting in the case of Johansson’s negation ¬j. In order to show this, Popper first
introduces the two logical connectives 𝑡and 𝑓:
𝑎//𝑡(𝑏) ↔(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑎↔𝑐/𝑎)

(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑡(𝑏) ↔𝑐/𝑡(𝑏))
(C 𝑡)

Lemma 6.11 For all statements 𝑏: ⊢𝑡(𝑏) and 𝑓(𝑏) ⊢.
Proof In (C 𝑡) let 𝑐be 𝑡(𝑏) in order to obtain (𝑏/𝑡(𝑏) ↔𝑡(𝑏)/𝑡(𝑏)), from which
one can obtain 𝑏⊢𝑡(𝑏). From 𝑏/𝑡(𝑏) and (C 𝑡) one immediately obtains (𝑐)(𝑐/𝑡(𝑏)),
and thus ⊢𝑡(𝑏). Similarly for 𝑓(𝑏) ⊢.
□
This shows that 𝑡is a unary verum and that 𝑓is a unary falsum.
Theorem 6.12 None ofthe rules for¬j,¬dj,¬l,¬dl,¬n and¬dn are fully characterizing.
Proof The verum 𝑡satisfies the rules for ¬j, ¬n, ¬dl and ¬dn. The falsum 𝑓satisfies
the rules for ¬l, ¬n, ¬dj and ¬dn. Classical negation ¬k satisfies the rules for ¬j, ¬dj, ¬l,
¬dl, ¬n and ¬dn. If the rules for the six latter negations were each fully characterizing,
then we would have for all 𝑎that ¬k 𝑎//𝑡(𝑎) or ¬k 𝑎// 𝑓(𝑎), depending on the negation
considered. But both ¬k 𝑎//𝑡(𝑎) and ¬k 𝑎// 𝑓(𝑎) can only hold for contradictory object
languages.

7 Modal logic
Modal logic is introduced in Popper (1947d, § IX). Popper uses modal connectives in
his proof of the compatibility of intuitionistic and dual-intuitionistic logic, which will
be dealt with in § 8.
Popper considers the following six modal connectives: necessary, impossible,
logical, contingent, possible and uncertain. They are taken from Carnap (1947, p. 175),
and the definitions given for them by Popper are strongly influenced by Carnap’s
treatment of modality. Popper’s definitions and characterizing rules for the modal
connectives all have the following form:
𝑎//M 𝑏↔(⊢𝑎Ô
∠
𝑎) & R(𝑎, 𝑏)
(DM)
(⊢M 𝑏Ô
∠
M 𝑏) & R(M 𝑏, 𝑏)
(CM)
where M stands for any of the six modal connectives, and R(𝑎, 𝑏) varies depending
on the modal connective to be defined.
Table 1.3 combines the table given by Carnap (1947, p. 175)77 and the list of
definitions given by Popper (1947d, p. 1223). Carnap’s half of the table contains

his names for the modal connectives, their definition in terms of necessity □and

every statement (or sentence, to use Carnap’s terminology) falls into one of three
disjoint categories. It can either be L-true, L-false or factual. A statement is called

L-determinate, if it is either L-true or L-false. If a statement is not L-true, then it
is either L-false or factual and so on. Popper’s half of the table contains his names
for the modal connectives, the corresponding symbol and the part R(M 𝑏, 𝑏) of the
definition that varies with the modal connectives.
If L-truth is matched with demonstrability and L-falsity with refutability, then the
close correspondence between the semantic properties given by Carnap’s and Popper’s
definitions becomes obvious. For example, in the case of a noncontingent (Carnap’s
terminology) or logical (Popper’s terminology) statement, the semantic property of
being L-determinate corresponds to the property of being either demonstrable or
refutable according to Popper’s definition.
We observe that the part ⊢M 𝑏Ô
∠
M 𝑏in Popper’s definitions (CM) of the
modal connectives M corresponds to the fact that in Carnap’s system all modal
statements (i.e., statements whose outermost logical constant is a modal constant) are
L-determinate.78 To express this determinateness is the only situation where Popper
uses (metalinguistic) disjunction in the defining conditions of logical operators. And
even here it plays only the role of a necessary side condition rather than something
that enters the content of the rule R(M 𝑏, 𝑏). A more modern treatment of modal
logic within the Popperian framework but not tied to Carnap’s exposition might well
do without disjunction in defining conditions in line with other logical operators.
Carnap’s modal logic is S5, which can be axiomatized by the axioms K, T and 5.
The same is the case for Popper’s modal logic, as the following theorem shows.
Theorem 7.1 From the definitions (DN) and (D>) we can prove the S5 axioms K, T
and 5.
Proof We consider axiom 5, that is, ⊢N 𝑏> N N 𝑏, which is shown as follows (K
and T can be shown similarly):
1. ⊢N N 𝑏↔⊢N 𝑏, from (DN).
2. ⊢N 𝑏Ô
∠
N 𝑏, from (DN).
3. If ⊢N 𝑏, then ⊢N N 𝑏, from (1).
4. If ⊢N N 𝑏, then N 𝑏⊢N N 𝑏, by (LW).
5. If
∠
N 𝑏, then (𝑐) N 𝑏⊢𝑐, hence N 𝑏⊢N N 𝑏, by instantiating 𝑐by N N 𝑏.
6. Therefore N 𝑏⊢N N 𝑏, from (2), (3) and (5).
7. Therefore ⊢N 𝑏> N N 𝑏, from (6) and (D>).
The proof can be generalized for all modal connectives M defined by Popper, that is,
⊢M 𝑏> N M 𝑏holds for any M.
□
The following result will be important in § 8, where it is used to show that the
interpretation of intuitionistic negation by I and of dual-intuitionistic negation by U
works.
Theorem 7.2 Uncertainty U and impossibility I are dual modal notions.
Proof By applications of the duality function 𝛿(Definition 5.3).
□
Each of the considered modal connectives is a logical constant in Popper’s sense.
We show this for N as an example:
78 Carnap (1947, p. 174) mentions this explicitly for necessity.

59
Lemma 7.3 N is a logical constant, that is, its rule is fully characterizing.
Proof We have to show that the following is true:
((⊢𝑎1
Ô
∠
𝑎1) & (⊢𝑎1 ↔⊢𝑏) & (⊢𝑎2
Ô
∠
𝑎2) & (⊢𝑎2 ↔⊢𝑏)) →𝑎1//𝑎2.
Assume ⊢𝑎1. From ⊢𝑎1 ↔⊢𝑏we get ⊢𝑏. From ⊢𝑏and ⊢𝑎2 ↔⊢𝑏we get
⊢𝑎2. From ⊢𝑎2 we get 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2. Assume
∠
𝑎1. Hence (𝑐)(𝑎1/𝑐), and by instantiating
𝑐by 𝑎2 we get 𝑎1/𝑎2. Therefore 𝑎1 ⊢𝑎2. The proof of 𝑎2/𝑎1 is similar.

8 Bi-intuitionistic logic
The logical constants of intuitionistic and dual-intuitionistic negation are compatible
in the sense that there is a logic containing both, without them collapsing into classical
negation. A proof of this result was sketched by Popper (1948c, § V). We give a full
proof in what follows. It consists in the exposition of the logic L1, for which we show
that it has the following, desired properties:
1. It satisfies the rules of Basis I.
2. It contains for any two statements 𝑎and 𝑏also 𝑎∧𝑏, 𝑎∨𝑏, 𝑎> 𝑏, 𝑎≯𝑏, I 𝑎
and U 𝑎.
3. It contains for every statement 𝑎its intuitionistic negation ¬i 𝑎and its dual-
intuitionistic negation ¬m 𝑎.
4. It satisfies all the inferential definitions of the logical connectives it contains.
5. Both ¬i 𝑎//I 𝑎and ¬m 𝑎//U 𝑎holds.
6. The duals I 𝑎and U 𝑎(cf. Theorem 7.2) do not collapse into each other.
Definition 8.1 The logic L1 is three-valued with truth-values d, c and r.79 It contains
a statement 𝑠with constant truth-value c. The truth-values of the compound statements
of L1 and of 𝑠are given by the truth-tables in Table 1.4; for completeness, we add
the truth-tables for N, P, L and C, which are not included in Popper (1948c).
A deducibility relation 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏is L1-valid, if the following conditions hold:
1. If 𝑎1 ∧. . . ∧𝑎𝑛has truth-value d, then 𝑏must have truth-value d as well.
2. If 𝑎1 ∧. . . ∧𝑎𝑛has truth-value c, then 𝑏must have either truth-value c or
truth-value d.
3. If 𝑎1 ∧. . . ∧𝑎𝑛has truth-value r, then 𝑏can have any truth-value.
The truth-values d, c and r of L1 reflect Carnap’s tripartition into demonstrable,
factual (contingent), and refutable statements, respectively. That is, if d is read as
L-true, c as factual in the sense of Carnap, and r as L-false, then the given truth-tables
for L1 are an adequate semantics for this reading.
Lemma 8.2 L1 satisfies the rules of Basis I.
Proof That L1 satisfies (Rg) and (Tg) is a direct consequence of the definition of
L1-validity.
□
79 Popper (1948c) uses the truth-values 1, 2 and 3, which are here replaced by d, c and r, respectively.

Lemma 8.3 The following propositions are true:
1. A statement of L1 is demonstrable if, and only if, it has the value d for all
valuations.
2. A demonstrable statement exists in L1.
3. A statement is refutable if, and only if, it has the value r for all valuations.
4. A refutable statement exists in L1.
5. It is 𝑎//𝑏if, and only if, the value of 𝑎is identical with the value of 𝑏.
Proof (1), (3) and (5) follow directly from the definitions of demonstrability and
refutability (cf. § 4.2 and § 4.3), together with the interpretation of deducibility in L1.
A witness for (2) is the demonstrable statement 𝑎> 𝑎. A witness for (4) is the refutable
statement 𝑎≯𝑎.
□
Lemma 8.4 The logical constants in L1 satisfy their respective inferential definitions
(D∧), (D∨), (D>), (D≯), (DI) and (DU).
Proof This is only shown for U, the other cases are analogous. The characterizing
rule for U is:
(⊢U 𝑏Ô
∠
U 𝑏) & (
∠
U 𝑏↔⊢𝑏)
That the left conjunct is satisfied can be seen by looking at the truth-table for U,
which contains only either d or r. If U 𝑎has the truth-value d, then it is demonstrable,
and if it has the truth-value r, then it is refutable.
For the right conjunct, we consider first the part
∠
U 𝑏→⊢𝑏, which is also
satisfied: If U 𝑏is refutable, then it has the value r, and if it has the value r, then 𝑏
must have the value d, thus being demonstrable. The remaining part ⊢𝑏→
∠
U 𝑏is
also satisfied: If 𝑏is demonstrable, then it has the value d; hence U 𝑏has the value r,
thus being refutable.
□
Lemma 8.5 I 𝑎and U 𝑎do not collapse in L1.
Proof This is guaranteed by the existence of the statement 𝑠with truth-value c. The
value of U 𝑠is d, and the value of I 𝑠is r. Therefore it cannot be the case that U 𝑠//I 𝑠,
by Lemma 8.3.

Lemma 8.6 From the definitions (D¬i), (D¬m), (D>), (D≯), (DI) and (DU) we can
show that ¬i 𝑎//𝑎> I 𝑎and ¬m 𝑎//U 𝑎≯𝑎.
Proof For the proof of ¬i 𝑎//𝑎> I 𝑎we have to show that (𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏→𝑐, 𝑏⊢)
and (𝑐)(𝑐, 𝑏⊢→𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏), which is just an instance of (D¬i). The latter is shown
as follows:
1. Assume 𝑐, 𝑏⊢.
2. Therefore 𝑐, 𝑏⊢I 𝑏, by (RW).
3. Therefore 𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏, by (C>).
4. Therefore (𝑐)(𝑐, 𝑏⊢→𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏).
The proof of (𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏→𝑐, 𝑏⊢) is:
1. Assume 𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏.
2. Therefore 𝑐, 𝑏⊢I 𝑏, by (C>).
3. ⊢I 𝑏Ô I 𝑏⊢, by (CI). We argue by cases.
4. Assume I 𝑏⊢.
5. Therefore 𝑐, 𝑏⊢, by (2), (4) and (Tg).
6. Assume ⊢I 𝑏.
7. Therefore 𝑏⊢, by (CI).
8. Therefore 𝑐, 𝑏⊢, by (LW).
9. Therefore 𝑐, 𝑏⊢, by (3), (5) and (8).
10. Therefore (𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑏> I 𝑏→𝑐, 𝑏⊢).
Analogously for the proof of ¬m 𝑎//U 𝑎≯𝑎.
□
Lemma 8.7 In L1 there is for every statement 𝑎an intuitionistic as well as a
dual-intuitionistic negation of 𝑎. For ¬i 𝑎we have ¬i 𝑎//I 𝑎, and for ¬m 𝑎we have
¬m 𝑎//U 𝑎.
Proof We have 𝑎> I 𝑎//I 𝑎and U 𝑎≯𝑎//U 𝑎in L1. This can be checked by
constructing the respective truth-tables. Using Lemma 8.6, we obtain I 𝑎//¬i 𝑎and
U 𝑎//¬m 𝑎. The modal statements I 𝑎and U 𝑎exist for any statement in L1. Therefore
intuitionistic and dual-intuitionistic negations exist for any statement in L1.
□
Theorem 8.8 If a logic contains forany statement 𝑎also its intuitionistic negation ¬i 𝑎
and its dual-intuitionistic negation ¬m 𝑎, then these two negations do not (necessarily)
collapse, that is, we do not have ¬i 𝑎//¬m 𝑎.
Proof The logic L1 is such a logic.
□
Popper (1948c) thus showed that there exists a bi-intuitionistic logic. The logic L1
might not be very interesting in itself. Nevertheless, it is at least interesting from a
historical point of view, since it is perhaps the first example of a bi-intuitionistic logic
to be found in the literature after Moisil (1942), which Popper almost certainly did not
have access to.80 Moreover, it shows that already Popper had the idea of combining
different logics, a topic that today is receiving considerable attention (cf. Carnielli
and Coniglio, 2020).
80 The modern discussion of bi-intuitionistic logic was initiated by Rauszer (1974).

9 The theory of quantification
Popper extended his framework of inferential definitions to a theory of quantification
at the beginning of 1947. In a letter to Paul Bernays of 19 October 1947 (this volume,
§ 21.6), he wrote:
The first important result which I had finished about one week after I saw you,
was the extension of the method of 𝑎/𝑏∧𝑐↔𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/𝑐to quantification.
The meeting that Popper refers to probably took place in Zürich on 11 or 12 April
194781, where Popper met Bernays in order to discuss the possibility of publishing a
joint article on logic. The manuscript (this volume, Chapter 14) for this unpublished
article does not have a title; in a letter to Bernays of 3 March 1947 (this volume,
§ 21.3), Popper suggests the title “On Systems of Rules of Inference”, noting that
“[t]he title is not very good, but so far I could not think of a better one”.
Although they did not publish this manuscript, Popper’s results found their way
into several of his published articles. The most extensive discussion of these results
can be found in Popper (1947c, § 7 and § 8). Additionally, there is an important
footnote in Popper (1948c), an alternative axiomatization in Popper (1947d), and a
very short but clear summary of his treatment of quantification in Popper (1949a).
We follow the presentation of Popper (1947c) but refer to some modifications which
can be found in his other articles. Some modifications of his view on quantification
were only discussed in hitherto unpublished correspondence, which we will discuss
in § 9.4.
Popper’s theory of quantification underwent significant modifications over the
course of his published articles, subsequent corrections to those articles, and in
unpublished correspondence with other logicians. We present what we consider to be
his most mature view on these matters, taking unpublished material into account.
Popper uses the terms “theory of quantification” or “quantification theory” instead
of “first-order logic”. At first, he extends his concept of object language to include
open statements and his deducibility relation to range over open statements. He then
adds a substitution operation which replaces free variables by other free variables,
and gives rules and postulates which characterize this substitution operation. We
discuss his definitions of the auxiliary concepts of identity and non-free-occurrence
of a variable in a statement and, finally, his definitions of the quantifiers.
9.1 Formulas, name-variables and substitution
As explained in § 3, for propositional logic Popper considers pairs
81 Bernays writes to Popper: “[. . .] nothing stands, as far as I can see, in the way of us seeing each
other on the 11th of April in Zürich; I will certainly also be available in the midmorning of the
12th. I am looking forward to the receipt of the concept you promised me, – also with regards to the
possible joint publication.” (This volume, § 21.4.)

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
63
(L; 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏)
of an object language L and a deducibility relation /, axiomatized by a basis consisting
of the rules (Rg) and (Tg). Each element of the object language L is presumed to be
a statement, that is, something which has a truth value.
The first modification Popper makes in order to treat quantification is to consider
quadruples
(L; P; 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏; 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
)
consisting of a set L of formulas, a set P of name-variables (or pronouns), a
deducibility relation on L and a substitution operation
𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

which substitutes the name-variable 𝑦for the name-variable 𝑥in the formula 𝑎.
Variables 𝑎, 𝑏, . . . now range over formulas in L, and variables 𝑥, 𝑦, . . . range over
name-variables in P.
Formulas can either be open statements (also called statement-functions) or closed
statements (also called statements):
formula
open statement,
statement-function
closed statement,
statement
An example of an open statement given by Popper is “He is a charming fellow”,
which can be turned into a closed statement by replacing the name-variable “He”
with the name “Ernest’s best friend”. Popper explicitly remarks that open statements
do not have a truth value on their own; an open statement cannot be considered to be
true or false.
The deducibility relation is axiomatized by the same rules (Rg) and (Tg) as in the
case of propositional logic, but it now ranges over arbitrary formulas, not just closed
statements. For example, Popper says that one can validly deduce the open statement
“He is an excellent physician” from the open statement “He is not only a charming
fellow but an excellent physician”.
The new substitution operation is characterized by the four postulates (PF1) to
(PF4) and the six primitive rules of derivation (6.1) to (6.6), which we present in a
slightly simplified form as follows.
L ∩P = ∅
(PF1)
If 𝑎∈L and 𝑥, 𝑦∈P, then 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 ∈L
(PF2)
For all 𝑎∈L there exists an 𝑥∈P such that for all 𝑦∈P: 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
//𝑎
(PF3)
There exist 𝑎∈L and 𝑥, 𝑦∈P: 𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑡/ 𝑓
(PF4)
Note that two kinds of metalinguistic quantifiers are used: there are universal and
existential quantifiers ranging over statements 𝑎∈L and universal and existential

64
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
quantifiers ranging over name-variables 𝑥∈P. We only use symbols for the respective
metalinguistic universal quantifiers in the following; (𝑎) means “for all statements 𝑎”
and (𝑥) means “for all name-variables 𝑥”.
The postulates (PF1) and (PF2) are, in a way, only about the correct grammatical
use of formulas and name-variables. The postulate (PF3) says that for every formula
there is some name-variable not occurring in it. This is obvious if the set of name-
variables is considered to be infinite, and if each formula is a finite object which can
only mention a finite number of name-variables. The postulate (PF4), which Popper
considers to be optional, excludes degenerate systems in which only one object exists.
Take, for example, the open statement 𝑎to be “𝑥likes the current weather”. The
deducibility of “𝑦likes the current weather” from “𝑥likes the current weather” only
leads to a contradiction if there are at least two persons to whom 𝑥and 𝑦can refer.
Postulate (PF4) was also discussed in correspondence between Popper and Carnap
(cf. this volume, § 23.10 and § 23.11).
The six primitive rules of inference are given below. We will not discuss them in
detail, but the reader may check that they are valid for a concrete formalized object
language and a substitution operation for that language.

(6.6)
The rules (6.1) to (6.6) characterize substitution as a structural operation; this is
similar to how the basis characterizes commas in sequences of statements. It is
remarkable that Popper here presents an algebraic treatment of substitution, which
can be compared to the theory of explicit substitution developed much later (cf., e.g.,
Abadi et al., 1991).
As an intriguing sidenote, Popper compares the definition of substitution by the
rules (6.1) to (6.6) to the definition of conjunction via the inferential definition (D∧).
He writes:
These six primitive rules determine the meaning of the symbol “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” in a
way precisely analogous to the way in which, say, [rule (D∧) determines]
the meaning of conjunction [. . .] with the help of the concept of derivability
“/”. (Popper, 1947c, p. 226)
However, Popper’s rules for substitution cannot be brought into the form of an
inferential definition of an operator of the object language. Hence, substitution cannot
have the status of a logical constant according to Popper’s criterion for logicality; his
rules for substitution do not have the form of characterizing rules (and, consequently,
no fully characterizing rules can be given either). Indeed, Popper also explains
substitution as follows:

1 Popper’s Theory of Deductive Logic
65
The notation
“𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”
will be used as a (variable) metalinguistic name of the statement which is
the result of substituting, in the statement 𝑎(open or closed), the variable 𝑦
for the variable 𝑥, wherever it occurs. 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is identical with 𝑎if 𝑥does not
occur in 𝑎. (Popper, 1947d, p. 1216)
Popper’s rules for substitution may thus be viewed as an implicit characterization of
a metalinguistic operation, and not as an inferential definition of a logical constant
for object languages.
Next we discuss some auxiliary concepts defined with the help of both the
deducibility relation and the substitution operation.
9.2 Non-dependence, identity and difference
If we work with some inductively defined formal object language, then we can easily
specify the set of free variables of a formula by recursion on the structure of that
formula. This possibility is excluded in Popper’s approach, which is not restricted to
formal languages. Popper therefore introduces the expression
𝑎`𝑥
which can be read as “𝑥does not occur among the free variables in 𝑎”. Popper himself
expresses this as “𝑎does not depend on 𝑥”, “a-without-x” and “𝑥does not occur
relevantly in 𝑎”. The formula 𝑎does not depend on 𝑥if, and only if, substitution of
some name-variable 𝑦for 𝑥does not change the logical strength of 𝑎. That is:
(D 𝑎`𝑥)
𝑎//𝑎`𝑥↔for every 𝑦: 𝑎//𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

The second concept Popper defines with the help of deducibility and substitution
is identity. As Popper (1947c, p. 227f., fn 24) notes, one first has to extend the object
language L to incorporate formulas of the form Idt(𝑥, 𝑦); this is achieved by the
postulate
(P Idt)
If 𝑥and 𝑦are name variables, then Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) is a formula.
In addition, the characterizing rules for substitution have to be extended by rules of
the form
(Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)) 𝑥
𝑧
//Idt(𝑧, 𝑦)
(A)
(Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)) 𝑦
𝑧
//Idt(𝑥, 𝑧)
(B)
If 𝑥≠𝑢≠𝑦, then Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) 𝑢
𝑧
//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)
(C)
With these preliminaries, Popper defines identity using the following idea:

66
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
The identity statement “Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)” can be defined as the weakest statement
strong enough to satisfy the [. . .] formula [. . .]
“Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝑎(𝑥)/𝑎(𝑦)”
that is to say, the formula corresponding to what Hilbert-Bernays call the
second identity axiom. (Hilbert-Bernays’s first axiom follows from the
demand that the identity statement must be the weakest statement satisfying
this formula.) (Popper, 1949a, p. 725f.)
Popper here refers to the identity axioms 𝐽1 and 𝐽2 of Hilbert and Bernays (1934,
p. 164):
𝑎= 𝑎
(𝐽1)
𝑎= 𝑏→(𝐴(𝑎) →𝐴(𝑏))
(𝐽2)
This justifies the following definition of identity Idt(𝑥, 𝑦):
(D Idt)
𝑎//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔(for every 𝑏and 𝑧: ((𝑏//𝑏`𝑥& 𝑏//𝑏`𝑦) →𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
) &
((for every 𝑐and 𝑢: ((𝑐//𝑐`𝑥& 𝑐//𝑐`𝑦) →𝑏, 𝑐 𝑢
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑢
𝑦
)) →𝑏/𝑎))
Popper (1948c, p. 323f., fn 11) expands on the definition of identity Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) in
order to illustrate his method of obtaining a relatively simple characterizing rule from
an explicit definition that is the weakest (or strongest) statement satisfying a certain
condition or axiom. He first introduces the following abbreviating notation:
𝑎//𝑎`𝑥`𝑦↔(𝑤)(𝑎//𝑎  𝑥
𝑤
 & 𝑎//𝑎  𝑦
𝑤
).
Using this abbreviation, he defines Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) as the weakest statement strong enough
to imply the axiom 𝐽2:
(D Idt†)
𝑎//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔
(𝑏)(𝑧)((𝑏//𝑏`𝑥`𝑦→𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
) & (((𝑐)(𝑢)(𝑐//𝑐`𝑥`𝑦→𝑏, 𝑐 𝑢
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑢
𝑦
)) →𝑏/𝑎))
This explicit definition, which is an abbreviated version of (D Idt), can be replaced
by a definition that corresponds to the following characterizing rule:
(C Idt‡)
𝑎/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔(𝑏)(𝑧)(𝑏//𝑏`𝑥`𝑦→𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
)
This can be seen by instantiating 𝑎in (D Idt†) with Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) in order to obtain
(𝑏)(𝑧)((𝑏//𝑏`𝑥`𝑦→Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
) &
(((𝑐)(𝑢)(𝑐//𝑐`𝑥`𝑦→𝑏, 𝑐 𝑢
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑢
𝑦
)) →𝑏/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦))).

67
The left conjunct gives the direction from left to right in (C Idt‡), and the right
conjunct gives the direction from right to left.
Finally, difference Dff (𝑥, 𝑦) is simply defined as the classical negation of identity:
(D Dff)
𝑎//Dff (𝑥, 𝑦) ↔𝑎//¬k Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)
It is interesting to see that Popper chose to treat occurrence of free variables and
identity as defined notions, rather than to class them with substitution and deducibility
among the primitive notions characterized by the basis. We will see in § 9.4 that
Popper probably revised this position later.
9.3 Quantification
Inferential definitions of universal and existential quantification are introduced in
Popper (1947c), to which he later published a list of corrections and additions (cf.
Popper, 1948e), which we take into account here. Popper’s aim is not to develop
and analyze the theory of quantification, that is, first-order logic, but to show that
his approach to quantification is at least on a par with other proposed treatments
of quantification. He therefore restricts himself to stating his definitions of the
quantifiers and to deriving some simple conclusions, but he does not formally develop
a meta-theory of quantification. He does not, for example, discuss the completeness
of his rules, the difference between classical and constructive interpretations of the
existential quantifier, or the relation to models of his system.
Later, Popper (1949a) gives the clearest explanation of what intuition his inferential
definition of universal quantification is supposed to capture. He writes:
The result of universal quantification of a statement 𝑎can be defined as the
weakest statement strong enough to satisfy the law of specification, that is
to say, the law “what is valid for all instances is valid for every single one”.
Popper (1949a, p. 725)
Presupposing his rules of substitution, and writing 𝐴𝑥for the universal quantifier,
Popper’s inferential definition and the characterizing rule for universal quantification
are the following:
𝑎`𝑦//𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔(for every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝑐`𝑦/𝑎`𝑦↔𝑐`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
)
(D7.1)
For every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝑐`𝑦/𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔𝑐`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦

(C7.1)
In order to see how more ordinary presentations of the rules for universal quantifi-
cation follow from these inferential definitions, we can compare them to the more
familiar rules of the (intuitionistic) sequent calculus (writing 𝜑[𝑥/𝑦] for the result of
substituting 𝑦for 𝑥in the formula 𝜑):
Γ, 𝜑[𝑥/𝑡] ⊢𝜓(∀⊢)
Γ, ∀𝑥𝜑⊢𝜓
Γ ⊢𝜑[𝑥/𝑦] (⊢∀)
Γ ⊢∀𝑥𝜑

68
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
Γ, 𝜑[𝑥/𝑦] ⊢𝜓(∃⊢)
Γ, ∃𝑥𝜑⊢𝜓
Γ ⊢𝜑[𝑥/𝑡] (⊢∃)
Γ ⊢∃𝑥𝜑
with the variable condition that 𝑦does not occur free in the conclusion of (⊢∀) and
(∃⊢).
For example, by instantiating (C7.1) with 𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦and by using the rules (Tg) and
(Rg) from the basis, we obtain the following rule
𝑎, 𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐→𝑎, 𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦/𝑐
which can easily be seen to be a variant of the rule (∀⊢) where the name-variable 𝑦
takes the role of the term 𝑡. Similarly, by instantiating (C7.1) with 𝑐`𝑦and reading the
bi-implication from right to left we obtain the following rule, which corresponds to
the rule (⊢∀) with the variable condition that 𝑦does not occur relevantly in 𝑐:
𝑐`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑐`𝑦/𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦.
As was the case for universal quantification, Popper gives the clearest explanation
of the inferential definition of existential quantification not in Popper (1947c), but in
Popper (1949a, p. 725):
The result of existential quantification of the statement 𝑎can be defined as
the strongest statement weak enough to follow from every instance of 𝑎.
The inferential definition and the characterizing rule for the existential quantifier 𝐸𝑥
are
𝑎`𝑦//𝐸𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔(for every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝑎`𝑦/𝑐`𝑦↔𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐`𝑦)
(D7.2)
For every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝐸𝑥𝑏`𝑦/𝑐`𝑦↔𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐`𝑦
(C7.2)
To elucidate what they mean, we derive some more familiar rules for the existential
quantifier from its characterizing rule. Instantiating (C7.2) with 𝐸𝑥𝑏`𝑦and using the
rules of the basis we can obtain the rule
𝑎/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑎/𝐸𝑥𝑏`𝑦
which corresponds to the sequent calculus rule (⊢∃); and by instantiating (C7.2)
with 𝑐`𝑦and reading the bi-implication from right to left, we obtain the following rule,
which corresponds to (∃⊢):
𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐`𝑦→𝐸𝑥`𝑦/𝑐`𝑦.
Popper does not consider the explicit definitions (D7.1) and (D7.2) to be improve-
ments compared to the characterizing rules. They are given to show that universal
and existential quantification can be defined using only his basis and the rules (6.1)
to (6.6). He notices that these rules are not as simple as the rules of his basis, for
example. But he points out that the concept of “𝑎`𝑥” can be avoided in these definitions

(D7.2∗)
He conceives his rules of quantification to be less complicated than those given
by Hilbert and Ackermann (1928) or those given by Quine (1940, § 15), and he
emphasizes that his rules in the end make use of only one logical concept, namely
that of deducibility / as characterized by his basis.
9.4 An unfortunate misunderstanding
Popper (1947c, § 8) introduces a distinction between rules of derivation and rules
of demonstration or proof, something considered very important by him. If he had
not stopped publishing in logic, he would very likely have developed these ideas in
more detail. For example, among his unpublished manuscripts there are two which
are entitled “Derivation and Demonstration in Propositional and Functional Logic”
(this volume, § 18.1) and “The Propositional and Functional Logic of Derivation and
of Demonstration” (this volume, § 18.3), as well as another untitled manuscript (this
volume, § 18.2), which also deals with this distinction. In a letter to John C. Eccles of
10 November 1946 Popper (1946b) explicitly mentions that he is “writing a paper on
‘Derivation & Demonstration’”.
In order to illustrate this distinction between derivation and demonstration we have
to make use of the concept of relative demonstrability ⊢(cf. § 4.4). If we specialize
this concept to no formula on the left hand side and exactly one formula on the right
hand side, we obtain the definition of a provable formula 𝑎: ⊢𝑎. Consider now the
following two formulas of the metalanguage:
𝑎/𝑏→(⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏)
(8.4)
(⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏) →𝑎/𝑏.
(8.4′)
Popper correctly remarks that while the first formula is valid, the second is not. This
can be seen, as Popper claims, by instantiating 𝑎by a non-tautological consistent
formula and 𝑏by a contradictory one. Using a more modern terminology, we may say
that ⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏expresses that the rule leading from 𝑎to 𝑏is admissible, whereas
𝑎/𝑏expresses that this rule is derivable. The first formula (8.4) then expresses that
the derivability of a rule implies its admissibility, and the second formula (8.4′)
that the admissibility of a rule implies its derivability. The counterexample to the
second formula says that admissibility does not in general imply derivability. However,
82 Added in the corrections and additions (cf. Popper, 1948e).

70
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
it should be noted that the value of this counterexample is limited, as it does not
apply to rules closed under substitution (that is, to rules identifiable with the set of
their substitution instances), which is normally considered a requirement for rules to
constitute a logic. In classical propositional logic, for rules closed under substitution,
admissibility does imply derivability (cf. Belnap, Leblanc, and Thomason, 1963,
Mints, 1976, and Humberstone, 2011).83
Rules of the form ⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏are called rules of proof or rules of demonstration,
in contrast to rules of derivation expressed by 𝑎/𝑏(there can be more than one
premise). Now Popper correctly observes that the rules of a system like Principia
Mathematica (Whitehead and Russell, 1925–1927) are rules of proof and not rules of
derivation. For example, the rule of modus ponens takes the form
⊢𝑎→(⊢𝑎> 𝑏→⊢𝑏)
rather than the form
𝑎, 𝑎> 𝑏/𝑏.
What Popper intends to formulate here, and in particular in his definition of a
purely derivational system of primitive rules (cf. Popper, 1947c, definition (D8.1)),
is, in our opinion, a criterion that allows to distinguish between formulations of
logic based on axioms and rules of proof, such as those of Frege (1879), Hilbert and
Bernays (1934, 1939) and Whitehead and Russell (1925–1927) on the one hand, and
formulations of logic based on derivation alone, such as those of Gentzen (1935a,b)
and his own, on the other hand.
Unfortunately, he applied this analysis of rules of derivation and rules of proof to
the systems of Carnap as well as of Hilbert and Bernays in a way that does not take
account of an important difference between his system and theirs. Popper (1947c, p.
232) warns that there are rules of proof such as
(8.5)
⊢𝑎`𝑦↔⊢𝑎`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦

which are valid, whereas the corresponding rule of derivation
𝑎`𝑦/𝑎`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦

is invalid. He continues:
Now all the mistakes here warned against do actually vitiate some otherwise
very excellent books on modern logic – an indication that the distinction
between (conditional) rules of proof or rules of demonstration on the one side
and rules of derivation on the other cannot be neglected without involving
oneself in contradictions. (Popper, 1947c, p. 233)
Both Carnap and Bernays responded to Popper’s criticism of their respective system in
83 Formal systems not closed under substitution have many unexpected properties – in intuitionistic
logic, for example, that the law of double negation elimination can be validated; cf. de Campos Sanz,
Piecha, and Schroeder-Heister (2014) and Piecha, de Campos Sanz, and Schroeder-Heister (2015).

71
correspondence (cf. this volume, § 23.10 and § 23.11). Bernays (this volume, § 21.7)
writes:
Now I have to comment upon your critique of the formulation of the all-
schema, as it is given in the “Grundlagen der Math.” [Hilbert and Bernays,
1934]. I think of the passage p. 232–233 of your New Foundations. [. . .] The
contradiction that you derive, starting with the schema 𝑎`𝑥> 𝑏/𝑎`𝑥> 𝐴𝑥𝑏
which you criticize,does not arise in the formalism of the “Grundl. der Math.”,
because the implication plays another role here than the “hypothetical” in
your formalism.
We note that Popper’s letter to Carnap of 24 December 1947 (this volume, § 23.11) is
also interesting for the fact that it contains an expansion of his theory of quantification
by presenting several logical laws of classical first-order logic.
Popper later revised his understanding of the interaction of substitution and
deducibility. While his definitions are formulated using the weaker notion of interde-
ducibility, he then considered it necessary to use the stronger notion of identity of
statements (Popper, 1974c, p. 171, endnote 198):
The mistake was connected with the rules of substitution or replacement of
expressions: I had mistakenly thought that it was sufficient to formulate these
rules in terms of interdeducibility, while in fact what was needed was identity
(of expressions). To explain this remark: I postulated, for example, that if in
a statement 𝑎, two (disjoint) subexpressions 𝑥and 𝑦are both, wherever they
occur, replaced by an expression 𝑧, then the resulting expression (provided it
is a statement) is interdeducible with the result of replacing first 𝑥wherever it
occurs by 𝑦and then 𝑦wherever it occurs by 𝑧. What I should have postulated
was that the first result is identical with the second result. I realized that this
was stronger, but I mistakenly thought that the weaker rule would suffice.
The interesting (and so far unpublished) conclusion to which I was led
later by repairing this mistake was that there was an essential difference
between propositional and functional logic: while propositional logic can be
constructed as a theory of sets of statements, whose elements are partially
ordered by the relation of deducibility, functional logic needs in addition a
specifically morphological approach since it must refer to the subexpression
of an expression, using a concept like identity (with respect to expressions).
But no more is needed than the ideas of identity and subexpression; no
further description especially of the shape of the expressions.84
Concerning possible future work on logic, Popper states in his reply of 13 June
1948 (this volume, § 21.8) to Bernays’s letter of 12 May 1948 (this volume, § 21.7):
I have also a number of new results – but I do not believe that I will ever
dare again to publish something (except, maybe, an infinite sequence of
corrections to my old publications)!
84 Cf. the remarks in a letter to Schroeder-Heister of 19 August 1982 (this volume, § 32.5).

72
David Binder, Thomas Piecha, and Peter Schroeder-Heister
However, this modest remark should not be taken too literally in light of Popper’s
later contributions to logic reprinted in this volume (Chapters 9–11), and also in
light of his work on Boolean algebra and probability theory not presented here
(cf. Preface). Even Popper’s (1949a) logical contribution to the Tenth International
Congress of Philosophy shortly afterwards in Amsterdam85 carries the boldest and
most provocative of his titles: “The Trivialization of Mathematical Logic”. Although
he may have been embarassed by technical deficiencies as well as unfortunate and
misleading formulations in his exposition86, which naturally surfaced in discussions
with outstanding mathematical logicians such as Bernays, Popper was certainly aware
that he was making an original conceptual contribution towards the foundations of
deductive logic, something confirmed by the later development of inferentialism and
proof-theoretic semantics.

Logic without Assumptions (1947)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1947b). Logic without
Assumptions. In: Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society 47, pp. 251–292.
Editorial notes: In the original publication it says “Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 21, Bedford
Square, W.C.1, on May 5th, 1947 at 8 p.m.” below the title. We omitted this here. Popper sent lists of
corrections to Bernays and Quine. These have not been worked into this reprint. They are reproduced
in § 21.8.1 and § 30.5.1 of this volume. Further remarks by Popper can be found in footnote 8 of the
unpublished typescript “A Note on the Classical Conditional” (this volume, Chapter 17, p. 286).
In this footnote Popper also criticizes the review by McKinsey (1948, this volume, § 13.14). The
manuscript “A General Theory of Inference” (this volume, Chapter 15) seems to be an early version
of this article. The term “minimum calculus” refers to Johansson’s (1937) “Minimalkalkül”.
251
In this paper I shall try to explain, with a minimum of technicalities, some results of
investigations into the field of deductive logic. The main problem to be discussed is
the problem of deduction itself – more precisely, the problem of giving a satisfactory
definition of “valid deductive inference”.
Our method will be as follows: after having introduced, in section (1), a few
auxiliary technical terms, we shall propose a definition, criticize it, and replace it by
a better one, and repeat this procedure. After a few steps we shall reach, in this way,
our first result – a definition which is a generalization of one due to A. Tarski1; and
the rest of our investigation will be directed towards improving this result with the
aim of avoiding some crucial objections originally urged by Tarski against his own
definition.
The improved definition reached in this way suffices for establishing the validity of
propositional logic and of the lower functional logic, without any further assumption.

Three of the auxiliary technical terms which will be introduced and explained in this
section, “interpretation”, “statement-preserving interpretation”, and “form-preserving
interpretation”, are, like some other very general concepts, somewhat tedious to
deal with. Their generality, and even triviality, presents an obstacle to their intuitive
understanding. There is, as it were, so little in them that those who try to grasp them
are left with the unpleasant |
252
feeling that there is nothing to grasp. Those who are not
satisfied with concepts in which there is so little, or who cannot believe that there is
not more in them, may be assured that these three auxiliary concepts are the only
technical terms of such an unsatisfying generality which they will be expected to
handle. The other terms, “logical form” and “logical skeleton”, introduced at the end
of this section, speak for themselves.
We begin by considering a number of languages, Latin, Dutch, German, Russian,
etc., and by considering translations from one of these languages into the others –
say, from Latin into English. There will be good translations and bad translations.
Let us suppose that we know all the languages under consideration well enough to be
unfailing judges of the various translations offered; that is to say, we can say whether
a translation renders the full meaning of the statements to be translated or not; also,
whether perhaps a certain kind of expression (such as the nouns or the verbs) are
properly translated, while other kinds of expressions are rendered without regard to
their correct meaning, etc.
Now by an interpretation of one language in another we shall understand a kind
of translation, good or bad. Our intention is to use the term “interpretation” in such a
wide sense that even extremely bad translations can still be classed as interpretations.
But obviously, it will be necessary to introduce some kind of limitation to the badness
of a translation if we are not prepared to accept the claim, for example, that the first
twelve words of “Pride and Prejudice” constitute an interpretation of, say, the whole
original text of the “Golden Ass”. For certain purposes it might indeed be of some
advantage to use the term “interpretation” in such a wide sense that even the example
just given would be covered. But for our purposes, it turns out that a slightly narrower
use of the term is useful – especially in view of the fact that we shall not be interested
in such things as exhortations or exclamations, but only in statements.
|
253
Imagine that an extremely bad translator knows just enough about a certain
language – Latin, say – as to recognize what is, and what is not, a complete statement in
that language. (He may, for example, know nothing beyond the fact that statements are
separated by full stops.) He may then proceed by “translating” every Latin statement
into an English one. We who know both, Latin and English, will, of course, realize that
his mock-translation is shockingly bad, i.e., that most of the English statements do not
render in any way the meaning of those Latin statements to which they correspond, and
which they should translate. However, the mock-translation in question has perhaps
one advantage. Since to each statement of the Latin original there corresponds exactly
one statement of the alleged translation, it will be possible, if necessary, to check the
claims of the translator step by step; in other words, there will be at least a definite
claim to be checked, and a fairly definite method of checking it.

2 Logic without Assumptions
85
Now it turns out that it is convenient to confine our investigation to translations,
including mock translations, which satisfy the minimum requirement that every
complete statement of the original text is, however badly or arbitrarily, translated by –
or, more precisely, co-ordinated with – one complete and meaningful statement of
the translation. And a translation or mock-translation which satisfies this minimum
requirement will be called here, from now on, an “interpretation”.
It is important to realize that the concept thus defined is an extremely wide one.
We may, for example, choose to co-ordinate the first, second, third . . . statement of the
“Golden Ass” with the first, second, third . . . statement of “Pride and Prejudice”: the
result will be an interpretation in the sense here defined. But we may also choose to
co-ordinate the first, third, fifth . . . statement of the “Golden Ass” with one statement,
say the first of “Pride and Prejudice”, and the second, fourth, sixth . . . statement of
the “Golden Ass” with the statement “In Italy it rains more often than in Egypt”; and
the result of this utterly |
254
arbitrary co-ordination will still be an interpretation of the
“Golden Ass” in the English language, in the sense here defined.
It is perhaps difficult to imagine that such a wide concept as this concept of
interpretation is of any use. However, it will help us to define a few slightly narrower
concepts which turn out to be exceedingly useful; more particularly, the concept of
a statement-preserving interpretation and, furthermore, that of a form-preserving
interpretation.
It is possible that a certain statement of some text may, word for word, recur in some
other places of that text. Let us assume, as before, that the translator or interpreter of
the Latin text knows so little about this language that he only recognizes the places
where full statements end. But let us also assume that he has such a splendid memory
that he recognizes each Latin statement whenever it re-occurs completely, and that
he decides to translate it, in all places of its complete re-occurrence, by the same
statement of the English language by which he translated it when it occurred first.
If he follows this method consistently, we shall say that his interpretation preserves
recurrences of complete statements, or more briefly, that it is a statement-preserving
interpretation.
The concept of a statement-preserving interpretation is still a very wide one, and
one might be tempted, at first, to think that it is still too wide to be useful. It is so wide
that it allows us, for example, to translate every statement of the Latin language by
one and the same English statement – say, the statement “In Italy it rains more often
than in Egypt.” For in this case, our condition (viz., that every statement of the Latin
text must be translated, whenever it recurs, by the same English statement by which it
was translated when it first occurred) is clearly satisfied. In other words, if we wish to
give a statement-preserving interpretation of some Latin text in the English language,
it will be sufficient if we have at least one English statement at our disposal into which
we may “translate” all the statements of the Latin text; although we may, of course,
use more |
255
than one English statement – indeed, any number of different English
statements up to the extreme case in which their number is equal to the number of the
different Latin statements contained in the text to be interpreted. It is clear that, in
general, it will be impossible to re-translate a statement-preserving interpretation,
i.e., to re-construct the original text from the translation together with the rules of

86
Karl R. Popper
co-ordination (e.g., a kind of statement dictionary), except in the extreme case where
with every different statement of the original a different statement of the interpretation
is co-ordinated. (In this extreme case we speak of a strictly statement-preserving
interpretation.)
The conception of a statement-preserving interpretation has one outstanding
advantage over the conception of an interpretation as it was first introduced, viz., that
it can be easily extended so as to cover not only an interpretation of a given text in
some language or other, but also the interpretation of a whole language 𝐿1 (say, the
Latin language) in another language 𝐿2 (say, the English language). For this purpose
all that is necessary is to assume that we have co-ordinated, by some method or other,
to every statement of 𝐿1 one statement of 𝐿2. This might be done, for example, by
giving a proper translation of every statement of 𝐿1 in 𝐿2. In this extreme case (in
which the interpretation is strict) we have to use as many different statements of 𝐿2
as there are in 𝐿1. Or again, to use another extreme case as an example, we might
co-ordinate with every statement of 𝐿1 one and the same statement of 𝐿2. Or we
might choose, in intermediate cases, a group of 2 or 20 or 200 statements of 𝐿2, and
co-ordinate the various statements of 𝐿1 with these, by some method or other (say, on
the basis of some alphabetic similarity of the first letters). Once we have co-ordinated
with every statement of 𝐿1 a statement of 𝐿2, we have, of course, laid down a method
of giving for every text in 𝐿1 a statement-preserving interpretation in 𝐿2.
It may be remarked that the languages 𝐿1 and 𝐿2 may well coincide. We can
construct, for example, various |
256
statement-preserving interpretations of the English
language (𝐿1) in the English language (𝐿2), by selecting one or more – possibly a very
great number – of English statements (𝐿2) into which all other English statements
(𝐿1) are to be translated, in accordance with some dictionary or code.
I hope that the conception of a statement-preserving interpretation will be reason-
ably clear by now. That it can be a useful conception will still appear doubtful, and has
to be shown later. But it will be realized that this conception comprises a great deal,
not only interpretations which do not take any notice of the meaning of the statements
of the language 𝐿1 – the language to be interpreted – but also interpretations which
preserve the meaning of these statements, i.e., proper translations. Of course, we
cannot assert that the conception of a statement-preserving interpretation comprises
all proper translations; there may be an excellent translation from Latin into English
which is not statement-preserving but which, at times, may split up a Latin statement
into more than one English statement, or which uses one English statement to render
several Latin ones. But most proper translations which avoid such cases will fall into
the class of statement-preserving interpretations.
It should be noted that every statement-preserving interpretation automatically
preserves recurrences of groups or sequences of statements. If, for example, the group
of the statements 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . of language 𝐿1 occurs in a text more than once, it will be
translated into 𝐿2, by every statement-preserving interpretation, in the same manner
whenever the group recurs. This, of course, is not necessarily the case with groups of
expressions shorter than statements. Such expressions – for example, single words,
or groups of words – may, by a statement-preserving interpretation, be rendered

2 Logic without Assumptions
87
differently every time they recur in a certain text; provided, of course, that they do
not recur as parts of a recurring complete statement.
Within the wide class of statement-preserving interpretations we have, of course,
many sub-classes,andamong them notonly propertranslations,butalso interpretations
|
257
which preserve the recurrence of certain groups of words. Among these, one class
of interpretations is especially important for our purposes; we shall call this class the
“form-preserving interpretations”.
The intuitive idea of a form-preserving interpretation of a language 𝐿1 in a
language 𝐿2 is that of an interpretation which is not only statement-preserving but
which also preserves what is usually called the “logical form” of the statements which
are to be interpreted. A definition which is adequate to this idea can be easily given if
we assume that we can distinguish between two kinds of signs of the languages which
we are considering, viz., the formative signs and the descriptive signs.
Formative signs (they have sometimes been called “logical signs”2) are such signs
as, for example, the full stop, or, in the English language, such words as “and”, “or”,
“if . . . then . . . ”, “neither . . . nor . . . ”, “all”, “some”, “there exists at least one”,
etc. All signs, and groups of signs, which are not classed as formative will be called
“descriptive signs”. Examples are words such as “kitten”, “mountain”, “strategist”,
“aluminium”, or groups of words such as “Greek orators”, “elephant bones”, “elderly
disgruntled newspaper reader”, etc.; also – but only if “of” is not considered as
formative – “Orators of Greece”, “bones of an ancient ancestor of the elephants”, etc.
Other descriptive signs are adjectives such as “grey” or “soft”, and proper names
(names of individual persons or of other physical things). We shall assume, for the
time being, that the distinction between formative and descriptive signs can be applied
with ease and without ambiguity to all the languages in which we are interested, and
more especially, to the language 𝐿1 which is to be interpreted in some other language
𝐿2. (This assumption will be challenged later, in section (4).)
|
258
We can now define a form-preserving interpretation as an interpretation which
(a) preserves the meaning of all the formative signs, i.e., gives a proper translation
of all the formative signs, and which (b) preserves recurrences of those groups of
non-formative (descriptive) expressions which, in a proper translation, would fill the
spaces between the translated formative signs.
According to this definition, a proper translation (if it is statement-preserving) will
in general be a form-preserving interpretation; but so will be a translation of “All
men are mortal” into “All kittens are green”, provided we decide to preserve, in case
the descriptive sign “man” recurs in 𝐿1, its rendering by “kitten”, and, in the same
way, the rendering of “mortal” by “green”.
According to our definition, it is only necessary to preserve recurrences of
descriptive signs; two or more different descriptive signs of 𝐿1 may be rendered by
the same descriptive signs of 𝐿2, subject, of course, to the proviso that every statement
2 The term “logical sign”, introduced by Carnap together with the term “descriptive sign”, has
been used also by others, for example by Tarski. I prefer “formative sign” in order not to suggest
that logical signs are something like logical technical terms, such as the terms “deducible from”,
“compatible with”, “negation”, etc.

Karl R. Popper
is rendered by a statement – a true one or a false one, but in any case a meaningful
statement.
Among the form-preserving interpretations, there will be some which not only
preserve recurrences of descriptive signs but also differences between descriptive
signs. These might be called “strictly form-preserving interpretations”.
In general – that is, except if they are strict – form-preserving interpretations
cannot be re-translated or decoded. Even a knowledge of all the translation rules
enables us to translate only in one direction – say from 𝐿1 to 𝐿2 – but does not enable
us to re-translate our interpretation.
A necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of decoding or retranslating
a form-preserving interpretation 𝐿2 of 𝐿1 back into 𝐿1 is that every statement 𝑎1 of
𝐿1 which is interpreted by 𝑎2 of 𝐿2 is, in turn, a form-preserving interpretation of 𝑎2.
This is, at the same time, a necessary and sufficient condition for a form-preserving
interpretation to be strict. The situation with statement-preserving interpretations
is analogous. This enables us to define the |
259
strictness of form-preserving and
statement-preserving interpretations in the following way:
A form-preserving (or a statement-preserving) interpretation of 𝐿1 in 𝐿2 is strict if,
and only if,there exists such a form-preserving (orstatement-preserving) interpretation
of 𝐿2 in 𝐿1 that each statement of 𝐿2 is interpreted, in its turn, by the same statement
of 𝐿1 which it interprets.
So much about the ideas of a statement-preserving and of a form-preserving
interpretation.3
With the help of the latter idea, it is now very easy to define the idea of the logical
form of a statement and of a sequence of statements (e.g., of an argument):
Two statements 𝑎1 and 𝑎2, not necessarily belonging to the same language, have the
same logical form if, and only if, there exist two form-preserving interpretations such
that 𝑎1 interprets 𝑎2, and vice versa. (Instead of demanding two interpretations and
saying “vice versa”, we may also insert the word “strictly” before “form-preserving”.)
Similarly, if 𝐴1 and 𝐴2 are groups or series of statements. (We assume that
statements belonging to the same series also belong to the same language.)
Two series of statements, 𝐴1 and 𝐴2, not necessarily belonging to the same
3 Apart from the two kinds of interpretations which have been explained – statement-preserving
and form-preserving – there are others of some interest. I may mention the truth-preserving
interpretations, i.e. interpretations which do not necessarily preserve the meaning of the statements
involved but which render every true statement by a true statement. This may be achieved, in a
trivial way, by translating all statements of 𝐿1, whether true or false, into true statements (say, into
arithmetical truisms) of 𝐿2. If we wish to exclude such a trivial method, we can demand that the
interpretation should be not only truth preserving but truth-value preserving, i.e. that it should
preserve not only the truth but also the falsity of the statements of 𝐿1. In this case, we may still
render all statements of 𝐿1 by merely two statements of 𝐿2, viz. by one which is true and one which
is false. But this interpretation will be, nevertheless, far less trivial, since we have to consider the
truth or falsity of every statement of 𝐿1 before we correlate it with one of the two statements of
𝐿2. (In order to avoid misunderstandings, I may mention that my concept of interpretation does
not coincide with Carnap’s concept, as used in his Introduction to Semantics, ⟨Carnap, 1942⟩, esp.
p. 203 and pp. 212f. This can be seen from the fact that one of Carnap’s demands, expressed in our
terminology, is that 𝐿2 contains at least as many different statements as 𝐿1. Also, what Carnap calls
a “true interpretation” does not coincide with our “truth preserving interpretation”.)

language, have the same logical |
260
form if, and only if, there exist two form-preserving
interpretations such that the first (the second, etc.) statement of 𝐴1 interprets the first
(second, etc.) statement of 𝐴2, and vice versa. (Again, we can simplify the definition
by referring to strictness.)
The term “logical form” usually occurs in the context “the same logical form” or
“different logical form”, and for such contexts our definition suffices. If a separate
definition is desired, we can define the logical form of the statement 𝑎1 as the class of
all statements (of any number of languages) which have the same logical form as 𝑎1.
This is a very abstract idea; but a more concrete idea is available in case our two
statements 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 belong to the same language. We then can say that they have
not only the same logical form but, more concretely, the same “logical skeleton”;
for example, the statements of the English language “All men are mortal” and “All
kittens are green” have both the logical skeleton:
“All . . . . are
”
The logical skeleton of a statement or a group of statements is obtained simply
by eliminating all descriptive signs, indicating, at the same time, recurrences of
descriptive signs, by some method or other. It is clear that all statements or arguments
of a certain language with the same logical skeleton have the same logical form,
and vice versa; and it is clear that the concept of logical skeleton is not only more
concrete but also simpler, since it is possible to define it directly, with the help of the
distinction between formative and descriptive signs, without introducing the idea of
an interpretation. On the other hand, our idea of a logical form is more general, and
gives us the means of constructing logic as a theory of language – or of languages –
without tying us down to any particular language.
And this, indeed, is one of the main points of our use of interpretations: we operate
with the ideas of a statement-preserving and of a form-preserving interpretation partly
because this method allows us, as will be seen, to combine the modern view of logic
as a theory of language with the |
261
old intuitive idea that the validity of an inference
does not depend on the language in which it is formulated; or more precisely with
the idea that, if an inference is valid in one language, then it remains valid in every
proper (and form-preserving) translation.4
4 I believe that, in this way, we can preserve whatever is tenable in those objections to the modern
view which emphasize that logic does not deal with mere “sentences” but rather with “propositions”
or perhaps with “objective thoughts” (or “thought contents”) or “thoughts” or “judgements”, etc. (I
do not use the term “sentence” but “statement” in order to indicate that, if I speak of a statement, I
do not abstract from the meaning expressed by it – whatever this may be. A further analysis of the
idea of a “meaningful statement” is very desirable; but it is not, as far as I can see – cp. the end of
section (6) – necessary for the understanding of logic and the problem of its foundations; nor do I
believe that either psychology, behaviourism, operationalism, verificationism, phenomenalism, or
perceptionalism, etc., can have anything to offer towards a solution of the problem I have in mind.)

Armed with the technical terms introduced in section (1), we now turn to the analysis
of the idea of a valid (deductive) inference.
By an inference, valid or invalid, we shall understand, in this paper, a number
of statements, at least two, of some language, for example English, of which one is
marked out for a conclusion and the others for premises (for example, by writing the
conclusion last, below a horizontal line, etc.).
Our problem will be to analyse, in the most general way possible, the conditions
under which such an inference (or argument) is called “valid”; or using a slightly
different terminology, the conditions under which the relationship of deducibility
actually holds between some premises and a conclusion.
We shall take most of our examples, for the sake of simplicity, from syllogistic
logic; but this should not create the impression that we are more concerned with
syllogistic logic than with any of the more developed systems (including the so-called
“alternative” or “non-Aristotelian” systems, and those which use modalities).
|
262
We begin by considering two simple examples of inferences; (a) a valid one, and
(b) an invalid one.
(a)
(b)
All kittens are green
All men are mortal
Joe is a kitten
Socrates is mortal
Joe is green
Socrates is a man
Our task is to explain in a general way what we mean by saying that (a) is valid
while (b) is not – without appeal to any recognized system of rules of inference
of which (a) may be an observance or application. How could we try to explain to
somebody who has not studied such a system of logical rules that (a) is valid and (b)
invalid?
We might try to argue on the following lines:
It is conceivable that the conclusion of (b) is false, even if the premises are both
true, while this is not conceivable in the example (a). For, assume that all kittens are
really green, and that Joe is really a kitten, and assume nothing else; then, clearly,
Joe must be green. But assume that all men are really mortal, and that Socrates is
really mortal, but do not assume anything else (more especially, do not assume that
Socrates is a man any more than, say, Joe); then, clearly, it is conceivable that the
premises of (b) are true, and the conclusion false, since Socrates may be mortal and,
for example, a kitten. In other words, for (b) a state of affairs (in which “Socrates” is
the name of a kitten) is possible which renders both premises true and the conclusion
false, while with (a) every state of affairs which renders the premises true would also
render the conclusion true.
These considerations lead to our first preliminary and tentative definition (D1):
(D1) An inference is valid if, and only if, every possible state of affairs which renders
all the premises true also renders the conclusion true.
We may call a state of affairs which renders all the premises of an inference

2 Logic without Assumptions
91
true and, at the same time, the conclusion false, a counter-example of that inference.
(A counter-example of (b) is provided, for example, by a state |
263
of affairs in which
“Socrates” is the name of a kitten.) Using this term, we may re-formulate (D1) in this
way:
(D1′) An inference is valid if, and only if, no counter-example of it exists.
The main objection to this first tentative definition is the vagueness of the term
“state of affairs”, and more especially “possible state of affairs”. This latter term
may even be suspected of introducing a vicious circularity. For we are discussing
logical validity, i.e., logic. But “possible” may very well mean “logically possible”,
and thus presuppose what we wish to define. (The same may be said of words like
“conceivable”, etc.)
In order to avoid these question-begging terms, we shall make use of the technical
terms introduced in section (1). We can either use the comparatively simple term
“logical skeleton” or the more complicated term “logical form” (or, in its stead, the
term “form-preserving interpretation”). Let us first use, tentatively, the following two
logical skeletons of (a) and of (b):
(a+)
(b+)
All . . . . are
All . . . . are
, , , , is a . . . .
, , , , is
, , , , is
, , , , is a . . . .
Applying to (a+) and (b+) similar considerations as we applied to (a) and (b), we
arrive at our second tentative definition:
(D2) An inference is valid if, and only if, every inference with the same logical
skeleton whose premises are all true has a true conclusion.
We may now re-define our term “counter-example” as follows:
A counter-example of an inference is an inference with the same logical skeleton
whose premises are all true and whose conclusion is false.
If we use the term “counter-example” in this second sense (if necessary, we can
distinguish it by the attribute “skeleton-preserving”), then we can give an alternative
|
264
formulation (D2′) of (D2), such that the wording of (D2′) is identical with that of
(D1′), although its meaning of course, has changed with the meaning of “counter-
example”.
Another possibility is that we use the term “logical form” instead of “logical
skeleton”, leaving everything else unchanged. Owing to the fact, however, that “logical
form” is, in its turn, defined with the help of the term “form-preserving interpretation”,
it turns out that it is preferable to use the latter term instead. We thus arrive at (D3).
This is the definition described in the beginning of this paper as our first result, and
as a generalization of Tarski’s definition:
(D3) An inference is valid if, and only if, every form-preserving interpretation of it
whose premises are all true has a true conclusion.

92
Karl R. Popper
(D3′) is taken to have the same wording as (D1′) and (D2′); but “counter-example”
is now defined in this way:
A counter-example (or, more fully, a form-preserving counter-example) of an
inference is a form-preserving interpretation whose premises are all true and whose
conclusion is false.
An immediate result of our definition (D3) is the following theorem (T1) which
has the same wording as (D2), except that the term “logical form” takes the place of
“logical skeleton”:
(T1) An inference is valid if, and only if, every inference of the same logical form
whose premises are all true has a true conclusion.
(Similarly, if we re-define “counter-example” again, so that it means an inference
of the same logical form with true premises and a false conclusion, then we obtain
from (D3) a theorem (T1′) with the same wording as (D1′) etc., but, of course, a
different meaning.)
In view of (T1), we can say that the main difference between (D2) and (D3), i.e.
our second and third definition, is that (D2) refers to “logical skeleton” and (D3) –
indirectly – to “logical form”.
|
265
The considerable merits of these three definitions, and especially those of
(D3), will be discussed in the next section; and in section (4), we shall present
those objections against (D3) which will lead us to the construction of an improved
definition.
(3)
Proceeding to a discussion of our three definitions (D1), (D2), and (D3), I shall first
explain the points in which they are all strong; next the strong points of (D2) and
(D3); and ultimately, those in which (D3) is superior to the others.
All three definitions make use of the fundamental idea of transmission of truth
from the premises to the conclusion; that is to say, of the idea that, if the premises
are true, the conclusion must be true also. And all the definitions except the first
succeed in explaining, or rather avoiding, this “must” (which is one of those dangerous
question-begging terms) by pointing out that the transmission of truth depends solely
upon the logical skeleton, or logical form, of the argument; and the term “depends”
(which is also dangerous since it may mean “Logically depends”) is avoided by the
simple method of referring to all inferences of the same logical skeleton or form.
Both the reference to the transmission of truth and to the logical skeleton or
form seem to me intuitively highly satisfactory. It is the main point of the practical
usefulness of deduction that, if we know that the premises are true and the inference
valid, we can rely on the conclusion being true. In this way, inference allows us
to obtain from reliable primary information reliable secondary information; and it
allows us, by using as premises primary information from different sources, to derive
secondary information unknown to any one of the sources.

2 Logic without Assumptions
93
Moreover, the transmission of truth from the premises to the conclusion which
in itself is pragmatically as well as intuitively such an important point, means that,
whenever the conclusion of a valid inference is false, at least one of the premises
must be false; for otherwise we would have a |
266
counter-example and the inference
would be invalid. In other words, the transmission of truth from the premises to the
conclusion means also the re-transmission of falsity from the conclusion to (at least
one of) the premises. This is, from the pragmatic point of view, just as important
an aspect of a valid deduction as the obtaining of reliable secondary information. It
enables us to reject prejudices by falsifying their consequences; and it allows us to
test a hypothesis by the method5 of trying to refute some of the conclusions which
follow from it; for, if one of these is not true, the hypothesis cannot be true either.
It may be objected here that the term “true” which plays such a role in our
definitions as well as in these considerations is vague; also, that we often do not know
whether a certain statement is true or not. While this latter point must be admitted,
the vagueness of the idea of truth need not be admitted; on the contrary, most people
know that the word “true” can be easily eliminated from any such context as (1) “The
statement ‘the snow is white’ is true” or (2) “The statement ‘the snow is red’ is true”.
They know that the whole of (1) asserts precisely the same as the statement (1′) “The
snow is white” and that (2) asserts precisely the same as (2′) “The snow is red”. But
such a knowledge about the way in which a term can be eliminated from a simple
context is, precisely, a knowledge of its meaning.
Why then,it may be asked,do we not eliminate the word “true” from ourdefinitions?
The answer is that it is easily eliminated from such simple but fundamental contexts
where it refers to certain single statements, but not from contexts in which, more
generally, we speak about kinds of statements of some language – say, about all
statements of a certain logical skeleton or form, etc. It is especially in such a context
that the term “true” – meaning precisely the same as in the other context – becomes
useful.6
|
267
I am therefore not prepared to admit that the employment of the term “true” in
our definition is objectionable. Nevertheless, it will be seen that, in our final and
improved definition (see also (D5)), there is a possibility of avoiding this term. At
the present moment, however, I wish to emphasize that it must be the main point of
every definition of validity which is intuitively satisfactory that it provides for the
transmission of truth (whether or not the idea of truth enters the definition); and our
definitions ⟨do⟩a provide for it.
Apart from referring to the transmission of truth, our second and third definitions
refer to the logical skeleton or form of the argument in question. This too can be shown
to agree with our intuitive idea of a valid inference. One immediate consequence
5 Cp. my Logik der Forschung ⟨Popper, 1935⟩, and “The Poverty of Historicism, III”, ⟨Popper,
1945b⟩, esp. pp. 78ff.
6 The theory of truth underlying these remarks has been developed by Tarski in his analysis on the
concept of truth (in Polish, ⟨Tarski, 1933b⟩; in German, “Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten
Sprachen”, ⟨Tarski, 1935a⟩).
a Originally: “to”.

94
Karl R. Popper
which is part of this intuitive idea is that, if a certain inference is valid, all other
inferences of the same logical skeleton or form must be valid too. It is this fact which
allows us to lay down rules of inference which give a description of the logical form
of an argument. A rule of inference asserts that from premises of a certain kind, a
conclusion of a certain kind can be deduced.
We shall call such a rule of inference “valid” if, and only if, every inference drawn
in observance of the rule is valid.
The fact that, whenever an inference is valid, there will also be a valid rule of
inference (describing either the skeleton or the form of the argument; e.g., “Barbara”)
is also an immediate consequence of our second and of our third definition.
Ultimately I may mention very briefly, as a further advantage common to our
second and third definitions, the fact that they can be both easily extended so as to be
applicable not only to statements but also to statement functions.
A statement function (e.g. “He is green”) can be obtained by replacing a descriptive
sign (“Joe”) of a statement by an appropriate variable, e.g. a pronoun (“He”). Such a
function is neither true nor false. Nevertheless, it is useful for certain developments
to treat, say, |
268
(a−)
All kittens are green
He is a kitten
He is green
as a valid inference.
In order to extend our second and third definition so as to cover such cases, their
wording need not be changed. All that is necessary is to include statement functions
wherever we have so far considered statements, or groups of statements, and to specify,
if necessary, the real statements – i.e., those which alone can be true or false – by
some adjective; we shall call them, say, “proper statements”. Accordingly, a true or a
false example of the same logical form or skeleton as (a−) can only be an example
consisting of proper statements, since functions can be neither true not false; and the
same will hold for a “form-preserving interpretation whose premises are all true”,
etc.: such an interpretation will have to consist of proper statements.
We turn now to the weak points of our definition (D2), and the main reason
for preferring the third definition to the second. The main difference between the
two definitions is that (D2) refers to other arguments of the same logical skeleton
as the argument in question and thereby confines its reference to other arguments
belonging to the same language; (D3), on the other hand, refers to all form-preserving
interpretations and therefore to an unspecified number of different languages, viz., to
all those into which the formative signs can be properly translated. We shall show
that this difference has two consequences:
(1) Our second definition (D2) is satisfactory only if the language 𝐿to which the
argument under consideration belongs is sufficiently rich in descriptive signs.
(2) Our third definition is, besides, superior to the second because it yields the
immediate consequence that the validity or otherwise of an inference or rule of

2 Logic without Assumptions
95
inference is independent of the language in which it is formulated, in the sense
that if it is valid in one language, then every one of |
269
its proper form-preserving
translations into another language will be valid also.7
While point (2) does not need an explanation, point (1) does, and the rest of this
section will be devoted to construct a simple example of a language 𝐿in which, owing
to the poverty of its dictionary, an invalid inference would appear as valid from the
point of view of (D2), simply because no counter-example exists within 𝐿.
Let us assume a language 𝐿with the usual formative signs, “all”, “some”, “is”,
“are”, “not” etc. We may also include the words “and”, “or”, as well as the prefix
“non-” (e.g. say, “non-tall”) and the word “who” among the formative signs, so that
we may construct out of the simple descriptive signs “tall”, “fair”, and “Greeks” such
complex signs as “fair or tall”, “non-tall and fair”, “Greeks who are tall”, etc., which
are made up of both formative and descriptive signs.
As to the descriptive dictionary of 𝐿, we may admit proper names of persons,
such as “Socrates”, etc., and |
270
property-names or class names such as “Greeks”,
“Englishmen”, “Frenchmen” etc., as well as, say, “tall”, “short”, “wise”, “foolish”,
“fair” and “dark”. The main point is that our descriptive dictionary must not contain
any simple descriptive name synonymous with, say, “short and foolish” or “short and
not-foolish” etc.; nor must it contain any simple descriptive name of a property which
is common to all persons. (We may consider the class of all persons as our universe
of discourse; and we may say that we must not have in 𝐿a purely descriptive name
of the universal class.) The upshot of all this is that we achieve in this way that our
language does not possess two different simple names of two classes of which the
one is included in the other.
Consider now this example of an inference in 𝐿:
7 Cp. the end of section (1) and note 4. It is even possible to avoid the words “form-preserving”
here, by a further generalization of (D3). For this purpose, we may replace the word “valid” in (D3)
– or, for that matter, in our final definition (D6) – by “formally valid”, and then add the following
definitions of “informally (or materially) valid” and of “valid”; “An inference is informally valid if,
and only if, it is formally invalid and there exists a proper translation which is formally valid.” – “An
inference is valid if it is formally or informally valid.” – An example of an informally valid inference
is:
(a−)
Peter’s speed surpasses Richard’s
Richard’s speed surpasses Spencer’s
Peter’s speed surpasses Spencer’s
For a formal counter-example, replace “speed” by “dog” and “surpasses” by “passes” or “surprises”.
On the other hand, we may say that the argument is properly translated if we replace “surpasses” by
“is greater than” and that in this translation it is formally valid. What is often called the “rational
reconstruction” of an argument is usually an attempt to show – e.g. by giving translation rules such
as definitions, etc. – that it is informally valid. Of course the question whether a certain argument is
informally valid or not can hardly ever be answered without further assumption of a more or less
questionable character, such as intuitive translation rules – and it is hardly possible to give an answer
in the negative except on intuitive grounds. (Informal inference in our sense, it may be noted, has
played a certain role in the discussions of the idea of “entailment”.) In the remainder of the present
paper, we shall confine ourselves to formal validity without explicit mention of the word “formal”.

96
Karl R. Popper
(b′)
All Greeks are wise
Socrates is wise
Socrates is a Greek
This is, clearly, of the same form as (b) and (b+) and should therefore be recognized
as invalid. However, no counter-example can be formulated within L. For, a counter-
example in 𝐿must have true premises of the same skeleton as (b′). But although
true universal statements such as “All Greeks are tall or non-tall”, “All Greeks are
non-Frenchmen”, or “All Greeks who are tall are non-short” etc., exist in 𝐿, no true
statement with the simpler skeleton “All . . . are —” happens to exist. (There exist true
statements with the skeleton “All . . . are . . .” in 𝐿, but only such as would make the
conclusion true.) Thus, within 𝐿, no counter-example exists to (b′), and (b′) would
have to be described as valid from the point of view of our second definition, contrary
to our logical intuition, and contrary also to our third definition which in this point
and, it seems, in all others, agrees with our logical intuition.8 (Of course, if we enrich
the descriptive vocabulary of 𝐿a little, for example, by introducing the new simple
term “personalities”, defined, say, by “tall or short or both”, then we can at once give
a counter-example within 𝐿.)
(4)
Our third definition is, I believe, perfectly satisfactory on intuitive grounds. Neverthe-
less, there are serious objections. These were first urged by Tarski against his own
definition.9
The weak point of our definition is this. Our definition is based, in the last analysis,
upon the fundamental distinction between formative and descriptive signs. (Of all the
technical terms introduced by us, only “statement-preserving interpretation” – and, of
course,“interpretation” – do not presuppose this distinction.) Now this distinction is an
intuitive one, and accordingly vague and uncertain. For example, the words “greater”
and “smaller” (and “equal”) are usually classed (with “identical” and “different”) as
8 The fact that a definition such as (D2) cannot be satisfactorily applied to languages with a poor
dictionary is mentioned in Tarski’s lecture quoted |
271
here in note 1. Tarski’s own definition (which
was the starting point of my investigation) avoids this drawback by combining, as it were, features
of (D1) and (D2). In our terminology, it might be perhaps rendered: “An inference is valid if, and
only if, every state of affairs which satisfies the logical skeleton of the premises satisfies that of the
conclusion.” And by a “state of affairs which satisfies a logical skeleton” (Tarski would call it a
“model” of the skeleton), we would have to think of real things, and their properties and relations
(not of the names of things, or of properties, or of relations, for these may be wanting). Tarski’s
definition is free of the disadvantage (1) discussed in the text, but since it is bound to the logical
skeleton of some (one) language 𝐿, it does not fully share with (D3) the advantages (2) and the
possibilities discussed in the foregoing footnote – at least, not without something like a “rational
reconstruction” which might assimilate it to our conceptual apparatus.
9 For Tarski’s definition, see notes 8 and 1.

2 Logic without Assumptions
97
formative, while the intuitively similar words “taller” and “shorter” are classed as
descriptive. This may be all right, but no satisfactory principle is forthcoming by
which the classification can be justified.
Besides, it is by no means the case that the distinction can be drawn in every
language. Thus mostverbs,suchas “runs” combine formative anddescriptive functions
(of “is” and “running”). But this is only another way |
272
of saying that the distinction
is not applicable to “runs”. Since we have languages in which statements occur
(“Achilles runs”) to which the distinction is inapplicable, it is clear that we may
have whole languages without any term which strikes us intuitively as either purely
formative or purely descriptive.
That there is something more needed than a reliance on an intuitive classification
of the sign of a language may be illustrated by this example:
(c)
Bob sits in the cinema in the same row as Pat, and to the left of Pat
Pat sits in the cinema in the same row as Tim, and to the left of Tim
Bob sits in the cinema in the same row as Tim, and to the left of Tim.
This seems, intuitively, valid; even after constructing something like a counter-
example by substituting “surprise” for “left” do we feel, intuitively, that (c) may be in
order; we feel that the apparent counter-example only sounds like one, and that “to
the left of” and “to the surprise of” have really not the same logical form, because
there is something formative in “left”, as it were. But it is not encouraging to find that
we have no principle at our disposal that may help us to clear up the matter directly.
One thing we have to do is to operate with a somewhat restricted list of formative
signs, and to make sure that there is no ambiguity in our use of these formative signs.
Aristotle moved first in this direction, by restricting his investigation to the language of
“categorical propositions”. He introduced thereby an artificial limitation and rigidity
which is quite foreign to naturally grown languages, but, it seems, necessary if we
wish to construct a theory of inference. A language with such an unnatural rigidity
of its rules may be called an “artificial language” or “calculus”. Modern logicians
have followed Aristotle in confining their discussions to one or the other artificial
language or calculus, and the method, I believe, is practically unavoidable.
|
273
But it does not solve our fundamental problem. The logician who constructs
an artificial language usually lays down a list of formative signs whose meanings
he explains, and he treats all signs which are not in this list, and not definable on
the basis of the list, as descriptive. This method is very successful and need not be
criticized. But the choice of his signs (and their meaning) appears very largely as
arbitrary, or as justified mainly on unanalysable intuitive grounds.
On this choice, however, everything depends in logic. It is clear that, by transferring
a sign – e.g., the word “left” in our last example – so far considered as descriptive,
into the list of formative signs, or vice versa (without altering the intuitive meaning
attached to it), we may alter the logical form of some, or even of all our arguments,
with the result that arguments so far valid become invalid, and vice versa. And this
can be done as long as we have no objective criterion of the formative or descriptive
character of a sign.

98
Karl R. Popper
Our objection may be summed up as follows:
The proposed definition of valid inference may permit us to reduce the intuitive
problem whether a certain inference is valid or not to the problem whether a certain
sign is formative or not. But this problem remains intuitive.
I do not intend to create the impression, by this formulation, that I consider our
definition of validity as futile. On the contrary, it is very valuable. Nevertheless,
the situation is serious. If there is no clear-cut distinction between valid and invalid
inferences, then, it can be shown, there is also no clear-cut distinction between
logical and factual (or empirical) statements, or, to use a more traditional terminology,
between analytic or synthetic propositions. This is a question of major philosophical
importance. One might even say that it involves the whole question of empiricism,
and of scientific method.10

Is our problem insoluble? I do not think so. One way to a possible solution follows
here in outline. It is explained, more fully, in the subsequent sections.
There are inferences – admittedly, so trivial ones that they have hardly ever attracted
much notice – which can be shown, on our definition of validity, to be valid whatever
the logical form of the statements involved. Their validity is thus independent of that
distinction between formative and descriptive signs which we have seen to be of such
a problematic character. We shall say of these inferences that they are absolutely valid.
Absolute validity can be defined in terms of statement-preserving interpretations, and
therefore without referring to the distinction between formative and descriptive signs.
Next we observe that once we have a certain system of absolutely valid rules of
inference at our disposal, it is possible to define the logical force or import of the
various formative signs in terms of deducibility (i.e., in terms of the predicate: “from
the statements 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐. . ., the statement d can be deduced”). We shall call a definition
of a formative sign in terms of this relation an inferential definition.
With the help of the idea of an inferential definition, we can characterise the
formative signs as signs which can be defined by an inferential definition. In this
way we can meet the objections raised against the distinction between formative and
descriptive signs, and re-establish (D3), as it were. Ultimately, we shall propose a
definition (D6) which makes use only of the ideas of absolute validity and of an
inferential definition, and which no longer refers to truth.
10 These important problems, raised by our (or rather by Tarski’s) definition of valid inference, have
been only little discussed, except by Tarski himself – who seems to consider the problem insoluble
– and by Carnap, who takes a more hopeful view of the matter; cp. R. Carnap, Introduction to
Semantics ⟨Carnap, 1942⟩, esp. p. vii, where “the distinction between logical and descriptive signs”
is mentioned, and pp. 56ff.

2 Logic without Assumptions

There are inferences which are valid according to all our definitions, in spite of the
fact that the logical form of the statements involved is irrelevant. They are very trivial
inferences indeed – so trivial that some logicians refused to accept them. Accordingly,
our first task will be to argue that they are valid.
|
275
Consider the example:
(d)
Joe is a kitten
Joe is a kitten
From the point of view of all our definitions (and from the point of view of most
modern systems of logic) this is definitely a valid inference – even though it is
something like an extreme case, or a “zero-case”, as it were. For it is clear that no
counter-example of (d) can exist. Some logicians have objected to calling these cases
“valid inferences” on grounds such as these: inference is a movement of the mind; but
our mind does not move in such cases as (d); thus this cannot be an inference. But
since even these logicians hardly suggest that (d) is actually invalid, not much harm
can be done by calling it an inference. It seems that their objections are due to the
fact that in such zero-cases our intuition is not a reliable guide. (Is zero a number, or
is it not, rather, nothing? Is one a number? No, one thing is just one thing, and not a
number of things! Even two is not a number, but a couple. A number of things are at
least three, it seems.) But there are several reasons why we should call (d) a valid
inference – quite apart from our definition.
One is that it would be awkward to forbid that the middle and major term of a
syllogism may ever coincide, as in the example:
(e)
All kittens are kittens
Joe is a kitten
Joe is a kitten
But if (e) is an inference (and, of course, valid), then we may clearly omit the first
premise as redundant; and in this way we obtain (d).
But there are stronger reasons for accepting (d). There are very strong reasons for
not excluding the possibility of cases of mutual inference (i.e., from a premise to a
conclusion |
276
and also from this conclusion to its premise). A mutual inference can,
of course, have only one premise (since an inference can have only one conclusion),
but we can hardly forbid inferences from one premise, since we can combine several
premises into one by merely joining them with the help of the word “and”. If we forbid
mutual inference, then we can never be sure whether an inference, however convincing,
is valid; for if anybody should later discover an equally convincing argument running
from the conclusion to the premise (or to the conjunction of the premises) then we
would have to declare both inferences invalid.

100
Karl R. Popper
But if mutual inferences are possible, then (d) must be possible too. For there is a
principle of inference which has never been challenged – the transitivity principle
which says that the conclusion 𝑐of a conclusion 𝑏of the premise 𝑎is itself a
conclusion of the premise 𝑎; and this principle if applied to a mutual inference, yields:
(6.1)
“From the statement 𝑎we may deduce 𝑎”,
that is, a rule of inference of which (d) is an observance. In other words, whoever is
not prepared to admit (d) and (6.1) must either forbid mutual inference, which has the
most awkward consequences, or he must give up the following transitivity principle:
(6.2) If from the statement 𝑎we can deduce 𝑏, and if from 𝑏we can deduce 𝑐, then
we can also deduce 𝑐from 𝑎.
We shall therefore rely on our definition of validity and accept (d) and (6.1) as
valid.
But the validity of (d) and (6.1) does clearly not depend on the distinction
between formative and descriptive signs. The fact that no form-preserving counter-
example exists is here a direct consequence of the fact that no statement-preserving
counter-example exists – together with the fact that, of course, all form-preserving
interpretations must be statement-preserving.11
Thus there are valid inferences whose validity does not depend upon the distinction
between formative and |
277
descriptive signs. We shall call these inferences “absolutely
valid”; and we define, tentatively:
(D4) An inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, every statement-preserving
interpretation whose premises are true has a true conclusion.
Or alternatively:
(D4′) An inference is absolutely valid if no statement-preserving counter-example of
it exists.
The field of absolutely valid inferences, and of absolutely valid rules of inference12,
covered by this definition, is somewhat trivial but not at all unimportant. It can be
shown13 that all absolutely valid rules of inference which we shall need for the logic
of statements – and there are many and even somewhat complicated rules among
them – can be reduced to two – the one a generalization of (6.1) and the other ⟨a⟩
generalization of (6.2). By “reduced”, I mean here: every inference which is an
observance of some of the rules in question can be shown to be an observance of
these two rules – obtained, possibly, by applying them many times in succession,
which is permitted by the generalized transitivity rule (6.2g) itself.
In order to formulate these two rules more easily, we introduce the following
abbreviation: we shall write
11 The definition of “statement-preserving counter-example” (cp. “form-preserving counter-example”)
is obvious, in view of section (2).
12 The definition is again obvious: a rule of inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, every inference
drawn in observance of it is absolutely valid.
13 Cp. my “New Foundations for Logic,” forthcoming in Mind, 1947 ⟨as Popper, 1947c⟩.

101
“𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐. . . /𝑑”
instead of “from the premises 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐. . ., the conclusion 𝑑can be deduced”; and we
shall write
“𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏”
instead of “from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, the conclusion 𝑏can be deduced”. (Note
that our variables “𝑎”, “𝑏”, “𝑎1”, etc., are variable names of statements, i.e., that only
names of statements may be substituted for them, but not the statements themselves;
this distinguishes these variables from the so-called propositional variables of the
calculus of propositions.)
|
278
With the help of this notation, we can write our two generalized rules:
(6.1g)
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖,
provided 𝑎𝑖is identical with one of the 𝑛statements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛(in symbols:
provided that 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛).
(6.2g) If, from the 𝑛premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛taken together, each of the 𝑚statements
𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚can be separately derived, then,
if 𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐then 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
These two rules, or rather the system consisting of these two rules, can be easily
shown to be absolutely valid and therefore, a fortiori, valid. They are all the absolutely
valid rules needed for the proof that our final definitions are adequate for the logic
of proper statements. In order to extend our results to statement functions, we need
another set of trivial rules which can easily be shown to be absolutely valid, and
which allow us to operate with the idea of the result of substituting, in some statement
function one variable for another. In order to indicate the character of these rules,
I shall use the symbol “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” as an abbreviation of “the result for substituting the
variable 𝑦for the variable 𝑥in the statement function 𝑎”.14 The trivial rules mentioned
are all of the character of
(6.3)
If 𝑥= 𝑦, then 𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 and 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑎.
The triviality of this rule will be realized by considering that, if 𝑥= 𝑦, the result
of substituting 𝑦for 𝑥in 𝑎leaves 𝑎completely unchanged; or in other words, that
(6.4)
𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
/𝑎.
Accordingly, 𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
 and 𝑎will be mutually deducible, whatever the logical form of
𝑎may be; and this is what |
279
(6.3) asserts. If we abbreviate “mutually deducible” by
“//”, defining:
(6.5)
𝑎//𝑏if, and only if, 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎,
then we can write (6.3) as follows
14 The symbols “𝑥” and “𝑦” are (variable) names of variables.

102
Karl R. Popper
(6.6)
𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
//𝑎.
The triviality of (6.6) is, in view of (6.4), quite obvious.
The rules of inference (6.3) and (6.6) are clearly not only valid, but absolutely valid.
For there can be no interpretation which preserves statements, including statement
functions, and which renders 𝑎by a true statement, but not 𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
 which, in view of
(6.4) is only another name for 𝑎.15
Our concept of absolute validity, we have seen, is independent of the problematic
distinction between formative and descriptive signs. In addition, it is also possible
to define it in such a manner that the much less problematic concept of truth is also
avoided. For it turns out that a great many properties of statements can replace “true”
in our definition – among them such trivial properties as “containing less than five
words (or signs)”, for which we shall briefly say “short”. The properties which may
replace truth can be called freely interpretable properties, or briefly, free properties.
Intuitively speaking,16 a property is called “free” if we are free to choose (by an
appropriate choice |
280
of the translation rules) for any individual statement 𝑎1 of 𝐿1,
whether or not it shall be interpreted by a statement which possesses the property in
question. The strict definition of “free property” (given in note 16) makes use of the
term “statement-preserving interpretation”, but does not use any specific name of a
free property, such as “short” or “true”.
Now it can be shown17 that if every statement-preserving interpretation transmits
one free property in a certain argument, then it transmits all free properties in this
argument. This allows us to replace (D4) by:
(D5) An inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, there exists at least one free
property such that every statement-preserving interpretation whose premises
all possess this free property has a conclusion with the same free property.
This definition avoids the term “truth”; but in the presence of the definition of
“free property”, and in view of the fact that “true” designates a free property, we can
obtain (D4) from (D5).18
15 Note that, in these considerations, we never assume anything about the logical form of 𝑎(not
even that it is a function rather than a proper statement). For a list of similarly trivial rules which are
needed for developing the logic of functions and which can all be shown to be absolutely valid, see
rules (6.1) to (6.6) of my New Foundations for Logic ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩. Cp. note 13.
16 The strict definition is: “A property of statements is a free property if, and only if, to every arbitrary
division of the statements of 𝐿1 into two exclusive classes 𝐴and 𝐵,there exists a statement-preserving
interpretation which interprets all statements of 𝐴by statements which possess the property in
question and all statements of 𝐵by statements which do not possess it.” – As an illustration, I
may also mention two examples of properties of a statement 𝑎𝑚which are not free: (1) “𝑎𝑚is a
statement of 𝐿𝑚.” – (2) “𝑎𝑚does not occur in text 𝑥after 𝑏𝑛.”
17 With the help of the fact that the relation designated by “statement-preserving interpretation” is
transitive.
18 The transition from (D4) to (D5), including its effect on (D6), corresponds roughly to the
transition from Truth Tables to abstract Matrices, in the sense of Łukasiewicz and Tarski. In Carnap’s
terminology, it may be described as one from General Semantics to General Syntax, since “true”
is a Semantical concept, while “short” is Syntactical; “free property” is also Syntactical, for it is
defined merely with the help of “statement-preserving interpretation” which, in view of section

2 Logic without Assumptions
103
Absolute validity cannot replace validity; its main advantage is that its definition
is free from the objections we raised (following Tarski’s suggestions) against our
definition of validity. But before going any further, we may ask whether there are not
analogous objections left. Admittedly, absolute validity does no longer depend on the
distinction between formative and descriptive signs. But |
281
does it not depend upon
the distinction between statements and non-statements? And is this distinction not as
intuitive as the other?
The answer to this last question must be “yes”. But the situation is, nevertheless,
not analogous to the one we have laboured so hard to avoid. Intuitive doubts about the
distinction of formative and descriptive signs may arise even in connection with an
artificial language. As opposed to this, any doubt whether or not a certain expression
of an artificial language is a statement can hardly arise on intuitive grounds. (If at
all, then it arises as a very definite problem of reconstruction, for example, in order
to avoid certain paradoxes.) But the main difference between the two problems is
this: the distinction between formative and descriptive languages affects our central
problem – validity. A given inference may be valid or invalid, according to the way
we draw the line. This is never the case with the other distinction. It cannot affect the
decision as to the validity or invalidity of some given inference; it can only affect the
question whether a certain sequence of expressions is an inference (valid or invalid)
or no inference at all.
The problem of validity is always: given that this is an inference – is it valid? It is
clear that the two questions – the one of characterizing the formative signs, the other
of characterizing the statements – have a very different status relative to this problem.
And while the solutions of the problems of validity and of formative signs are closely
interdependent, I do not believe that the problem of validity and that of statements
are likely to affect each other in any way.19
(7)
Absolute validity cannot, of course, replace validity. Its definition may be free from
flaws, but this advantage is bought at a high price. Absolute validity, one is tempted
to say, is a property of inferences which are absolutely trivial.
|
282
We have therefore to return to the problem of validity, and with it, to that of
formative signs. But we return to these problems with means of solving them. By our
definition of absolute validity, we have acquired the right to operate freely with all
(1), appears to by a Syntactical term (as opposed to “form-preserving interpretation” into whose
definition the Semantic idea of a proper translation enters). But, it may be asked, what about our
assertion that truth is a free property? And what about the derivation of (D4) from (D5)? Altogether,
I am very doubtful whether the distinction between Semantics and Syntax really fits our approach
which is very largely meta-metalinguistic. (Our term “valid” belongs to the meta-metalanguage.)
Yet we may perhaps describe the transition in question as a change of emphasis from the Semantics
of Semantics to the Semantics of Syntax.
19 Cp. note 4.

kinds of rules of inference, as long as these do not refer to the logical form of the
statements involved.
With these means at our disposal, we can not yet define what we mean when we
say:
“𝑎is the negation of 𝑏”
or perhaps
“𝑎is the disjunction of 𝑏and 𝑐”.
But we do possess the means of defining what we mean when we say:
“𝑎has the same (logical) force as a negation of 𝑏”
or perhaps
“𝑎has the same (logical) force as a disjunction of 𝑏and 𝑐”.
We can express the phrase “𝑎has the same (logical) force as 𝑏” (or “𝑎is equivalent
to 𝑏”) with the help of the symbol “//”, by “𝑎//𝑏”, which has been defined above
(6.5) as mutual deducibility. There is an alternative definition of equivalence, viz.:
(7.1)
𝑎//𝑏if, and only if, for every 𝑐: 𝑎/𝑐if, and only if, 𝑏/𝑐.
Now just as this defines the phrase: “𝑎has the same force as 𝑏, whatever the
logical form of 𝑎and 𝑏may be”, so we can also define the phrase: “𝑎has the same
force as the negation of 𝑏, whatever the logical form of 𝑎and 𝑏may be” by:20
(7.2) 𝑎//the negation of 𝑏if, and only if, for every 𝑐: 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and, if 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏then 𝑐/𝑏.
|
283
Similarly we can define:
(7.3) 𝑎//the disjunction of 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 if, and only if,
for every 𝑐1 and 𝑐2: 𝑎, 𝑐1/𝑐2 if, and only if, 𝑏1, 𝑐1/𝑐2 and 𝑏2, 𝑐1/𝑐2.
I shall not discuss the adequacy of these and the other definitions mentioned here,
since this follows from material I have given elsewhere21. I may mention, however,
20 (7.2) defines classical negation; if we replace the last phrase of (7.2) by “if 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑎then 𝑐/𝑎” we
obtain the negation belonging to Heyting’s intuitionistic calculus. Both definitions can be proffered
at the same time, but if in one language, a classical as well as an intuitionistic negation exists of every
statement, then the latter becomes equivalent to the former, or in other words, classical negation then
absorbs or assimilates its weaker kin. This remark follows from the observations made in my paper
quoted in note 13 upon rule 4.2e, and modifies one made in that paper; but the negation belonging
to Johansson’s “Minimum Calculus”, is not absorbed by classical negation; and the same holds for
the following definition of a negation which seems to agree excellently with intuitionistic intentions,
although it is not equivalent with that of Heyting’s calculus: “𝑎//the impossibility of 𝑏if, and only if,
for every 𝑐: 𝑎/𝑐or 𝑏/𝑐, and if 𝑏/𝑎, then 𝑐/𝑎.” (This definition is no longer “purely derivational”;
this fact marks the transition to modal logic.)
21 Cp. note 13. For propositional logic, one definition – apart from (7.1) – is sufficient: “𝑎//the
alternative denial of 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 if, and only if, for every 𝑐1: 𝑐1/𝑏1 and 𝑐1/𝑏2 and 𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑐1, if and
only if, for every 𝑐2: 𝑎, 𝑐1/𝑐2 and if 𝑎, 𝑐2/𝑐1 then 𝑐2/𝑐1.” Combined with (7.4) this suffices for
functional logic; and combined with the definition at the end of note 20, for modal logic (whether
propositional or functional).

2 Logic without Assumptions
105
that the two definitions (7.2) and (7.3), form a sufficient basis for propositional logic –
say, for Russell’s system, and that we can give similar definitions for all the known
compounds of propositional logic.
In order to provide for functional logic, we define universal and existential
quantification by a similar method. One of them is sufficient, in the presence of (7.2);
we choose existential quantification:22
(7.4) Provided 𝑥is distinct from 𝑦,
𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
//the result of the existential quantification with respect to 𝑥of 𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
 if, and
only if, for every 𝑐: 𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑦
𝑥
 if, and only if, 𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐 𝑦
𝑥
.
The definitions given here form a sufficient basis of propositional and (the lower)
functional logic, in a sense which will be explained; but they are given only as
illustrations of our method. We can, by this method, give many |
284
more definitions;
not only of the logical force of certain formative signs, but also definitions of such
matters as the exclusiveness (or contradictoriness) of a number of statements, and
of their exhaustiveness (or “logical disjunctness”, to use Carnap’s expression). For
simplicity’s sake, we confine ourselves to two statements, 𝑎1 and 𝑎2:
(7.5) 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 are exclusive if, and only if,
for every 𝑏1 and 𝑏2: if 𝑏1/𝑎1 then, if 𝑏1/𝑎2 then 𝑏1/𝑏2.
(7.6) 𝑎1 and 𝑎2 are exhaustive if, and only if,
for every 𝑏1 and 𝑏2: if 𝑎1/𝑏2 then, if 𝑎2/𝑏2 then 𝑏1/𝑏2.
These concepts23 are interesting since they provide us with a definition of comple-
mentarity:
(7.7) 𝑎//the complement of 𝑏if, and only if, 𝑎and 𝑏are exhaustive as well as
exclusive.
Now on the basis of (7.2) and (7.7) it can be shown that, if 𝑎1//the negation of 𝑏,
and 𝑎2//the complement of 𝑏, then 𝑎1//𝑎2.
Had we known this before, we need not have defined “complement”; “negation”
would have done just as well. Until, however, an equivalence between two definitions
such as (7.2) and (7.7) is established, we must always be careful to use different
names. But this, indeed, is the main precaution necessary. We need not make sure,
in any other way, that our system of definitions is consistent. For example, we may
define (introducing an arbitrarily chosen name “opponent”):
(7.8)
𝑎//the opponent of 𝑏if, and only if, for every 𝑐: 𝑏/𝑎and 𝑎/𝑐.
22 It is understood that two rules are at our disposal (because of their absolute validity) which are
described, in my “New Foundations,” as “rules of substitution”, and which read, in the notation of
that paper:
“(𝐸𝑦𝑏)  𝑦
𝑥
//𝐸𝑥(𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
)” and “If 𝑦/𝑧then: (𝐸𝑧𝑏)  𝑦
𝑥
//𝐸𝑧(𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
)”.
Alternatively, a supplementary definition yielding these two rules may be added to (7.4).
23 Their extension to 𝑛statements may be indicated by: “𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are exhaustive if, and only
if, for every 𝑏1 and 𝑏2, if 𝑎1/𝑏2 then, if 𝑎2/𝑏2 then, . . . if 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2, then 𝑏1/𝑏2.”

106
Karl R. Popper
This definition has the consequence that every language which has a sign for
“opponent of 𝑏” – analogous to the sign for “negation of 𝑏” – will be inconsistent (i.e.
every one of its statements will be paradoxical). But this need not lead us to abandon
(7.8); it only means that no consistent language will have a sign for “opponent of 𝑏”.
|
285
Each of our definitions gives rise to a number of rules of inference. For example,
(7.1) gives rise to the rule:
(7.91)
If 𝑎//𝑏, then 𝑏/𝑎.
Similarly (7.2) gives rise to
(7.92)
If 𝑎//the negation of 𝑏, then if 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏, then 𝑐/𝑏.
And (7.3) gives rise to
(7.93)
If 𝑎//the disjunction of 𝑏1 and 𝑏2, then 𝑏1/𝑎and 𝑏2/𝑎.
To every of these rules we may add: “whatever the logical form of the statements
involved may be”.
All these rules are absolutely valid. (That is to say, if they are added to 6.1g and
6.2g, the resulting system is absolutely valid.) Why? Because no statement-preserving
counter-example can be found. Consider (7.91): since we have laid down, in effect,
that we can replace “𝑎//𝑏” by “𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎”, we can in (7.91) replace “If 𝑎//𝑏then”
by “If 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎then”; and it is clear that no statement-preserving counter-example
can be found to any inference drawn in observance of the resulting rule. The same
holds for all other rules of this kind.
Since we may consider the definitions themselves as rules, we may say, therefore,
that they are all absolutely valid. Whether the concepts they define are adequately
defined, is a different matter; this will depend upon our intentions. If, for example, we
intend to define conjunction (or rather, its logical force) and use the right hand side of
our definition of disjunction (7.3) for this purpose, then we shall have an inadequate
definition. But the definition will, nevertheless, define something – namely just what
we usually would call “disjunction” rather than “conjunction”.
So much about these definitions. We now turn to the problem of formative signs,
and of valid inference. We define:
(7.2D) The language 𝐿1 contains a (preceding or succeeding) sign of negation if, and
only if, it contains a sign which, if joined to any statement 𝑏of 𝐿1 (placed
before 𝑏, or placed after 𝑏) forms a new statement 𝑎of 𝐿1, such that this
resulting statement 𝑎//the negation of 𝑏, in the sense of (7.2).
|
286
Note that, according to this definition, 𝐿1 may contain more than one sign of
negation.
(7.3D) The language 𝐿1 contains a (preceding, or intervening, or succeeding) sign
of disjunction if, and only if, it contains a sign which, if joined to any pair
of statements 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 of 𝐿1 (placed before 𝑏1 followed by 𝑏2, or placed
between 𝑏1 and 𝑏2, or placed after 𝑏2 preceded by 𝑏1) forms a new statement

2 Logic without Assumptions
107
𝑎of 𝐿1, such that this resulting statement 𝑎//the disjunction of 𝑏1 and 𝑏2, in
the sense of (7.3).
In the same way, we may define the other formative signs; we can define them as
signs which, in certain contexts, form statements of a defined logical force.
Definitions such as (7.2D) and (7.3D) may be called inferential definitions. They
are characterized by the fact that they define a formative sign by its logical force
which is defined, in turn, by a definition in terms of inference (i.e. of “/”).
It is now easy to define the term “formative sign”.
A sign s of a language 𝐿1 is a formative sign if, and only if, s can be defined by an
inferential definition.
According to this definition of the term “formative sign”, the question whether
a certain sign 𝑠used in a certain way is formative remains an open question until
someone either produces an inferential definition of 𝑠or shows, by some method or
other, that such a definition does not exist (as can indeed be done in certain cases, for
example, the negation sign of Johansson’s minimum calculus). But the remark that this
question may remain open does not constitute an objection against our definition; and
especially the fact that inferential definitions of the intuitively recognized formative
signs of propositional, functional, and even modal logic can be given (as has been
shown) establishes, it seems, the adequacy of our definition of the term “formative
sign”.
I believe that this definition solves, fundamentally, our crucial problem. It provides
a rational basis for the distinction between formative and descriptive signs; and
with this, the objections of section (4) can now be met. Our definition achieves,
however, more than this result. It |
287
also shows the rationality of the idea of a form-
preserving interpretation, since it makes it clear that a form-preserving interpretation
does not depend on the intuitive knowledge possessed by a translator – his intuitive
knowledge of the meaning of the formative signs of a language. For we see now that
precise translation rules for formative signs can be obtained from their definitions,
because they are defined with the help of rules of inference which are absolutely
valid, and because absolute validity, in its turn, depends merely upon the idea of
statement-preserving interpretations, which does not presuppose a knowledge of
languages.
We can therefore now adopt the wording of (D3) as our final definition of valid
inference. Of course, the words of (D3) have, in view of our new results, acquired a
somewhat different meaning, namely, a more precise one.
But it seems that we can, if we wish, go further; it seems that we can avoid, in view
of (D5), even the reference to truth which occurs in the wording of (D3), by defining:
(D6) An inference is valid if, and only if, it is either absolutely valid, or it can be
shown, on the basis of the inferential definition of the formative signs, to have
been drawn in observance of absolutely valid rules (including those which
define the logical force of the statements involved).
The wording of this definition should be capable of some improvement, but the
idea, I think, is clear; and considering the actual techniques of establishing valid rules
of inference (indicated in my paper quoted in note 13) it seems to be adequate. A new

108
Karl R. Popper
problem arises, however, in connection with this definition, viz. to prove, as can be
done in the case of (D5) and (D4), that (D6) actually yields (D3), that is, guarantees
the transmission of truth. But this problem must be left for another occasion.
(8)
An objection which may have troubled the reader for some time may now be briefly
discussed. Is not our procedure rather circular? We assert that the validity of the
logical rules of inference follows from certain definitions. |
288
This may be so; but does
not this derivation assume the validity of some rules of inference – and probably just
of those which are to be derived?
This objection cannot be discussed here in full, for that would mean a disquisition
on the distinction between languages and metalanguages, of the general status of any
metalinguistic investigation, and, more particularly, of any logical investigation. But
a very brief answer may be attempted.
If we investigate such problems as the way in which two statements, 𝑎and 𝑏,
are related – whether the one follows from the other, or contradicts the other, or is
complementary to it, etc. – then we are investigating certain objects which are parts
of some language, i.e. linguistic objects. If we wish to study linguistic objects, we
must discuss them, and make statements about them, as with all other objects. If
we use our language in order to discuss linguistic objects, then we say that we use
our language as a metalanguage. The language which we study is called the object
language (or language under investigation).
Now it is important to realize that we cannot at the same time use a word, or a
statement, or an argument, and study it; and also that the study of words or statements
presupposes the unhampered, although careful, use of some language in precisely the
same way as the study of trees or of mental processes or of music.
It is for this reason that we should never attempt to reflect on our metalanguage
while we are analysing an object language; and it is for this reason that we should not
attempt to analyse the arguments we are using while engaged in analysing the rules
of argumentation.
Indeed, if this were not so, then all logical investigation would be impossible. For
if we wish to study something, we can, clearly, not begin by giving up the use of all
argumentation; and logic is no exception to this rule.
In deriving rules of inference from definitions, we cannot, of course, avoid using
inferential arguments, just as in studying plants or animals. After we have done our
job, we may |
289
then analyse the inferential arguments used. This is a legitimate and
interesting new problem, but it is quite different from the original problem – that of
deriving certain rules from certain definitions.
If we actually analyse (using a meta-metalanguage) the procedure used before in
the metalanguage, then we find that there is no circularity involved. Surely, we must
know how to use our metalanguage when studying the rules of inference of certain
object languages (as we did), and surely, we must know how to draw inferences in

2 Logic without Assumptions
109
the metalanguage while engaged in these studies. But we do not formulate the rules
we are using, and these rules, therefore, never appear as premises in our derivations.
But only if they did could we speak of circularity.
This situation would not be affected if, for example, we might have to use negation
(say, the word “not”) while discussing negation. But we actually find, when we
investigate our metalanguage, that it is possible to carry out our investigations in the
metalanguage without using negation or rules of inference pertaining to negation;
and this example, surely, reaffirms the view that our investigation is not circular.
(9)
We have, so far, only indicated how the well-known rules of inference of logic can
be derived, not from assumptions such as primitive rules, but from definitions. In
conclusion, I shall briefly mention how the logical theorems of a language (for
example the well-known tautologies of the calculus of propositions, including, of
course, the primitive propositions or axioms) can be obtained from our definitions
without further assumption (such as the assumption of primitive propositions or
axioms).
The procedure is based on a new definition – the definition of logical demonstra-
bility, or more precisely, of “𝑎is (logically) demonstrable”:
(9.1) 𝑎is demonstrable if, and only if, 𝑎can be validly inferred from any statement
𝑏whatsoever.
|
290
This definition may seem at first intuitively rather puzzling. But it only gives a
precise form, in terms of valid inference, to the somewhat vague intuitive idea that
a statement 𝑎is logically demonstrable if, and only if, it is true merely because of
its logical form. That 𝑎is true merely because of its logical form can be expressed,
more clearly, by saying that all statements of the same logical form must be true. But
this means that no form-preserving interpretation of 𝑎can be false, and therefore,
that no inference with the conclusion 𝑎can be invalid, whatever the premises may
be; for if no form-preserving interpretation of 𝑎can be false, then it is clear that no
form-preserving counter-example can be found.
There are other arguments to show that our definition (9.1) is in keeping with the
intuitive idea of demonstration or proof, and that it brings out a distinction between
derivation (i.e., non-demonstrative inference) and demonstration which has been
often neglected by logicians.24
A derivation never establishes the truth of the conclusion. It only establishes the
24 The distinction between derivation and proof has been emphasized by Carnap (in his Logical
Syntax, ⟨Carnap, 1934a⟩and ⟨Carnap, 1937⟩, as well as in his Introduction to Semantics ⟨Carnap,
1942⟩). Our treatment agrees fundamentally with his results but goes beyond them, in so far as
our treatment of the theory of derivation is quite independent of the fact whether or not there are
demonstrable statements in the language under consideration, while Carnap’s treatment of derivation
makes essential use of certain rules of derivation which are only re-formulations of axioms; cp. his
Introduction,⟨Carnap, 1942⟩p. 167, and his Formalization of Logic, ⟨Carnap, 1943,⟩p. 9.

110
Karl R. Popper
fact that the question whether or not the conclusion is true can be shifted back to the
question whether or not the premises are all true. Thus, if we find that the conclusion
is false, this does not show that the argument, the derivation is invalid – it only shows
that at least one of the premises must be false.
With a proof it is different. If somebody tells us that he has proved 𝑎, and we find
that 𝑎is false, then, clearly, something must have been wrong with the argument, with
the proof. In other words, we use the word “proof” intuitively in such a way that a
proof must be invalid if the proved statement is false. A counter-example establishing
|
291
the invalidity of a derivation must consist of true premises and a false conclusion.
For a counter-example establishing the invalidity of a proof, it suffices to show that
the conclusion (or a form-preserving interpretation of it) is false.
We see that a proof, as opposed to a derivation, does not assert the truth of
the conclusion provided the premises are true, but that it asserts the truth of the,
conclusion absolutely – independently of the question whether any particular other
statement is true. The dependance upon any particular premise is, as it were, thrown
off. Our definition shows how this is possible. If a statement is provable whenever
it is derivable from any premise whatsoever then, if we suspect the truth of one
premise, we can always replace it by another. The conclusion does no longer depend
on any particular premise or set of premises, or on any particular assumption – it is
established under all possible assumptions, under all possible circumstances. Since it
can be derived from any description of facts, it must be true whatever the facts are, or
independently of all facts.
But the strongest reason for accepting (9.1) as a satisfactory definition of logical
demonstrability is that, if we accept this definition, we can show, in our metalanguage,
on the basis of our definitions and without any further assumption, that all the well-
known primitive propositions or axioms of the various logical calculi, and with them,
of course, the theorems, are demonstrable.
Besides we can show that those methods which have been usually called proofs
(such as the indirect proof, or the reductio ad absurdum) are indeed demonstrations
in the sense of our definition, that is to say, that they establish the demonstrability of
their conclusions, as opposed, for example, to syllogisms, the modus ponens, etc.,
which are not demonstrations but merely derivations.
As an interesting minor result it turns out that the dilemma differs from most of
the other classical arguments in being a method or figure of demonstration and not
a figure of derivation, such as the syllogism – in spite of the fact that it has been
treated, under the name of “syllogismus |
292
cornutus”, as if it had the same status as the
categorical or the hypothetical syllogism.
Philosophically of greater interest is perhaps the result that, while valid demon-
strations must not be circular – they must throw off any dependence upon any
specific premise –, derivations are always circular; indeed, our analysis shows that
all derivations are based upon absolutely valid rules, which are clearly circular (cp.
example (d) and rule (6.1) in section 6), and upon inferential definitions, which cannot
be the means of establishing anything new. The point is interesting in view of Mill’s

2 Logic without Assumptions
111
much discussed criticism of the syllogism.b Syllogisms are, of course, circular; they
must be so since they are derivations; and any suggestion that the circle is vicious
only reveals that they are mistaken for demonstrations.
To sum up, it is possible to construct a general metalinguistic theory of logic,
applicable to any ⟨objectlanguage⟩c,without assuming a distinction between formative
and descriptive signs, without assuming anything like the customary primitive rules
of inference, or any primitive propositions or axioms; and this construction is based
on definitions which, in the last analysis, go back to the somewhat trivial concept of a
statement-preserving interpretation.

1. Introduction1
193
Logic ought to be simple; and, in a way, even trivial. Complications in logic all arise
from two sources. Reiterated applications of trivialities may result, in the end, in
such complexity that the thread is lost, as it were, and that one has to resort to the
laborious method of carefully checking every step in order to ensure that all is well.
A minute analysis is thus often made necessary, and this creates the other source of
complication – the need for a high degree of precision in the formulation even of
trivialities.
1 This paper is a report and a discussion of some results obtained by the author during the last ten
years. Formal proofs are avoided here but they will be published elsewhere. A knowledge of symbolic
logic is not assumed; on the contrary, it may be necessary to warn readers against the attempt to
identify our theory of compound statements and quantification with the calculi of propositions
or functions. Our theory is more general: we do not construct one calculus or language, but we
investigate a wide range of languages, among them some that do not contain any distinct symbols
corresponding to those symbols which play such a role in the calculus of propositions and in similar
calculi.

It is assumed here that the central topic of logic is the theory of formal or deductive
inference (or of derivability; or of deducibility; or of logical consequence: all these
expressions are here taken to mean the same thing). We shall first attempt to determine
this notion of logical derivation or derivability by laying down a few very simple
primitive rules for it. This will be done in sections 2 and 3.
In spite of the triviality of these rules, the concept of derivability thus determined
turns out to provide an exceedingly powerful instrument. It will be shown that with
its help, we can draw up systems of rules of inference which cover not only |
194
the
theory of compound statements (corresponding to the “calculus of propositions”) but
also the theory of quantification, that is to say, of universal and existential statements
(corresponding to the “lower functional calculus”).
But we shall go even further. Surveying our system of rules of inference, we shall
find that it is possible to lay down definitions of all the logical concepts, if we take
derivability as our sole undefined specifically logical concept. But this means that all
these other concepts,2 in principle even though not in practice, can be dispensed with,
and that the primitive rules of sections 2 and 3, in spite of their triviality, somehow
cover the whole of the theory of inference.
2. General Theory of Derivation
If we wish to discuss rules which tell us under what circumstances a certain statement
– the conclusion – follows from certain other statements – the premises –, then we
have first to come to an agreement how to write such rules.
Take “𝑎”; “𝑏”; “𝑐”; . . . to be names of statements; then we can writea
𝑎
𝑏
𝑐
𝑑
or something like it, in order to express the assertion: “From the premises, 𝑎, 𝑏, and
𝑐the conclusion 𝑑can be derived.” This manner of writing a rule of derivation is
known from traditional logic, where one often writes rules of inference (or “moods”)
in this way; for example, the modus ponendo ponens is often written:
If A then B
A
B
2 Except the concept “the result of substituting 𝑥for 𝑦in the formula 𝑎” which is introduced, in
section 6, by way of a few exceedingly trivial primitive rules of inference (and which may be said to
be implicitly definable in terms of derivability).
a In Popper (1947c) the following two derivations are inside quotation marks.

which may be read: “From the premise ‘If A then B’ together with the premise A, the
conclusion B can be derived.”3
|
195
In order to save space, and to make our way of writing less clumsy, we shall
use here a slightly different notation; the main difference being that we shall write
everything in one line, using the symbol “/” instead of the horizontal line; we shall,
furthermore, use commas in order to divide the various premises, instead of writing
them in different lines. In other words, the notation:
“𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑”
will be used in order to express the assertion: “From the statements 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, the
statement 𝑑can be derived.”
Very often we shall have to discuss inferences from many premises. Let 𝑛be the
number of the premises we are considering. Then the expression:
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏”
will be used for conveying the assertion: “From the statements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, 𝑎3, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, the
statement 𝑏can be derived.”
The sign “/” designates the specifically logical concept of deducibility whose
importance was emphasised in the Introduction. It should be noted that, although
we may operate with as many premises as we like, we draw only one conclusion at a
time; in other words, an expression such as “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏, 𝑐” has no meaning for us,
as we are using our notation. If we wish to assert that 𝑏as well as 𝑐follows from
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, then we have to say: “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏and 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐”.
Having explained our notation, we proceed to the discussion of actual rules of
derivation. The most trivial and at the same time the simplest rule of inference is
undoubtedly
(2.1)
𝑎/𝑎
in words: “From the statement 𝑎, the statement 𝑎can be derived.”
This rule is so trivial that many classical logicians have hesitated to admit it. They
have felt that nothing could be gained by admitting it, and that the dignity of the
procedure of inference would be imperilled if this were called an inference. But these
considerations are irrelevant. Since the rule is, obviously4, not invalid, we should
have to admit it even if it were useless. But, contrary to first impressions, it is far
from being useless: within those more subtle analyses of more complicated threads
to which we referred in the first section, it turns out to be exceedingly useful; and it is
even characteristic, altogether, of the triviality of the fundamental rules from which
the edifice of logic arises. We should, furthermore, keep in mind that triviality of the
3 For a precise rendering, Quine’s signs for so-called “quasi quotation” should be used instead of
our single quotation marks. But since we shall not make any use of this device in what follows, it
seems preferable not to burden the reader with it.

assumptions is an advantage rather than a disadvantage, provided that what
we obtain, at the end, is adequate for our purpose.
Another trivial valid rule is the following:
(2.2)
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑏
which can be translated into: “If an inference is valid, then adding a new premise
does not make it invalid.” Indeed, the addition of new premises can only strengthen
the premises, – just as an omission, in general, weakens them. (“Strengthening” and
“weakening” will be defined and discussed later in this section.)
A third triviality is that the order of the premises does not affect the validity of the
inference. This leads us to lay down the rule
(2.3)
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏then 𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏.
This rule permits us to reverse the order of the premises; by itself, it does not allow
us to put the premises into any desired order. But, combined with the previous two
rules, and with one (the principle of transitivity) which we shall soon discuss, it does,
in fact, allow us to achieve precisely this. (This fact can be established; but we omit
all such proofs in this paper.)
Before proceeding to the discussion of a more complicated rule, the principle
of the transitivity of derivability, it should be mentioned that the three rules so far
explained, i.e., 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3, can (in the presence of the transitivity principle) be
replaced by one single rule, of about equal simplicity, viz., the following:
“From the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, we can derive, as a conclusion, any statement 𝑎𝑖
which is one of the premises, i.e., for which 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛.” This can be expressed in our
notation by
(2.4)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛).
The notation might perhaps irritate some who are not used to this kind of thing;
but it is only the notation which makes this rule appear less trivial than the others;
the idea is simplicity itself, and the rule, obviously, is valid. For if (as we asserted)
the order of the premises is irrelevant; if adding to them only strengthens them, and
does not invalidate the inference; and if
𝑎/𝑎
is valid, then, obviously,
(2.41)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1
must be valid, and also
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎2
|
197
provided 𝑛is, at least, equal to two; and also

3 New Foundations for Logic
117
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎3
provided 𝑛is at least equal to three; and generally we have 2.4, i.e.,
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
provided 𝑛is at least equal to 𝑖, which is precisely what we express by the condition
“1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛”. We shall call 2.4 the “generalised principle of reflexivity” and refer to it
by “(Rg)”, i.e., generalised reflexivity principle.
We now turn to the principle of transitivity. In its simplest form, this rule can be
expressed by
(2.5)
If 𝑎/𝑏, then: if 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑎/𝑐
or in words: “If 𝑏follows from 𝑎, then: if 𝑐follows from 𝑏, then 𝑐follows from 𝑎.”
We shall refer to it by “(Ts)”, i.e., “simplest Transitivity principle”.
This rule (Ts), although perhaps slightly less trivial, is still very simple. In the next
section, we shall indicate5 a method by which it can be retained in the simple form in
which we have introduced it here. This method, however, makes use of a new concept,
that of the conjunction of two statements, – say, the statement 𝑎and the statement 𝑏.
The introduction of this concept simplifies certain things very considerably – this is,
indeed, the reason why it is introduced. But it goes hand in hand with a restriction of
the generality of our approach. This is a serious step which should not be taken before
we have seen how far we can get with our present method. Besides, only if we see
that things get a little complicated can we appreciate the simplification achieved by
the new method. We shall therefore proceed to explain the more complicated forms
of the rule of transitivity which are needed in many inferences.
But we shall first introduce here some linguistic abbreviations. We shall write in
our rules sometimes “→” instead of “if . . . then . . .”; for example, we shall write a
rule like 2.2 sometimes:
(2.2+)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑏
or the rule 2.3:
(2.3+)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏.
The introduction of the sign “→” for “if . . . then . . .” is a very different matter from
the introduction of a new logical concept. It is merely an abbreviation; and in order to
emphasise this fact, we shall quite frequently revert to our ordinary way of writing.
|
198
It is important to keep this in mind, and not to think that we introduce a logical
symbolism in an underhand manner. (A new logical sign must be introduced explicitly
by a rule or by rules determining its use. The only specifically logical sign we have
so far introduced is “/”, and we are still busy explaining the rules, such as 2.1, 2.2,
2.3, etc., which determine its use.)
5 Cp. ⟨footnote 13⟩. ⟨Footnote added in the Errata.⟩

118
Karl R. Popper
If we use our new abbreviation, rule 2.5, that is to say (Ts), becomes:
(2.5+)
𝑎/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎/𝑐).
The brackets correspond to the colon of the original formulation.
Apart from “→” we shall make use of “&”, in the usual way, as abbreviation for
“and”; again, we shall indicate the informal character of this arrangement by reserving
the right of continuing to write “and” whenever we like.
We now proceed to the more complicated forms of the transitivity principle.
The simple form discussed so far allows us only to handle cases of inference from
one premise. It can be extended to the case of more than one premise by writing,
instead of 2.5+:
(2.5e)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
In words: “If the statement 𝑏follows from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, then, if 𝑐
follows from 𝑏, 𝑐also follows from 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.” We shall refer to this form of
the principle by “(Te)”, i.e., “extended transitivity principle”. It is a very important
principle, and it will be used, in the next section, together with (Rg) and another
rule, to form what we shall call our “basis II”, which makes use of conjunction. But
at present, we do not wish to use conjunction, and we need, therefore, a stronger
and more complicated principle which we shall call the “generalised principle of
transitivity” and which we shall denote by “(Tg)”.
This generalised principle of transitivity is, indeed, not so simple as our other
principles, and this is the reason why we shall attempt to do without it, that is to say,
why we shall design a method for avoiding its acceptance as a primitive rule.
Why we need it here is due to the following reason:
We may be able to derive the statements 𝑏1 as well as 𝑏2 from the premises
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛; i.e., we may have
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2.
At the same time, we may have
𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑐.
|
199
Clearly, we have then also
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
Or, putting it in one line, the following rule will be generally valid:
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2) →(𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
Now this is perhaps not much more complicated than (Te). But we cannot stop here.
It is possible that 𝑐does not follow from 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 together, but that it follows from
the 𝑚premises 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚; or in other words, it may be that
𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐

holds; and it is quite possible that each of these 𝑚premises of 𝑐, i.e., each of
the statements, 𝑏1, 𝑏2, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, follows in turn as a conclusion from the premises
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. In this case,
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐
will hold also.
But how shall we write down a rule stating this more complicated kind of
transitivity? There is no very simple way of writing it down.
One way of writing it is this:
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2 & . . . & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚) →
(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
(2.5g)
Another way of writing it is this:
(2.5g1)


𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1
& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2
...
...
& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚


→(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
Or we may introduce a new abbreviation for any expression like
𝑎/𝑏1 & 𝑎/𝑏2 & 𝑎/𝑏3 & . . . & 𝑎/𝑏𝑚
(whatever the number of the premises may be) by using instead the brief expression:
𝑚
Ö
𝑖=1
𝑎/𝑏𝑖
This will be found repulsive by many, and we shall not continue to use anything as
complicated as this in the remainder of the |
200
paper. But we may mention that our rule
2.5g is in this way much easier to write:
(2.5g†)
𝑚
Ö
𝑖=1
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖→(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
Another way out would be to write:
(2.5g‡) If, for all values of 𝑖between 1 and 𝑚(i.e., for 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚), we have
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖, then we also have: if 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
But whatever way of writing we may adopt – there is no doubt that this general
principle of transitivity is considerably less simple and convincing than, say, (Te), i.e.,
(2.5e)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
Before we proceed, in the next section, to develop a method which allows us to

120
Karl R. Popper
dispense with anything more complicated than the rules (Te) or even (Ts), I wish to
make clear that the system consisting of the two rules (Rg) and (Tg), i.e., 2.4 and
2.5g, or alternatively, the system consisting of the four rules, 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; and (Tg),
is sufficient as a basis for the construction of propositional and functional logic, as
undertaken in sections 3 to 7. (The precise sense in which these sets form a “basis”
will become clear in the sequel.)
The two systems are of equal effect in the sense that it can be shown that every
inference which is valid in the one is also valid in the other. Furthermore, each of the
two systems is independent in the sense that it can be shown of any one of the rules
so far mentioned that, if it is omitted, the system in question is no longer of equal
effect with the other system. (They can also easily be shown to be consistent.)
With the help of each of the two systems, a large number of what we may call
“secondary rules of inference” can be shown to be valid. A rule is called “secondary”
to some other rules which are “primary” relative to it if it does not add anything new
to these primary rules; that is to say, if every inference which is asserted as valid by
the secondary rule could be drawn merely by force of the primary rules alone, for
example, by reiterated application of one of the primary rules, or by applying one
after the other. (“Primitive” rules are rules of a set of rules such that all the other rules
considered are secondary to the rules of this set; and an independent set of primitive
rules is called a “basis”.) Many of the secondary rules of our system |
201
are, of course,
trivial, but some are not. Among the more trivial ones is the following (which we
already know):
(2.41)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1
This is clearly a valid rule whenever 2.4 is valid.
(2.6)
If 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏then 𝑎𝑛+1, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.
This rule is very similar to rule 2.2, but it does not follow from 2.2 alone. (To say that
a rule “follows” from certain other rules is merely an elliptical way of saying that it is
secondary to them.) On the contrary, the system consisting of rules 2.1 to 2.3 and
(Tg) remains independent if 2.3 is replaced by 2.6 which shows that 2.6 is not only
independent of 2.2 but also of 2.2 together with 2.1 and (Tg).6
Another secondary rule is one which we mentioned when introducing the rule
2.3 (which permits the reversal of the order of the premises). It is the rule that the
premises may be rearranged in any desired order. This simple rule, if formulated in
our usual way, looks a little complicated – again a case where the complication is not
due to the contents of a rule but to the need of expressing it precisely, and in a handy
and standardised way. The rule is:
6 I owe to Professor Paul Bernays the suggestion of replacing 2.3 by 2.6. It can be shown, however,
that our original set 2.1 to 2.3 and (Tg) is in the following sense weaker than the new system (with
2.6 instead of 2.3). If, in our original system, 2.1 is replaced by the stronger rule 2.41, then the
system remains independent. In the new system, if 2.1 is so replaced, 2.2 becomes dependent. (We
thus obtain a system of three primitive rules, viz., 2.41; 2.6; 2.5g.)

3 New Foundations for Logic
121
(2.7)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑏
(0 ≤𝑛≤𝑛+ 𝑚).
Rule 2.7, together with 2.5g and 2.41, may be taken for another basis of equal
effect with the ones mentioned.
An obvious but very important secondary rule is the following:
(2.8) If in any valid inference, one or more of the premises are such that they follow
from the others, then they can be omitted as redundant, i.e., without invalidating
the inference.
In view of
𝑎/𝑎,
this rule 2.8 allows us to omit from a set of premises any premise which occurs more
than once.
It will have been noticed that we have rules of two kinds. Some, such as “𝑎/𝑎”
or “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑛” may be called absolute |
202
rules of derivation; others such as
“𝑎/𝑏→𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏” (a secondary rule to 2.2) may be called conditional rules of
derivation. In a conditional rule, we may distinguish between the antecedent rule and
the consequent rule. Thus in the conditional rule
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐→𝑏, 𝑎/𝑐,
the rule “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐” is the antecedent rule, while “𝑏, 𝑎/𝑐” is the consequent rule.
Some important and no longer trivial principles can be shown to hold of all such
conditional rules. In order to formulate them, we first explain the terms “strengthening”
and “weakening” as applied to premises or conclusions.
If a conclusion can be validly derived from some premise(s), we say that it is
therefore logically weaker than the premise(s) or at most equal (in strength) to them,
and that the premise(s) are logically stronger than the conclusion or at least equal to it.
We shall, for brevity, say simply “weaker” and “stronger”, but we have to keep in mind
that these terms are here intended to be used in such a way as not to exclude equal
strength; for the validity of “𝑎/𝑎” reminds us that a conclusion may, very obviously,
be as strong as the premise from which it is drawn.
We further say that we “strengthen” (or “weaken”) the premise(s) or the conclusion
of a rule if we replace some or all of them by others in such a way that as a result they
become logically stronger (or weaker, as the case may be); equal strength, again, is
not excluded.
Now we can formulate some of the secondary rules which can be shown to hold in
our system as follows:
(2.9) In a valid conditional rule,
(𝑎) the premises of the antecedent rule may be weakened,
(𝑏) the conclusion of the antecedent rule may be strengthened,
(𝑐) the premises of the consequent rule may be strengthened,
(𝑑) the conclusion of the consequent rule may be weakened,
without affecting the validity of the conditional rule.

122
Karl R. Popper
It is possible to show that any change of any valid conditional rule of our system,
effected in accordance with rule 2.9, leads to a new valid rule which, too, is within
our system.
Another interesting principle is connected with mutual deducibility (or logical
equivalence) of statements. If 𝑎and 𝑏are mutually deducible, we write
𝑎//𝑏.
|
203
“//” is a new concept of our system, and can be easily defined on the basis of “/”,
by the following obvious Definition:
(D//)
𝑎//𝑏if, and only if, 𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑎.
This definition may be abbreviated by using “↔” for “if, and only if”:
(D//+)
𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑎).
We shall use “↔” quite often, but, in the same way as “→” and “&”, as an
abbreviation only.
Now it can be shown of our system that, whenever 𝑎//𝑏, we can, without impairing
its validity, substitute 𝑎for 𝑏, in some or all places of the occurrence of 𝑏, in any valid
inference. If we call two mutually deducible statements “logically equivalent”, then
we can call this very general rule the substitutivity principle for logical equivalence.
And we can read “𝑎//𝑏” not only “𝑎is logically equivalent to 𝑏”, but also “𝑎is
substitutionally equal to 𝑏”; and we can call mutual deducibility also “substitutional
equality”. (The problem of the substitutivity of logical equivalence will be mentioned
again in later sections.)
But is our system of rules valid?
We can define validity of inference (following in the main Tarski7) in the following
way: An inference is valid if every interpretation (i.e., for our present purpose: every
actual set of statements which can be used as an example of one of our rules) which
makes the premises true also makes the conclusion true.
If we call an interpretation which makes all the premises true and the conclusion
false a counterexample,then we can also say: An inference is validifno counterexample
exists.8
Now it can be very easily shown of all our rules that they are valid in this sense.
Take, for example, the rule 2.41:
7 Cp. A. Tarski, “Ueber den Begriff der logischen Folgerung” ⟨Tarski, 1936b⟩. We shall not discuss
here the concept of interpretation. (Tarski speaks of “models”.) But the fact, established in this paper,
that formative signs can be defined in terms of a concept of deducibility which does not assume any
formative signs in turn, opens a way to applying Tarski’s concept without difficulty. I have in mind
the difficulty, mentioned by Tarski, of distinguishing between formative (“logical”) and descriptive
signs. This difficulty seems now to be removed. (Cp. my “Logic without Assumptions,” forthcoming
⟨as Popper, 1947b⟩.)
8 See also my “Why are the Calculuses of Logic and Mathematics Applicable to Reality?” ⟨Popper,
1946c⟩, esp. pp. 47ff.

𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1.
|
204
Assume that a counterexample exists. Then there must be a certain interpretation
which makes all the premises true and, at the same time, the conclusion false; thus,
in the light of this interpretation, the conclusion 𝑎1 will be a false statement. But
since 𝑎1 occurs in the premises also, they cannot possibly be all true statements.
Accordingly, no counterexample can exist.
In a similar way, all the other rules can easily be shown to be valid, and this
explains their triviality: the degree of their triviality is, as it were, in proportion to the
ease with which their validity can be shown.
3. Another Approach. Conjunction
We now proceed to discuss the replacement of the complicated rule (Tg) ⟨or⟩2.5g by
the simpler rule (Te) or 2.5e. But in order to do this, we must somewhat restrict the
generality of our approach.
Indeed, the rudiment of a theory of inference sketched in the foregoing section9 is
about as general as such a theory can possibly be. It can be applied to any language
in which we can identify statements (or sentences, or propositions – there is no need
for us here to enter into the problem of the possibility or necessity of distinguishing
between these entities), that is to say, expressions of which we might reasonably say
that they are true or that they are false. Nothing is presupposed of our 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . .
except that they are statements, and our theory shows, thereby, that there exists a
rudimentary theory of inference for any language that contains statements, whatever
their logical structure or lack of structure may be. (But this means, for any human
language, that is to say, for any language which is not only expressive and evocative
of response, as animal languages are, but also descriptive, i.e., containing means for
describing facts, or statements of facts, which may be true or false.)
We may mention here in passing that our symbols “𝑎”; “𝑏”; “𝑐”; etc., are
variables, similar to those used by mathematicians in algebra; and as the values of the
mathematicians’ variables are numbers, so the values of our variables are statements.
|
205
The student of algebra studies a universe of discourse consisting of numbers (of
some kind – say, natural numbers, or real numbers). We study a universe of discourse
consisting of statements (of some kind – say, the statements of a certain language).
The mathematician allows that certain figures (not numbers) – for example, the figures
“1”, “2”, etc., may be substituted for his variables; that is to say, what may replace
his variables is any name of a number. Similarly, we must assume that names of
9 Professor Bernays has drawn my attention to the close relationship that exists between this theory
and the system of five axioms for the theory of consequence developed by A. Tarski in his “Ueber
einige fundamentale Begriffe der Metamathematik” ⟨Tarski, 1930b⟩. Bernays designed a method of
translating Tarski’s prima facie very different and more abstract approach into a more elementary
one, very similar to the approach presented in this section. (He has also drawn my attention to a
somewhat similar system; see ⟨Hertz, 1923⟩and ⟨Hertz, 1931⟩.) With the help of this method it can
be easily shown that our system is equivalent to the first four of Tarski’s five axioms.

124
Karl R. Popper
statements (not the statements themselves) may be substituted for our variables. This
is what we mean when we say that the mathematicians’ symbols “𝑎”; “𝑏”; etc., are
variable names of numbers, i.e., variables which designate unspecified numbers; in
the same sense, our symbols “𝑎”; “𝑏”; etc., are variables which designate unspecified
statements, and they may be described, in the sense indicated, as variable names of
statements.
Now the universe of statements envisaged in the foregoing section may consist
of the statements of any language, whatever its logical structure. But in the present
section, a certain restriction is imposed on the admissible languages – they must
contain what we shall call conjunctions.
We shall define conjunction in what follows. The intuitive meaning of our definition
can be conveyed perhaps in this way: We say that a language 𝐿contains conjunctions
(or that it contains the operation of conjunction) if we can join any two statements –
the statement 𝑎, say, and the statement 𝑏– in such a way as to form a new statement
𝑐which is logically equivalent to 𝑎and 𝑏together. This is done, in English, by
linking them together with the help of the word “and”. But we need not suppose that
any such word exists: the link may be effected in very different ways; moreover, the
new statement need not even contain the old ones as recognisable separate parts (or
“components”). We may therefore say:
A language 𝐿contains the operation of conjunction if, and only if, it contains, for
any two statements, 𝑎and 𝑏, a third statement 𝑐which is logically equivalent to them
(i.e., a little more precisely, equivalent to the first two statements taken together).
Now the remark on logical equivalence definitely needs here some clarification.
According to the way in which we have introduced “//”, we cannot write “𝑎, 𝑏//𝑐”;
rather, only one statement is allowed to occur on the left- as well as on the right-hand
side of “//” only. For we must remember that our conclusions always consist of one
statement only; and in the case of “//”, conclusions (as well as premises) stand on
both sides.
|
206
Nevertheless, the statement 𝑐may be said to be equivalent to the two statements
𝑎, 𝑏if we have:
𝑐/𝑎
(1)
𝑐/𝑏
(2)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
(3)
We are thus led to a definition along the following lines:
(D3.01) The statement 𝑐is a conjunction of the two statements 𝑎and 𝑏if, and only
if, 𝑐/𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏, and 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.
(D3.02) A language 𝐿contains the operation of conjunction if, and only if, it contains,
with every pair of statements, 𝑎, and 𝑏, a third statement 𝑐which is the
conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏.
Definitions D3.01 and D3.02 are as such quite in order, and adequate. But in view
of our aim – the simplification of the transitivity principle – we shall not adopt D3.01.
Rather, we shall replace D3.01 by a similar but slightly stronger definition.

3 New Foundations for Logic
125
The situation is this: D3.01 makes, of course, very essential use of our specifically
logical concept “/”. Its force will depend, therefore, upon the force of this concept
“/”; but this means upon the primitive rules of derivation assumed to hold. A closer
analysis shows that D3.01 is perfectly adequate as long as we assume all those rules
of inference which we are accustomed, intuitively, to use; which means, in effect, the
systems of primitive rules discussed in section 2. But if we drop some of these rules,
or if we replace 2.5g by the weaker form of the transitivity principle 2.5e, then our
definition is no longer quite adequate. It turns out, in this case, that it does not entitle
us to assert that more than two separate statements can be joined into a conjunction
or, in other words, that there exists, for any three statements 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, an equivalent
statement 𝑑. On the basis provided by section 2, this can be shown to hold, but not if
2.5g is replaced by 2.5e or 2.5. (It is in these somewhat subtle points that our trivial
system of logic becomes complicated.)
But the main point of using conjunction is just that it should permit us to link up
any number of statements into one. If it does this, then we can always replace the 𝑚
conclusions of 𝑚different inferences from the same premises by one inference. But if
we can do this, then (Te) or perhaps even (Ts) will be, clearly, sufficient. At the same
time, many other simplifications would be possible. For example, we could use “//”
in order to express equivalence between 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛and 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚– namely by first
replacing each of the two sets by the conjunction of all statements belonging to it.
We see here that it is a practical need – the need for |
207
simplification, abbreviation,
greater lucidity of certain formulations, etc. – which leads us to introduce conjunction;
and we may safely assume that it was precisely such a need which led, in the actual
development of most human languages to the invention of a linguistic device, such as
the use of the word “and”, which guarantees that the language contains conjunction
in the sense defined above.
Since our definition is, as we have said, only adequate on the basis of the whole
system of section 2, we shall have to modify it in order to achieve our purpose. But
before proceeding to do so, we shall make some comments upon another aspect of
our definitions D3.01 and D3.02. These comments will go into some detail, but our
labours will be rewarded, for our findings concerning conjunction apply equally to
the hypothetical, the disjunction, the negation, the quantifiers, etc.
If we designate the conjunction of the statements 𝑎and 𝑏by the letter “𝑐”, it is
necessary for us always to add, explicitly, whenever we mention 𝑐, that this 𝑐is a
conjunction of the statements 𝑎and 𝑏. We can avoid this by introducing a new sign,
such as “∧(𝑎, 𝑏)” – which may be read: “the conjunction of the statement 𝑎and
the statement 𝑏”, – or, more briefly, “𝑎∧𝑏”, – which may be read “(the statement)
a-and-b”, or simply “a-and-b”. Using this method, D3.01 becomes:
(D3.01+) The statement 𝑎∧𝑏is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if, and only if, 𝑎∧𝑏/𝑎,
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑏, and 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎∧𝑏.
But this can be split up into two parts: a definition D3.0 and three primitive rules
of inference:
(D3.0) “𝑎∧𝑏” is the (variable) name of the conjunction of the two statements 𝑎and
𝑏(called the two components of the conjunction).

126
Karl R. Popper
The three rules of inference for 𝑎∧𝑏, are:
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑎.
(3.1)
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑏.
(3.2)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎∧𝑏.
(3.3)
It is clear that (D3.0) is nothing but the introduction of a new label, and that only
the three rules give the new label a meaning, – by relating it to deducibility.
A warning should be given here: as we have introduced it, the symbol “∧” has no
separate meaning at all. It would be a mistake to consider it as an abbreviation of the
word “and”, – perhaps even as an alternative abbreviation to “&”. We do not even
assume that the language we are discussing – the language to which our statements
𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . belong – possesses a special sign for linking statements into conjunctions.
We can |
208
easily imagine a language 𝐿, consisting, say, of simple subject-predicate
statements, in which the end of a whole statement is always indicated by the word
“stop”. In such a language, a conjunction of two or more statements may be expressed
simply by omitting the word “stop” between them, rather than by inserting a word
corresponding to our “and”. Furthermore, a language may dispose of different means
for expressing conjunction. Our language may perhaps express conjunction not only
by the omission of the word “stop” but alternatively (taking a clue from Latin)
by replacing the word “stop” by the word “que”; and this may mean that the two
preceding statements are intended to form a conjunction. (If three statements are to
be linked, “queque” may conclude the third, etc.)
Any number of different methods of expressing conjunction may be invented, and
may actually occur, even within one and the same language.
It is for this reason that we say that 𝑎∧𝑏is a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏, rather than
that it is the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏. But however many conjunctions of 𝑎and 𝑏we
may have in a language, they all must be equivalent if they satisfy our rules 3.1 to 3.3;
for any two conjunctions of 𝑎and 𝑏which satisfy these rules (and those of section 2)
can be shown to be mutually deducible.
The upshot of all this is that what we have defined is not so much the conjunction
of 𝑎and 𝑏but the precise logical force (or the logical import) of any statement 𝑐that
is equal in force to a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏. This may be made clearer, perhaps, by
re-formulating our definition D3.01 in this way:
(D3.03) The statement 𝑐is equivalent (or substitutionally equal) to any conjunction
of the statements 𝑎and 𝑏, if, and only if, 𝑐/𝑎and 𝑐/𝑏and 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.
Or in an alternative way of writing:
(D3.03+)
𝑐//𝑎∧𝑏↔(𝑐/𝑎& 𝑐/𝑏& 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐).
From this definition, we can obtain the three rules 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 in the following
way: if 𝑐and 𝑎∧𝑏are substitutionally equal, then: (1) 𝑐/𝑎& 𝑐/𝑏& 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐(by
force of D3.02), and (2) we may substitute “𝑎∧𝑏” for “𝑐” (by force of substitutional
equality). But the result of this substitution leads precisely to the rules 3.1 to 3.3.

3 New Foundations for Logic
127
It will now be reasonably clear, I hope, what we mean if we say that we can define
conjunction on the basis of the system of section 2, with “/” as our only specific
logical term. It may be mentioned, in addition, that if we wished, we could easily
proceed further, and define, with the help of our definition of a conjunction, the sign of
conjunction itself (in English, the word “and”) |
209
along the following lines. We could
distinguish between preceding, intervening, and succeeding signs of conjunction (i.e.,
signs preceding the two statements to be linked, or placed between them – like “and”
– or succeeding them – like “que” in our example above). Then we can define: A sign
𝑆of a language 𝐿is a preceding sign of conjunction in 𝐿if, and only if, for any pair
of statements 𝑎and 𝑏of 𝐿, an expression consisting of 𝑆followed by 𝑎and by 𝑏
is, in 𝐿a conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏. Corresponding definitions would have to be laid
down for intervening and succeeding signs of conjunction. Next, we could define: A
language 𝐿contains a (preceding, etc.) sign of conjunction if, and only if, it contains
a sign 𝑆such that 𝑆is a (preceding, etc.) sign of conjunction.
These definitions are intended to assume as little as possible about the particular
method by which a particular language may express conjunction. But they are not
applicable to all languages containing conjunction; they cannot achieve generality. It
is always possible to design new methods of expressing conjunction which are not
covered by any definition of this kind (for example, underlining in written language,
intonation in spoken language, etc.); and I have mentioned this way of defining the
term “sign of conjunction in 𝐿” merely in order to show that we do not, perhaps, pay
for the generality of our approach by an incapacity of applying our theory to the usual
types of language.
These comments upon the character of our definitions, and on the possibilities
of extending them to the definition of certain signs of some language, apply, as
indicated, not only conjunction, but equally to disjunction, negation, hypotheticals,
the quantifiers, etc., that is, to all formative signs10 of a language.
We now turn back to the particular problems of conjunction. First we may mention
that our definitions can be made much neater; for it so happens that the rules 3.1 to
3.3 can be replaced, in the presence of the rules of section 2, by either of the two
following rules:
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.
(3.4)
𝑐/𝑎∧𝑏↔𝑐/𝑎& 𝑐/𝑏.
(3.5)
|
210
Using 3.4, instead of using 3.1 to 3.3 (as we did in our definition D3.03+) we can
replace D3.03+ by the following definition:
(D3.04+)
𝑐//𝑎∧𝑏↔(for any statement 𝑑: 𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑑).
Similarly, 3.5 would give rise to the following definition:
10 I prefer to speak of the “formative signs” of an object language where Carnap and Tarski speak of
“logical signs”. The reason is that I consider logic as a purely metalinguistic affair; on the other hand,
the signs in question (of the object language) characterise the formal structure of that language.

128
Karl R. Popper
(D3.05+)
𝑐//𝑎∧𝑏↔(for any statement 𝑑: 𝑑/𝑐↔𝑑/𝑎& 𝑑/𝑏).
Each of these two definitions is adequate, on the basis of the system of section 2,
but each of them presupposes (Tg), i.e. 2.5g, for adequacy.
But there is a method of generalising all these rules, by introducing many premises,
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, instead of one premise 𝑎. The various generalised rules look like this:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐/𝑏.
(3.1g)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐/𝑐.
(3.2g)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑏∧𝑐.
(3.3g)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏∧𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑.
(3.4g)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
(3.5g)
On the basis provided by section 2, each of the last two rules,11 3.4g as well as
3.5g, turns out to be replaceable by the three rules 3.1g to 3.3g, and vice versa; but
this result is in so far trivial as, on this basis, it also turns out that the generalisation
is superfluous, that is to say, that we can everywhere omit the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛,
which brings us back to our original forms 3.1 to 3.5. But this situation changes
completely if we drop the generalised transitivity principle (Tg) and replace it by the
simpler form (Te). In this case, all the rules 3.1 to 3.5 and 3.1g to 3.4g still follow
from 3.5g;b but the opposite is not the case.
Thus rule 3.5g is more powerful12 than the others; and indeed, it turns out that it
allows us to dispense with (Tg); that is to say, it can be shown that, in the presence of
3.5g, (Tg) is secondary to (Te) and (Rg).
We shall briefly sketch the proof of this contention. The assumption of the
generalised transitivity rule (Tg) is that the following 𝑚rules are valid:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏3 & . . . & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚
(1)
Now we obtain, from the first of these, i.e., from
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2
(2)
by rule 3.5g,
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ∧𝑏2
(3)
|
211
accordingly, we also have, by (1),
11 Rule 3.4g has been suggested to me by Professor Bernays. This led me to adopt the simplified rule
3.4 (as rule 4.1 in section 4).
12 It is more powerful relative to those transitivity principles which we are considering here (with a
view to avoiding an unspecified number of antecedents). ⟨Footnote added in the Errata.⟩
b This statement is not correct; 3.4g does not follow from 3.5g. The error will lead to the failure of
Basis II; cp. 4.6. Cp. also the remark by Bernays in his letter to Popper, 12 May 1948 (this volume,
§ 21.7).

𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ∧𝑏2 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏3
(4)
and, applying rule 3.5g again, we obtain
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/(𝑏1 ∧𝑏2) ∧𝑏3
(5)
and so on, until all the various conclusions 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑛are incorporated into one, as
components of a conjunction. Now this process, which makes use only of 3.5g, allows
us to replace (1) by one single rule of inference. To this single rule we can apply (Te),
the extended form of the transitivity rule.c
We may sum up our results as follows:
We have now two approaches for deducibility.
Approach I consists of the systems of section 2 – in its simplest form, a basis
consisting of two primitive rules: rule (Rg), the generalised principle of reflexivity,
and rule 2.5g the generalised principle of transitivity, denoted by (Tg). We repeat
these two rules, which constitute what we call the basis I:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)
(Rg)
𝑚
Ö
𝑖=1
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐)
(Tg)
This approach is applicable to any language.
Approach II is less generally applicable: it assumes that the language under consid-
eration contains (in accordance with definition D3.02) the operation of conjunction.
In its simplest form, called “basis II”, it consists of a postulate (PC), expressing this
assumption and replacing the definition D3.02, and of three primitive rules, viz. of
(Rg) and (Te), the simple form of the principle of transitivity previously called 2.5e,
and of 3.5g, which we shall call the generalised principle of conjunction. This is
basis II:
If 𝑎is a statement and 𝑏is a statement, then 𝑎∧𝑏is a statement.
(PC)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛).
(Rg)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
(Te)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
(Cg)
These two approaches13 are, of course, not equivalent; basis II is richer than basis I,
since it contains, for example, all the rules 3.1 to 3.5, and 3.1g to 3.5g (which basis I
does not contain), and |
212
many other rules which may be derived from it; but they
become equivalent in force if we add to basis I postulate (PC) together with, for
13 There are a number of alternative bases in each of the two approaches. I mention only basis I′,
consisting of 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; either (Tg) or 2.8; basis II′ uses only (Ts), together with 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; Cg,
and 3.4g.
c Popper’s proof is not correct; 𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑐→𝑏1 ∧𝑏2/𝑐does not follow from the rules of Basis II.

example, the rules 3.1 to 3.3 (or with one of the rules 3.4 or 3.5, or else with one of
the Definitions D3.03 to D3.05).
4. The Logic of Compound Statements
Either of the two bases described in the foregoing sections suffices for the construction
of modern logic,14 i.e., of the logic of compound statements15 and of the logic of
quantification (or the propositional and the lower functional calculus), and therefore
a fortiori for constructing classical logic, so far as it is valid.
The logic of compound statements comprises the rules of inference pertaining to
conjunction, to the hypothetical or conditional statement, its converse, and the bi-
conditional, to disjunction, negation, etc. The system of these rules can be constructed
by precisely the same method as was used in the previous section for introducing
conjunction:
We first assume postulates (such as PC in section 3), one for each of the compounds
we wish to introduce, in order to assure, for every pair of statements, say 𝑎and 𝑏, the
existence of the corresponding compound statement. In this way, we may postulate
for every pair of statements 𝑎and 𝑏the existence of a statement 𝑎> 𝑏(if we want
our language to contain hypothetical compounds); of a statement 𝑎< 𝑏; (if we want
converse hypotheticals); of a statement 𝑎b= 𝑏(if we want bi-conditionals); and of a
statement 𝑎∨𝑏(if we want disjunctions). Furthermore, we postulate that for every
statement 𝑎, a statement ¬𝑎exists (if we want negations).
These postulates have the function of confining our investigation to languages in
which such compounds exist. They can be replaced by definitions such as D3.02; or
alternatively we may formulate our theory hypothetically, by introducing an assertion
about deducibility by a remark such as “If a language contains negation, then the
following rules of inference hold: . . .” In other words, the postulates or definitions do
not really form a part of our theory of inference – they are there solely to indicate
explicitly that the application of our theory is limited, if we |
213
wish to operate with
certain compounds, to languages which contain these compounds.
The meaning of the compounds will be determined by primitive rules of derivation
(4.1 to 4.6), one primitive rule for each of the six compounds mentioned.
It may be asked whether any actually spoken language contains these compounds?
The answer, I believe, is: they do not; but they contain them approximately. The
actually spoken languages are a kind of natural growth, with rules of use which are not
clearly defined, and which cannot be clearly defined; if we define them in a definite
way, then we replace the actually spoken and growing language by something else –
14 I exclude the theory of membership (as Quine calls it) as mathematical. Classical syllogistic (so
far as valid) appears as a small part of the logic of statement functions with one variable.
15 The term “compound” is in so far misleading as we do not assume here that the so-called
“components” are actually parts of the statements (the conjunction, etc.) whose components they are;
see section 3. That is, we do not assume statement-composition, although our theory is applicable
to it.

131
by a kind of artificial reconstruction of it, or to put it bluntly, by a kind of artificial
calculus.
This cannot be otherwise; for there is no reason why all people who speak a
certain naturally grown language should conform, in their habits of speech, to a
precise system of rules of use. On the contrary, they will, at best, develop that degree
of precision which is requisite to the ordinary problems of the day (rather than to
scientific and, more especially, mathematical and logical problems). A grammarian
who attempts to legislate for them in fact attempts to impose an artificial calculus
upon them; as a rule, he obtains his calculus by a process of idealising the speaking
habits of what he considers to be well educated people. The logician also constructs
an artificial model language or calculus, but as a rule (I hope) without attempting to
impose it upon anybody.
Why does he do it? As I indicated above, the fundamental problem of logic is
the theory of inference – in the most elementary form, the drawing up of rules of
valid inference. In this task, he cannot succeed without introducing some artificial
precision into the language in which these inferences are formulated. For what he
aims at is, at the very least, a distinction between valid and invalid inferences. But
whether or not a certain concrete instance of an inference is valid will depend, very
often,16 upon the meaning of certain words which may occur in the premises or in the
conclusion; or more precisely, on the rules determining the use of these words. If,
therefore, these rules are fluid, then the question whether or not a certain inference is
valid cannot be answered.
|
214
Thus the logician cannot fulfil his most elementary task without constructing
something like an artificial model language; and every logician from Aristotle onward
has done so – although few were quite clear about what they were doing.
The primitive rules of derivation with the help of which we are about to determine
the meaning of our compounds, in a way go beyond this method of constructing an
artificial model language – they characterise a very wide class of (artificial) languages
as conforming to certain definite and precise rules – rules which make it possible for
us to develop a theory of inference.
Still, when all is said and done, it so happens that to each of our artificial com-
pounds, there exists a closely corresponding compound proposition in English. The
correspondence between the conjunction 𝑎∧𝑏and the English statements constructed
with “and”, for example “It rains and it is wet”, are particularly close. But even the
conditional statement 𝑎> 𝑏corresponds very closely indeed to some current English
expressions. The correspondence with a phrase such as “If it rains, then it is wet” or
“Provided it rains, it is wet” is quite good, but that with the more complex statement
“It does not rain without its being wet” is better. Accordingly, we can pronounce the
symbol “𝑎> 𝑏” perhaps “if-𝑎-then-𝑏” or better “𝑎-not-without-𝑏”, remembering,
however, that it is not an abbreviation for the English phrase but a variable name of
any statement which stands in a certain logical relationship to the two statements 𝑎
and 𝑏.
16 But not always; for the theory of section 2 (or of our approach I) is independent of the meaning of
any particular word; all it presupposes is that we can identify statements.

132
Karl R. Popper
Similarly, we can read “𝑎< 𝑏” perhaps “a-if-b” or “a-provided-b”, and “𝑎b= 𝑏”
perhaps “a-if-and-only-if-b”.
The disjunction 𝑎∨𝑏does not correspond badly to a phrase such as “It rains or it
is wet or both”. The correspondence with the briefer phrase “It rains or it is wet” is
very bad indeed, but we may for the sake of brevity pronounce “𝑎∨𝑏”, nevertheless
“a-or-b”, having in mind that this is short for “a-or-b-or-both”.
There is no very fitting English phrase corresponding to the negation ¬𝑎. The
negation of the statement “It rains”, corresponds very well to “It does not rain” (rather
than to the impossible phrase “Not it rains”), yet the negation of “All men are mortal”
does not correspond to “All men are not mortal” but rather to “Not all men are mortal”.
A generally applicable phrase which is not too bad in English and which corresponds
very well to ¬𝑎is “It is not the case that . . .”. Abbreviating this, we can read “¬𝑎”
perhaps as “not-a”.
|
215
We now state our primitive rules:
(4.1)
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.
Or: “From the one premise a-and-b we can derive 𝑐if, and only if, from the two
premises 𝑎and 𝑏we can derive 𝑐.” (This is the same as 3.4. Note the trivial character
of the rule. Nevertheless, it is important and very powerful in connexion with basis I;
with basis II it is, of course, redundant.)
(4.2)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.
Or: From the statement 𝑎we can derive the statement b-not-without-c if, and only if,
we can derive from the two statements 𝑎and 𝑏the statement 𝑐. (Example: From “It
rains incessantly every week-end” we can derive “Provided I frequently walk during
week-ends, I frequently walk while it rains” if, and only if, we can derive from the
two premises “It rains incessantly every week-end” and “I walk frequently during
week-ends” the conclusion “I walk frequently while it rains”.)
𝑎/𝑏< 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏.
(4.3)
𝑎/𝑏b= 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐& 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏.
(4.4)
𝑎∨𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎/𝑐& 𝑏/𝑐.
(4.5)
¬𝑎, 𝑏/¬𝑐↔𝑐, 𝑏/𝑎.
(4.6)
Rules 4.1 to 4.5 constitute the positive logic of compound statements, that is to
say, they suffice for that part of propositional logic which is independent of negation.
If our rule 4.6 for negation is added, we obtain the whole of compound statements
(or of propositional logic). If, instead, the two rules for quantification discussed in
section 7 are added, we obtain the whole of positive logic.
Positive logic as defined by these rules does not yet contain all valid rules of
inferences in which no use is made of negation: there is a further region which we
may call the “extended positive logic” (or, if we exclude quantification, the “extended
positive logic of compound statements”). This extension is achieved by adding to the

3 New Foundations for Logic
133
system without 4.6 an additional rule for hypothetical statements, viz.:
(4.2e)
𝑎, 𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏↔𝑎/𝑏.
This rule may be, loosely, characterised as asserting that, if we add to a premise
another one which merely informs us that something depends on our conclusion, then
we do not thereby strengthen in any way the power of our original premise to yield
that particular conclusion. An example is: From the two |
216
premises “All men are
mortal” and “If Plato is mortal then he cannot be a god”, we can derive the conclusion
“Plato is mortal” if, and only if, we can derive this conclusion from the first premise
alone.
If rule 4.2e is added as primary to our rules 4.1 to 4.5, then all valid rules of the
logic of compounds in which negation does not occur become secondary rules. Also
we do not need, in the presence of rule 4.2e, the whole force of our rule of negation
4.6, but can obtain this rule as a secondary rule from some weaker rules17 (from the
rules of the so-called intuitionist logic). On the other hand, if we have as primary the
two rules 4.2 and 4.6, then 4.2e becomes a secondary rule.
Considering the triviality of these rules – especially of the “positive” rules 4.1 to
4.5 – their power is truly amazing. To give a few examples:
From 4.1 alone (of course, the basis is always assumed), we can obtain as a
secondary rule the associative law for conjunction
(4.01)
(𝑎∧𝑏) ∧𝑐//𝑎∧(𝑏∧𝑐);
furthermore, on the basis I, all the rules of section 3.
From 4.2 alone, we obtain, on either of the two bases, first of all
(4.020)
𝑎, 𝑎> 𝑏/𝑏,
that is to say, the modus ponens; furthermore, the important rules
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑎.
(4.021)
𝑎> (𝑎> 𝑏)/𝑎> 𝑏.
(4.022)
On the basis II, or if we add either rule 4.1 or 4.6, we obtain furthermore
𝑎> 𝑏/(𝑏> 𝑐) > (𝑎> 𝑐).
(4.023)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐> 𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑.
(4.024)
This last rule is a kind of generalisation of 4.2 which cannot, on the basis I, be obtained
from 4.2 alone, but which can also be obtained with the help of 4.6 (instead of 4.1 or
of basis II).
From the rule 4.024 alone, all the rules of positive logic containing no compound
17 In fact, 4.6 assumes more than we need: we can replace in it “↔” by “→”, and still get 4.6 as
secondary rule. It may be mentioned that our rule 4.6 amounts in effect only to a principle underlying
the classical theory of “indirect reduction”.

134
Karl R. Popper
except hypotheticals are derivable without any other help,– of course,always assuming
at least basis I. |
217
Among these rules are
𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐)/𝑏> (𝑎> 𝑐).
(4.025)
𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐)/(𝑎> 𝑏) > (𝑎> 𝑐).
(4.026)
If 4.2e is added, we obtain all valid rules containing no compound other than
hypotheticals. If we combine 4.1, 4.5 and 4.6, then we obtain, for example
(4.5)
𝑎∧(𝑏∨𝑐)//(𝑎∧𝑏) ∨(𝑏∧𝑐).
From 4.6 alone we obtain, on either of the two bases, for example:
(4.061)
¬𝑎, 𝑏1/𝑎→¬𝑎, 𝑏1/𝑏2 & 𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑎,
a rule which, in its effect, is equal to 4.6; furthermore
𝑎//¬¬𝑎.
(4.062)
𝑎, ¬𝑎/𝑏.
(4.063)
𝑎/𝑏& ¬𝑎/𝑏→𝑐/𝑏.
(4.064)
¬𝑐/𝑏→(𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎/𝑐).
(4.065)
These rules can hardly be called trivial; 4.063, for example, is a rule whose validity
has been questioned in this journald not very long ago; 4.065 is, in spite of its
comparative simplicity, hardly self-evident.
These examples are here given mainly with the intention of illustrating our thesis
that we should not despise trivial primitive rules: they may give rise to secondary
rules which are far from being trivial.
Regarding the question of the triviality of our primitive rules, it may further be
observed that the rules 4.1 to 4.5, that is, the rules of the positive logic of compounds,
are not only very obvious, but have, besides, the character of definitions (so-called
contextual definitions) of the compounds which they introduce. The newly introduced
symbol (the definiendum) occurs only once, on the left-hand side, while on the other
side our specific logical term “/” is used, as defining term, apart from certain phrases
of ordinary English, or their abbreviations.
The position is different with the rule of negation, 4.6. Here two negations occur
on the left at the same time: the one is somehow linked up with the other, and can,
therefore, not always be eliminated alone. Rule 4.061 is, in this respect, perhaps
slightly preferable. But it has a very similar defect. The variable “𝑎” occurs twice,
and the rule is therefore not necessarily an effective means of eliminating the symbol
“¬” from any context. But a definition should be able to achieve this.
|
218
The peculiar situation of negation in this respect is connected, I believe, with the
fact that various systems of logic have been developed which use a weaker form of
negation (notably Heyting’s intuitionistic logic which formalises Brouwer’s views on
d Popper here refers to Jeffreys (1942).

3 New Foundations for Logic
135
logic). It is, therefore, of considerable interest to search for an explicit definition for
negation which might permit us to eliminate it from any context, and which might
bring it into line with the other compounds.
5. Explicit Definitions of the Compounds
It can be easily shown that the introduction of the compounds cannot in any way
impair the substitutivity of logical equivalence. That is to say, whenever 𝑎and 𝑏
are mutually deducible, we may substitute 𝑎for 𝑏, or 𝑏for 𝑎, at some or all places
of occurrence, in any rule of inference, however complicated, without affecting the
validity or invalidity of the rule. If we, therefore, use the method already exemplified
by definitions D3.03+ to D3.05+, then we cannot fail to obtain definitions which
allow us to eliminate the defined sign without difficulty from any context.
All the definitions so obtained are rather obvious adaptations of the primitive rules
of the last section, except the definition of negation which is based on 4.061 rather
than on 4.6.
The Conjunction:
(D5.1)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(for any 𝑐1: 𝑎/𝑐1 ↔𝑏, 𝑐/𝑐1).
The Hypothetical:
(D5.2)
𝑎//𝑏> 𝑐↔(for any 𝑎1: 𝑎1/𝑎↔𝑎1, 𝑏/𝑐).
The Converse Hypothetical:
(D5.3)
𝑎//𝑏< 𝑐↔(for any 𝑎1: 𝑎1/𝑎↔𝑎1, 𝑐/𝑏).
The Bi-Conditional:
(D5.4)
𝑎//𝑏b= 𝑐↔(for any 𝑎1: 𝑎1/𝑎↔𝑎1, 𝑐/𝑏& 𝑎1, 𝑏/𝑐).
The Disjunction:
(D5.5)
𝑎//𝑏∨𝑐↔(for any 𝑐1: 𝑎/𝑐1 ↔𝑏/𝑐1 & 𝑐/𝑐1).
The Negation18:
(D5.5)
𝑎//¬𝑏↔(for any 𝑎1 and 𝑏1: 𝑎, 𝑎1/𝑏→(𝑎, 𝑎1/𝑏1 & 𝑎1, 𝑏1/𝑏)).
18 In this formula, the last occurrence of “𝑏1” may be omitted. It is added only in order to make a
certain inherent symmetry (which is nothing but the symmetry between the laws of contradiction
and excluded middle) more obvious. For an alternative definition, see ⟨footnote 20⟩.

136
Karl R. Popper
While none of these definitions use a defined term in the definiens, we may add some
others which make use of defined terms: |
219
The Exclusive Disjunction (“a-or-b-but not both”):
(D5.7)
𝑎//𝑎≠𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎b= 𝑏).
The Alternative Denial (“not-a-or-not-b”):
(D5.8)
𝑎//𝑎
𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎∧𝑏).
The Conjoint Denial (“not-a-and-not-b”):
(D5.9)
𝑎//𝑎↓𝑏↔𝑎//¬(𝑎∨𝑏).
The Tautology:
(D5.00)
𝑎//𝑡(𝑏) ↔𝑎//𝑏∨¬𝑏.
The Contradiction:
(D5.0)
𝑎// 𝑓(𝑏) ↔𝑎//𝑏∧¬𝑏.
For the last two, we can easily prove the rules:
𝑡(𝑎)//𝑡(𝑏).
(5.001)
𝑓(𝑎)// 𝑓(𝑏).
(5.01)
That is to say, all tautologies are substitutionally equal, and the same holds for all
contradictions. This shows that we may omit as irrelevant the reference to “𝑎” or “𝑏”,
and simply write “𝑡” and “ 𝑓” instead of “𝑡(𝑎)” and “ 𝑓(𝑎)”.
In a way, all these definitions are quite unnecessary. True, they may replace the
primitive rules of section 4, but we can work just as well or better with the much
simpler primitive rules. Nothing is added to our system or taken away if we replace
the rules of section 4 by the definitions of the present section.
The only reason why we nevertheless present these definitions here is that they
establish beyond any doubt the fact that our primitive rules of section 5 have the
character of definitions, even the rule for negation.
This fact is, no doubt, interesting. It may help to clear up the discussion of the
so-called “alternative systems of logic”. From our point of view, these systems are
not alternative systems of logic, but alternative ways of using certain labels such as,
for example, the label “negation”. For it is plain that, by using different primitive
rules, or by using different definitions, we can define different concepts. There is no
problem involved here. If we introduce instead of 4.6 a similar primitive rule like
(5.06M)
𝑎, 𝑏/¬𝑐↔𝑐, 𝑏/¬𝑎,
then this rule defines a concept similar to our concept of negation, as defined by 4.6

3 New Foundations for Logic
137
(the “classical” concept of negation), but also a little different. This concept may be
called “negationM” (it is, in the presence of the other rules except 4.6, identical with
the |
220
negation of Johansson’s “Minimum Calculus”). It so happens that negationM
is so closely related to our classical negation that all rules of inference based on
negationM are also valid for classical negation, but not vice versa. (In this sense
negationM can be said to be weaker than classical negation.) This is due to the simple
fact that rule 5.06 is a valid secondary rule of our classical system. If we add to
rule 5.06 another rule (which is not secondary to 5.06 but secondary to our classical
system), viz.:
(5.06I)
¬𝑎, ¬¬𝑎/𝑎,
then these two rules together define another concept – we call it “negationI” – the
intuitionist concept of negation.
All these concepts can co-exist, in one and the same model language, as long as
they are distinguished.19 Thus there is no quarrel between alternative systems. The
rules of inference pertaining to the various concepts of negation are not identical, to
be sure. But this is very satisfactorily explained by the simple fact that the various
concepts have been given a meaning by rules which are not identical.20
The question whether ordinary spoken language uses the one or the other of these
concepts does not, I believe, arise. Ordinary language is not sufficiently precise for us
to ask such questions about it. As far as the somewhat more precise and therefore
more artificial language of science is concerned, we are still asking too much, without
doubt, if we ask such a question in connexion with it. But I suggest that there are good
reasons why, for most purposes of science, the classical concept should be preferable
to the others – simply because it is stronger, more explicit. This does not prevent us
from using, for certain purposes, especially in parts of mathematics, the interesting
concept negationI side by side with the classical one.
The upshot of all these considerations is this: If we have an artificial model
language with signs for conjunction, the conditional . . . etc. (we have called them
“formative signs” of the language in question) then the meaning of these formative
signs can be exhaustively determined by the rules of inference in which the signs
19 It is, however, not always possible to distinguish them, or to prevent one from becoming absorbed or
assimilated by another. If, for example, a language 𝐿contains classical negation and the conditional,
then there exists, for every 𝑏and 𝑐, a statement 𝑏> 𝑐such that 4.2e holds for every 𝑎(besides
4.2). But in the presence of 4.2e (and 4.2) all the rules which are valid for classical negation can
be derived from those for intuitionist negation (as indicated on ⟨p. 133f⟩). This shows that if 𝐿
contains definitions of both classical and intuitionist negation, the latter is unavoidably absorbed or
assimilated by the former. ⟨Footnote added in the Errata.⟩
20 We can use the following signs: “⟨¬𝑐𝑎⟩” for the classical negation of 𝑎, “⟨¬𝑖𝑎⟩” for the
intuitionist negation of 𝑎. We can then introduce the following two explicit definitions, of which the
first is a somewhat preferable alternative to (D5.6):
𝑎//⟨¬𝑐𝑏⟩↔(for any 𝑏1: 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑏1 & (𝑎, 𝑏1/𝑏→𝑏1/𝑏)).
(D5.6c)
𝑎//⟨¬𝑖𝑏⟩↔(for any 𝑏1: 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑏1 & (𝑏, 𝑏1/𝑎→𝑏1/𝑎)).
(D5.6i)

138
Karl R. Popper
occur; this fact is established by defining our definitions of these formative signs
explicitly in terms of rules of inference. |
221
There is good reason to believe that, in our
ordinary language, we learn the intuitive meaning of formative signs in the same way;
for no doubt, we learn their intuitive meaning by learning how to use them. In other
words, we learn their meaning by learning the rules of their use, and these rules are
mainly the rules of their use in connexion with the drawing of inferences.
Thus it is trivial that once we understand intuitively the meaning of formative
signs, the proper handling of the rules of inference pertaining to them is part of this
knowledge.
This is why rules of inference have that compelling character which mislead
idealistic logicians to speak of laws of thought. Instead of taking this compulsion as
the unanalysed and unanalysable datum of logic, we can indeed explain it quite easily.
Once we know how to use the words “and”, “provided”, etc., that is to say, once we
have learned the language and have got an intuitive grasp of its use, we feel compelled
to admit that from 𝑎and 𝑎> 𝑏, 𝑏can be deduced; in exactly the same way as we feel
compelled to admit that this animal here is a cow (provided it is a cow), once we have
learned how to use the word “cow”, and have got an intuitive grasp of its use.
6. Statement-Functions. Substitution as a Logical Operation
We now extend the scope of our inquiry. So far, we have considered only one kind
of expressions, namely statements. Now we are going to consider, in addition to
statements, so-called “statement-functions”.
An example of a statement-function is: “He is a charming fellow”. Whether this is
true or false will depend on the question whom we mean by “he”, or in other words,
whose name we substitute for the pronoun21 “he”; whether we substitute “Ernest”,
say, or “Edward”. The expression “he is a charming fellow” is as such neither true
nor false, it is no statement, but it can be converted into a statement by a fitting
substitution – of a name, or of a descriptive phrase such as “Ernest’s best friend”.
Other examples are: “This is an ugly fireplace”; “He is his younger brother”; “He
owes him the legacy left to him by his father”. The last two examples show the need
for making distinctions: they become clearer if we write, say, “He1 is the younger
brother of he2”, and “He1 owes he2 the legacy left to he3 by the father of he4” – of
course, something else may be meant, for example, “He1 owes he2 the legacy left to
he3 by the father of he1”, or “He1 owes to he2 the legacy left to he2 by the father of
he3”, etc.

222
The need for a sufficiently long list of distinct pronouns is obvious, and we shall
assume, of the languages under consideration, that they dispose of such a sufficient
list. (See below, postulate PF3.)
Now consider again the last example. It is clear that we can derive from it the
statement-function “He1 owes to he2 some legacy”. Similarly, we can derive from the

p. 71⟩, due to Peano.

statement-function “He is not only a charming fellow but an excellent physician” the
statement-function “He is an excellent physician”. In other words, if our treatment of
deducibility is to be as general as we intend it to be, then a treatment of the deducibility
of statement-functions becomes necessary. At the same time, it will be necessary to
treat combinations of statements and statement-functions.
We shall, in fact, assume that the theory of derivation developed in previous
sections holds not only for statements but also for statement-functions.
Although statements and statement-functions should be clearly distinguished, they
are, of course, rather similar things. A statement-function is, as it were, a statement
with certain holes or openings in it, which can be filled up or closed up by inserting
names. For this reason, statement-functions are often called “open statements”, and
statements proper are often called “closed statements”. The terminology has great
advantages, and we shall adopt it; not, however, without issuing a warning that the
term “open statement” must not mislead anybody into believing that open statements
are statements in the ordinary sense. They are not, for they are neither true nor
false. “Open statement” is only an alternative, and often a more convenient, term for
“statement-function”. Only closed statements are statements proper.
Since we do not want to say that open statements are statements, we shall use
another term – “formulae” – to describe the class of expressions which consists of
open statements as well as of closed statements. Thus we shall say that every open
statement is a formula, and that every closed statement is a formula.
But apart from formulae, we have another class of expressions to consider –
the pronouns “he”, “he1”, “he2” . . . “it”, etc. We shall call these pronouns the
name-variables under consideration, since names may be substituted for them.
It is obvious that these two classes of expressions, formulae and pronouns or name-
variables have no member in common. This will be expressed in our postulate PF1.
|
223
Thus our universe of discourse will consist, from now on, of two entirely distinct
classes of expressions – formulae, 𝐹, and name-variables, 𝑁. We shall introduce
the convention to use from now on “𝑎”; “𝑏”; “𝑎1”; “𝑏1” . . . as variable names of
formulae rather than as variable names of closed statements only (as before), and
furthermore, to use “𝑥”; “𝑦”; “𝑧”; “𝑢”; “𝑤”; etc., as variable names of pronouns. It so
happens that “𝑥”; “𝑦”; etc., can be described as variable names of name-variables.
This is perhaps a little confusing, for a moment or two, but quite in order.
The symbols “𝑥”; “𝑦”; etc., are variables which refer to certain symbols such as
“he”; “he1”; “it”; “it1”; etc., of the languages under consideration. The symbols “he”,
“he1”, etc., refer in their turn to certain men – to Ernest, to Edward, etc. These men –
not perhaps their names – constitute the “realm of individuals” or the “universe of
individuals” to which the language 𝐿under consideration refers. This universe of the
discourse of 𝐿is not the universe of our discourse; we, rather, discuss languages – 𝐿,
for example – and especially certain classes of expressions.
The name-variables of 𝐿may occur in the formulae of 𝐿in two ways: either as
free variables or as bound variables.
In the open statements which we used as examples, all the variables occurred
freely. But we can bind a freely occurring variable by placing before the formula in
which it occurs the phrase

140
Karl R. Popper
(A) “Whosoever he1 may be . . .”
or the phrase
(E) “There exists at least one he1 such that . . .”
The phrase (A) is called the “universal quantifier (binding he1)”, the phrase (E) is
called “the existential quantifier (binding he1)”.
The theory of quantifiers will be sketched in the next section; in the present section,
we deal merely with formulae and variables in general. But it may be mentioned
that, if all variables of a function are bound, the function is a closed statement, i.e.,
a statement proper. Or in other words, an open statement may give rise to a closed
one in either of the two following ways: by substituting names for the free variables,
or by binding the free variables with the help of quantifiers. For example, the open
statement “If he is a good physician, then he is a good man” may give rise to the
statements:
(1) “If Ernest is a good physician then he is a good man.”
(2) (A) “Whosoever he may be – if he is a good physician then |
224
he is a good man.”
(This may be said to be the same as “All good physicians are good men”: a universal
statement.)
(2) (E) “There exists some he such that if he is a good physician then he is a good
man.” (This may be interpreted as: “There exists somebody who, if he is a good
physician, is also a good man”: an existential statement.)
We said before that the quantifiers may be placed before a function; but in another
language (or in the same), they may be placed after the function, etc. In other words,
the same problems arise as those we discussed in section 3 in connexion with
conjunction, and the position of the sign “and”. We shall, therefore, not assume that
all the languages we wish to discuss contain distinguishable signs which we can call
quantifiers. What we shall discuss, in the next section, is merely the way in which the
formulae, denoted by
𝑎
and by
𝐴𝑥𝑎
are related, if 𝐴𝑥𝑎is equivalent to the result of applying universal quantification (with
regard to the variable 𝑥) to the formula 𝑎.
The sign “𝐴𝑥” has therefore no more independent meaning for us than the sign
“∧”; nevertheless, we shall loosely speak of “𝐴𝑥” as of the name of a universal
quantifier binding 𝑥, and of “𝐸𝑥” as of the name of an existential quantifier binding 𝑥.
Leaving the quantifiers and the rules of inference which are to determine their
meaning to the next section, we now turn to the theory of another and even more
fundamental logical operation, also comparable to conjunction, viz., the operation of
substituting the variable 𝑦for the variable 𝑥in the formula 𝑎. The intuitive idea of
substituting the variable “he1” for the variable “he2” in the formula “he1 loved he2”
or “he1 killed he2”, and the difference such a substitution should make to the meaning
of a formula, seems to be perfectly clear. In fact, this idea seems to be so obvious that
it is usually accepted as a kind of descriptive term that is not in need (and perhaps
not capable of) logical analysis – least of all, of an analysis in terms of derivability.

3 New Foundations for Logic
141
But the operation of substitution plays a very important part in quantification theory,
and an attempt to reduce it to the concept of derivability seems highly desirable if we
wish to build up a coherent theory.
For this purpose we first introduce the symbol “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” as a convenient name for
the formula which is the result of the substitution of the variable 𝑦for the variable
𝑥in the formula 𝑎, in |
225
all places of the occurrence of 𝑥. (If 𝑥does not occur in 𝑎,
then 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is the same as 𝑎.) As in the case of the compounds, we are not going to
characterise this result itself, but rather its logical force – i.e., any formula which is
equivalent to the result.
To this end, we first postulate, as a preparation, PF1, PF2, and PF3.
(PF1) If 𝐿is one of the languages under consideration, then the formulae of 𝐿and
the name-variables of 𝐿have no member in common.
(PF2) 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is a formula (of 𝐿) if, and only if, 𝑎is a formula (of 𝐿), and 𝑥and 𝑦are
name-variables (of 𝐿).
(PF3) If 𝑎is a formula then there exists at least one name-variable 𝑥such that 𝑎//𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

for any name-variable 𝑦.
The contents of the first two of these postulates are plain. The third has mainly the
function of ensuring that, for every formula (especially for every open statement),
there exists at least one variable which does not occur in it.22 (We mentioned before
that, if 𝑥does not occur in 𝑎, then 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is the same as 𝑎.)
We now proceed to the primitive rules of derivation which lay down the precise
meaning in which the term “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” is used within the theory of inference. These rules
look complicated, but this is only due to their notation: their content is trivial indeed.
(6.1)
If, for every 𝑧, 𝑎//𝑎 𝑦
𝑧
 and 𝑏//𝑏 𝑦
𝑧
, then 𝑎//𝑏→𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
//𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
,
that is, in brief: equal substitutions in equal formulae have equal results. This rule
assures the continued substitutivity of equivalence in the theory of statement-functions
and of quantification.
(6.2)
𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
//𝑎.
This is plain.
(6.3)
If 𝑥≠𝑦, then (𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑥
𝑧
 //𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
,
that is: once we have substituted 𝑦for 𝑥, then 𝑥no longer occurs (provided 𝑦≠𝑥),
and further substitutions for 𝑥have, therefore, no effect.
(6.4)
(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑦
𝑧
//(𝑎 𝑥
𝑧
) 𝑦
𝑧
,
|
226
that is: if we substitute first 𝑦for 𝑥and then 𝑧for 𝑦, then the result is the same as if
we had substituted at once 𝑧for 𝑥and, besides, 𝑧for 𝑦.
22 Or, at least, upon which it does not depend. ⟨Footnote added in the Errata.⟩

142
Karl R. Popper
(6.5)
(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑧
𝑦
//(𝑎 𝑧
𝑦
) 𝑥
𝑦
,
that is, if we substitute for two variables 𝑥and 𝑧, the same variable 𝑦, then it is
irrelevant which of these two substitutions we undertake first.
(6.6)
If 𝑤≠𝑥; 𝑥≠𝑢; and 𝑢≠𝑦, then (𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
)  𝑢
𝑤
 //(𝑎  𝑢
𝑤
) 𝑥
𝑦
.
This says that, if we substitute for two different variables, 𝑥and 𝑢, two other variables,
𝑦and 𝑤, then it is irrelevant which of the two substitutions we undertake first –
provided always that the variable to be substituted for 𝑥does not coincide with 𝑢, and
vice versa.
These six primitive rules determine the meaning of the symbol “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” in a way
precisely analogous to the way in which, say, rules 3.1 to 3.3 determine the meaning
of conjunction. And the meaning of “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” is determined, precisely as was that of
conjunction, with the help of the concept of derivability, “/”.
To give a few examples of secondary rules: we can obtain first, from postulate PF3
(6.01)
If, for any 𝑥and 𝑦, 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
//𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
, then 𝑎//𝑏.
From this and 6.1, we obtain
(6.02)
If, for every 𝑧, 𝑎//𝑎 𝑦
𝑧
 and 𝑏//𝑏 𝑦
𝑧
, then
𝑎//𝑏↔(for every 𝑥: 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
//𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
).
Another example, secondary to 6.2; 6.4; 6.5, is:
(6.03)
(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑦
𝑥
//𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
.
Quite important is the fact that, with the help of “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”, we can define a new
concept – the non-occurrence of 𝑥in 𝑎, or, perhaps more precisely, the non-relevant
occurrence of 𝑥in 𝑎(or the conception: “a-does-not-depend-on-x”). We denote this
idea by “𝑎`𝑥” (read: “a-without-x”) and define it as follows:
(D6.1)
𝑎//𝑎`𝑥↔(for any 𝑦: 𝑎//𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
).
|
227
That is: 𝑎is equivalent to ⟨a⟩-without-x if, and only if, 𝑎is equivalent to whatever
may be the result of substituting in ⟨𝑎⟩for 𝑥.
If we neglect this concept then the result is, as a rule, that some formulae can be
proved in the systems in question which, in effect, amount to the assertion that there
exists only one individual, in the realm of individuals to which the name-variables of
𝐿refer, that is in the universe of discourse of the language under consideration. This
result is highly undesirable, and in order to make explicit that such a result is frankly
contradictory to our intentions, I suggest including in our list of postulates for the
logic of functions the following:e
e Cp. the remark by Bernays in a letter to Popper (this volume, § 21.7, end of page 4) and Popper’s
reply (this volume, § 21.8).

3 New Foundations for Logic
143
(PF4) In every language under consideration, there exists at least one 𝑎, one 𝑥, and
one 𝑦, such that23
𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑡/ 𝑓.
Since “𝑡/ 𝑓” can be shown to be contradictory, this postulate has the result that a
theory in which the rule
𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

(1)
or even
𝑎`𝑦/𝑎`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦

(2)
holds becomes frankly contradictory. But these rules (1) or (2) are just the rules
asserting in effect that there exists only one individual. For they assert that all formulae
such as “he1 loves he2” are equivalent to “he1 loves he1”; and this can be so only if
“he1 is not identical with he2” is equivalent to “he1 is not identical with he1”, which
is only the case if there exists only one he.
This indicates that we may be able to express identity and difference of individuals
with the help of the means at our disposal; and although we cannot, of course, define
the sign of identity in 𝐿(there may be no such sign in 𝐿), we can, again, as in the
case of conjunction, define the logical force of any statement-function expressing
identity between the variables 𝑥and 𝑦. If we denote such a function by “Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)”
we can define:24
𝑎//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔(for every 𝑏and 𝑧: ((𝑏//𝑏`𝑥& 𝑏//𝑏`𝑦) →𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
) &
(D6.2)
((for every 𝑐and 𝑢: ((𝑐//𝑐`𝑥& 𝑐//𝑐`𝑦) →𝑏, 𝑐 𝑢
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑢
𝑦
)) →𝑏/𝑎))
Difference is easy to define:
(D6.3)
𝑎//Dff (𝑥, 𝑦) ↔𝑎//¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦).
This shows that these two concepts are logical concepts, and that the corresponding
signs – if any – of the languages under consideration are formative signs.
23 Here we could write, more simply, “𝑏/𝑐” instead of “𝑡/ 𝑓”. ⟨Footnote added in the Errata.⟩
24 To be exact, we have, of course, to add the following postulate as a preliminary to the definition.
(A similar postulate would have to be added for difference.)
(P Idt) If 𝑥and 𝑦are name variables, then Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) is a formula.
Furthermore, our defining rules of substitution should be extended by introducing such rules as:
(Idt(𝑥, 𝑦))  𝑥
𝑧
//Idt(𝑧, 𝑦).
|
228
(A)
(Idt(𝑥, 𝑦))  𝑦

If 𝑥≠𝑢≠𝑦, then Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)  𝑢
𝑧
//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦).

7. Quantification
The theory of quantification is too subtle to be analysed in detail within the framework
of this paper. All I shall attempt is to show that our two rules, 7.1 and 7.2, are not
more complicated than previous ones, and that they can be considered as definitions
of universal and existential quantifications.
Our two primitive rules are25
(7.1)
If 𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
 is a formula, then: 𝑎`𝑦/𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔𝑎`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦

or in a different way of writing:
If 𝑎and 𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
 are formulae, then: 𝑎/𝐴𝑥𝑏↔𝑎/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦

(𝑎= 𝑎`𝑦; 𝑏= 𝑏`𝑦)
(7.2)
If 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 and 𝑏are formulae, then: 𝐸𝑥𝑎`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦↔𝑎`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏`𝑦
or in alternative formulation:
𝐸𝑥𝑎/𝑏↔𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏
(𝑎= 𝑎`𝑦; 𝑏= 𝑏`𝑦).
If we wish, we can transform these rules into explicit definitions:
𝑎`𝑦//𝐴𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔(for every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝑐`𝑦/𝑎`𝑦↔𝑐`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
)
|
229
(D7.1)
𝑎`𝑦//𝐸𝑥𝑏`𝑦↔(for every 𝑐`𝑦: 𝑎`𝑦/𝑐`𝑦↔𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑐`𝑦).
(D7.2)
The definitions are, as in previous cases, no improvement – they only establish the
fact that quantification can be defined directly on the basis provided by sections 2
or 3, and the primitive rules 6.1 to 6.6.
I do not claim that the two new primitive rules are trivial in the sense in which
our basic rules of sections 2 and 3, or even the rules of section 4, are trivial. There
is, without doubt, a certain subtlety involved in the way these rules make use of the
concepts “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” and “𝑎`𝑥”26 defined in section 6, – a subtlety which defies a simple
25 Postulates and rules of substitution have also to be assumed, corresponding to those mentioned in
the last footnote.
26 The use of “𝑎`𝑥”, however, is avoidable in all the primitive rules and definitions; i.e., we can write,
more lengthily but more precisely and clearly (𝑥≠𝑦must always be assumed here):
𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝐴𝑥(𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
) ↔𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦

(7.1)
𝐸𝑥(𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
)/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
 ↔𝑎 𝑥

/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥

(7.2)
𝑎 𝑦

𝑥
/𝑐 𝑦

Of the “rules of substitution” referred to in the last note we may state explicitly:

explanation. Yet anybody who is conversant with quantification theory will, I am sure,
be astonished that rules of this comparative degree of simplicity – and, for those who
are accustomed to this kind of thing, even triviality – are sufficient. For the hitherto
known comparable systems of quantification theory are much more complicated. For
example, the well-known system of Hilbert and Ackermann contains (in place of our
two rules) two axioms; two rules rather similar to our own; four very complicated
rules for the handling of variables; and at least one rule forbidding certain operations
(which are permitted in our system). All these rules, except the last mentioned, can
be shown to be secondary to our two rules. Or to take another system – the very
interesting and suggestive one of Quine’s Mathematical Logic. This system takes
only the universal quantifier as primitive. (The existential quantifier is introduced by a
well-known definition with the help of the universal quantifier and negation.) Quine’s
system corresponds therefore to our one rule 7.1. But Quine needs five axioms –
partly rather complicated ones – which can, of course, all be shown to be secondary
to our rule 7.1.
Among the secondary rules which can be shown to be valid in every adequate
theory of quantification, there are extremely complicated ones – here logic definitely
ceases to be trivial. But it is our contention that these complications are merely due
to the wealth of possible iterations and combinations of essentially trivial rules. For
even if our latest defining rules are no longer very trivial, they are only definitions,
that is to say, nothing but abbreviations; and they all go back to one specific logical
concept – the concept of derivability, “/”, introduced by the undoubtedly trivial rules
of sections 2 and 3.
8. Derivation and Demonstration
|
230
If we omit from our system the definitions of tautology and contradiction, D5.0 and
D5.00, then our whole system is one of purely derivational logic. By this we mean the
following. Take any language in which ordinary descriptive statements occur, such as,
in English, statements like “If it is raining then the streets are slippery” whose truth
or falsity cannot be decided by merely logical considerations (in contra-distinction to
the tautology “If it is raining then it is raining”). Call these descriptive statements
“non-logical statements”. Then we can define:
(D8.1) A system of primitive rules of derivation is called “purely derivational” if,
and only if, we can give such examples for each primitive rule that all of the
statements (whether components or compounds) which occur in the examples
are non-logical.
The point of a purely derivational logic is this: it is a system intended from the
and:
If 𝑥≠𝑦, then (𝐴𝑥𝑎)  𝑦

𝑧
).
Corresponding rules of substitution hold for existential quantification. ⟨Footnote added in the

146
Karl R. Popper
start to be a theory of inference in the sense that it allows us to derive from certain
informative (non-logical) statements other informative statements.
Most systems of modern logic are not purely derivational, and some (for example
in the case of Hilbert Ackermann) are not derivational at all. They operate not so
much with rules of inference as with axioms or with rules of proof (axiom schemata).
That is to say, they take as primitive such assertions as “All statements designated by
‘𝑎> 𝑎’ are true” (or “are provable” or “follow from the empty class of premises”,
etc.; these are just so many ways of stating axiom schemata).
These procedures are in themselves unexceptionable. But they are liable to blur
the distinction between derivation and proof; they are liable to create the impression
that every logical proof is a derivation whose first premises are logical axioms.
But this impression is definitely wrong. It is true that a derivation whose premises
are logical axioms is a proof. But this is so only (1) because every derivation whose
premises are provable is a proof, and (2) because the so-called logical axioms are in
fact provable.
Let us consider for a moment one of the intuitive ways which we use in proofs, –
say in an indirect proof.
Assume that we succeed in deriving, from one premise 𝑎
𝑎/𝑏
(1)
𝑎/¬𝑏
(2)
|
231
Then we argue in this way: 𝑎must be absurd, for from it follows 𝑏as well as ¬𝑏,
and therefore 𝑏∧¬𝑏, which is certainly false. Thus 𝑎is logically refuted; but its
negation, ¬𝑎, must be true. Thus we have proved ¬𝑎.
If we look at this argument, then we see that it refers to two derivations, (1) and
(2); and that it argues from derivability to refutability and demonstrability.
In this way, all proofs refer to derivations; the derivations are the most conspicuous
parts in proofs; but the derivation is not the proof.
Take another example.
If we find that the following derivations are valid
𝑎/𝑏
(1)
¬𝑎/𝑏
(2)
then we say that we have proved 𝑏. For we say, one of the two premises, 𝑎or ¬𝑎,
must be true; and if both the derivations are valid, the truth of the true premise must
be transmitted to the conclusion. Thus 𝑏must be true – we have proved 𝑏.
Now what these proof schemata have in common is this: They use derivation.
But while derivation only establishes that the conclusion is true provided that the
premises are true, the proof seeks to establish the truth of its conclusion independently
of the question whether the premises are true or false. It tries to establish the truth of
the conclusion unconditionally.
But is such a thing possible? Yes, it is possible, although only for comparatively
rather uninformative statements – for what we may call “logical truisms”.

3 New Foundations for Logic
147
We can now give a definition of a logical proof or demonstration:
(D8.2) The statement 𝑎is demonstrable ↔the statement 𝑎can be validly derived
from any premise whatsoever.
This means, indeed, that the statement can be shown, by means of derivations, to
be true unconditionally – independently of any particular premise. (If we derive it
from 𝑏and doubt the truth of 𝑏, we can at once derive it from ¬𝑏also, or from 𝑐, etc.)
We shall write
⊢𝑎
for “the statement 𝑎is demonstrable”. Then D8.2 becomes:
(D8.2+)
⊢𝑎↔(for any statement 𝑏: 𝑏/𝑎);
we can, similarly, define refutability, writing
𝑎
for “𝑎is refutable”:
(D8.3)
𝑎↔(for any statement 𝑏: 𝑎/𝑏).
Now on the basis of our purely derivational logic, it is possible to show strictly: |
232
(8.1) All the so-called axioms of the logic of propositions and propositional functions
are provable; for example, those of Principia Mathematica, etc.
(8.2) Every statement that can be validly derived from a demonstrable statement is
demonstrable, i.e.,
(⊢𝑎& 𝑎/𝑏) ⊢𝑏.
(8.3) If we add demonstrable statements to the premises of any derivation, then the
validity or invalidity of the derivation remains unaffected.
All these are principles which have been more or less intuitively used so far, but
which can be strictly established as consequences of our definition of proof.
But there are further results. For example we can easily show
(8.4)
𝑎/𝑏→(⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏),
which is only another form of 8.2; but at the same time, the converse is not true, that
is to say, we must be careful not to assert that
(⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏) →𝑎/𝑏.
(Take 𝑎to be non-logical and 𝑏to be contradictory: this is a counterexample.)
This warning is very important, for there are valid rules of proof of the theory of
statement-functions such that
(8.5)
⊢𝑎`𝑦↔⊢𝑎`𝑦
 𝑥

is invalid.27 Among the valid rules of proof are the important rules
𝑎`𝑥/𝑏→𝑎`𝑥/𝐴𝑥𝑏.
(8.9)
𝑎`𝑦/𝑏`𝑦
 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑎`𝑦/𝐴𝑥𝑏.
(8.91)
Now these – for example 8.9 – may be transformed in this way:
(8.92)
⊢𝑎`𝑥> 𝑏→⊢𝑎`𝑥> 𝐴𝑥𝑏.
But they must not be transformed in this way:28
𝑎`𝑥> 𝑏/𝑎`𝑥> 𝐴𝑥𝑏,
|
233

could be shown to be valid – which violates our postulate PF4, of section 6.
Now all the mistakes here warned against do actually vitiate some otherwise
very excellent books on modern logic – an indication that the distinction between
(conditional) rules of proof or rules of demonstration on the one side and rules of
derivation on the other cannot be neglected without involving oneself in contradictions.
It may be mentioned, in passing, that derivational logic must operate with a theory
of open sentence functions, while demonstrational logic may neglect this part of
logic.
We may perhaps sum up by saying that a purely derivational logic can get over an
awkward dualism which demonstrational logic cannot avoid. Demonstrational logic
must start with axioms – at least one – and rules of inferences – at least something
like the modus ponens. As opposed to this, derivational logic operates monistically,
i.e., with rules of inference alone. The so-called axioms of the various systems of the
logic of demonstration can be proved without assuming one of them.
9. Metalanguage and Object Language
Why do we study logic? We all understand our language, which means that we all
know how to draw inferences, as we have seen. We do not need logical theory for
27 Cp., as opposed to this, Carnap, Formalization of Logic ⟨Carnap, 1943⟩, p. 137, D. 28–2, rule 10.
28 Cp. Carnap, ibid., p. 138, rule 11; this is undoubtedly suggested by Hilbert-Bernays’ way of
writing these rules in the same style as the modus ponens (cp. pp. 105f.) which suggests that they are
rules of derivation. Hilbert Ackermann, on the other hand, write p. 57 the modus ponens as if it were
a conditional rule of proof.

being able to draw inferences; nor does the study of logical theory lead to a method
of making all inferences fool-proof.
There are two obvious reasons for studying logic. One is curiosity, theoretical
interest in languages and ⟨in⟩their rules of use. This needs no apology. The other is
practical. Our naturally grown languages have not been designed for the use to which
we put them in scientific and mathematical investigations. They definitely do not
always stand up too well to the strain of modern civilisation: paradoxes arise, spurious
theories; the conclusiveness of some of our subtle arguments becomes doubtful. Such
practical needs lead us to study the rules of language in order to design an instrument
fit for use in science.
But for the study of language, we have to use language; and we have to use it freely
and fully, without being afraid of using it. There is no study of any object whatever
without the full |
234
use of language if we need it. As the zoologist uses language
to describe the behaviour of reptiles or lions, so the student of language must use
language in order to describe the behaviour of statements, formulae, variables, etc.
But is there not a danger that our studies may be vitiated if we use and study
language at the same time? Undoubtedly there is. But there exists a simple device
which seems to get over these difficulties beautifully. It is, simply, always to distinguish
the language which is the object of our studies (the “object language”) from the
language we are using. The latter, if used for the discussion of other languages, is
called the “metalanguage”.
The fundamental idea of the distinction between object language and metalanguage
is this: we simply cannot use and discuss one and the same language at the same time.
Thus we decide to acknowledge the impossibility, and we do not worry too much
about the language we are using – as long as we are using it. If we feel doubtful
whether our way of using it was quite in order, then nothing will prevent us from
proceeding, later, to an investigation of our metalanguage, using thereby what has
been called a “meta-metalanguage” (etc., as long as we like to go on).
I mentioned that we should use the metalanguage freely. By this I mean that we
must not be deterred, for example, from using conjunction in the metalanguage when
defining conjunction in the object language. We must speak, if we wish to define.
It is impossible to speak properly in our language of ordinary use without using
conjunction, the conditional, and indeed all its formative signs. Here is no vicious
circularity: we do not attempt to define the words we are using, but we use words in
order to define very general concepts referring to other languages.
The demand that, in order to avoid circularity, we should avoid, in defining signs of
the object language, the use of formative signs in the metalanguage, is no better than
the impossible demand that we should avoid the use of statements in the metalanguage;
for in most languages we can have no statements at all if we avoid formative signs.
Incidentally we can, in our definitions, avoid even the appearance of circularity – we
can for example define negation without making use of negation in the metalanguage,
and we can define “𝑎∧𝑏” without using “&” in the metalanguage, and “𝑎∨𝑏”
without using “or”.
As to our own investigations, we find, if we proceed to study our metalanguage in
the meta-metalanguage, that our meta-language |
235
can be easily formalised. It turns

150
Karl R. Popper
out that we do not need more than positive logic, including quantifiers (if we exclude
the postulate PF4 which need not be assumed). Thus it happened that we defined
negation, without using it in the meta-language (incidentally and without intending
it). This fact may be interesting for some reason or other; but had we to make use of
negation in the metalanguage, in order to define what we mean by negation in the
various object languages we were then studying, there would have been no circularity
involved.

the meeting of the Koninklĳke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen. These notes are omitted
in the present version. The title of the former was newly typeset and the addition “(Communicated
by Prof. L. E. J. Brouwer.)” was dropped from the title. The original pagination (pp. 1214–1224)
was preserved in brackets, and the new pagination (pp. 561–571) was added. Page numbers in our
margins thus refer to Popper (1947d) but the page numbers of Popper (1947e) are also provided
in the concordance. For better readability we have reformatted lists (a)–(d), (a′)–(c′) and (1)–(2)
from normal paragraphs to items with block text. A list of errata in footnote 1 for Popper (1947c) is
omitted here. These errata are contained in the more complete list of errata Popper (1948e) and were
corrected in this volume. The symbol 𝑉for the metalinguistic “or” has been replaced throughout
by Ô. Details concerning the publication of this article can be found in Popper’s correspondence
with Brouwer; cf. Chapter 22 of this volume.

The customary systems of modern lower functional logic, such as Principia Math-
ematica, or the systems of Hilbert-Ackermann, Hilbert-Bernays, or Heyting, etc.,
proceed in the following way.
(a)
Undefined primitive formative signs of the system under construction are laid
down – at least one (either alternative denial or conjoint denial) for propositional
logic and one (the universal or existential quantifier) for quantification theory.

(b) Unproved primitive propositions or axioms are laid down – at least one for
propositional logic, and one for quantification theory.
(c)
Primitive rules of inference (such as the modus ponens) for the formative signs are
laid down, at the very least one for propositional logic and one for quantification
theory.
(d) Some further very general primitive rules of inference (such as some principles
stating that the inference relation is transitive and reflexive) which do not refer
to formative signs are assumed, either explicitly or, more often, tacitly.
The procedure here described is not always strictly adhered to, to be sure; the
axioms (b) for example, may be expressed in the form of rules of inference (c), etc. –
But to my knowledge, the scheme sketched is the one most frequently adopted.
In an earlier publication1, I have outlined a method by which the procedure can be
considerably simplified. This method consists, in the main, in this.
It is observed that the traditional procedure must make use of a language of
communication – the metalanguage – in which it discusses and |
1215
describes the
linguistic system under consideration – the object language. It is further observed
that all systems are bound to use metalinguistic concepts such as “The conclusion 𝑎
is derivable from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛”, and “If 𝑎is demonstrable then 𝑏is
demonstrable”, etc.
Now it can be shown that, if we have at our disposal the first of these two
metalinguistic ideas, i.e., the concept of deducibility (deducibility from 𝑛premises
is an 𝑛+ 1-termed metalinguistic predicate), characterized by a few trivial rules of
inference of the kind (d), such as the transitivity and reflexivity principles which are
assumed in all the customary systems, then the following holds:
(a′)
No sign such as a sign for alternative denial or for a quantifier need be laid
down as primitive, since names for the alternative denial and the quantifiers
and all the other formative signs of an object language can be defined in terms
of deducibility.
(b′) No unproved axioms or primitive propositions need to be assumed, since the
axioms or primitive propositions of the usual systems can be shown to be all
demonstrable (on the basis of an explicit definition of demonstrability in terms
of deducibility).
(c′)
No primitive rules of inference of kind (c) need to be laid down, since all the
rules of inference pertaining to the formative signs of the system follow from
the definitions of these signs.
In other words, given the concept of deducibility and a few primitive rules of kind
(d) to characterize it (I have called an independent system of such rules a “basis”),
everything else can be obtained by way of explicit definitions in terms of deducibility
(“inferential definitions”).
In this way, a considerable simplification, as compared with the customary systems,
is achieved. But, as will be shown here, we can even go further.

4 Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference
155
The inferential definitions of the conjunction (or the alternative denial) and of the
result of one of the quantifications, for example, of universal quantification, can be
reformulated in such a way as to incorporate all the rules of inference mentioned. In
this way, we can get rid of even the few trivial primitive rules (d) which were left in
the previous approach; in other words, we obtain the whole formal structure of logic
from metalinguistic inferential definitions alone.
II
Our theory is completely metalinguistic.
Our universe of discourse consists of expressions of certain object languages; we
consider especially the statements (open or closed) and the name-variables of these
languages.
We shall use, in the metalanguage, “𝑎”; “𝑏”; “𝑐”; etc.; “𝑎1”; “𝑎2”; “𝑎𝑛”; “𝑏1”;
“𝑏2”; “𝑏𝑚”; etc., as variables whose values are the statements (open or closed) of an
object language under consideration, and “𝑢”; “𝑣”; “𝑤”; “𝑥”; “𝑦”; “𝑧”; as variables
whose values are the name-variables of that object-language.
|
1216
We shall use two undefined concepts: (1) deducibility and (2) substitution.
(1) The notation
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏”
will be used in order to express the assertion “From the statements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛
of the object language, the statement 𝑏of that language can be deduced.” The
sign “/” is an 𝑛+ 1-termed predicate of the metalanguage.
(2) The notation
“𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”
will be used as a (variable) metalinguistic name of the statement which is the
result of substituting, in the statement 𝑎(open or closed), the variable 𝑦for the
variable 𝑥, wherever it occurs. 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is identical with 𝑎if 𝑥does not occur in 𝑎.
These two are the only specific metalinguistic primitive signs used in our metalan-
guage.
Apart from the specific metalinguistic or logical signs “/” and “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”, we shall
use, in the metalanguage, the normal means of expression, including “and”, “if and
only if”, etc.
The following abbreviations will be used in the metalanguage:
“. . . →. . .” for “if . . . then . . .”
“. . . ↔. . .” for “. . . if, and only if . . .”
“. . . & . . .” for “. . . and . . .”.
Also, the expression “for every . . .” (followed by variables) will be used, and “=” and
“≠” (flanked by “𝑥”, “𝑦”, etc.). Brackets will be used in the customary way.

156
Karl R. Popper
We do not undertake here to formalize our metalanguage. But it may be mentioned
that the only logical rules needed in the metalanguage (except where we treat
modalities) are those ofthe positive partofthe Hilbert-Bernays calculus ofpropositions
as far as they pertain to “if-then”, “if, and only if”, and to “and” (i.e. groups I, II,
IV), and the rules for identity. The rules for negation need not be assumed (only
some of their applications to “𝑥≠𝑦”); but we need rules for universal quantification,
especially the rule of specification: “If (for every 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛: (𝐹(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛))) then
𝐹(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑛).”
III
Apart from the primitive signs, defined signs are introduced by definitions. These are,
except the sign “//” for mutual deducibility, variable metalinguistic names of certain
statements (open or closed), viz., either of so-called compounds or of the results of
quantification.
We shall use the following signs, to be defined later: |
1217
1. “𝑎//𝑏” will be used to express that 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎.
2. “𝑎∧𝑏” will be used as name of the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏.
3. “𝑎> 𝑏” will be used as name of the conditional statement with the antecedent 𝑎
and the consequent 𝑏.
4. “𝑎∨𝑏” will be used as name of the disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏.
5. “𝑎𝑐” will be used as name of the classical negation of 𝑎.
6. “𝑎𝑖” will be used as name of the intuitionist negation of 𝑎.
7. “(𝐴𝑧𝑎) 𝑥
𝑦
” will be used as name of the statement which results from first applying
to 𝑎universal quantification with regard to 𝑧and then substituting, in the result,
𝑦for 𝑥wherever it occurs.
8. “𝐴𝑧(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
)” will be the name of the statement which results from the universal
quantification of 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 with regard to 𝑧.
9. “(𝐸𝑧𝑎) 𝑥
𝑦
” is like 7, but with existential quantification.
10. “𝐸𝑧(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
)” is like 8, but with existential quantification.
We shall not lay down primitive rules or axioms etc. for our undefined terms,
but we shall, instead, frame three of our explicit definitions in such a way that the
few rules needed to characterize our undefined terms emerge from these definitions.
These three definitions will be fundamental to the others, and will be called “Basic
Definitions” (DB).
The definition DB1, of “//”, is basic for all others; DB2, of “∧”, is basic for
propositional (and therefore also for functional) logic; and DB7, of “(𝐴𝑥𝑏) 𝑥
𝑦
”, is
basic for quantification theory. Each of the other definitions of propositional logic
presupposes DB1 and DB2, and D8 to D10 presuppose, in addition, DB7. None of
them except D10 presupposes other than Basic Definitions. The only definitions in
which defined terms (other than “//”) are used are D8 and D10, which use terms
defined in D7 and D9 respectively. (The relation between D8 and D7, or D10 and D9,

4 Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference
157
is somehow akin to recursiveness; but these are the only definitions needed in which
anything resembling recursiveness occurs.)
IV
We now proceed to the definitions of the concepts mentioned. The first definition, of
“//”, uses only “↔” apart from “/”. All the later ones make use of “//” also. They
have all the form
“𝑎//the definiendum ↔(for every . . : (. . .))”
That is to say, we do not define, e.g., conjunction, but rather the logical force of
conjunction. (I have discussed this problem at length elsewhere1,2.)
Here is the list of the definitions.

I shall now briefly outline the method by which we obtain, from this system of
inferential definitions, the systems of rules of inference which were sketched in my
earlier papers referred to.
Since
(5.01)
𝑎/𝑐↔𝑎/𝑐
is true whatever the meaning of the predicate “/” may be, we obtain, substituting 𝑎
for 𝑏, from DB1
(5.02)
𝑎//𝑎
and therefore
(5.03)
𝑏∧𝑐//𝑏∧𝑐
This allows us to obtain from DB2, by substituting “𝑏∧𝑐” for “𝑎”, the set of five
rules
(5.20)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(5.201)
𝑏/𝑐→(𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
|
1219
(5.202)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏/𝑐
(5.203)
see below
(5.204)
𝑎1/𝑎1
Rule 5.203, viz.:
(5.203)
𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐
can be easily obtained from 5.201 and 5.204. Now it is quite obvious that the system
of the four rules 5.201 to 5.204 is equivalent to the following four rules 5.21 to 5.24:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(5.21)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑏
(5.22)

4 Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference
159
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏
(5.23)
𝑎/𝑎
(5.24)
But this set, together with 5.20, is equivalent to one which I have elsewhere1 described
as “Basis II”, and which can be shown to provide a sufficient basis for propositional
logic, and especially for the definitions D3 to D6. In the presence of 5.20, the rules
5.21 to 5.24 characterize our first undefined concept, “/”, sufficiently for operating
with it successfully.
By the same method, i.e., by substituting “𝐴𝑥𝑏” for “𝑎” (and “𝑎” for “𝑐”) in DB7,
we obtain the rule
(5.70)
𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/(𝐴𝑥𝑏) 𝑥
𝑦
 ↔𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥

and together with it the following six rules which characterize our second undefined
concept, “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”, sufficiently for operating with it successfully. These rather trivial
rules are
If 𝑣≠𝑥; 𝑥≠𝑦; and 𝑦≠𝑢, then: (𝑎 𝑥
𝑢
) 𝑦
𝑣
 //(𝑎 𝑦
𝑣
) 𝑥
𝑢

(5.71)
If 𝑥≠𝑦, then: (𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑥
𝑧
 //𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

(5.72)
(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑦
𝑧
//(𝑎 𝑥
𝑧
) 𝑦
𝑧

(5.73)
(𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
) 𝑧
𝑦
//(𝑎 𝑧
𝑦
) 𝑥
𝑦

(5.74)
If, for every 𝑧, 𝑎//𝑎 𝑦
𝑧
 and 𝑏//𝑏 𝑦
𝑧
, then: (𝑎//𝑏→𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
//𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
)
(5.75)
𝑎 𝑥
𝑥
//𝑎
(5.76)
If we now consider also definitions other than basic ones then we find that, in the
presence of 5.20 to 5.24, each of the definitions DB1 to D6 is equivalent to the
corresponding rule of inference in the following list:
𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑎)
(5.1)
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐

Turning to the non-basic definitions of Quantification Theory, we find that from D8,
we obtain the two rules

which I have described elsewhere4 as “rules of substitution”, and which relate the
two concepts defined in DB7 and D8 to one another. Corresponding remarks hold for
D9 and D10.
It will be seen that the two Basic Definitions DB2 and DB7 are somewhat
complicated. Yet I think that the procedure of incorporating not only 5.20 into a
definition of “∧” but also the rules which make it possible to operate with 5.20, is
perfectly natural. Take DB1. The meaning of “∧” is determined not by 5.20 alone,
but only by 5.20 in connection with 5.21 to 5.24; it seems therefore appropriate to
incorporate 5.21 to 5.24 into our definition of conjunction. Analogous remarks hold
for the six rules incorporated, together with 5.70, in DB7. (See also the next section,
VI.)
It may be asked why conjunction is singled out, of all the propositional compounds,
to serve as basic. The answer is given in an earlier publication1: conjunction (more
precisely, rule 5.20) allows us to simplify the transitivity principle, and such a
simplification is necessary if we wish to incorporate the transitivity principle into
a definition which can be formulated with the means of expression described in
section II. Nevertheless, conjunction is not the only compound which can be used in
this way. Alternative Denial can be used as well.
In the presence of DB1 and DB2, alternative denial can be defined in various ways,
for example:
(D )
𝑎//𝑏
𝑐↔(for every 𝑑1: ((for every 𝑑2: (𝑑2/𝑑1 ↔(𝑑2/𝑏& 𝑑2/𝑐)))
↔(for every 𝑑3: (𝑎, 𝑑1/𝑑3 & (𝑎, 𝑑3/𝑑1 →𝑑3, 𝑑3/𝑑1)))))
All that is necessary for strengthening this definition in such a way that it can serve as
basic instead of DB2 is (1) to replace “𝑑2” by “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛”, and (2) to incorporate
the rules 5.201 to 5.204 in a manner precisely analogous to the way in which they are
incorporated in DB2.
VI
Against our procedure of incorporating the rules 5.201 to 5.204 into DB2, and 5.71
to 5.76 into DB7, the objection may be raised that it does not lead to homogeneous
definitions. I do not think this objection sufficiently important to discuss it here at
length. But I wish to mention that at least one attempt to define the intuitive idea of
homogeneity which underlies this objection leads to the following result.
Rules 5.20 and 5.204 alone are (in the presence of DB1) sufficient for proving
that the left hand side of DB2 follows from the right hand side; |
1221
the other rules,
5.201 and 5.202, which are together with 5.20 and 5.204 incorporated in DB2, are
not needed for this purpose. This shows, it may be said, that they should be taken
out of DB2, and stated separately, as primitive rules. Corresponding remarks may

4 Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference
161
be made about DB7. Here rule 5.70 alone is sufficient (in the presence of DB1 and
DB2) for establishing that the left hand side of DB7 follows from the right hand side.
5.71 to 5.76 are superfluous for this purpose.
In order to meet this objection, we can easily transform DB2 and DB7 in such a
way that the objection no longer holds. All that is necessary for this purpose is to
replace, in DB2, the expression
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏”
by the expressiona
“((𝑏/𝑐→(𝑎1, 𝑎2/𝑏→𝑎3, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)) →𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏)”.
The resulting definition is then “homogeneous” in the sense that all rules (components)
tied up in the definiens are now needed for showing that the left hand side follows
form the right hand side. Similarly, in DB7, we need only replace the expression
“

𝑐 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 ↔𝑐 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥

”
by the expression
“

𝑥≠𝑢≠𝑦→

(𝑐 𝑢
𝑢
) 𝑦
𝑥
/(𝑎 𝑢
𝑢
) 𝑦
𝑥
 ↔(𝑐 𝑦
𝑦
) 𝑦
𝑥
/(𝑏 𝑦
𝑦
) 𝑥
𝑦

”
in order to achieve the corresponding result. In other words, homogeneity of the kind
here indicated (and the same seems to hold for some other kinds) can always be
attained in a trivial way, at the price of making the formulae more complicated. It is
therefore hardly worth worrying about.
It may be mentioned, in this connection, that there are quite a number of equivalent
ways of writing DB2 and DB7. The shortest formula to take the place of DB2 known
to me is the following. (We assume that 𝑛+ 𝑟≥𝑛≥1.)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(for every 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟:
(DB2′)
((𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐))
& (𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟/𝑐)) & 𝑏/𝑏)).
VII
Our system is sufficient for lower functional logic in the sense that its rules of
inference permit all logical transformations which are permissible by force of the
usual lower functional calculi, and that they allow us to establish the demonstrability
of all formulae which are demonstrable in these calculi.
In order to establish sufficiency, it is advisable to introduce the one-termed
metalinguistic predicate
a Originally, this expression reads: ((𝑏/𝑐→(𝑎1, 𝑎2/𝑏→𝑎3, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐)) →𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏).
We have replaced 𝑎3, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐by 𝑎3, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.

162
Karl R. Popper
“⊢𝑎”
|
1222
which we read as “𝑎is demonstrable”. It can be defined by
(D11)
⊢𝑎↔(for every 𝑏: (𝑏/𝑎))
With the help of the means at our disposal, it is easy to show that this definition is
equivalent to the formula
(7.11)
⊢𝑎↔𝑎> 𝑎/𝑎
This formula could be used as a definition. Provided we do not object to the use
of the defined term “𝑎> 𝑎” in the definiens, it may even be said to be preferable
because it uses one variable only, and avoids metalinguistic quantification.
The sufficiency of our system can now be established in the following sense.
Whenever a “proposition” such as
“𝑝⊃𝑝”
can be “asserted” in the system, say, of Principia Mathematica, then the corresponding
formula, in our case
“⊢𝑎> 𝑎”
can be obtained in our metalinguistic system, by using only our definitions.
Whenever the formula in question is intuitionistically valid, it is only necessary
to use, besides Basic Definitions, the definitions of the symbols actually occurring
in the formula. If it is intuitionistically invalid but classically valid, then, even if no
symbol of negation occurs in the formula, D5, the definition of classical negation, is
needed for establishing its demonstrability.
VIII
If we wish to apply our system to some object language L, then certain existential
postulates must be added which correspond to the definitions, such as
(P2) If 𝑏and 𝑐are both statements of L, then there exists a statement 𝑎of L such
that 𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐, and that DB2 is satisfied.
Or:
(P5) If 𝑏is a statement of L, then there exists a statement 𝑎of L such that 𝑎//𝑏𝑐, and
that D5 is satisfied.
(And so on.)
Of course, P2 and P5 suffice for propositional logic, if we wish to use classical
negation, or even one postulate demanding the existence of 𝑎//𝑏
𝑐for every 𝑏and 𝑐.
(This is the real advantage of using alternative denial.)

Our method can be easily extended so as to comprise modal functions. We can
introduce the six symbols5:
(N)
“N 𝑎” for “𝑎is necessary”.
(I)
“I 𝑎” for “𝑎is impossible”.
(L)
“L 𝑎” for “𝑎is logical” (i.e. either necessary or impossible).
(C)
“C 𝑎” for “𝑎is contingent” (or factual).
(P)
“P 𝑎” for “𝑎is possible”.
(U)
“U 𝑎” for “𝑎is uncertain” (or not necessary).
These explanations are inexact, since the six symbols are actually intended to
serve as names of statements of the object language. “N 𝑎”, for example, should be
explained, more lengthily but more precisely, as the name of a statement which asserts
the necessity of the state of affairs described by 𝑎(or the necessity of the proposition
expressed by 𝑎).
For the definitions, we must use “or” in the metalanguage (abbreviated by “Ô”),
based on the appropriate rules. We shall also use “⊢𝑎” and “
𝑎” (i.e. “𝑎is
refutable”), defined by
(D12)
𝑎↔(for every 𝑏: (𝑎/𝑏))
But “⊢” and “ ” are used here as abbreviations only, and should be eliminated with
the help of D11 and D12.
(For the development of the theory of modality, metalinguistic negation is also
needed, together with at least its intuitionistically valid rules.)
Our six definitions are:
(DN)
𝑎//N 𝑏↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (⊢𝑎↔⊢𝑏))
(DI)
𝑎//I 𝑏
↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (⊢𝑎↔
𝑏))
(DL)
𝑎//L 𝑏↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (⊢𝑎↔(⊢𝑏Ô
𝑏)))
(DC)
𝑎//C 𝑏↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (
𝑎↔(⊢𝑏Ô
𝑏)))
(DP)
𝑎//P 𝑏↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (
𝑎↔
𝑏))
(DU)
𝑎//U 𝑏↔((⊢𝑎Ô
𝑎) & (
𝑎↔⊢𝑏))
The main interest of these definitions lies in the fact that our method allows us
here again to avoid the use of defined concepts, such as negation, in the definiens.
5 This list of six modal functions corresponds to the table given by R. Carnap, Meaning and Necessity
⟨Carnap, 1947⟩, p. 175. Cp. also my Logic without Assumptions ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩where, in ⟨footnote
20⟩, a definition of impossibility is given which is equivalent to the one given here, and simpler. The
more complicated definition given here has however the advantage of belonging to a complete set of
six analogous definitions for all the modal functions.

164
Karl R. Popper
Accordingly, any sub-set of these definitions can be combined, for example, with
positive logic, avoiding the use of classical or of any negation. It is also possible, for
example, to introduce only “I 𝑎” |
1224
(impossibility), and to compare the result with the
intuitionist use of negation, etc. Our formulae yield, for example,
(9.1)
I(I 𝑎)//P 𝑎
thus justifying an intuitively obvious theorem (much used by intuitionism).
It appears that from these and our previous definitions taken together, all the valid
rules of modal logic (including quantification theory) can be obtained).
X
The question may be raised whether our method is not so powerful merely because
we employ fairly strong logical means in our metalanguage. It is therefore worth
mentioning that, if we replace our system of definitions (e.g. DB2) by the system of
rules which can be obtained from them (e.g. 5.20 to 5.24; note also that DB1 and D11
can be replaced by 5.1 and 7.11 respectively which do not need any quantifiers, and
that corresponding adjustments can easily be made in the definitions of the modalities),
then there is no need whatever to operate with quantifiers in the metalanguage. (This
result is, perhaps, of some interest in connection with the decision problem). The
logical rules of operating in the metalanguage may be reduced, in this way, to the
rules pertaining to “→” and to “&”. (If we split up our rules 5.1 to 5.4 etc. sufficiently,
even “&” may be avoided.) But no system of logic can be constructed without using
at least “→” in the metalanguage (just as we have to use “/”); for the transitivity
principle – in its simplest form, “𝑎/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎/𝑐)” – must be capable of being
stated, in some way or other, in the metalanguage of every system; for example, in
those systems which (like Nicod’s and Quine’s) use one undefined primitive sign of
the object language for propositional logic.
Our results show that no such undefined sign of the object language (nor anything
representing it in the metalanguage) need be assumed in addition to these necessary
metalinguistic means of expression and to our two undefined specific logical concepts,
and that these two concepts themselves, although undefined, can be, indirectly,
characterized by two explicit definitions, viz. those of conjunction (or alternative
denial) and universal quantification, respectively.
We can therefore say:
Every metalanguage which possesses the means of expression necessary to
formulate the most general rules of inference (such as the principle of transitivity of
inference in the simple form 5.21) possesses all the means necessary for constructing
the whole propositional logic, including the logic of modalities.
Every metalanguage which, in addition, possesses a variable name of the statement
which is the result of the substitution of 𝑥for 𝑦in a statement 𝑎, also possesses all the
means necessary for constructing quantification theory.

Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1948a). On the Theory
of Deduction, Part I. Derivation and its Generalizations. In: Koninklĳke Nederlandse
Akademie van Wetenschappen, Proceedings of the Section of Sciences 51, pp. 173–183.
Editorial notes: The article was reprinted with the printing plates for Popper (1948a) as K. R. Popper
(1948b). On the Theory of Deduction, Part I. Derivation and its Generalizations. In: Indagationes
Mathematicae 10, pp. 44–54. In the latter, the title is followed by the notes “(Communicated by
Prof. L. E. J. Brouwer.)” and “(Communicated at the meeting of November 29, 1947.)”, referring to
the meeting of the Koninklĳke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen. These notes are omitted
in the present version. The title of the former was newly typeset and the addition “(Communicated
by Prof. L. E. J. Brouwer.)” was dropped from the title. The original pagination (pp. 173–183)
was preserved in brackets, and the new pagination (pp. 44–54) was added. Page numbers in our
margins thus refer to Popper (1948a) but the page numbers of Popper (1948b) are also provided in
the concordance. “On the Theory of Deduction” was submitted as one manuscript but had to be
divided into two parts due to demands from the printers or the publisher; cf. the correspondence
between Popper and Brouwer in § 22.4 and § 22.5 of this volume. In his letter to Brouwer of 18
November 1947 (this volume, § 22.4), Popper emphasized the importance of his results and put them
into context. References like ⟨New Foundations for Logic, p. 119⟩refer to the corrected reprint in
this volume.

proposed in three earlier papersa,1, ⟨Popper, 1947b,c,d⟩, to which the present paper
is a sequel.

on these earlier papers.

In section III, a few concepts of the general theory of derivation will be introduced.
Some of these will be used in the subsequent sections in which certain problems
concerning the definitions of classical and intuitionist negation will be discussed.
I
The notation
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏
will be used, as in the earlier papers mentioned, to express the assertion: “The
conclusion 𝑏is derivable from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.” We shall call this the
“/-notation”. In addition to this notation, we shall use in the present paper another
notation to express the same assertion. This new notation, viz.:
𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
will be called the “𝐷-notation”.
We shall here use the 𝐷-notation as our fundamental notation; that is to say, we
shall take
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
as our fundamental undefined concept, and we shall assume that the /-notation has
been introduced with the help of the definition2:
(𝐷/)
𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1 ↔𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
|
174
The use of the 𝐷-notation has the following advantages. First, it gives rise to a
generalisation by suggesting that
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
may be meaningful for 𝑛= 1; and we shall indeed find (in section II) that
𝐷(𝑎)
turns out to be equivalent to “⊢𝑎”, i.e., to “𝑎is demonstrable” (as defined in the earlier
papers). Secondly, the 𝐷-notation assimilates our metalinguistic symbolism still more
closely to that of Hilbert and Bernays. It makes it more obvious that “𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)”
is an 𝑛-termed predicate of our metalanguage; also that it is our only3 undefined
2 As in ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩and ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩, “↔” abbreviates the metalinguistic use of “if and
only if”. Similarly, “→”; “&”; and “Ô” abbreviate “if-then”; “and”; and “or-or both”, respectively.
3 Our undefined symbol “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
” (cp. ⟨Popper, 1947b,c,d⟩) is not, of course, a predicate, but a function
whose values are statements (including statement functions) and whose arguments are a statement
and two individual variables. But this symbol will not be used in the present paper (except in footnote
11, below).

169
predicate, since the class of statements (including statement functions) can be defined
as the domain of the relation 𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛). Ultimately, the 𝐷-notation throws
some light upon the function of the primitive rules which characterize the relation
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛), or upon the function of those secondary rules which take the place of
the primitive rules if we employ, as in ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩, the method of laying down
Basic Definitions. For in the 𝐷-notation, it becomes clear that the main function of
these rules is to relate 𝑛-termed deducibility to 2-termed and 𝑛+𝑟-termed deducibility
(including, more especially, 𝑛+ 1-termed deducibility, in the case of BI.1–2; cp. also
D3.4).
In ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩, two methods of laying down primitive rules were distinguished,
called “Basis I” and “Basis II”, respectively. In the present section, a set forming a
Basis I will be discussed, and in section II, a rule which (together with two definitions)
suffices for Basis II.
The set of primitive rules for Basis I consists of the following two rules4, BI.1 and
BI.2. (It is assumed, for all rules written in the 𝐷-notation, that 1 ≤𝑛and 1 ≤𝑟.)
𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2) ↔𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2, 𝑎2).
(BI.1)
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑎𝑛+1) . . . (𝑎𝑛+𝑟) 𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) →𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎2).
(BI.2)
We shall first sketch the derivation of the most important rules belonging to the
earlier sets.
Putting 𝑛= 2 and 𝑟= 1, we obtain from BI.2:
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) ↔(𝑐) 𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎, 𝑏) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏),
(1.1)
and from this, by substitution and BI.1:
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑎);
(1.2)
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑎, 𝑎)
(by 1.2; BI.1).
(1.3)
|
175
Furthermore, we obtain from BI.2 alone
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) → 𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) →𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎2).
(1.4)
Except for the proof of
𝐷(𝑎) ↔(𝑏)𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)
(1.5)
which we shall give in section II, in order to establish the equivalence of “𝐷(𝑎)” and
“⊢𝑎” (as defined in the earlier papers), we shall give the following derivations in the
/-notation, and we shall base them exclusively upon 1.2′, 1.3′ and 1.4′, i.e., upon 1.2,
1.3 and 1.4 expressed in the /-notation.
4 In the present paper (in contradistinction to the earlier ones) I use the quantifiers “(𝑎)” and “(𝐸𝑎)”
as abbreviations of the metalinguistic phrases “for every 𝑎” and “there exists at least one 𝑎such
that”.

(1.3′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐).
(1.4′)
Our contention is that 1.2′ to 1.4′ are equivalent to the Basis I as characterized in
the earlier papers.
We obtain, for 𝑛= 1 and 𝑛+ 𝑟= 𝑚:
𝑎𝑚, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑎1
(1.2′; 1.3′; 1.4′)
(1.41)
and therefore
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑛;
(1.41)
(1.411)
𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑛;
(1.411)
(1.412)
𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑎𝑛,
(1.411; 1.412; 1.4′)
(1.42)
which can also be written
(1.42′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛),
and which yields, more especially,
(1.421)
𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.
We further obtain
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏;
(1.421; 1.4′)
(1.43)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏;
(1.43)
(1.44′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟/𝑏;
(1.43; 1.44′)
(1.45′)
From 1.4′ and 1.44′ we also obtain:
(1.46′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎1 . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
Rule 1.46′ may be called the “principle of the redundant first premise”; it can be
formulated in words: “If the first premise of an inference is derivable from the
remaining premises, then its omission does not invalidate the inference.” For clearly,
1.46′ is the same as
(1.46′′)
𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1 →(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎2 . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏),
or in our 𝐷-notation:
(1.46′′′)
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) → 𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) →𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎2 . . . , 𝑎𝑛).

Now 1.2′,1.44′,1.45′ form,together with the principle I have called5 “generalized
transitivity principle”, that is to say, with 1.47
(1.47)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & . . . & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚) →(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
a set of rules which constitutes a form of Basis I.
Our contention is that,in the presence of 1.44′ and 1.45′,the generalized transitivity
principle 1.47 can be derived from 1.46′.
The proof of our contention will be given in the /-notation.
We first obtain, from 1.44′ and 1.45′
(1.48)
𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐.
In the presence of of this principle, we only need 1.45′ for our proof; for we need
only to prove

(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 & · · · & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚) →
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
in order to obtain 1.47, since, clearly, 1.47 can be obtained by 1.48 from 1.49. We
now sketch the proof of 1.49 which makes use of 1.45′ only (apart, of course, of
1.46′).
We observe that 1.46′ may be written:
(1.491)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−1/𝑏𝑚→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−1/𝑐).
Applying to this 1.45′, we obtain
(1.492)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚→
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−1/𝑐).
From this we obtain, by substitution,
(1.493)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚−1 →
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−1/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−2/𝑐).
Combining 1.412 and 1.413, we get:
(1.494)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑚−1) →(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚−2/𝑐).

Karl R. Popper
We can continue this procedure for 𝑚−2 steps, i.e., until the premises 𝑏𝑖are
exhausted. The result is 1.49.
It may be remarked that a Basic Definition of “𝑏∧𝑐” (analogous and equivalent
to DB2′ in ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩) may be obtained by making use of 1.2′; 1.3′; and 1.4′;
this definition is DB2I:
(DB2I)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1) . . . (𝑎𝑛+𝑟) (𝑎/𝑎𝑛↔𝑏, 𝑐/𝑎𝑛) &  𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→
(𝑏, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐) & 𝑏/𝑏& 𝑏, 𝑏/𝑏.
This definition may be simplified by replacing “𝑏/𝑏& 𝑏, 𝑏/𝑏” by “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1”;
or else, by “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑚/𝑎1” together with the restriction “1 ≤𝑚≤2”; but even in
the latter case, the simplified definition is still a little stronger than necessary, that is
to say, stronger than DB2I.
We have derived 1.2′; 1.44′; 1.45′ and 1.47 from our BI.1 and BI.2; |
177
the derivation
of BI.1 and BI.2 from the rules mentioned, and therefore the equivalence of the two
sets of rules for Basis I, is trivial6.
II
We now proceed to Basis II. This is not equivalent to Basis I, but to Basis I combined
with the two definitions
(DB1)
𝑎//𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑐/𝑎↔𝑐/𝑏)
and
(DI∧)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑎/𝑑↔𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑).
6 The proof that we can obtain 4.7 (called in ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩“generalized transitivity principle”)
from 4.6′ solves the problem of constructing a complete basis for the general theory of derivation –
such as Basis I, as opposed to Basis II – without having to use 4.7 as primitive. The objection against
4.7 is that it makes use of an unspecified number of conjunctive components in its antecedent; this
may be considered as introducing a new metalinguistic concept – something like an infinite product.
The problem of avoiding 4.7 was discussed, but not solved in ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩. The lack of a solution
led me there to construct Basis II, the need for which, as it were, has now disappeared. But Basis II
turned out to be of interest in itself; cp. especially the derivation of 2.2 from B II, below, and the
remark (in the paragraph before the last, of section II) on the definition-like character of BII.
The solution mentioned makes it possible to construct Basic Definitions like those of ⟨Popper,
1947d⟩, but with Basis I as underlying basis. (⟨Popper, 1947d⟩uses Basis II for this purpose.) Such
Basic Definitions – cp. DB2I – may define conjunction, but any other compound serves just as well,
since Basis I, as opposed to Basis II, is neutral with regard to the various compounds. – It may be
remarked that we can by various methods reduce the number of Basic Definitions from three to
two, viz., to DB1 plus a Basic Definition which, apart from incorporating the definition of some
compound C and the rules of the basis chosen, also includes the six rules pertaining to substitution
(i.e. ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩, rules 5.71 to 5.76). If Basis I is chosen, C may be one of the quantifiers, which
would make this procedure more “natural”.

173
(The second of these definitions is incorporated in DB2I; cp. the end of the foregoing
section.)
The simplest form of Basis II known to me consists of the one primitive rule BII
(built in analogy to BI.2), together with the two definitions, DBI and DII∧.
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑎𝑛+1) . . . (𝑎𝑛+𝑟) 𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1) →𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎2).
(BII)
The difference between BII and BI.2 consists in writing “𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1)” instead
of “𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)”; and although this difference makes it possible to derive
BI.1 from BII, it makes it impossible to derive from BII the generalized transitivity
principle without at least assuming, in place of DI∧, the more complicated definition
(DII∧)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1) . . . (𝑎𝑛) 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
If this definition is incorporated, together with BII, into a Basic |
178
Definition, then
we obtain the following Basic Definition DB2II, which is equivalent to DB2I:
(DB2II)
𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔(𝑎1) . . . (𝑎𝑛+𝑟)
 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎↔(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏&
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐) &  𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐) & 𝑏/𝑏

.
(This is equivalent to DB2′, given in ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩).
I shall confine myself to showing that we can obtain, from BII, the rules 1.42′;
1.44′; 1.45′; and, besides, 2.46′, i.e.:
(2.46′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
which is, in Basis II, the transitivity principle that corresponds to the (stronger)
principle 1.46′ of Basis I.
The main interest of BII is that, by putting 𝑛= 2 and 𝑟= 1, we obtain
(2.1)
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) ↔(𝑐) 𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏)
which, without any further help, leads to
(2.2)
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑎);
for “𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎)” must be true, whatever the meaning of “𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2)” may be.
We obtain from BII immediately
(2.4)
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) → 𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, 𝑎1) →𝐷(𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎2).
We thus have, in the /-notation:
𝑎/𝑎
(2.2′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑐).
(2.4′)

174
Karl R. Popper
Putting here 𝑛= 1 and 𝑛+ 𝑟= 𝑚, we obtain:
𝑎𝑚, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑎1,
(2.2′; 2.4′)
(2.41)
and from this
(2.3′)
𝑎, 𝑎/𝑎.
We further obtain:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛+𝑟, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏;
(2.2′; 2.4′)
(2.43)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑏;
(2.43)
(2.44′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟/𝑏;
(2.43; 2.44′)
(2.45′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏→(𝑏/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐).
(2.4′; 2.44′)
(2.46′)
The principle
(2.42)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟/𝑎𝑛,
or
(2.42′)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛),
is obtained from 2.41 together with 2.45′.
Since 2.42′; 2.44′; 2.45′ are identical with the rules 1.42′; 1.44′; 1.45′, we have
derived all the rules we wanted.
|
179
We now proceed to show that
(2.5)
𝐷(𝑎) ↔(𝑏)𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏),
which establishes the equivalence of “𝐷(𝑎)” and “⊢𝑎”.
Putting in BII 𝑛= 1 and 𝑟= 2, we obtain
(2.51)
𝐷(𝑎) ↔(𝑏)(𝑐) 𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏),
and further
𝐷(𝑎) → 𝐷(𝑎, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏).
(by 2.51)
(2.52)
From this and 2.2 we obtain
(2.53)
𝐷(𝑎) →𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)
and thus
(2.54)
𝐷(𝑎) →(𝑏)𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏).
In order to obtain from 2.51 the converse of 2.54, we need only

5 On the Theory of Deduction, Part I
175
(2.55)
(𝑏)𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) →(𝑏)(𝑐) 𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏),
which is an immediate consequence of the transitivity principle in its simplest form,
i.e. of
(2.551)
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) → 𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎) →𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏).
This concludes the proof of 2.5. In order to show that 1.5, which is the same as 2.5,
can be derived from BI.1 and BI.2, we first consider that we can obtain 2.51 from
BI.2 in the same way as from BII. Since we have also 2.2, i.e., 1.2, we obtain 2.45;
and since we also have 2.55, which is obtainable from 1.47 by 𝑛= 1 and 𝑚= 1, we
obtain 2.5, i.e. 1.5.
Concerning BII, it may be remarked that, in view of the method of deriving 2.2,
it very closely resembles DB1 (cp. ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩). It might therefore, perhaps,
be described as a “quasi-definition”; for it defines, as it were, the 𝑛-termed relation
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) for 1 ≤𝑛, in terms of the two-termed relation 𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑎2) and the
𝑛+ 𝑟-termed relation 𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑟), for 1 ≤𝑟.
Concerning our two Basic Definitions DB2I and DB2II, it may be noted that they
can be made homogeneous (in the sense of ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩) simply by incorporating
BI.1 and BI.2, or BII, respectively, as they stand. In this case, a second set of
quantifiers appears within the right hand side of the definitions, which makes them
more complicated; but we achieve, besides homogeneity, the derivability of 1.5 and
2.5. If, on the other hand, we wish to avoid this set of quantifiers within the right hand
side, then 1.5 and 2.5 cannot be derived, and we have to revert to our earlier method
of defining “⊢𝑎”. But with this, the main advantage of the 𝐷-notation disappears.
(Thus it seems that there is not much point in formulating DB2I and DB2II in the
𝐷-notation.)
III
We can distinguish between the general and the special theories of derivation (and
proof). The special theories are the theories of the |
180
compounds, quantifiers, and
modalities; closely connected with them are the theories obtained by adding existential
postulates to our bases. (Such postulates may demand, for example, the existence of
provable or refutable statements, or perhaps the existence of a conditional statement 𝑐
to every pair of statements 𝑎and 𝑏, that is to say, of a weakest statement which, together
with 𝑎, yields 𝑏). The general theories are erected on either BI.1 and BI.2, or on BII,
without, however, introducing compound argument variables for 𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛), or
existential postulates. But such problems as the equivalence of existential postulates
fall within the scope of the general theory.
In the present section, we shall first sketch that part of the general theory which is
concerned with the complementarity or exhaustiveness (or disjunctness) and with the
contradictoriness or exclusiveness (or conjunctness) of 𝑛statements. We shall write

176
Karl R. Popper
⊢(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
for “the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, taken together, are complementary or exhaustive” and
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
for “the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, taken together, are contradictory or exclusive”. The
definitions are:
⊢(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑏)(𝑐) (𝑎1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑎𝑛/𝑐) →𝑏/𝑐.
(D3.1)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑏)(𝑐) (𝑏/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑏/𝑎𝑛) →𝑏/𝑐.
(D3.2)
An alternative and equivalent way of defining “ ” is this:
(D3.2′)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑏)(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏).
Introducing the convention that the brackets after “⊢” and “ ” may be omitted,
we obtain, for 𝑛= 1,
⊢𝑎↔(𝑏)(𝑏/𝑎);
(2.2′; 2.46′; D3.1)
(3.1)
𝑎↔(𝑏)(𝑎/𝑏).
(2.2′; 2.46′; D3.1)
(3.2)
This shows that, for 𝑛= 1, the two concepts coincide with demonstrability and
refutability respectively, as defined in my earlier papers; furthermore, that for 𝑛= 1,
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) and ⊢(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) coincide.
The two concepts may be generalized or relativized by introducing the following
definition. (We assume 0 ≤𝑛; 0 ≤𝑚; 1 ≤𝑛+ 𝑚.)
(D3.3)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ⊢(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚) ↔(𝑐)(𝑑)

(𝑏1/𝑑& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑑) →
 (𝑐/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑐/𝑎𝑛) →𝑐/𝑑
.
An alternative formulation can be obtained as before (cp. D3.2′):
(D3.3′)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ⊢(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚) ↔
(𝑐) (𝑏1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑚/𝑐) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.
We again introduce the convention that brackets can be omitted, before and after
“⊢”.
|
181
The concept defined by D3.3 may be called “relative demonstrability” (or “relative
refutability”), and “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚” may be read: “The statements 𝑏1, . . . ,
𝑏𝑚are complementary relative to the demonstrability (or self-complementarity)
of all the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.” For it is clear, from D3.3 and D3.3′, that every
one the the 𝑎𝑖which stand in front of “⊢” may be omitted if it is demonstrable
(or self-complementary), without affecting the force of the whole expression. This

5 On the Theory of Deduction, Part I
177
shows that for 𝑛= 0 relative demonstrability degenerates into complementarity (or
demonstrability) as defined by D3.1.
A similar consideration shows that every 𝑏𝑖which stands after “⊢” may be omitted
if it is refutable or self-contradictory. If all the 𝑏𝑖are so omitted, we obtain, for 𝑚= 0,
an expression which is equivalent to D3.2. That is to say, we obtain:
(3.3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢↔
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛.
Thus “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚” may be read, alternatively: “The statements
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are contradictory, relative to the refutability (or self-contradictoriness) of
all the statements 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.”
For certain purposes – especially if we wish to emphasize the duality or symmetry
between “⊢” and “ ” – the use of “(. . .) ⊢” turns out to be preferable to that of
“
(. . .)”.
It should be noted that, for 𝑚= 1, relative demonstrability degenerates, as it were,
into derivability; that is to say, we have
(3.4)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.
If, however, 𝑚> 1, then relative demonstrability means something else. (It is thus
a further generalisation of “/”.) Its meaning can be intuitively explained by remarking
that, whenever disjunction is available,
(3.5)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ∨𝑏2 ∨. . . ∨𝑏𝑚.
that is to say, the intuitive meaning (even if disjunction is not available) is the same
as that of the derivability of the disjunction of the statements standing to the right of
“⊢” from the statements standing to the left of “⊢”. Relative demonstrability is thus
about the same as Gentzen’s “Sequences” or Carnap’s “Involution”7.
|
182
Once we have adopted D3.3 or D3.3′, we obtain D3.1 and 3.1 as theorems, as
well as theorems corresponding to D3.2 and 3.2 (with “(. . .) ⊢” instead of “
(. . .)”);
and we can, if we wish, even dispense with the further use of “/”, in view of 3.5.
In the nextsection,we shallmake use of“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛⊢𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚” more especially
for 0 ≤𝑛≤2 and 0 ≤𝑚≤2. Implicit use will be made of the obvious theorems:
7 Cp. ⟨Gentzen, 1935a,b⟩; and ⟨Carnap, 1943⟩, esp. § 32, pp. 151ff. – My remark that relative
demonstrability is “about” the same as these earlier concepts alludes to the following differences.
(1) It is not quite clear whether Gentzen’s concept is, like ours, a metalinguistic predicate asserting
some kind of inference (it looks as if his horizontal stroke rather than his sequences were meant in
this way) or a name of an object-linguistic notation. (2) Carnap’s concept on the other hand (which is
not open to any objection of this kind) may be described as a generalization of “. . . ⊢. . .”, in so far
as classes of statements are admitted as arguments, besides statements. (3) Attention may be drawn,
furthermore, to the fact that Gentzen identifies the difference between classical and intuitionist logic
with the difference (I am using my own terminology) between permitting 𝑚to be greater than 1,
and taking 1 as the upper limit of 𝑚. This does not agree with our results, and seems to be due only
to Gentzen’s choice of his primitive rules for negation. We operate freely with 𝑚≥2, even within
intuitionist logic.

𝑎⊢𝑎, 𝑏
(3.61)
𝑏⊢𝑎, 𝑏
(3.62)
𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐→ 𝑐⊢𝑑→(𝑏⊢𝑑→𝑎⊢𝑑).
(3.63)
(In the expression in brackets, “⊢” may, of course, be here replaced by “/”.)
The rules ⟨3.61 to 3.63⟩show that we may characterize “𝑎∨𝑏” by a characterizing
rule which is precisely analogous to and dual of the simplest characterizing rule8 for
“𝑎∧𝑏”:
𝑎∧𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐
(3.71)
𝑎⊢𝑏∨𝑐↔𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐.
(3.72)
Similarly, we can characterize a new compound, called “anti-conditional” and
denoted by “𝑎≯𝑏”, in precise analogy to (and as the dual of) 𝑎> 𝑏:
𝑎⊢𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐
(3.81)
𝑎≯𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐.
(3.82)
“𝑎≯𝑏” is, intuitively (and in the presence of classical negation), a name for the
negation of 𝑎> 𝑏, or for the conjunction of 𝑎and the negation of 𝑏. But in the
absence of classical negation, its meaning is less familiar. (Cp. 5.32 and 5.42, and
note 15, below.)b
These characterizing rules can all be transformed into explicit definitions; for
example, 3.71 into DI∧(quoted at the beginning of section II).
All the rules and definitions given apply equally to closed and open statements.
But as long as we confine ourselves to closed statements, “. . . ⊢. . .” may, intuitively,
be interpreted as asserting that at least one of the statements on the right of “⊢” is
true, provided all statements on the left are true. It should be noted, on the other hand,
that two or more open statements – e.g. an open statement and its classical negation –
may be complementary (or relative complementary) in our sense even though their
𝐴-closures, i.e. the results of universal quantification, are not complementary (or
relative complementary). This is due to fact that 𝐴-closures and 𝐸-closures (i.e.
results of existential quantification), are duals of each other, like conjunction and
disjunction. For it follows from our definitions that every valid ⊢-formula remains
valid if any of its statements to the left of “⊢” are replaced by their 𝐴-closures,
and any of its statements to the |
183
right by their 𝐸-closures; and that, if there are no
8 Cp. ⟨New Foundations for Logic, p. 132, rule 4.1⟩; ⟨Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive
Rules of Inference, 5.2⟩– See also DI∧(in section II, above).
b In a letter to Alonzo Church (this volume, § 24.3) Popper suggested the insertion of the following:
Conjoint denial and alternative denial also are, in this System, dual to each other
𝑎↓𝑏⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐
(3.91)
𝑎⊢𝑏
𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐⊢
(3.92)

5 On the Theory of Deduction, Part I
179
open statements to the left or to the right respectively, the disjunction or conjunction
respectively of the remaining open statements may be replaced by either its 𝐴-closure
or its 𝐸-closure.
So far we have considered generalizations of the idea of derivability; but in
view of 3.4, which may be taken as a definition of derivability in terms of relative
demonstrability, and in view of D3.3, which defines the latter with the help of only
two-termed derivability (or inference from one premise), it is clearly possible to
use two-termed derivability, “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)”, characterized by (ordinary) reflexivity and
transitivity, as our sole undefined predicate. That is, we may introduce “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” by
the one rule 2.1, or, for example, by the following rule (constituting a “basis III”):
𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) ↔(𝑐) 𝐷(𝑏, 𝑐) →𝐷(𝑎, 𝑐).
(BIII)
The explicit definition of “𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)” in terms of “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” becomes, con-
sidering D3.3 and 3.4:
𝐷(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ↔(𝑏)
 𝐷(𝑎𝑛, 𝑏) & . . . & 𝐷(𝑎2, 𝑏) →𝐷(𝑎1, 𝑏)

.
(D3.4)
But this formula turns out to yield BIII. It therefore, surprisingly enough, suffices
(without BIII) for a Basis I.

We now turn to the discussion of negation – more especially, of the intuitionist
negation of Brouwer and Heyting, and its relation to other negations. In the present
section, we shall discuss the simplest characterizing rules for, and definitions of,
the intuitionist negation of 𝑎, denoted by “𝑎𝑖”; the classical negation of 𝑎, denoted

by9 “𝑎𝑘”; and a third negation of 𝑎, denoted by “𝑎𝑚” i.e., the “minimum definable
(non-modal) negation of 𝑎”, or the “weakest definable (non-modal) negation of 𝑎”.
The definitions and characterizing rules of 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑘given in my earlier papers
are adequate, but a little complicated and intuitively not as obvious as, for example,
3.71 to 3.82. A characterizing rule for 𝑎𝑖which in its simplicity is comparable to 3.71
etc. is this10:
(4.1)
𝑎⊢𝑏𝑖↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢.
This may be put into the words: “The intuitionist negation of 𝑏is the weakest of those
statements which are strong enough to contradict 𝑏.” The corresponding explicit
definition is:
(D4.1)
𝑎//𝑏𝑖↔(𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑎↔𝑐, 𝑏⊢).
Thus intuitionist negation is, as it were, characterized by contradictoriness alone.
One might be tempted to think that classical negation is similarly related to comple-
mentarity; but this is not the case. The dual of 4.1 leads to a new kind of negation
which is weaker than classical negation. We call this negation “𝑎𝑚” (the “minimum
definable negation of 𝑎”; its characterizing rule may be written:
(4.2)
𝑎𝑚⊢𝑏↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏;
|
323
that is to say 𝑎𝑚can be characterized as the strongest of those statements which are
weak enough to be complements of 𝑎. We can11 transform (4.2) into the corresponding
9 In ⟨New Foundations for Logic, footnote 20⟩, I have used instead of “𝑎𝑖” and “𝑎𝑘” two more
complicated symbols. In ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩, sections III ff., I have used the symbols “𝑎𝑖” and “𝑎𝑐”. I
have now replaced “𝑎𝑐” by “𝑎𝑘” because I found that the “𝑐” in “𝑎𝑐” was misleading, occurring as
it does together with the statement-variable “𝑐”.
10 Rule 4.1 and all other rules in this section are purely derivational (in the sense of ⟨New Foundations
for Logic, p. 145⟩), i.e. they can all be non-vacuously satisfied by non-logical (or factual) statements.
Were we to write “𝑎∧𝑏⊢” instead of “𝑎, 𝑏⊢”, or “⊢𝑎∨𝑏” instead of “⊢𝑎, 𝑏”, our rules would
no longer be purely derivational, since these rules would need logical (demonstrable or refutable)
statements to satisfy them. The reason why my earlier definitions are more complicated then the
present ones is that I did not then use “⊢” and “ ” with more than one argument; this makes it
impossible to obtain rules as simple as our present ones if we wish to remain within derivation logic,
which I consider highly desirable for non-modal logic. (The definitions of the modalities, of course,
cannot be purely derivational; cp. ⟨Logic without Assumptions, p. 104⟩, end of note 20.)
11 The method here used to obtain relatively simple formulae incorporating the condition “the
weakest (or strongest) statement such that . . .” is capable of fairly wide application. This may be
illustrated by the example of the definition of identity. We use “Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)” as the metalinguistic
name of a statement-function expressing identity between individuals represented by the individual
variables 𝑥and 𝑦. (Note that, in this characterization, “𝑥” and “𝑦” must not be put into quotes.) We
introduce the abbreviating notation:
𝑎//𝑎`𝑥`𝑦↔(𝑤) (𝑎//𝑎  𝑥
𝑤
 & 𝑎//𝑎  𝑦
𝑤
)
We can define Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) as the weakest statement strong enough to imply what ⟨Hilbert and Bernays,
1934, p. 65⟩call the “second identity axiom”, as follows (cp. ⟨New Foundations for Logic, p. 143⟩,
D6.2):

definition
(D4.2)
𝑎//𝑏𝑚↔(𝑐)(𝑎⊢𝑐↔⊢𝑏, 𝑐).
There exist two simple rules for classical negation (see 4.311, f., below) which
are analogous to 4.1 and 4.2, but less striking. The simplest and most striking
characterization I have been able to find is the following explicit definition12
(D4.3)
𝑎//𝑏𝑘↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢& ⊢𝑎, 𝑏.
That is to say, the classical negation of 𝑏can be defined (as Aristotle might have
defined it) as that statement which is at once contradictory and complementary to 𝑏.
Classical negation, according to this definition, will exist in a language 𝐿if,
and only if, there exists in 𝐿to every statement 𝑎a statement 𝑎𝑘which is both
contradictory and complementary to 𝑎. It is fairly clear, from this definition, that
intuitionist negation 𝑎𝑖or its dual 𝑎𝑚, or perhaps both, may exist in a language in
which classical negation does not exist; and we shall prove all this by an example (in
section V).
Some characterizing rules for classical negation, if written in terms of relative
demonstrability, are only slightly different from 4.1 and 4.2, and may be described as
generalizations of these rules; 4.31 is equivalent to D4.3, and so is 4.32, which is the
dual rule of 4.31:
𝑎⊢𝑏𝑘, 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐.
(4.31)
𝑎, 𝑏𝑘⊢𝑐↔𝑎⊢𝑏, 𝑐.
(4.32)
|
324
The close relationship to 4.1 and 4.2 respectively, is clear, but the rules are
intuitively less satisfactory than D4.3 – especially in view of the fact that D4.3 is an
explicit definition. Two other characterizing rules, each of them equivalent to D4.3,
may be obtained by inverting 4.1 and 4.2:
𝑎, 𝑏𝑘⊢↔𝑎⊢𝑏.
(4.311)
⊢𝑎𝑘, 𝑏↔𝑎⊢𝑏.
(4.312)
The first of these may be expressed in words: “The classical negation of 𝑏is a
statement that contradicts every statement 𝑎which is at least as strong as 𝑏”. This is
𝑎//Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔
(𝑏) (𝑧) ((𝑏//𝑏`𝑥`𝑦→𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
) & (((𝑐) (𝑢) (𝑐//𝑐`𝑥`𝑦→𝑏, 𝑐 𝑢
𝑥
/𝑐 𝑢
𝑦
)) →𝑏/𝑎)).
Adopting the method used in 4.1 of formalizing “the weakest statement such that”, this may be
replaced by the rule (or the corresponding definition).
𝑎/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ↔(𝑏) (𝑧) (𝑏//𝑏`𝑥`𝑦→𝑎, 𝑏 𝑧
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑧
𝑦
).
12 The presence of 3.71 or of 3.72 is assumed. For the derivational character of D4.2 see note 10
above. An identical definition is given in ⟨Logic without Assumptions, p. 105⟩, rule 7.7.

184
Karl R. Popper
similar to 4.1, but, surely, more involved and less striking. 4.312 may be read: “The
classical negation of 𝑎is a statement which is complementary to every statement 𝑏
which is at most as strong as 𝑎.”
Each of the rules and definitions 4.1; D4.1; D4.3 (in the presence of conjunction
or disjunction; 4.31 to 4.312; can be shown to be equivalent to the corresponding
definitions given in my earlier papers.
V
In the presence of classical negation, that is to say, of characterizing rules for, or of a
definition of, classical negation, it is possible to prove
𝑎𝑖//𝑎𝑘
(5.11)
𝑎𝑚//𝑎𝑘
(5.12)
and therefore also
(5.13)
𝑎𝑖//𝑎𝑚
This follows simply from the fact that the characterizing rules for 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚allow
us to prove equivalence for every statement which satisfies these rules. (This is,
precisely, the point which makes what may be called a “fully characterizing rule”
equivalent to a definition.) But 𝑎𝑘satisfies the characterizing rules for 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚.
Thus we obtain 5.11 to 5.13.
This result may be generalized. Whenever we have two logical functions of
statements (or two formative signs) 𝑆1 and 𝑆2, which have been introduced by way of
two sets of primitive rules, 𝑅1 and 𝑅2, such that 𝑅2 is obtained by the omission of
some rules of 𝑅1, then we can prove in the presence of 𝑆1, the equivalence of (the full
expressions of) 𝑆1 and 𝑆2 whenever both are definable. For example, if we introduce
“𝑎> 𝑏” by rule 3.71 and another function, say “𝑎⊃𝑏”, by the two13 rules (of which
the first is like 3.71)
𝑎⊢𝑏⊃𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐;
(5.21)
𝑎, 𝑏⊃𝑐⊢𝑏↔𝑎⊢𝑏;
(5.22)
|
325
then, since 3.71 or 5.21 can be transformed into a definition, we can prove
(5.23)
𝑎> 𝑏//𝑎⊃𝑏,
in spite of the fact that 5.22 is independent of 5.21, that is to say, that its addition
changes the meaning of the sign “⊃”.
13 The second of these two rules is discussed in section VII below (rule 7.3𝑘); for another discussion
of the same rule see ⟨New Foundations for Logic, p. 133⟩, (rule 4.2e).

6 On the Theory of Deduction, Part II
185
The problem arises whether, in the presence of both 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚in a language
𝐿1, 𝑎𝑘is always present, so that 5.13 holds, or whether 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚can coexist in 𝐿1
without becoming equivalent.
We shall prove that the second alternative holds, by constructing, as an example, a
language 𝐿1 in which 𝑎𝑖is equivalent to I 𝑎, i.e. to the modal statement which asserts
that the state of affairs described by 𝑎is impossible14, and in which 𝑎𝑚is equivalent
to U 𝑎, i.e. to the modal statement asserting that the state of affairs described by 𝑎is
uncertain (not necessary).
We have, of course, to choose a language 𝐿1 in which at least one non-logical
statement exists, since we have otherwise I 𝑎//U 𝑎, which would lead to 𝑎𝑖//𝑎𝑚,
i.e. to the case we wish to avoid. We shall construct a language 𝐿1 which contains
one factual statement 𝑠, together with all the compounds which may be constructed
from it with the help of the four functions characterized by 3.71 to 3.82 and of the
definitions for 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑚, I 𝑎and U 𝑎. (𝑎𝑘, of course, does not occur.) We shall have in
𝐿1 (1) demonstrable statements such as 𝑠> 𝑠; 𝑠∨U 𝑠; (2) factual statements such as
𝑠; 𝑠∧U 𝑠; 𝑠∨I 𝑠, and (3) refutable statements such as 𝑠∧I 𝑠; 𝑠≯𝑠.

326
In order to show that 𝑎𝑖may be here without contradiction identified with I 𝑎, and
𝑎𝑚with U 𝑎, we construct a mathematical model of our metalanguage, interpreting
our variables “𝑎”, “𝑏”, etc., as variables whose values are the three numbers 1, 2,
and 3, and “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” as the statement asserting that the greatest of the numbers
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is at least equal to 𝑏.
On the basis of our characterizing rules for I 𝑎; U 𝑎; 𝑎∧𝑏; 𝑎∨𝑏; 𝑎> 𝑏, and 𝑎≯𝑏,
this interpretation forces us to accept the following: “𝑎∧𝑏” is to be interpreted as the
greater of the two numbers 𝑎and 𝑏; “𝑎∨𝑏” as the smaller of them; etc. We obtain
the matrices (also useful for showing that D4.3 is independent of 4.1, etc.):

In order to show that in 𝐿1, 𝑎𝑖//I 𝑎and 𝑎𝑚//U 𝑎, we can use the generally valid
dual rules:
𝑎𝑖//𝑎> I 𝑎
(5.31)
𝑎𝑚//U 𝑎≯𝑎
(5.32)
or alternatively15
14 I 𝑎, U 𝑎, and the other modal functions are defined in ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩, section VIII. A simpler
definition (taken from ⟨Logic without Assumptions, footnote 20⟩) of I 𝑎is given in section VII
below, D7.I. The dual of this definition is:
𝑎//U 𝑎↔(𝑐) ((𝑐/𝑎Ô 𝑐/𝑏) & (𝑎/𝑏→𝑎/𝑐)).
15 It is remarkable that both 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚can be defined in terms of “>” and its dual “≯”, while 𝑎𝑘

186
Karl R. Popper
𝑎𝑖//𝑎> (𝑎≯𝑎)
(5.41)
𝑎𝑚//(𝑎> 𝑎) ≯𝑎.
(5.42)
Evaluating with the help of our numerical tables either 5.31 and 5.32 or 5.41 and
5.42, the equivalences 𝑎𝑖//I 𝑎and 𝑎𝑚//U 𝑎can easily be shown to be valid in 𝐿1.
This result is not in general true, but the fact that it holds for 𝐿1 establishes that,
without risking a contradiction, we may postulate 𝑎𝑖//I 𝑎, provided that classical
negation does not exist in the language under consideration. This justifies the well
known intuitionistic identification of 𝑎𝑖with “𝑎is impossible”.
Our result is by no means trivial since from our definition of 𝑎𝑖(which is equivalent
with the implicit characterization of Heyting’s calculus) we obtain
(5.5)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎𝑖→𝑏/𝑎𝑖
while we cannot obtain the corresponding formula for I 𝑎from its definition; if we
could, the equivalence of I 𝑎and 𝑎𝑘could be established in the presence of 𝑎𝑘, which
is obviously not possible, in view of our definitions of I 𝑎and 𝑎𝑘. The place of 5.5 is
taken by the weaker rules
𝑎, 𝑏/I 𝑎→𝑏/𝑎𝑖.
(5.51)
𝑎/I 𝑎→𝑏/I 𝑎.
(5.52)
The fact that a rule which is like 5.5 but with “I 𝑎” instead of “𝑎𝑖” cannot be shown
to follow from our definition of I 𝑎might be considered, at first sight, as speaking
against the intuitionistic identification of 𝑎𝑖with I 𝑎. But the problem is whether 𝑎𝑖is
equivalent to I 𝑎in the absence of 𝑎𝑘. That this is the problem may be seen from
the fact that intuitionism admits that the law of the excluded middle holds in a wide
range of cases, which means, in our way of speaking, that for certain statements 𝑎it
may happen that 𝑎𝑖is complementary to 𝑎and thus coincident with 𝑎𝑘.
|
327
A complete formal justification of the intuitionist identification of 𝑎𝑖with the
impossibility of 𝑎could be obtained by proving the following very general
Conjecture: If a language 𝐿does not contain the classical negation of every of its
statements but does contain 𝑎𝑖and I 𝑎for every statement 𝑎, then the following holds:
if, for some 𝑏, the does not exist 𝑏𝑘, then I 𝑏is the weakest statement contradictory
to 𝑏, so that 𝑏𝑖is equivalent to I 𝑏.
I have so far not been able to prove or disprove this conjecture. (The problem is
cannot be so defined (as proved by our example 𝐿1). We see that every language containing “>” and
“≯” necessarily contains 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚(possibly undistinguishable from 𝑎𝑘) while it need not contain
𝑎𝑘. – It may be mentioned that the theory of the anti-conditional “≯” is quite interesting. We have,
for example, the dual of 7.40 (see section VII, below), i.e.:
𝑎⊢𝑏≯𝑐, 𝑑↔(𝑒) (𝑏⊢𝑒, 𝑐→𝑎⊢𝑒, 𝑑).
We also obtain, with the modus ponens, its dual:
𝑎, 𝑎> 𝑏⊢𝑏
𝑎⊢𝑎≯𝑏, 𝑏

6 On the Theory of Deduction, Part II
187
a straightforward calculation in our metalinguistic calculus, and most probably not
difficult to solve; cp. its formal presentation at the end of section VII.) Meanwhile,
our example of a language 𝐿1 for which this conjecture holds establishes that, for
a language which does not contain classical negation, we may postulate that 𝑎𝑖is
identical with I 𝑎, without fear of contradiction.
It should be noted that 5.5 is the only one of the more important rules which 𝑎𝑖
and I 𝑎do not share. Among the more important rules which can be derived from the
definition of I 𝑎and which hold for 𝑎𝑖as well are:
𝑎, I 𝑎⊢
(5.6)
𝑎⊢I 𝑎→⊢I 𝑎
(5.7)
I 𝑎⊢𝑎→⊢I I 𝑎
(5.71)
𝑎⊢I I 𝑎
(5.8)
𝑎⊢I 𝑏→𝑏⊢I 𝑎
(5.9)
Equally important is that the following classical principles (which also hold for
𝑎𝑚and U 𝑎) cannot be shown to hold generally of either 𝑎𝑖or I 𝑎:a
⊢𝑎, 𝑎𝑚
(5.6′)
𝑎𝑚⊢𝑎→⊢𝑎
(5.7′)
𝑎𝑚𝑚⊢𝑎
(5.8′)
𝑎𝑚⊢𝑏→𝑏𝑚⊢𝑎.
(5.9′)
VI
We shall now extend our considerations to other kinds of negation, even to fairly
remote and unusual ones. Neglecting (1) I 𝑎and U 𝑎, which were considered in the last
section, we shall now consider (2) 𝑎𝑘; (3) 𝑎𝑖; (4) 𝑎𝑚; (5) f 𝑎, i.e. the self-contradictory
compound of 𝑎(for which f 𝑎//f 𝑏holds) definable, for example, by
𝑎//f 𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑎/𝑏↔𝑎/𝑐);
and ultimately (6) three negations, 𝑎𝑗; 𝑎𝑙; and 𝑎𝑛, each of which is to be considered
as introduced with the help of one of the following three primitive rules, respectively:
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐𝑗→𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏𝑗
(6.1)
𝑎, 𝑏𝑙/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑐𝑙/𝑏
(6.2)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑐𝑛/𝑏𝑛
(6.3)
|
328
(These three rules will be shown not to be equivalent to definitions, that is to say, they
are not fully characterizing rules in our sense.) 6.1 is equivalent to the axioms which
a In 5.7′ and 5.8′ we have replaced occurrences of “
⊢
” by “⊢”.

188
Karl R. Popper
introduce the negation 𝑎𝑗of Johansson’s so-called “Minimalkalkül”. In view of 6.2
we may call 𝑎𝑙the “left-hand side negation of 𝑎” (in contradistinction to Johansson’s
𝑎𝑗which, in view of 6.1, is a “right hand side negation”). 𝑎𝑛may be called the
“neutral negation”; it is neutral with respect to right-sidedness and left-sidedness, as
is 𝑎𝑘which, indeed, can be fully characterized by the converse of 6.3, viz. by:
(6.4)
𝑎, 𝑏𝑘/𝑐𝑘→𝑎, 𝑐/𝑏
The following diagramme indicates the way in which the rules of the six negation
𝑎𝑘, 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑚, 𝑎𝑗, 𝑎𝑙, and 𝑎𝑛are satisfied.
𝑎𝑘
𝑎𝑛
𝑎𝑗
𝑎𝑙
𝑎𝑖
𝑎𝑚
The arrows indicate, for example, that 𝑎𝑘satisfies the rules holding of all the others,
or that 𝑎𝑖satisfies the rules holding of 𝑎𝑗and 𝑎𝑛, and that the latter ones are satisfied
by all others (except 𝑎𝑚which is so weak16 that it does not satisfy even 6.3).
We shall now show that the three negations listed under (6) cannot be defined.
In order to show this for 𝑎𝑗, we introduce the following auxiliary definition of
“t𝑏”:
𝑎//t𝑏↔(𝑐)(𝑏/𝑎↔𝑐/𝑎)
“t𝑏” may be called the “self-complementary compound of 𝑏”. We obtain t𝑎/t𝑏.
It can now be shown that t𝑏satisfies 6.1. On the other hand, 𝑎𝑘also satisfies 6.1.
Thus, if 𝑎𝑗were definable, we would obtain t𝑎//𝑎𝑗and 𝑎𝑘//𝑎𝑗and therefore t𝑎//𝑎𝑘.
But this is possible in contradictory languages only; since we have (𝑎> 𝑎)𝑘⊢and
⊢t(𝑎> 𝑎), it is clear that t𝑎//𝑎𝑘would lead to 𝑎//𝑏. Thus there cannot be a definition
equivalent to 6.1, and 𝑎𝑗cannot be defined17.
Similarly, 6.2 is satisfied by f 𝑎and 𝑎𝑘; thus 𝑎𝑙cannot be defined.
|
329
6.3 is satisfied by t𝑎, f 𝑎and 𝑎𝑘; thus 𝑎𝑛cannot be defined.
The fact that Johansson’s negation 𝑎𝑗cannot be formally distinguished from t𝑎
(which is not, by any stretch of imagination, to be called a negation) speaks strongly
against its adoption. 𝑎𝑙seems slightly preferable since f 𝑎has something in common
with I 𝑎; for f 𝑎is equivalent to I 𝑎whenever 𝑎is either factual or demonstrable. 𝑎𝑛
is, perhaps, the best of the three negations under (6).
16 There are, of course, dual rules of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, two of which are satisfied by 𝑎𝑚, just as 6.1
and 6.3 are satisfied by 𝑎𝑖. Note that our diagramme does not contain the duals of 𝑎𝑗, 𝑎𝑙, and 𝑎𝑘,
and that it is therefore not fully symmetrical.
17 For Johansson’s calculus,see ⟨Hilbert and Bernays,1939,p. 449f⟩. The fact that his negation cannot
be defined, and that this impossibility can be proved, is mentioned in ⟨Logic without Assumptions,
p. 107⟩.

6 On the Theory of Deduction, Part II
189
But the fact that none of the three is definable speaks very strongly against all of
them; indeed, I suggested in ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩that the term “formative sign” should
be applied only to signs whose meaning is definable by definitions in terms of
deducibility. Should this suggestion be accepted, then we would have to say that those
signs of a language 𝐿which represent Johansson’s negation, or the others under (6),
are not formative.
On the other hand, the very fact that these three signs cannot be defined makes it
possible to combine them in the same language 𝐿with classical negation without
running the risk of destroying their distinguishableness; which is not possible for the
signs under (3) and (4).
VII
We now turn to some concluding remarks about the existential assumptions connected
with intuitionist and classical negation. They will provide, at the same time, examples
of the kind of existential problems which are far from trivial and which arise, and can
in principle be solved, within the general theory of derivation.
It is well known that intuitionism does not assert that there does not exist a classical
negation of any statement, on the contrary, Brouwer has not only asserted that the
law of excluded middle is valid for certain entities, but has given a proof18 of its
validity for a certain range of entities. This means, from our point of view, that there
exist some statements 𝑎to which statements 𝑏exist which are both contradictory
and complementary to 𝑎. Where intuitionism deviates from classical logic is in its
assertion that such statements 𝑏do not exist to every statement 𝑎.
In other words, intuitionism asserts, for the language which it considers (the
language in which mathematicians deal with infinite sets):
(7.1𝑖)
(𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝑐)(𝑐⊢𝑏↔𝑎, 𝑐⊢).
The corresponding assertion or postulate of classical logic is
(7.1𝑘)
(𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝑐)((𝑐⊢𝑏↔𝑎, 𝑐⊢) & (⊢𝑎, 𝑐↔𝑏⊢𝑐)).
which, of course, implies 7.1𝑖.
Now intuitionism does not only assert 7.1𝑖, but it denies 7.1𝑘; that is to say, it
asserts besides 7.1𝑖the following principle which is a negation (an intuitionist one)
of 7.1𝑘:
(7.2𝑖) (𝐸𝑎)(𝑏)(𝐸𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑒)(((𝑐⊢𝑏↔𝑎, 𝑐⊢) & (⊢𝑎, 𝑐↔𝑏⊢𝑐)) →𝑑⊢𝑒).
|
330
In other words, the fundamental assertion of intuitionism – the one by which it is
distinguished from classical logic – is an existential assertion; it asserts the existence
18 Cp. ⟨Brouwer, 1928⟩.

190
Karl R. Popper
of a statement 𝑎for which the application of the classical principle 7.1𝑘leads to a
contradiction. (This is the force of the clause “𝑑⊢𝑒” which allows us to deduce a
contradiction from a tautology.)
Intuitionism does not consider an existential assertion such as 7.2𝑖as legitimate
if it cannot be supported by an actual construction of an example; it is therefore
a crucial task for intuitionism to give an example of a statement which, if treated
classically, leads to a contradiction. In other words, the proof19 of the contradictoriness
of classical mathematics must be of crucial importance for intuitionism. It is ⟨in⟩
agreement with this result that Brouwer considers the proof of the contradictoriness of
classical mathematics as one of the most central problems of intuitionist mathematics.
We now proceed to state some principles equivalent to 7.2𝑖.
One such principle is obtained by asserting the existence of an intuitionist negation
which is not classical. This may be written, considering 7.1𝑖and 7.1𝑘:
(7.21𝑖) (𝐸𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑒)((𝑐⊢𝑏↔𝑐, 𝑎⊢) & ((𝑏⊢𝑐↔𝑐⊢𝑎) →𝑑⊢𝑒))
In the presence of 7.1𝑖, 7.21𝑖is equivalent to 7.2𝑖.
A less obvious equivalence can be obtained if we remember20 that, in in the
presence of intuitionist negation and the conditional, classical negation can be derived
from the following principle 7.3𝑘(cp. also 5.22):
(7.3𝑘)
𝑎, 𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏→𝑎/𝑏
In this form, the existential character of 7.3𝑘is not very obvious, but it becomes
obvious if we eliminate here the sign “>”, with the help of
(7.40)
𝑎, 𝑏> 𝑐/𝑑↔(𝑒)(𝑏, 𝑒/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑒/𝑑)
which an alternative characterizing rule21 for “>”, obtainable from 3.81 (or from the
definition of “𝑏> 𝑐”). Applying 7.40, we can transform 7.3𝑘into 7.4𝑘:
(7.4𝑘)
(𝑎)(𝑏)(𝑐)(𝐸𝑑)((𝑏, 𝑑/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑑/𝑏) →𝑎/𝑏)
which shows its existential character. Negating 7.4𝑘, we obtain a principle 7.4𝑖which
(in the presence of 7.1𝑖and of a formula asserting the existence of the conditional) is
equivalent to 7.2𝑖:
(7.4𝑖)
(𝐸𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝐸𝑐)(𝑑)(𝑒)( 𝑓)(((𝑏, 𝑑/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑑/𝑏) →𝑎/𝑏) →𝑒/ 𝑓).
In this case, the equivalence is by no means obvious, but demands a fairly complicated
proof, based, of course, upon BI.1 and BI.2. It shows that the consequences derivable
from this basis are not all trivial.
19 This proof must, of course, be intuitionistically valid; and therefore, a fortiori, classically valid
also.

I may refer
to the conjecture, formulated in section V, that 𝑎𝑖//I 𝑎whenever 𝑎𝑖and I 𝑎exist
but not 𝑎𝑘. This conjecture can be proved or disproved by proving or disproving a
metalinguistic conditional with the conjunction of the closures of BI.1, BI.2 and the
definition of “⊢𝑎, 𝑏” and “𝑎, 𝑏⊢” as antecedent and a consequent which asserts: “If
𝑎is (not equivalent to 𝑏𝑚and therefore) not the classical negation of 𝑏, then, if 𝑎is
the intuitionist negation of 𝑏, then 𝑎//I 𝑏.” In order to formalize this assertion, we
shall make use of the following comparatively simple definition22 of I 𝑏:
(D7.1)
𝑎//I 𝑏↔(𝑐)((𝑎/𝑐Ô 𝑏/𝑐) & (𝑏/𝑎→𝑐/𝑎)).
With the help of this, we can write the assertion in question as follows
(𝑎)(𝑏)(𝑐)(𝑑)(𝐸𝑒)(𝐸𝑓)(𝐸𝑔)(((𝑎/𝑑↔⊢𝑏, 𝑑) →𝑒/ 𝑓) →((𝑔/𝑎↔𝑏, 𝑔⊢)
→((𝑎/𝑐Ô 𝑏/𝑐) & (𝑏/𝑎→𝑐/𝑎))).
If the metalinguistic conditional here described is refutable, and a counter example
can be constructed,23 i.e., a language for which it is not valid, then the problem arises
of formulating the necessary and sufficient conditions under which it holds; for that it
holds for some languages has been established by our example in section V.

More than two decades ago, the method of truth tables or matrices seemed to offer
some prospect of trivializing mathematical logic, as represented, say, by Principia
Mathematica. Two hopes were raised.
One was that it may be possible to show that the system of mathematical logic
rests entirely upon the definitions of the formative linguistic signs involved. Since
the truth tables or matrices may be taken as definitions of these signs, it was hoped
that the truth of all the propositions of the system could be shown to rest upon these
definitions.
Another of the hopes raised was that the whole system could be shown to be
decidable or computable by methods analogous to evaluations with the help of truth
tables.
It is known that both these hopes failed. The second hope, more especially, was
shattered in consequence of Gödel’s discoveries and finally given up in view of proofs
by Church and Turing. No attempt to revive it will be made in this paper.
But the first hope also failed. The difficulty was that only a narrow part of logic

could be tackled by the matrix method. Even quantification theory proved to go
beyond it. But apart from the quantifiers, other formative signs – or at least, other
signs which most logicians considered as formative – appeared to be hopelessly out
of reach of the truth table or matrix methods; especially the signs of identity.
But other and perhaps more radical doubts appeared. The truth table method itself
threatened the very security it first appeared to produce. It gave rise to the so-called
many valued systems, and to doubts whether the definitions obtainable in the two
valued system were the only adequate ones, or even whether they were at all adequate.
Still more radical, from the point of view here taken, were the doubts entertained
by those who gave up the truth table method altogether – for various reasons, among
which two may be mentioned here.
(a)
The truth table of the conditional (I shall avoid throughout the term “implication”)
was intuitively unconvincing. This led to several alternative systems, such as
that of Lewis, or Heyting’s intuitionistically valid rules for the conditional.
(b) Classical negation and its truth table were, by intuitionists, considered unsatisfac-
tory, in consequence of Brouwer’s discussion of the law of the excluded middle.
This led especially to the systems of Heyting, Kolmogoroff, and Johansson.
In view of this situation, it is no longer possible to accept the method of |
723
truth
tables ⟨or⟩matrices as the fundamental method of mathematical logic. But I do not
think that there is any need to give up the hope for a trivialization of mathematical
logic in the sense that the whole of it becomes obtainable from definitions of the
formative signs.
(2)
As the sole definiens of our definitions, the idea of deducibility or derivability will be
used. We can restrict ourselves to using deducibility from one premise. We write
“𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)”
for “𝑎is deducible from 𝑏”. The letters “𝑎” and “𝑏”, etc., are used as variables whose
values are statements (i.e., “𝑎” and “𝑏” are variables that may be supplanted by names
of statements, but not by statements themselves). Deducibility is thus first introduced
as a two-termed (metalinguistic) predicate. We do not need, for the derivation of
mathematical logic, to assume more about deducibility than that it is transitive and
reflexive. But for the purpose of intuitive grasp as well as for the purpose of comparing
our definitions with the truth table definitions, we shall remember that the assertion
“the statement 𝑎follows from the statement 𝑏” will be true if, and only if, no counter
example exists, i.e., no example of statements (of the same logical form) such that the
conclusion 𝑎is false while the premise 𝑏is true.
With the help of “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” it is easy to define deducibility from 𝑛premises. We
write
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏”

7 The Trivialization of Mathematical Logic
195
in order to express that 𝑏is deducible from the 𝑛premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. It is,
furthermore, easy to define a generalization of this. We write
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚”
in order to express ⟨that, if the 𝑛premises⟩𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are all true, at least one
of the statements 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚must be true too. The definition must be so framed
that “𝑎/𝑏” means the same as “𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎)”; and it can be so framed that, for 𝑚= 0,
we obtain a formula “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/” which means that the statements 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are
contradictory to each other, i.e., that they cannot all be true; and that, accordingly,
“𝑎/” means that 𝑎is self-contradictory, or logically refutable. And we obtain, for
𝑛= 0, a formula “/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚” which means that the statements 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚are
complementary to each other, i.e., that they cannot all be false; and that, accordingly,
“/𝑏” means that 𝑏is self-complementary or tautologous, or logically demonstrable.
We also define
“𝑎//𝑏”
in such a way that it expresses the idea that “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” and “𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎)” both hold i.e.,
that 𝑎and 𝑏are mutually deducible.
All this can be easily achieved by using “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” as our only undefined term,
characterized only by transitivity and reflexivity.
|
724
We can now say, of two statements 𝑎and 𝑏, that 𝑎is weaker than 𝑏(we use the
term “weaker”, in order to express more precisely, that 𝑎is weaker or at most as
strong as 𝑏) if and only if 𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏), i.e., if 𝑎follows from 𝑏. And we can say, under
the same circumstances, that 𝑏is stronger than 𝑎(that is, more precisely, at least as
strong as 𝑎).
It is now easy to define those compounds for whose definitions truth tables can be
used, and also the other formative signs which cannot be defined by truth tables. I
shall not give all definitions but I shall confine myself to the most interesting cases.
The conjunction of the statements 𝑎and 𝑏can be defined in various ways, for
example (a) as the weakest of the statements from which 𝑎as well as 𝑏can be derived,
or (b) as the strongest of the statements derivable from every statement from which 𝑎
as well as 𝑏can be derived; etc.
Using our “/”-notation, we can put this as follows. (We use “𝑎∧𝑏” as a name for
the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏.)
(2.1)
“𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐” means the same as “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐”.
This is surely trivial, but it suffices.
The conditional of 𝑏and 𝑐(we use “𝑏> 𝑐” as its name) can be similarly defined
as the weakest statement strong enough to satisfy the modus ponens. This, again, is
trivial. It can be said without exaggeration that everybody who has used the words
“if . . . then” has used them in such a way that, given the if-then-statement and the
antecedent, the consequent is assumed to follow. We can write the modus ponens:
(2.02)
“𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐”

196
Karl R. Popper
To define the conditional “𝑏> 𝑐” as the weakest statement that satisfies the modus
ponens means to say that every statement 𝑎which is stronger than the ⟨conditional
𝑏> 𝑐⟩, that is, for which “𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐” holds, – and only such a statement – is strong
enough to replace 𝑏> 𝑐in 2.02. But this amounts to saying that our definition can be
expressed by
(2.2)
“𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐” means the same as “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐”.
It is clear that every adequate definition of 𝑏> 𝑐must demand that it satisfies the
modus ponens; and it is also clear that every statement 𝑎which is stronger than 𝑏> 𝑐
must satisfy it. Thus our definition is, again, trivial. What is remarkable is only that it
suffices for all our purposes.
We proceed to negation. Here we have the choice of various possibilities. The
intuitionist negation (of Heyting’s calculus) can be completely characterized as
follows: 𝑏𝑖, the intuitionist negation of 𝑏, is the weakest statement strong enough to
contradict 𝑏; i.e.,
(2.3𝑖)
“𝑎/𝑏𝑖” means the same as “𝑎, 𝑏/”.
There is a dual of intuitionist negation which I shall not discuss. The classical
negation of 𝑏, denoted by “𝑏𝑘”, can be characterized as the statement |
725
which is both
contradictory and complementary to 𝑏. Using “𝑎//𝑏” we can write
(2.3𝑘)
“𝑎//𝑏𝑘” means the same as “𝑎, 𝑏/ and /𝑎, 𝑏”.
It is possible to show that our definitions of the conjunction and of classical
negation are (if we make use of the intuitive meaning of “𝑎/𝑏”⟨)⟩equivalent to
the classical two-valued truth tables for these compounds. But our definition of the
conditional (and, obviously, that of intuitionist negation) is not equivalent ⟨to⟩any
definition by means of truth tables. All we can obtain, in this respect, from our
definition of the conditional is that, if the antecedent is true and the consequent false,
the conditional must be false too, and – in view of the fact that we obtain the formula
“𝑐/𝑏> 𝑐” – that if the consequent is true, the conditional must be true too.
This is in so far quite satisfactory as it agrees well with our intuitive use of “if . . .
then . . .” – in any case better than the classical truth tables. But how is it that our
definition 2.2 suffices for our purposes, including classical logic, even though it is so
much weaker than the classical truth table?
The answer is that the classical truth table for the conditional can be obtained,
although not from our definition of the conditional alone, but from it together with our
definition for classical negation. A fairly remote consequence of these two definitions
is that 2.2, in the presence of 2.3𝑘, is equivalent to
(2.2𝑘)
“𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑑” means the same as “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑”
and that this formula can indeed be shown to yield the classical truth table for the
conditional. For it yields, in view of the reflexivity of “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)” (and since we can

7 The Trivialization of Mathematical Logic
197
get rid of “𝑎” on both sides), the formula
(2.21𝑘)
“/𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏”
which demands that, whenever 𝑏is false, 𝑏> 𝑐must be true.
We briefly turn to quantification and to identity, both undefinable in the truth value
system.
The result of universal quantification of a statement 𝑎can be defined as the weakest
statement strong enough to satisfy the law of specification, that is to say, the law
“what is valid for all instances is valid for every single one”.
The result of existential quantification of the statement 𝑎can be defined as the
strongest statement weak enough to follow from every instance of 𝑎. (In both cases,
we can easily explain what “instance” means.)
The identity statement “Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)” can be defined as the weakest statement strong
enough to satisfy the following formula (we use here “𝑎(𝑥)” as name of a statement-
function in which a variable occurs whose name is “𝑥”)
“Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), 𝑎(𝑥)/𝑎(𝑦)”
|
726
that is to say, the formula corresponding to what Hilbert-Bernays call the second
identity axiom. (Hilbert-Bernays’s first axiom follows from our demand that the
identity statement must be the weakest statement satisfying this formula.) Difference
can be defined, without presupposing negation, by a dual definition.
In precisely the same way as the Identity of the entities denoted by 𝑥and 𝑦we can
define “{𝑥}(𝑦)” i.e., the name of a statement expressing that the entity denoted by 𝑦
is a member of the unit class of the entity denoted by 𝑥(or that these two share all
properties).
(3)
These definitions in terms of inference – they may be called inferential definitions –
suffice for constructing the lower functional logic. They suffice for Boolean algebra,
and for classical Aristotelian logic. We shall give a brief sketch of how these may be
obtained in a simple way.
We use now “𝑃(𝑥)”, “𝑄(𝑥)” etc. as names of statements with one variable 𝑥; and
we use “(𝑥)” as universal operator. Then we can define “𝑃⊂𝑄” by the following
formula
(3.1)
“𝑃⊂𝑄//(𝑥)(𝑃(𝑥) > 𝑄(𝑥))”
We further define 𝑃= 𝑄by
(3.2)
“𝑃= 𝑄//𝑃⊂𝑄∧𝑄⊂𝑃”
and the Boolean product “𝑃𝑄” by

198
Karl R. Popper
(3.3)
“𝑃𝑄= 𝑅//(𝑥)(((𝑃(𝑥) ∧𝑄(𝑥)) > 𝑅(𝑥)) ∧(𝑅(𝑥) > (𝑃(𝑥) ∧𝑄(𝑥))))”
We define 𝑃−, the (classical) complement of 𝑃, by
(3.4)
“𝑃−= 𝑄//(𝑥)((𝑃(𝑥)𝑘> 𝑄(𝑥)) ∧(𝑄(𝑥) > 𝑃(𝑥)𝑘))”
and introduce the constant “𝑂” by
(3.5)
“𝑃= 𝑂//𝑃= 𝑃𝑃−”
This is all we need for Boolean algebra, since the associative and commutative
laws for the Boolean product and the law of idempotence follow from the definition
of the product, i.e. from 3.3.
Part of classical Aristotelian logic can be obtained in the usual way, as part of
Boolean algebra, with “𝑃⊂𝑄” as classical “𝑎-proposition”, and with the classical
“𝑒-proposition” defined by
(3.6)
“𝑃𝑒𝑄//𝑃𝑄= 𝑂”
We obtain, as is well known, only 15 of the syllogistic moods. But we can obtain the
whole of the classical theory of the syllogism (and thus prove its consistency) if we
decide to define the 𝑎-proposition by
(3.7)
“𝑃𝑎𝑄//𝑃⊂𝑄∧(𝑃= 𝑂)𝑘”
The classical “𝑖-proposition” (denoted by “𝑃𝑖𝑄”) and the classical “𝑜-proposition”
are, of course, defined as the classical negations of the 𝑒-proposition and 𝑎-proposition,
respectively.
|
727
The only classical – or semi-classical – rules which now do not remain valid (but
only conditionally valid) are the rules of obversion, in the direction from negative to
affirmative propositions.
A system in which an axiom schema “𝑃𝑖𝑃” is accepted has been published by
⟨Bocheński, 1948⟩, and similar systems were previously published, according to
Bocheński (op. cit., notes 3 and 5a) by ⟨Łukasiewicz, 1929⟩and ⟨Ajdukiewicz,
1926–1927⟩. But such a system, although consistent, cannot be adequate, since it
is not compatible with the two demands that (a) there should be sufficient terms in
the system to have true instances of all four categorical propositions and (b) that
“𝑃𝑖𝑄𝑅/𝑃𝑖𝑄∧𝑃𝑖𝑅” should hold (i.e. that from “Some men are tall and fat” we
can deduce “Some men are tall and some men are fat”). These two demands seem
to be clearly needed for adequacy. But if they are accepted, then “𝑃𝑖𝑃” leads to
a contradiction. For we obtain from it “𝑃𝑅𝑖𝑃𝑅” and thus, by conversion and (b),
“𝑃𝑖𝑅”, which contradicts (a) since it says that no example of an 𝑒-proposition can
be true. No such difficulty arises in our system which establishes the fact that all the
syllogistic rules can be obtained from appropriate definitions of the four categorical
propositions.

Are Contradictions Embracing? (1943)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1943). Are Contradictions
Embracing? In: Mind 52 (205), pp. 47–50.
Editorial notes: The article is an elaboration on a footnote to “What Is Dialectic?”, Popper (1940,
fn on p. 408); . Popper announced it in a letter to Harold Jeffreys of 26 April 1942 (this volume,
§ 27.1). In a letter from Popper to Carnap of 15 October 1942 (this volume, § 23.1) he calls it an
“unimportant Note”, and explains why he uses the word “embracing” instead of Carnap’s word
“comprehensive”: he did not yet know Carnap’s Introduction to Semantics (1942). However, in the
last passage the possibility of a negation too weak to be a logical constant is indicated, which raises
the question of logicality. The original publication contains the address “Canterbury University
College, New Zealand” and the name “K. R. Popper” at the end, which we have omitted here.

Under the title Does a Contradiction Entail Every Proposition? ⟨Jeffreys, 1942⟩
Mr. Harold Jeffreys writes that he was “satisfied at first, but on further thought . . .
again doubtful”, when considering my affirmative answer to this question (sketched,
in a non-technical paper, in ⟨Popper, 1940⟩. Cp. also the historical references to
Łukasiewicz and Duns Scotus, made in ⟨Popper, 1941⟩a). Mr. Jeffreys’ doubt appears
to be due to the following consideration. He believes (a) that the very argument
used to show that every sentence can be inferred from a contradiction assumes the
inadmissibility of some (or the same) contradiction; and (b) that this way of arguing
is circular. Before re-analysing my argument in order to show that I did not make the
a Popper (1941) reads: “Apart from this correction I should like to add, as an acknowledgement, to
the footnote on p. 408: ‘The following more technical considerations, pp. 406–408, were known,
in essence, to Duns Scotus (d 1308), as shown by J. Łukasiewicz, the famous Polish logician and
historian of logic; cf. ⟨Łukasiewicz, 1935⟩’”. Łukasiewicz (1935, p.124) gives Duns Scotus’ proof
(by means of an example) of ex contradictione sequitur quodlibet which uses disjunction introduction
and the disjunctive syllogism.

alleged assumption, I should like to mention that even if I had, my argument would
not be circular, so far as Mr. Jeffreys’ problem is concerned. For there may be people
who are prepared to grant the falsity or inadmissibility of contradictions, but who
are not satisfied that every contradiction must be embracing, i.e. that every sentence
can be inferred from it. (In fact, this attitude is precisely Mr. Jeffreys’ if I am not
mistaken.) In other words, even if I were to admit (a), or in Mr. Jeffreys’ words, that
the denial of “the possibility that p and non-p can both be true . . . assumes that the
system does not contain the contradiction . . .”, even then I would only assume that
the contradiction is false, not that it is embracing; so that the argument would not be
circular.
However, I really tried in my paper to show more than the “embracingness” of
contradictions. I aimed also at showing that the embracing character of contradictions
is a practical reason for not admitting them. This further aim could not be realized if
(a) had to be granted, i.e. if we had to assume the inadmissibility of contradictions, in
order to show that they are embracing. In connection with this aim, Mr. Jeffreys would
indeed be right in believing that (b) follows from (a), i.e. my argument would indeed
be circular, if I had made the assumption (a). But I do not agree with Mr. Jeffreys that
I have made it, or that I have to make it.
Mr. Jeffreys’ argument appears to be this. I postulated in my paper two rules of
inference:
(1) From any given premise, a conclusion can be drawn which is a disjunction
containing the premise as one component and any sentence whatsoever as its
second component.
(2) From two premises of which the first is a disjunction, and the second the negation
of one component of that disjunction, |
48
the second component of that disjunction
can be drawn as a conclusion.
Nothing beyond these two rules need be assumed in my proof. Mr. Jeffreys argues,
however, that (2) implicitly assumes that a sentence and its negation cannot both be
true; and he can point to a statement in my paper (the last on p. 409) which seems
to admit that this assumption is implied. But this is a misunderstanding. In logic,
as well as in mathematics, we must always clearly distinguish between the formal
trend of the argument and the personal intuitive procedure by which we try to “grasp”
it. For instance, we can build up a system of Geometry in a strictly deductive way,
without the use of illustrative diagrams, but few people would intuitively “grasp”
such a system without using them, privately, as it were. It is only in this illustrative
way that (2) “assumes” the inadmissibility of contradictions. In order to convince
those who are reluctant to admit (2) I argued ad hominem: “The first premise, being a
disjunction, maintains that at least one of its components is true. The second premise,
being the negation of one of the components, maintains that this component cannot
be the true one; therefore, the other must be true.” This “argument” indeed makes
use of the intuition that a sentence and its negation cannot both be true. But it is only
an illustration; like the illustrative diagrams, it cannot prove anything at all. Our rule
(2) is not deducible from, or replaceable by, the assumption that a sentence and its
negation cannot both be true (i.e. the so-called Law of Contradiction). Nor does it
imply this assumption. In fact, so little is needed to show the embracingness of and

thereby the practical uselessness of contradictory premises, that we can, if we like,
proceed in our construction of a system of logic in the following way: we can first
assume a rudimentary system of the “calculus of propositions” which is so incomplete,
or logically weak, that it is part of practically all logical systems, and that the so-called
laws of contradiction, excluded middle, identity, and double negation, as formulated
within the calculus of propositions, can be proved to be entirely independent of it.
With the help of this rudimentary system, we can next establish the embracingness
and uselessness of contradictions. (And only after having done this, do we proceed, if
we wish, to strengthen our system, until all non-embracing formulae are deducible;
thus we may add next, for instance, the “law of contradictions”.) To prove that this is
possible, I enter into some technicalities.
(B)
Our two rules of inference (1) and (2) must not be taken, of course, as formulae of a
propositional calculus. But they can be replaced by certain formulae (of the system
of Material Implication). (2) would have to be replaced by the formula (2′), and
by the “Principle of Inference” (cp. PM, i.e. Principia Mathematica 1·1; LL, i.e.,
p. 126, and 14·29, which enables us to carry out all proofs here needed also within a
System of Strict Implication or Entailment; cp. also LL 19·72)b. The rule (1) can be
|
49
replaced by the formula (1′). We thus arrive at a rudimentary system consisting of
the primitive formulae (1′) and (2′):
𝑝⊃(𝑝∨𝑞)
(1′)
(𝑝∨𝑞) ⊃(∼𝑝⊃𝑞)
(2′)
(1′) is identical with PM 2·2; (2′) with PM 2·53. The two formulae (1′), (2′) constitute
a system sufficient to prove the embracingness of any “pair of contradictory sentences”,
i.e. any two formulae of which one is the negation of the other.
By combining (1′) with (2′), we can eliminate the disjunction. We thus obtain
another example of a rudimentary system with the same property, namely the single
primitive formula
(PM 2·24)
“𝑝⊃(∼𝑝⊃𝑞)”
which is also Carnap’s PSIIi, and corresponds to his PSIic. (Carnap’s PSIi is not, as
Mr. Jeffreys says, “∼𝑝⊃(𝑝⊃𝑞)”, i.e. (PM 2·21), which has, however, analogous
properties. It is important to note that none of these formulae can be said to be
objectionable or “drastic” as Mr. Jeffreys suggests; not even from the standpoint of a
theory of Strict Implication or Entailment, since such a theory may contain the whole
theory of Material Implication, as Lewis has shown.)
b Cf. Whitehead and Russell (1910–1913, 1925–1927) and Lewis and Langford (1932).
c The formulas PSIIi and PSIi can be found in Carnap (1934a, 1937).

204
Karl R. Popper
(C)
The last system, viz. the single formula (PM 2·24) can be used to throw some light on
the weakness of these rudimentary systems. For it is clear that it can be replaced for
our purpose by the following System A of three primitive formulae:
𝑝⊃(𝑞⊃𝑝)
(1′′)
(𝑞⊃𝑝) ⊃(∼𝑝⊃∼𝑞)
(2′′)
∼∼𝑞⊃𝑞
(3′′)
These formulae correspond to Hilbert-Bernays Id, p. 66 (I, 1); (V, 1); (V, 3). With
the help of proofs supplied by them, pp. 76ff., it can easily be shown that, even after
adding their formulae defining conjunction (whereupon for instance “𝑝. ∼𝑝” can be
shown to be embracing), and disjunction, the laws of contradiction, excluded middle,
identity, and the first law of double negation (V, 2) are all independent of System 𝐴.
(D)
If we now omit (3′′),i.e. the second law of double negation,we still retain a rudimentary
system sufficientto prove the practicaluselessness ofanypairofcontradictorypremises.
In this System 𝑁, which consists only of (1′′) and (2′′), we can no longer prove full
embracingness of contradictions, only what may be called their n-embracingness;
i.e. we can prove that any negation of any formula whatsoever can be derived. But
this is enough to show their practical uselessness. (Another System 𝑁′, with the same
properties as 𝑁, is, of course, the single formula “𝑝⊃(∼𝑝⊃∼𝑞)”.)
Of other “rudimentary systems” I mention only the so-called positive logic, which
does not operate with negations. In such a |
50
system, contradictions (i.e. sentences or
classes of sentences from which a “pair of contradictory sentences” can be deduced)
do not exist; but there are still embracing formulae (e.g. the single formula “𝑝⊃𝑞”).
To sum up: in any but the most rudimentary logical systems, and certainly in any
system rich enough for mathematical derivations, embracingness, n-embracingness,
and contradictoriness coincide. Systems containing the operation of negation may be
so much weakened that contradictoriness only implies n-embracingness. It appears,
however, that we cannot weaken them further without depriving negation of the
character of a logical operation.
There is little hope for Hegelian dialectics to find support in even the weakest of
logics . . ..

A Note on Tarski’s Definition of Truth (1955)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1955a). A Note on
Tarski’s Definition of Truth. In: Mind 64 (255), pp. 388–391.
Editorial notes: The article was also reprinted in Popper (1972) and has been translated into Italian
(cf. Lube, 2005 for bibliographic details). We number footnotes consecutively, whereas in the original
footnotes are numbered per page. The original publication contains the name “Karl R. Popper.” and
the address “London School of Economics” at the end, which we have omitted here.

In his famous paper on the Concept of Truth1, Tarski describes a method of defining
the idea of truth, or more precisely, the idea of “𝑥is a true statement (of the language
𝐿)”. The method is first applied to the language of the class calculus, but it is a
method of very general application to many different (formalized) languages,including
languages which would allow the formalization of some empirical theories. The
characteristic of his method is that the definition of “true statement” is based upon a
definition of the relation of fulfilment, or more precisely, of the phrase “the infinite
sequence 𝑓fulfils the statement-function 𝑥”.2 This relation of fulfilment is of interest
on its own account, quite apart from the fact that it is crucial for the definition of
truth (and that the step from the definition of fulfilment to that of truth presents
hardly any problem). The present note is concerned with the problem of employing,
in the definition of fulfilment, finite instead of infinite sequences. This is, I believe,
a desideratum both from the point of view of an application of the theory to the
empirical sciences, and also from a didactic point of view.
Tarski himself briefly discusses two methods3 which employ finite sequences of
1 Cf. ⟨Tarski, 1935a⟩. I understand that Tarski now prefers to translate “Aussage” and “Aus-
sagefunktion” by “sentence” and “sentence-function” (while I am using here “statement” and
“statement-function”) and that these terms are used in Professor J. H. Woodger’s translation of
Tarski’s logical papers, soon to be published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford ⟨cf. Tarski, 1956⟩.
2 Cf. ⟨Tarski, 1935a⟩pp. 311, 313. Note that the class of statement-functions includes that of
statements, i.e. of closed statement-functions.
3 The first alternative method is sketched in Tarski’s note 40 on pp. 309f. (It is not explicitly stated
that this method may be used for the purpose of avoiding infinite sequences, but it is clear that it

varying length instead of infinite sequences. But he points out that these alternative
methods have certain disadvantages. The first of them, he indicates, leads to “con-
siderable complications” (ziemlich bedeutenden Komplikationen) in the definition
of fulfilment (Definition 22), while the second has the disadvantage of “a certain
artificiality” (eine gewisse Künstlichkeit), |
389
insofar as it leads to a definition of truth
(Definition 23) with the help of the concept of an “empty sequence” or a “sequence
of zero length”.4 What I wish to point out in this note is that a comparatively slight
variation of Tarski’s procedure allows us to operate with finite sequences without
getting involved in complications, or in such artificialities (e.g. empty sequences) as
Tarski had in mind. The method allows us to preserve the very natural procedure of
the condition (𝛿) of Tarski’s Definition 22 (and thus to avoid the detour of introducing
relations – or attributes – of a degree equal to the number of the free variables of the
statement-function under consideration). My variant of Tarski’s method is a slight
one; but in view of the fact that Tarski refers to other variants which have considerable
disadvantages, but not to this one, it may be worth while to describe what is perhaps
a small improvement.5
In order to do so, it is useful to mention, informally, first the idea of a place number
𝑛(or the 𝑛th place) of a finite sequence of things, and secondly, the idea of the length
of a finite sequence 𝑓, i.e. the number of places of 𝑓(in symbols, 𝑁𝑝( 𝑓)) which
is identical with its greatest place number, and of the comparison of different finite
sequences with respect to their length. We mention, in the third place, that a thing
may occupy a certain place – the 𝑛th, say – in the sequence, and may, therefore, be
described as the 𝑛th thing or the 𝑛th member of the sequence in question. It should
be noted that one and the same thing may occur in different places of a sequence, and
also in different sequences.6
can be so used.) The second method is described in note 43, pp. 313f. The method suggested in
this note of Tarski’s, which is technically different from the one used by Tarski in his text, is used
by Carnap in his Introduction to Semantics (1942), pp. 47f. Although Carnap refers to Tarski, he
overlooks Tarski’s anticipation of this particular method. (There is even a third method, indicated by
Tarski in note 87 on p. 368. This device is very simple, but undoubtedly highly artificial, in Tarski’s
sense of artificiality; moreover, this method only relates to the definition of truth itself, not to that of
fulfilment, which has an interest of its own.)
4 This artifical concept is also used by Carnap.
5 The main difference between my method and those suggested by Tarski (mentioned in note 3 above)
consists in this. Tarski suggests to correlate, with a given function (either infinite sequences or) finite
sequences of a definite length (dependent on the function) while I use finite sequences which are “of
sufficient length” (Definition 22a), i.e. not too short for the function in question. Accordingly, my
finite sequences can be of any length (beyond a certain minimum which depends on the function).
But the admission of finite sequences of any length (provided it is sufficient) does not involve any
vagueness, since we easily obtain a theorem (cf. Tarski’s Lemma A, p. 317) according to which, if
𝑓fulfils 𝑥, then every extension 𝑔of 𝑓also fulfils 𝑥(where 𝑔is an extension of 𝑓if and only if
for every 𝑓𝑖there exists a 𝑔𝑖such that 𝑔𝑖= 𝑓𝑖). Thus the theorem informs us that we only need to
consider the shortest finite sequences of those which are adequate to the function under consideration
(to be sure, to the total compound function under consideration, as opposed to its components).
6 The things considered in this section of Tarski’s work are classes; in view of the development of
Tarski’s §§ 4 and 5, I shall here speak of “sequences of things” instead of sequences of classes,
assuming that a relation 𝑓𝑖⊂𝑓𝑘is defined for all things 𝑓𝑖and 𝑓𝑘.

9 A Note on Tarski’s Definition of Truth
209
Like Tarski, I use “ 𝑓1”, “ 𝑓2”, . . ., “ 𝑓𝑖”, “ 𝑓𝑘”, . . ., “ 𝑓𝑛”, as names of the things
which occupy the 1st, 2nd, 𝑖th, 𝑘th, . . ., 𝑛th |
390
place of the sequence 𝑓. I use the same
notation as Tarski does, except that I use “𝑃𝑘𝑦” as the name of the universalization
of the expression 𝑦with respect to the variable 𝑣𝑘.7 It is assumed that to Tarski’s
definition (11)8 is added a definition of “𝑣𝑘occurs in the statement-function 𝑥” –
an assumption which in no way goes beyond Tarski’s methods, and which in fact is
implicit in Tarski’s own treatment.
We can now proceed to replace Tarski’s Definition 22. We shall replace it by two
definitions, the preliminary definition 22a, and the definition 22b which corresponds
to Tarski’s own definition.
Definition 22a
A finite sequence of things 𝑓is adequate to the statement-function 𝑥(or of sufficient
length with respect to 𝑥) if, and only if,
for every natural number 𝑛,
if 𝑣𝑛occurs in 𝑥, then the number of places of 𝑓is at least equal to 𝑛(i.e. 𝑁𝑝( 𝑓) ≥𝑛).
Definition 22b9
The sequence 𝑓fulfils the statement-function 𝑥if, and only if, 𝑓is a finite sequence
of things, and 𝑥is a statement-function, and
(1) 𝑓is adequate to 𝑥,
(2) 𝑥satisfies one of the following four conditions:
(𝛼) There exist natural numbers 𝑖and 𝑘such that 𝑥= 𝜄𝑖,𝑘and 𝑓𝑖⊂𝑓𝑘.
(𝛽) There exists a statement-function 𝑦such that 𝑥= 𝑦, and 𝑓does not fulfil 𝑦.
(𝛾) There exist two statement-functions 𝑦and 𝑧such that 𝑥= 𝑦+ 𝑧and 𝑓fulfils
either 𝑦or 𝑧or both.
(𝛿) There exists a natural number 𝑘and a statement-function 𝑦such that
(a) 𝑥= 𝑃𝑘𝑦,
(b) every finite sequence 𝑔whose length is equal to 𝑓fulfils 𝑦, provided 𝑔
satisfies the following condition: for every natural number 𝑛, if 𝑛is a
place number of 𝑓and 𝑛≠𝑘, then 𝑔𝑛= 𝑓𝑛.
Tarski’s Definition 23 can now be replaced by one of the following two equivalent10
definitions.
| Definition 23+
391
𝑥is a true statement (i.e. 𝑥∈𝑊𝑟) if and only if (a) 𝑥is a statement (𝑥∈𝐴𝑠) and
(b) every finite sequence of things which is adequate to 𝑥fulfils 𝑥.
7 Cf. Tarski’s deﬁnition (6) on p. 292.
8 Op. cit. p. 294. Tarski deﬁnes explicitly only the phrase “The variable 𝑣𝑘occurs freely in the
statement-functions 𝑥”.
9 This is exactly like Tarski’s deﬁnition 22, except that (1) is added to Tarski’s condition (in order
to replace his inﬁnite sequences by ﬁnite ones), and that our (𝛿)(𝑏) contains a minor adjustment,
insofar as it refers to the length of 𝑓(and of 𝑔).
10 The equivalence emerges from Tarski’s consideration; cf. op. cit. p. 313, lines 13 to 16.
Deﬁnition 23++
𝑥is a true statement (i.e. 𝑥∈𝑊𝑟) if and only if (a) 𝑥is a statement (𝑥∈𝐴𝑠) and
(b) there exists at least one ﬁnite sequence of things which fulﬁls 𝑥.

210
Karl R. Popper
It may be noted that the formulation of 23++ does not need to refer to the
adequacy of the sequence. It may be further noted that in 23+ (which corresponds
exactly to Tarski’s deﬁnition), but not in 23++, the condition (a) may be replaced
by “𝑥is a statement-function”, thus achieving a certain generalization by including
certain statement-functions with free variables, for example, the function 𝜄𝑖,𝑖; i.e. the
universally valid (allgemeingültige) statement-functions.11
In an analogous way, 23++, if extended to functions, leads to the notion of a
satisﬁable (erfüllbare) statement-function.
I may ﬁnally mention that, in its application to an empirical theory (at least partially
formalized), and especially to non-quantiﬁed statement-functions of such a theory,
the deﬁnition of fulﬁlment, i.e. Deﬁnition 22b, seems to be perfectly “natural” from
an intuitive point of view, mainly owing to the avoidance of an inﬁnite sequence.12

more important, to deﬁne a refuting instance of any statement-function (open or closed) as a ﬁnite
sequence of things which does not fulﬁl it.

attempts to solve the paradox of the liar by proposing what I shall refer to as his

Using “𝑎” as a variable name of a proposition, this classification becomes (1)
𝑎𝜖𝐼≡(∼(𝑎𝜖𝑇) & ∼(𝑎𝜖𝐹)). Using “𝑖” as a constant name of a proposition (i.e.
of the paradox), we put (2) 𝑖= “𝑖𝜖𝐹”. Professor Fitch’s hypothesis then becomes:
(3) 𝑖𝜖𝐼. Now assume this hypothesis to be true. Then (4) ∼(𝑖𝜖𝐹) must be true
in view of (1); and since in view of (2), (4) is the negation of 𝑖, we find that (5)
(the negation of 𝑖) 𝜖𝑇. But (5) may also be written (6) 𝑖𝜖𝐹.
From the hypothesis that (e) is true we have thus derived two contradictory
propositions, (4) and (6). Thus (3), i.e. Professor Fitch’s hypothesis, cannot be true;
it must be either false or indefinite; and for his system to be consistent, (3) must be
indefinite: it then escapes our reductio. But the consistency of the system results from
weakness: it fails in that kind of refutation it was designed (pp. 217–225) to admit.
By interpreting “𝐼” as the class of meaningless non-propositions, our argument
down to (6) can be used to refute the hypothesis that 𝑖is meaningless.

On Subjunctive Conditionals with Impossible
Antecedents (1959)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1959a). On Subjunctive
Conditionals with Impossible Antecedents. In: Mind 68 (272), pp. 518–520.
Editorial note: The original publication contains the name “Karl R. Popper” and the address
“University of London” at the end, which we have omitted here.

By a subjunctive conditional I mean here a statement of the following kind:
“Whether or not 𝑝is true in fact – if it were true, then 𝑞would certainly (or
necessarily) be true”; or, perhaps, “should 𝑝hold, then 𝑞would hold”, etc.
One can use the symbol
“𝑝⊃
𝑠𝑞”
as an abbreviation of a statement of this kind. (This may also be read, if one prefers,
“𝑝subjunctively implies 𝑞”, in analogy to reading “𝑝⊃𝑞” as “𝑝materially implies
𝑞”.)
The question to which this note is devoted is this: Let us use the name “opposite
subjunctive conditionals” ⟨for⟩two subjunctive conditionals withthe same antecedents
and directly opposite consequents, such as
𝑝⊃
𝑠𝑞
(i)
𝑝⊃
𝑠∼𝑞
(ii)
We may then ask: can two opposite subjunctive conditionals be true together?
There seems to be considerable disagreement on this question. In an appendix to
my book The Logic of Scientific Discoverya (new appendix ∗x), I implicitly assumed,
without argument, that all those interested in subjunctive conditionals would agree
that (i) and (ii) could well be true together, provided 𝑝was (physically) impossible. (I

even assumed more than this.) I soon had to learn that some who had thought much
on the subject disagreed with me on this point.1
Without claiming to say anything new here I shall therefore attempt to establish,
by purely intuitive argument, two things.
(1) We can construct consistent sets of premises from which two opposite subjunctive
conditionals, related as (i) and (ii), may be deduced by valid intuitive arguments.
(2) As a consequence of (1), we are bound to admit that two opposite subjunctive
conditionals can be true together. If this admission is felt, by some, to be counter-
intuitive, then we may ask them to remember that there are certain unusual and
rarely used |
519
cases (“zero-cases” or “points of singularity”) upon which it is
unwise to bring intuition to bear immediately.
Before proceeding to an empirical example (II), I shall sketch an arithmetical
example (I).
Consider the following three compatible premises, expressed in what may be called
the “subjunctive style”.
(I)
Should a certain number 𝑎be a natural number between 3 and 6 (i.e. 3 < 𝑎< 6),
then the following would hold: should 𝑎≠4, then 𝑎= 5, so that 𝑎would be a
prime number; and should 𝑎≠5, then 𝑎= 4, so that 𝑎would not be a prime
number.
Should 𝑎> 10, then 𝑎≠4
(IA)
Should 𝑎> 10, then 𝑎≠5
(IB)
Moreover, we state categorically as a fact (fourth premise):
(I+)
𝑎> 10
Now two people, Allen and Brown, are asked to consider, in the light of these
premises, the following question: if (per impossibile) 𝑎were between 3 and 6, would
it be prime or not?
Allen may then argue from (I), (IA), and (I+), that 𝑎would be prime; and Brown
from (I), (IB), and (I+) may argue that 𝑎would not be prime.
I believe that both deductions, however trite, are correct. I further hold that the
situation is precisely analogous to the case where we can deduce two opposite material
conditionals 𝑝⊃𝑞and 𝑝⊃∼𝑞from consistent premises. There is no problem here:
we simply conclude in this case that, in the light of the premises, 𝑝must be false.
Similarly with subjunctive conditionals: we simply conclude that, in the light of the
premises, 𝑝must be impossible.
To this argument, the reply has been made that reasoning from arithmetical
examples is unconvincing in questions of this kind. I therefore proceed now to an
empirical example. We consider the following three subjunctive premises:
1 See the challenging paper ⟨Downing (1959).⟩. Note especially the remark on p. 126: “It seems
clear, though it is perhaps impossible to prove, that two subjunctive conditionals with the same
antecedent and contradictory consequents cannot both be true.” If I am right, then this assumption,
though intuitively persuasive, can be disproved.

(II)
If Peter were now in his flat, he would be either in his bedroom or in his
bathroom, and he could not be in both at the same time, and he could be in no
other room (say, because the flat has no other rooms).
(IIA) If Peter were now about twenty miles from his flat, he could not possibly be in
his bedroom now.
(IIB) If Peter were now about twenty miles from his flat, he could not possibly be in
his bathroom now.
Moreover, we have the factual premise (fourth premise):
(II+) Peter is now about twenty miles from his flat.
We ask Allen and Brown to consider, in the light of these premises, whether or
not Peter would be in his bathroom now if (per impossibile) he were now in his flat.
Allen argues from (II), (IIA), and (II+) that, if Peter were now in his flat, he would
now be in his bathroom; while Brown argues from (II), (IIB), and (II+), that if Peter
were now in his flat, he could not possibly be now in his bathroom.
Again, I think that both arguments are valid.

520
Now it is clear that our two sets of premises are both consistent, since they are
both satisfiable: if we put 𝑎= 11, our first set of premises becomes true. Similar, the
second set of premises was, in fact, true of my friend Peter M. some short time ago.
Since from true premises only true conclusions can be validly derived, we are bound
to admit that two opposite subjunctive conditionals, related like (i) and (ii), can be
true together.
To my own mind, this fact is far from counter-intuitive. But since there are people
who find it counter-intuitive that two opposite material conditionals can be true
together (or perhaps that “Every Pegasus has wings” and “No Pegasus has wings”
might be true together), it is to be expected that there will be people who find our
result intuitively unacceptable.
Yet I feel that our intuitions are not always to be trusted in cases which simply
do not arise, or which are avoided, in ordinary life, or in ordinary parlance. Perhaps
the simplest case of failure arises in connection with the question: is zero a number?
There is no doubt that, in ordinary parlance, it is not. “I have a number of pennies
in my pocket, and the number is zero” would be eccentric in ordinary parlance. (In
fact the smallest number that makes “a number of” in ordinary parlance, is three.)
This example is not as trite as it looks: the extension of the idea of number from
many to two, and to one, and ultimately to zero, is a feat of abstraction which was not
easy to perform: we still count “one, two, three”, rather than “zero, one, two, three”.
Yet while the question whether we should call zero a number is a comparatively
unimportant terminological question, grave and startling conclusions may be drawn
from the assumption (as may be drawn from any logically false assumption) that two
opposite subjunctive conditionals, since they cannot be true together, cannot both
follow from consistent premises. One such startling conclusion would be that Brown
has succeeded in refuting Allen.

Lejewski’s Axiomatization of My Theory of
Deducibility (1974)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This article is a corrected reprint of K. R. Popper (1974b). Lejewski’s
Axiomatization of My Theory of Deducibility. In: The Philosophy of Karl Popper.
Ed. by P. A. Schilpp. The Library of Living Philosophers. La Salle, Illinois: Open
Court, pp. 1095–1096.
Editorial note: Popper replies to Lejewski’s (1974) contribution in Schilpp (1974).
I
1095
Professor Lejewski’s contribution is a very generous reconstruction of a number of
formal-logical (or rather, metalogical) papers which I wrote in the years from 1946
to 1948. The amount of work devoted by Lejewski to these papers is great, and his
criticism is admirable: it is always fair and always fully justified; and, I suppose, only
too often it is too moderate.
Professor Lejewski has done his best for me – more than I thought possible. Taking
up and developing further a suggestion of Bernay’s, he has proved that a system
which he denotes by P is inferentially equivalent to one which he denotes by T, where
the two letters stand for Popper and Tarski. This he does by (a) first eliminating
certain blunders from my system, and (b) formulating both systems “in the language
which we owe to Lesniewski”. He thus arrives at a result which does me more than
justice, I fear, for nobody will question the interest of Tarski’s system. I am immensely
grateful to Professor Lejewski for this result, for it shows that what I wrote (with
much enthusiasm) was not a complete failure.

However, much as I am indebted to Lejewski for thus saving my honour, as it were,
he has not brought out, or even briefly hinted at, what my intentions were in writing
these bad and ill-fated papers. By putting them in Lesniewski’s language he has,
in fact, done something extremely interesting, but at the same time something that
goes contrary to my intentions. For my |
1096
main intention was to simplify logic by
developing what has been called by others “natural deduction”. I suppose that as
an effort to build up a simple system of natural deduction (a commonsense logic,
as it were), my papers were just a failure. However, Evert Beth told me that he was
inspired partly by them to build up his own logic (his “semantic tableaux”). He told
me so after I had received much discouragement, which had depressed me and had
made me give up the attempt at developing my ideas further.
III
My papers were, largely, the result of an attempt to reform the teaching of elementary
logic – the propositional calculus and the lower functional calculus; and I had some
encouraging results, especially in quantification theory, which Lejewski for lack
of space was unable to discuss. But my papers were, at the same time, inspired
by the hope of solving a problem which Tarski (in “On the Concept of Logical
Consequence”), a paper which I knew well in its German originala: a paper different
from those with which Lejewski shows that my papers can be compared) indicates as
insoluble; rightly, I now suspect. This was the problem of distinguishing between
logical (or as I prefer to call them, “formative”) signs and descriptive signs. Logical
or formative signs are words like “not”, “or”, “and”, “all”, “there is at least one”.
Descriptive signs are “atom”, “dog”, “green”, and so on. The task of distinguishing
between the two types of signs or words seems at first sight simple; but for example
the phrase “is identical with” does not obviously belong to one group or the other.
Tarski showed that the concept of logical consequence can be easily elucidated (with
the help of the concept of truth or of a “model”) once we have decided upon a list of
logical or formative signs. My idea was very simple: I suggested we take the concept
“logical consequence” as primitive and try to show that those signs are logical or
formative which can be defined with the help of this primitive concept. Most of my
work was an attempt to carry this out. It is only fair to say that my papers did not
succeed in this (as emerges from Lejewski’s analysis). But I should add that Lejewski
works within an elaborate system – that of Lesniewski – which demands a degree of
explicitness which few other logicians live up to; indeed, which few logicians ever
mastered, or even know of in these days. And also that my papers were “essays” or
“attempts”, trying to sketch a way; I had little hope of finalizing it.
But I should make plain that I now think that Tarski’s scepticism concerning a clear
a Tarski (1936b).

12 Lejewski’s Axiomatization of My Theory of Deducibility
219
demarcation between logical and descriptive signs is well founded. Demarcations
are needed; but they are usually not sharp. This seems always to be so, interestingly
enough; and it is perhaps not to be regretted.

Verf. schlägt zum Aufbau derLogik einen wesentlich anderen Weg als den üblichen ein.
Anstatt die logischen Grundbeziehungen wie die des Aussagenkalküls durch Axiome
und Ableitungsregeln zu charakterisieren, wird gewissermaßen eine syntaktische
Definition dieser Operationen gegeben. Grundlegend sind zwei undefinierte Begriffe
der Metasprache, nämlich die Ableitbarkeit von 𝑏aus 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛und die Substitution
einer Variablen für eine andere innerhalb eines Ausdrucks. Mit Hilfe dieser Begriffe
wird nun z. B. nicht eigentlich die Konjunktion definiert, sondern gewissermaßen die
logische Rolle der Konjunktion, d. h. es wird definiert, unter welchen Umständen
ein Ausdruck 𝑎zu der Konjunktion von 𝑏und 𝑐in der Beziehung der gegenseitigen
Ableitbarkeit steht. Entsprechende Definitionen werden für Disjunktion, Implikation,
klassische und intuitionistische Negation, universale und existentielle Quantifikation,
sowie auch für die modalen Verknüpfungen der Notwendigkeit, Möglichkeit usw.
aufgestellt. Die Hilfsmittel, die in der Metasprache benutzt werden, um aus diesen
Definitionen die notwendigen Folgerungen zu gewinnen, sind die positive Logik und
die Regeln zum Gebrauch der Identität und der universalen Quantifikation.

Ackermann, Beth, Curry, Hasenjaeger, Kemeny, Kleene, McKinsey, and Nagel
The author proposes for the construction of logic an essentially different way to
the usual one. Instead of characterizing the basic logical relations like those of the
propositional calculus through axioms and derivation rules, in a way, a syntactic
definition of those operations is given. Two undefined concepts of the metalanguage
are fundamental, namely the derivability of 𝑏from 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛and the substitution
of one variable for another in an expression. With the help of these concepts it is
not the conjunction, but, in a sense, the logical role of conjunction that is defined,
i.e. the circumstances by which an expression 𝑎stands in the relation of mutual
deducibility to the conjunction of 𝑏and 𝑐. Corresponding definitions are given for
disjunction, implication, classical and intuitionistic negation, universal and existential
quantification, as well as for the modal connectives of necessity, possibility, etc. The
means that are used in the metalanguage to obtain from these definitions the necessary
conclusions are the positive logic and the rules for the use of identity and of universal
quantification.
13.2 Ackermann (1949a): Review of “On the Theory of Deduction,
Part I” (Popper, 1948a)
In bezug auf die hier vorliegende allgemeine Tendenz vgl. die Besprechung einer
früheren Arbeit des Verf. ⟨Ackermann, 1948; dieser Band, § 13.1⟩. Für die Ableit-
barkeit von 𝑏aus 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛werden hier neue Grundregeln aufgestellt und daraus
die in früheren Arbeiten benutzten bewiesen. Verf. zeigt ferner, wie sich gewisse
allgemeine, zur Theorie der Deduktion gehörige Begriffe wie Unverträglichkeit und
vollständige Disjunktivität von 𝑛Aussagen u. a. m. in seine Theorie einordnen.
Regarding the general trend present here, cp. the review of an earlier work by the
author ⟨Ackermann, 1948; this volume, § 13.1⟩. New basic rules for the deducibility
of 𝑏from 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are here postulated, and those used in the previous articles are
proven from them. The author furthermore shows how certain universal concepts
of the theory of deduction such as incompatibility and complete disjunctivity of 𝑛
propositions, among others, fit into his theory.

Verf. setzt hier seine metalogische Untersuchung der Aussageverknüpfungen ⟨Acker-
mann 1948; dieser Band, § 13.1⟩fort, indem er die klassische und die intuitionistische
Negation unter diesem Gesichtspunkt betrachtet. Die intuitionistische Negation

13 Reviews of Popper’s Articles on Logic
223
von 𝑏wird als die schwächste der Aussagen definiert, die stark genug sind, 𝑏zu
widersprechen. Die klassische Negation von 𝑏wird definiert als diejenige Aussage,
die zu 𝑏gleichzeitig kontradiktorisch und komplementär ist. Ausgehend von diesen
Definitionen wird das Verhältnis der beiden Negationen zueinander näher beleuchtet.
Interessant ist, daß die Negation im intuitionistischen Minimalkalkül von Johansson
sich nicht mit den benutzten Mitteln definieren lässt.
The author continues his metalogical investigation of the propositional connectives
⟨Ackermann, 1948; this volume, § 13.1⟩by considering classical and intuitionistic
negation from this point of view. The intuitionistic negation of 𝑏is defined as the
weakest proposition strong enough to contradict 𝑏. The classical negation of 𝑏is
defined as the proposition which is at the same time contradictory and complementary
to 𝑏. Starting from these definitions the relation of the two negations is examined
more closely. It is interesting that the negation of the intuitionistic minimal calculus
of Johansson cannot be defined with the means being used.
13.4 Beth (1948): Review of “New Foundations for Logic” (Popper,
1947c)
This is an exposition, by means of successive tentatives, of a theory of inference which
reminds one of the systems given by G. Gentzen, S. Jaśkowski, and O. Ketonen, but is
also influenced by Tarski’s well-known work on the concept of logical consequence.
This theory is not dependent on logical axioms; the difficulty, mentioned by Tarski,
of distinguishing between formative (or logical) and descriptive (or extra-logical)
signs, is removed. An inference is called valid if every interpretation which makes
the premises true also makes the conclusion true; we can also say: an inference is
valid if no counter-example exists. The expression “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” is used in order to
express the assertion: “From the statements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, the statement 𝑏can be
derived.” The notion of mutual deducibility can be defined as follows: “𝑎//𝑏if, and
only if, 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎.”
A number of valid rules of inference are mentioned. The system consisting of the
rules “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)” and
“if


𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1
and 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏2



and if 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐, then 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐”
as well as some other systems, is sufficient as a basis for the construction of proposi-
tional and functional logic.
The logic of compound statements is based on a number of primitive rules of
derivation. Conjunction, for instance, is characterized by the rule “𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐if, and only
if, 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐.” It may, however, also be introduced by means of the explicit definition

224
Ackermann, Beth, Curry, Hasenjaeger, Kemeny, Kleene, McKinsey, and Nagel
“𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐if, and only if, for any 𝑐1 : 𝑎/𝑐1 if and only if 𝑏∧𝑐/𝑐1.” The theory of
quantification is said to be too subtle to be analysed in detail in this paper. A more
systematic and more complete exposition of the system is to be given elsewhere. The
paper concludes by some considerations on derivation and demonstration and on
metalanguage and object language.
13.5 Curry (1948a): Review of “Functional Logic without Axioms
or Primitive Rules of Inference” (Popper, 1947d)
In an earlier paper ⟨Popper, 1947c; this volume, § 13.4⟩the author proposed a
formulation forlogical calculus in which the fundamental relation is one of deducibility
expressed by “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏.” This relation is similar to one postulated by P. Hertz
⟨1929b⟩and used by Gentzen ⟨1935a; 1935b⟩in his system LJ. Popper proposed in
that paper two “bases” for his formulation, called basis I and basis II, respectively.
Basis I is similar to that of Hertz; its rules Rg and Tg are the rules stated, in that
order, in the cited review. Basis II postulates Tg for the case 𝑚= 1 only, but requires
that there be an operation of conjunction, expressed by “𝑎∧𝑏” and a rule Cg:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏∧𝑐↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐.a His contention is that basis I
can be derived from basis II. The operations formalizing the logical connectives are
introduced on basis I by rules which have, in interpretation at least, the character
of definitions. In the present paper these “metalinguistic inferential definitions” are
restated so as to incorporate in them the rules of basis II. Of course the “definitions”
are not definitions in the usual sense, and the device is at best only a technical
subterfuge. But any interest it may have is destroyed by the fact that the contention
above mentioned is false. Counterexample: let the 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏be rational integers,
𝑏∧𝑐be the lesser of 𝑏and 𝑐, and let “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” mean that the minimum of
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is less than or equal to 𝑏+ 𝑛−1; then the rules of basis II are satisfied,
but Tg fails for 𝑎= 𝑏1 = 𝑏2 = 1, 𝑐= 0.
In view of this and other errors in the previous paper, conclusions based on it must
be received with caution. Presumably the author’s ideas can be carried through, at
least in principle (the chief doubts relate to variables and quantifiers), for basis I. If the
object is to simplify the rule Tg, Gentzen’s “Hauptsatz” goes further in this direction
than the author’s basis II. The paper closes with a statement of possible definitions
for modal functions. These require the use of a disjunction in the “metalanguage.”

13.6 Curry (1948b): Review of “Logic without Assumptions”
(Popper, 1947b)
This paper discusses the philosophical background of the author’s inferential formu-
lation of the logic of propositions and predicates. ⟨See Popper, 1947c,d, 1948e =
Popper, 1947e; reviews § 13.4 and § 13.5, this volume; cf. also the papers reviewed
below in §§ 13.7–13.9⟩.
It contains no mathematical results; but it throws light on the motivation of the
author’s other papers. The major point is that logic deals with formative signs, and
the latter should be definable in terms of pure deducibility.
13.7 Curry (1948c): Review of “On the Theory of Deduction,
Part I” (Popper, 1948a)
In this paper the author revises the system of inferential propositional logic in his
previous papers ⟨cited in the preceding review, § 13.6, this volume; Curry, 1948b⟩.
The principal innovations are as follows.
(1)b He derives the principle Tg from Gentzen’s elimination rule (Schnitt) without
mentioning that Gentzen ⟨1932, in particular, p. 332⟩did this. Aside from certain
idiosyncrasies of the author’s formulation, the resulting basis, called basis I, differs
from Gentzen’s [loc. cit.; or that formed by only the “Struktur-Schluss Figuren” of
⟨Gentzen, 1935a⟩, in particular, p. 192] chiefly in that Gentzen’s rule of commutation
[Vertauschung in loc. cit. 1934; tacit in loc. cit. 1932] is replaced by more specific
assumptions.
(2) He remarks that the change in (1) removes the need for basis II, and that his
“basic definitions” can be formulated on basis I. Nevertheless he claims basis II has
some interest in its own right and makes some minor improvements in it; but he
does not correct the error mentioned in the review of the second of his papers quoted
above.
(3) He introduces Gentzen’s [loc. cit. 1934] sequences with multiple consequents
(along with some related notions), essentially by the definition
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑚/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑢↔(𝑐)(𝑏1/𝑐& . . . & 𝑏𝑢/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑚/𝑐).
Here “(𝑐)” indicates universal quantification, “→” implication and “&” conjunction
on the metalinguistic level: such notions are characteristic of the author’s work. The
principal difference between the resulting system and that of Gentzen [loc. cit. 1934]
is that the “Logische-Zeichen-Schluss Figuren” are replaced by quasi-definitions of
which the following variants of essentially the same example are typical:
b We have replaced ⇆by ↔, square brackets by parentheses, | and || by / and //, as well as ⊃by
>, respectively.

Ackermann, Beth, Curry, Hasenjaeger, Kemeny, Kleene, McKinsey, and Nagel
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐,
𝑎//𝑏> 𝑐↔(𝑑)(𝑑/𝑎↔𝑑, 𝑏/𝑐).
Here “//” indicates a kind of equivalence. The system lacks the noneliminative
character which leads to Gentzen’s Hauptsatz. There may well be other, less obvious
differences also.
13.8 Curry (1948d): Review of “On the Theory of Deduction,
Part II” (Popper, 1948c)
This is an analysis of negation on the basis of the author’s paper reviewed above
⟨Curry, 1948c; this volume, § 13.7⟩. The author considers 6 kinds of negation, viz.,
𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑚, 𝑎𝑘, 𝑎𝑗, 𝑎𝑙, 𝑎𝑢, with properties as follows:
𝑎⊢𝑏𝑖↔𝑎, 𝑏⊢;
𝑎𝑚⊢𝑏↔⊢𝑎, 𝑏;
𝑎, 𝑎𝑘⊢& ⊢𝑎, 𝑎𝑘;
𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐𝑗→𝑎, 𝑐⊢𝑏𝑗;
𝑎, 𝑏𝑙⊢𝑐→𝑎, 𝑐𝑙⊢𝑏;
𝑎, 𝑏⊢𝑐→𝑎, 𝑐𝑛⊢𝑏𝑛;
of these 𝑎𝑖is intuitionist negation, 𝑎𝑚is a form of complementation dual to 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑘
is classical negation, 𝑎𝑗is the minimal negation of ⟨Johansson, 1937⟩, 𝑎𝑙its dualc,
and 𝑎𝑢a still weaker form. Of the six, the postulates for 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑚, 𝑎𝑘determine them
uniquely if they exist (so that these postulates are quasi-definitions), while for the last
three this is not the case. The author argues from this, on the basis of the philosophy
in the paper of the second preceding review ⟨Curry, 1948b; this volume, § 13.6⟩, that
these are not “formative signs” and therefore not strictly logical. Also if 𝑎𝑘exists
in any language, then 𝑎𝑖= 𝑎𝑚= 𝑎𝑘; but the author uses three-valued logic as an
example to show that 𝑎𝑖and 𝑎𝑚may both exist without there being an 𝑎𝑘. Various
alternative quasi-definitions for 𝑎𝑘are considered; also connections with a modal
notion of impossibility. At the close there are remarks concerning the existential
character of assumptions in regard to negation.
13.9 Curry (1949): Review of “The Trivialization of Mathematical
Logic” (Popper, 1949a)
This is a summary, without proofs or even the details of certain definitions, of the
author’s program for deriving the whole of mathematical logic from definitions of
the “formati⟨ve⟩signs.” Parts of this program have appeared previously ⟨Popper,
1947b,c,d, 1948a,c,e = Popper, 1947e, 1948b,d; reviews § 13.4, § 13.6, § 13.5, § 13.7
and § 13.8, this volume⟩; this paper appears to go beyond the previous papers only in
c The negation 𝑎𝑙is not the dual of 𝑎𝑗, cp. Binder and Piecha, 2017.

227
certain minor points regarding identity and Aristotelian logic. The whole program is
very obscure, and has not been without serious error ⟨cf. review § 13.5, this volume;
Curry, 1948a⟩; likewise it was anticipated, in many respects, by the work of Gentzen
and others [cf. cited reviews].
13.10 Hasenjaeger (1949): Review of “The Trivialization of
Mathematical Logic” (Popper, 1949a)
Verf. kritisiert die Tragweite und die Angemessenheit der klassischen Matrizen-
Methode und skizziert einen Aufbau der mathematischen Logik, der mit Gentzens
Kalkülen LJ und LK ⟨Schmidt, 1935⟩verwandt ist. Abweichungen: An Stelle des Se-
quenzenzeichens „→“ tritt ein metalogischer Grundbegriff, der manchmal syntaktisch
und manchmal semantisch interpretiert wird, ohne daß diese Interpretationen ge-
trennt werden. Die Schlußfiguren werden als Gebrauchsdefinitionen für die logischen
Verknüpfungen aufgefaßt und gewinnen dadurch den Charakter von metalogischen
Existenzaxiomen, was Verf. anscheinend übersieht. Vgl. auch ⟨Ackermann, 1948,
1949a,b; dieser Band, § 13.1, § 13.2, § 13.3⟩. Inwiefern damit eine „Trivialisierung“
erreicht wird, ist nicht klar ersichtlich.
The author criticizes the scope and the adequacy of the classical matrix method
and sketches a construction of mathematical logic which is related to Gentzen’s
calculi LJ and LK ⟨Schmidt, 1935⟩. Differences are as follows: The place of the
sequent sign “→” is taken by a metalogical basic concept which is sometimes
interpreted syntactically and sometimes semantically, without those interpretations
being separated. The derivation rules are considered to be contextual definitions
⟨“Gebrauchsdefinitionen”⟩for the logical connectives and thereby obtain the status
of metalogical existence axioms, which the author apparently overlooks. Cp. also
⟨Ackermann, 1948, 1949a,b; this volume, § 13.1, § 13.2, § 13.3⟩. It is not obvious to
what extent this achieves a “trivialization”.
13.11 Kemeny (1957): Review of “A Note on Tarski’s Definition of
Truth” (Popper, 1955a)
The author considers Tarski’s concept of the fulfilment of a statement-function by a
sequence. In Tarski’s definition of truth ⟨Tarski, 1935a⟩this relation is defined with
respect to an infinite sequence. This is necessary to assure that there be an element
in the sequence for every variable that may occur in the statement-function. Popper
wishes to define fulfilment (or satisfaction) by means of finite sequences. Tarski
himself suggests such a procedure, but his method of using sequences of exactly the
right length leads to certain artificiality in the resulting definitions. Popper sketches a

228
Ackermann, Beth, Curry, Hasenjaeger, Kemeny, Kleene, McKinsey, and Nagel
new definition in which statement-functions are fulfilled by “sufficiently long” finite
sequences. It is clear that having sequences which are too long causes no difficulty;
one must simply assure that an assignment is available for every free variable, and
then all extensions of a sufficiently long sequence will yield the same results. The
author states that his procedure is only a slight modification of Tarski’s, but one that
leads to an attractive reformulation of definitions. The reviewer concurs with this
evaluation.
13.12 Kleene (1948): Review of “Functional Logic without Axioms
or Primitive Rules of Inference” (Popper, 1947d)
The customary systems of restricted predicate calculus, as the author puts it, proceed
by laying down (a) undefined primitive formative signs (e.g., “&”, “⊃”, “∀𝑥”), (b)
unproved primitive propositions or axioms, (c) primitive rules of inference for the
formative signs (e.g., modus ponens for “⊃”), and (d) some further very general
primitive rules of inference (e.g., that the inference relation is transitive). He claims
to show that, if we have at our disposal the metalinguistic notion of deducibility,
then none of (a)–(d) need be laid down, and the whole formal structure of logic
can be obtained by way of explicit definitions in terms of deducibility (“inferential
definitions”). (In his previous papers ⟨see McKinsey, 1948; this volume, § 13.14⟩he
supposedly gets rid of (a)–(c); in the present one, of (d) also.)
It seems to this reviewer that his claim entails confusions. Instead of defining,
e.g., conjunction, Popper defines the “logical force” of conjunction, by a definition of
the form “𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐↔the definiens” where “//” expresses interdeducibility. But he
substitutes “𝑏∧𝑐” for “𝑎” (in obtaining 5.03 or 5.20 on ⟨p. 158⟩), where “𝑎” is a
variable which ranges over the statements of the object language ⟨p. 155⟩. Thus, to
develop his definitions, we seem to require his postulate (P2) asserting the existence
of a conjunctive expression, which he apparently intended only for the application of
his system to some object language 𝐿⟨p. 162⟩. This is perhaps a minor point; but the
following and the point raised by the previous reviewer seem crucial.
After defining “⊢𝑎”, he states that, whenever a sentence, such as “𝑝⊃𝑝”, is
provable in the usual systems, then his corresponding formula, in this case “⊢𝑎> 𝑎”,
can be obtained in his metalinguistic system, by using only his definitions. “Whenever
the formula in question is intuitionistically valid, it is only necessary to use, besides
Basic Definitions, the definitions of the symbols actually occuring in the formula.
If it is intuitionistically invalid but classically valid, then, even if no symbol of
negation occurs in the formula, D5, the definition of classical negation, is needed for
establishing its demonstrability.” ⟨p. 162⟩. If his definitions were “explicit,” as he
claims, it should make no difference whatsoever, in the case of a formula containing
only “>”, whether or not the definition of classical negation has been stated. Thus
evidently the formal structure of logic is not characterized by his definitions simply as
explicit definitions. It is fully characterized only when his definitions and his methods
of “obtaining” other metalinguistic formulas from them are combined as an inductive

definition (or a definition by recursions and an existential quantifier) of the notion of
“obtainability” in his metalinguistic system. To do this is to employ, in establishing
his system, the ordinary methods, which his system is intended to supplant.
13.13 Kleene (1949): Review of “On the Theory of Deduction, Part
I & II” and “The Trivialization of Mathematical Logic”
(Popper, 1948a,c, 1949a)
These papersd deal with the same ideas as ⟨McKinsey, 1948; this volume, § 13.14⟩
and ⟨Kleene, 1948; this volume, § 13.12⟩. As was pointed out in the first of these
reviews, there seem to be at the root of Popper’s investigations some new results
on systems of logic of the type of Gentzen’s LJ and LK ⟨Gentzen, 1935a,b⟩. These
new results are apparently of some interest, e.g. those on six kinds of negation in the
second of the present papers. Unfortunately it is not easy to get at exactly what the
results are in these terms, because of technical errors in at least some of Popper’s
papers (as noted by Curry in ⟨1948a; this volume, § 13.5⟩), and because the results are
entangled in Popper’s claims to be giving a new kind of foundation for mathematical
logic, in which the whole of it becomes obtainable from definitions of the formative
signs in terms of the idea of deducibility. While it is quite unclear to the reviewer how
Popper’s “definitions” can be interpreted so as to sustain his claims (cf. the reviews
⟨§ 13.14 and ⟨§ 13.12, this volume⟩; Kleene, 1948; McKinsey, 1948⟩), it seems quite
clear (despite Popper’s uncertainty, in footnote 7 of the first of the present papers)
what Gentzen is doing. Gentzen’s “→” is the name of an object-linguistic symbol (or
the symbol itself used autonymously). His horizontal stroke is a device to show the
articulation of the sequences in a proof-figure, quite on a par with the vertical and
slant lines in ⟨Hilbert and Bernays, 1934⟩(p. 223, the lower figure).
13.14 McKinsey (1948): Review of “Logic without Assumptions”
and “New Foundations for Logic” (Popper, 1947b,c)
Since these two papers are concerned with two phases of the same study, they are
reviewed together. The first paper is a somewhat popular presentation of ideas which
are presented in a more technically developed form in the second.
The problem dealt with, is that of defining valid deductive inference. After some
preliminary discussion, the author is led to define a valid inference as one such
that “every form-preserving interpretation of it whose premises are all true has a
true conclusion.” (As the author points out, this definition is rather similar to one
previously given by Tarski.) By a “form-preserving interpretation” is here meant a

translation of sentences which preserves the meaning of the logical terms (the author
calls them “formative terms”).
Since this definition depends on the notion of “logical terms,” the author attempts
to supply a precise definition of this rather vague notion. It appears to the reviewer
that (aside from the purely technical contribution, in the second paper, of a new
formulation, in the manner of Gentzen, of the restricted predicate calculus) this
attempt at a precise definition of logical terms constitutes the chief claim to originality
of the two papers. Unfortunately, the definition appears to suffer from an error; in
order to make this clear, it is necessary to outline the construction given by the author.
The author begins by defining an absolutely valid inference. An inference is abso-
lutely valid if every transformation of the language which always carries statements
into statements, and which carries the premises into true statements, also carries the
conclusion into a true statement. It is clear, though the author does not explicitly point
this out, that an inference is absolutely valid if and only if the conclusion coincides
with one of the premises.
The author uses the notation
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏
to indicate an inference with premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛and conclusion 𝑏; it is not clear,
however, whether this notation is intended to indicate arbitrary inferences, or is to be
restricted to absolutely valid inferences. The author writes
𝑎//𝑏
as an abbreviation for
𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑎.
In terms of this notation, it is asserted, the sentential connectives and quantifiers
are definable. For instance, the author defines: “𝑎// the disjunction of 𝑏1 and 𝑏2, if,
and only if, for every 𝑐1 and 𝑐2: 𝑎, 𝑐1/𝑐2 if and only if 𝑏1, 𝑐1/𝑐2 and 𝑏2, 𝑐1/𝑐2.”
A definition of the sort just given is called an inferential definition, and the class
of logical signs is defined to consist of those which can be defined by inferential
definitions.
Now this method of defining logical terms appears to the reviewer inadequate
for the following reason. If the sign “/” in inferential definitions is taken to indicate
absolute inferences in the originally defined sense (so that 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏holds if and
only if 𝑏is identical with 𝑎𝑖for some 𝑖) then the inferential definitions do not give the
intended meanings to the symbols introduced by them. Thus, for example, under this
assumption, suppose we take, in the above inferential definition of disjunction, 𝑎, 𝑏1
and 𝑏2 to be all distinct, 𝑐2 to be identical with 𝑎, and 𝑐1 different from 𝑎, 𝑏1, 𝑏2 and 𝑐2;
then 𝑎, 𝑐1/𝑐2 holds, while 𝑏1, 𝑐1/𝑐2 and 𝑏2, 𝑐1/𝑐2 are both false; hence a statement
cannot be equivalent to the disjunction of two statements unless it is identical with
one or the other of them! If, on the other hand, the sign “/” in inferential definitions
is supposed to indicate ordinary inferences, then we seem to be involved in a circle;

for ordinary inferences have not been defined without making use of the notion of
logical terms, and hence cannot reasonably be used in order to define logical terms.
13.15 Nagel (1943): Review of “Are Contradictions Embracing?”
(Popper, 1943)
In a paper on the nature of mathematics ⟨Jeffreys, 1938⟩e Dr. Jeffreys raised the
question whether a contradiction entails every proposition. Dr. Popper subsequently
offered a demonstration that this was indeed the case ⟨Popper, 1940⟩. Dr. Jeffreys
then expressed himself ⟨Jeffreys, 1942⟩as dissatisfied with the proof, on the ground
that it seemed to him circular. Dr. Popper now restates the argument to show that no
circularity is involved, and that the conclusion can be obtained in relatively “weak”
or “rudimentary” systems of material implication.

On Systems of Rules of Inference
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
Abstract This is an unpublished joint work by Paul Bernays and Karl Popper.
Editorial notes: The source typescript can be found in several copies in Popper’s Nachlass, namely
in KPS Box 13, Folder 5 (“Logic Derivations”), KPS Box 14, Folder 8 (“Logic of Negations”) and
KPS Box 36, Folder 13 (“Bernays”). The copy in the latter has handwritten corrections, and we have
used it as a basis for the version presented here. Some corrections, e.g., in the middle of p. 10, may
not be Popper’s but could be by Bernays; however, we are not sure about this. Some rules are marked
with handwritten question marks, which we have omitted here. The typescripts contain footnote
marks, but the footnotes are missing. Footnote mark 1 seems to be missing in the original; the
paper is partly damaged. We indicate each missing footnote by “⟨Footnote missing⟩”. The original
typescript has neither a date nor a title, but Popper suggests in a letter to Bernays of 3 March 1947
(this volume, § 21.3) to call it “On Systems of Rules of Inference”. We are not sure whether “On
Systems of Rules of Inference” was written before, after or at the same time as Popper’s unpublished
manuscript “A General Theory of Inference” (this volume, Chapter 15). The typescript uses the
combined symbols /−and /−, which we replaced by ⊢and
, respectively. We write 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛(with
two commas) instead of 𝑎1, . . . 𝑎𝑛throughout. In our transcription we use Ô and ∨instead of “V”
and “v” for metalinguistic and objectlinguistic disjunction, respectively. The page numbers in the
left margins refer to the original typescript. The term “minimum calculus” refers to Johansson’s
(1937) “Minimalkalkül”. Rule (5.2X) is Peirce’s rule.

The individuals which constitute the universe of discourse of this investigation are
statements of some object language or other. Since our investigation proceeds entirely
in the metalanguage (or meta-metalanguage, etc.), and no signs of any object language
are to be quoted, we can dispense with gothic letters; and we use lower case italics
from the beginning of the alphabet (as a rule with numerical subscripts) as individual
variables.

𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0
is used to express the assertion that the statement 𝑎0 is a conclusion which can be
validly inferred from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. A formula like (1) is called a “rule
of inference”.
We shall use, in the metalanguage (but not in the meta-metalanguage, etc.), merely
for purposes of abbreviation, the notation of Hilbert and Bernays’ functional calculus,
with the exception that we use “↔” (instead of “∼”) as an abbreviation of the phrase
“if and only if”.
2. General Theory. Primitive Rules
It is usually assumed that inference is transitive; reflexive; that (since their order is
irrelevant) a reversion of the order of the premises does not invalidate it; and that the
same holds if we add some new premise to the old ones. We can express this in the
following System of Primitive Rules, for which we claim independence: |
2
First System (four rules):
((𝑖)1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏𝑖) →(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐)
(2.11)
𝑎/𝑎
(2.12)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1/𝑎0
(2.13)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑎0
(2.14)
For the proof of independence, the following numerical models can be used:
2.11: interpret (1): “𝑎0 ≤𝑎1 + 1 Ô 𝑎0 ≤𝑎2 + 1 . . .”; put 𝑎1 = 𝑎2 = . . . = 𝑎𝑛;
𝑏1 = 𝑏2 = . . . = 𝑏𝑚= 𝑎1 + 1; 𝑐= 𝑎1 + 2.a – 2.12: interpret (1): “𝑎0 > 𝑎1
Ô 𝑎0 >
𝑎2 . . .”. – 2.13: interpret (1): “𝑎0 = 𝑎1”; put 𝑎0 = 𝑎1 ≠𝑎𝑛. – 2.14: interpret (1):
“𝑎0 = 𝑎1
Ô 𝑎0 = 𝑎𝑛”; put 𝑎0 = 𝑎𝑛≠𝑎𝑛+1 = 𝑎1. –
(Note: The system remains independent if we replace 2.12 by the stronger formula
2.22; use the same interpretation, and put 𝑎1 = 𝑎2 = . . . = 𝑎𝑛> 𝑎0.)
The system of primitive rules is equivalent to the following two systems:
Second System (three rules):
the same as 2.11
(2.21)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1
(2.22)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎0 →𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎0
(0 ≤𝑚< 𝑛+ 𝑚)
(2.23)
(Rule 2.23 allows us to arrange the premises into any order we like.)
Third System (two rules):
a We have corrected 𝑏𝑛to 𝑏𝑚.

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
239
the same as 2.11
(2.31)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)
(2.32)
An alternative way of writing 2.32 is:
𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎1
(0 ≤𝑚< 𝑛+ 𝑚)
(2.321)
|
3
The independence of these systems can be shown by using the corresponding
interpretations given for the first system; besides, the interpretation given for 2.14
can be used for 2.23 and 2.32, and that given for 2.13 for 2.32. – To show that 2.22
cannot be replaced by 2.12, interpret (1): “𝑎0 = 𝑎1 = 𝑎2 = . . . = 𝑎𝑛”; put the last
premise ≠𝑎0.
The proof of the equivalence of the three sets is facilitated by first deriving the
following rules 2.4 and 2.5 from the first system:
(2.4)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎0
Proof from 2.14, by induction with respect to 𝑚. (We show first that, by 2.14, if
2.4 holds for some 𝑚, it also holds for 𝑚+ 1; and we show next that, by 2.14, it holds
for 𝑚= 1.)
(2.5)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑎𝑛, . . . , 𝑎1, 𝑎𝑛+1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎0
Proof from 2.13 and 2.4, 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑛−𝑖(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛). (“𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑛−𝑖” means: “substitute (in
2.4) 𝑎𝑛−𝑖for (all the occurrences of) 𝑎𝑖.”)
We can now easily show the equivalence of the three sets by showing that the first
(i) and the second (ii) are equivalent to the third (iii):
(i)/(iii) We first show that 2.22 can be derived in (i) (and that it is therefore
equivalent to 2.12 in (i), since 2.12 from 2.22 by 𝑛= 1): 2.22 from 2.4, 𝑛= 1, 𝑛+𝑚𝑛,
𝑎0 𝑎1, and 2.12. – Now 2.321 from 2.5, 𝑎0 𝑎1, and 2.22.
(iii)/(i) 2.12 from 2.321, 𝑛= 1; 𝑚= 0. – 2.13 from 2.31, 𝑚= 𝑛, 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖; 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑛−𝑖;
𝑐𝑎0; //3.12. (“//. . .” means: “apply to foregoing modus ponens with . . . as second
premise.”) – 2.14 from 2.31, 𝑚𝑛; 𝑛𝑛+ 1; 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖; //2.32, 𝑛𝑚+ 1.
(ii)/(iii) 2.321 from 2.23, 𝑎0 𝑎1; //2.22, 𝑛𝑛+ 𝑚.
(iii)/(ii) 2.22 from 2.32, 𝑎𝑖𝑎1. – 3.23 from 3.31, 𝑚𝑛+ 𝑚; 𝑛𝑛+ 𝑚; 𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑖; and
for 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚, 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑚−𝑖; //2.32, 𝑛𝑛+ 𝑚. –
This completes the proof of equivalence.
Some further rules may be deduced: |

(Omitting redundant premises:)
(2.6)
𝑎𝑛= 𝑎𝑛+1 →(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+1/𝑎0 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0)
Proof: from 2.11 and 2.32.

A more general form of 2.6 is:
(𝑛+ 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛+ 𝑚→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎𝑖) →(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛+𝑚/𝑎0 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0)
(2.7)
Proof: as above.
(Contraction:)
(2.8)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏0 & 𝑏0, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐) →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐.
Proof: as above.
The rule of transitivity 2.11, gives rise to several important rules for transforming
conditional rules of inference:
(Weakening the premises of the antecedent:)b
(2.91)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0) →((1 ≤𝑖≤𝑟→𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐𝑖)
→(𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑟/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0))
Proof: 2.11, 𝑚𝑟; 𝑏𝑖𝑐𝑖; 𝑐𝑎0; transitivity of “→”.
(Strengthening the premises of the consequent:)
(2.92)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0) →((1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚→𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑟/𝑏𝑖)
→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑐1, . . . , 𝑐𝑟/𝑏0))
Proof: 2.11, 𝑛𝑟; 𝑎𝑖𝑐𝑖; 𝑐𝑏0; transitivity of “→”.
(Strengthening the conclusion of the antecedent:)
(2.93)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0)
→(𝑐/𝑎0 →(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑐→𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0))
Proof: 2.11, 𝑚= 1; 𝑏1 = 𝑏𝑚𝑐; 𝑐𝑎0; change order of antecedents; transitivity of
“→”.
(Weakening the conclusion of the consequent:)
(2.94)
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑏0)
→(𝑏0/𝑐→(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0 →𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚/𝑐))
Proof: ⟨2.11⟩, 𝑛𝑚; 𝑚= 1; 𝑎𝑖𝑏𝑖; 𝑏1 = 𝑏𝑚𝑐; transitivity of “→” (in the form
“(𝐵𝐶→(𝐶→𝐵𝐶)) →((𝐴→𝐵𝐶) →(𝐶→(𝐴→𝐵𝐶)))”).
b (2.91) and (2.92) should have an (𝑖) before 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑟and 1 ≤𝑖≤𝑚, respectively, as in 2.11.

3. Relation between this Method and that of Consequence Classes
We can restate the two rules which constitute our third system in the following way:
(3.1) Provided all the elements of the class of premises 𝑋are derivable from the class
of premises 𝑌, any conclusion 𝑐which is derivable from 𝑋is also derivable
from 𝑌.
(3.2) Any sentence 𝑎𝑖that belongs to the class of premises 𝑋also belongs to the
conclusions which are derivable from the class of premises 𝑋.
We now use the ordinary notation of the class calculus, and, furthermore, we write
“𝐶(𝑋)” for “the class of conclusions derivable from the class of premises 𝑋”. (We
shall call 𝐶(𝑋) “the consequence class of 𝑋” or “the content of 𝑋”.) Then we can
rewrite 3.1 and 3.2:
𝑋⊂𝐶(𝑌) →𝐶(𝑋) ⊂𝐶(𝑌)
(3.1+)
𝑋⊂𝐶(𝑋)
(3.2+)
The first of these formulae, in the presence of the second, is equivalent to the
following two formulae:
𝑋= 𝐶(𝑌) →𝐶(𝑋) ⊂𝐶(𝑌)
(3.11)
𝑋⊂𝑌→𝐶(𝑋) ⊂𝐶(𝑌)
(3.12)
|
5
Proof: 3.11 from 3.1+ by strengthening antecedent. – 3.12 from the trivial formula
“𝑌⊂𝐶(𝑌) →(𝑋⊂𝑌→𝑋⊂𝐶(𝑌))”, //3.2+, 𝑋𝑌; combine result with 3.1+. –
Vice versa, 3.1+ from 3.12, 𝑌𝐶(𝑌), together with the formula “𝐶(𝐶(𝑌)) ⊂𝐶(𝑌)”,
obtainable from 3.11, 𝑋𝐶(𝑌).
The two formulae 3.11 and 3.12, in turn, are equivalent, respectively, to the
following two formulae:
𝐶(𝐶(𝑋)) ⊂𝐶(𝑋)
(3.11+)
∑︁
𝑋𝑖⊂𝑌
𝐶(𝑋𝑖) = 𝐶(𝑌)
(3.12+)
Proof: 3.11+ from 3.11, 𝑋𝐶(𝑌), afterwards 𝑌𝑋. – 3.12+ with “⊂” follows
immediately from 3.12; the equality follows from the fact than one of the 𝑋𝑖will
be equal to 𝑌. – Vice versa, 3.12 from 3.12+ with the help of the trivial formula
“𝐶(𝑋𝑖) ⊂Í 𝐶(𝑋𝑖)”. – 3.11 from 3.11+, 𝑋𝑌, together with the trivial formula
“𝑋= 𝑍→𝐶(𝑋) = 𝐶(𝑍)”, 𝑍𝐶(𝑌). –
The system consisting of the last two formulae and 3.2+ can now be readily
compared with the system of five axioms given by Tarski2 in 1930c as the basis of his
2 ⟨Footnote missing⟩
c Cf. Tarski (1930b).

242
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
theory of metamathematics. Tarski uses two fundamental concepts, “𝑆”, designing
the class of all statements (of the objectlanguage under consideration), and “𝐶(𝑋)”,
designating the consequence class of 𝑋. His five axioms are, in our notation, (“𝑋”
designates the cardinal number of 𝑋):
𝑆= ℵ0
Axiom 1.
𝑋⊂𝑆→𝑋⊂𝐶(𝑋) ⊂𝑆
Axiom 2.
𝑋⊂𝑆→𝐶(𝐶(𝑋)) = 𝐶(𝑋)
Axiom 3.
𝑋⊂𝑆→𝐶(𝑋) =
∑︁
𝑌𝑖⊂𝑋
𝐶(𝑌𝑖)
(𝑌𝑖< ℵ0)
Axiom 4.
(𝐸𝑎)(𝑎∈𝑆& 𝐶({𝑎}) = 𝑆).
Axiom 5.
Tarski’s explicit references to 𝑆can be omitted, from our point of view, since we
have stated that the elements of our universe of discourse are the statements of some
object language. |
6
Similarly, the condition, in Tarski’s axiom 4, that 𝑌𝑖< ℵ0d (i.e. that
the premise classes 𝑌𝑖must be finite) is implicitly realized by our way of writing the
premise classes “𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛”, etc. If we, therefore, omit Tarski’s references to 𝑆and
to finitude (and replace “=” in Tarski’s axiom 3 by “⊂”, which does not change his
system in view of Tarski’s axiom 2), then we find that Tarski’s axiom 1 disappears,
that his 2 becomes our 3.2+, his 3 our 3.11+, and his 4 our 3.12+. In other words, each
of our three systems in section 2 can be considered as equivalent with the system of
the first four of Tarski’s axioms.
Concerning his axiom 5, this is not generally valid for all object languages;
especially if we consider object languages which either do not contain negation or
conjunction (or neither of these), then axiom 5 will not, in general, be satisfied. It
has, admittedly, the advantage of excluding certain undesirable interpretations of the
system, for example the trivial interpretation which makes “𝐶(𝑋)” another way of
writing “𝑋”. But in order to exclude this interpretation (except in case that 𝑆is so
chosen that, for all 𝑋and 𝑌, 𝑋⊂𝑌or 𝑌⊂𝑋), it is sufficient to add the following
axiom to Tarski’s set (we omit the hypothesis “𝑋⊂𝑆& 𝑌⊂𝑆→”):
(3.3)
𝐶(𝑋+ 𝑌) ⊂𝐶(𝑋) + 𝐶(𝑌) →𝑋⊂𝐶(𝑌) Ô 𝑌⊂𝐶(𝑋)
This is independent of the others. (Interpret 𝐶(𝑋) as the class of all numbers from
the smallest to the greatest number in the class 𝑋, as long as the latter number does
not exceed 3; otherwise, as the class of all numbers up to and including the greatest
number in 𝑋; and put 𝑋= {1, 2}, 𝑌= {2, 3}; then 3.3 is not satisfied, but Tarski’s
axioms are, including axiom 5, if we put 4 ≤𝑎= 𝑆≤ℵ0.) It imposes a limitation
on the object language, but it does not appear to narrow the range of admissible
object languages quite as much as axiom 5. (It postulates that something resembling
conjunction must exist in the object language provided it possesses sentences which
d We have corrected 𝑌𝑖< ℵ0 to 𝑌𝑖< ℵ0.

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
243
are neither provable nor refutable; but it does not, |
7
as does axiom 5, postulate that
something like negation exists in the object language.)
There are, of course, other undesirable interpretations which we might wish to
exclude, especially an interpretation which identifies 𝐶(𝑋) with 𝑆; this is not excluded
by Tarski’s set, but may be excluded by adopting, for example
(3.4)
(𝐸𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝑎∉𝐶({𝑏}))
which does not narrow the field of admissible object languages, or
(3.5)
(𝐸𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝑎∉𝐶({𝑏}) & 𝑏∉𝐶({𝑎}))
which amounts to postulating that the object language should contain at least two
different statements which are both neither consequences of the zero class of premises
nor “comprehensive”3 or “embracing”4 – for example, some factual sentence and its
negation.
The possibility that these two sentences are, in this way, contradictory to each
other, may be easily excluded by replacing 3.5 by
(3.51)
(𝐸𝑎)(𝐸𝑏)(𝐸𝑐)(𝑎∉𝐶({𝑏}) & 𝑏∉𝐶({𝑎}) & 𝑐∉𝐶({𝑎, 𝑏})).
It is easy to devise existential formulae postulating the existence of any number
(even of an infinite number) of mutually independent statements, excluding at the
same time undesirable interpretations of 𝐶(𝑋).
In considering more specified languages, in the next section, we shall assume
something similar to Tarski’s axiom 5 (see 4.0 f and 4.0
), but together with its dual
assumption (see 4.0 t and 4.0 ⊢). The function of these assumptions will be, explicitly,
to help us to characterize negation.
4. Primitive Rules for Propositional Logic
Returning to the method of treating inference introduced in sections 1 and 2, we
now propose to consider object languages which contain, with every sentence 𝑎, and
with every pair of sentences 𝑎and 𝑏, also one or the other or all of the following
sentences 𝑐1 to 𝑐6: one sentence 𝑐1 = ¬(𝑎); one sentence 𝑐2 = ⊃(𝑎, 𝑏); one sentence
𝑐3 = ≡(𝑎, 𝑏); one sentence 𝑐4 = .(𝑎, 𝑏); and one sentence 𝑐5 = ∨(𝑎, 𝑏). (In other
words, we assume that certain functions of one or two variables can be defined in our
universe of discourse, so that the values of the functions as well as of their variables
are statements.) We shall, as usual, write, in order to save brackets, “¬𝑎”; “𝑎⊃𝑏”;
“𝑎≡𝑏”; “𝑎. 𝑏”; and “𝑎∨𝑏”; and we shall indicate the structure of more complex
compounds in the usual way by brackets. Also, we shall call ¬𝑎; 𝑎⊃𝑏; 𝑎≡𝑏; etc.,
3 ⟨Footnote missing⟩
4 ⟨Footnote missing⟩

244
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
“the negation of 𝑎”; “the conditional of 𝑎and 𝑏”; “the biconditional of 𝑎and 𝑏”,
etc.; and we shall call all these statements “compounds”, and we shall say “𝑎is a
component of the compound ¬𝑎”, etc.
We propose to characterize the logical properties of compound statements by the
method of laying down, for each separately, primitive rules of inference. (Each of
these rules determines the deductive power, as it were, of the compound that occurs
in it.)
Tarski, in his paper quoted above, has adopted a procedure analogous to that we
propose to adopt, by laying down, in his axiom 6∗that 𝑆contains with every element
𝑎an element ¬(𝑎), and with every pair of elements 𝑎, 𝑏, an element ⊃(𝑎, 𝑏), and
he characterises the properties of these compounds by way of his axioms 7∗and
8∗(conditional) and 9∗and 10∗(negation). His axioms for the conditional can be
transcribed into our notation without difficulty (see the rule 4.2 below). His axioms
for negation, however, make essential use of 𝑆, and of 𝐶(0), i.e. the consequence
class of the zero class of premises. They amount to postulating (9∗) that, from the two
premises 𝑎and ¬𝑎, every element of 𝑆can be deduced; and (10∗) that, if 𝑏can be
deduced from 𝑎as well as from ¬𝑎, then 𝑏follows from the zero class of premises
(and therefore from any class of premises). If we assume |
9
that 𝑆contains at least
one true and at least one false statement, then we may say that the force of (9∗) is
that, from the premises 𝑎, ¬𝑎, at least one false statement follows, and the force of
(10∗) that, if 𝑏follows from 𝑎and from ¬𝑎, then 𝑏follows from a true statement.
One method of transcribing this into our way of writing is this: we assume that our
metalanguage contains, apart from variables whose values are statements, also two
constant names of statements, say “t” and “f”, and that the statement t is logically
true and the statement f logically false; and by this we mean that the following rules
of inference hold for them:
𝑎/t
(4.0 t)
f/𝑎
(4.0 f)
i.e., t follows from every statement, and from f, every statement follows.
We shall adopt this method in the present section (the next section will proceed
differently), and transcribe Tarski’s two axioms for negation:
𝑎, ¬𝑎/f
(4.02)
𝑎/𝑏& ¬𝑎/𝑏→t/𝑏
(4.11)
In order to achieve symmetry, we replace 4.02 by
(4.12)
𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/¬𝑏→𝑎/f
Using fundamentally the same method, we can formulate 4.11 and 4.12 also in
the following way: we can write “⊢𝑏” instead of “t/𝑏” (“⊢𝑏” may be read: “𝑏is
logically true” or “𝑏is proved” or “𝑏is demonstrable”); and |
10
we can write “
𝑎”
instead of “𝑎/f” (“
𝑎” may be read “𝑎is logically false”, or “𝑎is refutable”). We

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
245
can introduce these two new signs either by an explicit definition, using “t” and “f”,
or by the following rules (which use bound variables) by which we may replace 4.0 t
and 4.0 f:
(Demonstration and Refutation:)
⊢𝑎↔(𝑏) 𝑏/𝑎
(4.0 ⊢)
𝑎↔(𝑏) 𝑎/𝑏
(4.0
)
(These rules have the intended force only if we assume that the language in question
contains at least one true and one false statement.) Using the new symbols, 4.11 and
4.12 can be replaced by the following primitive rules of inference:
(Negation:)
𝑎/𝑏& ¬𝑎/𝑏→⊢𝑏
(4.11+)
𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/¬𝑏→
𝑎
(4.12+)
Proceeding to the rules for conditional compounds, we can transcribe Tarski’s
axioms (8∗) and (7∗) into two conditional rules of inference of which the one is the
converse of the other, and contract them afterwards into one equivalence, viz. into
the following primitive rule of inference:
(Conditional:)
(4.2)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ⊃𝑏2 ↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1/𝑏2
In a precisely analogous way, we now can lay down primitive rules of inference
for the other compounds of two components:
(Bi-Conditional:)
(4.3)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1 ≡𝑏2 ↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1/𝑏2 & 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏2/𝑏1
(Conjunction:)
(4.4)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1 . 𝑏2/𝑐↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1, 𝑏2/𝑐
(Disjunction:)
(4.5)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1 ∨𝑏2/𝑐↔𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1/𝑐& 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏2/𝑐
Rules 4.0 ⊢, 4.0
, 4.11+, 4.12+ (or, alternatively, rules 4.0 t, 4.0 f, 4.11, 4.12)
together with the rules 4.2 to 4.5, and |
11
any of the three sets of section 1, constitute
a complete system of propositional logic, in the sense that (a) any derivation made
possible by the usual systems of propositional logic can be carried out in this system,
and that (b) for any tautology of propositional logic, we can derive, in our system, a
corresponding schema preceded by “⊢”. We shall not, however, prove this assertion

246
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
here, since it follows in a more direct way from the considerations of the next two
sections. It will be proved in section 7.
5. Pure Rules of Derivation
The system of propositional logic presented in section 4 can be considerably simplified.
Such a simplified system will be given in the next section. At the same time, the system
can be “purified”, in the sense that all those rules are avoided whose formulations
make use of “t”, “f”, “⊢”, “ ”, or of bound variables, or of rules whose converse is
invalid if we do not use bound variables, etc. In the present chapter, we shall briefly
explain what we mean by such a “purified” system, or by a system whose primitive
rules are all “pure rules of derivation”.
Propositional logic (and functional logic) is usually constructed as a system of
logically true statements of the object language – in the case of propositional logic
often called “tautologies”. This system can be characterized, either deductively, by
specifying certain statements as primitive propositions or axioms, and by laying down
some rule of inference – usually the modus ponens. Or the system can be characterized
by specifying some decision method, such as truth tables, matrices, etc. which allow
us to decide, of any given statement, whether or not it is a tautology. Now one of the
main interests of this system of tautologies is that it provides us with a system of
rules of derivation. Every conditional tautology allows us, with the help of the modus
ponens, to derive, from its antecedent, its consequent. Thus, if the modus ponens is
assumed, we can say that, with every conditional tautology of the form “𝐴⊃𝐵”, we
are given a corresponding rule of inference of the form “𝐴/𝐵”. It is mainly in this
|
12
way that the tautologies become useful.
Considering this situation it appears a legitimate and even an interesting aim to
determine the system of all valid derivation rules of propositional logic in a more
direct way, by simply laying down a few primitive rules of derivation, either in
addition to the modus ponens or supplanting it, but in any case without recourse to the
detour via the logically true or tautologous conditionals. In this way, our logic would
become homogenous. If, on the other hand, logically true statements are used, as it is
customary at present, then a dualism is unavoidable: statements as well as rules of
derivations will have to be used as primitives. A monism of axioms or tautologies
would, of course, be insufficient: without the modus ponens it would not allow us
to make one single derivation. But a purely derivational logic can be monistic. It
can ignore the logically true statements; but it allows us, after we have built up an
independent pure logic of derivation, to introduce later the logic of demonstration,
or of the logically true statements, by simply adding a definition of demonstrability
such as 4.0 ⊢.
Now it is clear that, if we wish to construct a system which does not introduce
as primitive any axioms or axiom schemata but exclusively rules of inference of the
character of the modus ponens and the transitivity and reflexivity principles (2.11
and 2.12), then we must clearly state the requirements of a pure rule of derivation.

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
247
For otherwise we might easily introduce axioms or axiom schemata in the form of
rules of derivation. For example,
(5.001)
𝑎/𝑏⊃𝑏
is surely a rule of derivation, but it is obviously equivalent to
(5.002)
⊢𝑏⊃𝑏
which asserts that “𝑏⊃𝑏” is logically true, and which, if used as a primitive, amounts
to laying down an axiom scheme. We thus must |
13
lay down a requirement which
excludes not only the use of “t”, “⊢”, etc., but also rules which assert that statements
of a certain form follow from any premise whatsoever, or that they follow from the
zero class of premises, etc. For all these are only so many different devices for laying
down axioms or axiom schemata.
The requirement we need can be formulated with the help of the following
definition:
A rule of inference is called “pure” if and only if we can construct, in some object
language 𝐿containing non-tautological statements (i.e. statements which are neither
tautologically true nor tautologically false), an example which satisfies the rule (in
a non-vacuous way if the rule is conditional), and which, moreover, satisfies the
requirement that all statements of the example, whether compounds or components,
are non-logical.
According to this definition, not only 5.002 but also 5.001 are excluded from the
pure rules of derivation, since all statements of the form “𝑏⊃𝑏” are logically true;
similarly, not only 4.11+ and 4.12+ are excluded, but also
𝑎/𝑏& ¬𝑎/𝑏→𝑐/𝑏
(5.011)
𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/¬𝑏→𝑎/𝑐
(5.012)
since these demand that 𝑏(in 5.011) and 𝑎(in 5.012) are, respectively, logically true
and false.
Rules such as 5.001 or 5.01 and 5.02 will be called “mixed rules of derivation”.
They must not be excluded from our system altogether if it is to be complete in
the desired sense. But we can build up a very considerable part of our system (in
fact, all rules of derivations which allow us to proceed from non-logical premises
to non-logical conclusions) without the use of mixed rules. A system (or a part of
a system) which is free of mixed rules we call a “pure logic of derivation”; and a
system whose set of primitives constitute a pure logic of derivation (but which may
contain mixed rules of derivation among its derived rules, but only among these) we
call “purely derivational”.
|
14
The fact that in a purely derivational logic, if it is complete in the desired sense,
mixed rules such as 5.01 and 5.02 will be forthcoming, may, at first sight, suggest that
such a system is not interesting since it is not really homogeneous. But the interest of
the system consists partly just in the fact that mixed rules – i.e. rules which cannot
be satisfied by examples that use only non-logical statements – are shown to be the

248
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
unavoidable limiting cases of pure rules. It is shown, in this way, that certain famous
limiting cases such as 4.0 t or 4.0 f, or 5.001; 5.011, 5.012, or
𝑎/𝑏∨¬𝑏
(5.0111)
𝑎. ¬𝑎/𝑏
(5.0121)
are not of the character of conventions – of rules that extend the range of intuitive
logic to limiting cases not covered by ordinary language – but that they are indeed
unavoidable consequences of any “ordinary logic” if only it covers those rules of
inference which are needed, and intuitively used, for the transition from ordinary
non-logical premises to ordinary non-logical conclusions. –
By adding a definition of demonstrability such as 4.0 ⊢, we add, to our purely
derivational logic, the logic of demonstration. Rules such as 5.002, or
(5.013)
⊢𝑎∨¬𝑎
and conditional rules whose antecedent and consequent have the form of 5.013, we
can call “pure rules of demonstration”; while conditional rules whose antecedent is
a rule of derivation while the consequent is a rule of demonstration (or vice versa)
may be described as “mixed rules of derivation and demonstration”. All these may
occur in a logic of demonstration, but not in that self-contained part which has been
characterized here as purely derivational.
If we now proceed to purify the system of rules presented in section 4, then we find
that the technical problems involved are negligible. All we have to do is to replace
the mixed rules of |
15
derivation and demonstration, i.e., all the rules preceding 4.2, by
the following primitive rule:
(Negation:)
(5.1)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬𝑏1/¬𝑏2 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏2/𝑏1
This rule may be replaced by several sets, such as the two rules
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1/¬𝑏2 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏2/¬𝑏1
(5.11)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬𝑏1/𝑏2 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬𝑏2/𝑏1.
(5.12)
The first of these may in turn be replaced by the two rules:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1/𝑏2 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬𝑏2/¬𝑏1
(5.111)
𝑎/¬¬𝑎
(5.112)
In a similar way, rule 5.12 is equivalent, in the presence of 5.111, either to the one
unconditional rule
(5.120)
¬¬𝑎/𝑎
or to the two rules

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
249
¬𝑎, ¬¬𝑎/𝑎
(5.121)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬¬𝑏1, ¬¬𝑏2/𝑏1 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, ¬¬𝑏1, ¬𝑏2/𝑏1
(5.122)
(For proofs of the claimed equivalences see the correspondingly numbered rules of
section 6.)
If we omit 5.122 (but retain the rest, i.e. 5.121, and 5.11 or its equivalents), then
our system coincides with the “Intuitionistic Calculus” of Heyting. If we further omit
5.121, then the rest, i.e. 5.11 (or its equivalents) becomes equivalent to Johansson’s
“Minimum Calculus”.
It may be remarked that, in the presence of 4.2 and the Intuitionistic Rules of
Negation (i.e., the rules of negation without 5.122), rule 5.122 is equivalent to
(5.2X)
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, 𝑏1 ⊃𝑏2/𝑏1 →𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1
|
16
In other words, if either 5.122 or 5.2X are added to the Intuitionistic Calculus, then
we obtain the complete (classical) system. Rule 5.2X is interesting for a different
reason: if 5.2X is added to 4.2, then all those valid rules of inference which employ
no compound except the conditional can be obtained with the help of the rules of
section 2, while 4.2 alone gives, with the rules of section 2, only those rules of
inference which correspond to that subclass of the tautological conditionals which
Hilbert and Bernays call “positive identical”. (See 6.72 and 6.720, and section 7,
below.)
If 5.2X is added to 4.2, and the rules of negation in section 4 replaced by 5.1 or its
equivalents, then the following holds for the so amended system of rules of section 4:
every valid rule of inference 𝑅which can be expressed in our system can be obtained
in it by employing, in addition to the rules of section 2, merely those primitive rules
which refer to the compounds occurring in 𝑅. Thus, if only conditionals occur in 𝑅,
rules 4.2 and 5.2X suffice; if negation occurs, 5.1 or its equivalent are sufficient; etc.
In order to make each of the primitive rules (or group of rules which introduce
one of the various compounds) complete in this sense, we have to make the system
redundant; for 5.2X can be obtained from the rules for negation and 4.2.
If, on the other hand, we are not interested in this kind of completeness of every
group of rules, then the whole system can be considerably simplified.
6. Simplified Systems
The purely derivational system of propositional logic discussed in the last section can
be simplified by limiting the number 𝑛of the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛which play a part
in the various (conditional) primitive rules of inference. We obtain in this way the
following complete system:e

(Conjunction:)
(6.4)
𝑎. 𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
(Disjunction:)
(6.5)
𝑎∨𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎/𝑐& 𝑏/𝑐
We can, of course, introduce, in the usual way, some of these compounds by way
of definition rather than by way of primitive rules; if we then take negation and
conjunction as primitives, then, for example, rules 6.1 and 6.4 constitute a sufficient
basis. This is interesting because this system, consisting in addition to the rule 6.1
which introduces negation only of the extremely simple and even trivial rule 6.4 does
not need to be further strengthened by the modus ponens; for the rule
𝑎, ¬(𝑎. ¬𝑏)/𝑏
(see below, 6.82)
can be derived from 6.4 and 6.1; in this way we can obtain the modus ponens
immediately with the help of the customary definition:
“𝑎⊃𝑏” for “¬(𝑎. ¬𝑏)”
The system here described – i.e. 6.1 and 6.4 – is in our opinion one of the simplest
and, at the same time, most lucid bases of propositional logic so far known. It employs,
apart from the rules of section 2 which are, tacitly or otherwise, presupposed by
all systems, only two primitive rules. None of the usual systems employs a smaller
number of rules, since all employ, at the very least, one rule of inference, and one
axiom or one axiom scheme (which amounts to another rule of inference – viz., to a
mixed rule asserting that the statements described as axioms follow from any premise
whatsoever). At the same time, the known systems which employ only one axiom,
apart from rules of inference, sacrifice lucidity in order to achieve this aim.

In a similar way, the rules for negation and the conditional, 6.1 and 6.2, suffice as
a basis for propositional logic. If, however, negation and disjunction are to be used,
for intuitionism, omit “𝑑” in A.D.
for minimum negation, omit “𝑑” in J.D.

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
251
then 6.5 is not, it appears, sufficient, but should be replaced by
𝑎, 𝑏∨𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑑
(see below, 6.91)
(6.5+)
from which the modus ponens in the form
𝑎, ¬𝑎∨𝑏/𝑏
can be obtained by 𝑏¬𝑎, 𝑐𝑏, 𝑑𝑏; for we easily obtain “𝑎, ¬𝑎/𝑏” from 6.1. (See
below, 6.101.)
Similarly, if we do not wish to employ negation at all, but wish to obtain the rules
corresponding to Hilbert-Bernays’ “positive identical” conditionals by using only
one rule that introduces the conditional, then 6.2 must be replaced by
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐⊃𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑
(see below, 6.721, 6.724)
(6.2+)
But if we have conjunction at our disposal, i.e. 6.4, then 6.2+ can be obtained from
6.4 and 6.2, just as it can be obtained from 6.1 and 6.2.
The rule for negation, 6.1, can be split up into independent weaker rules, exactly as
indicated in section 5. The rules obtained in this way (numbered so as to correspond
to those in section 5) will be proved next.
Again, 6.11 (or its equivalents) yields the negation of the “Minimum Calculus”,
and, if 6.121 is added to it, that of the Intuitionistic Calculus. –
We now proceed to establish a number of dependent rules of the pure logic of
derivation, obtainable from the primitive rules 6.1 to 6.5. In the next section, we shall
add mixed rules and prove the completeness of the system.
In deriving these rules,we shall make use of those of section 2. But it is a remarkable
fact that we do not need those rules as they stand; all we need are considerably weaker
rules, namely the rules of section 2 with a limited number of premises – up to a
maximum of three premises. We shall indicate this in the proofs by putting subscripts
|
19
to the quoted rules of section 2; for example, “2.112,3” will mean “2.11, with 𝑚= 2
and 𝑛= 3”, etc.
We shall first prove rules in which only one compound occurs, and only later
combine different compounds in the same rules.

(6.1101) = 6.103: this can be obtained, by 2.61 and 2.322, from 6.11, 𝑏¬𝑎, 𝑐𝑎.
Similarly, 6.1102 is obtainable from 6.11:

252
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
𝑎, ¬𝑎/¬𝑏
(6.11, 𝑐𝑎; 2.322)
(6.1102)
Thus we can obtain 6.111 from 6.11, using 6.1102:
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐→𝑎, ¬𝑐/¬𝑏
(6.11, 𝑐¬𝑐; 6.1101; 2.932,2)
(6.111)
(6.112) = 6.103 = 6.1101
(6.120) = 6.102; obtainable from 6.12, 𝑎¬¬𝑎; 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐¬𝑎; together with 6.1201
(𝑎¬𝑎; 𝑏¬𝑎) which is also obtainable from 6.12:
¬𝑎, 𝑎/𝑏
(6.12, 𝑐𝑎; 2.322; 2.132)
(6.1201)
Rule 6.1201 can also be obtained from 6.120, 𝑎𝑏; together with 6.1102, 𝑏¬𝑏;
without using 6.12; accordingly, we can obtain the following two rules without using
6.12:
¬𝑎, ¬¬𝑎/𝑎
(6.1201, 𝑎¬𝑎; 𝑏𝑎)
(6.121)
¬¬𝑎, ¬¬𝑏/𝑎→¬¬𝑎, ¬𝑏/𝑎
(6.102; 2.141)
(6.122)
This concludes the derivation of the rules corresponding to 5.11, 5.12, etc. In order
to prove our contentions stated in section 5, we have, besides, to establish certain
equivalences: 6.120 can be obtained from 6.122, 𝑏¬𝑎,together with “¬¬𝑎, ¬¬¬𝑎/𝑎”,
whichin turn follows from |
20
6.1102,𝑎¬¬𝑎,𝑏𝑎; andthe same,𝑎¬¬𝑎,𝑏¬𝑎; together
with 6.121. Thus 6.120, in the presence of 6.11, is equivalent to 6.121 and 6.122;
but it is also equivalent in the presence of 6.111 instead of 6.11, for 6.1102 can be
obtained from 6.111, 𝑐𝑎. – 6.120, in turn, is equivalent, in the presence of 6.11, to
6.12; for 6.103 = 6.1101 can be obtained from 6.11. – 6.11 from 6.111, 𝑐¬𝑐, and
6.112. – 6.1 from 6.11 and 6.120, or from 6.12 and 6.112. – This establishes the
claimed equivalences.
Other rules, containing negation only are, for example:f
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, ¬𝑐/¬𝑏
(6.1; 6.111)
(6.13)
𝑎, 𝑏/¬𝑏→𝑏, 𝑏/¬𝑎

f Between (6.16) and (6.17) there is a handwritten remark, barely readable in the copy: “all these
rules, with the exception of the last four, are valid in the intuitionistic logic and even in Johansson’s
minimum logic, and so are the next three”.

We now turn to rules containing conditionals only. We first obtain the modus
ponens:
𝑎⊃𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏
(6.2, 𝑎𝑎⊃𝑏; 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐𝑏; 2.12)
(6.20)
and by applying this twice,
𝑎⊃(𝑎⊃𝑏), 𝑎/𝑏
(6.20, 2.112,2)
(6.201)
Two important rules are
𝑎/𝑏⊃𝑎
(6.2, 𝑐𝑎)
(6.21)
𝑎⊃(𝑎⊃𝑏)/𝑎⊃𝑏
(6.2, 𝑎𝑎⊃(𝑎⊃𝑏); 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐𝑏; //6.201)
(6.22)
For what follows, we need
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐⊃𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑
(see below, 6.721 and 6.724)
(6.2+)
This can be obtained either with the help of 6.1 or 6.4, and will be so derived later
(see 6.721 and 6.724).
We obtain first a generalized modus ponens:
𝑎⊃𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏
(6.2+, 𝑎𝑎⊃𝑏; 𝑏𝑐; 𝑐𝑎; 𝑑𝑏; //2.322)
(6.220)
and applying this together with the modus ponens:
(𝑎⊃𝑏), (𝑏⊃𝑐), 𝑎/𝑐
(6.220, 6.20, 2.112,3)
(6.2201)
(𝑎⊃𝑏), (𝑏⊃𝑐)/𝑎⊃𝑐
(6.2+, //6.2201)
(6.2202)
This establishes the transitivity of the conditional, which we can also write:
𝑎⊃𝑏/(𝑏⊃𝑐) ⊃(𝑎⊃𝑐)
(6.2202; 6.1)
(6.23)
A few more rules of importance are:
𝑎, 𝑎⊃𝑐, 𝑏⊃𝑐/𝑐
(6.220; 2.53)
(6.231)
𝑏, 𝑎⊃𝑐, 𝑏⊃𝑐/𝑐
(6.231; 2.5) |

(6.232; 6.2+; 6.2)
(6.25)

Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
We now proceed to rules containing the bi-conditional only:
𝑎≡𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏
(6.3, 𝑎𝑎≡𝑏; 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐𝑏)
(6.31)
𝑎≡𝑏, 𝑏/𝑎
(the same)
(6.32)
The next rule needs for its derivation the help of 6.4:
𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑& 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑑/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐≡𝑑
(see below, 6.734)
(6.33)
Rules containing conjunction only:

𝑎. 𝑏/𝑏
(6.4, 𝑐𝑏)
(6.42)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎. 𝑏
(6.4, 𝑐𝑎. 𝑏)
(6.421)
The three rules 6.41, 6.42, and 6.421 are equivalent to ⟨6.4⟩. (6.421 has sometimes
been called “rule of adjunction”; ⟨6.4⟩may be called, perhaps, the “full rule of
adjunction”.)

The next rule will be derived later, with the help of conjunction and negation:
𝑎, 𝑏∨𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑑
(see below, 6.91)
(6.5+)
We now sketch the proofs of a few selected rules, employing more than one compound
at a time; first negation and the conditional:
¬𝑎⊃¬𝑏/𝑏⊃𝑎
(6.1, 𝑎¬𝑎⊃¬𝑏; 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐𝑏; 6.2; 6.20)
(6.71)
𝑎⊃𝑏/¬𝑏⊃¬𝑎
(similarly, from 6.111)
(6.711)
𝑎/¬𝑎⊃𝑏
(6.101; 6.2)
(6.712)
¬𝑎/𝑎⊃𝑏
(6.101; 6.2)
(6.713)
¬𝑎/𝑎⊃¬𝑏
(6.713, 𝑏¬𝑏)
(6.714)
¬𝑏/𝑎⊃¬𝑏
(6.21)
(6.715)
From 6.713 and 6.19, we can obtain an important rule in which only the conditional
occurs (negation disappears): it is the simplified version of 5.2X:
𝑎, 𝑏⊃𝑐/𝑏→𝑎/𝑏
(6.713, 𝑎𝑏; 𝑏𝑐; //6.19, 𝑐𝑏⊃𝑐)
(6.72)
(𝑎⊃𝑏) ⊃𝑎/𝑎
(6.72, 𝑎(𝑎⊃𝑏) ⊃𝑎; 𝑏𝑎; 𝑐𝑏; 6.20)
(6.720)
In the following rules the conditional is more important than the negation:

Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
The last rule is identical with 6.2+; it can be derived, more easily, by using the
conditional together with conjunction:
𝑎. 𝑏/𝑐⊃𝑑↔𝑎. 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑
(6.2)
(6.723)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐⊃𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑
(6.723; 6.41; 6.42; 2.91; 6.421; 2.92)

Next the conditional and bi-conditional:

(6.731)
𝑎≡𝑏/𝑏⊃𝑎
(6.32; 6.2)
(6.732)

(6.7330)
𝑎⊃𝑏/(𝑏⊃𝑎) ⊃(𝑎≡𝑏)
(6.7330; 6.2)
(6.733)
We omit rules employing the bi-conditional and negation; but we give a proof of 6.33
which uses the bi-conditional and the conjunction:
𝑎. 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑& 𝑎. 𝑏, 𝑑/𝑐→𝑎. 𝑏/𝑐≡𝑑
(6.3)
(6.7340)
𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑& 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑑/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐≡𝑑
(6.7340; 6.41; 6.42; 2.91;
(6.734)
6.421; 2.92)
Next the conditional and the conjunction:
𝑎⊃𝑏, 𝑎⊃𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏. 𝑐

how a rule corresponding to 6.2+ can be derived. |

𝑎, 𝑏/¬(𝑐. ¬𝑑) ↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑

(6.823)
This proves our contention that the rules for conjunction and negation suffice,
together with the customary definition of the conditional, to establish the rules for the
conditional.
The following rules are of considerable importance:
¬𝑐/¬𝑎& ¬𝑐/¬𝑏↔¬𝑐/¬𝑎. ¬𝑏

𝑎/𝑐& 𝑏/𝑐↔¬(¬𝑎. ¬𝑏)/𝑐

𝑎, ¬(¬𝑏. ¬𝑐)/𝑑↔¬(¬(𝑎. 𝑏) . ¬(𝑎. 𝑐))/𝑑
(6.84; 6.85; 6.851)
(6.86)
This is a form of the distributive law, expressed in terms of conjunction and negation;
for it yields immediately:
𝑎. (¬(¬𝑏. ¬𝑐))/¬(¬(𝑎. 𝑏) . ¬(𝑎. 𝑐))
(6.86; 6.41; 6.42; 6.421)
(6.87)

(6.84, 𝑐¬(¬𝑎. ¬𝑏))
(6.881)
𝑏/¬(¬𝑎. ¬𝑏)
(the same)
(6.882)
We now combine disjunction with conjunction
𝑎. 𝑏/𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)
(6.41; 6.42; 6.51; 2.111,1; 2.112,1)
(6.883)
𝑎. 𝑐/𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)
(similar, using 6.52)
(6.884)
(𝑎. 𝑏) ∨(𝑎. 𝑐)/𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)
(6.5; 6.883; 6.884)
(6.89)
In order to obtain the distributive law in the converse direction, we have to make use
of negation also:
𝑎∨𝑏/¬(¬𝑎. ¬𝑏)
(6.5; 6.881; 6.882)
(6.891)
¬(¬𝑎. ¬𝑏)/𝑎∨𝑏
(6.84; 6.51; 6.52)
(6.892)
¬(¬(𝑎. 𝑏) . ¬(𝑎. 𝑐))/(𝑎. 𝑏) ∨(𝑎. 𝑐)
(6.892)
(6.893)
𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)/𝑎. (¬(¬𝑏. ¬𝑐))
(6.891; 6.47)
(6.894)
leaving now negation aside, we have:

258
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)/(𝑎. 𝑏) ∨(𝑎. 𝑐)
(6.894; 6.893) |
25
(6.90)
𝑎. 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑎. 𝑐/𝑑↔(𝑎. 𝑏) ∨(𝑎. 𝑐)/𝑑
(6.5)
(6.901)
𝑎. 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑎. 𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎. (𝑏∨𝑐)/𝑑
(6.90; 6.901; 2.111,1)
(6.902)
now we can leave conjunction aside too:
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑑& 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏∨𝑐/𝑑
(6.902; 8.41; 8.42; 2.91;
(6.91)
8.421; 2.92)
This is the same as rule 6.5+.
7. Completeness of the Various Systems
The proof of completeness for the system 6.1 to 6.5 is now trivial.
We have
(7.1)
𝑎/𝑏→𝑐/𝑎⊃𝑏,
since 𝑎/𝑏→𝑐. 𝑎/𝑏(2.141 2.132), from which 7.1 follows by 6.2. Rule 7.1 asserts
that, if 𝑎/𝑏, then 𝑎⊃𝑏follows from any premise whatsoever. (Thus 𝑎⊃𝑏will be in
this case a tautology, and 7.1 is a mixed rule of derivation and demonstration; see
section 5.)
With the help of 7.1, we can easily show of all the axioms of the propositional
calculus of Hilbert and Bernays that they follow, in our system, from any premise
whatsoever. If any of these axioms, therefore, is added to any premise or set of
premises, then we cannot derive any conclusion from this set which we would have
been unable to derive without adding the axiom. Accordingly, we may use all these
axioms as “suppressed premises”, i.e., without explicitly stating them. Since we also
have the modus ponens at our disposal, we can derive from any set of premises every
conclusion which we might derive from it, with the help of the modus ponens, from
the axioms of the propositional calculus.
The rules of derivation in section 6 which correspond in view of 7.1 to the Hilbert
Bernays axioms are: I, 1)–3) of Hilbert and Bernays correspond to 6.21, 6.22, 6.23;
II, 1)–3) to 6.41, 6.42, and 6.743; III, 1)–3) to 6.51, 6.52, and 6.753; IV, 1)–3) to
6.731, 6.732, and 6.733; and V, 1)–3) correspond to our rules 6.71, 6.102, 6.103.
Furthermore, rule 6.720 corresponds in the same manner to the first formula
on p. 70 of ⟨Hilbert and Bernays, 1934⟩; i.e., |
26
in our notation, to the formula
“((𝑎⊃𝑏) ⊃𝑎) ⊃𝑎”; and it is known that, if this formula is added to the axioms I,1)
and 3), all logically true formulae containing the conditional only can be derived.
From this, our contentions stated in section 5 follow; for the systems there described
are (considering 2.6 which permits the omission of the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) obviously
stronger than the corresponding systems in section 6. (5.2X, we recall, corresponds
to 6.72).

14 On Systems of Rules of Inference
259
In order to prove our contentions stated in section 4, we only have to prove that
4.11+ and 4.12+, in the presence of the other rules, are sufficient for proving Hilbert
and Bernays’ axioms V, 1) to 3). We shall confine ourselves to showing that they are,
in the presence of the other rules, equivalent respectively to the formulae
⊢(¬𝑎⊃𝑎) ⊃𝑎
(7.11)
⊢¬𝑎⊃(𝑎⊃𝑏)
(7.12)
which are known, in the presence of the other axioms, to be equivalent to the axioms
in question.
In order to prove 7.11, we need, from the other rules,
𝑎/𝑏⊃𝑎
(6.21)
(7.111)
𝑏, 𝑏⊃𝑎/𝑎
(6.20)
(7.112)
and therefore
𝑏/(𝑏⊃𝑎) ⊃𝑎
(7.112; 6.1)
(7.113)
We obtain, by substitution
𝑎/(¬𝑎⊃𝑎) ⊃𝑎
(7.111, 𝑏¬𝑎⊃𝑎)
(7.114)
¬𝑎/(¬𝑎⊃𝑎) ⊃𝑎
(7.113, 𝑏¬𝑎)
(7.115)
From 7.114 and 7.115 follows 7.11 immediately, by 4.11+.
In order to prove 7.12 we need
𝑎. ¬𝑎→𝑎. ¬𝑎/𝑏
(4.0
)
(7.121)
together with the following rules which we likewise obtain by substitution:
𝑎. ¬𝑎/𝑎& 𝑎. ¬𝑎/¬𝑎
(6.41; 6.42)
(7.122)
𝑎. ¬𝑎/𝑏→¬𝑎, 𝑎/𝑏
(6.4; 2.132)
(7.1221)
¬𝑎, 𝑎/𝑏→¬𝑎/𝑎⊃𝑏
(6.2)
(7.1222)
𝑎. ¬𝑎/𝑏→⊢¬𝑎⊃(𝑎⊃𝑏)
(7.1221; 7.1222; 7.1; 4.0 ⊢)
(7.123)
from 7.121, 7.122, 4.12+ and 7.123 follows 7.12.
This concludes the proofs of our contentions concerning completeness.
Endnote
Meeting in Zürich in December 1946, the authors found that, starting from very
different questions, they had constructed, independently, very similar theories which

260
Paul Bernays and Karl R. Popper
they decided to publish conjointly. The main difference in their approach was that
P. Bernays re-formulated Tarski’s theory of 1930 (see section 3) in order to obtain
a general theory of inference operating with statements rather than with classes
of statements. The results thus obtained are elaborated in sections 2, 3, and 4.
K. R. Popper who had not noticed the connection between his results and Tarski’s
paper, had developed results elaborated in sections 2, 5, 6 and 7. His starting point
was the problem of a purely derivational logic discussed in section 5 (a problem
in which P. Bernays had not interested himself) and he saw in the “purification” of
derivational logic described there the distinctive difference between his approach
and, for example, G. Gentzen’s in some respects similar “Untersuchungen über das
logische Schliessen”, Mathematische Zeitschrift 39 (1935)g.

A General Theory of Inference
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This is an unpublished article from Popper’s Nachlass.
Editorial notes: The source manuscript is from KPS Box 12, Folder 10. It is marked “A General
Theory of Inference by K.R. Popper”, and consists of 54 handwritten pages, numbered 1 to 52, and
an additional sheet numbered 39A and 39B. There is a mark on page 39 with an instruction where to
insert pages 39A/B. In footnote 2 Popper mentions that he has not yet published anything concerning
the problem of characterising valid inferences in general apart from “Why are the Calculuses of
Logic and Arithmetic Applicable to Reality” (Popper, 1946c). This places the manuscript in the
second half of 1946, probably before the meeting with Bernays in December 1946. The article could
also be seen as a precursor to “Logic without Assumptions” (Popper, 1947b; this volume, Chapter 2)
where Popper also discusses different notions of translation in the context of Tarski’s concept of
logical consequence.
1. Distinction Between General and Special Theories of Inference
1
Since Aristotle, logicians have been concerned, practically without exception, with
the problem of the various special theories of inference, as opposed to those of a
general theory of inference. They developed rules of inference for special languages
(or calculi), such as the language of categorical propositions, for which Aristotle
constructed a set of rules of inference, the so-called valid moods of the syllogism; or
the more developed language of categorical propositions, usually called “calculus
of classes”, for which Boole and his successors developed an exhaustive theory of
inference; or the language of hypothetical and disjunctive propositions, for which the
Stoics constructed the set of rules called “modus ponendo ponens”, “modus tollendo
tollens”, etc; or the more developed form of this language, usually called “calculus of
propositions”, for which Frege and Russell gave an exhaustive theory of inference.
Most of the contemporary work in logic is confined to the closer investigation of
these |
2
languages and their rules of inference, or to the construction of new languages
(or calculi), or to the investigation of the relations between these calculi.

Karl R. Popper
The fundamental problem of a general theory of inference is altogether different.
It is not the problem of finding valid rules of inference for some language or other,
but the problem of characterising valid inferences in general, for example, by giving
a general and adequate definition of the term “valid inference”.
If this can be done, then many problems might be solved which otherwise must
remain insoluble. The most important of these problems is that of proving the validity
of those rules of inference which are assumed as fundamental or axiomatic by the
various special theories of inference.
I shall briefly comment on the fundamental nature of this problem.
The special theories of inference cannot do more than analyse |
3
intuitive inference.
They can give a number of general rules corresponding to some of the inferences in
the language in question which we intuitively recognized as valid. They can reduce
these rules to a small number of rules which can be accepted as valid on intuitive
grounds, and which may be described as the axiomatic rules of inference for the
language in question. They can combine these in such a way that rules emerge which
are too complicated to be judged by intuition but can, nevertheless, be shown to be
valid, if only we assume the axiomatic rules to be valid. Beyond this, the special
theories cannot go.
But the general theory might go further. It might be able of being applied to the
various systems of axiomatic rules, and to establish that they are indeed valid rules
of inference. In this way, the various special theories of inference would be reduced
to applications of the general theory of inference. In establishing the validity of the
various axiomatic rules, the general theory would further reduce the intuitive element
in logic. But this is obviously the task of logic – to give definite rules to which we may
refer instead of having to appeal to logical intuition, i.e., to the intuitive conviction
that a certain inference is valid.
|
4
It must be admitted, of course, that the general characterisation or definition of a
valid inference may retain intuitive elements. But these elements may be of a very
different character from that “logical intuition”, as we have called it, which logic
attempts to replace by rules. Besides, the adequacy of any definition may be discussed
in various ways, for example, with respect to the capacity of the definition to establish,
without any further |
5
recourse to logical intuition, those rules of inference which have
been long accepted as valid.
2. Contributions to the Problem
The first logician who, to my knowledge, conceived the idea of a general theory of
inference was Carnap who devoted part of his book Logical Syntax of Languagea
(1934 and 1937) to what he called “General Syntax”. Carnap himself is now convinced
(owing to Tarski’s criticism) that this attempt was unsuccessful (although it raised
many important problems). A second attempt was made by Tarski, in his paper On
a Carnap (1934a, 1937).

15 A General Theory of Inference
263
the Concept of Logical Consequence1. Further |
6
contributions were made by Carnap
in his book Introduction to Semanticsb (1942; see especially the reference, on p. vii,
to the distinction between logical and descriptive signs). – Since 1937 I made use
of Tarski’s ideas in my lecture courses on logic2; more especially, I attempted (a) to
apply Tarski’s general concept of logical inference to the problem of establishing the
validity of special rules of inference, (b) to analyse the distinction between logical
and descriptive signs and the dependence of the general concept of inference on this
distinction, (c) to analyse the relations between the “meaning” of logical signs and
the “meaning” of logical inference. I have convinced myself, in these lectures, |
7
that a
consideration of the practical value of inference is a useful heuristic starting point
for the discussion, and that, from this starting point, we can, in stages, proceed to
Tarski’s definition; and further, to a statement and to a criticism of this definition, and
to a re-statement of what I consider the fundamental problem of General Logic. This
will be my procedure in the next three sections (section 3 & 4). In section 5 I shall
give some alternative formulations of Tarski’s definition, preparatory to a solution of
the problem which will be sketched in section 6.
3. Steps towards Tarski’s Definition of Logical Consequence
|
8
It is an empirical fact that most of us “know how”3 to draw inferences. Apparently,
we learn this very early, and without being aware of it. This may suggest to us that
drawing inferences – or “putting two and two together”, as this activity is called
colloquially – is of some practical value to us. Why? I suggest, because
(1) Valid inferences are such that, if the premises are all true statements of facts,
the conclusion must be true as well.
In other words, if we have reliable information, and “know how” to draw inferences,
we can rely on the secondary information thus obtained. For example, we may know
from George that he sailed by the “Aquitania” and then read in the paper that the
“Aquitania” arrived and that all on board are well. Putting two and two together, we
1 ⟨Tarski, 1936b⟩, Ueber den Begriff der logischen Folgerung, published in Actes du Congrès
internationale de philosophie scientifique, fasc. VII. (Paris, 1936). It may be noted that this important
paper is missing in Z. Jordan’s ⟨1945⟩Bibliography in Polish Science and Learning, No. 6 (Oxford
1945).
2 I have, however, nothing published on this problem, except some remarks in my paper ⟨Popper,
1946c⟩“Why are the ⟨Calculuses⟩ofLogicandArithmeticApplicable to Reality?” in the Proceedings
of the Aristotelian Society (Supplementary Volume, 1946).
3 G. Ryle has drawn attention to the fact that we often “know how” to do a certain thing, as opposed
to the explicit knowledge, the “knowing that” a certain thing can be, or must be, done in a certain way.
Cp. his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society (⟨Ryle, 1945⟩), and my above mentioned
paper.
b Carnap (1942).

264
Karl R. Popper
shall draw the conclusion “George arrived and is well”; and provided our original
information was true, we may rely on the conclusion to be a true statement of fact.
We take (1) as the first step towards a definition of valid inference. It leads
immediately to a |
9
formulation (2) which has been used, in some form or other, by
many logicians since Aristotle:
(2) An alleged inference is certainly invalid if the premises are all true and the
conclusion false.
We can express (1) and (2) also by saying (with Aristotle):
(3) If an inference is valid, then the second of the following four possible combi-
nations cannot occur: (1) The premises are all true, and the conclusion is true; (2) the
premises are all true and the conclusion is false; (3) the premises are not all true and
the conclusion is true; (4) the premises are not all true, and the conclusion is false.
Combinations (1), (3), and (4) can occur, that is to say, only the second combination
is incompatible with validity.
All this would be of little value if we could not add
(4) The validity of an inference can be known without information about the truth
or falsity of the premises and the conclusion.
That is to say, we need not have any |
10
direct information concerning the conclusion:
information about the truth of the premises and knowledge concerning the validity of
the inferences is enough, and can be obtained without consideration of the conclusion.
On the other hand, we shall say that
(5) The property of transmitting unfailingly the truth of the premises (if they
are true) to the conclusion is, practically and theoretically, the most important
characteristic of a valid inference.
If we consider (5), it is clear that such a term as “unfailingly” or “necessarily”
is unsatisfactory. It can be replaced, however, by reference to what we may call the
“logical form” of an inference (a term which, in its turn, needs further analysis):
(6) An inference is valid if its logical form is such that no other inference of the
same logical form can have true premises and a false conclusion.
|
11
If we have an inference under consideration, not knowing whether it is valid, then
we can try to construct an inference of the same logical form, but with true premises
and a false conclusion. Such an (obviously invalid) inference with true premises
and a false conclusion we call a “counter example” of the inference in question. (If
the original inference has true premises and a false conclusion, then it is its own
counter-example.) Using this term counter-example, we can now say:
(7) An inference is valid if and only if no counter example of it exists.
This is a reasonably satisfactory general definition, ⟨and⟩although it will have
to be amended in many ways, it can be used for proving the invalidity (and even
the validity) of various special rules of |
12
inference. It is based on the technical

15 A General Theory of Inference
265
term “counter-example” which, in turn, is based on the concepts “true”, “false” (or
“non-true”), and “logical form”.
Of these two concepts we shall take the concept “true” for granted (in the sense of
the correspondence theory, i.e., of the phrase: “A statement s is true if and only if
it corresponds to the facts”). We can do this because of the famous analysis of this
concept by Tarski; only this analysis made a general theory of inference possible.
Nevertheless, we shall show, later, that we can eliminate this concept, if we use, with
Carnap and Tarski, the name “Semantics” for a theory which makes use of the term
“truth” (and related terms, such as “𝑋is the name of 𝑦” or “𝑋designates 𝑦”), and if
we use, with Carnap, the name “Syntax” |
13
for a theory which considers the logical
form of expressions without using terms characteristic of semantics, then we can
say that we shall first construct a semantical concept of valid inference, and later a
syntactical one. (Tarski’s concept of inference belongs to Semantics.)
The second concept mentioned above, that of the “logical form” of an inference, can
be replaced by that of a “logical skeleton” (of a statement, or of a class of statements,
or of an argument or inference). This term, in its turn, is based on the classification of
the signs of the language under consideration into two classes: the logical signs or, as
I prefer to call them, the formative signs on the one hand, and the descriptive signs on
the other.
|
14
This distinction is one which all logicians since Aristotle have made; but it was
first explicitly discussed by Carnap (in his “Logical Syntax”). Logical or, as we shall
say, formative signs are, for example, Aristotle’s affirmative and negative copulas,
“is” or “are”, and “is not” or “are not”; further the words “all” and “some”. Other
examples are the words “if . . . then . . .”, “or”, “neither . . . nor . . .”, “and”, “it is not
the case that . . .”, etc. Descriptive signs are, for example, the words “cow”, “justice”,
“the 1st of November 1946”, etc. The problem whether we can give a more general
explanation of this distinction rather than an explanation based on examples will be
discussed below.
|
15
Once the distinction between logical and descriptive signs is given, it is easy to
explain the term “logical skeleton”. We obtain the logical skeleton of a sentence, or
a set of sentences, or an argument, by deleting all descriptive constants (and only
these), taking care, however, to indicate repetitions of the descriptive constants. (This
can be best achieved by the use of variables: we put variables in the empty places left
by the elimination of the descriptive constants, and use the same variable wherever
the same descriptive term has been eliminated, and otherwise different variables.)
|
16
Considering this explanation, our definition (7) is only a shorter way of saying:
(8) An inference is valid if, and only if, an inference with the same logical skeleton,
and with true premises and a false conclusion, does not exist.
4. Tarski’s Definition of Logical Consequence
We are now prepared to take the last step which leads us to Tarski’s final concept of
logical consequence or of an inference.

266
Karl R. Popper
A definition such as (7) or (8) is, as Tarski points out, not entirely satisfactory;
although its intentions are correct, it does not completely answer these |
17
intentions, if
we accept it as a definition for inference in general, i.e., inference in any language.
The simple reason is that some languages may not possess those descriptive terms
which are needed for establishing a counter example. Take an invalid inference such
as
All men are mortal.
All Greeks are mortal.
All Greeks are men.
In order to establish a counter example, we clearly need, at the very least, either (a)
one other term, say “𝑡” (“dogs” for example), which satisfies the following condition:
“All 𝑡are mortal” is true, “All 𝑡are men” is false, |
18
or else (b) one other term, say “𝑢”
(“plants”, for example), which satisfies the conditions: “All 𝑢are mortal” is true and
“All Greeks are 𝑢” is false. Now it is easy to construct a language which does not
contain such terms; for example, we can take Aristotle’s formative signs and all the
rules of Aristotelian logic, and add to these the terms “men”, “mortal”, and “Greeks”;
or we could add even the terms “Greeks”, “Persians”, “Egyptians”, etc., and the name
of any property shared by all these. In both these languages, no counter-example
exists to show the invalidity of the inference |
19
mentioned. Accordingly, the inference
would be valid in the sense of our definition (7) and (8), which is certainly against
our intentions.
In order to avoid this unwanted consequence of definitions of the type (7) or (8),
Tarski introduces the idea of a model of a logical skeleton. (The idea is taken from
the postulational technique: we may say, for example, that light-rays (on Earth) and
Fadenkreuze ⟨crosshairs⟩are a model of, or satisfy, the postulate systems of Euclidean
Geometry, if we put light-rays in place |
20
of what Euclid meant by “straight lines”, and
Fadenkreuze ⟨crosshairs⟩for whatever Euclid meant by “points”.) By a model, Tarski
means a set of things, properties, relations etc. (not their names); and he says that a
model satisfies a logical skeleton, or that a model is a model of a logical skeleton,
if and only if, the skeleton becomes true after substitution of appropriate names of
these things (which names are to be added, if necessary, to the vocabulary of the
language in question). In |
21
this sense, the set consisting of the class of all Greeks and
the class of all mortals (of the classes themselves, and not of their names) satisfies, or
is a model of, the skeleton “All 𝑥are 𝑦”, or the set consisting of Socrates, the class of
teachers (of somebody) and Alcibiades (of the men themselves and the relation and
not of their names) satisfies, or is a model of, |
22
the logical skeleton “𝑎is one of the
𝑅of 𝑏”. The idea that a model satisfies (or fulfils) a skeleton, or it is a model of a
skeleton, is clearly very closely related to the idea of truth.
With the help of this idea of a model, we can now formulate Tarski’s definition of
logical consequence or of valid inference:
(9) An inference is valid if every model satisfying the skeleton of the premises is
a model satisfying the skeleton of the conclusion.

15 A General Theory of Inference
267
5. Criticism of Tarski’s Definition. Present State of the Problem
|
23
Tarski himself has given an excellent criticism of his definition. He points out that
the definition is dependent upon the distinction between formative (or logical) and
descriptive signs, and that we cannot be sure whether this distinction is not somewhat
arbitrary. Surely, the examples given above are innocent enough. But if we realize
that we are inclined to take such mathematical concepts as “>” (“greater than”) or
“=” (“equals”) as formative while we would hardly doubt that “taller than” or “of
equal height” are descriptive, then we may |
24
begin to doubt whether the distinction
is not somewhat arbitrary. But if this is so, then there may be a number of different
classifications of the signs of a language into formative and descriptive possible, and
to each of these would correspond a different concept of valid inference.
Tarski’s ultimate attitude, accordingly, is rather sceptical. He seems to think that
the element of arbitrariness in the |
25
distinction between formative and descriptive
signs cannot be eliminated, and that the concept of inference, since it depends on this
distinction, has a similarly arbitrary character.
The situation can be also described in this way. All logic, and especially the general
theory of inference, attempts to replace our logical intuition by definite rules. We now
find that what we have |
26
achieved is only this: we have replaced the logical intuition
of the validity of inferences by the intuition of the (formative or descriptive) character
of the signs of the language in question.
I believe that this is, indeed, an achievement. It is an achievement because in many
cases – say, in Aristotle’s or Boole’s or Frege’s and Russell’s systems – the distinction
between formative and descriptive signs is fairly obvious, and accordingly Tarski’s
definition can be applied with considerable success. But that we have not really solved
the problem we started to solve seems obvious enough.

Carnap seems to take a more optimistic view than Tarski. He points out,
very forcefully, the devastating consequences of Tarski’s scepticism. One of these
consequences is that we could no longer maintain the distinction between logically
true and factually true statements; this distinction which has been widely used by
philosophers (“analytic” or “tautological” versus “synthetic” propositions), Carnap
considers (rightly,withoutdoubt) as “indispensable forthe logicalanalysis ofscience”4.
Yet |
28
Carnap admits5 that “no satisfactory precise definition . . . is known” of formative
(or descriptive) signs.
From what has been said, it seems clear that the problem (a) of defining valid
inference without assuming a classification of the signs of the languages under consid-
eration into formative and descriptive and/or (b) of giving a satisfactory definition of
formative and descriptive signs, is perhaps the most urgent and fundamental unsolved
problem of general logic.
|
29
I may say here that I was inclined for a long time to consider these problems as
insoluble. One of the reasons was, undoubtedly, the influence of Tarski’s authority,
and the fact that there is, undoubtedly, something naïve in the belief that the signs
4 Carnap ⟨1942⟩, Introduction to Semantics, p. vii.

of all languages must be capable of a neat division into two parts. Tarski’s criticism
of this naïveté is in any case a major logico-philosophical discovery, whether or not
this division can be in some way or other justified; and |
30
it seems difficult, in the face
of such a discovery, to uphold the main tenets of the view criticized, without laying
oneself open to the charge of dogmatic and wishful thinking.
In spite of all that I am now inclined to consider that Carnap’s optimism is justified,
although in a somewhat modified and restricted way, and that the fundamental problem
of general logic is solvable to a very considerable extent. In what follows I shall give
an outline of what I believe is a way to a solution.
6. Reformulation of Tarski’s Definition
|
31
As a first step towards a solution, I shall re-state Tarski’s definition in a slightly
different form, viz., by replacing the idea of a model by the practically equivalent
idea of a form-preserving interpretation.
Let us call the language system for which we wish to give a general definition of
valid inference the language-system 𝑆1. Since we intend to give a general definition,
we must not assume anything about this language, apart from the fact that it is a
language in the logical sense: we assume that it is not only an expressive but also a
descriptive language, |
32
that is to say, capable of descriptions which are true or false.
Such descriptions are statements or classes of statements. (We shall use lower case
italics from the beginning of the alphabet as (variable) names for statements, and
upper case italics as names of classes of statements. “𝑎𝜖𝐴” should be read “The
statement 𝑎is an element of the statements class 𝐴”.) We thus assume that 𝑆1 is a
meaningful language, that we understand it as we do, say, English.
We further assume that we have other languages 𝑆2, 𝑆3, etc., about which we
make the same assumption. We further assume that all the statements of |
33
𝑆1 can be
translated into the statements of these other languages (but not necessarily vice versa:
the other languages may be richer than 𝑆1, i.e., contain statements which cannot be
translated into 𝑆1).
Besides the normal translations of 𝑆1 into the other languages we shall speak
of interpretations – of 𝑆1 in 𝑆2, or in 𝑆3, etc. An interpretation is a kind of mock-
translation, or a generalized translation. It is based on some set of rules which correlate
to certain signs, or sets of signs of 𝑆1, some signs, or sets of signs, in another language,
say in 𝑆2. All such rules of interpretation must satisfy the following general principles:
(1) The |
34
rules must be such that to every sentence of 𝑆1, a sentence in 𝑆2 is correlated.
(2) Within the limits drawn by (1), certain signs (or groups of signs, i.e. phrases) of
𝑆1 may be singled out as “meaningless” in this interpretation, that is to say, they are
not correlated to any signs in 𝑆2. (3) All other signs, or a group of signs (phrases) are
to be correlated to signs, or groups of signs, in 𝑆2.
It is clear from this description that an interpretation may correlate true statements
to false statements, and vice versa. We may, for example, interpret the word “All” of
𝑆1, wherever it occurs, by a word of 𝑆2 that means |
35
“some”, or “most”, or “30%”;

15 A General Theory of Inference
269
or we may treat it as “meaningless”, i.e., as redundant. And we can interpret all
descriptive terms in whatever way we like. It is clear, furthermore, that if a series
of statements which constitutes a valid inference in 𝑆1 is interpreted in this way in
𝑆2, then the correlated series of statements in 𝑆2 will as a rule no longer constitute a
valid inference. (This is obvious from the possibility of interpreting “all” as “some”.)
We now introduce the concept of an interpretation which preserves a certain sign
or a class of signs.
(10)c If in an interpretation a sign or class of signs is always normally translated,
i.e., taken in its proper meaning, then |
36
we say of an interpretation that it preserves
this group of signs.
Now we shall again assume, as in Tarski’s definition, that the signs of 𝑆1 are classi-
fied into two groups, the formative and descriptive signs; and we call an interpretation
which preserves all the formative signs a “form-preserving interpretation”. With the
help of this concept we can restate Tarski’s definition of inference in this way:
(11) An inference in 𝑆1 is valid if and only if the following holds: if, in some
form-preserving interpretation, all the premises are true, then the conclusion is also
true.
|
37
Since we here speak of all interpretations – not, perhaps, of interpretations
confined to the particular language 𝑆2 which may happen to be as poor as 𝑆1 – the
same generality is achieved as in Tarski’s definition (as opposed to the definitions
(7) or (8)). For if a model exists which satisfies the conclusion but not the premises,
then a language can be constructed which contains the appropriate names, and in this
language, accordingly, a form-preserving interpretation of 𝑆1 can be given in which
all the premises of the inference in question are true and the conclusion ⟨is⟩false.
We can, if we like, call such a form-preserving interpretation a counter-example
(of the alleged inference); and if we |
38
re-define our term counter-example, then we
can also define a valid inference by a formula identical with (7), only that the term
“counter-example” now means “a form-preserving interpretation that correlates to all
premises true sentences and to the conclusion a false sentence”. We thus get
(12) An inference is valid if no counter example exists.
Tarski’s criticism of his concept of inference remains, of course, completely in
force, with all its consequences, for the concept of a form-preserving interpretation
is in precisely the same way dependent upon the |
39
division of the signs of 𝑆1 into
formative and descriptive signs, as was the case in the original distinction.
|
39A
However, certain minor advantages arise. We can, for example, give with the
help of our method a simple and convincing definition of those statements which are
logically true:
(13) A statement 𝑎of 𝑆1 is logically true if and only if all form-preserving
interpretations of 𝑎are true. (The corresponding definition with the help of the idea
of a “model” would be: “A statement 𝑎of 𝑆1 is logically true if its logical skeleton is
c Number added.

270
Karl R. Popper
satisfied by all models.” But this would not do – the models may not fit. We would
have to say “by all fitting models”, and explain in general what a fitting model is, –
not a very easy task.)
|
39B
Since Carnap rightly emphasises the link between our problem and that of a
general characterisation of logically true statements of a language, it is of some
advantage if we can show this link clearly. The obvious link between (11) and (13)
and the fact that they equally use the idea of form-preserving interpretations, does
not need to be further stressed.
|
39cont.
We now proceed to construct a further alternative and equivalent definition. Let
us assume that “𝐼𝑘”, or “𝐼𝑙”, or “𝐼𝑚”, etc., are names of certain form-conservative
interpretations. (We do not assume that the set of these interpretations is denumerable;
and in general, it will not be denumerable.) In each of these form-conservative
interpretations, a certain class of statements of 𝑆1 will be correlated only with true
statements of the language in which the statements of 𝑆are interpreted. |
40
Let us denote
the class of all those statements of 𝑆1 which are, in the interpretation 𝐼𝑘, correlated
with true statements, by the sign “𝑀𝑘”. It is clear that, although all statements of
𝑆1 which belong to 𝑀𝑘are true in the interpretation 𝐼𝑘, they will not be, in general,
true in the language 𝑆1, or in other interpretations, except those statements which
are logically true. These will be true in every form-conservative interpretation, that
is to say, they will be in every of the classes 𝑀𝑘, 𝑀𝑙, 𝑀𝑚, etc, which are correlated
with classes of true statements in the interpretation 𝐼𝑘, 𝐼𝑙, 𝐼𝑚, etc.; in other words, the
logically true statements will be those which belong to all these classes.
I shall call the classes 𝑀𝑘, 𝑀𝑙, etc., “fundamental classes”. The class of all
fundamental classes will be denoted by “Fd”. Thus “𝑀𝑘𝜖Fd” |
41
means “𝑀𝑘is a
fundamental class”. From what has been said it is clear that the class Fd is a class
whose elements are the various classes of all those statements of 𝑆1 which are true in
the various form-preserving interpretations. We now can define
(14) The class of logically true statements of 𝑆1 is the product of the class of
fundamental classes.
or
(15) The statement 𝑎is logically true (or in signs: 𝑎𝜖𝐿𝑡) if and only if 𝑎is
an element of every fundamental class; or in signs (I use the notation of Principia
Mathematica) 𝑎𝜖𝐿𝑡≡𝑀𝜖Fd ⊃𝑎𝜖𝑀.
Similarly, we can define again the valid inferences in 𝑆1:
(16) An inference in 𝑆1 with the premises 𝐴and the conclusion 𝑏is valid (in
signs, 𝐴→𝑏) if and only if the following hold: if all the premises in 𝐴belong to
some fundamental class, then the conclusion 𝑏belongs to the same fundamental
class; in signs: 𝐴→𝑏≡𝑀𝜖Fd ⊃(𝐴⊂𝑀⊃𝑏𝜖𝑀).
|
42
All these definitions, just as in Tarski’s, are semantical (they make use of the
concept of truth), and they all are, like Tarski’s, dependent on that crucial distinction
between formative and descriptive signs.

15 A General Theory of Inference
271
7. Relativization of the Concept
The solution of our fundamental problem does not, I believe, lie in the more or less
dogmatic assertion that there are signs in every language which are (as it were) “by
nature” |
43
formative. It lies, rather, in admitting the relativity of Tarski’s concept of
inference, as stressed in Tarski’s sceptical criticism of his definition, and in facing
even the most unpleasant and radical consequences of the situation thus created. This
opens the way to constructing a theory which, I believe, can satisfy those who, like
Carnap, find it necessary to |
44
demand an absolute distinction between formative and
descriptive signs.
We shall start with the frank admission that the signs of most languages, and
surely of all naturally grown languages, cannot be neatly divided into formative and
descriptive signs, and there may be even languages which do not contain any separate
formative signs. (This should be obvious enough, considering that in practically all
naturally grown languages, and even in many languages constructed by logicians,
there are statements constructed of descriptive signs only; take, for |
45
example, the
statement “I won” in English, or even a compound of three component statements like
“veni, vidi, vici” in Latin. On the other hand, there are certainly languages, constructed
by logicians – for example, that of Principia Mathematica – which do not contain any
descriptive signs.
In view of this situation, and of our aim to treat the problem in a completely general
way, we shall give up the assumption that we have, as it were, inside information
about the nature and classification of the signs of the languages under |
46
consideration;
and we shall, later on, develop a method which does determine the formative signs
“from without”, as it were, or by the way in which they affect the general properties of
the language. (This is a very vague way of stating our programme, but it will become
more definite in what follows.)
Having given up the idea that we know how to classify the signs of a language
𝑆1 into formative and descriptive signs, we shall now start with the (provisional)
assumption that any classification is as good as any other, or, in other words, that we
can classify |
47
the signs of 𝑆1 in as many ways as we like into formative and descriptive
signs. We can start by making first a division in which all signs are descriptive and
none formative; we can make a second division by picking out, quite arbitrarily,
one sign and classify it as formative; a third division may pick out another sign
as formative; a fourth division may pick out perhaps two or three; and so on, until
we obtain, ultimately, a division in which all signs are put into the class labelled
|
48
“formative signs”6. We shall denote the first division – the one in which the class of
formative signs is empty – by the name “𝐷0”, and the last by the name “𝐷𝑧”; and
unspecified divisions will be indicated by “𝐷𝑚”, “𝐷𝑛”, “𝐷𝑝”, “𝐷𝑞”, etc.
Now to each of these divisions – say the division 𝐷𝑛– there will correspond a set
of form-conservative interpretations; form-conservative in the sense that |
49
they are
6 In general, the number 𝑛of different signs will be finite, and therefore the number of different
classifications will be also finite, viz. 2𝑛. But our considerations are not dependent on the assumption
that the number of different signs is finite, or the set of different classifications denumerable.

272
Karl R. Popper
conservative with respect to the class of signs labelled in this division as “formative”.
Accordingly, to each division 𝐷𝑛there will correspond a class Fd of fundamental
classes 𝑀𝑘(where 𝑀𝑘is the class of all statements of 𝑆1 which become true in the
interpretation 𝐼𝑘). In order to indicate that the class Fd corresponds to a certain
division 𝐷𝑛, we shall now replace “Fd” by “Fd𝑛”. Of a class 𝑀which is an element
of Fd𝑛we shall say that it is an 𝑛-fundamental class. (We observe at once that, since
the interpretations corresponding to 𝐷𝑧are |
50
simply the normal translations, Fd𝑧can
have only one element 𝑀, viz., the class of statements which are true in 𝑆1. On the
other hand, the elements of Fd0 are all the various statement classes of 𝑆1.7)
With the help of the concept “Fd𝑛”, we can now restate our definitions (15) and
(16) in a way which makes their relativity, i.e., their dependence on an arbitrary
division 𝐷𝑛, explicit:
(17) The statement 𝑎is logically true on the basis of the division 𝐷𝑛(or in signs,
𝑎𝜖𝐿𝑡𝑛) if and |
51
only if 𝑎is an element of every class 𝑀which is 𝑛-fundamental; or
in signs: 𝑎𝜖𝐿𝑡𝑛≡𝑀𝜖Fd𝑛⊃𝑎𝜖𝑀.
(18) An inference with the premises 𝐴and the conclusion 𝑏is valid on the basis
of the division 𝐷𝑛(in signs 𝐴𝑛→𝑏) if and only if the following holds: if all the
premises in 𝐴belong to some 𝑛-fundamental class, then the conclusion 𝑏belongs to
the same 𝑛-fundamental class; in signs: 𝐴𝑛→𝑏≡𝑀𝜖Fd𝑛⊃(𝐴⊂𝑀⊃𝑏𝜖𝑀).
This explicit recognition of the relativity of Tarski’s concept of inference may now
be used for a solution of our fundamental problem.
8. A Method of an Absolute Characterization of Formative Signs
|
52
On the basis of our explicitly relative concept of inference, we shall now give a
general characterization of signs of a language 𝑆1 which we shall call “absolute
formative signs”. (They must not be confused with Carnap’s “absolute concepts”.)
They are those signs whose meaning or function in 𝐷𝑛of 𝑆1 can be characterized
completely on the basis of our relative concept of inference.

Abstract This is an unpublished article from Popper’s Nachlass.
Editorial notes: The source typescript is from KPS Box 14, Folder 8. It has 8 pages, numbered 1 to 8.
There are numbered references but a list of references is missing. We resolved most of the references
in editorial footnotes. The text makes reference to two previously published papers by Popper on
the same subject. If we exclude “Are Contradictions Embracing?” (Popper, 1943) as a possible
candidate, then the typescript seems to have been written in 1947 after “Logic without Assumptions”
(Popper, 1947b) and “New Foundations for Logic” (Popper, 1947c) had been published, and before
the publication of any of Popper’s other articles. The term “minimum calculus” refers to Johansson’s
(1937) “Minimalkalkül”.

The object of this paper is to investigate the mutual relationships between various
ideas of negation – the classical idea, the intuitionistic idea, two weaker forms, and,
ultimately,the “modal” idea of impossibility. Our results depend upon the employment
of a metalogical method which allows us to give formalized explicit definitions of the
various signs of negation, as well as of the other formative signs of a language.
Our method is entirely metalinguistic; that is to say, we never quote a statement
or even a sign from the object language under consideration. The method has been
explained in some detail, although in an informal way, in (6) and (7).a An outline of a
formalization of this method is given in § 1. In § 2 the main results for classical logic
are summarized. In § 3, we proceed to the discussion of our topic.
§ 1
Our Universe of Discourse are certain expressions of some language 𝐿, viz., the
statements and statement functions of 𝐿and the variables of 𝐿. We denote the class
of statements (statement functions included) of 𝐿by 𝑆, the class of variables by 𝑉.

We shall discuss these entities in a formalized metalanguage which is, essentially,
the language explained by Hilbert Bernays (5)b, but without the use of the sign of
negation. More precisely, we shall assume Hilbert-Bernays axiom-groups I to IV (5,
vol 1, p. 66)c, with the alteration that we use for equivalence the sign “↔”. In addition
we shall use the axioms and rules of inference for quantification, as |
2
developed in
(4)d, (5)e or, for example, (9)f. We use, furthermore, the two termed predicate “=”, as
introduced in (5, vol. 1, p. 165)g, and the sign “≠”, without, however, assuming about
the latter more than that
(𝑥= 𝑦& 𝑥≠𝑦) →𝐴;
that is to say, we do not assume “≠” to be defined by “=” and negation.
As variables we use “𝑎”; “𝑏”,etc. “𝑎1”; “𝑎2” etc; “𝑥”; “𝑦”; “𝑧”; “𝑛”; “𝑤”; “𝑥1”; etc.,
that is to say, lower case italics from the beginning and the end of the alphabet, with
or without numerical subscripts. (For subscripts, we shall use numerical conditions
such as “1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛” etc.) These variables are variable names of the expressions of 𝐿,
that is to say, the values of the variables are expressions (esp. sentences, or variables,
of 𝐿).
Our undefined predicates are (apart from “=” and “≠”): “𝑆”; “𝑉”; and “𝐷”. “𝑆”
and “𝑉” have been explained above; they are one-termed predicates. Instead of “𝑆(𝑎)”
etc. we shall also write 𝑎𝜖𝑆etc. Our most important term is the 𝑛-termed predicate
“𝐷”.
“𝐷(𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)”
asserts that 𝑎0 is deducible from the premises 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛. For various reasons,
I prefer to speak of an 𝑛-termed predicate “𝐷” rather than of an infinite series
of one-termed, two-termed, etc., predicates “𝐷1”; “𝐷2”; etc. This, however, is a
matter of taste, and those who prefer this second mode of speaking, in the meta-
metalanguage, about the predicate or predicates “𝐷”, can easily re-interpret our
assertions in accordance with their preferences.
We do not employ variable predicates in our metalanguage, but only constant
predicates definable in terms of “𝑆”; “𝑉”; and “𝐷”.
|

Although our variables “𝑎”; “𝑥”; etc. are intended to be of one kind, we shall,
for the sake of convenience, use “𝑎”; “𝑏”; etc. as variable names of statement and
statement functions, “𝑥”; “𝑦” etc. as variable names of variables. More precisely, all
our axioms and theorems are understood to be preceded by the suppressed condition:
(1.1)
“𝑎, 𝑏, . . . , 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑑𝑛𝜖𝑆& 𝑥, 𝑦, . . . , 𝑥1, . . . , 𝑤𝑚𝜖𝑉→. . . ”
which assures the appropriate range for the variables. We further assume that 𝑆and
𝑉have no member in common, i.e. we postulate:
b Hilbert and Bernays (1934, 1939).
c Hilbert and Bernays (1934).
d Hilbert and Ackermann (1928)?
e Hilbert and Bernays (1939).
f This reference could not be resolved. Maybe Quine (1940)?
g Hilbert and Bernays (1934).

(1.2)
𝑆. 𝑉= Ó.h
Apart from our simple variables 𝑎, 𝑏𝜖𝑆, we shall also use complex variable names
for statements and statement functions, viz. (A) variable compound names, such as
“𝑎∧𝑏”; “𝑎> 𝑏”; etc., (B) variable names for the result of the substitution of a variable
for another in a statement (function), such as “𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
”, which denotes the result of
substituting 𝑥for 𝑦in the statement (function) 𝑎; and (C) the result of the universal
or existential quantification, say, of 𝑎with regard to 𝑥, which will be written “𝐴𝑥𝑎”
and “𝐸𝑥𝑎” respectively. All these complex variable names of statements may be
substituted for any of the variables “𝑎, 𝑏, . . . 𝜖𝑆”; or more precisely, we have to place,
wherever necessary, before our axioms and theorems the suppressed condition:
(1.3)
𝑎, 𝑏, . . . , 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
, . . . , 𝐴𝑥𝑎, . . . 𝜖𝑆→. . .
So much about our language.
§ 2
The axioms or primitive rules of inference which determine the meaning of “𝐷” are:
𝐷(𝑎𝑖, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)
(1 ≤𝑖≤𝑛)
|

(2.1)
(2.2)
(𝐷(𝑏1, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) & . . . & 𝐷(𝑏𝑚, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)) →(𝐷(𝑐, 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚)
→𝐷(𝑐, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)).
The first may be called the generalized rule of the reflexivity and the second the
generalized rule of the transitivity of the deducibility. These two principles suffice as
a basis for the theory of statement composition (including the theory of modalities).
For the logic of functions, a number of primitive rules must be added which serve
to determine the meaning of “𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
”. They can be more easily formulated if we first
introduce the two termed predicate “𝐷𝐷”;
“𝐷𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)”
asserts that 𝑎and 𝑏are mutually deducible from each other:
Definition:
(2.3)
𝐷𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) ↔𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) & 𝐷(𝑏, 𝑎).
The primitive rules for “𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
” can now be formulated in this way:
𝐷𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏) →𝐷𝐷(𝑎 𝑦

These are all the primitive rules needed as a basis for the (modal as well as
ordinary) logic of the functions of first order.
In what follows, we shall introduce as a graphic abbreviation of the expression
“𝐷(𝑎0, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛)”
the expression
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎0”.
|
5
Similarly, we shall abbreviate the expression
“𝐷𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)”
by writing instead
“𝑎//𝑏”.
This is a deviation from the Hilbert-Bernays method of writing, but it saves
space, and it has the advantage that it makes our meta-linguistic calculus more
readily comparable with the customary object-linguistic one. (For example, “𝑎/𝑏”
corresponds somewhat to “the statement designated by 𝑎strictly implies the statement
designated by 𝑏”; and “𝑎//𝑏” corresponds similarly to strict equivalence.)
Now with the help of “//”, we can give explicit definitions for our complex variables
of kind (A) and (C). The definitions for the compound variable names of statements
of classical logic are (read for “𝑎//𝑏∧𝑐” perhaps “𝑎has the logical force of the
conjunction of 𝑏and of 𝑐”, etc.):
Definition of the Conjunction:

The last definition is perhaps a little complicated, but we must remember that this
one explicit definition replaces both the strong primitive rule of inference and the
complicated primitive proposition |
6
of Nicod. (We must not overlook that Nicod,
just as Russell and Whitehead, make tacit use of our primitive rules 2.1 and 2.2, and
where they deal with functions, also of 2.31 and 2.36.) Definition (2.55) alone suffices
for a basis of the classical theory of statement composition, and so do, for example,
2.1 and 2.4 together. (Cp. also my papers (6) and (7).j)
Some general remarks should be added here about the correspondence between
our metalinguistic calculus and the usual objectlinguistic calculi such as the one of
Russell and Whitehead.
If we denote
“𝑎is demonstrable”
by the sign
“⊢𝑎”
which corresponds closely to the assertion sign of Frege and Russell, then we can
define this symbol as follows:
(2.61)
⊢𝑎↔(𝑏)𝑏/𝑎
In the “𝐷”-notation, we might introduce for “⊢𝑎” a one-termed predicate “𝐷(𝑎)”
by defining:
(2.62)
𝐷(𝑎) ↔(𝑏)𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)
Our various assertions about the sufficiency of our primitive rules and definitions
can now be formulated more precisely:
Our rules and definitions in the sense that, whenever “proportion” such as, for
example,
“𝑝⊃𝑝”
is assertable in the classicalsystem,the demonstrability ofthe corresponding statement,
for example, the formula
“⊢𝑎> 𝑎”
is derivable in our metalinguistic system, from our primitive rules and definitions.
|

A trivial example will explain the situation. By substitution, we obtain from 2.52
and 2.1
(2.71)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
i In the typescript, Popper uses a symbol resembling ↓, which he uses for joint denial in Popper
(1947c), for example. We have replaced it here by the symbol
, which Popper uses elsewhere.
j Probably Popper (1947b) and Popper (1947c).

280
Karl R. Popper
and with the help of either 2.51 or 2.54, we can also obtain the analogous but stronger
rule
(2.72)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐> 𝑑↔𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑑.
Now from 2.71, we obtain, by 𝑐𝑏(“𝑐𝑏” means “substituting 𝑏for 𝑐”; this meta-
metalinguistic description must be distinguished from the metalinguistic “𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
”),
together with 2.1
(2.73)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑏
which can be written
(2.731)
(𝑎)𝑎/𝑏> 𝑏
and therefore by 𝑎𝑏, 𝑏𝑎and 6.1:
(2.732)
⊢𝑎> 𝑎.
The general situation may be summed up as follows: The usual object linguistic
calculi make use of rules of inference and primitive propositions similar to our 2.732.
We use only rules of inference, including definitions in terms of rules of inference.
From these it is possible, with the help of (6.1), to obtain formulae such as 2.732
which correspond to the usual axioms ⟨or⟩theorems.
§ 3
We now proceed to our real object, the comparison of various alternative ideas of
negation. Our main interest is the intuitionistic idea of negation, which will be simply
called “intuitionistic negation”, and denoted by “ 𝑖𝑎”; the second, which will be
discussed at a later stage, will be called “intuitionistic or modal impossibility”, or
briefly, “impossibility”, and denoted by “I 𝑎”. Both concepts seem to me to conform
with intuitionistic ideas; this can be |
8
formally established for the first; but I believe
that the second concept really comes nearer to the intended meaning.
Apart from the intuitionistic negation “ 𝑖𝑎”, and the classical negation which will
be alternatively denoted by “¬𝑎” or “ 𝑐𝑎”, we shall also discuss the negation of
Johansson’s so-called, but not properly so-called, “minimum calculus” (cp. (5, vol. II,
p. 449))k, which will be denoted by “ 𝑚𝑎”, and the negation of an even more reduced
calculus, denoted by “ 𝑟𝑎”.
We shall show that of these negations only “ 𝑖𝑎” and “I 𝑎” can be explicitly defined,
apart from “ 𝑐𝑎”; that “I 𝑎” can occur in every system in which the others occur
without interfering with them; that “ 𝑟𝑎” and “ 𝑚𝑎”, just because they cannot be
explicitly defined, can occur in the same language system with either “ 𝑖𝑎” or “ 𝑐𝑎”;
k Hilbert and Bernays (1939).

281
and that, just because they can be both explicitly defined, “ 𝑖𝑎” and “ 𝑐𝑎”, if they occur
in the same language system, can be proved to be equivalent – in such a way, namely,
that “ 𝑖𝑎” is absorbed, or assimilated in the presence of “ 𝑐𝑎”, by the latter.

A Note on the Classical Conditional
Karl R. Popper
Abstract This is an unpublished article from Popper’s Nachlass.
Editorial notes: There are two typescripts entitled “A Note on the Classical Conditional”, both
in KPS Box 39, Folder 20. Typescript 1 has 8 pages of text plus 4 pages containing 15 footnotes.
The pages are numbered 1 to 12. Typescript 2 has 5 pages numbered 1 to 5. The text contains four
footnote marks, but there is no accompanying sheet of footnotes. The material in Box 39, Folder
19 shows that the typescripts must have been written in January to May 1952 and that they were
presented to some colleagues. In May 1952 Popper sent a version to Joseph H. Woodger for a review;
Woodger’s response can be found in KPS Box 39, Folder 19. However, this version seems to be
different from both typescripts in KPS Box 39, Folder 20, since Woodger’s comments do not match
with the line numbers of these two typescripts. The logical symbols ∧, >, 𝜖, ↔and →were not
available on the typewriter. For ∧, 𝜖and > the typescript shows empty spaces, and for ↔and →it
shows a horizontal line: —. Whereas in Typescript 1 all the logical signs were filled in by hand, in
Typescript 2 this was done only at the beginning, and we thus had to reconstruct the logical signs
by relying on the surrounding text and the logical meaning of the formulas. In most cases this was
unproblematic. In Typescript 1, footnote 14 contains an erroneous repetition: “we can say that in the
presence of one may perhaps say that, in the presence of”. We corrected this to “one may perhaps
say that, in the presence of”. In Typescript 2, rule (5.2) and its explanation appears twice; we have
deleted one occurrence.

There are some logicians – outstanding among them is Brouwer and his school, the
“Intuitionists” – who accept neither the classical truth-table characterization of the
conditional (or hypothetical, or “if-then” statement; misleadingly also called “material
implication”) nor that of negation. Intuitionists have offered very serious arguments to
support their objections, and they may well be right. But there are others who object
to the classical truth-table characterization of “if-then” statements (perhaps because

it seems to them to disagree with the usage of ordinary language) while accepting the
rule1 (implicit in the truth-table of classical negation) that if a statement 𝑎is false, its
negation is true. They are, I believe, mistaken.
It is the purpose of this note to show that, in the presence of classical negation
(and perhaps2 also of conjunction), the truth-table of the classical conditional can be
shown to be valid, provided two rules (2.1 and 2.2, below) concerning the conditional
are granted to be in order – rules which, to my knowledge, have never been seriously
challenged.
The argument amounts to the contention that the so-called “paradoxes of material
implication” are no paradoxes at all but misunderstandings (re-inforced, if not caused,
by the misapplied expression “implies” or “materially implies”) and that those who
object to the classical conditional while accepting classical negation have to say more
precisely whether they object to rule 2.1, and why.
2
There are two rules which appear to be acceptable to the most sensitive analysts
of the conditional, (1) the so-called deduction-theorem and (2) the modus ponendo
ponens (or principle of detachment). It is the contention of this note that (in the
presence of two so far unchallenged rules involving conjunction, viz. the principles
of contraction3 and exportation) these two rules suffice for the derivation of the
truth-table characterization of the classical conditional from that of classical negation.
In order to elucidate my argument, I shall make use of certain abbreviations4. In
what follows, the letters “𝑎”, “𝑏”, “𝑐”, “𝑑”, . . . “𝑥”, “𝑦” . . . etc. serve as variables
whose values are statements (i.e., as variable for which names of statements may be
substituted; only closed statements will be considered). The sign “𝑎> 𝑏” serves as
the name of the conditional with the antecedent 𝑎and the consequent 𝑏, and “¬𝑎” as
the name of the negation of 𝑎. The assertion that 𝑏is logically derivable or deducible
from 𝑎will be expressed by writing 𝑎/𝑏, and the assertion that 𝑐is logically deducible
from the two |
2
premises 𝑎and 𝑏by writing 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, etc. The assertion “the statement
𝑎is logically demonstrable (or logically true)” will be expressed by ⊢𝑎.
Using these abbreviations, we can now state the so-called5 “deduction theorem”
as follows.
1 Compare FT,2, in section 6, below.
2 As will be shown below, the rules 4.1 and 4.2 involving conjunction are only introduced in my
argument in order to derive 3.1 from 2.1. If no objections are raised against 3.1, then the reference to
conjunction can be avoided altogether. See also note 14, below.
3 So called because it allows us to contract two premises into one, viz. their conjunction. Cp. 4.1
below and my article ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩, p. 233, rule (3.4).
4 Most of the abbreviations used here have been also used by me in the article ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩
referred to in the preceding footnote.
5 The name was introduced in ⟨Hilbert and Bernays, 1934⟩, p. 155. The provisos there made are
clearly unnecessary here since we are concerned here with closed statements only (as opposed to
open statement functions). Moreover, the provisos turn out to be unnecessary in any case, if we keep

285
(2.1)
If 𝑎/𝑏then ⊢𝑎> 𝑏
in words, “If 𝑏is logically deducible from 𝑎, then the conditional statement 𝑎> 𝑏,
with 𝑎as antecedent and 𝑏as consequent, is logically true (or demonstrable).”
Similarly, the modus ponens, commonly expressed in a notation like the following
𝑎
𝑎> 𝑏
𝑏
can now be written in the form
(2.2)
𝑎, 𝑎> 𝑏/𝑏.
It may be remarked that incidentally, a corollary of the modus ponens is the
following
(2.21)
If ⊢𝑎> 𝑏then 𝑎/𝑏,
owing to the fact6 that a premise, if logically true (or demonstrable) may be omitted
from an inference without impairing its validity. Although 2.21 is a little weaker than
2.2, it can replace 2.2 in our argument (in the presence of 4.1 and 4.2). I mention this
fact here without proof, and I shall base our considerations on 2.2 rather than on 2.21.
But I should like to mention that 2.2 and 2.1 can be combined into
(2.3)
⊢𝑎> 𝑏if and only if 𝑎/𝑏,
which too is sometimes called “deduction theorem” and which is not only valid for the
ordinary conditional but which, I believe, expresses fully the tendencies underlying
the idea of “strict implication”.7
in mind the difference between “𝑎/𝑏” and “If ⊢𝑎then ⊢𝑏”; cp. my remarks on p. 232 of New
Foundations for Logic ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩, referred to in footnote 3 above.
6 This fact (cp. rule (8.2) on p. 232 of my above mentioned article ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩) can be easily
proved with the help of of the transitivity principle and the formal definition of demonstrability. But
although 2.21 is used below in 4.5, neither 2.21 nor 4.5 form an essential part of our argument; both
are referred to only incidentally, and need therefore not be proved here.
7 If “𝑁𝑎” is the name of the statement asserting that what is stated by 𝑎is logically necessary, then
we have (cp. ⟨Carnap, 1946⟩, p. 36, C1-2)
(•)
⊢𝑁𝑎if and only if ⊢𝑎
This, together with 2.3, yields
(• •)
⊢𝑁𝑎> 𝑏if and only if 𝑎/𝑏
where “𝑁𝑎> 𝑏” is the name of the strict implication with the antecedent 𝑎and the consequent 𝑏.
We see from this that 2.3 remains valid even if we interpret 𝑎> 𝑏as a strict implication rather than
as an ordinary If-then statement. See also note 14 below.

In order to achieve our aim, i.e. in order to show that the truth-table characterization
can be obtained from that of classical negation, we need, as mentioned, in addition
to 2.1 and 2.2, two rules (to be numbered 4.1 and 4.2) involving conjunction. The
role of these two rules 4.1 and 4.2 in our argument is, however, restricted to the
derivation, from 2.1 and 2.2, of a rule 3.1 which does not involve conjunction, viz. of
the following slightly strengthened form of 2.1, the deduction theorem:
(3.1)
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐
in words: “If 𝑐can be deduced from the premises 𝑎and 𝑏, then 𝑏> 𝑐can be deduced
from the single premise 𝑎.” (Example: If “Socrates is |
3
mortal” can be deduced from
the two premises “All men are mortal” and “Socrates is a man”, then the conditional
“If Socrates is a man then Socrates is mortal” can be deduced from “All men are
mortal”.)
Rules 3.1 and 2.2 are sufficient for our purpose. It may be mentioned, however,
that for reasons of symmetry, 2.2 may be replaced by the equivalent rule (which is
the converse of 3.1):
(3.2)
If 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐then 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
This rule can be obtained from 2.2 as follows. We first have
(3.21)
If 𝑥, 𝑏/𝑐then, if 𝑎/𝑥then 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
This rule is one of the forms of the principle of transitivity of deducibility; it is
demonstrable8. It asserts that, if 𝑎/𝑥, i.e., if 𝑎is logically stronger than 𝑥(or at least as
8 For other forms of the transitivity principle cp. pp. 197ff. of my above quoted article ⟨Popper,
1947c⟩. Rule 3.21 is not only valid, but it can be proved to be absolutely valid, i.e. valid irrespective
of the logical form of the statements involved. For the concept of absolute validity, cp. my paper
Logic without Assumptions ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩, esp. p. 277. (The definition, in note 12 on this page, of
the absolute validity of a rule of inference covers unconditional rules of inference, such as “𝑎/𝑎” or
“𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎” (cp. the next note and section 7). In order to cover conditional rules of inference (with
one or more antecedents), such as 3.21, the following obvious definition should be added to this
note. “A conditional rule of inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, every statement preserving
counter-example of the consequent of the rule is a statement preserving counter example of (at least
one of) its antecedent(s).” It then becomes quite clear that (as is indicated the first italicized phrase
on p. 285 of Logic without Assumptions ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩) an inference, or a rule of inference, is
absolutely valid if, and only if, it is valid irrespective of the logical form of the statements involved.
Of course, every inference or rule of inference which is absolutely valid can be shown to be valid.
I may perhaps point out that the criticism ⟨McKinsey, 1948⟩of “Logic without Assumptions”
⟨Popper, 1947b⟩and of my paper ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩quoted above is invalid as it stands (I do not, of
course, wish to assert that no valid criticism of some of the points of these papers can be made).
It is based, apart from other misunderstandings, on an interpretation of my notation “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐” or
“𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” which is contrary to my explicit and repeated explanation (see for example (2) on
p. 261 and p. 277 of “Logic without Assumptions” ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩, pp. 194f. of my article ⟨Popper,
1947c⟩, and the explanation given in the present paper) that “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐” is simply an abbreviation of

287
strong as 𝑥), then we can replace, in an inference 𝑥, 𝑏/𝑐, the premise 𝑥by 𝑎, without
impairing the validity of the inference. From 3.21 we obtain, by substituting “𝑏> 𝑐”
for “𝑥”
(3.211)
If 𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐then, if 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐then 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
On the other hand, the modus ponens, 2.2 can be written
(3.22)
𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐
But 3.211 and 3.22 yield 3.2.
Since I mentioned that 3.2 and 2.2 are equivalent, I may indicate that 2.2 can be,
in its turn, obtained from 3.2 by substituting in 3.2 “𝑏> 𝑐” for “𝑎” and combining
the result with
(3.231)
𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏> 𝑐
which is obtained by substitution from the “absolutely valid rule”9
(3.23)
𝑎/𝑎
Rules 3.1 and 3.2 can be combined into one, by writing
(3.3)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐if and only if 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
Either 3.3, i.e. 3.1 and 3.2, or 3.1 and 2.2, suffice for our purpose.
the (metalinguistic) statement or rule “𝑐can be deduced or derived from the two premises 𝑎and
𝑏” (or “𝑐follows from these premises”). It simply states that there is an inference, and must be
therefore clearly distinguished from the assertion that a certain inference is valid. “By an inference,
valid or invalid, we shall understand . . . a number of statements . . . of which one is marked out
for a conclusion and the others for premises (for example, by writing the conclusion last, below a
horizontal line, etc.)”, I wrote on p. 261 of “Logic without Assumptions” ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩. (Italics
added now.) The question whether such an inference is valid (which is the same as the question
whether the statement which states that there is an inference is true) is a question belonging to the
semantics of the metalanguage in which the inference is stated, and to which the sign “/” belongs.
(This is stated explicitly in note 18 on p. 280 of “Logic without Assumptions” ⟨Popper, 1947b⟩.) It
is therefore hardly adequate to say of my notation, as the reviewer does, “it is not clear, however,
whether this notation is intended to indicate arbitrary inferences or is to be restricted to absolutely
valid inferences”. (Note also that in the article ⟨Popper, 1947c⟩which introduces the same notation
absolute validity plays no role whatever.) But with the realization that my concepts “valid” and
“absolutely valid” are to be clearly distinguished from “/”, the reviewers criticism collapses. My
definiendum “valid” and my defining terms “absolutely valid” (or “absolutely valid rules”) and
“inferential definition” all belong to the meta-metalanguage (as pointed out in several places, e.g. in
note 18 on p. 280), and the dilemma which the reviewer finds, owing to his belief that “/” is one of
the defining terms, never arises.
9 The rules “𝑎/𝑎” and “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎” or “𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏” (cp. 3.23 and 7.2; 6.11 and 7.1; and 5.11) are, as
mentioned in the preceding note, absolutely valid, and this fact can be easily demonstrated. Those
who, like Professor G. E. Moore, feel uneasy about “𝑎/𝑎” and doubt whether we can deduce a
statement from itself, are simply mistaken. The reasons underlying their misgivings are discussed in
section 7, below.

Those who accept 2.1 and 2.2 but are doubtful about 3.1 may be perhaps persuaded
into accepting 3.1 once they have satisfied themselves that 3.1 can be obtained from
2.1 and 2.2 with the help of the following two rules of involving conjunction (we use
“𝑎∧𝑏” as the name of the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏). The first is the extremely trivial
principle of contraction (of contracting two premises into one): |
4
(4.1)
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐
in words, if 𝑐can be deduced from the two premises 𝑎and 𝑏then it can also be
deduced from the single premise which is the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏.
The second is the well-known rule of exportation:
(4.2)
If ⊢(𝑎∧𝑏) > 𝑐then ⊢𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐)
Combining 4.1 with 2.1 (after substituting in 2.1 “𝑎∧𝑏” for “𝑎” and “𝑐” for “𝑏”) we
obtain
(4.3)
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐then ⊢(𝑎∧𝑏) > 𝑐
and further, with the help of 4.2,
(4.4)
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐then ⊢𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐)
From 2.1 (a consequence of the modus ponens, as mentioned above) we obtain, by
substituting “𝑏> 𝑐” for “𝑏”
(4.5)
If /𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐) then 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐
Combining 4.4 and 4.5, we obtain 3.1.
5
We now consider the following consequence of 3.1
(5.1)
𝑏/𝑎> 𝑏
is far from self-evident, but which nevertheless can be obtained by substituting, in
3.1, “𝑎” for “𝑏” and “𝑏” for “𝑎” and for “𝑐”, and by combining the result with
(5.11)
𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏,
i.e. one of the demonstrably valid10 rules of inference.
10 Cp. the preceding footnote, and the discussion in section 7, below.

17 A Note on the Classical Conditional
289
We shall show, in this section, that the first and the third lines of the classical truth-
table of the conditional are a consequence of 5.1, and the second line a consequence
of the modus ponens 2.2.
The truth-table characterization of the classical conditional (for short, TFTT) is
as follows

This table has to be read, each line, from the left to the right, in the way indicated
by the following example
Line 3 of (TFTT) reads “If 𝑎is false and 𝑏is true, then 𝑎> 𝑏is true.”
Using obvious abbreviations, we can write:
(TFTT,3)
If 𝑎𝜖𝐹and 𝑏𝜖𝑇then 𝑏> 𝑐𝜖𝑇.
|
5
In order to obtain (TFTT,1) and (TFTT,3) from 5.1, we merely consider the
principle that, if an inference is valid and the premise(s) are true, the conclusion must
be true.
Assume 𝑏𝜖𝑇; it is clear that, in view of this principle and 5.1, 𝑎> 𝑏𝜖𝑇, whether
𝑎𝜖𝑇or 𝑎𝜖𝐹. Thus we have indeed
If 𝑎𝜖𝑇and 𝑏𝜖𝑇then 𝑏> 𝑐𝜖𝑇.
(TFTT,1)
If 𝑎𝜖𝐹and 𝑏𝜖𝑇then 𝑏> 𝑐𝜖𝑇.
(TFTT,3)
Next, we consider the modus ponens 2.2, in the form
(5.2)
𝑎, 𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏
Assume 𝑏𝜖𝐹. Then, clearly, at least one of the two premises, either 𝑎or 𝑎> 𝑏,
must be false too (since if both were true, 𝑏would have to be true). Accordingly, if
𝑎𝜖𝑇, we obtain 𝑎> 𝑏𝜖𝐹, i.e.
(TFTT,2)
If 𝑎𝜖𝑇and 𝑏𝜖𝐹then 𝑏> 𝑐𝜖𝐹.
We find that 5.1 which is a consequence of 3.1 and the modus ponens 2.2 allow us
to establish lines 1 to 3 of the truth-table (TFTT).
It may be remarked that all the argumentation and the results obtained so far allow
of an intuitionistically valid interpretation11.
11 The three first lines of (TFTT) become intuitionistically valid if we interpret “𝑎𝜖𝑇” as “𝑎is
logically necessary” (or “demonstrable”), and “𝑎𝜖𝐹” as the intuitionistic negation of “𝑎𝜖𝑇”,
i.e. as “it is impossible that 𝑎is necessary” or in other words, as “𝑎is not necessary” (or “non-

This allows us to assert
(6.01)
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑐, 𝑏/¬𝑎
a principle much used in the classical theory of “indirect reduction”.12 We can
establish 6.1 by considering that, if “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐” is valid and the conclusion 𝑐false, either
𝑎or 𝑏must be false, so that ¬𝑎follows from ¬𝑐and 𝑏.
Substituting in 6.01 “𝑎” for “𝑐”, and “𝑐” for “𝑏”, we obtain
(6.02)
If 𝑎, 𝑐/𝑎then ¬𝑎, 𝑎/¬𝑐
If with this we combine
(6.11)
𝑎, 𝑐/𝑎
which, of course, is the same rule as 5.11, then we get
(6.12)
¬𝑎, 𝑎/¬𝑐
and, by 3.1 (and appropriate substitution in 3.1)
(6.13)
¬𝑎/𝑎> ¬𝑐
Here we can further substitute “¬𝑏” for “𝑐”; we obtain |
6
(6.14)
¬𝑎/𝑎> ¬¬𝑏
All this is intuitionistically valid. An intuitionistically invalid argument allows us
to replace, in view of the truth-table (FT), “¬¬𝑏” by “𝑏”; the result which corresponds
to 5.1, viz.
(6.1)
¬𝑎/𝑎> 𝑏
demonstrable”). Under this interpretation, the last line of (TFTT) is clearly incorrect, since even on
the classical interpretation, not every if-then statement whose antecedent and consequent are both
non-necessary is true (to say nothing of necessarily true).
12 It allows us to say that, if a syllogism 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐is valid, the syllogism whose premises consist of the
negation or contradictory of the original conclusion and one of the original premises, and whose
conclusion is the contradictory of the other original premise, must be valid too.

happens nevertheless to be again intuitionistically valid. To this result we now apply
line 2 (which is intuitionistically invalid) of the truth-table (FT)
(FT,2)
If 𝑎𝜖𝐹then ¬𝑎𝜖𝑇
Assume 𝑎𝜖𝐹; then, by (FT,2), ¬𝑎𝜖𝑇, and in view of 6.1, 𝑎> 𝑏𝜖𝑇. Thus we
obtain irrespective of the truth or falsity of 𝑏,
(6.2)
If 𝑎𝜖𝐹then 𝑎> 𝑏𝜖𝑇
But this establishes lines 3 and 4 of (TFTT).
We have thus completed the derivation of (TFTT). Our argument, up and inclusive
6.1, allows of an intuitionistically valid interpretation. But 6.2, based on the truth-table
(FT) for classical negation and with it, line 4 of (TFTT), are intuitionistically invalid.
7
It is a fact that 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, and 4.2 are intuitively convincing to some philosophers to
whom even the first three lines of (TFTT) are highly suspect; but we have shown that
these three lines depend upon 3.1 and 2.2, and therefore on 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, and 4.2. It is
also a fact that some of these philosophers accept the truth-table of negation (FT),
but are highly suspicious of line 4 of (TFTT). If we trace back our steps, we shall find,
I believe, that line 2 of (TFTT) is usually felt to be ⟨as⟩unobjectionable as the modus
ponens from which we derived it; it is lines 1, 3, and 4 of (TFTT) which are felt to be
objectionable, and so are 5.1 and 6.1, from which lines 1, 3, and 4 can be derived.
Let us therefore consider the derivation of these two objectionable rules, 5.1 and
6.1. Both their derivations depend upon 6.11 which may be rewritten
(7.1)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎
It seems to me that it is this rule which causes the trouble. It is a rule which, like
the rule 4, i.e.
(7.2)
𝑎/𝑎
is never used in the ordinary every day reasoning. We do not ordinarily deduce
“Socrates is mortal” from the two premises “Socrates is mortal” and “Peter is stingy”;
nor do we ordinarily deduce “Socrates is mortal” |
7
from the single premise “Socrates
is mortal”. Nevertheless, such deductions are undoubtedly valid13, since they will
unfailingly lead to a true conclusion whenever the premise(s) is (or are all) true. The
13 They are even valid irrespective of the logical form of the statements involved, i.e. absolutely
valid; and this means that every (statement preserving) interpretation which renders all the premises
true must also render the conclusion true. Thus truth is “necessarily” transmitted from the premises
to the conclusion – which means that the conclusion can be validly derived from the premises. Cp.
notes 9 and 10 above.

Karl R. Popper
reason why these inferences are intuitively unconvincing is, simply, due to the fact
that they are not ordinarily used; not because of their unreliability, but rather because
of their excessive triviality. They are never needed, except, of course, in such technical
arguments as those which we are carrying out here. But although they are intuitively
unsatisfactory, they are unavoidable consequences of intuitively satisfactory rules.
For example, 7.2 is an unavoidable consequence of the transitivity principle in the
form
(7.3)
If 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑎/𝑐
together with the ordinarily accepted rules (of which the second, however, is intu-
itionistically invalid)
(7.4)
𝑎/¬¬𝑎and ¬¬𝑎/𝑎
as one sees at once by substituting “¬¬𝑎” for “𝑏” and “𝑎” for “𝑐” in 7.3.
The fact that 7.2 unavoidable follows from 7.3 and 7.4 shows that in these matters
we cannot rely on intuition based upon ordinary usage; the simple reason being that
intuition based on ordinary usage becomes unreliable in all those borderline cases
for which there is no ordinary usage (for example because of their triviality). I call
these borderline cases “zero-cases”, because the question whether or not 𝑎can be
validly deduced from 𝑎is, in the ordinary usage of the word “deduced” as queer and
as unsatisfactory as the question whether or not zero is a number (“I have a number
of books” – “How many?” – “Zero”.) What I wished to suggest in this note is that,
owing to the connection between (TFTT) and the zero-case rules 7.1 and 7.2, (TFTT)
itself is of the zero-case character and that, therefore, intuitive objections to lines 1,
3, and 4 of (TFTT) (except these which are based upon a rejection of FT) may be
dismissed, as long as they are not substantiated by an intuitive criticism of 2.1, 4.1,
and 4.214.
14 If we consider the following three concepts (a) strict implication, characterized in note 7 above,
(b) the intuitionistic conditional (called by Hilbert-Bernays, “positive identical implication”) and (c)
the classical conditional, then one may perhaps say that, in the presence of the modus ponens 2.2, (a)
corresponds to 2.1 in a similar way in which (b) corresponds to 3.1 and (c) to 8.01.
Indeed, 4.2 is characteristic of the difference between 2.1 and 3.1⟨, and⟩is not valid for strict
implication (its converse is, however, valid); nor is the deduction theorem in the form 3.1 valid
for strict implication. (This was shown by Ruth C. Barcan ⟨Barcan, 1946, p. 117⟩, with the help
of a matrix given by ⟨Parry, 1934⟩. Ruth Barcan does not, however, mention the validity of the
deduction theorem for one premise (or one “hypothesis”), i.e. of 2.1. Were 3.1 (or 4.2) true of a
strict implication, then this strict implication would be the same as the intuitionist conditional, since
all positive identical formulae involving the conditional can be obtained from 3.3 alone (i.e. from
3.1 and 2.2, using, in addition, only absolutely valid rules, i.e. rules involving no reference to logical
form). Similarly, FT,2 is invalid for the intuitionist conditional, and so is 8.01, 8.11 and 8.22 (because
the idea of a generalized inference involves a kind of “or” which, because of its connection with the
law of the Excluded Middle, is intuitionistically unacceptable).

This concludes my main argument. By way of an appendix, I wish to state briefly a
further method of obtaining the truth-table TFTT from one simple rule of inference.
The first method is based upon a generalization of the idea of inference. We make
use of a notation which allows us to write more than one conclusion on the right hand
side of “/”; we may confine ourselves to two conclusions, and write |
8
(•)
𝑎/𝑏, 𝑐
or perhaps with two premises
(• •)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑
in orderto express the idea thatthese statements have sucha logicalform that,whenever
all the premises are true, at least one of the conclusions (i.e. of the statements on the
right of “/”) must be true too. We can read (• •) roughly “c or d is deducible from the
two premises, 𝑎and 𝑏”.
Making use of this notation, we can now formulate three rules which are, as it
were, generalizations of 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, viz.:
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑then 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑑
(8.01)
If 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑑then 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑
(8.02)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑑if and only if 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑
(8.03)
I shall show that from 8.01 we can obtain lines 1, 3 and 4 of (TFTT), and from
8.02 (as from 3.2) line 2, so that we can obtain the whole of (TFTT) from 8.03.15
By an argument exactly analogous to the one developed in section 5, we obtain
(using the absolutely valid rule “𝑏, 𝑎/𝑏, 𝑑”)
(8.1)
𝑏/𝑎> 𝑏, 𝑑
and, assuming 𝑑𝜖𝐹, we obtain as before (TFTT,1) and (TFTT,3).
In order to obtain line 4 from 8.01, we substitute in 8.01 “𝑏” for “𝑐”; “𝑐” for
“𝑎”; and “𝑎” for “𝑏” and “𝑑”. The result, together with the (absolutely valid rule
“𝑐, 𝑎/𝑏, 𝑎” yields
(8.11)
𝑐/𝑎> 𝑏, 𝑎
Assuming 𝑐𝜖𝑇, we obtain lines 3 and 4 of (TFTT).
Line 2 may be obtained by deriving from 8.02 the following generalization of the
modus ponens (the derivation is exactly analogous to the one of 3.22 from 3.2)
(8.22)
𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑
Assuming 𝑑𝜖𝐹, we obtain line 2 of (TFTT).
15 For the idea of absolute validity see footnotes 8, 9, and 13 above.

A Note on the Classical Conditional (Typescript 2)
1
1
The conditional or hypothetical statement, or “If-then”-statement, has given rise to a
great deal of discussion among logicians, from ancient to very recent times. This note
does not attempt to argue in favour of any one solution, but it attempts to clear up
some of the issues involved by showing that those who wish to reject the truth-table
characterization of the classical conditional (i.e. that characterisation which has
been associated with the unfortunate name “material implication”) are unavoidably
committed to rejecting things which they do not, as a rule, wish to reject.
2
The following rule (R) appears to be acceptable to the most sensitive analysts of the
conditional:
The conditional with the antecedent 𝑎and the consequent 𝑏is logically true (or
tautological; or demonstrable; or analytic; etc.) if and only if 𝑏is deducible from 𝑎
(or derivable from 𝑎; or logically implied or entailed by 𝑎).
If1,a we abbreviate “if and only if” by “↔”; if we write “𝑎/𝑏” for “the statement 𝑏
is derivable from the statement 𝑎”; if we write “⊢𝑎” for “𝑎is demonstrable” (or “𝑎
is analytic” etc.); and if we use “𝑎> 𝑏” to denote the conditional with the antecedent
𝑎and the consequent 𝑏, then the above rule (R) can be written:
(R)
⊢𝑎> 𝑏↔𝑎/𝑏
I believe that few object to (R). The main object of this note is to analyse the
conditions under which (R) can be shown to be equivalent to the well-known truth
table of the classical conditional (to be denoted by “TTC”) to which so many
philosophers have objected.

established in footnote 1, and that from 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑎and the end of footnote 1 the following is obtained:
𝑎𝜖𝑇→𝑏> 𝑎𝜖𝑇(5.7).

the right; line 1, for example: “If 𝑎is true and 𝑏is true, than 𝑎> 𝑏is true.” This last
assertion shall be abbreviated by writing:
“(𝑎𝜖𝑇& 𝑏𝜖𝑇) →𝑎> 𝑏𝜖𝑇”
3
We first show that in the presence of certain rules concerning conjunction which,
to my knowledge, have never been challenged, (R) is equivalent to another (and
somewhat more powerful) rule (R+), viz. to the rule
(R+)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
Here “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐” abbreviates the assertion that 𝑐can be validly deduced from the
two premises, 𝑎and 𝑏. Accordingly, whenever 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, then, if 𝑎is true and 𝑏is true,
𝑐must also be true; and whenever 𝑐is false, then at least one of the two premises
must be false.
4
|
2
The rules concerning conjunction which are necessary and sufficient for establishing
the equivalence of (R) and (R+) are the following two rules, 4.1 and 4.2.
(4.1)
⊢(𝑎∧𝑏) > 𝑐↔⊢𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐)
Here 𝑎∧𝑏denotes the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏. 4.1 is the well-known rule of
exportation and importation. It happens, in its turn, to be a consequence of (R+) and
the following extremely trivial rule:
(4.2)
𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
in words “𝑐is derivable from the one premise which is the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏if
and only if it is derivable from the two premises, 𝑎and 𝑏.” The triviality of this is
admitted; but triviality of a rule is no reason to suspect its correctness.
The derivation of (R+) from (R) with the help of 4.1 and 4.2 is easy. We obtain
from (R) by substituting “𝑎∧𝑏” for “𝑎” and “𝑐” for “𝑏”:
(4.3)
⊢(𝑎∧𝑏) > 𝑐↔𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐
Transforming the left hand side of 4.3 with the help of 4.1 and the right hand side
with the help of 4.2 we obtain
(4.4)
⊢𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐) ↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐

296
Karl R. Popper
We obtain, again, from (R) by substituting 𝑏> 𝑐for 𝑏:
(4.5)
⊢𝑎> (𝑏> 𝑐) ↔𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐
Transforming the left hand side of 4.4 with the help of 4.5, we obtain (R+).
5
We shall now show that (R+) entails the first three lines of the truth table of the
classical conditional (TTC). We shall use for this purpose the following general rules
5.1 to 5.4:
(5.1)
𝑎/𝑎
this has been established in footnote 1.
(5.2)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐↔𝑏, 𝑎/𝑐
i.e., the order of the premises does not affect the validity of a derivation.
(5.3)
𝑎/𝑐→𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
i.e. strengthening of the premises does not make a valid derivation invalid.
(5.4)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎and 𝑏, 𝑎/𝑎
This can be obtained from 5.1 to 5.3. We now obtain from (R+) by substituting “𝑐”
for “𝑎”:
(5.5)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑎↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑎
This yields, together with 5.4
(5.6)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑎
|
3
From this, and the end of footnote 1, we obtain
(5.7)
𝑎𝜖𝑇→𝑏> 𝑎𝜖𝑇
Result: We have established lines 1 and 3 of the truth table of the classical conditional.

17 A Note on the Classical Conditional
297
6∗b
We now obtain from (R+), by substituting “𝑏> 𝑐” for “𝑎”:
(6.1∗)
𝑏> 𝑐/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐
Applying to this 5.1, we obtain the following assertion of the modus ponens:
(6.2∗)
𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐
Now assume 𝑏𝜖𝑇, 𝑐𝜖𝐹, i.e. the case of line 2 of TTC. The conclusion being false,
one of the premises must be false, and since 𝑏is true, 𝑏> 𝑐must be false.
Result: we have established line 2 of the truth table of the classical conditional.
It may be remarked that the results so far established hold for intuitionist logic;
more precisely under the assumption that “𝑎𝜖𝑇” is interpreted as “the necessity of 𝑎
is true” and “𝑎𝜖𝐹” as “the necessity of 𝑎is false” while ¬𝑎𝜖𝑇, i.e. the truth of the
negation of 𝑎is to be interpreted as that of the impossibility of 𝑎.
6
In order to derive the fourth and last line of the truth table of the classical conditional,
we shall introduce ¬𝑎, i.e. the negation of 𝑎. For ¬𝑎we have the following rule2
(6.1)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, ¬𝑐/¬𝑏
This yields, together with (R+), the following principle (used in “indirect reduction”)
(6.2)
𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐↔𝑎, ¬𝑐/¬𝑏
and, substituting “¬𝑏” for “𝑎”
(6.3)
¬𝑏/𝑏> 𝑐↔¬𝑏, ¬𝑐/¬𝑏
The right hand side of this is true by 5.4, and we obtain
(6.4)
¬𝑏/𝑏> 𝑐
a rule which happens to be intuitionistically valid, and which we may have obtained
from assumptions which are weaker than 6.2. Only 6.4 and 6.5 are needed for the
result to be established.
2 ⟨Footnote missing⟩
b In Popper’s typescript both this and the next section are numbered 6. We name this section 6∗
and use rule numbers (6.1∗) and (6.2∗) instead of the original numbers (6.1) and (6.2), respectively.
Further references to rules 6.1 etc. all refer to the rules given in the next section.

298
Karl R. Popper
In addition to 6.4 we need the following rule which is part (i.e. line 2) of the truth
table of classical negation:
(6.5)
𝑏𝜖𝐹↔¬𝑏𝜖𝑇,
in words, if 𝑏is false, non-𝑏is true. This rule, in spite of its apparent triviality,
is crucial for obtaining line 4 of the truth table of the classical conditional. It is
intuitionistically invalid. (The |
4
reason is that from the falsity of the necessity of
𝑏, i.e. from its non-necessity, we cannot conclude to the truth of its impossibility).
Assuming 6.5, we obtain from 6.4 immediately:
(6.6)
𝑏𝜖𝐹↔𝑏> 𝑐𝜖𝑇.
Result: we have established line 4 (and 3) of the truth table of the classical conditional.
7
General results. It is to be noted that some of the so-called “paradoxes of the classical
conditional” are contained in the (intuitionistically valid) lines 1 and 3 of its truth
table TTC. Those who dislike these paradoxes are bound to reject (R+), and, if they
assert (R), also at least one of the rules for conjunction 4.3 or 4.4.
Those who object to line 4 of the truth table are bound to reject at least either 6.4
or 6.5. The rejection of either 5.1, 5.2, or 5.3 which, of course, would do the trick,
does not appear to me an alternative to be seriously entertained, in spite of the fact
that it has been entertained by some philosophers; for these rules can be easily shown
not only to be valid rules of inference, but even to be “absolutely valid”.3
It appears to me that (R), 4.3 and 4.4; 6.1 and 6.5 are in accordance with “ordinary
language”, whatever may be meant by this phrase. This would establish that, in spite
of all appearance to the contrary, the truth table interprets the meaning of “if-then”
statements of “ordinary language”, provided such a language is used consistently.
A kind of ad-hominem argument tending into the same direction is this. The modus
ponens, i.e. 6.2, is fairly generally accepted (and so is line 2 of the truth table TTC,
which is immediately obtainable from the modus ponens). Now it can be shown that
(R+) characterizes the conditional as the logically weakest of all components which
satisfies the modus ponens, or as a statement which follows from every compound
statement that satisfies the modus ponens. But the usual doubts about the conditional
are often expressed in the form: “This argument of yours may be valid, perhaps, if
your conditional is the classical one (or is identical with material implication), but
it is not valid if we assume another meaning of the conditional, implying that this
other meaning is a logically weaker one.” But this is certainly mistaken, as long as
the modus ponens is considered a valid argument.
I may briefly show why (R+) has the alleged force. Assume 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐) to be a
3 ⟨Footnote missing⟩

17 A Note on the Classical Conditional
299
compound (not necessarily a truth function) of 𝑏and 𝑐. We say that 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐) satisfies
the modus ponens if and only if
𝑏, 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐)/𝑐.
It is clear that 𝑏> 𝑐satisfies the modus ponens in the sense defined; and it is also
clear that every statement 𝑎which is stronger than 𝑏> 𝑐, i.e. every statement 𝑎for
which 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐hold⟨s⟩, must satisfy the modus ponens in the sense defined; for if the
modus ponens is valid, i.e. if
𝑏> 𝑐, 𝑏/𝑐
and if 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐, then 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐must also be valid (because we have strengthened |
5
the
premises of the modus ponens; “stronger” is here always short for “stronger or at least
equal in strength”).
In the light of this consideration, we can characterise 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐) as the weakest
statement satisfying the modus ponens by stating (a) that every statement 𝑎which
satisfies the modus ponens is at least as strong as, or stronger than, 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐), i.e. by
(•)
𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐→𝑎/ 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐)
and by stating that every statement 𝑎which is stronger than 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐), i.e. by
(• •)
𝑎/ 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐) →𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐
But (•) and (• •) together constitute a rule identical with (R+), but for the substitution
of “𝑏> 𝑐” for 𝑓(𝑏, 𝑐). Accordingly, (R+) characterizes the classical conditional as
the weakest of those compounds of 𝑏and 𝑐which satisfy the modus ponens.
8
A remark on Intuitionism may be made in conclusion. While contending that the
truth table of the classical conditional does not, upon closer inspection, conflict with
the usages of an “ordinary language”, the tendencies and the consistently developed
usages of an ordinary language, I am very ready to admit with the Intuitionists
(Brouwer, Heyting) that “ordinary language” usages involve us into difficulties when
problems of infinities are involved, and that we may have to sacrifice classical negation,
with its characteristic truth table, and especially ⟨6.5⟩(and the law of the excluded
middle). In such an intuitionistic logic, however, (R+) remains valid, and with it the
first three lines (properly interpreted) of the truth table of the classical conditional.4

Three Notes on Derivation and Demonstration
Karl R. Popper
Abstract These are three unpublished notes from Popper’s Nachlass.
Editorial notes: The first note (§ 18.1) is a manuscript entitled “Derivation and Demonstration
in Propositional and Functional Logic” from KPS Box 36, Folder 20. The second note (§ 18.2)
is an untitled manuscript, also from KPS Box 36, Folder 20, to which we give the title “The
Distinction Between Derivation and Demonstration”. The third note (§ 18.3) is a typescript entitled
“The Propositional and Functional Logic of Derivation and of Demonstration” from KPS Box 36,
Folder 21. These notes were probably written in 1946 or 1947 since some of their content can also
be found in Popper (1947c, § 8). They may represent a first draft of a planned paper on derivation
and demonstration that never materialized. In a letter to John C. Eccles of 10 November 1946 Popper
(1946b) writes: “[. . .] at present I am writing a paper on ‘Derivation & Demonstration’. It is a
really important paper, strange as it may sound that there should be anything important in this field.”
(communicated to us by Brian Boyd). We use the symbol ⇐⇒instead of Popper’s ⇆, and =⇒
instead of his ⇒. In the first note footnote 1 is missing, and in the third note all footnotes are missing;
we indicate this by writing “⟨Footnote missing⟩”.
18.1 Derivation and Demonstration in Propositional and
Functional Logic
1.
1
The distinction between derivation and proof has been recently emphasized by
Carnap1. The concepts of derivation and of demonstration (or absolute logical
proof) as analysed in the present paper will be found to be only partly in agreement
with Carnap’s, although they realize at least some of his intentions, and vindicate a
considerable number of his formulations. Yet it will be shown that, if contradictions
are to be avoided, at least in the field of functional logic, a sharper distinction between
rules of derivation and (conditional) rules of proof must be made than that which has
been made by Carnap.

2. All symbols used in this paper belong to the metalanguage (or higher languages).
It is therefore unnecessary to use Gothic letters. Using lower case italics from the
beginning of the alphabet as variable names of statements or formulae of the object
language, we shall write “𝑎→𝑏” for “from 𝑎follows 𝑏” (or “𝑏is derivable or
deducible from 𝑎”), and “𝑎& 𝑏→𝑏” for “from the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏follows
𝑏”, etc., and “↦→𝑎” for “𝑎is proved” (or “𝑎is demonstrable” or “𝑎is logically true”
or “𝑎is L-true”). The words “if . . . then . . .” (of the metalanguage) will be often
replaced by “. . . =⇒. . .”; “if and only if” by “⇐⇒”. The distinction between a
rule of derivation and a conditional rule of proof (or of demonstration) referred to
above, will then |
3
be the distinction between an expression like
(1)
𝑎& 𝑏→𝑏
– i.e., “from the conjunction of 𝑎and of 𝑏follows 𝑏” – and one of the form
(2)
↦→𝑎& 𝑏=⇒
↦→𝑏
– i.e., “if 𝑎& 𝑏are proved, then 𝑏is proved”.
3. Rules of derivation and rules of demonstration are closely related. Indeed, we
shall later prove (t. . .) that
(3)
𝑎→𝑏=⇒(↦→𝑎=⇒
↦→𝑏)
Nevertheless, the two kinds of rules must be clearly distinguished, for we shall also
prove that the converse is not true, or in other words that |
4
(4)
𝑎→𝑏⇐⇒(↦→𝑎=⇒
↦→𝑏)
is a false statement, in the sense that if (4) is added to the normal rules of a system
of functional logic (for example, as formulated in Hilbert-Ackermann), the system
becomes contradictory.
4. Yet the distinction between these two rules seems to have been overlooked by
most writers, with the result that their systems do not conform with their intentions.
As they stand, they are either contradictory (e.g. the functional calculus of Carnap’s
Formalization of Logica), or they cannot be interpreted as a formalization of the logic
of derivation (e.g. the system |
5
of Hilbert-Ackermann), or they do not make it clear
which of these two possibilities they chose.
This is due to the fact that in any system of propositional and functional logic, the
rule (or rules) of substitution must have the status of a rule (or rules) of demonstration,
while the rule of implication (modus ponendo ponens, or “Schlußregel”b) must have
the status of a rule of derivation. But I do not know any system in which these |
6
two
rules are given different status. (In Carnap’s functional calculus, a rule of substitution2

is formulated as a rule of derivation; in Hilbert-Ackermann’s propositional3 and
functional4 logic, it is made quite clear that all rules are, in our sense, rules of
demonstration; and Hilbert Bernays5 give, in both propositional and functional logic,
the two kinds of rules clearly equal status, suggesting that they are rules of derivation,
although they are not as explicit as the other authors mentioned.)
5. The claim that the usual |
7
procedure has the very undesirable results indicated
will be substantiated in the paper. These results can easily enough be avoided; one
or two re-formulations of the rules in question would, indeed, be sufficient, (these
will be given). Yet it appears to me that a more radical re-formulation is desirable if
we are to avoid the feeling of uncertainty and bewilderment which must arise from
the discovery that these much discussed and most carefully formulated systems are
unsatisfactory. What is |
8
needed is an approach which not only makes it obvious that
these mistakes have been made but, moreover, makes it clear why they have been
made, and how similar mistakes can be avoided.
6. All the systems in question go back to Principia Mathematica (PM)c. PM
was written before the distinction between object language and meta language was
made, and it is well known that this has had its unfortunate evil effects – for example,
Russell’s remark that a conditional “⟨if . . . then . . .⟩” expresses “from . . . follows . . .”
|
9
(and, in connection with it, his use of the name “implication” for the conditional). At
present, Russell’s symbolism, excluding the assertion symbol, is usually interpreted
as constituting an object language; the assertion symbol is taken to belong to the
meta-language and to mean something like our ↦→, followed by quotation marks; and
his principle of inference (modus ponendo ponens) is taken to belong to the meta
language. This |
10
interpretation is, undoubtedly, reasonably satisfactory. But it forces
us to take the following view of logic (say, of propositional logic):
Logic is (a) the theory of deduction and derivation, (b) the system of L-true
(logically demonstrable, or “asserted”) propositions. If we look at it mainly as (b),
then we obtain (a) as a by-product. For each L-true conditional yields, together with
the modus ponendo ponens, a valid rule of derivation, and the infinite system of
L-true conditionals, therefore, |
11
yields the infinite system of valid rules of derivation.
And these are obtained from one rule of derivation – the modus ponendo ponens –
together with a few “primitive propositions”. (It will be seen here that if the modus
ponendo ponens is not interpreted as a rule of derivation but only – for this is a weaker
interpretation – a conditional rule of proof, i.e., applicable only to proved premises,
then no rules of derivations will be forthcoming.)
7. But if (a) is our aim – and for the logician, rather the more important of the two
aims –, then it is not clear why we should reach it by the roundabout way via (b).
Why should we not develop the system of valid rules of derivations in a more direct
fashion, that is to say, independently of the development of the |
12
L-true propositions
(including those which are “primitive”)?

Some logicians, under the influence of the present tradition, believe that this is
impossible, and that any system of the propositional logic must contain “primitive
propositions” or “axioms” or “postulates”, and that rules of derivation alone would not
be sufficient. This view has, obviously, arisen from the discussion of the “unavoidable
dualism” which is involved in the fact that propositional logic cannot work with
primitive propositions alone – that it needs, |
13
besides, some “rules of inference”. But
although it certainly cannot do without rules of derivation, it can do without primitive
propositions. This has been shown first by G. Gentzen, in his Untersuchungen über
das logische Schließend, and he has also shown that a small number of primitive rules
of inference are as sufficient for the construction of the whole infinite system as the
usual systems.
8. The system to be developed in this paper is |
14
distinguished from Gentzen’s
“Calculus of natural inference” mainly by the fact that Gentzen’s calculus does not
attempt to keep the two tasks, (a) and (b), clearly apart, – a prerequisite for making
their mutual relations clear – but rather develops rules of proof with incidental rules
of derivation.
As opposed to this, I shall develop (a) a pure calculus of derivation, in which no
proposition is provable, I shall ⟨b⟩show that, if a definition of proof is added to this
calculus, all L-true |
15
propositions can be shown to be provable, without any further
assumption of primitive propositions or axioms.
18.2 ⟨The Distinction Between Derivation and Demonstration⟩
In
1
this paper, an attempt is made to present a new solution to one of the oldest and,
without doubt, one of the most fundamental problems of logic.
The distinction between derivation and demonstration has played a certain role
in the history of logic, from Aristotle down to contemporary mathematical logic.
To Aristotle, syllogisms are of interest mainly as instruments of demonstration. But
Aristotle is quite clear that not every syllogism is a demonstration. There are valid
syllogisms, he insists, with contingent, or even with false premises, and these are
not demonstrations. A demonstration, to Aristotle, is a syllogism with necessary
premises.
We are thus led to distinguish between, on the one side, inference which – although
valid – is not demonstrative, and on the other side demonstrative inference; or, as we
shall say, between derivation, and demonstration (or proof).
The relation between derivation and demonstration has been interpreted, ever
since Aristotle, as one between genus and species; that is to say, demonstration has
always been interpreted as a kind of derivation. Demonstration was considered to be
a derivation from particularly important and reliable premises, – from definitions,
d Gentzen (1935a,b).

18 Three Notes on Derivation and Demonstration
305
or from axioms, or from primitive propositions, etc.1 The present paper attempts to
show that this view is |
2
misleading, and that it prevents us from a clear understanding
of derivation as well as demonstration; that is to say, from an understanding of logic.
According to the theory here to be developed, demonstration is a procedure
of which derivation is always a part – the most conspicuous part – but never the
whole; a demonstration always contains a derivation (it often contains more than
one derivation), but it never is a derivation. The fact that derivations constitute the
most conspicuous part of every demonstration explains why |
3
demonstration has been
so long considered to consist merely as a special kind of derivation, namely, of a
derivation from premises which are considered to be particularly secure; and our final
theory will clearly show the extent to which this view is quite justified, even though it
cannot be considered in itself as a satisfactory theory of demonstration.
|
4
In order to make clear at once what I mean when I say that a demonstration
consists of derivations, or refers to derivations, or contains derivations as parts, I
shall give examples of some rules of demonstration, and their relation to the rules of
derivation (such as, for example, the syllogistic rules of inference).
Let us assume that a conclusion, which we shall call by the name “𝐵”, can be
inferred (with the help, say, of syllogisms) from some premise, or premises, which
we shall call by the name “𝐴”. We then say “From 𝐴follows 𝐵” or, in a short-hand
notation,
𝐴
𝐵
|
5
Now let us assume that the negation of the statement 𝐵– which we denote by the
name “𝐵′” – also follows from the same premise or premises 𝐴. This, of course, can
happen only if 𝐴contains a contradiction, that is to say, if 𝐴is logically false. We
can say:
(1)
If
𝐴
𝐵and
𝐴
𝐵′ , then 𝐴is logically false, or refuted.
We now assume that 𝐴can be negated. (If 𝐴consists, for example of two premises,
𝐶and 𝐷, say, then 𝐴′, i.e., the negation of 𝐴will amount to the assertion that either
𝐶or 𝐷or both are false, i.e., to the assertion that 𝐶′ or 𝐷′ or both of these are true.)
|
6
In view of (1), we can now say:
(2)
If
𝐴
𝐵and
𝐴
𝐵′ , then 𝐴′ is demonstrated.
The conditional statement (1) may be described as a rule of refutation, the
conditional statement (2) as a rule of demonstration.
The antecedent of either of these conditionals, i.e., of (1) or of (2), refers to
derivations; it has the form “If . . . is a valid inference”, and it refers, of course,
implicitly to a certain body of rules of valid inferences (such as the syllogisms). The

Carnap. (expand this note). Introduction to Semantics, p. 167 ⟨Carnap (1942)⟩.

consequent |
7
of these conditionals state that a certain statement (or a conjunction of
statements, or a disjunction of statements) is refuted or proved.
We shall make use of a simple short-hand method of writing such conditional rules
of demonstration; we shall divide the antecedent and the consequent by a horizontal
double line, and we shall write “⊢𝑋” for “𝑋is demonstrated”. Thus (2) becomes
(2∗)
𝐴
𝐵
𝐴
𝐵′
⊢𝐴′
|
8
If we look at (2∗) then we can clearly discern the difference between a rule of
derivation and a rule of proof. A rule of derivation such as Barbara may be, for
example, written thus:
(3)
𝑍𝑎𝑌
𝑋𝑎𝑍
𝑋𝑎𝑌
or
𝑍𝑎𝑌
𝑋𝑎𝑍
𝑋𝑎𝑌
Another example would be the following very obvious rule of derivation by which
we can introduce the conjunction of the statement 𝐴and the statement 𝐵; we shall
use for such a conjunction the name “𝐴& 𝐵”, and can write:
𝐴
𝐵
(&𝑖) 𝐴& 𝐵
𝐴& 𝐵
(&𝑒)
𝐴
𝐴& 𝐵
(&𝑒′)
𝐵
The first of these rules states that |
9
from the two premises 𝐴, 𝐵, we can deduce the
conclusion 𝐴& 𝐵, and the seconde
18.3 The Propositional and Functional Logic of Derivation and of
Demonstration
1
Informal Introduction.
1. The principal purpose of this paper is to show that the propositional and also the
functional calculus can be obtained in a system which does not assume any primitive
propositions, axioms, or axiom schemata but only “genuine” rules of derivation. By a
“genuine rule of derivation” I mean either an unconditional rule such as “from the
premise 𝑎together with the premise 𝑏, the conclusion 𝑎can be derived”, for which
we shall write, using “→” for “from . . . follows (or is derivable) . . .”
(1)
𝑎, 𝑏→𝑎,
or a conditional rule such as “If from the premise 𝑎, the conclusion 𝑏is derivable,
then, from the premise non-𝑏, the conclusion non-𝑎is derivable”; this we shall write
e The manuscript ends abruptly here.

18 Three Notes on Derivation and Demonstration
307
(using, in the metalanguage, “. . . =⇒. . .” as an abbreviation for “if . . . then . . .”.
(2)
𝑎→𝑏=⇒∼𝑏→∼𝑎
We also consider as “genuine” rules of derivation certain slightly more complicated
conditional rules such as the rule expressing that derivability (i.e., →) is a transitive
relation:
(3)
𝑎→𝑏=⇒(𝑏→𝑐=⇒𝑎→𝑐)
and rules which refer to derivation rules of the kind (1), (2), and (3).
We shall not make use of absolute derivation rules such as those used by Carnap1,
which state that certain statements or formulae are derivable without premises (or
“directly derivable from the zero class of premises”); we do not consider these as
“genuine” rules of derivation, but rather as a different way of formulating axiom
schemata, and it is our aim to avoid all axioms, however formulated: this is precisely
why we confine ourselves to “genuine” assuming derivation rules, as described.
2. Starting with a number of primitive (or assumed) rules of derivation, we shall
show that our calculus corresponds in so far to the usual calculi that all and only those
conclusions can be obtained |
2
from any given set of premises which are obtainable
with the help of the customary calculi of propositions and functions which employ
axioms or make use of axiom schemata, etc. But although all these derivations can
be carried out, none of the well-known logically true formulae (or of the asserted
propositions, or L-true sentences) can be proved in the system, although these L-true
statements or formulae have a peculiar status in the system.
3. This, however, is merely due to the fact that our system, as a complete system
of derivation rules, does not need to make use in any sense of L-true formulae or
statements. If, in spite of this fact, we add to our system an appropriate definition of
“demonstrable formula” (or of “L-true statement” or of “asserted proposition”), then
we can show, again without the use of axioms, that the customary system of L-true
statements coincides with the system of statements which are “demonstrable” in the
sense of this definition.
4. We thus operate with two connected, but precisely distinct systems – the system
of derivation rules, and the system of demonstrable statements. Or in other words, we
make a clear distinction between the logic of derivation and the logic of demonstration
(or proof), and we develop the former independently from the latter.
This is the main point in which our system differs from earlier systems: Carnap2,
for example, who recently emphasized a distinction between derivation and proof,
and who uses these terms, in intention, in the same sense in which they are used here,
constructs systems in which practically no derivations can be carried out without
recourse to proved sentences, or to proof schematas (viz., to his axiom schematas
formulated in terms of “directly derivable from the zero class of sentences”). Gentzen3,

Karl R. Popper
on the other hand, operates without any axioms or axiom schematas; but he, too, does
not keep the system of derivations distinct from that of demonstration; on the contrary,
he operates, without any clear distinction between them, with rules which, in our
system, are clearly distinguished into rules of derivation and rules of demonstration.
5. But this distinction between rules of derivation and rules of |
3
demonstration
is, indeed, fundamental. It will be shown that every system which neglects this
distinction is vitiated by this neglect. It either cannot be applied to derivations, or it
is contradictory. For example, the system of Hilbert and Ackermann4 will be shown
to be only apparently applicable to the problem of derivation of conclusions from
some given premises; as it stands, it is merely a logic of demonstrations. The very
similar system of Hilbert and Bernays5, on the other hand, and similarly Carnap’s
functional calculus6, will be shown to be contradictory.
This result will be established in the paper; but it will be to some advantage to
explain it to some extent at once.
I distinguish between a (simple) rule of derivation, such as (1), and a (conditional)
rule of demonstration. Writing “↦→𝑎” for “𝑎is demonstrable”7, and using “𝑎& 𝑏”
as the (variable) name of the conjunction of the statements 𝑎and 𝑏, we can write, for
example,
(4)
↦→𝑎& 𝑏=⇒
↦→𝑎,
that is to say, if 𝑎& 𝑏is demonstrable, then 𝑎is demonstrable. This conditional asser-
tion of the metatheory must be clearly distinguished from the following unconditional
assertion of the metatheory
(5)
𝑎& 𝑏→𝑎,
that is to say, from 𝑎& 𝑏follows 𝑎. (4) is a (conditional) rule of demonstration; (5) a
rule of derivation.
These two types are closely connected: we shall establish that, generally,
(6)
𝑎→𝑏=⇒(↦→𝑎=⇒
↦→𝑏)
thatis to say,thatifa derivation suchas (5) holds,then the corresponding demonstration
rule must hold also. It is easily seen that (6) must be a consequence of any definition
of demonstrability which is adequate, for (6) is obviously equivalent to
(7)
↦→𝑎=⇒(𝑎→𝑏=⇒
↦→𝑏)
that is to say, whatever is derivable from a demonstrable statement must be demonstra-
ble. I suppose that (6) is the reason why derivation rules such as (5) and demonstration
rules such as (4) have not usually been distinguished. But the failure to distinguish

them is fatal. For it can be easily shown that (8), i.e., the converse of (6), is not |
4
true;
and since
(8)
(↦→𝑎=⇒
↦→𝑏) =⇒𝑎→𝑏
is false, derivation rules and the corresponding demonstration rules are not, in general,
equivalent; a derivation rule is stronger than the corresponding demonstration rule.
That (8) is false can be easily seen by assuming that 𝑎is, say, a satisfiable but not
demonstrable formula of the functional calculus; for example, 𝑎may be the formula
(9)
“𝜑(𝑥) ⊃(𝑦)𝜑(𝑦)”
in Russell’s notation; this formula is generally satisfied in a universe of no more than
one element, and therefore not demonstrable. On the other hand, since it is satisfiable,
no contradictory formula can be derived from it. If we choose a contradictory formula
and name it “𝑏”, then the antecedent of (8) is true, since “↦→𝑎” is false; at the same
time “𝑎→𝑏” is false; thus (8) cannot, in general, be true.
We thus have shown that, if “derivable” and “demonstrable” are adequately
defined, derivation rules and the corresponding demonstration rules are not, in general,
equivalent. Now it is a result of this paper that all rules of inference pertaining to the
substitution of free variables must be (conditional) rules of demonstration, otherwise,
the identity of all elements represented by free variables becomes demonstrable.
On the other hand, every system which contains only demonstration rules clearly
is inadequate for the derivation of conclusions from premises which have not been
demonstrated. In this way, every system which treats its rules of substitution as being
of equal status to its other rules of inference (and this is done by all systems I know
of) is inadequate – either it does not contain the logic of derivation or (if it contains a
rule of substitution for propositional or functional variables) it is contradictory or
(if it contains a rule of substitution for argument-variables) it is satisfiable only in a
universe containing at most one element and therefore contradictory if it contains any
assertion such as “0 ≠1”, or any assertion to the effect that “𝑥= 𝑦” is not universally
true.
It must be admitted that the system of Hilbert-Ackermann can be very easily
amended. All that is needed is, (writing “𝑎⊃𝑏” for |
5
the conditional (or material
implication) of 𝑎and 𝑏) to add the derivation rule8 that, for all closed 𝑎and 𝑏,
(10)
↦→𝑎⊃𝑏=⇒𝑎→𝑏
But the alterations needed to rectify the systems of Hilbert-Bernays and Carnap
are not so simple (they will be discussed below). Accordingly, a feeling of uneasiness
must remain even after the necessary alterations have been made. If an elementary
logical system such as that of Hilbert-Bernays which has been used extensively for a
dozen years contains an unsuspected contradiction (not a paradox, but simply one
or two mistakes), and if another system (Hilbert-Ackermann) apparently practically
8 ⟨Footnote missing⟩

310

identical, contains, although not a contradiction, but another, more or less opposite
mistake, then, I think, it may be of some advantage not merely to repair it but to
choose, instead, a method of formalization in which this type of mistake is not likely
to occur; that is to say, a method which, from the very start, distinguishes the logic of
derivation from that of demonstration.
6. But there are more direct arguments in favour of this method: the present method,
even in so far as it is valid, fails, I believe, to exhibit some very important logical facts
(if I may say so). I mean the fact that every “natural” logical proof, although making
use of derivations, is not a derivation but something different from the derivation
which forms part of it.
Let us take as an example an indirect proof. If we can validly derive, from some
statement 𝑎, a statement 𝑏, and if we can validly derive, from the same statement 𝑎the
negation of 𝑏(we write it “∼𝑏”), then, we argue, 𝑎is refuted (we write “←  𝑎” for “𝑎
is refuted”), and, accordingly, ∼𝑎proved. Writing 𝑎
𝑏for 𝑎→𝑏, and === for =⇒, we
obtain the following couple of schemata (a “refutation schema” and a “demonstration
schema”):
(11)
𝑎
𝑏
𝑎
∼𝑏;
←  𝑎
←  𝑎;
↦→∼𝑎
|
6
which can be combined to
(12)
𝑎
𝑏
𝑎
∼𝑏
↦→∼𝑎
This is clearly not a derivation schema, but it contains a reference to derivation;
it says that, if certain derivations can be validly made, then a certain statement is
proved.
From (12) we obtain, substituting 𝑎for 𝑏(we write “ 𝑏
𝑎
”), together with

the proof schema

which, being derivable from (12) is the intuitionistically valid schema of the direct
proof (or proof by excluded middle), and from this we get, provided we use the
derivation rule of double negation in the form ∼∼𝑎→𝑎, the classical schema of the
direct proof.
(17)
𝑎

∼𝑎
𝑏
↦→𝑏
In all these examples we can clearly distinguish between the use of derivation
rules and of demonstration rules. But the customary method of treating these matters
by means of asserted propositions |
7
such as
(18)
↦→(𝑎⊃∼𝑎) ⊃∼𝑎
– which ⟨corresponds⟩to schema (14) – although in itself a perfectly valid method,
seems to me to hide the fact that a proof must always refer to derivation rules (and
perhaps to rules of demonstration), but does not need to proceed from proved or
asserted propositions. Indeed, (18) may correspond to proof schemata in different
ways. We can obtain from it and the rule of detachment (modus ponendo ponens)
(19)
↦→𝑎⊃∼𝑎=⇒
↦→∼𝑎
which is a conditional rule of demonstration, and does not refer to derivations. From
(19) we may obtain (with the help of the “deduction theorem” 𝑎→𝑏=⇒𝑎⊃𝑏)
the rule
(20)
𝑎→∼𝑎=⇒
↦→∼𝑎,
which is the same as (14); but the “deduction theorem” is, as a rule, not capable
of being formulated in the logical systems in question – it is, at best, a theorem
about these systems; in other words, not part of their theory of proof, but a statement
about their theory of proof. Besides, the deduction theory is only valid for systems in
which a clear distinction is made between a rule of derivation and the corresponding
conditional rule of demonstration – a distinction which of course cannot be formulated
within these systems. Now it seems to me that, although valid, this method is lacking
in clarity as far as the relations between derivation and demonstration is concerned.
On the other hand, our examples show that only if we have a reasonably complete
set of rules of derivations (as opposed to rules of demonstration) to refer to, can we
hope to make practical use of our derivation schemata; in other words I suggest that
it is advisable to treat the theory of proof as logically secondary to the theory of
derivation, and to build up the latter independently of the former.

Lecture Notes on Logic (1939–1941)
Karl R. Popper
Abstract These are unpublished lecture notes from Popper’s Nachlass, which he used
in his lectures on logic at Canterbury University College in Christchurch from 1939
to 1941.
Editorial notes: During his time as a Lecturer and Senior Lecturer in Philosophy at Canterbury
University College, Christchurch, New Zealand (1937–1945), Popper taught logic regularly. The
annual Canterbury University College Calendarsa of that period list logic courses for different levels
(Philosophy I, II and III), and also mention the textbooks used: in 1937 Wolf (1930) (Philosophy I and
II), Joseph (1916) and Cohen and Nagel (1934) (Philosophy III), in 1938 Wolf (1930) (Philosophy I
and II), Cohen and Nagel (1934) (Philosophy III), from 1939 until 1945 Chapman and Henle (1933)
(Philosophy I and II), Stebbing (1930) (Philosophy III). From the textbooks used, the overview of
the lecture notes and Popper’s remarks in § 19 it can be concluded that “logic” did not exclusively
mean deductive logic, but covered also inductive logic and scientific method.
We rely on three typescripts, which we call TS1, TS2 and TS3, from KPS Box 366, Folder 19.
TS1 is the earliest; it has 25 numbered pages without a cover page or date. TS2 and TS3 are very
similar; they are subsequent versions of TS1 with additions and small alterations. TS2 has a cover
page which contains the information “Canterbury University College. Logic. Lecture Notes, 1939.
(Philosophy I or II.)”. TS3 has the same cover page except for the year, which here is 1941. Both TS2
and TS3 contain one page which on first sight appears to be a table of contents. Since its structure
does not correspond to the structure of the chapters which follow, we think it should be read as
a systematic description of the different subdivisions of what is commonly called “logic”. This
systematic overview is marked with the year 1939 in TS2, and with the year 1940 in TS3.
The text reproduced here is based on TS2 and TS3. The first main difference between TS1 on the
one hand and TS2 and TS3 on the other is that TS2 and TS3 contain three additional sections at
the end of Chapter I (i.e., sections 31–32). Secondly, the entirety of Chapter III, on descriptive and

Introduction
I. Preliminary Remarks.
1. The study of Logic is for the most part rather difficult for the beginner for two very
different reasons.
Firstly, logic is much more abstract than, for instance, any of the natural sciences
as it does not deal with facts or happenings in nature, or with things but with our
methods and ways of describing such facts or happenings in nature. Clearly, then,
such an abstract subject is not easy to grasp.
The other reason which renders logic rather difficult to study is that very many, if
not most of the books about the subject are rather obscurely written. Not only is the
subject an abstract one – the books about logic are often written in such a way that
anybody who is used to reading books critically is handicapped by the lack of clarity
and precision, so that he is often doubtful whether he understands correctly what the
author intends to express. I should like to quote in this connection the text-book of
logicc by A. Wolf, who says, in his Preface, “Strange though it may appear, text-books
of logic are among the chief sinners against the canons of logical method.” And we
may well substitute here, for the words “logical method”, simply the words “clear
and correct formulation.”
2. The situation mentioned, namely, the obscurity of many logical books, is due
mainly, not so much to the abstractness of the subject as to the rather strange fact that
the logicians and even some excellent logicians, who have contributed a great deal to
the development of the subject, were not clear about the nature of their subject.
To make this point comprehensible we shall consider some examples of other
subjects. It is quite easy, for instance, to imagine that somebody may be an excellent
mathematician, or an excellent physicist or biologist, yet unable to give a clear answer
to questions like the following: “What is the nature of mathematics (or biology, and so
on)?”; “What is the nature of mathematical (or biological) objects?”; or, for instance,
“What is number?”. In most cases the mathematician will know better how to operate
with numbers than to answer such abstract questions, and it is therefore not so very
strange as it might at first sight appear, that the logicians were, until very recently, in
a very similar position: they knew – at least some of them – how to tackle certain
logical problems, but were quite lost with regard to the question of the nature of what
they were actually doing. Certainly, they tried very hard to give an interpretation of
what they had been doing, but those very attempts were precisely the cause of most
of the obscurities in their writings.
3. It will be fairly clear that nobody could possibly know what the reason was for the
obscurity of logical writings before a really satisfactory answer had been found to the
question of the nature of logic. The development of new methods which, after all,
led to such an answer was originated by the English logician George Boole (and his
successors De Morgan and Jevons). But neither Boole nor Russell and Whitehead
c Wolf (1930).

316
Karl R. Popper
(in their “Principia Mathematica”d, undoubtedly one of the most important books
on Logic ever written) succeeded themselves in giving a satisfactory answer to the
question of the nature of logic; it was not before the last five or ten years, as the work
of those authors was further developed by others, that such an answer has been given.
Since this development is so very recent, one naturally cannot hope that the answer
will soon be generally accepted. |
2
As a matter of fact, one should expect the process
of absorption of the new theory to take many years, probably some decades.
I am, therefore, in this elementary treatment, not going to trouble the reader very
much with the sometimes technically complicated results of this modern movement,
but I shall attempt to make some use of those results – a rather negative one: I
shall use them mainly in order to avoid the difficulties mentioned above, namely, the
obscurities connected with the question of the nature of logic or, as may be said, the
question concerning the interpretation of the doings of the logician.
II. What Do We Call Logic?
4. Most text-books of logic start with a definition of logic, or with an explanation of
the object or of the scope of logic. My opinion about this point is as follows: it is
certainly very useful for a student of the subject to have a fair idea about what he is
going to study. Such an idea will enable him to understand his reading better. I need
not say much about the advantages, because they are fairly obvious, but I do not think
that the student needs more than a fairly general idea; for if I should give more than
this, for instance, a rather subtle definition of logic or a full theory of its aims and
problems, then, I fear, this would have the opposite effect: the reader who obviously
cannot be aware of what the reasons for my subtleties would be, would not be able
to appreciate them. Not knowing what kinds of difficulties and what controversies
underlie these subtleties, he would be unable to see their implications, and would
probably feel confused rather than enlightened.
I think, therefore, that the following way will be the best: to give the reader, in this
Introduction, first a certain idea of the interests of a logician, mainly with the help of
some examples, and after this to give a general outline of the main questions with
which this present treatment will deal.1
5. With this aim in view it will be convenient to adopt from the very beginning a
rough division of the field of logic into two main parts, which we may call, according
to tradition:
A. Deductive Logic, or formal Logic, or pure Logic (or, using a more recent termi-
nology: the logical analysis of the language of science).
1 In the last part of the present treatment – when the reader may have obtained some knowledge of
the problems of logic, and of the answers given – I shall try to deal more fully with the question
concerning the nature of Logic.
d Whitehead and Russell (1925–1927).

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
317
B. Inductive Logic, or Logic of scientific method; or Logic as applied to scien-
tific investigations (or, the logical analysis of the methods of testing scientific
statements).
In what way these two parts are connected and co-ordinated we shall see later. At
present we shall simply remember that there are two such main parts and, without
attempting to connect them, we shall try to gain some idea about each.
3
III. What Do We Call Deductive or Formal Logic?
6. The centre of our interest within the realm of the part of logic which we shall call
Deductive or Formal Logic is the concept of logical consequence.
I will try to explain this concept with the help of examples. (I am not going to give
a strict definition.) In these examples I will make use not only of the expression: “is
a logical consequence of”, but also of some exactly equivalent expressions such as
“follows logically from”, “can be inferred from”, “can be logically deduced from”,
and similar phrases.2
Example 1. If we have the two sentences: “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”, and
“Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Jones”, then the sentence, “Mr. Roberts is taller
than Mr. Smith”, is a logical consequence of the two previous sentences.
Example 2. If we have the two statements: “My copy of the ‘Principia Mathematica’
is either blue or black”, and “My copy of the ‘Principia Mathematica’ is not
black”, then we are entitled to make the logical inference: “My copy of the
‘Principia Mathematica’ is blue”.
Example 3. From the three statements: “All sons of mortal beings are mortal”;
“Edward VII is a mortal being”; and “George V is a son of Edward VII”, we are
entitled to deduce logically the statement: “George V is a mortal being.”
Example 4. The statement: “In room No. 48 is a table” is a logical consequence of
the statement “In room No. 48 there are two tables and eight chairs”, but the
latter statement is not a logical consequence of the former; whilst each of the
following two statements: “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”, and “Mr. Smith
is less tall than Mr. Jones”, follows logically from the other.
7. Now a few words about these examples. Everybody will be able to see that there
is a certain kind of relationship between the statements, from which some other
statements follow logically (or can be logically deduced, or logically inferred). This
relationship, which has such very great significance for logic, is sometimes called
logical deducibility, or derivability. These words are a little clumsy but no doubt they
express fairly clearly what is meant.
2 We are not going to adopt here a distinction between the words “sentence”, “statement”, “proposi-
tion”. Some problems which arise from such distinctions will be discussed later.

318
Karl R. Popper
Using the term deducibility we can say, instead of “The statement 𝐴follows from
the statement 𝐵”, for example, “The relationship of logical deducibility holds between
the statements 𝐴and 𝐵.”
Our examples show that it may very well be the case that the statement 𝐴follows
from the statement 𝐵, but that the statement 𝐵does not follow from the statement 𝐴.
We therefore have to be careful in using the term “deducibility”; the relationship of
deducibility is, to a certain extent, similar to, say, the relationship of brotherhood as
exemplified as follows: If 𝐴is a brother of 𝐵, 𝐵need not be a brother of 𝐴, because
𝐵might be the sister of 𝐴, and therefore the relation of brotherhood holds sometimes
from 𝐴to 𝐵and not from 𝐵to 𝐴. Similarly the relation of deducibility. If we are, for
a moment, puzzled as to whether we shall say that the relation of deducibility holds
between 𝐴and 𝐵or between 𝐵|
4
and 𝐴, we remember that we have to take 𝐴and 𝐵
in such an order that the statement “𝐴is deducible from 𝐵” would hold.
8. It is clear that, in ordinary life, we make great use of the relationship of deducibility.
There is no doubt about it that, obtaining information as in Example 1 (Mr. Jones is
taller than Mr. Smith, and Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Jones), we usually make at
once, more or less intuitively, an inference – we know at once that Mr. Roberts would
be taller than Mr. Smith, without thinking very much about it, and especially without
having studied logic or making use of any logical rules of inferences. In drawing such
inferences in ordinary life we are relying on certain feelings or intuitions rather than
on clearly formulated analysis. Such a feeling is sometimes called “logical intuition”,
and there is no doubt that we would hardly be able to make use of any kind of rational
knowledge in ordinary life if we did not have the faculty of “logical intuition”; to
have such logical intuitions is clearly even more important for a scientist than it is for
anybody else. Every scientist, every philosopher, and certainly every logician has
very often to draw inferences, and he could never go very far if he had to think a great
deal about every inference he had to draw, or if he had to elaborate and analyse every
inference in full.
But although the logician, like everybody else, makes use of this logical intuition,
he is not very much interested in the fact that such logical intuition exists, or in the
question how it works. (That is, however, rather interesting for the psychologist.) His
task is not so well characterised by saying that he has to make inferences, to draw
consequences – he makes inferences just as any other scientist does – although one of
his main interests is to analyse inference, to analyse the relationship of deducibility.
To make this point a little clearer: the relationship of deducibility is an object
of investigation for the logician in a similar way as, for instance, the relationship
of mutual attraction between certain material objects, is an object of study for the
physicist; and the logician would be interested in this relationship, so to speak, even
if there was nothing like logical intuition. Let us imagine we did not have logical
intuition – or rather that we had it in a much less degree than we actually do: then we
would still have to make inferences for purposes of ordinary life, and (being unable
to rely so much on our intuition) we would have to analyse in a rather awkward way
every inference so as to see whether or not the relation of deducibility holds in the
case in question. If such were the case, the study of logic would be very important

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
319
from the standpoint of practical usefulness, because such an analysis would fall into
the scope of logic.
9. I have made these brief remarks about logical intuition just in order to make it clear
with what we are not going to deal.
Coming back now to the question of what the logician is going to deal with, we shall
consider for a moment the analogy to which I referred when I said that the logician is
dealing with the relationship of deducibility between statements in a manner more
or less similar to that adopted by the physicist when he tries to investigate certain
relationships between physical bodies.
There are certain similarities and certain dissimilarities between those two cases.
First I shall mention some similarities:
10. The physicist may, for example, study physical relationships between, say, two
pieces of iron, – this magnetic needle |
5
here, for instance, and this key. He is
investigating these relations using different means – in fact he will use all the means
he can think of: he will make observations, he will try to make certain alterations in
objects, and he will, certainly, make use of his brain. All the time he will be mainly
interested in the physical bodies and their relationships, and as long as he is making
use of the different means indicated he will not worry, as a rule, about those means
themselves (although certainly those means could be made an object of some other
investigation); and he will not remain at this stage of the investigation, namely, just
making statements about those two special pieces of metal – he will try to find some
general laws about the relationship, say, of all pieces of metal of a certain similar
kind.
Similarly the logician: he may, for instance, begin with the investigation of the
properties of the relationship of certain special statements like the examples I have
given above in number 6. In doing so he may make use of different means. He may, for
instance, make certain alterations. He may substitute the name “Mr. Brown” for that of
“Mr. Smith” wherever it occurs, and in doing so he will observe that the relationship of
deducibility still holds between the statements thus altered – a fact which may seem to
be quite obvious and even trivial, but which is, nevertheless, very well worth noticing,
as it has to do with some fundamental properties of the relationship of deducibility,
which could be expressed in the words “this relationship remains unaffected by
variations of certain kinds”. (Later – in section 28 – we shall have to discuss this point
more fully.) In making these investigations the logician will certainly have to use his
brain, as the physicist does, but, just as in the case of the physicist, he need not be
interested in this fact (in which, however, the psychologist may take a deep interest);
hence he will not mix up the problems or objects of his investigations with those
mental processes occuring in his thoughts.3 Like the physicist, he will not be satisfied
3 Some people find special difficulties in the fact that the logician, whilst investigating inferences,
has to make inferences; they maintain that the logician (for that reason) has to take a special interest
in his own intuitively working brain, or, that the object of logic is, like the object of a certain part
of psychology, the investigation of our thoughts, of certain mental processes of inference. The
comparison with the physicist which I have made above is partly intended to show that we need not
worry about such problems; but they will be discussed in a chapter on the nature of logic at the end
of this treatment.

320
Karl R. Popper
with remaining at the stage of investigating merely special objects as in the examples
given, but will try to develop certain general rules or laws about deducibility, which
laws will perhaps look something like the following:– “If we have one or two or three
statements of such and such form then we will be justified in deducing one or two
or three statements of such and such (similar or different) form.” (One of the most
important general rules of this kind will be considered presently. Other more special
rules will form the main point of our treatment of Formal Logic, namely the famous
Theory of the Syllogism.)
Now we shall have to turn to the dissimilarities between the interest of the logician
and that of the physicist.
11. In the first place, it is rather striking how very much more abstract is the interest of
the logician compared with that of the physicist. I need not say much about this point;
but it may be of comfort for the novice to know that |
6
logic is not much more abstract
than, for instance, grammar (apart from the fact that grammar, which deals, like logic,
with formulations, sentences, statements, is not very much concerned with the mutual
relationships between these objects). We can, roughly, characterise the higher degree
of abstractness of logic compared with physics in the following way: the physicist
aims at investigating physical objects and formulating statements about those objects,
whilst the objects in which the logician is interested are statements (formulated, for
instance, by the physicist), so that he aims at making statements about those objects
– therefore:– at making statements about statements. This situation (which will be
more closely inspected in the last part of the present treatment) has been sometimes
formulated with the help of fairly appropriate slogans such as: “Logic is the science
of the sciences”, or, “Logic is the theory of the theories”.
12. In the second place I want to draw attention to a very simple but at the same
time slightly technical point which has often been overlooked, although it is of some
significance: the physicist is not tempted to put his very objects of investigation on
the paper on which he is writing, using them instead of their names. Certainly, it may
occur sometimes, perhaps in botany, that a scientist will stick on the paper certain
objects about which he is speaking, for instance, certain leaves; but in writing about
these objects he will not want to put an oak leaf on his paper every time instead of the
words “oak leaf”. The object put on the paper, therefore, is not used as its own name,
but merely serves as an illustration. With the logician or the grammarian the situation
seems to be slightly different, because he will have no difficulty in writing down the
sentence which is the object of his investigation, thus using the object as a name for
itself (like a man, who, when writing about matches, would place a match on his
paper every time instead of the word “match”). This possibility may perhaps appear
to be rather convenient, but actually, – it has turned out to be a source of confusion
and lack of strictness, if the object and its names were used without clear distinction.
The easiest way to avoid such confusion is to distinguish between the use of a word
or of a statement in the ordinary way in which it is a name of a certain object – e.g. of
Mr. Smith – and its use as a name for itself, for instance, as the name “Mr. Smith,” by
putting it, as we have just done and as is customary, in inverted commas.
To give some examples: The last two words in the foregoing paragraph form

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
321
a name of a certain object – of the object we call inverted commas. They are not
themselves this object (and we do not put them, therefore, into inverted commas). But
if we want to speak about the name of this object – i.e. about the words “inverted
commas”, then it is quite natural to put that name, as we have just done, in inverted
commas.
What I have just said may appear to some people at first sight terribly complicated
and perhaps rather pedantic, but the situation is as follows:
As already stated it is quite customary to make use of the inverted commas in
the way indicated; but this custom is very often not strictly observed – especially in
logical or grammatical texts, where one would have naturally, to use inverted commas
so frequently that the author may feel tempted to spare them. The omission often
may do no harm, because it may be fairly obvious what is meant; but sometimes it
does. So we are faced with the situation that this custom is observed in ordinary texts,
where it is convenient but would not lead to bad consequences if we did not observe
it, whilst it is not always used in logical texts, where it is not convenient because we
would have to use it too often, but where its avoidance sometimes leads to very bad
results. |
7
We could therefore formulate our rule like this: Do not become tired of
using inverted commas. And that is all.
Coming back to our comparison between the logician and the physicist, we see
that the second point discussed, the dissimilarity (I am not going to discuss further
similarities, although there may be more), consists just in the mere possibility of
the logician’s putting down the objects of his investigations with black ink on white
paper, which is usually not possible for the physicist (who, even if he writes about ink,
– its chemical structure for instance – would never use his object, i.e. ink itself, e.g.
a spot of ink, instead of the word “ink”). Now when the logician uses his symbols
according to the ordinary custom, i.e.: when he makes use of inverted commas, then
his situation again becomes rather similar to that of the physicist: like the physicist,
he then does not use his objects as names for themselves, but he uses names (or
symbols) to denote his objects, and under them often such kinds of names, which
consist of inverted commas plus this object. These types of names may be called
“inverted comma names”. They are, however, not the only type of name used in logic.
If we speak about one of the statements which we have used before as examples, for
instance the statement, “Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Jones”, then we can put it, as
we have just done, in inverted commas (thereby indicating that we do not want to
state something about the objects Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones – neither to state that
Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Jones nor, for example, to discuss the question whether
Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Jones). Another way of speaking about this statement
would be to refer to the statement which was used as the first example in section 6
(thus using the words “first example in section six” as a name of the statement).
Probably the explanation and examples given are quite sufficient, but I think it
would be advisable to read them at least twice. The second reading will show that the
thing is simpler than it seems to be.

322
Karl R. Popper
IV. The Rule of the Transmission of Truth (The First Rule About
Inference).
13. We will now after all go a little deeper into the matter itself and examine a little
more carefully the examples indicated to illustrate the relation of deducibility.
Turn back again to our first example. Imagine it was not true that Mr. Jones is
really taller than Mr. Smith. Then, obviously we could not be certain that the inferred
statement, “Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Smith”, is true – even if the second of the
two sentences, from which we inferred the third, were true. But, certainly, it might
very well be the case that the first statement “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”,
is false and that the inferred statement, “Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr Smith”, is
nevertheless true; for Mr. Roberts (but not Mr. Jones) may be taller than Mr. Smith.
To analyse these relations in a more general way we will introduce the following
technical terms:–
Such statements or sentences from which we can deduce logically certain other
statements we shall call premises, and those statements which are deducible from
these premises we shall call conclusions, or, sometimes, consequences, or simply
the inferred or deduced statements. It has to be noted that we cannot simply say of a
certain statement – for instance, “Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Smith” – that it is
a conclusion, without referring to certain premises from |
8
which it can be deduced;
because with regard to some other statements it may be, perhaps, not a conclusion,
but one of the premises; and, vice versa, we cannot simply say that a certain statement
is a premise (or that certain statements are premises) – without referring to some
other statements which can be deduced from them; because it may very well be
the case that the former statements are conclusions – with regard to some different
statements. It is customary to express this situation with the help of a phrase like:
“the concepts ‘premises’ and ‘conclusions’ are correlative: they cannot be applied to
certain statements without referring to certain other statements.”
Making use of the terms “premises” and “conclusions”, we now can formulate in
a more general way the remarks which we made with reference to our first example.
14. If a statement is a logical consequence of certain premises, then it may happen that
one of the premises is false (or even, that all of them are false) – but the consequence
may be true all the same; in other words, in the process of logical deduction FALSITY
of the premises is NOT always transmitted to their logical conclusion. If we have
seen this fact and tried with the help of our examples to understand it, to see that it
really may happen sometimes, then we are, I hope, prepared fully to appreciate the
significance and even importance of another logical rule, which we may formulate as
follows:–
If the premises are all true then any statement which can be logically deduced
from them – i.e., any of their consequences – must be true as well: in other words, in
the process of logical deduction, the TRUTH of the premises is ALWAYS transmitted
to their logical conclusion.4
4 Such properties as are always transmitted by a certain process, P, from one link of the process to
another are sometimes called “hereditary with regard to the process 𝑃”, or, briefly, “hereditary”.

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
323
In order to show the significance of this result I want to draw the reader’s attention
to the fact that every use made of inference, – in daily life just as in science, whether we
make the inferences consciously or just intuitively, – depends solely on its transmission
of the truth just formulated by the law of the transmission of the truth, (or, as we
may say with regard to the preceding foot-note, the law of the inheritance of truth.)
For when do we use inference? We use it when we have certain information which
does not exactly tell us at once some things we want to know, but which nevertheless
involves the answer to those questions. We therefore use inference to get certain
additional or secondary information if certain primary information is given, and we
want to be able to rely on that secondary information in the same way as we can
rely on our primary information. Therefore, if we were not sure that the relationship
of deducibility or the process of logical deduction would invariably, in all cases,
transmit the truth of our primary information to the secondary, we could never make
any practical use of logical deduction.
9
Validity of Inferences and Truth of Propositions.
15. Certainly all this holds only if the statements which we consider to be conclusions
are actually logical consequences of the premises; in other words if we are not
mistaken in assuming that the relationship of deducibility really holds between the
statements under consideration. If we have made a mistake with regard to this question
we naturally cannot say anything about the truth or falsity of the alleged conclusions
even if we are sure about the truth or falsity of the – equally alleged – premises.
(I say “equally alleged” because according to the above-mentioned fact that the
terms “premises” and “conclusions” are correlated they would not be premises if the
conclusions are not conclusions.)
If somebody erroneously supposes that the relationship of deducibility holds
between certain statements and if he therefore “deduces” certain statements from
other statements from which they actually never could be deduced, then it is customary
to say that his inference or deduction is not valid. To be quite correct we should say
that he has not made any inference at all, that he was merely claiming to have made
an inference, and that his claim was not justified. Strictly speaking, every inference,
every deduction, must be valid if it is an inference or deduction at all. (To say of an
inference that it is not valid is, if we want to be quite strict, similar to saying of a
circle that it is not round.) But nevertheless we will follow the customary usage and
speak about valid and invalid inferences in such a way that if we say, “such and such
an inference is valid”, we will remember that this is only short for “such and such a
supposed inference is actually an inference, – the relationship of deducibility does
hold between the statements under consideration.” Similarly, if we say, “Such and
such an inference is invalid”, we will remember that this will only be short for, “such
and such an alleged or supposed inference is no inference at all, – the relationship of
deducibility does not hold between the statements under consideration.”
Using this expression, which is in its suggestiveness rather helpful, we should say that truth is a
hereditary property with regard to the process of logical deduction (or: with regard to the relationship
of deducibility) whilst falsity is not always hereditary with regard to this process (or relationship).

324
Karl R. Popper
16. Having made this point clear we can now turn to an analysis of the relationship
between the truth of the statement under consideration and the validity of the inference.
A. If the inference is valid then –
(a) If the premises are all true the conclusion is always true.
(b) If at least one of the premises is false then the conclusion may be either false
or true.
B. If the inference is invalid then –
(a) If the alleged premises are true the alleged conclusions may be either true or
false.
(b) If the alleged premises are false the alleged conclusion may be either true or
false.
In other words, if the inference is valid we can be sure of only one of the possible
relationships of truth and falsity, namely, that the truth of the premises will be
transmitted to the conclusions; and if the inference is invalid we do not know anything
about the possible relationships of truth and falsity at all.
We can now tackle the whole thing from the other side and say –
A. If the supposed premises and the supposed conclusions are all true statements
then –
10
The alleged inference may be really a valid inference, but it need not be – we
cannot be sure of it.
B. If the supposed premises are all true statements and the supposed conclusion is
false then –
The alleged inference is no inference at all (because the truth has not been
transmitted).
C. If (one or more of) the supposed premises are false statements and the supposed
conclusions are true statements then –
The supposed inference may be valid but it need not be – we cannot be sure of it.
D. If (one or more of) the supposed premises is false, and the supposed conclusions
are false too, then –
The supposed inference may be valid but it need not be – we cannot be sure of it.
In other words, only in one of the possible cases, i.e., – when the supposed premises
are true and the supposed conclusion is false, we can be sure of something: namely,
that there is certainly no relationship of deducibility between those supposed premises
and supposed conclusions – the alleged inference is invalid. In all other cases the
inference may be either valid or invalid.
It would be very well worth while for the reader to find examples illustrating each
of the points enumerated above, or at least to use our examples from Chapter ⟨III⟩e
for this purpose.

V. The Second Rule About Inference (Converse of the First).
17.f The foregoing analysis enables us to draw a rather important conclusion about
inference.5 Suppose we can be sure that a certain inference is valid. Let us suppose,
furthermore, that we are not certain whether or not our premises are true. Now we
may look at a certain conclusion and, comparing it with the facts, we may discover
that the conclusion is false.
It is clear from the analysis of the foregoing chapter that in such a case at least one
of the premises must be false too. To see this, we have only to consider the following
points:– Let us suppose provisionally that all of the premises are true. Then, as we
have said that the inference is valid, the conclusion would have to be true as well. But
the conclusion is false, therefore the supposition we have provisionally made cannot
be correct: if one of the conclusions is false, at least one of the premises must be false
as well.
Consider our old example 1.
The inference is valid, the relationship of deducibility actually holds between the
premises and the conclusion. Now we may be in a position to compare Mr. Roberts
with Mr. Smith and we may find that he is less tall than Mr. Smith, i.e., we may find
that our conclusion is false. Such a discovery would justify us in saying that at least
one of the premises |
11
must be false as well, because, obviously, it cannot be true that
(as we have now discovered) Mr. Roberts is less tall than Mr. Smith – but (according
to our premises) taller than Mr. Jones, who, again, is taller than Mr. Smith.
We can therefore add to our first rule of inference, – namely to the rule that the
truth of the premises (if they are true) is transmitted by the process of deduction or
inference – a second rule, which is something like its converse:–
If the inference is valid, the falsity of any of the conclusions (if any of them should
be false) is always re-transmitted to at least one of the premises.
This rule does not help us to find out which one of the premises is false.
VI. Some Remarks About the Concept of Truth.
18. In the two foregoing chapters I have very often made use of the word “truth”. I
did so without explaining what I meant by it and I think I was justified in doing so
because I am using this word exactly in the usual sense: we call a statement “true” if
it corresponds with the facts; we will say, e.g., that the statement, “Mr. Roberts is
taller than Mr. Smith” is true, if and only if, Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Smith. In
looking at what I have just said the reader may notice that I have put the statement
5 As I have explained above (in section 10) we need not worry about the fact that we are, in logic,
drawing inferences about inferences; we never can avoid making use of the logical part of our mind
in any scientific investigation.
f This chapter was named “The Second Rule Of Inference (Converse of the First).” in TS1, and has
been renamed to “The Second Rule About Inference (Converse of the First).” in TS2 and TS3.

326

which is said to be true in inverted commas. I did so for conformity with what was
said in 12, for if we say that the statement is true then the object about which we are
speaking is this statement (and not the fact which the statement describes). If we say
that the statement, “Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Smith” is true, then we maintain
something about this statement – namely, that it corresponds with the fact – but we
are not immediately speaking about the fact itself, namely about Mr. Roberts being
taller than Mr. Smith; for if we wanted to say something immediately about this fact,
we would simply say that Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Smith.
Truth, therefore, is a property of statements, namely the property of their corre-
sponding with the facts which they describe. We shall always use the word “truth” in
this sense, which, certainly, agrees well with the ordinary everyday usage of the word
“truth” (although the ordinary usage is not always quite as strict as the usage which
will have to be observed by us).
I wish to add the remark that there has been a long controversy about the concept
of truth, but I am not going to deal with this controversy in this treatment.
VII. Truth in the Sciences and in Logic.
19. It is the task of every scientist to do his best to put forward statements which are
true. He must not attempt to maintain a statement or a theory which is found to be
false, even though it may have been first offered by himself.
This does not imply that this task forbids him to offer any statement the truth of
which is not completely established. On the contrary, there is no doubt about the
fact that science often makes its progress with the help of mistakes, with the help of
theories which later turn out to be false. To forbid the scientist to offer theories the
truth of which is not completely established would mean the strangling of science and
its development, because as a rule this condition cannot be fulfilled, and therefore the
scientist would not be permitted |
12
to say anything.
(We could compare the scientist and the statements or theories advanced by him
with a mother and her children. She will do her best to see that they are always neat
and she will wash them when she finds that they have become dirty – rather than
maintain that they are clean when they are not – but she cannot guarantee their future
cleanliness.)
Keeping in mind the limitations mentioned, we can well agree with the dictum that
the task of the scientist is the search for truth – the search for statements or theories
which are in accordance with the facts he is investigating.
Clearly the realm of facts in which a scientist is interested varies with the different
sciences. The geographer is, for instance, interested in facts which are, as a rule, very
different from the facts in which the student of chemistry is interested.
20. All that we have said can be applied not only to the natural sciences but also to
logic. The search for truth is the task of the logician too – but, certainly, only in the
realm of (rather abstract) facts with which he is concerned.
He therefore won’t be interested in the question whether or not Mr. Brown is taller

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
327
than Mr. Smith, or, in other words, whether or not the statement, “Mr. Brown is taller
than Mr. Smith” is true, but he will be concerned with the question whether or not
the statement mentioned follows logically from the two other statements given in
our first example – in other words, whether or not the statement, “The third sentence
mentioned in Example 1 is a logical consequence of the two others”, is true.
Thus, the logician is interested in logical relations, like deducibility, between
statements as statements – false ones just as much as true ones. He, therefore, does
not worry about the truth of the statements which (together with their relations) are
the objects of his investigation, but he does worry about the truth of those statements
which he maintains about his objects – about the statements under investigation, and
the relationships between them.
13
Chapter I. What Do We Call a “Rule of Inference”?
21. We may now be far enough advanced to formulate a rather general view with
regard to the nature of what we call logical inference, or the drawing of logical
consequences.
Looking back on our examples we can first say the following: drawing a logical
consequence presupposes the constructing of a sentence or statement – the conclusion
– out of one or more given statements – the premises. This construction, certainly, has
to make use of the material supplied by the premises. I shall try to explain this phrase
a little more fully. Image that our premises do not refer at all, say, to Mr. Brown –
that they refer to Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones only. Then, obviously, it would not be
possible to draw such a conclusion from these premises which would give us some
valuable information about Mr. Brown! Similarly, if we speak in our premises, say
about the height only of Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones, then as a rule, we shall not be able
to deduce from these premises any valuable information about, say, the place where
these people live, or their occupation or education etc.
22. That is what I had in mind when I said that the conclusion has to be constructed
out of the material supplied by the premises: it has to be constructed with the help of
the terms – the nouns (or names), adjectives, and perhaps some other words – which
occur in the premises.
Certainly the analysis just given is not sufficient: we have not yet said in what
way the conclusion has to be constructed out of the material of the premises. It is
plain that we can easily construct some statements if we like, out of the material of
some premises, which are not conclusions of those premises. To give a very simple
example: we may construct out of the material of the statement, “Mr. Jones is taller
than Mr. Smith” the statement, “Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Jones”, which latter is
clearly not a logical consequence of the former.
23. It will now be understandable that a logical conclusion is a statement which is
constructed out of the material of the premises – but according to more or less specific

328
Karl R. Popper
rules of construction; and we may now say that it is the main business of what we
usually call “formal logic” to develop these rules. I have said some time previously
that the business of formal logic is to analyse the relationship of deducibility. Now, we
can explain better what was meant by the term “analyse”: it is meant that logic has to
give such rules of construction which enable us to see whether or not the relationship
of deducibility does hold between certain given statements. Usually one calls those
rules which are needed to construct the conclusion out of the material supplied by the
premises the “rules of inference”.
(The famous rules ofthe so-called“syllogism” whichare the centre ofthe traditional
treatment of formal logic, and which will play a central role in our present study, are
just one attempt to give a complete list of the rules of inference.)
At present, while we are dealing not so much with the solution of the problems
of logic, but rather with an introduction to the nature of formal logic, we will not
attempt to develop any of the rules of inference.
24. With the help of what we have said in Nos. 13 to 17 we now can consider (not a
rule of inference itself but) |
14
something about those rules of inference: the rules of
inference will have to be of such a kind that in employing them we will be able to
construct only such conclusions as will be true always if the premises are true; and
such as will be false only if at least one of the premises is false. In other words, the
rules of inference have to fulfil the condition that all inferences which may possibly be
drawn according to those rules, transmit the truth from the premises to the conclusion,
and therefore retransmit (as we have explained above in No. 17) the falsity from the
conclusion to at least one of the premises.
This follows obviously from our previous analyses, but what I am going to say
now does not follow from them – it goes beyond what we have said hitherto.
It is justifiable to call any rule of constructing some statements out of the material of
some other statements a rule of inference if this rule fulfills the conditions mentioned
above, i.e.: if it leads from true statements only to such statements which are true as
well, and therefore: if it leads to a statement which is false, then at least one of the
statements which supply the material (at least one of the premises) must have been
false too.
If we make the suggested decision to call every rule fulfilling those conditions
a rule of inference then we can give here something like a definition6 of the terms
(a) “rule of inference” and with the help of it, definitions of what we call (b) logical
consequence, and (c) of the relationship of deducibility, – thus repeating and summing
up more or less all that we have said hitherto.
(a) A rule of inference is such a rule of constructing a statement – the so-called
conclusion – out of the material supplied by some other statement – the so-called
premises – as fulfills the condition that the truth of the premises will always be
transmitted to the conclusion drawn in accordance with the rule in question (and
that therefore the falsity of the conclusion will be re-transmitted to at least one of
the premises).
6 We shall have to deal later in full with the question of what we do call a definition.

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
329
(b) Drawing a logical consequence means to construct a logical conclusion according
to some rule of inference.
(c) The relationship of deducibility holds between a statement – the so-called
“conclusion”g – and some other statements – the so-called premises – if the
former statement is constructed according to some rule of inference out of the
material supplied by the latter statements.
Why is formal logic called “formal”?
25. So far, when we mentioned the expression “formal logic” we just used it as a name
for a certain kind of interest or, if you like, for a certain science. I have tried to give
the reader some idea of this science with the help of examples and by other means,
but I left the name itself, “formal logic”, unanalysed. Actually it is not important to
know why something has a certain name, for instance why England is called England,
or why biology is called biology. Such questions may be of interest to somebody who
wants to study the history of the language; but as a rule the understanding of the
name would not contribute much towards the understanding of the object to which
this name refers.
15
What I want to explain in the present chapter is therefore not so much the linguistic
side of the name “formal logic” (although it may be mentioned that the word “logic”
comes from the Greek word “logos” which means, first, word, then, knowledge,
science, study and such things). It is rather a certain significant feature of the subject
formal logic about which I want to say something, namely, what one often calls its
formal character.
26. The word “formal” is used by different philosophers in very different ways, and
some controversy is due to misunderstandings originating in ambiguous ways of using
this word. I certainly cannot attempt to enter into this discussion here, and therefore
I do not want to give a definition of the word “formal” (because possibly such a
definition might mislead a student who came across some remarks about the same
thing written by somebody else who might use the word with a different meaning).
But I want to explain something about its use. This I shall do with the help of some
examples and by similar means.
One usually contrasts the formal view-point with the material one. This is done
in different subjects – not only in logic but, for instance, in legal administration. It
will perhaps be convenient to begin with a few remarks about the usage in the latter
subject.
We will illustrate our problem by considering two judges, both, perhaps, excellent
in their way, but with a very different attitude towards both the law and the human
beings involved.
The one may proceed as the famous statue of Justice – blindfolded, with scales in
hand. The judge is applying the letter of the law correctly without considering the
human material with which he is dealing. His own exclusive interest is to classify the
case in the right way – to find the right pigeon-hole for it, so to speak – and then to
apply the law. This is a formal viewpoint, the judge being a formalist.
g TS1 has “consequence” instead of “conclusion”.

330
Karl R. Popper
The other tries to do his best in being just but at the same time tries to understand
and consider the persons and their relations in their individuality. He understands
his task as to help everybody as much as he can (which does not mean that he is
necessarily more lenient than the other type). He applies law not because application
of the law is his last aim but because it is a means in his attempt to help adequately
all persons concerned. He therefore does not try to put every case in a pigeon-hole,
but he will be impressed rather by the diversity of the different cases and by the fate
of the individuals involved. We may call this viewpoint a material one as opposed to
the formal one, because of his interest in the material – in this case human beings –
with which he is dealing.
For the formal viewpoint as opposed to the material, it is characteristic that the
attitude (of the judge) would not be altered if different individuals were involved in
the same type of case.
27. Now let us return to logic. Referring to our Example 1 in section 6: we may have
before us, say, three real men, namely Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith and Mr. Roberts; and we
may compare them first in order to find out whether Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith
and whether Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Jones; and if we make some inference in
order to obtain some information about the question whether Mr. Roberts is taller
than Mr. Smith, – all the time concentrating our interest on those three particular
individuals and their relative height.
16
If we proceed in this way then we could say that our interest, our view-point, is a
material one.
But we may proceed in a different way. We may look at our statements of
Example 1 without being interested in these individual beings, Mr. Jones, Mr. Smith
and Mr. Roberts at all. We may not even be interested in the question whether those
three ever existed at all – and whether it is true if they existed that Mr. Jones is taller
than Mr. Smith etc . . . Our interest may be concentrated exclusively on the fact that,
given such information as is supplied by the two premises of Example 1, we are
entitled to deduce the consequences there given. And, most significant of all these
points, we shall know that even if we actually find that Mr. Jones is not taller than
Mr. Smith (in which case those people obviously do exist), then this information would
not have any effect on the point in which we are interested – for we are not interested
in these persons, but only in the relationship between certain given statements.
The viewpoint thus described is the one characteristic of the feature of logic to
which the word “formal” refers.
28. In No. 10 I mentioned the fact that in substituting the name “Mr. Brown” for
that of Mr. Smith wherever it occurs in a certain set of statements the relationship of
deducibility – if such a relationship holds between the statements in question – would
not be affected.
To express the same thing in more general terms: we may take any example of
a logical reference we like – and therefore indeed any of the examples 1, 2, 4 and
No. 6 –, and we may replace any one term (or any two or any three and so on, . . .
different terms) wherever it occurs in the example under conisderation by any other
term which fits, so to speak, into its place, and the relationship of deducibility will

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
331
hold between the new statements thus constructed. I have just used the words “which
fits into its place” and I wish to illustrate these words by some examples.
We may, as I have mentioned, replace the name “Mr. Smith” by the name
“Mr. Brown”. In the same way any other name of a person would fit into the place
where the name of the person stood before – we can therefore just as well replace, for
instance, the name “Mr. Jones” or the name “Mr. Roberts” by the name “Mr. Brown”,
and, clearly, by the name “Mr. Hammersmith”. But not only can we alter the names
– we can easily alter the term “taller” wherever it occurs in Example 1 to the term
“less tall” or, perhaps, “richer” or “wiser”, and the relationship of deducibility would
not be altered. However, should we try to replace the term “Mr. Jones” by the term
“wiser”, or perhaps “stouter”, then such a replacement would not fit at all – the series
of words so constructed would not make a correct, meaningful sentence at all.7,h
29. What we have just discussed, the possibility of replacing certain terms in the
sentences under consideration by some other (fit, or as we may say, appropriate)
terms, without affecting the relationship of deducibility between the statements,
may be regarded as another attempt to characterise the “formal” side of logic. This
characterisation |
17
is, perhaps, a little more strict than what we said previously about
this point, because it explains the matter without talking about such rather vague
things as our “interest”. (The reader will remember that the previous explanation of
the word “formal” was more or less based on the distinction between our interest
in some people or some things or some facts and our interest in the relationship of
deducibility between certain statements.) It is, I hope, clear, that it is the same point,
namely, the formal character of logic, which I tried to explain with the help of the new
formulation; the possibility of replacing the terms by some other terms is obviously
closely connected with the fact that it is irrelevant to the specific logical view-point,
to which special subjects we actually refer in our statements.
It has to be noticed that not only is the relationship of deducibility – if such a
relationship should hold between the statements under consideration – not affected
by any appropriate alteration of the terms, but also if such a relationship does not
hold between the statements under consideration, the appropriate alteration of a
term wherever it occurs would never transform such a set of statements into a set of
statements between which the relationship of deducibility would hold.i
30.⟨TS2,TS3⟩Let us now see how our original examples,e.g.,the one about Mr. Smith
comply with what we have just said about formal inferences. We have seen that the
7 In pursuing this point we would find that all those terms which fit into a certain place in a statement
will generally all fit into a certain place in another statement, if one of them fits into this place; and
none of them would fit if one did not. The class of all terms which fit into one and the same place in
a statement is sometimes called a “semantic” or “syntactic category”, sometimes a “logical type.”
The examples given should make it clear that there must be at least more than one different logical
type (or semantic ⟨category⟩).

Karl R. Popper
particular name “Mr. Smith” is not significant in our deduction; we could replace it
just as well by the name “Mr. Field”, or “Mr. 𝑋”, or simply by “𝑋”.
What we have to infer now is: do such words as “taller” (or “taller than”) have
any significance in our deduction?
Our original example was:
(Premises: )
Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith;
Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Roberts;
(Conclusion: )
Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Roberts.
It is clear that we can replace in this example the word “taller” by very many
other words without influencing, or rather, without damaging the relationship of
deducibility. Such words by which we can replace “taller”, are, for instance, “smaller”
or “richer”, “poorer”, and so on. And we can equally well replace the two words
“taller than” by words like “equally tall” or perhaps, by “is living in the north of”, or
“is living in the neighbourhood of”, or, “is a relative of”. (The last example will be of
considerable interest in what follows.)
The examples given may suggest that the words “taller than” play a role analogous
to the role played by the proper names; it may be supposed, namely, that we can
replace the words “taller than” by any expression which fits into the place held by
these words, or as we have said, by any appropriate expression. But that is not so. We
can give what may be called counter-examples, i.e. examples of words which fit the
place held by the words “taller than”, at the same time destroying the relationship
of deducibility. Such counter-examples would be, for instance, “is living next to”
(although it is nearly the same as “is living in the neighbourhood of”) or, “is the father
of” (although it is very near to the example “is a relative of”).
18(TS2, TS3)
If we replace the words “taller than” by either of the two counter-examples just
mentioned, then it is obvious that, from the premises thus formed, the conclusion
would not follow any more;
In other words:
Even if the following two sentences were true:
“Mr. Jones is living next to Mr. Smith”, and,
“Mr. Smith is living next to Mr. Roberts”,
the following sentence need not be true:
“Mr. Jones is living next to Mr. Roberts”.
Similarly, even if the following two sentences were true:
“Peter is the father of Paul”, and,
“Paul is the father of Jack”,
the following sentence would be, obviously not true:
“Peter is the father of Jack”.
In other words, if we substitute such words as “is living next to”, or, “is the
father of”, then the truth of the sentences which have been premises is not any more

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
333
transmitted to the sentence which has been the conclusion. Thus the relationship of
deducibility breaks down.
31.⟨TS2, TS3⟩We call such relations as “taller than”, or, “to the left of”, and so on – in
general, such relations that, if the relation holds between 𝐴and 𝐵and between 𝐵and
𝐶, then it holds also between 𝐴and 𝐶– we call such relations “transitive relations”.
All relations which are transitive can obviously be, in our example, substituted for
the relation “taller than” without damaging the relationship of deducibility; and only
transitive relations can be substituted.
Keeping this in mind we can say that the two premises:
“Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”, and,
“Mr. Smith is taller than Mr. Roberts”,
are by themselves not sufficient for the deduction of the conclusion:
“Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Roberts”.
They are sufficient only if we know, or if we take into account that, “taller than” is
a transitive relation. If we do not know this, or if we do not consider it, then the
premises would be insufficient for drawing the conclusion.
Now, it is obviously our task in making formal deductions to formulate explicitly
all premises which we have in our minds as far as they are needed for the drawing
of the conclusion. Thus, we can say that our two premises in the above example are
really insufficient; in order to be able to draw correctly purely formal inferences, we
have to add a third premise, which expresses that “taller than” is transitive. Therefore,
the really correct formal deduction would be the following:
From the three premises,
“Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”,
“Mr Smith is taller than Mr. Roberts”, and
“‘taller than’ is a transitive relation”,
we can deduce the sentence: “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Roberts”.
19 (TS2, TS3)
32.⟨TS2, TS3⟩If we consider this last-rectified-example, then we shall see that in
this new example (embodying a new third premise) we can now really replace the
words “taller than” by any expression whatsoever, provided that it fits into the place.
Our former counter-examples are not any more counter-examples now, because they
would most obviously render this third premise false; and we know that we are not
permitted to say that the deducibility does not hold between some alleged premises
and some alleged conclusion, on the grounds that the conclusion is false, if one of the
premises was false too. Besides, we could say that if the relation, e.g. “is the father
of”, were transitive (which is not the case) then obviously the conclusion would hold.
Generally speaking, we can say that an inference is correct only if formulated in
such a way that all these replacable, descriptive, terms can actually be replaced by
any fitting term whatsoever, without damaging the relationship of deducibility.

Karl R. Popper
Chapter II. The Use of Symbols and Variables in Logic.
33.⟨TS2, TS3; 30. in TS1⟩Even in daily life we are sometimes in a situation which
has some similarities with the situation described in the last sections. I suppose you
will sometimes have received an advertising circular addressed “To the Householder”
or “To a Garden-Lover”. Let us consider for a moment the somewhat subtle logical
difference between such an address and an address like “To Subscribers of ‘The
Press’”.
If we write an address like the latter – “To Subscribers of ‘The Press’”, or, “To all
who are Interested in Music”, or “To all Concerned” – then we intend to address, so
to speak, a whole crowd; we are not addressing single persons, single individuals,
but rather the public. Thus, our intention would not be met if we should substitute
for “To all Concerned” simply the different proper names of different men who are
concerned.
On the other hand the address “To the Householder” on some advertising pamphlets
is intended to stand there because we either don’t know or don’t care to put the different
single proper names – of Mr. Harris, Mr. Jameson, etc. – on the different envelopes.
Thus the address “To the Householder” has the following function: it has to indicate
something like an empty space which has to be filled up with his own name by
everybody who receives the letter. (Of course nobody will actually fill it up but
everybody understands how it is meant and that it is intended as a letter which might
have been addressed to him personally.)
We can speak of such an address as “To the Householder” as a variable name.
There are not very many occasions in ordinary life when we use such variables. We
sometimes speak of “Mr. 𝑋” or perhaps of “Mr. What’s His Name” or “Mr. So-and-So”
or perhaps of “Whosoever it may be”, and we use |
20(TS2, TS3)
such phrases not quite consistently;
we use them sometimes instead of a name because we have forgotten the name, but
sometimes – and that is the kind of use in which we are interested here – we use them
with the clear intention of leaving the question open as to which special proper name
has to be substituted for the phrase used as a variable name.
There are even fewer occasions in ordinary life when we use variables for
expressions other than the proper names. We sometimes say “You can’t eat your cake
and have it.”. Here the words “eat”, “cake” and “have” are metaphors. They have
a definite meaning – everybody knows what a cake is and what eating is, but the
metaphor is used to cover many possible variations – it is used with the intention
that we may replace the words “cake” and “eat” by other terms, for instance by the
corresponding terms in the expression “You can’t have your bath and be dry” and any
other expression indicating that you cannot perform mutually exclusive actions; in
so far as we intend that the words “cake” and “eat” should play, actually, the role of
certain variables for which everybody may substitute those terms which apply to the
special situation in which he is interested.
We can sum up what we have said about variables in ordinary language: they
are sometimes used, though not very often, and mostly with the help of phrases like
metaphors which, as a rule, do not indicate perfectly unambiguously and clearly our
intention to use a variable. The only phrase of our language used as a variable of

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
335
which I am aware at the moment is the phrase “So-and-So” (for instance in the sense
of “Mr. So-and-So”); like the use of the letter “𝑋” in the expression “Mr. 𝑋”. This
would clearly indicate that a variable actually does not belong to ordinary language;
it is already an adoption from the scientific language of mathematics or perhaps even
of logic.
34.⟨TS2, TS3; 31. in TS1⟩Let us now go back to logic and let us consider again
our Example 1 of section 6. We said in section 28 that it is irrelevant for the logical
relationships between statements whether we substitute the name “Mr. Brown” for
the name “Mr. Smith”, wherever it occurs. Clearly that does not depend on our choice
of the name, “Mr. Brown”: we could substitute any other name we like so long as
we consider strictly that (a) we have to substitue one and the same name every time
wherever the name “Mr. Smith” occurs, and (b) that we must not use one of the
other names already used in the statements under consideration, like Mr. Jones or
Mr. Roberts.
What we have just said can be expressed in the following way: the logical
relationship between the statements under consideration would still be the same if
we should use a variable name instead of the name, “Mr. Smith”, and if we agreed
at the same time that any special name – or any constant name, as we may say (the
word “constant” is generally used as the opposite of the word “variable”) – might be
substituted for the variable. If we do this our Example 1 would assume the following
form:
Example 1, a. If we have the two sentences, “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. 𝑋”, and
“Mr. Roberts is taller than Mr. Jones”, then the sentence “Mr. Roberts is taller
than Mr. 𝑋” is a logical consequence of the two previous sentences – and will
remain so if we replace the variable “𝑋” wherever it occurs in the three sentences
by one and the same arbitrarily chosen proper name.
If we look at this Example 1, a it suggests itself that it was rather casually that we
did replace only the name “Smith” by the symbol “𝑋”, which indicates a variable.
Obviously we could just as well have chosen any one of the |
21(TS2, TS3)
two other names to
replace it by a variable name. Or, we can replace two names, or even all three names,
by variables. If we adopt the latter course all constant proper names would disappear.
If we want to proceed in this way we have to be careful about one special point: we
cannot use the letter “𝑋” to replace more than one of the three names in our examples.
We would not express our Example 1 adequately if we should, for instance, write
that from the two sentences, “Mr. 𝑋is taller than Mr. 𝑋”, and “Mr. 𝑋is taller than
Mr. 𝑋”, the sentence “Mr. 𝑋is taller than Mr. 𝑋” can be deduced. (Replacing in such
a way different proper names by one and the same variable symbol we obviously alter
the meaning of our example; although it is still true that the third of the statements
just mentioned would follow from any of the two foregoing statements and therefore
from both.)
Thus, if we want to express much the same idea as we did with the help of
Example 1 and 1, a, but replacing the constant names by variables, then we have to
make use of different variables for the different names and to write something like
this:–

336
Karl R. Popper
Example 1, b. If we have the two sentences, “Mr. 𝑋is taller than Mr. 𝑌”, and “Mr. 𝑍
is taller than Mr. 𝑋”, then the sentence “Mr. 𝑍is taller than Mr. 𝑌” will be a
logical consequence of the two previous sentences – and will remain so if we
replace the variable “𝑋” wherever it occurs in the three sentences by one and the
same arbitrarily chosen constant proper name, and if we replace it in a similar
way with the two other variables. (We have only to be careful to see that we have
to replace in all three statements a certain definite variable by one and the same
constant proper name.)
If we look at the new Example 3 then we see that the use of different variables is
more or less inevitable if we want to express adequately with the help of variables
what we expressed in Example 1 with the help of constant names. In ordinary life
we hardly ever (if at all) have occasion to use more than one variable, and it is
therefore understandable that ordinary language simply does not possess the means
of expressing different variables. It is already a highly artificial language in which
such variables as 𝑋, 𝑌and 𝑍(and we can easily introduce others) are used; it may be
that it is to a certain extent the use of variables which renders logic so artificial and
abstract to the beginner.
35.⟨TS2, TS3; 32. in TS1⟩In logic not only such variables are used as may be replaced
by constant names of persons or things, but some other variables as well, for instance
we may use, sometimes, variables which can be replaced by the name of a whole
sentence (as a rule by the name of any section whatsoever). Consider, for instance,
the following example, which expresses a very important logical rule (a rule which
we may call the rule of transitiveness of the relationship of deducibility):
Example R. If the statement 𝐴is a logical consequence of the statement 𝐵, and if the
statement 𝐶is a logical consequence of the statement 𝐴, then the statement 𝐶is
always a logical consequence of the statement 𝐵as well.
In this Example 𝐴, 𝐵and 𝐶are obviously used as variable names of sentences.
Lastly, I wish to mention that we sometimes make use in logic of variables which
do not represent names of sentences, but the sentences themselves. Consider, for
instance, the following example:
See section 12.
Example S.
22(TS2, TS3)
A statement of the form “If 𝑝then 𝑝”, will always be a true statement
whatever the sentences we may substitute for “𝑝”, provided, of course that we
substitute one and the same sentence both times. (For instance, the statement, “If
it rains tomorrow then it rains tomorrow” will quite obviously be a true statement
whatever the weather may be tomorrow, and the same will hold, for instance, if
we substitute both times the sentence “I like logic”.)
I want to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that in the foregoing example
the letter “𝑝” was used as a variable for a sentence itself and not for a name of a
sentence, whilst in Example R the variables were used as variables for names of
sentences: in Example R we were referring to our speaking about certain sentences,
and that can be done only with the help of names, as was explained in No. 12 (just as

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
337
we have to use a name for the table, – for instance the word “table” – and not the table
itself, if we want to talk about the table). As opposed to this consider Example S. In a
statement like “If I like logic then I like logic” we do not talk about, we do not refer
to, this statement, “I like logic”: what we do is simply to state something in such a
way that the sentence “I like logic” occurs as a part of our statement without being in
any way the object about which our statement is stating something. (The statement
“If I like logic then I like logic” is in this respect similar to a statement like “I like
logic and I like psychology”: it is a statement composed of other statements, and not
a statement about those other statements.
36.⟨TS2, TS3; 33. in TS1⟩To conclude about the rule of variables in logic, the
formal character of logic which we tried to describe before has such an effect on logic
that all logical considerations which hold with regard to some special constants as
a rule hold with regard to some other constants as well. In expressing such logical
considerations we have, therefore, often to make use of variables – thus indicating
that our considerations are not dependent on special constant values. The symbols
used to indicate variables are highly artificial symbols because ordinary language
does not supply us with the necessary means of expressing variables. We generally
use letters like “𝐴”, “𝐵”, . . .; “𝑋”, “𝑌”, . . .; “𝑝”, “𝑞”, and so on to indicate different
kinds of variables.
Roughly speaking one could say that the more we develop our logical system and
the more the system is generalised, the more we shall have to make use of the symbols
which indicate variables. If the use is highly developed then one usually speaks about
“symbolic logic”, but the use of artificial symbols in logic is a matter of degree –
even traditional logic (“Aristotelian logic”) has to make use of some symbolism in
indicating variables.
Chapter III. Descriptive
23(TS2, TS3)
and Logical Constants. The Logical
Form of Statements and Arguments.
37.⟨TS2, TS3⟩j Names like “Mr. Smith”, “Mr. Brown” and so on, have been character-
ized as constant names, or constants – as opposed to variables – for which constants
can be substituted. We have seen that the meaning of these constants is not relevant
to the problem of deducibility.
Words playing a very similar role are, e.g. “table”, “chair”, “cow”, etc. For it is
clear that in the example:
j The chapter “Descriptive and Logical Constants. The Logical Form of Statements and Arguments.”
is only contained in TS2 and TS3, where it forms Chapter III.

338
Karl R. Popper
(Premises: )
All men are mortal.
All Frenchmen are men.
(Conclusion: )
All Frenchmen are mortal.
we could without disturbing the relationship of deducibility, replace e.g., the word
“men” (wherever it occurs) by the word “cows” (and, if you like, “Frenchmen” by
“French cows”); and similarly, we could replace, without disturbing the relationship
of deducibility, the word “mortal” by the word “immortal” or, if you like, “thirty” by
any other word which fits the place.
Thus, such words, the meaning of which has no influence on deducibility, can be
called “descriptive constants”, and the variables, which may take their place, and for
which descriptive constants can be substituted, can be called “descriptive variables”.
38.⟨TS2, TS3⟩A role which is very different indeed is played by words like “is”,
“are”, “not”, “all”, “some”, “or”, “and”, “if . . . then”.
If we consider our last example (in 37), then we see at once: although we can
replace “mortal” by “immortal”, wherever it occurs, it would destroy the relationship
of deducibility if we were to replace “all” by “some”, wherever it occurs; and
this, although the word “some” obviously, fits the place excellently. Similarly, the
relationship of deducibility would break down if we were to replace “are” wherever it
occurs, by the words “are not”, although these words would also fit very well. The
words “is”, “are”, “not”, “all”, “some”, “or”, “and”, “if . . . then”, which play a role
not very different from the role played by descriptive constants and variables, shall
be called “logical constants”.
39.⟨TS2, TS3⟩But what is the character of words like “taller than”, “richer than”,
“father of”, and so on? These words are names of relations and they are, as such,
certainly of a kind different from “Mr. Brown”, or, “table” or, “cow”. (By the way –
even the words “Mr. Brown” and “Peter”, are not exactly the same kind as the words
“table” and “cow”; nevertheless, both kinds are descriptive constants.)
That the names of relations are of a kind different from, e.g., the proper names,
can be seen by the fact that they do not fit into the places where proper names do, and
vice versa.
Nevertheless, we shall classify “richer than”, “father of”, with the descriptive
constants; for it is, as we have seen in sections 31–33, possible, to replace such words
by words of an entirely different meaning without disturbing the deducibility. |
24(TS2, TS3)
On the
other hand, the term “transitive” (and some other similar terms, describing certain
properties of relations) has to be classified with the logical constants. Other logical
constants would be the words “true” and “false”. Words which can be defined with
the help of logical constants alone, are always logical constants.
40.⟨TS2, TS3⟩If we replace in a statement all the ⟨descriptive⟩constants by dots,
then what remains can be called the scaffolding, or framework of the sentence; e.g.,
the framework of the sentence,
“All men are mortal”,

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
339
would be,
“All . . . are . . .”
Thus,the scaffolding or framework of a sentence is given when (a) the logical constants
are given, (b) their order, and, (c) the empty places into which the descriptive constants
or variables may be fitted.
That the order of the logical constants is of significance may be seen from the
examples,
“All . . . are not . . .”
and,
“Not all . . . are . . .”,
which represent different frameworks.
We can now explain the term “logical form of a sentence”: the logical form of
a sentence is given when (a) its scaffolding is given, (b) the kind of the descriptive
constants or variables which might be fitted into the framework, and, (c) an indication
which of the descriptive constants or variables, if any, occur more often than once,
and where they do re-occur.
For instance, the logical form of
“Peter is taller than Paul”,
is given by,
“. . . is xxx - - -”
and the explanation that “. . .” and “- - -” indicate places into which proper names
may be fitted, whilst “xxx” indicates the place where the name of a relation (between
individuals) may be fitted.
Similarly, the logical form of the statement:
“All men are men”,
would be given by,
“All . . . are . . .”,
together with the explanation, that in both places indicated by “. . .”, the same
descriptive (class-) name has to be substituted.
Similarly, the logical form of a set of premises (together with a conclusion), i.e. the
logical form of an argument, is given when the form of its different statements is given,
together with an indication of the repetitions of the descriptive terms throughout the
whole argument; e.g.:
(Premises: )
All . . . are - - -
All xxx are . . .
(Conclusion: )
All xxx are - - -

340
Karl R. Popper
where the repetition of “. . .”, “- - -”, “xxx” indicates a repetition of descriptive terms,
can be taken as the description of the logical form of an argument.
41.⟨TS2, TS3⟩
25(TS2, TS3)
The writing of “. . .” or of “- - -”, together with an explanation, is not a
very practical way of explaining or describing the logical form of a sentence or an
argument; as a matter of fact, the best way is using variables instead of the dots and
dashes.
Thus the logical form of the sentence:
“All men are men”,
can be easily indicated by writing:
“All 𝑌are 𝑌”
or,
“All 𝑋are 𝑋”.
We have only to be careful to explain that we are using this for characterising a logical
form, and we have to indicate, in some way or other, which kind of descriptive terms
are represented by the variables used.
Similarly, we can describe the logical form of
“Paul is taller than Max”,
by saying that its logical form is:
“𝑋𝑅𝑌”,
when we explain that we use “𝑋” and “𝑌” and “𝑍” as variables representing proper
names, and that we use “𝑅”, “𝑆”, “𝑇” as variables representing relations (between
individuals).
Thus, it is just another use of variables if we use them for describing or representing
the logical form of a statement.
Chapter IV. Statements Which Are Formally True. Analytic and
Synthetic Sentences.
42.⟨TS2, TS3; 34. in TS1⟩k In example 𝑆, No. 35l, we were dealing with a statement
of a kind which we can call “formally true”: this statement “If I like logic then I like
logic” is true independently of all matters of fact – it can be decided to be true even
by somebody who does not know me and who does not know what logic is. We can

Statements” instead.
l TS1 correctly refers to section 32.

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
341
discover its truth, so to speak, without having to discover anything about the facts –
just by considering its logical (or, if you like, grammatical) form.
26(TS2, TS3)
If we use, as before, the letter “𝑝” as such a variable as indicates that any whole
sentence may be substituted for it (thus “𝑝” can be called a “variable sentence”), then
we can say that any statement of the form “If 𝑝then 𝑝” (where “𝑝” may be replaced
by any sentence whatsoever) is a formally true statement.
Similarly we can easily construct statements which are, so to speak, formally false,
i.e., statements the falsity of which can be found out by considering their logical or
grammatical form only and without taking into consideration any matters of fact.
In order to construct such a formally false statement we may employ a very simple
device: we need only take a formally true statement and deny it. Thus, the statement
“If I like logic then I don’t like logic” would be a formally false statementm.
It is important to see how very different the character of such formally true or
formally false statements is compared with ordinary statements, as for instance, “I
like logic”.
The question whether or not an ordinary statement is true depends on the facts
to which the statement refers (cf. No. 18): if somebody wants to know whether his
statement is true then an inspection of the statement itself will never help him to find
out; he is bound to ask me or to observe my behaviour or to take other steps of that
kind which may give him some information about the facts.
43.⟨TS2, TS3; 35. in TS1⟩In ordinary life we nearly always use only such kinds of
statements the truth or falsity of which can be made out only by inspecting the facts
to which they refer. One often calls such statements “Synthetic statements”8 – as
opposed to the “analytic statements”8 – the truth or falsity of which can be made out
by analysing the logical and grammatical form of the statement itself, without any
reference to facts.
As I have said, almost every ordinary statement is a synthetic statement. Examples
would be very easy to find: “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith”, or “There is a table
in room 48”, or “It will be raining tomorrow” are obviously all synthetic. A synthetic
statement supplies us with some more or less valuable information about matters
of fact. The facts described need not always be entirely concrete facts. They may
sometimes be more abstract. A statement like “The third statement in quotation marks
of Example 1 in section 6 of the present treatise is a logical consequence of the two
other statements in quotation marks”. This statement is itself a synthetic statement
because merely by analysing its logical form alone without considering the objects to
which it refers, i.e., the statements in Example 1, we would never be able to find out
whether or not it is true.
As opposed to this, analytic statements do not supply us with any valuable
information about matters of fact. If somebody tells me that it will rain tomorrow
supposing it rains tomorrow, then I am none the wiser for that – I have not obtained
8 The use of this kind of terminology is due to the German philosopher Kant.
m The statement is, of course, contradictory, but it is not the negation of the tautology considered
above.

342
Karl R. Popper
any information about tomorrow’s weather. (I hope it is clear that the logical situation
with regard to the statement “It will rain tomorrow supposing it rains tomorrow” is
the same as the situation with regard to the statement “If it rains tomorrow then it
rains tomorrow”, which, obviously, is an instance of an analytic statement of the form
“If 𝑝then 𝑝” which we discussed above.)
It
27(TS2, TS3)
is now obvious why analytic statements are not used in ordinary life: we speak
in ordinary life with the aim of supplying information about matters of fact, and
analytic statements do not do this. However, it is not only in ordinary life that we
use almost exclusively synthetic statements: all those sciences which are sometimes
called natural sciences, and history, and most of the social sciences aim at supplying
us with information about the facts of nature, or about the facts of the history of
mankind or of social institutions, and are, therefore, concerned almost exclusively
with synthetic statements.
Only logic (and perhaps some other branches of philosophy) and mathematicians
make use to any extent of analytic statements. For us at the present moment it is of
great importance to be perfectly clear about the distinction between those two classes
of statement and about the fact that any statement whatsoever must be either synthetic
or analytic.
Analytic statements can be distinguished into such as are formally true and such as
are formally false. The true analytic statements are sometimes called “positive analytic
statements”, or simply “analytic statements”, in the narrower sense (sometimes they
are also called “tautologies”), whilst the false analytic statements are sometimes
called “negative analytic statements”, or, more often, “self-contradictions”, or simply
“contradictions”.
44.⟨TS2, TS3; 36. in TS1⟩These terms can easily be remembered in the following
way: “Analytic” statements are those the truth or falsity of which can be found out by
logical analysis alone, without making use of any kind of experience of facts. The
term “tautology”9, which literally means the saying of the same thing twice over
in different words, and which is commonly applied to statements like “A table is a
table” (which obviously would be another example of a positive analytic statement),
is meant to suggest that no formally true, or positive analytic statement is able to
give us more information than a statement like “A table is a table”; and lastly, the
term, “self-contradiction”, or, more shortly, “contradiction”, is used to indicate that
the statement witnesses against itself – like, perhaps, the statement “A table is not a
table”.
9 The use of this term and the term “contradiction” in approximately the sense adopted here is due
to the German philosopher, Schopenhauer, and to Russell’s pupil, Wittgenstein.

Chapter V. Some Famous Analytic Statements – The So-Called
“Laws of Thought”.
45.⟨TS2, TS3; 37. in TS1⟩n Although formally true statements or analytic statements
in the narrower sense have no importance for ordinary communications, we have said
that they play a certain role in logic. Some of them became famous, not so much
because of their special significance, but rather because of the name which was given
to them: they were called the laws of thought, in my opinion a name which is very
apt to lead to confusion and misunderstanding; but I will not discuss the |
28(TS2, TS3)
question
why they were so-called before the last chapter of this treatmento, which deals with
the problem of the nature of logic, and I here ask the reader just to accept the fact
that they are named “the laws of thought” and not to attempt to include any special
reasons with the use of this name.
The first of the formally true statements to which I shall refer is generally called the
Law of Identity. To make it clear may we refer to the example given: we said before
that the statement “A table is a table” is formally true, or analytic (or a tautology).
Using variables we can say that generally speaking every statement of the form “𝑋is
𝑋”, where any term (or any noun rather) may be substituted for the variable “𝑋”, is
analytic.
The traditional way of formulating this fact would be simple:
The Law of Identity: 𝑋is 𝑋.
In order to explain the two other so-called laws of thought – one usually speaks
of them as “The Law of Contradiction” and “The Law of the Excluded Middle” –
we have to add some new symbols the symbolism with the help of which we are
indicating variables.
46.⟨TS2, TS3; 38. in TS1⟩If we have a certain statement, say, “It will rain tomorrow”,
then the statement “It will not rain tomorrow” is called a negation of the former
statement. It is easy to construct examples of statements and of their negations, for
instance: the negation of the statement “Mr. Jones is taller than Mr. Smith” would
be the statement “Mr. Jones is not taller than Mr. Smith”; and the negation of the
statement, “Five times five equals twenty-five” would be the statement, “Five times
five does not equal twenty-five”.
It is easy to see that if a statement is true then its negation will always be false and
vice versa: if a statement is false then its negation is true. This rather important law
holds equally for statements which are formally true, or analytic, and formally false,
or contradictory on the one hand and such statements as are synthetic and therefore
true, or false, according as they correspond with the facts or do not. (Analogous to
the expression “formally true” we speak in the case of synthetic statements often of
their “material truth” or “material falsity”, indicating by this means that the truth or
falsity depends on their accordance with the matters described.)
n This is Chapter IV in TS1.
o The typescripts do not contain any further chapters.

344
Karl R. Popper
It is very convenient indeed to make use of the following symbolism in order
to indicate that a certain variable statement is the negation of some other variable
statement: If we choose to denote a variable statement by “𝑝” then we shall denote its
negation by the symbol “ 𝑝”, i.e., we shall use the same letter but with a horizontal
stroke over it. It is customary to read the symbol for the negation of 𝑝, i.e., the symbol
“ 𝑝” as “non-𝑝”.10
In a way similar to that in which we symbolised the negation of a variable sentence,
we can symbolise a variable name of a sentence which is the negation of some other
sentence, for which we have chosen some variable name. If, for instance, we have
chosen for one sentence the variable name “𝐴”, then the name of the negation of that
sentence can be symbolised by “𝐴”, which may, again, be read as “non-𝐴”. |
29(TS2, TS3)
With
the help of this demonstration we can, for instance, formulate the rule mentioned in
the paragraph before the last; we can express it as follows: If 𝐴is true then 𝐴is false,
and if 𝐴is true, 𝐴is false – whatever name of a statement may be substituted for 𝐴.
Lastly, we can introduce an analogous symbolism for such variable terms as
describe certain properties. If we have, for instance, the statement “This piece of
metal is round”, then we can form the following statement which is something rather
similar to a negation but not quite the same: “This piece of metal is something which
is not-round”, where “not-round” may be looked at as forming one-term, namely, a
term which is opposed in a certain way to the term “round”. The relationship between
the terms “round” and “not-round” has to be understood in the following way: we
shall say that a thing has the property of being not-round in any case in which it does
not have the property of being round. In a similar way we can speak of something as
being not-black if it has some other colour but not the black colour; or as being a
not-animal or a not-horse or a not-stone if it is something, whatever it may be, but
not an animal, not a horse, or not a stone, respectively.
It is customary to call the property of being a not-table complementary, contra-
dictory or negative to the property of being a table, and one speaks accordingly of a
complementary property, contradicting or negative of some other property, and of the
complementary term of some other term.
If we use symbols like, say, “𝑃”, “𝑄”, “𝑅”, “𝑆”, to denote terms of which the
complementary term can be constructed, then we can in the same way as that we
introduced above denote those complementary terms with the help of the symbols
“𝑃”, “𝑄” ,“𝑅”, “𝑆”.
47.⟨TS2, TS3; 39. in TS1⟩Now we can return to the third so-called “law of thought”.
We shall first consider what one usually calls the “Law of Contradiction”. We have
already had an example of self-contradiction – at the end of section ⟨44⟩p – namely,
the statement, “A table is not a table”. It is obvious that any statement of the form “𝑅
is 𝑅”, where we may substitute any term like “a house”, “a stone” and so on for the
variable symbol “𝑅” and correspondingly the term “a not-house”, or “a not stone”
10 There are many different ways of symbolising the negation in use, for instance, the symbols “−𝑝”
or “∼𝑝”. We will use here exclusively the symbol described in the text above.
p This reference should refer to section 44 in TS2 and TS3. All three typescripts refer to section 36,
which is correct only for TS1.

19 Lecture Notes on Logic
345
and so on for the term “𝑅”, will be a self-contradictory statement, i.e., formally false.
Thus we may formulate the Law of Contradiction in its first form: Any statement of
the form “𝑅is 𝑅” where we may substitute for R any term of which a complementary
term can be constructed, is formally false.
The second form of the Law of Contradiction can be formulated with the help
of sentential variables as follows: Any statement of the form “𝑝and 𝑝”, where we
may substitute for the variable “𝑝” any sentence whatsoever, (and correspondingly
the negation of this sentence for the symbol “ 𝑝”) is a formally false statement, i.e.,
contradictory.
Examples of such statements can easily be found; the statement, “Mr Jones is taller
than Mr. Smith and Mr. Jones is not taller than Mr. Smith”, or “I like logic and I do
not like logic”, or “Three times two equals six and three times two does not equal six”
– and just as well “Three times two equals seven and three times two does not equal
seven”; all of these may be taken as examples of such statements as are formally false
according to the Law of Contradiction.
There are some other forms of the Law of Contradiction but I think that these two
may suffice.
48.⟨TS2, TS3; 40. in TS1⟩
30(TS2, TS3)
The third of the so-called “Laws of Thought” is named
“The Law of Excluded Middle”. I will give first some examples.
The statement, “That piece of metal is either something round or something not-
round”, or the statement “This animal is either a horse or a not-horse”, is obviously
formally true, i.e., analytic. This can be generalised with the help of the first form of
the Law of the Excluded Middle: Any statement of the form “𝑋is 𝑃or 𝑃”, where
any term may be substituted for the variable “𝑋” and any such term the complement
of which can be constructed may be substituted for the variable “𝑃”, is a formally
true statement, i.e., a tautology.
As to the second form of the Law of the Excluded Middle, we can start with the
following example: The statement “It will rain tomorrow or it will not rain tomorrow”
is obviously formally true and so is the statement “I like logic or I don’t like logic.”
Generally speaking we may say this, giving the second form of the Law of the
Excluded Middle: Any statement of the form “𝑝or 𝑝”, where we may substitute for
“𝑝” any sentence whatsoever, is a formally true statement.
49.⟨TS2, TS3; 41. in TS1⟩The so-called Law of Contradiction and the so-called Law
of the Excluded Middle have to do with the conjunctions “and” and “or” respectively.
That makes it easy to remember them.
The traditional formulation of these two laws is something like this:
Law of Contradiction: Nothing can be both 𝑃and 𝑃.
Law of the Excluded Middle: Everything must be either 𝑃or 𝑃–
there is no third possibility.
(The last remark explains the name “Law of the Excluded Middle”; that there is no
third possibility may be formulated as “It is excluded that something may have a
property which, so to speak, lies between 𝑃and 𝑃”.)

The Origins of Modern Logic
Karl R. Popper
Abstract These are unpublished lecture notes from Popper’s Nachlass.
Editorial notes: The source typescript is from KPS Box 366, Folder 19. The text refers to Popper in
the third person, which suggests that these are lecture notes that were prepared by one of Popper’s
students. There is a reference to Popper’s lecture notes on logic of 1939–1941 (cf. this volume,
Chapter 19), which indicates that he gave these lectures during the same period or shortly afterwards.
The page numbers skip number 9, but no page seems to be missing. The typescript uses the notation
𝑝for the negation of 𝑝.

logic has had a recent and rapid growth and represents a complete break away
from the traditional or Aristotelian logic. We do not mean by this that no relationships
can be established between the two logics, on the contrary the Aristotelian logic of
syllogism is to be regarded as a small, and not very well formulated portion of the
whole field of modern logic, but that the new logic owes only little of its development
to the older logic.
The first steps towards a new logic came from the work of mathematicians such as
Frege and Peano who used deductive logical methods in working out the foundations
of Arithmetic, and Cantor who in his work on infinity introduced the notion of classes
or aggregates.
From another angle Boole and Peirce contributed to the rise of the new logic by
using mathematical symbolism and methods to state and work out the principles of
logic.
Russell’s work in Principia Mathematicaa consists largely in bringing together the
work of all these men.
These sources of modern logic emphasize its main differences from traditional
logic:
1. The traditional logic had no contact with mathematics. Now whatever view
one takes of the nature of mathematics, it is apparent that it is the field of study
in which really deductive logical methods are used with most effect. Mathematics
makes more use of deductive logical methods than any other science. Exponents of
a Whitehead and Russell (1925–1927).

the traditional logic however confined themselves to the examination of the logic
of everyday discourse and were thus divorced from logical practice and unable to
understand the character of deductive systems by which a vast superstructure is built
upon a few initial postulates.
2. The traditional logic showed little capacity for development and expansion
while the new logic derived from the rich source of mathematics, has developed and
expanded with great rapidity. |

3. Modern logic realizes the significance and importance of the paradoxes, which
the traditional logic failed to do. Epimenides’ paradox for example is not even
formulated within Aristotelian formalism. It was soon realized that the concept of
classes, which was employed in the interpretation of the Boolean Algebra, led to the
same paradoxes as those which involved the concept of predicate.
Modern logic unlike the old logic has set itself the task of eliminating the paradoxes,
realizing that until this is done there can be no adequate system of deductive logic. If
in a system there is a contradiction then in that system one can prove any sentence
whatsoever (and therefore its negation), and from contradictory premises follows any
statement whatever and its negative. A deductive system which did not both permit
something and exclude something else would be useless.

Thus modern logic is distinguished from the traditional logic by its contact with
mathematics, its richness of material, its capacity to develop, and by the serious
consideration which it gives to the paradoxes. These rather than the superficial char-
acteristic of using a symbolism resembling that of mathematics are the fundamental
features of the new logic.
b In the following paragraph the principle of ex contradictione quodlibet sequitur (that from 𝑝and
its negation 𝑝follows any proposition 𝑞) is demonstrated using a form of disjunctive syllogism
(rule (a)) and disjunction introduction (rule (b)). The rules are given in semi-symbolic and symbolic
notation. We have deleted some duplications, corrected typographical errors, and have rendered
the proof (with some simplifications) in symbolic instead of semi-symbolic notation to improve
readability.

Logic like all studies investigates certain types of objects. These objects are
linguistic, consisting of statements which are often premises or conclusions. Logic is
mainly concerned with the analysis of the relationships existing between premises
and conclusions so that its task may be stated broadly as the investigation of the
conditions of inference.
In order to refer to objects we commonly use names. Now in other subjects of
investigation people are not likely to use the thing itself in place of its name. Thus
the botanist though he may use actual plants as illustrations is never likely to insert a
specimen in place of the name of a plant when he is writing about his subject. The
logician however who has groups of words for his object of study is often tempted

350
Karl R. Popper
to put down the words themselves instead of the name for them. The easiest way
to make the distinction between words as ordinarily used and words as names in a
statement about linguistic entities is by the use of inverted commas. Here are two
sentences for logical comparison:
“Tom is dark. Mary is fair.” Now when we write about these sentences we must
show that we are referring to these sentences and not to the situations represented
by the sentences. Thus we should write: “Tom is dark” is compatible with “Mary is
fair.” If the inverted commas were omitted then it would not be apparent that we were
referring to the sentences themselves.
This is a mistake that is frequently made in logical textbooks and one that is liable
to lead to serious confusion.
—
Our consideration of logic as concerned with the kind of relationships which hold
between linguistic expressions is valid whether we prefer to talk about thoughts,
judgements, propositions, statements or sentences because for logical analysis these
must be linguistically expressed.
We cannot pass logical judgements on a man’s thoughts or actions until he or
someone else expresses them in sentences or some such linguistic form. Indeed
logical relationships as such only occur between linguistic forms and not between the
objects represented by those forms. For example “𝐴follows from 𝐵” is a statement
about |
5
statements made with the help of the name 𝐴and the name 𝐵.
𝐴may stand for the statement “Auckland is to the north of Wellington and
Wellington is to the north of Christchurch” and 𝐵may stand for the statement, that,
“Auckland is to the north of Christchurch”. We cannot say that the fact that Auckland
is to the north of Christchurch follows from the fact that Auckland is to the north of
Wellington and Wellington is to the north of Christchurch. It is only of the statements
that we can say that one follows from the other. The relationship “follows from” may
be based on some relationship between the facts referred to by the statements, but if
it says something about these facts it is only in a secondhand way.
That logical relationships differ from factual relationships is clearly seen from the
logical relationship of contradiction. “Jones is six feet tall” contradicts “Jones is less
than six feet tall” but it is only the statements which contradict each other; there ⟨do⟩
not exist two lots of fact about Jones in contradiction with each other. Although the
contradiction of statements may correspond to the exclusiveness of facts we have to
recognize that logic is concerned with one and not directly with the other.
In this connection it is important for us to make clear the distinction between
compound statements and meta statements. Both contain statements within statements
but in a different way. Thus “Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall and Humpty Dumpty
had a great fall” is a compound statement about fact containing two distinct factual
statements. On the other hand the sentence “‘Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall’ is
compatible with the statement ‘Humpty Dumpty had a great fall’” while it contains
the same sentences (but in inverted commas) treats them in an entirely different way.
In the meta statement it is the sentences as such which are referred to and not the facts
they express. In the first case the words in the two sentences are used as statements of

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
351
fact while in the second case, when put into inverted commas, they are the names of
these statements.
On this basis we may distinguish between an object and a meta language. The
object language is (usually) the language of everyday discourse or the language of
the sciences, and it is the object of our interest – that which we are going to analyse.
But to refer to it we must use a language and this we call the meta language. |

About
the meta language we need not talk at all, we just talk in it. The two may coincide
(e.g. they may be English) but they may not. In one context only one language should
be used; there should be no mixture. This does not mean that we cannot refer to the
other language but when we do so we must use some such device as inverted commas
or preface it by the phrase “the statement which says that,” thus in effect translating it
into the meta language, just as we do for example when referring to a French word in
the English language, e.g. the French word “garçon” has the same meaning as the
English word “boy”.
In “Principia Mathematica”c Russell has not kept strictly to the meta language.
His formula 𝑝⊃𝑞does not express the logical relationship of deducibility i.e. 𝑝⊃𝑞
is not equivalent to 𝑞follows from 𝑝, instead its equivalent is 𝑝∨𝑞.
The following are important meta-linguistic terms referring to relationships which
hold between statements:
“𝐴contradicts 𝐵”
“𝐴and 𝐵are compatible”
“𝐴follows from 𝐵”
“𝐴is analytic”
“𝐴is synthetic”
“𝐴is self-contradictory”
“𝐴is consistent”
“𝐴is true”
“𝐴is a generalization of 𝐵”
“𝐴is a negation of 𝐵”
7
Note on the Concept of TRUTH
(a) If truth is a property of certain statements and implies a relationship to facts then
the meta language must not be confined to speaking only or exclusively about
linguistic objects otherwise the concept of truth could not occur within the meta
language.
(b) The definition truth means correspondence between the sentence and the fact
does not cover analytical true sentences. However, the definition can be extended
in such a way that this difficulty disappears.
(A propositional function is a sentence which contains variables. Names which
can be substituted for these variables are said to satisfy the propositional function
c Whitehead and Russell (1925–1927).

352
Karl R. Popper
while the fact or object represented by the name is said to fulfil the propositional
function. A proposition may be regarded as a propositional function with no variables
in which case it may be regarded as being fulfilled by the null class of facts).
We can extend our definition by saying that a true proposition or statement is one
which is fulfilled by certain facts. Analytic statements would then be propositions
that were fulfilled by any facts whatever.
Remarks about Truth
A technical question: property and class.
Truth is a property or a class. In saying a sentence is true we are saying that it has
a certain property or belongs to a class of sentences. We are thus talking about a
sentence and therefore statements about truth belong to the meta language.
If “𝐴”, “𝐵”, “𝐶” are names of sentences then I can write symbolically “𝐴∈Tr”
(“𝐴is true”) where “∈” means “is an element of”, and “Tr” is the name of the class
of true sentences.
Note: A sentence of the form “Socrates ∈man” must always be constructed so that
on the left of the symbol “∈” there is a name of an element and on the right there is a
name of a class.
|
8
Therefore, if I am stating that a certain proposition belongs to a certain class (or
has a certain property) then I can express this only in a statement where the name
of a proposition occurs (e.g. on the left) the⟨n⟩some symbol which symbolizes the
individual class relationship and then (e.g. on the right) the name of a class.
For the proposition itself is the element of the class not what is named by it.
—
If we have the concept of truth at our disposal in the meta language then we can
define with the help of this concept most of the logical constants of our language –
words like these: “and”, “are”, “is”, “if”, “or”, “some”.
Logical constants of the Aristotelian syllogism e.g. such words as “all”, “some”
and the copula. We distinguish between logical constants and descriptive constants
like “table”, “chair”, “Socrates”, and between variables (which themselves can be
either logical or descriptive; usually variables representing descriptive constants are
employed.)
Definition of “and” (as used between sentences) with the help of the concept of truth.
A sentence of the form “𝑝and 𝑞” or symbolically “𝑝. 𝑞”, where “𝑝” and “𝑞” may
be replaced by any sentence of the language under consideration, is true if and only if
both of the constituent sentences (represented by “𝑝” and “𝑞” are true).
Definition of “or” “𝑝or 𝑞” (symbolically “𝑝∨𝑞”) is true if and only if at least one
of its constituents is true.

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
353
To define Conjunction and Disjunction
A Conjunction is a sentence composed of two sentences in such a way that the whole
sentence is true if and only if both of its constituents are true.
A Disjunction is a sentence composed of two sentences in such a way that the
whole sentence is true if at least one of its constituents is true.
The words “conjunction” and “disjunction” obviously are terms of the meta
language on the same level as “true”.
The words “and” and “or” or “.” and “∨” are words of |
10
the object language, they do
not themselves describe anything, they only express a certain way of composition of
sentences. Which way can be expressed in meta language with the help of constants.

Thus they show us in what way we have to make use of the meta language in
constructing or analysing an object language.
—
The class of formally true or analytical sentences will be named by the symbol
“An”. Thus “The sentence 𝐴is analytic” can be symbolized by “𝐴∈An”. Now we
have in the meta language a theorem An ⊂Tr (⊂subclass relation). If a sentence
“𝐴” follows from a sentence “𝐵” then the sentence which is the implication with the
antecedent 𝐵and the consequent 𝐴must be analytic and vice versa.
Thus if “𝑝” and “𝑞” represent sentences of the object language, the sentence of
the meta language “‘𝑝> 𝑞’∈An” expresses that the second of these sentences of the
object language i.e. a sentence “𝑞”, follows from the first “𝑝”.
Examples showing the relationships set out in the truth table:
Conjunction “𝑝. 𝑞” e.g. Tom is dark and Mary is fair. Unless it is true that both,
“Tom is dark” and “Mary is fair” the statement as a whole is a false one.
Disjunction “𝑝∨𝑞” e.g. Jones has a horse or Jones has a car. This sentence may be
true as a whole if ⟨one or both sentences are true.⟩d
d The sentence ends abruptly in the typescript.

Criticism of W. E. Johnson
Johnsone distinguishes between primary and secondary propositions. He says that
there may even be tertiary propositions. He defines “a secondary proposition is one
which predicates some character of a primary proposition”f.
Examining this definition we see that if a secondary proposition predicates some
character of a primary proposition then it must refer to the primary proposition with
the help of some sort of description or name. For, if a certain statement, whether
it is secondary or primary, some character of some object, then it must refer to the
object with the help of a name; e.g. ⟨if⟩I want to predicate of my fountain pen
some characteristic – for instance that it is black – then I have to use a sentence or
proposition like “My fountain pen is black”.
If we look at this proposition then we see that neither my fountain pen nor the
characteristic in question occurs in it, but words or names referring to my fountain
pen and to the characteristic. Namely, the names “fountain pen” and “black”.
In the same way if a secondary proposition predicates something of a primary
proposition then the primary proposition cannot occur itself in it but a name of it
must occur in the secondary proposition.
Johnson writes “taking 𝑝to stand for any proposition we may construct such
secondary propositions as: 𝑝is true, 𝑝is false, 𝑝is certainly true, . . ..”
Let us criticise this sentence of Johnson’s. In saying “taking 𝑝to stand for any
proposition” he is indicating that he is using the letter “𝑝” not as a name (variable
name) referring to, but as a symbol standing for, or representing some proposition
itself, but in that case we cannot say that “𝑝is true” is a correct example of a secondary
proposition. It is not correct to say “It is now raining is true” but rather “‘It is now
raining’ is true” or even clearer “The proposition ‘It is now raining’ is true”.
12
The Consequence Relation and Analytic Implication
In what follows we will make use of the following symbols: “𝑝”, “𝑞” and “𝑟” represent
certain statements like “It is raining” (they represent not they denote or they name i.e.
“𝑝” is not used as a name for e.g. “It is raining” but the letter “𝑝” is used instead of
some series of letters like “It is raining”). We say “𝑝” is a variable representing or
standing for sentences.
We use symbols like “𝐴”, “𝐵”, “𝐶” as names of sentences and we use symbols
like “𝑃”, “𝑄”, “𝑅” as variables representing or standing for not sentences but names
of sentences.
We want to express that a certain sentence 𝐵follows from another sentence, say 𝐴.
Every statement like “𝐵follows from 𝐴” or “from 𝐴follows 𝐵” must be a sentence
e William Ernest Johnson (1858–1931), British philosopher and logician who wrote the three-volume
Logic (1921–24).
f The quote is from Johnson (1921, p. 50)

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
355
of the meta language because this sentence states that a relationship between two
propositions holds (similar to a sentence which states a property, say truth, of a
proposition or say that a proposition is analytic.)
Now we want to show that if the proposition named by “𝐴” is, for instance, “It
is raining now” and the proposition named by “𝐵” is, for instance, “It is sometimes
raining” then instead of saying “From 𝐴follows 𝐵” we can say “‘It is raining now
implies it is sometimes raining’ is analytic”. Now, instead of writing “It is raining” we
will write “𝑎” and instead of writing “It sometimes rains” we will write “𝑏” (i.e. the
small letters “𝑎”, “𝑏” and “𝑐” shall represent constant propositions – certain givens
i.e. they shall be just shortenings of these propositions).
Now what we want to show is: the sentences
“From 𝐴follows 𝐵”
and
“‘𝑎> 𝑏’ ∈An”
express the same thing.
It has to be noted that both these sentences are sentences of the meta language
the one making use of the relationship “follows” the other of the predicate “analytic”
which are both in terms of the meta language.
We can use a third way to express it: if we introduce the name “𝐴→𝐵” as a name
for the proposition “𝑎> 𝑏” then we can write “𝐴→𝐵∈An”. In other words, we
maintain that if implication of the object language is analytic i.e. is formally true
then the |
13
two components of this implication stand in such a relation that the second
follows from the first.
If an implication of the object language is not analytic i.e. not formally true but
for instance true (not formally) or false (either formally or not formally) then the
second of the components does not follow from the first. In other words, the symbol
of implication (“>” or “If . . . then”) does not express the relationship of deducibility
or consequence, it cannot because it is the symbol of the object language.
To show that the two sentences
“From 𝐴follows 𝐵”
and
“𝐴→𝐵∈An”
express the same thing. We have seen in the lecture notesg that there are two
characteristics of the consequence relation
(1) Transmission of truth
(2) This transmission must be based on the formal structure of the sentence involved.
We may apply this to the sentence “From 𝐴follows 𝐵”. This is a sentence in the
meta language expressing the fact that sentence 𝐵is deducible from sentence 𝐴(i.e.
the truth of 𝐴guarantees the truth of 𝐵). This inference is formal because even if
𝐴and 𝐵were both false the inference would not be rendered invalid, and also the
inference is made solely from an examination of the structure of the sentences 𝐴
and 𝐵.
We may express these two requirements of a valid inference of the form “𝐴follows
from 𝐵” by using “𝐴→𝐵” to indicate the relationship of sentence 𝐴guaranteeing
the truth of sentence 𝐵. And we may indicate the formal nature of this inference
g Cf. this volume, Chapter 19, § IV.

356
Karl R. Popper
relation by stating that this statement belongs to the class of analytical statements.
“From 𝐴follows 𝐵” would then be fully expressed by the statement “𝐴→𝐵∈An”.
14
Remarks on the Theory of Deducibility
What we have already said serves only to make clear in what way to speak about
deducibility.
Now we will proceed to questions like – under what conditions is a certain sentence
of the object language, say 𝑄, deducible from another sentence of the object language,
say 𝑃. The rules which answer this question can be called Rules of Inference:
1. (The Principle of Inference) 𝑄is deducible from 𝑃, if 𝑃is a conjunction, the one
component of which is some proposition, say 𝑅, whilst the other component of the
conjunction consists of an implication with the implicant 𝑅and the implicate 𝑄.
In symbols:
𝑄is deducible from 𝑃if 𝑃has the form “𝑅& (𝑅→𝑄)” or “(𝑅→𝑄) & 𝑅”.
Where we use the symbol & in order to form the name of a conjunctino as we have
done with the symbol “→” in order to form the name of an implication. Therefore
we can say
𝑅
𝑅→𝑄
∴𝑄
or
𝑅& (𝑅→𝑄)
∴𝑄
That shall be used as some symbolism belonging to the meta language and
expressing the principle of inference.

The Concept of Truth
Ramsey and Johnson maintain that the Concept of Truth is redundant. We do not
agree with this, but fully agree with the evidence they offer for their opinion. They
have misinterpreted their own evidence. What is this evidence? Both emphasize that
the statement “It is true that it rains” conveys exactly as much, not more or less than
the statement “It rains”.
From our standpoint truth is a property of a statement and Johnson and Ramsay’s
evidence can be termed a criterion for the right and correct definition of this property
– namely:
We can say that the word “truth” or rather the predicate “Tr” is properly defined
if it will always be that “𝑋∈Tr” is analytically equivalent with the proposition
named by 𝑋(and expressed in the meta language). For instance if English is the
meta language and German the object language, and if the English translation of the
German sentence “Es regnet” is “It rains” then the following sentence (of the meta
language)
“Es regnet ∈Tr” or
“The German sentence which consists of the two words ‘es’ and ‘regnet’ is true”
must be analytically equivalent with the following sentence of the meta language, “It
rains”. This can be shortly expressed in the following way: 𝑋∈Tr ≡𝑆
Where 𝑋is the metalinguistic name of some sentence of the object language, and
where 𝑆is the meta linguistic translation of that sentence.
Now, in case the object language and meta language coincide or rather where
the object language is a certain part of the meta language (for instance where the
object language is the part of English which is not covered by linguistic or logical
entities) “𝑋” would be a name of a sentence of the object language and 𝑆would be
simply that sentence itself (which would in this connection i.e. in a metalinguistic
connection belong to the meta language) e.g. “‘It rains’ is true” must be equivalent
with “It rains”.
Tarski said that the criterion for a correct definition of truth was that from a
correct definition of truth all statements of the described form “𝑋∈Tr ≡𝑆” must be
deducible.
|
17
We must distinguish between the criterion for a definition and the definition itself.
When we are required to give a definition we must know what precisely is the task
which has been set for us. The demand for a definition of say, time or truth remains
utterly vague if there is not given
(a) a clear indication as to the terms admissible as definitions
(b) a criterion with the help of which we can decide whether or not the task to define
“truth” or “time” is successfully carried out.
Tarski succeeded in giving such a criterion, having done so it was comparatively
easy to do the task set. These considerations lead to a more general statement of
procedure, namely, do not try to solve a problem before you have stated it. The
difficulty presented by many philosophical problems is very often due to the fact that
the problem has not been stated in a clear and precise fashion. Often we become
aware of problems in a vague way without being able to give a precise account of

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
359
what is involved. Until the problem is correctly formulated there can be no hope of
solving it.
The Logic of Thought and the Logic of Linguistic Form
We may contrast two opposing attitudes towards the study of logic. W. E. Johnson
in his “Logic”i defines his subject as follows: “Logic is most comprehensively and
least controversially defined as the analysis and criticism of thought”, and again he
says, “Adopting as we do the general view that no logical treatment is finally sound
which does not take account of the mental attitude in thought, it follows that the
fundamental terms ‘true’ and ‘false’ can only derive their meaning from the point of
view of criticising a certain possible mental attitude.”
The opposing point of view is represented by R. Carnap in his “Logical Syntax
of Language” where he says, “The development of logic during the past ten years
has shown clearly that it can only be studied with any degree of accuracy when it is
based, not on judgments (thoughts, or the contents of thoughts) but rather on linguistic
expressions, of which sentences are the most important because only for them is it
possible to lay down sharply defined rules”j.
|
18
Of these two methods the latter has been by far the more useful and fruitful for
the study of logic, but it may be that it is not so far from achieving the aims of the
former method as it may appear.
The study of the purely linguistic form of sentences may reveal some very important
facts about “thoughts” and “Judgments” which would not have been discovered by the
direct method of treating logic as concerned with mental attitudes. To use a metaphor.
The economist who stays at home and makes a comprehensive study of the statistics
concerning the economic condition of a certain remote country may have a far better
conception of the conditions prevailing in that country than a person who has been
there and relied merely on his own observations. The indirect method may be the
more fruitful one.

Logic has been regarded from various points of view as being the study of
judgments, thoughts, propositions or sentences.
The most extreme views are held by those who on the one side regard logic as the
study of thoughts, and by those on the other side who regard logic as the study of
sentences.
On the one hand thought need not be formulated at all and on the other hand the
sentence may be regarded as just a series of symbols, like black marks on white paper,
or else a collection of sounds.
Those who emphasise the fact that they are only interested in a logic of meaningful
sentences and who identify this with a logic of thoughts we may call psychologists
(logical psychologism).

Karl R. Popper
The opposing wing who emphasise their interest in black marks on white paper
we may call the logical formalists.
Now between the extremes of logic as a study of unformulated thought and logic
as a study of sentences there are many intermediate stages, like the one expressed in
the definition, “A judgement is a linguistically formulated thought.”
Before we proceed to a logical analysis of the matter we will first give some
terminological analysis which although it is rather problematic, will help us to see
how the different times can be differentiated. This analysis goes back to that used by
the Stoics.
1. We can distinguish between three principle entitites involved in an ordinary
judgment as when someone says “It is raining.” There is an entity – a certain mental
act which we can call a mental attitude of assertion taking place in the head of this
person (to express it rather crudely).
The next entity is a certain part of the world or a certain spatial-temporal aggregate
in which there are falling drops of water i.e. in which it is raining. (We assume that
the judgement is true).
The third entity is a series of symbols which may be either spoken or written or
perhaps even only thought of namely, the |
20
symbols “It”, “is”, and “raining” which go
to make up the sentence “It is raining.”
Let us name these three entitites as follows:
(i) active assertion
(ii) objective basis
(iii) the sentence
In addition to these three there is a further entity namely the feature of the objective
basis which is designated by the sentence. This is not the whole objective basis itself.
We will call it the fact designated by the sentence. However, if we do not look at
it from the side of the objective basis, but from the side of the sentence, we could
say that it is what is meant by the sentence, or that it is the objective content of the
sentence.
|
21
The logicians who maintain that they are only interested in the meaning, or what
is meant by sentences, or in the content of the sentence have never succeeded either
in:
(a) saying what they mean by this, i.e. in saying how to distinguish this content from
(i) the asserting act
(ii) the sentence
(iii) the objective basis
i.e. some of them emphasized that the content is not the psychological attitude
but rather its object, and all of them emphasized that it is not the sentence.
(b) or in showing the significance of their emphasis i.e. in showing what difference
it does make to logical theory or (especially) in showing its advantage for logical
theory. It is clear that only in contrasting their results with the results of a purely
formal analysis, could the significance of their emphasis be shown. This has
never been done because of the universal agreement of the insignificance of the
verbal formal investigations.

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
361
Dr. Popper’s view is that hardly any progress has been made since the Stoics to
analyse the meaning of meaning (c.f. Ogden and Richards quotation of Gomperzk)
and especially (b) (see above) was entirely overlooked. Dr. Popper maintains further
that the purely formal analysis has opened the way for deeper penetration into all
logical problems – especially is this the case with the theory of meta logic.
The development of this theory which is based upon the formal analysis of sentences
has exposed many simple though serious confusions which may arise in treating
logic as a study of thoughts. Of these we have already noted the confusion of the
proposition with its name, and the mistaken conclusion that the concept of truth
is redundant. Thus, the formal treatment of logic has cleared up issues which the
treatment of logic as thought clouded over.
|
22
2. Most logicians (until recently) have assumed that a sentence consists of black
marks on white paper or something of that sort – and that is all. Its meaning or content
or anything of that kind must be found in something outside – something mental (or
factual) for instance.
They did not see that apart from the factors mentioned, a language is more than a
mass of symbols – that it involves a certain system of rules which declare how to use
such symbols. These rules may in part be non formal, like for instance the rules for
using the different descriptive terms of a language or the rules of the use of words
like “rain” or “apple”, and so on. Anyone learning a language discovers such rules by
finding out in what kind of situation he has to use the words “rain” or “apple”.
These rules refer to certain situations of a practical kind, that is, they refer to
something outside of the language and correspond therefore to the old idea of meaning
as referring to something outside the sentence.
But the formal analysis has shown that the problem of the meaning of the descriptive
constants is of comparatively small significance compared with the problem of the
meaning of such words (constants) like “is” (“is an element of”, “has the property”,
“is a part of”, “is a sub-class of”), “and”, “if . . . then”.
The meaning of such words is of the greatest importance – their analysis shows
that loosely speaking they make a language to be a language, and their analysis shows
that the meaning of such words can be found by analysing their rules of use which
turn out to be entirely formal rules i.e. rules which have only to do with the handling
of symbols and which do not refer in any way to something outside of the language.
These rules are of the following type: “. . . ∈. . .” forms a sentence if on the left of “∈”
and on the right of “∈” there are two different kinds of symbols; thus: If “Socrates ∈
man” is a sentence, “man ∈Socrates” cannot be a sentence.
|
23
The problem of meaning can be approached by two radically different methods.
The traditional approach is by way of psychology, that is by relating the word or
sentence to someone’s field of experience, placing it in its psychological background.
The opposing method is to treat it in a purely formal linguistic manner; the meaning
of a word or sentence being the place it occupies in a linguistic context and the purely
formal rules which govern its use in that context.
Carnap asserts that the whole problem of meaning can be solved by the second
k Cf. Ogden and Richards (1923).

362
Karl R. Popper
method. Dr. Popper thinks that this is going further than the evidence warrants but
that nevertheless the purely formal analysis does go a long way towards solving the
problem. He thinks that it has been justified by its results and that it has certainly
been a more successful approach than the psychological one.
Tarski, who also developed the formal side upon which Carnap places such
emphasis was particularly concerned with showing the relations between the purely
formal structure and the context of a sentence. While Carnap developed a language
which deals only with matters of syntax, Tarski developed a language capable of
referring to the object as well as to meta linguistic entities. Thus his language is able
to show the connection between the two. Tarski divides the subject of meta-logic into
two parts:
1. The part dealing with the purely formal structure of language, and
2. The portion which treats of the relation between this formal structure and the
context of the sentence. This he calls semantic.

One may distinguish between a more radical and a less radical attitude towards
the role of logical analysis and the nature of philosophical problems.
Wittgenstein first took the standpoint that philosophical problems were nothing
but linguistic confusions and that when these were analysed the problems were not
solved but just disappeared. Wittgenstein thought that philosophical problems were of
the following type. Instead of saying that one’s watch was going and has now stopped
one might say that the “go” of the watch had gone and might then proceed to ask,
“where has the ‘go’ gone?” This example would be analogous for instance, with the
philosophical problem of mind and body.
This radical attitude was also the one adopted by Carnap in his “Logical Syntax of
Language”l. He said that all the problems of philosophy could be reduced to those of
syntax, that is to questions concerning the rules of the use of language – problems
which could not be solved in these terms were mere linguistic confusions. Thus all
that remained of philosophy was the study of the formal structure of sentences.
Dr. Popper adopts a less radical attitude. He thinks that while the purely formal
study of the structure of language is undoubtedly of great importance and clears up
many philosphical difficulties yet residual problems may remain which are not purely
a matter of linguistic structure. This attitude was confirmed by the work of Tarski who
showed that the problem of truth could only be dealt with satisfactorily by getting
beyond the formal structure of the sentence to its relations with the object.
One of the main tasks of analysis is to reformulate the problems of philosophy. This
may be done partly by the use of more accurate terminology. For example, for the term
“knowledge” should be substituted “scientific statements”, for “sources of knowledge”
should be substituted “method of testing scientific statements”, for Kant’s “limits of
knowledge” should be substituted “characterisation of the method of science.” Such
a change of terminology is necessary when discussing the philosophy |
25
of science
for the term knowledge implies “truth”. We cannot, strictly speaking, use the phrase
l Carnap (1937).

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
363
“scientific knowledge” for if you find that what you professed to know was incorrect
then you cannot say that you had knowledge at all. Since no scientific statements can
be conclusively proved it is misleading to talk about scientific knowledge.
The Viennese Circle has been concerned with the following main problems:
1. The Nature of Philosophy
2. The Nature of Logic and Mathematics
3. The Nature of Science – especially its empirical basis which involves the problem
of induction
4. The Nature of Language
5. The special problem, traditionally known as the body-mind problem, formulated
in the typical form of “Is psychology dealing with something different from
physics”.
—

26
In 1931–32 Carnap, influenced by Neurath, developed a standpoint which he
called “Physicalism” (from Neurath’s side the intention was to develop something like
a modernised materialism, that is connected with the fact that Neurath was interested
in Marxism though not an orthodox Marxist).
The philosophical idea was the following: Behaviourism is methodologically
correct i.e. a psychological statement can only be tested with the help of observation
of the behaviour in the widest sense of the word. Even the so-called introspective
method can be said to be based on observation of the behaviour, because its results
must be formulated with the help of sentences, but these are communications i.e.
bound up with behaviour such as mouth movements or movements of the hand in
writing and so on. The only empirical methods available in psychology are observing
what a man does or what a man says and writes.
Carnap expressed this in the following way: All terms of psychology are physical
terms or rather must be capable of being reformulated within the language of physics.
If I say “Mr. A is excited” then I refer to certain typical reactions.
A statement of that kind is fundamentally not different from a statement like,
“Mr. A is ill” or “Mr. A has a broken leg” (the last is obviously a sentence of a
physical kind). The thesis of Physicalism is therefore the following: Every scientific
theory, if scientific must be able to be formulated in the language of physics. This
last formulation indicates already a certain connection with what Dr. Popper calls
the Kantian problem – namely the characterisation of science and its limits towards
metaphysics; i.e. an attempt to characterise the empirical feature of science. This
is here identified with being able of formulation in physical terms. Because all our
empirical observations are of temporal and spatial happenings.
|
27
Wittgenstein attacks metaphysics from the point of view of the verification of
sentences. A sentence is only verifiable when it is possible to analyse it into its
constituent atomic propositions. By atomic proposition he means given sense data
as expressed by such propositions as “The grass is green”, “Water is wet” and so
on. These atomic propositions or given sense data may be verified immediately by
empirical observation. Any sentence therefore which cannot be reduced to these

364
Karl R. Popper
immediately verifiable atomic propositions cannot itself be verified and hence is
meaningless. Such sentences are typically those of metaphysics.
Dr. Popper criticises this standpoint from certain aspects. It is psychologically
wrong – there are no givens, what we have is always an interpretation – we can either
take it as a basis for further interpretation or else analyse it into its components – but
however far we analyse we never get beyond an interpretation. Wittgenstein has just
reproduced in the dialect of the Viennese Circle the older positivist view namely, that
the mind contains ultimate sense data to which science must reduce all knowledge.
Wittgenstein’s view has affinities with the Kantian view of the empirically given
upon which, according to Kant, the mind worked to produce scientific theories – the
empirically given was not itself sufficient for science, it had to be combined with the
a priori forms of the mind. Wittgenstein’s theory has the further consequence that the
generalizations of science must also be classed with the sentences of metaphysics,
as meaningless. For they cannot be completely reduced to their constituent atomic
propositions and therefore they are not verifiable. This question of verification is
bound up with the problem of induction.
We may formulate this problem by indicating the apparent contradiction involved
between the following statements:
1. Hume’s analysis proved that induction cannot be based on a pure observational
basis.
2. The fundamental thesis of every empiricist is that only observation and experiment
are decisive authorities about all kinds of scientific sentences.
3. The fact that science consists mainly of strictly universal sentences or theories.
|
28
1 and 3 apparently contradict 2, and this represents Kant’s view. He held that
there must be a non-empirical basis for scientific theories. 2 and 3 contradict ⟨1⟩and
represent the view of Bacon and Mill (who ignored Hume’s criticism of induction).
1 and 2 contradict 3, and this is the consequence of Wittgenstein’s view.
These contradictions howeverare only apparent. There wouldbe a realcontradiction
if in 2 instead of saying that observation and experiment are decisive authorities, we
said that they were a complete verification of scientific sentences.
All three standpoints, however, are correct, for although only experience decides
about scientific theories there is no conclusive positive decision.
By experiment and observation we test theories i.e. we attempt to show that they
are false, but we can never succeed in conclusively verifying them.

In any deductive inference there is no transmission of truth from the conclusion
to the premises. But does not this depend upon the precision and completeness with
which the conclusion is stated? In the following argument for example,
Prussic acid is a deadly poison
𝐴took a dose of Prussic acid
therefore 𝐴is dead
we cannot argue from the statement “𝐴is dead” to the statement “Prussic acid is a
deadly poison,” or to the statement “𝐴took a dose of Prussic acid”, for it might be

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
365
the case that he died a natural death, or was shot or stabbed. We have not, however,
stated the conclusion precisely enough. If we said
Prussic acid is a deadly poison which acts in such
and such a way
𝐴took a dose of Prussic acid
therefore 𝐴died such and such a death,
we could argue from the conclusion, “𝐴died such and such a death” to the premise
“𝐴took a dose of Prussic acid”, with the help of the generalization “Prussic acid is a
deadly poison which acts in such and such a way”.
Our first conclusion above was “weak”, we could not use it in arguing back to the
truth of one of the premises, but our second more complete conclusion was “strong”
since with the help of a generalization we could do this. Sometimes the conclusion is
more than strong, in which case it is in itself sufficient to demonstrate the truth of its
premise. In such a case we have two sentences which are mutually deducible – they
are said to be equipollent i.e. when 𝐴> 𝐵, and 𝐵> 𝐴then 𝐴≡𝐵. When it is the
case, however, that from a generalization and certain initial conditions we deduce
certain consequences which can be expressed as observational sentences or basic
propositions, then if the conclusion is true we are unable to deduce from it the truth
of the generalization: if it is false, however, we may conclude that the generalization
is false. In this connection we may note that there is a symmetry between the pure
universal and the pure existential sentence and there is a |
30
symmetry between each of
them and a singular or observational sentence. The universal and existential sentences
may contradict each other, while the existential sentence may be verified by the
observational sentence and the universal may be falsified by it.

2. Can a statement be conclusively falsified any more then it can be conclusively
verified? To falsify a theory we must show that it leads to a conclusion which can be

366
Karl R. Popper
contradicted by observational statements or basic propositions. But no such empirical
statements are beyond the possibility of error, therefore it cannot be shown that any
theory is certainly false any more than it can be shown that it is certainly true.
It is true that any statement of fact may be false and that therefore in the last analysis
we cannot be certain that we have falsified a theory any more than we can be certain
that we have verified it. But this is a ground for the uncertainty of falsification and
verification alike. We can see, however, that the verification of theories is impossible
even before we cast doubts upon the truth of our basic propositions (i.e. observational
sentences) and for an entirely different reason.
In any investigation or process of reasoning we must be in by taking something
as given – the empiricist regards it as safer and offering less possibility of error to
take basic propositions, or observational sentences, as given, in contrast |
31
with the
rationalist who assumes certain general laws.
On the empiricist basis we may examine the claims of verifiability and falsifiability.
As we have seen above a conclusion (or prediction) which consists solely of basic
propositions cannot transmit truth back to its premises. Thus verifiability fails to fulfil
the logical requirements necessary for making a deduction.
It might be argued that every basic proposition itself implies a theory, for if doubt
is expressed concerning it we proceed to test it on the grounds of some generalization
or theory. But this occurs on a different level of argument, we are no longer taking
our basic propositions as given but are treating them as objects for investigation. The
point is that before an argument can be developed we must take something as given,
although on another occasion, or at a later stage, we may cast doubt on, or inquire into
the truth and falsity of what we previously took as given. Thus, falsification while
sharing with verifiability the uncertainty of basic propositions does not, like the latter,
lack logical justification.
3. The problem of Inductionm
The problem of induction was raised by Hume when he showed that it was impossible
to make logically justifiable positive decisions concerning theories and hypotheses
like those formulated by science.
If we ask, why does science formulate theories and hypotheses? – then the answer
is that it does so in order to make predictions.
Then the main question arises – On what grounds does it prefer one theory or
hypothesis to another? While, as Hume showed, it cannot make conclusive positive
assertions about the truth of its hypotheses it can test them by trying to falsify them.
|
32
While it cannot arrive at positive conclusions about the truth of a theory – it can
come to negative conclusions to the effect that a theory is false since the predictions
based on it were not fulfilled.
m The number 3 probably refers to the corresponding list item on p. 25 of the typescript.

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
367
Thus a solution is given to the problem of induction by characterising the aims
and methods of scientific procedure.
The aim of science is to make predictions for which purpose it frames hypotheses –
it tests these hypotheses in the course of using them i.e. the very making of predictions
constitutes the testing of the hypotheses – if the predictions are untrue the hypotheses
are falsified.

Basic propositions are statements that some characteristic can be observed at
a particular time and place. We may call the particular spatial area indicated the
“surrounding”. Hence basic propositions predicate a characteristic of a particular
“surrounding”.
Universal propositions, on the other hand, do not assert that anything exists e.g. a
statement about “all 𝑋are 𝑌” is not falsified if in fact there are no 𝑋’s, but it is falsified
if in fact there exists one or more 𝑋’s that are not 𝑌’s. The universal proposition “All
𝑋’s are 𝑌’s” does not assert 𝑋but it does exclude from existence any 𝑋that is not 𝑌.
We may bring out the relationship between the various types of propositions by
using the following symbolism. ( ) is the universal operator, or generalisator so that
(𝑋)(𝑋∈swan ⊃𝑋∈white) is equivalent to “All swans are white” (𝑋is a variable
satisfied by “swan”)
(∃) is the existential operator, or particularisator, so that (∃𝑋)(𝑋∈swan . 𝑋∈
black) is equivalent to “There is at least one swan which is black”. Substituting the
propositional function 𝜑𝑋for (𝑋∈swan ⊃𝑋∈white)
(𝑋)(𝜑𝑋) ≡(∃𝑋)(𝜑𝑋)
i.e. the contradictory of the universal proposition is equivalent to an existential
proposition, and also
(∃𝑋)(𝜑𝑋) ≡(𝑋)(𝜑𝑋)
i.e. the contradictory of the existential proposition is equivalent to a universal
proposition. Substituting 𝜓for 𝜑such that 𝜓𝑋≡𝜑𝑋
(𝑋)(𝜓𝑋) ≡(∃𝑋)(𝜑𝑋)
then if “𝑎” is a particular surroundingn
𝜑𝑎→(∃𝑋)(𝜑𝑋) ←→(𝑋)(𝜓𝑋)
i.e. a basic proposition implies an existential proposition which is equivalent to the
contradictory of a universal proposition.
|
34
A basic proposition is concerned only with what can be observed at a certain time
and place, hence its contradictory may not be a basic proposition itself. While the
contradictory of the basic proposition “Here is an elephant,” namely the proposition,
n What is meant in the following is: 𝜑𝑎→(∃𝑋) (𝜑𝑋), and (∃𝑋) (𝜑𝑋) ≡(𝑋) (𝜓𝑋).

368
Karl R. Popper
“There is no elephant here” may be regarded as a basic proposition also, there are
occasions when inability to detect the presence of something is no guarantee of its
absence. Thus, while “There is a needle in this haystack” is a basic proposition, its
contradictory “There is no needle in this haystack” is not.
However, there is another and perhaps more important reason for stressing this fact
and that is that basic propositions should not be deducible from universal propositions.
We can arrive at basic propositions only by observation, or by deduction, from a
universal (general law) and another basic proposition (initial condition).
But the contradictories of some basic propositions follow from universals and
therefore these contradictions cannot be themselves basic propositions.

The Development of the Vienna Circle
The movement originated with the appointment to a Chair of Philosophy at Vienna of
men such as Mach and Boltzmann whose training had been in the physical sciences and
who were themselves eminent physicists. Their interests were naturally in the methods
of science rather than in metaphysical speculation. Schlick who was appointed to this
chair in 1922, also had training in the physical sciences and around him developed
the Vienna Circle.
Russell’s work in logic and the foundations of mathematics was introduced to
the circle by mathematicians at Vienna, and interest was also aroused by Russell’s
attempts to explain the concept of physics as logical constructions, and by his work
“Our Knowledge of the External World”o.
Up to this point the Viennese Circle had not developed positivist views, being more
inclined towards realism. They were not, however, very interested in such questions
o Russell (1914).

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
369
ofp They had already adopted an anti-metaphysical attitude and were inclined to
believe that many philosophical problems were due to confusion of words.
A new stage was reached with the appearance of Wittgenstein’s ⟨Tractatus⟩which
greatly influenced the circle. The conception of atomic propositions as statements
concerning given sense data, and the notion that any statement not reducible to these
elements was meaningless, introduced a positivist attitude, gave a definite ground for
the attack upon metaphysics and strengthened the influence of Russell’s logical work.
Then came Carnap who had been very much influenced by Russell. He wished to
give an account of the whole field of experience in terms of logical constructions.
This was termed logical solipsism by which he meant that each person’s conception
of the world was a logical construction of his own observations.
Carnap thought that he could show how such concepts were built up and give all
definitions in these terms with the help of only one non-logical relationship, namely
the relationship |
36
expressed by the sentence “This reminds me of that”q. From such a
relationship Carnap hoped to build up all his definitions. Thus the notion of before
and after could be defined by saying, that when 𝐴reminds me of 𝐵, then 𝐵is before
𝐴and 𝐴is after 𝐵.
Dr. Popper pointed out the fundamental defect of this system namely that if
everything that we were acquainted with is a logical construction out of our immediate
observations, then we could not make predictions or talk about the future in any way
since we had not observed and could not as yet have made a logical construction out
of it.
Since logical constructions could not be made prior to the event and could have no
reference to the future, it followed that there was no place for scientific laws within
this system and the activity of scientific investigation was left unaccounted for.

37
Criticism of Physicalism and the Unity of Science
Carnap and Neurath developed from Wittgenstein’s conception of atomic propositions,
the theses of “Physicalism” and the “Unity of Science”.
They said that statements with an empirical content such as those of science could
only be verified and thus rendered significant by the protocol statements which they
implied.
A protocol statement was the statement of the intermediate sense experience of
some particular person and as such it could only be verified by that person. Thus
while protocols are (according to this view) the ultimate source of verification yet
they are not intersubjective, for each person’s protocols are private to himself.
Therefore, said Carnap, the protocols must be translated into a universal and
intersubjective language, i.e. a language in terms of which all states of affairs can be
p Sentence ends abruptly in the typescript.
q This theory is developed in Carnap (1928).

370
Karl R. Popper
expressed. “Such a language”, said Carnapr, “is the physical language which expresses
a quantitatively determined property of a definite position at a definite time.” This
introduces the notion of the Unity of Science, for although each science may have its
own terminology it must refer to certain physical determinations expressable in the
physical language, and the definition of all such terminology must be in relation to
these physical determinations.
There are two problems involved in the conception of Physicalism. One could say
that sentences like, “I have a toothache” i.e. “at this time, and at a particular spot in my
jaw there is a pain”, or for that matter one could say “I feel sad”, i.e. “somewhere in
the region defined by my body there is a certain feeling which occurs when I am aware
of certain situations.” There is no reason why we should not call the states indicated
by these sentences, physical determinations, and we might regard it as something in
common to all empirical observations, and all empirical sciences that they deal with
qualities or characteristics of a certain spatial-temporal region. Carnap, however, |
38
although he may have this in mind means something further. An observer cannot feel
my toothache or my sorrow, all that he observes about me when I tell him that “I have
a toothache” or “I am sad” are certain facial expressions and actions. These Carnap
regards as the physical determinations, and the statement of them as the sentences of
the physical language. Thus my statement “I have a toothache” and “I am sad” in the
physical language can only be translated as “I have such and such an expression on
my face”.
Now Carnap regards these latter sentences as translation of the former ones – that
is they are exactly equivalent. The sentence, “I have a toothache” ≡the sentence “I
have such and such an expression on my face.”
This view, however, is not correct. It may be that when I truthfully assert the
psychological sentence 𝐴, that what is asserted by the physical sentence 𝐵is also
always the case, and it may be in some cases (perhaps all) that what is asserted by
the physical statement is an essential part of the state of affairs referred to by the
psychological statement, but it is certainly not all that is meant, or referred to, by the
psychological statement, and it is not all that the observer understands by it; e.g. he
sympathises not about the aspect of my face but about what is going on in my tooth.
Furthermore, I may make psychological statements without being aware of what my
overt behaviour looks like, while the overt behaviour corresponding to two different
statements like “I have a toothache” and “I am sad” may be exactly the same.
Therefore, it seems false to speak of translation into the physical language, or to
imply that the physical language expresses precisely the same thing as is expressed,
say, in the language of psychology. It may express part of it, or it may express an
accompaniment, and it may be possible to infer from a statement of the physical
language a certain statement of the psychological language (usually with the aid of
some generalisation).
It is very important to note this criticism for Carnap makes use of this equivalence
of statements in the following way. Let us imagine that one statement in the material
|

mode. Then let us translate them into the physical language. In the physical language
they do not contradict each other, hence the equivalent statements in the material
mode of speech do not really contradict each other. But if the relationship between the
two languages is not one of equivalence then it will not be possible to solve problems
in this way.
The whole theory outlined and criticised above is typically an idealist approach to
such problems – the attempt is made to guarantee the truth of certain propositions by
equating the mind with its objects, in this case protocol sentences with sentences about
physical determinations, the former always containing a reference to the observer and
the latter being the common object of knowledge.
In criticism of this view Dr. Popper pointed out that the so-called protocol sentences
are exceedingly difficult to verify,and that science does not test its theories by reference
to statements like “I perceive so and so”, but by statements on predictions such as
“At a certain time and place there is so and so”, such sentences unlike the former
are not bound up with the experience of a particular person who is inaccessible to
other people. On the contrary anyone can proceed to test the statements of science
by proceeding to see if “so and so” is “there” at “a certain time”. Such simple
objective statements with which scientific theories are tested Dr. Popper calls “basic
propositions”.
Carnap acknowledged the validity of this criticism and having failed to provide
definitions by means of translations into the physical language and attempted to
provide definitions in another way e.g. Green could be defined as the property of the
class composed of grass, trees, and so on, naming all the particular green objects
with which one is acquainted. Dr. Popper pointed out that here the old problem of
induction appeared in that one could never be sure of having exhausted the total
enumeration of green objects – hence if one came across an object with which one
was not previously acquainted, say a piece of jade, then either it would not |
40
have the
property green since it did not belong to the class of enumerated objects or if one
granted that it was green then the previous definition of green must have been false.
Dr. Popper considers that definitions should be considered as an operation with
terms analogous to the deduction of sentences. The following table shows the points
of comparison between these two operations. |
41
Deduction of Sentences
Definition of Terms
1. All scientific theories are deductive sys-
tems
2. They start with certain sentences which
are just assumed.
They make use of certain terms, or con-
cepts, or ideas which are just assumed.
3. That is not deduced within the theory
That is not defined within the theory
4. We can call them axioms or postulates
or fundamental hypotheses
We can call them primitive ideas or
primitive concepts of the theory, or fun-
damental terms or universals

372
Karl R. Popper
5. From the axioms or postulates we can
deduce a certain body of theory
With the help of the primitive ideas we
can define a certain body of derived
terms
6. The deduction – every deduction starts
with one ore more axioms
Every definition starts with one or more
primitive terms
7. and it presents in such a way that a
series of sentences is constructed such
thatevery sentence ofthe series is either
an axiom or immediately deduced from
one of the foregoing sentences.
and it proceeds in such a way that a
series of terms is constructed such that
every term of the series is either a prim-
itive idea or immediately derived from
one of the foregoing terms.
Thus the procedure is based upon some
rules which describe certain transfor-
mations of sentences as permissible
thus defining what is meant by imme-
diately deducible from
Thus the procedure is based upon some
rules which describe certain substi-
tutions of terms as permissable, thus
defining what is meant by immediately
derivable from
8. Rules of deduction
Rules of definition
9. Positivism with regard to sentences: –
Criterion of verifiability
Positivism with regard to terms: – the
terms must be such that they can be
constituted.
Verification means deduction from rec-
ognized basic atomic propositions with
the help of some logical rules and ana-
lytical sentences
BUT
Constitution means definition with the
help of some terms, based on observa-
tion (basic or atomic terms) with the
help of certain logical rules and purely
logical terms
hypotheses cannot be verified only par-
ticulars can be
Universals cannot be constituted only
particular terms of proper names can
be.
Thus we can see that the problem is one of universal sentences and universals.

The Nature of Logic and Mathematics
In his works on Logic and the foundations of Mathematics Russell speaks of
mathematics as being a part of logic. Strictly, however, in addition to the rules of logic,
mathematics requires certain postulates which are not themselves logical. Russell, in
fact, uses three such postulates although perhaps only one, the axiom of infinity is
necessary.

20 The Origins of Modern Logic
373
We can applyallmathematicalsystems to nature althoughsome are more convenient
than others in this respect. Must we in the final analysis decide between various
mathematical and logical systems on empirical rather than formal grounds? The
evidence as yet is not conclusive but it appears as if we can make our preference on
purely formal considerations.
Axiom Systems
Descriptive terms can be replaced by, or interpreted as variables. A set of things
which fulfils this system is called a model of the system (cf. Carmichael, The Logic
of Discovery, Chapter concerning deductive systems)s. A system is called categorical
if any two models of it are isomorphic, that is if the relations between their terms have
the same structure (structural characteristics are symmetry, reflexiveness and so on).
An Axiom system can be said to define or determine its primitive terms in an
implicit manner so far as it determines the models in a certain way. It can never
characterize them entirely, and only in terms of a structure. Thus it cannot do more
in that direction than to determine the structure of the model completely, i.e. to be
categorical.
We have to distinguish from categoricalness another sort of perfectness, or com-
pleteness.
A system can be called complete if every sentence formulated in terms of the
system can be either deduced or refuted with the mere help of the axioms of the
system. Arithmetic is categorical but not complete in the second sense, as Gödel has
shown. (But it is complete in a third sense, namely it is |
43
possible to show in the meta
theory that every sentence of Arithmetic, even a “Gödel” sentence, is either true or
false and whether it is true or false – if the axioms of arithmetic are accepted as being
true.)
The possibility of characterising systems, not only as consistent or inconsistent
but also from the standpoint of their different degrees of completeness (in at least
three different senses or dimension) shows that there are certain possibilities formally
to distinguish between the merits of different concurring deductive systems.

Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
Abstract Paul Isaak Bernays (1888–1977) was a Swiss logician who worked on
the foundations of mathematics and set theory. (More biographical information can
be found in Lauener, 1978.) From 1919 until 1933, when his venia legendi was
revoked by the Nazi regime, he worked at the Mathematical Institute in Göttingen.
He subsequently returned to the ETH in Zürich, where he would stay for the rest
of his career. During this time he wrote Grundlagen der Mathematik I, II (Hilbert
and Bernays, 1934, 1939) together with David Hilbert. Popper owned a copy of both
volumes, which still exist with many of his own marginal notes in the Karl Popper
Collection Klagenfurt. Popper also frequently cites the Grundlagen in his articles on
logic. The letters reproduced here concern a meeting between Popper and Bernays
which took place in April 1947 in Switzerland. At that time, Popper and Bernays
pursued a joint publication on logic, a draft of which is reproduced in Chapter 14
of this volume. This joint work was never published, but these letters provide the
context that helps explain its genesis. The correspondence furthermore contains a
discussion of some of the criticisms raised by the reviewers of Popper’s articles.
Editorial notes: The letters are either from the the Karl Popper Collection Klagenfurt or from the
Paul Bernays estate, which is housed at the ETH Zürich. The rights to the letters of Paul Bernays
belong to Ludwig Bernays.

John Findlay’s Formulation of a Goedelian sentencea could be reconstructed like
this:
We first introduce the technical term “Quotation name” (of an expression) –
Anführungsname – der Name eines Ausdruckes der dadurch gebildet wird dass man
den Ausdruck in Anführungszeichen setzt. Dann schreiben wir:
We cannot demonstrate the statement obtained by substituting for the variable in
the statement-function “We cannot demonstrate the statement obtained by
substituting for the variable in the statement-function 𝑥the quotation name of this
statement-function” the quotation name of this statement-function.
Oder Deutsch:
Wir können den Satz nicht beweisen den man erhält |
2
wenn man für die Variable
in der Satzfunktion “Wir können den Satz nicht beweisen den man erhält wenn man
für die Variable in der Satzfunktion 𝑥den Anführungsnamen dieser Satzfunktion
einsetzt” den Anführungsnamen dieser Satzfunktion einsetzt.
Natürlich kann man auch den Lügner so formulieren (das scheint Findlay
entgangen zu sein):
Der Satz den man erhält wenn man für die Variable in der Satzfunktion “Der Satz
den man erhält wenn man für die Variable in der Satzfunktion 𝑥den
Anführungsnamen dieser Satzfunktion einsetzt, ist falsch” den Anführungsnamen
dieser Satzfunktion einsetzt, ist falsch.

We first introduce the technical term “Quotation name” (of an expression) –
Anführungsname – the name of an expression which is formed by putting the
expression in quotation marks. Then we write:
We cannot demonstrate the statement obtained by substituting for the variable in
the statement-function “We cannot demonstrate the statement obtained by
substituting for the variable in the statement-function 𝑥the quotation name of this
statement-function” the quotation name of this statement-function.
Or in German:
Wir können den Satz nicht beweisen den man erhält |
2
wenn man für die Variable
in der Satzfunktion “Wir können den Satz nicht beweisen den man erhält wenn man
für die Variable in der Satzfunktion 𝑥den Anführungsnamen dieser Satzfunktion
einsetzt” den Anführungsnamen dieser Satzfunktion einsetzt.
Of course one can also formulate the liar in this way (it seems that Findlay has
overlooked this):
The statement that one obtains by substituting for the variable in the
statement-function “The statement that one obtains by substituting for the variable in
the statement-function 𝑥the quotation name of that statement-function, is false” the
quotation name of that statement-function, is false.
Many thanks and warm regards,

Dear Professor Bernays,
Entschuldigen Sie den englischen Anfang – ich bin so gewohnt daran.
Sie erinnern sich wohl an unsere Diskussionen, und an Ihre freundliche (und für
mich überaus ehrenvolle) Anregung, eine kleine Arbeit über „Deducibility“
gemeinsam zu veröffentlichen. Ich habe inzwischen weiter gearbeitet, hauptsächlich

380
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
über „Derivation versus Demonstration (or Proof)“, und habe einige wirklich
interessante Ergebnisse erzielt: – ich glaube daß Sie, wenn Sie sie hören werden,
zugeben werden, daß die Unterscheidung doch recht wichtig ist. Aber diese
Untersuchung setzt die über Deducibility voraus. Ich habe daher in den letzten Tagen
an der Arbeit gearbeitet die wir (wenn Sie Ihren Vorschlag aufrecht erhalten)
gemeinsam herausgeben sollen; und ich hoffe, daß |
2
ich Sie Ihnen in einigen Tagen
zuschicken kann.
Ich komme anfang April wieder in die Schweiz. Zwischen dem 1. und 10. nehme
ich an einer Konferenz über politische Philosophie teile, würde Sie aber sehr gerne
unmittelbar nach dem 10. sehen. Sollte Ihnen das unmöglich sein so würde ich
versuchen, ein paar Tage früher zu reisen, um Sie zu sehen, aber das wäre mit
Schwierigkeiten verbunden. Würden Sie so lieb sein mir postwendend eine Zeile,
womöglich Luftpost, zu schicken, ob Sie am 11. und/oder 12. April frei sind? Es muß
nicht in Zürich sein.
Schönste Grüße,

Dear Professor Bernays,
Please excuse the English beginning – I am so used to it.
You probably remember our discussions, and your kind (and for me extremely
honouring) suggestion, to publish a small article on “Deducibility” together. I have
continued working, mainly on “Derivation versus Demonstration (or Proof)”, and
have obtained some really interesting results: – I believe that you will admit, when
you hear them, that the distinction is indeed quite important. But this enquiry
presupposes that which concerns Deducibility. I have therefore worked in the past
days on the article that we (if you uphold your suggestion) shall publish together; and
I hope that I can send it to you in a few days.
I will come to Switzerland again at the beginning of April. Between the 1st and
the 10th I participate in a conference on political philosophye, but I would really like
to see you immediately after the 10th. Should this be impossible for you, then I would
try to come some days earlier to see you, but this would be more difficult. Would you
be so kind to send me, by return of post, one line, possibly air mail, on whether you
are available on the 11th and/or 12th of April? It does not have to be in Zürich.
Warmest regards,
Yours,
K. R. Popper

Lieber Herr Professor,
Ich fahre morgen früh in die Schweiz, und ich habe die Absicht, diesen Brief in
der Schweiz aufzugeben; aber er ist in London geschrieben.
Hier ist der Artikel. Er hat mir ziemlich viel Arbeit gegeben; und, größtenteils,
nicht besonders interessante Arbeit – nachprüfen und glätten von Beweisen die ich
größtenteils schon lange hatte. Trotzdem glaube ich daß die Arbeit nicht ganz ohne
Interesse ist. Das einfachste System der Aussagenlogik das ich kenne ist drin; es
besteht aus (𝛼) den allgemeinen Regeln der Transitivität, Reflexivität, etc, der
Ableitung (section 2 des Artikels); (𝛽) aus regeln für die negation, z.B. der einen
Regel
Wenn ¬𝑐aus 𝑎und ¬𝑏ableitbar ist, dann ist 𝑏aus 𝑎und 𝑐ableitbar.
Es genügt, dazu entweder (𝛾) anzunehmen
𝑐ist aus 𝑎und 𝑏ableitbar wenn, und nur wenn, 𝑐aus 𝑎. 𝑏ableitbar ist
oder (𝛾′)
𝑏⊃𝑐ist aus 𝑎ableitbar wenn, und nur wenn, 𝑐aus 𝑎und 𝑏ableitbar ist.
Dann hat man – mit entsprechenden Definitionen – die ganze Aussagenlogik.
(Ich habe die ganze Zeit Englisch geschrieben – ich mache dauernd Sprachfehler
wenn ich deutsch zu schreiben versuche !!)

Titel: Ich schlage vor, den Artikel zu nennen:
On Systems of Rules of Inference.
Der Titel ist nicht sehr gut, aber bisher ist mir kein besserer eingefallen.
Da ich nur ganz kurz in Zürich bleiben kann, wäre es mir lieb wenn Sie den Artikel
vorher durchlesen könnten, und, wenn möglich, ein paar Zeilen schreiben würden.
Meine Adresse bis 10. April, Mittag, ist
Hotel Du Parc, Mont Pèlerin sur Vevey.
Ich bin furchtbar müde und überarbeitet – ich habe seit Wochen jede Nacht bis 3
oder 4 Uhr früh gearbeitet; und es wird wohl so weiter gehen im Sommer Semester.
Es ist schauderhaft.
Bitte, bestätigen Sie mit einer Zeile den Empfang der Arbeit!
Ich freue mich schon sehr darauf Sie zu sehen – so sehr als ich, in meinem
gegenwärtigen Zustand der Übermüdung mich überhaupt auf etwas freuen kann!
Sehr herzlich grüßt Sie

Dear Professor,
I will travel to Switzerland tomorrow morning, and I plan to post this letter in
Switzerland; but it is written in London.
Here is the article. It has been a lot of work; and, mostly, not very interesting work
– checking and smoothing out of proofs which I, for the most part, have had for a long
time. Nevertheless I believe that the article is not completely without interest. It
contains the simplest system of propositional logic that I know; it consists of (𝛼) the
general rules of transitivity, reflexivity, etc., of derivation (section 2 of the article);
(𝛽) of rules for negation, e.g. the one rule
If ¬𝑐is derivable from 𝑎and ¬𝑏, then 𝑏is derivable from 𝑎and 𝑐.
For it is sufficient to suppose either (𝛾)
𝑐is derivable from 𝑎and 𝑏if, and only if, 𝑐is derivable from 𝑎. 𝑏
or (𝛾′)
𝑏⊃𝑐is derivable from 𝑎if, and only if, 𝑐is derivable from 𝑎and 𝑏.
Then one has got – with appropriate definitions – the whole of propositional logic.
(I have written in English the whole time – I constantly make mistakes when I try
to write German !!)
Title: I propose to call the article:
On Systems of Rules of Inference.
The title is not very good, but so far I could not think of a better one.
Due to the fact that I can only be in Zürich for a short time, I should be very glad
if you could read the article beforehand and, if possible, write a few lines.
My address until 10 April, midday, is
Hotel Du Parc, Mont Pèlerin sur Vevey.
I am terribly tired and overworked – for weeks I have been working every night
until 3 or 4 o’clock in the morning; and it will probably continue this way during the
summer semester. It is horrible.
Please confirm with a line the receipt of the article!
I am very much looking forward to seeing you – as much as I, in my current state
of fatigue, am capable of looking forward to anything!
Kindest greetings to you,
Yours,

seeing each other on the 11th of April in Zürich; I will certainly also be available in
the midmorning of the 12th. |

Lieber Professor Bernays,
Ich habe so lange nicht geschrieben! Ich war krank und habe einen Auto-Unfall
gehabt der mich um ein Haar getötet hätte. Außerdem habe ich sehr hart gearbeitet,
und habe dauernd neue Resultate bekommen die ich Ihnen mitteilen wollte – aber es
kamen immer weitere dazu, so daß ich nie dazukam.
Das erste wichtige Resultat, das ich etwa eine Woche nachdem ich Sie sah fertig
hatte war die Ausdehnung der Methode von
𝑎/𝑏∧𝑐↔𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/𝑐
zu quantification:
𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 ist das resultat der substitution von 𝑥für 𝑦in 𝑎(„𝑥“ und „𝑦“ sind variable
namen von variablen)
𝐴𝑥𝑏ist das Resultat von universeller quantification
𝐸𝑥𝑏

dann haben wir:

𝑦

𝐸𝑥𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
 ↔𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥

|

Diese Formeln definieren Universelle und Existenzielle quantification.
Das war das wichtigste Resultat. Aber es gibt eine Menge weitere Resultate.
Ich fand daß ich am besten zunächst Resultate veröffentlichen sollte (da die
Beweise lang und kompliziert sind), und da ich eine Gelegenheit dazu hatte,
veröffentlichte ich die hauptsächlichen Resultate zunächst in MIND. Ich brachte alle
die Fußnoten hinein (und eine oder die andere dazu) die wir in Zürich besprochen
hatten. Die Offprints habe ich erst jetzt bekommen. Es sind eine Menge Fehler drin.
Ich schicke ein Fehlerverzeichnis mit.

Dear Professor Bernays,
I have not written for such a long time! I was sick and had a car accident which
almost killed me. Furthermore, I have worked very hard, and have constantly
obtained new results that I wanted to communicate to you – but there were constantly
more of them, so I never put myself to do it.
The first important result, which I had finished about one week after I saw you,
was the extension of the method of
𝑎/𝑏∧𝑐↔𝑎/𝑏& 𝑎/𝑐
to quantification:
𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 is the result of the substitution of 𝑥for 𝑦in 𝑎(𝑥and 𝑦are variable names of
variables)
𝐴𝑥𝑏is the result of universal quantification
𝐸𝑥𝑏
—
existential
—
then we have:
𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝐴𝑥(𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
) ↔𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦

𝐸𝑥𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥
 ↔𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏 𝑦
𝑥

These formulas define universal and existential quantification.
That was the most important result. But there are a lot of further results.
I found that I should first publish results (due to the fact that the proofs are long
and complicated), and because I had an occasion to do it, I published the main results
in Mind. I inserted all the footnotes (and some additional ones) that we talked about
in Zürich. Only now have I received the offprints. They contain a lot of errors. I
attach a list of errata.
Many thanks for your greetings through Scholz!f
Cordially greeting you,

Lieber Herr Professor Popper,
Schon sehr lange schulde ich Ihnen die Erwiderung auf Ihren Brief, den Sie mir
etwa zugleich mit Ihrer Abhandlung „New Foundations for Logic“ sandten.
Inzwischen empfing ich zwei weitere Publikationen von Ihnen mit freundlicher
Widmung. Haben Sie schönen Dank für alle diese Zusendungen! – Es tat mir sehr
leid zu hören, dass es ihnen gesundheitlich nicht gut ging und dass Ihnen ein
Auto-Unfall zustiess. Ich hoffe aus Ihrer Mitteilung über Ihre intensive Arbeit
entnehmen zu können, dass Ihr Ergehen sich seit damals wesentlich gebessert hat.
Zur Lektüre der drei von Ihnen empfangenen Abhandlungen bin ich erst in diesem
Frühjahr gekommen; sie erfolgte grösstenteils in Braunwald (das Sie doch auch
kennen) wo ich mich im März einige Tage (wie schon in den vorigen beiden Jahren)
aufhielt.
Ihre Abhandlungen haben mich natürlich sehr interessiert. Nur habe ich
hinsichtlich der allgemeinen Tendenz der Betrachtungen nicht eine solche
Einhelligkeit mit meiner Einstellung vorgefunden, wie ich sie nach unseren hiesigen
mündlichen Aussprachen erwartet hätte. Eine Gelegenheit dazu, dass wir diese
Dinge mündlich mit eindander diskutieren, wird vielleicht – nach dem, was ich
kürzlich von Herrn Gonsethg hörte, bald gegeben sein; er erzählte mir, dass Sie für
diesen Sommer eine Einladung zu Vorträgen hier in Zürich hätten. Doch wieviel Sie
dann hier Zeit haben werden, ist ja immerhin fraglich; jedenfalls möchte ich mich
jetzt schon zu einigen Punkten Ihrer Ausführungen äussern.
Meine erste Bemerkung betrifft section 3 Ihrer „New Foundations . . .“. Die hier
in den Darlegungen von p. 210–211 behauptete Gleichwertigkeit der „basis II“ mit
der „basis I“ scheint mir nicht zuzutreffen. Ich habe mir zum Nachweis folgendes
Modell überlegt: Die Beziehung 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏werde gedeutet durch die
arithmetische Beziehung |
2
zwischen natürlichen Zahlen 𝑎1 + . . . + 𝑎𝑛≥𝑏; 𝑏∧𝑐
bedeute das Maximum von 𝑏und 𝑐. Dann sind (Rg), (Te), (Cg) erfüllt, dagegen nicht
(Tg), auch nicht (3.4 g), noch auch (3.4).
Sodann kann ich Ihre Methode der expliziten Definition der „compounds“ (p. 218)
nicht als ein eigentliches Definitionsverfahren akzeptieren. Sie behaupten, dass
solche Definitionen uns erlauben, jeweils das definierte Zeichen ohne Schwierigkeit
„from any context“ zu eliminieren. Das dürfte aber kaum zutreffen. Betrachten Sie
etwa folgendes Beispiel einer nach dem Schema (D5) gebildeten Definition
𝑎//𝑏⊲𝑐↔(𝑏/𝑎& 𝑎/𝑐)
g Ferdinand Gonseth (1890–1975). Mathematician and philosopher who taught at the ETH Zürich
from 1929 to 1960.

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
387
Aus dieser erhält man, auf dem Weg über 𝑏⊲𝑐//𝑏⊲𝑐als abgeleitete Regeln 𝑏/𝑏⊲𝑐;
𝑏⊲𝑐/𝑐und aus diesen beiden, mittels (Ts), 𝑏/𝑐, sodass das theoretische System sich
als inkonsistent erweist. Gleichermassen kommt man zur Inkonsistenz mit folgender
nach dem Schema (D5) gebildeten (Konjunktion und Disjunktion benutzenden)
Definition: 𝑎//𝑏◦𝑐↔(𝑏∧𝑐/𝑎& 𝑎/𝑏∨𝑐)
Die Einführung eines compound nach dem Schema (D5) ist also überhaupt nicht
generell, sondern nur bei besonderer Gestalt des Definiens zulässig; dieses Schema
kann also gewiss nicht als eine Form von expliziter Definition gelten.
Abgesehen von dieser besonderen Einführungsform kann man sich klar machen,
dass die Einführung der compounds nicht den Charakter einer blossen
Begriffserklärung hat, nämlich durch folgende Erwägung: Beschränken wir uns auf
die Beziehung 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏und die für sie geltenden Axiome (Rg) und (Tg), so ist
mit diesen die Deutung vereinbar, wonach 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏besagt, dass 𝑏mit einer der
Aussagen 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛übereinstimmt. Bei Hinzunahme der Konjunktion ist dagegen
diese Deutung nicht mehr möglich, wenigstens wenn wir annehmen, dass es
mindestens zwei verschiedene Aussagen gibt.
|
3
Der gleiche Umstand macht sich auch in Hinsicht auf den Begriff der „absolute
validity“ geltend, wie Sie ihn in Ihrer Abhandlung „Logic without assumptions“
einführen. Nämlich aufgrund Ihrer Definition der absolute validity (p. 277) kann eine
inference – wenigstens vor der Einführung von compounds – nur dann absolutely
valid sein, wenn sie gemäss der Regel (Rg) erfolgt. Kann sich aber durch die
Einführung der compounds etwas daran ändern? Diese Einführung erfolgt ja, Ihrer
Anweisung gemäss, mittels des Begriffs der deduktiven Gleichwertigkeit 𝑎//𝑏,
welche zurückgeführt wird auf die deducibility 𝑎/𝑏. Es fragt sich nun, ob die
deducibility hier im Sinne bloss der valid inferences oder der absolutely valid
inferences zu verstehen ist. Im ersten Falle liesse sich nicht ersehen, wie für die
resultierenden Ableitungsregeln der compounds die absolute validity gefolgert
werden kann. Im anderen Falle aber macht überhaupt schon die Anwendung der
Definition für die compounds Schwierigkeit: Wird etwa die Konjunktion ihrer
logischen Stärke nach durch (D5.1) – aus New Foundations – definiert und seien
sonst noch keine compounds eingeführt; 𝑏, 𝑐seien zwei verschiedene Sätze; welche
Bedingung muss dann ein Satz 𝑎erfüllen, damit er die logische Stärke der
Konjunktion 𝑏∧𝑐besitzt? Da einerseits jedenfalls die inference von 𝑎auf 𝑎
absolutely valid ist, so muss auch (nach (D5.1)) die inference von 𝑏, 𝑐auf 𝑎
absolutely valid sein, also bei jeder statement-preserving interpretation stimmen; das
aber ist nur dann der Fall, wenn 𝑎mit einer der Aussagen 𝑏, 𝑐übereinstimmt.
Hieraus folgt nun weiter, (da ja jedenfalls die inference von 𝑏, 𝑐auf 𝑐sowie die von
𝑏, 𝑐auf 𝑐absolutely valid ist), dass mindestens eine der inferences von 𝑏auf 𝑐oder
von 𝑐auf 𝑏absolutely valid sein müsste, während doch die beiden Sätze 𝑏, 𝑐
verschieden sind. Hiernach würde also ein Satz überhaupt nie der Konjunktion
zweier verschiedener Sätze deduktiv gleichwertig sein. (Ich hoffe, dass diese
Ueberlegung verständlich ausgedrückt ist.)

Nun habe ich mich noch zu Ihrer Kritik der Fassung des All-Schemas, wie sie in
den „Grundlagen der Math.“ gegeben ist, zu äussern. Ich meine die Stelle p. 232–233
Ihrer New Foundations. Sie werden gewiss erwarten, dass ich dazu Stellung nehme;

388
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
und ich glaube auch, dass ich den Sachverhalt befriedigend aufklären kann. Der
Widerspruch, den Sie, ausgehend von dem von Ihnen beanstandeten Schema
𝑎`𝑥> 𝑏/𝑎`𝑥> 𝐴𝑥𝑏herleiten, kommt im Formalismus der „Grundl. der Math.“
deshalb nicht zustande, weil hier die Implikation eine andere Rolle hat als das
„hypothetical“ in Ihrem Formalismus. Für die Implikation ist nämlich im
Formalismus des Grundlagenbuchs die Regel (4.2) Ihrer New Foundations (vgl.
p. 215) nicht allgemein gültig; es gilt zwar 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐→𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, aber die Umkehrung,
welche auf das „Deduktionstheorem“ hinauskommt, gilt nur unter einschränkenden
Bedingungen. Mit diesen Bedingungen hängt die Notwendigkeit der Unterscheidung
zwischen „Deduktionsgleichheit“ und „Ueberführbarkeit“ zusammen, wie sie auf
S. 49–50 des Grundlagenbuchs (Bd.I) dargelegt ist. Hier wird auch gerade das
Beispiel der Formel 𝐴(𝑎) →(𝑥)𝐴(𝑥) herangezogen, die ja der von Ihnen
betrachteten Beziehung 𝑎> 𝐴𝑥𝑎entspricht, und es wird ferner hervorgehoben, dass
der festgestellte Unterschied auf der Rolle der freien Variablen beruht. Wenn man in
der Weise, wie es im Formalismus des Grundlagenbuchs geschieht, für den
Uebergang von Beziehungen der Herleitbarkeit zu Implikations-Beziehungen
gewisse Einschränkungen (im Hinblick auf die Rolle der freien Variablen) beachtet,
so wird dadurch die Unterscheidung zwischen „rules of proof“ und „rules of
derivation“ entbehrlich. Man kann dann z.B. getrost die Einsetzungsregel als eine
rule of derivation statuieren.
Beiläufig bemerke ich noch: ich bin wohl nicht im Irrtum, wenn ich annehme,
dass in den Formeln p. 227, lines 14, 17, 18 Ihrer New Foundations ein Doppelstrich
// anstatt eines einfachen Striches stehen soll. |
5
(Dies scheint mir einerseits aus der
nachfolgenden Überlegung hervorzugehen, die sonst ja gar nicht verständlich wäre,
und auch aus der Bezugnahme auf p. 233, line 4.)
Schliesslich noch die Frage: Ist es nicht, mit Bezug auf die conditional rules,
sachgemässer von einer „antecedent inference“ und einer „consequent inference“ zu
sprechen, anstatt, wie es auf p. 202 Ihrer New Foundations geschieht, von einer
„antecedent rule“ und einer „consequent rule“? (Meiner Ansicht nach besagt z.B. das
Transitivitätsgesetz (Ts), dass, wenn die inferences 𝑎/𝑏, 𝑏/𝑐beide gültig sind, dann
auch die inference 𝑎/𝑐gültig ist. Man kann hieraus auch eine
Abhängigkeits-Beziehung zwischen Regeln entnehmen; das ist aber dann eine
indirekte und spezielle Anwendung des Transitivitätsgesetzes.)
Nun ist dieser Brief recht lang geworden, obwohl ich mich bemühte, mich
einigermassen konzentriert zu fassen.
In der Aussicht, Sie eventuell bald hier zu sehen, grüsst Sie herzlich
Ihr
P. Bernays
Ich bitte auch um eine Empfehlung an Ihre Frau.

Dear Professor Popper,

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
389
For quite some time I have owed you an answer to your letter which you sent me
together with your article “New Foundations for Logic”. In the meantime I received
two further publications from you with a dedication. Many thanks for all these
mailings. – I was very sorry to hear about your poor health and that you had a car
accident. I hope that I can gather from your notice about your intensive work that
your well-being has improved substantially since then.
I managed only this spring to read the three treatises I received from you; I read
them mostly in Braunwald (which you also know) where I spent some days in March
(as in the previous two years).
Your treatises were naturally of great interest to me. It is just that with regards to
the general tendency of the observations I did not find such an unanimity with my
own attitudes, as I had expected after our oral discussions which we had here. An
occasion to discuss these things in person may soon arise – after what I heard from
Mr Gonsethg; he told me that you have an invitation for lectures here in Zürich. How
much time you will have here is another question; in any case, I would like to
comment on some of the points in your remarks right away.
My first remark concerns section 3 of your “New Foundations . . .”. The
equivalence of “basis II” with the “basis I” which is asserted on p. 210–211 in the
presentation does not seem to hold. To prove this I came up with the following model:
The relation 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏is to be interpreted through the arithmetical relation
between natural numbers 𝑎1 + . . . + 𝑎𝑛≥𝑏; 𝑏∧𝑐denotes the maximum of 𝑏and 𝑐.
Then (Rg), (Te), (Cg) are satisfied, but not (Tg), and neither (3.4 g), nor (3.4).
Furthermore I cannot accept your method of explicit definition of the
“compounds” (p. 218) as a proper definition procedure. You claim that such
definitions allow us to eliminate the defined sign without difficulty “from any
context”. This can hardly be the case. Consider the following example of a definition
constructed according to the schema (D5)
𝑎//𝑏⊲𝑐↔(𝑏/𝑎& 𝑎/𝑐)
From this one obtains, by going through 𝑏⊲𝑐//𝑏⊲𝑐the rules 𝑏/𝑏⊲𝑐; 𝑏⊲𝑐/𝑐as
derived rules, and from these two, with (Ts), 𝑏/𝑐, so that the theoretical system
reveals itself to be inconsistent. Equally one arrives at the inconsistency with the
following definition, which is constructed according to schema (D5) and which uses
conjunction and disjunction: 𝑎//𝑏◦𝑐↔(𝑏∧𝑐/𝑎& 𝑎/𝑏∨𝑐)
So the introduction of a compound according to the schema (D5) is not at all
general, but only admissible for particular forms of the definiens; this schema can
certainly not count as a form of explicit definition.
Except for this special form of introduction one can convince oneself that the
introduction of the compounds does not have the character of a simple explication of
a concept, by means of the following consideration: if we restrict ourselves to the
relation 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏and the axioms (Rg) and (Tg) which hold for it, then the
interpretation according to which 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏says that 𝑏is identical with one of
the propositions 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, is compatible with them. The addition of conjunction

390
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
makes this interpretation no longer possible, at least if we assume that there are at
least two different propositions.
The same circumstance also applies to the concept of “absolute validity”, in the
way in which you introduce it in your treatise “Logic without assumptions”. Due to
your definition of absolute validity (p. 277), an inference can only be absolutely valid
– at least before the introduction of compounds – if it is made in accordance with the
rule (Rg). But can the introduction of the compounds change something about this?
This introduction takes places, according to your instruction, with the help of the
concept of deductive equality 𝑎//𝑏which is reduced to the deducibility 𝑎/𝑏. This
raises the question whether the deducibilty here has to be understood merely in the
sense of the valid inferences or of the absolutely valid inferences. In the first case one
could not see how the absolute validitiy for the resulting inference rules of the
compounds can be derived. But in the other case already the application of the
definition for the compounds poses difficulties: if, for example, the conjunction is
defined according to its logical strength through (D5.1) – from New Foundations –
and if no further compounds have been introduced; let 𝑏, 𝑐be two different sentences;
which condition does a sentence 𝑎have to fulfil in order for it to have the logical
strength of the conjunction 𝑏∧𝑐? Since, on the one hand, the inference from 𝑎to 𝑎is
absolutely valid, so also (according to (D5.1)) the inference from 𝑏, 𝑐to 𝑎has to be
absolutely valid, and thus be valid for every statement-preserving interpretation; but
this is only the case when 𝑎is identical to one of the propositions 𝑏, 𝑐. From this it
follows, furthermore, (since the inference from 𝑏, 𝑐to 𝑐as well as the inference from
𝑏, 𝑐to 𝑐is absolutely valid), that at least one of the inferences from 𝑏to 𝑐or from 𝑐
to 𝑏would have to be absolutely valid, while the two sentences 𝑏, 𝑐are different.
According to this no sentence would ever be deductively equal to the conjunction of
two different sentences. (I hope that this thought is expressed intelligibly.)
Now I have to comment upon your critique of the formulation of the all-schema,
as it is given in the “Grundlagen der Math.”. I think of the passage p. 232–233 of
your New Foundations. You will certainly expect that I comment upon this; and I
also believe that I can elucidate the situation satisfactorily. The contradiction that you
derive, starting with the schema 𝑎`𝑥> 𝑏/𝑎`𝑥> 𝐴𝑥𝑏, which you criticize, does not
arise in the formalism of the “Grundl. der Math.”, because the implication plays
another role here than the “hypothetical” in your formalism. For the implication in
the formalism of the Grundlagen book, the rule (4.2) of your New Foundations (cp.
p. 215) is not generally valid; one has indeed 𝑎/𝑏> 𝑐→𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, but the converse,
which amounts to the “deduction theorem”, is only valid under restricting
circumstances. The necessity of the distinction between “equality of deduction” and
“transformation” is related to these restrictions, as is explained on p. 49–50 of the
Grundlagen book (vol. 1). The example of the formula 𝐴(𝑎) →(𝑥)𝐴(𝑥) is used
here, which corresponds to the relation 𝑎> 𝐴𝑥𝑎, which you consider, and it is
emphasized that the observed difference is due to the role of the free variables. If one
observes, as is done in the formalism of the Grundlagen book, certain restrictions
(with regard to the role of the free variables) for the transition of the relations of
deducibility to the relations of implication, then the distinction between “rules of

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
391
proof” and “rules of derivation” becomes dispensable. One can then confidently
postulate, e.g., the substitution rule as a rule of derivation.
In passing, I note also: I am probably not mistaken if I assume that in the formulas
p. 227, lines 14, 17, 18 of your New Foundations there should be a double slanted
line // instead of a single slanted line. (This seems to me to follow from the next
remark, which otherwise would not be comprehensible, and from the references on
p. 233, line 4.)
At last the question: is it not, concerning the conditional rules, more appropriate
to speak of an “antecedent inference” and a “consequent inference”, instead, as is
done on p. 202 of your New Foundations, of an “antecedent rule” and a “consequent
rule”? (In my opinion the transitivity law (Ts) says that, if both of the inferences 𝑎/𝑏,
𝑏/𝑐are valid, then the inference 𝑎/𝑐is also valid. From this one can extract a
dependency relation between rules; but this is an indirect and special application of
the transitivity law.)
Now this letter has turned out to be quite long, despite my efforts to keep myself
somewhat focused.
In the prospect of possibly seeing you here soon, cordially,
Yours,
P. Bernays
Please also extend my greetings to your wife.

Lieber Professor Bernays,
vielen, vielen Dank für Ihren Brief! Dass er etwas deprimierend war, ist meine
Schuld – man macht nicht gerne Fehler! Aber da ich die Fehler nun einmal gemacht
habe, bin ich Ihnen zu grösstem Dank verpflichtet, dass Sie mir so ausführlich und
schön darüber geschrieben haben.
Kein Zweifel, Sie haben in allem recht. Bezüglich meiner Basis II habe ich auch
nicht ein Wort zu erwidern. Aber bezüglich der anderen Punkte glaube ich doch, dass
sich die Sache reparieren lässt. (Damit will ich natürlich nicht zurücknehmen, dass
Sie recht haben.)
(1) Seite 2 Ihres Briefes – die Inkonsistenz.
Ich habe selbst in meiner „Logic without Assumptions“ ein solches Beispiel
gegeben (Definition 7.8, p. 284) und ich glaube, dass die Sache anders interpretiert
werden kann (wie ich dort andeutete), nämlich so, dass jede Sprache die ein Zeichen

392
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
enthält das so definiert ist, inkonsistent ist, während die Metasprache (d.h. mein
System) es nicht ist; Ihr „𝑏⊲𝑐“ würde einfach der Name eines paradoxen Satzes sein.
Jedoch habe ich immer empfunden, dass hier eine Schwäche vorliegt, und ich habe,
glaube ich, einen besseren Ausweg gefunden. (Er is am Ende der beigelegten
englischen Berichtigung besprochen.)
(2) Seite 3 Ihres Briefes: Eine ganz ähnliche Kritik schickte mir Quine am
19. April.h Die Kritik ist voll berechtigt, aber der Schaden, glaube ich, reparabel. Ich
lege einen Durchschlag meines Briefes an Quine bei; die Reparatur ist in der
Berichtigung enthalten.
Ich finde jedoch diese Reparatur höchst unelegant. Für Ihre Kritik wäre ich Ihnen
ungemein dankbar. Wenn sie nur bald käme! Ich habe wirklich kein Recht zu klagen,
aber wenn Sie früher hätten schreiben können, wäre vieles besser geworden. Ich bin
hier schrecklich isoliert; und da ich, wie Sie wissen, mehr Philosoph als Logiker bin,
bin ich auf Kritik sehr angewiesen. (Ich habe inzwischen selbst 2 Fehler in meiner
„Functional Logic“ gefunden, aber sie sind verhältnismässig leicht zu reparieren.
Dazu kommen nun noch die Fehler die mit der unhaltbaren „Basis II“
zusammenhängen. Glücklicherweise habe ich inzwischen eine einfachere
Konstruktion gemacht, durch die die Basis II ganz überflüssig wird; denn ich brauche
für Basis I nur die eine einfache Formel:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏↔(𝑐)((𝑐/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑐/𝑎𝑛) →𝑐/𝑏)
Dennoch wäre ich froh gewesen, über diesen Fehler früher zu hören.)
(3) Seite 4 Ihres Briefes. Diese Punkte habe ich mir in der Tat inzwischen selbst
aufgeklärt . . .. |

(4) Seite 4 Ihres Briefes (Ende): das scheint mir nicht nötig zu sein; natürlich kann
man hier überall „//“ für „/“ setzen, aber es ist überflüssig. Denn wenn
𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

eine rule of inference ist, dann haben wir auch
Diff (𝑥, 𝑦)/Diff (𝑦, 𝑦)
(𝑥≠𝑦)
¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)
(𝑥≠𝑦)
oder:
(Wobei „Diff (𝑥, 𝑦)“ der Name eines Satzes von der Form „he1 ≠he2“ ist.) Da nun
Diff (𝑦, 𝑦) kontradiktorisch ist, besagt unsere Formel dass Diff (𝑥, 𝑦) (𝑥≠𝑦) auch
kontradiktorisch ist, unabhängig von den konstanten Werten die wir für „he1“
einsetzen; und das kann nur dann der Fall sein, wenn es nur ein Individuum
gibt.⟨Fußnote: Wir bekommen von ¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦) natürlich
Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), i.e. dasselbe Resultat.⟩
(5) Seite 5 Ihres Briefes: Auch hier stimme ich vielleicht nicht überein (siehe
meinen Brief an Quine, und den Anfang der neuen note 12 in der Berichtigung). Die
metalinguistische Formel:

„(𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎/𝑐“
muss unterschieden werden von der meta-metalinguistischen Formel:
„Wenn ‚𝑎/𝑏‘ and ‚𝑏/𝑐‘ gültig sind, dann ist auch ‚𝑎/𝑐‘ gültig.“
In der Tat, nur wenn diese Unterscheidung gemacht wird, ist die ganze Theorie
möglich, so weit ich sehen kann. (Es geht hier mit dem Gültigkeitsbegriff wie mit
dem Wahrheitsbegriff.)
Ich habe nichts von Gonseth gehört. Vielleicht kann ich Sie aber doch Ende
September in der Schweiz sehen.
Ich wäre für eine baldige Antwort sehr dankbar, aber ich weiss wohl, dass Sie
anderes und wichtigeres zu tun haben.
Nochmals sehr vielen Dank und schöne Grüße von meiner Frau und mir.

Nochmals vielen Dank!
P.S. Ich schick Ihnen noch eine Veröffentlichung „On the Theory of Deduction I and
II“ – leider wieder mit der unglückseligen „Basis II“. Aber es bleiben doch eine
Menge Bemerkungen übrig, nachdem der Abschnitt zwei (über Basis II) weggelassen
ist. Ich habe auch eine Anzahl von neuen Resultaten – aber ich glaube nicht, dass ich
es je wieder wagen werde etwas zu veröffentlichen (abgesehen vielleicht von einer
unendlichen Sequenz von Korrekturnoten zu meinen alten Veröffentlichungen)!

Dear Professor Bernays,
Very, very many thanks for your letter! The fact that it was a bit depressing is
entirely my fault – one does not like to make mistakes! But since I have made these
mistakes, I owe you my greatest gratitude, since you wrote to me so extensively and
nicely about them.
No doubt, you are right in everything. Concerning my Basis II I have nothing in
response. But concerning the other points, I believe that the thing can be repaired.
(But of course I do not mean to take away the fact that you are right.)
(1) Page 2 of your letter – the inconsistency.
I have given, in my “Logic without Assumptions”, such an example myself
(Definition 7.8, p. 284) and I believe that the situation can be interpreted in another
way (as I indicated there), namely, that every language which contains a sign which is
defined in that way is inconsistent, while the meta-language (i.e. my system) is not;
your “𝑏⊲𝑐” would just be the name of a paradoxical sentence. But I have always felt
that there is a weakness here, and I have, I believe, found a better way out. (It is
discussed at the end of the attached English correction.)

394
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
(2) Page 3 of your letter: A very similar critique was sent to me by Quine on April
19th.h The critique is wholly justified, but the damage is, I think, reparable. I enclose
a carbon copy of my letter to Quine; the repair is contained in the correction.
But I find this repair highly inelegant. I would be immensely grateful for your
critique. If only it would arrive soon! I really have no right to complain, but if you
could have written earlier, much would have been improved. I am terribly isolated
here; and due to the fact that I am, as you know, more philosopher than logician, I am
very reliant upon critique. (In the meantime I have found 2 mistakes myself in my
“Functional Logic”, but they are comparably easy to repair. To this one must add the
mistakes which are related to the untenable “Basis II”. Luckily I have made an easier
construction, which makes the Basis II entirely superfluous; because I need for
Basis I only the one simple formula:
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏↔(𝑐)((𝑐/𝑎1 & . . . & 𝑐/𝑎𝑛) →𝑐/𝑏)
I would have been happy nonetheless to hear earlier about this error.)
(3) Page 4 of your letter. In the meantime I have resolved these points myself.
(4) Page 4 of your letter (end): this does not seem to be necessary to me; of course
we can put “//” for “/” everywhere, but it is superfluous. Because if
𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦

is a rule of inference, then we also have
Diff (𝑥, 𝑦)/Diff (𝑦, 𝑦)
(𝑥≠𝑦)
¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)
(𝑥≠𝑦)
or:
(Where “Diff (𝑥, 𝑦)” is the name of a sentence of the form “he1 ≠he2”.) Since
Diff (𝑦, 𝑦) is contradictory, our formula says that Diff (𝑥, 𝑦) (𝑥≠𝑦) also has to be
contradictory, independently from the constant values that we substitute for “he1”;
and this can only be the case if there is only one individual.⟨Footnote: We get from
¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦) of course Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), i.e. the same result.⟩
(5) Page 5 of your letter: I do not quite agree here either (see my letter to Quine,
and the beginning of the new note 12 in the correction). The metalinguistic formula:
“(𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎/𝑐”
has to be distinguished from the meta-metalinguistic formula:
“If ‘𝑎/𝑏’ and ‘𝑏/𝑐’ are valid, then ‘𝑎/𝑐’ is also valid.”
In fact, only if this distinction is made is the whole theory possible, as far as I can see.
(It is with the concept of validity here as with the concept of truth.)
I have heard nothing from Gonseth. But maybe I can see you by the end of
September in Switzerland.
I would be very grateful for a timely response, but I certainly know that you have
other and more important things to do.

Again, very many thanks and best regards from me and my wife.
Your very loyal
K. R. Popper
Again many thanks!
P.S. I send you another publication “On the Theory of Deduction I and II” –
regrettably again with the unfortunate “Basis II”. But there still remain a lot of
remarks, after the section two (on Basis II) is omitted. I have also a number of new
results – but I do not believe that I will ever dare again to publish something (except,
maybe, an infinite sequence of corrections to my old publications)!
21.8.1 Corrections to Logic without Assumptions
ETH Hs 975 : 3654. Typescript with handwritten corrections,4p. Sent as an attachment
to the letter in § 21.8. Popper sent a very similar list of errata to Quine; cf. this volume,
§ 30.5.1.
Corrections to “Logic without Assumptions”.
I am greatly obliged to Professors W.V. Quine and Paul Bernays for having raised
certain objections to my paper. It appears to me that some of these objections (to the
concept of a “free property”, i.e. to definition (D5) and note 16 of the paper) are
completely justified, and that the others, even though they may be met, nevertheless
show that some of my formulations were, to say the least, misleading. It seems to me
however, that all my conclusions remain unaffected; the necessary alterations, it
appears, are all confined to pp. 277, 279, 280. (Besides these important corrections, I
wish to draw attention to one particularly misleading erratum on p. 292; in line 7
from end, read “object” instead of “meta”.) The corrections I wish to make are:
p. 277, shift the phrase “covered by this definition,” from line 10 to line 9 (before
“and”), and put in its place, in line 10, the following: “i.e., of rules which are valid
independently of the logical form of the statements involved (cp. the second
paragraph of section 7, below),”.
Same page: replace footnote 12 by the following new footnote:
“12We must be careful not to confound rules of inference which are absolutely valid
(and therefore valid) with rules about assertions about absolutely valid inference. For
example, a rule like the following holds:
“If, for certain statements 𝑎and 𝑏, the assertion that 𝑎is deducible from 𝑏is
absolutely valid, then, for the same statements the assertion that 𝑏is deducible from
𝑎is absolutely valid also.”
But the corresponding rule of inference
“If, for certain statements 𝑎and 𝑏, 𝑎is deducible from 𝑏, then, for the same
statements, 𝑏is deducible from 𝑎.”
is invalid, and therefore not absolutely valid.
In order to define “absolutely valid rule of inference” in such a way that it only
covers rules of inference which are valid irrespective of the formative signs which

396
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
occur in the various statements involved, we first distinguish atomic and molecular
rules. Using the symbolism introduced in the next paragraph of the text,
“𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” and “𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1” are examples of atomic rules (invalid
and valid respectively). Examples of molecular rules are:
(A) “𝑎/𝑎and 𝑏/𝑎”
(invalid) |
2
(B) “𝑎/𝑎and (𝑎𝑏/𝑏and 𝑎𝑏𝑐/𝑐)”
(valid)
(C) “If 𝑎/𝑎then 𝑎/𝑏”
(invalid)
(D) “If 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑐, then 𝑎/𝑐”
(valid)
(A) and (B) we call simply conjunctive rules, (C) and (D) we call simply conditional
rules; we shall also use the term “component rule”, “antecedent (rule)”, “consequent
(rule)”, in an obvious way. Note that in our “simply conditional rules”, the
consequent must be atomic, and the antecedent either atomic or simply conjunctive.
We now can define absolute validity for atomic, simply conjunctive, and simply
conditional rules, as follows:
An atomic rule is absolutely valid if and only if no statement-preserving
counter-example of it exists (that is to say, if and only if no statement-preserving
interpretation of it is a counter-example).
A simply conjunctive rule is absolutely valid if, and only if, all its components are
absolutely valid.
A simply conditional rule is absolutely valid if and only if every
statement-preserving interpretation which turns its consequent into a counter
example also turns its antecedent into a counter-example. (We assume that a
counter-example of a component of a conjunctive rule is a counter-example of the
whole conjunctive rule; this allows us to deal with a conjunctive antecedent.)
It can be easily seen that these definitions lay down necessary as well as sufficient
conditions for the three types of rules under consideration to be absolutely valid. The
definitions cover most of the cases in which we are interested. In order to extend it to
all intended cases, we define next:
A rule of inference 𝑅0 is called “secondary to the rules of inference
𝑅1, 𝑅2, . . . , 𝑅𝑛” if and only if every inference drawn in observance with 𝑅0 can be
drawn in observance of 𝑅1, 𝑅2, . . . , 𝑅𝑛(without appealing to 𝑅0).
According to this definition, every rule is secondary to itself.
We now can give a general definition of absolutely valid rules as follows:
A rule of inference is absolutely valid if and only if it is secondary to atomic,
simply conjunctive, and simply conditional rules which are absolutely valid in the
sense defined above.”
(This concludes note 12.)

p. 279–280: replace the passage from the word “For” in line 17 on p. 279 to the
end of line 19 on p. 280 by the following:
“For it turns out that (D4) is equivalent to the following definition:
(D5) An inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, the conclusion is one of the
premises.
This definition avoids the term “truth”; but it should be observed that it is of use
only because we can show that it guarantees the transmission of truth from the
premisses to the conclusion.

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
397
As it stands, (D5) is not very helpful; what we need is, rather, the corresponding
idea of an absolutely valid rule of inference, defined with the help of (D5) or of an
equivalent definition.
In order to achieve this end, we can introduce the idea of a statement-preserving
numerical interpretation of an inference or a rule of inference. This is an
interpretation which identifies each of the 𝑚different statements (or variables)
occurring in the inference (or rule) with one of the first 𝑚natural numbers, and
which interprets the expression “𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” to mean “one at least of the
numbers 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is at least equal to the number 𝑏.” We can, further, define a
statement-preserving (numerical) counter-example of an inference or rule of
inference as a statement-preserving numerical interpretation which is arithmetically
false.16
We can now replace (D5) by the definition:
(D5′) An inference (or rule of inference) is absolutely valid if, and only if, no
statement preserving numerical counter-example of it exists.
The search for such a counter-example must, in every particular case, lead after a
finite number of steps to a decision concerning the absolute validity of the particular
rule in question.17 (The method is somewhat similar to that of deciding a formula of
the propositional calculus by way of truth-tables.) It can be easily shown, for
example, that ⟨upon⟩i our definition (D5) of absolute validity which avoids any
reference to truth, the rules (6.1g) and (6.2g) are absolutely valid, and similarly (6.6),
and the rules analogous to it.18”
(This concludes the text-correction on pp. 279–280. The remaining corrections
are to the notes 16,17 and 18 on these two pages, and a new note, 23a, on p. 284.)
p. 279, note 16: replace this note by the following new note:
“16For instance, a counter example of the rule “If 𝑎/𝑏then 𝑏/𝑎” is “If 2/1 then
1/2”. – The use of the words “arithmetically false” does not (as it may appear)
re-introduce the words “true” or “false” which we intended to eliminate; the words
we intended |
4
to eliminate refer to the statements (𝑎1, 𝑎2, etc.) of the interpretations;
those which we retain refer to such arithmetical statements as “1/2”, i.e., “1 is at least
as great as 2”, etc. (In other words, the problem is shifted to the metalanguage.)”
p. 280, note 17: replace this note by the following new note:
“17If the number of variables is considerable, the search for a counter-example
may, of course, be long. But it is usually quite easy to design methods by which the
procedure can be simplified. For example, in order to construct a counter-example of
the invalid rule
“(If 𝑎/𝑏then 𝑐/𝑑) then (if 𝑎, 𝑎1/𝑏then 𝑐, 𝑎1/𝑑)”,
we first interpret the last component, “𝑐, 𝑎1/𝑑” by “1, 1/2”. Since this does not lead
to a counter-example of the rule, we next choose “1, 2/3” instead of “1, 1/2”; and
this, indeed, leads to the counter-example “(If 1/2 then 1/3) then (if 1, 2/2 then
1, 2/3)”. (This, in turn, can be evaluated by the truth-table method.)”

numerical interpretation of the whole defining formula which renders this formula
true. (“For every 𝑏” or “For every 𝑐” etc., has to be interpreted – if we wish to avoid
such definitions as 7.8 – by the phrase: “For every number up to a number which
exceeds the other numbers used in the interpretation by not more than 1.”)”

Lieber Herr Professor Popper,
Haben Sie vielen Dank für Ihren freundlichen Antwortbrief! Ich hätte ihn gern,
Ihrem Wunsch gemäss, schneller beantwortet; aber im letzten Semestermonat fand
ich nicht die Sammlung, um mir die Ausführungen Ihres Briefes, sowie der von
Ihnen beigefügten zwei Beilagen, genauer zu überdenken. Die Fragen sind ja zum
Teil ziemlich subtil. Und ich kann Ihnen auch diesmal nicht zu allem meine
Zustimmung erklären.
Zunächst habe ich Bedenken inbezug auf Ihre neue Definition (D5′) der
„absolutely valid inference“, wie Sie sie auf p. 3 ihrer „Corrections“ geben. Dass diese
Definition nicht adäquat ist, glaube ich Ihnen durch ein Beispiel belegen zu können,
wobei ich von dem Umstande Gebrauch mache, dass Sie auch Regeln in Betracht
ziehen, bei denen conditional rules als antecedent auftreten, – wie in dem Beispiel,
das Sie auf p. 4 Ihrer Corrections (in der neuen Fassung der Fussnote 17) betrachten.
Mein Beispiel ist das folgende:
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and (if 𝑎/𝑐then 𝑡/𝑑) and (if 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑡/𝑑), then 𝑡/𝑑.
Hier ergibt eine einfache Diskussion, dass kein statement-preserving numerical
counter-example existiert; andererseits erkennt man leicht, dass die angegebene
Schlussregel nicht gültig ist.
Der hier zutage tretende Mangel der betrachteten statement-preserving numerical
interpretation scheint mir darin zu bestehen, dass Sie nur denjenigen Fällen der
Gültigkeit von inferences 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏angepasst ist, in denen schon für mindestens
ein einzelnes 𝑎𝑖die inference 𝑎𝑖/𝑏gültig ist.
Was ferner Punkt (4) Ihres Briefes betrifft, so muss ich durchaus auf der
Anerkennung der Schlussregel 𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
, (nota bene |
2
unter der Bedingung, dass 𝑥und

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
399
𝑦in 𝑎und in 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 freie Variablen sind), bestehen. Das ist ja einfach die
Einsetzungsregel. Mit Hilfe dieser Regel bekommt man in der Tat
¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦). Aus der Gültigkeit dieser inference kann man aber
keineswegs diejenige der inference Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) entnehmen. Hier macht sich
wiederum der Unterschied geltend, der zwischen der Implikation und Ihrem
hypothetical besteht. (Vgl. S. 4 meines vorigen Briefes). Für dieses hypothetical gilt
nicht die Regel der Kontraposition, wenn Formeln mit freien Variablen zugelassen
werden, weil eine Formel mit freien Variablen im Sinne einer All-Aussage zu
interpretieren ist, jedoch die Negation dieser All-Aussage nicht durch die formale
Negation jener Formel dargestellt wird. ¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) ist (im Sinne der Interpretation)
nicht das kontradiktorische Gegenteil von Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), sondern eine stärkere Aussage.
Bei Punkt (5) Ihres Briefes scheint es mir, dass die Unterscheidung zwischen
einer metalinguistischen Formel und einer meta-metalinguistischen Formel, deren
Notwendigkeit Sie erwähnen, gerade im Sinne meiner Erwägung liegt. Vielleicht
macht folgende Überlegung deutlicher wie ich das meine: Die inferences sind die
Gegenstände der derivative logic, die rules of inference sind Sätze dieser Logik.
Deuten wir die Formel (𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎/𝑐so, dass 𝑎/𝑏(und ebenso 𝑏/𝑐sowie
𝑎/𝑐) eine rule bedeutet, so ist „𝑎/𝑏“ nicht der Wortlaut (die Figur) dieser rule,
sondern eine Bezeichnung dieser rule. Unsere Formel ist daher gemäss dieser
Deutung nicht eine solche der (bereits metalinguistischen) derivative logic sondern
der zugehörigen Metatheorie. Fassen wir dagegen „𝑎/𝑏“, „𝑏/𝑐“, „𝑎/𝑐“ als
Bezeichnungen von inferences auf, so stellt die Formel einen Satz der derivative
logic dar. – Man kann sich den Sachverhalt, wiederum an dem Beispiel des
Transitivitätsgesetzes, auch folgendermassen zurecht legen: das deduktive
Transitivitätsgesetz betrifft primär nicht |
3
einen Zusammenhang zwischen
Schlussregeln sondern schlechtweg zwischen Folge-Beziehungen, in dem einfachen
Sinne, wie Sie es ausdrücken „𝑏follows from 𝑎“; dabei ist das „follow“ als
Grundbegriff für die derivative logic zu nehmen und nicht etwa als eine
(metatheoretische) Bezugnahme auf eine Regel der derivative logic.
Ich hoffe dass ich hiermit Ihnen deutlich gemacht habe weshalb ich es nicht
angemessen finde, bei den conditional rules von einer „antecedent rule“ und einer
„consequent rule“ zu sprechen.
Nun noch zu dem Punkt (1) aus Ihrem Brief wo es sich um die Definitionen von
compounds handelt, welche zu Widersprüchen führen. Was ich durch den Hinweis
auf die Möglichkeit eines solchen Zustandekommens von Inkonsistenz vor allem
zeigen wollte, war dass die betrachtete Definitionsform nicht den Charakter einer
eigentlichen (expliziten) Definition hat, dass vielmehr jene Art der Einführung eines
compounds der Aufstellung eines Existenz- und Eindeutigkeits-Axioms
gleichkommt. Allerdings ist richtig, dass man solche Axiome vom Standpunkt der
Metatheorie auf Definitionen von Eigenschaften einer deduktiven Sprache
zurückführen kann, in der Weise, wie Sie es auf p. 285/6 Ihrer „Logic without
assumptions“ tun. Aber diese Möglichkeit ist nur ein Spezialfall der generellen
Möglichkeit, Axiomensysteme auf einer höheren Stufe als explizite Definitionen zu

400
Karl R. Popper and Paul Bernays
behandeln. Auf diese Möglichkeit bin ich in einer Reviewj von einem
veröffentlichten Frege-Brief zu sprechen gekommen, von der ich Ihnen einen
Durchschlag des Konzeptes beilege. – (Die Veröffentlichung war übrigens durch den
üblen Herrn Steckk erfolgt, auf dessen Randbemerkungen ich aber auch in der
Review nicht eingegangen bin. Ich habe vielmehr nur die Gelegenheit benutzt, mich
über den seinerzeit stattgehabten Disput zwischen Hilbert und Frege zu äussern.)
Über die beiden letztbesprochenen Punkte wäre es gut sich mündlich eingehender
zu unterhalten. Ich hoffe, dass sich dazu bald Gelegenheit finden werde; aus dem
Programm des Amsterdamer Kongresses entnehme ich dass Sie an diesem
teilnehmen und dort vortragen werden. So gedenke ich Sie in ein paar Wochen dort
zu sehen. Einstweilen grüsst Sie herzlich Ihr
Paul Bernays
Beste Grüsse auch an ihre Frau.

Dear Professor Popper,
Many thanks for your friendly reply! I would have loved to have answered it
sooner, according to your wish; but in the last summer month I did not find the focus
to think about the remarks in your letter and the two supplements that you enclosed.
The questions are in part quite subtle. And this time again I cannot declare my
agreement to everything.
Firstly I am concerned about your new definition (D5′) of “absolutely valid
inference”, which you give on p. 3 of your “Corrections”. I hope to be able to show
to you by an example that this definition is not adequate. I make use of the fact that
you also consider rules where conditional rules appear as an antecedent, – as in the
example which you consider on p. 4 of your corrections (in the new version of
footnote 17).
My example is the following:
If 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and (if 𝑎/𝑐then 𝑡/𝑑) and (if 𝑏/𝑐then 𝑡/𝑑), then 𝑡/𝑑.
A simple discussion shows here that no statement-preserving numerical
counter-example exists; on the other hand, one sees easily that the indicated rule of
inference is not valid.
The flaw of the statement-preserving numerical interpretation that appears here
seems to consist in the fact that it is tailored to these cases of validity of inferences
𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏where for at least one 𝑎𝑖the inference 𝑎𝑖/𝑏is already valid.
Concerning point (4) of your letter, I must insist on the acceptance of the
inference rule 𝑎/𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
, (nota bene under the condition that 𝑥and 𝑦are free variables
in 𝑎and in 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
). That is just the substitution rule. With the help of this rule one
obtains in fact ¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦)/¬Idt(𝑦, 𝑦). But from the validity of this inference one
j Cf. Bernays (1942).
k For Steck’s role in Nazi Germany, cf. Menzler-Trott (2001, 2007).

21 Popper’s Correspondence with Paul Bernays
401
cannot obtain the validity of the inference Idt(𝑦, 𝑦)/Idt(𝑥, 𝑦). Here the difference
between implication and your hypothetical reasserts itself. (Cp. p. 4 of my previous
letter). For this hypothetical the rule of contraposition does not hold, if formulas with
free variables are admitted, because a formula with free variables has to be
interpreted as a universally quantified proposition, but the negation of this universally
quantified proposition is not represented through the formal negation of that formula.
¬Idt(𝑥, 𝑦) is (in the sense of the interpretation) not the contradictory opposite of
Idt(𝑥, 𝑦), but a stronger statement.
Concerning point (5) of your letter, it appears to me that the distinction between a
metalinguistic formula and a meta-metalinguistic formula, whose necessity you
mention, agrees with my considerations. Maybe the following thought makes clearer
what I mean: The inferences are the subject matter of derivative logic, the rules of
inference are theorems of this logic. If we interpret the formula (𝑎/𝑏& 𝑏/𝑐) →𝑎/𝑐
in such a way that 𝑎/𝑏(and also 𝑏/𝑐and 𝑎/𝑐) denotes a rule of inference, then “𝑎/𝑏”
is not the literal wording (the figure) of this rule, but a description/name of this rule.
Our formula is therefore according to this interpretation not a formula of the (already
metalinguistic) derivative logic, but of the corresponding meta-theory. If, on the
other hand, we take “𝑎/𝑏”, “𝑏/𝑐”, “𝑎/𝑐” to be descriptions/names of inferences, then
the formula presents a theoreml of derivative logic. – One can present oneself the
situation, taking the transitivity law as an example again, in the following way: the
deductive transitivity law does not primarily concern a relationship between inference
rules but between consequence-relations, in the simple sense, as you express it “𝑏
follows from 𝑎”; where the “follow” has to be taken as the fundamental concept of
derivative logic, and not as a (metatheoretical) reference to a rule of derivative logic.
I hope that I have made clear to you why I do not find it appropriate to speak
about an “antecedent rule” and a “consequent rule” in the case of conditional rules.
Now to the point (1) of your letter, which concerns definitions of compounds
which lead to contradictions. What I mainly wanted to show by pointing out the
possibility of the appearance of inconsistency was that the form of definition that is
considered does not have the character of a proper (explicit) definition, but that this
form of introduction of a compound is equivalent to the postulation of an existence
and a uniqueness axiom. It is in fact true that one can reduce such axioms from the
point of view of the meta-theory to definitions of properties of a deductive language,
in the way in which you do it on p. 285/6 of your “Logic without assumptions”. But
this possibility is just a special case of the general possibility to treat axiom systems
on a higher level as explicit definitions. I have spoken about this possibility in a
reviewj of a published Frege letter; I attach a carbon copy of the concept. – (The
publication was done by the nasty Mr. Steckk, on whose marginal notes I have not
commented upon in the review. I have used the occasion to comment upon the
dispute between Hilbert and Frege which took place during that time.)
On these last points it would be good to talk more thoroughly in person. I hope
that we will soon have the occasion, from the programme of the Amsterdam congress
I take it that you will participate and give a presentation there. So I hope to see you
there in a few weeks. Meanwhile warm regards, yours,
Paul Bernays

Lieber Herr Professor,
Ich habe soeben Ihren lieben Brief bekommen und will nur ganz kurz antworten –
das meiste muß ich wohl für Amsterdam lassen.
Ich habe kurz nachdem ich meinen Brief an Sie sandte selbst gefunden dass meine
numerical counter examples nicht genügen. Aber ich war so überlastet mit
unaufschieblicher Arbeit dass ich nicht schreiben konnte.

Die Hauptsache ist wohl daß die Definitionsmethode möglich ist; wie Sie sagen,
sie ist immer möglich. Aber es kommt mir doch so vor als ob das für die Logik
bedeutsam ist.

Können Sie es vielleicht nach Amsterdam mitbringen? Vielen Dank!

Dear Professor,
I have just received your nice letter and will answer only very briefly – I have to
leave the most of this for Amsterdam.
Shortly after I sent my letter to you I found myself that my numerical counter
examples are not sufficient. But I was so overburdened with unpostponable work that
I could not write.
The main point is that the method of definition is possible; as you say, it is always
possible. But it still seems to me as if this is relevant for logic.
Unfortunately you have not enclosed the review of the Frege letter. Can you
maybe bring it with you to Amsterdam? Thanks a lot!
I am already very much looking forward to seeing you.
With warmest regards,
Yours,

Sie erkundigten sich, ob Karl Popper etwas Wesentliches zur Aufklärung der
Grundlagen der Mathematik beigetragen habe. Jedenfalls hat er sich mit Fragen der
Logik und der Axiomatik eingehender befasst. Bei der Logik ist sein Bestreben,

möglichst Axiome und Grundregeln durch Definitionen zu ersetzen. Die Art dieser
Betrachtung finden Sie z. B. in der Abhandlung „Functional Logic without Axioms
or Primitive Rules of Inference“ ⟨Popper, 1947d⟩[. . .].⟨Fußnote: Die hier
ausgeführte Zurückführung von Axiomen auf Definitionen ist freilich insofern mehr
scheinbar, als die Definitionen keine eigentlich expliziten Definitionen sind. Im
Abschnitt VIII der genannten Abhandlung bemerkt auch Popper selbst, dass man zur
Anwendung seines Systems auf eine Objektsprache zu den Definitionen noch
entsprechende Existenzaxiome hinzufügen muss.⟩In dieser ist auch eine frühere
Publikation angegeben. Mit der Axiomatik hat sich Popper speziell für die
Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie abgegeben, für die er verschiedene Axiomensysteme
aufgestellt hat, wobei er unter anderem drauf abzielte, ohne die Voraussetzung
auszukommen, dass die der Wahrscheinlichkeit unterworfenen Gegenstände einer
Boole’schen Algebra genügen, während er andererseits die Theorie der reellen
Zahlen voraussetzt. Sie finden dies z. B. im Appendix der Abhandlung „The
Propensity Interpretation of Probability“ ⟨Popper, 1959c⟩[. . .]. Eine etwas frühere
Abhandlung von Popper über Axiomatisierung der Wahrscheinlichkeitsrechnung ist
im gleichen Journal (⟨Popper, 1955c)⟩) erschienen. – Kürzlich hat Popper auch eine
Abhandlung über ein Axiomensystem der Geometrie publiziert, welches eine

Dear Mr. Gödel,
Many thanks for your letter of 12 January.
[. . .]
You inquired whether Karl Popper has contributed anything essential to the
clarification of the foundations of mathematics. In any case, he has studied questions
of logic and axiomatics in greater depth. In logic he has striven to replace axioms
and primitive rules by definitions. You find this sort of consideration, e.g., in the
paper “Functional Logic without Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference” ⟨Popper,
1947d⟩[. . .].⟨Footnote: The reduction of axioms to definitions carried out here is, to
be sure, more apparent, insofar as the definitions are not really explicit definitions. In
chapter VIII of the aforementioned paper even Popper himself remarks that in the
application of his system to an object language corresponding existence axioms still
have to be added to the definitions.⟩In this an earlier publication is also mentioned.
As far as axiomatics is concerned, Popper has dealt in particular with probability
theory, for which he has set up various axiom systems with which, among other
things, he aimed to get along without the assumption that the objects subject to
probability constitute a Boolean algebra, while, on the other hand, he assumes the

theory of real numbers. You find this, e.g., in the appendix of the paper “The
Propensity Interpretation of Probability” ⟨Popper, 1959c⟩[. . .]. A somewhat earlier
paper by Popper on the axiomatization of probability theory appeared in the same
journal (⟨Popper, 1955c⟩). Recently Popper has also published a paper on an axiom
system for geometry, which is an improvement of an axiom system of a Mr. Roehle.n

Popper’s Correspondence with Luitzen Egbertus
Jan Brouwer
Karl R. Popper and Luitzen E. J. Brouwer
Abstract Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer(1881–1966) was a Dutchmathematician well-
known for his work in topology and his philosophy and development of “intuitionism”
as a novel form of constructive mathematics. (Forfurtherinformation on Brouwer’s life
and work cf. the biography by van Dalen, 2012.) Brouwer presented Popper’s papers
“On the Theory of Deduction I, II” (Popper, 1948a,c) and “Functional Logic without
Axioms or Primitive Rules of Inference” (Popper, 1947d) to the Royal Netherlands
Academy of Sciences. They are reproduced in Chapters 4, 5 and 6 of this volume.
In these papers Popper proves the non-definability of various negations weaker than
intuitionistic negation. Brouwer reacts very positively to Popper’s articles on logic,
in particular to his duality constructions and his novel definition of intuitionistic
negation. His high estimation of Popper’s work on logic also shows in a letter that
Brouwer wrote to Harold Jeffreys on the occasion of Popper’s application for an
academic post.
Editorial notes: The letters from Brouwer to Popper are from KPS Box 280, Folder 8. The letter
from Popper to Brouwer is from KPS Box 37, Folder 11. Each letter exists as a handwritten draft
and as a typescript. The letters from and to Jeffreys are quoted from van Dalen (2011). They can be
found in the Brouwer archive at the Philosophy Department of Utrecht University.

Thank you very much for your sending Hayek’s beautiful booka to me. I think that
a wonderfully free spirit must be abroad in your surroundings to allow the
germination ⟨of⟩such works. My next stay in England will last the greater part of
October. So I am looking forward to seeing you again within a few weeks. By this
same post I send you a reprint bearing upon one of our subjects of conversation in
July.
Yours very truly

Today your paper is presented to the Academy in Amsterdam. The Lost Property
Office answered that it regrets that its inquiry had no success. Next Thursday I shall
be again in London. Probably I shall look in at Houghton street at 1 o’ clock to see if
I can have lunch with you there. I hope that you are all right.

Dear Professor Brouwer,
I hope you are not disgusted by the sight of a new MS from me. If you think it too
much to communicate two papers by my humble self in such quick succession, then,
please, don’t do it, and let me have the MS back as soon as possible.
The present paper is, if I may say so, the most interesting I have so far written, and
mainly devoted to an analysis of intuitionist negation. Among the results are: The
superiority of Heyting’s calculus over Johansson’s (and Kolmogoroff’s) is established
on purely formal grounds, by proving that Johansson’s negation is not definable
(because not sufficiently characterized) while Heyting’s is definable. Another result
is the one mentioned in my last letter to you. A third result is that it is possible to
construct a negation (and, indeed, a whole calculus) which is a dual of Heyting’s; in
this calculus, the negation of 𝑎can be interpreted as “𝑎is not necessary (or
uncertain)”, which turns out to be a dual of “𝑎is impossible”. In the dual calculus,
the law of the excluded middle is valid, that of contradiction is not. I do not think that
this dual calculus is in itself very important, but its existence may remove certain
misgivings about the lack of symmetry in the logic of intuitionism. For it now turns
out that there is a formal symmetry, and that it is merely the comparative irrelevance
of the dual kind of negation for the problems of mathematical demonstration which
makes intuitionism emphasize impossibility (as opposed to non-necessity).
It is also proved, in my paper, that intuitionist negation and its dual can co-exist
without interference, and that a language may contain both without containing
classical negation.
The proofs themselves are all intuitionistically valid.
Of course, what I am saying here is nowhere stated in the paper; but it is implicit
in the proofs sketched in the paper.
For all these reasons, I very much hope that you may do me and the paper the
honour of communicating it, But if you feel that you should rather not, I shall
certainly not take it amiss.
If it is too long, it can easily be divided into two roughly equal parts, at the end of
section III (p. 9). In this case, the first three sections may be published under the title
“On the General Theory of Derivation” and the remaining sections under the |

title
“On the Definitions of Classical and Intuitionist Negation”.
I hope you are well. My cold ist still very bad – I am coughing incessantly.
With many thanks and the kindest regards,
Yours ever,

My dear Popper,
Your duality construction and your new definition of intuitionistic negation have
delighted me, and I have presented your last paper on November 29th. As you
foresaw, it was stated at the printing office, that your manuscript had to be split up on
account of its size. I received a copy of the proof sheet, which I sent back with an
indication of the two expanded titles you describe in your last letter. Please return
your own proof sheet with the same indication. In my opinion the impression of your
paper wins by this division. – I am travelling to Cambridge, but have no time to stop
in London this time. Probably I shall leave Cambridge on the 15th (or 16th). I very
much hope to stay with you on my return journey, as was agreed upon. Please
remember me to Mrs. Popper.
Kindest regards

Prof. Dr. L. E. J. Brouwer

January 4, 1948
Dear Popper,
I enquired for your reprints. The matter is that all mathematical communications
to the Amsterdam Academy, after appearing in the proceedings, are published a
second time in the mathematical periodical “Indagationes Mathematicae”. It is only
after this second publication that the reprints are finished off and sent to the authors.
Your October reprints will be dispatched within a couple of weeks and, according to
your suggestion, in several separate parcels.
As to your November communication, your type /−(oblique) is lacking in the
printing office, but a type ⊢(upright) is available. Consequently the compositor begs
your permission to replace the former symbol by the latter. The compositor says that
the symbol /−occurs so often in your November manuscript, that it takes too much
time and pains, to manufacture it poorly and defectively by hand one by one in so
great number. With regard to your October paper there was no objection against the

22 Popper’s Correspondence with Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer
411
oblique symbol, because there you used it only a few times. The difference between
the oblique and the upright symbol seems very slight to me, so that I hope you can
comply with the compositor’s wishes.
So long! Remember me to your wife. Prosit 1948 to you both.
Kindest regards
Yours LEJ Brouwer

January 6, 1948
My dear Popper,
The following in addition and correction to my letter of January 4th:
One of these days you will receive, or perhaps you have already received, new
proof sheets of your November paper. In these sheets your symbol /−, remaining
oblique, has a still unsatisfactory and, moreover, inconstant form. In many places it is
not even connected. Nevertheless this is the utmost of adequacy the compositor can
attain for the oblique type. If you reject it, the only solution would be to change over
to the upright type. But this would probably take some time and delay the publication
of your paper by one month. So there would also be a ground to accept the
reproduction of your symbol in its present state.
Cordially yours

My dear Popper,
One of these days you will receive your new proof sheets with the upright symbol

make an insertion referring to the different shape of the symbol denoting the same
property in your preceding article 𝑃3b.

logicians of the present time, and one of the keenest thinkers in the philosophy of
both exact and humanist science.

Dear Brouwer,
I saw the Vice Chancellor yesterday and he said he would like a fuller statement
about Popper. Some of the other candidates have sent in several pages of particulars.
May I trouble you for some more after all? I am sorry to trouble you. The electors
will probably want to know approximate age, what posts he has been in, or principal
contributions to knowledge; and of course especially indications of how outstanding
the leading ones are. Perhaps 1 to 2 pages.
Looking forward to seeing you again on Sunday!
Yours sincerely

urgent telegram to the publisher

22.12 Brouwer to Jeffreys, 11 May 1948
Letter quoted from van Dalen (2011, p. 2381f.).
Dear Professor Jeffreys,
You asked for a more detailed exposition of Popper’s merits. I am sorry I have not
the data to give an elaborate testimonial.
Popper’s main contributions to knowledge lie in the following three fields:
(i) Philosophy of natural science, to which belongs his book “Logik der
Forschung” which appeared about 1935, and which is just now being
translated into English. It is not only synoptic and explanatory, but also in
some ways a practical manual for experimental scientists.
(ii) Moral, social and political science, to which belongs his book “The open
society and its enemies” (Vol.1: The spell of Plato; Vol.2: The high tide of
prophecy: Hegel and Marx) which appeared in 1944, and was recently
reprinted; further his series of articles on “the poverty of historicism” which
probably led to his appointment at the London School of Economics, and
several occasional small papers among which is a very remarkable one on
“Utopia and violence” which appeared in the Hibbert Journal of January 1948.
(iii) Mathematical logic, where Popper plays a prominent part in the complete
renewal this science is undergoing just now. In particular his papers on
derivation and negation which appeared about the end of 1947, I think will be
consulted and quoted during a generation.
You also asked for personal data of a formal character. To get these I rang up Popper
himself, and here they are:

My dear Popper,
Returning next Monday or Tuesday from a five weeks stay in Cambridge I should
like to pass one night in London, and if possible seize this possibility to see you.
Braithwaite told me that you have removed from East Barnet. I hope your new
dwelling is less outlying than the house you left, and is pleasant and comfortable.
In London I should like to put up at the hotel of the Society for visiting scientists,
where you took me one day to have lunch with Schrödinger. I should also like to
become a member of the Society, and stay in the same hotel during the first half of
May 1952, when I shall have to deliver the Shearman lectures.
But I have completely forgotten the address so that I venture to request you, kindly
to arrange this matter for me, i.e. to propose me as a member to the Society, to get me
a room in the hotel for next |
2
Monday or Tuesday, and to let me know the address and
the telephone number of the house, that I may announce day and hour of my arrival
in good time there.
Tomorrow I shall have dinner with Von Wright. I wonder whether again a
foreigner will be appointed as his successor here.
Thanking you in anticipation, sending hearty greetings to you and your wife,
awaiting your answer as soon as possible, and very much looking forward to seeing
you, I remain
Yours LEJ Brouwer

Popper’s Correspondence with Rudolf Carnap
Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
Abstract Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) was a German logician and philosopher, an
eminent member of the Vienna Circle and one of the main proponents of logical
empiricism. The correspondence reproduced here covers the time from 1942 to
1947, when Carnap worked at the University of Chicago and Popper at Canterbury
University College in Christchurch. During that time, Carnap published his books
Introduction to Semantics (Carnap, 1942) and Formalization of Logic (Carnap, 1943)
and sent copies to Popper in New Zealand. Popper’s reading of these books is the
starting point for their discussion on logic in this correspondence; Popper sends his
detailed notes, remarks and questions to Carnap. Popper later frequently refers to
Carnap’s work on logic in both his published and unpublished articles. One of his
criticisms of one of Carnap’s systems, in a footnote of Popper (1947c), ultimately
unjustified, is discussed in the last two letters reproduced here.
Editorial notes: The correspondence between Popper and Carnap is from KPS Box 282, Folder 24,
and from Princeton University. We omit some letters which are irrelevant for Popper’s works on
logic. These omitted letters are: Carnap to Popper, 9 February 1946; Popper to Carnap, 25 April
1946; Carnap to Popper, 17 November 1946; Popper to Carnap, 6 January 1947; Popper to Carnap, 1

Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
Let me first thank you very much indeed for both your booka and your letter. I got
the book with a three months delay, the letter took only 7 weeks. I have not replied
earlier because I wanted to be able to say something about the book, which meant
that I had to read it first; and since I was very busy, teaching as well as writing, I was
at first only able to glance at it. I finished a first more thorough reading only to-day;
so I may make perhaps some remarks on it now. But I must say at once that one
reading is, of course, quite insufficient and that I shall go back to it many times.
I shall make a few detailed remarks on a separate sheet. Here are some general
impressions.
First of all, may I say that the book appears to me by far the most comprehensive1
analysis in the field of general logic I know. Especially the analysis of the
correspondence between the Absolute concepts, the Semantic concepts (radical as
well as L and F) and the Syntactical C concepts is most important, and was in this
beautiful and simple form entirely new to me, in spite of the fact that I have been
teaching myself on lines closely similar to your § 13 (Logical and Descriptive Signs)
to § 16, using especially definitions like your D 16 E 1 and E 2, following Tarski’s
Folgerung. The way in which Lewis’ system appears (p. 93) as an absolute L-system
is most satisfactory. (In spite of that, I feel that the semantic and syntactic systems
are to be preferred, in practice, to the absolute systems. I cannot help feeling that the
absolute systems are not very valuable from the point of view of a logic of science;
and I therefore much prefer method 2 to method 1 in § 16; but all that may be due to
en extensional upbringing.) I am most keenly looking forward to vol. II, and to the
solution of the problem of symmetry you have promised, as well as to the new
analysis of the propositional calculus. Indeed, the remarks you make about vol. II are
more than thrilling. Many, many thanks again.
You ask me, in your letter, what I am doing. Apart from teaching and continuing
with probability (I have a few results here) as well as with confirmation, I have
concentrated mainly on practical problems of the methodology of the social sciences.
It is a war effort. One fruit of |
2
this is an article The Poverty of Historicism, which
will appear, I hope, in Mind. Another is a fairly voluminous book which I have just
finished. It is an attack on a kind of superstition introduced into the field of social
investigation by Plato and further developed by Hegel and Marx. I have written this
book because I believe that it contributes to the understanding of fascism and its
dangers and throws light on the present crisis. Its title isb
False Prophets
Plato — Hegel — Marx.
I am sending the book to some U.S.A. publishers, and I have given your name as a
reference, together with the name of G. E. Moore. Of course, I did not imply that you

a Carnap had planned to publish a five-volume series of Studies in Semantics, the first volume being
Carnap (1942), which is the book referred to here; in the following, “vol. II (of the Studies)” refers
to Carnap (1943).

knew the book or that you can say anything about its prospective value. All I said is
that you know me. I hope that I shall not cause you any inconvenience in referring to
you. I have worked on the book most intensively for three years.
Regarding probability, I have simplified my formal system, and I hope I shall find
time one of these days to write the thing out in a form in which it can be published. It
is very bad to have nobody to discuss these matters with.
Many thanks again and please be good enough to send me vol. II of the Studies
when it appears.

K. R. Popper
P.S. One of my difficulties here is that I cannot obtain the Journal of Unified Science.
My attempt to have it in our library failed. I am entirely out of touch since 1938! If
you have some back numbers, I would be most grateful. We get the Philosophy of
Science, but it has deteriorated deplorably.
The Journal for Symbolic Logic is also not available in Christchurch, but Prof.
Findlay gets it in Dunedin, and I can get from time to time a loan of it, which is of
course not entirely satisfactory. – I have given Findlay your greetings.
K. R. P.
⟨Separate sheet⟩
A few remarks on the Introduction to Semantics.
I believe that the most important problems discussed in the book are those of
§§ 16, 18–23, and 36.
§ 16. It is possible or even probable that the methods 1a, b may not work out
satisfactorily. The following appears prima facie as very likely: Just as in method 2,
L-truth and L-implication turn out to be correlative to the chosen interpretation of
the concept of “logical sign”, so in method 1a, they will turn out as correlative to the
choice of “logical necessary in 𝑀” (and in 2b, to “demonstrable in 𝑀”); i.e.: it seems
likely that method 1 will not overcome the fundamental vagueness of the method 2.
And it is therefore questionable whether we are not creating the problem ourselves,
and whether we should not simply say that “L-true” is correlative to the intended use
of certain signs, as descriptive or logical respectively; so that the real problem would
be, rather, to show precisely what use we would call logical or descriptive, and what
kind of terms may be affected by this vagueness, and in which way; and what kind of
difficulties may arise therefrom.
§ 23. I was most interested in your definition of “Content” as the complement of
“Range” (and the vice versa method); I have been using this method in my lectures,
introducing the term “anti-content” as an alternative for range. What are the
objections against defining Content (E-Content, empirical Content) of 𝑇𝑖as the class
of L states incompatible with 𝑇𝑖, or as the class of propositions (absolute)
L-incompatible with the designatum of 𝑇𝑖? Range (E-Range) could then be defined
as the complement of Content. This is what I intended to suggest in my Logik d.F.,
p. 67, 74, 77.

420
Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
(By the way: you mention on p. 151 Wittgenstein: “For the assertive power of a
sentence consists in its excluding certain states of affairs (Wittgenstein).” But I think
you had here not W. in mind, but my book, esp. the last lines of p. 67 and many other
passages. This, indeed, was just one of my fundamental ideas, and I do not think I got
it from W. I have searched the Tractatus, and I could not find anything like it.)
§ 24. I was most interested in the rules of refutation. (It just shows how one is
liable not to go far enough in analysing one’s implicit assumptions.)
§ 30. In order to bring out the relations between comprehensiveness |
2
and
inconsistency even more fully, one could define K as C-comprehensive if and only if
Λ 𝑐→𝑉.
We would then have:
T 1. Each of the following conditions is a sufficient and necessary condition for K
to be C-comprehensive:
a) All 𝑇𝑖in K are C-equivalent.
b) All 𝑇𝑖in K are C-comprehensive.
c) Λ is C-comprehensive.
T 2. If K is C-Comprehensive, then if it contains one 𝑇𝑖which is C-false in K, it is
C-inconsistent.
T 3. Every C-inconsistent K is C-comprehensive. Etc., etc.
(Remark: I did not know previous to the receipt of your book that you are using
the term “comprehensive”, and I have used therefore the term “embracing” instead,
in an unimportant Note which appears in the next number of Mindc.)
§ 36. Are you treating the relations between the problem of § 16 and § 36 in
vol. II?
There are many problems in connection with exhaustive calculi; we could, as it
were, convert the idea of exhaustion, and introduce the idea of “cover”: That part of S
which is exhausted or “covered” by a certain interpretation I of a K, as the I-K-realm
of S. We then could, for instance, speak of the realm of “that logic of S which is
formalized or ‘covered’ by a certain K” or of “that realm of the physics of S which is
formalized by a certain theory P”, etc.; and we may even obtain “absolute” concepts
indirectly referring to such a calculus. E.g. the realm of absolute L-implicates, as
“covered” by, or corresponding to, the calculus of propositions; or of F-implicates, as
covered by Physics. (The latter realm is particularly interesting. It could be used to
describe the realm of physical causal “links”.)
I am, of course, most interested in your announcement (p. 224) to treat the
problem of formalization in vol. II in detail.
I do not quite understand the remark on p. 224 “For certain semantical systems,
L-exhaustive calculi cannot be constructed without using transfinite rules.” Certainly;
but as it stands, this reads as if it were meant that for all other systems, calculi can be
constructed without such rules, and as if therefore for all semantical systems
L-exhaustive calculi could be constructed. But this cannot be meant, as far as I can
see (Goedel!).

Dear Dr. Popper,
Thank you for your letter of November 28th and the remarks on my “Semantics”. I
am glad to see that our views in questions of semantics are very much in agreement.
The printing of the second volume has been delayed. It will probably appear in
February. Then I shall send you a copy.
The Journal of Unified Science has not appeared for several years. Neurath is
trying to find a publisher for it in England (he is in Oxford), but so far without
success.
I am looking forward to the book you have written. I hope you will soon find a
publisher. If a publisher writes to me I shall be very glad to do what I can to help by
recommending it. I hope you are cautious in your criticism of Marx in order not to
furnish arguments to those who do not only differ with his views but also reject his
goal. A careful separation of what is right and what is wrong in his views is
necessary, such as you did in your article on “Dialectics”d, which I liked very much.
Perhaps this article or something similar is now a chapter of the book? If the book
has the same careful, objective, critical attitude then it will be very useful.
To your remarks on my book. § 16. At present, I prefer definitions of L-concepts
on the basis of L-range (§ 20), with rules of L-range instead of rules of truth. The
elements of L-ranges are state descriptions as in § 19E.
To § 23. There are no objections against the indicated definition of content. The
L-states incompatible with 𝑇𝑖are the same as the L-states which do not L-imply 𝑇𝑖.
Therefore your definition seems to me about the same as my D18-B3 and D23-B1.
I am very sorry that, by error of memory, I referred on p. 151 to Wittgenstein
instead of to you. I shall correct it at a suitable place in a later volume.
Strangely enough, I myself used the term “embracing” instead of “comprehensive”
in my MS. I changed it because Quine said that “embracing” was quite unsuitable.
Probably for peculiar connotations of the term in English.
To your last paragraph, about p. 224. Gödel’s result holds only for calculi with
finite rules. This fact is often overlooked. My language II in “Syntax”, together with
the definition of “analytic” taken as transfinite syntactical rules, is an L-exhaustive
calculus for a certain system of classical mathematics. I do not know any semantical
system for which no L-exhaustive calculus can be constructed.

I did a good deal of work during my present leave on modalities and on
probability, also on the principle of the uniformity of nature as a condition for
induction. (It seems to me that the task of finding a scientific formulation for this

Dear Professor Carnap,
Many thanks for your letter of January 29th. Since I wrote you last, I have further
read in your Introduction to Semantics, and with great interest. There is no doubt, the
progress made by logic during your life-time is immense, and you have a very full
share in it.
Concerning my remark to p. 224 which you rightly criticized: I knew of course
that Goedel’s results do not hold for “true” (inclusive L-true or analytic) but only for
“derivable” (in the narrow sense). My mistake was rather that I identified your term
“calculus” with “deductive system” in the ordinary narrow sense in which it contains
only finite rules of deduction. (I was, I now believe, mislead by the introductory note
to § 25, p. 155; and your remark on p. 160f. did not sink in. It was a first reading.)
⟨The rest of the letter concerns Carnap’s question regarding Popper’s criticism of
Marx and the publication problems of “The Open Society” (Popper, 1945a), then
still called “False Prophets: Plato, Hegel, Marx”.⟩
Many thanks and kindest regards.

Dear Professor Carnap,
I received the “Formalization of Logic” last week; very many thanks, I found it
most interesting, and even thrilling; and this in spite of the fact that the presentation
is not easy. The brief summaries at the beginning of each § are certainly a great help:
but the difficulty lies mainly in the fact that up to § 15, everything is more or less

23 Popper’s Correspondence with Rudolf Carnap
423
preparation. The problems treated in §§ 16–32 are intensely interesting and
important. I have been telling my students for some years that it appears that the
axioms (plus rule of deduction) of PC are a formalization of the truth-tables; but I
always had some misgivings, and sometimes I even voiced them in classes. But I had
not the slightest idea of how to tackle the problem; I could not even formulate it with
a sufficient degree of precision. Your simple concepts of normal and non-normal
interpretations do not only help to formulate the problem precisely, but also to
solve it.
One of the things which surprised me most (in spite of some warnings in vol. Ie)
was that conjunction and implication must always have a normal interpretation (in
any true interpretation) while this is not the case with negation and disjunction. I
must admit that when reading your vol. IIf, I suspected for a time that this situation
might be brought about by the peculiarities of the term “true interpretation” as
defined in vol. I; but I believe now that this is not the case, and that the root of the
matter is indeed the lack of formalization as pointed out by you. (I believe, however,
that a brief discussion of this question might have been helpful in § 16; i.e. of the
question how much depends on the adoption of your term “true interpretation” as
basis for the discussion.)
The thing that is most puzzling is undoubtedly this. In §§ 26 ff. you define a
calculus which is, in a certain sense, logically stronger than PC. But it is not richer in
theorems. The idea that any “addition” to, or “strengthening” of the calculus must
lead to additional theorems is, of course, shown by you to be an unwarranted
prejudice. It is this deep-rooted prejudice which has led us all to believe that, since
the PC is complete regarding theorems, it is impossible to strengthen it further. But
at the end of § 27, one feels the need of an explicit discussion of this problem; for
some puzzle remains. What is needed is perhaps a more detailed comparison of the
various senses of “completeness” than the one on p. 99.
I was also very thrilled by the sheer beauty, simplicity, and novelty (at least for
me) of the method of involution. In a way, I feel that you might have emphasized this
method more strongly. As T 23-1 shows, involution can be considered a
generalization (extension to sentential classes) of the idea of an implication between
sentences, and it can be so considered with exactly the same right as the implication
between sentential classes. And it is even a “weaker” generalization, in so far as from
“𝑇𝑖implies 𝑇𝑗” “𝑇𝑖involves 𝑇𝑗” can be deduced, but not vice versa. |
2
(“𝑇𝑖involves 𝑇𝑗”
does not even L-involve “𝑇𝑖implies 𝑇𝑗”) In spite of this logical weakness, involution
turns out, in your treatment, to be in a way more fundamental, in so far as you
achieve with involution without junctives as much as with implication plus junctives.
It is really a surprisingly neat and elegant method. (But I realize that elegance is a
secondary problem.)
Many interesting questions are raised; an obvious question, for example, is this:
can the application of your method influence any of the decision problems? And can
your method be successfully applied to such “complete” fractions of the PC as, for
e Carnap (1942).
f Carnap (1943).

424
Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
instance, the “positive logic”, including ((𝑝⊃𝑞) ⊃𝑝) ⊃𝑝, or the “positive
identical implication formulae” (the latter as indicated in Hilbert Bernays Ig p. 69)?
If we take, (instead of your table on p. 9) the axioms of the “positive logic”
(a) 𝑝⊃(𝑞⊃𝑝); ((𝑝⊃𝑞) ⊃𝑝) ⊃𝑝; (𝑝⊃𝑞) ⊃((𝑞⊃𝑟) ⊃(𝑝⊃𝑟)); see H-B,
p. 70
(b) in addition H-B, p. 66, II & IV, leaving the dangerous disjunction aside: does
such a weak system permit non-normal interpretations of implication and
conjunction? And does the system (a) alone permit non-normal interpretations of
implication? And what happens if either H-B p. 66, III (disjunction) or V (negation)
is added, to the exclusion of the other of these two?
Some of these problems seem to be quite simple, thanks to your method; but I had
no time so far to think about it, and there are some points which puzzle me. For
example it is clear that such a positive logic can be strengthened by your rule of
refutation (vol. II, 102), and then, according to your T20-1, C-falsity and L-falsity
will coincide, while they obviously did not coincide before; for it is possible to give
at least two L-true interpretations of the “positive Logic” such that (1) every sentence
is translated into an L-true one, or (2) every C-true sentence is translated into an
L-true one and all others into true ones. However, as far as I can see, these
interpretations would not be non-normal in your sense. This seems at first sight to
suggest that even the absence of non-normal interpretations does not guarantee full
formalization: Where is my mistake? I see, of course, that this argument depends
partly upon the use of propositional variables, in so far, namely, as there are simply
no L-false sentences in this “positive Logic” if we use axiom schematas (or proceed
as you do in vol. II, D2-2) instead of propositional variables; and if propositional
variables are discarded (as your method of interpretation demands), then my problem
seems to disappear. I suppose that this is all about it; but I am not yet quite sure.
The book is so obviously important that it must, I am convinced, dispel such
misunderstandings as that of Langford in his review of vol. I in the Journal of
Symbolic Logich (which I just received). I was amazed, and even dismayed about
this review. It does not touch any of the fundamental issues opened up in vol. I, such
as for example the problem which is pending between you and Tarski (and Bernays)
whether the distinction between analytic (or L-true and L-false) and synthetic (or
F-true and F-false) is a workable and unambiguously applicable one.
In regard to this problem, I believe with you (vol. I, p. vii) that we need this term
in the methodology of science, and that such problems as empiricism cannot be
discussed without it. On the other hand, I understand Tarski’s scepticism. I may say
that I have some ideas which might |
3
reconcile both of you. –
I just mentioned the Journal of Symb. Logic: Oppenheim has been so very kind as
to subscribe it for me for a year. Let me thank you very much for having interested
yourself in this matter. (In fact, we are so poor that we have not been able to buy a
single book for some years; but this is an unimportant point in these days, and I am
really a little embarrassed by Oppenheim’s generosity.)

23 Popper’s Correspondence with Rudolf Carnap

To come back to Langford’s review: I feel sure that he will see the mistake he has
made as soon as he reads vol. II. On the other hand, I must say that you have not
made it too easy for your readers to find their way through vol. I, and the title
“Introduction” may lead to misapprehensions. The real difficulty seems to be that you
have perhaps not placed your vol. I with sufficient clarity within a certain historical
problem-situation. This is, implicitly, achieved by vol. II.
I am afraid, I have written a long letter. From us, there is nothing new to report. I
have an extensive as well as exhaustive lecturing programme. I have courses in
Logic; Ethics (two courses); History of Philosophy; Introduction to Philosophy;
Political Philosophy; and I have, besides, a W.E.A. course under the title “Philosophy
of Nature and Society”, and a course for research workers on Scientific Methods
(with discussion of their practical research problems, which have led to considerable
practical results; a kind of poli-clinical advisery agency for agricultural chemists,
etc.). This course (which has just ended) was very interesting and successful. It is
comforting to find that philosophy can be of some practical use! My hatred against
the empty verbalism and scholasticism of the vast majority of philosophical writings
is increasing proportionally with the time I have to devote to the teaching of such
matters (of course, I try to do my best in my lectures to expose them), and it
sometimes reaches a state of acute nausea. On the other hand, I more and more
appreciate the one incomparable writer of our time: Russell. (I exclude, of course, his
⟨I⟩nquiry into Meaning and Truthi and a few minor efforts of his.) He is free from
the bumptiousness and pretentiousness of the vast majority of philosophers.
I have not heard a word about my book since I wrote you last – in spite of cables
etc. It is disconcerting.

This is merely a note to tell you that Kegan Paul-Routledges are printing my book
in two volumes; the first of which they intend to publish in October, the second in
February. Its title will be “The Open Society and Its Enemies” (or perhaps “and Its
Antagonists”).
A lengthy article – a kind of continuation of my Dialectic-article – is being
published in Economica;k the first part came out in the May number, the second part
is more interesting. I have no reprints so far.
I have written a number of papers on such technical problems as postulate systems

Dear Professor Carnap,
Many thanks for your letter of Dec. 9th, 1944. First about your suggestion
concerning the Guggenheim fellowship: if there is any possibility I should of course
like to apply. I have heard the name “Guggenheim fellow” before, but I have never
taken any notice of it. I should be extremely glad to get anything of this kind, and I
should be most grateful if you could tell me how and where to apply; also, if you
would tell me of any other such possibility, if one occurs to you. I remember that the
Carnegie people were once interested in me (during the Copenhagen Congress) but I
never applied for any such thing.
I am particularly grateful for your kind offer that you would write a testimonial “in
the highest terms of appraisal” for me, and if you would send me one soon, it may be
of great help to me. You may have heard that Findlay resigned his chair here (or

rather in Dunedin) in order to accept a chair in South Africa (Rhodes Univ. College,
Grahamstown) and he considered that there may be some chance for me to succeed
him; at least, he has done his very best to further my chances, and he has written me
an extremely nice testimonial (of which I enclose a copy). A new testimonial from
you may help very considerably. The matter of Findlay’s vacated chair (the salary is
about the same as the sum mentioned by you as the Guggenheim fellowship) may
become urgent at any moment. May I ask you if you could send me the new
testimonial by air mail? I enclose, apart from Findlay’s testimonial another
testimonial from here (from Professor Hight, formerly Rector of Canterbury
University College) which may give you some idea of my activities here, and your
old testimonial, since you may perhaps wish to use it when writing the new one.
I was very glad to hear that your back is much better. I am most anxious to see
your papers on probability, and I shall certainly send you a full comment on them,
especially since you say that my comments on your “Formalization” were valuable to
you.
You mention Tarski’s and Quine’s views on probability and that they diverge from
your view that the L-concepts are indispensible in this field. I am sorry to say that I
have never heard or seen Tarski’s or Quine’s views on this matter. (I know only one
publication of Tarski’s in which he deals with probability – an old criticism of
Reichenbach in Erkenntnis V, 174ff.)
I have some unpublished papers on probability, but they are too long for
publication and need some work before they can be used.
My book whose final title is “The Open Society and Its Enemies” seems to be set
up. (I have not got any proofs: they are being read in England) but I cannot find out
when it will be published. This is depressing: the distance makes me rather helpless.
I have, of course, asked the publisher to send you a copy upon publication.
Kindest regards to you and your wife from both of us,

Dear Dr. Popper
Thank you for your letter of February 11. I am sending you herewith a new
testimonial. Since it contains parts of the old one, do not use it in addition to the old
one, but instead of it. I hope very much that you would succeed in obtaining

428
Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
Findlay’s vacated chair. Did your new book not yet appear? If I had seen it, I could
have referred to it in the testimonial more in detail.
The Guggenheim Foundation wrote to me on my inquiry that their fellowships are
available only to people who live in America. I regret this very much because you
would have there a very good chance. If you could perhaps come to this country by
other means (e.g. by a Rockefeller Fellowship, or by whatever means Findlay used to
come here), then you could here apply for a Guggenheim Fellowship; they require
only residence here, not citizenship.
I did not mean Tarski’s and Quine’s views on probability, but on the importance
of L-concepts in general. I was referring to your remarks of July 5, 1943, pp. 2–3 that
you had an idea how to “reconcile” Tarski’s and my views in this point. That would
interest me very much.
My papers on probability will appear soon, and then I shall send you reprints. My
book on probability is progressing only very slowly, but I hope to work more on it
during the summer.
My back is very much improved. I am walking around without cane and have no
difficulties in giving my lectures.
The news from Vienna are very interesting, but so far rather scarce. Would you
ever consider any plans for returning there, if a position were offered to you?
With best regards, to both of you from both of us,

Very many thanks for your kind air letter of May 30th which I got on June 20th,
and for the improved version of your testimonial. My book is not yet out, although
the publisher’s agreement provided for a publication not later than the middle of
April. This is the reason why you have not yet got a copy, for I advised the publishers
a year ago to send you one upon publication.
I could not use your testimonial for my application for Findlay’s chair since
applications closed in Dunedin on May 1st and in London (for the same job) on June
1st. But this matter of Findlay’s chair is no longer of importance for me, for I am
going to London: as I wrote in a surface-mail letter posted early in June, I have been
offered a readership in Logic and Scientific Method, tenable at the London School of
Economics, and I have, of course, accepted. I am very happy about this development.

Oct. 9, 1947
Dear Popper,
My best thanks for your letter of August & your kind judgement on my book.
I just read your “New Found.” in “Mind”. It is very interesting & contains a
number of new & important results. It is an essential improvement in comparison
with my previous attempts of defining the connection in terms of “consequence”
(first in “Syntax” § 57, & later in “Formalization”). Among other things, your clear &
simple analysis of the three kinds of negation is very valuable.
Your discussion on pp. 232f. is, unfortunately, so short that I am unable to
understand it. I should like to understand it, especially since it is the basis of your
objections against my rules. You say that the last formula on p. 232 leads to that on
top of p. 233. How |
2
does it? Is the restriction 𝑎`𝑥in the former but not in the latter no
impediment? Further, you say that 𝑎//𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
 violates PF2. How does it? (I say that it
violates your interpretation.) This is only a question, not an objection; I assume that
your assertions concerning your system are correct.
However, I doubt very much whether your assertions (in the footnotes p. 232) of
the non-validity of my rules 10 & 11 in D28-2 are correct. Note that rule 11, because
of its restriction, does not lead to a proof of “𝑃𝑥⊃(𝑥)(𝑃𝑥)” (which would indeed be
wrong), although “(𝑥)(𝑃𝑥)” is derivable from “𝑃𝑥”, in distinction to your system.
You have probably made the mistake of inadvertently transforming the interpretation
& the rules of your system to mine (+ Hilbert’s, etc.) Perhaps you have overlooked
the following essential distinction. In my system (& Hilbert’s, etc. but perhaps not in
Princ. Math., & certainly not in your system), “𝑃𝑥” (as a separate formula) |
3
is
interpreted (see, e.g., “Syntax”, p. 22, par. 2) as meaning the same as “𝑃𝑦” & as
“(𝑥)(𝑃𝑥)”. Therefore my rules are valid, if you doubt it, please give a
counter-example, by using only my rules, not yours.
Feigl & Hempel (& his new wife) were here for a few weeks, & we had a very
nice time together, with many interesting discussions, mostly on inductive logic.

23.11 Popper to Carnap, 24 November 1947
Typescript, 2p.
November 24th, 1947.
Dear Carnap,
I am sending you to-day an offprint of my “Logic without Assumptions”, referred
to in my “New Foundations” (note 1 on p. 203). Two more papers are on the way; I
have been promised the offprints of one of them for next week, and I shall send you a
copy at once.
I am overworked (8 hours lecturing a week is too much if one does research – I
wish I could get some time off for research, but I don’t know how), and really quite
exhausted.
You asked me in your last letter for a fuller explanation of my pp. 232f. (of my
“New Foundations”). I suppose that it is the misprint on p. 233 (“PF2” should
properly read “PF4”) which created the difficulty, and that you will have found
meanwhile what I meant. Still, here is a fuller explanation.
My contention is this.
Your statement (Formalization, p. 136) “that there exists a one-one correlation
between the individuals and the natural numbers” indicates that it is your intention to
construct a calculus which is consistent with my (much weaker) postulate PF4, i.e.,
with the demand that there exists more than one individual.
But with the assumption that there exists more than one individual, each of the
following rules of your Formalization contradict:
C10 (i.e., D28-2, rule 10, on p. 137)
C11 (i.e., D28-2, rule 11, on p. 138)
C12 (i.e., D28-2, rule 12, on p. 138)
Cb
(i.e., T28-4, case b, on p. 139).
For the proof of this contention, I shall make use of my own formalism. But the
proof holds for your formalism as well; for your C-implication satisfies, on the basis
of your Introduction, p. 64, P14-5; P14-8; and P14-11, all the rules which define my
“. . . /. . .”, i.e., the rules which I shall call “generalized reflexivity principle” and
“generalized transitivity principle”. To the latter, I shall refer as “Tg”.
I shall also refer to the following principles (“𝑎𝑘” is the classical negation of 𝑎):
𝑎/𝑏→⊢𝑎> 𝑏
(1.1)
𝑎/𝑏→(⊢𝑎→⊢𝑏)

(C10.4)
Now we take “𝑎” to be the name of an open statement (such as “𝑥+ 1 = 𝑦”) which
is satisfiable but not universally true. We obtain
⊢“𝑦+ 1 ≠𝑦” →⊢“𝑥+ 1 ≠𝑦”
(C10.4)
(C10.5)
and, substituting further “𝑥+ 1” for “𝑦” (we may confine this to the right hand side,
but I shall do it throughout) we obtain
⊢“(𝑥+ 1) + 1 ≠𝑥+ 1” →⊢“𝑥+ 1 ≠𝑥+ 1”
(C10.5)
(C10.6)
If there exists only one individual, then every statement of the form “. . . ≠—” is
false, and C10.6 is innocuous. But if there are more individuals than one, C10.6
gives rise to
“𝑥+ 1 ≠𝑥+ 1”
(C10.7)
which is contradictory.
I now proceed to C11. This may be written:
𝑎∨𝑏/𝑎∨𝐴𝑥𝑏, provided 𝑥is not free in 𝑎.
(C11)
We obtain, substituting “𝐴𝑥𝑐∧(𝐴𝑥𝑐)𝑘” for “𝑎”:
(𝐴𝑥𝑐∧(𝐴𝑥𝑐)𝑘) ∨𝑏/(𝐴𝑥𝑐∧(𝐴𝑥𝑐)𝑘) ∨𝐴𝑥𝑏
(C11)
(C11.1)
𝑏/𝐴𝑥𝑏
(C11.1;1.4;Tg.)
(C11.2)
⊢𝑏> 𝐴𝑥𝑏
(C11.2;1.1)
(C11.3)

Karl R. Popper and Rudolf Carnap
⊢(𝐴𝑥𝑏)𝑘> 𝑏𝑘
(C11.3;1.3)
(C11.4)
⊢(𝐴𝑥(𝑎𝑘))𝑘> (𝑎𝑘)𝑘
(C11.4)
(C11.5)
(𝐴𝑥(𝑎𝑘))𝑘/𝑎𝑘𝑘

(C11.6)
𝐸𝑥𝑎/𝑎
(C11.6;1.5;1.6;Tg.)
(C11.7)
𝐸𝑥𝑎/𝐴𝑥𝑎
(C11.7;C11.2;Tg.)
(C11.8)
But C11.8 is, clearly, satisfied only if there is not more than one individual.
I proceed to rule C12. This may be written
𝑎𝑘∨𝑏/(𝐸𝑥𝑎)𝑘∨𝑏, provided 𝑥is not free in 𝑏.
(C12)
Substituting “𝐴𝑥𝑐∧(𝐴𝑥𝑐)𝑘” for “𝑏” (as before under C11), we obtain: |

𝑎𝑘/(𝐸𝑥𝑎)𝑘
(C12)
(C12.1)
𝑏𝑘𝑘/(𝐸𝑥(𝑏𝑘))𝑘
(C12.1)
(C12.2)
𝑏/𝐴𝑥𝑏
(C12.2;1.5;1.6;Tg.)
(C12.3)
But C12.3 is the same as C11.2, and has the same fatal consequences.
Rule Cb, of course, is also the same as C11.2 and C12.3.
The result of all this is:
(1) Rule Cb can be dropped altogether.
(2) The rules of derivation C10; C11; and C12 must be replaced by the
corresponding conditional rules of proof, C′10’; C′11; C′12:
⊢𝑎→⊢𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
, provided 𝑦is not bound in 𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
.
(C′10)
⊢𝑎∨𝑏→⊢𝑎∨𝐴𝑥𝑏, provided 𝑥is not free in 𝑎.
(C′11)
⊢𝑎𝑘∨𝑏→⊢(𝐸𝑥𝑎)𝑘∨𝑏, provided 𝑥is not free in 𝑏.
(C′12)
The last two rules may be replaced by C′′11 and C′′12:
𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝑏→𝑎 𝑥
𝑦
/𝐴𝑥𝑏, provided 𝑥≠𝑦
(C′′11)
𝑎/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝐸𝑥𝑎/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
, provided 𝑥≠𝑦.
(C′′12)
These two rules, in turn, can be replaced by:
𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝑏 𝑥
𝑦
 →𝑎 𝑦
𝑥
/𝐴𝑥𝑏 𝑦
𝑥


Popper’s Correspondence with Alonzo Church
Karl R. Popper and Alonzo Church
Abstract Alonzo Church (1903–1995) was an American logician and mathematician,
well-known for his contributions to the theory of computability. He co-founded the
Journal of Symbolic Logic and served as editor for reviews for its first forty-four
volumes (cf. Enderton, 1995). Popper writes to him in this capacity in order to have
his articles reviewed; he had hoped that Church would review his articles himself, but
Church had to decline this suggestion and gave the reviews to Kleene and McKinsey
instead (cf. this volume, § 13.12, § 13.13 and § 13.14). Apart from helping to fix the
dates of the publication and dissemination of Popper’s articles, the correspondence
also contains a small addendum to “On the Theory of Deduction I” (Popper, 1948a,
Chapter 5 of this volume).

your paper in Mind. The promised reprint of the paper itself has not yet arrived, but
will no doubt be along in due course.
I appreciate very much your sending us this reprint and your promise to send us
reprints of your further papers in this same direction (in the Proceedings of the
Aristotelian Society and elsewhere).

These are papers for which I am especially anxious to find a competent reviewer,
and your sending reprints is very helpful because it makes possible a wider choice of
possible reviewers. I would like to take the opportunity to make the request that you
will send us reprints for review of all your future papers which come within our field.
I am at present taking a year’s leave of absence for the purpose of writing a book
on mathematical logic, and have rather definitely promised to devote all my time to
this from now until next September. In fact, I have as far as possible turned over all
the work in connection with the Journal ⟨of Symbolic Logic⟩to assistants, and I am
trying to give up all writing of reviews myself, except possibly for occasional minor
papers which can be quickly and briefly reviewed. For this reason I probably cannot
follow the suggestion to review your paper in Mind myself. If I find later that I have
any sort of comment on it, I will, however, write you about it.
With many thanks, I remain
Very sincerely yours,

Dear Professor Church,
I am sending you one off-print and two proofs. All three papers have been
published, but it takes a long time nowadays before one gets off-prints. The off-prints
of the paper “Functional Logic without Axioms” etc. were promised me in November
and I got them in February! (The paper was communicated by Brouwer in October.)
I should be glad if you could forward them to the reviewer (provided you have still
no time to review these papers yourself, I have not given up all hope). I should be
very glad if I could have the proofs back, later, after the off-prints of the two later
papers have reached the reviewer: I shall send off-prints as soon as I get them.
Many thanks for your very interesting papers. I was thrilled with them.
Sincerely yours,

Popper’s Correspondence with Kalman Joseph
Cohen
Karl R. Popper and Kalman J. Cohen
Abstract Kalman Joseph Cohen (1931–2010) was an American economist. Before
his Ph.D. in economics at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (cf. Reed Magazine,
2011), he completed a B.Litt. in mathematical logic at Oxford University, which was
supervised by Popper. In Cohen (1953b) he investigates various deductive systems, in
particular sequent calculi, for logics which are dual to intuitionistic logic. Although
a precursor to more modern treatments of dual-intuitionistic logics, it has not been
recognized or discussed much in the literature (cf. Kapsner, Miller, and Dyckhoff,
2014, and this volume, Chapter 1, § 2). The correspondence is notable for Popper’s
semantic explanation of dual consequence, that is, of 𝑎/(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚). Popper writes
that he intends to publish on this subject, which shows that as late as 1953 he was
still working on these topics.
Editorial notes: The correspondence with Cohen is contained in KPS Box 285, Folder 6. We
have omitted one undated short note by Cohen, which announces a future letter with more detailed
remarks on some unspecified suggestions by Popper.

than I did on my last visit. There is not very much choice in when I come and go,
since there is bus or coach service from Oxford to High Wycombe only every two
hours. I would like to come Friday on the coach which gets to High Wycombe at 1.14
p.m., which means hat I would get to your house by 2.0 p.m. Then I would have to
return on the coach which leaves High Wycombe at 5.39 p.m. Would you please
write to me and let me know if these times would fit in with your plans?
I am reading your article “On the Theory of Deduction I and II” of which you
gave me a reprint. I shall try also to read the other three articles of yours referred to
therein, before I see you on Friday. There are some questions which come to my
mind from reading your article.
It would be most helpful if before Friday you could read the article by Jan
Łukasiewicz, “On the Intuitionistic Theory of Deduction,” Proceedings Koninklĳke
Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, Series A, vol. 55 (1952), pp. 202–212. I
am quite sure that Łukasiewicz’s result is not the same as Gödel’s old discovery, and
that it is not something trivial, but that it is of profound significance.a

Dear Professor Popper,
I am very sorry to learn that you have come down with pneumonia. You say that
you are already recovering. I hope that it is a rapid and permanent recovery you are
making.
Unless I hear that you shall still not be well enough, I shall come to your house to
see you on Friday, February 27th. I shall come on the coach which gets to High
Wycombe at 1.14 p.m., and proceed to your home by local bus. It is necessary that I
return to Oxford on the coach which leaves High Wycombe at 5.39 p.m.
I have completed, in rough form, the proof that classical restricted predicate
calculus and number theory are proper subparts of intuitionistic restricted predicate
calculus and number theory. Gödel has shown that this is true for a weakened
interpretation of classical logic and number theory, but that is very different from
showing this for classical logic and number theory in its original, uninterpreted form.
If I can complete it in time, I shall send you a complete copy of the proof I’ve
a Cohen published the paper Cohen (1953a) on this observation, which was communicated by
Brouwer.

Dear Professor Popper,
Sorry to hear that your illness is continuing. I hope that you soon will be better,
and completely recovered. Would you please let me know if it will be somewhat
convenient for me to come see you at your home on Friday, March 6th. If I come on
Friday, I would arrive at the previously arranged time: arriving in High Wycombe at
1.14 p.m., and then I must leave High Wycombe on the 5.39 coach.
It may not be possible for me to send you in advance my proof that classical
restricted predicate calculus is a subpart of intuitionistic restricted predicate calculus
and that classical number theory is a subpart of intuitionistic number theory. This
proof is based on Łukasiewicz’s result for propositional calculus, and it is an
extension of his method. There have been several other things that I have had to do
during the past week, so that I have been unable to rewrite this proof in presentable
form as yet.
If I can’t send this to you in advance, it can wait for us to discuss it at our next
meeting, which will be, I hope, on Friday.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Professor Popper,

442
Karl R. Popper and Kalman J. Cohen
Since I last wrote to you, I have been developing a formal system of the restricted
predicate calculus, named the “dualintuitionistic” restricted predicate calculus, which
is precisely dual to the intuitionistic restricted predicate calculus. This system of
logic embodies the properties of the “m-negation” which you introduced in your
paper “On the theory of Deduction” which appeared in vol. 51 (1948) of Proc. Kon.
Ned. Akad. v. Wet. It has been necessary for me to introduce the anticonditional as a
primitive functor into the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate calculus, since I find
that it cannot be defined in terms of the remaining logical functors which I employ. I
have found it most convenient to introduce the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate
calculus by means of Gentzen-type inferential systems; later I hope to find a
Hilbert-type postulational system for the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate
calculus. I have been able to prove Gentzen’s Hauptsatz (called by Kleene the
“normal form theorem” and called by Curry the “elimination theorem”) for my
dualintuitionistic systems; hence I have established a decision procedure for the
dualintuitionistic propositional calculus.
Although you briefly discuss the anticonditional in your above-mentioned paper, I
have the impression that this is not the first appearance in the literature of logic. If
you could tell me any references to the anticonditional which you know of, you could
save me some time and trouble.
Have you had an opportunity yet to read the paper which I sent to you two and
one-half weeks ago? If you would like me to come to see you at your home, I could
manage to come on any day next week between 12th May and 18th May inclusive. If
you do prefer to have me come to see you, rather than your writing to me, please let
me know on which of these days it would be most convenient for my coming to your
home.
Yours sincerely,
Kalman Joseph Cohen
25.5 Cohen to Popper, 26 May 1953
Typescript with handwritten postscript, 2p.
The Queen’s College. Oxford.
Professor K. R. Popper,
Fallowfield, Manor Road, Penn, Bucks.
26th May 1953.
Dear Professor Popper,
At long last I have come to the realization that your system of derivational logic is
a distinct improvement over the traditional Hilbert-type formalizations of logic. I
have been utterly unsuccesful in all my attempts to devise a Hilbert-type
formalization of dualintuitionistic logic which will be equivalent to the Gentzen type
formalization of dualintuitionistic logic I have developed. I think that Hilbert-type
systems are useful only when we are concerned with whether or not certain logical

25 Popper’s Correspondence with Kalman Joseph Cohen
443
formulas are provable or demonstrable; they do not seem to be suitable when we are
interested in knowing whether or not a logical formula is refutable or directly false or
something similar.
In my thesis, I use the notation “Δ ⊩Θ” to represent what Gentzen calls a
“Sequenz” and what Kleene calls a “sequent,” where Δ and Θ are each finite
sequences of zero or more formulas. I’ve attempted to set-up Hilbert-type systems
equivalent to the Gentzen-type systems in the sense that whenever ⊩𝑝is provable in
the Gentzen-type system, then 𝑝is demonstrable in the corresponding Hilbert-type
system, and whenever 𝑞⊩is provable in the Gentzen-type system, then 𝑞is refutable
in the corresponding Hilbert-type system; and conversely. The best that I am able to
do is to devise Hilbert-type systems such that whenever ⊩𝑝is provable in the
Gentzen-type systems, then 𝑝is demonstrable in the corresponding Hilbert-type
system. The trouble with this is that the Hilbert-type formalizations of classical logic
and dualintuitionistic logic are the same, since the class of formulas demonstrable in
dualintuitionistic logic is the same as the class of formulas demonstrable in classical
logic.
In your paper “On the Theory of Deduction,” Proc. Kon. Ned. Akad. v. Wet.,
vol. 51 (1948),b you introduce relative demonstrability or relative refutability,
denoted by
(𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛) ⊩(𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚).
I do not think it should be difficult to show that this is the same concept as that
formalized in the sequents Δ ⊩Θ |
2
which occur in my Gentzen-type systems. In
order to find an interpretation for my Gentzen-type systems which will preserve the
distinctness between classical logic and dual-intuitionistic logic, I should like to
prove that: 𝑝1, . . . , 𝑝𝑚⊩𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑚is provable in my Gentzen-type systems, if and
only if, the formulas 𝑞1, . . . , 𝑞𝑛are complementary relative to the demonstrability of
all the statements 𝑝1, . . . , 𝑝𝑚(in your own terminology).
First I must obtain a concise formalization of your systems of derivational logic. I
shall try to do this myself, employing your idea of introducing the primitive constants
𝑡(truth) and 𝑓(falsehood) in order to eliminate the use of quantification in the
metalanguage. It would be helpful if you would send me reprints of the three papers
which you refer to as 𝑃1, 𝑃2 and 𝑃3c in the above-mentioned paper of yours. Would
you be good enough to do this, please? Do you have any more recent publications,
embodying the improvements in your systems of derivational logic, about which you
have spoken to me? If so, I would appreciate reprints or references to these also.
I do not fully understand how you operate with your “definitions” or
“characterizing rules” for the formative or logical signs. What precisely do you mean
by characterizing rules, and how are they operationally equivalent to definitions?
Your forms of definitions or characterizing rules do not seem to be equivalent to the
ordinary notion of definition, in which the definiens and definiendum are mutually
replaceable in any context. For example, on page 182 of the above-mentioned paper
of yours, you state that (3.81) is a characterizing rule for the conditional 𝑎> 𝑏. But

c Cf. Popper (1947c), Popper (1947b) and Popper (1947d), respectively.

444
Karl R. Popper and Kalman J. Cohen
how does (3.81) enable us to eliminate the occurence of 𝑎> 𝑏from the statement
𝑎, 𝑎> 𝑏, 𝑐⊢𝑑? To my mind, a proper definition of 𝑎> 𝑏should enable us to
eliminate the occurrence of 𝑎> 𝑏in the above statement. Similar difficulties occur
with all your definitions of the formative signs.
I have not spoken to Dr. Waismann or Professor Ryle about the possibility of
using my paper, “On the Relation Between the Classical Restricted Predicate
Calculus and the Intuitionistic Restricted Predicate Calculus” as an entire B.Litt.
thesis. I’ve decided to include as well my material on dualintuitionistic logic, which I
am trying to complete.
Yours sincerely,
K. J. Cohen
Could you please send the reprints as soon as you can conveniently manage?

Typescript, 2p.

Professor K. R. Popper,
Fallowfield, Manor Road, Penn, Bucks.
16th June 1953.
Dear Professor Popper,
Thank you very much for returning the signed applications to me so promptly.
The applications were handed in on time, and now it remains for me to hand in my
completed thesis on time.
I have just finished writing and revising the whole of my thesis. Still ahead of me
is the big job of typing the thesis in final form, with carbon copies. It should be bound
and handed in to the Lit. Hum. Faculty within a week, or ten days at the latest. Since
there is so little time, I am afraid that I have to begin right away to type the final copy.
My thesis will consist of two separate papers, On the Relation between the
Classical Restricted Predicate Calculus and the Intuitionistic Restricted Predicate
Calculus is the first paper, and The Dualintuitionistic Restricted Predicate Calculus
is the second paper. You have already seen the first paper. At your suggestion, I have
inserted some additional footnotes mentioning that some of the ideas were suggested
to me by you in conversation, and some additional terminological footnotes. However
I have not expanded this paper to include discussions of other possible translations
which reduce the classical systems to the corresponding intuitionistic systems, nor
have I proved that certain additional relations hold between the classical functors and
the intuitionistic functors. This would take a lot of additional time, which I do not
have at my disposal now.
Unfortunately you have not seen the whole of the second paper, which I have only
very recently completed. It has turned out to be fairly lengthy. Its most interesting
results are: (i) The class of formulas demonstrable in the dualintuitionistic

25 Popper’s Correspondence with Kalman Joseph Cohen
445
propositional calculus is identical with the class of formulas demonstrable in the
classical propositional calculus. (ii) The class of sequents derivable in the
dualintuitionistic propositional calculus is a proper subclass of the class of sequents
derivable in the classical propositional calculus. (iii) The class of formulas refutable
in the dualintuitionistic calculus is a proper subclass of the class of formulas
refutable in the classical |
2
propositional calculus. (iv) Both the class of formulas
demonstrable in and the class of sequents derivable in the dualintuitionistic restricted
predicate calculus are proper subclasses of the corresponding classes in the classical
restricted predicate calculus.
In this second paper, there are several occasions when I make reference to either
your published articles or conversations with you. This is so chiefly in terminological
points, the anticonditional functor, the “minimum definable negation” functor which
is actually the negation functor of dualintuitionistic logic, and the interpretation of
sequents occurring in Gentzen-type systems in terms of your concept of “relative
demonstrability or relative refutability.” I mention that the idea of developing a
system of logic dual to the intuitionistic logic was suggested to me by you. I’ve also
had to mention that in reviews of your articles by McKinsey, Kleene, and Curry,
errors in your systems of derivational logic have been pointed out.
To establish (iv) above, I was able to prove that the formula
(∃𝑥)𝑝(𝑥) ⊃∼(𝑥)∼𝑝(𝑥)
is not demonstrable in the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate calculus. The rule of
inference “If 𝑝(𝑥) ⊃𝑟, and if 𝑟is a formula in which 𝑥does not occur as a free
variable, then (∃𝑥)𝑝(𝑥) ⊃𝑟,” is not valid in the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate
calculus.
Do you think that I should come to see you before I hand in my thesis? If there
were plenty of time, I of course would want to show you my work before I type it in
final form. But unfortunately there is not very much time on my side, and you may
not have very much time yourself to read my papers now. If you wish to see me, I
could come to your home on Sunday or Monday. But if you don’t think that this is
necessary, I would prefer not to take the time away from my typing the final copy of
the thesis. If I don’t see you before I hand in the thesis, I shall send you the extra copy
after they have been bound. At least I’ll be able to get your judgement on the thesis as
a whole before I face the examiners in the oral examination sometime in July.
Yours sincerely,
Kalman Joseph Cohen.

Dear Mr. Cohen,

Karl R. Popper and Kalman J. Cohen
The problem of the interpretation of the dual-intuitionist calculus is really quite
simple.
I interpret 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚normally (remembering Tarski) to mean:
“every model that satisfies all the premises 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, also satisfies at least one of
the conclusions 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.” Now in the dual-intuitionist calculus we can interpret
𝑎/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
non-normally by
“If there exists at least one model that satisfies the premise 𝑎, then there exists
also a model that satisfies at least one of the conclusions 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚.”
(Clearly, in the intuitionist calculus, 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏can be interpreted by
“If the 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛are all satisfied by every model, i.e. if they are all
allgemeingültig, then 𝑏is also satisfied, i.e., it is also allgemeingültig”.)
Now this explains everything (e.g. the interpretation of the intuitionist calculus by
“necessary” and “impossible”) and it makes clear that the following interpretation of
the dual-intuitionist calculus holds:
Interpret every single variable “𝑎” to mean “𝑎is possible” (or “𝑎is satisfiable”)
or more precisely, interpret
𝑎/𝑏, 𝑐, . . .
to mean “from the possibility of 𝑎(or, from the assumption that 𝑎is possible), we
can deduce that at least one of the 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . is possible”; or “provided it is true that 𝑎
is possible, it must be true, for logical reasons, that at least one of the 𝑏, 𝑐, . . . is
possible”.
|
2
Interpret “𝑎𝑚” to mean “the classical negation of 𝑎is satisfiable”, i.e. “it is
possible that 𝑎is false” or “𝑎is possibly false”; “𝑎𝑥” means “it is possible that 𝑎is
necessary” or, “‘𝑎is necessary (or allgemeingültig)’ is satisfiable”.
Interpret the anticonditional “𝑎≯𝑏” so that it is satisfiable if, and only if, 𝑎is
satisfiable (possible) and 𝑏is not satisfiable (impossible); interpret “𝑎∧𝑏” to mean
“the conjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏is satisfiable” or “it is possible that both 𝑎and 𝑏are true
together”⟨Footnote: This also explains why you can no longer adopt the
interpretation of 𝑎/𝑏to mean “𝑏is deducible if 𝑎is adjoined to the axioms”; i.e.,
why 𝑎∧𝑏/𝑐↔𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐no longer works.⟩; interpret “𝑎∨𝑏” as “the classical
disjunction of 𝑎and 𝑏is satisfiable”, i.e., “it is possible that 𝑎or 𝑏” (which is
equivalent to “𝑎is possible or 𝑏is possible”).
Then the dual-intuitionistic calculus will be satisfied.
With the best wishes,
P.S. I consider publishing these results.

Dear Mr. Cohen,
Further to my letter on the interpretation of the intuitionist and dual-intuitionist
calculi:
Since we have a rule of substitution for demonstrable formulae, only such
formulae may be considered as “satisfiable” in the sense of my letter which do not
lead, merely by substitution, to non-satisfiable formulae. That is to say, formulae like
“𝑝”
“𝑝⊃𝑞”
must not be considered as “satisfiable”. Or, if we use “satisfiable” in the usual sense,
then
𝑎/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚
of the dual-intuitionist calculus must be interpreted “whatever substitution renders 𝑎
satisfiable also renders at least one of the 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚satisfiable” (or, in other words,
“there does not exist a substitution which renders all the 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚non-satisfiable”).
Yours sincerely
P.S. I gather that two examiners have been found for you.
25.9 Cohen to Popper, 22 April 1954
Typescript, 2p.
Department of Mathematics,
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York.
Professor K. R. Popper,
Fallowfield, Manor Road, Penn, Bucks., England.
22nd April 1954.
Dear Professor Popper,
Thank you very much for the trouble you have taken in writing a letter of
recommendation to the National Science Foundation. It must have been a very
favorable report, for recently I was notified that I have been awarded A National
Science Foundation Predoctoral Graduate Fellowship for the coming academic year.
This is the best situation I could have for next year, if I stay at Cornell to study
mathematics.
This first year at Cornell has been slightly disappointing to me, in that I am not
finding advanced mathematics quite as stimulating and interesting as I had expected.
While still at Oxford, I was undecided whether to do my graduate work in America in
mathematics or in philosophy; either option would have been possible, since my
major interest is logic. The considerations which led me to opt for mathematics were
its greater practicality and the supposition that maths, if it is to be learned at all, must

448
Karl R. Popper and Kalman J. Cohen
be learned when one is relatively young. The wisdom of this choice is now being
questioned in my own mind. If I continue at Cornell next year, I may try to do less
maths and more philosophy or perhaps economics. Mathematics is certainly a fine
subject, but I am afraid that it is not the subject where I can be happiest and do my
most effective work.
Since I last wrote to you, two other interesting possibilities have arisen. In fact, I
learned of them only three days ago, after I had been awarded the National Science
Foundation fellowship for next year. The first is a position as Teaching Intern in
philosophy of science and general education in science at Wesleyan University
(Middletown, Connecticut). This is a special opening made available under a grant to
Wesleyan from the Fund for the Advancement of Education of the Ford Foundation.
The post would be for one year only, and the work would consist in assisting in two
courses: (1) Philosophy of Science, a year course which ranges widely in the
philosophical aspects of the natural and social sciences, including treatment of
classical as well as contemporary philosophers and scientists, and (2) Physical
Science, a year course for students who have not majored in science, which treats of
selected historical and also systematic issues in the physical sciences, and the social
relations and functions of science. A friend of mine who is a professor at Wesleyan
suggested that I apply, and there is just a chance |
2
that I might be selected from all the
applicants for the position. I hope so, for I would certainly profit from and enjoy
teaching these courses at Wesleyan next year.
The second possibility is to do graduate study in mathematical economics at
Carnegie Institute of Technology (in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where my parents
live). I have always been rather interested in the social sciences. (If I hadn’t done a
research degree at Oxford, I would have read P. P. E.d) The uses of mathematics in
the social sciences are increasing rapidly, and since I am becoming dissatisfied with
pure mathematics, the applications of mathematics in the social sciences is a field to
which I might profitably turn. This would both satisfy my inclinations and utilize my
knowledge of mathematics. Carnegie Tech’s graduate program in mathematical
economics dovetails exactly both with my interests and with my previous training,
and it seems to be tailor-made for me. It combines work in economics and the other
social sciences with advanced mathematical and statistical techniques. You may have
already heard of this program, for I believe that one of your students at L.S.E., a
Mr. Dennis G. Price is now following it at Carnegie Tech. I’ve talked with Professor
Franco Modigliani (he’s also a friend of yours, isn’t he?) at Tech about the possibility
of my studying there, and although it is now rather late in the year, they might be able
to arrange a fellowship or graduate assistantship for me so that I can go there next
year.
What I shall do and where I shall be next year is thus still very uncertain. If only I
were really happy studying mathematics, there would be no problem, for I would stay
at Cornell on the N.S.F. fellowship. But time will tell, and I shall let you know my
ultimate decision.
Logic itself is still a study which I enjoy very much. At last I am getting around to
d Philosophy, Politics & Economics

25 Popper’s Correspondence with Kalman Joseph Cohen
449
rewriting my Oxford B.Litt. thesis, and I shall try to publish its results in one or two
articles. A great deal of shortening is required, and I would like to add some
additional results to the second paper on the dualintuitionistic restricted predicate
calculus. This year I have learned a great deal about many aspects of logic: recursive
function theory, Church’s systems of lambda-conversion, combinatory logics,
effective computability, higher order functional calculi, and axiomatic set theory.
Next year Professor Rosser will be back at Cornell, so I should be able to do even
more with logic if I remain here.
For this summer I shall be working in the actuarial office of the Indianapolis
(Indiana) Life Insurance Company. The work will probably be rather routine, but I
have to earn some money somehow and this will enable me to see what the life of an
actuary is like.
I hope that both you and your wife have been in good health, and that you have
been getting a lot of work done this year. This is the season of the year when England
is especially beautiful. But then spring is usually pleasant anywhere.
Cordially yours,
Kalman Joseph Cohen

Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George
Forder
Karl R. Popper and Henry George Forder
Abstract Henry George Forder (1889–1981) was a New Zealand mathematician
working mainly on geometry. During Popper’s time at Canterbury University College
in Christchurch, New Zealand, Forder worked at Auckland University College. (For
further biographical information on Forder cf. Butcher, 1985.) From their correspon-
dence it appears that even though they worked in the same country, they mainly
communicated by mail and did not meet in person, at least not regularly. Their
correspondence is especially significant for understanding the genesis of Popper’s
novel views on logic. Their conversations revolve mainly around physics, the nature
and foundation of mathematics, Boolean algebra and formal logic. They discuss
results and systems by Bernays, Brouwer, Carnap, Gentzen, Gödel, Hilbert, Lewis,
Russell and Tarski. Forder assists Popper in his research by making articles available
to him that he did not have access to in Christchurch. Many of Popper’s inferential
definitions are inspired by analogous definitions of operations in Boolean algebras,
and one can glimpse the germination of this idea in the correspondence between
Popper and Forder, for example in the letter of 7 May 1943.
Editorial notes: The letters are contained in KPS Box 296, Folder 15. The handwriting of Forder is
sometimes hard to read; we have used ⟨. . .⟩for problematic passages to indicate a possible reading.

Dear Dr. Popper
Your protegé Offenbergera duly appeared. I ⟨guess I⟩like him + expect to do
profitable work with him. I fear that my lectures will be rather patchy + incoherent
for I shall have little time for detailed preparation, and so will fall back on things I
know upside down.
It is improbable that I shall ever visit Christchurch. Travelling has never appealed
to me and is now more than ever distasteful. But I should certainly like a
conversation on foundations. Intellectually I have always been isolated and so view
all the problems from a peculiar individual angle – tho in the main Hilbert is my
master. He got much deeper than Whitehead + Russell, but unfortunately in thisb
work he was a bad expositor.
Do you get the J. of Symbolic Logic? We do not. There ought to be a copy in the
country.
|

Some of the later American developments – Curry – Rosser 𝜆conversion + so on
seems very repellant + to understand them one would have to do little else. Do you
know anything of them?
Again on Gödel’s work. Has a genuine theorem been found which can been shown
to be undemonstrable? ⟨I⟩n some field where this would be unexpected such as
integers, where the system of Axioms seems in some sense complete.
I fear I must stop. I hear a committee coming up the stairs.

Yours ⟨sincerely?⟩

Dear Professor Forder,
Many thanks for your letter. I was very pleased to get it. Excuse please my belated
reply: I had a very full first week. I hope that Offenberger will live up to expectations.
You ask whether a genuine problem has been shown to be Goedelian. Yes or no:
Yes if, as a follower of Hilbert, you recognize such problems as the consistency as
genuinely mathematical; no if you have in mind problems of the Fermat and
Goldbach type.
a Forder writes “Offenheimer” or “Oppenheimer”. He means John (Hans) Offenberger (1920–1999).

453
Tarski has shown that if a certain problem 𝑡is Goedelian, |
2
i.e. undecidable in the
system 𝑃1, then it is always decidable in a system 𝑃2 (of which 𝑃1 is a part); and he
has even developed a method permitting to construct a proof of ⟨the sentence “𝑡is
true”⟩c 𝑡or non-𝑡in 𝑃2 if a proof of the undecidability of 𝑡in 𝑃1 is given. Thus if
Goldbach’s conjecture were shown to be Goedelian, we could use this in order to
prove or disprove Goldbach’s conjecture. (Tarski’s method, of course, does not
permit us to construct a complete system 𝑃2; 𝑃2 will |
3
contain other Goedelian
sentences decidable only in 𝑃3, and so on.) Tarski has applied similar methods to
theorems which are not Goedelian; his method is capable of abbreviating proofs, and
he has also proved theorems concerning transfinite numbers by its help. He also has
given (in 1932) a proof of the consistency of “classical mathematics”, using Goedel’s
proof that the sentence maintaining this consistency is Goedelian. This proof was
later independently |
4
rediscovered by Gentzen who has given it a different emphasis,
and it has become known under Gentzen’s name.
The Tarski-Gentzen proof is interpreted by Gentzen as removing any doubt
concerning the consistency of mathematics. Tarski himself is slightly more sceptical;
since the system 𝑃2 in which the proof takes place is logically stronger than 𝑃1
whose consistency is proven, the proof need not prove anything; if 𝑃2 is inconsistent,
anything could be proven. Gentzen’s more optimistic opinion rests on the fact that he
has given the proof a form in which it appears to be intuitively sound, in a
Brouwerian sense. But this does not really improve |
5
matters much since Goedel has
shown that the apparent caution of the intuitionists is fictitious, and that the
intuitionist system is not only a part of the classical system, but vice versa: it is
possible to express any classical theorem in the intuitionist system, only in a
somewhat altered terminology. (Roughly speaking: for any theorem 𝑡of the classical
system there exists in the intuitionistic system a theorem, non-non-𝑡; the theorem that
the impossibility of 𝑡is impossible.)
Yours sincerely
K. R. Popper.

c Inserted between lines.
d Forder wrote “March 4”. Popper corrected the date in his letter of March 1943 (cf. § 26.2) from

before but for the heavy work here: everlasting meetings and an enormous Stage I +
so on.
I was familiar with the work you mentioned except the Tarski paper: could you
give me a reference for that? The result that if a question is undecidable in 𝑃1 a
construction for its decidability is possible in a wider system is not unexpected: but it
could be interesting to see its proof.
I said I was a disciple of Hilbert: But I doubt whether his other followers would
regard me as orthodox. I do not accept the creed that maths is a meaningless play on
symbols, and some do speak as if they accepted this creed. I take it to be a useful
method for some purposes; and as a method it constitutes the great advance over
Principia. I have little doubt that this was Hilbert’s own view: otherwise he would
hardly have constructed some of his proofs which Gordan described as
“theological”.e
Some consequences of my attitude are my views on proofs of consistency of
arithmetic + on Mengenlehref. I am sure arithmetic is selfconsistent – and I am sure
I know this. Hence Gentzen’s proof is to me merely an exercise if it is regarded
merely as proving the consistency of arithmetic. It is of course of more value than
this |
2
because we may hope that his method can be applied to some problems and
because of the way it catalogues demonstration.
On Mengenlehre I should like to be as “naive” as possible. The discussions on
MultAx long ago showed that slap-dash was risky + that some modification of the
“naive” point of view was essential. But I still look on Axioms of Mengenlehre in the
“inhaltlich”g way. If we assume MultAx we are delimiting the sets we allow, or
consider.
⟨Margin note⟩
Is there an English word for “inhaltlich”? “Meaningful” is not English and “meaning” is
indefinite. What about “expressive” or “purporting”⟨?⟩
Now comes a puzzle. Is Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (ℵ1 = potencyh of
continuum; or 2ℵ0 = ℵ1) true? I should like (naive) to regard this as a question of fact
concerning things given: The continuum + certain ordered sets. Now Gödel in some
recent work which I hope soon to study has shown that 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 (and in fact
2ℵ𝛼= ℵ𝛼+1) is consistent with some such ordinary Ax. of sets (not including
MultAx, which is proved also to be consistent with them). How are we to regard this
result, looking at things as naively as possible? Assuming (what of course is not yet
known) that 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 cannot be deduced from the other Axioms, does it mean that if
we assume it, we are further delimiting “sets” in a legitimate way?

I don’t like this: for our sets may be sets of points in a continuum 0ℵ1 and then

once again does it not become a matter of fact, leading as Sierpinski has shown to all
sorts of other matters of fact?i
Suppose it was shown thatj Goldbach’s conjecture was not inconsistent with
Peano’s Axs, would anyone be satisfied? In spite of Brouwer I am sure Goldbach is
either true or false.
I welcomed Gödel’s work on 2ℵ0 = ℵ1 because it was an application to a genuine
math. question. There is a risk that the new logic may be self⟨-⟩supporting – living to
chewing its own tail. I found it to throw light on the proofs of ordinary mathematics.
Consider the theorems:
1. Every odd number is the difference of two squares.
2. Every number is the sum of four squares.
3. Every number except 23 ⟨and⟩239 is the sum of eight cubes.k
1. is trivial 𝑠𝑢𝑚= (𝑛+ 1)2 −𝑛2
2. needs the principle of least number (Fermat’s principle of descent)
3. apparently needs analysis
|

I can see rather vaguely why (1) (2) differ: but the essential difference between (2)
(3) – apart from present methods of proof – is much more elusive.
At one time I thought it likely that every genuine theorem (cp. those above) could
be shown within the system of natural numbers. Gödel’s work has at least thrown
doubt on this – and further even “within the system” we apparently must distinguish
theorems whose proof needs “sets of sets” from those which need “sets” only – or
those which need only the narrow predicate calculus from those which need a wider
one.

Is there a formal logic of deduction, where instead of 𝑝⊃𝑞we have “from 𝑝we can prove

such should exist. Among the “paradoxes” of implication, it is surprising that Principia did

Have you seen the recent English edition of Tarski?n I reviewed the German for the Gazette;

But all this is terribly hazy + I hope the new logic will clear things up.
In geometry things are much clearer: in ordinary projective geometry: the
simplest theorems are those which run up into 𝑛dimensions at once: the next
simplest are those in which a distinction between odd + even dimensions is
necessary: the hardest those which refer to a single dimension only, e.g. ⟨. . .⟩or Hart

26.4 Popper to Forder, 7 May 1943
Typescript, 4 numbered pages.
May 7th, 1943
Dear Professor Forder,
Many thanks for your letter of April 30th. The number of problems you open up is
too great for reacting to all of them. I agree with your general philosophical
attitude/position in many ways, and I think that what may perhaps be termed as your
“realism” in opposition to the orthodox Hilbertian “formalism” is largely justified by
the later developments. Important as the purely “formalist” aspect is, it is only one
aspect of the matter, and not the most important one. This, I believe, has come out
clearly only through Tarski’s so-called “Semantics”, which considers a calculus (or
axiom system) in relation to its “content” or “purport”, i.e. to the subject matter
formalized by it.
You describe yourself as a disciple of Hilbert, emphasizing the undoubtedly
profound advance made by Hilbert beyond Principia Mathematica. I agree with your
judgement. I may perhaps describe myself as a disciple of my friend Tarski whose
methods, I believe, carry him nearly as far beyond Hilbert (in the direction indicated
by you, i.e. towards the “inhaltlich”, i.e. “purporting” or “contentual” or
“designational” or “denotating” function of a formal calculus) as Hilbert has gone
beyond Russell (Whitehead’s contribution, I suspect, was not very important; I
suspect this in view of what Whitehead himself says on this matter in his dreadful
book “Process and Reality”q). I think indeed that from Aristotle to Russell, there is
one line of development; with Hilbert, a new age begins; but it only begins. With
Tarski, a new level is reached. This sounds perhaps slightly extravagant and
over-enthusiastic, but I happen to believe that it is a just and well-considered
appraisal of the situation.
I must add, however, that although I may describe myself as a disciple of Tarski, I
am a bad pupil. Quite a number of the papers he has published are beyond me.
His theorem that every Goedelian sentence can be shown to be true (or false), was
first published in his “Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen”r. It
permits the transformation of any proof of the Goedelian character of a sentence into
a proof of the truth (or falsity) of that sentence. But this method seems to yield more.
p Undecipherable. The following combinatorial fact is probably meant: There are three ways to
partition four things in pairs.
q Whitehead (1929).
r Tarski (1935a).

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder
457
It shows that Goedel’s proof is only valid for systems (of a certain degree of wealth)
which employ the ordinary methods of proof or deduction. If essentially stronger
methods of proof (non-finitist methods) are employed, and especially methods which
admit the drawing of conclusions from infinite classes of premises, then Goedel’s
result does not hold.
In view of this situation, I sometimes wonder whether one could not sum up the
Goedelian situation as follows:
“If the wealth of the means of expression of a system is not matched by
correspondingly powerful methods of deduction, then the system is defective or
Goedelian (i.e. contains Goedelian sentences); to every increase in the wealth of the
means of expression of a system exists, however, a method of deduction to match, by
whose employment the defectiveness can be avoided.”
I do not know whether Tarski and Goedel would agree with this |
2
formula, but I
think it roughly characterizes the situation; and it removes, I think, the somewhat
unpleasant taste that the Goedelian situation is liable to produce.
Concerning the “infinitist” methods of deduction, the decisive step was again
made by Tarski, in his paper “Ueber den Begriff der logischen Folgerung”s, read at
the Paris Congress in 1936 (a paper in whose rendering in German I helped him); but
a certain step in this direction had been made by him before, in 1928 and 1930, and
by Carnap in 1932. Tarski’s “infinite” concept of a “logische Folgerung” is
essentially semantic.
But even apart from Tarski’s semantic theory, the situation is very simple indeed.
The Goedelian sentences have the form (𝑥)𝐺(𝑥), such that we can prove 𝐺(1), 𝐺(2),
etc. for any given number, but not the generalized sentence for all numbers. This
generalized sentence may be obtained, however, if we admit the infinitist method of
deduction which permits us to use the infinite class of premises of the form “𝐺(𝑛)”
in order to deduce (𝑥)𝐺(𝑥); at the same time, we have of course to employ our
meta-mathematical knowledge that every single sentence of that infinite
premise-class is deducible. (This can be expressed with the help of the method of
arithmetization.)
So much on the Goedel situation.
In regard to the consistency of arithmetics, I feel not quite as sure as you do. Of
course, I believe in the consistency of certain parts of arithmetics. But of the
consistency of arithmetics including transfinite arithmetics, I would not say, as you
do, that I am sure: although I do not expect new and unsuspected paradoxes to be
discovered in this field, I do not think that such a discovery is impossible, in the sense
that I am not sure that it will never happen. After all, we have suffered some shocks
in this respect, and in a certain way, our intuition is unreliable. Even the old
paradoxes (Russell; the Liar) have not yet been solved, i.e., in a sense which can
completely restore our confidence in our logical intuition. Intuitively, “This
proposition is false” is a proposition which maintains its own falsehood. Our means
of solving these difficulties are all “formal”, not “inhaltlich” or “designational”: i.e.
we construct an artificial system that prevents us from calling such a sentence a
s Tarski (1936b).

“sentence”, and thus from facing unpleasant situations. And our “intuitive” methods
of avoiding the problem are analogous: we know that the problem lands us in
disaster, and therefore prefer to look away. But this does not enforce my confidence
in the impossibility of finding other flaws.
But I am quite willing to concede that I expect arithmetics to be consistent, in
other words, not yield unpleasant surprises any longer.
My attitude towards Gentzen, under these circumstances, is precisely the same as
yours. (A fact that deserves consideration, since our basic attitude here is different.) I
also think that it is “merely an exercise”, which may be “of value” since it
“catalogues demonstrations”. (But we cannot get away from the fact that it employs
methods which, if arithmetics were inconsistent, would be inconsistent as well. This
was pointed out by Tarski in 1932, i.e. before Gentzen; and Tarski indeed outlined
Gentzen’s proof in his paper of 1932, in the “Mathematische Monatshefte”.t
Regarding Cantor’s continuum hypothesis, or rather 2ℵ0 = ℵ1, and Goedel’s
consistency theorem, there seem to be the following possibilities. |
3
(1) It may be inconsistent with the other axioms + the multiplicative Axiom.
(2) It may be consistent with the lot, and (2a) dependent from, or (2b) independent
from them.
Assuming the latter is the case, it would only mean that the other axioms do not
sufficiently characterize the “facts”; i.e., that the “facts” are not to a sufficient degree
characterized by them. In other words, there would be two kinds of “facts”, a
Cantorean and a non-Cantorean kind of fact, which both fulfil the other axioms of
set-theory, but of which one does not fulfil the axiom 2ℵ0 = ℵ1; or, to put it in a
geometrical way, there may be two continua, a Cantorean and a non-Cantorean,
which would be perhaps not so very surprising, considering that
geometrically-intuitively we can hardly say that we can distinguish between density
and continuity, in spite of the, as it were, robustness of this distinction! I see from
your letter that you “don’t like this”. But I think the consequences of the one or the
other theory may help us one day to make up our mind to say that it was only this
Cantorean (or perhaps the other, the non-Cantorean) continuity which corresponds to
that thing we meant when we spoke of the “continuum”. In this case, I suppose that
all “realistic” objections would disappear. Or would they not?
Regarding Goldbach, and against Brouwer, I entirely agree with you; and I think
indeed that the Brouwerian nightmare has turned out to be merely verbal. This again
is an achievement of Tarski’s semantics; and it is quite clear now that there is indeed
the alternative that either Goldbach’s conjecture is true, or there exists a natural
number, in the naive sense of the word “exists”, which falsifies it; that is to say, it
must be possible to find such a number (by sufficiently long continued experiments,
if not “constructively”), if Goldbach’s theorem is false.
Regarding your question “Is there a formal logic of deduction where instead of
𝑝⊃𝑞we have ‘from 𝑝we can prove 𝑞’?”, my reply is “yes”. If you do not make too
great demands on the wealth of such a system (regarding the structural analysis of the
proposition), we can even interpret the Boolean Algebra as such a system: Interpret
t Tarski (1933a). Popper’s claim that Tarski’s article anticipates Gentzen’s proof is highly dubious.

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder
459
the variables of the Boolean Algebra as variable names of sentences; interpret
“𝑎+ 𝑏” as the descriptive name of the disjunction of the sentences designated by “𝑎”
and by “𝑏”; and analogously “𝑎. 𝑏” and the negation “𝑎”; then every Boolean
theorem of the form “. . . ⊂- - -” can be interpreted as “from . . . follows - - -”. That is
to say, the Boolean sub-class or inclusion symbol “⊃” expresses logical implication
or deducibility. If we furthermore enrich the Boolean symbolism by defining
material implication:
“𝑎⊃𝑏” shall designate the same sentence as “𝑎+ 𝑏”,
then we get the difference between “⊃” and “⊂”, i.e. between material implication
and deducibility, very clearly.
We furthermore find that whenever a material implication equals one i.e. = 1, then
a deducibility holds, i.e.: if . . . ⊃- - - = 1, then
. . . ⊂- - -.
This shows that “= 1” means, in this interpretation, “is analytic” or “L-true” i.e.
logically true. (If, in the ordinary propos. calculus “. . . ⊃- - -” is analytic, then - - - is
deducible from “. . .”.) “= 1” corresponds to Russell’s “⊢” i.e. the assertion-sign.
Thus every main implication symbol of an asserted proposition of PMu can be
replaced by “⊂”.
This is a problem in which I have been much interested in connection |
4
with my
probability theory. I call this interpretation of the Boolean algebra the
“meta-propositional calculus”, or the “calculus of propositional names”. (I interpret
the theory of probability as a metrisation of this calculus.)
Your are quite right about (1) 𝑝⊃𝑞.∨. 𝑞⊃𝑝; it is indeed a “paradox of
implication”; this can be seen from the fact that of
𝑎⊂𝑏;
𝑏⊂𝑎;
both may be false. I.e., the analogous Boolean formulae are not disjunctive. On the
other hand, the Boolean formula
(𝑎⊃𝑏) + (𝑏⊃𝑎) = 1
is a theorem and therefore also
(2)
𝑎⊃𝑏⊂𝑏⊃𝑎.
This means that (2) is the Boolean formula which corresponds ⟨to⟩(1) in terms of
formal implication or deducibility; it tells us that from “𝑝⊃𝑞” we may deduce
“𝑞⊃𝑝” which is, of course, correct (“⊃” always being material implication), and
which corresponds indeed to (1).
I have not seen the English edition of Tarski’s book: I ordered it but I did not get it.

Dear Dr. Popper.
Many thanks indeed for your very interesting letter. It is clear that we speak the
same language and so can understand each other. I did not make myself clear in one
respect. I adopted a “cocksure” attitude about arithmetic – it was tic not tics. I am
confident there can be no contradiction resulting from Peano’s Axioms of integers.
But I am not intuitively sure about the transfinite. Even along the ordinals
𝜔, 𝜔𝜔, 𝜔𝜔𝜔, . . . I soon loose an immediate intuition and play only with representing
symbols.
I was at first surprised at the very high place you give Hilbert in the theory of
logic; but I think on consideration there is a strong case for what you say. Between
Aristotle + Hilbert I should feel inclined to put Peano as the great pioneer but I have
not read Frege and so must hesitate. Tarski’s paper in Studia Phil.w I have never seen.
Such work of his as I have seen is technically very accomplished, but not more than
developments of what had already been done.
I don’t know whether you could lend me Tarski’s paper – not now – I am too busy.
But if it is less than 200 pages I could read it in a month when I am freer. In
borrowing books I prefer as a matter of principle to fix or have fixed a time-limit to
which I adhere. Any other course leads to trouble.
On probability I am a barbarian. I only speak of it because your works will be
read by people as ignorant as I am.

My view, for what it is worth, is that probability is merely an average. For dice
throws this is obvious, for death-probability it is extrapolating an empirical average
to the future. The difficulties about infinite sets are only technical. The word

“probable” in “It is probable the war will end this year” describes a state of mind of
the speaker not a fact of the external world. So also for “It is probable the sun will
rise tomorrow”, “It is probable that Caesar crossed the Rubicon”.
Probability in quantum mechanics seems like death probability or perhaps
marriage probability (chance or free will). The laws connecting one such probability
with another may be only apparent (as I think non quantum laws almost certainly are)
and be the logical consequence of concealed structure.
But as I said, on these matters, I speak as the fool speaketh and may change my
opinion any time.

Gödel on Continuumx excellent. But ⟨as he?⟩“confuses types” I had to do mental exercises
for several days before I could read him. Your interpretation is I think correct. If the “power”
of the continuum ℵis beyond reproach, yet ℵ1 depends on what are “sets” and accordingly
the equation ℵ= ℵ1 means nothing from naive point of view. An axiomatic foundation of
“sets” is necessary + this ought to be all sorts of shapes.
Tarski’s logic. I have not got the English but the German edition. This I will send
you under separate cover. I have not seen the new Carnap about Tarski’s work.
Frankly I did not like Carnap’s main book (title forgotten – on language.) It seemed
to me he had committed the crime of turning a method (Hilbert’s) into a creed. If I
have understood what you have said about Tarski, this should now be corrected.
A student of mine, Millar, very good, has joined you at Christchurch. He is

think there are copies of Math. Gazette in your library or in Saddler’saa possession –
if not, I will send my copy to you. If you happen to see Watson’s article on geometry
in July 1938ab (the number containing the reviews) you should also see the way I
demolished him for good in December 1938ac.
I ought to have thanked you for your information on Boole algebra + implication:
I have studied your letter on that and other points with care. It appears that you have
settled the matter from Boole-standpoint. My original question was prompted in
another way: – Seeing that in formal logic it appears that ¬𝑝∨𝑞.≡. 𝑝⊃𝑞is the
source of all ill, can we not drop it and add such axioms as are necessary + so obtain
a theory of deduction exempt from paradox? Among the immense number of sets of
Axioms in primitive logic |
2
I thought there would be one at least which satisfies this
condition. Yet if it were so why the detour of Lewis + Langfordad? I must add that I
have never had time to consider the question.
I have asked the library to send you the Gödel Continuum tractae which I am sure
you will enjoy.
I am pretty sure I should be interested in your metrising of logic. As soon as the
3-way + 𝑛-way logics of the Poles were discovered the application to probability was
open – Was it not already discussed in Vienna in the early 30’s? Now will there not
be an analogy between your metrising of (∨∧) and the old geometric metrising of
descriptive geometry, ⟨introducing?⟩+ × from Desargues + Pascal Th.af On this side
I can claim knowledge. There is less likely to be an analogy with the deeper question
of metrising topology (Urysohn).ag
I made an application of the first doctrine to Milne’s kinematical relativity about 3
years ago (Quart. Journal Maths Dec. 1939)ah. I am out of offprints, but Saddler has
one). My interest in the probability would be technical rather than philosophical.
Could you send me Tarski’s Wahrheit paper which you were so kind as to put at
my disposal. I will keep it a month only from receipt.
If you ever want Herbrand’s papers in the Polish journal or the fundamental
papers on polish 3-way logic, our library has them.

Dear Professor Forder,
Very many thanks for your letter of June 29th. I am sending Tarski by the same
mail.
I have read your reviews of Russell and Tarski. With the first, I fully agree. I found
it most interesting and indeed excellent. Regarding the second, your remarks on “=”,
I was very interested, but not quite satisfied. Similar comments on “=” have been
made by Wittgenstein and Waismann. On the other hand, you will have seen that
Goedel (Continuum Hypoth., p. 2)ai treats 𝑋= 𝑌like Tarski. The reason why I am
not quite satisfied by your comments is this. Just as you write, in your letter,
concerning probability: “My interest in probability would be technical rather than
philosophical”, I feel that the problems in connection with “=” must be formulated in
a technical rather than in a philosophical way. I am just about to finish a paper on
Boolean Algebra and extensionality. In this paper, I discuss some problems of “=” in
a purely technical manner. I should be extremely grateful if you would go through
this paper of mine before I send it to the “Journal”.
I have not yet got hold of Prof. Saddler, and therefore not of your article on
Milne’s kinematic relativity.
Regarding your remarks on Lewis’ strict implication, I do not quite understand yet.
You call this system a “detour”. But your own programme of “adding to the calc. of
propos. such axioms as are necessary to obtain a theory of deduction exempt of
paradox” seems to me to be precisely the programme which Lewis has realized. (Is
the “detour” his introduction of modalities? But this seems to be unavoidable in a
theory of deduction as conceived by your programme, since to say that 𝑝follows
from 𝑞is the same as to say that it is logically necessary that 𝑝⊃𝑞, i.e. that ¬𝑝∨𝑞.
Thus we get “necessary” and the other modalities.)
Very many thanks for sending Goedel. How long can I have it? I have had two
somewhat superficial readings through it, and I enjoyed it. But I have not yet digested
the last part, i.e. on Cantor’s hypothesis. The other problem, the consistency proof of
the axiom of choice is surprisingly simple in its main ideas.
Very many thanks,
Yours,

Dear Dr. Popper
I found the Tarski awaiting me today at the college. I am just recovering from a
most devastating attack of flu which rendered me completely imbecile. Very many
thanks for the ⟨tract?⟩.
I adhere to my criticism of Tarski’s truth ⟨work?⟩. But, as its terms show, I was
not so presumptuous as to suppose I was telling him anything he did not understand
as well as anyone living. It may be in fact that he had pondered the difficulties so
much that he hesitated to ⟨print?⟩them out in a strictly introductory treatise. The
sign = when used purportingly seems to be either an alias or a christening as in
(1) Saul = Paul
(2) Senex = the oldest inhabitant of Auckland
Further research might show
J R Robinson = Senex.
On the other point – a formal logic without the “paradoxes”, as I said, I have thought
little. I don’t like Lewis’ modalities, but I am not even sure how to ask the question:
If we ask for a logic in terms of ¬ .∨. →where 𝑎→𝑏means “from 𝑎we can prove
𝑏” the question arises what sort of proof is contemplated: is it in terms of the Axioms
themselves? If so, we all know what special |
2
care is necessary. I hope I shall be able
some day to look into this but the duties here, everlasting meetings, huge classes and
unending routine make it very hard to keep all my many interests going.
I should very much like to see your paper on Boolean Algebra when it is ready. I
promise not to hold you up by keeping it too long.
Gödel is a library copy + they will remind you when to return it. But it will not be
urgently needed here for some time so there is no objection to your keeping it a
month or two to enable you to get its main gist.
I shall return your Tarski by the end of August. I think by that time I shall have got
from it what I can.

Dear Dr. Popper
Further to my letter.aj
The remarks I threw out about my dissatisfaction with Lewis were due to
memories of some reading a few years back. I have learned of some notes on the
subject + enclose a copy. It is in no sense original research being based on Lewis’
Book: a paper of Huntington’s + two of Tsung Tao Chen.ak What I send is not a mere
copy but a digested, selfcontained + I think improved version of their work. The
numbers of the propositions that come from Lewis are the same as in his book. This
facilitates reference, tho’ that is quite unnecessary. You probably know the main
thesis
Lewis system is Boole algebra with 𝑝< 𝑞written for 𝑝𝑞≡𝑝.
⟨Left margin⟩
By Lewis I mean Lewis + Langmuiral
Another curious point which I don’t fully understand is this
Any two deductions of form 𝑝< 𝑞are equivalent
We need only show if 𝑝< 𝑞is a deduction
𝑝< 𝑞.≡.𝑈
i.e.
𝑝𝑞≡𝑝:≡:𝑈

But
𝑝< 𝑝.≡. 𝑝= 𝑝

Now the Axioms themselves are deductions and so it seems that Lewis axioms are all
equivalent in their own presence.
aj Forder refers to the above letter § 26.8.
ak Forder means Tang Tsao-Chen. The papers are Tsao-Chen (1936, 1938).
al Forder presumably means Lewis and Langford (1932).

466
Karl R. Popper and Henry George Forder
This seems to be what Tang Tsao Chenam asserts and the above is a concise
version of his very tedious argument. He calls the result a paradox. It seems to
depend on interpreting (as he says) 𝑝< 𝑞as from 𝑝we can deduce 𝑞.
I don’t feel too happy about it.

Dear Professor Forder,
Many thanks for your letter. I did not know Tsuny Tao Chen’s(?)an work, to which
you refer; but I do not think that the equivalence of Lewis’ axioms in their own
presence is alarming.
If we call the class of all conclusions which may be drawn from a sentence 𝑋the
“content of 𝑋”, and if we call its complement the “anticontent of 𝑋” or “𝑎(𝑋)”, then
we can construct a class-calculus with these anti-contents, and the following holds: if
from 𝑋, we can deduce 𝑌, then 𝑎(𝑋) ⊂𝑎(𝑌); furthermore, we have such formulae
as: 𝑎(𝑋∨𝑌) = 𝑎(𝑋) + 𝑎(𝑌); 𝑎(𝑋𝑌) = 𝑎(𝑋)𝑎(𝑌), 𝑎(𝑋⊃𝑌) = 𝑎(𝑋) + 𝑎(𝑌) =
𝑎(𝑋) + 𝑎(𝑌), 𝑎(𝑋) = 𝑎(𝑋) = 1 −𝑎(𝑋), etc. and furthermore:
If, and only if, 𝑎(𝑋⊃𝑌) = 1, then
𝑎(𝑋) ⊂𝑎(𝑌)
If we now write instead of “𝑎(𝑋)”, say, 𝑝, and instead of “⊂”, say, “J”, then we
obtain Lewis’ system which, as you say in your letter, is Boolean Algebra with 𝑝J 𝑞
for 𝑝𝑞= 𝑝,ao since referring to this matter in an earlier letter in which I used
Boolean Algebra: The calculus of deductions can be constructed as a Boolean class
calculus of anti-contents.
Now to the problem of the equivalence of the axioms.
In the calculus of anti-contents, 𝑎(𝑋) = 0 if and only if 𝑋is contradictory, from
which it follows 𝑎(𝑋) ⊂𝑎(𝑌) for any contradiction 𝑋and any 𝑌; if further follows
that if 𝑋is contradictory, 𝑎(𝑋) = 1, i.e. the negation of a contradiction, which we
may call “analytic”, has an anti-content = 1. If 𝑋is analytic, then for any 𝑌,

ao Forder writes 𝑝< 𝑞instead of 𝑝J 𝑞.

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder

𝑎(𝑌) ⊂𝑎(𝑋),
i.e., an analytic sentence follows from any sentence, and thus all analytic sentences
are equivalent. But the axioms must be analytic; thus they are equivalent. (This is
true for all logical axiom systems, not only for Lewis’.)
I have a very great request. I urgently need Huntington’s paper of 1904 (Transact.
American Math. Soc. Vol. 5, pp. 288–309)ap because I need his treatment of his
second set of postulates, in which de facto inclusion is taken as primitive and 𝑎= 𝑏
is introduced (by a postulate) as mutual inclusion. Have you a re-print, or is perhaps
the whole volume in your library? I would also like to have, from the same Journal,
Huntington’s papers in vol. 35 (1933)aq, A. Church’s paper in vol. 27 (1925)ar, and
Bernstein’s paper in vol. 17 (1916)as. If you have any or all of these, could you send
them? The most important is Huntington 1904. I know I am asking a lot of you, but I
want to look at |

them before finishing my paper on “Extensionality in a Rudimentary
Boolean Algebra”.
I am extremely grateful for your readiness to look through this paper. In fact, I am
worried a great deal about the paper, since it is too long as it stands, considering its
very limited importance, and I shall very greatly appreciate your comments on it.

Dear Dr. Popper
Trans AMS 27/3 safely received. Many thanks. Certainly keep the other for the
time you mention.
Yes! You are right about Hilbert + Q.M.bc I forgot that side, – but I remember in
reading Schrödinger’s 1926 pioneer papers ⟨notions?⟩how he had been influenced
by the Hilbert-Courant Math. Physics Vol. I.bd In fact Schr. gave the impression that
that book put him on the track. Heisenberg’s approach was different: it was via
Bohr’s Korrespondenz Prinzip.be
There is some recompense for living in these days: I shall never forget the
adventure of following Schr. Heisenberg + Dirac in 1925–1928. It is hard to separate
these but perhaps Dirac is the greatest of them all. His thought takes my breath away.
Nor should it ever be forgotten that Weyl had completely clear ideas when the
Cambridge workers – Dirac excepted – were ⟨just⟩muddled.

Dear Dr. Popper
Many thanks for the Trans AMS safely received.
I did not recognize the results you sent me but as you know, a great deal of work
has been done recently in “lattices” partially ordered sets. There is still a lot to do –
of that I am sure.
My life now is rather full with routine. At present Stage I Examining. In Nov.
Stage II. In Dec matric. I do however even in these times try to set apart a period
each day for better things: and when you send your paper |

I will deal with it as

are rather messy.

Dear Forder,
I am very ashamed that there is some bad mistake, inexcusable indeed, in section
1 of my paper. I found it when checking the proofs of consistency. My present
postulate 1.70 is in order, but 1.7 (in both the verbal form of p. 4 and the symbolic
form on p. 12) is not even fulfilled by
0 1
0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0
as 𝑎= 𝑒= 1 and 𝑏= 𝑐= 0 shows.
1.7 must read:
1.7. Post. If 𝑎is in 𝐾then there is a 𝑏in 𝐾such that for any 𝑐, 𝑑, 𝑒, and 𝑓, in 𝐾, if
𝑎< 𝑒and 𝑏< 𝑒and 𝑐< 𝑒, and if, furthermore 𝑏< 𝑓and 𝑐< 𝑓together imply
𝑒< 𝑓, then 𝑑< 𝑒and 𝑎< 𝑐.
or in symbols:
(𝑥1)(𝐸𝑥2)(𝑥3)(𝑥4)(𝑥5)(𝑥6){𝐾(𝑥1) →(𝐾(𝑥2) & [{𝐾(𝑥3) & 𝐾(𝑥4) & 𝐾(𝑥5)&
& 𝐾(𝑥6) & 𝑥1 < 𝑥5 & 𝑥2 < 𝑥5 & 𝑥3 < 𝑥5 & ((𝑥2 < 𝑥6 & 𝑥3 < 𝑥6) →𝑥5 < 𝑥6)} →
→(𝑥4 < 𝑥5 & 𝑥1 < 𝑥3)])}.
I am terribly sorry that by sending you the stuff before having checked the proofs of
consistency etc. in the last section (section 5), I may have caused you unnecessary
labour; I know how it is if one gets something like this for checking: one does not
wish to assume that the author is an ass (even though it is true in this case) and
therefore wrecks one’s brains in an attempt to understand what is in fact
unintelligible.
Of course, pp. 2/3 have to be re-written (and p. 12 as well); also Definition 1.16. I
believe, however, that everything is in order now, and I shall |
2
send you the rest in a
day or two, hoping and praying that you won’t be too disgusted with me, and not give
me and my paper up altogether.

Dear Forder,
After many delays, I can send you now the whole thing. In checking the last
section (proofs of independence), I found several mistakes which were not difficult to
repair, but which had various repercussions throughout sections 3 and 4; so it was
necessary to check the lot again and again, and especially the “cross-word-puzzles”
of section 5. But I think that everything is now in reasonable order; and I very much
hope that there aren’t any such shameful mistakes left as the one in connection with
the first version of the first set, about which I wrote you an air-mail letter.
In order to make a similar blunder impossible I have now stated the proof of the
equivalence of 1.10 & 1.170 with 1.1 & 1.7 (the latter is newly formulated) in
sufficient detail; so I hope at least. 1.7 as it appears now is neither the old one nor the
one I sent you in my air mail letter; even the latter had a mistake in it (the operator
“𝑥6” must be confined to a more narrow range); I wrote the letter a bit hastely with
the intention to save you further unnecessary trouble with this version. Besides, I
have now simplified 1.7, so that only five variables are needed, as in the original
(false) version. You will see all that from pp. 3ff. I am sending you the whole thing,
including pp. 6 to 11, which are not re-typed, but the same as I sent you originally,
only with a few ink-corrections, mainly re-numbering of the theorems.
If I may now say something about the whole paperbf: it is all very unfortunate, and
I am rather sick of it. It is not quite unimportant, and in some of its detail perhaps as
interesting as Huntington’s papers; but I feel that it is, all in all, much ado about
nothing. And I very much doubt whether anybody will print it.
If you could suggest some cuts, I should be very grateful. In fact, I have tried to
compress it as much as I could.
The things which are comparatively the most interesting are, I think, (1) the fact
that one can construct Boolean algebra sets that are not clumsy without either a
D-rule or a ∨-rule (these are defined on and before p. 18). I think at least that this is
new. (2) The concurrence set (pp. 37–42 and pp. 44-45). (3) Certain remarks in
section 5.
If I now may ask you especially for two favours:
(a) On p. 50 I refer, in the line before I.5, to Huntington’s postulates 4.6 & 5.5.
Not it is possible that this reference to 5.5 is mistaken. Could you check this? I mean
whether my model satisfies Huntington’s Fifth Set except 5.5? (I have made no copy
of this set, unfortunately.)
(b) On p. 55, Remark 3, I describe a system of Boolean algebra without 𝑎−𝑏+ 𝑏′.
Have you any idea how this system is related to Boolean “rings”?
I may perhaps tell you that this whole paper developed in this way: some of the
sets 3 to 12 are by-products of certain probability |
2
work, and so are parts of
bf This refers to one of Popper’s papers on Boolean algebra.

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder
473
section 5. Section 1 (and the second set) was added in the last moment, when I
noticed that the other results allowed this application. (This occurred to me only just
before I wrote you my letter about my results; the other parts of the paper, including
simple independence etc., were long ready by then.)
I feel very strongly how much I am intruding upon your time, and I beg you most
earnestly to accept my apologies for the length of the paper and the unnecessary
complications. Please, do not be hurried with reading the paper, and do not feel
obliged to read it at all if it bores you. And many, many thanks for the trouble you
have already taken.

Dear Popper
a terrific spate of Examining has prevented me from answering you before. I now
have a break from this – though college affairs still hold me – until the avalanche of
Matric ⟨demands?⟩early in December.
I was not held up by your error: I took the statement for the time being as read.
The word “any” in English is very indefinite.

or
𝑥∈𝐾: (𝑎)𝑎∈𝐾. ⊃. 𝑓(𝑎) :⊃: . . .
For this reason I was not sure which you meant.
“Dual of” usually: sometimes “dual to” might be used.
“The dual of Pascal’s theorem is . . .”
“The dual theorem of Pascal’s Th.”
or “⟨The dual theorem⟩to ⟨Pascal’s Th.⟩”
I prefer “of”.

General criticism
I am sure that you will wish me to be quite frank. I myself have derived great
benefit from frank criticism of my friends and correspondents.
(1) The work up to p. 11 is quite an advance: I have not seen it elsewhere: and I
think it most likely it is new. If I were referee I should recommend acceptance.
(2) But I do not see the point of translating it into H.B.bh functional calculus: and
I deprecate the change of letters to 𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . .. It is obvious that the translation is
possible and for that reason alone is hardly worth doing. Moreover you make no use
of the translation in the metamaths ⟨discussion⟩. It is right that you should compare
your work with |

Tarski’s reduction: Why not turn his H.B. notation into the earlier
much more readable one you first adopt. I think the logical notation should only be
used when either it makes the work easier to read + follow or it is basis of a
metamathematical discussion. Your paper, you tell me, is long. It will, I feel sure,
attract more attention if it is pruned as I suggest.

I looked again at Schrödinger’s Cambridge paper.bi I have never been able to
accept the usual interpretation of Qu. Mechanics + his work seems to be a reductio
ad absurdum. Things happen as they happen, perceived or not, observed or not.
There is an external world in which ⟨parts?⟩definite ⟨“definite”, not necessarily
“causally determined”⟩things occur. This is my old-fashioned view. The Schr.
trouble starts right at the beginning: When a photon is split into two beams it is in
both beams until an observation when it jumps into one. Thus the other beam is
affected. This is the usual orthodox statement. I myself believe that it is in one or the
other + which it is in is discovered and not produced by the observation tho it may be
produced by the material circumstances. Which beam it is in may be subject only to
probability laws, but I make no sense of probability in abstracto: in spite of all
difficulties I see in probability merely an “average” ⟨=?⟩“frequency”. Anything else
leads to mysticism in a wrong ⟨province?⟩.
When your paper is in final form I will check the technical side if you wish:
provided that my other duties do not make this impossible.

P.S. we are introducing Dockeray “Pure Maths”bk here next year: a good book, but
in places stodgy due to the following fact. He is most anxious to be rigorous and
hence rightly avoids geometric intuition as a constituent of a proof. But he fears to
use it in construction of a proof which in its final form would be non-intuitive. I am
thinking of sending a note to the “Math. Gazette”bl on this: but it would need
checking for rigour by someone. Is this at all in your line. I mean such things as
𝑓(𝑔) →𝜔. ⊃. log 𝑓(𝑔) →log 𝜔
under condition.

Karl R. Popper and Henry George Forder
Very many thanks for your letter. Let me first assure you that I should be very
happy indeed if I could do any checking for you; provided, always, that I understand
the matter sufficiently. I doubt whether this will be the case; but if not, then I shall
simply tell you without delay. Your example,
𝑓(𝑥) →𝜔. ⊃. log 𝑓(𝑥) →log 𝜔,
I did not understand, unfortunately, since I have not the slightest idea what the arrow
may mean here. But I might perhaps understand it in its context. In any case, I am
most willing to do anything within my extremely limited powers.
Regarding the part in your letter on my paper, I was particularly pleased about
your readiness to give me your criticism and general impressions. It goes without
saying that you were right when you thought that I want you to be frank. If anything,
I want you to be quite merciless! I am well aware of the necessity of being blunt in
such matters, and of the great advantage of a full mutual agreement on this point.
And I should be quite uncomfortable if you had the slightest hesitation of saying
what you think; of course, I reserve the right of defending myself, even though it is
very unlikely that I shall make use of this right. To be more practical, I am most
willing to cut out the symbolic formulations to which you object; but I may just
mention why I put them in. One reason is of course Tarski’s formulation. But the
other was the fact that I found my original formulation of 1.15 and 1.16 nearly
impossible to formulate in words. Now that I have simplified these formulations, this
reason disappears. I shall gladly accept your final ruling in this matter. I should also
be glad to cut out a lot in section 2, which I have re-written at least ten times, in vain
attempts to reduce its length. The only success was that my main objective does not
come out clearly: I mean the avoidance of the D-rules or 𝛾-rules so far used, as far as
I know, by all sets of Boolean algebra. (Do you know one that does not use it?)1
This leads me back to your letter. You suggest that I should prove the reflexive and
transitive laws for “=” immediately after 1.14. But unfortunately, I have now shifted
all definitions to the beginning. Shall I |
2
shift them back, in order to comply with
your suggestion? (My reason for shifting them to the beginning was that I do not
agree with Huntington’s methods of first proving that a certain expression “exists”
and is “unique”, and then defining; I prefer to formulate the definitions so that they
demand uniqueness and existence.)
Your other comments refer to 1.70𝛾(= 1.58𝛾in new numbering) and 1.73 (1.61
new numbering) on p. 9. 1.70𝛾(= 1.58𝛾): the reference to “1.5” was a typing mistake;
it should have been “1.55”, which is, in new numbering, 1.53. Since by 1.14, we get
from 1.57 (= 1.69 in old numbering) (𝑎′ + 𝑏′)′ < 𝑎𝑏, it is only necessary to refer to
1.0; the law of transitivity for “=” is thus here not really necessary. However, you are
quite right in your demand that I should refer to some such transitivity principle in
the reference to 1.73 (= new 1.61). It will be, I think, sufficient if I include a
reference to 1.14 and 1.0 in the references to 1.73 (= 1.61). Don’t you think so? (The
same references should remain in the references to 1.74 & 1.75 (new: 1.62 & 1.63).
1 This bears on Bernays’ reduction of Russell’s primitive propositions.

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder
477
Now regarding the Schrödinger-Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen problem.bm I always felt
precisely as conservative as you do, and I even published something on this point,bn
many years ago (which led to lengthy discussions with Heisenberg). I know now that
I was wrong in some points, but I was, I think, right in others. My point was that the
indeterminacy-formulae must be interpreted statistically (i.e., as probabilities in the
sense of relative frequency), since they are derived from equations which must be
interpreted in this way. You see, this corresponds exactly to what you say. But later
discussions with Heisenberg, and especially with Bohr, made me more conscious of
the difficulties. I had shortly before leaving Europe an opportunity to discuss
Einstein’s and Schrödinger’s views with Bohr (or rather, to listen to Bohr’s most
interesting criticism of these views, for he did, of course, most of the talking).
Although I felt much happier with Schrödinger’s views, I must admit that Bohr’s
arguments were very important. He says, in brief (as you may remember from his
reply to Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) that by measuring the one of the two partial
systems after their interaction, our own system of reference is interfered with, and it
is this interference which reflects upon and blurs the result of any calculation of the
second partial system. But although this seems to be correct, it is as such not really
satisfactory.
At present, I feel inclined to look for a solution along the following lines. I feel
inclined to reject Heisenberg’s idea of the full duality of “wave picture” and
“particle-picture”. He contends that nothing can be |
3
gained in giving these two
different roles to play, since the indeterminacy affects both equally. I feel inclined to
emphasize that all elementary physical “events” are of the character of
particle-impacts or particle-interaction. Or perhaps better: let us drop the
particle-picture and speak, more neutrally, of physical “events”. Then we find that
certain aspects of these events can be predicted precisely, others only statistically (in
accordance with the indeterminacy relations), and that fields, and waves of fields (in
configuration-space) are statistical fields measuring the frequency of certain types of
“events”. These frequencies can be measured and are therefore “observables” in
Dirac’s sense; thus my elementary “events” and Dirac’s “observables” do by no
means coincide. The best “picture” for individualizing the “events” is an impact etc.
of particles. But we must be clear that this is only a picture, a metaphor from the
macro-world; that the (blurred) track of a particle is, similar to a field, only a picture
of the probability of an event; and that particles possibly do not exist at all. That is to
say, if we split a photon into two beams, it is not necessarily so that “there is a
photon” somewhere, either in the one beam or in the other. What we split is, of
course, the beam, i.e., the wave-field, i.e., the frequency of the occurrence of an
event, i.e., of a photo-electric impact.
All this is rather trivial, but it is neither precisely what Heisenberg says nor what
Dirac says (although it hardly contradicts only what the former says). It is, of course,
no answer to the problem raised by Einstein and Schrödinger; but I think it might be
bm Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (1935).
bn Popper (1934).

478
Karl R. Popper and Henry George Forder
used for ironing out the differences between these and Bohr, roughly along the
following lines:
As opposed to the “event”, the particle-track-picture shares with the wave-picture
the property that it depicts possibilities of events which may happen under certain
circumstances; e.g., if there is something near the path of the particle. As opposed to
this, the “event” itself occurs only if at least two Quantum mechanical systems
interact. Thus the event always involves a second system, for example, the measuring
system; (I say “for example” because I find it important to insist that the measuring
system is in no way more “subjective” than any other); and anything interfering with
the second system may, of course, modify the probability of an event. In other words,
the history of the second system will reflect on the probability of |
4
the event, and
therefore on the wave-picture of the event as well as on the particle picture (of the
track). But this is not due, as Heisenberg contends, to an interaction between
observer and observed; this strangely causal-deterministic theory of Heisenberg is, I
feel, destroyed by Einstein and Schrödinger. Rather, it is due to the simple fact that
every theoretical picture of events must be statistical, i.e., must depict the probability
of an event which, of course, is always the interaction between two systems; so that
the (statistical) picture of the one system must be, of course, influenced by changes in
the system of reference. I do not know whether I have expressed myself sufficiently
clearly, and whether what I say is at all worth mentioning.

Dear Forder,
Thank you so much for your letter, I am sorry that you are suffering under an
attack of matric. It must be too awful for words. I don’t think I could survive it; even
in University examination times I always wonder why the suicide statistics does not
show a peak at this time of the year. You have my full sympathy, and I certainly do
not expect you to reply to this letter.
Many thanks for your corrections and your very valuable suggestions which I all
accept; but I may say in self-defence, that the method (which I am trying to exclude)
of securing independence by means which you call “fraudulous” has been used by
Huntington not only “at the beginning of the century” i.e., in his Third Setbo, but also
bo Huntington (1904, § 3).

26 Popper’s Correspondence with Henry George Forder
479
in 1933 in his Sixth Setbp; furthermore, my point is not so much that such fraudulent
methods “ought” not to be adopted, but that one must redefine independence in such
a way that “ethics” is replaced by definable desiderata.
All this is only self-defence, and I do not hesitate to accept your suggestions. I
quite believe that it is hard to see the wood for the trees; for there are, unfortunately,
too many trees in the way, but very little wood. I don’t like the paper for this reason:
it is a large collection of minor results which are at best only moderately exciting.
But I need these results (of sections 3 to 5) in connection with my probability theory,
which would become too complicated if I had to derive the results there. It is very
sad, and I am, as you have guessed, sick of it.
There is a large number of points which I should love to discuss with you, but I
realize how difficult it is to do this by letter. One of my points is this: Do you know
whether “dense” lattices and Boolean algebras have been investigated? I mean a
lattice or Boolean algebra with a postulate of density, e.g.,
Postulate Dy: If 𝑎, 𝑏are in 𝐾, then there is a 𝑐in 𝐾such that
(𝑎< 𝑐∨𝑐< 𝑏.→. 𝑎< 𝑏) & (𝑏< 𝑎.→. 𝑐< 𝑎& 𝑏< 𝑐)
On the basis of a dense lattice or Boolean algebra it is of course very easy to build up
a continuous lattice or Boolean algebra, by adding a postulate of continuity such as
Postulate Cy:
Postulate Cy: If, for all (natural numbers) 𝑛, the elements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, are all in
𝐾, and
𝑎𝑛< 𝑎𝑛+1,
then there is an element 𝑎∞in 𝐾such that |
2
𝑎𝑛< 𝑎∞
for all 𝑛, and
𝑎∞< 𝑏
for any 𝑏that satisfies, for all 𝑛, the conditions
𝑎𝑛< 𝑏.
In other words, to every monotonously increasing series of elements of 𝐾there is an
element 𝑎∞in 𝐾such that
lim
𝑛=∞𝑎𝑛= 𝑎∞
We can, of course, use a simplified Dedekindian method instead:
Postulate Cy∗: If 𝐴and 𝐵are sub-classes of 𝐾such that, for any 𝑎1, 𝑏1 ∈𝐾,
(26.1)
𝑎1 ∈𝐴& 𝑏1 ∈𝐵→𝑎1 ≤𝑏1
bp Huntington (1933b).

480
Karl R. Popper and Henry George Forder
then there is an element 𝑐in 𝐾such that, for any 𝑎2 ∈𝐴and 𝑏2 ∈𝐵,
(26.2)
𝑎2 < 𝑐& 𝑐< 𝑏2
I have never seen anything of this sort applied to lattices or Boolean algebras (the
nearest can be found in Tarski’s “Systemenkalkül”, but it is rather different). But it
seems very obvious, especially as the basis of a calculus of continuous probabilities.
I strongly suspect (but I have not proved it yet to full satisfaction) that a Boolean
algebra without variables of the order of the constant 𝐾; i.e., a “lower Boolean
algebra”, to which 𝐷𝑦is added, becomes complete.

Dear Popper
I fear that the reputation I first gained as a good correspondent is irrevocably lost.
Your paper interested me but much work and worry has delayed things. Your cross
word puzzles have now been checked + I think your work should be presented. But
where? It is doubtful whether the Am. Math. Soc. would print it in the Trans.bq tho’
they have printed ⟨also?⟩much longer papers on Boole algebra: it is mainly a
question of space. Similarly for the Am. Journ.; Annals; + Duke.br
The obvious place is Journal of Symbolic Logic – I never see that + do not know
usual length of papers there.
The war is affecting America. Garrett Birkhoff has deserted lattices + is now
|
2
working on Kutta-⟨J⟩oukowski aeroplane formulae. George B. has appealed to
maths to keep a balanced sense of values. Others of the logical tribe such as Curry
are doing applied Maths. Are the same sane things still so in + you could at least
send the paper.
On dense and continuous lattices I know nothing except that this of course turns
up in various disguises all over the place. An axiomatic treatment I cannot recall. The
recent work on axioms of rational real numbers would be a starting point. I have a
feeling that if continuity (Dedekindian) were introduced, the alternatives would be

I am very sorry that Offenberger came down in his Applied Maths III. It was a
prerequisite for the MA + he was so interested in the logical side that it is a
disappointment for both of us.
This year is going to mix me up with the Postprimary syllabus, I fear. They won’t
leave me alone. College + University politics are time consuming, but if they are
ignored they fall into the hands of men with big hearts + small brains.
I think your ⟨wireless?⟩talks can make people see, i.a. ⟨this?⟩importance of
Maths. Its standing in this country is a disgrace tho’ I must say, it is now respected at
Auckland. But talk, chatter + loose thinking have far too much influence here + this
new turn of educational policy tends to increase it.

insist.bu It seems to me that e.g. on interpretation + exposition of ways of life or of
thought in antiquity, the middle ages, or in some modern age, is just as valuable and
calls for gifts as high as the best needed in scientific work. And there is a risk that in
N.Z. any development will be in the Technical direction. For this reason I am very
glad of the paragraph: (p. 3) “Beyond providing this framework . . .”
p. 4 “N.Z. has lost opportunities, in recent years, etc.” what “workers” are you
thinking of?
I congratulate you on this excellent manifesto.

P.S. Misunderstanding by the public is of course inevitable. It is no fault of the
statement. Many will think that we are suggesting that Stage I students should begin
“Research”. (The word is even used in Secondary Schools in N.Z.) We have no
Honours Courses in the English sense. Still we are I suppose mainly addressing
people like Senate members. But even they will quite likely misunderstand.

Popper’s Correspondence with Harold Jeffreys
Karl R. Popper and Harold Jeffreys
Abstract Harold Jeffreys (1891–1989) was a British scientist who mainly contributed
to mathematics, statistics, Bayesian probability, geophysics and astronomy, but also
published articles on other subjects. (For further biographical information cf. Cook,
1990.) This letter by Popper to Jeffreys was written in the context of a debate
between Jeffreys and Popper on the nature of logic, which took place in the journal
Mind between 1940 and 1943. This debate starts with Popper’s article “What is
Dialectic?” (Popper, 1940), in response to which Jeffreys published the note “Does
a Contradiction Entail every Proposition?” (Jeffreys, 1942). Popper announces his
response to Jeffrey’s article in the letter reproduced here; he will publish it as “Are
Contradictions Embracing?” (Popper, 1943; Chapter 8 of this volume.). The letter
is also interesting for Popper’s remark on the probability interpretation of logical
formulas, as well as for his remark on the relationship between formal logic and
methodology.
Editorial notes: The letter can be found in KPS Box 313, Folder 9. We have replaced the symbol ∼
by ¬.

Dear Sir,
I have just received Mind and have read your note ⟨Jeffreys, 1942⟩on my
Dialectic-paper ⟨Popper, 1940⟩with great interest. Your doubts induced me to
analyse briefly what is really assumed if we wish to prove that contradictions are
embracing, i.e. that any sentence whatever can be deduced from them. I have sent
this analysis to the Editor of Mind, and enclose a copy of this note. I am grateful for

Karl R. Popper and Harold Jeffreys
the opportunity you have created for clarifying this difficulty. May I, in this letter,
indicate my attitude to the other points in your note?
When you write: “Carnap is so drastic as to take ¬𝑝. ⊃. 𝑝⊃𝑞as his first
primitive sentence”, I cannot agree that this is drastic. Lewis’ System of Strict
Implicationa certainly does not contain any of the so-called “paradoxes of
implication”, and I do not doubt that “Strict Implication” fulfils every requirement of
“Entailment”. Lewis has shown, however, that it is possible to include “Material
Implication”, i.e. Russell’s Implication, in his system, and to deduce, within the
system of strict implication, the whole of Russell’s system. This shows that the
system of Material Implication is perfectly sound, even if judged from the system of
entailment, only that we must not interpret Material Implication as Entailment, as
Russell unfortunately did. But Carnap not only avoids this mistake of Russell’s, he
also explains at length that his implication corresponds to Material Implication, and
that Consequence or Inference or Deducibility (or “Entailment”) must not be mixed
up with it. Furthermore, he shows at length that Deducibility in the system must be
expressed in a very different way (namely “syntactically”). And lastly, he discusses,
and admits, the restricted value of other systems like that of Lewis which formalise
entailment within the “Object Language”, and shows the superiority (greater
generality) of a system which introduces the concept Deducibility only in the
Syntax-Language or Meta-Language. The reply to your question “What happens if
we read . . .” would therefore be: Such a reading is excluded by the very formula
which you contest; just as the reading of “and” for “or” (and vice versa) is excluded
by formulae such as “(𝑝. 𝑞) ⊃𝑝”, and perhaps “𝑝⊃(𝑝∨𝑞)”. According to Lewis’
investigations (cp. Lewis-Langfordb, p. 139f), only the asserted implication-symbol
(and this is in the formula “¬𝑝. ⊃. 𝑝⊃𝑞”, of course, the first of the two implication
symbols) can be interpreted as Entailment.
Regarding the probability-interpretation of “¬𝑝. ⊃𝑝⊃𝑞” I see therefore no
difficulty. Why not interpret it “on the data ‘¬𝑝’, the sentence ‘𝑝⊃𝑞’ is certain”; i.e.
𝑃(𝑝⊃𝑞| ¬𝑝) = 1. Since “𝑝⊃𝑞” is a material implication, i.e. only a shorter way
of writing “¬𝑝∨𝑞”, 𝑃(𝑝⊃𝑞| ¬𝑝) = 1 is the same as 𝑃(¬𝑝∨𝑞| ¬𝑝) = 1 which
is, of course true. But apart from all that: I feel that we should never criticize formal
logic from the point of view of some methodology; rather we should criticize any
methodology (which of course uses formal logic in every step it takes), and any
theory of probability, from the point of view of formal logic.
Many thanks for your interest in my paper.
Yours sincerely,
a Lewis (1918, Ch. 5).
b Lewis and Langford (1932).

Popper’s Correspondence with Stephen Cole
Kleene
Karl R. Popper and Stephen C. Kleene
Abstract Stephen Cole Kleene (1909–1994) was an American logician, well-known
for his fundamental work in various fields of theoretical computer science, such as
formal language theory, automata theory and recursion theory. The letter to Kleene
reproduced in this chapter shows Popper’s continued interest in Boolean algebra. In
that letter Popper claims to have found a proof of a theorem in Boolean algebra that
contradicts propositions which are widely believed to be true; similar letters were
sent to various other researchers. A typescript entitled “The Distributivity of Lattices
with Unique Complements” was enclosed, but the alleged proof contains an error. As
mentioned in the Preface, Popper’s work on Boolean algebra is outside the scope of
this edition. This episode, part of a larger critical examination of the logic of quantum
mechanics, is discussed more fully in an article by Del Santo (2020).
Editorial note: The letter to Kleene can be found in KPS Box 315, Folder 23.

Chapter 29
Popper’s Correspondence with William Calvert
Kneale
Karl R. Popper and William C. Kneale
Abstract William Calvert Kneale (1906–1990) was a British logician and historian of
logic, who is best known for his book The Development of Logic (Kneale and Kneale,
1962) on the history of logic, jointly written with his wife Martha Kneale. (For further
biographical details cf. Smiley, 1995.) In his letter to Popper, Kneale suggests a
generalization of Popper’s single-conclusion deducibility relation 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏to a
multi-conclusion relation 𝑎1, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚, where the formulas 𝑏1, . . . , 𝑏𝑚are
understood conjunctively. This direction would later be pursued in Kneale (1956)
and in Kneale and Kneale (1962, Ch. IX). Both of these texts refer to Popper, and
Kneale develops Popper’s ideas of inferential definitions into a theory where logical
constants are defined by double-line rules, that is, rules which can be read in both
directions. This makes Kneale one of the few persons who further developed Popper’s
ideas on the nature of logical constants.

Dear Popper,
I have been reading your article in Mind on New Foundations for Logica and want
to tell you how much I have enjoyed it. If I may be allowed to say so, it seems to be
excellent. I hope you will soon publish a book in which this approach is explained at
a Popper (1947c).

greater length with the necessary proofs. It should be very valuable for the
teaching⟨?⟩of logic.
May I make a little suggestion? (Perhaps you have already thought of it and turned
it down for some good reason.) Maybe you could introduce the notation “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐, 𝑑”
as an abbreviation for “𝑎, 𝑏/𝑐and 𝑎, 𝑏/𝑑”? This would make the statement of your
generalized transitivity principle much simpler (Incidentally Base I seems to be so
much better than II or any variant |
2
that I should much prefer it for a full exposition: it
is not really very complicated). You only need to make clear that the statements
whose names appear before a stroke are taken collectively and⟨?⟩those whose names
appear after distributively.
You can then allow yourself to use such expressions as “𝑎, 𝑏//𝑐, 𝑑” with suitable
explanations. It is rather convenient to be able to say that two sets of statements (eg
two postulate sets) are logically equivalent.
Yours sincerely
William Kneale.
29.2 Popper to Kneale, 30 June 1948
Typescript, 1p.
L.S.E.,
June 30th, 1948.
Dear Kneale,
I am sorry to have let you wait: I had no copy of my little paper, since one is in
Ryle’s hands (he is publishing it in Mind), while the other was in Ayer’s hands till
this morning.b I should like to hear what you think. Ayer says he is not quite
convinced yet.
There was a reviewc in the Journal of Symbolic Logic which
(a) Swallows my New Foundationsd up by saying it is a re-statement of Gentzen.
(But what, for example, about my method of defining the formative signs in terms of
deducibility (which is introduced by primitive rules)?)
(b) Says that my only claim to originality is in L. without Assumptionse, and
criticizes this on lines which are based on a misunderstanding (for which I have to
take most of the blame); viz: I consider, of course, an absolutely valid rule a rule
which is valid without referring to the forms of the statements involved, and not a
rule confined to absolutely valid inferences.
Example:
(I) If “𝑎/𝑏” is absolutely valid, then “𝑏/𝑎” is absolutely valid. This (I) is a valid
rule about absolutely valid inferences.
b Perhaps Popper (1949c).
c McKinsey (1948).
d Popper (1947c).
e Popper (1947b).
(II) If 𝑎/𝑏then 𝑏/𝑎. This rule II is an invalid rule (which does not refer to the
forms of the statements involved).

29 Popper’s Correspondence with William C. Kneale
493
Thus a valid rule about absolutely valid inferences may not remain valid if
formulated for all inferences.
I admit that certain formulations of mine must be re-stated to be really exact; but
all this is conﬁned to p. 277, note 12 (which is a silly note) and to pp. 279/280.
Everything else can stand as it is.
Following the review there is anotherf discussing in some detail a simpliﬁcation
of Quine’s quantiﬁcation theory. My much more radical simpliﬁcation of
quantiﬁcation theory (Quine’s, Gentzen’s or anybody’s) in “New Foundations”g is
not even mentioned.
Kind regards

Popper’s Correspondence with Willard Van
Orman Quine
Karl R. Popper and Willard V. O. Quine
Abstract Willard van Orman Quine (1908–2000) was an American logician and
philosopher working in the analytical tradition and shaping it in various respects.
Quine is well-known for his critical attitude towards modal logic, which makes
their conversation about Popper’s formalization of modal logic in Popper (1947d)
particularly interesting. The letter from Popper to Quine of 6 April 1948 is remarkable
for an indication of the demarcation between logic and mathematics. Popper says that
he has formulated inferential definitions for cardinal numbers; this would increase
the scope of his approach from logic to mathematics. However, this idea has not been
pursued in any of Popper’s subsequent publications, and we were not able to find
definite traces of this idea in his unpublished work either.
Editorial note: The correspondence between Popper and Quine is contained in KPS Box 340,
Folder 9 and in the Quine estate housed at the Houghton Library, Harvard University.

Dear Professor Quine,
Very many thanks for your off-prints. They are exciting and admirable. And so is
your last papera in the Journal ⟨of Symbolic Logic⟩on Nominalistic Mathematics.
Question: If we say that a formula exists (in a proof) even if it is not “inked”, so to
say: do not then infinitely many formulae exist?
I dislike Modal Logic as much as you do. Nevertheless, I give in the enclosed

Dear Prof. Popper,
Many thanks for your kind letter and the three offprints. I find your metalogical
method of introducing logical signs decidedly ingenious. It is, at the very least, an
illuminating way of presenting the subject. There is still a question in my mind how
much more it is than that. I fear it doesn’t, at least at the present stage, succeed really
in solving the problem of an objective distinction between logical and extra-logical
vocabulary, or between analytic and synthetic truth, though such seems to be your
purpose in your Aristotelian Society paperc. The loophole, to my way of thinking, is
at the top of p. 258, where “form-preserving interpretation” (which is needed for D3,
p. 264) is made to presuppose the notion of “proper translation” or “preservation of
meaning”. The concept of synonymy, here apparently an ultimate presupposition, is
in my estimate as badly off as analyticity itself; indeed, the two are readily
interdefinable.
I see no objection to your treatment of modalities in “Functional logic without
axioms . . .”d. It shows that your machinery of metalogical introduction is as
adequate to modalities as it is to truth-functions, etc. (Of course this does not imply
any translatability of modalities into extensional terms.)
To your question on uninked inscriptions: whether there are infinitely many will
depend on physics. If matter is either infinitely divisible or of infinite spatial and/or
temporal extent, there will be infinitely many uninked inscriptions, but otherwise not.
Sincerely yours,
W. V. Quine

(University of London)
Houghton Street, Aldwych, London, W.C.2
April 6th, 1948.
Dear Professor Quine,
So many thanks for your letter of March 21st. I am very grateful for your interest,
and most anxious for its continuation. I should like to discuss several of the points
you mention, but I realize that I must not take up more of your time than absolutely
necessary. I am sorry that I must trouble you with the request to re-consider your
criticism of my “Logic without Assumptions”e, but I shall try to be short.
You say quite rightly that any definition which makes use of the idea of a
form-preserving interpretation or of synonymy is as badly off as if it used analyticity
itself. All this is unquestionably true. But it does not constitute a criticism of my
paper. In fact, I say all this myself on p. 273. Down to the end of page 273, my paper
is only introductory; it is, down to this point, hardly more than a re-statement of
Tarski’s paper (as I have tried to explain). I myself say quite definitely on p. 271f. that
the distinction between formative and descriptive signs, and with it the idea of form
preserving interpretation, has to be got rid of.
The whole point of my paper is that this is possible; that “form-preserving
interpretation” can be reduced to “statement-preserving interpretation”. (I do not say
that the latter term is syntactical, on the contrary, I am aware – cp. note 18 – that my
“final definition” on p. 287 – with the same wording as D3, but with
“form-preserving” defined in terms of “statement-preserving” – is semantical. But
this is another problem.)
I should be extremely grateful to you if you could find the time to look at my
paper again, especially from p. 274 on. There may be many things which I have
overlooked, but I am quite sure that the point you mention is not one of them, and is
perfectly in order; moreover, that the point you mention is identical with the problem
explained at length in my paper on pp 271 to 273, as the fundamental problem which
I wish to solve.
I may mention that I have improved on this paper very considerably, by showing
that it is possible to use, in the metalanguage, at first only one undefined two-termed
predicate, “𝐷(𝑎, 𝑏)”, i.e., “𝑎is deducible from 𝑏”, and two formative signs (of the
metalanguage) “if-then” and “and”. We can |
2
then adopt the following rule:
No formative sign must be used in the metalanguage before it has been established
as formative by first formulating (in the metalanguage) a “defining formula” which
establishes that the corresponding sign of any object language is formative. (A
“defining formula” is one which, whenever the universal quantifier is available in the
metalanguage, can be shown to be equivalent to an explicit definition.)
e Popper (1947b).

498
Karl R. Popper and Willard V. O. Quine
I have also been able to give inferential definitions of (finite) cardinal numbers,
addition, etc., thereby showing that the figures and operators of ordinary arithmetic
may be claimed as formative signs.
May I say again how extremely grateful I should be for a second look at my paper,
and a few lines?
Very sincerely yours
30.4 Quine to Popper, 19 April 1948
Houghton Library. Typescript, 2p.
19 April 1948
Dear Professor Popper,
Thanks for pursuing the matter: I was indeed remiss. I have now gone over your
paper again, and find that various of the marginal notes which I had written in it on
first reading involved misunderstanding. I fear academic pressure has been too severe,
this term, for proper meditation.
I am still not satisfied with your theory, though: and, to whatever extent the
following criticisms evince a continuing misunderstanding on my part, I’ll appreciate
your continued efforts to set me right.
Your concept of “freely interpretable properties” puzzles me. From your
definition in note 16 I seem to be able to prove that any property 𝑃of statements is a
free property provided merely that it holds for some statement 𝑎of 𝐿1 and fails for
some statement 𝑏of 𝐿1. For, consider any partition of statements of 𝐿1 into exclusive
classes 𝐴and 𝐵. Interpretation of all members of 𝐴by 𝑎, and of all members of 𝐵by
𝑏, is a statement-preserving interpretation fulfilling the demands of your definition in
note 16.
If my reasoning is right, then the definition on your note 16 needn’t have been so
complex. In my ensuing remarks, however, I am going to turn my back on the
concept of freely interpretable properties, and accept “truth” uncritically.
Let us next consider the problem of the meaning of absolute validity of an
inference. In the light of D4, it seems demonstrable that absolute validity is
completely formulated by (6.1g) – to the exclusion of (6.2g), (6.3), and (6.4): The
three rules last mentioned are merely incidental observations about absolute validity:
the only absolutely valid inferences are inferences of the kind described in (6.1g).
Proof: Whenever the conclusion 𝑏is not one of the premisses 𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛, we can
get a statement-preserving counter example simply by interpreting each of
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛as “0 = 0” and 𝑏as “0 = 1”.
This being the case, you could have defined absolute validity much more simply
than in D4 or D5 – and without appealing either to “truth” or to “free property” or
even to “statement-preserving”. Viz: an inference is absolutely valid if and only if the
conclusion is one of the premisses.
Next let us consider how the sign “/” in the |
2
“inferential definitions” is to be
viewed. It cannot mean absolute validity of inference (if my foregoing result is right),

30 Popper’s Correspondence with Willard Van Orman Quine
499
for this would make the “inferential definitions” simply false. It cannot mean mere
validity of inference, for this is a notion which you are at pains not to presuppose.
Are we to take it merely as a notation for stating a rule of inference? But then your
“inferential definitions” cease to define such concepts as “same logical force as
negation of”, and become, instead, indistinguishable at bottom from old-fashioned
rules of inference governing primitive notations of negation etc. In this event, your
definition D6 of validity represents no philosophical advance over the old-fashioned
elucidation of validity by enumeration of a complete set of rules of inference relative
to a given notation.
I look forward with much interest to your clarification of these points.
Note the enclosed curiosity: your stamps came through uncancelled.
Sincerely yours,
30.5 Popper to Quine, 13 June 1948
KPS Box 36, Folder 23. Handwritten draft. A typescript version (with handwritten
corrections) was attached to a letter from Popper to Bernays; cf. this volume, § 21.8.
The two versions of this letter differ only with respect to some minor stylistic changes,
with the exception of the change indicated in a footnote, and a handwritten remark on
the side of p. 2 of the Bernays version, which reads: “To put the matter differently, we
can give, in the meta-metalanguage, a (finitist) criterion of truth for all these rules;
and this may be used as criterion or definition of validity.”
June 13th, 1948.
Dear Professor Quine,
I have been so awfully busy ever since I received your kind letter of April 19th
that I simply was physically unable to reply before.
My very best thanks for your letter. All your criticisms are justified, and although
I am perturbed at having blundered, I am extremely grateful to get your criticism.
I feel however still reasonably sure that I am, in the main, on the right track. In
other words, I think that my construction can easily be repaired. In fact, all that is
needed to repair it is to replace the very stupid footnote 12 (in Logic without
Assumptions) by another footnote, and to eliminate all reference to “free properties”,
by re-casting the footnote 16, and (D5).
In other words, I do not think that any of those later pages which contain what I
may perhaps call “my results” need to be changed. The main change is needed where
I try to define “absolute validity” without the use of truth – a point with which I have
dealt rather sketchily in any case; and your main objection, concerning the
inadequacy of “absolute validity” for my purpose, can be answered by pointing out
that although I have made a most misleading statement in footnote 12, and that I am
accordingly deserving of every blame, the main idea is tenable.
The reason why it is tenable is this: I meant by an “absolutely valid rule of
inference” (as indicated on pp. 282 and 285 (italics)), a rule of inference which is

500
Karl R. Popper and Willard V. O. Quine
valid irrespective of the logical form of the statements involved. Absolute validity in
this sense can be defined, and, I believe, does the trick.
An absolutely valid rule of inference, in the sense indicated, is a fortiori valid.
Accordingly
“𝑎/𝑏→𝑏/𝑎”
for instance cannot be an absolutely valid rule of inference in my sense since it is not
valid. (I have mislead my readers into believing that it is my intention that such a rule
is absolutely valid.)
The distinction which must be made is between rules about assertions about
absolute validity and rules of inference which are absolutely valid. For example, the
above rule is invalid, but something like
⌜𝑎/𝑏is absolutely valid →𝑏/𝑎is absolutely valid⌝
would, indeed, be true.
In other words, I never intended
“𝑎/𝑏”
to mean “the inference with the premise 𝑎and the conclusion 𝑏is valid”; I intended
it to mean, simply, “𝑏follows from 𝑎”; and I asked for a definition of the truth, i.e.
the validity (or absolute validity) of such a statement. Thus a rule of inference is
absolutely valid if and only if it remains valid after elimination of all references to
the logical structure; or in other words, if all statement-preserving interpretations of
the rule are valid.
All that is needed, therefore, is to characterize (without reference to the concept of
a formative sign) the system of rules which have the property that all
statement-preserving interpretations are valid. And this is, surely, a problem which
can be solved.
In the correction note which I enclose, the solution is clumsy; this is due (a) to my
general clumsiness, (b) to a desperate lack of time (and appalling working
conditions).
I do not intend to send this notice to the Editor of the Aristotelian Society at once,
and if you could give me your critical comments soon, I should be most grateful.
I have nobody here whom I could ask to discuss my papers and problems with me
before publication. This is a terrible draw back. Bernays, the only one with whom I
ever discussed anything technical – he is of course an ideal help – is in Zurich, and I
have not seen him for 15 months. He wrote shortly after you along very similar
lines.f You will understand how extremely grateful I was for your letter, and how
much I hope that you will write to me again.
Very sincerely yours,
K. R. Popper
f In the handwritten draft: “He wrote shortly after you along very similar lines, but he takes even
longer, often much longer, to reply to a letter or paper than I do. (I have no right to blame anybody.)”

30.5.1 Corrections to Logic without Assumptions
KPS Box 36, Folder 23. Handwritten, 14p. Popper sent a very similar list of errata to
Bernays; cf. this volume, § 21.8.1.
Corrections to “Logic without Assumptions”.
Professor W. Quine has very kindly drawn my attention tog certain objections
against my paper, and Prof. P. Bernays has raised the same objections. It appears to
me that some of these objections (against the concept of a “free property”, i.e.
against definition (D5) and note 16 of the paper) are completely justified, and that the
others, even though they may be met, nevertheless show that some of my
formulations were, to say the least, conductive of a misunderstanding. It seems to me,
however, that all my conclusions remain unaffected; the necessary alterations, it
seems to me, are all confined to pp. 277, 279, 280. (Besides these important
corrections, I wish to draw attention to one particularly misleading erratum on
p. 292: in line 7 from end, read “object” instead of “meta”.)
Whether my critics will agree with me that their objections are met by the
alterations here proposed I do not know.
|
2
p. 277, shift the phrase “covered by this definition,” from line 10 to line 9 (before
“and”), and put in its place, in line 10, the following: “i.e., of rules which are valid
independently of the logical form of the statements involved (cp. the second
paragraph of section 7, below),”
same page: replace footnote 12 by the following new footnote:
“12 We must be careful not to confound rules of inference which are absolutely
valid (and therefore valid) with rules about assertions about absolutely valid
inference. For example, |
3
a rule like the following holds:
“If, for certain statements 𝑎and 𝑏, the assertion that 𝑎is deducible from 𝑏is
absolutely valid, then, for the same statements the assertion that 𝑏is deducible from
𝑎is absolutely valid also.”
But the corresponding rule of inference “If, for certain statements 𝑎and 𝑏, 𝑎is
deducible from 𝑏, then, for the same statements, 𝑏is deducible from 𝑎.” is invalid,
and therefore not absolutely valid.
In order to define “absolutely valid rule of inference” in such a way that it
⟨covers⟩only rules of inference which are valid irrespective of the formative signs
which occur in the |
4
various statements involved, we first distinguish atomic and
molecular rules. Using the symbolism introduced in the next paragraph of the text,
“𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” and “𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑎1” are examples of atomic rules (invalid
and valid respectively).
Examples of molecular rules are:
(A) “𝑎/𝑎and 𝑏/𝑎”
(invalid)
(B) “𝑎/𝑎and 𝑏/𝑏and (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐/𝑐or 𝑐/𝑐)”
(valid)
(C) “If 𝑎/𝑎then 𝑎/𝑏”
(invalid)
g “drawn my attention to” replaces (?) “informed me of”, which is not crossed out.

502
Karl R. Popper and Willard V. O. Quine
(D) “If 𝑎/𝑏and 𝑏/𝑐, then 𝑎/𝑐”
(valid)
(A) and (B) we call simply conjunctive rules, (C) and (D) we call simply conditional
rules. We shall also use the term “component rule”, |
5
“antecedent (rule)”,
“consequent (rule)”, in an obvious way. Note that in our “simply conditional rules”,
the consequent must be atomic, and the antecedent either atomic or simply
conjunctive.
We now can define absolute validity for atomic, conjunctive, and conditional rules:
An atomic rule is absolutely valid if and only if no statement-preserving
counter-example of it exists, that is to say, if and only if no statement-preserving
interpretation of it is a counter-example.
A simply conjunctive rule is absolutely valid if, and only if, all its components are
absolutely valid.
A simply conditional rule is absolutely valid if and only if every
statement-preserving interpretation which turns its consequent into a counter
example also turns its antecedent into a counter-example. (We assume that a
counter-example of a component of a conjunctive rule is a counter example of the
whole conjunctive rule; this allows us to deal with a conjunctive antecedent.)
|
6
It can be easily seen ⟨that⟩these definitions lay down necessary as well as
sufficient conditions for the rules under consideration to be absolutely valid. The
definitions cover most of the cases in which we are interested. In order to extend it to
all intended cases, we define next:
A rule of inference 𝑅0 is called “secondary to the rules of inference
𝑅1, 𝑅2, . . . , 𝑅𝑛” if and only if every inference drawn in observance with 𝑅0 can be
drawn in observance of 𝑅1, 𝑅2, . . . , 𝑅𝑛(without appealing to 𝑅0).
|
7
According to this definition, every rule is secondary to itself.
We now can give a general definition of absolutely valid rules as follows:
A rule of inference is absolutely valid if and only if it is secondary to atomic,
simply conjunctive and simply conditional rules which are absolutely valid in the
sense defined above.”
(This concludes note 12)
|
8
p 279–280 replace the passage from the word “For” in line 17 on p 270 to the
end of line 19 on p 280 by the following:
“For it turns out that (D4) is equivalent to the following definition:
(D5) An inference is absolutely valid if, and only if, the conclusion is one of the
premises.
This definition avoids the term “truth”, but it should be observed that it is of any
use only because we can show nevertheless that it guarantees the transmission of
truth from the premisses to the conclusion.
As it stands, (D5) is not very helpful; what we need is, rather, |
9
the corresponding
idea of an absolutely valid rule of inference defined with the help of (D5) or of an
equivalent definition.
|
10
In order to achieve this end, we can introduce the idea of a statement-preserving
numerical interpretation of an inference or a rule of inference. This is an
interpretation which identifies each of the 𝑚different statements (or variables)
occuring in the inference (or rule) with one of the first 𝑚natural numbers, and which

30 Popper’s Correspondence with Willard Van Orman Quine
503
interprets the expression “𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛/𝑏” to mean “one at least of the numbers
𝑎1, 𝑎2, . . . , 𝑎𝑛is at least equal to number 𝑏.” We can, further, define a
statement-preserving (numerical) counter-example of an inference or rule of
inference as a statement-preserving numerical interpretation which is an
arithmetically false statement.16
|
11
We can now replace (D5) by the definition
(D5′) An inference (or rule of inference) is absolutely valid if, and only if, no
statement preserving numerical counter-example of it exists.
The search for such a counter-example must, in every particular case, lead after a
finite number of steps to a decision concerning the absolute validity of the particular
rule in question.17 (The method is somewhat similar to that of deciding a formula of
the propositional calculus by way of truth-tables.) It can be easily shown, |
12
for
example, that upon our definition (D5) of absolute validity which avoids any
reference to truth, the rules (6.1g) and (6.2g) are absolutely valid, and similarly (6.6),
and the rules analogous to it.18 ”
(This concludes the text-correction on pp 279–280. The remaining corrections are
to the notes 16, 17 and 18 on these two pages, and a new note, 23a, on p. 284.)
|
13
p 279, note 16, replace this note by the following new note:
For instance, a counter example of the rule “If 𝑎/𝑏then 𝑏/𝑎” is “If 2/1 then 1/2”.
The use of the words “arithmetically false” does not (as it may appear) re-introduce
the words “true” and “false” which we intended to eliminate; the words we intended
to eliminate refer to the statements 𝑎1, 𝑎2, etc. of the interpretations; those which we
retain refer to such arithmetical statements as “1/2” i.e., “1 is at least as great as 2”.
(In other words, the problem is shifted to the metalanguage.)
p 280, note 17: replace this note by the following new note:
If the number of variables is considerable, the search for a counter-example may,
of course, be long. But it is usually quite easy to design methods by which the
procedure can be simplified. For example, in order to construct a counter-example of
the invalid rule
“(If 𝑎/𝑏then 𝑐/𝑑) then (if 𝑎, 𝑎1/𝑏then 𝑐, 𝑎1/𝑑)”
we first interpret the last consequent “𝑐, 𝑎1/𝑑” by “1, 1/2”. Since this does not
lead to a counter-example of the rule we next choose “1, 2/3” instead of “1, 1/2”;
and this, indeed, leads to the counter-example “(If 1/2 then 1/3) then (if 1, 2/2 then
1, 2/3)”. (This in turn can be evaluated by the truth-table method.)
|
13
p 280, note 18: Replace the words from “since” in line 4 of the note to
“Altogether” in line 11 of the note by the word “But”.
|
14
p 284, line 23, insert a new note-sign “23a” after “necessary”, and append to the
bottom of the page the new note:
“But we may, if we wish (in order to avoid such definitions as (7.8) lay down that,
for every numerical interpretation of the variables to which the definiendum refers,
there exists one and only one true statement preserving numerical interpretation of
the whole defining formula which renders this formula true. (‘For every 𝑏’ or ‘For
every 𝑐’ etc., has to be interpreted – if we wish to avoid such definitions as 7.8 – by

504
Karl R. Popper and Willard V. O. Quine
the phrase: ‘For every number which exceeds the other numbers used in the
interpretation by not more than 1.’)”
30.6 Quine to Popper, 5 October 1948
Houghton Library. Typescript, 1p.
Oct. 5, 1948
Dear Professor Popper,
I am sorry to have delayed so long over your letter of June 13. Last summer I was
much involved in preparing a draft of my work in progress (theory of deduction)
so that it could me mimeographed for my fall course. Toward the end of the summer I
got married. When finally I did sit down to undertake a belated answer, I was away
from your reprints and so couldn’t understand your letter.
It is clear that the revisions which you propose constitute a great improvement,
and meet various of the objections raised in my letter of April 19. I have no criticism
to make of your revisions, as far as they go.
However, it seems to me that the criticism made in the last long paragraph of my
letter of April 19 is still not met. Perhaps I am missing something.
I am returning your typescript of corrections, since it is an original; I hope my
holding it so long hasn’t meant great inconvenience.
I am sending you some reprints.
Sincerely yours,
30.7 Popper to Quine, 28 November 1948
Houghton Library. Typescript with letterhead of LSE, 1p.
November 28th, 1948.
Dear Professor Quine,
I wish, first of all, to congratulate you on the occasion of your marriage. I have
been married for 18 years, and I can only say that I could not imagine myself living
without my wife. (I say this even though she will have to type this letter.)
Next I wish to thank you for your off-prints. I cannot tell you how much I (and my
best students) enjoy your writings; but these last papers on Ontology are just
wonderful – sheer pleasure. There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the most
telling contributions of logic to philosophy yet. Besides, it alone brings fully to the
fore the philosophical significance of Russell’s theory of description (enforced by
your earlier brilliant suggestion of a language in which all proper names are replaced
by predicates which I now describe to my students as “proper-name-abstracts”). I can
say, without exaggeration, that I have not enjoyed any philosophic application of
logic (at least not since Tarski’s Wahrheitsbegriff) as much as yours.

Thirdly, many thanks for your kind words concerning my attempts to repair my
paper.
Very sincerely yours,

pher and logician who established the study of logic as an independent subject
by founding Germany’s first research institute for logic, in Münster. Since he also
contributed to the historiography of logic, he was well acquainted with the work of
Paul Hertz and Gerhard Gentzen. (For further information on Scholz cf. Peckhaus,
2018.) In the letter that we reproduce here, he points out what he regards as a close
relationship between Popper’s work and the work of Hertz.

Lieber Herr Popper, herzlichen Dank. Es ist schön, dass wir nun wieder mit
einander verbunden sind und dass wir an einander teilnehmen können. Es scheint mir,
dass hinter Ihrem Bericht wieder einmal ein echter Popper steht, und ich bitte Sie
sehr, dass Sie uns nicht vergessen, wenn die angekündigte Publikation erschienen ist.
Die Nähe, in der Sie zu den uns wohlvertrauten Konstruktionen von Paul Her⟨t⟩z und

Dear Mr Popper, thank you very much. It is nice that we are now connected once
again and that we can exchange our ideas. It seems to me that behind your report
there is once again a real Popper, and I very kindly ask you not to forget us when the
announced publication has appeared. The closeness in which you stand to the
constructions of Paul Her⟨t⟩z and Mr Tarski, with which we are well acquainted,
greatly facilitates our perusal of your interesting approach. In the meantime, Mr
Bernays was with us for 14 days in September. We still think back to those nice days
with a special pleasure.
With all the best for you
Yours
Heinrich Scholz

Popper’s Correspondence with Peter
Schroeder-Heister
Karl R. Popper and Peter Schroeder-Heister
Abstract Peter Schroeder-Heister (b. 1953) is a German philosopher and logician
whose research focuses on the foundations of deductive reasoning, in particular in the
field he has called proof-theoretic semantics (cf. Schroeder-Heister, 2018; Piecha and
Wehmeier, 2022). He worked at the universities of Konstanz and Tübingen, where he
has held a professorship in Logic and Philosophy of Language since 1989. Shortly
after his Dr. phil. at the University of Bonn in 1981, which he did under the supervision
of Gisbert Hasenjaeger (cf. this volume, § 13.10) with Dag Prawitz as an external
adviser, he hit upon Popper’s logical writings and realized that the inferentialism
advocated by Popper bears significant relationships to the idea of proof-theoretic
semantics. Subsequently, in 1982, he wrote a paper on Popper’s theory of deductive
inference stressing in particular the issue of demarcation of logical from extra-logical
signs (later published as Schroeder-Heister, 1984). Sending a draft of this paper to
Popper led to the correspondence reproduced here.

Sehr geehrter Herr Professor Popper,
durch Zufall bin ich auf Ihre Aufsätze aus den Jahren 1947–1949 zur Begründung
der Logik gestoßen. Die genaue Lektüre hat mir gezeigt, daß viele Ihrer Gedanken es
wert sind, erneut in die Diskussion gebracht zu werden. Denn das fundamentale
Problem, um das es Ihnen ging – die Abgrenzung logischer von deskriptiven
Konstanten –, wird in den letzten Jahren im Zusammenhang mit dem wachsenden
Interesse an philosophischer Semantik stark diskutiert, jedoch meist ohne Kenntnis
Ihrer Arbeiten.
Daher habe ich beiliegenden Aufsatz zur kritischen Rekonstruktion Ihrer
Gedanken und ihrer Einordnung in die moderne Diskussion verfaßt. Das Manuskript
selbst ist vorläufig; insbesondere soll es noch einen Anhang zur Quantorenlogik
erhalten. Trotzdem möchte ich es Ihnen senden, da Sie sich vielleicht für die
Fortentwicklung Ihrer Gedanken interessieren. Sollten Sie Zeit haben, einen Blick
hineinzuwerfen, wäre ich Ihnen für einen Kommentar dankbar.
Ich hoffe, das Manuskript in absehbarer Zeit endgültig fertigzustellen und an eine
philosophische Zeitschrift zu senden, entweder an das „British Journal for the
Philosophy of Science“, „Mind“ oder „Erkenntnis“.
Ich reise übrigens heute abend noch ab nach Berlin, um an einem Kolloquium
teilzunehmen, das der Physiologe Prof. Grüsser aus Anlaß Ihres 80. Geburtstages
veranstaltet, und hoffe, dort einige Gedanken zu Ihrer Philosophie vortragen zu
können.
Mit freundlichen Grüßen und herzlichen
Glückwünschen zu Ihrem 80. Geburtstag

Dear Professor Popper,
By chance I came across your articles from the years 1947–1949 on the
justification of logic. A close reading has shown to me that many of your thoughts
are worth bringing back into discussion. The fundamental problem you were
concerned with – the demarcation of logical from descriptive constants – has been
the subject of vigorous discussion in recent years in connection with the growing
interest in philosophical semantics, but mostly without knowledge of your works.
Therefore I have written the enclosed article on the critical reconstruction of your
thoughts and their integration into contemporary discussion. The manuscript itself is
preliminary; in particular, it will be expanded by an appendix on quantifier logic.
Nevertheless, I would like to send it to you, since you may be interested in the further

32 Popper’s Correspondence with Peter Schroeder-Heister

development of your thoughts. Should you have time to take a look at it, I would be
grateful for a comment.
I hope to finalize the manuscript in the foreseeable future and to send it to a
philosophical journal, either to the “British Journal for the Philosophy of Science”,
“Mind” or “Erkenntnis”.
By the way, I am leaving for Berlin this evening to take part in a colloquium
organized by the physiologist Prof. Grüsser on the occasion of your 80th birthday,
and I hope to present some thoughts on your philosophy there.
With kind regards, and heartfelt
congratulations on your 80th birthday

Sehr geehrter Herr Schroeder-Heister,
herzlichen Dank für Ihren Brief vom 1. Juli 1982 und für Ihr großes Interesse. Ich
wurde damals dadurch entmutigt, daß Alfred Tarski, den ich sehr verehre, diese
Arbeiten nicht ansehen wollte. Ich hatte sonst niemanden.
Kurz vor seinem Tod lernte ich in Brüssel McKinsey kennen. Wir freundeten uns
an: er sprach zuerst zu mir und sagte mir, daß seine Kritikb dieser Arbeiten nicht
ganz fair war und daß doch mehr in ihnen steckt. Ich erinnere mich, daß wir von
Brüssel zusammen nach Paris fuhren und dort im selben Hotel wohnten; auch, daß er
mich zum Zug brachte als ich von Paris in die Schweiz fuhr. Er wollte, daß ich zu
dieser Arbeit zurückfinde. Aber bevor das geschah starb er.
Aber es gibt natürlich einige interessante unveröffentlichte Resultate. Diese unter

related to Tarski and McKinsey. As this information, which is more than three decades old, is in
no way negative and highly interesting for somebody studying the reception of Popper’s logical
writings, the recipient of the letter considered it appropriate to release it for publication.

Dear Mr Schroeder-Heister,
Thank you very much for your letter of 1 July 1982, and for your great interest. I
was discouraged at the time by the fact that Alfred Tarski, whom I admire very much,
did not want to have a look at these works. I had no one else.
Shortly before his death I met McKinsey in Brussels. We became friends: he first
spoke to me and told me that his criticismb of these works was not quite fair and that
there was more in them after all. I remember that we went together from Brussels to
Paris and stayed there in the same hotel; also that he brought me to the train when I
departed from Paris to Switzerland. He wanted me to find my way back to this work.
But before that happened he died.
But of course there are some interesting unpublished results. To find these among
my papers would be a big job. Rather, I could perhaps describe them to you one day,
preferably orally.
But at the moment I am mainly interested in other things. Only in one point my
current interests touch remotely with those of that time: when are definitions
uninteresting and when are they interesting?
If you publish your MS, please quote what I say in my Unended Questd about this
episode.

Lieber Herr Schroeder-Heister,
Eben habe ich Ihre Arbeit durchgelesen. Ich finde sie ausgezeichnet. Sie haben
ganz recht, mein erstes Ziel war die Charakterisierung der logischen Zeichen
(formative signs). Aber dann schien es mir daß, falls man damit Erfolg hat, man
gleich die Aussagenlogik begründen kann; und irgendwie geht das auch, wenn es
auch ein gesonderter Schritt ist. (Aber darüber ein andermal mehr.)
Ihr Artikel ist ausgezeichnet geschrieben, auch rein sprachlich. Inhaltlich scheint
mir, nach einer Lesung, alles richtig zu sein.
Philosophisch waren diese Untersuchungen (für deren teilweisen Mißerfolg ich
mich schämte) sehr wichtig für mich, da sie mich in meinem tentativen
Antirelativismus einigermaßen (= tentativ) bestärkten; insbesondere der Nachweis,
der mir wichtig schien, daß in einer Sprache, die die klassiche Negation enthält (und
das tut die intuitionistische Logik) „¬cl𝑎//¬int𝑎“ gilt. Aber meines Wissens hat
niemand außer Ihnen dieses Resultat gesehen. (Ich kenne die Literatur nicht, außer
McKinsey.) Zu Ihrer Anm. 15): you will find that the metalinguistic use of ∀and →
needed for their full object-linguistic use is greatly restricted. [You mention
𝐴→(𝐵→𝐴).] Hier liegt in der Tat etwas Ähnliches vor wie in Hilbert’s
Programm, eine finite Begründung für einen nicht-finiten Kalkül zu finden.
Besten Dank für dieses schöne Geburtstagsgeschenk!

Dear Mr Schroeder-Heister,
I have just finished reading your work. I find it excellent. You are quite right, my
first goal was the characterization of the logical signs (formative signs). But then it
seemed to me that, if one succeeds with it, one can immediately justify propositional
logic; and somehow this is possible, although it is a separate step. (But more about
this at another time.)
Your article is excellently written, also in terms of language. Contentwise, after
one reading, everything seems to me to be correct.
Philosophically these investigations (for whose partial failure I was ashamed)
were very important for me, because they strengthened me to some extent (=
tentatively) in my tentative antirelativism; especially the demonstration, which
seemed important to me, that in a language, which contains classical negation (and
this is the case for intuitionistic logic) “¬cl𝑎//¬int𝑎” holds. But to my knowledge, no
one but you has seen this result. (I do not know the literature, except for McKinsey.)
Concerning your note 15): you will find that the metalinguistic use of ∀and →
needed for their full object-linguistic use is greatly restricted. [You mention
𝐴→(𝐵→𝐴).] There is indeed something similar here as in Hilbert’s programme
of finding a finite justification for a non-finite calculus.
Thank you very much for this nice birthday present!
Yours, Karl Popper

16. Augustf. Sehr schönen Dank. Ich finde ihn ausgezeichnet. Er scheint mir mehr als
f Letter accompanying a photocopy of an earlier version of Schroeder-Heister (1984) which was

vier fünftel (!) meiner alten Intuitionen, Ziele und Hoffnungen zu realisieren, und das
übrige fünftel – was Sie „die Begründung der Logik“ nennen – möglich zu machen.
(Meine eigene „Begründung“ der klassischen Logik als Organon der Kritik
⟨Popper, 1972, p. 64⟩ist, daß sie das stärkste System der retransmission of falsity ist,
und daß wir in der Wissenschaft die schärfste Kritik brauchen.) (Für Beweise in der
Mathematik ist es von Interesse, die schwächsten Axiomensysteme zu verwenden
und auch die schwächsten Ableitungsregeln; und das macht z.B. die intuitionistische
Mathematik und die Minimallogik interessant.) Selbstverständlich haben Sie die
Erlaubnis, die beiden Fußnoten einzufügenf.
Aus dem unpublished matter:
The fundamental difference between propositional logic and functional logic
seems to be this: in functional logic, deductive or inferential power (/) is not enough.
We have to use, in addition, =, to express identity of shape. Perhaps this can be done
after defining = inferentially (i.e. object-linguistic identity). What we need is, for

Dear Colleague,
Your letter of 16 Augustf just arrived (together with a huge amount of letters,
some of them important). Thank you very much. I find it excellent. It seems to me to
realize more than four-fifths (!) of my old intuitions, goals, and hopes, and to make
the remaining fifth – what you call “the justification of logic” – possible.
(My own “justification” of classical logic as organon of criticism ⟨Popper, 1972,
p. 64⟩is that it is the strongest system of retransmission of falsity, and that in science
we need the sharpest criticism.) (For proofs in mathematics it is of interest to use the
weakest axiom systems and also the weakest inference rules; and this makes e.g.
submitted to the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. It contained a request for consent to
publish two footnotes quoting from letters by Popper (= footnotes 2 and 25 in the printed version).
