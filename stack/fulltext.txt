This study was designed to examine the effects of different geographical 
background contexts for information on comprehension, recall, and cognitive load. Two 
different contexts, American geographical background and Korean geographical 
background, were employed to frame explanations of global warming phenomena. 
Students‘ comprehension was calibrated by two different levels of measurement, which 
were fact-level learning (shallow understanding) and inference-making (deep 
understanding). Cognitive load was gauged by self-reported levels of motivation, 
difficulty, and mental effort. It was hypothesized that an American context would be 
more familiar and Korean context less familiar for American students. It was also 
hypothesized that unfamiliar contexts would create disadvantages in comprehension, 
recall, and cognitive load, but that signaling would improve comprehension and recall 
and reduce cognitive load, especially in unfamiliar contexts.  
Students from two educational psychology courses were randomly assigned to 
one of four groups in which they read one of the four different types of passages online: 
an American signaled passage, an American nonsignaled passage, a Korean signaled 
passage, and a Korean nonsignaled passage. Participants took comprehension and recall 
tests and reported their perceived levels of motivation, difficulty, and mental effort in the 

 
 
same online environment. Results were analyzed by MANCOVA (multivariate analysis 
of covariance). The analyses revealed that (1) students were significantly more confident 
in their American geographical prior knowledge, which was interpreted as an indicator 
that an American context for information was more familiar to them; (2) context 
familiarity had positive effects on students‘ levels of inference-making, their self-
reported levels of motivation, and perceived levels of difficulty; and (3) signaling had a 
negative effect on inference-making. An expertise reversal effect was noted for 
participants‘ deep understanding. The findings of the current study imply that learning 
materials that are framed within an unfamiliar context can create disadvantages for 
students‘ motivation and deep comprehension. Future research is needed to find ways for 
compensating for those disadvantages.

Chapter I 
Introduction 
A body of research from the perspective of schema theory has shown how 
readers‘ perspectives and prior knowledge are important in comprehending and 
remembering what they read. Anderson and his colleagues (Anderson, 1978; Anderson & 
Pearson, 1984; Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, & Goetz, 1977), Bransford and Johnson 
(1972), and Rumelhart (1981), for example, have shown that readers‘ prior knowledge 
and the perspectives suggested for readers, as well as titles provided for ambiguous 
passages can have significant effects not only on the amount of information readers 
remember but also on what they comprehend.  
Applied to reading, the basic premise of schema theory is that readers‘ prior 
knowledge and their schemata will have significant effects on what they comprehend 
when they read and on what they will later remember. In other words, how well readers 
comprehend and remember what they read is contingent on how well readers‘ prior 
knowledge is induced. The cultural schemata readers possess are one of the many factors 
that help evoke their prior knowledge. Culturally familiar text more easily activates 
readers‘ prior knowledge and thus it is more easily comprehended and remembered. 
Pritchard (1990), Reynolds, Taylor, Steffensen, Shirey, and Anderson (1982) and 
Steffensen, Joag-Dev, and Anderson (1979), for instance, have shown the importance of 
cultural schemata in comprehending and remembering discourse. Likewise, familiar 
context activates readers‘ prior knowledge. Information appearing in more familiar 
contexts is better recalled because the familiar context makes it easier to arouse a reader‘s 

2 
 
schemata and in turn, the schemata play an important role in remembering and 
comprehending the text contents (Freebody & Anderson, 1983).  
Context has been defined in a variety of ways across studies. For example, 
researchers have considered words, sentences, paragraphs, a whole story, settings, and 
culture as context. Overall, context has been shown to have a significant effect on 
outcomes ranging from word recognition (e.g., Stanovich & West, 1981) and vocabulary 
learning (e.g., Beck, Mckeown, & McCaslin, 1983) to reading comprehension (e.g., 
Carey, Harste, & Smith, 1981).  
The present study examined the role of context in comprehension and recall. 
Context in this study was defined by two different geographical backgrounds used in text 
materials describing the global warming phenomenon. It was assumed that for American 
college students, information situated in a geographically familiar context (i.e., in the 
context of a U. S. geographical illustration) would be better comprehended and better 
recalled than information presented in geographically less familiar context (in the context 
of Korean geographical illustration). This assumption can easily be made and nothing is 
new here.  
In the present study, however, two different kinds of text (geographically familiar 
text vs. unfamiliar text) were investigated with the perspective of cognitive load theory. 
According to cognitive load theory, individuals have limited working memory and their 
learning cannot be efficient if the processes of learning exceed the capacity of working 
memory for any reason (Chandler & Sweller, 1996; Sweller, 1988). Based on that 
assumption, in the current study, it was hypothesized that a geographically unfamiliar 
context (Korean context) would generate more cognitive load for American students than 

3 
 
a familiar (American) context and those readers who encounter information situated in an 
unfamiliar context would be disadvantaged.  
In some educational situations, such as teaching geography and history, 
encounters with unfamiliar cultural and foreign geographical context are unavoidable and 
even desirable. In those instances, ways need to be found to boost readers‘ understanding 
and remembering. In the present study, signaling was suggested as a way of reducing 
cognitive load caused by unfamiliar context and optimizing readers‘ comprehension and 
recall. Signaling is typically designed to guide readers to important content or structure 
and makes the content and the relationships clearer without changing the content itself 
(Loman & Meyer, 1983; Meyer, 1975). Thus, in the present study, it was also 
hypothesized that signaling could reduce cognitive load as well as improve 
comprehension and recall, especially in unfamiliar contexts. The sections following 
provide a brief summary of each of the major theoretical perspectives important to the 
current study, beginning with schema theory.   
Roles of Schemata in Comprehension 
A schema (plural schemata) is defined as a knowledge framework that represents 
a class of things, events and situations (Anderson, 1978). A reader‘s understanding is 
facilitated when a schema provides an interpretive framework that helps individuals 
interpret data, retrieve information from memory, and determine goals and subgoals 
(Anderson & Pearson, 1984; Rumelhart, 1981). According to schema theorists, to 
comprehend stories and texts, readers should bring schemata that provide good 
explanations about the objects and events in the passages. Rumelhart (1981), for example, 
addressed the importance of schemata by identifying three reasons that readers might not 

4 
 
correctly understand a passage. If readers do not have proper schemata, and if the clues in 
the passage are not enough to activate the readers‘ schemata even though they have 
proper ones, a text cannot be fully understood. At the same time, however, if readers 
bring schemata to their reading that are not the ones the author intended, they will have a 
problem understanding the passage.   
It is also generally accepted that schemata facilitate encoding and retrieval. If 
readers employ appropriate schemata at the time of reading, the reading materials will be 
more effectively encoded by helping information get encoded more precisely and by 
enabling readers to be attentive to more important text elements. Similarly, a schema can 
help individuals retrieve information more successfully by facilitating a search of 
memory, providing the standard for editing out unimportant information and allowing 
inferential reconstruction (Anderson, Pichert, & Shirey 1983). Thus, information will be 
retrieved more easily through the assistance of schemata. 
Schemata smooth the progress of understanding as well. The way readers 
comprehend a passage depends on what they know. Readers who have appropriate 
schemata about the reading material can easily make connections between what they are 
reading and what they know. In other words, if reading materials effectively evoke 
readers‘ schemata or their prior knowledge, they will be easily understood and 
remembered, but if they don‘t, readers will face difficulties. Therefore, schema theorists 
argue that a reader‘s schema provides an interpretative framework for comprehending 
discourse, and that schema theory provides a good explanation of how familiar situations 
are comprehended more easily (Anderson, Wang, & Gaffney, 2006; Freebody & 
Anderson, 1983).   

5 
 
One often-used example that evokes familiar situations and offers a variety of 
relevant schemata is culture. Several studies showed the importance of cultural schemata 
in comprehending written materials (Pritchard, 1990; Reynolds, Taylor, Steffensen, 
Shirey, & Anderson, 1982; Steffensen, Joag-Dev, Anderson, 1979). Culturally familiar 
text was more easily understood and remembered because the text easily evokes readers‘ 
background knowledge and relevant schemata. If readers do not have appropriate cultural 
schemata, however, they can misunderstand the text. The study by Steffensen, Joag-Dev, 
and Anderson (1979) showed the importance of cultural schemata in reading 
comprehension. In their study, American students and Indian students read two letters 
about a wedding: one was about an American wedding and the other about an Indian 
wedding. Results showed that students remembered and elaborated more information 
from their respective native passages whereas they distorted more information from the 
foreign passage.  
In summary, according to schema theorists, schemata are indispensable for 
discourse comprehension because understanding discourse depends on the processes of 
activating or constructing schemata that gives a good account for objects and events in a 
text (Anderson, 1984).  
Context Effects on Learning 
The term context has been defined differently in many studies according to their 
purposes, but the term can be described most directly with respect to text materials in two 
ways. Context narrowly includes a word, a sentence, or a passage in a text that make the 
meaning of a certain part of discourse clear, but context also broadly comprises a set of 
facts or circumstances that are implied within a certain segment of discourse. 

6 
 
Accordingly, discourse cannot be understood without acquiring contextualized 
knowledge about it (Bruning, Schraw, & Norby, 2011). 
A body of research has been conducted to examine the effect of context on word 
identification, word recognition, lexical decision, new vocabulary acquisition and reading 
comprehension. In order to examine the context effect on word recognition and lexical 
decision, a narrow meaning of context was used such as a single word (e.g., Meyer & 
Schvaneveldt, 1971) and a sentence frame (e.g., Kleiman, 1980). On the other hand, a 
more broad meaning of context was employed when the effect of context on new 
vocabulary learning and reading comprehension. Usually, in the field of new vocabulary 
learning, context refers to the content in which an unknown word is inserted (e.g.,Nagy, 
Anderson, & Herman, 1987), but context in reading comprehension also is provided by 
background knowledge (Bransford & Johnson, 1972), settings (Carey, Harste, & Smith, 
1981) and culture (Steffensen, Joag-dev, & Anderson, 1979) in reading comprehension.  
Early studies verified that even the context provided by a single word could 
facilitate word identification, with significantly shorter times when two words were 
associated (e.g., James, 1975; Schvaneveldt & Meyer, 1973). Similarly, the reaction time 
is shorter in lexical decision when an appropriate sentence frame context was offered 
(Kleiman, 1980). However, Kintsch and Mross (1985) demonstrated that the associative 
context (the association strength between two words) and thematic context (the meaning 
of the discourse) influenced word identification and lexical decisions differently 
depending on the amount of time allowed. Lexical decisions were contingent on the 
thematic context when enough time is provided (sense selection) while the associative 

7 
 
context was more heavily relied on when the decision needed to be made quickly (sense 
activation).    
Regarding new vocabulary learning, most scholars agree that people learn the 
majority of new vocabulary incidentally from context with only a small amount of 
vocabulary growth ascribed to vocabulary instruction. However, it was not easy to obtain 
a significant effect of context on vocabulary learning in experimental settings due to the 
limited exposure to a passage and new vocabularies in restricted time. People usually 
gain only a little of their knowledge of a word when they encounter the word the first 
time, so learning vocabulary from context typically takes place in small increments 
(Nagy, Anderson, & Herman, 1987). However, this small increase can result in large 
vocabulary growth with a sufficient volume of reading (Nagy, Herman, and Anderson, 
1985).   
Reading comprehension cannot be achieved unless readers add contextual 
information to the reading materials (Bransford & Johnson, 1972). Contextual 
information could be extracted from readers‘ prior knowledge, settings, culture and 
needless to say, it is acquired from reading material itself. Prior knowledge is an essential 
element that helps readers construct meaning from text. Also, settings in which reading 
occurs help readers draw the necessary relations between concepts in the text and the 
environments. Similarly, a cultural background of the reading material evokes readers‘ 
cultural knowledge. Therefore, appropriate background knowledge (McKewon, Beck, 
Sinatra, & Loxterman, 1992), settings (Carey, Harste, & Smith, 1981), and cultural 
background (Steffensen, Joag-dev, & Anderson, 1979) can serve as context and improve 
reading comprehension. In brief, context generally facilitates word recognition, lexical 

8 
 
decision, learning new vocabulary and reading comprehension, irrespective of whether a 
context is a word, a sentence, settings, and culture.  
Signaling Effects on Learning 
A number of studies have examined the effect of signaling on attention, recall, 
and reading comprehension. In those studies, the term of signaling was used to refer to 
the addition of noncontent words that emphasize certain aspects of the semantic content, 
structure or organization of the passage (Loman & Meyer, 1983). In general, signaling 
guides readers to focus on a certain aspect of content or structure without adding or 
changing the content and as a result, the readers can understand the content and the 
relationships in text more clearly (Meyer, 1975).  
One function of signaling is facilitating the selection process in text by assisting 
readers in making decisions about which information is significant. As a result, readers‘ 
attention is more invested in the signaled elements and the recall of them is enhanced as 
well. The function of signaling on attention and recall has been confirmed by several 
studies (e.g., Loman & Mayer, 1983; Lorch & Lorch, 1996; Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 
1993). The participants who read signaled version of text recalled significantly more 
signaled points than those who read nonsignaled version, presumably because signals 
direct readers to focus more on important information (Mautone & Mayer, 2001) and thus 
recall of that part was facilitated. However, several studies have failed to demonstrate 
positive signaling effects on overall text recall (e.g., Brooks, Dansereau, Spurlin, & 
Holley,1983; Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 1993). The recall of signaled information was 
increased whereas the recall of unsignaled information was decreased in the third 
experiment of Lorch and Lorch (1996)‘s study. They argue that organizational signals 

9 
 
such as overviews, summaries and headings did not increase overall recall because the 
unsignaled part received less attention and the recall for that part was reduced.   
Another function of signaling is smoothing the process of organizing information 
by making the relations in text clear (Lorch, 1989). Headings, list signals (e.g., first, 
second and finally), overviews, summaries and previews assist readers in forming 
coherent representation through serving as organizing devices. Because signaling 
enhances constructing coherent representation, readers‘ comprehension benefits from it. 
Studies that examined the effect of signals on readers‘ comprehension employed problem 
solving task (Loman & Mayer, 1983) and making inference problems (Spyridakis & 
Standal, 1987). Participants who read the text with signals performed better on those 
tasks.  
The other function of signaling is reducing cognitive load (Mautone & Mayer, 
2001). In other words, signaling helps readers invest fewer cognitive resources in 
selecting essential information and in integrating and organizing information in text. As a 
result, more cognitive capacity is left for constructing deeper representation and 
understanding the content. Readers‘ understanding and grasping important points about 
what they read thus are enhanced and improved.  
Optimization of Cognitive Load 
    Cognitive load theory (CLT) has been established on the assumption that 
human cognition has limited working memory and the idea that if learning materials 
exceed the capacity of working memory for any reason, learning outcomes will not be 
optimal. CLT has been used in devising methods for decreasing working memory load 
when individuals learn new materials (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 1991). A body of 

10 
 
research has attempted to find effective instructional methods that help learners fully 
invest available cognitive resources in learning (e.g., Chandler & Sweller, 1996; Paas & 
van Merriënboer, 1994a; Sweller, 1988). Accordingly, CLT has contributed to increasing 
the effectiveness of learning and decreasing unnecessary efforts that are not directly 
related to learning itself. A variety of instructional methods found based on cognitive 
load theory have shown learning outcomes to be enhanced when learning materials are 
well-integrated and learners‘ attention is not diverted away from key concepts.  
CLT has been explored in studies identifying drawbacks in conventional 
instruction, for example, means-ends processes in problem solving (Sweller, 1983; 
Sweller & Levine, 1982). Since the purpose of the means-ends analysis is primarily to 
attain the problem goal, it may not be particularly helpful for understanding relationships 
and learning the rules. Thus, this conventional instruction method may prevent schema 
construction, which is the crucial object of learning, through making the learners devote 
too many of their mental resources to attaining the goal. Sweller and Levine (1982) found 
that means-ends analysis imposed unnecessary effort that interfered with essential 
learning and that students learned more from goal-free problems than means-ends 
analysis.  
Successive studies demonstrated that other alternative instructional methods, such 
as worked examples (Cooper & Sweller, 1987; Paas, 1992; Paas & van Merriënboer, 
1994b; Sweller & Cooper, 1985) and completion problems (Paas, 1992; van Merriënboer, 
1990) were more effective methods in teaching and learning than the conventional 
instruction using means-ends analysis because those alternative instructional methods 
were designed to reduce cognitive load. Moreover, several practical findings, such as the 

11 
 
modality effect (reducing cognitive load by adopting two different modes of presentation, 
e.g., sweller, 1999), redundancy effect (decreasing cognitive load by eliminating 
redundant information, e.g., Chandler & Sweller, 1991), and expert reversal effect 
(providing additional information is redundant and has negative rather than positive 
effects for experts, e.g., Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler & Sweller, 2003) have been 
discovered. 
Research based on CLT suggests that learning is optimized by removing 
unnecessary load that is not relevant for schema construction. In other words, getting rid 
of unnecessary load facilitates schema construction and schema automation. Therefore, 
anything that gives unnecessary load should be eliminated whereas anything that helps 
schema construction and schema automation should be emphasized to enhance learning.   
The Present Study 
The present study was designed (1) to examine the effects of different 
geographical background contexts for information (a familiar American setting versus an 
unfamiliar Korean setting) on comprehension and recall of American students, (2) to 
explore the effects of signaling (e.g., titles, headings, previews, summary statements, 
logical connectives, and typographical cues) that was inserted to guide readers‘ attention 
to certain aspects in the passage on comprehension and recall, and (3) to utilize CLT and 
measures of cognitive load to better understand effects that were observed. Students from 
two educational psychology courses at a large Midwestern research university 
participated in the current study. Students‘ comprehension was gauged by 25 fact 
questions and 5 inference-making questions. Their recall was evaluated by a single 
question about how many university names they recalled from those that previously had 

12 
 
been highlighted (boldface) in the text materials. Cognitive load was assessed by 
students‘ scores on subjective rating scales about their levels of motivation, difficulty, 
and mental effort. 
In the primary manipulation of this study, the geographical context in which 
information about global warming appeared was varied (a familiar American context and 
an unfamiliar Korean context) and comprehension, recall and cognitive load were 
examined as a function of that variation. It was hypothesized that unfamiliar background 
context would lead to disadvantages in comprehension, recall, and cognitive load because 
unfamiliar context makes it hard to induce readers‘ schemata and prior knowledge. The 
second dimension of the study, signaling, was hypothesized to overcome the 
disadvantages caused by unfamiliar context. Signaling describes a set of text-related 
approaches that are designed to help readers pay more attention to important aspects and 
relations in the text. As a result of signaling, it was expected that their comprehension 
and recall generally would be improved. It also was predicted, however, that because of 
cognitive load issues generated by an unfamiliar context for information, signaling 
devices would compensate for the difficulties caused by the unfamiliar context more 
effectively, even though signaling devices were expected to be useful in both familiar and 
unfamiliar context.  
Because this study proposed to examine differences caused by context and 
signaling on comprehension, recall, and cognitive load and because it was likely that 
subjects‘ prior knowledge about global warming would affect those dependent variables 
(comprehension, recall and cognitive load), MANCOVA (multivariate analysis of 
covariance) was employed. Students‘ confidence in prior knowledge about global 

13 
 
warming and about American and Korean geography was measured and these scores 
were used as covariates. MANCOVA examined whether significant multivariate effects 
as well as univariate effects existed. If the results for multivariate tests are significant, it 
indicates the collection of dependent variables differs among the treatment conditions. If 
univariate tests are significant, it means the treatment conditions make a significant 
difference on the dependent variable being tested (Gardner, 2001).  
This study was expected to add to previous research regarding reading 
comprehension and cognitive load theory by its examination of the effect of context on 
comprehension and recall from the perspective of cognitive load theory. The effects of 
sentence contexts as well as single-word context on word recognition and word 
identification have been explored by a number of studies (e.g., Kim & Goetz, 1994; 
Kleiman, 1980). Although a few studies employing a whole story context to examine the 
effect of cultural schemata on reading comprehension can be found (e.g., Reynolds, 
Taylor, Steffensen, Shirey, & Anderson, 1982; Steffensen, Joag-Dev, Anderson, 1979), 
little is known about the impact of readers‘ familiarity with a geographical background 
context on their reading comprehension and recall of technical information. Because this 
writer‘s review of research did not reveal any studies that have focused on the effect of 
geographical background context examined by the perspective of cognitive load theory, 
the current study adds new findings to previous research.  
It also was judged to be valuable to investigate ways of improving students‘ 
understanding of important information under circumstances that parallel those that 
students are likely to encounter in their science and history classes. In many classes, a 
significant proportion of the technical and historical information students encounter is 

14 
 
likely to be embedded in a unfamiliar background context. Such unfamiliar contexts may 
cause disadvantages in comprehension, recall, and cognitive load. By finding a way–
signaling in the present study–to improve comprehension and recall and to reduce 
cognitive load, this study may contribute to understanding of how such problems can be 
addressed.

Chapter II 
Review of Literature 
The present study was designed to examine the effects of context and signaling on 
comprehension, recall, and cognitive load. It was expected that familiar and unfamiliar 
context would affect students‘ comprehension, recall of information, and students‘ self-
reported levels of cognitive load created during reading differently due to the fact that 
familiar context would activate readers‘ prior knowledge and schemata. Signaling was 
proposed in the present study to compensate for the disadvantaged circumstance caused 
by unfamiliar context. Therefore, analyzing and examining previous research focused on 
schema theory, context effects, signaling effects, and cognitive load theory were 
important steps in finding a way to discover valuable strategies for facilitating reading 
comprehension and recall in an unfamiliar and foreign context, and to help structure the 
present study. The literature review here provides theoretical perspectives for the design 
of the present experiment. 
This review covers studies published in peer-reviewed journals that have schema 
theory, context effects, signaling effects, and cognitive load respectively as major 
interests. An overview of schema theory examines how readers‘ schemata influence the 
way readers interpret reading materials and how readers‘ schemata distort and facilitate 
their understanding and remembering. This overview then is tied to the current study, 
showing how familiar and unfamiliar context differently activate readers‘ schemata and 
their prior knowledge.  
Next, studies are reviewed that have investigated the different kinds of context 
effects, for example, context effects on word recognition, new vocabulary learning, 

16 
 
reading comprehension, and recall. These studies provide support for the hypothesis of 
the present study that the familiar and unfamiliar contextual information would 
differentially impact the ability of readers to draw the necessary relations to understand 
reading materials. The section following this reviews literature regarding various effects 
of signaling, which points to ways to mitigate learning difficulties caused by unfamiliar 
background contexts.  
The fourth section, devoted to cognitive load theory, focuses on how various 
kinds of learning environments can cause overload of the cognitive system and how to 
reduce or optimize cognitive load. This research provides support for the idea in the 
current study that unfamiliar context would generate more cognitive load, especially 
more intrinsic load. This literature is used to justify employing signaling as an approach 
hypothesized to affect intrinsic load and reduce total cognitive load. Finally, the chapter 
concludes with a statement of hypotheses for the current study and a brief discussion of 
the study‘s implications.    
Schema Theory 
A schema (plural schemata) is defined as a knowledge structure that represents a 
class of things, events and situations and that has components or subparts called slots 
(Anderson & Pearson, 1984). Individuals activate and employ these mental frameworks 
to interpret events. When schemata are activated, the slots are instantiated by specific 
information. Schema theory is a theory about how the knowledge is structured, and about 
how the knowledge structures facilitate the use of knowledge in particular ways.  
According to schema theory, readers‘ schemata provide the fundamental 
frameworks for understanding, learning, and remembering ideas in materials, and 

17 
 
facilitate those processes (Anderson, 1978; Anderson & Pearson, 1984; Rumelhart, 1981). 
In order to comprehend stories and texts, readers need to have appropriate schemata that 
provide good explanations about the objects and events in the passages. A body of 
research has shown that information is understood effectively when readers employ 
appropriate schemata. Text content that is tied to learners‘ schemata also is more 
effectively remembered (Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, & Goetz, 1977; Bransford & 
Johnson, 1972; Steffensen, Joag-Dev, & Anderson, 1979).  
Several schema-based processes in learning and remembering have been 
identified. A schema helps the information to be encoded and learned more efficiently by 
allocating the learner‘s attention to the important elements, providing ideational 
scaffolding for assimilating information, and enabling inferential elaboration when the 
text is not explicit (Anderson, 1994). Similarly, retrieval processes are facilitated by 
schemata guiding memory searches, providing standards for editing out unimportant 
information, and aiding inferential reconstruction when there are gaps in memory 
(Anderson, Pichert, & Shirey 1983). These processes will be reviewed in detail below.  
Schemata enable information to be encoded more precisely because they provide 
slots for certain text information. As a consequence, the information consistent with the 
schema is easily remembered and learned with little mental effort. The schema provides 
what Anderson (1994) has called ideational scaffolding. Additionally, schemata enable 
readers to be guided to more important text elements and to allocate more attention to the 
text aspects consistent with their schemata. By doing so, important propositions in a text 
are connected with the overall representation that is being created. Making such 

18 
 
connections extends cognitive capacity and helps readers better recall the information 
that receives more attention (Anderson, 1978, 1994).  
Schemata also facilitate making inferences. Readers make inferences at the time 
of reading as well as at the time of remembering. In order to fully understand a passage as 
the writer intends, readers need to make inferences for parts that are not explicitly 
addressed. A reader‘s schema allows inferential elaboration at the time of encoding and 
inferential reconstruction at the time of retrieval. Inferential elaboration refers to the 
notion that a schema enables readers to make inferences about the information that is not 
explicitly stated in a text whereas inferential reconstruction refers to the process of a 
reader generating missing information depending on his/her schema when there are gaps 
in memory (Anderson, 1994). Just as scholars use theories to forecast unknown situations, 
readers use schemata to make inferences about unobserved or unremembered events 
(Rumelhart, 1981).  
Furthermore, a schema provides a guide to the information that needs to be 
recalled. That is, a schema facilitates memory searches by providing the framework used 
to structure the text. The readers are aided by schemata to get access to the specific 
information encoded when they read the text. Also, schemata help readers edit out 
unimportant information and remember important information more effectively. Because 
a schema itself contains a standard of importance, it enables readers to create summaries 
that contain important propositions and omit trivial ones (Anderson, 1978).  
In summary, schemata and schema-based processes (e.g., ideational scaffolding, 
attention allocation, inferential elaboration, inferential reconstruction, searches of 
memory, editing, and summarizing) facilitate comprehending, learning, and remembering. 

19 
 
That is because readers‘ schemata that readers possess provides an expansive and 
interpretative framework for comprehending and remembering discourse. How well 
readers comprehend text is contingent on whether they have appropriate schemata for 
what they are reading and whether the reading materials effectively evoke readers‘ 
schemata. In the next section, studies that show how schemata facilitate readers‘ learning, 
comprehending and remembering will be reviewed.  
Empirical Findings 
In this section, the studies based on schema theory will be reviewed. First, the 
studies that have focused on how the schema-based processes facilitate learning and 
remembering will be described. Also, how schemata affect encoding and retrieval 
differently depending on when the schema is activated will be looked at. Finally, the 
studies regarding how readers‘ expertise, culture and situational context evoke their 
schemata and influence their interpretation, encoding and recall of the passage will be 
discussed.  
       Anderson, Spiro, and Anderson (1978) showed that particular information was better 
remembered when the components of discourse match with readers‘ schemata. In their 
study, 75 undergraduate students were randomly divided into two groups and read one of 
two passages. One was about dining at a fancy restaurant and the other about trip to a 
supermarket. The students who read the restaurant passage showed better recall of food 
items that fits with a restaurant schema such as salad, drink and entrée, but no better 
recall of the items from the low-probability category. The researchers suggested that the 
same information was better encoded in the situation of eating at a fancy restaurant 
because the restaurant schema most closely fit the text information about food items and 

20 
 
orders. In other words, the restaurant schema already had slots that are easily filled by the 
information about food items, orders and attribution to a character, which is ideational 
scaffolding, and accordingly, the information was more effectively encoded and learned.    
In Pichert and Anderson‘s (1977) study, the participants were asked to take one of 
three perspectives—a home buyer perspective, a burglar perspective, or no perspective─ 
and then read a story about two boys playing hooky from school. They recalled more 
information that was consistent with their perspectives than the information that was not 
related to their perspectives. The findings were explained in terms of the influence of 
schemata on readers‘ decision about what details are important. That is, the schema of 
home buyer or burglar helped the readers be more attentive to the information that was 
consistent with the perspective assigned. Therefore, information congruous with their 
respective perspectives was better encoded and learned and better remembered later.  
Anderson and Pichert (1978) also conducted a study to investigate the effect of 
changing perspective. In this study, the subjects were asked to read the passage identical 
to one in their previous study with the perspective assigned, but were requested to recall 
the passage twice. Before the second recall, half of the subjects were instructed to take a 
new perspective, for example, from home buyer to burglar. The result revealed that the 
subjects recalled additional information important to the new perspective but unimportant 
to the original perspective. This strongly supports an argument that the new schema lead 
to searches for important elements consistent with it and to editing and summarizing 
them. That is, retrieval processes also are facilitated by a guide of schema. However, 
what was not clear in those studies is how the time when a reader employs a schema has 
different effects on encoding and retrieval.  

21 
 
To clarify this issue, Anderson, Pichert, and Shirey (1983) investigated the time 
course of schema effects—before reading, right after reading, and long after reading. 57 
female and 14 male college sophomores, juniors, and seniors participated in their 
experiment 2. They were assigned one of two perspectives—burglar versus home 
buyer—before reading the story about two boys playing hooky from school. Right after 
reading, they were cued to recall it from one of two perspectives. Groups were randomly 
selected and asked to recall the text either with the same perspective earlier taken at the 
time of reading or from the different perspective. About two weeks later, the subjects 
were asked to recall the passage again. Half of the subjects were asked to recall the text 
from the original perspective assigned when they read the story and the rest requested to 
recall from the other perspective, which was different from their reading perspective.  
In general, the subjects recalled additional information that was not important for 
their original perspective but important for their new perspective. Right after reading, 
most subjects (87%) recalled at least one additional piece of information that was 
important to the new perspective but not important to their reading perspective. Two 
weeks after reading, half of the subjects also recalled new information that was consistent 
with their new perspective. The researcher concluded that the schema operating during 
recall enhances the probability of remembering the information that was not important for 
their reading perspective but important to their recall perspective. Thus, the schema 
operative during recall can provide a structure that facilitates an orderly search of 
memory and provides the criteria for editing unimportant or uncertain information.   
It seems also that schemata employed at the time of reading can enhance encoding. 
This assertion can be supported by the finding that the recall of information, which was 

22 
 
important to the reading perspective but unimportant to the recall perspective, was still 
prior to the recall of information unimportant to both the reading and recall perspective. 
The information important to the reading perspective was allocated more attention and so 
was better recalled than the information unimportant to both reading and recall 
perspectives. This can be explained only in terms of an encoding process. Consequently, 
the results show that the perspective before reading the passage enhances encoding 
whereas a perspective taken after reading enhances retrieval. When the reading 
perspective and the recall perspective are the same, the information that is important for 
the perspective is doubly enhanced by both encoding and retrieval processes.  
The previous studies examined the role of a schema by assigning the readers into 
different roles such as burglar versus home buyer. Some studies, however, employed 
passages designed to arouse readers‘ expertise and their different cultural schemata. 
Other studies provided different situational contexts and investigated how they aroused 
readers‘ schemata and how they played a role in the readers‘ comprehension. Those 
studies will be reviewed below.    
Readers‘ expertise enables them to construct schemata relevant to their 
experiences. The schemata in turn enable readers to see things in a certain way. The study 
by Anderson, Reynolds, Schallert, and Goetz (1977) revealed the important role of 
schemata in text comprehension by showing that readers‘ expertise evokes their schemata 
and enables people to see a same message in different ways. In this study, it was shown 
that meaning of words in a sentence depends on the interaction between individual‘s 
word knowledge based on their expertise and context. Thirty female students planning a 

23 
 
career in music education and thirty male students taking weight-lifting class in physical 
education participated in this study.  
The subjects read the same passages, but ones could be interpreted in two 
different ways. The first passage could be interpreted as about a convict planning his 
escape from prison or about a wrestler trying to break the hold of an opponent. The 
second passage could be interpreted as being about friends‘ playing cards or about a 
rehearsal session of a woodwind ensemble. Thirty female students from music education 
interpreted the first passage as about prison context, which is a general perspective people 
usually possess, but the second passage as about a music context, which was not the 
common perspective but the perspective specific for people with music expertise. In 
contrast, thirty male students from physical education interpreted the first passage as 
about a wrestling context, which is not the general perspective but the specific one for 
people who had wrestling expert knowledge, and the second passage as about playing 
cards, the common perspective. The results demonstrated that people who have a 
different knowledge structures due to different expertise, different world beliefs, and their 
different backgrounds will interpret the same, identical passage in different ways.  
A number of studies have showed the importance of readers‘ cultural schemata in 
comprehending discourse (e.g., Pritchard, 1990; Reynolds, Taylor, Steffensen, Shirey, & 
Anderson, 1982; Steffensen, Joag-Dev, Anderson, 1979). The text written with culturally 
familiar context for readers was more effectively understood and remembered because 
the text easily evokes readers‘ relevant schemata or background knowledge. However, 
the text that did not provide familiar cultural context was highly misunderstood and 
distorted. 

24 
 
 A study by Reynolds and his colleagues investigated the importance of cultural 
schemata in text comprehension by employing an instance of sounding (Reynolds, Taylor, 
Steffensen, Shirey, & Anderson, 1982). Sounding is the activity in which black male 
adolescents engage to gain the group‘s favor by means of insults at close people or 
making derogatory allusions to their poverty, physical attributes, or sexual behavior. The 
result reveals that white and black subjects had different interpretations about what was 
described in the passage they read in the experimental passage. Many white students 
considered the event as a fight whereas most black students interpreted the episode as 
ritual insulting. In general, the white students tended to misinterpret the story due to their 
different cultural background. 
A study by Pritchard (1990) showed that students tend to employ different 
strategies depending on the situation in which they read a culturally familiar or unfamiliar 
text. In his study, thirty American and thirty Palauan 11th grade students read two letters 
that a woman wrote to her sister to describe the events regarding funerals in each culture. 
According to the result, the subjects used developing awareness (the subject‘s growing 
awareness of how much progress they were making and how many problems they 
encountered during reading)  and establishing intrasentential ties (the subject‘s 
attempting to understand a certain sentence without connecting it to their background 
knowledge or other sentences in the passage)  significantly more often when they read the 
culturally unfamiliar passage than when they read the culturally familiar passage. This is 
because that they found it difficult to connect the stimulus sentence to other part of text or 
to their background knowledge. In contrast, establishing intersentential ties (the subject‘s 
trying to understanding a sentence by relating it to the other sentences in the passage) and 

25 
 
using background knowledge (the subject‘s effort to understand the stimulus sentence by 
using their background knowledge) were significantly more used for the culturally 
familiar passage than for the culturally unfamiliar one. Pritchard also found that more 
elaborations occurred in the culturally familiar passage and more distortions appeared in 
the culturally unfamiliar passage. These findings suggest that readers employ different 
strategies when they read culturally familiar and unfamiliar text, and that relevant cultural 
schemata facilitate the reading process.  
Context plays a role in evoking the reader‘s schemata as well. The more familiar 
context was better recalled because the familiar context is more likely to arouse a reader‘s 
schemata. As a consequence, schemata play an important role in remembering the text 
content (Freebody & Anderson, 1983). Various studies have shown that context is helpful 
for understand text being read (Carey, Harste, & Smith, 1981), finding word meanings 
(Anderson, Stevens, Shifrin & Osborn, 1978; Nagy, Herman, & Anderson, 1985) and 
enhancing encoding and retrieval (Freebody & Anderson, 1983). 
Carey, Harste and Smith (1981) examined the effect of situational context on 
interpreting the text by replicating the study by Anderson, et al. (1977). The researchers 
had judged that the result of the original study did not clearly reveal whether the different 
interpretations about the same passage were due to their different background knowledge 
and expertise (majoring in music education or physical education), or the situational 
contexts (taking the test in an educational psychology course or in weight-lifting classes) 
because the subjects‘ background knowledge and situational context were confounded. In 
the study, the researchers added one more condition that excluded a situational context. 
The students in the Situationally Constrained Group (music major students in music class) 

26 
 
exhibited greater background knowledge when they interpreted the same passage than the 
students in the Situationally Less Constrained Group (music major students in English 
class). This study reveals the important role of context in evoking schemata and the role 
of evoked schemata in making the students see the passage in a certain way.   
In summary, schemata are knowledge structures that facilitate encoding by 
generating more attention to certain information, providing ideational scaffolding, and 
facilitating referential elaboration. Similarly, retrieval processes are carried out more 
smoothly through their offering criteria for importance and enabling editing and 
summarizing using referential reconstruction when there is gap in memory. Enhanced 
encoding and retrieval processes also facilitate comprehending discourse. If texts do not 
induce appropriate schemata or readers do not have appropriate schemata, comprehension 
will be hampered.  
The Effects of Context 
Context refers to the part of a discourse that is adjacent to a target word or a 
passage, or the set of facts and circumstances that surround a situation or event. Because 
context helps the meaning in reading materials to be clear, word recognition as well as 
text comprehension cannot be accomplished without utilization of contextualized 
knowledge about words, sentences, and their meanings (Bruning, Schraw, Norby, & 
Ronning, 2004). Due to the fact that the right contextual information facilitates the 
readers to draw the necessary relations from concepts in the succeeding words and 
sentences, it is important to provide appropriate context that assists readers to achieve an 
accurate word identification, to learn new vocabulary, and to understand reading 
materials correctly (Schwanenflugel & Shoben, 1983).  

27 
 
The research examining context effects is highly varied, focusing on a variety of 
contexts and outcomes that have included word identification and word recognition (e.g., 
Kim & Goetz, 1994; Kintsch & Mross, 1985; Stanovich & West, 1981), lexical decision 
(e.g., James, 1975; Kleiman, 1980; Meyer & Schvaneveldt, 1971; Schuberth, & Eimas, 
1977; Schvaneveldt & Meyer, 1973), new vocabulary learning (e.g., Beck, Mckeown, & 
McCaslin, 1983; Herman, & Dole, 1988; Mckeown, 1985; Nagy, Herman, & Anderson, 
1985), and reading comprehension (e.g., Bransford & Johnson,1972; Carey, Harste, & 
Smith, 1981; Jenkins, Fuchs, Broek, Espin, & Deno, 2003)   
In those studies, the scope of context varied from a single word (Meyer & 
Schvaneveldt, 1971) to culture (Steffensen, Joag-Dev, & Anderson, 1979). The specific 
meaning of context was usually defined in a study such as words, sentences and 
paragraphs. Surprisingly, however, a broader meaning of context has been used implicitly. 
Butterworth (1992), for example, explained how the context has tended to be defined 
generally as ―a common sense approach focusing on the physical, social or cultural 
setting of a particular intellectual task‖ (p.6). From this broader perspective, what counts 
as context for learners is whatever they consider relevant. From this point of view, 
context can comprise the way how a reading material is presented, an individual‘s various 
characteristics such as his/her prior knowledge, and broadly, social and cultural factors. 
Context also can be defined more in the abstract, for example, with context referring to 
the ―…interconnected whole that gives meaning to the parts‖ (Butterworth, 1992, p.6). 
That is, words, sentences, paragraphs, a whole story, settings, and culture can be 
considered as context. A variety of studies conducted to examine the effects of context 
will be reviewed in detail in the following part. 

28 
 
 Empirical Findings 
Context effects on word recognition and lexical decisions. In the body of research 
focused on the effect of context on lexical decision and word recognition, the scope of 
context varies from offering a single word to presenting sentences. Regardless of the 
different contextual settings, context has been shown to facilitate word recognition and 
lexical decision in most studies.  
To examine the effect of single word context on lexical decision in many studies, 
subjects often are asked to decide whether or not two strings of letters form words. Two 
strings of letters can be offered simultaneously or one string of letters shown prior to the 
target string of letters. Meyer and Schvaneveldt (1971), for example, provided two strings 
of letters simultaneous and asked the subjects to decide whether or not both strings of 
letters form words. The reaction time was significantly faster for associated pairs than for 
unassociated pairs. This showed a single word context facilitates lexical decision when 
the preceding word was associated with the target word. Further, an associated word 
context effect was examined under the condition in which an unassociated word was 
inserted between two associated words (Schvaneveldt & Meyer, 1973) and in which non-
words was presented (James, 1975). In all of those studies, the effect of a single word 
context was confirmed by showing facilitation of word recognition.  
In contrast to the single word used to provide context in the above studies, other 
studies focused on the sentence frame context provided a sentence to the subjects to 
examine the effect of the sentence context on word recognition or lexical decision. 
Kleiman‘s study (1980), for example, demonstrated that the sentence frame contexts 
facilitated the subjects‘ lexical decision for the best completion words, the reasonable 

29 
 
completion words, and the related words by showing shorter reaction time and fewer 
errors on those words. In another study, lexical decision was facilitated by context 
differently depending on the characteristics of words (concrete vs. abstract). Providing 
sentence context leads to shorter lexical decision time for abstract words while lexical 
decision time was not different for concrete words with or without sentence context 
(Schwanenflugel & Shoben, 1983). The scholars provided rationale that contextual 
information is already accessible for concrete words, and thus, adding sentence context 
contained little value to shorten lexical decision time.      
A context effect on lexical decision time also was obtained in the study by 
Schuberth and Eimas (1977). In the study, the subjects were requested to classify a string 
of letters into words or non-words when they were exposed to the three different 
conditions: (a) a target letter string was offered after an incomplete sentence, or (b) after a 
string of four spelled-out digits, or (c) only a target letter string was presented. The 
reaction time for the incomplete sentence context was significantly faster than four 
spelled-out digits context or no context. That is, the incomplete sentence context more 
facilitated lexical decisions for incongruous and congruous words than the no context or 
the four spelled-out digits context. Specifically, the reaction time was significantly faster 
for the congruous words than incongruous words and this showed that providing 
incomplete sentence context was more effective for congruous words.  
Other scholars examined the sentence context on word recognition more in detail. 
Kintsch and Mross (1985) showed that word identification comprises two different 
phases, sense activation and sense selection. When the test words were provided right 
after the test sentences, word identification was influenced by associative context but not 

30 
 
by thematic context. That is, under the sense activation condition, the subjects heavily 
relied on the association strength between the priming words and the test words 
regardless of thematic context. However, when enough time was offered to the subjects 
before presenting the test words, the lexical decision task was sensitive to thematic 
context. Therefore, the experiments demonstrated that word identification is differently 
affected by context depending on whether the phase is sense activation or sense selection. 
Also, they clearly showed the effect of associative context and thematic context has 
different effects on word identification.   
In a study by Stanovich and West (1981), a sentence context effect on word 
identification also was demonstrated. The subjects were asked to read the target words 
under congruous-context, incongruous-context and neutral-context conditions. The 
reaction time for the target words under congruous-context was faster than incongruous 
or neutral-context. Also this context facilitation effect was larger for difficult words than 
easy words. The researchers explained that because the process of recognizing difficult 
words is slower than one for easy words and thus, more time generated by slower 
recognition leads to more effective facilitation of contextual information.    
Sentence context was manipulated by varying sentence orders (original sentence 
order vs. scrambled sentence order) in the research of Kim and Goetz (1994). In those 
different sentence contexts, the target words were presented with original forms or altered 
forms. The results showed that scrambled sentences provided limited contextual 
information due to the difficulty in integrating the whole information. The results also 
showed that poor readers read more the original words than the altered words in the 
original sentence order context than good readers did. This demonstrated that poor 

31 
 
readers more rely on contextual information to facilitate word recognition while good 
readers utilize orthographic information more to do that. This is because poor readers try 
to compensate their limited reading ability by counting on contextual information.   
In summary, many studies have shown that the single word context and the 
sentence context smooth the progress of word recognition or lexical decision. Especially, 
context facilitates more effectively when difficult words are shown and poor readers read. 
According to Kintsch and Mross (1985), if more time is given, sense selection is taken 
over and the effect of context will be larger. Based upon the statement, the larger context 
effect for poor readers and difficult words can be explained by the same reasoning. 
Context effects on learning new vocabulary. A body of research investigated the 
effect of context on vocabulary learning (e.g., Cain, Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2004; Carnine, 
Kameenui, & Coyle, 1984; Nagy, Anderson, & Herman, 1987; Stahl, & Fairbanks, 1986; 
Swanborn, & Glopper, 2002). In those studies, context usually refers to text in which an 
unknown word is embedded. Researchers generally acknowledge that context is 
beneficial to grasp the meanings of new words because working within contextual limits 
enable readers to take accurate information about potential word meaning from it. 
 According to McKeown (1985), there are three phases in the process of gaining 
word meaning from context: ―selecting constraints from context, taking advantage of 
multiple contexts, and using new words following initial learning‖ (p.494). To learn new 
words, readers need to know how the words‘ meaning adapts to different contexts. This 
involves exposure to the words in multiple contexts from different perspectives. However, 
literature suggests that the degree of learning new vocabulary from context is also 
affected by kinds of context, reader‘s age and ability, reading purpose, and text variables.  

32 
 
Broadly, two different kinds of context can be distinguished in vocabulary 
learning: one is pedagogical and the other is natural. Pedagogical contexts are 
distinctively constructed for teaching new words whereas natural contexts are the large 
group of words surrounding the unknown words in normal reading materials (Beck, 
McKeown, & McCaslin, 1983). Thus, pedagogical context is more effective in learning 
new vocabularies than natural contexts. The text materials in the research of Jenkins, 
Stein, and Wysocki (1984), for instance, were written for the study and they were more 
informative about the unknown words than natural reading materials. Their result was 
more favorable of learning new words from context than another study that employed 
natural texts (Nagy, Herman, & Anderson, 1985).  
Natural contexts can be distinguished into four types according to the 
characteristics of context: misdirective contexts, nondirective contexts, directive contexts 
and general contexts (Beck, McKeown, & McCaslin, 1983). Misdirective contexts refer 
to those that are likely to direct readers to an incorrect meaning for an unknown word 
while nondirective contexts indicate those that are not helpful for providing a particular 
meaning for an unknown word. Directive contexts guide readers‘ attention to a correct 
meaning but those are not intended by the author, which is different from pedagogical 
contexts. General contexts contain enough information that helps readers grasp meanings 
roughly. Therefore, pedagogical contexts and directive contexts are the most conducive 
to learning new words.  
The effect of context on learning new vocabulary varies depending on readers‘ 
characteristics. When readers are older (Carnine, Kameenui, & Coyle, 1984) and they 
have larger vocabularies (McKeown, 1985) and good comprehension skills (Cain, 

33 
 
Oakhill, & Lemmon, 2004; Swanborn, & Glopper, 2002), they benefit more from context 
in learning unknown vocabulary words. Additionally, the likelihood of learning word 
meanings from context depend on the level of readers‘ prior knowledge and the level of 
ability to weed out irrelevant information and to integrate information surrounding the 
unknown words (Sternberg & Powell,1983).  
The purpose of reading also affects vocabulary learning from context. Swanborn 
and Glopper (2002) found that readers learn new vocabularies from context more when 
they read to learn about the topic or for text comprehension than when they read in free 
reading condition. This is because readers invest more effort when they are requested to 
read for learning about topic and achieving text comprehension. Those situations assist 
the readers in more focusing on new words and finding out meanings from context, and 
lead to higher learning outcomes.  
Text variables also affect readers‘ ability to extract word meanings from context. 
Those are the distance between the target word and its cue, the way how to connect 
between them, and the form of the contextual information in a passage. The more the 
distance between the context clue and the unfamiliar word is close, and the connection 
between them is explicit, the more context clues serve the reader advantageously. Also, 
readers profit more from context clues when they are in synonyms (Carnine, Kameenui & 
Coyle, 1984).  Other variables identified by Nagy, Anderson, and Herman (1987) are 
kinds of text (expository vs. narrative), and conceptual difficulty of unfamiliar words. 
Their study found that the conceptually most difficult words are not likely to be learned 
from context and contextual support for new vocabularies is likely to be useful only in 
expository text not in narrative text. 

34 
 
In summary, researchers generally acknowledge that context assists the progress 
of new word learning by assisting readers in grasping the meanings from the context. 
However, many studies have shown that learning new vocabulary from context relies on 
several factors. In order to maximize effects of context on learning new vocabulary,  such 
factors as kinds of context and text, text variables (the distance between unknown words 
and the cue sentences, the way how to connect two, the form of the contextual 
information), and the characteristics of readers (age, background knowledge, reading 
comprehension skill, and vocabulary ability) should be considered.     
Context effects on reading comprehension.  Context facilitates comprehension 
processes by adding contextual information to the reading materials (Bransford & 
Johnson, 1972). As addressed previously, context broadly refers to the set of facts or 
circumstances that surround a situation or event such as settings and culture, and 
narrowly refers to the part of a discourse that is adjacent to a word, a sentence, a passage 
and a paragraph in the materials to be read. Reading comprehension is more likely to be 
influenced by the broad meaning of context than the narrow meaning of context. 
In the study by Jenkins, Fuchs, Broek, Espin, and  Deno (2003), the relationship 
between context and reading comprehension was examined by context fluency. Context 
fluency scaled by reading speed and reading time of one folktale presented in its natural 
format strongly predicted reading comprehension. When the words in the story was 
randomly ordered in paragraphs without punctuation or when the words in the folktale 
were randomly presented in a list, reading fluency (reading time and reading speed of two 
conditions) were not a strong predictor for reading comprehension. The results 

35 
 
demonstrated that contextual information plays an important role in predicting reading 
comprehension.  
In a well known study by Bransford and Johnson (1972), context for a written 
passage was provided in the form of a picture, which offered important information about 
what was going on in the passage. The result clearly showed that presenting the 
appropriate knowledge before reading had a marked effect on comprehension and recall. 
In a second study, the topic of a passage was provided in three different conditions (No 
topic, topic before reading, and topic after reading). They found that providing a topic 
before reading was most facilitative, having a significant role that appeared to help 
subjects create context being used to comprehend the passages in the first place. The 
condition of topic before reading was set up to evoke the readers‘ prior knowledge and to 
provide context and as expected, readers‘ understanding were better than that in the other 
two conditions.   
 Environments or settings in which reading takes place also provide contextual 
information by assisting readers in drawing the necessary relations between concepts in 
the text and the environments. Those environments and settings can also affect reading 
comprehension. For instance, in Carey et al‘s (1981) study, physical education students in 
a physical education class more often interpreted the ambiguous prison/wrestling passage 
as wrestling sequence than the physical education students in an English class. Likewise, 
the music major students in a music class more construed the vague cards/music passage 
as music sequence than the music major students in an English class. These studies 
illustrate that the situational context in which the print is encountered is prominent in text 
processing and is an important factor influencing reading comprehension.  

36 
 
Likewise, the cultural background of reading material serves as context for 
readers by evoking their cultural knowledge. When the cultural background of the 
material does not consist with that of the reader‘s, reading comprehension will be 
impaired. One classic study supports this. Two different contexts for a wedding, which 
were Indian and American setting for the wedding, strongly affected readers‘ reading 
comprehension (Steffensen, Joag-dev, & Anderson, 1979). American students recalled 
more details for the American wedding passage while producing more distortions for the 
Indian wedding text. Indian students showed in the same effects, but in the opposite 
direction. This study was originally conducted to examine the effect of schemata on 
reading comprehension but here, the study is recapitulated to illuminate the effect of 
different cultural context on reading comprehension.  
Likewise, Johnson (1981) showed that the cultural origin of the story (Iranian 
folklore vs. American folklore) had an effect on reading comprehension measured by 
recalling the story and answering multiple choice questions. When students read the story 
that matched their cultural origin, their reading comprehension was boosted. The same 
results were obtained for students who had same cultural origin but with different sub-
cultural backgrounds (Chan, 2003). The study demonstrated that students from Hong 
Kong and students from mainland China showed the different level of comprehension 
about the reading material (the Symbols of Hong Kong) that reflected sub-cultural 
backgrounds of Hong Kong. Even though the two groups of students share Chinese 
culture in general, the cultural context of the Symbols of Hong Kong passage was not 
enough to evoke students‘ cultural background from mainland China and consequently, 
their comprehension was hampered.  

37 
 
So far, the effects of context on word identification, lexical decision, vocabulary 
learning and reading comprehension have been examined with a variety of studies 
showing that context facilitate a range of reading from word recognition to 
comprehension. These studies also show how important a wide range of contexts can be 
for learning and recall in a variety of tasks. We now turn to studies on the effects of 
signaling.   
The Effects of Signaling  
 
Signaling usually refers to the addition of noncontent words to written texts that 
emphasize certain aspects of the semantic content, or accentuate the conceptual structure 
or organization of the passage (Loman & Mayer, 1983). In other words, signaling is 
aimed at guiding learners‘ effective cognitive processing but is not intended to offer 
substantive or novel information (Mautone & Mayer, 2001). Signaling assists readers in 
allocating their mental resources to important aspects of content or structure as well as in 
figuring out which information is relevant and important. Furthermore, signaling helps 
optimize learners‘ cognitive load by guiding learners‘ attention to significant content and 
organizational features. As a result, learning is more likely to be improved. The effect of 
signaling is examined and described in more detail below.  
The Effects of Signaling in Written Text  
Various types of signals exist in written text: title and headings that guide the 
reader to the most relevant information in the text, previews that provide overall content 
before the actual content, logical connectives that make relationships between ideas clear 
by linking subordinate pieces either with other subordinate pieces or with superordinate 
pieces, pointer words that show a writer‘s view of content, summary statements that 

38 
 
pinpoint important aspects one more time after the content, and typographical cues such 
as boldface, italic, and indentation that are used to draw readers‘ attention to a certain text 
features (Lorch 1989; Spyridakis & Standal, 1987). Researchers have examined how 
these signaling devices influence attention, recall and comprehension during reading.  
Signaling aims to guide readers‘ attention to particular information that is 
important in a text and assist them in discriminating important information from 
unimportant information during reading. How readers‘ attention is affected by signaling 
has been investigated indirectly by whether readers recall signaled content more, and 
directly by recording reading speed on signaled information in a text. It assumed that 
more attention is allocated if readers recall a specific part of information (signaled 
content) or more accurate information. Likewise, if subjects read a specific part of text 
more slowly than other parts in text, it was assumed that readers focused more on that 
information. Generally, studies found that more attention was paid when signaling was 
offered (e.g., Lorch & Lorch, 1985; Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 1993).    
Signaling also leads to better recall performances in general because it guides 
readers‘ attention and help the readers distinguish a specific part of text from the rest and 
consider that important. Lorch and Chen (1986) showed the positive effect of signaling 
on recall. When the sentences were signaled, subjects recalled the target information 
more closely to the original text. However, other studies reveal that signaling do not 
increase recall performances in all occasions (e.g., Brooks, Dansereau, Spurlin, & Holley, 
1983; Healy, Fendrich, Cunningham & Till, 1987; Spyridakis & Standal, 1987). In those 
studies, the recall of topics, the topic organizations and overall recall were influenced by 

39 
 
certain text characteristics such as the complexity of topic structure and by the time when 
signals are provided.  
In addition, signaling assists readers in comprehending what they read more 
effectively. Good comprehension depends on how well readers form a coherent 
representation that includes hierarchical retention of superordinate content, integration of 
content and formation of inferences. Signaling is helpful for readers to select relevant 
information and organize the information into a coherent representation. Therefore, 
readers‘ comprehension can benefit from signaling. In the absence of signaling, readers 
are less likely to distinguish important information and form a coherent representation. 
Thus, their comprehension is more likely to be poor. How readers‘ attention, recall and 
comprehension are affected by signaling will be examined below through reviewing 
studies.  
Empirical Findings   
Attention. Studies have shown that signaling assists readers in allocating their 
attention to signaled parts. Lorch and Chen (1986), for example, showed signaling 
attracts more attention to the signaled parts. In the study, it was demonstrated that readers 
focused more on signaled sentences by showing readers read signaled parts more slowly 
than unsignaled ones. Another study (Britton, Glynn, Meyer, & Penland, 1982) revealed 
that signaling frees cognitive capacity as well as attracting more attention. That is 
possible because signaling leads attention to only important elements.  
In Britton et al‘s study, how signaling affected attention was examined by 
adopting a secondary probe task. The primary task was reading and the secondary task 
was reacting to sporadic and unpredictable clicks. It was assumed that if more attention is 

40 
 
being devoted for reading, less capacity is available for the secondary task and thus, 
reaction time to the click will be slow. Four different kinds of signals were adopted in 
their third experiment: signals that point out relations among text ideas, previews, 
summaries, and signals that identify the most important ideas. The result revealed that 
average reaction time for the secondary task was faster when signaling was provided than 
absent. This suggests that signaling is effective to reduce cognitive processing capacity 
by helping readers pay attention to only significant components, construct an internal 
representation of text content effectively, and infer the ideational relations needed in 
building internal representation. According to the two studies above, signaling is 
effective in collecting readers‘ attention and in reducing cognitive processing capacity.  
Recall of topics and topic structures and recall of overall text. There are 
ambivalent results about the effects of signaling on the recall of topic and topic structures 
and recall of overall text. The recall of topics and topic organizations were benefited from 
signaling its structure. Subjects in the signaled condition recalled more text topics and 
demonstrated better memory for the organization of the topics (Lorch & Lorch, 1985; 
Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 1993). Researchers, however, found under a certain condition, 
the recall of topics was not more effective in the signaled condition than the unsignaled 
condition. If text topic structure is very simple, readers can construct complete and 
coherent topic structure representations without the presence of text structure signals. In 
that case, readers do not need the help of signals in constructing a topic structure 
representation because there are only few topics and the topics are well developed and 
easily related each other (Spyridakis & Standal, 1987). Thus, signaling is not likely to be 

41 
 
effective in improving the recall of topics and topic structures in the simply-structured 
text as much as it is in the complex text.  
Also, there have been contrasting results regarding the effect of signaling on 
overall recall. Several studies have failed to demonstrate signaling effects on overall text 
recall (e.g., Brooks, Dansereau, Spurlin, & Holley, 1983; Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 1993). 
For example, Lorch, Lorch and Inman (1993) employed topic structure signals such as an 
overview of upcoming topics, a summary and headings. They observed that signaling 
topic structure guided subjects to focus more on topic information whereas that resulted 
in poorer memory of subordinate information. Accordingly, the result led to no effect on 
total recall. They concluded that signals that give emphasis to text structure and 
organization are likely to distract the reader‘s attention from subordinate content and thus, 
lead to poorer recall of subordinate content.  
No signaling effect on overall recall was found by Lorch and Lorch (1996) in the 
half-signals condition (Experiment 3). Unsignaled content in the half-signals condition 
was recalled more poorly than the corresponding content in the no-signals condition. This 
showed that recall for the unsignaled content in the half-signals condition was hindered 
by the presence of signals. Therefore, organizational signals lead to better recall for text 
topics and organizations and better recall for signaled content, but poorer recall for the 
subordinate content about unsignaled topics. These ambivalent results lead to no effect of 
signaling topic structure on overall text recall. 
 However, some studies have shown an increase of overall recall in certain 
conditions. In the second experiment of Lorch and Lorch‘s study (1996), overall recall 
was increased in complex topic structure condition. When topic structure was relatively 

42 
 
complex and difficult, students in the signals condition recalled more subordinate content 
than students in the no-signals condition. Also, the study by Rickards, Fajen, Sullivan and 
Gillespie (1997), overall recall was increased by signaling in only the listening context 
but not in the reading context. The subjects in the listening context did not have any 
control over pace and little chance to review a particular section and this situation gave 
them more demand on working memory. Signaling in that situation effectively guided the 
subjects‘ attention to the relevant idea units and effectively reduced extraneous load. As a 
result, the overall recall was increased as well. Overall recall, thus, is likely to depend on 
the characteristics of text and condition. In summary, even though signaled part are better 
recalled in general, overall recall and the recall of topics or topic organizations have been 
observed in two ways depending on text characteristics (e.g., simple vs. complex 
structure) and conditions (e.g., listening vs. reading).  
Comprehension. Effects of signaling on comprehension have been examined by 
problem solving task or making inference problems. In Loman and Mayer‘s study (1983), 
signaling encouraged readers to use meaningful reading strategies. As a consequence, 
readers were more capable of solving creative problems and generating high quality 
answers. Also, Spyridakis and Standal (1987) demonstrated that signals such as headings, 
previews, and logical connectives help readers figure out superordinate content and make 
inferences  
In another study, it is shown that signaling the key causal links of the system 
enhanced subjects‘ creative problem-solving performance (Mayer, Dyck, & Cook, 1984). 
In their second experiment, 30 college students read three different version of a passage 
about nitrogen cycle: the first version was the control version taken from a high school 

43 
 
biology textbook, the second one was the signaled version that included additional 
previews and headings, and the third version was the signaled-enhanced version that was 
identical to the signaled version except adding five new paragraphs to clarify the key 
causal links. The results showed that students‘ problem solving performances were 
enhanced because the signaled and signaled-enhanced group generated significantly more 
good answers (relevant and actually possible answers) than the control group. This 
reveals that signals help students build a more coherent representation and enhance their 
comprehension.  
However, the signaling effect on understanding also depends on the 
characteristics of text. Spyridakis and Standal (1987) examined the effects of three types 
of signals (heading, previews and logical connectives) on comprehension of technical 
expository prose. About 300 college-level students read one of four passages and the 
passage was written with eight different versions (one was non signaled version and 
seven were differentiated by the combination of three signals). When a passage was easy 
enough to the students, then signals were of little value whereas when detail content was 
difficult and the load was heavy, signals, such as headings and logical connectives, were 
most effective to improve readers‘ understanding (Spyridakis & Standal, 1987). 
Therefore, the characteristics of text need to be also considered to investigate the effect of 
signaling on comprehension.  
The Effect of Signaling in Multimedia Learning  
Even though the effects of signaling in printed passages have been examined by 
various studies for an extended time (e.g., Lorch, 1989; Lorch & Chen, 1986; Lorch & 
Lorch, 1985), researchers started to investigate the effects of signaling in multimedia 

44 
 
learning recently. Multimedia learning is defined as ―learning from words and pictures‖ 
and multimedia instruction is defined as ―presenting words and pictures that are intended 
to foster learning‖ (Mayer & Moreno, 2003, p. 43). One example of multimedia 
instruction is a computer-based narrated animation explaining causal relationships in the 
learning material.  
Signaling in multimedia learning is also used to guide the learner to what to attend 
and how to organize it. The theoretical rational of signaling is same as one in the written 
text, which is that signaling directs learners‘ attention toward relevant learning material, 
thereby helping the learner ignore irrelevant material and use all cognitive source to 
process important material. In other words, signaling directs learner‘s attention toward 
essential information and prevents using unnecessary mental resource for processing of 
extraneous information. Thus, the learning outcome is improved by including signaling in 
multimedia learning (Mayer, 2005) as well. How same signaling devices in written text 
and visual cues are used effectively in multimedia learning environments will be 
reviewed below.    
The effect of signals in written text on multimedia learning.  A study regarding 
whether signaling effects in written text can be implemented to multimedia learning was 
conducted by Mautone and Mayer (2001). In their study, signaling refers to ―cues to the 
learner for how to process the presented material‖ (p. 377). To explore the effects of 
signaling in multimedia learning, they employed the signals used by previous research for 
written text such as headings, summary, connecting words and using bold face or italic 
type. The subjects who received the version of signaled narrated animation (signaled 
narration and signaled animation) performed better on problem-solving transfer test than 

45 
 
the subjects who didn‘t receive any kind of signaling (Experiment 3). This result 
demonstrated that students comprehend a multimedia presentation better when it includes 
signals helping them how to process the material than when it does not.  
Visual cues. A large number of studies have shown that signaling can be very 
effectively used to reduce efforts for visual search in multimedia learning (e.g., Jeung, 
Chandler, & Sweller, 1997; Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1999; Tabbers, Martens, & 
van Merrienboer, 2004). For instance, Kalyuga et al. (1999) found that one of visual cues, 
color coding was effective to create a link between textual and pictorial information and 
as a result, learning outcomes were enhanced by reducing unnecessary search.  
Also, visual cues were successfully used to enhance performances in the study by 
Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, and Paas (2007). When students studied using animation 
regarding how cardiovascular system works, attention was guided to the relevant aspects 
in the animation by visually cueing the valves of the heart. The results showed that 
working memory resources can be allocated efficiently to learning itself by adopting the 
visual cues. Additionally, the results on the transfer test suggest that cueing helps learners 
understand the content effectively and form more coherent schemata. These findings 
broaden the effect of visual cueing revealed by the previous research. Visual cueing, 
however, is less effective when it is used to animations that include any narrations. 
Specifically, it is more effective when visual cueing is presented in animation without 
narration and when it is used for text (Lorch, 1989; Lorch et al., 1993) or the combination 
of pictorial and textual information (Kalyuga et al., 1999).   
These results suggest that students learn better from multimedia messages when 
cues emphasizing the organization or the important information are presented. In general, 

46 
 
when a multimedia message contains cues such as an outline, headings and visual cues 
that are used to highlight important material, this approach is likely to be effective for 
improving learning outcomes. However, the studies that have been conducted to examine 
the effects of signaling in multimedia learning are limited. The results reported here are 
promising but more research is needed to establish the strength and robustness of 
signaling effects on multimedia learning.  
The benefits from signals in text and multimedia learning are closely tied to the 
fact that people have limited cognitive resources. Signaling helps readers use fewer 
mental resources for selecting relevant material, which leaves more resources available 
for the higher process of organizing and integrating of the information. Well-designed 
signals can help learners construct, organize and integrate information to be learned more 
effectively and as a consequence, learning outcomes such as recall and understanding can 
be improved. However, text characteristics and conditions need to be carefully 
considered to optimize signaling effects.  
Cognitive Load Theory 
Cognitive load theory (CLT) has been utilized to increase the effectiveness of 
learning and decreasing unnecessary effort that is not directly related to learning itself. 
Researchers have attempted to find better instructional methods that help learners fully 
invest available cognitive resources in learning. By modifying instructional designs in 
various ways, researchers have tried to find better instructional methods in many fields, 
such as science (e.g., Lee, Plass, & Homer, 2006), mathematics (e.g., Owen & Sweller, 
1985; Sweller, 1988; Sweller & Cooper, 1985), training programs (e.g.,Chandler & 
Sweller, 1991; Chandler & Sweller, 1996; Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994a) and 

47 
 
multimedia instruction (e.g.,Kalyuga, chandler, & Sweller, 1999; Mayer & Moreno, 1998;  
Mayer, Moreno, Boire, & Vagge,1999). As a result of a variety of instructional methods 
based on CLT, learning outcomes have been enhanced.  
CLT will be reviewed in detail below. First, theoretical perspectives on CLT will 
be provided by addressing the components of CLT and its assumptions. Next, based upon 
empirical findings, instructional methods that have proved effective for better learning 
will be illuminated. After that, the different ways to measure cognitive load will be 
reviewed. Finally, how CLT was adapted to this study is addressed. 
Theoretical Perspective on Cognitive Load Theory 
Limited working memory and unlimited long-term memory. CLT has several 
assumptions consistent with those of the information processing model. Among these 
assumptions are limited working memory and unlimited long-term memory, which are 
the building blocks of cognitive load theory. Working memory is able to hold only about 
seven items or elements of information at one time (Miller, 1956).  Mental work can be 
performed without taxing the resources of working memory under normal information 
processing loads, but when the processing loads exceed the capacity of working memory 
limitation, intellectual work cannot be conducted effectively. Cognitive load theory 
accepts the capacity limitation of working memory but also emphasizes that the limitation 
only applies to novel information (Bruning, Schraw, & Norby, 2011). When working 
memory deals with information stored in long-term memory, it does not have any 
restrictions. Thus, CLT has dealt with how to reduce working memory load when an 
individual learns new material (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 1991).  

48 
 
CLT also assumes an unlimited capacity for long-term memory, and the important 
roles of meaning and organization in long-term memory. In long-term memory, 
knowledge is structured into complicated representations called schemata (Anderson, 
1978). Schemata can operate like a central executive that organizes information and 
knowledge and help a new material processed in working memory. Under the 
circumstances in which schemata act as a central executive, working memory load can be 
largely decreased (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005). Thus, CLT focuses on the fact that 
schemata greatly reduce working memory load. When readers employ appropriate 
schemata, even highly complicated information can be managed as one element.  
Schema automation also enables learners to bypass the limited working memory 
through allowing cognitive processes to occur without conscious control. After 
considerable time and practice, a schema can be automated and one can recognize the 
category of the problem with minimal demands on one‘s limited processing capacity 
(Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998). Both schema construction and automation that 
use information stored in the long-term memory can greatly reduce the burden on 
working memory and thus, achieving schema construction and automation are very 
significant in CLT to overcome the limitation of working memory. In summary, the 
cognitive dimensions of limited working memory, unlimited long-term memory, schema 
construction, and schema automation offer a basic architecture for developing CLT and 
the following empirical studies.   
Three different kinds of load. CLT assumes that three different kinds of cognitive 
load exist when learning takes place: extraneous load, intrinsic load, and germane load. 
Extraneous load is determined by instructional design and is influenced by the manner in 

49 
 
which the material is presented or by the activities required of the learner. Sweller, van 
Merriënboer and Paas (1998) have suggested that extraneous load can be decreased or 
eliminated by adopting suitable instructional designs and considering appropriate 
instructional methods.   
In contrast to extraneous load, intrinsic load is determined by the degree of 
element interactivity, which is the number of elements that should be processed 
simultaneously (Sweller, 1994). At first, it was not considered to be changed by 
instructional methods because the load was intrinsic to the material being learned. Later, 
however, researchers have shown that intrinsic load also can be manipulated by altering 
the degree of element interactivity (Pollock, Chandler, & Sweller, 2002). However, 
element interactivity is related to an individual‘s mastery level. Van Merriënboer and 
Sweller (1991) argue that element interactivity ―… can be determined only by counting 
the number of interacting elements that people deal with at a particular level of 
expertise‖ (p.150). This indicates that element interactivity cannot be measured merely 
by analyzing task or material. Some materials are not intelligible to some learners 
because there are many interacting elements in the materials that have to be processed 
simultaneously and accordingly; that situation creates overburden and causes high 
intrinsic load to the learners. However, because they are more experienced, some learners 
consider a large number of interacting elements as only a single element. Level of 
expertise determines what counts as an element. Therefore, intrinsic load cannot be 
determined without considering a learner‘s level of expertise (Schnotz & Kürschner, 
2007). 

50 
 
 Finally, germane cognitive load refers to the part of a learner‘s effort that is 
devoted to schema construction and schema automation, which are essential to learning. 
Sweller, van Merriënboer, and Paas (1998) argued that germane load should be increased 
as high as possible, but the increased germane load should stay within the limits of 
working memory. In order to do that, it is important to find appropriate instructional 
methods that can reduce extraneous load; reduced extraneous load enables learners to 
redirect their attention to cognitive processes that are relevant to schema construction and 
schema automation. Thus, the goal is to find instructional designs that decreases 
extraneous load and at the same time, increase a learner‘s effort and motivation. Such an 
increase is considered to enhance germane cognitive load resulting in schema 
construction and schema automation (Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003).           
CLT proposes that the total cognitive load is the sum of the three kinds of 
cognitive load: extraneous load, intrinsic load, and germane load.  This sum should stay 
within limited working memory capacity because if the sum exceeds working memory‘s 
limited capacity, learning does not take place effectively (Sweller, 2005). If materials to 
be learned have high element interactivity, this causes high intrinsic load; thus, 
extraneous load should be reduced by finding more effective instructional designs that 
allow learners to stay within their working memory capacity. If both intrinsic load and 
extraneous load are high due to the ineffective instruction design or high element 
interactivity, the sum of intrinsic and extraneous load will exceed learners‘ working 
memory capacities, so nothing is left for germane load.  
In summary, CLT can inform instructional designs leading to better learning 
outcomes by suggesting ways to overcome working memory limitation, facilitate schema

construction and schema automation, and utilize humans‘ unlimited long-term memory 
capacity. CLT researchers have found a variety of effective instructional designs that 
enhance learning outcomes by enabling the total cognitive load to stay within the limited 
capacity of working memory. Those studies will be reviewed in depth below.  
Empirical Findings from Cognitive Load Research 
CLT was developed based on experiments conducted in the late 1970‘s and early 
1980‘s. These studies, which used puzzle problems such as maze-tracing and Tower of 
Hanoi, revealed that conventional problems focusing on the means-ends process were not 
effective for learning. The means-ends approach in problem solving only makes 
individuals try to reduce differences between problem states and goal states and as a 
consequence, imposes a big burden on working memory (Sweller, 1983). A means-ends 
instruction method can prevent schema construction, which is the main object of learning. 
As research on CLT has proceeded, researchers have invested considerable effort in 
finding instructional designs that can reduce extraneous load resulting from conventional 
problem solving methods. Instructional designs based upon CLT include goal-free 
problems, worked examples, completion problems, bimodal presentation, methods of 
preventing split-attention, and elimination of redundant information. Each of these has 
been utilized to reduce extraneous load, but later, researchers have become interested in 
manipulating intrinsic load as well.    
Manipulating extraneous load. The study by Sweller and Levine (1982) revealed 
that students showed better learning from goal-free problems than means-ends analysis 
problems because the former condition did not give an excessive burden on limited 
working memory. Two groups of students participated in the maze-tracing experiments 

52 
 
and one group were informed about the goal to be attained while the other group received 
no information about the goal (goal-free condition). The result indicated that the 
nonspecific goal led to fewer errors and faster learning of the structure of the problem.  
Worked examples also seem to help students direct their attention appropriately to 
problem solving and their appropriate attention, in turn, reduces extraneous load. The 
method assists learners to focus on the right task aspects and to facilitate schema 
acquisition (Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994a). Sweller and Cooper (1985) investigated the 
use of worked examples and found that the instruction with worked examples in algebra 
was more effective to help students construct a schema for problem solving. Also, the 
learners who studied worked examples showed better ability to solve new algebra 
problems, which shows better transfer, than learners who were requested to solve the 
same problems by themselves (Cooper and Sweller 1987). Another study revealed that 
process-oriented worked examples (providing expert‘s ―why‖ and ―how‖ information) 
enhance transfer performances especially for the work that needs complex cognitive 
skills and has several possible solutions (van Gog, Paas, & van Merriënboer, 2004).  
Completion problems are another instructional approach that reduces extraneous 
load. In completion problems, a given state, a goal state and a partial solution are 
provided, and learners must complete the partial problems. Completion problems are 
useful especially in domains such as software design and electronic circuit design. Both 
worked examples and conventional problems are combined in completion problems. On 
the one hand, like conventional problems, learners have to find the solutions by 
themselves and in order to do that, they have to study carefully the partial example 
provided in the completion problem. On the other hand, by providing the partial 

53 
 
examples (van Merriëboer, Kirschner, & Kester, 2003), completion problems reduce 
extraneous load much like worked examples. Studies have shown the superiority of 
completion problems over conventional problems (Paas, 1992; van Merriënboer, 1990; 
van Merriënboer & de Croock, 1992). The superior results from completion problems 
presumably result because completion problems reduce extraneous load and help learners 
direct their attention to the construction of schema.  
Another way to reduce extraneous load is by adopting two different modes of 
presentation—such as visual (written) mode and auditory mode (narration—instead of 
using only one mode or the other. If information is presented through two different paths, 
cognitive load problems are reduced because the limitation of working memory capacity 
can be enlarged by a dual mode of presentation. The study by Kalyuga, Chandler, and 
Sweller (1999) proved the superiority of auditory and diagram presentation to visual-only 
presentation. However, another study (Tabbers, Martens, & van Merriënboer, 2004) 
revealed that a bimodal presentation should be carefully employed to successfully reduce 
cognitive load. In their study, the advantage of bimodal presentation diminished in 
learner-paced instruction. Based on that result, the researchers argued that a bimodal 
presentation is only advantageous in system-paced instruction. Therefore, instructional 
conditions should be cautiously examined to determine when bimodal presentation can be 
effectively used. 
Extraneous load can be decreased by preventing split-attention as well. The split 
attention effect occurs when learners‘ attention should diverge between more than two 
sources and integrate them to understand the material (Yeung, Jin, & Sweller, 1998). It 
has been found to be one of the major problems in some instructional designs causing 

54 
 
interference with effective learning (Chandler & Sweller, 1991, 1992; Sweller & 
Chandler, 1991, 1994), Chandler and Sweller (1991), for example, showed 28 first-year 
trade apprentices who participated in their first experiment learned about how to test 
insulation resistance with one of the two versions of a booklet. In one version, a diagram 
and text explaining insulation resistance were presented separately while in the other 
version, text and diagram are integrated. The apprentices who studied with the integrated 
version earned higher scores in the two written tests (the first week and the twelfth week). 
The mean test score after 12 weeks training for the separated format group was even 
below the mean score for the integrated format group in the first test period. The 
researchers suggested that the separated version made the apprentices switch their 
attention between the graphic and text frequently in order to integrate the information to 
be understood. Because attention and mental resources were devoted to a task unrelated 
to learning, fewer resources were available for essential learning. As a result, cognitive 
load was increased and learning outcomes deteriorated.        
Extraneous load can be curtailed by eliminating redundant information. If 
individual sources of information are self-contained (such as a diagram that is intelligible 
by itself), text merely describing information contained in the diagram is redundant. In 
this situation, redundant text information imposes increased cognitive load. Conversely, 
eliminating redundant sources of information benefits learning. This redundancy effect 
has been demonstrated in several studies using diagrams and text in instructional design 
(e.g., Chandler & Sweller, 1991; Kalyuga, Chandler, & Sweller, 1999).  
Some researchers have considered other factors, such as the levels of element 
interactivity and the levels of expertise when they investigated redundancy effects. 

55 
 
Sweller and Chandler (1994) examined redundancy effects with the different levels of 
element interactive tasks in their second experiment. They showed that redundancy made 
the learning outcome worse especially when the task involved high element interactivity 
(high intrinsic load). Thirty high school students learned how to use a spreadsheet 
package and solved two different kinds of problems: problems 1 and 2 were judged to be 
low element interactive tasks and problems 3 and 4 judged to be high element interactive 
tasks. The students were assigned into the three different groups.  The first group learned 
the package using conventional textual information and computer while the second group 
used a modified manual that included textual information integrated with diagrams and 
computer as well. The third group only used the integrated textual information without 
contacting with the computer. Asking the two groups of student to use a computer to 
learn the spreadsheet package was considered to be redundant because the manual was 
self-contained enough.  
The results showed that there was no significant difference among the three 
groups on low element interactive tasks whereas significant difference was observed 
among the three groups on high element interactive tasks. The group with only the 
modified manual outperformed the other two groups. The authors suggest that an 
instructional design becomes more important when one deals with a high element 
interactive task because the task itself gives a considerable burden to the person and not 
enough mental resource is left to perform the task. In this case, the redundant activity, 
using a computer here, imposes an additional burden to the two groups of students and 
their performances for high element interactive tasks deteriorated.  

56 
 
Some researchers have investigated the relationship between the level of expertise 
and task redundancy. A learner‘s level of expertise is a critical factor in determining what 
information is relevant or redundant for the learner and what an instructional design is 
effective or ineffective (Kalyuga et al., 2003). McNamara, Kintsch, Songer, and 
Kintsch‘s (1996) research found that low-knowledge readers benefited from the modified 
text that consisted of adding materials explicitly identifying the major subtopics as traits 
of mammals whereas high-knowledge readers benefitted from the original version. This 
demonstrated that adding the same material can be beneficial for less proficient subjects 
but redundant for more proficient ones. When new material is employed, instructors need 
to consider that adding some material can be redundant for high-ability learners and 
actually cause unnecessary cognitive load.  
Manipulating intrinsic load.  Earlier instructional methods based on CLT only 
dealt with the ways to reduce extraneous load caused by the way to-be-learned materials 
are presented. Initially, intrinsic load was considered to be unchangeable, a feature only 
of the material to be learned. However, some researchers began to probe issues related to 
intrinsic load from a new perspective—that intrinsic load can also be manipulated.  
Pollock, Chandler, and Sweller (2002) attempted to reduce intrinsic load by 
altering the degree of element interactivity. Element interactivity of complex material 
was artificially decreased by breaking the material into smaller parts that could be 
processed independently rather than simultaneously. Their instructional approach builds 
on the assumption that complex problems can be effectively solved only after students‘ 
appropriate prior knowledge is built. Students in the study first studied the individual 
information elements needed to understand a concept. Next, they studied all the 

57 
 
information and how the parts interacted. The researchers showed that intricate 
information is better learned through the method called the isolated-interacting elements 
method.  
In another study supporting the idea that intrinsic load can be manipulated, Kester, 
Kirschner, and van Merriënboer (2006) showed that learning complex materials for 
problem solving was better accomplished when declarative knowledge and procedural 
knowledge are presented separately. Learners who encountered a complex material piece 
by piece (offering declarative and procedural knowledge in a different time) obtained 
higher transfer-test and lower mental effort scores than learners presented the same 
material simultaneously.  
One recent study utilizing computer simulation about the ideal gas law showed 
that intrinsic load could be reduced by presenting the content separately on two 
successive computer screens (Lee, Plass, & Homer, 2006). Students (n=257) from 7th 
grade classrooms learned about the ideal gas law from a simulation. Some students 
studied with two separate screens; the relationship between pressure and volume with a 
constant temperature (Charles‘ law) was presented on the first screen and the relationship 
between temperature and volume with constant pressure (Boyle‘s law) displayed on the 
second screen. Students were allowed to switch between two screens without restrictions. 
In contrast, for other students, the relationship of temperature, pressure, and volume of 
gas were exhibited on a single screen. It was considered that information presented on 
one screen would represent high element interactivity whereas the same information 
displayed on two separate screens would create low element interactivity. The results 
showed that the students who studied on two separate screens (information with low 

58 
 
element interactivity) exhibited higher level of comprehension and better performance on 
the transfer test. This finding was interpreted as indicating that segmenting high element 
interactive information into two parts and displaying them successively on a different 
screen can reduce intrinsic cognitive load. 
To this point, studies that have devoted attention to find methods to reduce 
extraneous load and intrinsic load have been reviewed. In some studies, the amount of 
load imposed by learning materials was measured in several ways to attempt to better 
understand why new instructional methods were more effective in achieving better 
learning. In the next section, various ways of measuring cognitive load will be examined. 
The Measurement of Cognitive Load 
The total amount of cognitive load is defined as the sum of intrinsic, extraneous, 
and germane load. However, none of the three types of cognitive load are directly 
measurable. Instead, cognitive load has been assessed by measuring mental load, mental 
effort, and performance (Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994a). Mental load provides an 
indication of expected cognitive capacity demands for a specific task through considering 
the interaction between task and learner characteristics such as level of expertise, age, 
and spatial ability. Mental effort refers to the cognitive capacity that is actually allocated 
by a learner to do a task. Performance offers objective data such as the number of correct 
test items, number of errors, and time invested for the task.  
In order to measure cognitive load, three kinds of techniques have been used in 
cognitive load research: subjective rating scale techniques, physiological techniques, and 
task-and performance-based techniques. Paas and van Merriënboer (1993) also 

59 
 
introduced the efficiency approach that combines both performance scores and mental 
effort scores. 
 Subjective rating scale techniques have been developed on the assumption that 
people have an ability to evaluate their effort invested in a task. Most subjective rating 
techniques reflect the psychologically oriented concept of overall load. Paas (1992) first 
adopted this technique in his research to measure mental effort expended on 
understanding basic statistics. Learners were asked to report their invested effort on a 9-
grade symmetrical category scale ranging from a very, very low mental effort (1) to a  
very, very high mental effort (9). Subjective rating scale techniques also have been 
utilized to measure the difficulty of material being learned (Kalyuga, Chandler, & 
Sweller, 1999). It has been demonstrated that subjective rating scale techniques are 
sensitive to very small differences in cognitive load and are both valid and reliable 
(Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 2003; Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, & van Gerven, 2003).    
 Physiological techniques have been used to measure cognitive load based upon 
the assumption that physiological changes can reflect changes in cognitive functioning. 
These techniques include measures of eye movement, heart activity, and brain activity. 
For example, heart-rate variability was measured to assess cognitive load in Paas and van 
Merriënboer‘s study (1994b). However, they found that this measure was invalid and 
insensitive to small changes in cognitive load.  
Task- and performance-based techniques measure two different task results, on a 
primary task and on a secondary task. Primary task measures are based on the task 
performance that is the focus of researchers‘ studies, whereas secondary task measures 
are based on a task performed simultaneously with the primary task, such as measuring 

60 
 
reaction time for detecting visual or auditory signals. The reaction time on the secondary 
task was a reliable measure in the study by Brünken, Plass, and Leutner (2004). The 
reaction time of the secondary task in audiovisual primary task was significantly faster 
than that in the visual-only primary task. This result was consistent with previous studies 
of modality effect and showed that the secondary task was a reliable measurement. 
However, the biggest shortcoming of the technique is that the secondary task may affect 
the outcome of the primary task (Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 2003).  
Based on the conversion of raw mental effort scores and raw performance scores 
to z scores, the efficiency approach was introduced by Paas and van Merriënboer (1993). 
If high task performance is combined with low effort, the result is called high-
instructional efficiency whereas if low task performance is associated with high effort, 
the result is called low-instructional efficiency. It was concluded that combinations of 
task performance and mental effort scores can be more sensitive measures on cognitive 
costs of training program or learning environments than a task performance score or a 
mental effort score alone (Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, & van Gerven, 2003). 
In summary, CLT has been developed based upon the assumptions that there is 
limited working memory and unlimited long-term memory capacity in human cognition, 
that three different kinds of load (extraneous, intrinsic and germane load) exist, and that 
schema construction and schema automation are the goals of education. Many efforts 
have been made to find better instructional methods that decrease extraneous load and 
intrinsic load and at the same time to optimize germane load. Furthermore, various 
measurements of cognitive load have shown that new instructional designs or methods 

61 
 
based upon CLT can be more effective. As a consequence, learning outcomes have been 
improved.    
 
The Hypotheses of the Present Study 
The research reviewed in this chapter suggests that (1) the context of a story can 
influence reading comprehension and recall, (2) geographically unfamiliar context can 
cause difficulties in comprehension and recall due to readers‘ having a problem activating 
schemata and evoking prior knowledge that would allow them to integrate multiple 
elements of information into a single element, (3) unfamiliar context may cause higher 
cognitive load due to heavier intrinsic load that results from high-element interactivity 
between the elements in the content about global warming and the elements in unfamiliar 
geographical background, and (4) signaling can be a good way to reduce cognitive load, 
and enhance reading comprehension and recall. Studies of signaling have shown that it 
can effectively direct readers‘ attention, and improve recall and understanding. Thus, 
providing signaling devices such as a title, headings, previews, logical connectives, and 
typographical cues is likely to significantly enhance comprehension and recall and reduce 
cognitive load.  
Based upon the implications of previous research, four major hypotheses were 
proposed regarding the effect of context and signaling on comprehension, recall and 
cognitive load. Hypothesis 1 proposed that there would be differences between groups 
caused by context familiarity and presence of signaling in terms of the collection of 
dependent variables (comprehension, recall, and cognitive load). Whether there were 
differences in groups in terms of comprehension, recall, and cognitive load caused only 

62 
 
by familiarity of context was tested in Hypothesis 2 and only by presence of signaling in 
Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4 focused on the interaction between familiarity of context and 
presence of signaling. Specifically, the hypotheses for the present study were: 
Hypothesis 1: After controlling for students’ prior knowledge about global 
warming and American and Korean geography, the collection of comprehension, recall 
and self-reported cognitive load variables will be significantly different among four 
groups created by variation in familiarity of context and presence or absence of signaling.  
Familiarity of context was expected to produce a significant difference among 
groups in the multivariate set of comprehension, recall and cognitive load measures. 
Because familiar context should be helpful in activating participants‘ schemata and prior 
knowledge and in turn the activated schemata and prior knowledge should be useful in 
drawing the essential relations from concepts in text, the students‘ reading 
comprehension and recall in familiar context groups were expected to be enhanced. Also, 
because working memory load can be greatly decreased when schemata familiar to 
readers are activated (Bruning, Schraw, & Norby, 2011), students‘ cognitive load in 
familiar context groups is likely to be reduced as well (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005).  
Similarly, presence or absence of signaling was expected to lead to significant 
differences among groups in comprehension, recall and cognitive load. Because signaling 
assists participants in allocating their mental resources to more important content or 
structure in text (Mautone & Mayer, 2001), cognitive load would be expected to decrease 
in groups receiving signaling as well as their reading comprehension and recall improved. 
Together, familiarity of context and presence of signaling together were likely to 
differentiate groups in the collection of participants‘ reading comprehension, recall, and 

63 
 
cognitive load. More specifically, students‘ reading comprehension and recall would be 
enhanced and their cognitive load would be decreased by providing both familiar context 
and signaling.  
Hypothesis 2: Context familiarity will have significant positive effects on 
comprehension, recall, and self-reported cognitive load.  
Familiar context contributes to activating students‘ schemata and helps students 
use their prior knowledge that is relevant to the to-be learned information (McVee, 
Dunsmore, & Gavelek, 2005). Because appropriate contextual information helps readers 
to draw the necessary relations among concepts in words and sentences (Schwanenflugel 
& Shoben, 1983), their reading comprehension and recall benefit from familiar context.  
Activated schemata also can free our limited working memory by allowing many 
elements to be treated as a single element in working memory (Moreno, 2004). In the 
present study, due to the fact that a geographically familiar (American) context for 
information about global warming was predicted to be more likely to evoke readers‘ 
schemata, relatively lower cognitive load should be imposed by this familiar context. An 
unfamiliar context, however, should be less likely to activate relevant student schemata. 
Thus, the students would be expected to expend more mental resources to understand the 
passage. Therefore, it was hypothesized that context familiarity would significantly 
improve comprehension and recall and reduce cognitive load compared to the unfamiliar 
context.  
Hypothesis 3: Signaling will have significant positive effects on comprehension, 
recall, and self-reported cognitive load. 

64 
 
Signaling is a strategy aimed at guiding the learners‘ effective cognitive 
processing (Mautone & Mayer, 2001). Signaling is assumed to work by helping readers 
direct their mental resources toward certain aspects of content or structure. As a result, 
readers attend to more important content and their comprehension and recall of that 
content will be enhanced. Likewise, signaling is designed to optimize learners‘ cognitive 
load by guiding their attention to significant content and organizational features. 
According to CLT, effective learning is achieved when cognitive resources are directed 
to activities that are relevant to learning goals whereas effective learning is hampered 
when mental resources are directed toward unimportant learning activities (Chandler & 
Sweller, 1991). Thus, when signaling is provided, readers‘ cognitive load should be 
decreased and recall and comprehension improved. 
Hypothesis 4: Signaling will have different effects on comprehension, recall, and 
self-reported cognitive load depending on context familiarity.  
In the present study, students were randomly assigned into four different groups 
as they read an essay about global warming: 1) a familiar context and signaling group in 
which they read about global warming in a familiar context and with signaling, 2) a 
familiar context and no signaling group, 3) an unfamiliar context and signaling group, 
and 4) an unfamiliar context and no signaling group. Due to the likelihood that an 
unfamiliar context would generate more cognitive load, reducing mental load by 
providing signals was expected to lead to better performance in reading comprehension 
and recall. Thus, signals were expected to enhance comprehension and recall and reduce 
cognitive load more effectively for students who read information in a geographically 
unfamiliar context than for students who read it in a familiar one. 

65 
 
Chapter III 
Methods 
 
This chapter describes the methods employed to examine the effects of context 
and signaling on comprehension and recall of passage information and on cognitive load. 
The current study examined three aspects. The first was whether two different 
background contexts for the participants (an American context that was familiar to the 
U.S. students who participated in the study, contrasted with a less-familiar or unfamiliar 
Korean context) would have significantly different effects on comprehension of global 
warming related information and on cognitive load. The second was whether signaling 
had significant effects on students‘ comprehension, recall, and self-reported cognitive 
load variables. The third was whether the combination of these two conditions would 
produce an interaction in which signaling had greater effects for students who read about 
information embedded in unfamiliar contexts than for those who read information 
situated in familiar ones.  
In the following sections, participants, experimental materials, experimental 
procedures are presented and methods of analysis are discussed.  
Data Collection 
All the data for the current study were collected online. This current study was 
conducted at a large mid-western university through an online survey website. 
Participants were 147 students who were enrolled in two intermediate-level 
undergraduate educational psychology courses in the fall of 2010 semester. Students were 
randomly assigned to one of four conditions and a hyperlink directing the students to 
each condition was sent to them.  

66 
 
Students were first requested to provide their demographical information and their 
levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming and about American and 
Korean geography. Next, they encountered information about global warming 
phenomena in one of two different contexts and in one of two different signaling 
conditions (an American signaled version, an American nonsignaled version, a Korean 
signaled version, and a Korean nonsignaled version). After students read the information 
about global warming, they took comprehension and recall tests and reported their 
perceived levels of motivation, difficulty, and mental effort in the same online 
environment. The characteristics of participants and experimental materials are addressed 
in the following sections more in detail.  
Participants 
Students from two undergraduate educational psychology courses were invited to 
participate in this study. The students in these courses generally were required to 
participate in 3 hours of research-related activities as part of their course enrollment. The 
participants consisted of 94 females (63.9%) and 53 males (36.1%) students; most were 
juniors (37.4%) or seniors (53.7%), with the rest being sophomore (7.5%) or graduate 
students (1.4%). The participants were majoring in elementary education (27.2%), 
secondary education (55.8%) or a related field (17%). Most of them were between age 20 
to 23 (87.8%) with an overall age range from 19 to 43.  
Experimental Materials 
Experimental materials for this study were organized into four different 
components: (1) a preexperimental questionnaire including demographic questions, prior 
knowledge questions which consisted of one 5-point Likert-type scale about general 

67 
 
global warming knowledge and fourteen questions of students‘ confidence in prior 
knowledge about global warming facts and about American and Korean geography, (2) 
four different versions of reading materials on the topic of global warming, (3) cognitive 
load variables, which were self-reported motivation, difficulty and mental effort, and (4) 
a post-reading test containing fact questions, inference-making questions, one recall 
question. 
Preexperimental questionnaire. The preexperimental questionnaire included 
requests for demographic information, one self-rating item of students‘ prior knowledge 
about global warming, and students‘ confidence in prior knowledge about global 
warming knowledge and about American and Korean geography. The students were 
asked to answer demographic questions that assessed their general characteristics and 
background information such as age, gender, major and year in school (See Appendix A). 
Students were also requested to fill out one self-rating item about global warming that 
provided overall students‘ levels of prior knowledge about global warming. In addition, 
to determine students‘ levels of prior knowledge about global warming and about 
American and Korean geography more in detail, self-efficacy scales were adopted based 
upon Bandura‘s guide (Bandura, 2006). Six items about global warming (See Appendix 
B) and eight items about American and Korean geography (See Appendix C) were 
constructed in self-efficacy scales. Students‘ levels of efficacy about global warming 
were measured to estimate their levels of prior knowledge. Students‘ levels of efficacy 
about American and Korean geography were also gauged to obtain their actual 
familiarity-nonfamiliarity with American and Korean geography. A level of prior 
knowledge about global warming and American and Korean geography for an individual 

68 
 
student was determined by adding up the scores on those items (Koning, Tabbers, Rikers, 
& Paas, 2007; Mayer & Moreno, 1998).  
Four versions of the reading materials. Four different versions of passages about 
global warming were created for this study. The four versions varied in their levels of 
familiarity of context and in the presence or absence of signaling. Figure 1 provides an 
illustration of the four different versions of the passages (See Appendix D for the 
passages themselves).

Two different contexts were employed as a setting for an explanation of nature of 
global warming and factors affecting it. The context for information in one text was U.S. 
environments, while that of the other text was Korean environments. The general global 
warming facts to be acquired by readers were exactly same in the two texts, but the 
examples of global warming in two countries were embedded in two different contexts,

U.S. and Korean. In each condition, all illustrations were based upon real cases and valid 
information, but name of cities or states/ provinces, and the name of measures, such as 
Fahrenheit and Celsius, were different. Table 1 provides an illustration of a global 
warming–related phenomenon, extreme heat waves, as it occurred in the United States. In 
the contrasting experimental conditions, the example was presented as having occurred in 
Korea.

Shared General Fact 
Climate change can directly affect human health by increasing the number of 
extreme heat waves. According to a study conducted by a research center at University 
of Chicago, increases in temperature may lead to more extreme heat waves during 
summer. Heat waves are rare events that vary in character and impact, but they could 
become more frequent, intense, and long-lasting with global warming. 
 
The U.S. Context 
Korean Context 
During the 1990s, Chicago experienced 
several severe heat waves. In July 1995, a 
heat wave resulted in 485 heat-related 
deaths and 739 excess deaths when the 
temperature was over 98 ºF for 4 days. 
After consecutive heat events, Chicago 
implemented a Heat Health 
Watch/Warning System. The warning 
system was implemented in other US cities 
such as Cincinnati, New Orleans, and St. 
Louis.  
 
During the 1990s, Seoul experienced 
several severe heat waves. In July 1994, a 
heat wave resulted in 254 heat-related 
deaths and 532 excess deaths when the 
temperature was over 38 ºC for 14 days. 
After consecutive heat events, Seoul 
implemented a Heat Health 
Watch/Warning System. The warning 
system was implemented in other Korean 
cities such as Busan, Chunan, and Gwanju.  
 
 
 
Each context was then presented in one of two versions; one of them employed 
signaling devices whereas the other did not. As described earlier, signaling refers to the 
addition of devices for emphasizing particular semantic content, structures, and 
organization of the passage, but not for changing meaning or for offering novel 
information (Loman & Meyer, 1983; Mautone & Mayer, 2001). In the present study, a set 

70 
 
of signaling devices, which included a title, headings, a preview, a summary statement, 
logical connectives and typographical cues (bold face), were used. Table 2 shows 
examples of the signaling devices for the present study. A title and headings were used to 
guide the readers to the most relevant information in the text while a preview and 
summary statement were adopted to offer overall content before and after the actual 
content. Logical connectives, such as for example, therefore, also, and likewise, were

Preview 
 
Globally, a warmer earth will bring about increases in 
temperatures, increases in precipitation, increases in the 
strength of tropical cyclones, and cause rises in sea level. 
Researchers think that greenhouse gases and greenhouse effect 
are largely responsible for global warming. Global warming 
also leads to a wide range of impacts on wildlife and human 
health such as extreme heat waves, increases in waterborne 
disease, and increases in ground-level ozone. 
 
Summary 
 
In summary, the strong causes of global warming are likely to 
be green house gases emitted by human activities. Global 
warming could influence so many areas surrounding human 
beings such as increases in temperature, precipitation, strength 
of tropical cyclones, and rises in sea level. Also, it is expected 
that a wide range of impacts on wildlife and human health 
such as extreme heat waves, increases in waterborne disease 
and ground-level ozone.

Korean nonsignaled 1801 words). The reading materials were segmented into four parts 
and after each segment, students were requested to report their levels of eagerness, 
interest, difficulty and mental effort.

Cognitive load measurements. Subjective rating scale techniques were employed 
to measure students‘ levels of eagerness, interest, difficulty, and the amount of cognitive 
load imposed on one of four versions of reading materials. Subjective rating scale 
techniques have been used by many scholars because it has been shown that subjective 
rating scale techniques are sensitive to very small differences in cognitive load, and the 
techniques are both valid and reliable (Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers, & van Gerven, 2003; 
Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 2003). After each segment as well as after all four segments, 
students were asked to report their levels of eagerness, interest, difficulty and metal effort 
on 5-grade symmetrical category scale ranging from (1) to (5) (See Appendix E). Self-

74 
 
reported levels of eagerness and interest were measured to provide an indication of how 
much students were motivated to read each version of the reading materials. Self-reported 
levels of difficulty were calibrated to estimate how difficult each version of reading 
material was for students. Self-reported levels of mental effort were appraised to get an 
idea about how much cognitive load exerted by students when they read one of the four 
versions of reading material. 
Post-reading test. Reading questionnaire included thirty multiple-choice 
comprehension questions and a single recall short-answer question (See Appendix F). 
The thirty comprehension questions composed of twenty five fact-related comprehension 
questions and five inference-making questions. Fact-related comprehension questions 
were constructed to evaluate how well the students learned facts in reading materials and 
the results were used to calibrate their levels of shallow understanding about the material. 
Five inference-making questions were constructed to assess their levels of deep 
understanding. A recall question was particularly made for counting how many names of 
the universities quoted in the reading material could be remembered by the students.   
Procedures 
Several steps were taken before an experiment was conducted for the current 
study: (1) e-mail notification that contained a purpose of this study and a hyperlink to an 
informed consent form was sent to students who were taking two intermediate-level 
undergraduate educational psychology courses; (2) 161 students granted their informed 
consent; (3) All 161 students were assigned to one of four conditions using a random 
number generator; (4) a hyperlink to each condition and a brief explanation about the 

75 
 
study were sent to all 161 students; and (5) finally, 147 students out of 161 participated in 
this study, reading one of four passages and answering all the questions.  
The four passages were an American signaled version, an American nonsignaled 
version, a Korean signaled version, and a Korean nonsignaled version. Students were first 
asked to provide demographical information such as age, gender, major and year in 
school. They were also requested to fill out one self-rating item asking their general 
levels of prior knowledge about global warming. Additionally, students were asked to 
offer their levels of confidence about several dimensions of their prior knowledge about 
global warming and about American and Korean geography. They wrote a number 
between 1 and 100 that showed their levels of confidence in each item (Bandura, 2006).  
After students provided this information, they read one of the four versions of the 
reading materials. They were instructed by a statement, ―This is the first segment of an 
article on Global Warming. Please read it carefully in preparation for a quiz when you 
finish reading all four segments.‖ The reading materials were segmented into four parts. 
Students were asked to rate their levels of interest, eagerness, difficulty of a reading 
material, and mental effort using 5-point Likert scale after they read each segment and 
after all four segments. Next, students were requested to answer 25 fact-related questions, 
five inference-making questions, and a single recall question. Figure 2 shows all the 
procedures for the current study.

Statistical Methods 
Because the focus of the current study was on whether two different treatments 
(context and signaling) had significant effects on multiple dependent variables, which 
were comprehension, recall and cognitive load and because a potential influence of 
readers‘ prior knowledge of global warming phenomena needed to be controlled, a 2X2 
multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was utilized, in which total scores of 
students‘ levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming and about 
American and Korean geography were used as covariates. After adjusting dependent 
variables for differences on one or more covariates, a MANCOVA provides an answer to 
the question of whether there were significant differences among groups (Gardener, 
2001). 
MANCOVA was considered to be the appropriate method for the present study 
instead of running several separate ANCOVAs because MANCOVA has several 
advantages over ANCOVA: (1) it increases the chance of discovering the significant 
effect of treatments and interaction, (2) it protects against inflated type 1 error due to the 
multiple tests of dependent variables, and (3) it may show differences not revealed in 
separate ANCOVAs (Tabachinick & Fidell, 2001).  
MANCOVA shows the result for the multivariate analysis first and then 
univariate analysis next. If the results of the multivariate analysis are significant, it means 
that the collection of comprehension, recall, and cognitive load is significantly different 
among the four conditions by the treatments. The result supported Hypothesis 1 for the 
current study, which was After controlling for students’ prior knowledge about global 
warming and American and Korean geography, the collection of comprehension, recall 

78 
 
and self-reported cognitive load variables will be significantly different among four 
groups created by variation in familiarity of context and presence or absence of signaling. 
If context produces a significant effect on the collection of comprehension, recall 
and cognitive load, the appropriate next step is to examine the results of univariate 
analysis. Theses univariate examinations revealed whether context had a statistically 
significant effect on comprehension, recall, or cognitive load individually and provided 
answers to the questions posed in Hypothesis 2, which was Context familiarity will have 
significant positive effects on comprehension, recall, and self-reported cognitive load. 
Likewise, if the multivariate results of signaling effect are significant, the univariate 
analysis should be checked as well. It also found whether Hypothesis 3, which was 
Signaling will have significant positive effects on comprehension, recall, and self-
reported cognitive load, could be statistically supported.  
Hypothesis 4 probed the interactions between the variables, asking whether 
Signaling will have different effects on comprehension, recall, and self-reported cognitive 
load depending on context familiarity. This hypothesis proposed that signaling was likely 
to be more effective in an unfamiliar context—a context that was likely to cause 
increasing cognitive load as well as creating problems for schema activation and 
utilization of prior knowledge. Hypothesis 4 was tested by individually examining the 
interaction between context and signaling on the dependent variables and also together on 
those dependent variables.

Results 
In the present study, the effects of background context and signaling on students‘ 
levels of comprehension, recall, and cognitive load were examined. Two different 
contexts were employed to frame explanations about global warming, which were 
American geographical background (familiar) and Korean geographical background 
(unfamiliar). Several types of signaling (e.g., titles, headings, previews, summary 
statements, logical connectives, and typographical cues) were also adopted for a signaling 
condition in each context. Context familiarity and presence or absence of signaling 
served as independent variables for this study. Students‘ levels of confidence about 
global warming and about American and Korean geography were measured to control 
their potential influences on dependent variables and used as covariates. 
Seven dependent variables were originally employed—three learning outcome 
variables and four cognitive load variables. Learning outcome variables were students‘ 
fact-level learning (Learningfacts), deep understanding (Inference-making), and recall 
(Recall). Cognitive load variables were students‘ self-reported levels of interest (Interest), 
eagerness (Eager), difficulty (Difficulty), and mental effort (Mentaleffort). Later, only six 
dependent variables were used because there was a high correlation between two 
variables (Interest and Eager) and combined them into one variable which was levels of 
motivation (Motivation).  
Students‘ fact-level learning (Learningfacts) was measured by 25 fact questions, 
their levels of deep understanding (Inference-making) were assessed with 5 inference-
making questions, and their levels of recall (Recall) were gauged by a single recall 

80 
 
question asking how many names of the universities quoted in the reading material the 
students remember. Four cognitive load variables, students‘ self-reported levels of 
interest (Interest), eagerness (Eager), difficulty (Difficulty) and mental effort 
(Mentaleffort) were measured by 5-point subjective rating scales. Results of the study are 
presented in this chapter. First, research questions and four hypotheses are reviewed. 
Next, data collected for this study are evaluated based on the assumptions of multivariate 
analysis of covariance and four research hypotheses are explored. Finally, other 
interesting findings are reported. 
Research Question and Hypotheses 
This study was designed to answer questions about the effects of context 
familiarity (American and Korean) and about the presence or absence of signaling 
(signaling and nonsignaling) on students‘ levels of comprehension, recall and cognitive 
load. Four hypotheses were made based upon the literature review in the previous 
chapter: 
Hypothesis 1: After controlling for students‘ prior knowledge about global 
warming and American and Korean geography, the collection of comprehension, recall 
and self-reported cognitive load variables will be significantly different among four 
groups created by variation in familiarity of context and presence or absence of signaling.  
Hypothesis 2: Context familiarity will have significant positive effects on 
comprehension, recall, and self-reported cognitive load.  
Hypothesis 3: Signaling will have significant positive effects on comprehension, 
recall, and self-reported cognitive load.  

81 
 
Hypothesis 4: Signaling will have different effects on comprehension, recall, and 
self-reported cognitive load depending on context familiarity.  
To examine the four hypotheses, a MANCOVA (multivariate analysis of 
covariance) was conducted using the SPSS statistical software version17.0.  
Data Evaluation 
MANCOVA provides information about whether statistically reliable mean 
differences between groups exist after adjusting dependent variables for differences on 
covariates (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). To achieve the best results, covariates and 
dependent variables were evaluated and unequal sample sizes, missing data, normality, 
and homogeneity of variance-covariance were examined. 
Evaluation of Dependent Variables’ Multicollinearity and Singularity 
MANCOVA works best when the dependent variables are only moderately 
correlated. According to Tabachnick and Fidell (2001), if there are two variables with a 
correlation above 0.70, one of the strongly correlated pairs needs to be removed or the 
pair combined to form a single measure. Originally, total seven dependent variables were 
employed to measure students‘ comprehension, recall and cognitive load. The 
correlations among seven dependent variables in the present study were initially 
examined (see Table 5).  
The seven dependent variables were three learning outcome variables, which were 
fact-level learning of reading materials (Learningfacts), levels of deep understanding 
(Inference-making), levels of recall (Recall), and four cognitive load variables, which 
were students‘ self-reported levels of interest (Interest), eagerness (Eager), difficulty 
(Difficulty), and mental effort (Mental effort). Because the correlation between Interest 

82 
 
and Eager was high (0.86), two dependent variables were combined into a single variable 
and rename it Motivation. Finally, six dependent variables (Learningfacts, Inference- 
Making, Recall, Motivation, Difficulty, and Mental Effort) were adopted for this study.

Univariate and Multivariate Outliers 
Univariate outliers were detected using the criterion of Z>3.3. Three cases in one 
dependent variable (Recall) were considered as outliers (see Table 6). The original scores 
were replaced by the score of the next highest plus one.

Unequal Sample Sizes and Missing Data 
Initially, 147 students participated in this study but data for 146 students remained 
after one case was deleted due to its multivariate outlier characteristic. The sample sizes 
in the four groups varied by a small amount: There were 37 cases in the American 
signaled condition, 34 in the American nonsignaled condition, 38 in the Korean signaled 

84 
 
condition, and 37 in the Korean nonsignaled condition. Because the MANCOVA analysis 
in SPSS now offers adjustment for unequal sample sizes (METHOD = UNIQUE), they 
are no longer problematic. No missing data were found in the four groups. 
Univariate and Multivariate Normality 
Univariate normality was examined by review of the data‘s histogram, skewness 
and kurtosis; none of these methods revealed any serious problem in the data. Because 
each univariate variable did not seem to violate normality assumptions and because there 
were far more cases than dependent variables in the smallest cell, it was assumed that 
multivariate normality was also satisfied (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001).   
Homogeneity of Variance-Covariance  
Homogeneity of variance-covariance was examined by Box‘s M test at the 
multivariate level and by Levene‘s test at the univariate level. In multivariate designs, 
homogeneity of variances are assumed, which means that dependent variables have equal 
levels of variance/covariance across the range of independent variable (Green & Salkind, 
2005). Table 8 indicates that Box‘s M was equal to 82.59, which confirms homogeneity 
of variance-covariance matrices (F(63, 46642) = 0.12, p>0.05).

Levene's test indicates whether the assumption of homogeneity of variance for 
each of the dependent variables is satisfied (Gardner, 2001). Table 9 shows that there was 
no statistically significant violation for the dependent variables except the Difficulty 
variable (F(3,142) = 3.69, p<0.05). Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) suggest a more 
conservative critical alpha level such as .025 or .01 rather than the conventional .05 level 
should be used for determining significance if homogeneity of error variances is violated 
for a variable in the univariate F-test. Thus, alpha level .025 for the Difficulty variable 
was used to determine the significance in the univariate F-test.

Assessing Covariates 
Homogeneity of regression. For multivariate analysis of covariance, an overall 
test of homogeneity of regression is required. That is because MANCOVA assumes that 
the regression between covariates and dependent variables in one group is the same as the 
regression in other groups. Only when this assumption is satisfied, using the average 
regression to adjust covariates is reasonable (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001). This 
assumption was evaluated by SPSS and showed no violation of this assumption. Table 10 
provides the SPSS syntax that was utilized for evaluating homogeneity of regression.

perform dimension reduction for the 15 items, one of factor analysis methods—principal 
component analysis with rotation method (Varimax with Kaiser normalization)—was 
conducted. Results are shown in Table 11. Three distinct factors were extracted using 
Kaiser‘s criterion, which indicates that only factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 
should be retained (Kaiser, 1960). The first factor included items 1 through 8 measuring 
levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming, the second factor 
consisted of four items determining levels of confidence in prior knowledge about 
American geography, and the third factor contained four items assessing levels of 
confidence in prior knowledge about Korean geography. The average scores from each 
factor were employed as the covariates for this study. Those were students‘ levels of 
confidence in their prior knowledge about global warming, American geography, and 
Korean geography.

Evaluating covariates. To adjust dependent variables effectively, covariates 
should be significantly related to them (Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991). The relationship 
between six dependent variables and three covariates were examined by dependent 
variable (DV)-covariate multiple regressions. All covariates were significantly related to 
at least one of the DVs, so all of them were remained and used as covariates. 
Data Analyses 
After the data were examined based on the assumptions of multivariate analysis of 
covariance and evaluating dependent variables and covariates, a MANCOVA was 
conducted to find out whether the four hypotheses were supported. Alpha was set at 0.05

differences on six dependent variables for four groups are displayed first in Table 12 to 
help understanding of the analyses. Those were three learning outcome variables which 
were fact-level learning, inference- making and recall, and three self-reported cognitive 
load variables which were motivation, difficulty, and mental effort.

Analyses of Research Hypotheses 
Hypothesis 1: After controlling for students’ prior knowledge about global 
warming and American and Korean geography, the collection of comprehension, recall 
and self-reported cognitive load variables will be significantly different among four 
groups created by variation in familiarity of context and presence or absence of signaling. 
To examine Hypothesis 1, comparisons were made between groups with a 
multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) using four groups (AS, ANS, KS, and 
KNS) as between-subject factors and the scores of students‘ fact-level learning, 
inference- making, recall, and their self-reported levels of their motivation, difficulty and 
mental effort as dependent variables. The MANCOVA revealed a significant treatment 

90 
 
effect, Wilks‘ λ=0.79 F(3,142) = 1.83, P<0.05, partial η2 = 0.08. Partial η2 is generally 
utilized to determine practical importance for MANCOVA. Cohen (1992) suggested 
criteria for partial η2. According to him, partial η2 .02 is small, 0.15 is medium and 0.35 is 
large. 
Univariate analysis revealed that groups were significantly different in their levels 
of inference- making ability (F(3,142) = 3.21, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.07) and perceived 
levels of difficulty (F(3,142) = 3.43, P<0.025,  partial η2 = 0.07). Results are presented in

As can be seen in Figure 3, students who read the nonsignaled American passage 
showed the highest inference-making performance (M = 3.38) and students who read the 
nonsignaled Korean and the signaled American passages show the second highest (M = 
3.00). Students who read the signaled Korean passage displayed the lowest inference- 
making performance (M = 2.79).

Hypothesis 2: Context familiarity will have significant positive effect on 
comprehension, recall and self-reported cognitive load.  
The second hypothesis was examined by the main effect of context. Context and 
signaling as between-subject factors and the same DVs were used for the comparisons 
between groups with a multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The MANCOVA 
revealed a significant context main effect, Wilks‘ λ=0.87 F(1,142) = 3.25, P<0.05, partial 
η2 =0.13. 
As can be seen in Table 15, univariate analysis revealed that context had a 
significant effect on inference-making (F(1,142) = 4.73, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.03), self-
reported levels of motivation (F(1,142) = 3.11, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.03), and perceived 
levels of difficulty (F(1,142) = 6.50, P<0.025,  partial η2 = 0.07).

Mean differences on fact-level learning, inference- making, recall, motivation, 
difficulty, and mental effort for context are shown below in Table 15. This shows that 
American context had positive effects on inference-making (American M = 3.18 and 
Korean M = 2.89), self-reported motivation (American M = 3.08 and Korean M = 2.88), 
and perceived difficulty (American M = 2.17 and Korean M = 2.54).

Hypothesis 3: Signaling will have significant positive effect on comprehension, 
recall and cognitive load.  
The MANCOVA revealed that signaling did not have a significant effect on DVs, 
Wilks‘ λ=0.92 F(1,142) = 0.08, P>0.05, partial η2 =0.08. Because the multivariate 
analysis showed an unexpected result, univariate analyses were also examined even 
though the multivariate effect was not significant. Univariate analysis showed that 
signaling had a significant effect on inference-making ability (See Table 16).

Hypothesis 4: Signaling will have different effects on comprehension, recall and 
cognitive load depending on context familiarity.  
The MANCOVA revealed no significant interaction between context and 
signaling, Wilks‘ λ=0.98  F(1,142) = 0.42, P>0.05, partial η2 =0.02, nor were there any  
significant univariate interaction on the dependent variables. Therefore, Hypothesis 4 was 
not supported by the statistical findings.  
Summary of Results 
The first hypothesis was supported by the data. The four groups distinguished by 
context and signaling were significantly different in the composition of dependent 
variables (Fact-level learning, inference making, recall, motivation, difficulty, and mental 
effort) after controlling covariates (the levels of students‘ confidence in prior knowledge 
about global warming, and about American and Korean Geography). Follow-up 
univariate analyses revealed that the four groups were significantly different in the levels 
of inference-making and perceived difficulty of the passages. The second hypothesis was 
also supported.  The performance of students who read the American context global 
warming passage was significantly different from that of students who read the Korean 
context passage on the combination of dependent variables. Specifically, univariate 

96 
 
analyses showed differences favoring the American context groups in their levels of 
inference-making, self-reported motivation, and perceived difficulty of the passages. The 
third and fourth hypotheses were not supported by results of the MANCOVA analysis. 
Even though the presence of signaling did not significantly differentiate groups in the 
composite set of dependent variables, the univariate analyses showed that students who 
read the nonsignaled version performed significantly better in inference-making than 
students who read the signaled version. In contrast to the expectation that signaling would 
have more effect on unfamiliar Korean context in the composition of dependent variables, 
no significant interaction between context and signaling was found.  
Other Research Findings 
Prior knowledge about American and Korean geography. Potential differnces 
between the participants‘ levels of confidence in American and Korean geography were 
investigated by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). A one way ANOVA revealed that 
there was a significant difference between the level of confidence about prior knowledge 
of American (M = 94.76, SD = 14.23) and Korean (M = 41.16, SD = 26.61) geography 
(F(1, 142) = 460.44, P <0.01, partial η2 = 0.61). As expected, participants in the current 
study—who all were American students— were more confident in the levels of prior 
knowledge about American geography than Korean geography.  
The effect of segments. The passages about global warming were segmented into 
four parts and the possibility of changes across the four segments in students‘ reported 
levels of motivation, judged difficulty and mental effort were examined by an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA). A one way ANOVA also revealed segments had a significant effect 
on motivation (F (3,142) = 4.47, P<0.05).  

97 
 
The mean plots for each of the four groups that are presented in Figure 5 show 
that the patterns among four segments were similar across the four groups in terms of 
their respective assessments of their motivation and mental effort. Students showed 
moderate levels of motivation on the first segment and they showed the least motivation 
on the second segment. On the third segment, their levels of motivation increased, but 
then were reduced again on the final segment. These patterns were same in self-reported 
mental effort. Students invested the highest self- reported mental effort on the third 
segment in which they exhibited the highest self- reported motivation whereas they 
reported the least mental effort on the second segment in which they showed the least 
motivation.

The predictors of mental effort. Students were asked to report the amount of 
mental effort as a measure of cognitive load. Because students‘ perceived level of mental 
effort was not attributed to the independent variables in the current study, context 
familiarity and presence or absence of signaling, multiple regression was conducted in 

98 
 
order to probe significant factors that might explain the variability in mental effort. The 
predictors were the levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming, the 
levels of confidence about American geography and Korean geography, and the levels of 
reported motivation and difficulty. Regression analyses were performed within SPSS.  
The linear combination of predictors was significantly related to the level of 
mental effort, F(5, 145) = 15.76, p<0.001. The sample multiple correlation coefficient 
was 0.60 indicating that approximately 36% of the variance of mental effort could be 
accounted for by the linear combination of the predictors. Table 18 shows that only two 
of the independent variables (the level of confidence in prior knowledge about global 
warming and the level of self- reported motivation) contribute significantly to prediction 
of levels of self-reported mental effort.

To further examine the current data, the students were divided into two groups by 
a median score (median = 3.0) of self-reported motivation. Students who reported their 

99 
 
levels of motivation equal to or higher than the median 3.0 constituted a high-motivation 
group and students who informed their self- reported motivation lower than 3.0 formed a 
low-motivation group. High- and low-motivation groups then were employed as an 
independent variable and levels of mental effort as a dependent variable. The result of 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that self-reported levels of mental effort were 
significantly different between the high- (M = 2.60) and low-motivation groups (M = 
3.17), F(1, 144) = 24.25, P <0.01, partial η2 = 0.14.    
The effects of levels of confidence in prior knowledge. Possible effects of levels of 
confidence in prior knowledge about global warming on six dependent variables were 
examined. That is, whether effects of context or signaling on the dependent variables 
varied depending on students‘ levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global 
warming were investigated. The students were divided into two groups by the median 
level (median = 60) of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming. Thus, the 
high-confidence group included students who had confidence scores equal to or higher 
than 60 and the low-confidence group consisted of students who reported confidence 
scores lower than 60.   
The effects of levels of confidence in global warming knowledge and context on 
six dependent variables were examined first. The multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) revealed a significant main effect of context (Wilks‘ λ=0.90 F(1,142) = 2.61, 
P<0.05, partial η2 =0.10), and a significant main effect of levels of confidence in global 
warming knowledge (Wilks‘ λ=0.89 F(1,142) = 2.77, P<0.05, partial η2 =0.11). No 
interaction between them was significant in either the univariate or multivariate analysis. 
Univariate analysis showed that the level of confidence in global warming knowledge 

100 
 
had a significant effect on fact-level learning (F(1,142) = 7.16, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.05),  
inference-making (F(1,142) = 11.37, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.07) and self-reported 
motivation (F(1,142) = 4.48, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.03). All of these differences favored 
the high-confidence group. 
   The effects of levels of confidence in global warming knowledge and signaling 
on six dependent variables were also examined. The results of multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) showed a significant main effect of levels of confidence in global 
warming (Wilks‘ λ=0.90 F(1,142) = 2.45, P<0.05, partial η2 =0.10). The univariate 
analysis revealed that the interaction between levels of confidence in global warming 
knowledge and presence or absence of signaling was significant in inference-making 
(F(1,142) = 4.08, P<0.05,  partial η2 = 0.03). Table 19 shows mean scores and standard 
deviations in inference-making between the two groups, and Figure 6 also shows the 
mean differences between them.

Chapter V 
Discussion 
This study was undertaken based on the writer‘s curiosity about how familiar and 
unfamiliar geographical background context for the same content influences readers‘ 
comprehension, recall and cognitive load, and how presence or absence of signaling for 
the content affects them. In addition, this study examined the writer‘s question about how 
presence of signaling might modify the effects of familiar or unfamiliar context on 
comprehension, recall, and cognitive load. Four hypotheses were explored and the results 
were presented in the previous chapter. In this chapter, the results are discussed and 
interpreted from the perspectives of schema theory and cognitive load theory (CLT). 
 In this writer‘s judgment, the most important findings addressed in the previous 
chapter were that: 1) significant differences existed between American students‘ levels of 
confidence in their prior knowledge about American geography and Korean geography; 2) 
four groups created by variation in familiarity of context and by presence or absence of 
signaling exhibited significantly different levels of inference- making and perceived 
levels of difficulty; 3) context familiarity had significant positive effects on the levels of 
inference-making, the self-reported levels of motivation, and the perceived levels of 
difficulty; 4) presence of signaling had a negative effect on the levels of inference- 
making especially for the group having high-confidence in their global warming 
knowledge (a further examination found that an expertise reversal effect existed in 
students‘ inference-making performances); and 5) students‘ levels of mental effort were 
accounted for by their levels of confidence in prior knowledge about global warming and 
their self-reported levels of motivation. The pattern of changes in the level of motivation 

103 
 
across four segments and those in the levels of mental effort across the four segments 
were quite similar. After the discussion of the results, implications and limitations are 
discussed, and conclusions offered.  
Discussion of Results 
Significant Differences in Prior Knowledge about American and Korean Geography 
In the current study, context was defined by two different geographical 
backgrounds —American and Korean—that were employed in text materials used to 
describe global warming. It was assumed that the American context for encountering 
information about global warming would be more familiar for American students while 
the Korean context would be less familiar for them. The analysis for the level of self-
rated prior knowledge about American and Korean geography showed that the American 
students were in fact significantly more confident in their knowledge of American 
geography (M = 94.76) than Korean geography (M = 41.16), F(1, 142) = 460.44, P <0.01, 
partial η2 = 0.61.  
Based on the well-known relationship between self-efficacy and actual 
performance (e.g., Bandura, 1982; Pajares, & Miller, 1994; Schunk, 1984; Shell, Murphy 
& Bruning, 1989), participants‘ stating their greater confidence in their knowledge of 
American geography likely indicates that they also would be more familiar and 
knowledgeable about it. Thus, the finding of large differences here is reasonable evidence 
for the assumption that participants‘ American geographical knowledge was greater on 
average than their Korean geographical knowledge and that the two conditions would 
have been likely to be sufficient to create two different contexts for learning about global 
warming.

Significant Differences among Four Groups in Perceived Level of Difficulty  
The analysis for Hypothesis 1 compared four groups (American signaled, 
American nonsignaled, Korean signaled, and Korean nonsignaled) on the collection of 
six dependent variables (Learning facts, Inference-making, Recall, Motivation, Difficulty 
of passages, and Mental effort) after controlling students‘ levels of confidence in prior 
knowledge about global warming and about American and Korean geography. The first 
hypothesis was supported by the results of a multivariate analysis of covariate 
(MANCOVA), which showed that the four groups were significantly different on the 
combination of six variables, Wilks‘ λ=0.79 F(3,142) = 1.83, P<0.05, partial η2 = 0.08.  
Subsequent univariate F-tests used to interpret the MANCOVA result showed that 
the four experimental groups differed significantly in participants‘ judged levels of 
difficulty and inference-making. The study‘s participants, who were American college 
students thought that the nonsignaled Korean context was the most difficult passage (M = 
2.60) whereas the signaled American context was the least difficult (M = 2.15).  
The difference in adjudged difficulty can be explained by schema theory and CLT. 
From the perspective of schema theory, the Korean geographical background would be 
less likely to activate American students‘ schemata because it was unfamiliar to them. 
That is, information about the Korean geographical background as well as information 
relating to global warming phenomenon would need to be simultaneously processed in 
working memory. In contrast, the American geographical background would not have 
needed  deliberate processing  in working memory because the familiar geographical 
background could be comprehended with little or no effort; automatic schema-driven 
processing would free working memory capacity (Mayer, 2005; Sweller, 2005; Sweller & 

105 
 
Chandler, 1994). For instance, for those reading the ―American‖ passage, the explanation 
of global warming employed the names of U.S. cities or states/provinces, and the 
measurement units being used in the U.S. such as Fahrenheit and miles. When students 
are accessing familiar information from their long-term memory that is already 
schematically organized in their schemata, working memory limits are less likely to be 
reached. In contrast, using similar reasoning, reading materials in a Korean context would 
require more working memory capacity and also lead to judgments of the participants 
that the Korean context as being more difficult.  
These results also can be interpreted by the perspective of CLT. According to 
CLT, intrinsic load is the load inherently tied to the material being learned (Chandler & 
Sweller, 1991). Intrinsic cognitive load depends on the level of element interactivity, 
which is the number of elements that should be handled concurrently (van Merriënboer & 
Ayres, 2005). Materials with high intrinsic load are difficult to understand because the 
number of elements processed simultaneously is large (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 
2005). From this perspective, it can be inferred that the Korean context would impose 
higher intrinsic cognitive load than the American context because students‘ reading about 
global warming in the Korean context had to simultaneously process elements in the 
unfamiliar geographical background and elements in the content regarding global 
warming. This situation would be likely to increase element interactivity, generate greater 
intrinsic load and aggravate perceived level of difficulty.  
A similar explanation may be offered for why the students regarded the 
nonsignaled passages as being more difficult than the signaled passages. In general, 
signaling helps readers direct their attention to more important information and ignore 

106 
 
irrelevant information (Loman & Mayer, 1983; Mautone & Mayer, 2001). In other words, 
by minimizing extra processing of unimportant information (Moreno, 2007), signaling 
reduces element interactivity and in turn, decreases intrinsic load and perceived level of 
difficulty in text. In the present study, the signaled passages employed a title, headings, a 
preview, a summary statement, logical connectives, and typographical cues (bold face) 
for university names. As shown in previous research (e.g., Lorch & Chen, 1986; Lorch & 
Lorch, 1985; Lorch, Lorch, & Inman, 1993), providing such signaling devices was 
expected to help the students concentrate on important information and ignore 
unnecessary information and thus lead to decrease of levels of difficulty in the signaled 
passages as well as decrease of element interactivity. As a result, the students considered 
the unsignaled passages as being more difficult than the signaled passages.   
Context Effects on Comprehension and Cognitive load 
The design for analysis of Hypothesis 2 involved utilizing context as an 
independent variable and six dependent variables within a multiple analysis of covariance 
(MANCOVA). The second hypothesis was supported by the MANCOVA result 
revealing a significant context main effect, Wilks‘ λ=0.87 F(1,142) = 3.25, P<0.05, 
partial η2 =0.13. Subsequent univariate F-tests used to interpret the MANCOVA result 
showed that the four groups were significantly different in inference-making, self-
reported levels of motivation, perceived levels of difficulty.  
Students‘ levels of understanding were gauged by five inference-making 
questions, designed to measure deep understanding and twenty-five comprehension 
questions, designed to measure learning facts and information. Students who read 
American context passages showed significantly better inference-making about global 

107 
 
warming (inference-making M = 3.18) than students who read the Korean context 
passages (inference-making M = 2.89). Effects of context were less clear, however, for 
the multiple-choice fact-learning questions, which were targeted at fact-level learning. In 
other words, the students who read information framed in an American context also 
exhibited the result favoring fact-level learning, but only marginally higher scores (M = 
18.00) than the students who read information framed in a Korean context (M =17.48).  
Students who read the American context passages also reported a higher level of 
motivation (M = 3.08), and reported a lower level of perceived difficulty (M = 2.17) than 
students who read the Korean context passages (motivation M = 2.88; difficulty M = 2.54, 
respectively). Results also showed that familiar context exerted a positive effect on deep 
comprehension, as measured by the inference-making variable. Familiar context also had 
a positive effect on cognitive load supported by perceptions of a higher level of 
motivation and a lower level of difficulty.  
These findings support the claim that encountering information—in this case, 
information about global warming—in a familiar context can facilitate students‘ deep 
comprehension and produce higher levels of motivation and lower levels of difficulty. 
The fact that students‘ reading information in a familiar context was beneficial in terms 
of deeper understanding, higher self-reported levels of motivation, and lower perceived 
levels of difficulty is explained by the perspective of CLT, specifically by the concepts of 
germane load and intrinsic load (Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998). Germane load 
is the portion of load invested in processes directly relevant to learning (Sweller, 2005) 
and intrinsic load is the portion of load caused by intrinsic characteristics of the task itself 
and determined by element interactivity (Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998).  

108 
 
Significant differences in students‘ self-reported levels of motivation can be 
interpreted by germane load. Learners need to be motivated in order to invest their mental 
resources in learning activities for schema activation, construction and automation. Paas, 
Tuovinen, van Merriënboer and Darabi (2005), for instance, suggest that motivation is a 
critical factor for engaging learners in relevant learning activities and enhancing their 
engagement. Paas, Renkl and Sweller (2003) argue that an increase in effort or 
motivation ―...can increase the cognitive resources devoted to a task. If relevant to 
schema acquisition and automation, such an increase also constitutes an increase in 
germane cognitive load‖ (p. 2).   
Based upon the reasoning above, the self-reported level of motivation can be 
regarded as a reasonable proxy for germane cognitive load. If one group of learners were 
more motivated and obtained higher scores on a test than another group, this could 
indicate that the former group invested more mental effort in the task relevant to schema 
construction and automation, and that their self-reported levels of motivation would be 
measuring levels of germane load invested. However, this reasoning cannot be utilized in 
a case where learners in one group showed poorer learning outcomes even though they 
reported being more highly motivated than another group. In such a case, because a 
higher level of motivation has not led to higher learning outcomes, the levels of 
motivation cannot be a proxy for gauging levels of germane load. In the current study, 
however, because students‘ levels of deep understanding measured by inference-making 
questions in a familiar American context condition were in fact higher than those in an 
unfamiliar Korean condition, the higher levels of perceived motivation reported by the 

109 
 
students in an American context condition can be used as a potential index of the 
germane load allocated to inference-making.  
As addressed before, level of perceived difficulty is influenced by intrinsic load 
measured by element interactivity (van Merriënboer & Ayres, 2005). Because the 
American geographical background was familiar for American students, they presumably 
did not need to invest as much of their mental resources to comprehend information in 
the passage. That is, if the background information was processed with little or no effort, 
the number of elements that needed to be processed simultaneously (element interactivity) 
would be small, which would lead to a decrease of intrinsic load and in turn to a decrease 
perceived difficulty. Participants could allocate most of their mental resources to 
understanding the global warming content. In other words, more mental resources would 
be available for deep understanding.  
In summary, the result showing positive context effects on inference-making and 
on perceived difficulty and motivation demonstrate that a familiar context for learning 
new information can potentially increase germane load and decrease intrinsic load and, as 
a consequence, produce deeper understanding. In contrast, additional cognitive load 
introduced by presenting important content (e.g., of scientific findings, principles) in an 
unfamiliar context can decrease readers‘ motivation, increase the sense of the content‘s 
difficulty, and reduce deep understanding of the content by diverting attention away from 
the central tasks of comprehension (Tabbers, Martens, & Van Merriëboer, 2004), and 
increasing extraneous cognitive load.  
 
 

110 
 
Negative Signaling Effects on Deep Comprehension 
The third hypothesis—that signaling would have significant positive effect on 
comprehension, recall, and cognitive load—was not supported by the MANCOVA result. 
Signaling and nonsignaling groups were not significantly different in analysis of the 
combination of six dependent variables. Even though most subsequent univariate F- tests 
did not show significant differences between two groups, the results mostly favored the 
signaling groups, which showed somewhat higher levels of fact-level learning and recall, 
along with higher self-reported levels of motivation and lower levels of difficulty. 
Although only one univariate F-test was significant, this finding was an especially 
interesting one—that signaling had a negative effect on deep comprehension gauged by 
inference-making questions (signaling M = 2.81, and nonsiganling M = 3.18). This result 
was unexpected—Hypothesis 3 had predicted that signaling would have a positive effect 
on inference-making.  
A further examination was conducted to find out why signaling might have had 
this unexpected effect on deep comprehension. One possibility was that inference-making 
may have been affected by levels of prior knowledge. To examine whether the effect of 
signaling on deep understanding was different depending on participants‘ levels of 
confidence in their prior knowledge about global warming, students were divided into 
high and low-confidence group by a median split on their self-reported prior knowledge 
about global warming. A significant interaction between signaling and low/high-
confidence group was detected. Students who had high-confidence in their prior 
knowledge about global warming and were in the nonsignaled passage condition 
exhibited better inference-making ability (M = 3.76) than the signaled passage condition 

111 
 
(M = 3.03). In contrast, students in the low-prior knowledge confidence group showed 
better inference-making performance in the signaled passage condition (M = 2.74) than in 
the nonsignaled passage condition (M = 2.64).  
As previously stated, students displaying higher confidence in their prior 
knowledge of global warming was taken in the present study as an indicator of greater 
actual knowledge about the subject matter content, global warming, based on the well-
known relationship between self-efficacy and actual performance (Bandura, 1982). That 
is, high and low reported confidence about levels of prior knowledge was considered to 
be an indicator of actual level of expertise. Specifically, students reporting more 
confidence in their prior knowledge about global warming were judged to be more likely 
to actually have higher levels of expertise about global warming, while those with lower 
confidence about their prior knowledge were judged to be more likely to have low levels 
expertise about global warming. If these assumptions are true, then the expertise reversal 
effect can be applied to explain the results (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003). 
Low prior knowledge learners presumably lack schemata relevant to a task or 
situation at hand, so instructional guidance can act as a substitute for activating pre-
existing schemata relevant to learning (Sweller, 1999). Thus, providing instructional 
guidance minimizes working memory load as well as enhances their learning. In contrast, 
high prior knowledge learners bring more pre-existing schemata to the process of 
comprehending a situation or task, so additional instructional guidance is redundant. It 
may even be, as in the present instance, that providing instructional guidance can 
interfere with learning by forcing learners to invest unnecessary mental effort in the 
additional instructional guidance (Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler, & Sweller, 2003). 

112 
 
In the present study, signaling devices such as a title, headings, a preview, a 
summary statement, logical connectives and bold face typographical cues were employed 
to help students direct their attention to important aspects of the text materials. Providing 
such signaling devices was effective for enhancing deep understanding necessary to 
inference-making for the low-prior knowledge group. Students in the high-prior 
knowledge group, however, may have been unable to avoid attending to the information 
in the signals even as they did not require signaling devices due to their high levels of 
prior knowledge. That is, for the high-prior knowledge group, providing signaling 
devices may have produced extraneous load. As a result, this group‘s processes of 
constructing more sophisticated mental representations for deep understanding may have 
been hindered, resulting in poor performances in inference-making.  
Predictors of Mental Effort 
Self-reported levels of mental effort devoted to reading one of the four different 
kinds of text (American signaled, American nonsignaled, Korean signaled and Korean 
nonsignaled) were measured by participants‘ overall estimates of how much cognitive 
load was invested to understand each of the four different kinds of text. Unlike the 
expectations based upon the literature review (Bransford & Johnson, 1972; Kalyuga, & 
Sweller, 2004; Steffensen, Joag-dev, & Anderson, 1979; Sweller & Chandler, 1994), 
neither context nor signaling made any difference among the four groups in their self-
reported levels of mental effort. In order to find out whether other factors might have 
affected self-reported levels of mental effort, however, additional exploration of possible 
factors was undertaken using a multiple regression analysis. Levels of confidence in prior 
knowledge about global warming, levels of confidence in the US geography, levels of 

113 
 
confidence in Korean geography, self reported levels of motivation and perceived levels 
of difficulty were entered as predictors of mental effort.  
The multiple regression results indicated that the level of mental effort was 
significantly accounted for by the level of self-reported motivation and level of self-
reported prior knowledge variables. There was a substantial positive part correlation 
(0.57) between the level of mental effort and the level of motivation. The part correlation 
for the level of mental effort and the level of motivation is the correlation between two 
variables after partialling out of the level of motivation variability shared with the other 
four predictors (Gardner, 2001; Tabachinick, & Fidell, 2001). This result therefore can be 
interpreted as follows—that students who were more motivated tended to invest more 
mental effort. Similar patterns in the level of motivation and mental effort across the four 
segments (See Figure 5, p. 97) also supported this interpretation. Students showed 
moderate levels of motivation on the first and fourth segments, the least motivation on 
the second segment, and the highest motivation on the third segment, a pattern also 
observed in self-reported mental effort. 
The part correlation between the level of mental effort and the level of prior 
knowledge was -0.19 indicating that students with higher levels of confidence in prior 
knowledge generally tended to invest less mental effort. As previously argued, it was 
assumed that students who were more confident in their prior knowledge about global 
warming were likely to have more knowledge about it. Being more knowledgeable about 
something means that learners already have schemata relevant to the process of 
comprehending and thus can invest less mental effort to understand.  

114 
 
Somewhat surprisingly, however, readers‘ judgments about the difficulty of 
reading tasks were not a significant factor in predicting level of mental effort. The part 
correlation between the level of mental effort and the level of difficulty was 0.04, 
indicating almost no relationship between these two variables after the level of difficulty 
variability shared with the other four predictors (levels of prior knowledge about global 
warming, levels of confidence in the US geography, levels of confidence in Korean 
geography, and levels of motivation) was partialled out. Thus, it is not guaranteed that 
learners automatically exert more mental efforts when they deal with more difficult 
materials. Instead, levels of expertise should perhaps be more closely considered in 
determining how much mental effort will be invested (Kalyuga & Sweller, 2004).  If 
learners consider a learning task as too easy or too difficult, they may not be eager to 
invest their mental effort and will quit learning. Paas, Tuovinen, van Merriënboer and 
Darabi (2005) stated, for instance, that ―…as long as a task is not too easy and not too 
difficult, ratings of task difficulty may correlate highly with ratings of invested mental 
effort‖ (p.32).  To be a significant predictor for the level of mental effort, the level of 
difficulty needs to be adequate for learners to be eager to devote their mental resources. 
To the extent which learners consider learning material as neither too easy nor too 
difficult, perceived levels of difficulty could be a predictor for how much mental efforts 
they would exert.      
Limitations and Implications 
Limitations of the Current Study 
One limitation of the current study is its generalizability. That is, the present 
findings may be limited to materials in which geographical backgrounds serve as context. 

115 
 
As previously discussed, context can be characterized in many ways. For instance, 
context has been variously defined as words (e.g., Schvaneveldt & Meyer, 1973), 
sentences (e.g., Kleiman, 1980), paragraphs, a whole story, settings, (e.g., Carey et al., 
1981), and even more broadly, as culture (e.g.,Steffensen, Joag-dev, & Anderson, 1979).  
Depending on how a researcher defines context, context effects on comprehension and 
recall could be present or not. Thus, the findings regarding the effects of context in the 
present study are restricted to materials in which the familiarity of geographical contexts 
for information is varied.    
Another generalizability-related limitation is tied to the nature of multivariate 
analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). Tabachnick and Fidell (2001) have pointed out that 
the result of MANCOVA ―… generalizes only to those populations from which the 
researcher has randomly sampled‖ (p.328). In the current study, participants were 
randomly assigned into four groups using a random number generator. Because a 
MANCOVA does not adjust for failure of random sampling, in order to generalize the 
results of MANCOVA from this study, the way of sampling should be cautiously 
examined.  
The second limitation is that even though the results were significant, most effect 
sizes presented by partial η2 were relatively small. Partial η2 is the proportion of variance 
that can be predicted from one factor when the effects of the other factor and the 
interaction between them are partialed out (Pierce, Block, & Aguinis, 2004). Partial η2 is 
generally used to determine practical importance. According to Cohen (1992), partial 
η2 .02 is small, 0.15 is medium and 0.35 is large. The present multivariate analysis of 
covariance (MANCOVA) using four groups as a between-subject factor and six 

116 
 
dependent variables showed small η2 (0.08) effects. Follow-up univariate F-tests likewise 
showed small η2 for levels of difficulty (0.07) and levels of inference-making (0.07), 
while univariate F-tests after the MANCOVA employing context as a between-subject 
factor showed small effect sizes including the level of inference-making (0.03), levels of 
self-reported motivation (0.03), and self-reported difficulty of the materials (0.07). The 
univariate F-test for signaling also revealed a small effect size on the inference-making 
outcome (0.03). The results of the present MANCOVA showed mostly small η2. Only the 
multivariate result by context as a factor approached a medium effect size (0.13).  
Effect sizes need to be considered in the context of each study because there is no 
simple and easy way for determining practical importance. Even a very small effect size 
can have high practical importance—for example, if the effect size shows practical 
importance of a study for life or death, such as pharmaceutical development. Also, the 
size of an effect is reliant to some extent on limitations in measurement, design and 
method. Not surprisingly, larger effects are generated by better measurement, design and 
method. If the effect size is small because of measurement errors or design and not 
because of real small differences between the treatment group and control group, overall 
methods including measurement and design should be carefully inspected (McCartney & 
Rosenthal, 2000).   
The third limitation is that the reading materials in the present study were 
presented in segments, which may have reduced the effects of context and signaling. 
Prior to segmentation, the four versions of reading materials about global warming were 
quite long, around 2000 words continuously for each version. To permit examining the 
changes of levels of motivation, difficulty and mental effort as the participants read the 

117 
 
materials, however, the reading materials were divided into four parts. While allowing for 
measurement of variables of interest, difficulty and mental effort as students read, it may 
have been that segmentation may have lowered cognitive load by reducing the amount of 
information needing to be processed in working memory at one time (Mayer, et al., 1999; 
Mayer & Chandler, 2001; Moreno, 2007).  
If the reading materials were not segmented, they presumably would have 
generated somewhat higher levels of cognitive load, especially for those participants 
encountering global warming information in the unfamiliar context conditions because 
schemata relevant to the unfamiliar geographical background would not be available. 
However, the amount of load imposed by unfamiliar context might have been attenuated 
by segmentation because the amount needing to be read at any one time was reduced 
(Pollock, Chandler, & Sweller, 2002). If the segmentation resulted in students‘ limited 
working memory capacity not being exceeded or cognitive load being effectively reduced, 
impacts of signaling on adjusting presumed levels of cognitive load would likely be 
decreased. Therefore, Hypothesis 4, which was based upon an assumption that signaling 
would more effectively reduce cognitive load for unfamiliar context might not have been 
supported because of the ineffectiveness of signaling but because of cognitive load 
reducing effects of segmentation.  
Implications for Future Research   
The present study demonstrated that presenting an unfamiliar text context (in this 
case, a geographical one) for learning technical information can constitute a disadvantage 
for students—interfering with their deep understanding of the global warming content of 
the passages, increasing  perceived difficulty of passages, and lowering the students‘ 

118 
 
motivation.  Given the pattern of these findings, it could be inferred that students‘ 
intrinsic load was increased and their germane load decreased due to the context 
unfamiliarity. Providing signaling in passages that included unfamiliar contexts generally 
did not compensate for these disadvantages. 
From this, a first implication for future research is that other possible instructional 
manipulations should be examined that might compensate for the disadvantages resulting 
from an unfamiliar text background. For example, it likely would be valuable to closely 
examine the positive effects of segmentation (e.g., Hasler, Kersten, & Sweller, 2007; 
Moreno, 2007; Mayer & Chandler, 2001) and of building learners‘ prior knowledge about 
unfamiliar contextual features before reading scientific content that will be embedded in 
an unfamiliar context. The study of Mayer, Moreno, Boire, and Vagge (1999), for 
instance, showed results favoring segmentation of information employed to reduce 
cognitive load. Students who viewed a segmented animation describing the process of 
lightning formation outperformed these students who viewed an unsegmented narrated 
animation on retention and transfer tests. Regarding the issue of unfamiliar context, the 
instructional approach of Pollock, Chandler, and Sweller (2002) illustrates the value of 
methods that build prior knowledge before learning. Their findings suggest that complex 
problems can be effectively approached only after students‘ appropriate prior knowledge 
is built.  
The second implication of the present study for future research is that possible 
indirect ways to measure levels of intrinsic load and germane load were suggested by the 
methods and findings of the current study. In CLT, it is important to clearly understand 
the three sources of cognitive load and that the sum of these sources should not exceed 

119 
 
learners‘ working memory capacities (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005; Sweller, 2005). 
It is not possible to measure the three different kinds of load directly. What is possible, 
however, is to indirectly measure the different kinds of load through other avenues.   
For the measurement of levels of germane load, for instance, the present 
researcher proposed that assessments of self-reported levels of motivation could be used 
as an index of germane cognitive load. If one condition of an experiment increases both 
learners‘ levels of motivation and their performances, levels of motivation presumably 
can be an indication of levels of germane load invested in that condition (Paas, Renkl, & 
Sweller, 2003). This conclusion is based on the logic that if learners are more motivated 
by a condition, the resulting higher motivation can lead to the investment of more mental 
effort relevant to learning and in turn to enhanced performance. If a condition increases 
only the level of motivation but learners‘ performance is the same or decreased, however, 
level of motivation cannot be a factor to indicate the level of germane load invested.  
If intrinsic load is assessed by element interactivity (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 
2005), it likewise is almost impossible to directly measure element interactivity in a 
material for each learner. The current study showed, however, that learners‘ self-reported 
levels of difficulty could serve as an indirect indicator of intrinsic load imposed by the 
materials. If learners in one condition perceive that they are experiencing more difficulty 
and it is possible to interpret that the condition is likely to contribute to the increase of 
element interactivity, the learners‘ levels of difficulty may indicate the level of intrinsic 
load imposed by the material. It is believed that the approach suggested by the current 
study for measuring levels of germane load and intrinsic load indirectly can provide a 
valuable addition to research on CLT.  

120 
 
In the present study, it was not always clear whether learners‘ levels of mental 
effort gauged the amount of overall cognitive load or one of the three different kinds of 
load imposed by the manipulation of context and signaling. Self-reported levels of mental 
effort by themselves are not enough to show how the sum of cognitive load or individual 
dimensions of cognitive load are being affected by the instructional manipulations of 
context and signaling. Future studies are needed that clarify the relationship among 
germane load, intrinsic load, and extraneous load and the ways to measure of each type of 
cognitive load and their sum. 
A third implication from this study is that learners‘ levels of prior knowledge 
must be considered when any instructional technique is applied to learners. An expertise 
reversal effect was demonstrated in the current study, where signaling had a negative 
effect on students‘ deep understanding in the high-prior knowledge group, but helped 
students‘ deep understanding in the low-prior knowledge group. According to Kalyuga, 
et al. (2003), highly guided instructional material can be redundant for more experienced 
learners, even though it is essential for less experienced learners. That is, instructional 
techniques that are effective for less experienced learners can lose their effectiveness or 
lead to negative learning outcomes as learners become more experienced and expert (e.g., 
McNamara et al.,1996; Tuovinen & Sweller, 1999). It also would seem highly desirable 
to examine what kind of cognitive process (e.g., shallow comprehension, deep 
comprehension, and simple recall) is the target of the instructional techniques.   
For future research related to the third implication, it is important that any 
manipulation fostered to compensate disadvantages caused by unfamiliar context be 
examined in conjunction with learners‘ levels of prior knowledge. An investigation of the 

121 
 
relationship between segmentation and learners‘ prior knowledge could be one possibility. 
It also would be interesting to examine whether segmenting a learning material is 
beneficial for more experienced learners as contrasted to less experienced learners.  
Results from the current study showed that signaling negatively affected only 
deep understanding, and then only for the learners with higher prior knowledge of the 
Korean geographical context. Fact-level learning and recall were not hindered by 
signaling in any group. Therefore, it would be also valuable in future research to examine 
the relationship among instructional techniques, kinds of learners‘ cognitive process, and 
learners‘ levels of expertise. An investigation about how instructional techniques affect 
different learner‘s cognitive processes depending on levels of learners‘ expertise would 
be important in many educational settings.  
Conclusions 
The effect of context on comprehension and recall has been defined variously in 
previous research and examined in many prior studies.  The current study extended the 
scope of context related  variables in text learning by defining it in terms of a 
geographical setting for information that was expected to be either more or less familiar 
to readers. To this writer‘s knowledge, it is among the first to explore the learning and 
recall of technical information (on global warming phenomena) presented and illustrated 
by examples drawn from different geographical background contexts (familiar American 
context and unfamiliar Korean context). Findings of this study also were interpreted from 
the perspective of CLT. The results of the current study supported the predictions that a 
familiar setting for encountering new, technically-oriented information would facilitate 

122 
 
readers‘ comprehension and reduce their cognitive load whereas an unfamiliar contextual 
framework would reduce their understanding and increase cognitive load.  
For example, the students in familiar context conditions showed a higher level 
inference-making (deep comprehension), higher self-reported levels of motivation, and 
lower perceived levels of difficulty than the students in unfamiliar context conditions. 
The results were interpreted by the perspective of CLT. It also was inferred that students‘ 
higher self-reported levels of motivation in familiar context conditions contributed to 
increasing germane load invested because the higher levels of motivation lead to a higher 
performance of inference-making. In general, students‘ lower perceived levels of 
difficulty in the familiar context conditions were attributed to low element interactivity, 
as an aspect of intrinsic load. However, an expectation that offering signaling devices 
would compensate for higher cognitive load and lower performances caused by the 
unfamiliar context conditions was not generally supported. Rather, a negative signaling 
effect was detected on inference-making. Further examination found out an expertise 
reversal effect. Providing signaling devices interfered with students‘ deep understanding 
in a high-prior knowledge group while they enhanced students‘ deep understanding in a 
low-prior knowledge group.   
The current study suggests several potential ideas for future research. Among 
these are examining ways to compensate for disadvantages resulted from information 
situated in an unfamiliar context, scrutinizing the relationship among three kinds of load 
and the measurement of them, and considering levels of learners‘ expertise in any new 
instructional manipulation. More research is needed to identify relationships among 
instructional techniques, the kinds of learners‘ cognitive process (e.g., deep 

123 
 
comprehension or recall) that are the target of any intervention, and learners‘ levels of 
expertise.

Global warming refers to the continuous increase in the average measured 
temperature of the earth‘s atmosphere and its oceans. It is important to understand global 
warming because more and more people are concerned about how global warming will 
affect their health and the well-being of current and future generations. Most scientists 
agree that the temperature increase can permanently change the earth‘s climate and that 
climate change is one of the most serious challenges to our future well-being. Also, → 
(Logical connectives) these scientists have concluded that that there is a significant 
human influence on climate change.  
 Globally, a warmer earth will bring about increases in temperatures, increases in 
precipitation, increases in the strength of tropical cyclones, and cause rises in sea level. 
Researchers think that greenhouse gases and greenhouse effect are largely responsible for 
global warming. Global warming also leads to a wide range of impacts on wildlife and 
human health such as extreme heat waves, increases in waterborne disease, and increases 
in ground-level ozone. → (Preview) In this essay, employing examples from the US, the 
causes and impacts of global warming in America and in general will be addressed in 
detail.

Increases in Temperature → (Heading & Boldface)   
In America, the average temperature has been increasing and the rate of change 
has accelerated since 1983. The seven warmest years in history have occurred since 1990. 
During that period, temperatures have been above average across most of the United 
States, with temperatures in Colorado, Wyoming, and Utah much above normal for 
winter in 2004 and 2005. Also, much-above-average temperatures were observed in 
California, Nevada and Arizona during summer. A new record of seven consecutive days 
at or above 125°F was observed in July 2005 at Death Valley, California.  
These phenomena show that the US is not an exception of global warming. 
According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
globally, our planet has warmed about 1.3 ºF in the twentieth century. Moreover, → 
(Logical connectives) according to research at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, → (Boldface) the twentieth century was the warmest in the last 1,000 years. 
Based upon previous reports→ (Logical connectives), IPCC → (Boldface) estimates that 
global average temperatures could increase by about 3ºF to 10ºF by 2100.  
Increases in Precipitation→ (Heading & Boldface)  
Increasing temperatures of air and sea surface due to global warming tends to 
increase evaporation, with the increase in evaporation then leading to increases in 
precipitation. The US has experienced an increase in precipitation as well. The US 
average precipitation in 2005 was 29.7 inches, well above the long-term (1895–2005) 
mean of 29.1 inches. Specifically, December 2004 through February 2005 was very wet 
from the California coast through the Plains and into the Great Lakes and Northeast. 
There also was much-above-normal precipitation around the west Coast. Six northeastern 

145 
 
states, such as Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire, reported their wettest fall on record. 
In addition, Mt. Washington set a record for the greatest October snowfall (78.7 inches), 
exceeding the previous record set back in 2000 by 40.2 inches.  
Likewise, → (Logical connectives) increases in precipitation can be observed 
globally. The research group at University College London→ (Boldface) has recorded 
precipitation over land, with their data showing that precipitation has increased by about 
2 percent globally since 1900.  
Increases in Strength of Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes and Typhoons)→(Heading & 
Boldface)   
The strength of tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons) also has been 
increasing. In 2004 and 2005, Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and a parade of storms affected 
the US. They devastated parts of Southern states such as Mississippi, Louisiana, and 
Texas. The apparent recent increase in hurricane intensity and duration measures in the 
Atlantic basin and several other basins has received considerable attention. Hurricane 
Katrina left Florida as a Category 1 hurricane but after a few days, Katrina transformed 
herself from a mild tropical storm into a dangerous Category 5 hurricane as she spun 
through the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Hurricane Katrina killed 1,836 people 
and left $80 billion in damage, making it the worst hurricane ever. 
Studies conducted by the University of Tokyo→ (Boldface) in Japan have shown 
that a combined measure of both the duration and intensity of tropical cyclones has 
doubled over the last 30 years. This trend corresponds to increases in average ocean 
surface temperature. Most of the strongest cyclones on record have occurred during the 
past 10 years just as ocean surface temperatures have reached record levels. Thus, → 

146 
 
(Logical connectives) the increases in ocean surface temperature seem likely to be 
responsible for the most severe cyclones on record. 
A number of researchers have presented evidence that global warming is a crucial 
factor that causes the increase in cyclones‘ intensity and duration. Professor James Elsner 
at Florida State University→ (Boldface), for example,→ (Logical connectives) found 
that average air temperatures during cyclone seasons between June and November predict 
sea surface temperatures, which are a vital component in nourishing cyclone winds, but 
not vice-versa. His analysis provides verification of a link between atmospheric warming 
and the recent upswing in frequency and intensity of cyclones. According to his analysis, 
future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) are likely to become more intense with 
larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases 
of tropical sea surface temperatures.  
Rises in Sea Level → (Heading & Boldface)    
Globally, a significant amount of sea level rise has been observed and that likely 
has resulted from the observed warming of the atmosphere and the oceans. Rises in sea 
level has been also observed in the US, with sea level rising about 0.1 inch per year along 
most of the US Atlantic and Gulf coasts.  This rise is part of the effects in which a 
warmer earth has globally influenced sea level.  
Sea level, as estimated by a research team at University of Amsterdam→ 
(Boldface) in the Netherlands using tide gauge measurements, has risen approximately 6-
8 inches worldwide during the last century. Furthermore, → (Logical connectives) this 
research team found that the expansion of ocean water, the melting of mountain glaciers, 

147 
 
and the melting of polar ice sheets are the primary factors driving the past century‘s sea 
level rise.   
Glacier National Park in Montana is a good example of the melting mountain 
glaciers. The glacier has been retreating rapidly since the early 1900's. At the current rate 
of melting, all glaciers will be gone at Glacier National Park by the middle of the next 
century. Mountain glaciers are one of the excellent sources that monitor climate change. 
The universal shrinkage of mountain glaciers is thought to be caused by a combination of 
increases in temperature and greenhouse-gas emissions. 
Greenhouse Gases and Greenhouse Effect → (Heading & Boldface)    
Most scientists believe that the primary reason for global warming are the so-
called ―greenhouse gases.‖ The most important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). They are mostly produced by human 
activities. A study conducted by a research team at University of Oxford→ (Boldface) in 
England verified this supposition. The study shows that human activities, for example, → 
(Logical connectives) burning coal, oil and gas, and cutting down forests are largely 
responsible for increasing greenhouse gases.  
The primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities in the US is carbon 
dioxide (CO2), which represents about 85 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been emitted mostly by the combustion of fossil fuels. 
According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), total US greenhouse gas 
emissions have risen by about 16 percent from 1990 to 2004. In 2004, they increased by 
about 2 percent from the previous year and it is expected that this trend will continue into 
the future. Due to continuous increases in greenhouse gas emissions, some states initiated 

148 
 
action on decreasing such emissions. On February 26, 2007, the Governors of Arizona, 
California, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington signed an agreement establishing the 
Western Climate Initiative 3 in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
Greenhouse gases play an important role in absorbing and emitting heat. 
Excessive greenhouse gases strengthen greenhouse effect, which refers to a global 
increase in temperatures as heat energy from sunlight is trapped. A stronger greenhouse 
effect will increase the rate of global warming. Thus, → (Logical connectives) it is 
expected that global warming will be accelerated as increases in greenhouse gas 
emissions strengthen greenhouse effect.  
Impacts on Wildlife→ (Heading, Boldface)    
Global warming is also a dangerous threat to the future of wildlife. The American 
eco-system is no exception. In the past 40 years, there has been an increase in catches of 
warm water fish and a decrease in the catches of cold water fish. As North American 
temperatures continue to rise, cold water fish such as trout are losing their current 
habitats. Trout habitat throughout the Rocky Mountain region may be reduced by 50 
percent or more by the end of the century. In contrast, warm water fish such as bass and 
tilapia, have begun to infiltrate to places like Monterey, California, which previously 
were dominated by colder water species.  
As shown in the example above, → (Logical connectives) plants and animals 
around the world are in real danger of falling victim because their habitats are changing 
too rapidly for them to keep up. According to plant and animal scientists at University of 
Laval→ (Boldface) in France, as many as one-third of all wildlife species in some parts 

149 
 
of the world could be headed toward extinction within the next 50 years due to global 
warming.  
Impacts on Human Health→ (Heading & Boldface)    
Extreme heat waves. → (Heading & Boldface) Climate change can directly 
affect human health by increasing the number of extreme heat waves. For example, → 
(Logical connectives) during the 1990s, Chicago experienced several severe heat waves. 
In July 1995, a heat wave resulted in 485 heat-related deaths and 739 excess deaths when 
the temperature was over 98ºF for 4 days. After consecutive heat events, Chicago 
implemented a Heat Health Watch/Warning System. The warning system was 
implemented in other US cities such as Cincinnati, New Orleans, and St. Louis.  
According to a study conducted by a research center at University of Chicago→ 
(Boldface), increases in temperature may lead to more extreme heat waves during 
summer. Heat waves are rare events that vary in character and impact, but they could 
become more frequent, intense, and long-lasting with global warming. 
Increases in waterborne disease. → (Heading & Boldface) Scholars from 
National University of Singapore→ (Boldface) pinpointed that global warming is likely 
to increase waterborne diseases. Some examples can be found in the US. A soaking rain 
in Milwaukee in 1993 caused a sewage release that resulted in the deaths of 54 people. In 
the summer of 2004, more than 1400 people reported gastrointestinal problems linked to 
several months of above-average rainfall on Ohio's South Bass Island in Lake Erie. These 
examples can be explained by deducing that global warming is likely to cause heavy 
rainfall, the heavy rainfall will trigger sewage overflows, and in turn, → (Logical 
connectives) contaminate drinking water.  

150 
 
Increases in ground-level ozone. → (Heading & Boldface) Global warming 
leads to more frequent high temperatures, which are likely to cause increases in ground-
level ozone. Several big cities in the US report the possible danger of increases in 
ground-level ozone. On the days when ozone levels are high, emergency room visits for 
asthma attacks in big cities, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have been 
shown to increase by as much as 36 percent. According to a research team in Korea‘s 
Seoul National University,→ (Boldface) ozone is a severe irritant that can cause 
choking, coughing, and stinging eyes. Moreover, → (Logical connectives) it damages 
lung tissue, aggravates respiratory disease, and makes people more susceptible to 
respiratory infections. In fact, → (Logical connectives) the increase in ground-level 
ozone is especially harmful for those with asthma and other chronic lung diseases.   
So far, the phenomena tied to global warming and examples from the US have 
been reviewed. In summary, → (Logical connectives) the strong causes of global 
warming are likely to be green house gases emitted by human activities. Global warming 
could influence so many areas surrounding human beings such as increases in 
temperature, precipitation, strength of tropical cyclones, and rises in sea level. Also, it is 
expected that a wide range of impacts on wildlife and human health such as extreme heat 
waves, increases in waterborne disease and ground-level ozone. → (Summary) Many 
threatening examples of global warming‘s effects have been observed already in the US. 
This means that urgent measures are needed to prevent global warming or slacken the 
progress of global warming. Therefore, → (Logical connectives) now is the right time to 
concern about global warming for ourselves and future generations.

The Increases in Temperature → (Heading & Boldface)   
In Korea, the average temperature has been increased and the rate of change has 
accelerated since 1990. The five warmest years in history have occurred since 1995. 
During that period, temperatures have been above average across most of Korea with 
temperatures in Busan, Chunan and Gwangju much above normal for winter in 2004 and 
2005. Also, much-above-average temperatures were observed in Seoul, Guri, and Suwon 
during summer. A new record of five consecutive days at or above 34°C was observed in 
August 2005 in Daegue, Gyeongsangbuk-do. 
These phenomena show that Korea is not an exception of global warming. 
According to a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), → 
(Boldface) globally, our planet has warmed about 1.3 ºF in the twentieth century. 
Moreover, → (Logical connectives) according to research at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, → (Boldface) the twentieth century was the warmest in the last 1,000 
years. Based upon previous reports, → (Logical connectives) IPCC → (Boldface) 
estimates that global average temperatures could increase by about 2ºC to 6ºC by 2100.  
Increases in Precipitation→ (Heading, Bold)   
Increasing temperatures of air and sea surface due to global warming tends to 
increase evaporation, with the increase in evaporation then leading to increases in 
precipitation. Korea has experienced an increase in precipitation. The average 
precipitation in 2005 was 1464.8 mm, well above the long-term (1971–2000) mean of 
1440.2 mm. Specifically, June 2005 through August 2005 was very wet from Taeback 
province through Joongbu and into Youngdong province. There also was much-above-
normal precipitation around Daegwallyeong and Gangneung city. Six cities in 

153 
 
Youngdong province, such as Gangneung, Donghae, and Chuncheon, reported their 
wettest summer on record. In addition, Youngdong providence set a record for the the 
heaviest rainfalls per hour of 100.5 mm, exceeding the previous record set back in 2000 
by 20.8 mm. 
Likewise, → (Logical connectives) increases in precipitation can be observed 
globally. The research group at University College London→ (Boldface) has recorded 
precipitation over land, with their data showing that precipitation has increased by about 
2 percent globally since 1900.  
Increases in Strength of Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes and Typhoons)→(Heading & 
Boldface)   
The strength of tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) also has been 
increasing. In 2002 and 2003, Typhoons Maemi, Rusa and a parade of typhoons affected 
Korean Peninsula. They devastated parts of southern regions such as Gyeongsangbuk-Do, 
Gyeongsangnam-Do and Jeju-Do. The apparent recent increase in some typhoon intensity 
and duration measures in East Sea and South Sea of Korea has received considerable 
attention. Typhoon Maemi was a powerful supertyphoon that struck South Korea. At first, 
it was a Category 4 typhoon with the speed of 130 km per hour winds. After reaching a 
Category 5, the peak of winds became 150 km per hour. Maemi killed 115 people and left 
￦ 5 Cho in damage, making it the worst typhoon ever.  
Studies conducted by the University of Tokyo→ (Boldface) in Japan have shown 
that a combined measure of both the duration and intensity of tropical cyclones has 
doubled over the last 30 years. This trend corresponds to increases in average ocean 
surface temperature. Most of the strongest cyclones on record have occurred during the 

154 
 
past 10 years just as ocean surface temperatures have reached record levels. Thus, → 
(Logical connectives) the increases in ocean surface temperature seem likely to be 
responsible for the most severe cyclones on record. 
A number of researchers have presented evidence that global warming is a crucial 
factor that causes the increase in cyclones‘ intensity and duration. Professor James Elsner

and the recent upswing in frequency and intensity of cyclones. According to his analysis, 
future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) are likely to become more intense with 
larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation associated with ongoing increases 
of tropical sea surface temperatures.  
Rises in Sea Level → (Heading & Boldface)    
Globally, a significant amount of sea level rise has been observed and that likely 
has resulted from the observed warming of the atmosphere and the oceans. Rises in sea 
level has been also observed in Korea, with sea level rising about 5.7mm per year, which 
is much larger than the global rate. This rise is part of the effects in which a warmer earth 
has globally influenced sea level.                  
Sea level, as estimated by a research team at University of Amsterdam→ 
(Boldface) in the Netherlands using tide gauge measurements, has risen approximately 
15-20 centimeters worldwide during the last century. Furthermore, → (Logical 
connectives) this research team found that the expansion of ocean water, the melting of 

155 
 
mountain glaciers, and the melting of polar ice sheets are the primary factors driving the 
past century‘s sea level rise.   
Baekdu Mountain in Hamkyungdo is a good example of the melting mountain 
glaciers. The glacier has been retreating rapidly since the early 1900's. At the current rate 
of melting, all glaciers will be gone from Chunjiyun in Baekdu National park by the 
middle of the next century. Mountain glaciers are one of the excellent sources that 
monitor climate change. The universal shrinkage of mountain glaciers is thought to be 
caused by a combination of increases in temperature and greenhouse-gas emissions.

(Logical connectives) burning coal, oil and gas, and cutting down forests are largely

The primary greenhouse gas emitted by human activities in Korea is carbon 
dioxide (CO2), which represents about 90 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been emitted mostly by the combustion of fossil fuels. 
According to Ministry Environment Republic of Korea, total Korea greenhouse gas 
emissions have risen by about 18 percent from 1990 to 2004. In 2004, it is increased by 
about 3 percent from the previous year and it is expected that this trend will continue into 
the future. Due to continuous increases in greenhouse gas emissions, several big Korean 

156 
 
cities initiated an action on decreasing such emissions. On July 10, 2008, the energy 
policy directors of Seoul, Busan, Gwangju, Incheon, and Daegu had a meeting regarding 
detailed methods and procedures in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
Greenhouse gases play an important role in absorbing and emitting heat. 
Excessive greenhouse gases strengthen greenhouse effect, which refers to a global 
increase in temperatures as heat energy from sunlight is trapped. A stronger greenhouse 
effect will increase the rate of global warming. Thus, → (Logical connectives) it is 
expected that global warming will be accelerated as increases in greenhouse gas 
emissions strengthen greenhouse effect.  
The Impacts on Wild Life→ (Heading & Boldface)    
Global warming is also a dangerous threat to the future of wildlife. The Korean 
eco-system is no exception. In the past 40 years, there has been an increase in catches of 
subtropical fish and a decrease in the catches of cold water fish. As Donghae (the East 
Sea) temperatures continue to rise, cold water fish such as cod are losing their current 
habitats. Cod habitat throughout North Donghae region may be reduced by 30 percent or 
more by the end of the century. However, subtropical fish such as squid and mackerel 
that were usually found around Jeju Island made their way up to the northeastern shores 
of Busan. 
 
As shown in the example above, → (Logical connectives) plants and animals 
around the world are in real danger of falling victim because their habitats are changing 
too rapidly for them to keep up. According to plant and animal scientists at University of 
Laval→ (Boldface) in France, as many as one-third of all wildlife species in some parts

Extreme heat waves. → (Heading & Boldface) Climate change can directly 
affect human health by increasing the number of extreme heat waves. For example, → 
(Logical connectives) during the 1990s, Seoul experienced several severe heat waves. In 
July 1994, a heat wave resulted in 254 heat-related deaths and 532 excess deaths when 
the temperature was over 38 ºC for 14 days. After consecutive heat events, Seoul 
implemented a Heat Health Watch/Warning System. The warning system was 
implemented in other Korean cities such as Busan, Chunan, and Gwanju.

National University,→ (Boldface) ozone is a severe irritant that can cause choking, 
coughing, and stinging eyes. Moreover, → (Logical connectives) it damages lung tissue, 
aggravates respiratory disease, and makes people more susceptible to respiratory 
infections. In fact, → (Logical connectives) the increase in ground-level ozone is 
especially harmful for those with asthma and other chronic lung diseases.   
So far, the phenomena tied to global warming and the examples from Korea have 
been reviewed. In summary, → (Logical connectives) the strong causes of global 
warming are likely to be green house gases emitted by human activities. Global warming 
could influence so many areas surrounding human beings such as increases in 
temperature, precipitation, strength of tropical cyclones, and rises in sea level. Also, it is 
expected that a wide range of impacts on wildlife and human health such as extreme heat 
waves, increases in waterborne disease and ground-level ozone. → (Summary) Many 
threatening examples of global waming‘s effects have been observed already in Korea. 
This means that urgent measures are needed to prevent global warming or slacken the 
progress of global warming. Therefore, → (Logical connectives) now is the right time to 
be concerned about global warming for ourselves and future generations.

Inference Making Questions 
 
Fact 26 
Professor James Elsner at Florida State University, for example, found that average 
air temperatures during cyclone seasons between June and November predict sea 
surface temperatures, which are a vital component in nourishing cyclone winds, but 
not vice-versa. His analysis provides verification of a link between atmospheric 
warming and the recent upswing in frequency and intensity of cyclones. According 
to his analysis, future tropical cyclones (typhoons and hurricanes) are likely to 
become more intense with larger peak wind speeds and more heavy precipitation 
associated with ongoing increases of tropical sea surface temperatures.  
 
26. X and Y are cities located on the shore of the ocean. During the last ten years, X city 
has experienced increases in the average atmospheric temperature whereas the average 
temperature of Y city has been steady or a little decreased. Which city do you think is 
likely to be exposed to stronger hurricanes? 
 
 
a. X  
b. Y  
c. Both X and Y  
d. Neither X and Y  

169 
 
Fact 27 
Increasing temperatures of air and sea surface due to global warming tends to 
increase evaporation, with the increase in evaporation then leading increases in 
precipitation. Mountain glaciers are one of the excellent sources that monitor 
climate change. The universal shrinkage of mountain glaciers is thought to be 
caused by a combination of a temperature increase and by increased greenhouse-gas 
emissions. 
 
27. X mountain national park famous for mountain glaciers has had a problem decreasing 
mountain glaciers. Which action is needed to slow down melting mountain glaciers? 
  
a. Prohibiting entering the mountain glacier areas  
b. Informing people the effects of greenhouse gases on mountain glaciers 
c. Educating tourists about the danger of forest fire 
d. None of above 
 
Fact 28 
The most important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) 
nitrous oxide (N2O). All are mostly produced by human activities. A study 
conducted by a research team at University of Oxford in England verified that. The 
study shows that human activities, for example, burning coal, oil and gas, and 
cutting down forests are largely responsible for increasing greenhouse gases.  
 
28. Which action is not helpful to slow down global warming?  
 
a. Encouraging carpooling 
b. Buying high efficiency appliances  
c. Recycling 
d. Cleaning up your environment  
 
Fact 29 
Global warming is also to be the most dangerous threat to the future of wildlife.  
Plant and Animal Scientists in University of Laval in  France recently concluded 
that within the next 50 years, as many as one-third of all wildlife species in some 
regions of the world could be headed toward extinction due to global warming. 
Plants and animals around the world are in real danger of falling victim because 
their habitat is changing too rapidly for them to keep up. 
 

170 
 
29. If you cannot catch cold water fish any more in an area where you caught them before, 
what could you do to still catch them? 
 
 
a. Go to the north to catch them 
b. Go to the south to catch them 
c. Going to areas that are not inhabited by human 
d. None of above 
 
Fact 30 
Climate change may directly affect human health through increases of the chance of 
extreme heat waves as well as increases in average temperature. According to 
research conducted by University of Chicago, temperature increases may lead to 
more extreme heat waves during the summer. Heat waves are rare events that vary 
in character and impact. However, they could become more frequent, intense and 
longer with climate change. Extreme heat increases humans’ body metabolism and 
temperature that uses up energy and magnify need for oxygen.  
According to the research team in Seoul National University in South Korea, global 
warming induced increases in the frequency of smog events and particular air 
pollution. Sunlight and high temperatures can cause ground-level ozone to increase. 
The increase of ground-level ozone is especially harmful for those with asthma and 
other chronic lung diseases. Ozone is a severe irritant that can cause choking, 
coughing and stinging eyes. It damages lung tissue, aggravates respiratory disease 
and makes people more susceptible to respiratory infections. 
 
 
30. Which one of the following is not increased when it is much hotter than normal? 
a. Number of visitors to ER  
b. Death rate  
c. Number of asthma attacks  
d. Number of new cases of diabetes
