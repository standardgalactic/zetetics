SUMMARY
The hippocampus is traditionally thought to transmit
contextual information to limbic structures where it
acquires valence. Using freely moving calcium imag-
ing and optogenetics, we show that while the dorsal
CA1 subregion of the hippocampus is enriched in
place cells, ventral CA1 (vCA1) is enriched in anxiety
cells that are activated by anxiogenic environments
and required for avoidance behavior. Imaging cells
deﬁned by their projection target revealed that anxi-
ety cells were enriched in the vCA1 population pro-
jecting to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) but
not to the basal amygdala (BA). Consistent with this
selectivity, optogenetic activation of vCA1 terminals
in LHA but not BA increased anxiety and avoidance,
while activation of terminals in BA but not LHA
impaired contextual fear memory. Thus, the hippo-
campus encodes not only neutral but also valence-
related contextual information, and the vCA1-LHA
pathway is a direct route by which the hippocampus
can rapidly inﬂuence innate anxiety behavior.
INTRODUCTION
Fear and anxiety are emotional responses to perceived threats,
with proximal threats eliciting fear and distal threats eliciting anx-
iety. Under normal conditions, anxiety states promote adaptive
avoidance behaviors that are critical to safely navigating an envi-
ronment. Execution of appropriate avoidance behaviors requires
the rapid recognition of threatening stimuli and routing that infor-
mation to structures that can directly modulate these defensive
behaviors.
While avoidance is adaptive under normal conditions, it can
become maladaptive when responses are excessive and inap-
propriate. In humans, a shared feature of a number of anxiety
disorders is the overestimation of threat, leading to enhanced
avoidance (Jovanovic and Ressler, 2010; Kheirbek et al.,
2012). Yet the mechanisms and neural circuits by which normal
adaptive avoidance behaviors arise, and how these circuits
become disordered in psychiatric illness, remain elusive.
While the hippocampus (HPC) is known to be critical for cogni-
tive processes such as episodic memory and spatial navigation,
it is also implicated in the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety dis-
orders. One way the HPC may contribute to both cognitive and
mood-related processes is via functional heterogeneity along
its dorsoventral axis, with the dorsal HPC contributing to cogni-
tive functions such as learning and memory and the ventral HPC
(vHPC) modulating emotional regulation (Fanselow and Dong,
2010; Strange et al., 2014). Lesions of the ventral but not dorsal
HPC are anxiolytic, with minimal effect on spatial learning (Ban-
nerman et al., 2002; Kjelstrup et al., 2002; Moser et al., 1995),
whereas dorsal HPC lesions affect spatial learning without
affecting anxiety-related measures. Moreover, place cells, which
are believed to contribute to a spatial representation of the envi-
ronment, are more abundant, stable, and tuned in dorsal HPC
relative to vHPC (Ciocchi et al., 2015; Jung et al., 1994; Keinath
et al., 2014; Royer et al., 2010). In addition, recent optogenetic
and pharmacological studies indicate that manipulation of the
vHPC itself or its inputs and cortical outputs can directly impact
anxiety-related behavior (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013; Kheirbek et al.,
2013; Kjaerby et al., 2016; Padilla-Coreano et al., 2016; Parﬁtt
et al., 2017; Samuels et al., 2015; Wu and Hen, 2014).

Despite accumulating evidence supporting a role for vHPC in
mood and anxiety-like behaviors, little is known about how the
vHPC represents emotionally salient information and how those
representations contribute to behavior. In the rodent model,
anxiety-related behavior can be assessed with conﬂict-based
avoidance tasks, which promote normal adaptive avoidance
behavior to distant threats (Calhoon and Tye, 2015). Therefore,
elucidating how innately anxiogenic contexts are represented
within the vHPC will be critical to understanding how it may guide
avoidance behaviors during conﬂict-based anxiety tasks.
Ventral CA1 (vCA1) sends dense projections to a number of
subcortical structures such as the basal amygdala (BA), hypo-
thalamus, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and bed nucleus of the
stria terminalis (BNST) (Canteras, 2002; Cenquizca and Swan-
son, 2006, 2007; Kishi et al., 2006; Tannenholz et al., 2014).
However, little is known about how vCA1 interacts with these
regions to orchestrate emotional behaviors. In particular, despite
decades of work demonstrating hippocampal-hypothalamic
interactions in the buffering of stress responses via indirect
inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Jacobson
and Sapolsky, 1991; Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009), the function
of the direct HPC-hypothalamic pathway in modulating behavior
remains unknown. vCA1 sends dense projections to the BA and
lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) directly, and recent optogenetic
studies have indicated that both the BA and LHA can control
anxiety-related behavior in real-time (Jennings et al., 2013; Tye
et al., 2011). However, how anxiety-related information is repre-
sented within vCA1 projection neurons to impact these output
structures remains unclear.
Here, we applied freely moving calcium imaging and optoge-
netics to investigate how anxiety-related information is repre-
sented within distinct populations of vCA1 projection neurons.
Intriguingly, we found ‘‘anxiety cells’’ enriched within a popu-
lation of vCA1-LHA projecting neurons that represent anxiogenic
environments and causally impact avoidance behavior. This re-
veals that the vCA1-LHA projection stream may serve as a direct
route for vCA1 to rapidly control anxiety-like behaviors.
RESULTS
Representations of Anxiety-Related Information in vCA1
We ﬁrst determined how vCA1 is engaged during exploration of
innately anxiogenic environments. We used microendoscopy to
perform calcium imaging of GCaMP6f-expressing vCA1 neurons
in freely moving mice. A gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens was
implanted over the vCA1 subregion (Figures 1A and S1A), and
the Ca2+ indicator GCaMP6f was virally expressed to visualize
vCA1 Ca2+ activity as previously described (Resendez et al.,
2016; Ziv et al., 2013). This approach allowed us to record
Ca2+ transient events in individual vCA1 neurons in the same
ﬁeld of view (FOV) while mice freely explored multiple environ-
ments (Figure 1A; see STAR Methods).
In the elevated plus maze (EPM), we found that a majority
of vCA1 neurons exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in Ca2+ activity
and rate of Ca2+ transients during exploration of the anxio-
genic open-arm compartment as compared to the closed-arm
compartment (Figures 1B, 1C, S1B, and S1D). We next
compared the average calcium activity across successive
behavioral entrances and exploration bouts of the open arms.
We found that vCA1 activity increases during exploration of
both open arms and decreases upon re-entry into the closed-
arm compartment (Figure 1D). This activity increase was not
driven merely by a change in spatial location, as switching
between closed-arm compartments did not elicit heightened ac-
tivity, while open-arm switching sustained heightened activity
(Figure 1D). Moreover, this was not due to differences in mouse
velocity between compartments, as open- and closed-arm ve-
locity distributions were similar across animals (Figure S1C).
We next considered whether vCA1 heightened open-arm activity
was related to an increase in spatial salience in the open arm
(relative to the closed arm), rather than its aversive nature. We
imaged vCA1 while mice explored a familiar open ﬁeld arena
which included a spatially salient novel object that elicited
approach (Figure 1E). Unlike our ﬁndings in the open arms of
the EPM, exploration of the quadrant containing the appetitive
novel object did not evoke increases in vCA1 activity (Figure 1F),
indicating that vCA1 neurons are biased to represent anxiogenic
features of the environment rather than changes in spatial
salience.
We next investigated whether the magnitude of open-arm-
evoked activity was correlated with the anxiety level of individual
animals. vCA1-open-arm-evoked activity (open-closed Ca2+
transient rate) was tightly correlated with the degree to which
mice avoided the open arms of the maze (a measure of baseline
anxiety levels) (Figure 1G), with more anxious animals exhibiting
higher levels of activity. Importantly, these effects on open- and
closed-arm Ca2+ rate differences were not an artifact of sparse
behavioral sampling, as calculating closed-arm Ca2+ event rates
from a matching number of behavioral samples resulted in the
same correlation between open-arm-evoked activity and avoid-
ance of the open arms (Figure S1F). Moreover, while the mean
open-arm Ca2+ event rate was positively correlated with avoid-
ance behavior, closed-arm rates were not correlated with
open-arm avoidance (Figures S1G and S1H). Finally, vCA1
open-arm activity was found to further increase when mice
engaged in highly anxiogenic head-dipping behaviors at the
edges of the open arms (Figures 1D, 1H, and S1E). These results
suggest that vCA1 generates representations of anxiogenic
stimuli via a rate code that is both correlated with baseline anx-
iety state and scales with the aversive nature of the behavior.
Real-Time Control of Avoidance Behavior by vCA1
We next tested whether vCA1-open-arm-evoked activity was
necessary for the maintenance of open-arm avoidance in the
EPM. Mice were bilaterally injected in vCA1 with either a control
virus or one expressing ArchT and implanted with ﬁber optics in
the same location (Figures 2A and S2C). This allowed us to
silence
vCA1-ArchT-expressing
pyramidal
neurons
with
532 nm light illumination (Figures S2A and S2B). We selectively
triggered optogenetic silencing of vCA1 activity only when
mice entered the open arms of the EPM (Figure 2B). When
compared to eYFP controls, vCA1-ArchT-silenced mice spent
signiﬁcantly more time exploring the open arms of the EPM (Fig-
ure 2B). This effect was also found in the open ﬁeld test (OFT), as
selectively silencing vCA1 neurons during exploration of the anx-
iogenic center zone signiﬁcantly increased the amount of time
Neuron 97, 670–683, February 7, 2018

mice spent exploring the center (Figures S2E and S2F). This was
not due to appetitive effects of light-induced inhibition of vCA1,
as Arch and eYFP mice spent a similar amount of time on the
side with light illumination in a real-time place preference assay
(RTPP) (Figure 2C). In addition, these effects were not due to
changes in locomotor activity or increases in the number of
open-arm visitations (Figures S2D and S2F). To assess whether
these changes in anxiety-related behavior were speciﬁc to
silencing open-arm-evoked activity or due to an inability of
mice to recognize where they were in the maze, we then tested
a second group of mice with laser stimulation only during
closed-arm exploration bouts (Figure 2B). In contrast to open-
arm silencing in the EPM, closed-arm silencing caused no
changes in anxiety behavior (Figure 2B). These data suggest
that vCA1 heightened activity in anxiogenic environments pro-
motes avoidance behavior.
Differential Representations of Anxiety-Related
Information across the Dorsoventral Axis of CA1
We next assessed the specialization and stability of anxiety-
related activity along the dorso-ventral axis of the hippocampus.
We imaged dCA1 neurons in the EPM in an identical fashion as
described above and compared activity to vCA1 imaged neurons
(Figures 3A and S4A). At the population level, we found that dCA1
neurons did not exhibit signiﬁcant changes in Ca2+ transient
event rate in the open arms of the EPM (Figure 3B) and dCA1 ac-
tivity did not correlate with the anxiety level of individual animals
(linear regression as in Figure 1H, R2 = 0.066). Using statistical

methods to classify neurons as signiﬁcantly more active in
selective compartments (see STAR Methods), we found that
51% of recorded vCA1 neurons were open-arm selective (Fig-
ures 3C and S4B), and this proportion was signiﬁcantly greater
relative to the dCA1 population which exhibited a more evenly
distributed selectivity preference (Figures 3C and S4B).
We next considered whether CA1-open-arm-selective neu-
rons in the EPM were specialized to respond to anxiogenic
stimuli in multiple contexts. Individual vCA1 and dCA1 neurons
were tracked across multiple imaging sessions, and the activity
of EPM-open-arm-selective neurons was assessed in the anxi-
ety-provoking OFT and the appetitive novel object task (Figures
3D and S3A–S3E). Interestingly, we found that vCA1-open-arm-
selective neurons exhibited a signiﬁcantly higher rate of Ca2+
transient events during exploration of the anxiogenic center
zone of the OFT compared to the periphery, but not during explo-
ration of a preferred novel object (Figure 3E).
Moreover, these effects were speciﬁc to vCA1-open-arm-
preferring neurons, as dCA1 open-arm neurons did not exhibit
changes in Ca2+ activity in the OFT center (Figure 3E). In an alter-
native unbiased approach, we deﬁned vCA1 and dCA1 task-se-
lective neurons in the EPM, OFT, and novel object task based on
their activity preference for the anxiogenic (open arms; center) or
appetitive (novel object zone) compartments and compared the
overlap of selective cells recruited across tasks (Figure S3F). We
found that the population of vCA1 neurons that were selective for
the EPM open arms were signiﬁcantly overlapping with neurons
that were selective for the OFT center, but not with neurons
selective to a novel object, indicating that vCA1-open-arm-se-
lective neurons are preferentially recruited in anxiogenic environ-
ments (Figure S3G). In contrast, dCA1 neurons that were selec-
tive for the EPM open arms did not overlap with dCA1 OFT
center-selective neurons above chance levels (Figure S3H), but
were preferentially recruited to an appetitive novel object. This
indicates that the dCA1 neurons that are selective for the open
arms are not selective for anxiogenic environments but may
rather be responsive to novelty. These results suggest the exis-
tence of cells that exhibit stable representations of anxiety-
related information or ‘‘anxiety cells’’ that are more abundant in
vCA1 than in dCA1.
As our viral targeting strategy could not distinguish between
vCA1 pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, we imaged
vCA1 inhibitory interneurons to determine whether anxiety cells
were overrepresented within this population. We virally ex-
pressed a Cre-dependent GCaMP6f in vGAT-Cre mice (Vong
et al., 2011) and imaged neural responses in the EPM (Figure 4A).
We found that overall, vCA1-vGAT neurons did not exhibit height-
ened activity in the open-arm compartment (Figure 4B), but rather
that themajority of vCA1-vGAT imaged neurons were closed-arm
preferring (Figure 4C). These results suggest that vCA1-open-
arm-preferring neurons are largely comprised of glutamatergic
pyramidal neurons, rather than inhibitory interneurons.
We then assessed whether vCA1 and dCA1 neurons might
also differentially represent spatial information. Mice were
imaged in the same FOV while exploring two contexts with
differing spatial cues (contexts A and B), followed by a second
exposure to context A (A-B-A), and rate maps of their ﬁring ﬁelds
within the contexts were generated as previously described

(B) Left, in the EPM, the laser was triggered-on when mice entered the open arm only, and open arm silencing signiﬁcantly increased percent time exploration of

3.465, p = 0.08, NeYFP = 9, NArch = 12).
(C) RTPP, laser was triggered-on when mice entered one side of the identical 2-chamber arena, and mice showed no preference for percent time exploration of
the stimulation side (ANOVA F(1,13) = 0.435, p = 0.52, NeYFP = 8, NArch = 7).

(Figures S4C and S4D; Leutgeb et al., 2007). We found that dCA1
neurons encoded more spatial information (Skaggs et al., 1996)
and had more stable place ﬁelds relative to vCA1, indicating that
dCA1 neurons are more spatially tuned than vCA1 (Figures
S4E–S4H). Taken together, these data suggest that dCA1 is en-
riched in place cells, while vCA1 is enriched in anxiety cells.
vCA1-Lateral Hypothalamus Projection Neurons Do Not
Signiﬁcantly Overlap with vCA1 Projections to the Basal
Amygdala or Medial Prefrontal Cortex
Given the heterogeneity of vCA1 responses in the EPM, we next
identiﬁed through which vCA1 subcortical output streams these
effects on anxiety-related behavior could be mediated. We
focused on two structures that receive some of the densest
vCA1 projections and are known to contribute to anxiety-related
behavior, learned fear, and stress responses: the basal amyg-
dala (BA) and lateral hypothalamus (LHA) (Canteras and Swan-
son, 1992; Cenquizca and Swanson, 2006; Kishi et al., 2006;
Tannenholz et al., 2014).
Injection of CaMKII-ChR2-eYFP virus into vCA1 revealed
dense terminal labeling in the BA (within the basomedial and ba-
solateral amygdala) and the LHA with similar intensities (Figures
5A and 5B). Acute slice recordings in BA or LHA neurons in
ChR2-eYFP-injected
mice
conﬁrmed
monosynaptic
input
from vCA1 to BA and LHA, as 473 nm laser stimulation within
BA or LHA subﬁelds was sufﬁcient to elicit glutamatergic, mono-
synaptic excitatory post synaptic currents (EPSCs) (Figures 5C
and 5D).

(B) dCA1 rate of Ca2+ transients in the EPM did not signiﬁcantly increase to the open-arm compartment (Wilcoxon signed rank Z = 1.451 p = 0.15,

(C) vCA1 is enriched in cells that are signiﬁcantly selective for the EPM open arm compared to shufﬂe (orange pie chart; see STAR Methods), relative to dCA1 (Chi
squared test of proportions X2(2) = 43.984, p < 0.0001 NdCA1 = 408, NvCA1 = 2,137).
(D) Analysis design. Top, imaging sessions from individual mice (imaged at a constant FOV) were concatenated into one large video prior to motion correction and
cell segmentation to allow for cross-session cell tracking in different tasks (video frame edge-color denotes different imaging sessions combined; EPM, orange;
OFT, purple; Novel Object task, green; see Figure S3 and STAR Methods). Bottom, EPM open arm selective cells were then deﬁned as in (C), and their Ca2+
transient rates were compared across other imaging sessions.
(E) The Ca2+ transient rates of EPM open arm selective cells in vCA1 (left) and dCA1 (right) were compared in the EPM, OFT, and Novel Object tasks. vCA1 open-
arm-selective cells were signiﬁcantly more active to the EPM open arm and OFT center zones compared to the safe closed arm and periphery compartments (left
two bar graphs) but did not change activity to exploration of a Novel Object (right bar graph) (vCA1 open arm cells: EPM open versus closed Wilcoxon signed rank

Ncells = 192). In contrast, dCA1 open-arm-selective cells did not exhibit any changes in Ca2+ transient rate in the OFT center and Novel Object task, indicating that
while vCA1 open arm neurons exhibit heightened activity across multiple tasks of innate anxiety, dCA1 open-arm-selective neurons are context speciﬁc (dCA1

We next determined whether different populations of vCA1
neurons project to LHA and BA, as recently seen with other out-
puts to the BLA, CeA, mPFC, lateral septum, and NAc (Cem-
browski et al., 2016; Jin and Maren, 2015; Kim and Cho, 2017;
Lee et al., 2014b; Okuyama et al., 2016; Parﬁtt et al., 2017; Xu
et al., 2016). Injection of the retrograde tracers cholera toxin sub-
unit B (CTB) CTB-555 and CTB-488 into the BA and LHA
revealed that these vCA1 projectors were largely non-overlap-
ping populations, as only 3% of labeled neurons sent dual pro-
jections (Figures 5E, white arrows, and 5F). Interestingly, we also
found that BA and LHA projecting neurons were segregated
anatomically and organized in a laminar fashion, with vCA1-
LHA neurons located deeper in the CA1 pyramidal layer relative
to vCA1-BA neurons (Figure 5G). We next assessed whether
vCA1-LHA projecting neurons send collaterals to the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a pathway that has recently been
described to modulate anxiety-related behavior (Padilla-Cor-
eano et al., 2016). We conducted similar retrograde tracing
studies as described above and injected CTB-555 into the
mPFC and CTB-488 into the LHA and found that similar to the
vCA1-BA pathways, vCA1-LHA projecting neurons were non-
overlapping with vCA1-mPFC projecting neurons (Figures S5A
and S5B). Taken together, these studies indicate that vCA1-
LHA projecting neurons arise from largely non-overlapping cell
populations relative to vCA1-BA and vCA1-mPFC projections
and occupy anatomically distinct layers within vCA1.
vCA1-Amygdala and vCA1-LHA Projections
Differentially Contribute to Anxiety-Related Behavior
and Contextual Fear Memories
Given the anatomical segregation of vCA1-BA and LHA projec-
tions, we next determined whether modulation of vCA1-BA
and vCA1-LHA projectors differentially contribute to behavior.
Mice were injected with ChR2-eYFP or a control eYFP virus
into vCA1, and ﬁber optics were implanted into either the amyg-
dala (targeting the basal nuclei) or LHA (Figures 6A, 6E, S5F, and
S5I). Mice were then tested for light effects in tests of anxiety-
related behavior and contextual fear conditioning (CFC).
In CFC, mice explored the conditioning context while receiving
laser stimulation, after which they received a brief foot shock. On
day two, mice were placed back into the same context in the
absence of laser stimulation to test for light effects on CFC
encoding. We found that vCA1-amygdala-ChR2 mice froze
signiﬁcantly less than controls, indicating that disrupting normal
activity patterns between vCA1 and amygdala was sufﬁcient to
disrupt encoding of contextual fear (Figure 6B). To determine
whether intact vCA1-BA activity patterns were required for
retrieval, a different cohort of mice were trained with light off
and tested for freezing on day two with the light on. vCA1-amyg-
dala-ChR2 mice froze less than controls, indicating that vCA1-
amygdala activity was required for both encoding and retrieval
of contextual fear memory (Figure 6B). These effects were reca-
pitulated with vCA1- amygdala terminal inhibition (Figures
S5C–S5E), indicating that the effects from ChR2 excitation
were likely due to a loss of function. Surprisingly, performing
the same manipulations in the vCA1-LHA pathway did not
impact either the encoding or retrieval of contextual fear, and
these negative effects were not frequency speciﬁc (Figures 6F
and S5L), indicating a selective role for vCA1-amygdala in
context encoding and retrieval.
We next tested the contribution of these vCA1 projections to
anxiety-related behavior. While silencing or stimulation of
vCA1-amygdala terminals had no effect on percent center dis-
tance in the OFT (Figures 6C, S5C, and S5G), stimulation

light-off epoch (Figure 5G). In addition, in an RTPP assay, while
stimulation did not produce an effect in vCA1-amygdala-ChR2
mice (Figures 6D and S5H), stimulation in vCA1-LHA-ChR2
mice elicited avoidance, as vCA1-LHA-ChR2-expressing mice
spent signiﬁcantly less time in the stimulation chamber relative
to controls (Figure 6H). Importantly, light effects in vCA1-LHA-
ChR2 mice were not due to changes in locomotor activity (Fig-
ures S5J and S5K). These studies indicate that modulation of
vCA1-LHA but not vCA1-amygdala projection neurons can
impact anxiety-related behaviors and elicit avoidance.
These results support a functional dissociation between
vCA1-amygdala and vCA1-LHA neurons, with vCA1-BA projec-
tions modulating contextual fear memory encoding and retrieval
and vCA1-LHA neurons driving anxiety-related behavior and
aversion.
The vCA1-LHA Projection Is Enriched in Anxiety Cells
We next investigated whether this functional dissociation was
already present at the level of vCA1. A retrograde canine adeno
type 2-Cre virus (CAV2-Cre) was injected either into the BA or
LHA subﬁeld, and a Cre-dependent GCaMP6f virus was injected
into vCA1. A GRIN lens was then implanted over the vCA1 re-
gion, and projection-speciﬁc Ca2+ activity was imaged during
identical behavioral conditions as described above (Figures 7A
and 7C). Utilizing this approach, vCA1-GCaMP6f terminals
were visualized selectively in BA or LHA subﬁelds, but not in
both, conﬁrming projection-speciﬁc expression of the Ca2+ indi-
cator (Figure 7B).
Imaging activity in the EPM in the two populations revealed
that while both vCA1-BA and vCA1-LHA neurons exhibited
increased activity in the open arms (Figure S6A), the magnitude
of the difference between open-arm and closed-arm activity was
greater in vCA1-LHA neurons relative to vCA1-BA projecting
neurons (Figure 7D). In addition, we found that vCA1-LHA neu-
rons were highly enriched in anxiety cells relative to vCA1-BA
neurons, with anxiety cells representing 79% of the vCA1-LHA
population (Figures 7E and S6B). Importantly, the groups did
not signiﬁcantly differ in percent open-arm time and Ca2+ activity
in the EPM closed-arm compartment did not differ between pro-
jection type (Figure S6A).
We next analyzed the spatial tuning structure and spatial infor-
mation of the projecting populations as previously described and
found no signiﬁcant differences between vCA1-BA and vCA1-
LHA projection populations (Figures S6C–S6G). These studies
suggest that while vCA1-LHA projecting neurons are enriched
in anxiety-related activity responses relative to vCA1-BA projec-
tors, both projection streams encode low levels of spatial
information.
Considering the enrichment of anxiety cells within the vCA1-
LHA pathway, we next assessed whether activity in these neu-
rons was necessary for avoidance behavior as previously tested
in our whole-population manipulations. We injected CAV2-Cre
into the LHA and a Cre-dependent ArchT or control virus into
vCA1 and implanted ﬁber optics into vCA1 (Figures 7F and
S6H). We tested mice in the EPM, and selectively triggered laser
stimulation when mice entered the open-arm compartment to
silence vCA1-LHA anxiety cell activity. We found that silencing
vCA1-LHA neurons during open-arm exploration signiﬁcantly
reduced avoidance of the open arms, recapitulating the effects
we found in our whole-population manipulation (Figure 7G).
These results support the hypothesis that negative valence
information is represented at the level of vCA1, is enriched in
neurons projecting to the LHA, and is necessary for avoidance
behavior (Figure S7).
DISCUSSION
A Representation of Anxiogenic Contexts in vCA1
The HPC integrates diverse sensory information from the ento-
rhinal cortex (EC) to generate complex representations of the
environment (Canto et al., 2008), which can become paired
with aversive stimuli to support contextual fear conditioning
(Kim and Fanselow, 1992; Phillips and LeDoux, 1992). In contrast
to this purely cognitive view of the HPC, our vCA1 imaging
studies indicate that vHPC neurons carry a representation of
innately anxiogenic stimuli. We ﬁnd that vCA1 is enriched in
anxiety cells that respond to the open-arm compartment of the
EPM. Moreover, these neurons are preferentially recruited by
other anxiogenic environments, such as the center of the OFT,
but not by an appetitive novel object. Further, our closed-loop
optogenetic silencing experiments demonstrate that this in-
crease in vCA1 activity in anxiogenic contexts is necessary for
the expression of avoidance behavior. Interestingly, we found
that vCA1 anxiety cells largely increase their activity after entry
into the anxiogenic open arms of the EPM, rather than during
the decision point to make that entry (a behavioral condition
that has recently been assessed in the vHPC-BLA-mPFC circuit
using local ﬁeld potentials [Jacinto et al., 2016]). Therefore, vCA1
may modulate anxiety behaviors by directly encoding threat-
ening stimuli through anxiety cells that are specialized to repre-
sent innately anxiogenic environments.
This anxiogenic representation may originate from within the
HPC circuit or may be provided by extra-hippocampal inputs.
One such input is the BLA, which projects directly to vCA3 and
vCA1, and whose inputs have recently been shown to impact
anxiety-related behaviors (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013). However,
this is complicated by single unit recordings, which have shown
that BA neurons are preferentially active in the safe closed-arm
compartment of the EPM, in contrast to vCA1 anxiety cells
(Adhikari et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2011). In addition, BLA neu-
rons projecting to vCA1 were found to respond to cues of both
positive and negative valence (Beyeler et al., 2016), rather than
biasing toward negative valence stimuli as in vCA1 anxiety cells.
Alternatively, this anxiogenic representation in vCA1 could
arise via EC inputs that are specialized to recognize speciﬁc
environmental features that contribute to anxiogenic contexts
(G) Left, CA1 deep and superﬁcial lamination. Right, cumulative distribution of vCA1-BA (red line) or vCA1-LHA (green line) labeled neuron distances from the

organized deeper in the CA1 pyramidal layer (KS test, p < 0.0001, KS stat = 0.2999).

such as color change, differences in lighting, elevation, and lack
of walls (Diehl et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2013). Innate valence repre-
sentations could thereby arise via selective routing of these fea-
tures to projection-deﬁned vCA1 populations that modulate
avoidance behavior. Thus, future studies recording and control-
ling input regions will determine the relative contribution of the
EC, BLA, and upstream CA3 and dentate gyrus circuits in the
generation of the anxiogenic signal in vCA1.
Divergent vCA1 Projection Streams
It has recently become appreciated that the vCA1 sends parallel
and largely non-overlapping projections to the mPFC, lateral
septum, NAc, BLA, and central amygdala (Ce) (Cembrowski
et al., 2016; Jin and Maren, 2015; Kim and Cho, 2017;
Lee et al., 2014b; Okuyama et al., 2016; Parﬁtt et al., 2017;
Xu et al., 2016), and here we ﬁnd this segregation also within
the BA and LHA pathways. Interestingly, in contrast to the inter-
mingled vCA1 projections to the BA and Ce, we found that vCA1-
BA and vCA1-LHA projection neurons were organized in a
laminar fashion within CA1. Recent studies on CA1 lamination
have demonstrated that pyramidal neurons in the deep and su-
perﬁcial layers of CA1 differ in their physiological properties,
local inhibitory inputs, and long-range inputs (Danielson et al.,
2016b; Lee et al., 2014b; Li et al., 2017; Masurkar et al., 2017).

Therefore, vCA1-BA and vCA1-LHA projecting neurons may
receive different inputs and exhibit different physiological prop-
erties, allowing for differential information routing between these
populations.
vCA1-LHA as a Direct Route to Control Avoidance
Behavior
Our studies revealed striking pathway-speciﬁc control of anxi-
ety-like behavior in vCA1, as activation of vCA1-LHA but not
vCA1-BA terminals generates avoidance behavior in anxiety
tasks.
Moreover,
our
projection-speciﬁc
imaging
studies
showed an enrichment of anxiety cells within the vCA1-LHA pro-
jections relative to vCA1-BA projections, with 80% of the
vCA1-LHA population carrying a representation for the open
arms of the EPM. The LHA may then integrate this representation
from vCA1 with those arising from other areas, such as the
BNST, which was found to carry a representation for the closed
arms of the EPM, and sends a direct projection to the LHA that
produces anxiolytic effects (Kim et al., 2013). Therefore, routing
of anxiety representations to the LHA may be critical for the gen-
eration of avoidance behaviors.
Although we targeted the LHA in our studies, vCA1 sends
direct projections to several subnuclei of the hypothalamus
(Canteras and Swanson, 1992; Cenquizca and Swanson,
2006), many of which contain diverse cell types and are anatom-
ically challenging to target selectively (Canteras, 2002). Elegant
studies have begun to dissect these diverse hypothalamic
circuits (Jennings et al., 2013, 2015; Kunwar et al., 2015; Lee
et al., 2014a; Lin et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2013), and future studies
investigating the hypothalamic cell types through which vCA1
and other inputs elicit effects on avoidance behaviors will be
critical to understanding how this structure modulates anxiety-
like behaviors.
Our studies reveal vCA1 projections to the LHA as a novel
pathway by which the vHPC may modulate anxiety-related
behavior. Recent studies indicate that vHPC-mPFC projection
neurons also represent anxiety-related information in the EPM
and that optogenetic inhibition of vHPC inputs to the mPFC
reduces open-arm avoidance (Ciocchi et al., 2015; Padilla-Cor-
eano et al., 2016). While glutamatergic cell populations in the
LHA may drive rapid avoidance and aversive behaviors directly
(Hakvoort Schwerdtfeger and Menard, 2008; Jennings et al.,
2013; Kim et al., 2013), the mPFC likely modulates anxiety-
related behaviors via outputs to the amygdala, hypothalamus,
thalamus, or periaqueductal gray (Do-Monte et al., 2015; Likhtik
et al., 2014; Radley et al., 2006; Sesack et al., 1989; Sotres-
Bayon and Quirk, 2010). One intriguing possibility is that the
contribution of vCA1-LHA and vCA1-mPFC pathways to anxi-
ety-related behavior is analogous to the thalamic ‘‘low road’’
and cortical ‘‘high road’’ in the control of amygdala-dependent
auditory fear conditioning (LeDoux, 1996, 2000). In this model,
differential routing of anxiogenic contextual representations
between vCA1 pathways could serve a similar function of sup-
porting both a rapid avoidance signal (via enrichment of anxio-
genic signals within direct vCA1-LHA projections) and a slower,
higher-order representation through cortical integration via the
vCA1-mPFC pathway.
vCA1-BA Projection Neurons Mediate Learned Fear, but
Not Innate Avoidance Behavior
One interesting aspect of our studies was that fewer anxiety cells
were observed in the vCA1-BA population compared to the
vCA1-LHA pathway, and manipulating projections from vCA1
to the BA had no impact on innate anxiety tasks, despite studies
demonstrating that the reverse pathway (BLA-vHPC) can drive
anxiety-like behaviors (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013). Rather, optoge-
netic manipulations of the vCA1-BA pathway in our study and
other recent work (Xu et al., 2016) demonstrate that this pathway
is
important
in
context-fear
associations.
Therefore,
this
pathway may be more specialized to encode learned context-
valence associations (rather than innately anxiogenic valence
representations), whereby contextual input from vCA1 to the
BA would become paired with aversive stimuli at the level of
BA. Moreover, activity in vCA1-BA anxiety cells may not be
sufﬁcient to drive avoidance behavior to innately anxiogenic con-
texts in the absence of a learned context-fear association.
Our studies raise the intriguing possibility that subpopulations
of vCA1 neurons are hardwired to respond to environments that
produce innate avoidance, while other populations may be hard-
wired to respond to environments that elicit approach (Figure S7).
This could be accomplished via selective routing of sensory in-
formation to vCA1 populations that can directly drive positive
or negative behavioral responses via their segregated limbic
target streams. While the vCA1-LHA projectors are enriched in
negative valence cells, the vCA1-NAc projectors may be en-
riched in positive valence cells (Britt et al., 2012; Ciocchi et al.,
2015; Okuyama et al., 2016). This model would be similar to
that described in the BLA, where distinct subpopulations of neu-
rons respond to positive or negative valence quality (Belova
et al., 2007; Gore et al., 2015; Namburi et al., 2015; Paton
et al., 2006; Uwano et al., 1995). If vCA1 were organized in a
similar fashion, we would predict that single vCA1 neurons would
respond to diverse types of sensory stimuli of the same valence
to drive analogous behavioral responses. One approach to test
this hypothesis will be to assess whether vCA1 anxiety cells
also respond to other innately aversive sensory stimuli, such as
aversive odors or painful stimuli. Importantly, in the current study
we utilized calcium imaging to probe the cellular responses to
behaviors that are executed on slow time scales (seconds),
which is compatible with the temporal limitations of calcium dy-
namics. Future, pathway-speciﬁc single-unit electrophysiolog-
ical recordings both in vHPC and in target regions may elucidate
the responses to more rapid anxiety-related behaviors, as well
as inform optical stimulation parameters that may recapitulate
(F) Experimental design, CAV2-Cre was injected into the LHA, and Cre-dependent ArchT-GFP was injected into vCA1 to selectivity express Arch in vCA1-LHA
projections bilaterally. Optogenetic ﬁbers were implanted at the vCA1 injection site.
(G) vCA1-LHA projections were silenced during EPM open-arm exploration bouts (laser turned on in open arm only), which signiﬁcantly decreased open arm
avoidance relative to eYFP controls (ANOVA mins 10–20; F(1,17) = 5.195, p < 0.05, NeYFP = 10, NArch = 9).

natural patterns of activity within this circuit and determine the
downstream effects of optical stimulation and inhibition.
Our ﬁndings provide novel insights into the representation of
innately aversive information in the vHPC and the role of
pathway-speciﬁc vCA1-subcortical projections in the generation
of anxiety-related behavior. The identiﬁcation of a novel vCA1-
LHA circuit that rapidly controls anxiety-related behavior,
without impacting learned fear, may provide novel targets for
the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders.

Viral Constructs
For optogenetic manipulations, adeno-associated viruses (AAV5-CaMKIIa-hChR2(H134R)- eYFP; AAV5-CaMKIIa-eYFP; AAV5-
CaMKII-ArchT-GFP; AAV5-CAG-Flex-ArchT-GFP) were packaged and supplied by the UNC Vector Core Facility at titers of
4-8 3 1012 vg/ml. For calcium imaging, viruses (AAV1-Syn-GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40; AAV1-Syn-Flex- GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40)
were packaged and supplied by UPenn Vector Core at titers 6 3 1012 vg/ml and viral aliquots were diluted prior to use with artiﬁcial
cortex buffer to 2 3 1012 vg/ml.
METHOD DETAILS
Stereotactic Surgeries
For all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane at an oxygen ﬂow rate of 1 L/min, and head-ﬁxed in a ste-
reotactic frame (David Kopf, Tujunga, CA). Eyes were lubricated with an ophthalmic ointment, and body temperature maintained at
37C with a T/pump warm water recirculator (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI). The fur was shaved and incision site sterilized prior to begin-
ning surgical procedures, and subcutaneous saline and carpofen were provided peri-operatively and for 2 days post-operatively to
prevent dehydration and for analgesia.
For in vivo Ca2+ imaging, mice underwent a single surgery in which 500nl of GCaMP6f virus was injected unilaterally with a Nanoject
syringe (Drummond Scientiﬁc, Broomall, PA) prior to implanting a GRIN lens over the injection site. GRIN lenses were implanted with
methods previously described (Resendez et al., 2016). Brieﬂy, a craniotomy centered at the lens implantation site was made, and
dura was removed from the brain surface and cleaned with a stream of sterile saline and absorptive spears (Fine Science Tools
(FST), Foster City, CA) prior to lowering the GRIN lens (no tissue was aspirated out of site). 3 skull screws (FST, Foster City, CA)
were inserted in evenly spaced locations around the implantation site, and the lens was slowly lowered in 0.1 mm DV steps and
then ﬁxed to the skull with dental cement (Dentsply Sinora, Philadelphia, PA). For vCA1 imaging, a 0.5 mm diameter, 6.1 mm
long GRIN lens was used, and for dCA1 a 1.0 mm diameter, 4 mm long GRIN lens was used (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA). Viral injection
coordinates were (in mm, from brain tissue at site): (vCA1: 3.16 AP, 3.25 ML, 3.85, 3.50, 3.25 DV; dCA1: 2.15 AP, 1.85 ML,
1.55, 1.65 DV) and lens coordinates were (in mm, from skull at craniotomy): (vCA1: 3.16 AP, 3.50 ML, 3.50 DV; dCA1:
2.15 AP, 1.30 ML, 1.30 DV). At the completion of surgery, the lens was protected with liquid mold rubber (Smooth-On, Lower
Macungie, PA), and imaging experiments commenced 3 weeks later.
For optogenetic surgeries, mice underwent a single surgery in which 500nl of opsin virus was injected into the vCA1 subregion with
a Nanoject syringe as described above, prior to implanting ﬁber optics at the target site. Fiber optics were made with procedures
previously published (Kheirbek et al., 2013), and were cut at 5mm in length for implantation. A single skull screw was implanted
to allow for better adherence of the dental cement to the skull surface. Virus was injected in vCA1 at the following coordinates for
all optogenetic manipulations (in mm): (3.16 AP, 3.30 ML, 3.85, 3.50, 3.00 DV from brain at craniotomy). vCA1 cell body
silencing was done with bilateral virus and ﬁber optic implantation at the following coordinates (in mm): (3.20 AP, 3.35 ML,
3.50 DV from brain at craniotomy). vCA1-BA terminal activation was done bilaterally with ﬁber optic implantation at (in mm, from
brain at craniotomy): (1.70 AP, 3.00 ML, 4.00 DV), and vCA1-LHA was done with unilateral virus and ﬁber optic implanted at:
(1.95 AP, 0.50 ML, 4.75 DV). vCA1-LHA-ArchT cell body silencing surgeries were done bilaterally with CAV2-Cre injection into
LHA at the above coordinates. For vCA1 cell body silencing, mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks prior to commencing behavior
experiments. For terminal activation, experiments began 8 weeks after surgery to allow for sufﬁcient viral expression and trafﬁcking of
opsin to axon terminals.
For CTB retrograde studies, 290nl of conjugated CTB (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) was injected unilaterally in the LHA and BA
subregions or LHA and mPFC in a single surgery at the following coordinates (in mm from brain tissue at site): (LH: 2.0 AP, 0.75 ML,
5.25, 5.0, 4.75 DV; BA: 1.70 AP, 3.0 ML, 4.25, 4.0 DV; mPFC: +1.90 AP, 0.3 ML, 2.75, 2.50 DV), and mice were perfused
7 days after injection for histology.
Patch-Clamp Electrophysiology
For vCA1-ChR2 terminal slice recordings, mice with vCA1 viral expression of the excitatory ChR2-eYFP opsin (at 8 weeks post viral
injection, to allow for trafﬁcking of opsin to axon terminals) were anesthetized by halothane or isoﬂurane inhalation, decapitated, and
brains rapidly removed. Coronal slices (350 mm) containing the BA and LHA were cut on a Leica VT1000S vibratome in ice cold partial
sucrose artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 80 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 4.5 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 1.25 H2PO4,
25 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, and 90 sucrose equilibrated with 95% O2 / 5% CO2 and stored in the same solution at 37C for 30 minutes,
then at room temperature until use. Recordings were made at 30-32C (TC324-B; Warner Instrument Corp) in ACSF (in mM:
124 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 25 NaHCO3, 20 glucose, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2). Fluorescent vCA1-ChR2-eYFP axon terminals were ﬁrst
located within the BA and LHA on an upright microscope Axioskop-2 FS (Zeiss). Cells surrounded by these axons were then visu-
alized via infrared-differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) optics and randomly selected for voltage-clamp recordings. A ce-
sium-based internal solution was used (in mM): 125 Cs-methanesulfonate, 4 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.3 Na2GTP,
10 Na-phosphocreatine, 5 QX 314-Cl). Patch pipettes were made from borosciliate glass (A-M Systems) using a micropipette puller
(Model P-1000; Sutter Instruments). In the bath, initial pipette resistance was 4.5-6.5 MU. Recordings were made without correction
for junction potentials. Current and voltage signals were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B ampliﬁer (Molecular Devices, USA),
Neuron 97, 670–683.e1–e6, February 7, 2018
e2

digitized at 5–10 kHz, and ﬁltered at 2.5– 4 kHz. Data were acquired and analyzed using Axograph (Axograph Scientiﬁc, Sydney,
Australia).
For optical stimulation, 473 nm light pulses were generated using a 100 mW DPSS laser (Opto Engine LLC, Midvale, UT) and deliv-
ered through a 40X objective. Single light pulses (1 ms duration) delivered every 20 s were used to activate vCA1 ﬁbers in the BA and
LHA while recording light-evoked monosynaptic EPSCs in randomly chosen neurons.
For vCA1-ArchT cell body slice recordings, mice with ArchT expression (4 weeks post viral injection) were anesthetized and
perfused with modiﬁed sucrose ACSF containing (in mM) 75 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 3.3 MgSO4, 0.5 CaCl2, 1NaH2PO4, 26.2 NaHCO3,
22 glucose, 52.6 sucrose, 10 HEPES, 10 choline chloride, 1 pyruvate, 1 L-ascorbic acid (300 mOsml, pH 7.4). The brain was
dissected and 300 mm-thick slices were cut and placed in an interface chamber containing the same modiﬁed sucrose solution.
Slices were incubated at 32C for 30 min, then held at room temperature (23C) in the interface chamber for at least 1 h. Recordings
were made at room temperature and perfused with oxygenated ACSF containing (in mM) 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl,1.3 MgCl2, 2.5 CaCl2,
1.3 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 20 glucose (300 mOsml) at 23C.
Recordings were made at room temperature using pulled patch pipettes (5-7 MU) ﬁlled with internal solution containing (in mM) 150
K-Gluconate, 1.5 MgCl2, 5.0 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 10 phosphocreatine, 2.0 ATP, and 0.3 GTP. Green light was supplied via an arc lamp
passed through a TRITC excitation ﬁlter, and delivered through a 40x objective centered on the soma of the patched cell. Patch-
clamp recordings were obtained using Multiclamp 700B patch ampliﬁers, digitized using a Digidata 1322a, and data collected using
pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices).
Behavioral Assays
Elevated Plus Maze. Mice were placed in a standard EPM sized maze (13.5’’ height of maze from ﬂoor, 25’’ full length of each arm-
type, 2’’ arm width, 7’’ tall closed arms, with 0.5’’ tall/wide ledges on the open arms), with 650 light lux centered over the open arms
to promote avoidance. Mice were placed in the center region of the maze, and were allowed to explore for 10 minutes while recording
behavior with a webcam EthoVision XT 10 (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) or a digital camera (Carl Zeiss), and analyzed with EthoVision
software or TopScan tracking software (Clever Sys, Reston, VA). Headdip behaviors in the EPM were hand-scored with Observer
XT software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA). For ArchT-GFP silencing experiments, mice were run for 20 minutes in the EPM to allow for
a sufﬁcient number of open arm entries/ laser triggering events.
Novel Object Task. Mice were placed in a familiar arena (22 3 16 3 6’’ length-width-height) which they were allowed to explore for
20 minutes on the previous day, in low light lux condition (50 lux). Behavior during the initial exposure to the arena was recorded and
tracked with EthoVision XT 10 software, and 4 corner zones of equal size were drawn to determine the relative baseline preference for
each location (6 3 5.5’’ length-width). During the novel object session, a novel object that elicited approach (a funnel taped down
with colored tape) was placed into the least preferred corner zone of the arena (from day 1 tracking). Mice were allowed to explore the
familiar arena for 10 minutes and behavior was recorded with EthoVision XT 10 software and webcam.
Open Field Test. Mice were placed in an arena (18 3 18 3 12’’ length-width-height; Kinder Scientiﬁc, Poway, CA) with bright light
(650 lux) centered over the center zone, and allowed to explore for 10 minutes while behavior was recorded and analyzed with
MotorMonitor software.
Context Exploration Task for Place Field Analysis. For place ﬁeld analysis, mice were allowed to explore a novel arena (Context A-
Context B- and Context A) (9.5 3 18’’ length-width) for 10 minutes each in low light lux conditions, with a 10 minute rest in a transfer
cage in between sessions. Context A was a plain arena with short walls (6’’ height) while Context B was generated by placing
standard mouse bedding, and tall, rounded yellow walls (10’’ height) within the same arena as Context A. The arena was kept in
the same location for all 3 imaging sessions, and behavior was recorded and tracked with EthoVision XT 10 software.
Real-Time Place Preference. Mice were placed in an identical 2-chamber arena (18.5 3 10 3 8’’ length-width-height) with standard
mouse bedding and low light lux, and allowed to freely explore both chambers for 20 minutes while behavior was recorded with
EthoVision XT 10 software.
Contextual Fear Conditioning. Mice were run through a 2-day contextual fear conditioning paradigm. On day 1, mice were placed in
a standard fear conditioning shock box (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA) with the following contextual cues: (anise scent, white
noise, and a light on within the chamber), and were allowed to explore the context for 3 minutes prior to receiving a 2 s 0.7mA strength
foot shock. On day 2, mice were placed back into the same context for 3 minutes to assess for freezing during CFC retrieval. For
vCA1-LHA terminal modulation, at the end of day 2 retrieval, mice were given an additional 2 s foot shock to re-train them for day
3 retrieval testing. Behavior was recording with FreezeFrame video software (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA), and freezing
was hand-scored by a blinded experimenter using Stopwatch scoring software (Center for Behavioral Neuroscience).
Freely Moving Ca2+ imaging
3 weeks after surgery, mice were checked for GCaMP expression with a miniaturized microscope (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA) and
procedures previously described (Resendez et al., 2016). Mice were brieﬂy anesthetized with 1.5% isoﬂurane at 1 L/min oxygen
ﬂow, and head- ﬁxed into a stereotactic frame. The protective rubber mold was removed from the lens, and a magnetic baseplate
was attached to a microscope and lowered over the implanted GRIN lens to assess the FOV for GCaMP+ neurons. If GCaMP+
neurons were visible, the baseplate was dental cemented in place onto the mouse headcap to allow for re-imaging of the same
FOV for several weeks. Once baseplated, the same microscope was used for every imaging session with that mouse, and the focal
e3

plane on the hardware of the miniscope was not altered throughout the imaging experiments to ensure a constant FOV across
sessions. Awake- behaving imaging sessions were commenced the day after baseplating, and mice were brieﬂy anesthetized
(< 5mins) in order to attach the miniscope to the baseplate each imaging session day. Mice were allowed to recover from anesthesia
for 30 minutes before beginning imaging.
Ca2+ videos were recorded with nVista acquisition software (Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA), and triggered with a TTL pulse from
EthoVision XT 10 and Noldus IO box system to allow for simultaneous acquisition of Ca2+ and behavioral videos. Ca2+ videos
were acquired at 15 frames per second with 66.56 ms exposure. An optimal LED power was selected for each mouse based on
GCaMP expression in the FOV (pixel values), and the same LED settings were used for each mouse throughout the series of imaging
sessions.
Optogenetic Manipulations
Mice were handled and habituated to ﬁber optic adaptor cables for 3 days prior to commencing behavioral experiments. For
ArchT-GFP silencing experiments, 10mW of constant light were delivered via a 523nm 100mW laser (Opto Engine, Midvale, UT;
a 594 nm laser was used in vCA1-BA Arch silencing experiments) to ﬁber optics implanted in mouse brain using a ﬁber optic patch
cable as previously described (Kheirbek et al., 2013). For ChR2-eYFP experiments, 5-8mW of 5ms 10hz or 20hz light pulses were
delivered via a 473nm 100mW laser (Opto Engine, Midvale, UT), and light delivery protocol was controlled via a Master-8 stimulator
(AMPI, Jerusalem, Israel). For closed-loop ArchT-GFP silencing experiments, EthoVision XT 10 software and Noldus IO box system
were used to record live- tracking of mice while they explored the EPM, OFT, and RTPP tasks. The laser was triggered- ON when mice
were live-tracked in EthoVision in a pre-drawn stimulation zone (open arms for EPM, center for OFT, and a randomly selected cham-
ber for RTPP). For ChR2-eYFP experiments, OFT optogenetic manipulations were ran in 3 minute laser epochs (light on-off-on). RTPP
was ran as described above. In CFC, on light-ON days, light was delivered for the entire session (including through the end of the foot
shock on day 1 light-ON cohorts).
Histology and Confocal and Epiﬂuorescent Microscopy
For all histology, mice were perfused transcardially with 4% (weight/volume) paraformaldehyde in 1X phosphate buffer solution (PBS)
and brains were then removed and post-ﬁxed in 4% PFA for 24 hours, after-which they were transferred to a 30% sucrose solution in
PBS for 2 days. Sucrose-saturated brains were then ﬂash-frozen and sliced in 50um thick coronal sections on a cryostat (Leica CM
3050S). Sections were incubated with 1:1000 Hoechst in 1x PBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 10 minutes to label cell nuclei, and
mounted and coverslipped with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Endogenous viral expression of ﬂuoro-
phores was used in all histology preparations (no immunolabeling was required to visualize ﬂuorophores). Histology slides were
imaged on a (Leica TCS SP8) confocal microscope using a 10x or 20x objective, or a (Zeiss Axiovert 200) epiﬂuorescent microscope
using a 2.5x or 10x objective.
Appropriate GRIN lens and ﬁber optic placements were determined by post-ﬁxing brains with head-caps and skulls intact for
1 week in 4% PFA to improve the clarity of the GRIN lens and ﬁber optic tracts. Brains were then placed into 30% sucrose solution
as described above, and slices were collected in individual culture wells to maintain the accurate AP order of sections for ﬁber optic/
lens placement reconstructions. Sections were then mounted in AP order, and the bottom location of ﬁber optic tips and GRIN lenses
were visually determined for each mouse by inspecting sections on an epiﬂuorescent microscope.
For CTB retrograde studies, tiled images were captured on a confocal microscope with a 10x objective, and red, green, and yellow
cells were counted with an ImageJ Cell Counter toolbox. Lamination of CTB labeled neurons was determined by measuring the
distance of counted cells to the Pyr/Rad border in ImageJ.
For anterograde terminal ﬂuorescence measurements, the vCA1 terminal ﬁelds in the BA and LHA were visualized in the same AP
location (1.70 mm) in vCA1-ChR2-eYFP expressing mice (8 weeks post-viral injection to allow for sufﬁcient trafﬁcking of opsin to
axon terminals). The BA and LHA subﬁelds were then imaged in the same section with identical exposure times using a 2.5x objective
on an upright epiﬂuorescent microscope. This allowed us to control for differences in baseline background ﬂuorescence between
sections, as BA and LHA terminal images were taken from the same sections, and ﬂuorescence levels compared in a pairwise
fashion. ROIs of the BA and LHA were hand-drawn in ImageJ, and the mean ﬂuorescence value was used for comparisons.
Image Processing
For whole-population (Synapsin promoter) imaging, image processing was performed using Mosaic software (version 1.0.5b;
Inscopix, Palo Alto, CA). Videos were spatially downsampled by a binning factor of 4 (16x), and lateral brain movement was motion
corrected using the registration engine Turboreg (Ghosh et al., 2011; Ziv et al., 2013) which utilizes a single reference frame and high-
contrast features in the image to shift frames with motion to matching XY positions throughout the video. Black borders from XY
translation in motion correction were cropped, and changes in ﬂuorescence were detected by generating a DF/Fo video using a min-
imum z-projection image of the entire movie as the reference Fo to normalize ﬂuorescence signals to the minimum ﬂuorescence of
pixels within the frame. Videos were then temporally downsampled by a binning factor of 3 (down to 5 frames per second). Putative
single cells and Ca2+ signals were isolated with an automated cell-segmentation algorithm that employs independent and principal
component analyses on DF/Fo videos (Mukamel et al., 2009). Identiﬁed putative cells were then sorted via visual inspection to select
for units with the appropriate spatial conﬁguration and Ca2+ dynamics consistent with signals from individual neurons. Ca2+ transient

events were then deﬁned by a Ca2+ event detection algorithm which identiﬁes large amplitude peaks with fast rise times and expo-
nential decays (parameters: tau = 200ms, Ca2+ transient event minimum size = 6 median average deviation).
For projection-speciﬁc imaging, videos were spatially binned, motion corrected and cropped using Mosaic software in an identical
fashion as described above, however cell segmentation was performed using an improved automated algorithm optimized for micro-
endoscopic Ca2+ imaging- Constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization for microEndoscopic data (CNMF-E) (Zhou et al., 2016).
CNMF-E builds on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework (Pnevmatikakis et al., 2016), and is capable of
achieving simultaneous denoising, deconvolution, and demixing of this imaging data. At a technical level, it utilizes a novel model to
efﬁciently estimate and subtract the large background signals present in the data (details of the method can be found in (Zhou et al.,
2016)). Motion corrected and cropped videos were ran through the CNMF-E algorithm with an estimated cell diameter of 18 pixels
(measured on visible cells in imageJ). Putative neurons were identiﬁed, and sorted by visible inspection for appropriate spatial conﬁg-
uration and Ca2+ dynamics as described above, and putative units were manually merged or split if the spatial conﬁguration did not
match regions of interests (ROI) manually drawn in ImageJ ROI manager from visual inspection of a DF/Fo version of the video. In the
paper, we report the non-denoised temporal traces extracted by CNMF-E as neurons’ temporal activity. These traces were z-scaled
with an estimated Gaussian noise level, corresponding to a scaled version of DF/Fo of each neuron. Ca2+ transient events were then
deﬁned with an event detection algorithm similar to that described above. Transients were Z-scored with the mean calculated from
time points lacking Ca2+ activity (deﬁned as time points with ﬂuorescence values less than the 0.50 quantile of all ﬂuorescence values
from all cells in the FOV). Ca2+ events were then deﬁned as transients exceeding a 2 s.d. amplitude from a 0.5 s.d. baseline, lasting a
minimum duration (calculated by [-ln(A/Ao)/t_half] where Ao = 0.5 and A = amplitude of that transient; t_half for GCaMP6f was 200ms,
taken from (Chen et al., 2013)) before returning to a 0.5 s.d. baseline level. Additional Ca2+ transient rising events within detected Ca2+
transients that were large and mult-peaked were then detected using the ﬁndpeaks function in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA)
with the following parameters (MinPeakProminence = 1.5 s.d., MinPeakDistance = 1 s). All detected Ca2+ transients were visibly
inspected for each cell to verify accuracy. Area under the curve was calculated for identiﬁed transients from transient onset (at
time when transient exceeded 0.5 s.d. threshold) to offset (at time when transient amplitude returned to 0.5 s.d. baseline threshold).
For tracking cells across multiple imaging session days, videos from multiple sessions were concatenated into a single large video,
and motion correction was ran on the concatenated video from a single reference frame to ensure that XY translation from the
TurboReg motion correction algorithm adjusted all frames to the same location. Motion correction accuracy on the concatenated
video was then determined by visually tracking multiple cells in the FOV across imaging sessions to ensure that cells did not shift
their spatial location (from a hand-drawn ROI in ImageJ ROI Manager) throughout the entire length of the video. The accuracy of
cell tracking and spatial stability across imaging days in the segmented concatenated video was then quantiﬁed in analysis described
in Figure S3A-E. Brieﬂy (expanding on the detailed description in the ﬁgure legend for S3A-E), the Ca2+ transient temporal correlation
threshold for identifying temporally matched pairs between concatenated video and single video cell segmentation groups was
selected by visual inspection of the overlaid Ca2+ transients between cell pairs with maximum correlation (each cell was assigned
a putative match to the cell in the second video with which its transient correlation value was maximal). This resulted in a bimodal
distribution of cell pair temporal correlations, with a split at Rho = 0.4 (all cell pairs with transients exceeding 0.4 correlation were
then considered a match).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical parameters for speciﬁc analyses are reported in the ﬁgure legends of the paper.
Ca2+ Data Analysis
Ca2+ transient events and mouse behavior were analyzed with custom MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) functions to calculate the
rate of Ca2+ transients per cell while mice explored different zones, and different XY spatial locations of the arena. Occupancy in
different arena zones were deﬁned in EthoVision software and exported as a logical output at 30 frames per second (xy location
of the mouse center-point was tracked in the Ethovision-deﬁned arena to categorize behavioral samples into speciﬁc arena zones).
For headdip behavior scoring, Observer XT software (Noldus, Leesburg, VA) was used to hand-score headdip events and then ex-
ported as a logical output similar to the zone behavior tracking described above (a hold-key scoring system was used to log the timing
of headdip events throughout the duration of the session). Behavior data was downsampled to 5 frames per second to match Ca2+
transient data sampling, and Ca2+ transient time bins were categorized into arena zones based on the time-matched Ethovision
behavior output to calculate the AUC and rate of Ca2+ transients in different behavioral conditions.
For plotting example raster Ca2+ heatmaps by distance of vCA1 activity in the EPM, the xy displacement of the mouse center-point
(from Ethovision tracking) from the EPM arena center- point was calculated from each behavioral time bin, and xy displacements
were categorized by arm-type, and binned by distance (0.5cm bins). The mean Ca2+ transient activity (from identiﬁed Ca2+ transients
only) within each behavioral xy displacement bin was then calculated and normalized for each cell individually. For Ca2+ heatmaps by
time, the mean Ca2+ transient activity across all cells in a FOV was calculated in 200ms time bins.
For deﬁning cell selectivity, Ca2+ events were shufﬂed in time for individual cells (1000 iterations), and shufﬂed rates were re-calcu-
lated based on behavior zone time bin categorization as described above (behavior time bins kept constant) to generate a null
distribution of zone Ca2+ event rates for each cell. A cell was considered selective for a zone if its Ca2+ event rate difference between
e5
Neuron 97, 670–683.e1–e6, February 7, 2018

zones (EPM: open-closed; OFT: center-periphery; Novel Object: Novel Object Zone- Neutral Zone) exceeded a 1SD threshold from
the null distribution (threshold was determined by comparing zone rates for ‘‘neutral cells’’ deﬁned at different thresholds, and the
threshold at which neutral cells showed no signiﬁcant Ca2+ transient rate different between zones was selected).
Place cell analysis
Place ﬁeld maps were drawn as previously described (Leutgeb et al., 2007) with a bin size of 5cm2, and a sigma smoothing factor
of 5, drawn from mobile time bins only (immobile time bins were deﬁned as velocities < 1cm/sec, for behavioral bouts > 1 s duration).
A minimum of 10 Ca2+ transient events in the session was required to be included in the analysis, and qualiﬁed place ﬁelds were
deﬁned as place ﬁelds with 9 contiguous bins containing 20% of the peak ﬁring rate. Spatial information content values were
calculated from the ﬁrst context-A exposure imaging session. Spatial information p values were calculated as previously described
(Danielson et al., 2016a) by generating a null distribution of spatial information content values per cell (shufﬂing the timing of Ca2+
events in time to generate null place ﬁeld maps,1000 iterations), and comparing the true spatial information content value to that
shufﬂed distribution. Place ﬁeld stability was determined by comparing the R value from place ﬁeld map correlations (Pearson’s
correlation). Only cells with qualiﬁed place ﬁelds in both conditions (A-A, or A-B) were included in this analysis.
Task-selectivity analysis
To deﬁne task-selective neurons, cells were deﬁned by their selectivity for the EPM open arm, OFT center zone, and Novel Object
zone as described above. Populations of selective cells were then compared. Overlap signiﬁcance was determined by randomly
sampling from a mock distribution of cells containing the true % of EPM open arm cells in the population (sampling N = total number
of OFT center of Novel Object cells, mock distribution N = total number of all cells included in the analysis, sampling at 10,000 iter-
ations), to generate an overlap distribution by random sampling. The true overlap p value was then calculated by comparing the true
overlap value to these distributions.
