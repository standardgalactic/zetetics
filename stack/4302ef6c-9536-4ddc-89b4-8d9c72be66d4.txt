1. Abstract 
 
1.1. Abstract (English) 
This doctoral thesis examines the puzzle of how best to study multiscale systems in the 
cognitive sciences; namely, systemic dynamics that span several spatial and temporal scales. 
The aim of this thesis is to articulate – and to work out the philosophical implications of – a 
first principle approach to multidisciplinary research in the cognitive sciences. The aim is to 
model the dynamics of cognitive systems at, and across, all the spatial and temporal scales at 
which they exist – from cells to societies, and everything in between. To achieve this aim, 
this thesis proposes three novel theoretical pillars: (1) variational neuroethology, a new 
approach to neuroethology – the study of adaptive behaviour and its control – based on a 
general account of the information-theoretic constraints on cognizing organisms, called the 
free-energy principle; (2) variational ecology, an approach to cognitive ecology that provides 
a more specific account of how hierarchically structured organisms – that construct their own 
ecological niches – align themselves with their niche; and (3) the cultural affordances 
framework, a still more specific account of how human action, cognition, learning, and 
culture are organized in environmental affordances and corresponding (cultural) regimes of 
attention. The thesis develops a philosophical argument, based on these frameworks, against 
essentialism about the boundaries of cognitive systems in the philosophy of the cognitive 
sciences (frameworks that privilege one type of boundary over others). The thesis argues that 
the boundaries of cognitive systems are multiple, nested, and interest-relative – and provides 
a promising resolution of the dialectic between internalism and externalism in the philosophy 
of the cognitive sciences.  
 
1.2. Abstract (French) 
Cette thèse cherche à résoudre une énigme, à savoir : quelle est la meilleure manière d’étudier 
les systèmes multi-échelles – les dynamiques systémiques qui s’étendent sur plusieurs 
échelles spatiales et temporelles. L’objectif de cette thèse est d’articuler une approche 
multidisciplinaire pour les sciences cognitives qui puisse se fonder sur des principes premiers 
– et d’en distiller les conséquences philosophiques. L’objectif est de permettre la 
modélisation des dynamiques des systèmes cognitifs à (et à travers) toutes les échelles 
auxquelles ces systèmes existent – des cellules aux sociétés, en passant par tout le reste. Pour 
réaliser cet objectif, cette thèse propose trois nouveaux piliers théoriques : (1) la neuro-
éthologie variationnelle, qui est une nouvelle façon d’aborder la neuro-éthologie – c’est-à-

7 
 
dire l’étude du comportement adaptatif et de son contrôle – basée sur une formulation 
générale des contraintes auxquelles doivent se plier tout système cognitif, provenant de la 
théorie de l’information (le principe de minimisation de l’énergie libre) ; (2) l’écologie 
variationnelle, qui est une nouvelle perspective (plus spécifique) ouverte sur le projet des 
écologies cognitives, dont le but est d’expliquer les mécanismes qui permettent l’alignement 
mutuel de groupes d’organismes dotés d’une structure hiérarchique et qui construisent 
ensemble leur niche écologique, d’une part, et de leur niche partagée, d’autre part ; enfin, (3) 
la théorie des affordances culturelles, un cadre théorique (encore plus spécifique) qui rend 
compte de l’organisation de la culture, de l’action, de la cognition, de l’apprentissage 
humains, par le biais des affordances environnementales et des régimes de l’attention 
(culturels) correspondants. Cette thèse développe un argument, basé sur ces cadres 
théoriques, contre l’essentialisme par rapport aux frontières des systèmes cognitifs dans la 
philosophie des sciences cognitives (c’est-à-dire, les théories qui privilégient un seul type de 
frontière). Cette thèse fournit l’argument selon lequel les frontières des systèmes cognitifs 
sont multiples, enchâssées, et relatives aux intérêts des chercheurs – et propose une 
résolution de la dialectique entre l’internalisme et l’externalisme dans la philosophie des 
sciences cognitives.

2. Acknowledgements 
 
Dedicated to my grandfather, Bernard Désormeau,  
and to my grandmother, Françoise Désormeau Couture.  
Grand-papa, tu m’as toujours dit :  
« Si tu fais quelque chose, fais-le bien, ou bien ne le fais pas du tout. »  
J’espère que tu trouveras que j’ai bien fait.   
 
This thesis would not have been possible without the help and support of several people, 
groups, and institutions. The first group of people that I wish to thank comprises my mentors.  
 
To begin, I want to express my deep and unending gratitude and admiration to 
Laurence Kirmayer. Laurence has been with me from the start of this adventure, taking me on 
when I was a young Master’s student. Laurence has become a father figure and, dare I say, a 
dear friend. Laurence, it may sound cheesy, but you have inspired me to achieve my dreams. 
You’ve shown me what it means to work as a team. Thanks to you, I found an intellectual 
home at the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry and a group of friends and peers 
at the Culture and Mental Health Research Unit. I am, and I will always be, grateful to you.  
 
Karl Friston is an intellectual titan. I have rarely been starstruck, but meeting Karl in 
May 2016 was one of those times. It was my pleasure to learn first-hand that he is also a kind, 
endearing, and witty soul. Karl, you took me under your wing – not only showing me the 
ropes, but becoming one of my PhD supervisors and friends as well. I have learned so much 
from you. I am deeply grateful for the warm welcoming atmosphere that you provide us at 
the Functional Imaging Lab and for your constant, friendly support and mentorship. Thanks 
to you, London has become my second home.  
 
Ian Gold deserves thanks for being one of the kindest humans that I have ever met in 
my life. Ian, you were there for me when things got crazy and you were a ray of light when I 
needed it most, and you have helped to guide me through this degree. I am deeply grateful for 
your help and support.  
 
Samuel Veissière, you are my brother. Sam, I love you. You showed me what it 
means to be an adult in academia. What has resulted from our collaboration has been an 
experience of genuine intellectual connection and mutual recognition, which grew into one of 
the most rewarding friendships that I have ever experienced. I can say without the shadow of 
a doubt that one of the greatest experiences in my entire life was our road trip/conference 
travel to Australia. This was an initiation rite of the deepest significance and the experience 

9 
 
has stayed with me. In my career as a graduate student, I could not have hoped to be 
supported as consistently and generously by a mentor and friend. 
 
Pierre Poirier, even after all these years, you still find ways to support me. At the risk 
of repeating myself, I could not have asked for a better Master’s supervisor. Your constant 
interest, care, compassion, and upbeat nature have made this adventure all the better. I will 
always be grateful for your helping me find my way.  
 
 The next person to thank is my very close friend and collaborator, Axel Constant. 
Axel, you are just the best. No, seriously. You are a star. You are kind, fun, brilliant, and 
reliable – the perfect work partner. I look forward to a sunny future working alongside you. 
You were my first student, and I have had the privilege of seeing you blossom into a full-
fledged, amazingly talented, insanely creative genius. I love you bro.  
 
The next person I want to thank is Paul Badcock – from the bottom of my heart. Paul, 
you’re such a lovely, loving human. I have the fondest memories of discovering new places 
with you. Love you brother. You were the first person I met through my collaboration with 
Karl, and our friendship-collaboration set the tone for years to follow – and set a high bar. 
You’re such a great guy and an inspiring (not to mention inspired) scholar. I’m deeply 
enthusiastic about our continuing collaboration and I’m so, so proud of what we’ve already 
accomplished together. Shoulder bump and hugs.  
Next to thank is Casper Hesp. Casper, you are just amazing. I have learned so much 
from you. You’re my brother from far away. You made my experience at the Functional 
Imaging Lab such an exciting and life changing experience – the Dutch and Canadian duo. 
I’ll always be grateful for your kindly showing me around London! Genuinely I’m excited to 
have such a cool and gifted close friend and collaborator. I truly look forward to our future 
collaborations and projects.  
 
Next, I would like to thank collaborators who have become friends and mentors: 
Michael Kirchhoff and Micah Allen. I met Micah and Michael through the internet – a very 
postmodern way to start a friendship. Michael and Micah, I find the two of you inspiring. I 
hope to strike the kind of work-life balance that you have achieved, and to have as love-filled 
a personal life as you both. You’ve shown me that Hume’s advice still rings true: “Be a 
philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man.” I have tried very hard to emulate 
you – I hope to live in a house in the bush, with my partner and our dogs, and my log cabin 
(like Michael and Heidegger). 
 
Next, I would like to thank my long-standing besties: Gustave Lavoie Prud’homme, 
William-J. Beauchemin, Nabil Bouizegarene, Joel Entwistle, and Sébastien Coté. I love you 

10 
 
guys so much. Thank you for being there – I wouldn’t be here without you. Thanks also to 
my friends who have helped me grow, personally and intellectually: Ian Robertson, Jonathan 
St-Onge, Safae Essafi Tremblay, Simon C. Tremblay, Thomas Parr, David Benrimoh, Nick 
Brancazio, Auguste Nahas, Eric White, Michael Lifshitz, Ana Gómez-Carrillo De Castro, Iris 
Rapoport, Jared Vasil, Mel Andrews, Liza Solomonova, Bruno Dubuc, Ishan Walpola, Ceren 
Kaypak, Patrick Garon-Sayegh, Thomas Thiery, Yann Harel, Adam Safron, Josh Bamford, 
Viky Neascu, Jacob Taylor, Moriah Stendel, Aron Vallinder, Ariela Lavana, Alison Starkey, 
Naila Kuhlmann, Marcelle Partouche Gutierrez, Frank Muttenzer, Philippe Blouin, Ariane 
L’heureux-Garcia, Vincent Laliberté, and Ryan Smith. Thanks also to my students, who are 
deeply inspiring and will do great things: Alice Hickling and Irene Arnaldo. 
 
Obviously, I am deeply grateful to all those who read previous drafts of my thesis: my 
doctoral supervisors Laurence Kirmayer, Ian Gold, Karl Friston, as well as Axel Constant, 
Pierre Poirier Samuel Veissière, Safae Essafi Tremblay, Simon C. Tremblay, Adam Safron, 
Ian Robertson, and Nick Brancazio.  
 
Finally, I want to give special thanks to everyone who supported me in my personal 
life: Maman, Babs, Laurie, Dad, Jack, Gloria – I love you all deeply. William-J. Beauchemin, 
you have been a daily source of support and you are the best flatmate a guy could ask for. 
Thanks to my other half, Zoë, for being there, and for being loving, open, compassionate, and 
understanding. I love you. Finally, merci grand-papa and grand-maman. Je vous aime. 
 
To finish, I would like to express my deep and sincere gratitude to my funders. They 
made this research possible in a very real, material sense. My doctoral degree was funded by 
a Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarship courtesy of the Social Sciences 
and Humanities Research Council of Canada. I also benefitted from a Michael Smith Foreign 
Study Supplements from the same organisation, which allowed me to undertake one of the 
most amazing adventures of my life: my first internship at the Wellcome Trust Centre for 
Neuroimaging’s Functional Imaging Lab, at University College London with Karl Friston’s 
group. I would also like to thank deeply the current provider of my funding, the Canada First 
Research Excellence Fund, which was awarded to McGill University for the Healthy Brains 
for Healthy Lives initiative, and which in turn funded my last year of doctoral work, as well 
as the Office for Graduate and Postgraduate Studies at McGill, which awarded me with a 
Graduate Mobility Award to support my second internship in London. 
 
Thank you all so much.  
Love, 
Maxwell

4. Introduction 
 
4.1. Have we lost our minds? 
The questions raised by the integrated, adaptive behaviour of multiscale systems are at the 
heart of this doctoral thesis. Generally speaking, the cognitive sciences study the adaptive 
behaviour and cognitive processes of organisms, which are living systems that exhibit 
intelligent, situationally appropriate forms of action. The crucial observation that underwrites 
my doctoral work is that most of these systems are systems of systems. Multicellular 
organisms are composed of systems embedded in larger systems, which are, in turn, 
embedded in still larger systems: cells are embedded in organs, which interact in a 
coordinated way to give rise to the activities of organisms, which are themselves embedded 
in larger social groups. Each such system, at every scale, interprets its respective environment 
in order to coordinate meaningful patterns of behaviour. Somehow, by some apparent 
miracle, the whole system of systems moves together in an integrated fashion. How does this 
differentiation and integration arise? 
 
Consider a human sociocultural group; say, the McGill University community in 
Montreal, Canada. Any given human society is composed of several, densely coupled 
components; some of these are living, thinking agents, and others are material artefacts, codes 
of conduct, norms, places, and practices, which together constitute an ecological niche. In the 
case of McGill, the former group of components comprises undergraduate and graduate 
students, postdoctoral fellows, professors, lecturers, research staff, other faculty members, 
administration and support staff, and so on; the latter comprises large parts of Mount Royal, 
as well as the buildings where teaching and research take place, not to mention lab equipment 
and research materials. The denizens of McGill engage in those patterned cultural practices 
that define McGill University as a sociocultural community, e.g., lecturing and listening, note 
taking, researching, supervising, form filling, thesis writing, and so on. The agents that make 
up the McGill community, in turn, are themselves composed of systems that are also alive, 
and which must perform situationally appropriate actions at a subordinate scale. The student 
body, thus, is composed of human bodies, themselves made up of organs, which function 
thanks to the regulated operation of their component cells. Tissues and cells (even when 
cancerous) also interpret their environment (human bodies) to act in situationally appropriate 
ways (appropriate for the cancer, if not the host). These systems are nested into one another 
along increasing spatial scales.  

13 
 
 
Somehow, all these moving parts are integrated in – and indeed, through – adaptive 
behaviour, in loops of action and perception. The coordinated, well-regulated action of cells 
allows for the good functioning of organ tissues, such as the heart and brain; the coordinated 
integration of the functions performed by myriad organs of the human body results in 
perception and action by human agents, both automatic and intentional; and agents 
themselves interact in a way robust and coherent enough for us to speak of, say, McGill 
University as a distinct sociocultural community, with its own values, norms, and ways of 
doing things.  
 
To explain the coherence of systems as complex as human communities and their 
dynamics, the way they act, their manner of changing and evolving time, clearly appeals to 
processes that unfold over several scales. We have just considered spatially nested systems, 
in which small component systems are progressively embedded into larger ones. Something 
similar can be said about temporal scales. At real-time or mechanistic timescales – which 
comprise events on the order of milliseconds to seconds and minutes – we need to explain 
how organisms are able to perceive, interpret, and act upon their worlds in situationally 
appropriate ways; at ontogenetic or developmental timescales – on the order of minutes to 
years – we need to explain how the bodies and brains of organisms mature and develop; for 
Homo sapiens, this means to explain how human agents become encultured and learn the 
norms that govern their societies, i.e., ‘the kind of thing that we do here’; finally, at 
evolutionary and phylogenetic timescales – events unfolding over intergenerational 
timescales – we need to explain the deep evolutionary and historical processes that have led 
to modern human phenotypes. Clearly, this sequence of scales also evinces a nested structure. 
And by some miracle of nature, all these processes unfold in an integrated way.  
 
All of these processes contribute meaningfully to what we call ‘mind’, and in ignoring 
the amazing complexity of this nested structure of systems of systems raises a danger – that of 
losing our minds. 
 
In ignoring the nested structure of cognitive systems, we tun the risk turning a blind 
eye to some of the most important phenomena for understanding and explaining adaptive 
behaviour and action. This raises deep questions for the cognitive sciences: What do the 
cognitive sciences look like when the issue of multiscale dynamics takes centre stage? What 
do explanations look like in such a regime? How does systemic integration take place across 
scales? How can we best study multiscale systems, at and across all the scales at which they 
exist – from cells to societies?  
 

14 
 
This thesis explores theoretical and methodological questions related to the study of 
multiscale cognitive systems in the cognitive sciences. In other words, the thesis clarifies 
what is at stake in the modelling of systemic dynamics that span several spatial and temporal 
scales. The aim of this doctoral thesis is to articulate – and examine the philosophical 
implications of – a framework for research in the cognitive sciences to study the multiscale 
systemic dynamics of the mind.  
 
4.2. Previous attempts to address multiscale systemic dynamics in philosophy 
That phenomena of mind involve systems that exist at and across multiple different spatial 
and temporal scales has, of course, not gone unnoticed – and has stoked lively debate in 
philosophy in the cognitive sciences. Broadly speaking, this topic has been taken up and 
explored in the context different theoretical debates, the two most well-known of which are 
that between reductionist and emergentist approaches to the ontology and epistemology of 
cognitive systems, and that between internalist and externalist approaches to the boundaries 
of cognition. Here, I briefly discuss the first project and explain why I have chosen largely to 
avoid casting the issue of multiscale dynamics in the terms posed by this debate. I then 
motivate my approach by discussing the dialectic at play in a debate more aligned with my 
aims.  
 
4.2.1. Reductionism and emergentism 
The idea that the systems studied by the natural sciences are structure as nested systems of 
systems is not new; contemporary philosophical work on this topic goes back at least to the 
British emergentists (Ablowitz, 1939; Broad, 2014/1925; Mill, 1843; Morgan, 2013/1923); 
for a historical review, see (McLaughlin, 1992). This literature emphasised the idea that 
natural systems in general were endowed with a hierarchical structure: atoms form molecules, 
which are the constituent parts of cells, which make up organs – and so on. ‘Higher-order’ 
phenomena were said to emerge from ‘lower-order’ ones. Debates abounded over how to 
understand the hierarchical structure and what exactly were the levels at play – the history of 
which is far beyond the scope of this doctoral thesis.  
 
Between the 1970s and 2000s, the idea of emergence was mainstreamed via its central 
place in the debate over the epistemological and ontological status of the causal powers of 
emergent phenomena. This debate centred on the idea of downward causation (Campbell, 
1974). This view is premised on the idea that biological systems are hierarchically organised, 
that is, that living systems evince nested levels of organisation. Downward causation is the 

15 
 
view that phenomena occurring at higher levels of organisation have causal effects on the 
world and on their constituent parts – causal effects that were not merely derivative from, or 
epiphenomena of, the causal powers of their constituent parts.  
 
The debate in that raged philosophy over emergentism has tended to focus on whether 
it makes sense to speak of downward causation. The two main flavours of emergentism are 
ontological (or strong) emergentism and epistemological (or weak) emergentism. Strong 
emergentism is the view that emergent phenomena have independent existence and causal 
powers, ontologically speaking, from the phenomena from which they emerge (Bishop, 2008; 
Boogerd, Bruggeman, Richardson, Stephan, & Westerhoff, 2005; Juarrero, 1999; Kauffman, 
1993; Maturana & Varela, 1980; Thompson, 2010). This view has come under much critical 
scrutiny; for instance, some argue that to speak of downward causation conflates relations of 
causation (which can only hold between two distinct things) and those of composition 
(Bechtel, 2009; Kistler, 2009). The most popular position seems to be that the causal powers 
of emergent phenomena are inexistent; emergent phenomena are epiphenomenal and 
downward causation is not philosophically respectable (Kim, 1999, 2006). 
 
Weak emergentism, which today seems to be the dominant version of emergentism 
(Bedau & Humphreys, 2008), is the view that emergence is an appearance that is an effect of 
the limitations of our scientific (or broader explanatory) models – i.e., the view that whether a 
set of phenomena are emergent or not is determinable only relative to some theory that can 
predict the properties of emergent phenomena (Bedau, 1997, 2002; Craver, 2007; Craver & 
Bechtel, 2007; Hempel & Oppenheim, 1948). The absence of strong metaphysical 
commitments typically favours this flavour of emergentism.  
 
From my point of view, the debate over reductionism and emergentism debate is not 
the most productive, nor particularly generative, to answer questions about how best to study 
multiscale systems. The fact that biological systems possess a clear hierarchical organisation 
is no longer debated in biology and the cognitive sciences. It is an established, measurable 
fact about biological systems that they evince such a structure. The causal role of hierarchical 
structure, for example, in increasing information processing efficiency in hierarchically 
organised nervous systems, or increasing robustness to environmental perturbation, is 
increasingly well understood (Perdikis, Huys, & Jirsa, 2011; Sporns, 2013). Indeed, such a 
scientific understanding of the causal effects of hierarchical nesting predates the debate in 
philosophy by some time (Simon, 1965). Settling metaphysical debates about the causal 
powers of emergent phenomena does little to help us answer questions related to how best to 
study multiscale systems.  

16 
 
 
Some in the cognitive sciences have proposed a fruitful resolution of this dialectic by 
suggesting that we must be both emergentists and reductionists when we study complex 
nested systems (Bechtel, 2007, 2009; Bechtel & Abrahamsen, 2010). That we must be 
emergentists means that we must recognise that emergent phenomena exist, that they seem to 
be causally relevant – they seem to have real causal effects on the world in which they are 
embedded qua emergent phenomena. That we must be emergentists means that we must 
engage with the complexities of systems that exist at several scales. That we must also be 
reductionists means, in a complementary fashion, that we still ought to strive to produce 
mechanistic explanations for such emergent phenomena – speaking to the ways in which 
higher-order system dynamics organise constituent parts of the system, and the ways in which 
the system affects its embedding environment qua system. Indeed, it may be that focusing on 
downward causation, as the debate between emergentists and reductionists has tended to do – 
debates over the metaphysical status of the effects of system-level dynamics on the 
components of the system – misses some of the crucial ways in which emergence displays its 
causal efficacy; namely, through the dynamics of the whole system and through its effects, as 
a system, on its embedding environment. 
 
From a mathematical point of view, formal models exist that can accommodate either 
of these perspectives. (Non-technically minded readers are invited to skip this brief 
mathematical excursus.) The theoretical dialectic here is that between synergetics and 
renormalization group theory. Synergetics provides a formal framework for modelling 
circular causality, i.e., for modelling bidirectional causal relations between dynamics 
unfolding at different levels of description (Haken, 1977; Haken, 1983, 2013). In the 
synergetics approach, the microstates that compose a lower-order phenomenon are averaged 
to yield macrostates, which form phenomena at the higher scale. In this sense, mixtures of 
microstates cause macrostates. The other direction is ensured via the enslaving principle. 
Briefly, by construction, macrostates evolve more slowly than microstates. Technically, this 
is because decay back to average dynamics of the entire system (aka, the centre manifold) is 
faster than the flow on the centre manifold itself. In the synergetics model, it will look as if 
the centre manifold is enslaving all local perturbations away from that manifold, which 
licences us to speak of a causal influence of higher-order or emergent phenomena 
(macrostates) on the systems from which they emerge (microstates).  
 
Renormalization group theory, which originated in quantum mechanics (Shirkov, 
Bogoliubov, & Bogoliubov, 1959), provides the opposite perspective on emergent 
phenomena; i.e., that causality flows only one way, from lower- to higher-order phenomena. 

17 
 
The basic idea is that if there is some way of describing a system and that there is some way 
of moving from descriptions at one scale to the next, such that the form of any complete 
(dynamical) description of system remains unchanged, then that system is said to be 
renormalizable. One perplexing feature about such mathematical systems is that such 
transformations are often unidirectional.  That is, while one can move from microstate 
descriptions to macrostate descriptions, one cannot recover the microstates that went into the 
mix to yield the macrostates. This asymmetry means that in renormalizable systems, 
microscopic states cause macroscopic states in a strong sense, and that we cannot speak of 
deterministic relations in the inverse direction.  
 
From my point of view, new developments in the cognitive sciences and mathematics 
render the debate between emergentists and reductionists moot – especially constructs and 
techniques from systems theory, which permeate and guide much of the work in this thesis. 
(Von Bertalanffy, 1950, 1972). Systems theory is an entire field of enquiry devoted to the 
study of system-level dynamics and processes. Such mathematical techniques have enabled 
scientists working from a systems theoretic perspective to study systemic dynamics 
rigorously – leading to the emergence of ‘systems thinking’ (Weinberg, 1975) and indeed, to 
entirely new fields of enquiry organised around the study of system-level causal effects and 
systemic dynamics, including computational systems biology (Kitano, 2002), systems 
neuroscience (Van Hemmen & Sejnowski, 2005), and systems ecology (Odum, 1994).  
 
In any event, questions about whether or not emergent phenomena have causal effects 
that are independent of those of the systems from which they emerge, and if so to which 
extent they are, seem like empirical questions. Settling questions about the metaphysics of 
downward causation in emergent systems tells us little about how best to study their effects, 
qua integrated system, on its embedding environment. More importantly, it tells us nothing at 
all about how the dynamics of such systems are integrated across scales – that is, how the 
system can act on the world in an integrated fashion despite having constituents at different 
scales.  
 
One might object to this as follows: if we were able to establish that emergent 
properties do (or do not) have top-down causal effects or causal powers independent from 
those of their realisation base, this would in effect provide constraints on the kinds of 
allowable explanations and might guide interpretations of the phenomenon to be understood. 
This, however, begs the question of how one might establish the fact that emergent properties 
have such causal powers at all. It seems like there is no possible recourse to formal theories 

18 
 
(e.g., to mathematical models) to settle these issues – since both the emergentist and the 
reductionist options are formally defensible.    
 
Whether or not some phenomenon should be studied as an emergent phenomenon 
seems to depend on the phenomenon being studied – and mathematical tools exist that can be 
used to develop and justify either approach. It may be, for instance, that emergentist models 
based on the synergetic approach are better suited to explain biological or cognitive 
phenomena; and that renormalization group theoretical approaches are, in turn, better suited 
to approach dynamics at quantum scales. We return to these issues surrounding emergentism 
and reductionism – and provide a sustained argument for our rejection of this debate – in the 
ninth section of this thesis, which provides a comprehensive discussion of my findings.  
 
4.2.2. Internalism and externalism 
For my purposes, the debate in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences between internalists 
and externalists about the boundaries of cognitive systems is more prescient. This debate is 
over where to draw the boundaries of cognitive systems. In the cognitive sciences, there has 
been progress in at least trying to deal with the complexities of systems of systems, which 
often explicitly draw upon the mathematical resources just discussed from complex systems 
theory – making this a more fruitful point of departure.  
 
It is worth mentioning that, prior to (and into) the 1980s, many actors in the cognitive 
sciences were committed explicitly to the idea that the workings of the brain were only 
relevant as ‘mere implementation’ – mere plumbing, in effect – and that implementation had 
little or nothing to say about cognitive processes and the mind. Cognitive scientist David 
Marr, for instance, proposed an epoch-defining framework to study cognition that feature 
three distinct levels of explanation: the computational level, which specifies the information-
processing problem to be solved; the algorithmic level, which specifies algorithms and 
representations that are capable of solving the problem specified at the computational level; 
and the implementation level, which specifies the physical structures that realise these 
algorithms and representations (Marr, 1982). Intelligence was seen as relating to the 
algorithms and representations that were involved in cognitive processes – with 
implementation seen as mere machinery. 
 
Since the 1980s, however, in part thanks to the rise of sophisticated experimental 
methods like genetic sequencing and neuro-imaging, and the shift towards biological 
classificatory systems in psychiatry (e.g., the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders and the Research Domain Criteria framework proposed by the 

19 
 
US National Institute of Mental Health), the main models of explanation in the cognitive 
sciences have, above all, tended to have an internalist, or neuro-reductionist, flavour (Bechtel, 
2007; Bracken et al., 2013; Choudhury & Slaby, 2016; Gold, 2009; Gold & Kirmayer, 2007; 
Guze, 1989; Kirmayer & Gold, 2012). The main characteristic of these internalist models of 
explanation is that they identify the only relevant causal determinants of human behaviour 
and mental life as being those internal to the boundary of the skull (e.g.., neural processes) or 
the boundary of the organism (e.g., genetic and epigenetic processes). Of course, any study of 
the brain or genome will feature phenomena that ‘point outwards’ (the brain represents 
features of the outside world, the genome and especially epigenome are reactive to 
environmental states and situations), but on these views, the causally relevant machinery is 
still housed within the boundary of skull or skin.   
 
Psychiatry provides a good case study of internalism. Today, psychiatry is understood 
by those who share the internalist view as “clinically applied neuroscience” (Insel & Quirion, 
2005), that is, as a science the scope of which covers internal, biological causal determinants 
of human behaviour and mental life (especially those located in the brain). The 
mainstreaming of the internalist model of explanation has, accordingly, tended to privilege 
methods investigating causal factors internal to the organism; for example, genetic 
sequencing and animal model studies, single-cell neural recordings, structural/functional 
neuroimaging, and psychopharmacology – none of which foreground factors outside the 
organism. The prominence of internalist model in the cognitive sciences has – to the chagrin 
of many, and despite criticism (Choudhury & Slaby, 2016) – side-lined approaches that 
instead focus on the causal determinants that are operative at other spatial and temporal scales 
– such as the influence of causal factors such as cultural group identification, first-person 
phenomenological experience, socioeconomic status (Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017; 
Kirmayer, Lemelson, & Cummings, 2015). Of course, we should note that the cognitive 
sciences are broader in scope that their applications to psychiatry – and that psychiatry raises 
additional issues related to pathology and context that may be less immediately apparent in 
some cognitive sciences. But this is the general picture: for having too narrowly focused on 
internal factors, psychiatry has lost sight of much of what plays a role in the working of 
human minds. 
 
The problems and limitations of internalism did not go unnoticed. By now, there is a 
well-established and still growing externalist literature that has pushed back against 
internalist views. Externalism, broadly, is the view that factors outside the boundary of the 
skull or skin can meaningfully be considered to be involved in cognitive processes, and that 

20 
 
the boundaries of cognitive systems spill out or cross into the external world (Gallagher, 
2017; Hutto & Myin, 2013; Thompson, 2010).  
 
Externalist views are, on the face of it, quite amenable to act as the theoretical 
foundation of an approach to multiscale systems and their dynamics. Their aim is to study 
cognitive systems in a way that does justice to the ‘external’ causal determinants of mental 
life – those factors that play causal roles in the generation of adaptive behaviour, but which 
lie beyond the boundaries of skull and skin (Kirmayer et al., 2015; Newen, De Bruin, & 
Gallagher, 2018). Many authors today emphasise ‘external’ causal processes, including: the 
role of the body in cognition, a position known as embodied cognition (Gallagher, 2006; Noë, 
2004; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991); the role of action in cognition and perception, 
known as the enactive approach to cognition (Engel, Friston, & Kragic, 2016; Gallagher, 
2017; Thompson, 2010); and the role of context and broader cognitive ecologies in the 
generation by organisms of adaptive action, variously defended by proponents of extended 
and embedded cognition (Clark, 2008) and by advocates of ecological psychology (Gibson, 
1979; Hutchins, 2010) – all of which we review in detail below.  
 
Unfortunately, this shift to externalist approaches led to scientists and philosophers 
throwing out the metaphorical baby with the metaphorical bathwater. Externalists typically 
rejected the tools and metaphors that drove internalist approaches, such as the digital 
computer metaphor of the brain, favouring more dynamical metaphors like the brain as a 
steering wheel or a Watt governor (Van Gelder, 1998); or the idea that the brain or genes 
encode information (Thompson, 2010). Thus, the rejection of internalism led to the rejection 
of the tools, constructs, and methods typically associated with internalism, namely, 
information theory and computational modelling.  
 
This seems to have become the dominant view in externalist theories by the early 
2000s. The enactive philosophers Shaun Gallagher and Alva Noë, for instance, reject 
computational and information-theoretic explanations in the cognitive sciences (Gallagher, 
2006, 2017; Noë, 2004). Philosopher Evan Thompson, in his magnum opus Mind and Life, 
which has become the central text of enactivism, rejects the use of information theory and 
notions such as encoding as being anything but useful metaphors in the cognitive sciences 
(Thompson, 2010). The most extreme form of this position is the radical enactivism of 
philosophers Dan Hutto and Erik Myin. In a nutshell, radical enactivism rejects the appeal to 
internal representations to explain adaptive behaviour. Radical enactivists are suspicious of 
appeals to information theory and computation to explain cognitive processes, and more 
precisely, believe that we will not explain cognitive semantics (i.e., the representational 

21 
 
contents of experience) by appealing to constructs and strategies from information theory 
(Hutto & Myin, 2017; Hutto & Myin, 2013). We review these approaches, as well as what we 
take to be their limitations, below.  
 
Part of the original work accomplished by this thesis is to reconcile the tools that 
power more internalist approaches to the study of cognitive systems with a broadly 
pragmatist or enactive view; and indeed, to rehabilitate the ideas that animated internalist 
approaches in a way that makes them amenable and complementary to externalist 
approaches. A multiscale approach cannot merely consist in the rejection or denial of 
internalist approaches.  
 
4.3. The approach presented here 
This thesis develops three new theoretical frameworks that collectively function as a new 
model of explanation for the cognitive sciences. A model of explanation is a theoretical 
model of the underlying assumptions operative in a given science, the function of which is to 
account for how that science is able to construct explanations for the phenomena within its 
explanatory scope (Bechtel, 2007; Craver, 2007; Cummins, 1983; Kendler & Parnas, 2008; 
Murphy, 2010; Schaffner, 1993). There are many such models in the different sciences, each 
appealing to different types or families of causal factors to generate explanations of the 
phenomena within their purview. This doctoral thesis focuses on models of explanation that 
are operative in the cognitive sciences – which I use as an umbrella term to covers the 
scientific, multidisciplinary study of the mind and behaviour, including philosophy, 
psychology, neuroscience, psychiatry, biology, ethology, anthropology, and computer science 
(among other disciplines).  
 
This thesis introduces a new reading of – and an argument against – essentialism in 
the context of debates in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences over where to draw the 
boundaries of cognitive systems. This usage is not typical in philosophy and should be 
justified briefly. Essentialism in philosophy typically relates to the use of necessary and 
sufficient conditions for inclusion in a given category. With regard to the issue of where to 
draw the boundaries of cognitive systems, essentialism – as defined in this thesis – is the 
view according to which cognitive systems must be defined relative to one privileged type of 
boundary. Essentialism is the main critical target of this thesis. Indeed, in the cognitive 
sciences, most models of explanation are essentialist. The four chapters of this thesis build 
upon each other, culminating in the final chapter, which provides an argument against 
essentialist views on the boundaries of cognitive systems in the cognitive sciences. Against 

22 
 
essentialism, this thesis proposes ontological and methodological pluralism. Ontological 
pluralism means that the boundaries of cognitive systems are multiple, nested, and interest-
relative. This means that any definition of cognitive systems in terms of necessary and 
sufficient conditions, relative to any single type of boundary, is arbitrary and mistaken. 
Methodological pluralism follows from the ontological variety, and entails that a variety of 
different methods, operating at different scales and inspecting different boundaries, is 
necessary to study the mind; this, in turn, entails abandoning the idea that there is one single 
method that will be appropriate to study cognitive systems.  
 
Today, the most common form of essentialism in the literature is internalism. When I 
initially envisaged my doctoral research project, my impression was that the bogeyman to be 
exorcized was internalism. I turned to the literature on externalism to arm myself against 
internalism. However, as I progressed in my research, I came to the conclusion that some of 
the main externalist views on the boundaries of cognitive systems, while more conducive to 
my goal to develop a multiscale model of cognition than internalist models, were guilty of 
proposing a priori boundaries as well. It became clear that any kind of essentialism about the 
boundaries of cognition is ill suited to the development of an explanatory model able to 
address multiscale phenomena. Many of my favourite externalists were also essentialists; 
with a few notable exceptions (Clark, 2008, 2017), they simply privileged different 
boundaries and levels of description over others. The Equal Partner Principle of radical 
enactivism (Hutto & Myin, 2013) is perhaps the clearest and most extreme articulation of this 
view, and claims – in an a priori manner – that the causal factors that lead to cognition and 
behaviour (in the brain, body, and environment) all count equally and are equally prescient.  
 
This view clearly has significant advantages. However, when read as an essentialist 
claim about the boundaries of all cognitive systems, this seems wrongheaded. Surely, the 
different causal factors at play in a given process will not (or at least, not always) have the 
same weight – and not all the factors that might be relevant for cognition in general will turn 
out to be relevant for every function that is investigated by cognitive scientists. While more 
amenable to a perspective working across different spatial and temporal scales than a view of 
the mind as ‘what the brain does’, then, the radical enactive perspective also makes a priori, 
essentialist claims about where to draw the relevant boundaries of cognitive systems.  
 
In summary, essentialism in the cognitive sciences is Janus-faced: internalism and 
externalism are two versions of the same essentialist claim. My contention is that, on either 
account, we lose much of what contributes to the phenomenon that we call mind. To work 
towards a truly multiscale approach to systemic dynamics of cognitive systems, we must 

23 
 
blaze a path between the Scylla of internalism and the Charybdis of externalism. To avoid 
losing our minds, losing sight of the full phenomenon of mind and cognition, we must reject 
any perspective on cognitive systems that privileges one scale or level of description over 
others, and crucially, we must formulate an alternative explanatory model that can 
accommodate its full generality.  
 
In place of a metaphysics of emergence, the papers collected in this thesis propose a 
formal ontology of multiscale cognitive systems. As we are using the phrase here, to produce 
a formal ontology is to employ a formalism – in this case, the mathematical resources made 
available by the FEP, and more specifically, multiscale constructions of the Markov blanket 
formalism, which we review in detail below – to answer questions traditionally understood as 
metaphysical ones; i.e., What does it mean to exists as a system? The advantage of our formal 
approach to ontology, which we propose as an alternative to the metaphysics of emergence, is 
that it does not import a priori metaphysical assumptions into our study of multiscale 
systemic dynamics. Instead, it implements a very minimal notion of systemhood, based on 
the notion of conditional independence, as the main criterion for what counts as a system, and 
comes as close as we can to letting cognitive systems carve out their own boundaries, via 
their dynamics.  
 
The four papers collected in this thesis together form a multiscale model of 
explanation for the cognitive sciences, which serves as the basis for a critique of essentialist 
models of cognition. This thesis accomplishes its aim by articulating three novel theoretical 
frameworks to study cognitive systems at and across all scales at which they exist: (1) 
variational neuroethology, a new approach to theoretical neuroethology – the study of 
adaptive behaviour and the control systems that have evolved to coordinate it – that is 
grounded in an account of the information-theoretic constraints on cognizing organisms, 
called the free-energy principle; (2) variational ecology, a new take on cognitive ecology that 
further specifies how hierarchically structured organisms, which craft their own ecological 
niches, attune themselves to their niche (and vice-versa); and finally, (3) the cultural 
affordances framework, which provides a detailed account of human action, cognition, 
learning, and culture in terms of environmental affordances and regimes of attention. Based 
on these novel theoretical pillars, this thesis provides a resolution of the dialectic (and false 
dichotomy) between internalism and externalism in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences; 
and provides an account from first principles of where to draw the boundaries of cognitive 
systems.

5. A comprehensive review of the relevant literature 
In this section, I first review broadly the bodies of literature upon which I have drawn in the 
thesis. When applicable and relevant, I point out the lacunae in each of these bodies, which 
has motivated the work in this thesis. I then discuss closely related projects in philosophy and 
the cognitive sciences that have influenced the course of my research and that have 
converged on similar results.  
 
5.1. Literature review 
I have drawn on four main bodies of literature to develop the material contained in this thesis. 
The first cluster of literature is work on the variational free-energy principle (FEP), drawn 
mainly from computational neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology. The FEP is ultimately 
the theoretical backbone of this thesis, and does much of the heavy lifting to explain the 
multiscale integration of system dynamics. The second cluster of literature is work in 
philosophy and the cognitive sciences carried out from an externalist perspective, that 
criticizes internalist conceptions of the boundaries of cognitive systems. This literature is 
subdivided in two groups: work on so-called ‘4E approaches’ to cognition – i.e., embodied, 
extended, embedded, enactive approaches to cognitive systems – and the literature on 
ecological psychology. I then discuss some of the literature in cognitive and evolutionary 
anthropology that motivated the work on human cultural cognition and action that is 
proposed in this thesis. Finally, the last body of literature upon which I draw is the 
intersection of the first two: the ecological-enactive approach and what has become known as 
Bayesian enactivism, or enactivism 2.0.  
 
5.1.1. The variational free-energy principle  
The first body of literature upon which this thesis draws is work on one of the fastest growing 
(and in recent years, most influential) approaches to the study of cognitive systems in the 
cognitive sciences: the FEP and its corollary, active inference. It is hard to overstate the 
significance of the FEP for my research agenda in this thesis. Indeed, the FEP is the 
theoretical lead bearer of this thesis, which enables the formulation of a rigorous multiscale 
framework to study cognition and adaptive behaviour. The FEP provides mathematical 
framework and computational modelling tools that, when properly construed, preclude any 
essentialist interpretations of the boundaries of cognition. 
 
In a nutshell, the FEP is a description of the conditions that must be met by any self-
organizing system that exists at nonequilibrium steady state; that is, the necessary constraints 

25 
 
on any system that exists, i.e., that maintains itself in a bounded set of states over time and 
that persists as such a system in the face of environmental perturbations (Friston, 2010, 
2013). Importantly, this means that the FEP is formulated for systems that exist far from 
thermodynamic equilibrium, in what is known as the regime of nonequilibrium steady states 
(Ao, Chen, & Shi, 2013). Thermodynamic equilibrium is the state of affairs in which the 
quantity entropy is maximised; where entropy is essentially a measure of the spread, 
dispersion, or number of configurations in which a system can exist; to be alive entails 
resisting this entropic decay (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Jarzynski, 1997; Martyushev & 
Seleznev, 2006; Tomé, 2006).  
 
To take a simple example, a car engine functions because the degrees of freedom of 
each of its parts is limited – notably, by the engine design, which limits in the literal sense, in 
virtue of its physical structure, the possible forms of motion for its parts (e.g., pistons) 
(Turvey, 1990). Entropy is low in a functioning engine; but higher in a broken engine – one, 
say, with wobbly pistons. Most systems in nature, from lightning bolts to glasses of sweet 
soda, inevitably increase entropy, and reach equilibrium with their environment when 
entropy is at its highest. Glasses of cool, fizzy drinks left on the kitchen counter go flat and 
become room temperature – which is the point at which they reach thermodynamic 
equilibrium with the surrounding environment. Lightning bolts dissolve the charge gradients 
that generated them, and thereby equalise the electric charge between the earth and sky. This 
is true for almost the entirety of natural systems – as most of physics is formulated for closed 
systems (that do not exchange energy/entropy with other systems) in equilibrium regimes.   
 
The FEP is a story about the remarkable fact that characterises living systems, which 
is they resist entropic decay. The FEP essentially tells us what must be true of any system 
with an attracting set, i.e., what must be true of any system with a phenotype, by virtue of 
that system having a phenotype at all (Friston, 2012, 2013). At its core, the FEP provides an 
answer to Schrödinger’s famous question, What is life? (Schrödinger, 1944).  
 
The FEP provides a crucial information-theoretic measure – called variational free-
energy – which measures how well a cognitive system is able to fulfil this condition. One 
crucial aspect of this measure is that it is extensive. In other words, it can be applied in a 
scale invariant fashion (Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2002; Mantegna & Stanley, 1995). Scale-
invariance here means that the free-energy at each scale can simply be summed or integrated 
across scales, yielding one single metric for a system across the scales at which it exists. 
Because this measure is scale invariant, one can model self-organisation at different scales, 
for different systems, and sum or integrate that measure across scales. Under the assumption 

26 
 
that phenomena across all scales of self-organisation optimise variational free energy, this 
measure is what allows one to make sense of the manner in which cognitive systems are able 
to plan and coordinate situationally appropriate behaviour. Variational free-energy, then, 
provides the key metric to explain how systems can be composed of differentiated systems at 
each scale, while also evincing integrated dynamics across scales; e.g., how an encultured 
organism – composed of organs, which are in turn composed of cells, while being situated in 
a given cultural niche and being part of local cultural groups – can adaptively act as a 
coherent, integrated whole.    
 
One of the central contributions of this thesis is to highlight and discuss the theoretical 
implications of the scale invariance of variational free-energy for the study of adaptive 
behaviour in multiscale systems. Notably, this scale-invariance allows one to compare 
different configurations of different multiscale systems (Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 
2015; Sengupta, Tozzi, Cooray, Douglas, & Friston, 2016). Without the scale-invariance of 
variational free-energy, it would be impossible to (1) compare self-organised behaviour at 
different scales within the same system – e.g., the different contributions of neural behaviour, 
functional connectivity, organism-environment interaction, and interaction among multiple 
agents to the overall adaptiveness and appropriateness of behaviour; and it would be 
impossible (2) to compare different such systems (e.g., two distinct groups or species). This is 
because without such a measure, there is no ‘common currency’ or metric between 
descriptive levels that can effectively track behavioural success at those levels, thanks to 
which one might make such comparisons. By the same token, without such measure, it is 
impossible to propose a multiscale model of cognition amenable to empirical testing and 
which resists essentialist claims about the boundaries of cognitive systems.   
 
The FEP itself says that any system that persists as a system, maintaining itself in a 
bounded set of phenotypic states, will look as if it is minimising the ‘surprisal’ associated 
with being in a given sensory state (Friston, 2010). Surprisal (aka surprise) in the context is 
an information-theoretic measure that reflects the probability of being in a surprising state; 
technically, a state associated with low probability – e.g., a fish out of water. (This 
informational surprise is not to be confused with the folk psychological notion of surprise.) 
Variational free-energy is constructed as an upper bound on surprise, based on the (sub-
personal, probabilistic) ‘beliefs’ of an organism about the causes of its sensory states. These 
beliefs are harnessed in a statistical model called a generative model (Friston, Parr, & de 
Vries, 2017). A generative model is a statistical mapping from causes to observable 
consequences; it is a graphical model of the causal factors that generate an outcome of 

27 
 
interest (Friston, Parr, et al., 2017). When the variational approach is applied to model 
cognition and living systems, the relevant generative model is a model of those causal factors 
that generate sensory outcomes; including, crucially, the actions of the organism itself. It is 
technically the joint probability distribution that describes the co-occurrence of a sensory 
state and an external state in the world. In all four chapters, we articulate a statistical 
conception of the organism’s phenotype. We can interpret the generative model as a 
statistical description of the phenotype, in the sense that it provides a description of the viable 
couplings between what the organism senses and what causes those sensations. Under the 
FEP, the adaptive actions of an organism are said to entail a generative model, in the sense 
that adaptive actions are actions within that mapping between sensation and environment.  
 
The variational free-energy can be read as (negative) evidence for such a generative 
model; with low free-energy indicating a more highly probable model. This lends the active 
inference framework the look and feel of Bayesian inference. Systems that obey the FEP via 
adaptive action are said to engage in active inference; since it will look as if such systems are 
inferring the causes of their sensory states, via the selection of adaptive action policies, i.e., 
those associated with the least free-energy (Friston, Mattout, & Kilner, 2011; Friston, 
FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2016). Variational free-energy, then, just is a 
proxy used by organisms for estimating surprise (since it is mathematically constructed as an 
upper bound on surprisal) – and by tracking this proxy and keeping it in check, cognitive 
systems are effectively able to track and limit their exposure to the quantity that this proxy 
tracks – i.e., surprise. 
 
The FEP and active inference are premised on the technical developments and 
resources of variational inference, which is a technique for complex statistical inference, and 
the Markov blanket formalism, which is a formalism that we use to answer the question: 
What counts as a system? The FEP casts adaptive action as a form of variational 
(approximate Bayesian) inference. The variational methods were originally developed by the 
physicist Richard Feynman is the context of statistical mechanics (Feynman, 1972). Feynman 
developed these methods to get around the problems posed by computationally intractable 
terms that appeared when trying to analytically solve some of the integrals that appeared in 
the statistical mechanics problems he was addressing. Variational inference involves guessing 
the parameters of some target probability density function. To do so, we use a variational 
density – i.e., a probability density or (sub-personal) Bayesian belief – which is essentially a 
guess about the exact form of the distribution we want to approximate. We then use 
variational inference to improve or tune our guess.  

28 
 
 
(The exact mathematical details of variational inference are not the focus of this 
thesis. The best point of entry into the technical literature on variational inference is probably 
the inaugural work by Feynman (1972). Some tutorials exist that explain applications of the 
variational formalism in the active inference formalism (Buckley, Kim, McGregor, & Seth, 
2017). A monograph is currently being prepared to comprehensively present the technical 
developments underwriting the FEP (Friston, in preparation).)  
 
The Markov blanket formalism is central to the FEP in its use for the study of living, 
self-organised systems of systems – and it is a central part of the work in this thesis. This 
formalism was originally proposed by Pearl (1988) in the context of statistical inference. The 
formalism was later taken up, linked to approximate Bayesian (variational) inference, and 
applied to model cognitive systems (Friston, 2012, 2013). In a nutshell, the Markov blanket 
formalism allows one to answer the question – What counts as a system? It thereby provides 
the basis for a formal ontology of living systems, i.e., a theory that answers questions about 
the existence of cognitive systems.  
 
The Markov blanket operationalizes the notion of conditional independence. It gives 
us formal tools to articulate the intuitive notion that, for a system to exist at all as a system, it 
must be endowed with some degree of conditional independence from its embedding 
environment. If this minimal requirement is not met, either the set of things we are 
considering merely dissipates into the environment in which it is embedded – in which case it 
ceases to be the system that it is – or again, the set is not a system in this robust sense, only a 
logical sense (we would not, for instance, speak of a set formed by the climate in Montreal, a 
tree in Central Park, and an ant in Shanghai as a system). Indeed, we (almost never) think of 
these objects as systems because we have something like ‘intuitive feel’ for what should 
count as a thing (Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018). The Markov Blanket formalism is of great help 
to formalise this intuition – especially how it applies to less obvious cases, such as the ones 
that are the focus of this thesis (the mind, multiscale cognitive systems, etc.). 
 
A Markov blanket is a set of states that separate or shield some system of interest 
from its embedding environment. The systemic states thus insulated are known as internal 
states; and the ones from which they are shielded are referred to as external states. The 
blanket itself is made up of sensory and active states, which are also defined in terms of their 
statistical relations; active states are influenced by (but do not directly influence) internal 
states, whereas sensory states are influenced by external states (but, reciprocally, do not 
directly influence them). These relations are captured in Figure 1. 

29 
 
 
Fig. 1. A Markov blanket. Schematic of the quantities that define a Markov blanket and their relations. Here, the 
Markov blanket is depicted, as well as the system that it enshrouds (the internal states) and the external, non-
systemic states. Here, the systemic or internal states, which make up the system in question, are denoted ; and 
the external or hidden states are denoted. The Markov blanket per se is made up of sensory states, which are 
denoted by s , and active states, denoted by a . From chapter 4; Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al. (2019).  
 
 
 
In effect, the Markov blanket establishes the conditional independence that makes a 
system count as a system, i.e., as an integrated whole with well-defined boundaries. This 
separation between internal and external states that is induced by a Markov blanket is meant 
to be read in a statistical sense; in terms of the propagation of effects or influence from one 
set of states to another. The Markov blanket ‘insulates’ internal states from external ones (and 
vice versa) – in the sense that external states are only able to influence internal states in an 
indirect manner, namely, via their action on sensory states; and reciprocally, internal states 
can only affect external ones indirectly, via their effect on active states. Via active inference, 
over time and on average, it will look as if organisms and their ecological niche were 
inferring each other’s states and statistical properties. On the side of the organism, this will 
have the look and feel of action, perception, and learning.   
 
The FEP was originally formulated by my mentor and doctoral supervisor Karl 
Friston as a theory of neuronal processes in the mid-2000s (Friston, 2010; Friston, 2005; 
Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006). It has proved to be an exceptionally powerful, elegant, 
and generative framework for neuroscience research. This might suggest that the FEP is an 
internalist theory of the brain (and nothing more); indeed, many authors have read it to be so 
(Gładziejewski, 2016; Hohwy, 2014, 2016). In the late 2000s, the explanatory scope of the 

30 
 
FEP was progressively extended, albeit within the confines of computational neuroscience – 
from a theory of cortical processes (Friston, 2005) to its articulation as a full account of the 
brain across its different hierarchical levels (Feldman & Friston, 2010; Friston et al., 2006; 
Kiebel, Daunizeau, & Friston, 2008), to a theory of how adaptive action might be controlled 
by the brain (Friston, 2010; Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel, 2010; Friston et al., 2011). 
This integration of action into the mix was crucial, since it showed that the FEP could be 
more than merely a theory of perception and cognition.  
 
More was to come. In a series of landmark papers from 2012 to 2015, the FEP was 
extended from a theory of brain function to a theory of living systems in general. In 2012-
2013, connections between the FEP and the mathematical apparatus of Markov blankets and 
Markov decision processes were drawn (Friston, 2012, 2013). This suggested that the FEP 
could be cast not only as a theory of self-organisation in brains, but more generally as a 
theory of the class of living system (i.e., a theory of life as we can currently understand it). 
By 2015, free-energy minimisation was shown to be sufficient to provide an explanation of 
morphogenesis (that is, cell differentiation). Essentially, via mathematical work and in silico 
proof of principles, it was shown that – with some very simple assumptions in play, the 
discussion of which goes beyond what can be discussed in a brief review of the literature – 
biological self-organisation is an inevitable consequence of the physics and statistical 
structure of system at nonequilibrium steady state. This, in turn, suggested that the FEP was 
sufficient to describe the generic necessary constraints on self-organizing and self-
maintaining systems (Friston, Levin, et al., 2015). Since the modelling work showed that a 
higher-order pattern (the target morphology) could be generated as long as free-energy 
minimisation guided individual components of the system, it was becoming clear that the 
FEP could model systems composed of other systems.  
 
Shortly thereafter, work extending the physics of the FEP showed that the scale 
invariance of the variational free-energy meant that, at least in principle, one could explain 
the dynamics of all the nested systems and their integration across scales (Sengupta et al., 
2016). It was hinted that this could lead to a new take on the study of adaptive behaviour and 
its control (neuroethology) – although the details of this proposal would need to be worked 
out. This is where the work in the present thesis comes into play. As we examine in the next 
main section of this thesis, one of the original contributions of the present work is to 
systematically articulate the project of a variational neuroethology, and to further extend the 
FEP to phenomena beyond the brain.  

31 
 
 
Another aspect of the FEP that had yet to be exploited was its symmetry. Active 
inference tells us both how organisms will adapt to their niches, and how ecological niches 
will slowly change to match the structure of their denizens. Mathematically, the FEP is also a 
story about how organism-niche systems attune themselves to one another; in the sense of 
being statistically informative or predictive of each other, and entailing the same predictive 
consequences. This implicit symmetry is developed in the third chapter of this thesis.   
 
5.1.2. 4E cognition and ecological psychology 
This thesis draws from an extensive and growing externalist literature, which has conducted a 
systematic critique of internalism in quite some detail over the last two decades. The 
theoretical and philosophical work in this literature was crucial to helping extend the FEP 
into a theory of adaptive multiscale dynamics and cognitive ecology. These approaches, 
conducted in the spirit of externalism, fall under the rubric of ‘4E cognition’. The 4 Es in 
question are the ‘embodied’, ‘extended’, ‘embedded’, and ‘enactive’ conceptions of the mind; 
for an overview, see (Kiverstein & Clark, 2009; Newen et al., 2018). Another E that should 
be considered here, and which informs much work in this thesis, stands for ‘ecological 
psychology’ (Chemero, 2009; Gibson, 1979).  
 
5.1.2.1. The embodied mind 
 
The embodied mind is the view that cognitive processes depend on the workings of 
the body; and that information processing is often ‘outsourced’ or ‘offloaded’ to (or, more 
accurately, directly processed by) the morphological and anatomical structure of the body. 
Although there is much heterogeneity in this literature, the fundamental claim is that 
cognitive processes depend on the processes and physical structure of the body for aspects of 
their underlying structure and function. The foundational work in this area is work by 
philosophers and cognitive scientists Gallagher (2006); Noë (2004); Varela et al. (1991).  
 
The least controversial way that this view on cognition has been pursued is the 
suggestion that the dynamic, adaptive actions of cognitive systems can leverage the physical 
structure and processes of the living body to perform cognitive work. Some have cast this as 
‘offloading’ cognition to the morphological structure of the body; but, as my mentor and 
Master’s supervisor Pierre Poirier has pointed out to me in discussions, it is more accurate to 
say that those aspects of cognitive processing that were already done by the body do not have 
to be uploaded to the brain. Indeed, as the brain is more plastic than body, it would be 
surprising if its processes were the ones being offloaded to anything. The structure of the 

32 
 
body itself, in such cases, limits the degrees of freedom required to control and guide 
movement, which allows organisms to save on the metabolic costs of neuronal information 
processing (Turvey, 1990). This is known as morphological computation (Pfeifer & Gómez, 
2009; Pfeifer, Iida, & Gómez, 2006), and inspired a new line of research in robotics, 
premised on the idea that internal representation was not necessary for – at least minimal 
forms of – adaptive behaviour (Brooks, 1991; Chiel & Beer, 1997; Paul, 2006).  
 
The embodied mind also addresses the embodied character of lived experience, 
drawing on phenomenological philosophy (Husserl, 1990; Merleau-Ponty, 2013/1945). Work 
on embodied metaphors suggests that sensorimotor processes – and the basic layout and 
disposition of our bodies when engaged in intentional action – provide a structure that 
scaffolds, and provides the basis from which can develop, more abstract forms of thought and 
experience (Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017; Lakoff & Johnson, 2008). Work on embodied 
cognition has also addressed the ways in which the body is a basis and medium for rich social 
and cultural communication and self-expression (Froese & Di Paolo, 2011).  
 
Historically, the embodiment paradigm was the first E-approach to emerge. The 
embodied mind was a controversial position at the time it was proposed. Indeed, the 
dominant approach to the study of cognition in the late 1980s and 1990s was symbolic 
computationalist cognitivism; namely, the Fodorian view that cognition was mental 
computation, i.e., the rule-based manipulation of mental symbol-like representations (Fodor, 
1975; Fodor, 1983). Varela and colleagues were the first to propose a systematic framework 
to challenge the dominant paradigms of the time (Varela et al., 1991). Today, the embodied 
approach is largely standard textbook material. Indeed, work in robotics has demonstrated the 
utility of the approach (Beer, 1995; Chiel & Beer, 1997).  
 
The relevance of the embodied approach to cognition for the thesis is multifaceted. In 
extending the FEP to phenomena beyond the brain, this thesis essentially espouses the view 
that it is the entire phenotype that engages in cognitive activity. In other words, all the 
processes of the body, whether homeostatic or allostatic, participate in the generation of 
adaptive behaviour.  
 
The first and second chapters of this thesis show how to formulate mathematically the 
claim that the body is involved in the same game as the brain, just at another set of spatial and 
temporal scales. We are essentially providing an information-theoretic framework for the 
embodied mind.  
 
 

33 
 
5.1.2.2. The enactive approach 
 
The embodied mind paradigm dovetails nicely with the enactive approach to living 
systems (Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). The enactive 
approach covers many different (and sometimes even opposed) approaches to cognition. The 
central claim of all brands of enactivism is the pragmatist emphasis on adaptive action: 
meaning is processual (Gallagher, 2006, 2017; Hutto & Myin, 2017; Hutto & Myin, 2013; 
Noë, 2004; Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). In other words, for an organism to make 
sense of itself and its world is a process, and meaning is brought forth into the world through 
patterned loops of adaptive, purposeful action.  
 
The enactive approach coheres broadly with the embodied mind, in that all enactive 
approaches also endorse the view that cognition is embodied – however, there are approaches 
to embodied cognition that reject the radicalism of enactivism. The enactive approach is still 
hotly debated and controversial – and much of this thesis is based on the implications of 
taking it seriously, while pushing back against what transpires today as some of its more 
conservative aspects.  
 
According to the useful typology proposed by philosophers Hutto and Myin (2013), 
there are three main forms of enactivism, to which I and others have added – in part through 
work contained in this thesis – a fourth form. These are: autopoietic, sensorimotor, radical, 
and our novel Bayesian approaches to enactivism. Autopoietic enactivism is a form of 
enactivism that tries to ground the cognitive activities of living organisms in the self-
production (aka autopoiesis) of living organisms (Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). . 
Autopoietic enactivism proposes a theory of the kinds of general system-level features that a 
network of processes must exhibit to be self-creating in this fashion (Di Paolo, Buhrmann, & 
Barandiaran, 2017; Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; see Figure 2). This is also the original 
brand of enactivism, proposed contemporaneously to the embodied mind.  
 

34 
 
 
Fig. 2. Operational closure and autopoiesis. Autopoietic enactivism foregrounds the notions of autopoiesis and 
operational closure. Autopoiesis is defined as the capacity of a system to autonomously generate and maintain 
its component parts and processes, in the face of environmental perturbations. Operational closure is defined as 
the organisational form of the processes that enable autopoietic self-production and the conservation of the 
systemic boundaries via interdependent processes. Modified from Di Paolo and Thompson (2014). 
 
 
 
Sensorimotor enactivism emphasizes the fact that cognitive processing exploits the 
tight coupling between the statistical profile of actions and their sensory consequences – what 
have been dubbed sensorimotor contingencies (Noë, 2004). Radical enactivism pursues the 
claim that ‘the world is its best representation’; i.e., that basic forms of cognition do not 
involve internal representations (Hutto & Myin, 2017; Hutto & Myin, 2013). That is, 
organisms need not reconstruct an internal representation of an external world to guide 
action, but rather can act on the basis of sensorimotor contingencies to guide adaptive action. 
I examine the fourth flavour, Bayesian enactivism, below.  
 
Despite recognising that cognitive systems extend beyond the confines of the brain, 
some of these views remain essentialist; they define the workings of the mind as essentially 
being this or that kind of thing – only now, the locus of explanation has shifted away from the 
brain, towards other factors. The problem with many proposals in the autopoietic, 
sensorimotor, and (especially) radically enactive approaches is that they end up rejecting the 

35 
 
most essential, generative, and productive tools that are available to cognitive scientists, 
namely, computational methods and information theory. This trend in the enactivist literature 
began with work on minimal forms of cognition, in which minimal systems were designed 
that evinced adaptive behaviour but did not require explicit internal representations of an 
external world – and literature that emphasised the dynamic nature of cognition, rejecting the 
metaphor of the brain as a digital computer (Brooks, 1991; Thelen & Smith, 1996; Van 
Gelder, 1998). This criticism has been raised by other 4E theorists, who espouse embodied, 
extended, or embedded cognition, but reject the radical anti-internalism of some enactive 
theorists (Chemero, 2009; Clark, 2015a).  
 
Enactivism was a very progressive position in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, 
many of the questions that concerned enactive theorists (namely, “Is cognition a form of 
computation?”) have been rendered moot by the development of computational neuroscience. 
Computational neuroscience is the use of computational methods and information theory to 
model the dynamics of cognitive systems. Whereas the first generation of enactivist theory, 
formulated in the 1990s and early 2000s, was concerned with showing that cognition was not 
merely symbolic or digital computation, computational neuroscience employs computational 
methods as tools to investigate the behaviour of cognitive systems – and does not (or at least, 
not automatically) come pre-packaged with metaphysical assumptions about the 
computational nature of cognition. Admittedly, some of the writing in this tradition speaks of 
‘neural computation’ (Piccinini, 2015); but often the use is deflationary, and stands as a 
shorthand to express the way patterns of information are structured and restructured by 
cognitive processes and action (Bruineberg, Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016; Kirchhoff & 
Robertson, 2018). 
 
5.1.2.3. Extended and embedded (and extensive) cognition 
Extended cognition and embedded cognition are two versions of roughly the same claim, 
namely, that elements external to the boundary of the skull or skin can participate in 
cognition. Extended cognition is the claim that cognitive processes extend literally out into 
the environment, such that environmental parameters can be counted as part of the realization 
base of cognitive processes (Clark, 2008). On this view, the boundaries of cognitive systems 
are not constrained by the boundary of the skull.  
 
Embedded cognition is the (much less radical) claim that cognitive processes do not 
literally extend out into the world, such that the boundaries of cognitive systems would 
extend to elements in the environment, but rather that cognitive processes merely recruit 

36 
 
components that extend their innate, intrinsic information processing capacities and provide 
them with abilities they wouldn’t otherwise have (Rupert, 2004, 2009). For the purposes of 
this thesis, we will not delve into this distinction, and will speak of extended cognition to 
cover both families of theories. The foundational papers on extended cognition is work by 
philosophers Clark (2008) and Clark and Chalmers (1998); see Adams and Aizawa (2001); 
Adams and Aizawa (2009); Adams and Aizawa (2010) for a critique.  
 
Extensive cognition is the newest of the E approaches that I review. It was proposed 
by philosophers Dan Hutto, Michael Kirchhoff, Erik Myin, and Julian Kiverstein (Hutto, 
Kirchhoff, & Myin, 2014; for a closely related discussion, see Kirchhoff & Kiverstein, 2019). 
Work in this thesis builds on the notion of extensive cognition. This is the view that the 
boundaries of cognitive systems are not fixed once and for all, but rather are negotiated 
dynamically and are open to change. On this view, the extended and embedded mind start 
from a false assumption; namely, that cognition is something that initially is confined within 
the organism or the brain, and that needs to be extended into the world. Proponents of 
extensive cognition instead argue that cognition starts out as an enactive or pragmatic 
engagement with the world. It is only in fairly recently evolved creatures like ourselves, and 
in animals capable of ‘offline’ cognition (i.e., thinking about states of affairs that do not 
currently obtain) that thinking becomes internalised as such (Hutto et al., 2014; Kirchhoff & 
Kiverstein, 2019). On this view, which is in some ways continuous with (but less extreme 
than) radical enactivism, it is only through the process of enculturation that cognitive 
processes acquire content (that is, becomes subject to truth or satisfaction conditions) – and 
thereby can be said to represent states of the world (Hutto et al., 2014). 
 
While the extensive approach to cognition is important to the theoretical framework 
that is developed in the fourth chapter, another approach to the way cognition involves the 
world arguably had a greater influence on my work – namely, ecological psychology.  
 
5.1.2.4. Ecological psychology 
Ecological psychology theory is continuous with many of the desiderata of the enactive 
approach, but predates them by quite some time. Ecological psychology is a research 
program in psychology that begins with a critique of the starting point of much of the 
cognitive sciences; namely, the assumption of poverty of stimulus. It relies on the construct 
of affordances, proposed by Gibson (1979) – which can be cast as a corrective to the 
assumption of the poverty of stimulus (Anderson, 2017). Chomsky (1965) conjectured that 
infants were not exposed to a rich enough stimulus to learn language. This ‘poverty of 

37 
 
stimulus’ claim was used to argue that, since the stimulus was poor in information, stimuli 
needed to be augmented via the resources of an internal mental model or representation.  
 
Contrariwise, Gibson argued that the stimuli to which the organism is exposed are 
extremely rich, when we consider their dynamics – that is, the way they unfold over time. On 
this view, the isolated, point-like stimulus or sense datum is an unrealistic idealization; in 
reality, sensory surfaces are dynamically exposed to the environment. The relevant patterns 
of stimulation that are directly readable from the sensory array of organisms carry 
information that can be leveraged to guide adaptive behaviour; these patterns are called 
affordances in classical, Gibsonian ecological psychology.  
 
In recent years, Gibson’s original sensory-perceptual concept has been transformed 
and broadened – perhaps to the chagrin of some ecological psychologists (Heras-Escribano, 
2019a, 2019b), who disagree that such a conceptual shift is consistent with Gibson’s original 
formulation of affordances. Although the new construct admittedly bears little resemblance to 
Gibson’s original one, its usefulness for our purposes is significant. Under the impetus of 
work from cognitive scientists and philosophers – such as Chemero (2009), Bruineberg and 
Rietveld (2014), and Rietveld and Kiverstein (2014) – affordances have been redefined more 
broadly as possibilities for action in the environment. Chemero (2009) was the first to 
propose to ground enactive theory on the well-established results of ecological psychology. 
Affordances, on this view, are interactional properties between the abilities had by agents and 
the relevant features of their shared material environment.  
 
This thesis draws on a recent synthesis of ecological psychology with the enactive 
approach and the free-energy principle, called the skilled intentionality framework (SIF) 
(Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; van Dijk & Rietveld, 2016). Building on previous work 
bridging ecological and enactive perspectives Chemero (2009), the SIF uses the resources of 
enactivism and ecological psychology to suggest that organisms engage with a field of 
affordances, specified in terms of salient environment features and the abilities with which 
organisms are endowed. The perspectives of ecological psychology, and the SIF in particular, 
loom large in this thesis.  
 
There are two main blind spots in this literature, which this thesis attempts to address. 
The first, which arises when the SIF is applied to species such as humans, which exist in 
complex social and cultural niches, is the question of how best to approach affordances that 
are particular to a given culture. Promising work had been accomplished in this direction 
(Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014), but was not yet brought into contact with new work in 
cognitive and evolutionary anthropology on culture-gene coevolution (Henrich, 2015) and the 

38 
 
cooperative nature of human phenotypes (Hrdy, 2011; Tomasello, 2014). The first chapter of 
this thesis extends the SIF via this body of work, to provide an account of specifically 
cultural affordances and their mechanistic basis.  
 
Another central limitation of ecological approaches, as originally formulated by 
Gibson (1979), is the lack of a mechanistic theory to explain how organisms engage with 
affordances. Follow up work (Chemero, 2009) remediates this by integrating ecological 
psychology with embodied and enactive conception of mind. Newer work has suggested that 
Bayesian approaches to cognition might be apt to ground affordances mechanistically (Clark, 
2015b). This thesis further remediates this lack of a mechanistic basis by providing a 
variational physics of affordances, in the second and third chapters.  
 
5.1.3. Culture-gene coevolution, shared attention, and the cooperative turn in cognitive 
and evolutionary anthropology 
Work on human cultural dynamics in this thesis, and especially in the first chapter, rests on 
new developments in cognitive and evolutionary anthropology that foreground (1) the fact 
that human culture and human genetics have coevolved and (2) the manners in which 
collective allocations of attention and salience pattern the ways in which human agents are 
enculturated. Indeed, the first chapter is an attempt to integrate these novel findings and 
frameworks with the bodies of literature just reviewed, in order to propose a novel account of 
human cultural action and cognition informed by the most recent developments in cognitive 
and evolutionary anthropology, broadly construed. When I met him in 2015, my mentor, 
close friend, and collaborator Professor Samuel Veissière had been working on the ways in 
which patterned allocations of attention that were relevant to understanding human culture, 
and on the question of culture-gene coevolution. Professor Veissière’s work informs the first 
chapter of this thesis greatly. 
 
Concerning the first part, this thesis mainly draws from the work of evolutionary 
biologists and evolutionary anthropologists such as Joseph Henrich (Henrich, 2015; Moya & 
Henrich, 2016) and Sarah Hrdy (Hrdy, 2011), who examine the manner in which human 
cultures emerged from deep historical processes rooted in human biology. This thesis as a 
whole also draws heavily the work of my mentor and doctoral supervisor, psychiatrist 
Laurence Kirmayer (Kirmayer, 2008; Kirmayer, 2015; Kirmayer & Bhugra, 2009; Kirmayer 
& Gold, 2012). These theorists claim that human biology is fundamentally shaped by culture; 
and that, reciprocally, human culture cannot be understood without understanding its 
anchoring in human biology. The work of Professor Kirmayer also draws on embodied and 

39 
 
enactive approaches to the cognitive sciences, making this approach even more amenable to 
the aims of my thesis.  
 
The framework that is leveraged in the first chapter for thinking about the effects of 
shared attention on sociality and culture find their origin are so-called ‘relevance models’ of 
cultural cognition. These models, building on the work of Grice (1989), emphasise that 
human cognition mostly proceeds on a ‘scan and stop’ basis: human agents secure cues that 
indicate high reliability information, and stop thinking once such cues are secured (Wilson & 
Sperber, 2002, 2012). These models are broadly consonant and complementary to other, more 
theoretically-oriented work in anthropology, focusing on the relations between the public 
order and the ways that enculturation fashions our patterns of attention; namely, the theories 
of civic inattention of Erving Goffman (1971) and the construct of habitus from the work of 
Pierre Bourdieu (1977, 1984). More recent work on this comes from psychologist Michael 
Tomasello (2014), who emphasises the role of the joint and shared forms of attention in 
human development. For instance, Tomasello notes that the education of human infants 
almost invariably involves situations where parental figures share a common attentional 
object with their child, which plays a critical role in their development.  
 
This thesis mainly uses this body of literature to correct conceptions of human culture 
in other bodies of literature that are drawn upon – rather than criticize its lacunae directly. In 
particular, the embodied-enactive conception of mind tends to be very thin in its treatment of 
social and cultural phenomena – with a few notable exceptions (Fabry, 2017; Gallagher & 
Ransom, 2016; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). Even when they do examine culture in detail, 
however, the new developments just reviewed are seldom taken into account. We correct this 
situation in the model that we propose in the first chapter, which guides subsequent 
investigations.  
 
5.1.4. Bayesian enactivism and enactive inference: The enactive approach meets active 
inference 
There has been a growing intersection of the two first bodies of literature just reviewed; more 
specifically, at the intersection of the FEP and embodied, enactive, and ecological approaches 
to the dynamics of cognitive systems. The first paper to propose such a convergence was 
Bruineberg and Rietveld (2014). They proposed an integrated model combining aspects from 
ecological psychology, the enactive approach, and the FEP. Karl Friston, along with 
philosophers and cognitive scientists Michael Kirchhoff, Tom Froese, Shaun Gallagher, 
Micah Allen, and Michael Anderson followed up these ideas in a series of recent papers on 

40 
 
the relations between the FEP and the commitments of autopoietic variants of enactivism, 
arguing that the FEP absorbs, explains, or supersedes autopoiesis (Allen & Friston, 2016; 
Anderson, 2017; Gallagher & Allen, 2016; Kirchhoff, 2016; Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017).  
 
My thesis work exemplifies and extends this approach. Indeed, the papers collected in 
this thesis propose a novel, Bayesian form of enactivism. Bayesian enactivism is an 
articulation of enactivism for the age of computational neuroscience. Its relation to the other 
forms of enactivism is as follows: Bayesian enactivism extends sensorimotor enactivism by 
showing what kind of minimal cognitive information processing machinery is necessary for 
the intelligent engagement with sensorimotor contingencies (Anderson, 2017; Engel et al., 
2016). Bayesian enactivism absorbs or supersedes autopoietic enactivism in that it provides 
an explanation from first principles of the construct that was its basis; namely, we provide an 
explanation for the autopoiesis of living systems via active inference and Markov blankets. 
Bayesian enactivism rejects radical enactivism as, perhaps ironically, being too conservative; 
it foregoes the most powerful tools available in the cognitive sciences for the sake of 
ideological purity.  
 
In rejecting the tools that made internalism a powerful paradigm for neuroscience 
research, radical externalists were depriving themselves of some truly revolutionary new 
theories and tools. Some of the most interesting and powerful tools to study the mind were 
originally developed in an internalist explanatory setting; e.g., information theoretic tools for 
statistical analysis and computational modelling. This thesis aims to advocate methodological 
pluralism as well, premised on the ontological pluralism that follows from a radically 
multiscale approach to the study of cognitive systems.  
 
The final chapter of this thesis proposes a novel reading of embodiment and 
enactment predicated on the FEP. The idea that is proposed rests on the construct of 
generative models from the variational formulation. We propose an interpretation of 
enactment as the bringing about of the phenotypic states (i.e., the enactment of a generative 
model) and of embodiment as the encoding of a variational model, or best guess. We thus 
integrate enactive, embodied, and ecological views on cognitive systems via a multiscale 
articulation of the FEP.  
 
5.2. Contemporaries and closely related work 
It should be acknowledged that the ideas and original contributions made in this thesis 
explicitly draw on recent work by philosophers Jelle Bruineberg, Axel Constant, Tom Froese, 
Michael Kirchhoff, Julian Kiverstein, and Erik Rietveld. Some of the work presented here 

41 
 
converged on similar results with work by these authors. This is not surprising. Almost all of 
us have, at one point or another, worked at University College London with the Theoretical 
Neurobiology group directed by Professor Karl Friston, who first proposed the FEP a decade 
ago. Indeed, in many cases, Professor Friston introduced us to each other. 
 
This work builds on the pioneering work of McGill researchers Laurence Kirmayer 
and Samuel Veissière. Professor Kirmayer blazed the path for a cultural neuro-
phenomenological approach to the study of mind and mental health, which was the main 
inspiration for this doctoral project. This thesis would not have been possible without his 
influence – and indeed, without his help. Professor Veissière first introduced the notion of 
cultural affordances that we use in the first chapter in talks and seminars from 2014-2015, 
which had a profound effect on me. Professor Veissière also was the first to theorize the role 
of regimes of attention, as we employ the construct, in his novel work on internet subcultures 
circa 2015 (Veissière, 2015, 2016).    
 
This thesis is indebted to, and draws heavily on, the work of philosopher Jelle 
Bruineberg. Bruineberg and his collaborators at the University of Amsterdam, Professor Erik 
Rietveld and Professor Julian Kiverstein, were, in 2014, the first to propose an integrative 
framework combining enactive and embodied approaches to cognition, ecological 
psychology, and the free-energy principle – the SIF, which we reviewed above. This thesis is 
deeply indebted to their pioneering work. As we state in the second chapter, the variational 
ecology that is proposed there integrates the SIF with the variational neuroethology presented 
in the first chapter and the variational approach to niche construction.  
 
Work in this thesis is deeply indebted to my close friend and collaborator, the 
cognitive scientist and philosopher Axel Constant. We developed the variational approach to 
niche construction during his MA studies (Constant, Ramstead, Veissière, Campbell, & 
Friston, 2018), which he undertook under the supervision of Sander van de Cruys and Maren 
Wehrle at the Catholic University of Leuven. The variational approach to niche construction 
– that we developed based on pioneering work by Jelle Bruineberg in 2017 and 2018 – was 
one of the central components of the work that would lead to the development of the 
variational ecology that is presented in the third chapter of this thesis. The third chapter 
integrates the variational neuroethology, which I developed in 2017 and 2018 with Paul 
Badcock and Karl Friston, with the variational approach to niche construction, to provide a 
fully generalizable framework for modelling living, cognitive systems interacting with their 
ecological niches across scales – the variational ecology. 

42 
 
 
Philosophers Michael Kirchhoff and Tom Froese were the first theorists in the 
enactive approach to systematically explore the relation between the free-energy principle 
and the Markov blanket formalism and the commitments of the enactive approach. It should 
be noted that Kirchhoff was involved independently in research on nested Markov blankets, 
around the same time that I was working through the implications of multiscale modelling of 
adaptive action and cognition via the nested Markov blankets formalism with Paul Badcock 
and Karl Friston, circa 2016-2017. Kirchhoff’s research visit at University College London 
allowed him and his colleagues to approach the question of nested Markov blankets from the 
point of view of generative models and their relation to phenotypes – as opposed to 
approaching it from the question of spatial and temporal scales, which was our starting point. 
Our results, and the resulting philosophical perspectives, have converged. We have since 
become friends and collaborators. Kirchhoff is the second author on the last chapter of this 
thesis.

6. Contribution to original knowledge 
The main original contribution to knowledge made by this thesis, which is taken up over all 
four chapters that make it up, is twofold: (1) the proposal of novel theoretical frameworks – 
and, in some chapters, of corresponding mathematical models – to study cognitive systems, 
especially humans and human societies, at and across all the spatial and temporal scales at 
which they exist; and (2) the consideration of the implications of these multiscale models for 
the debate in the philosophy of science over where to draw the boundaries of cognitive 
systems. The thesis leverages the FEP, embodied-enactive-extended approaches in the 
cognitive sciences, and ecological psychology to formulate three new theoretical frameworks 
for multidisciplinary research on multiscale systems in the cognitive sciences, called the 
cultural affordances framework, variational neuroethology, and variational ecology.  
 
The novel contribution of these frameworks is to enable those working in the 
cognitive sciences (1) to model, and indeed explain from first principles, the cognitive 
dynamics of living systems beyond the scale of the brain – from cells the societies; and (2) to 
provide a theoretical scaffold to enable novel, multidisciplinary research in the cognitive 
sciences. Having established these theoretical results, the thesis then attempts to draw on 
them to dissolve the very terms in which the debate is posed in the philosophy of the 
cognitive sciences between internalism and externalism. The thesis shows that internalist and 
externalist approaches both err in their essentialism about the boundaries of cognitive 
systems; and it celebrates a pluralistic approach to the ontology and study of cognitive 
systems. More specifically, this thesis makes four main original contributions to knowledge: 
 
6.1. A multiscale perspective on the study of human sociocultural action and cognition, 
via a cultural reading of affordances: The cultural affordances framework 
The first chapter, “Cultural affordances: Scaffolding local worlds through shared 
intentionality and regimes of attention,” was published in Frontiers in Psychology (Ramstead 
et al., 2016). It was written in 2015-2016 and constitutes my first attempt to work out a 
multiscale perspective on nested cognitive systems; in this case, perhaps the most interesting 
such systems, human sociocultural groups. More specifically, the chapter provides a 
multiscale perspective on the problems posed by the acquisition of cultural norms, values, 
and practices.  
 
The chapter synthesises much of the extant literature on human cultural learning and 
proposes a tractable mechanism to explain human enculturation. The chapter revolves around 
the construct of affordances, which we borrow from ecological psychology. An affordance is 

44 
 
a possibility for engagement with the environment – it is a relational feature that binds an 
organism to its environment. One of the novel contributions of this chapter is to articulate a 
framework to theoretically approach the kinds of affordances that populate the human 
ecological niche, which we call ‘cultural affordances.’  
 
The mechanism that we propose in this chapter integrates causal factors that are 
internal to the organism, notably, brain-based mechanisms of prediction and attentional 
modulation; as well as factors external to it, namely, the immersive participation of an agent 
in patterned cultural practices. The mechanism is depicted in Figure 3.  
 
 
Fig. 3. A diagram of the mechanism that enables the learning of cultural affordances. What we call ‘regimes of 
attention’ are the patterned cultural practices that guide agents to attend to this rather than that. The model draws 
on the free-energy principle and in particular in the way that attention is theorized in that model. Under the free-
energy principle, attention has the function of gating or modulating the deployment by agents of perception-
action loops. By directing attentional processes, regimes of attention end up enculturating agents with the 
predictive expectations that enable enculturation in a given a sociocultural group. From Ramstead, Veissière, & 
Kirmayer (2016).  
 
 

45 
 
The claim is that humans become attuned to the cultural affordances of their sociocultural 
niche thanks to the patterning of attention that is made possible by immersive participation in 
certain kinds of patterned cultural practices, which we call ‘regimes of attention’. A regime of 
attention is a practice that signals the salience (or lack thereof) of certain kinds of stimuli and 
situations. The interaction between regimes of attention and brain-based mechanisms enable 
the attunement to cultural affordances. The cultural affordances model thus provides a 
multiscale framework for the study of human social and cultural cognition. 
 
6.2. An articulation of the FEP beyond the brain: Variational neuroethology and 
variational ecology 
One of the main contributions of this thesis is to extend the FEP – which was developed as a 
unified theory of the brain – to systems beyond the brain, and to show that the FEP provides 
the cognitive sciences with the formal mathematical framework required to articulate an 
integrated, multi-scale perspective from which to study living systems that exist across 
multiple spatial and temporal scales. This is realised especially in the last three chapters. The 
two middle chapters (the second and third chapters) provide the technical results required to 
accomplish this extension, and the third discusses the broader philosophical implications of 
this extension.  
 
The second chapter, called “Answering Schrödinger’s question: A free-energy 
formulation,” is a review paper that was published in the journal Physics of Life Reviews 
(Ramstead et al., 2018a) with 14 peer commentaries (Allen, 2018; Bellomo & Elaiw, 2018; 
Bitbol & Gallagher, 2018; Bruineberg & Hesp, 2018; Campbell, 2018; Daunizeau, 2018; 
Kirchhoff, 2018; Kirmayer, 2018; Leydesdorff, 2018; Martyushev, 2018; Pezzulo & Levin, 
2018; Tozzi & Peters, 2018; Van de Cruys, 2018; Veissière, 2018). We were invited to write 
a response (Ramstead et al., 2018b) as well.  
 
“Answering Schrödinger’s question: A free-energy formulation” explicitly addresses 
the question of nested temporal and spatial scales, and is the first paper in the literature to 
argue that the FEP can systematically be used to articulate a theory of adaptive behaviour that 
can explain the dynamics of cognitive systems across all the scales at which they exist. It 
proposes a novel synthesis to study the adaptive behaviour of nested systems of systems. It 
does this by drawing on some of the most influential models in theoretical biology from 
evolutionary systems theory (EST) (Depew & Weber, 1995; Fisher, 1930; Kauffman, 1993; 
Sarkar, 1992; Wright, 1932). EST is a synthetic discipline that studies the intersection of self-
organisation and generalised selection (of which natural selection is just one subtype) 

46 
 
processes in the biological sciences. The most crucial of these frameworks for our purposes is 
Tinbergen’s four seminal research questions (Tinbergen, 1963) – i.e., mechanism, ontogeny, 
phylogeny, and function – which we combine with the FEP.  
 
More specifically, the main contribution to original knowledge of the first chapter is 
the proposal of a new approach to the study of adaptive behaviour and its control in nested 
living systems called variational neuroethology (VNE). As a framework, VNE has two main 
components: (1) a multi-scale ontology of nested cognitive systems (i.e., systems of systems); 
as well as (2) a multidisciplinary research heuristic to study the behaviour of nested cognitive 
systems. Neuroethology is the study of the evolution and dynamics of animal behaviour and 
their associated control systems (i.e., their brains). VNE builds on the FEP and on 
Tinbergen’s four seminal research questions in biology to propose a fully generalizable 
framework to study adaptive behaviour at and across spatial and temporal scales. The original 
theoretical development of this chapter is to articulate a theoretical model, accompanying 
mathematical formalism, and multidisciplinary research heuristic to enable cognitive 
scientists to model nested cognitive systems; that is, to model the dynamics of systems that 
are themselves made of other systems (e.g., cells that are nested in tissues, themselves nested 
in organisms, embedded in a shared ecological niche).  
 
The central contribution of the second chapter to the theoretical framework of the FEP 
is to show that any living system can be described as recursively nested Markov blankets; 
that is, Markov blankets of Markov blankets – all the way up, and all the way down. The 
crucial observation that underwrites this development is that the components of Markov 
blankets are themselves systems, which means they also must have a Markov blanket; and the 
interactions between blankets induce a sparsity structure that leads to blankets of blankets. 
This recursively nested structure of blankets is depicted in Figure 4, below. The main 
theoretical contribution of the first paper is to theoretically unpack this nested structure of 
systems of systems.  
 

47

specifically, the figure illustrates how to move from one scale of Markov blankets, with its blanket states (

and internal states (
( )i


), to the next. See the second and third chapters for technical details. From chapter 3; 
(Ramstead, Constant, et al., 2019)  
 
 
 
The third paper in this thesis, “Variational ecology and the physics of sentient 
systems,” is a follow-up paper – a direct sequel to the first chapter (Ramstead, Constant, et 
al., 2019). The contribution to original knowledge of the second chapter is to propose a new 
approach to cognitive ecological dynamics, the variational ecology (VE), to answer the 
question of how to draw the boundaries of cognitive system beyond the organismic scale. VE 
embeds the systems studied by VNE (i.e., multiply nested, adaptively behaving cognitive 
systems) in a broader ecological context. This move was central to the development of a fully 
generalisable model of explanation in the cognitive sciences for studying multiscale systems 
of systems.

6.3. Moving beyond the debate between internalism and externalism: Rejection of 
essentialism about the boundaries of cognitive systems in the cognitive sciences 
The fourth and final chapter of this thesis, “Multiscale integration: Beyond internalism and 
externalism,” is published in Synthese (Ramstead, Kirchhoff, et al., 2019). It develops the 
philosophical implications of the theoretical construction of the first chapter and the technical 
results of second and third chapters, to provide a philosophical framework to ground and 
justify the multiscale, multidisciplinary frameworks exemplified by the first chapter – 
bringing my project full circle, as it were.  
 
More specifically, building on the contributions of the previous chapters, the fourth 
chapter argues that the multiscale active inference framework can be used to dissolve a 
traditional distinction in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences – that between externalism 
and internalism. The aim of the final chapter is to show that the multiscale articulation of the 
FEP licences us to reject essentialist interpretations of the boundaries of cognition, and allows 
us to move beyond the debate between internalists and externalists.  
 
Essentialism, here, is used in a specific technical sense – one that we have introduced 
in the literature via work in this paper. It is worth noting, of course, that our use is somewhat 
different from the usual sense of essentialism used in philosophy. Typically, an essentialist 
conception of some category or type of thing – e.g., philosophical types such as agency or 
intentionality – is one that associates with that type necessary and sufficient conditions, 
which determine whether some given thing should be classified as belonging to or being 
subsumed under that category.  
 
In the third chapter, we apply the concept of essentialism to the debate between 
internalists and externalists in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences. This debate concerns 
the boundaries of cognitive systems; i.e., what counts as a cognitive system and what does 
not, and where to draw the relevant boundaries. Essentialism, on the reading we are 
employing here, is the position according to which cognitive systems are defined essentially 
relative to some specific type of boundary. 
 
Internalist interpretations of the boundaries of cognition are those that claim that the 
only relevant factors for cognition are to be found inside the organism, and typically, they 
identify the most or only salient boundary as that of the skull. The philosopher Jakob Hohwy, 
for instance, a prominent defender of internalism, has claimed that the mind begins and ends 
at the spinal cord (Hohwy, 2014, 2016). Externalist positions endorse the view that cognition 
necessarily involves causal factors that extend beyond the boundary of the skull. These critics 
of the internalist view mainly operate under the umbrella of the ‘4E approach’ to cognition 

49 
 
and ecological psychology. The philosophers Dan Hutto and Erik Myin, for instance, 
advocate an ‘Equal Partners Principle’ according to which the brain, the body, and the 
environment all contribute meaningfully and equally to the cognitive performances of living 
systems (Hutto & Myin, 2013). Though it is clearly more amenable to a multiscale view than 
internalism, most work on externalist approaches ends up endorsing an essentialist position.  
 
Consider for instance the following characterisations of cognition from externalist 
philosophers. Proponents of embodied cognition make claims that sometimes sound 
essentialist, for instance when it is claimed that cognition “is not simply a brain event. It 
emerges from a process distributed across brain–body–environment… from a third person-
perspective the organism–environment is taken as the explanatory unit” (Gallagher, 2017, p. 
6). Proponents of the enactive approach make similar claims, for instance that cognition “is 
behavior or conduct in relation to meaning and norms that the system itself enacts or brings 
forth on the basis of its autonomy” (Thompson, 2010, p. 126); or that “there is not a priori 
reason to suppose that cognition is an exclusively heady affair [i.e., a processes realised 
within the brain]… cognition is fully embodied and embedded, and not merely embrained” 
(Hutto & Myin, 2013, p. 12). These seem like strong positions that define cognition 
essentially relative to a set of ‘external’ boundaries, i.e., those of the living body or those of 
the intentionally acting organism.  
 
Against both internalism and externalism, the final chapter of this thesis proposes to 
reject all forms of essentialism. We leverage variational neuroethology and variational 
ecology to stake out a compromise position between (what we take to be) the overly coarse 
distinction, and false dichotomy, between internalism and externalism. We argue that the 
Markov blanket formalism licences a conception of the boundaries of cognition as: nested, in 
that most of the interesting cognitive systems studied in the cognitive sciences are composed 
of other cognitive systems; multiple, in that there will always be a plurality of relevant 
boundaries at play in any analysis of adaptive behaviour, namely, the boundaries of all the 
relevant nested Markov blanketed systems; and interest-relative, in that the most relevant 
boundary to study some cognitive process will vary as a function of the explanatory interests 
of cognitive scientists. This chapter is the first to do so via a discussion of the Markov blanket 
formalism that underwrites the FEP.  
 
Furthermore, the model of explanation that is developed in this thesis does not merely 
tell us that the boundaries of cognitive systems are nested, multiple, and interest-relative; it 
provides us with a principled explanation of why the relevant boundaries are relevant. On the 
account presented here, a given boundary is relevant only to the extent that it mediates the 

50 
 
statistical dependencies between the system of interest and the systems with which it 
interacts. This allows us to determine which boundaries are the most pragmatically relevant 
to explain a given cognitive process. Since conditional independence is measurable, it 
effectively becomes possible to determine empirically which of boundaries are the most 
relevant, which provides a way of correcting internalist and externalist essentialism about the 
boundaries of cognitive systems.  
 
The theoretical and mathematical models developed in the first three chapters were 
guided by work in philosophy, and also by theoretical work in philosophically-informed 
cognitive sciences. They leverage the FEP to show that and how one can work from a 
perspective that is able to produce bona fide models of multiscale phenomena; and provide a 
case study in multiscale modelling, applied to sociocultural cognition, action, and learning. 
Thus, in these chapters, it is primarily philosophical work that informs and extends the 
theoretical models that underwrite the FEP to phenomena beyond the brain. In the final 
chapter, the theoretical results obtained in the first three chapters feed back, as it were, into 
philosophical work in the narrower sense, where they are used to dispel the false dichotomy 
between internalism and externalism – and indeed, to dispel all essentialist conceptions of the 
boundaries of cognition.  
 
6.4. Enactivism 2.0. or Bayesian enactivism 
All three papers that form this thesis propose a new take on what has been called ‘pragmatist’ 
or ‘enactive’ cognitive sciences (Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Engel et al., 2016; Froese & 
Di Paolo, 2011; Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). Pragmatist or enactive cognitive 
sciences defend the claim that cognition is mostly (indeed, some might say almost 
exclusively) in the service of action; i.e., the claim that function of the brain is to guide 
contextually appropriate forms of adaptive behaviour.  
 
As discussed above, the cardinal concepts of the enactive approach are embodiment 
and enactment (Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). Both of these ideas find their origin in 
the philosophical work of phenomenological philosophers that were interested in the living 
body, understood both as a physical thing that is part of the natural world – what German 
phenomenologists called Körper – and as a permanent feature of first-person 
phenomenological experience, the lived body or Leib (Husserl, 1990; Merleau-Ponty, 
2013/1945). In brief, embodiment is the idea that the body and its dynamics in motion 
irreducibly feature in most (if not all) cognitive processes; as a physical thing, it structures the 
flow of perception and cognitive processes, which borrow from it its stability and structure; 

51 
 
and as a feature of conscious experience, it provides the raw material for the structuring of 
higher-order forms of thought.  
 
Enactment is an idea drawn from pragmatism (James, 1975) and phenomenological 
philosophy (Heidegger, 2010/1927; Merleau-Ponty, 2013/1945), applied to the study of 
cognitive systems. Essentially, enactment is the process by which organisms actively make 
sense of their worlds through a process of interpretation or sense-making that irreducibly 
involves embodied action in the world. Meaning for organisms, on this view, is not some 
static thing that just needs to be ‘picked up’ by the organism; perception is not just a question 
of internally reconstructing a prespecified external world. Rather, meaning is something that 
is brought forth by the organism, through its active interpretation of the world and, crucially, 
through its patterns of adaptive action and perception. Thus, on this view, cognition is 
essentially the embodied activity of an organism. Much work in enactive theory has consisted 
in articulating the claim that seemingly disembodied activities like dreaming (Solomonova & 
Sha, 2016) and abstract or metaphorical thought (Barsalou, 1999, 2008) have their basis or 
are grounded in embodied activity.  
 
The multiscale view proposed in this thesis critically reframes the enactive approach. 
Proponents of enactive cognitive sciences have had a very narrow understanding of 
information processing and of the place of computational methods in the cognitive sciences 
(Hutto & Myin, 2013; Thompson, 2010). This position was a productive stance at one point 
in the history of the cognitive sciences – i.e., during the late 1980s and 1990s, in the heyday 
of symbolic computational approaches to the study of cognition (Fodor, 1975; Fodor, 1983). 
Indeed, it led to an entirely new, externalist research paradigm for the cognitive sciences, 
which dominated the field from the 1990s onwards, to become one of the main approaches in 
the cognitive sciences today – what has become known as 4E approaches in the cognitive 
sciences (Clark, 2008; Clark & Chalmers, 1998; Kiverstein & Clark, 2009; Varela et al., 
1991). These approaches largely rejected of the digital computer metaphor and the embrace 
of a picture of the brain as a dynamical system.  
 
The series of papers in this thesis represents one of the first systematic attempts to 
bridge the more externalist perspectives of enactive-embodied-extended cognitive sciences 
and ecological psychology, and the originally more internalist leaning of the FEP. We 
propose a compromise position between internalism and externalism, essentially using tools 
developed in the context of a theory of the brain (the FEP and active inference) to advance an 
agenda compatible with the externalist emphasis on embodied activity and ecological 
embeddedness. The papers in this thesis, and especially the last three chapters, propose a 

52 
 
novel reading of embodiment and enactment that relies on their role in information 
processing – and thus reject the externalist move against information theory in the cognitive 
sciences. We claim that externalist theory has, as it were, thrown away the information baby 
with the computation and representation bathwater; and that the resources of information 
theory, computational modelling, and the FEP that emerges from its application to Markov 
blanketed systems, is – despite its internalist appearances – a great boon to enactive or 
pragmatist theories.  
 
One of the contributions of the third chapter in this regard is to redefine affordances, 
providing ecological psychology with a mechanistic foundation based in theoretical biology. 
Crucially, the third paper extends the work done in the first paper by offering a new take on 
the construct of affordances, originally drawn from ecological psychology. Following recent 
work that syntheses ecological psychology and the enactive approach (Bruineberg & 
Rietveld, 2014; Chemero, 2009), as well as recent advances in the theory of active inference 
(Friston, Rigoli, et al., 2015; Parr & Friston, 2017), we redefine affordances via the FEP. 
Thanks to the framework provided by active inference, we distinguish the action policy itself 
– i.e., the possibilities for action that are available to the organism – and the affordance of 
that policy, which we interpret as the degree to which an organism is compelled to enact a 
policy. Under this reading, affordance is no longer construed as a possibility for action – that 
construct is instead resorbed under or subsumed by the notion of an action policy – but 
instead quantifies the extent to which an organism will be compelled to follow a given action 
policy. This gives us a mechanistic, quantitative grip on what the SIF calls ‘solicitations’; i.e., 
those affordances that – ‘here and now’, in real-time interactions with the ecological niche – 
solicit the organism to act (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). We quantify the affordance of a 
given action policy as the negative expected free-energy associated with a given action 
policy. This allows us to propose a principle of most affordance that is just another form of 
the principle of least action, and which follows directly from the FEP. This principle of most 
affordance is another contribution to original knowledge made by this thesis.  
 
In summary, this thesis contributes to the emerging body of work that interprets the 
FEP and active inference through an enactivist or pragmatist lens. Most of the philosophical 
literature on active inference is centred on the role of the brain in perception and action 
(Clark, 2013, 2015b; Hohwy, 2014, 2016, 2017; Kiefer & Hohwy, 2017); the literature 
presents an active inference story that privileges causal factors internal to the organism in the 
explanation of its adaptive behaviour (neural dynamics) – and that does not foreground action 
or embodiment. The papers in this thesis make the claim that the active inference framework 

53 
 
is continuous with pragmatist and enactive cognitive sciences, building on work by Jelle 
Bruineberg in particular (Bruineberg, 2017; Bruineberg et al., 2016; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 
2014). We show that active inference is a theory of action policy selection; it is about how 
organisms select the actions with the most adaptive value, which intrinsically lends itself to a 
pragmatist or enactivist reading. On our reading, organisms embody a ‘best guess’ 
(technically, a variational model) of the causes of their sensations; and they enact the 
relations captured in a normative (generative) model of their preferences, i.e., their 
phenotypical, preferred states.

Abstract: 
In this paper we outline a framework for the study of the mechanisms involved in the 
engagement of human agents with cultural affordances. Our aim is to better understand how 
culture and context interact with human biology to shape human behavior, cognition, and 
experience. We attempt to integrate several related approaches in the study of the embodied, 
cognitive, and affective substrates of sociality and culture and the sociocultural scaffolding of 

57 
 
experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to 
provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance’ that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and 
(ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the 
transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared 
attention. This framework provides an account of how cultural content and normative practices 
are built on a foundation of contentless basic mental processes that acquire content through 
immersive participation of the agent in social practices that regulate joint attention and shared 
intentionality.

1. Introduction  
The acquisition of culture is notoriously difficult to study. Over 70 years of research on the 
development of person-perception, for example, have made it clear that children as young as 4 
years of age have already acquired implicit biases about ethnicity and other socially constructed 
categories of persons (Aboud & Amato, 2008; Clark, 1963; Clark & Clark, 1939; Hirschfeld, 
1998; Huneman & Machery, 2015; Kelly, Faucher, & Machery, 2010; Machery & Faucher, 
2005; Pauker, Williams, & Steele, 2016). These biases are consistent with the dominant culture 
of their societies, but are most often not consciously held or explicitly taught by their caregivers 
and educators. While most young children express a positive bias toward people they identify 
as members of their own group, children from minority groups typically show preferences for 
dominant groups, rather than for persons of their own ethnicity (Clark & Clark, 1939; Kinzler 
& Spelke, 2011). How such biases are acquired is still an open question. Ethnographic studies 
of socialization, education, and language acquisition have pointed to broad cross-cultural 
variations in how children are instructed, spoken to, expected to behave, involved in 
community activities, and exposed to other socializing agents beyond nuclear or extended 
families (Mead, 1975; Rogoff, 2003; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986). However, by age 5, children 
across cultures have for the most part become proficient in the dominant set of expectations 
and representations of their cultures, despite the much discussed poverty of cultural stimuli to 
which they are exposed (Chomsky, 1965). These matters point to a human propensity for 
‘picking up’ the broad scripts of culture even without any explicit instruction. In other words, 
we all come to acquire the shared background knowledge, conceptual frameworks, and 
dominant values of our culture. The presence of intuitive or implicit, yet stable and widely 
shared beliefs and attitudes among children constitutes a challenging problem for cognitive and 
social science.   
 
In this paper, we outline a framework for the study of the mechanisms that mediate the 
acquisition of cultural knowledge, values, and practices in terms of perceptual and behavioural 
affordances. Our aim is to better understand how culture and context shape human behavior 
and experience by integrating several related approaches in the study of the embodied, 
cognitive, and affective substrates of action and the sociocultural scaffolding of embodied 
experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to 
provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance’ that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and 
(ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the 
transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices.

The context of the present discussion is the search for the ‘natural origins of content’ 
(Hutto & Satne, 2015). We hope to contribute to the naturalistic account of the emergence of 
semantic content, that is, of the evolution (in phylogeny) and acquisition (in ontogeny) of 
representational or propositional content. Cultural worlds seem to be full of meaningful 
‘content’—of explicit ways to think about and respond to the world in terms of kinds of agents, 
actions, and salient events. ‘Content’, here, is defined in terms of representational relations 
with satisfaction conditions: a vehicle x bears some semantic or representational content y just 
in case there are satisfaction conditions which, when they obtain, tell us that the vehicle is 
about something. Semantics is an intensional notion (Haugeland, 1990; Millikan, 1984, 2004, 
2005; Piccinini, 2015). How do humans acquire this cultural knowledge and capacity to 
respond in social contexts in ways that actors and others find meaningful and appropriate? 
 
We hypothesize that agents acquire semantic content through their immersion in, and 
dynamic engagement with, feedback or looping mechanisms that mediate shared intentionality 
and shared attention. Semantic content, we suggest, is realized in culturally shared 
expectations, which are embodied at various levels (in brain networks, cultural artifacts, and 
constructed environments) and are enacted in ‘regimes’ of shared attention. We generalize 
contemporary ecological, affordance-based models of cognitive systems adapting to their 
contexts over ontogeny and phylogeny to account for the acquisition of cultural meanings and 
for the elaborate scaffoldings constituted by constructed, ‘designer’ niches (Clark, 2015; 
Hutchins, 2014; Kirchhoff, 2015a). We suggest that ‘regimes of shared attention’—that is, 
patterned cultural practices (Roepstorff, Niewöhner, & Beck, 2010) that direct the attention of 
participant agents—modulate the acquisition of culturally-specific sets of expectations. Recent 
work in computational neuroscience on predictive processing provides a model of how cultural 
affordances could scaffold the acquisition of socially shared representational content. In what 
follows, we shall sketch a multilevel framework that links neural computation, embodied 
experience, cultural affordances, and the social distribution of representations.  
 
We begin by specifying a conceptual framework for ‘cultural affordances’, building on 
recent accounts of the notion of affordances in ecological, enactivist, and radical embodied 
cognitive science (Box 1). We propose to distinguish two kinds of cultural affordances: 
‘natural’ affordances and ‘conventional’ affordances. Natural affordances are possibilities for 
action, the engagement with which depends on an organism or agent exploiting or leveraging 
reliable correlations in its environment with its set of abilities. For instance, given a human 
agent’s bipedal phenotype and related ability to walk, an unpaved road affords a trek. 
Conventional affordances are possibilities for action, the engagement with which depends on 

60 
 
agents’ skillfully leveraging explicit or implicit expectations, norms, conventions, and 
cooperative social practices. Engagement with these affordances requires that agents have the 
ability to correctly infer (implicitly or explicitly) the culturally specific sets of expectations in 
which they are immersed—expectations about how to interpret other agents, and the 
symbolically and linguistically mediated social world. Thus, a red light affords stopping not 
merely because red lights correlate with stopping behavior, but also because of shared (in this 
case, mostly explicit) norms, conventions, and rules. Both kinds of cultural affordances are 
relevant to understanding human social niches; and both natural and conventional affordances 
may be socially constructed, albeit in different ways (Hacking, 1999). Human biology is 
cultural biology; culture has roots in human biological capacities. The affordances with which 
human beings engage are cultural affordances. 
 
 
We then assess the tensions between our proposed framework and radical enactivist 
and embodied approaches, which are typically committed to forms of non- (or even anti-) 
representationalism. On these views, perception, cognition, and action need not involve 
computational or representational resources. The scope of this claim varies. For some, this 
entails a rejection of computational or representational models and metaphors in the study of 
the mind—a staunch commitment to anti-representationalism (Chemero, 2009; Gallagher, 
2001, 2008; Thompson, 2010; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991). More conciliatory positions 
instead suggest that basic cognitive processes are without content, but accommodate a place 
for contentful cognition. They claim that certain typically human forms of cognition involve 
representations, in the sense that human agents have the dispositions (mechanisms, behavioral 
repertoires, etc.) that are required to immersively engage with sociocultural content (e.g., 
patterned symbolic practices, linguistic constructions, storytelling and narration). We argue 
that contemporary computational neuroscience complements the more conciliatory of these 
approaches by providing a minimal neural-computational scaffolding for the skilled 
engagement of organisms with the available affordances.  
 
Having done this, we turn to affordances in social and linguistic forms of life. We 
examine local ontologies, understood as sets of shared expectations, as well as the complex 
feedback relations (or looping effects) between these ontologies and human modes of 
communication, shared intentionality, and shared attention. Drawing on the skilled 
intentionality framework (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014), we examine the dynamics of cultural 
affordance acquisition through patterned cultural practices, notably attentional practices. We 
hypothesize that feedback mechanisms between patterned regimes of attention and shared 
forms of intentionality (notably shared expectations and immersion in local ontologies) leads 

61 
 
to the acquisition of such affordances. This framework can guide future research on multilevel, 
recursive, nested cultural affordances and the social norms and individual expectations on 
which they depend. 
 
2. A theoretical framework for affordances 
Much recent work in cognitive science has been influenced by the notion of affordances 
originally introduced by Gibson (1979). The interdisciplinary framework currently being 
developed to study affordances provides us with a point of departure for thinking about the 
evolution and acquisition of semantic, representational content. The aim of this section is to 
clarify the implications of adopting this framework.  
 
Affordances are central to the emerging ‘enactivist’ and ‘radical embodied’ paradigms 
in cognitive neuroscience. Theorists of enactive cognition model the intelligent adaptive 
behavior of living cognitive systems as the dynamic constitution of meaning and salience in 
rolling cycles of perception and action, explicitly recognizing the emergence of meaning and 
salience in the active, embodied engagement of organisms with their environment (Di Paolo, 
2009; Di Paolo, 2005; Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Froese & Di Paolo, 2011; Hutto & Satne, 
2015; Hutto & Myin, 2013; Kirchhoff, 2016; Noë, 2004; Thompson, 2010). Embodied 
approaches in cognitive science explain the feats of intelligence displayed by cognitive systems 
by considering the dependence of cognition on the various aspects of the body as it engages 
with its environment, both internal and external (Barsalou, 2008; Shapiro, 2010). ‘Radical 
embodied’ cognitive science extends the theoretical framework of ecological psychology 
(Gibson, 1979) to the embodied cognition paradigm, providing a phenomenologically plausible 
account of active, dynamical coping (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Chemero, 2003, 2009; 
Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014; Thompson & Varela, 2001). Recently, the enactive, radical 
enactive, and radical embodied approaches have been extended to ‘higher-order’ social and 
cultural systems (Froese & Di Paolo, 2011; Hutto & Myin, 2013; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). 
This latter branch of enactivist theory will concern us especially.    
 
2.1. Perspectives, affordances, and phenomenology  
One of the distinctive contributions of ecological, radical embodied, and enactivist theories of 
cognition is their shared emphasis on the point of the view of the organism itself, understood 
as an intentional center of meaningful behavior. The implication of these ‘perspectivist’ 
approaches in cognitive science is that the world is disclosed as a set of ‘affordances’, that is, 
possibilities for action afforded to organisms by the things and creatures that populate its 

62 
 
environmental niche, as engaged through their perceptual and sensorimotor abilities (Heft, 
2001; Silva, Garganta, Araújo, Davids, & Aguiar, 2013; Turvey, 1992; Turvey, Shaw, Reed, 
& Mace, 1981); cf. also Thompson (2010); Varela (1999). To paraphrase Wittgenstein, the 
world is the totality of possibilities of action, not of things. Perspectivist approaches in 
cognitive science operationalize this view of the organism and propose an account of 
perception, cognition, and action that is closer to the phenomenology of everyday experience.  
 
Affordances provide an alternative framework for thinking about perception, cognition, 
and action that dissolves the strict conceptual boundary between these categories in a way that 
is closer to the phenomenology of everyday life.1 This approach echoes the kernel insights of 
the phenomenology of Heidegger (2010/1927) and Merleau-Ponty (1968/1964, 2013/1945) 
about perception and action. Cognitive agents experience the world perceptually through the 
mediation of action, as a function of those actions that things in the world afford. For example, 
my cup of coffee is not first perceived as having such and such properties (size, shape, color), 
and only then as providing the opportunity for sipping dark roast. Instead, my filled cup is 
directly perceived as affording the action of sipping. Filled cups of coffee afford sipping; a 
paved road affords walking; a red traffic light affords stopping. The claim, then, is that 
cognitive agents typically do not encounter the world that they inhabit as a ‘pre-given’, 
objective, action-neutral set of things and properties, to be reconstructed in perception and 
cognition on the basis of sensory information, as classical models in cognitive science once 
suggested (e.g., Dawson, 2013; Fodor, 1975; Marr, 1982). The things that we engage are 
disclosed instead directly as opportunities for action—that is, as affordances. As Heidegger 
(2010/1927) famously argued, it is only when my smooth coping breaks down (say, when I run 
out of coffee, or when the cup breaks) that the objective properties of the cup become salient, 
present in perceptual experience at all.  
                                                 
1 Enactive accounts reject the rigid separation of perception, cognition, and action, 
emphasizing that organisms cope with their environment in rolling cycles of engagement in 
which the distinction between action, cognition, and perception is blurred. When such a 
distinction is made, enactivist thinkers typically resist the traditional picture that subordinates 
action to perception or cognition. Theorists who draw the distinction nevertheless emphasize 
the deep connection between perception, cognition, and action. There are good reasons to 
think that action is a precondition for perception or that perception is a form of action (Clark, 
2015; Kirchhoff, 2016). As we shall see in section 2., free-energy approaches frame 
perception and action as complementary ways of minimizing ‘prediction error’. Our 
preference is to speak of rolling cycles of ‘action-perception’ to refer to the complex looping 
process whereby organisms cope with their environment. These cycles rely on various 
complementary computational strategies to minimize prediction error, which may (or may 
not) correspond to the traditional concepts of action, cognition, and perception. 

63 
 
 
The principal motivation for thinking of perception, cognition, and action in terms of 
engagement with affordances is that cognitive scientific accounts of these activities ought to 
be coherent with the phenomenology of action and perception in everyday life. Phenomenology 
tells us that there are dense interrelations between action and perception, that perception is 
mainly about the control of action, and that action serves to guide perception (Merleau-Ponty, 
1968/1964, 2013/1945). Affordances provide a framework apt for this task, allowing us to 
integrate phenomenological experience into our models of explanation in cognitive science 
(Petitot, Varela, Pachoud, & Roy, 1999; Varela, 1996). As the story goes, in the wake of the 
behaviorist turn, experiential factors and mentalist language were banished from psychology 
(Skinner, 2011; Watson, 1913). Cognitive science rehabilitated mentalism, at least to some 
extent, in its postulation of cognitive states and processes (Fodor, 1975; Putnam, 1975). Most 
contemporary functionalist and mechanistic accounts of cognition, however, contend that it is 
possible to exhaustively explain a cognitive function by specifying its functional organization 
or the mechanism that implements that function (e.g., Bechtel, 2007; Craver, 2007). As we 
shall see presently, the perspectivist emphasis on the dynamics of the phenomenology of 
everyday life that characterizes enactive and ecological approaches allows us to account for 
cognitive functions with a conceptual framework that explicitly bridges the phenomenology of 
action and perception, system dynamics, and functionalist cognitive neuroscience.  
 
2.2. Landscapes and fields  
Affordances, as possibilities for action, are fundamentally interactional. Their existence 
depends both on the objective material features of the environment and on the abilities of 
different kinds of organisms. This dependence on interaction does not mean that affordances 
have no objective reality or generalizability (Chemero, 2003, 2009). Affordances exist 
independently of specific individual organisms. Their existence is relative to sets of abilities 
available to certain kinds of organisms in a given niche. ‘Abilities’, here, refers to organisms’ 
or agents’ capabilities to skillfully engage the environment, that is, to adaptively modulate its 
patterns of action-perception to couple adaptively to the environment. Without certain abilities, 
correlative opportunities for action are unavailable. Certain chimpanzees, for instance, are able 
to use rocks to cracks nuts. But for nuts and rocks to afford cracking, the chimp must already 
be cognitively and physiologically equipped for nut-cracking. In Chemero’s model of 
affordances, objectivity and subjectivity do not have separate ontological status; they co-exist 
and co-emerge relationally.  

64 
 
 
Building on Chemero (2003, 2009), Rietveld and Kiverstein (2014) define an 
affordance as a relation between a feature or aspect of organisms’ material environment and an 
ability available in their form of life. ‘Form of life’ is a notion adapted from the later 
Wittgenstein (1953). A form of life is a set of behavioral patterns, relatively robust on socio-
cultural or biographical time scales, which is characteristic of a group or population. We might 
say that each species (or subspecies), adapted as it is to a particular niche and endowed with 
specific adapted abilities, constitutes a unique form of life. Different human communities, 
societies, and cultures, with sometimes strikingly different styles of engagement with the 
material and social world, constitute different forms of life. There are thus at least two ways to 
change the affordances available to an organism: (i) by changing the material aspects of its 
environment (which may vary from small everyday changes in its architecture or configuration 
to thoroughgoing niche construction) and (ii) by altering its form of life or allowing it to learn 
new abilities already available in that form of life (interacting in new ways with an existing 
niche by acquiring new abilities through various forms of learning). 
 
Following recent theorizing on affordances (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Rietveld, 
2008a, 2008c; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014), we consider the distinction between the 
‘landscape’ of affordances and the ‘field’ of relevant affordances. The claim is that, typically, 
organisms do not engage with one single affordance at a given time. The world we inhabit is 
instead disclosed as a matrix of differentially salient affordances with their own structure or 
configuration. The organism encounters the world that it inhabits as an ensemble of 
affordances, with which it dynamically copes and which it evaluates, often implicitly and 
automatically, for relevance. For an affordance to have ‘relevance’ here means that the 
affordance in question ‘solicits’ the individual, concrete organism by beckoning certain forms 
of perceptual-emotional appraisal and readiness to act. This occurs because affordances are 
both descriptive and prescriptive: descriptive because they constitute the privileged mode for 
the perceptual disclosure of aspects of the environment; and prescriptive because they specify 
the kinds of action and perception that are available, situationally appropriate and, in the case 
of social niches, expected by others. 
 
The ‘landscape’ of affordances is the total ensemble of available affordances for a 
population in a given environment. This landscape corresponds to what evolutionary theorists 
in biology and anthropology call a ‘niche’ (Fuentes, 2014; Odling-Smee, Laland, & Feldman, 
2003; Sterelny, 2007; Sterelny, 2015; Wilson & Clark, 2009). A niche is a position in an 
ecosystem that affords an organism the resources it needs to survive. At the same time, the 
niche plays a role vis-à-vis other organisms and their niches in constituting the ecosystem as a 

65 
 
whole. A typical ecosystem (that is, a physical environment where organisms can live) has 
multiple niches, which have some degree internal structure: affordances have a variety of 
dynamics relationships (one thing leads to another, depends on, reveals, hides, enables, other 
possibilities for action) (Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016). Thus, the niche is the entire set of affordances 
that are available, in a given environment at a given time, to organisms that take part in a given 
form of life. More narrowly, a niche comprises the affordances available to the group of 
organisms that occupy a particular place in the ecosystem—or, in the case of humans, the social 
world—associated with (and partly constituted by) a form of life.  
 
The ‘field’ of affordances, on the other hand, relates to the dynamic coping and 
intelligent adaptivity of autonomous, individual organisms. The field refers to those 
affordances that actually engage the individual organism at a given time. Of those affordances 
available in the landscape, some take on special relevance as a function of the interests, 
concerns, and states of the organism. These relevant affordances constitute the field of 
affordances for each organism. They are experienced as ‘solicitations’, in that they solicit 
(further) affective appraisal and thereby prompt patterns of ‘action readiness’, that is, act as 
perceptual and affective prompts for the organism to act on the affordance (De Haan, Rietveld, 
Stokhof, & Denys, 2013; Frijda, 1986; Frijda, 2007; Rietveld, De Haan, & Denys, 2013). This 
engagement will vary in complexity, conformity, and creativity from pre-specified or pre-
patterned ways of acting to “free” improvisation, as we shall see below.2  
 
The field of affordances changes through cycles of perception and action. Changes in 
the situation that the organism engages give rise dynamically to different solicitations, as a 
function of the state of the organism, much the way a physical gauge field gives rise to different 
potentials as a function of the local forces (Sengupta, Tozzi, Cooray, Douglas, & Friston, 
2016). Consider the action of drinking a cup of coffee. The filled cup affords a gradient 
(grasping, sipping), that is, a potential for coupled engagement. When generated by the 
organism-environment system, this gradient can be experienced by the organism as a 
                                                 
2 Some might express unease at the mixed language we use, which straddles phenomenology, 
system dynamics, and cognitive functions. We take this as a virtue of the multilevel nature of 
the explanatory framework provided by the notion of affordances, which is operative at all of 
these different descriptive levels. Readers who would prefer to keep phenomenological 
description distinct from other explanatory levels (i.e., neural, social, cultural levels of 
explanation) can replace our talk of directly modulating the landscape or field of affordances 
with a more phenomenologically neutral concept, such as the organism’s ‘selective openness’ 
(Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). With this terminology, we might say that changes in the 
patterns of activity in the organism (states, interests, etc.) and the environment shape the 
organism’s selective openness to saliencies.

solicitation. The gradient is dissipated through engagement. The experience of satiation that 
follows drinking, combined with the fact that cup has been emptied, alter the field of 
affordances, which as indicated changes as a function of the states of organism and niche. Thus, 
the gradient is ‘consumed’ or dissipates after successful engagement.    
 
2.3. Meaning and affordances 
Not all affordances are of the same kind. Here we draw on Grice’s theory of meaning to suggest 
an approach to the varieties of cultural affordances in terms of their dependence on content-
involving conventions. We argue that the affordances in human niches (what we call generally 
‘cultural’ affordances) are of two distinct kinds: ‘natural’ and ‘conventional’ affordances.  
 
Grice’s theory of meaning, elaborated in a series of papers in the philosophy of mind 
(Grice, 1957, 1969, 1971, 1989), and later refined by Sperber and Wilson (1986), Levinson 
(2000), and Tomasello (2014), is often termed ‘intention-based semantics’, or ‘implicature’. 
On a Grician account, meaning lies in a speaker’s communicative intent; that is, in what she 
intends to convey through an utterance. Grice elaborated the first formula of his theory of 
meaning in these terms (using the subscript NN to signify to ‘non-natural’): 
“A meantNN something by X” is roughly equivalent to “A uttered X with the 
intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this intention” (Grice, 
1989, p. 19) 
 
Taking this model beyond the dyadic sphere of conversational implicature, Grice later 
attempted to explain how “timeless” (that is to say, durable and widely shared) conventions of 
meaning are recognized in a shared cultural repertoire: 
“x meansNN (timeless) that so-and-so” might at a first shot be equated with some 
statement or disjunction of statements about what “people” (vague) intend (with 
qualifications about “recognition”) to effect by x  (Grice, 1989, p. 220)  
 
In the subsequent ‘relevance’ account, Sperber & Wilson (1986) translated this 
automatic ‘first shot’ recognition of conventional meaning as one in which human minds scan 
for salient, meaning-generating cues in the environment, and stop processing when the cues 
are secured.  
 
Our model draws on Grice to describe the stabilization of cultural cues as affordances. 
Key to our approach is the implied ontological and epistemic status of other minds (that is, the 
intentions of ‘persons’) in the embodied cognitive work required in the ‘recognition’, or more 
precisely, the enactment of meaning. Our proposal, then, is to follow Grice in understanding 
the thought, affect, and behavior of human agents as determined by implicit expectations about 

67 
 
others’ expectations. Specifically, we argue that humans behave according to the way they 
expect others to expect them to behave in a given situation (see Figure 1).3 As we shall explicate 
below, we contend that humans operate (often pre-reflectively) within the landscape and field 
of possibilities for variations in action4 as a function of their expectations about what others 
expect of them in specific contexts (see Figure 2).

variations in action. 
                                                 
3 This basic cognitive formula for sociality requires three orders of automatic intentionality; 
that it is to say, an implicit, non-narrative, hypothesis-generating, error-reduction scenario of 
the “I think they think I think” variety that can be translated as “what would relevant others 
expect me to think/feel/do in this situation?” 
4 The notion of variation and improvisation in action within a convention is very important. 
Humans do not simply obey prescribed expectations, but also resist, transgress and transform 
them. Specific fields of joint-intentional affordances, thus, invariably entail different licenses 
for improvisation on expected behavior. The background formula for action is not simply 
“what would others expect me to do here?” but also “how much license or room to improvise 
do I have here given what the set of local cues tells me about others’ expectations and the 
norms that should otherwise govern my behavior in this specific situation?” 

68 
 
 
 
 
The importance of these revisions to Grice’s model of meaning to our framework for 
cultural affordances is to highlight the dependence of certain kinds of affordances on joint 
intentionality, and effective social and cultural normativity and conventionality, or 
equivalently, the shared expectations (both implicit and explicit) that codetermine the 
affordance landscape and local field dynamics. Grice (1957) distinguished between natural and 
non-natural forms of meaning, emphasizing the latter in most of his work. Natural meaning is 
a relation between two things that are correlated. Smoke ‘means’ fire because tokens of smoke 
reliably correlate with tokens of fire. Similarly, (certain kinds of) spots mean measles 
(understood not as the popular category but as the biomedically recognized infection with a 
particular virus). Non-natural meaning instead depends on the capacity of individual agents to 
exploit explicit and implicit social ‘conventions’ (in the wide sense of locally shared norms, 
values and moral frames, expectations, ontologies, etc.) to infer the intentional states of other 
agents and thereby engage them or engage aspects of the environment with them. Red traffic 
lights, in virtue of convention (and law), ‘mean’ stop, and hence afford (and mandate) 
stopping—and this is made possible by the specifically human mastery of recursive inferences, 
both explicit and implicit, that agents make about other agents (Tomasello, 2014).  
 
Recent work on information processing has extended Grice’s framework to account for 
different kinds of information (Piccinini, 2015; Piccinini & Scarantino, 2011; Scarantino & 
Piccinini, 2010). A token informational vehicle x of kind X (that is, a sign, a pattern of neural 
activation, or what have you) carries ‘natural information’ about some information source y of 
kind Y just in case there are reliable correlations between X and Y. Natural information, in other 
words, cannot misrepresent, for it is non-semantic; it is not the kind of thing that can be simply 
true or false. Such information can be exploited and leveraged by a cognitive system to guide 
intelligent behavior. Conversely, ‘non-natural information’ (or as we prefer to put it, 
‘conventional information’), pertains to semantic, content-involving representations that 
depend on social norms and cultural background knowledge. Non-natural information allows 
an agent to make a correct inference about some aspect of an intentional system, e.g., other 
agents, language and other symbolic systems such as mathematics, etc. Non-natural 
information is semantic in that it obtains in virtue of satisfaction conditions (e.g., truth 
conditions). A vehicle carries this kind of information about some state of affairs just in case 
some (explicit or implicit) shared convention, in the sense outlined above, links a vehicle to 
what it represents.  

69 
 
 
In the psychological and anthropological literature, affordances are usually understood 
as interactional properties between organisms and their environment that can be individually 
discovered in ontogeny without social learning. Chimpanzees, for example, rediscover how to 
crack nuts with rocks in each generation without vertical social transmission of skills (Howes, 
2011; Ingold, 2000, 2001; Moore, 2013). Most of what humans do, in contrast, is learned 
socially and requires complex forms of coordination. We suggest, however, that successfully 
learned human conventions that govern action are also best conceptualized as affordances.  
Such affordances depend on shared sets of expectations, reflected in the ability to engage 
immersively in patterned cultural practices, which reference, depend on, or enact folk 
ontologies, moralities and epistemologies. We might call these ‘conventional’ affordances.  
 
An empty street affords being walked on or driven on to the lone pedestrian or driver. 
Yet affordances, especially those depending on conventions, might differ depending on 
context. A red traffic light, as we have seen, affords an agent stopping, particularly in the 
presence of others, and especially in the presence (real or imagined) of police who are expect 
to intervene. But a driver might alter her behavior as a result of not being seen by others. A red 
traffic light in an empty street at 4:00 AM, thus, might afford transgression of the stopping rule 
following an inference about the absence of other minds likely to judge the agent. Departing 
from Grice and earlier theories of information processing (Dretske, 1995), one might 
understand the notion of information as probabilistic: to carry information implies only the 
truth of a probabilistic claim (Scarantino, 2015; Scarantino & Piccinini, 2010). Although this 
account was developed for natural information, we extend it here to conventional information, 
given the prominence of social improvisation. ‘Conventions’ need not be explicitly formulated 
as rules, and may instead originate in the actors’ engagement with local backgrounds over time, 
that is, from non-contentful developmental experiences, learning, or participation in social and 
cultural practices (Piccinini, 2015; Satne, 2015).  
 
A cultural artifact may have multiple affordances according to its embedding in larger 
webs of relationships that are part of the individual’s history of learning and the expectations 
for the potential participation of others. Indeed, to operate with conventional affordances, 
agents must have shared sets of expectations—we must know what others expect us to expect 
Simple rule-governed models of sociality go on the assumption that conventions lead to stable, 
binary affordances, where satisfaction conditions are either met or not. However, cultural 
symbols and signs are usually polysemous and their interpretation depends on context. 
Moreover, variations in the way agents engage with affordances in practice, often license what 
we could term ‘skilled improvisation’. Rules and conventions can be followed slavishly, 

70 
 
selectively ignored, deliberately transgressed, or re-interpreted to afford new possibilities. 
Natural dispositions for shared intentionality in what Searle (Searle, 1991, 1992, 1995, 2010) 
calls the deep background, on this view, give rise to cooperative action not only through 
convention but also through iterative variations governed by modes of engagement with 
cultural affordances (Terrone & Tagliafico, 2014).  
 
3. The neurodynamics of affordances  
Some aspects of culture clearly involve content in the improvisational sense of the term: 
namely, those affordances that depend on conventions, social normativity, and the ability to 
improvise from a joint-intentional background enriched by cultural learning. Here, we aim to 
contribute to the effort to explicate the mechanisms by which basic minds are scaffolded into 
more elaborate content-involving processes. To explain agents’ engagement with contentful 
affordances requires a theory of cultural content and representations.  
 
Our hypothesis, to be explicated below, is that feedback loops mediating shared 
attention and shared intentionality are the principal mechanism whereby cultural (especially 
conventional) affordances are acquired. Before proceeding, however, we must face an 
objection stemming from tensions between our enactivist-embodied-ecological framework and 
our aim of providing a theory for the acquisition of semantic content. We have suggested that 
conventional affordances depend on shared expectations, perspective-taking, and even 
mindreading abilities. However, proponents of radical embodiment and enactivism argue that 
cognition can be understood as the coupling of an organism to its niche through dynamical 
processes, without any need to invoke representational processes and resources like explicit 
expectations and mindreading (Chemero, 2009; Gallagher, 2001, 2008; Thompson, 2010; 
Varela et al., 1991). On these accounts, classical theories of cognition (Fodor, 1975; Marr, 
1982), which modeled cognition as the rule-governed manipulation of internal representations, 
radically misconstrue the nature of agents’ intentional engagement with their worlds. The 
claim, then, is that much cognition can (indeed, must) be explained by appealing only to 
dynamical coupling between organism and environment. 
 
Rejecting the claim that cognition necessarily involves representations, radical 
enactivists insist that basic cognitive processes (‘basic minds’) can function entirely without 
content (Hutto & Myin, 2013; Thompson, 2010). The argument, then, is that minds, especially 
basic minds like those of simple organisms (and many of the unreflective embodied 
engagements of more complex minds), do not require content. They only require adequate 
forms of coupling, which need bear no content at all. Adequate coupling only requires an 

71 
 
organism to leverage correlations that are reliable enough to be exploited for survival. This 
poses a challenge to a theory like ours, which aims to explicate the acquisition of cultural 
content in the form of conventional affordances. In this section, we accommodate this radical 
minimalism about representations and semantic content while sketching a neural computational 
account of the scaffolding of cultural affordances.  
 
3.1. Computation, representation, and minimal neural models  
Recent work on computation and neurodynamics helps to clarify the scope of radical arguments 
against content-involving, representational theories of cognition. Although older semantic 
theories view computation as the processing of representations (with propositional content and 
satisfaction conditions) more recent theories do not make this assumption. The ‘modeling view’ 
of computation (Chirimuuta, 2014; Grush, 2001; Shagrir, 2006, 2010) suggests that 
computation in physical systems (calculators, digital and analog computers, neural networks) 
employs a special kind of minimal, structural or analogical model based on statistical 
correlations (O'Brien & Opie, 2004; O’Brien & Opie, 2009, 2015). On this view, a 
computational process is one that dynamically generates and uses a statistical model of a target 
domain (say, things in the visual field). The model is said to ‘represent’ that domain only in 
the sense that the relations between its computational vehicles (digits, neural activation 
patterns, or what have you) preserve the higher-order statistical, structural-relational properties 
of the target domain, which can be leveraged to guide adaptive action. We might call this 
‘weak’ (non-propositional) content, based on structural analogy between vehicle and target 
domain (O’Brien & Opie, 2004, 2009, 2015). Such statistical models are much more 
minimalistic than traditional representational theories of mind, which require that internal 
representations bear propositional content (Fodor, 1975). Even more minimalistic accounts of 
computation are available. Computation can be defined mechanistically, as the rule-governed 
manipulation of computational (rather than representational) vehicles (Miłkowski, 2013; 
Piccinini, 2015). On the mechanistic account, computations (digital, analog, neural) can occur 
without any form of semantic content (Piccinini & Scarantino, 2011; Scarantino & Piccinini, 
2010).  
 
Thus, some of the newest theories of computation are minimalistic about the 
representational nature of neural processes. Whether the modeling-structural and the 
mechanistic minimal statistical models deserve the label ‘representation’ is debatable 
(Anderson & Chemero, 2013; Clark, 2015; Hutto & Satne, 2015). To some degree the conflict 
may be merely terminological. What matters for our purposes is to note that the minimalistic 

72 
 
statistical-computational models in the cognitive system can be leveraged to guide skilled 
intelligent, context-sensitive, adaptive behavior. This provides additional weight to the claim 
that basic minds are without strong, propositional, semantic content (Hutto, Kirchhoff, & Myin, 
2014; Hutto & Myin, 2013).  
 
While this may be the case, human societies clearly transact in content-laden 
representations. We use language replete with images, metaphors and other symbols to tell 
stories and narrate our lives. We imagine particular scenarios or events, and we think about, 
describe, elaborate and manipulate these images or models in ways that treat them as pictures 
or representations of possible realities. Importantly, even on the radical view on offer here, 
nothing precludes such content-involving cognition. In recent discussions around the natural 
origins of content, it is hypothesized that neural computations can come to acquire 
representational content when coupled adequately to a niche or milieu through dense histories 
of causal coupling (Hutto & Satne, 2015; Hutto & Myin, 2013; Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017). 
We suggest that immersive involvement of agents in patterned cultural practices during 
development, and the subsequent practice of the abilities acquired in enculturation, allows for 
the acquisition of stable cultural affordances. In the case of human beings, whose learning is 
mostly social, the function of the neural computations performed by a system becomes that of 
interfacing adequately with both representational and non-representational aspects of culture 
so as to guide appropriate behavior.  
 
3.2. Free-energy and the neurodynamics of affordances 
The framework we think can account for the acquisition of cultural affordances by agents rests 
on recent work in computational neuroscience and theoretical biology on the ‘free-energy 
principle’. The free-energy principle is a mathematical formulation of the tendency of 
autonomous living systems to adaptively resist entropic disintegration (Friston, 2012a; Friston, 
2013a; Friston, 2013b; Friston, 2010; Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006; Sengupta et al., 2016). 
This disintegration can be thought of as the natural tendency of all organized systems (which 
are by their nature far-from-equilibrium systems) to dissipate, that is, to return to a state of low 
organization and high entropy or disorder—in other words, to return to (thermodynamic) 
equilibrium. The free-energy principle states that the dynamics of living organisms are 
organized to maintain their existence by minimizing the information-theoretic quantity 
‘variational free-energy’. By minimizing free-energy, the organism resists entropic dissipation 
and maintains itself in its phenotypical steady-state, far from thermodynamic equilibrium 
(death).  

73 
 
 
One application of the free-energy principle in computational neuroscience is a family 
of models collectively referred to as ‘hierarchical predictive processing’ models, which 
instantiate a more general view of the brain as a ‘prediction machine’ (Bar, 2011; Clark, 2015; 
Friston, 2012b; Friston & Kiebel, 2009; Friston, 2010, 2011; Frith, 2007; Hohwy, 2014) – for 
empirical evidence see Adams, Bauer, Pinotsis, & Friston (2016). In this framework, the brain 
is modeled as a complex dynamical system, the main function of which is to ‘infer’ (in a 
qualified sense) the distal causes of its sensory stimulation, starting only from its own sensory 
channels. The strategy employed by the brain, according to this view, is to use a ‘generative 
model’ of the distal causes and engage in self-prediction (Eliasmith, 2005; Friston, 2010). That 
is, the system’s function is to predict the upcoming sensory state and compare it the actual 
sensory state, while minimizing the difference between these two distributions (predictions and 
prediction errors) through ongoing modification of predictions or action on the environment 
(see Figure 3 and Figure 4).  
 
 
Figure 3. In the predictive processing approach, the main activity of the nervous system is to predict upcoming 
sensory states and minimize the discrepancy between prediction and sensory states (‘prediction errors’). The 
information propagated upward to higher levels for further processing consists only in these prediction errors. 

74 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 4. A diagram of Bayesian inference in predictive processing architectures. The dynamics of such systems 
conform to the principles of the Bayesian statistical inference framework. The Bayesian statistical framework is 
central to predictive processing architectures, for the latter assume that neural network interactions operate in a 
way that maximizes Bayesian model evidence. Bayesian methods allow one to calculate the probability of an 
event taking place by combining the ‘prior probability’ of this event (the probability that such an event takes 
place before considering any evidence) with the ‘likelihood’ of that event, that is, the probability of that event 
given some evidence. This allows the Bayesian system to calculate the ‘posterior probability’ of the event, that 
is, the revised probability given any new available evidence. Prior probabilities are carried by predictions (green 
arrows) issued by the generative model units (green units). Likelihoods are carried by prediction errors (red 
arrows) issued by the error units (red units). In the ‘empirical Bayes’ framework, the system can then use the 
posterior obtained from one iteration as the prior in the next iteration. Predictions issued from the generative 
models, which encode prior beliefs, propagate up, down, and across the hierarchy (through backwards and 
lateral connections) and are leveraged to guide intelligent adaptive action-perception. This leveraging is 
achieved by cancelling out (or ‘explaining away’) discrepancies, which encode likelihood, through rolling 
cycles of action-perception. This same process allows the system to learn through plastic synaptic connections, 
which are continuously updated through free-energy minimization in action-perception. The system thus 
continuously and autonomously updates its ‘expectations’ (Bayesian prior beliefs) in rolling cycles of action-
perception. 
 

75 
 
 
 
‘Generative models’ are minimal statistical models, of the kind discussed above. The 
use by a system of generative models need not entail semantic content. Their function is to 
dynamically extract and encode information about the distal environment as sets of probability 
distributions. The information involved here can be natural or conventional in kind. The only 
entailment is that the system or organism must leverage its generative model to guide skilled 
intentional coupling. The system uses this generative model to guide adaptive and intelligent 
behavior by ‘inverting’ that model through Bayesian forms of (computational, subpersonal) 
inference, allowing it to leverage the probability distributions encoded in the model to 
determine the most probable distal causes of that distribution and to act in the most contextually 
appropriate way (Clark, 2015; Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2014).  
 
How does this inversion take place? Generative models are used to generate a prediction 
about the upcoming sensory distribution. Between the predicted and actual sensory 
distributions, there almost always will be a discrepancy (‘prediction error’), which ‘tracks’ 
surprisal (in the sense that, mathematically, it is an upper bound on that quantity). The free-
energy principle states that all living systems act to reduce prediction error (and thereby 
implicitly resist the entropic tendency towards thermodynamic equilibrium—dissipation and 
death). This can occur in one of two complementary ways: (i) through action, where the best 
action most efficiently minimizes free-energy by making the world more like the prediction 
(‘active inference’); and (ii) through perception and learning, by selecting the ‘hypothesis’ (or 
prediction, which corresponds to the probable distal cause of sensory distribution) that most 
minimizes error, or changing the hypotheses when none fits or when one fits better (Friston, 
2013a; Friston & Frith, 2015a; Friston, 2011; Friston & Frith, 2015b; Friston et al., 2012). 
Given that generative models embody fine-grained statistical information about the distal 
environment at different scales, the top-down prediction signals (produced by higher levels in 
the processing system) provide crucial contextualizing information for the activity of lower 
levels in the predictive hierarchy, rendering the feedforward error signal contextually sensitive 
and adaptive (see Figure 5).  
 

76 
 
 
Fig. 5. Diagram of hierarchical structure of the predictive processing networks. Predictive networks have 
hierarchical structure in the sense that their processing is layered. The layered (hierarchical) structure of the 
generative model allows the model to capture the nested structure of statistical regularities in the world. This 
inferential architecture effectively allows the system to leverage new information dynamically and implement a 
‘bootstrapping’ process, whereby the system extracts its own priors from its dynamic interactions with the 
environment. Computationally, each individual layer has the function of extracting and processing information 
leveraged to cope with regularities at a given level or scale. In this example, information about the visual scene 
is decomposed into high, medium, and low spatial frequency bands. Typically, low spatial frequency features 
change at a faster than high spatial frequency features. As such, lower spatial frequency information is encoded 
higher up in the processing hierarchy, to guide lower-level, faster processing of higher spatial frequency 
information. The hierarchical or layered statistical structure of the generative model enables it to recapitulate the 
salient statistical structure of those systems to which it is coupled. As discussed in the text, this need not imply 
semantic content (but does not exclude it either). 
 
 
 
The representational minimalism of embodied generative models nicely complements 
the representation-sparse phenomenology of affordances. Such minimal models might be 
described as exploiting (non-semantic) information for affordances, rather than (semantic) 
information about affordances (van Dijk, Withagen, & Bongers, 2015); that is, the sensory 

77 
 
array only carries information given certain uses of it by organisms (i.e., being a statistical 
proxy). The ‘internal representations’ involved here might best be thought of as transiently 
‘soft-assembled neural ensembles’, adequately coupled to environmental affordances 
(Anderson, 2014). 
 
It can be argued that predictive processing models complement enactivist and radical 
embodied approaches and are compatible with minimalism about representations, provided we 
do not interpret the statistical computations and error signal processes in a strong semantic, 
content-involving sense (Hutto & Satne, 2015; Kirchhoff, 2015a, 2015b, 2016; Kirmayer & 
Ramstead, 2017). Generative models are simply embodied statistical models that are 
dynamically leveraged to guide intelligent adaptive behavior.  
 
Generative models are embodied at different systemic levels and timescales, in different 
ways. As indicated, at the level of the brain, the predictive hierarchical architecture of neural 
networks come to encode statistical regularities about the niche, which allow the organism to 
engage with the field of affordances in adaptive cycles of action-perception. But the 
embodiment of generative models does not stop at the brain. Indeed, one radical implication of 
the free-energy principle is that the organism itself is a statistical model of its niche (Friston, 
2013b; Friston, 2011). States of the organism (i.e., its phenotype, behavioral patterns, and so 
forth) come to statistically model the niche that it inhabits over evolutionary timescales 
(Badcock, 2012). Thus, phylogeny conforms to the free-energy principle as well, because the 
effects of natural selection is to select against organisms that are poor models of their 
environments. Those organisms that survive and thrive are those that embody, in this literal 
sense, the best generative models of their niche. Organism phenotypes can be described as 
conforming to the free-energy principle over developmental timescales in morphogenesis as 
well (Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 2015). Generative models are thus not only 
‘embrained’, but embodied in an even stronger sense, over the timescales of phylogeny and 
ontogeny. This strong embodiment allows one to interpret free-energy approaches in a non-
internalist way and to counter some objections raised against earlier formulations of predicting 
processing approaches (e.g., Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2014). This multilevel embodiment of the 
generative model, as we shall argue below, extends to the concrete, material, human-designed 
milieus (or ‘designer environments’) in which humans operate.  
 
Some generative models (in this wide sense) involve semantic content and others do 
not (they involve something more minimal than satisfaction conditions, i.e., reliable 
covariation). The study of minds without content is compatible with more extensively content 

78 
 
involving forms of (social and cultural) cognition that are scaffolded on such basic minds 
through processes of social learning and enculturation. 
 
On the radical enactivist account, content-involving forms of intentionality emerge in 
the context of certain cultural practices in human forms of life (Hutto & Satne, 2015). Many of 
these practices involve multi-agent situations in which proper engagement requires forms of 
implicit perspective-taking and perspective-sharing (Sterelny, 2015). In some cases, such 
practices can involve explicit ‘mindreading’ as well, that is, inferring the beliefs, intentions, 
and desires of other agents as such (Michael, Christensen, & Overgaard, 2014). There is a long-
running debate among anthropologists over the extent to which inferences about other people’s 
mental states (as opposed to, say, bodily states) may reflect a folk psychology that is more 
pronounced among modern Western peoples (Robbins & Rumsey, 2008; Rumsey, 2013). This 
‘transparency of mind’ folk psychology is contrasted in the literature with so-called ‘opacity 
doctrines’ found in other cultures, in which people’s interior states are said to be ‘opaque’, or 
unknowable. As recent multi-systems account of social cognition have shown, however, 
situations involving novel cues or too many orders of intentionality will often trigger ‘higher’ 
cognitive resources and compel humans to think about other people’s intentions as such 
(Michael et al., 2014). Engagement with affordances in the human niche also often requires 
‘mindshaping’, as our interpretation of other agents’ intentional profiles in turn shapes those 
same profiles through interpersonal loops (Sterelny, 2007; Sterelny, 2015; Zawidzki, 2013). 
Perspective-taking can be implicit and embodied in that organisms can act on situations by 
leveraging minimal models that encode information about other agents and their behavior 
without entailing the presence of semantic content (i.e., having satisfaction conditions). But 
this is not incompatible with the claim that perspective-taking and mindshaping abilities, in the 
human niche, often involve symbolically and linguistically mediated forms of communication, 
which substantially change the kind of affordance landscape available to human agents 
(Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2013; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014).  
 
Although the perspectivist focus on the dynamic embodied enactment of meaning in a 
shared social world is central to our understanding of cultural affordances (Fuchs & De Jaegher, 
2009; Gallagher, 2001, 2008), our contention is that the acquisition of representational content 
in ‘epidemics’ of socially shared representations (Claidière, Scott-Phillips, & Sperber, 2014; 
Sperber, 1996) entails that cognitive agents must be endowed with a neural-computational 
scaffolding adequate to such activities.5 Even though basic cognition (and indeed, some forms 
                                                 
5 We should note a few limitations of the ‘epidemic’ metaphor: (i) representations are not 

79 
 
of ‘higher’ cognition; Hutto & Myin, 2013) may be without content, given the symbolic and 
linguistic nature of human experience and culture, the human cognitive system must be 
equipped with the neural-computational resources needed to adequately couple with shared 
social representations, if we are to account for how the latter are transmitted stably and reliably. 
Semantic content is acquired through dense histories of embodied engagement with the 
environment. For humans, this involves participation in patterned, linguistically and 
symbolically mediated practices—which include patterns of shared attention and shared 
intentionality.  
 
3.3. Predictive processing and attention 
 
One aspect of the architecture of predictive processing is crucial for our account of cultural 
affordances: The predictive processing model specifies a deep functional role for attention. 
Attention, on the predictive processing account, is modeled as ‘precision-weighting’, that is, 
the selective sampling of high precision sensory data, i.e., prediction error with a high signal-
to-noise ratio (Feldman & Friston, 2010). The efforts of the cognitive system to minimize free-
energy operate not only on first-order, correlational statistical information about the distal 
environment, but on second-order statistical information about the signal-to-noise ratio or 
‘precision’ (that is, inverse variance) of the prediction error signal as well. This allows the 
system to give greater weight to less noisy signals that may provide more reliable information. 
Based on this information, the cognitive system balances the gain (or ‘volume’) on the units 
carrying prediction errors at specific levels of the hierarchy, as a function of precision. This 
control function, in effect, controls the influence of encoded prior beliefs on action-perception 
(Friston, 2010). Greater precision means less uncertainty; the system thus ‘ups the volume’ on 
high precision error signals to leverage that information to guide behavior. Attention, then, is 
the process whereby synaptic gain is optimized to ‘represent’ (in the sense of reliably co-
varying with) the precision of prediction error in hierarchical inference (Clark, 2015; Feldman 
& Friston, 2010).  
 
Precision-weighting is centrally important in these architectures and has been proposed 
as a mechanism of neural gating. Gating is the process whereby effective connectivity in the 
brain (Friston, 1994, 2011), that is, the causal influence of some neural units on others, is 
                                                 
merely transmitted through contagion, but through many different means, modes of 
communication, and practices that are themselves culturally mediated; (ii) they reside not just 
in individuals, but also in artifacts and institutions; and (iii) they are usually not simply 
replicated, but modified or transformed by each individual or institution that takes them up.  

80 
 
controlled by the functioning of distinct control units (Daw, Niv, & Dayan, 2005; den Ouden, 
Daunizeau, Roiser, Friston, & Stephan, 2010; Stephan et al., 2008). These are called ‘neural 
control structures’ by Clark (1998). (For assessments of the empirical evidence, see: Friston, 
Bastos, Pinotsis, & Litvak, 2015; Kok, Brouwer, van Gerven, & de Lange, 2013; Kok, Jehee, 
& De Lange, 2012) Attention-modulated ‘gating’ is the central mechanism that allows for the 
formation of transient task- and context-dependent coalitions or ensembles of neural units and 
networks (Anderson, 2014; Park & Friston, 2013; Sporns, 2010).  
 
Thus, in the predictive processing framework, attention is the main driver of action-
perception. Clark (2015, p. 148ff.) describes possible implementations of this scheme in the 
brain. Much like for first-order expectations, the system encodes expectations about precision 
in the generative model, presumably in the higher levels of the cortical hierarchy (Friston, 
Stephan, Montague, & Dolan, 2014). These signals, which carry context-sensitive second-
order statistical information, then guide the balancing act between top-down prediction signals 
from the generative models and bottom-up error signals in attention (see Figure 6).  
 
 
Fig. 6. A diagram of the looping effects that mediate cultural affordance learning. Regimes of attention, a 
central kind of patterned cultural practice, and higher level expectations encoded in higher levels of the cortical 
hierarchy, guide agents’ attentional styles. In the free-energy framework, attention is modelled as precision-
weighting and has the function of controlling activation across the various levels of the cortical hierarchy by 

81 
 
tuning the gain on error units (that is, they realize the function of gating effective connectivity in the brain). In 
turn, differences in how attention is deployed (through gating) lead to varying salience landscapes and to 
different expectations being encoded in the predictive hierarchy. Based in part on Figure 1 in Friston et al. 
(2014). 
 
 
 
It has been argued that predictive processing models offer a plausible implementation 
for the neural-computational realization of affordance-responsiveness in the nervous system 
(Clark, 2015). As we shall see below, the free-energy model provides a mechanistic 
implementation of the dynamical gradient generation and consumption conception of 
affordance engagement examined above (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). Free-energy is 
minimized through action and perception by the predictive processing hierarchy, which 
provides a mechanistic implementation of the descriptive-prescriptive aspect of affordances.  
 
4. Cultural affordances and shared expectations  
We lack comprehensive accounts of how the conventions that give rise to sociocultural 
affordances are successfully internalized, both as implicit knowing how and explicit knowing 
that. As Searle and others (Sterelny, 2007; Tomasello, 2014; Tuomela, 2007; but see Zahavi & 
Satne, 2015) have shown, and as our models suggests, it takes higher-order levels of 
intentionality, meta-communication, and perspective-taking in order for symbolic conventions 
to be used and manipulated—and for more complicated, self-referential thinking (“I know that 
she thinks that I believe that she intends to X,” etc.), collective intentionality, and multiple 
orders of mindreading. 
 
The question for the present essay is how this framework can be scaled up to account 
for cultural and social cognition and learning. The everyday phenomenology of affordances is 
one of possibilities for action and their variations; in other words, of expecting certain nested 
action possibilities and prescriptions for action. In effect, the phenomenology of affordances is 
a phenomenology of expectations about available and appropriate agent-environment 
couplings. The neural-computational models derived from the free-energy principle traffics in 
predictions and conditional probability distributions (called ‘beliefs’ in Bayesian probability 
theory, without any claim to correspond to the folk psychological notion). Arguably, the 
phenomenological correlate of these Bayesian beliefs can, at least at some (presumably higher) 
levels of the predictive hierarchy, be thought of as (or at least codetermine) agent-level 

82 
 
expectations. Our remarks below focus on clarifying how the social scaffolding of agents leads 
to their acquisition of representational content in regimes of shared attention.  
 
4.1. Skilled intentionality and affordance competition  
On the radical embodied view, the central feature of the dynamic relations between organisms 
and environment is the tendency of the organism to move towards an ‘optimal grip’ on the 
situation. The optima in question, as nearly everywhere in biology, are local optima, rather than 
a single global optimum. Under the free-energy framework, the ‘optimal grip’ can be 
understood as the pattern of action-perception that most minimizes variational free-energy. The 
free-energy minimizing dynamics of the predictive hierarchy might be described as a kind of 
weighted or biased competition between different affordances, the ‘affordance competition’ 
hypothesis (Cisek, 2007; Cisek & Kalaska, 2010; Pezzulo & Cisek, 2016). This model of action 
selection theorizes that the cognitive system appraises different trajectories for motor action 
simultaneously during action selection (that is, appraising a whole field of affordances in 
parallel and dynamically settling on the most salient affordance). 
 
Sport science provides an illustration of this tendency toward optimal grip (Chow, 
Davids, Hristovski, Araújo, & Passos, 2011; Hristovski, Davids, Araújo, & Button, 2006; 
Hristovski, Davids, & Araujo, 2009). Studies of the dynamic interplay between a boxer’s stance 
and position, and the action possibilities available to them as a function of stance and position, 
have shown that punching bags afford different kinds of strikes to boxers as a function of the 
distance between boxer and punching bag. Boxers tend to move their bodies to an optimal 
distance from the punching bag, specifically, one that affords the greatest variety of strikes. 
This is a case of moving towards optimal grip. When observing a painting, we also move our 
bodies and our gazes in a way that maximizes our grip on the scene or details observed. We 
might call such dynamic adaptive engagement with field of affordances in rolling cycles of 
action-perception ‘skilled intentionality’ (following Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Merleau-
Ponty, 2013/1945; Rietveld, 2008b, 2012).  
 
Using the theoretical frameworks of dynamical systems and self-organization, 
Bruineberg and Rietveld (2014) have conceptualized this skilled intentionality as a kind of 
coping with the potentials that well up in the field of affordances, as a result of the dynamic 
relations between organism (with its phenotypical states, its states of action readiness, its 
concerns, etc.) and environment. More specifically, they suggest that skilled intentionality is 
the generation and reduction (or ‘consumption’) by the organism of a ‘gradient’ or potential 
tension in the field of affordances (which can be modeled using attractor dynamics). We 

83 
 
sketched this approach in sections 1.2. and 1.3., without the free-energy framework. The full 
significance of dissipative dynamics in the field of affordances can now be appreciated.  
 
Affordances that are relevant to the organism at a given time (solicitations) drive system 
dynamics by soliciting rolling loops of action-perception and are prescribed and consumed or 
dissipated by those very dynamics (Tschacher & Haken, 2007). That is, solicitations are 
equivalent to potentials in the field of affordances, which act as attractors on the organism-
environment dynamics, changing those affordances to which the organism is selectively open 
and receptive. The solicitations with which the organism engages, on this view, is the one that 
most effectively minimizes free-energy. Affect, attention, and affordances interact to sculpt a 
field of solicitations out of the total landscape of available affordances, adaptively and 
dynamically moving the organism towards an optimal grip on situations through action-
perception. As the organism moves along a gradient toward an optimal grip, the gradient 
dissipates. The field of affordances thus changes dynamically along with perception-action and 
changes to states of the organism and environment. Responsiveness to the field, informed by 
states of the organism and environment, prescribe modes of optimal coupling. The radical 
embodied conception of cognition as skilled intentionality, then, can be modeled using systems 
theoretical models as a kind of selective responsiveness to salient available affordances or 
solicitations, modulated by states of the organism (concerns, interests, abilities) and states of 
the environment. This framework effectively bridges the descriptive levels of phenomenology, 
system dynamics, and cognitive functions or mechanisms.  
 
To date, most work on affordances has focused on motor control and basic behaviors 
related to dynamical embodied coping (e.g., Chemero, 2009; Cisek & Kalaska, 2010; Pezzulo 
& Cisek, 2016). For a theory of cultural affordances, the notion of affordances must be 
extended to more complex features of the social and cultural niche inhabited by humans 
(Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Heft, 2001; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014). Quintessential human 
abilities like language, shared intentionality, and mind-reading/perspective-taking emerge from 
human forms of life and are patterned by human sociocultural practices (Roepstorff et al., 
2010), which in turn involve sophisticated forms of social cognition. We live in a landscape of 
cultural affordances.  
 
4.2. Shared expectations, local ontologies, and cultural affordances   
The upshot of our discussion so far is a general concept of skilled intentionality as selective 
engagement with a field of affordances supported by embodied generative models. Skilled 
intentionality is a graded phenomenon. At one extreme, skilled intentionality consists in 

84 
 
contentless direct coping. It has been suggested that this most basic form of intentionality, 
which Hutto and Satne (2015) call ‘ur-intentionality’, acquires its tendencies for selective 
targeted engagement with the world in a ‘teleosemiotic’ process shaped by evolutionary 
history.6 At this extreme, the only information (and affordances) needed are of the natural kind 
(exploitable reliable correlation). At the other extreme, we find stereotypical human 
intentionality, that is, symbolically dense and strongly content-involving forms of collectively 
and conventionally rooted intentionality (Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2015), which involves 
conventional information and affordances. This is a spectrum, and all points between these 
extremes are viable (at least prima facie). The teleological basis of this variation might be the 
needs, concerns, and abilities relevant to a given form of life, (Kiverstein & Rietveld, 2015; 
Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014), in specific social niches with their own idiosyncratic shared 
representations, symbols, etc.  
 
Our claim here is that cultural affordances (especially conventional ones) form a 
coordinated affordance landscape, which is enabled by sets of embodied expectations that are 
shared by a given community or culture. Social niches and cultural practices generally involve 
not isolated, individual affordances or expectations but local landscapes that give rise to and 
depend on shared expectations. We submit that these shared expectations—implemented in the 
predictive hierarchies, embodied in material culture, and enacted in patterned practices—
contribute to the constitution of the landscape of affordances that characterizes a given 
community or culture. Indeed, shared expectations modulate the specific kinds of intentionality 
that are effective in a given community, determining the forms taken by skilled intentionality, 
especially the shared skilled intentionality of the kind that constitutes a patterned sociocultural 
practice.  
 
Patterned practices are specific ways of doing joint activities in domain-specific 
material-discursive environments (Roepstorff et al., 2010). Echoing recent work on the natural 
origin of semantic content (Hutto & Satne, 2015; Sterelny, 2015), we hypothesize that such 
ontologies, as socially shared and embodied expectations, come to be acquired by the 
                                                 
6 ‘Teleosemiotics’ is teleosemantics minus the semantics, that is, using the teleosemantic 
framework developed by Millikan (1984, 2004, 2005) to explain how organisms develop 
selective intentional response tendencies without trying to provide thereby an account of 
semantic content (Hutto & Myin, 2013). See also Kiverstein & Rietveld (2015) for a 
complementary account of minimal intentionality as a contentless form of skilled 
intentionality. 

85 
 
individual agent through their participative immersion in specific patterned practices available 
in multi-agent, symbolically and linguistically mediated forms of social life.  
 
Building on work in cognitive science as well as by Hacking (1995; Hacking, 1999; 
Hacking, 2002; Hacking, 2004), Kirmayer and colleagues have argued for an embodied, 
enactivist approach to the study of the multilevel feedback or ‘looping’ effects involved in 
jointly-mediated narratives, metaphors, forms of embodiment, and mechanisms of attention 
(Kirmayer, 2008; Kirmayer, 2015; Kirmayer & Bhugra, 2009; Kirmayer & Gold, 2012; 
Seligman & Kirmayer, 2008). In human life, the regularities to which agents are sensitive are 
densely mediated (and often constituted) by cultural symbols, narratives, and metaphors, which 
may explicitly reference or tacitly assume particular ontologies. These mechanisms shape 
social experience and in turn are shaped by broader social contexts. 
 
Elsewhere, we have suggested that local, culturally specific ontologies can be 
understood as sets of shared expectations (Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017). A ‘local ontology’ 
can be defined as a mode of collective expectation: agents expect the sociocultural world to be 
disclosed in certain ways rather than others, and to afford certain forms of action-perception 
and nested variations to the exclusion of others. A local ontology, then, is a set of expectations 
that are shared by members of a cultural community. We claim that these sets of shared 
expectations are installed in agents through patterned practices that result in enculturation and 
enskillment. In the framework explored above, these ontologies codetermine the exact 
affordances that are available in a given niche, for they prescribe specific ways of being, 
thinking, perceiving, and acting in context that are situationally appropriate.  
 
These local ontologies need not be explicitly formulated as metaphysical theories. They 
are more often implicit and acquired through participation in patterned practices and the 
enactment of customs and rituals, or embodied in the social material reality itself (as symbols, 
places, stories). Such distinctively human practices take place in social niches rich with 
narratives, symbols, and customs, which enable individuals to respond cooperatively and, at 
times, to infer other agents’ states of mind. Such practices may underlie everyday processes of 
person-perception. For example, as noted in the introduction, by age 5, children have acquired 
local ontologies and categories of personhood—which reproduce the dominant set of biases, 
expectations, and representations of their cultures—showing preference for dominant group 
culture often without being explicitly taught to do so, and despite their caregivers not 
consciously holding such views, even when these biases are not consonant with their minority 
identities (Clark & Clark, 1939; Kinzler & Spelke, 2011). These tacit views of others may arise 
both from the ways in which local niches are structured by social norms and conventions and 

86 
 
from regimes of attention and interpersonal interactions shaped by cultural practices (Richeson 
& Sommers, 2016). Biases in person-perception will, in turn, influence subsequent social 
interaction and cooperative niche construction in a cognitive-social loop (Sacheli et al., 2015). 
 
As discussed above, a number of theorists of embodied cognition have criticized the 
view that intersubjective interactions require that human beings be endowed with the capacity 
for mind-reading, opting instead for an explanation in terms of embodied practices and 
coupling (Fuchs & De Jaegher, 2009; Gallagher, 2001, 2008). Although we readily grant the 
importance of such embodied coping for basic minds on which more elaborate cognition can 
be scaffolded, we advocate a middle ground that posits both embodied contentless abilities and 
more contentful mindreading abilities (Michael et al., 2014; Sterelny, 2015; Tomasello, 2014; 
Veissière, 2016). Indeed, the framework we have proposed, which posits predictive processing 
hierarchies apt to engage with both natural and conventional information and affordances, can 
accommodate both modes of cognition. The view that human societies rely on explicit and 
implicit forms of mindreading does not commit us to intellectualism or to a strong content-
involving view. The shared enactment of meaning, involving expectations about other agents, 
comes to constitute the shared, taken-for-granted meaning of local worlds, which in turn feeds 
back, in a kind of looping effect, to developmentally ground and scaffold the enactments of 
meaning by individual agents, by altering the shared expectations that are embodied and 
enacted in the social niche (Kirmayer, 2015). These shared ontologies shape experience by 
changing the abilities and styles of action-perception of encultured agents.  
 
4.3. Shared expectations and implicit learning 
We have already appealed to Grice’s theory of meaning to clarify some aspects of affordances. 
Affordances come in a spectrum, ranging from those that depend only on reliable correlation 
to those that depend on shared sets of expectations. Grice’s account, as improved by others 
(Levinson, 2000; Sperber & Wilson, 1986; Tomasello, 2014), can help account for how we 
successfully learn to detect and selectively respond to context in situations that involve higher 
order contextual appraisal, including perspective-taking and reading of other’s goal-directed 
intent and actions. In higher-order, rule-governed semiotic contexts, the actual presence of 
others is not necessary for inferences to be made about the ‘correctness’ of affordances in terms 
of their correspondence to others’ expectations, norms or conventions. The general internalized 
idea of how others would interpret a situation and context (or how a culturally competent actor 
would respond) suffices for ‘meaning’ to be derived or inferred. 

87 
 
 
Most of us have never been explicitly taught precisely how to behave, sit, move, speak, 
take turns, and interact with others in shared spaces such as metros, elevators, hallways, 
airplanes, university classrooms, bars, dance floors, janitors’ closets, or the many other spaces 
we know not to enter. As mentioned in the introduction to this essay, children acquire the 
dominant social norms and appropriate behavioral repertories and responses without explicit 
instruction. Although we do occasionally receive explicit instructions, these do not seem 
necessary for normal social functioning; as Varela (1999) pointed out, we have acquired the 
implicit ‘know how’ to act appropriately. That is, human beings acquire characteristic, 
stereotypical ways of doing and being in response to social contexts; in a sense, each of these 
constitutes habitual ‘micro-selves’ as we variously engage the world as our ‘getting-on-the-
bus-self’ to our ‘having-lunch-self,’ etc., where each self is a style of situationally adequate 
and socially appropriate coupling to a context. How do we acquire the ability to selectively 
detect and respond to such sociocultural affordances? Or to rephrase the question in 
anthropological terms: How do we come to be socialized or enculturated for participation in 
shared worlds of expectations? 
 
The highly stable conformity of behavior in all of these contexts goes beyond direct 
imitation (Michael et al., 2014). Many everyday situations involve coordinated action among 
many participants. Although some forms of coordinated group action can occur entirely 
through individual responses to local impersonal affordances (e.g. the swarming of birds), in 
order to read and master the social cues and scripts in complex human settings, the actors 
involved need to grasp the situation from the perspective of other actors. This perspective-
taking is essential if each actor’s appraisal of the situation is to have any counterfactual depth 
with regard to explicit social norms (e.g., inferring that one’s behaving differently would fail 
to conform to others’ expectations about correct behavior). However, as argued above, in some 
instances this perspective-taking might not involve explicit, content-involving processes; the 
expectations might simply be encoded and leveraged for the generation of adaptive behavior 
without mentalistic assumptions being made about agents at an explicit, conscious level. Thus, 
in any case, for a given space to afford the same engagements to a given population, that 
community must come to share a set of collective expectations—indeed, shared expectations 
about others’ expectations about our expectations, and so forth.  
 
5. Regimes of shared attention and shared intentionality  
The framework we have outlined for cultural affordances allows us to reconsider the natural 
origins of content. We hypothesize that the central mechanism whereby cultural affordances 

88 
 
are acquired, especially conventional, content-involving affordances, consists in the looping or 
feedback relations between shared intentionality and shared attention. Shared intentionality is 
enacted in various concrete, materially embedded cultural practices and embodied as shared 
sets of expectation. Shared attention is one such form of shared intentionality. We suggest that 
shared attention is crucial because directed attention modulates the agent’s selective 
engagement with the field of affordances. Given the nature of the predictive hierarchy, to wit, 
to extract explicit and implicit statistical information, directing an agent’s attention is 
tantamount to determining which expectations (Bayesian prior beliefs) will be encoded in the 
hierarchy. This, in turn, leads to different sets of abilities being implemented by the gating 
mechanisms of the predictive hierarchy. Under the free-energy principle, action-perception is 
guided attention (precision-weighting), and the gating process that is realized by attention itself 
rests on the expectations encoded in the generative models embodied by the organism. These 
high-level expectations about precision, which modulate allocations of attention (and thereby 
determine action-perception through gating) are leveraged to guide skillful intentional 
behavior. The sets of expectations embodied and enacted by organisms change the field of 
affordances. This mechanism, we submit, is exploited by culture in the acquisition of cultural 
affordances.  
 
5.1. Gating, abilities, and affordances 
In the framework outlined above, we followed Rietveld and Kiverstein (2014) in defining an 
affordance as a relation between a set of features or aspects of the organism’s material 
environment and the abilities available in that organism’s form of life. We are now in a position 
to better define an ability in terms of a gating control pattern, that is, a sequenced or coordinated 
process. An ability is simply the capability of an organism to coordinate its action-perception 
loops to skillfully engage an affordance in a way that is optimal under the free-energy principle. 
An ability, then, in the free-energy framework, includes a pattern of attention, in the specific 
sense employed by the free-energy framework. We use the term ‘attention’ not in the folk-
psychological sense, as that effort or mechanism that allows us to attend to specific aspects of 
experience, but as the mechanism of precision-weighting that mediates neural gating and 
allows the agent to engage with specific affordances in action-perception cycles. Attention, in 
our technical sense, therefore modulates effective connectivity and, as such, determines the 
trajectories taken by the rolling cycles of action-perception. Typically, in the case of human 
agents, such patterns of attention are acquired over development.  

89 
 
 
We conjecture that we acquire our distinctively human abilities from our dense histories 
of temporally coordinated social interaction and shared cultural practices (Roepstorff, 2013; 
Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005). Attentional processes are central to this 
enculturation and installation of shared semantic content. In particular, the landscape of 
affordances available to the infant is sculpted, through joint-attentional practices that reflect 
sociocultural norms, into a field of relevant solicitations. Thus, participation in patterned 
practices allows the installation of socially, culturally, and situationally specific expectations, 
which, once acquired, determine agent allocations of attention (the acquisition of abilities) and, 
as a result, guide action-perception.  
 
Joint (and, eventually, shared) attentional processes (Tomasello, 2014) provide a 
central mechanism through which the individual is molded to conform to specific group 
expectations and participate in forms of cooperative action. Joint and shared attention alter the 
field of affordances by directing the agent to engage with specific affordances, marking them 
out as relevant, and making them more salient. Given the nature of the predictive hierarchy, 
that is, to automatically extract statistical information about the distal world in its dynamic 
engagement (in action-perception), the agent will encode the regularities of the solicitations 
that it engages (that is, the relevant affordances to which it is directed in joint and shared 
attention). Of course, local practices of joint and shared attention themselves depend on agents 
sharing sets of expectations—the same expectations that become encoded by agents as they 
participate in these practices. Through participation in patterned cultural practices that direct 
attention in specific ways, the agent acquires sets of expectations that gave rise, in the first 
instance, to (earlier versions of) that very form of cooperative action (see Figure 6). Cultural 
affordances are thus mediated by recursive regimes of shared attention, of which joint-attention 
is a special, signal case (Tomasello, 2014). 
 
The study of everyday social interactions reveals how regimes of joint attention shape 
our understanding and sensory experiences of being in our worlds. For example, Goffman, who 
pioneered studies of face-to-face interaction in modern societies, showed how the 
‘anonymized’, ‘surface character’ of life in cities is routinized through what he called ‘civic 
inattention’—that is, through the many ways in which strangers avert their gazes, avoid 
conversations or physical contact, and reinforce private boundaries in the public sphere 
(Goffman, 1971, p. 385). We can follow Goffman’s lead to consider how different regimes of 
shared and joint-attention mediate lived experiences of meaning and being. Civic inattention, 
for example, is a specific regime of attention, but it is certainly not an absence of attention. In 
Goffman’s ‘Invisible City’ model, attentional resources are mobilized to not pay attention to 

90 
 
certain features of the world, particularly other agents caught in a symbolically-marked game 
of allegiances that renders them strange or invisible.  
 
5.2. Looping the loop: Regimes of shared attention and skilled intentionality  
As we have seen above, in the predictive processing scheme, attention, understood as precision-
weighting of prediction error signals, is a central mechanism behind the dynamical trajectory 
of action-perception. The expectations about precision that guide action-perception are 
acquired in ontogeny and stored as high-level priors, which have the effect of arbitrating the 
balancing act between top-down prediction and bottom-up error signals. It follows that one 
pathway by which cultural affordances may be transmitted is through the manipulation of 
attention. This may occur in a variety of ways including what we might call ‘regimes of shared 
attention’. In the model of affordances outlined above, this kind of attentional modulation 
involves carving a local field of affordances out of the larger landscape of available affordances 
through social practices. Local environments and their associated practices are designed to 
solicit particular patterns of coordinated attention from participants (Clark, 2015; Kirchhoff, 
2015a). In effect, these patterns act as dynamical attractors on the field of affordances, directing 
action-perception in some ways rather than others (Juarrero, 1999).  
 
In this light, one can view social norms and conventions as devices to reduce mutual 
uncertainty, that is, consonantly with the free-energy framework, as entropy-minimizing 
devices (Colombo, 2014). One must know ‘what is in the minds’ of others (such as what one 
would see and how one would interpret another’s action generally and in context) in order to 
make a successful inference (both explicit, content-involving or implicit, correlational 
inferences) about other agents in each situation. Goffman (1971) was hinting a similar 
processes with his comments on the ‘faces’ we learn to perform when we interact with others 
in different situations. We can be a mentor in one situation, and a mentee in another; a father 
in one and a friend in another. In Goffman’s famous comments on interaction in public, he 
describes (using other terms), how certain spaces afford more ‘backstage’, ‘off-screen’ 
performances than others. The privacy of the home affords such relaxed ‘off-stageness’, and 
the bedroom and bathroom even more so. All these instances require inferential mindreading 
or perspective-taking, that is, inferences about the presence or absence of other agents and their 
expectations as a normative guide for how one can behave. None of this depends specifically 
of whether these inferences consist in explicit mindreading or more implicit forms of embodied 
coupled enactments—both are compatible with our framework.

Now, we might suppose that the distinctly human abilities with which we are endowed 
result simply from better evolved predictive machinery, that is, more computationally powerful 
predictive hierarchies (Conway & Christiansen, 2001). However, as we argued above, in 
human ontogeny, it is more likely that affordances are learned through regimes of imitation, 
repetition, positive and negative conditioning, and culturally selective forms of attention 
(Banaji & Gelman, 2013; Meltzoff & Prinz, 2002; Roepstorff & Frith, 2004; Veissière, 2016; 
Whitehouse, 2002; Whitehouse, 2004). The capacity for cultural learning may itself be a 
cultural innovation (Heyes, 2012). Indeed, the feedback or looping mechanisms between 
cultural practices of scaffolding individual attention (what we called regimes of attention) are 
themselves determined by the local ontologies (shared sets of expectations) and abilities 
(acquired patterns of attention and gating) of agents in that community. Repetition and 
reiteration of patterns of social and technological interaction, as well as rewards for ‘correct’ 
inferences that denote an adequate grasp of relevance, prescription, and proscription (e.g., when 
a child ‘gets’ that some X means some Y, or figures out an ‘appropriate’ combination of 
meaningful elements in any given context), come to shape attentional mechanisms in ontogeny, 
and assist the child in successfully inferring a set of rules and categories (the culturally 
sanctioned sets of shared expectations).  
 
Joint attention is usually understood as occurring in a dyad of two people, or between 
agents in direct interactional spheres of communication, gaze-following, finger-pointing, or 
other verbal or non-verbal cues (Tomasello, 2014; Vygotsky, 1978). To address more complex 
social situations, it is useful to revise current sociocognitive models of joint-attention to 
encompass fundamentally triadic situations in which ‘the third’ is the socially constituted niche 
of affordances, supported by local ontologies and abilities. 
 
Shared human intentionality is sufficient to project joint attention to larger groups in 
the process of forming joint goals and inferring from joint expectations. Crucially, it commonly 
takes place without any direct interaction from members, in the many routinized, anonymous, 
symbolically and linguistically mediated forms of sociality, including engagement with social 
institutions.  
 
To go beyond the ‘toy models’ of dyadic joint attention to grasp the process of culture 
transmission we need to study the dynamics of ‘designer environments’ (Goldstone, Landy, & 
Brunel, 2011; Salge, Glackin, & Polani, 2014). Human beings pattern their environments in a 
process of recursive niche construction, which in turn modulates the attributions of attention in 
individual agents, leading them to acquire certain sets of priors rather than others, in what 
Sterelny (2003) has called ‘incremental downstream epistemic engineering’. This incremental 

92 
 
process of constructing our own collective, epistemic niches, involves a kind of bootstrapping 
in which symbolically and linguistically mediated forms of human communication can be 
modeled as forms of re-entrant processing. Linguistically abled human beings produce 
patterned, structured outputs that become part of the material environment, and are 
subsequently picked up and further processed by other agents in ways that stabilize and 
elaborate a local social world (Clark, 2006, 2008). Indeed, human-constructed environments, 
which shape agent expectations and guide patterns of attention, can be viewed as another level 
of the generative statistical model of the niche, which human beings leverage to guide 
intelligent behavior in their sociocultural symbolically- and linguistically-laden niches (Clark, 
2015; Kirchhoff, 2015a). The prior knowledge that is leveraged in action-perception is thus 
encoded in multiple level and sites: in the hierarchical neural networks, in the organism’s 
phenotype (over phylogeny and ontogeny), and in patterned sociocultural practices and 
designer environments. 
 
Thus, our suggestion is that regimes of attention, which mediate the acquisition of 
cultural affordances (both natural and conventional), are enacted through patterned practices 
(especially those which modulate the allocation of attention) and are embodied in sundry ways: 
in the predictive hierarchies of individual agents in a community, as encoded sets of 
expectations, and in the concrete social and cultural world, as constructed human environments, 
designed to solicit certain expectations and direct attention.   
 
6. Conclusion  
We have outlined a framework for the study of cultural affordances in terms of neural models 
of predictive processing and social practices of niche construction. This approach can help 
account for the multilevel forms of affordance learning and transmission of affordances in 
socially and culturally shared regimes of joint-attention and clarify one of the central 
mechanisms that can explain the natural origins of semantic content. The concepts of 
affordance and skilled intentionality in ecological, radical embodied, and enactivist cognitive 
science can be supplemented with an account of the nature of affordances in the humanly 
constructed sociocultural niches. Turning to cultural niche construction, we argued in favor of 
a conception of local ontologies as sets of shared expectations acquired through the immersive 
engagement of the agent in feedback looping relations between shared intentionality (in the 
form of shared embodied expectations) and shared attention (modulated by regimes of 
attention). We elaborated Grice’s account of meaning by highlighting the dependence of 
selective responsiveness to cultural affordances on shared and joint intentionality, modes of 

93 
 
conventionality and social normativity. We ended with an account of the patterned regimes of 
attention and modes of social learning that might lead to the acquisition and installation of such 
ontologies and affordances, leading to agent enculturation and enskillment. We hope that our 
proposal of a framework for the study of cultural affordances will spur further research on 
multilevel, recursive, nested affordances and the expectations on which they depend.

Box 1. Basic concepts of a framework for cultural affordances  
 
Affordance: A relation between a feature or aspect of organisms’ material environment and an 
ability available in their form of life. (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Chemero, 2003, 2009; 
Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014) 
 
Landscape of affordances: The total ensemble of available affordances for a population in a 
given environment. This landscape corresponds to what evolutionary theorists in biology and 
anthropology call a ‘niche’. (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Rietveld, 2008a, 2008c; Rietveld 
et al., 2013; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014) 
 
Field of affordances: Those affordances in the landscape with which the organism, as an 
autonomous individual agent, dynamically copes and intelligently adapts. The field refers to 
those affordances that actually engage the individual organism because they are salient at a 
given time, as a function of the interests, concerns, and states of the organism. (Bruineberg & 
Rietveld, 2014; Rietveld, 2008a, 2008c; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014) 
 
Cultural affordance: The kind of affordance that humans encounter in the niches that they 
constitute. There are two kinds of cultural affordances: natural and conventional affordances.  
 
Natural affordance: Possibilities for action (i.e. affordances), the engagement with which 
depends on the exploitation or leveraging by an organism of ‘natural information’, that is, 
reliable correlations in its environment, using its set of phenotypical and encultured abilities 
(roughly what Grice meant by ‘natural meaning’). (Piccinini, 2015; Piccinini & Scarantino, 
2011) 
 
Conventional affordance: Possibilities for action, the engagement with which depends on 
agents’ skillfully leveraging explicit or implicit expectations, norms, conventions, and 
cooperative social practices in their ability to correctly infer (implicitly or explicitly) the 
culturally specific sets of expectations of which they are immersed. These are expectations 
about how to interpret other agents, and the symbolically and linguistically mediated social 
world. (Satne, 2015; Scarantino, 2015; Scarantino & Piccinini, 2010; Tomasello, 2014)

Abstract:  
The free-energy principle (FEP) is a formal model of neuronal processes that is widely 
recognised in neuroscience as a unifying theory of the brain and biobehaviour. More recently, 
however, it has been extended beyond the brain to explain the dynamics of living systems, and 

108 
 
their unique capacity to avoid decay. The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances 
with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which 
integrates the FEP with Tinbergen’s four research questions to explain biological systems 
across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo 
sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that 
supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide 
to discovery.

In the previous chapter,  
I proposed a theoretical framework, called the cultural affordances framework, to model human 
social and cultural cognition as well as implicit cultural learning in human social groups. More 
specifically, the cultural affordances framework is a mechanistic theory of human enculturation 
and social cognition, the dynamics of which are formulated across spatial and temporal scales; 
i.e., the framework provides a model of the mechanisms, operative at various scales (from that 
of neuronal ensembles to that of cultural dynamics), in virtue of which human agents become 
encultured and acquire the cultural norms and ways of doing things that characterise their niche. 

109 
 
However, the cultural affordances model lacked a principled mathematical account of how the 
components of this multiscale mechanism interact, and remained mostly silent on the ways 
these components are integrated at and across the various spatial and temporal scales at which 
they exist. The purpose of this chapter is to provide precisely such an account of multiscale 
systematic integration.

1. Introduction 
As Schrödinger (1944) famously observed many years ago, living systems are unique among 
natural systems because they appear to resist the second law of thermodynamics by persisting 
as bounded, self-organizing systems over time. How is this remarkable feat possible? What is 
life? How is it realised in physical systems? And how can we explain and predict its various 
manifestations and behaviours? By asking such questions, Schrödinger inspired a new line of 
inquiry that broadly centres on evolutionary systems theory (EST), which has become one of 
the most pervasive paradigms in modern science. Closely related to complexity science, EST 
is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the pioneering efforts of theorists like Fisher, 
Wright, Haldane and Prigogine (Ao, 2005; Fisher, 1930; Sarkar, 1992; Wright, 1932), and 
has found expression in influential models such as Eigen and Schuster’s hypercycles (Eigen 
& Schuster, 1979). Put simply, EST explains dynamic, evolving systems in terms of the 
reciprocal relationship between general selection and self-organisation (Badcock, 2012; 
Depew & Weber, 1995; Kauffman, 1993). 
Originating from biology, general selection entails three interacting principles of 
change: variation, selection, and retention (Caporael, 2001). This Darwinian process not only 
applies to organisms (i.e., natural selection), but acts on all dynamically coupled systems (e.g., 
molecules, neural synapses, behaviours, theories, and technologies; Blackmore, 2000; Cziko, 
1995; Mesoudi, Whiten, & Laland, 2006), and is a universal principle that cuts across both 
statistical and quantum mechanics (Ao, 2008; Campbell, 2016). On the other hand, self-
organisation stems from dynamic systems theory in physics (Haken, 1983; Nicolis & 
Prigogine, 1977; Prigogine & Stengers, 1984), and refers to the emergence of functional, 
higher-order patterns resulting from recursive interactions among the simpler components of 
coupled dynamical systems over time (see Box 1). To date, research in EST has focused on 
complex adaptive systems—such as the brain (Haken, 1996; Kelso, 1995), social systems 
(Miller & Page, 2009), and the biosphere (Levin, 1998)—which adapt to the environment 
through an autonomous process of selection that recruits the outcomes of locally interacting 
components—within that system—to select a subset for replication or enhancement (Levin, 
2003).  
At the turn of the millennium, the principles of EST inspired a new theory in 
neuroscience called the free-energy principle (FEP). Drawn chiefly from statistical 
thermodynamics and machine learning, the FEP is a formal model of neuronal processes that 
was initially proposed to explain perception, learning and action (Friston, 2005; Friston, Kilner, 
& Harrison, 2006b), but has since been extended to explain the evolution, development, form, 

111 
 
and function of the brain (Friston, 2010). More recently, it has also been applied to biological 
systems across spatial and temporal scales, ranging from phenomena at the micro-scale (e.g., 
dendritic self-organisation and morphogenesis; Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 2015; 
Kiebel & Friston, 2011), across intermediate scales (e.g., cultural ensembles; Ramstead, 
Veissière, & Kirmayer, 2016), and at the macro-scale (e.g., natural selection; Friston & Ao, 
2011). We believe that this theory puts us in a strong position to answer Schrödinger’s question, 
and at the same time, shed new light on the mind, body, behaviour, and society.  
We begin by describing how the FEP offers a plausible, mechanistic EST that applies 
to living systems in general. We then combine this variational principle with Tinbergen’s four 
research questions in biology to describe a new scientific ontology—called variational 
neuroethology—that can be used to develop mathematically tractable, substantive explanations 
of living organisms. We conclude by applying this meta-theory to the most complex living 
system known to date—namely, ourselves—before translating this framework into a 
systematic research heuristic. In doing so, we hope to highlight a plausible, computationally 
tractable guide to discovery in the biological, cognitive and social sciences. 
 
2. The free energy formulation 
The FEP is a mathematical formulation that explains, from first principles, the characteristics 
of biological systems that are able to resist decay and persist over time. It rests on the idea that 
all biological systems instantiate a hierarchical generative model of the world that implicitly 
minimises its internal entropy by minimising free energy. In virtue of the self-organisation 
inherent in nonequilibrium steady-state, systems will apparently violate the second law of 
thermodynamics. See Ao, Chen, and Shi (2013) for an interesting treatment of relative entropy 
in this context (that does not require detailed balance assumptions). From our perspective, this 
sort of behaviour can be cast in terms of a dynamics (i.e., conservative flow) that appears to 
minimise a variational free energy, which constitutes an upper bound on the entropy of a 
system’s Markov blanket (see Friston (2013) and Box 2). Technically, free energy is an 
information theoretic quantity that limits (by being greater than) the entropy of sensory 
exchanges between a biotic system (e.g., the brain) and the environment. A generative model 
is a probabilistic mapping from causes in the environment to observed consequences (e.g., 
sensory data); while entropy refers to the (long-term) average of surprise (or surprisal)—the 
negative log probability of sensory samples encountered by an agent (Friston, 2010). Under 
this formalism, for an organism to resist dissipation and persist as an adaptive system that is 
part of, coupled with, and yet statistically independent from, the larger system in which it is 

112 
 
embedded, it must embody a probabilistic model of the statistical interdependencies and 
regularities of its environment. We elaborate on this next. 
 
2.1. Living systems, ergodicity, and phenotypes 
All biological systems exhibit a specific form of self-organisation, which has been sculpted by 
natural selection to allow them to actively maintain their integrity by revisiting characteristic 
states within well-defined bounds of their conceivable phase spaces (see Box 1). In other 
words, there is a high probability that an organism will occupy a relatively small, bounded set 
of states—its viability set (Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014)—within the total set of possible states 
that it might occupy (i.e., its phase space). In terms of information theory, this means that the 
probability density function that describes the possible states of the system has low entropy. 
So, how do living systems perform this feat?  
This is simpler than it might seem, and rests on the fact that all living systems revisit a 
bounded set of states repeatedly (i.e., they are locally ergodic). At every scale—from the 
oscillations of neuronal activity over milliseconds, through to the pulsations of our heart and 
our daily routines—we find ourselves in similar states of mind and body. This is the remarkable 
fact about living systems. All other self-organising systems, from snowflakes to solar systems, 
follow an inevitable and irreversible path to disorder. Conversely, biological systems are 
characterised by a random dynamical attractor—a set of attracting states that are frequently 
revisited. Indeed, the characteristics by which we define living systems are simply statements 
about the characteristic, attracting states in which we find them (Friston, 2013). This set of 
attracting states can be interpreted as the extended phenotype of the organism—its morphology, 
physiology, behavioural patterns, cultural patterns, and designer environments (Clark, 2013). 
This conception of the extended phenotype as the set of attracting states of a coupled dynamical 
system is supported by evidence from simulation studies of morphogenesis, (e.g., Friston et al., 
2015). Further supportive evidence comes from studies of cancer genesis and progression, 
where the success of approaches employing endogenous networks provides a striking example 
of employing statistical methods (the Markov blanket formalism) to separate internal 
(phenotypical) states from external ones (Yuan, Zhu, Wang, Li, & Ao, 2017). This conception 
of the topology of the phase space is supported by recent work on early myelopoiesis in real 
biological systems as well (Su et al., 2017). In this study, the core molecular endogenous 
network under consideration was cast as a set of dynamical equations, yielding structurally 
robust states that can be interpreted in relation to known cellular phenotypes. 

113 
 
The implications of this are profound. It means that all biotic agents move, 
systematically, towards attracting states (i.e., those with high probability) to counter the 
dispersive effects of random fluctuations. Consequently, any living system will appear, on 
average, to move up the probability gradients that define its attracting set—and the very 
characteristics responsible for its existence. Thus, living systems do not just destroy energy 
gradients (by gravitating towards free energy minima), they also create and maintain them by 
climbing the probability gradients that surround such extrema. In other words, living systems 
carve out and inhabit minima in free energy landscapes, precluding the dissipation of their 
states over phase space. This (nonequilibrium steady-state) behaviour differentiates living 
states from other states, like decay and death (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Jarzynski, 1997; 
Schrödinger, 1944; Tomé, 2006). Technically, this gradient-building behaviour can be 
expressed as the flow over a landscape that corresponds to the log probability of any state being 
occupied. This probability is also known as ‘Bayesian model evidence’ (Friston, 2010). This 
means living systems are effectively self-evidencing—they move to maximise the evidence of 
their existence (Hohwy, 2016). So how do they achieve this? 
This is where the FEP comes in. It asserts that all biological systems maintain their 
integrity by actively reducing the disorder or dispersion (i.e., entropy) of their sensory and 
physiological states by minimising their variational free energy (Friston (2010); see Figure 1 
and Box 2). Because the repertoire of functional or adaptive states occupied by an organism is 
limited, the probability distribution over these characteristic states has low entropy: there is a 
high probability the organism will revisit a small number of states. Thus, an organism’s distal 
imperative of survival and maintaining functional states within physiological bounds (i.e., 
homeostasis and allostasis) translates into a proximal avoidance of surprise (Friston, 2010). 
Although surprise itself cannot be evaluated, since free energy imposes an upper bound on 
surprise, biological systems can minimise surprise by minimising their variational free energy. 
From the point of view of a physicist, surprise corresponds to thermodynamic potential energy 
(Seifert, 2012), such that minimising (the average) variational free energy entails the 
minimisation of thermodynamic entropy. Consistent with EST, this propensity to minimise 
surprise is the result of natural selection (that itself can be seen as a free energy minimising 
process; see below)—self-organising systems that are able to avoid entropic, internal phase-
transitions have been selected over those that could not (Friston et al., 2006b). This begs the 
question of how biological systems minimise free energy. To answer this, we will now take a 
closer look at the relation between surprise and (variational) free energy by introducing the 
notion of Markov blankets, which is central to the variational neuroethology described later.   

114 
 
 
2.2. Free energy, surprise, and Markov blankets 
To understand the subtle but important difference between surprise and free energy, we have 
to look more carefully at what constitutes a system. Clearly, one needs to differentiate between 
the system and its environment—those states that constitute or are intrinsic to the system and 
those that are not. To do this, we have to introduce a third set of states that separates internal 
from external states. This is known as a Markov blanket. Markov blankets establish a 
conditional independence between internal and external states that renders the inside open to 
the outside, but only in a conditional sense (i.e., the internal states only ‘see’ the external states 
through the ‘veil’ of the Markov blanket; Clark, 2017; Friston, 2013). The Markov blanket can 
be further divided into ‘sensory’ and ‘active’ states that are distinguished in the following way: 
internal states cannot influence sensory states, while external states cannot influence active 
states (Friston, 2012). With these conditional independencies in place, we now have a well-
defined (statistical) separation between the internal and external states of any system. A 
Markov blanket can be thought of as the surface of a cell, the states of our sensory epithelia, or 
carefully chosen nodes of the World Wide Web surrounding a particular province.  
With Markov blankets in mind, it is fairly straightforward to show that the internal 
states must—by virtue of minimising surprise—encode a probability distribution over the 
external states; namely, the causes of sensory impressions on the Markov blanket. This brings 
us back to free energy. Free energy is a functional (i.e., the function of a function) that describes 
the probability distribution encoded by the internal states of the Markov blanket. Note that this 
is different from surprise, which is a function of the states of the Markov blanket itself. In other 
words, free energy is a function of probabilistic beliefs, encoded by internal states about 
external states (i.e., expectations about the probable causes of sensory input). When these 
beliefs are equal to the posterior probability over external states, free energy becomes 
equivalent to surprise. Otherwise, it is always slightly greater than (i.e., imposes an upper 
bound on) surprise. This means that living systems can be characterised as minimising 
variational free energy, and therefore surprise, where the minimisation of variational free 
energy entails the optimisation of beliefs about things beyond or behind the Markov blanket 
(see Box 2). This inferential aspect leads us to notions like embodied inference (Bruineberg, 
Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016; Gallagher & Allen, 2016), the Bayesian brain (Knill & Pouget, 
2004), the Bayesian cell (Kiebel & Friston, 2011), and even a Bayesian culture (Friston & 
Frith, 2015; Ramstead et al., 2016).

q  encoded by the internal 
states. (B): Alternative expressions for the free-energy illustrating what its minimisation entails. For action, free-
energy can only be suppressed by increasing the accuracy of sensory data (i.e., selectively sampling data that are 
predicted).  Conversely, optimising internal states make the representation an approximate conditional density on 
the causes of sensory input (by minimising divergence). This optimisation makes the free-energy bound on 
surprise tighter and enables action to avoid surprising sensations. 
 
 
In short, then, how do Markov blankets relate to the FEP? The FEP tells us how the 
quantities that define Markov blankets change as the system moves towards its variational free 
energy minimum (following Hamilton’s principle of least action; see Figure 1 and Box 2). It 
asserts that for a system to resist entropic erosion and maintain itself in a bounded set of states 
(i.e., to possess a generalised homeostasis), it must instantiate a causal, statistical model of its 
eco-niche relation (Conant & Ross Ashby, 1970; Friston, 2013; Friston, 2010; Seth, 2014). In 

116 
 
other words, an organism does not just encode a model of the world, it is a model of the world—
a physical transcription of causal regularities in its eco-niche that has been sculpted by 
reciprocal interactions between self-organisation and selection over time. On the basis of these 
distinctions, we turn next to defining a fully generalizable ontology for biological systems 
based on a multiscale free energy formulation, which we call ‘variational neuroethology’. 
 
3. The big picture: A multiscale free energy formulation 
The crux of our argument is that organisms can be described in terms of a (high dimensional) 
phase space induced by hierarchically nested Markov blankets. In other words, our ontology 
comprises populations of both spatially and temporally nested Markov blankets that occupy 
hierarchically nested regions in the total phase space of living systems. This sort of hierarchical 
organisation is a direct corollary of EST: since specific, functional (global) patterns of 
interacting (local) components need to be selected over competing alternatives to allow 
different levels of (informational, physical, chemical, biological, psychological, and 
sociocultural) organisation to emerge, the hierarchical nesting of Markov blankets instantiates 
Darwinian dynamics, which follows the same laws of statistical (or, strictly speaking, 
stochastic) thermodynamics, but in a nonequilibrium context that leads to self-organisation, 
self-assembly, and selective dynamics (Ao et al., 2013; Badcock, 2012; Friston, 2013; 
Martyushev & Seleznev, 2006).  
 
3.1. Nested Markov blankets 
To picture such hierarchical dynamics, it is useful to introduce the notion of a scale space. Scale 
spaces allow us to observe structures at different spatial scales. Imagine that you took a 
photograph, and then focused in progressively to examine smaller details. As you zoom in, you 
traverse a (spatial) scale space. The notion of a scale space is useful because the increase in 
scale, as we move from one hierarchical level of Markov blankets to the next, necessarily 
entails an increase in spatial scale. However, what were purposeful (i.e., free energy 
minimising) fluctuations at one scale now become fast random fluctuations at the next. This 
means that there is a concomitant increase in temporal scale as we ascend the spatial hierarchy. 
This composition of temporal and spatial scales is evident in the hierarchical organisation of 
the brain (Jung, Hwang, & Tani, 2015; Kiebel, Daunizeau, & Friston, 2008), and more broadly, 
suggests that self-organisation should occupy a limited domain (along the diagonal) of a scale 
space with spatial and temporal dimensions (Haken, 1983) (see Figure 2). Note that the use of 
a scale space is purely for descriptive purposes. The underlying system in question does not 

117 
 
change—just its level of description, the way it is measured, or the perspective taken on its 
hierarchical self-organisation.

Fig. 2. Variational neuroethology. (A) The meta-theoretical ontology we propose, called ‘variational 
neuroethology’, uses the FEP to explain and predict how living systems instantiate adaptive free energy 
minimisation. We have indicated some scales at which free energy minimizing dynamics unfold. Since spatial 
and temporal scales are intrinsically correlated (i.e., events unfolding over long distances usually take more time 
to unfold), what we have is a scale space that is populated mostly along its diagonal (Bak, Tang, & Wiesenfeld, 
1988; Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2002; Mantegna & Stanley, 1995). (B) Equivalence classes of variational free 
energy minimizing systems. The free energy minimising dynamics at play are implemented by different kinds of 
mechanisms in different individual organisms and species, as a function of the coupling between their evolved 
phenotypes and biobehavioural patterns and the niches they inhabit and the scales under scrutiny. The gauge 
theoretical formalism for the FEP (Sengupta, Tozzi, Cooray, Douglas, & Friston, 2016) allows us to 
computationally model the regions of the biotic phase space, along its diagonal, that are apt to realize equivalent 
classes of dynamics. From Sengupta et al. (2016). 
 
Recall from above that every ergodic system must possess an (ergodic) Markov blanket 
(Friston, 2013). This simple observation delivers us to the core of our argument. Thus, we 
should be able to describe the universe in terms of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—and 
Markov blankets all the way up, and all the way down (see Figure 3 and Box 3). To unpack 
this, consider an ensemble of cells, each equipped with a Markov blanket that corresponds to 
the cell surface. Because the internal states of each cell are sequestered behind their respective 
Markov blankets, all interactions between cells must be mediated by their Markov blankets. 
This means that we can describe the self-organisation of the cellular ensemble purely in terms 
of transactions among the (sensory and active) states of Markov blankets. However, these 
exchanges will themselves have a sparsity structure that induces a Markov blanket of Markov 
blankets. For example, one subset of the ensemble could be an organ that is surrounded by 
epithelia that provide a Markov blanket for all of the cells that constitute the internal states of 
the organ. However, this still follows exactly the same (statistical) structure—an ensemble of 
Markov blankets. We can then repeat this process, at increasingly larger scales of self-
organisation, to create a series of hierarchically nested systems (e.g., the body) (Clark, 2017).  
This sort of hierarchical structure provides a universal and recursive perspective to 
understand self-organisation across spatial and temporal scales, and to explain how each level 
contextualises (constrains) the levels both above and below. The hierarchal composition of 
Markov blankets within Markov blankets follows naturally from the existence of a Markov 
blanket that, in turn, is mandated by the existence of any system that can be distinguished from 
its external milieu. The key point here is that at every level, the same variational, surprise-
reducing dynamics must be in play to supply Markov blankets for the level above. As we argue 
below, this idea offers a promising new research heuristic for the biological sciences.  

119 
 
 
Fig. 3. Nested Markov blankets. This schematic illustrates the hierarchical construction of (scale-free) 
compositions of Markov blankets of Markov blankets. The idea here is that particles, cells or subsystems at one 
scale (each comprising a Markov blanket 
( )i
jb
 that enshrouds internal states 
( )i
j

) constitute an ensemble of states 
with a sparse dependency structure, which induces a Markov blanket at the supraordinate scale. This allows one 
to construct Markov blankets of Markov blankets by (i) partitioning the states at one level into a series of internal 
subsets and their Markov blankets and (ii) creating states for the next level by taking mixtures of Markov blanket 
states. Note that the internal states can be ignored when going from one level to the next because they are 
conditionally independent of external states (i.e., mixtures of Markov blankets from other subsystems). The 
mixtures can be regarded as slow (unstable) modes that are referred to as order parameters in synergetics (Haken, 
1983). Filled (cyan) circles correspond to Markov blanket states at the i-th scale, where, as in Figure 1, red denote 
sensory states and blue active states. The pictures (of Broccoli) in the upper panels illustrate the self similarity of 
this recursive partitioning. 
 
 
3.2. Multiscale integration and variational neuroethology 
Above, we suggested that living systems can be described in terms of hierarchically nested 
Markov blankets. The hierarchical interdependencies between Markov blankets provide a 
context for biological phenomena at every scale, which implies that the preservation of Markov 
blankets at a lower scale are necessary for the ongoing conditional independencies that form 

120 
 
the basis of Markov blankets at a higher scale, and vice-versa (see Figure 3 and Box 3). Put 
simply, the existence of every level depends upon every other level. Of particular interest here, 
however, is the importance of the different temporal scales that transcend spatial scales. Strictly 
speaking, free energy is only ever minimised diachronically—that is, over some discrete time 
span—as a process (Kirchhoff, 2015). After all, the FEP is a formulation of the constraints 
imposed on system dynamics: it tells us about the dynamics of living systems that obtain 
precisely because of what it means for physical systems to be alive (Friston, 2012). 
The hierarchical free energy formulation we propose here encompasses the ways in 
which the FEP applies to each hierarchical level of organisation by articulating the 
minimisation of free energy across scales. Any system’s operation or functioning (i.e., a 
particular, time extensive event in our ontology) can be seen as unfolding across spatial scales, 
driven by temporally integrated free energy minimisation dynamics. Because the time average 
of free energy is a Hamiltonian action, all we are saying here is that Hamilton's principle of 
least action (perhaps the most celebrated variational principle) is realised by hierarchically 
nested biophysical processes. Having said this, the assertion that the time average of free 
energy is a Hamiltonian action is non-trivial for general stochastic dynamics, and is still a 
subject of research, i.e., Tang, Yuan, and Ao (2014). Over any given time lapse, free energy 
minimisation can thus be framed as a hierarchical ‘unpacking’, across spatial scales, of the 
same invariant (or scale-free) dynamics. Since spatial and temporal scales are intrinsically 
correlated (i.e., events unfolding over long distances usually take more time to unfold (Bak et 
al., 1988; Dorogovtsev & Mendes, 2002; Mantegna & Stanley, 1995), what we have is a scale 
space that is populated mostly along its diagonal (see Figure 2).  
Framing things in this way allows us to derive a computationally tractable, dynamical 
typology of the scientifically relevant events (types of biotic systems) at each timescale, and 
also to distinguish between different regions in the biophysical phase space, which roughly 
correspond with the ontologies of scientific disciplines concerned with different living systems 
(e.g., biology, psychology and the social sciences; Henriques, 2011). These self-organising, 
variational imperatives remain identical at each level of organisation, but differ fundamentally 
in how they are mediated. For example, the brain uses some form of belief propagation or 
predictive coding to maintain its Markov blanket (Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Rao 
& Ballard, 1999; Srinivasan, Laughlin, & Dubs, 1982), while evolution uses Bayesian model 
selection and stochastic sampling schemes (Ao, 2009; Campbell, 2016; Frank, 2012; Harper, 
2011) to preserve the Markov blankets that underlie speciation at evolutionary timescales.  

121 
 
The notion of Markov blankets allows us to define a formal ontology of living systems. 
Markov blankets are nested within Markov blankets, over spatial and temporal scales. This 
suggests that there has to be an internal (scale-free or scale-invariant) consistency, in the sense 
that the variational free energy associated with a global Markov blanket (e.g., a species) has to 
conform to the same principles as all of its constituent Markov blankets (e.g., phenotypes), 
which applies recursively right down to the level of biological macromolecules. In this vein, 
the FEP has recently been formulated using the resources of gauge theory (Sengupta et al., 
2016); see also the treatment of dynamic systems in Ao (2003). Gauge theory is a family of 
mathematical models that have been broadly applied in physics. The gauge theoretical 
formalism is used to define a Lagrangian, a functional that summarises the dynamics of a given 
system and preserves its global symmetry (see Box 4). This symmetry is broken by local forces, 
invoking a gauge field that restores the system’s symmetry by compensating for these local 
perturbations. The FEP has been proposed as the Lagrangian of a gauge theory for living 
systems (Sengupta et al., 2016). Over any given time scale, free energy is minimised across 
every spatial scale, while local dynamics at each of these scales—determined by local Markov 
blanket features—perturb the Lagrangian. However, these perturbations are then compensated 
for by one or more gauge fields, which are introduced when an organism either changes its 
internal (e.g., perceptual) states or acts upon the world to minimise surprise. The upshot of this 
is that it allows us to computationally model scale-invariant free energy minimisation dynamics 
across temporal and spatial scales. As we ascend nested Markov blankets, and as we consider 
different biological systems, free energy is minimised in dynamically equivalent, but 
mechanistically heterogeneous, ways.  
This brings us to a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems derived from the 
FEP—variational neuroethology—that can be used to explain and predict how living systems, 
at any spatial and temporal scale, instantiate the dynamics of adaptive free energy 
minimisation. The precise nature of free energy minimising mechanisms will vary from 
organism to organism and species to species, as a function of their evolved phenotypes and 
biobehavioural patterns. In other words, the FEP supplies a universal Lagrangian that extends 
across all spatial and temporal scales, but the particular ways in which it is implemented will 
vary according to the species, organisms, and scales under scrutiny. This allows us to 
computationally model the regions of the phase space populated by different organisms—along 
its diagonal—that realise equivalent classes of dynamics, and to recast the issue of ecological 
problem-solving as the problem of finding local free energy minima. At first glance, analysing 
such complex dynamics across time and space might seem intractable, but conveniently, 

122 
 
biologists have long been familiar with a highly compatible framework that allows us to 
translate our variational neuroethology into viable scientific practice.  
 
4. Integrating the multiscale free energy formulation with Tinbergen’s four questions 
In the sciences of life, mind, and society, using free energy minimisation—realised by nested 
Markov blankets—enables us to explain dynamics both at and between nested scale spaces. 
However, although the FEP supplies a powerful, mechanistic theory that captures biological 
dynamics across spatial and temporal scales, it can only offer partial insight into the particular 
features of a given species, which instantiate distinct, embodied models of specific adaptive 
needs and environmental niches (Allen & Friston, 2016; Clark, 2013, 2015). In his treatment 
of Darwinian dynamics, Ao (2005) describes how a complete explanation for any biological 
system requires two types of laws: those that account for the structure of evolutionary dynamics 
(e.g., natural selection); and those that can explain the structure of each dynamical component 
(e.g., genes). We suggest here that the FEP is analogous to the first type of law—it describes, 
formally, the (entropy bounding) dynamics of all living systems. But what of the second type? 
Although it is highly generalizable, the explanatory scope of the FEP is limited—it only 
imposes relatively modest constraints on the classes of dynamical patterns (i.e., complex 
adaptive systems) that count as living. The FEP therefore requires a complementary 
evolutionary (i.e., ultimate) account that explains the specific adaptive solutions responsible 
for producing different embodied models, along with the proximate processes that produce 
every phenotype. Again, this appeals to the importance of timescales when describing the 
dynamic ways in which living systems minimise free energy across space and time.  
Fortunately, the importance of temporal scales has long been recognised in biology, 
particularly after Tinbergen (1963) proposed his four key levels of biological explanation (i.e., 
adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism). Given the success of this explanatory 
framework in biology, we suggest that Tinbergen’s levels of inquiry might be apt to elucidate 
structural laws that supplement the general principles provided by the FEP. Clearly, 
Tinbergen’s ‘four questions’ have a long history of producing detailed explanations for the 
evolution, development, form and function of different species, and by focusing on different 
temporal scales (ranging from a species’ evolution to an organism’s behaviour in real-time), 
they allow us to capture the complexities of every corresponding spatial scale (from sub-atomic 
particles, atoms, and cells, all the way up). Conversely, the FEP furnishes a biologically 
plausible EST that applies both to ultimate and proximate processes, supplying a universal 
principle that intersects all four of Tinbergen’s levels of inquiry. We believe, then, that these 

123 
 
two paradigms are highly commensurate—the FEP describes a biological imperative to model 
the world that constrains the dynamics of all living systems (at any time-scale), while 
Tinbergen has offered a distinctive but complementary framework that allows us to develop 
substantive explanations for the phenotypic traits and behaviours of any given species or 
organism. Accordingly, the variational neuroethology proposed here hinges on their synthesis. 
To exemplify this approach, we turn now to its recent application to the world’s most complex 
living system—us.  
 
4.1. Variational neuroethology applied: Hierarchically mechanistic minds 
The FEP is best known in neuroscience, where it has been used to explain the structure, 
function, and dynamics of the brain. In this context, the FEP concords with predictive coding 
by describing the brain as a hierarchical ‘inference machine’ that minimises prediction error 
by seeking to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down (neuronally-encoded) predictions 
(Clark, 2013, 2015; Friston, 2010; Hohwy, 2016). This occurs in two ways: we can either 
improve our predictions by altering internal states (i.e., perception); or we can act upon the 
world to confirm our predictions (i.e., action). Thus, action and perception operate 
synergistically to optimise an organism’s (Bayesian) model of the environment. As discussed, 
the FEP also transcends predictive coding by extending beyond the brain to explain behaviour, 
the phenotype, and all other biotic phenomena that span evolutionary timescales and spatially 
distributed ensembles. However, to understand the particular features of the human brain, the 
FEP requires recourse to research in psychology and the social sciences (e.g., evolutionary and 
cognitive anthropology), which target the specific ecobiopsychosocial processes responsible 
for the embodied models and behaviour of Homo sapiens in particular. 
To address this need, an interdisciplinary EST of the embodied brain has recently been 
forwarded called the hierarchically mechanistic mind (HMM). Initially proposed to unify 
evolutionary and developmental psychology, the HMM is an evidence-based model of 
neurocognition and biobehaviour that synthesises the FEP with major paradigms in psychology 
to situate the brain within the broader evolutionary, developmental, and real-time processes 
that produce human behaviour, phenotypes, and niches (Badcock, 2012; Badcock, Davey, 
Whittle, Allen, & Friston, 2017). Specifically, this model defines the human brain as an 
embodied, complex adaptive system that adaptively minimises the entropy of its internal (i.e., 
sensory and physiological) states through recursive interactions between hierarchically 
organized, functionally differentiated neural subsystems (Badcock, 2012). This hierarchy 
ranges from lower-order, highly segregated neurocognitive systems responsible for 

124 
 
sensorimotor processing, through to the highly integrated association areas that underlie the 
sophisticated cognitive faculties unique to humans (Badcock et al., 2017). The HMM resonates 
with structural and functional imaging studies in network neuroscience, which show that the 
brain entails a multiscale hierarchical organisation characterised by the repeated encapsulation 
of smaller neural elements in larger ones (Kaiser, Hilgetag, & Kötter, 2010; Park & Friston, 
2013; also see Figure 4, panel A). Predictive coding approaches suggest that this sort of 
architecture entails a hierarchical generative model that minimises prediction error via 
recurrent message-passing between cortical levels (Figure 4, panel B), affording a 
neurobiologically plausible, mechanistic theory of the functional integration of anatomically 
segregated neural networks (Bastos et al., 2012; Park & Friston, 2013; Shipp, 2016).

networks. Neural networks are composed of nodes and their connections, called edges. A node, defined as an 
interacting unit of a network, is itself a network composed of smaller nodes interacting at a lower hierarchical

regions. From Park and Friston (2013). (B) A simple cortical hierarchy with ascending prediction errors and

control (blue) of superficial pyramidal cells determines their relative influence on the deep pyramidal cells that 
encode expectations by modulating their precision. From Friston, Stephan, Montague, and Dolan (2014). (C): The

dynamics vary across timescales, ranging from neurocognition in real-time (i.e., perception and action; learning 
and attention); neurodevelopment throughout the lifespan; epigenetic mechanisms that minimise free energy 
across generations (e.g., kin); and the process of adaptation, which involves the optimisation of human generative 
models over time and conspecifics via the inheritance of adaptive priors (Friston, 2011). These temporal processes 
are captured by Tinbergen’s four levels of inquiry, which appeal to a dynamic causal hierarchy that is encapsulated 
by complementary paradigms in psychology: evolutionary psychology; evolutionary developmental approaches; 
developmental psychology; and the psychological subdisciplines (Badcock, 2012; Badcock et al., 2017) 
 
 
Following EST, the hierarchical brain also exemplifies the complementary relationship 
between evolution and development—selection has canalized early sensorimotor regions that 
serve as neurodevelopmental anchors, allowing for the protracted, activity-dependent self-
organisation of ‘domain-general’ association cortices throughout development that enhance 
evolvability by responding flexibly to environmental change (Anderson & Finlay, 2014; 
Buckner & Krienen, 2013). Consistent with this, simulation studies of evolving networks have 
shown that a hierarchical neural structure enhances evolvability by adapting faster to new 
environments than non-hierarchical structures (Mengistu, Huizinga, Mouret, & Clune, 2016). 
The hierarchical segregation of neural networks into distributed neighbourhoods has also been 
found to stretch the parameter range for self-organized criticality by allowing subcritical and 
supercritical dynamics to co-exist simultaneously (Hilgetag & Hütt, 2014), which optimizes 
information processing and is therefore likely to be favoured by selection (Hesse & Gross, 
2014). Maturational studies of neural networks throughout childhood and adolescence have 
further revealed that human cortical development mirrors phylogeny, progressing from the 
sensorimotor hierarchies found in all mammals through to recent association areas shared by 
humans and other primates (Gu et al., 2015). The phylogeny of the brain is also reflected across 
nested levels of neurophysiological organisation, ranging from genes and transcription factors 
through to synaptic epigenesis and the long-range connectivity that is thought to underpin 

128 
 
consciousness (Changeux, 2017). It is unsurprising, then, that a hierarchical neural structure 
has been found in every mammal examined to date (Finlay & Uchiyama, 2015).   
The HMM rests on two assumptions. First, it subsumes the FEP as a biologically 
plausible EST of the evolution, development, form, and function of the brain. The FEP suggests 
that instead of just encoding a model of the world, the brain itself manifests a (hierarchical) 
phenotypic transcription of causal structure in its environment (i.e., an embodied statistical or 
generative model) that is optimized by evolution, development, and learning. Here, selection 
is simply nature’s way of performing Bayesian model optimisation by minimising the 
(variational) free energy of human phenotypes across different (Tinbergian) timescales (Figure 
4, panel C). Emphasis is placed on adaptive priors, which are (epi)genetically-specified 
expectations that have been shaped by selection to guide action-perception cycles toward 
adaptive or unsurprising states (Friston, 2010).  
The second assumption follows EST in psychology by recognising that the brain is an 
emergent sub-system produced by a hierarchy of causal mechanisms that act on the brain-body-
environment system over time (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism; 
Badcock, 2012; Kirchhoff, 2015, 2016). This causal hierarchy is recapitulated by major 
paradigms in psychology—which focus differentially on Tinbergen’s (1963) four questions 
(Figure 4, panel C)—and calls for sophisticated, multiscale hypotheses that synthesise the FEP 
with different research programs in psychology and anthropology to explain both why a 
particular trait is adaptive, along with how it emerges from intergenerational, developmental, 
and real-time processes (Badcock, 2012; Badcock et al., 2017). The FEP and EST in 
psychology can therefore be regarded as different sides of the same coin—the FEP supplies a 
fully generalizable mechanistic theory of neural structure and function that applies to species 
generally, while an evolutionary systems approach to psychology builds upon the FEP by 
providing a substantive, evolutionary framework that is capable of explaining how the FEP 
manifests in Homo sapiens (Badcock, Ploeger, & Allen, 2016). 
 
4.2. Translating variational neuroethology into research heuristics 
The HMM is not just a second-order theory derived from variational neuroethology; it can also 
be translated into a multidisciplinary research heuristic that promotes a tripartite approach to 
scientific inquiry (Badcock et al., 2017). First, it calls for integrative, multilevel hypotheses in 
psychology that address all four of Tinbergen’s questions by synthesising research across 
evolutionary psychology, biological and cognitive anthropology; evolutionary developmental 
biology and psychology; developmental psychology; and psychological sub-disciplines such 

129 
 
as cognitive, social, biological and personality psychology (Figure 4, panel C). Second, it 
requires an analysis of how the phenomenon of interest can be explained in terms of the FEP. 
Finally, it calls for empirical research into the ways in which the phenomenon is 
neurophysiologically instantiated in a dynamic, hierarchical manner and manifests 
behaviourally via active inference (Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 
2016). Although this synergistic approach to developing hypotheses is undoubtedly complex 
and remains in its infancy, it has already furnished important new insights into depression 
(Badcock et al., 2017), and yields distinct implications for neuroscientists and psychologists 
alike, while creating new avenues for collaborative research. This variational neuroethology of 
human systems has the major methodological advantage of conferring bona fide predictive 
power to the biological, cognitive, and social sciences. We can use simulation studies to predict 
which solutions will be adopted to respond adaptively to a given ecological problem, and then 
compare these computational models with empirical data.  
For neuroscientists, the HMM lends itself to multimethod approaches that explore how 
detectable regularities in measurements of the brain can be explained by the psychological 
factors responsible for different patterns of neural activity in different contexts (Anderson, 
2014). One way to isolate these factors is to use large databases of task-based fMRI activation 
studies to characterize the functional fingerprints of specific neural regions across different task 
demands (Anderson, 2014), while another is to use such datasets or combine functional 
activation studies with neuropsychological lesion-deficit models to derive cognitive ontologies 
that systematically map relationships between specific cognitive functions and hierarchical 
neural dynamics (Poldrack, 2010; Price & Friston, 2005). More broadly, the HMM also 
encourages the uptake of traditional methods in psychology—such as observational data 
collection and interviews—to explore the intersections between mind, brain, and behaviour 
(Badcock et al., 2017). Approaches in developmental psychology can be used to explore the 
dynamic ways in which human development differentiates (error-minimising) neurocognitive 
and biobehavioural patterns between individuals (Badcock et al., 2017), while comparative, 
cross-cultural, computational and dynamical approaches in evolutionary psychology and 
cognitive anthropology can elucidate the (epi)genetic mechanisms that underlie our species-
typical adaptive priors (Badcock et al., 2016; Henrich, 2015; Ramstead et al., 2016; Tomasello, 
2014). Finally, dynamical methods such as computer simulations and computational models 
enable us to directly examine how such levels of causation interact (Chiel & Beer, 1997; 
Frankenhuis, Panchanathan, & Clark Barrett, 2013; Friston et al., 2014), allowing 
neuroscientists to discover how the phenomena highlighted by psychologists reflect adaptive 

130 
 
free-energy 
minimisation 
under 
different 
(evolutionary, 
developmental 
and 
ecobiopsychosocial) conditions. The outcomes of such analyses might then be confirmed 
through experimental research, potentiating a fruitful dialectic between computational analyses 
and real-world observations.  
On the other hand, the FEP offers a neurobiologically plausible EST of the mind and 
biobehaviour to psychologists. It has already been fruitfully applied to a wide range of 
psychological phenomena (Clark, 2015; Hohwy, 2014), extending from emotion (e.g., Joffily 
& Coricelli, 2013), anxiety (e.g., Hirsh, Mar, & Peterson, 2012) and depression (e.g., Badcock 
et al., 2017), through to autism (e.g., Van de Cruys et al., 2014), illusions (e.g., Hohwy, 
Roepstorff, & Friston, 2008) and psychosis (e.g., Corlett, Frith, & Fletcher, 2009). The FEP 
also lends itself to methods that are highly familiar to psychologists, such as the P300; a 
psychophysiological measure that captures temporal fluctuations in surprise (Nieuwenhuis, 
Aston-Jones, & Cohen, 2005). Finally, since it can be equally applied across all four of 
Tinbergen’s research questions, the FEP casts new light on the reciprocal interplay of ultimate 
and proximate processes; stands to benefit both evolutionary and developmental psychologists; 
and proffers a common, transdisciplinary language to unite psychology’s sub-disciplines 
(Badcock, 2012; Badcock et al., 2017). 
However, if human phenotypes can only be understood by analysing the ecology from 
which they emerge, how might the HMM incorporate sociocultural influences—arguably our 
most influential selection pressure to date (Byrne & Whiten, 1988; Henrich, 2015; Tomasello, 
2014)? A promising way to address this question is to incorporate recent work on cultural 
affordances. According to this perspective, cultural ensembles minimise free energy by 
enculturing their members so that they share common sets of precision-weighting priors 
(Ramstead et al., 2016). Human beings—with our specific forms of neural organisation, 
phenotypes, evolved behavioural tendencies and sociocultural patterns—minimise more free 
energy across spatial and temporal scales than any other species. Arguably, this is because we 
have crossed the ‘evolutionary Rubicon’: our survival depends on our ability to access and 
leverage cultural information and immersively participate in culturally adapted practices 
(Henrich, 2015). This is just another coordinated set of nested spatial and temporal scales in 
the greater Markov blanket of Homo sapiens. Another scale to consider—which we share with 
other animals like beavers and bees—is the free energy minimisation accomplished by designer 
environments (Clark, 2015). Although the ways in which the HMM might be extended to 
incorporate cultural affordances remains an open question, a promising avenue would be to 
explore approaches in scientometrics. Using science as the subject of its inquiry, this discipline 

131 
 
incorporates a wealth of models and quantitative techniques (e.g., citation and text analyses) 
that can be used to analyse how general selection and self-organisation act upon theorizing and 
research to reduce uncertainty about the environment (Leydesdorff, 1995, 2001). This affords 
a promising means to explore how the sociocultural generative models instantiated by different 
disciplines optimise (scientific) model selection by minimising free-energy (i.e., scientific 
prediction errors) over time (Badcock, 2012; Clark, 2013).  
Ultimately, the HMM and theory of cultural affordances both rely on the idea that the 
Markov blanket of Homo sapiens possesses hierarchically nested temporal and spatial 
dimensions. These models both appeal to a scientific meta-theory (i.e., variational 
neuroethology) that defines Homo sapiens as each individual (phenotype) throughout the 
course of evolution, along with every individual that has either existed in the past or occupies 
the present (i.e., our species)—who may, in turn, alter the course of our evolution and our 
characteristically adapted niches. This is just another way of saying that the Markov blanket 
constituted by a single phenotype is dynamically nested within the global Markov blanket of 
our species (extending across all of Tinbergen’s temporal scales). Conveniently, this approach 
also allows researchers to navigate the recursive complexities of the spatial axis (from 
biological macromolecules all the way up). By placing our Markov blanket around Homo 
sapiens, we necessarily encapsulate all of the dynamic, lower-level processes responsible for 
producing every phenotype, while imposing a clear upper limit on the complex adaptive system 
under scrutiny. Although the human Markov blanket is nested within the broader dynamics of 
other global Markov blankets that extend out into the universe, these lie beyond the limits of 
the system that this ecobiopsychosocial framework endeavours to explain. 
 
5. Concluding remarks 
The purpose of this article was to answer Schrödinger’s question – ‘what is life?’ – by 
presenting 
a 
hierarchical 
multiscale 
free 
energy 
formulation—called 
variational 
neuroethology—that offers the sciences of life, mind, behaviour and society with a principled, 
computationally tractable guide to discovery. Arguably, the FEP affords a unifying perspective 
that explains the dynamics of living systems across spatial and temporal scales. The ontology 
for biological systems discussed here entails a multidimensional phase space populated by 
events (i.e., living systems as adaptive, self-organising patterns) that depend on the temporal 
dynamics of free energy minimisation. These events can be described as spatially and 
temporally nested Markov blankets, the dynamics of which are summarised by the Lagrangian 
of the FEP. Synthesising this framework with Tinbergen’s four questions allows us to frame 

132 
 
our scientific investigations with clearly defined temporal and spatial bounds, depending on 
the specific questions we wish to answer. We have described an empirically supported 
exemplar of this approach in the cognitive and behavioural sciences—the HMM—and shown 
how this theory yields unique and promising avenues for interdisciplinary research. The 
challenge, of course, lies in translating theory into productive scientific practice, and in testing 
the current limits of the FEP by applying it to species without a brain, like E. coli, fungi and 
flora.

Supplementary Information Box 1. Dynamical systems theory. 
Evolutionary systems theory (EST), the ambient meta-theory that frames the free energy 
formulation, subsumes dynamical systems theory (DST). DST is a mathematical formulation 
of systems dynamics. Living systems have been productively modelled using the resources of 
DST, and so a few of the central concepts borrowed from DST by EST should be explicated. 
The core feature of dynamicist approaches is their emphasis on dynamics that unfold over time. 
The free energy formulation shares its dynamicist commitments with closely related 
approaches in cognitive neuroscience and psychology: the ecological and enactive approaches 
to cognition and behaviour. Indeed, the free energy formulation has been proposed as a 
computationally-tractable, mathematical formulation of enactivism from first principles (Allen 
& Friston, 2016; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Friston, 2013; Kirchhoff, 2015, 2016). For 
example, all the process theories that follow from the FEP, from predictive coding through to 
the belief propagation in decision-making, rest explicitly on formulating neuronal dynamics as 
a gradient descent on variational free energy (Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & 
Pezzulo, 2017). 
 
Dynamical systems are mathematical models that are used to represent physical systems 
with temporally extended dynamics. These dynamics are expressed as systems of (ordinary, 
stochastic or random) differential equations that describe trajectories or paths through phase 
space. They are defined over states of the system and their flow depends upon the current value 
of the system states. The analytic intractability of some of these systems of equations led to the 
development of qualitative methods to study dynamical systems. The strategy here is to 
qualitatively describe the dynamical evolution of a system by describing the abstract space of 
all of its possible states. A ‘phase space’ is an abstract representation of all the possible states 
of a system. It is an n-dimensional (usually metric) space, where each dimension corresponds 
to a state variable of the system (e.g., position, velocity, etc.). A point in this n-dimensional 
phase space is an n-tuple that can be interpreted as assigning a value to each variable along 
each dimension. Because a point in the phase space of a dynamical system specifies a value for 
every variable of the system, any given point in this space represents a complete description of 
the system at a given instant.  
 
How does this help us analyse the dynamics of a system? In dynamical systems theory, 
time is represented not as a separate dimension, but as a dynamical trajectory or sequence of 
states through the phase space. This trajectory is determined by the topology of the phase space, 

134 
 
which translates the constraints to which the system is subject. That is, the topology of the 
phase space translates the system of differential equations that govern the dynamics of the 
system being studied, usually in terms of attracting sets, manifolds or orbits (Arnold, 2003; 
Beer, 1995; Crauel & Flandoli, 1994; Freeman, 1994). 
 
DST has especially been employed to understand self-organisation. Self-organisation 
is ubiquitous is nature: weather patterns, like rainstorms and lightning, emerge spontaneously; 
fluids crystallize to form structured lattices; bubbles arise in sea foam, and pop. This occurs 
because the spontaneous emergence of self-organized dynamics increases the efficiency of 
energy gradient dissipation and entropy production within that system (i.e., it increases its 
internal order). Self-organised dynamics emerge around an energy gradient, and optimise the 
flow of energy in the system about that energy gradient, until the system succumbs to decay 
(England, 2013). DST provides qualitative and computationally tractable formalisms to model 
such self-organising dynamics.

Supplementary Information Box 2. Variational inference and the free energy 
formulation. 
Organisms do not have access to the ‘true’ probabilistic contingencies that describe the entire 
organism-niche system, that is, the actual relations of dependencies between environmental 
states and states of the organism. After all, the biotic system itself is ‘hidden’, as it were, behind 
a Markov blanket, which endows it with statistical independence from random fluctuations and 
other influences from the ‘outside’. However, it does have access to quantities that define the 
variational free energy, and it can leverage the gradients defined by the free energy landscape 
to resists entropic erosion, through the process of ‘active inference’ (Friston, Kilner, & 
Harrison, 2006a; Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel, 2010). Here, the organism’s action-
perception cycles can be seen as self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016); that is, as producing evidence 
that allows it to infer its own existence.  
 
Self-evidencing and variational inference 
Formally, we can model this behaviour using the variational methods that were first developed 
by Feynman (1972), and are now widely used in statistical mechanics and machine learning 
(Dauwels, 2007; Hinton & Zemel, 1993; MacKay, 1995; Wallace & Dowe, 1999). In the 
context of the free energy formulation, the internal states of the organism (i.e., internal states 
of the Markov blanket) are formally described as encoding a ‘variational’ density, which comes 
to approximate the ‘true’ (posterior) probability density that is embodied by the organism-niche 
system, namely, through gradient descent on the free energy landscape. This warrants further 
explication.  
 
Because living systems are inferentially secluded behind their Markov blanket, the 
causes of their sensory states are represented using surrogate or fictive variables, , which 
represent the system’s ‘best guess’ as to the cause of its input. As such, on the free energy 
formulation, the internal states of the organism encode or embody a ‘variational density’, which 
represents the organism’s ‘best guess’ as to the causes of its sensations through cycles of free 
energy minimisation (a.k.a. active inference).  
 
The ensuing formalism draws on approximate Bayesian inference (e.g., variational 
approaches in machine learning). When the computation of a posterior probability scheme 
becomes intractable in Bayesian inference (e.g., due to high dimensional and nonlinear 
generative models), a common strategy is to approximate the ‘true’ posterior density over the 
model parameters with a simpler variational density, whose sufficient statistics can be 

136 
 
optimised easily. Usually, this involves something called a mean field approximation in which 
a high dimensional posterior density is approximated with a product of marginal densities. 
These marginal densities then minimise variational free energy by passing messages (sufficient 
statistics) to each other. When this variational message passing is cast as a gradient descent on 
variational free energy, we obtain a DST version of approximate (variational) inference. 
 
In the present (general) setting, the variational density is defined as a probability 
density, q, that is encoded or parameterized by internal states 
( )t

of the system of interest, 
which is itself bounded by a Markov blanket and subject to free energy minimising dynamics. 
Thus, the internal states of the system induce a variational density over external states ( )t

. 
This is a consequence of the formulation of the free energy as surprise plus divergence. This 
means that when the variational free energy functional is minimised, the divergence disappears 
and the variational density becomes the posterior density. At the same time, the variational free 
energy approximates surprise or (negative) log Bayesian evidence. 
 
Active inference and variational free energy 
So, although the organism cannot access the true posterior density (or surprise), it can 
nonetheless evaluate the variational free energy, because this quantity is a function of two 
quantities which it can access: the variational density that it encodes (which is parameterised 
by its internal states) and the sensations or sensory states of the Markov blanket that are 
contingent upon action. This brings us to a crucial observation. The only way we can actually 
change surprise is by changing the sensory states through action. This means to minimise 
surprise through minimising variational free energy, we need to change our internal states to 
make the free energy a good proxy for surprise and then we need to act to change our sensory 
states to actually reduce surprise. If we do this for long enough, the expected surprise or entropy 
of our sensory exchanges will be minimised (i.e., model evidence will be maximised) and we 
will be locally ergodic and self-evidencing. This is ‘active inference’. 
 
The generative models that define free energy are probabilistic models of the eco-niche 
relation, the dynamical relation that couples the organism to its niche. The generative model is 
usually expressed as the joint probability of sensory states, s(t), and their causes, (t), in the 
(external) environment. This joint probability is usually expressed in terms of a likelihood 
p(s(t)|(t)) and prior beliefs p((t)). With this formalism in place, one can say the variational 
density – that is parameterised by internal states – is encoded or embodied by the internal states 
of the system. Conversely, we can say the generative model is entailed by the existence of a 

137 
 
system equipped with a Markov blanket. Equivalently, we can also say that the generative 
model is enacted by the entire organism-niche system—that is, the conditional dependencies 
described by the generative model are brought forth in a process that is accomplished by 
exchanges between the organism and econiche.  
 
Ergodicity and active inference 
By virtue of the existence of an attracting or characteristic set of states (the extended 
phenotype), the dynamics of the random dynamical system must be locally ergodic. Living 
systems must maintain their ergodicity in order to remain alive – and thereby engage in some 
form of active inference. On this view, ergodicity is not merely an assumption that underwrites 
any principle of self-organisation. It is a definition of the living, complex adaptive (biological) 
systems we want to characterise. In other words, any system that does not maintain its (local) 
ergodicity cannot, by definition, possess characteristics that can be measured. The ergodicity 
of systems that possess a random dynamical attractor allows us to associate the long-term 
average of self-information or surprisal with the entropy of the probability distribution of 
occupying different states. This means that a tendency to minimise surprisal (or, equivalently, 
to maximise model evidence) is also a tendency to minimise (internal) entropy and thereby 
resist the second law of thermodynamics. In the sense that entropy is formally equivalent to the 
time average of a log probability, it corresponds to a Hamiltonian action. This means that all 
we are saying is that living systems conform to Hamilton's principle of least action, where 
action is entropy. In fact, we are saying a little bit more than this, we are saying that living 
systems conform to Hamilton's principle of least action via active inference – and the implicit 
minimisation of variational free energy. 
 
 
 

138 
 
Supplementary Information Box 3. Nested Markov blankets. 
The ontology that we propose for living systems relies on the notion of nested Markov blankets. 
Markov blankets are a statistical description of dependencies in coupled systems. A Markov 
blanket comprises a set of systems states that separate internal and external states of any given 
system. More specifically, the existence of a Markov blanket entails a conditional 
independence between internal and external states. In turn, the Markov blanket itself can be 
divided into sensory and active states. These are characterized by the following relations: 
internal states cannot influence sensory states, while external states cannot influence active 
states. With these conditional independencies in place, we now have a well-defined (statistical) 
separation between the internal and external states of any system. This is relevant for our 
purposes because it tells us about what does, and does not, constitute a system.  
 
To be equipped with a Markov blanket means the internal states can exhibit a selective 
openness to the outside, but only in a conditional sense. In the terms of dynamic systems theory, 
Markov blankets allow for random dynamical systems that are open to the external 
(environmental) states yet retain their own (statistical) integrity (Friston, 2013). They are open 
precisely to the extent that they exist far from thermodynamic equilibrium, and are permeable 
to fluctuations that originate from the environment. Open systems are open to energy and 
information exchange with their environment. However, internal systems are enclosed, because 
they are segregated (i.e., statistically independent) from external perturbations, and as such, are 
statistically insulated from environmental dynamics. These perturbations could lead to an 
altered topology (or attractor landscape) and an ensuing loss of integrity (phenotype, 
ergodicity). Clearly, then, for the living system to persist, its ergodicity needs to be maintained. 
This is evidenced by the persistence of the Markov blanket and its maintenance through active 
inference (Friston et al., 2016).  
 
Now consider an ensemble of Markov blankets that exchange with each other. Recall 
that free energy is a functional of the beliefs entailed by internal states. However, the states of 
the Markov blanket will, in the ensemble, depend upon other Markov blankets. This means that 
the free energy minimum (when pooled over an ensemble of Markov blankets) necessitates a 
collective inference, in which no individual constituent of the ensemble surprises another. This 
coherence – perhaps mediated by generalised synchrony across Markov blankets – follows 
naturally from the free energy formalism (see Friston et al., 2015, for an example based upon 
cellular interactions in morphogenesis). Put simply, if we all have a common agenda and each 
play our role, fulfilling each other’s expectations, we can collectively minimise surprise and 
maintain our ensemble of Markov blanket – and implicitly a Markov blanket of Markov 

139 
 
blankets. This provides the necessary milieu for each individual to thrive in a surprise-
minimising, uncertainty-reducing sense; which, in turn, enables their brains to minimise free 
energy at the level of neurophysiology—all the way down to macromolecules and quantum 
physics. 
 
This hierarchal composition of Markov blankets of Markov blankets follows naturally 
from the existence of a Markov blanket – the existence of Markov blankets around the system 
of interest is mandated by the existence of any system that can be distinguished from its external 
milieu. A crucial aspect of the hierarchical organisation of nested Markov blankets is that, at 
each level, the internal states are dropped from the game, as it were. In other words, the only 
states of interest—as we are lifted from one level to the next—are the Markov blankets that 
contain all of the necessary information for interactions at each level. Here, the dynamics of 
internal states are absorbed into the random fluctuations that are countered by gradient 
building, surprise minimising, self-evidencing flows. In other words, random fluctuations at 
one level are the inferential dynamics of internal states at the level below. The idea put forward 
in this paper is that as we ascend hierarchical scales, the fast fluctuations of internal states that 
are necessary to preserve the integrity of Markov blankets become fast random fluctuations 
that are averaged away at the scale above. 
 
The hierarchical interdependencies provide a context for phenomena at each scale, 
which implies that the preservation of ergodic Markov blankets, at a lower scale, are necessary 
for the ongoing conditional independencies that form the basis of ergodic Markov blankets at 
a higher scale, and vice-versa. Thus, every level depends upon every other level: the central 
claim is that at every level, the same variational, surprise-reducing dynamics must be in play 
to provide Markov blankets for the next level. We call on this central observation to frame 
important relationships in hierarchical selection and self-organisation.

Supplementary Information Box 4. A gauge-theoretical free energy formulation and 
variational neuroethology  
The ‘intentionality’ or ‘aboutness’ of living systems—that is, the directedness of the organism 
towards a meaningful world of significance and valence—emerges as a natural consequence of 
embedded adaptive systems that satisfy the constraints of the free energy formulation. For a 
living thing to be intentional just means that it entails a generative model (that necessarily 
includes prior beliefs about the way it should behave). To entail a generative model means that 
the organism vicariously enacts or brings forth the conditions that define it as a dynamically 
coupled, complex adaptive system. Put simply: active systems are alive if, and only if, there 
active inference entails a generative model. This makes the generative model of central 
importance to the free energy formulation, since it defines the form of life that an organism is 
seen to enact.  
 
However, our modelling strategies need not be constrained by generative models. The 
nested Markov blanket formalism allows us to define a formal ontology of living systems 
independent of specific generative models. How? Recall that Markov blankets can be nested 
within Markov blankets, over spatial and temporal scales. This suggests that there has to be an 
internal scale-free or scale-invariant consistency: the free energy associated with a global 
Markov blanket (e.g., a species) must conform to the same principles as all of its constituent 
Markov blankets (e.g., phenotypes). This consistency must apply recursively, all the way down 
to the level of biological macromolecules.  
 
The free energy principle has recently been reformulated using the resources of gauge 
theory (Sengupta et al., 2016). Gauge theory is a family of mathematical models that have been 
productively used in nearly all areas of physics, from electromagnetism to relativity and 
quantum mechanics. Gauge theories define a kind of dynamics, based on a Lagrangian, which 
preserves a symmetry or invariant. This symmetry is broken by local forces. In turn, symmetry 
breaking recruits a gauge field, which compensates for the local perturbations, restoring the 
system symmetry.  
 
The free energy functional has been proposed as the Lagrangian of a gauge theory for 
neural and biological systems (Sengupta et al., 2016). Crucially, this means that it is possible 
to mathematically model invariant free energy minimisation dynamics across temporal and 
spatial scales. The gauge theoretical Lagrangian, after all, is constructed to be scale invariant. 
This kind of modelling is less constrained by specific generative models, because it is interested 
in the resolution of local dynamics through the effects of gauge fields (which, here, is 
interpreted as free energy minimisation via active inference). Thus, over any period of time, 

141 
 
the scale-invariant free energy Lagrangian is minimised across spatial scales, recruiting 
different local gauge dynamics as a function of the different local forces. At each scale, the 
local dynamics, determined by local Markov blanket features, perturb the Lagrangian. These 
perturbations are then compensated by gauge fields, which in the free energy formulation are 
achieved through active inference (perception, action, evolution, niche construction, and so 
forth).  
 
This means that we can draw broad equivalence classes between different forms of free 
energy minimisation and thereby connect behavioural patterns that, while isomorphic from the 
standpoint of free energy minimisation, are mechanistically implemented or realised in 
different ways. Thus, the gauge-theoretical formulation allows us to define classes of 
equivalent internal states, patterns of action, and generative models (pitched at different 
temporal and spatial scales) that minimise free energy in systematically or dynamically 
equivalent, but mechanistically heterogeneous, physical systems. The gauge theoretical 
framework suggests that different classes of generative models are able to guide the same (or 
analogous) dynamics, which points towards the possibility of developing a computational 
neuroethology based on the free energy formulation—which we have called ‘variational 
neuroethology’.  
 
Living systems that conform to the principles described here will appear to minimise 
their free energy. However, this minimisation of free energy is not an additional force of nature 
or élan vital. Rather, it is a fictive force, which is ultimately due to the geometry of information. 
The probabilistic landscape over which state transitions for living systems are defined has a 
nontrivial curvature, since they are able to perform gradient descent. For example, in the 
context of predictive coding in the brain, this curvature can be interpreted as attention 
(Sengupta et al., 2016). Living systems are organized such that their (physical) dynamics are 
also, at the same time, coextensive with trajectories over information landscapes. In other 
words, the FEP tells us that for an organism to follow Hamilton’s path of least action simply 
means that it must instantiate (embody and enact) a statistical model of its relation to its niche. 
‘Inference’, then, is just the process whereby mutual information between organism and niche 
increases through generalized synchrony; it is not ‘inference’ in some strong propositional 
sense, but rather, a precise mathematical one (i.e., approximate Bayesian inference).

Abstract:  
This paper addresses the challenges faced by multiscale formulations of the variational (free 
energy) approach to dynamics that obtain for large-scale ensembles. We review a framework 
for modelling complex adaptive control systems for multiscale free energy bounding organism-
niche dynamics, thereby integrating the modelling strategies and heuristics of variational 
neuroethology with a broader perspective on the ecological nestedness of biotic systems. We 
extend the multiscale variational formulation beyond the action-perception loops of individual 
organisms by appealing to the variational approach to niche construction to explain the 
dynamics of coupled systems constituted by organisms and their ecological niche. We suggest 
that the statistical robustness of living systems is inherited, in part, from their eco-niches, as 
niches help coordinate dynamical patterns across larger spatiotemporal scales. We call this 
approach variational ecology. We argue that, when applied to cultural animals such as humans, 
variational ecology enables us to formulate not just a physics of individual minds, but also a 
physics of interacting minds across spatial and temporal scales – a physics of sentient systems 
that range from cells to societies.

In the previous chapter,  
I proposed a novel approach to neuroethology, i.e., the study of adaptive behaviour and its 
control in multiscale living systems, called variational neuroethology (VNE). VNE synthesises 
Tinbergen’s seminal approach to ethology (centred on the analysis of function, phylogeny, 
ontogeny, and mechanism) with a mathematical model of the information-theoretic constraints 
that must be true of any self-organizing cognitive system maintaining itself in nonequilibrium 
steady state; namely, active inference under the free-energy principle. An outstanding issue for 
VNE is the question of how to scale up the framework in a principled manner to the study of 
systems beyond the organismic boundary; that is, the question how to draw the boundaries of 
cognitive systems the dynamics of which unfold at scales beyond, and include, that of the 
organism. The aim of this chapter is to address this issue from first principles. I propose an 
extension of VNE to more general ecological dynamics, called variational ecology (VE). VE 
integrates VNE with a variational approach to ecological niche construction. VE thus provides 
an approach to cognitive ecology that accounts for how hierarchically structured cognitive 
systems – from cells to societies – construct, and align themselves with, their ecological niche.

1. Introduction 
Recent decades have witnessed the emergence of a new project for a physics of the mind. This 
effort has leveraged the constructs, principles, and methods of theoretical and experimental 
physics to investigate and understand what we call sentience and the ‘mind’. At the turn of the 
century, a new evolutionary systems theory of complex adaptive systems was proposed, made 
possible by the advent of computational modeling, variational methods of inference, and 
machine learning: the (variational) free energy principle (FEP) (Friston, 2013; Friston, 2010; 
Friston, Kilner, & Harrison, 2006).  
According to the FEP, the physics of sentient systems follows from the statistical 
mechanics of life. This variational formulation stems from the observation that living systems, 
over time and on average, tend to revisit the same set of attracting or characteristic states. 
These can be cast as the characteristic phenotypic states (and traits) of the organism. The FEP 
explains the dynamics of any random dynamical system that appears to resist decay through 
adaptive action (Friston, 2013; Ramstead, Badcock, & Friston, 2018). Under the FEP, 
organisms engage the environment in a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts; ‘surfing’ up 
probability gradients towards their most probable phenotypic states (Clark, 2015). The FEP 
was originally proposed in computational neuroscience to explain neural dynamics (Friston, 
2005; Friston & Stephan, 2007), where it coheres broadly with predictive coding approaches 
(Dayan, Hinton, Neal, & Zemel, 1995; Knill & Pouget, 2004; Metzinger & Wiese, 2017; Rao 
& Ballard, 1999), and is widely recognized as a unifying theory of the function, structure, and 
dynamics of the brain (Clark, 2013, 2015; Hohwy, 2014; Huang, 2008). It has since been 
extended to explain the dynamics of biological systems within and beyond the brain, ranging 
from the cellular level (Kiebel & Friston, 2011) and action-perception loops (Friston, 
FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2016b), to psychiatry (Adams, Huys, & Roiser, 
2016; Constant, Bervoets, Hens, & Van de Cruys, 2018; Corlett & Fletcher, 2014; Lawson, 
Rees, & Friston, 2014; Redish & Gordon, 2016; Van de Cruys et al., 2014), psychology (Apps 
& Tsakiris, 2014; Badcock, 2012; Badcock, Davey, Whittle, Allen, & Friston, 2017; Hohwy, 
2014) and embodied cognitive science (Bruineberg, Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016), through to 
evolutionary dynamics (cf. Campbell, 2016; Friston, 2011; Friston & Ao, 2011; Friston & 
Stephan, 2007) and, recently, to intersubjective and sociocultural dynamics (Fabry, 2017; 
Friston & Frith, 2015; Kirmayer & Ramstead, 2017; Ramstead, Veissière, & Kirmayer, 2016).  
The FEP has recently been leveraged to furnish a fully generalizable metatheory for 
adaptive behaviour in sentient systems across spatial and temporal scales, called variational 
neuroethology (VNE) (Ramstead et al., 2018). VNE synthesises the FEP with Tinbergen’s 

154 
 
(Tinbergen, 1963) four levels of explanation in biology (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, 
and mechanism) to provide a systematic guide for theorising and research in the sciences of 
life and mind. As a metatheory, VNE comprises two principal components: a multiscale 
theoretical ontology for living systems based on a recursively nested formulation of Markov 
blankets (MBs); and a multidisciplinary research heuristic in the biological and cognitive 
sciences (Carr, 1981). In their response to peer commentaries, Ramstead and colleagues (2018) 
address the promise and limitations of VNE as a heuristic for scientific inquiry, and review its 
scope as a research programme. This paper will complement this discussion by concentrating 
on criticisms of VNE as a multiscale ontology. 
To date, VNE has only provided a principled method of analysing nested and mutually 
constraining biological systems and their complex adaptive dynamics across spatiotemporal 
scales (Carr, 1981; Ramstead et al., 2018). It has yet to offer a way to individuate systems at 
scales beyond that of the organism acting in its environment; e.g., large-scale ensembles such 
as societies or ecosystems that realise free energy bounding dynamics. This issue was cogently 
articulated by Bruineberg and Hesp (2018) and Kirmayer (2018) in their critique of VNE. They 
asked whether the MB formalism leveraged by VNE to individuate systems is adequate for 
modelling phenomena at scales beyond those of a single organism (e.g., sociocultural 
dynamics); since phenomena at these scales may be too transient or not sufficiently robust to 
license the MB formalism (which is defined in terms of conditional independencies in weakly 
mixing random dynamical systems). Could this reflect a fundamental distinction between the 
FEP as an explanatory principle for clearly bounded, ergodic, biological systems, and the 
greater, complementary forces at play that constrain complex adaptive systems in general 
(including groups of organisms and their ecological niches)? Should we restrict the FEP to the 
level of the organism, and then explore how this model connects meaningfully to other key 
concepts in evolutionary systems theory about the agent-niche relation?  
The aim of this paper is to address the challenges faced by VNE with regard to dynamics 
that obtain for large-scale ensembles. Specifically, we review a framework for modelling 
complex adaptive systems for multiscale free energy bounding organism-niche dynamics, 
thereby integrating the modelling strategies and heuristics of VNE with a broader perspective 
on the ecological nestedness of biotic systems. We extend VNE beyond the action-perception 
loops of individual organisms (i.e., active inference, Friston, Daunizeau, & Kiebel, 2009; 
Friston, Rosch, Parr, Price, & Bowman, 2018) by appealing to the variational approach to 
niche construction (VANC) (Constant, Ramstead, Veissière, Campbell, & Friston, 2018) to 
explain the dynamics of coupled systems constituted by organisms and their ecological niche. 

155 
 
We suggest that the statistical robustness of living systems is inherited, in part, from their eco-
niches, as niches help coordinate dynamical patterns across larger spatiotemporal scales. We 
call this approach variational ecology (VE), which subsumes VNE and the VANC7. When 
applied to cultural animals such as humans, VE has the important consequence of allowing us 
to formulate not just a physics of individual minds, but also a physics of interacting minds 
across spatial and temporal scales – a physics of sentient systems that range from cells to 
societies.  
 
2. The variational (free energy) formulation 
The free energy formulation appeals to a statistical conception of life. It rests on the fact that 
on average and over time, living systems endure as bounded, self-organising partitions of 
dynamical systems. In other words, organisms appear to counter dissipative environmental 
perturbations by resisting the weathering effects of entropic decay dictated by the fluctuation 
theorems that hold at nonequilibrium steady-state (Evans & Searles, 2002; Seifert, 2012). 
Technically, biological systems revisit the same set of characteristic states that constitute a 
random dynamical attractor. This attracting set means they have properties that can be 
measured (i.e., they are locally ergodic). Put another way, an organism possesses an attracting 
set of states that it tends to occupy with a much higher frequency than others. The FEP provides 
a formal description of how organisms resist entropic erosion and maintain themselves within 
their phenotypic bounds. More exactly, it describes the dynamics they must exhibit, if they 
possess characteristic or attracting states. 
For an organism to exist as a bounded system means that it must be able to maintain 
itself as a whole. By definition, for a system to exist at all, it must evince a robust form of 
conditional independence with respect to external (non-systemic) states. The variational 
framework addresses the individuation of relevant systems by operationalising the notion of 
conditional independence using the Markov blanket (MB) formalism. For a set of states to be 
enshrouded by a MB means that the dynamics of that system induce a statistical partition of 
its states (Friston, 2013; Palacios, Razi, Parr, Kirchhoff, & Friston, 2017; Ramstead et al., 
2018). A MB is the set of states that statistically isolates (insulates) internal (systemic) from 
external (non-systemic) states, such that changes in internal states are mediated by the states 
                                                 
7 Note that we use the term ‘ecology’ non-technically, to capture the sorts of interactions among 
agents and their environment, leading to intentional behaviour, or ‘mind’. We do not appeal 
directly to the science of ecology, or to human ecology. 

156 
 
of the MB. The MB itself can be partitioned into active and sensory states, which are defined 
by the following relations: internal states do not influence sensory states, and external states do 
not influence active states.  
Now, we should note that the terms ‘active’ and ‘sensory’ are potentially misleading. 
They are only meant to capture relations of statistical dependence between random variables. 
This will be crucial to our argument below, as things that we would not readily describe as 
literally acting or sensing in any meaningful sense can still be captured with this formalism, 
since it entails only a statistical enshrouding of systemic states from external ones, and the 
systematic statistical partition of the whole organism-niche system (Ramstead et al., 2018).  
 
2.1. Active inference and generative models  
To keep the MB in play is not a trivial matter. The FEP explains the emergence and 
maintenance of this existential boundary. Under the FEP, the Markov boundary is dynamically 
enabled by adaptive action. The idea behind the FEP is that the active behaviour of organisms 
maintains them in states of viable, adaptive coupling with their ecological niche. Active 
inference is the process whereby living systems act on the world – and update their internal 
states – so as to embody or encode the statistical structure of their local environment, leading 
to the adaptive control of behaviour (Friston et al., 2009; Friston, Daunizeau, Kilner, & Kiebel, 
2010). In other words, over time and on average, biological systems come to fit their 
environment, via active optimization procedures; e.g., action, perception, and learning (Friston, 
FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2016a). From a developmental perspective, this 
can be cast as phenotypic accommodation and developmental plasticity (Stearns, 1989; West-
Eberhard, 2003).  
Crucially, this functionalist interpretation is underwritten by the gradient flows implied 
by the existence of a random dynamical attractor (and implicit ergodicity). This is fairly 
straightforward to show using either a path integral or Fokker Planck formulation of density 
dynamics; in which the flow of states must climb probability gradients to counter the dispersive 
effects of random fluctuations. When we put the MB in play, the same gradient flows reveal 
an (en)active and adaptive interpretation of active states, which are informed by, and only by, 
sensory and internal states. This follows because the flows of active and internal states are 
special, in the sense that their flow does not depend upon external states. These structured 
dependencies, which necessarily follow from the existence of random dynamical attractors 
with MBs, lead to active inference. 

157 
 
In active inference, active and internal states of the organism's MB can always be 
expressed as minimising or bounding a quantity called variational free energy (see Figure 1). 
We can cast variational free energy as the disattunement between the statistical structure of the 
ecological niche and that of the organism (i.e., its phenotype and behavioural dynamics) 
(Bruineberg et al., 2016; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). Technically, variational free energy is 
a proxy for a quantity called surprise (a.k.a. surprisal), which reflects the improbability of 
finding an organism in some sensory state (technically, surprise is the self-information or 
negative log probability of sensory samples encountered by an agent) (Friston, 2010). The 
organism cannot evaluate this quantity directly. Instead, it (or rather, its behaviour or dynamics) 
bounds a proxy quantity, which is a variational bound on surprise, in the sense that surprise can 
never be greater than this bound. This is variational free energy and is exactly the same quantity 
used in machine learning and variational Bayes (often referred to as an evidence bound). While 
surprise depends only on states of the world, variational free energy depends on a Bayesian 
belief or probability density that is encoded by its internal states. Through active inference, the 
probability densities entailed by organismic (internal) states tune themselves to effectively infer 
the process by which sensory states were generated; i.e., the dynamics of external, unobserved 
states that cause fluctuations in sensory states and are hidden behind the MB.  
 

158 
 
 
Fig. 1. The Markov blanket. These schematics illustrate the partition of states into internal (µ) and hidden or 
external states (η) that are separated by a MB – comprising sensory (s) and active states (a). The upper panel 
shows this partition as it would be applied to action and perception in the brain; where active and internal states 
minimise a free energy functional of sensory states. The ensuing self-organisation of internal states then 
corresponds to perception, while action couples brain states back to external states. The lower panel shows exactly 
the same dependencies but rearranged so that the internal states are associated with the intracellular states of a 
cell, while the sensory states become the surface states of the cell membrane overlying active states (e.g., the actin 
filaments of the cytoskeleton).  
 
 
Under the FEP, to function as a control system for the organism, and ensure it remains 
within phenotypic states, the dynamics (i.e., adaptive behaviour) of the organism entails a 
statistical model (that is, a generative model) of itself acting in its ecological niche. In this 
framework, a generative model is a probabilistic mapping from causes in the environment 
(including, crucially, the actions of the organism itself) to sensory states (observations); while 
the generative process is the actual causal structure that generates sensed consequences from 
external causes that are hidden behind the MB (Friston, 2012). This inference is a necessary 
consequence of gradient flows that minimise variational free energy. This follows because 

159 
 
minimising variational free energy is – mathematically – the same as maximising the evidence 
bound in machine learning and Bayesian statistics. In this instance, the evidence is for a 
generative model entailed by the internal states of a creature – technically, if the internal states 
parameterise a posterior density over external states, then internal (and active) states will 
maximise the evidence for a generative model of external, niche dynamics. Active inference 
therefore means that the dynamics of living systems entails a generative model. The 
optimization of this model corresponds to bounding or minimizing variational free energy, 
which can be summarised as self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016). This notion of self-evidencing 
places the MB centre stage as both an evidentiary and existential boundary. 
In summary, active inference can be cast as the process that confirms and updates 
evidence for the statistical (generative) model that a living system entails and enacts in existing 
– thereby producing evidence for its own existence (Hohwy, 2016). This neatly covers action 
and perception in a folk psychology sense; because internal states cannot, in themselves, 
change sensory states, but they can optimise the probabilistic explanations (i.e. posterior 
probability distributions or Bayesian beliefs) for sensory impressions by minimising variational 
free energy. This has all the look and feel of perception. Conversely, active states cannot change 
posterior beliefs but they can change sensory states; either directly or vicariously via external 
states. This corresponds to action, which is informed by perception. In short, the MB will 
actively seek evidence for its own existence. Over time, the states of the organism (e.g., the 
brain) come to encode the statistical structure of causal regularities in the world, and underwrite 
the generative model – the behavioural control system (cf. Anderson, 2017; Seth, 2014) that 
regulates patterns of interaction with the environment. This sort of slow perception can be 
regarded as learning and is generally associated with plasticity of a developmental or 
experience-dependent sort in internal states that comprise internal structure and connectivity. 
Two recent extensions of the free energy formulation will be the focus of our attention. 
These are variational neuroethology (VNE) (Ramstead et al., 2018) and the variational 
approach to niche construction (VANC) (Constant, Ramstead, et al., 2018). VNE and the 
VANC are about enabling the application of the FEP to phenomena within and beyond the 
brain. These approaches hold the promise of extending the variational (free energy) approach 
to the dynamics of sentient systems (i.e., systems with sensory states) across spatial and 
temporal scales.  
 
 
 

160 
 
3. Variational neuroethology   
VNE provides a framework for modelling the dynamics of sentient systems across the 
spatiotemporal scales they manifest and an explanation or description of their self-organization. 
Formally, VNE provides a principled way of scaling up active inference over: (i) ensembles of 
MBs; and (ii) MBs of MBs. This allows us to formulate an integrative multiscale dynamics that 
link the partial dynamics of phenomena at each scale (see also Clark, 2017). In what follows, 
we speak to the multiscale aspects of MBs and then turn to ensembles of MBs that are coupled 
to each other. 
 
3.1 Multiscale levels of analysis 
VNE synthesises the process theory derived from the FEP (active inference) with Tinbergen’s 
seminal four questions in biology (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism) to 
propose a heuristic guide to research in the sciences of life and mind. Integrating these two 
paradigms allows substantive insights drawn from one to inform and constrain models and 
research in the other – the FEP is a non-substantive principle that can be applied to any 
biological system in general (much like Hamilton’s principle of least action), while Tinbergen’s 
framework can provide substantive explanations for biological phenomena drawn from four 
complementary levels of analysis (Clark, 2004). This heuristic has already inspired an 
interdisciplinary theory of the human brain called the Hierarchically Mechanistic Mind 
(Badcock, 2012; Badcock, Friston, Ramstead, Ploeger, & Hohwy, accepted; Ramstead et al., 
2018). The HMM rests on the idea that the brain is a hierarchically structured, self-organising 
system that has been sculpted by natural selection (Badcock, 2012; Badcock et al., 2017; 
Badcock, Ploeger, & Allen, 2016; Tognoli & Kelso, 2014). It suggests that the dynamics, 
structure, and function of the human brain instantiate an embodied, situated, complex adaptive 
system that actively minimises free energy by generating adaptive action-perception cycles via 
recursive interactions between hierarchically nested, functionally differentiated subsystems 
(Badcock, 2012; Badcock, Friston, & Ramstead, 2019). By synthesising the FEP with 
Tinbergen’s four levels of analysis, this perspective can be reduced to four complementary 
research questions – What is the adaptive function of a phenotypic trait? How does it emerge 
from circular interactions between phylogenetic (resp. intergenerational), ontogenetic and 
mechanistic processes? In what ways does it instantiate the FEP? And how does it manifest in 
hierarchical neural dynamics? This research heuristic has already been leveraged to develop a 
new evidence-based theory of our capacity for depression (Badcock et al., 2017). 

161 
 
On the other hand, VNE entails a multiscale ontology for living systems as well. This 
ontology extends the MB formalism as a method of individuating systems under the FEP. As 
discussed above, a MB is a set of states that separates a system (a set of internal states) from 
external, non-systemic ones, which operationalises the idea that systems only exists per se if 
they are endowed with a robust form of conditional independence. According to VNE, the 
dynamics of living systems can be cast as active inference over recursively nested MBs (see 
Figure 2). Indeed, the MB ontology can be reiterated recursively, such that the MBs at any one 
scale are composed in turn of MBs at the scale above and below – which are also made of MBs, 
and so on, all the way up, and all the way down (Palacios et al., 2017).  
 
 
Fig. 2. Explanatory scope of variational approach. Variational neuroethology leverages the FEP to explain the 
adaptive free energy bounding dynamics of living systems across spatial and temporal scales. Here we indicate 
some of the scales at which these dynamics unfold. Given the intrinsic correlation between spatial and temporal 
scales, the phase space described here is populated mostly along its diagonal. Adapted from Sengupta, Tozzi, 
Cooray, Douglas, and Friston (2016). 
 
 
The key notion here is that in moving from one level or scale of dynamics to the next, 
things not only get bigger, they also get much slower. The basic idea is that the states at one 

162 
 
scale constitute microscopic states that can be partitioned into an ensemble of MBs. To move 
to the higher scale, one treats each MB as an entity (e.g., particle) and summarises its dynamics 
with mixtures of blanket states that fluctuate slowly. In this multiscale setting, a (effective) 
state at any scale becomes the expression of an eigenmode of blanket states; namely, the 
principal eigenvectors of their Jacobian (i.e., rate of change of flow with respect to state). These 
mixtures are formally identical to order parameters in synergetics that reflect the amplitude of 
slow, unstable eigenmodes (Haken, 1983). In terms of centre manifold theory, they correspond 
to solutions on the slow (unstable or centre) manifold (Carr, 1981; Davis, 2006). In short, the 
MB of a system (or particle), at any scale, constitutes an ensemble whose order parameters 
subtend blanket or internal states at the scale above. Note that the constituent (microscopic) 
states of an ensemble are always blanket states, although their order parameters could be 
blanket states or internal states at the (microscopic) scale above. This follows from the fact that 
the only states ‘that matter’ are those that influence other (blanket) states. Effectively, all we 
are doing here is applying the (en)slaving principle, or centre manifold theorem (Haken, 1983), 
recursively to MBs of MBs. Figure 3 provides a schematic illustration of this recursive 
decomposition. 
 

163 
 
 
Fig. 3. Blankets of blankets. This schematic figure illustrates the recursive architecture by which successively 
larger (and slower) scale dynamics arise from subordinate levels. Starting at the bottom of the figure (lower panel) 
we can consider an ensemble of vector states (here nine). The conditional dependencies among these vector states 
then define a particular partition of into particles (upper panels). Crucially, this partition equips each particle with 
a bipartition into blanket and internal states, where blanket states comprise active (red) and sensory states 
(magenta). The behaviour of each particle can now be summarised in terms of (slow) eigenmodes or mixtures of 
its blanket states to produce vector states at the next level or scale. These constitute an ensemble of vector states 
and the process starts again. The upper panels illustrate the bipartition for a single particle (left panel) and an 
ensemble of particles; i.e., the particular partition per se (right panel). The insets on top illustrate the implicit self-
similarity in moving from one scale to the next using. In this figure, Ω·b denotes a linear mixture of blanket states 
specified by the principal eigenvectors of their Jacobian. Because the corresponding eigenvalues play the role of 
Lyapunov exponents, the resulting mixtures correspond to slow or unstable dynamical modes of activity.  
 
 
In this multiscale framework, active inference is inherently a group activity. That is, the 
entire ensemble of nested MBs are bound, enslaved and constrained by dynamics at higher 
scales, while the lower (microscopic) scales furnish the (macroscopic) states at any given level. 
This construction evinces exactly the same circular causality that underlies synergetics (Frank, 

164 
 
2004; Haken, 1983); however, here it is generalised to a recursive hierarchy of scales – i.e., the 
hierarchical composition of blankets of blankets. Intuitively, the dynamics at one scale provide 
constraints (technically, establish probability gradients) on dynamics at other scales. Active 
inference destroys free energy gradients at each scale8, under the guidance or control of a 
generative model at the scale above. This guidance is exerted through influences on sensory 
states, where circular causality means that the action of any MB in an ensemble of MBs could 
be involved in sensing, action or perception; depending upon its role at the superordinate scale; 
i.e., has a sensory, active or internal state at the level above. Please see (Palacios et al., 2017) 
for a worked example using simulations of biological self-assembly. 
This may sound a little abstract; however, imagine you are an employee as an 
institution, where you transact your (microscopic) affairs with other personnel to self-evidence 
your prior beliefs that you are ‘good at your job’. This would entail responding to corporate or 
institutional goals that emerge collectively (i.e., an implicit generative model at the 
macroscopic level). Note that your job may be homologous to an internal state at the 
institutional (macroscopic) level – relating only to other employees. Alternatively, you could 
be working on reception (i.e., a sensory state) or issuing press releases (i.e., an active state). 
Another example of multiscale self-organisation is provided in Figure 4 to illustrate a less 
anthropomorphic form of self-assembly at the cellular and molecular level. In this example, 
the extensive nature of variational free energy is laid bare: each system or agent that comprises 
the ensemble shares the same generative model. This means that the total free energy is 
composed in exactly the same way statisticians would accumulate statistical evidence through 
Bayesian belief updating with each new source of evidence9. The twist here is that the (sensory) 
evidence for each agent’s model is generated by another agent. In short, multiscale ensembles 
that endure, in an ergodic sense, dissolve free energy gradients, thereby integrating dynamics 
within and between scales. This brings us to questions about coupling among MBs within a 
particular scale, which will be our focus for the remainder of the paper. 
 
 
                                                 
8 The destruction of probability gradients simply means that gradient flows will seek out 
variational free energy minima, where the gradients disappear (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002). 
9 Bayesian belief updating treats each posterior belief – based upon some data seen so far – as 
the prior belief for the next set of data. This is formally equivalent to adding the log-evidence 
(i.e., variational free energy), because adding logs is equivalent to multiplying probabilities 
and evidence corresponds to the probability of the data, given a model. 

165 
 
3.2 Ensembles of MBs 
In what follows, we look more closely at the partition of states into an ensemble of MBs – and 
what this means for self-organisation at any scale of dynamics. A crucial point, which enables 
the integration of ensemble dynamics into adaptive behaviour, is that variational free energy 
is an extensive quantity; in other words, it increases with the size or compass of the system in 
question. In the context of an ensemble of MBs, this means we can add the free energy of each 
agent or particle to describe the behaviour of the ensemble (see Figure 4). 
 
 
Fig. 4. Self-assembly and active inference. This figure shows the results of a simulation of morphogenesis under 
active inference reported in (Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & Pezzulo, 2015). This simulation used a gradient descent 
on variational free energy using a simple ensemble of eight cells; each of which had the same (pluripotential) 
generative model. This generative model predicted what each cell would sense and signal (chemotactically) for 
any given location in a ‘target morphology’ (lower middle panel – extracellular target signal; in other words, what 
each agent would expect to sense if it were at a particular location). By actively moving around, all the cells 
minimised their variational free energy (i.e., surprise) by inferring where they were, in relation to others. Because 
variational free energy is an extensive quantity, the free energy minimising arrangement of the ensemble is the 
target morphology. In other words, every cell has to ‘find its place’, at which point each cell minimises its own 
surprise about the signals it senses (because it knows its place) and the ensemble minimises the total free energy. 
The upper panels show the time courses of expectations about its place in the morphology (upper left), the 

166 
 
associated active states mediating migration and signal expression (upper middle) and the resulting trajectories; 
projected onto the first (vertical) direction – and color-coded to show differentiation (upper right). These 
trajectories progressively minimize total free energy (lower left panel). The lower right panel shows the ensuing 
configuration. Here, the trajectory is shown in small circles (for each time step). The insert corresponds to the 
target configuration. Please see Friston, Levin, et al. (2015) for further details. 
 
 
Applying the MB formalism to sentient systems is intuitive when modelling systems 
whose conditional independence is maintained via literal sensorimotor loops, where the 
interaction between active and sensory states ranges over relatively small spatiotemporal 
scales. Note that every leap upward in the nested hierarchy implies a concomitant increase in 
spatial and temporal scale (see Figure 3), which in some cases entails an increase in the 
distances among the states of the system, as well as a decreased rate of change and (Bayesian) 
optimization. As we ascend spatiotemporal scales, it becomes increasingly unclear how the 
Markov boundaries are implemented. Indeed, the justification for the use of the MB formalism 
to describe living systems rests on the observation that if the coupling among an ensemble of 
dynamical subsystems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of those remote 
subsystems must be conditionally independent (Friston, 2013). In summary, despite providing 
a framework to integrate dynamics across scales – and ensemble dynamics within a scale – 
VNE does not tell us how large scale ensembles self-organize so as to form higher-order MBs. 
In the next section, we address this issue; namely, how to draw MBs for large-scale systems 
like ecological niches, social ensembles, and cultural dynamics, drawing on the notion of 
affordances from the skilled intentionality framework (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Rietveld, 
2008). 
 
4. The variational approach to niche construction and the ontology of affordances 
 
4.1. The variational approach to niche construction 
Niche construction theory in evolutionary biology (e.g., Laland, Matthews, & Feldman, 2016; 
Lewontin, 1982; Odling-Smee, Laland, & Feldman, 2003; Stotz, 2017) argues that via their 
bioregulatory behaviour, living organisms (explicitly and implicitly) modify their environment, 
so as to steer their evolutionary trajectory, and that of other species. Arguably, then, niche 
construction is on a par with natural selection as a bona fide evolutionary force. Niche 
construction can be understood in two ways: in terms of selective niche construction (SNC), or 

167 
 
in terms of developmental niche construction (DNC) (Stotz, 2017). SNC refers to changes to 
the ecological niche induced by the action of organisms, and by which living systems come to 
modify selection pressures on themselves and other species that inhabit the niche. SNC 
operates on a phylogenetic time scale, and involves processes like ecological and cultural 
inheritance (Odling-Smee, 1988; Odling-Smee & Laland, 2011), where evolutionarily 
significant components of an environment are passed on from one generation to another; e.g., 
the remains of beaver dams are reconstructed by beavers, while the concept of a ‘canoe’ is 
passed down generations in the form of ‘cognitive gadgets’ (Heyes, 2018). DNC refers to the 
production in ontogeny of exogenetic resources by organisms themselves; in order to change 
developmental inputs, and secure the reliable and flexible reproduction of the individual life 
cycle (Stotz, 2017). DNC operates on the scale of development, learning, and action-perception 
cycles. The set of exogenetic resources that it optimizes include evolved loops of adaptive 
behaviour (e.g., grooming, parental care) and physical changes to the niche itself (Stotz & 
Griffiths, 2017).  
As an example of niche construction outcome in humans, consider improvised ‘desire 
paths’; e.g., a dirt trail in the park carved out by recurrent actions of agents in the 
neighbourhood. From the point of view of the FEP, such a path can function as an exogenetic 
resource. It encodes precise (high certainty, reliable) information about the fact that the end of 
the park is at the end of the trail. An agent can rely on this information to navigate the park 
efficiently, without having to know the layout of the neighborhood. While crossing a park 
might not be as essential a behaviour as grooming, from the point of view of the FEP, finding 
oneself in expected sensory states certainly is. Indeed, exogenetic resources of the niche such 
as desire paths can function as reliable indicators of surprise- and ambiguity-resolving actions, 
which, under the statistical conception of the phenotype entailed by the FEP, is crucial for 
maintaining the agent’s continued existence. In short, the collective behaviour of an ensemble 
of agents provides a form of semiotics or a set of possibilities for engagement with the niche 
(a.k.a. affordances) that become relevant from the point of view of the needs and concerns of 
any single agent. So how can a variational ecology shed light on the role of affordance in 
selecting adaptive actions that emerge from ensemble dynamics? 
Selecting adaptive actions requires an organism to evaluate expected free energy under 
possible action policies (Elfwing, Uchibe, & Doya, 2016). Expected free energy can be 
expressed in different ways; e.g., as expected energy minus entropy, or as a mixture of 
epistemic and pragmatic value (see Figure 5). With respect to our purposes here, expected free 
energy can be expressed as the expected cost of an outcome, given a certain action, plus the 

168 
 
expected ambiguity of the outcome (cf. Friston, Levin, et al., 2015). Expected cost corresponds 
to the discrepancy between outcomes conditional on a given action, and expectations or 
preferences about outcomes (technically, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two 
beliefs). Evaluating expected cost enables the selection of actions that bring about sensory 
states (observations) expected by the agent – i.e., those predicted by its generative model, and 
by the same token, those that once brought about, have the least deleterious or ‘costly’ 
consequences with regard to their surprisal. In turn, the ambiguity reflects an agent’s 
expectations about the uncertainty of outcomes, dependent upon causes in the world.  
 
 
Fig. 5: Bayesian mechanics and active inference. This graphic summarises the belief updating scheme in the 
minimisation of variational free energy and expected free energy (Friston et al., 2009; Friston et al., 2016a; Kaplan 
& Friston, 2018). In the first step (circles on the left), discrete actions solicit a sensory outcome (i.e., in the parlance 
of the SIF, a solicitation) used to form approximate posterior beliefs about states of the world. This belief updating 
involves the minimisation of free energy under a set of plausible policies (blue panel – Perceptual inference). Note 
that free energy F(π,s) includes Markovian dependencies among hidden states. This reflects the fact that the 
generative model is a Markov decision process. In the second step (green panel – Policy selection), the 
approximate posterior beliefs from the first step are used to evaluate expected free energy F(π,τ) and subsequent 
beliefs about action. These beliefs correspond to the epistemic and pragmatic affordances that underwrite policy 

169 
 
selection. Note that the free energy per se is a function of sensory states, given a policy. In contrast, the expected 
free energy is a function of the policy. The construct of affordance in active inference corresponds to inferences 
about action on the environment, which are selected in terms of competing policies via the minimisation of 
expected free energy. The variables in this figure correspond to those in Figure 1. Here, a policy π comprises a 
sequence of actions; the expression Q(η | π) denotes beliefs about hidden states given a particular policy; and Q(π) 
denotes posterior beliefs about the policy that is currently being pursued by the agent. Free energy is the difference 
between complexity and accuracy, while expected free energy can be decomposed into expected complexity (i.e., 
complexity cost or risk) and expected inaccuracy (i.e., ambiguity). Risk can be regarded as the (KL) divergence 
(D) between beliefs about future states under a particular policy and prior preferences about states. Ambiguity 
denotes the loss of a definitive mapping between external states and observed sensory states (quantified as entropy, 
H). Alternatively, expected free energy can be decomposed into epistemic and pragmatic affordance. Posterior 
beliefs about policies depend on their expected free energy. Crucially, these posterior beliefs include the free 
energy evaluated during perceptual inference. This has several interesting consequences from our perspective. 
This construction means that the agent has to infer the policy that it is currently pursuing and verify its predictions 
in light of sensory evidence. This is possible because the beliefs about actions that are encoded by internal states 
are distinct from the active states of the agent’s MB. Free energy per se provides evidence that a particular policy 
is being pursued. In this scheme, agents (will appear to) entertain beliefs about their own behaviour, endowing 
them with what is defined as intentionality of goal directed behaviour under active inference. In effect, this enables 
agents to author their own sensorium in a fashion that has close connections with niche construction: see main 
text and (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). See (Friston, Parr, & de Vries, 2017) for technical discussion. Figure 
from (Linson, Clark, Ramamoorthy, & Friston, 2018). 
 
This is where the variational approach to niche construction (VANC) comes in. VANC 
exploits the expression of expected free energy as expected cost plus ambiguity, to propose 
that agents upload, as it were, much of the leg work in computing expected free energy to their 
self-tailored, constructed environment. More precisely, it argues that niche construction can be 
cast as the collective activity by which organisms act on their material environment to create 
unambiguous structure, which can be leveraged (via active inference). Lasting changes to the 
niche capture the fact that environmental cues function as an unambiguous indicator of the 
affordance of action possibilities. These can be cast in terms of epistemic resources that flag 
those actions that resolve the ambiguity associated with future observations (Friston, Rigoli, et 
al., 2015), while conforming to the (prior) preferences of the organism entailed by its generative 
model.  
VANC casts DNC as the joint optimization of the niche – and its constituent ensemble 
of agents – over ontogeny through dense histories of active inference, and casts SNC as 
Bayesian model selection (Campbell, 2016; Constant, Ramstead, et al., 2018). By engaging 
ecologically inherited exogenetic resources of the niche, living organisms –especially those, 

170 
 
like humans, that depend on large-scale coordination –can reliably track, predict, and model 
the unfolding of causal regularities at and across large spatiotemporal scales (Clark, 2004). We 
will argue that this is so because niches themselves (including the organisms and their material 
setting) track those regularities. For instance, a complex system of agriculture that employs 
irrigation techniques enables groups of humans to smoothly cope with climate fluctuations that 
could otherwise jeopardize food production. In Section 4, we explain how the existence of 
higher-order, large-scale human ensembles depend on specific exogenetic resources of the 
niche – namely, epistemic resources of the kind just discussed – and how this emerges from 
ensembles of agents engaging in active inference. 
 
4.2. The ontology of affordances under the variational approach 
The skilled intentionality framework (SIF) (Rietveld, 2008) provides an account of the origin 
of intentionality or directed purposiveness in cognitive systems. We appeal to the SIF in 
offering an account of how to draw higher-order MBs; namely, by mobilizing the notion of 
affordances. The SIF recasts cognition as the engagement by organisms of the affordances that 
make up their local niche, thereby providing a real-time dynamics for the engagement of 
exogenetic (epistemic) resources that the niche affords, and enabling the stabilization of the 
local niche.  
What are affordances, and how are they to be interpreted under the free energy 
formulation? The SIF defines affordances as possibilities for engagement that obtain between 
a set of abilities at an organism’s disposal and relevant or salient features of the material 
environment (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Ramstead et al., 2016; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 
2014; van Dijk & Rietveld, 2016). Here, ‘engagement’ refers to structured, skillful patterns of 
action and perception10 – what we have covered under the rubric of active inference. In effect, 
the SIF provides an organism-centered dynamics that explains, concretely, what it means for 
an agent or group of agents and their ecological niche to engage in active inference and niche 
construction. Moreover, it does this by considering explicitly how the ecological niche is 
disclosed to the organism – as a field of affordances.  
The SIF tells us what is special about living systems in terms of their being directed 
towards meaningful worlds (or strictly speaking, outcomes). Namely, it points out something 
special about the way living systems self-organize. The dynamics of most (non-living) self-
organizing systems emerge and stabilize around an energy gradient, which those same 
                                                 
10 These abilities are known as policies in active inference (please see below). 

171 
 
dynamics then typically resolve or consume; e.g., as a lightning bolt strikes, the charge gradient 
around which it organized dissipates. Unlike other self-organising systems, living organisms 
are unique in that they actively generate and maintain the gradients that sustain them, through 
adaptive actions. In other words, an organism’s self-evidencing underwrites self-organisation 
and the very ergodicity upon which both rest (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Tschacher & 
Haken, 2007). 
What are the gradients around which living systems organize? The variational 
framework suggests that these gradients are variational free energy gradients resolved through 
active inference. Consistent with the FEP, under the SIF, affordances are cast as expected free 
energy gradients or differences. These differences are in the expected free energy associated 
with the repertoire of actions or abilities available to an organism under its generative model 
and the learned niche (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Ramstead et al., 2016). In formulations 
of active inference for generative models of discrete states (i.e., Markov decision processes), 
these abilities correspond to the policies and their affordance is quantified in terms of the 
expected free energy under each policy. Given this equivalence, affordance can be decomposed 
into complexity cost and ambiguity (as in Figure 5). Alternatively, by rearranging its terms, 
expected free energy can be expressed in terms of epistemic (i.e., intrinsic) and pragmatic (i.e., 
extrinsic) affordance (see Friston, Rigoli, et al., 2015; Parr & Friston, 2017, for details) for 
details). The ensuing variational formulation of affordances uses the path integral of free 
energy from the current point in time to a future time point, where the only difference between 
expected free energy and free energy per se is that sensory states have yet to be realised. This 
means the expectation in expected free energy is over sensory states in the future, based upon 
posterior beliefs informed by sensory states in the past. Put simply, the best action is the next 
action that belongs to the policy (i.e., sequence of actions) with the greatest affordance – or the 
least expected free energy. This is formally related to Hamilton's principle of least Action11 
that translates here into a variational principle of greatest ‘Affordance’. 
For organisms to engage the affordances offered by their niche is the variational ‘tissue’ 
that connects dynamics to the niche in which those organisms exist. The expected free energy 
of each policy can be cast as constituting the set of affordances that an organism can entertain. 
Action and policy selection integrate ensemble dynamics, by minimising expected free energy 
directly and learning the affordances on offer from the niche by selecting courses of action (i.e. 
                                                 
11 Where Action here denotes a path or time integral of free energy. The Action corresponds 
to the ‘work done’ in classical mechanics 

172 
 
policies) with the greatest epistemic affordance. This has close relationships with intrinsic 
motivation and exploration in ethology (Barto, Mirolli, & Baldassarre, 2013; Eccles & 
Wigfield, 2002; Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007; Schmidhuber, 2010) where, perhaps, the most 
important exploration is “what can I do with my body?” (i.e., the body as niche). This is most 
clearly seen in development and neurorobotics (Oudeyer & Kaplan, 2007). Things get more 
interesting when we appreciate that the niche itself is subject to exactly the same normative 
principles. In other words, as each agent is trying to learn about and infer its niche, the niche – 
through the collective inferences, actions and material artifacts of its constituent agents – 
appears to learn about and predict the behaviour of each agent. This must be true, because each 
MB that comprises the eco-niche is itself trying to minimise variational free energy. 
Heuristically, this means that because every agent is trying to predict their niche, they 
collectively shape their field of affordances in such a way that their niche appears to infer the 
behaviour of its agents and therefore becomes inherently more predictable (i.e., less 
ambiguous).  
This prompts a revision of the ontology of affordances under the SIF (Bruineberg & 
Rietveld, 2014). The ‘field of affordances’ is the set of affordances that solicit the organism at 
a given time. This field is constituted by expected free energy gradients that are induced by the 
entire ensemble. The engagement of the niche by the organism then corresponds to active 
inference; in the sense that these dynamics are simply the resolution of a local free energy 
landscape – a path of least (Hamiltonian) Action over the field of affordances. ‘Solicitations’ 
are those affordances that effectively engage the organism in action-perception loops at a given 
time. The ‘landscape of affordances’ is thus the set of affordances available in a niche at a 
given time. On this view, the landscape of affordances is a product of inference about “what 
would happen if I did that?” (Schmidhuber, 2010). Affordance is therefore an attribute of 
active, if counterfactual, engagement with the niche. Yet at the same time, it is a statement 
about the learned (and therefore lived) world.  
The picture that emerges by integrating a variational approach to niche construction 
with the ontology of affordances could be summarised as follows. When you select actions 
with the greatest affordance, you learn about your niche. However, your niche comprises other 
MBs that must be learning about you. These can be other ‘creatures like you’, ‘cognitive 
gadgets’, and ‘desire paths’, and so on. In other words, your action on the environment 
constitutes sensory evidence for a niche (i.e., landscape of affordances) that is trying to model 
you, while the niche acts on you via sensory impressions. From the perspective of some 
‘Godhead’ looking down on your niche, a self-organisation would emerge at a higher 

173 
 
spatiotemporal scale – that itself looks exactly like a self-organising, free energy minimising 
process. This has to be the case if your niche and all of its constituents attain some form of 
ergodicity, in virtue of the FEP. In other words, the network of conspecifics, their ‘desire paths’, 
and ‘cognitive gadgets’ would look like the internal states surrounded by a MB, separating 
your niche from another. We now develop this argument in the final section. 
 
5. Variational Ecology: A physics of shared minds  
How can we describe the sort of relationships that induce conditional independence among 
remote subsystems of ensembles (e.g., other animals as part of a larger niche)? Can we make 
sense of the self-organization of large-scale systems using MBs, to constitute robust and 
enduring sets of conditionally independent subsystems? How are MBs implemented at higher 
scales, and how can we define the relations among their states?  
The internal states of a MB can be separated by a great deal of distance, while retaining 
some form of dependency. When looking at phenomena unfolding across longer temporal 
scales, imagining internal states as physically isolated in a literal sense from external states 
becomes conceptually constraining. Two states clearly do not need to be (and as a matter of 
fact cannot be) in direct contact to be part of the same system; e.g., nodes of the Internet, 
soldiers in a battalion. What matters is the statistical relationship between states; i.e., to form 
a MB, the right kinds of statistical relations and partitions need to be in play. In other words, 
ensembles sharing the same MB, whether cells or organisms, need not be ‘spatially’ 
compartmentalized, but ought to be ‘statistically’ or ‘behaviourally’ segregated; that is, some 
recurrent patterns of behaviours should govern the way different sets of internal states maintain 
their conditional independence. Practically speaking, the only thing one needs to partition 
states into an ensemble of MBs is their adjacency matrix. This matrix (from graph theory) 
encodes directed dependencies in a weighted or unweighted fashion. One can then identify a 
subset of internal states, their MB, and the resulting external states (Friston, 2013). This process 
can be repeated by identifying a second set of internal states within the external states and 
continuing until all external states have been exhausted. Note that, to pursue this partition into 
an ensemble of MBs, one only needs the adjacency matrix describing ‘who is connected to 
whom’. This can easily be applied to differential equations describing evolutionary dynamics 
– or links in social media networks. See Figure 8 for an illustrative example. The question then 
is to determine how the active and sensory states are manifest, where the partition of states is 
dispersed over high dimensions of abstract state spaces. In other words, we need to understand 
what sort of ‘behaviour’ their states exhibit. 

174 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. A particular partition. This schematic figure illustrates a partition of vectors states (small coloured balls) 
into particles (comprising nine vectors), where each particle (π) has six blanket states (red and magenta for active 
and sensory states respectively) and three internal states (cyan). The upper panel summarises the operators used 
to create a particular partition. We start by forming an adjacency matrix that characterises the coupling between 
different vectors states. In this example, the adjacency matrix is based upon the Jacobian and implicitly the flow 
of vector states. The resulting adjacency matrix defines a MB forming matrix (B), which identifies the children, 
parents, and parents of the children. The same adjacency matrix is used to form a graph Laplacian (L) that is used 
to define neighbouring (i.e., coupled) internal states. One first identifies a set of internal states using the graph 
Laplacian. Here, the j-th subset of internal states at the level i are chosen based upon dense coupling with the 
vector state with the largest graph Laplacian. Closely coupled internal states are then selected from the columns 
of the graph Laplacian that exceed some threshold. In practice, the examples used later specify the number of 
internal states desired for each level of the hierarchical decomposition. Having identified a new set of internal 
states (that are not members of any particle that has been identified so far) its MB is recovered using the MB 
forming matrix. The internal and blanket states then constitute a new particle, which is added to the list of particles 
identified. This procedure is repeated until all vector states have been accounted for. In the example here, we have 
already identified four particles and the procedure adds a fifth (top) particle to the list of particles; thereby 
accounting for nine of the remaining vector states.

5.1. Markov blankets and ensemble dynamics: active and sensory states 
Under the MB formalism, sensory and active states are to be interpreted in their minimal sense; 
that is, as instantiating statistical relations. What it means for a system to have active states is 
for it to have states the dynamics of which change as a function of some systemic quantities 
(namely, as a function of internal and sensory states). In turn, what it means for something to 
have sensory states is for it to have states that change as a function of other systemic quantities 
(external and active states). On this view, both sensing and acting assume a statistical 
definition. Indeed, one could wonder about the difference between an agent sensing things in 
the world with a visual saccade and a photon hitting the retina of the agent. In the parlance of 
the MB formalism, whether a state counts as an active or a sensory state depends on whether 
or not it is influenced by internal and external states in the right way (Friston, 2013). Thus, an 
active state is just one that is influenced by the system’s defining states, and a sensory state is 
one that is not. Accordingly, a sensory state – at any level of description – might just mean a 
state that reliably covaries with, and conveys information about, some distal causes in the 
external system to which it is coupled (e.g., a receptionist taking calls on an external telephone 
line); and active states are just those states that enable the system to effect changes on the 
‘outside’ (e.g., a public relations officer emitting press releases). An ecological niche could 
thus have sensory and active states (and thus, have a MB) in a sufficient and minimal statistical 
sense.  
For a number of reasons, elements of the ontology of affordances are interesting 
candidates for the implementation of the sort of large scale behaviour under consideration. 
First, similar to the cell membrane, the sensory signals that actively engage an organism at a 
given time (i.e., solicitations) mediate the functional relationship between internal and external 
states of both the organism and its niche. In the parlance of the FEP, solicitations secure 
adaptive exchanges among the internal and external states by engaging the organism in loops 
of active inference that conform to internal expectations (e.g., they are perceived relative to the 
needs of the system), while enabling the learning of the causal structure of some external states 
(i.e., they are perceived relative to the actual causal structure). In this respect, similar to cell 
membranes, we can say that a solicitation “points both ways, to the environment and to the 
observer” (Gibson, 1979). In Figure 1, this ‘pointing both ways’ is established in virtue of the 
circular causality induced by the MB and ensuing active inference. This brings affordances into 
play, in terms of the expected free energy attributed to different policies of courses of action 
on the environment (see Figure 5). 

176 
 
Second, affordances, especially those enabled by epistemic resources, carry cultural 
knowledge that can be acquired in ontogeny (Costall, 1997), thereby securing the reproduction 
of adaptive patterned practices when transmitted across generations (Constant, Ramstead, et 
al., 2018). As such, affordances – especially the cultural affordances (Ramstead et al., 2016) 
that characterise a given local group – play a role in the coordination of the adaptive behaviour 
of members in a group over large spatial and temporal scales. Briefly, cultural affordances are 
the affordances with which human agents interact, and which depend on shared sets of cultural 
expectations, internalized through immersive practices (Ramstead et al., 2016). Affordances 
thus allow for adaptive behavioural self-organization among groups of agents, independent of 
their spatial proximity. In effect, cultural information encoded in the physical states of the 
ecological niche (in epistemic resources) enables the recognition and diffusion of epistemic 
affordances among groups over larger spatiotemporal scales (e.g., the intergenerational scale, 
via the passing on of affordances via cultural inheritance).  
Third, defining a MB for niche systems involves the description of the conditional 
independence among the partitions of the system. The ontology of affordances, especially the 
layering it entails (e.g., organism and field, solicitation and landscape of affordances) can, in 
principle, be used to define the statistical compartments (partition) of the niche, and by the 
same token explain the conditional independence among the states of the niche. 
Given these very reasons, we suggest that the field of affordances (and especially the 
solicitations that actually engage the agent at a given time) functions as the ‘surface’ that allows 
the niche to ‘sense’ agents via the agent’s action on the niche (Bruineberg, Rietveld, Parr, van 
Maanen, & Friston, 2018). The agent’s actions when repeated over time encode regularities 
about niche-agent interactions via changes to the structure of the ecological niche. In virtue of 
the circular causality discussed above, this structure is determined by – and indeed, determines 
– the affordances that underlie each agent’s action. The niche then ‘acts’ on the agent as it is 
sensed by the agent. We can say that an agent will be acted upon when engaging an affordance, 
as the affordance is a possible action to be selected, and the selection of which will entail 
changes in the agent. The action of the niche thus takes the form of ‘offering possibilities for 
engagement’. Crucially, a niche that would not offer a variety of possible engagements could 
not ‘act’ in any meaningful sense. The ‘active’ property of the niche rests on their ability to 
conform to the changing needs of the agent(s), that is, to solicit the agent by providing the right 
sort of sensory cues. 
 
 

177 
 
5.2. What is it that models, and what is modeled? – internal and external states   
So far, we have discussed the relevant quantities to define the niche’s MB. These are captured 
by the dynamics of the agent’s field of solicitation, which involves patterns of action and 
sensation for the agent, which coincide with the action and perception of the niche. The key 
point here is that the agent’s field of affordances (and solicitations) emerges from the dynamics 
of the MB of the niche, and thereby enables the niche to model sensory causal regularities, or 
underlying structure of the form of life it constitutes (Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014; 
Wittgenstein, 1953)  
Now, what are the internal states of the niche? And what are the causal regularities that 
they model? We suggest that internal states of the niche are a subset of the physical states of 
the material environment. Namely, the internal states of the niche are the physical states of the 
environment, which have been modified by the dense histories of different organisms 
interacting in their shared niche (i.e., histories of active inference). This subset of physical 
states comes to encode information that is used in the self-evidencing dynamics of organisms. 
In other words, the ecological niche becomes part of the embodied model parameters that 
encode the variational or recognition density that the agent uses in active inference. These 
model parameters encode causal regularities about agents’ behaviour, which function as the 
external, hidden states of the niche, which it models in niche construction.  
The internal states of the niche encode information about regularities of the niche-
agent(s) relation (Constant, Ramstead, et al., 2018). This means that the internal states of the 
niche encode organism-specific information (e.g., affordances), not merely any changes to the 
physical layout. Otherwise, it would mean that the internal states would also encode random 
changes to the environment (e.g., volcanic eruptions and tsunamis). Hence, the ecological niche 
is a subset of the physical environment that the organism constructs through reiterated action 
over time (i.e., active inference). We can see the propensity of the environment to encode 
organism-specific information as the propensity to change its structure as a function of the 
actions of the organism (i.e., sensations of the niche) (Bruineberg et al., 2018). For instance, a 
grass patch has a much higher propensity to encode organisms-specific information than a 
sidewalk made of concrete – hence a grass patch after some time, and recurring actions, might 
encode a desire path (i.e., will turn into a cultural affordance). The point here is that the niche 
is always organisms, or species-specific, an Umwelt of sorts (Von Uexküll, 1987), whose 
relational structure consists of affordances, encoded through niche construction (cf. section 3).  
The final quantity to define is that of the causal regularities modeled by the niche, and 
transcribed by its physical layout (the internal states). We have seen that for groups of 

178 
 
enculturated agents like humans, internal states of the niche encode affordances that pertain to 
group behaviour; e.g., what the desire path models is the action possibility to ‘cut corners’. 
Now, it is a small step from this point to the one that the internal states of the niche track 
statistical regularities and fluctuations that underwrite the meaning of shared intentionality and 
normative group behaviour (Henrich, 2015; Tomasello & Carpenter, 2007; Tomasello, 
Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005). These regularities are highly abstract, and can only 
exist – as causes – for large-scales ensembles like groups of agents. With the example of the 
desire path, one can start to appreciate the continuity that obtains between the physics of self-
organizing systems, the form of pragmatic engagements afforded by constructed niches, and 
the sort of meanings and intentions that people derive from them. 
In summary, the niche transcribes regularities that pertain to group behaviour – they 
are transcribed in the physical layout of the niche – through the active and perceptual dynamics 
of the agent, which coincides with the perceptual and active dynamics of the niche. These same 
dynamics entail the landscape of action possibilities (i.e., affordances), which maintains the 
structural integrity of the agent-niche system – niche dynamics resolve the free energy 
gradients that are induced by the physical structures of organisms and their niche, and their 
history of dense interaction and dynamic coupling. In this sense, the robustness of patterns of 
shared intentionality and enaction of shared meanings is inherited from the robustness of the 
niche, and vice versa.  
 
6. Concluding remarks  
Variational ecology (VE) is a synthesis of VNE (Ramstead et al., 2018), the VANC (Constant, 
Ramstead, et al., 2018), and the SIF (van Dijk & Rietveld, 2016), and provides an explanation 
of collective purposive action and intentionality of living systems – a physics of sentient 
systems. An ecological niche ‘just is’ a structured set of affordances that are shared by agents, 
which enables its denizens to coordinate purposive action over sometimes vast spatial and 
temporal distances. The sort of affordances that emerge from niche construction, and that 
constitute large scale ensembles, carry semiotic and axiological meaning like moral states held 
in common (cf. Keane, 2014) (e.g., this dirt trail ‘means’ cutting through the park, and you 
shall not be late to your appointment). In effect, there is a deep sense in which affordances are 
what meanings are (Gibson, 1979), and a sense in which meaning is entailed by the existence 
of groups of agents that share a niche (cf. sense-making, De Jaegher & Di Paolo, 2007; Di 
Paolo & Thompson, 2014). As they engage with the affordances of their niche, ensembles of 
agents: (i) maintain the structural integrity of the niche through niche construction (and active 

179 
 
inference); and (ii) collectively enact a generative model of their relation to the niche, thereby 
providing an account of the physics of intentionality, and especially of shared intentionality. 
VE, then, is also a physics of interacting minds.

Abstract: 
We present a multiscale integrationist interpretation of the boundaries of cognitive systems, 
using the Markov blanket formalism of the variational free energy principle (FEP). This 
interpretation is intended as a corrective for the philosophical debate over internalist and 
externalist interpretations of cognitive boundaries; we stake out a compromise position. We 
first survey key principles of new radical (extended, enactive, embodied) views of cognition. 

188 
 
We then describe an internalist interpretation premised on the Markov blanket formalism. 
Having reviewed these accounts, we develop our positive multiscale account. We argue that 
the statistical seclusion of internal from external states of the system – entailed by the 
existence of a Markov boundary – can coexist happily with the multiscale integration of the 
system through its dynamics. Our approach does not privilege any given boundary (whether it 
be that of the brain, body, or world), nor does it argue that all boundaries are equally 
prescient. We argue that the relevant boundaries of cognition depend on the level being 
characterised and the explanatory interests that guide investigation. We approach the issue of 
how and where to draw the boundaries of cognitive systems through a multiscale ontology of 
cognitive systems, which offers a multidisciplinary research heuristic for cognitive science.

In the previous chapter,  
I developed a framework for cognitive ecology, called variational ecology (VE), which is 
formulated to model the manner in which hierarchically structured cognitive systems – nested 
living systems from cells to societies – construct, and align themselves with, their ecological 
niche. Taken together with the results of the two previous chapters, VE provides the cognitive 
sciences with a fully generalisable metatheory of adaptive cognitive dynamics in living 
systems. In this chapter, I draw the main philosophical consequences of adopting this 
framework for the philosophical issue of where to draw the boundaries of cognitive systems. 
I argue that VNE and VE entail that the boundaries of living systems are multiple, nested, and 
relative to our explanatory interests. The combined framework afforded by VNE and VE 

189 
 
shows that to explain the adaptive behaviour of any cognitive system, we must consider the 
many nested boundaries of the systems that constitute the system of interest. The chapter also 
offers an argument for methodological pluralism based on VE and VNE.

What we think cognition is depends on what our theoretical 
commitments suggest can be explained. The question facing the 
field is not “Which approach is true?” but “Which approach 
gives us the best scientific leverage?”  
(Hutchins, 2010, pp. 706-707)  
 
1. Introduction 
Over two decades ago, in 1991, Francisco Varela and colleagues articulated a general idea 
that now underlies what might be called radical views on cognition; namely, enactive, 
embodied, and extended approaches to cognition. According to proponents of the enactive 
approach, “cognition is … the enactment of a world and a mind on the basis of a history of 
the variety of actions that a being in the world performs” (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991, 
p. 9). Since Varela and colleagues, philosophers and scientists have addressed the role of 
embodied activity in cognition and the degree to which our cognitive capacities are realised 
partly by elements of our embedding environment. Philosophers especially have been 
considering what embodied, enactive, and extended accounts have to teach us about the 
boundaries of cognitive systems.  
 
Here, we focus on making explicit a description of the boundaries of cognitive 
systems that we think follows from taking seriously the enactive, embodied, and extended 
nature of cognition. This is the idea that the boundaries of cognitive systems are nested and 
multiple – and that, with respect to its study, cognition has no fixed or essential boundaries 
(Clark, 2017; Kirchhoff, 2018c; Kirchhoff & Kiverstein, 2019; Kirchhoff, 2012; Stotz, 2010; 
Sutton, 2010).  
 
This idea is far from the accepted view in the philosophy of mind and cognition. 
Indeed, it is common for researchers from different fields of study – e.g., neuroscience and 
the philosophy of neuroscience (Hohwy, 2014; Seth, 2014), embodied cognition (Gallagher, 
2006; Noë, 2004), ecological psychology (Gibson, 1979), and anthropology (Ingold, 2001) – 
to infer that there is a uniquely defining boundary or unit of analysis from which best to 
understand and investigate cognition. In its more extreme forms, one might call this position 
essentialism about the boundaries of cognition. Views stressing that cognition has a unique 
and privileged boundary take many forms. Some argue that cognitive activity is essentially 
realised by states of the brain. Others argue that cognition is best conceived of as forms of 
embodied activity. Others still prefer to study cognition “in the wild,” in terms of the 
patterning of cultural practices and construction of cognitive niches.  

191 
 
 
The claim that the boundaries of cognition are nested and varied runs counter to any 
of these brain-based, embodied, and/or ecological, environmental assumptions about the 
boundaries of cognition, for it does not privilege the brain, the body, or the environment. Nor 
do we consider the brain, body and environment as equally important, as some in the 
enactivist tradition have proposed (Hutto & Myin, 2013). This is the Equal Partner Principle 
of radical enactivism. It states that the contributions of the brain to cognition should not be 
prioritised over those of the body and the environment. Even if there is something correct 
about this claim – that one should not a priori privilege the brain in explanations of cognition 
– there is also something problematic about this principle; namely, that on some occasions it 
will turn out to be incorrect, as privileging the brain will be required to explain some 
phenomena under consideration.  
 
Where to draw the scientifically relevant boundaries will depend both on the nature of 
the phenomenon being investigated and on our explanatory interests (Clark, 2017; Hutchins, 
1995). By standing on the shoulders of theorists that take seriously the idea that cognitive 
boundaries are not singular but nested and varied, we reject all views assuming there to be 
unique and privileged boundaries for cognitive systems, and stake out a compromise position 
between (in our view) the overly coarse-grained distinction between internalism and 
externalism about the boundaries of cognition.  
 
Our argument takes the form of a multiscale integrationist formulation of the 
boundaries of cognition based on the variational free energy principle (henceforth FEP). This 
principle casts cognition and action in terms of quantities that change to minimise free energy 
expected under action policies. As we discuss in the second section of this paper, we use the 
FEP because free energy and its expectation can be broadly construed as metrics of cognitive 
activity that transcend specific spatial and temporal scales (Friston, Levin, Sengupta, & 
Pezzulo, 2015; Kirchhoff, 2015; Kirchhoff, Parr, Palacios, Friston, & Kiverstein, 2018; 
Ramstead, Badcock, & Friston, 2018a; Ramstead, Constant, Badcock, & Friston, 2019). This 
allows us to cast the boundaries of cognition as assembled and maintained in an informational 
dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Crucially, we shall show that this 
multiscale application of the FEP implies both ontological and methodological pluralism.  
 
We cast ontological pluralism in terms of a multiscale formal ontology of cognitive 
systems. In the sense we are using the term, to produce a formal ontology means to use a 
mathematical formalism to answer the questions traditionally posed by metaphysics; i.e., 
what does it mean to be a thing that exists, what is existence, etc. Our formal ontology is 

192 
 
effectively in the same game as statistical physics, in that it treats as a system sets of states 
that evince a robust enough form of conditional independence.  
 
This ontology implies, that any given cognitive system has a plurality of boundaries 
relevant to their scientific study; namely, the boundaries of its relevant subsystems. Our claim 
is that which among these are the most relevant will depend on the phenomenon being 
studied and the explanatory interests of researchers. Some of these boundaries are internal to 
the systems – these are boundaries of relevant subsystems nested in the whole system or 
organism (e.g., cells, ensemble of cells, organs, etc.); other boundaries separate the organism 
from its external environment (e.g., the skin membrane); and others still extend outwards to 
include the organism and external, worldly states (e.g., constructed niches and patterned 
cultural practices).  
 
The claims we are making about the boundaries of cognitive systems are ontological. 
We are using a mathematical formalism to answer questions that are traditionally those of the 
discipline of ontology, but crucially, we are not deciding any of the ontological questions in 
an a priori manner. The Markov blankets are a result of the system’s dynamics. In a sense, we 
are letting the biological systems carve out their own boundaries in applying this formalism. 
Hence, we are endorsing a dynamic and self-organising ontology of systemic boundaries. 
 
Furthermore, this ontological pluralism implies methodological pluralism under the 
FEP. The FEP can be used as a methodological heuristic for interdisciplinary research, which 
in turn allows scientists to privilege various boundaries of a nested cognitive system, 
depending on their specific explanatory interests. The FEP is not a theory of everything; it 
does not, on its own, provide an explanation of the systemic processes that constitute living 
systems (Ramstead, Badcock, & Friston, 2018b). Rather, it is a principle that coordinates and 
constrains the kind of explanations deployed when one is addressing how expected free 
energy minimisation occurs across many different spatial and temporal scales; which call for 
complementary explanations in terms of, e.g.,  neuroscience (Friston, 2010), embodied 
cognition (Allen & Friston, 2016), ecological psychology (Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; 
Ramstead et al., 2019), and niche construction (Constant, Ramstead, Veissière, Campbell, & 
Friston, 2018; Hesp et al., 2019).12 
 
We approach this multiscale, integrationist view of the boundaries of cognition by 
focusing on the Markov blanket formalism, which underwrites the FEP (see Figure 1 for a 
detailed technical explanation). This formalism allows us to individuate a system by 
                                                 
12 We do not intend this list of relevant disciplines to be exhaustive.

demarcating its boundaries in a statistical sense. Intuitively, for a thing to exist, it must evince 
some form of conditional independence from the system in which it is embedded. Markov 
blankets operationalise this intuition. In more technical terms, a Markov blanket induces a 
statistical partitioning between internal (systemic) and external (environmental) states, where 
environmental states can be associated with neuronal, bodily, or worldly states depending on 
the relevant partitioning of the system in question. The Markov blanket itself comprises a 
bipartition into active and sensory states, which mediate exchanges between systemic and 
environmental (neuronal, bodily, worldly) states. Importantly, the presence of a Markov 
blanket shields or insulates internal states from the direct influence of external states. This 
follows from the partitioning rule of Markov blankets, according to which internal states can 
influence external states via active states, and external states can influence internal states via 
sensory states. Hence, the Markov blanket formalism shows that internal and external states 
are ‘hidden’ (i.e., conditionally independent) from one another in virtue of the existence of a 
Markov blanket, thus providing the statistical means by which to delineate the boundaries of 
a biological and/or cognitive system.

Fig 1. The Markov blanket and active inference. A Markov blanket is a set of states that enshrouds or 
statistically isolates internal states from external or hidden states. This figure depicts the partition of the states 
into internal ( ) and external states (). In the parlance of graph theory, the Markov blanket is a set of nodes 
that shields the internal states (or nodes) from the influence of external states; in the sense that internal states can 
only be affected by external states indirectly, via the blanket states (Friston, Parr, & de Vries, 2017). Internal 
and external states are therefore separated, in a statistical sense, by the Markov blanket ( b ), which itself 
comprises sensory ( s ) and active states ( a ) – defined as blanket states that are and are not influenced by 
external states respectively. The top panel schematises the relations of reciprocal causation that couple the 
organism to its ecological niche, and back again. Internal states of the organism change as a function of its 
current state ( ) and the state of its niche (), which is expressed in terms of a flow 
( , )
f with random 
fluctuations. Reciprocally, states of the niche change over time as a function of the current state of the 
environment and the organism, again, specified in terms of a flow 
( , )
f with random fluctuations. The self-
organisation of internal states in this scheme corresponds to perception. Active states couple internal states back 
to states of the niche, and so correspond to the actions of an organism. Given the anti-symmetric conditional 
dependencies entailed by the presence of the Markov blanket, the dynamics of the niche, too, can be expressed 
as a gradient flow of a free energy functional of external and blanket states. The lower panel depicts the 
dependencies as they would apply to a unicellular organism. In this panel, the internal states are associated with 

195 
 
the intracellular states of a cell, the sensory states are associated with surface states of the cell membrane, and 
the active states are associated with the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton. Adapted from Constant, Ramstead, 
et al. (2018). 
 
 
 
We accept that the Markov blanket formalism can be used to delineate the boundaries 
of cognitive systems (cf. Hohwy, 2016; Kirchhoff & Kiverstein, 2019). We shall argue that 
cognition involves dynamics (i.e., the Bayesian mechanics of active inference) that ensure 
adaptiveness, which straddle across and integrate such boundaries. We call this position 
multiscale integration. We argue that the FEP can accommodate a multiscale integrationist 
account of the boundaries of cognitive systems. We therefore argue that the inferential 
seclusion of internal states and external states, given by the Markov blanket formalism, can 
coexist with existential integration through active inference; justifying the view that the 
boundaries of cognition are nested and multiple.  
 
The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next (second) section, we review the 
FEP and active inference. In the third section, we survey key principles of new radical – 
extended, enactive, embodied – views of cognition, with a focus on enactive views in 
particular. We then describe a brain-based argument for the boundary of cognitive systems 
premised on the Markov blanket formalism – and the FEP – that pushes back again these 
radical views of cognition. In the fourth section, we develop our positive proposal for a 
multiscale account of the FEP. We argue that the encapsulation or statistical seclusion 
entailed by the Markov boundary is reiterated at every hierarchical description of living 
systems; from the single cell, to organs, to individuals, and all the way out to coupled 
organism-environment systems – all of which can be cast as having their own Markov 
blanket. We also argue that the organism and niche are coupled to one another through active 
inference.  
 
In this sense, our argument owes much to Clark (2017). Clark sets out the idea of 
organisms having temporally extended Markov blankets, the boundaries of which reach all 
the way down to DNA and all the way up to individual organisms and their respective niches. 
Our focus, however, is different from Clark’s, in two ways. First, we make explicit that this 
view of the Markov blanketed cognitive system implies two forms of pluralism, ontological 
and methodological; and second, we emphasize that active inference entails adaptive 
phenotypes, cultural practices, and niche construction; the joint phenotype of the organism 
(including states of its adapted niche) encodes information that, at least in some cases, is as 

196 
 
important as that encoded by states of the brain to explain adaptive behaviour. We conclude 
by considering future research directions for approaching systemic organisation through a 
multiscale ontology of cognitive systems and a multidisciplinary research heuristic for 
cognitive science. 
 
2. A variational principle for living systems  
 
2.1. The variational free energy formulation 
Organisms find themselves, more often than not, in a bounded set of characteristic states. We 
can cast this set of states, in which the organism is most likely to find itself, as its overall 
phenotypical states and traits; namely, the repertoire of measurable functional and 
physiological states, as well as morphological traits, behavioural patterns, and the adapted 
ecological niches that characterizes it as ‘the kind of organism that it is’ (Kirchhoff et al., 
2018; Ramstead et al., 2018a). From this statistical perspective, the question of how 
organisms remain alive can be recast as the question of how they maintain themselves in 
phenotypic states.  
 
Remarkably, organisms resist entropic erosion by simply limiting the dispersion of 
states that they occupy during their lifetime. The variational free energy principle (FEP) 
provides a formal description of this anti-entropic feat. The FEP casts the functioning of 
biological systems of any kind, including their different psychological profiles, in terms of a 
single imperative: to minimise surprise (aka surprisal or self-information). The concept of 
surprise does not refer to the psychological phenomenon of being surprised. It is an 
information-theoretic notion that measures how uncharacteristic or unexpected a particular 
sensory state is, where sensory states can be caused by external worldly (and bodily) states.  
 
A key premise of the FEP is that cognitive systems cannot estimate surprise directly 
and therefore must work to reduce an upper bound on surprise, which they can track; namely, 
variational free energy. In other words, surprise cannot be evaluated directly because this 
would entail to name all possible ways in which some sensations could have been caused. 
However, variational free energy can be evaluated given a generative model of how 
sensations were caused. Because variational free energy is (by construction) always greater 
than surprise, minimising free energy implicitly minimises surprise (see Figure 2). One can 
think of variational free energy as a guess or approximation to surprise, whose accuracy can 
be finessed through perception; namely, the dynamics of a system’s internal states. This 

197 
 
perceptually crafted approximation to surprise can now be minimised by action; namely, the 
dynamics of a system’s active states.

in active states and internal states both minimise free-energy and, implicitly, self-information. Lower panel: 
Depiction of alternative expressions for the variational free-energy, which clarify what its minimisation entails. 
With regards to action, free-energy can only be minimised by increasing the accuracy of sensory data (i.e., the 
selective sampling of predicted data). Conversely, the optimisation of internal states through perception makes 
the probability distribution encoded by internal states an approximate conditional density on the causes of 
sensory input (by minimising a Kullback-Leibler divergence D  between the approximate and true posterior 
density). This optimisation tightens the free-energy bound on self-information and enables the creature to avoid 
surprising sensations through adaptive action (because the divergence can never be less than zero). With regards 
to the selection of actions that minimise the expected free energy, the expected divergence becomes (negative) 
epistemic value or salience, and the expected surprise becomes (negative) extrinsic value; which is the expected 

198 
 
likelihood that prior preferences are indeed realised as a result of the selected action. See Friston, FitzGerald, 
Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, and Pezzulo (2017) for a full description of the free energy expected following an 
action. Adapted from Ramstead et al. (2018a). 
 
 
 
In a nutshell, the FEP tells us that cognitive systems can estimate and thereby avoid 
surprise, on average and over time, by working to suppress a variational bound on surprise. 
Crucially, this free energy bound is exactly the same quantity used in Bayesian statistics to 
optimise (generative) models of data. In this setting, negative free energy is known as log 
model evidence or marginal likelihood. This leads to a complementary perspective on 
surprise-minimising dynamics that become self-evidencing; in the sense of optimising 
Bayesian model evidence – and, by implication, performing some sort of (perceptual) 
inference. In short, technically speaking, minimising self-information underwrites self-
organisation through self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016); thereby evincing a Bayesian mechanics 
for any system that exists in the sense of possessing a Markov blanket. 
 
Standard cognitive functions like perception (Hohwy, Roepstorff, & Friston, 2008), 
attention (Feldman & Friston, 2010), and learning (Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, 
Schwartenbeck, & Pezzulo, 2016a; Friston, 2005) all seem to conform to this single principle. 
The machinery used to estimate and avoid surprise also recruits a series of non-standard 
functions like emotions (Van de Cruys & Wagemans, 2011), action (Friston, Mattout, & 
Kilner, 2011), culture and its production (Fabry, 2017; Ramstead, Veissière, & Kirmayer, 
2016), as well as evolutionary processes like niche construction (Constant, Bervoets, Hens, & 
Van de Cruys, 2018; Constant, Ramstead, et al., 2018) and natural selection (Campbell, 2016; 
Friston & Stephan, 2007), thereby forcing us to rethink the boundaries of cognition. 
 
Statistically, one can define variational free energy as surprise plus a measure of the 
distance between a system’s (posterior Bayesian) beliefs13 about the external causes of its 
sensory input, encoded by its internal states (e.g., neural architecture), and the true posterior 
probability distribution, conditioned on a generative model of how that input was produced 
(Friston, 2010). Thus, the variational free energy is defined with reference to a (generative) 
model of what caused its sensations (including, crucially, its own actions). Variational free 
                                                 
13 Note that we will use the term ‘belief’ throughout to mean ‘probabilistic Bayesian belief’, 
which is a probability distribution encoded by states of the organism. A belief in this sense 
need not have any content; it is not a belief in the traditional philosophical sense, but instead 
should be read as synonymous with ‘probability distribution’. 

199 
 
energy can thus be cast as a measure of the kinds of things that the cognitive systems finds 
surprising or, more simply, an estimation of surprise. In summary, variational free energy is 
an upper bound on surprise, in the sense that surprise can never be greater than free energy 
given the way variational free energy is constructed – for details, see Friston (2012). Thus, by 
acting to minimise free energy, organisms implicitly minimise surprise. 
 
Crucially, by acting to reduce variational free energy, biological systems come to 
instantiate a probabilistic (generative) model of their environment, including the states of 
their body (Friston, Parr, et al., 2017). This generative model can be viewed as a ‘map’ of the 
relational or causal structure among the various quantities (e.g., sensory observations and 
Bayesian beliefs) that are optimized through action, perception, and learning, as the organism 
navigates, and maintains itself in its environment. Hence, it is said that the generative model 
is ‘entailed’ by the existence of an organism (Friston, 2012; Ramstead et al., 2018a), in the 
sense that it changes as a function of the organism’s normal bioregulatory activity. 
Heuristically, this means that through adaptive action, organisms come to embody a guess 
about the causes of their sensations (i.e., a generative model) by optimizing its beliefs about 
those causes.  
 
An intuitive example of free energy bounding dynamics is the maintenance of core 
body temperature. Human beings tend to maintain their body temperature around 36.5 
degrees Celsius. Human bodies expect to be in typical (phenotypical or characteristic) states; 
surprise is large if the probability of the sensory state is low. So, any deviation from the 
mean, 36.5 degrees Celsius, implies that the organism is in a sensory state with (relatively) 
high surprise. Conversely, surprise is low when the probability of the sensory observation is 
high. Importantly, deviations from the expected (i.e., the mean) state induce active inference.  
 
Active inference refers to the joint optimisation of internal states (e.g., perception) 
and the selection of action policies (i.e., sequences of active states that minimize expected 
free energy), which function hand-in-hand to reduce free energy (resp. surprise). The system 
of nested subsystems reacts as a whole, at various scales, to discrepancies between the 
predictions under the generative model and the actual state of the world. Active inference can 
take many forms in this setting. Reactions to departures from expected temperature include, 
at one scale, individual reactions from temperature-sensitive sensory cells in the skin; the 
raising of individual hairs by skin cells; the registering of a temperature difference by the 
networks of the nervous system, and the body’s subsequent engaging in shivering behaviour. 
More individual, psychological reactions to changes in temperature might include enjoying 
this change (or not); culturally-mediated behavioural reactions to differences in temperature 

200 
 
might come into play as well, relying on elements of the cultural niche. If it is too hot, we 
might take off some clothes; but if one lives in the desert, this exposes one’s bare skin to the 
elements; and to fend off the heat, we might instead put on robes, as Bedouins do in the 
desert.  
 
2.2. Generative models and action policies  
In the variational approach, the form taken by the generative models is that of graphical 
models (Friston, Parr, et al., 2017). The model itself carries correlational information about 
causal factors that lead to the generation of sensory states. So, in a nutshell, the model is 
intrinsically probabilistic and correlational, not causal; in the sense that the generative model, 
by necessity, captures useful probabilistic information about the agent acting in its niche.  
 
Technically, the generative model is just a probability distribution over the joint 
occurrence of sensory states (of the Markov blanket) and the external states generating 
sensory states. It is a normative model, in the sense that it specifies the conditions that allow 
the continued existence of the type of creature being considered. This can be variously 
formulated in terms of the likelihood of some sensory states, given external states and prior 
beliefs over external states. It manifests in active inference via inferential dynamics (i.e., 
action and perception) that flow on free energy gradients, where the free energy is defined in 
terms of a generative model. 
 
However, the variational story is one about how the respective statistical structures of 
the generative model and generative process (the actual causal structure that generated 
observations) become attuned to one another. So, when everything is going well (i.e., when 
the organism engages in adaptive behaviour and thrives in its niche), the correlational 
structure carried by the generative model – ideally – maps onto the causal structure of the 
generative process in the environment. So, while the model is necessarily only ever 
probabilistic, it remains that active inference fits or tunes the generative model to the 
generative process; and by that fact, the generative model gains some causal purchase: 
indeed, the generative model is often described as a probabilistic description of how sensory 
consequences are generated from their causes. Inference then corresponds to the inversion of 
this mapping – to infer causes from consequences. This is inference is, by construction, 
implicit in the minimisation of free energy or the maximisation of model evidence. 
 
One novel way to think about the generative model is in terms of ‘enactment’. On this 
view, minimising free energy essentially means reducing the disattunement between the 
expectations of an organism and the generative model under which actions are selected 

201 
 
(Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014). Active inference is the process of creating and maintaining 
self-organization through action. Under the FEP, active sampling of sensory states is a feature 
of the entire dynamics themselves, which entail a generative model. This speaks to the idea 
that the entire process of attuning the system to its niche involves perceptual inference, but 
especially the selection and expression of relevant action policies – policies that select the 
actions most likely to elude surprise. Minimising expected surprise does not mean avoiding 
sensations, on the contrary, it means resolving uncertainty by seeking out salient, informative 
sensations. This follows simply from the fact that expected surprise (i.e., self-information) 
corresponds to uncertainty (i.e., entropy) (Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck, & 
Pezzulo, 2016b; Friston, Rosch, Parr, Price, & Bowman, 2018) 
 
This implies that the function of the generative model is to guide action in a context-
sensitive fashion; in turn, this speaks to a shift away from viewing the brain in terms of 
Bayesian predictive processing to how the brain enables “feedback loops that maintain 
attunement to the environment and support adaptive behavior” (Anderson, 2017, p. 8). This 
dynamic emphasis on the realisation of biological self-organisation through adaptive action 
clearly aligns the FEP with enactive and pragmatist approaches to cognition (Bruineberg, 
Kiverstein, & Rietveld, 2016; Engel, Friston, & Kragic, 2016; Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017; 
Ramstead et al., 2019) – a point we will explore in greater detail in section 4.  
 
2.3. Markov blankets and the boundaries of cognitive systems  
Under the FEP, the statistical conception of life leads to a formal, statistical ontology of 
living systems (Friston, 2013; Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018a). This ontology 
leverages a statistical formalism; namely, the Markov blanket formalism, which provides a 
principled account of what constitutes a system, and what does not. A Markov blanket is a 
statistical partitioning of a system into internal states and external (i.e., non-constitutive) 
states; where the blanket itself can be partitioned further into sensory and active states (Clark, 
2017; Friston, 2013; Pearl, 1988). This implies that internal and external states are 
conditionally independent from one another, given that internal and external states can only 
influence each other via sensory and active states. 
  
A Markov blanket constitutes the evidential or existential boundary that sets 
something apart from that which it is not. A cell therefore has a Markov blanket – its 
plasmalemma. As do multicellular organisms like Homo Sapiens. Take the cell as an 
example. It arises out of a molecular soup by assembling its own boundaries, thus acquiring 
an identity (Friston, 2013; Varela et al., 1991). For a cell to remain alive, its internal states 

202 
 
must constantly organise and prepare its boundaries – lest it decay, and dissipate into its 
surroundings (Di Paolo, 2009).  
 
This, in turn, implies the maintenance of a statistical boundary that separates internal 
from external states, and vice versa (Friston, 2013). Under the FEP, this statistical boundary 
is an achievement, rather than a given; it is generated and maintained through active inference 
(i.e., adaptive action). This again aligns the FEP with enactive and pragmatist approaches to 
cognition (Engel et al., 2016). Thus, under the FEP, to exist ‘just is’ maintaining the states 
that comprises one’s Markov blanket through active inference. In other words, without a 
Markov blanket and the processes that assemble it, the cell would cease to exist, as there 
would be no way for the cell to restrict itself to a characteristic set of states. In other words, 
there would be no way of establishing the conditional independence between internal states 
and the surrounding environment – and the cell would simply dissolve, dissipate or decay 
into its universe (Hohwy, 2016). 
  
The nice thing about Markov blankets is that they allow us to speak in a meaningful 
(and mathematically tractable) way about conditional independencies between internal and 
external states. Consider again the cell. The intracellular (i.e., internal) states of a cell have an 
existence that is distinct from their external environment. This shows that intracellular and 
extracellular states are conditionally independent. It is the conditional independence (in a 
statistical sense) between internal and external states that are captured – or indeed defined – 
by appeal to the concept of a Markov blanket (see Figure 1). 
 
2.4. A formal ontology for the boundaries of cognitive systems  
This reading of active inference as self-evidencing makes the boundary of cognitive systems 
an existential notion, tied up with the epistemic process of generating evidence for your own 
existence. In a nutshell, then, to enact a generative model is to provide evidence (i.e., to 
generate evidence through adaptive action) for a model of one’s existence.  
 
More specifically, the claim we are making about the status of the boundary of 
cognitive systems is that this boundary is both ontological and epistemological. The 
boundary of a given cognitive system is given by the Markov blanket of that system, which 
carves out or individuates a system by separating systemic states from non-systemic ones. 
The Markov blanket is an ontological boundary, in the sense that this boundary individuates 
the system as the kind of system that it is. It sets apart the states that count as systemic states 
from those that count as part of its surroundings. Markov blankets provide the most 
minimalistic answer to this question, based on the notion of conditional independence. If a 

203 
 
system exists, there must a sense in which the non-systemic parts can change without the 
system of interest changing in concert. Markov blankets formalise this requirement. The 
Markov blanket is a result of the system’s dynamics (i.e., the system’s patterns of adaptive 
action), which means that it is the system’s dynamics itself that carves out the relevant 
boundaries. In other words, the boundary itself is orchestrated and maintained through active 
inference, it is an achievement of the cognitive system that is orchestrated and maintained 
through adaptive action.  
 
We claim that the Markov blanket is an epistemological boundary as well. This is 
because the boundary is realised through active inference, which is a process of self-
evidencing. Self-evidencing means that to exist as a system is to produce evidence of your 
existence. More explicitly, the variational framework suggests that the dynamics of living 
systems entails a generative model of one’s existence. The variational framework tells us how 
the generative model that organisms embody and enact tunes itself to (approximates the 
statistical structure of) the generative process, or actual causal process in the environment that 
causes the sensory states of an organism. To exist as a living being and to engage in adaptive 
action (when all goes well) just is to realise the relations between quantities that are modelled 
in the generative model. In other words, under the FEP, to exist at all means to produce 
evidence for a model of oneself (or more exactly, since the generative model is a control 
system, a model of oneself acting in the world).14 Existence in this sense is fundamentally 
tied up with the creation and maintenance of an informational boundary, i.e. the Markov 
blanket. 
 
The Markov blanket formalism, then, tells us what counts as a system and what does 
not. It provides us with a principled means to determine what it is to be a self-evidencing 
system under the FEP. In this sense, the term existential boundary might be most appropriate: 
the evidential boundary is also an existential boundary. 
 
In summary, when applied to the biological realm, the statistical formalism of the 
Markov blanket provides a way to define the boundaries of a system. To so enshroud the 
internal (constitutive or insular) states of a system behind a Markov blanket enables the 
individuation of a well-defined partition of the system into internal and external states, 
                                                 
14 A very similar conflation of epistemological and ontological notions of a ‘model’ was 
apparent at the inception of cybernetics in the form of the Good Regulator Theorem  (every 
system that regulates its environment must be a good model of that environment) (Conant & 
Ashby, 1970). The free energy principle formalises this notion by equipping existential 
dynamics with an epistemological corollary cast in terms of inference. 

204 
 
mediated by the (active and sensory) states that comprise the Markov blanket itself, and over 
which we can define systemic dynamics. 
 
3. Cognitive boundaries: Externalism and internalism 
In this section we have two agendas. The first is to address externalist or radical views of 
cognition; namely, embodied, enactive, and extended cognition. We will pay special attention 
to enactive formulations of life and mind, highlighting that on this account, the basis of life 
and mind is a nested set of properties: autopoiesis, operational closure, autonomy, and 
adaptivity. The nice thing about this formulation of living and cognitive systems is that it 
allows us both to address the organisational principles of life, as per the enactive framework, 
and speak to how this framework underpins the ideas of cognition as realised across brain, 
body, and world; while, at the same time, giving a special place to embodied activity in the 
assembly of cognitive activities and processes. Our second agenda is to describe how this 
emphasis on (especially) adaptive operational closure could be turned into an argument 
against the enactive view by appeal to the active inference scheme and the Markov blanket 
formalism.   
 
3.1. Externalism: Radical views of cognition 
Embodied approaches to cognition hold that the body is crucial for cognition (Gallagher, 
2006). Extended views suggest that not only are bodies important, the local environment of 
individual cognitive systems can partly realise cognitive processes (Clark, 2008; Clark & 
Chalmers, 1998). Enactive views play up the role of action in the functioning of cognition, 
especially on certain accounts of enactivism tethering mind to the biology of living systems 
(Chemero, 2009; Gallagher, 2017; Thompson, 2010). In this subsection we formulate the 
enactive view associated with the work of Varela and colleagues; so-called autopoietic 
enactivism (Di Paolo, 2009; Di Paolo & Thompson, 2014; Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 
1991). Our focus is selective; the enactive framework not only exemplifies current radical 
views on cognition, it also shares a number of important overlaps with our multiscale 
integrationist view, derived from the FEP.  
 
A central aspect of living and cognitive systems is their individuation. Individuation is 
the process that makes something distinct from something else, and is in this sense consistent 
with our use of the Markov blanket formalism as a means by which to delineate systemic 
boundaries separating systemic from non-systemic states, and vice-versa. Crucially, on the 
enactive account, this process of individuation implies that systems that can self-organise 

205 
 
their own process of individuation are (a) autopoietic, (b) operationally closed, and (c) 
autonomous. Autopoiesis denotes the property of structural self-generation; namely, the 
capacities to (re-)generate and maintain systemic constituents, despite compositional and 
functional change. An autopoietic system can be cast as an operationally closed system. 
Operational closure refers to processes of autopoietic self-assembly, on the one hand, and 
boundary conservation conditioned on interdependent processes, on the other. This is entirely 
consistent with the kind of statistical independence between states induced by the Markov 
blanket formalism, as this implies that the very existence of a living system is premised on 
recurrent processes that work to conserve the integrity of systemic boundaries (see Figure 3).  
 
 
 
Fig. 3. An illustration of operational closure. Here the black circles form part of an operationally closed network 
of self-organising processes. Each black circle has at least one arrow arriving at it and at least one arrow coming 
from it – respectively originating and ending in another black circle. Dashed arrows refer to enabling relations 
between processes in the operationally closed network and processes that do not belong to it. Adapted from Di 
Paolo and Thompson (2014, p. 70). 
 
 
In an operationally closed network each process is affected by another process such that the 
operations of processes comprising the network are dependent on each other. As Di Paolo 

206 
 
and Thompson put it, in relation to this figure: “If we look at any process in black, we 
observe that it has some enabling arrows arriving at it that originate in other processes in 
black, and moreover, that it has some enabling arrows coming out of it that end up also in 
other processes in black. When this condition is met, the black processes form a network of 
enabling relations; this network property is what we mean by operational closure.” Di Paolo 
and Thompson (2014, p. 71). To make this a little more concrete, consider Figure 4.  
 
 
Fig. 4. Schematic illustration of autocatalytic closure. A network of chemical reactions is organized such that 
each reaction is enabled or catalyzed by products of other reactions in the network. From Di Paolo, Buhrmann, 
and Barandiaran (2017, p. 113). 
 
 
 
This figure describes a network of four reactions, r1, r2, r3, and r4, each of which is 
enabled – in the sense of being accelerated to sufficiently fast rates – by the molecules of 
type, a, b, and c, which are themselves the products of the same reactions (Di Paolo et al., 
2017). This is an example of an operationally closed network, given that – as a whole – the 
set is able to enable its own production.  
 
Given what we have said in Section 2, it is fairly straightforward to establish that the 
Markov blanket formalism provides a statistical formulation of operational closure (Kirchhoff 
et al., 2018). In the same way that active and sensory states of Markov blankets couple 
internal and external states – via an informational dynamics – operational closure does not 
imply that the systemic (i.e., operationally enclosed) states are cut-off from external states. 
To see this, note that autonomy implies that an operationally closed network of self-enabling 
processes can modulate its relation to the embedding environment. If this were not so, the 
network would stop or run down. The nice thing about the emphasis on autonomy is that it 

207 
 
speaks directly to adaptivity, the basic capacity to act purposefully and probabilistically, as 
the basis of the self-organisation of life and cognition (Di Paolo, 2005). In the context of the 
FEP, this is called adaptive active inference (Kirchhoff, 2018a, 2018b). 
 
This enactive view of living and cognitive systems exemplifies a radical view of 
cognition; i.e., a view that breaks faith with the standard assumptions about internalism. First, 
autopoietic enactivism is a denial of any kind of internalism, given that it is entirely possible 
for operationally closed dynamics to be realised in an extensive network of processes 
breaking across neural and non-neural variables (De Jaegher & Di Paolo, 2007). Second, 
autopoietic enactivism denies what is a usual starting point of so-called first-wave or 
functionalist arguments for the extended mind thesis. First-wave arguments starts by taking 
the individual as the default cogniser and only then asks whether some worldly elements can 
play functionally similar roles to mental states or cognitive processes realised internally 
(Clark & Chalmers, 1998). So these arguments for the extended mind assume a kind of 
internalism in their formulation (for similar critiques, see Kirchhoff, 2012; Menary, 2010). 
Finally, autopoietic enactivism holds the view that cognition is a relational phenomenon 
between an organism and its environment (Thompson & Stapleton, 2009). 
 
3.2. Internalism: Pushing back  
Despite its influence in the sciences of life and mind, the enactive approach can be put under 
pressure. Indeed, a specific formulation of the FEP, turning on the Markov blanket 
formalism, arguably pushed back against any of these radical views of cognition (Hohwy, 
2016, 2017). Our aim in this subsection is to (briefly) rehearse some of the main steps of this 
internalist argument. We develop a counterargument to the internalist position in the next 
section, which gives an information-theoretic justification for the view that the boundaries of 
cognition are nested and multiple.  
 
In a nutshell, the internalist argument states that the relevant boundary for cognitive 
systems and cognition is essentially the boundary of the brain or skull. Internalists take the 
inferential seclusion of internal states in active inference – that internal (systemic) states are 
hidden behind the veil of the statistical Markov blanket – to imply that the boundaries of 
cognition stop at the boundaries of the brain given the presence of a brain-bound Markov 
blanket (Hohwy, 2016; Seth, 2014). 
 
A crucial aspect of this argument is the assumption that the brain itself is a generative 
model of its environment, one that “garners evidence for itself by explaining away sensory 

208 
 
input” (Hohwy, 2017, p. 1) by a process of variational Bayesian inference15. This means that 
through active inference, a cognitive system minimises its variational free energy, thereby 
securing the evidence for its generative model, and inferring the hidden causes of its 
observations (sensory data). Cognitive processes (e.g., attention, learning, decision, 
perception, and so on) are processes that work to optimise internal states in accordance with 
the FEP – and implicit self-evidencing (Hohwy, 2016). 
  
The next, crucial step is the statistical partitioning of a system into internal and 
external states through the Markov blanket formalism. This captures the notion that internal 
(neural) and external (environmental) states are conditionally independent; capable of 
influencing one another only via sensory and active states. Internalists interpret the Markov 
blanket as enforcing an evidentiary boundary severing, in an epistemic and causal sense, the 
brain from its body and environment. Thus, Hohwy concludes: the “mind begins where 
sensory input is delivered through exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive receptors 
and ends where proprioceptive predictions are delivered, mainly in the spinal cord.” (Hohwy, 
2016, p. 276).  
 
The issue of internalism comes up when these two notions, the Markov blanket and 
active inference, are combined in the free energy formulation. Proponents of internalist 
readings of the FEP argue that the presence of a Markov blanket implies that systems that 
minimise their free energy, on average and over time, ipso facto, are epistemically and 
causally secluded from their environment. The upshot of such a conception is that the 
boundaries of cognition stop at the skull. Mind is a skull-bound phenomenon. The rationale 
for this way of thinking is that the spontaneous formation of Markov ensembles realizes a 
form of Bayesian inference (active inference). Active inference carves out coherent neural 
ensembles, which are neural ensembles (Hebbian assemblies) ‘wrapped’ in a Markov blanket 
(Hohwy, 2016; Yufik & Friston, 2016). This means that cognition implies the transient 
assembly of such brain-bound Markovian ensembles.  
 
This internalist rendition of internal states, hidden behind of curtains of the Markov 
blanket, leads to a neo-Kantian or Helmholtzian account of cognition that emphasises its 
indirect nature (Anderson, 2017; Bruineberg et al., 2016). The Markov ensembles are said to 
infer external states, and this inference is taken to be a content-involving affair. This means 
                                                 
15Also known as approximate Bayesian inference. Variational or approximate Bayesian 
inference necessarily entails the minimisation of variational free energy, under a generative 
model and an assumed form for posterior beliefs. 

209 
 
that inferences are over content-involving states (in the sense that internal states that are 
about things in the world), which are cast as hypotheses and beliefs16. The idea is that 
organisms leverage their generative model to infer the most likely hidden causes of its 
sensory states. This is a Helmholtzian interpretation of the FEP (Bruineberg et al., 2016). On 
this reading, active inference is understood on an analogy with scientific inference, as literal 
hypothesis-testing.  
 
This kind of neo-Kantian schism between mind and world is taken to imply that the 
contact of a cognitive system with its environment – perceptually or behaviourally – is 
mediated by its internal (neural) states, often interpreted as representations encoded in 
hierarchical generative models that are realised in the brain’s cortical architecture 
(Gładziejewski, 2016; Gładziejewski & Miłkowski, 2017; Williams, 2017). We shall not 
dwell on the question whether these internal states are representations – for contrasting 
interpretations, see (Kirchhoff & Robertson, 2018) versus (Kiefer & Hohwy, 2017). 
However, in the next section, we consider whether internalist interpretations of Markov 
blankets and generative models are appropriate.    
 
4. Multiscale Integration: Nested and multiple boundaries 
In this section, we argue that the internalist interpretation of the boundaries of cognition rests 
on a problematic interpretation of what generative models are, and the kind of properties they 
have under the FEP. Crucially, we agree with internalism that any relevant mind-world 
relation is mediated by processes that can be cast as both assembling and finessing the 
generative model. But this is just to say that we can describe how internal and external states 
are statistically coupled to one another via intricate and complex sensorimotor dynamics 
(Gallagher & Allen, 2016; Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017).  
 
4.1. Generative models: what they are, and how they are used to study cognition  
First, we take issue with the claim that, under the FEP, the generative model is something 
internal to the organism (i.e., that the generative model comprises neuronal vehicles or any 
other vehicles). Rather, the generative model is a mathematical construct that explains how 
the quantities embodied by the system’s architecture change to transcribe (i.e., update beliefs 
                                                 
16 This ‘aboutness’ is a key aspect of the FEP and follows from the fact that internal states 
encode or parameterise a probability distribution over external states. In other words, internal 
states are the sufficient statistics of Bayesian beliefs (about external states). See Ramstead et 
al. (2018a, Box 4).  

210 
 
about) the causes of the system’s sensory observation. What should be at stake in the debate 
between internalists and externalists is the status of the ‘guess’ that the organism embodies; 
namely, the posterior beliefs17 encoded by internal states, and whether this guess does, or 
does not constitute the limit of ‘cognition’, understood as the avoidance of surprisal, or 
informational homeostasis. 
 
The posterior belief (i.e., recognition density) represents the system’s ‘best guess’ 
regarding the causes of its sensory states, and is embodied or encoded by the states of the 
organism; technically, internal states of the Markov blanket (Friston, 2012). Under the FEP, 
the system’s posterior belief is refined or ‘tuned’ under the generative model, through a 
process of variational (approximate Bayesian) inference, and becomes a tight bound on the 
true posterior belief it aspires to (Friston et al., 2016b). 
 
The generative model is a statistical construct that transcribes the expected sensory 
causal regularities in the process generating sensory states. The generative model is used to 
model the set of viable phenotypical statistical relations (preferences, and action policies) that 
must be brought forth by the organism in active inference: in short, a model of a viable state 
of being for the organism. Through active inference, internal states are tuned and this tuning 
changes its posterior belief, and hence the organism’s ‘best guess’ about what caused its 
sensations (that usually include its own actions). In other words, a generative model can be 
used to understand how organisms are able to track (infer) their own behaviour.  
 
The FEP is based on the idea that the functions and changes in the structure of living 
systems conform to approximate Bayesian inference. This assumption rests on the claim 
according to which living systems avoid surprise (cf. Section 2.); approximate Bayesian 
inference under the FEP, then, is just one sensible strategy to understand how living systems 
avoid surprise and the dispersion of their sensory states. It rests on what we described earlier 
as the generative model (the control system), the recognition density (the living system), and 
the generative process (the external world, which includes the organism’s actions). Simply 
put, the relation between these is that the recognition density changes as a function of the 
control system; and because the control system constitutes expectations about the world 
conditioned upon the preferences of the living system, the living system turns out to change 
                                                 
17 By definition, the posterior belief encoded by internal states approximates the true posterior 
belief when free energy is minimised. It is often referred to as a recognition density or 
approximate posterior belief. 

211 
 
so as to become (statistically) consistent with the preferred world; that is, according to its 
preferences and expectations about the world. 
 
Under the FEP, ‘cognition’ is what the recognition density, or living system does (i.e., 
changing to elude surprises and maintaining informational homeostasis by minimizing free 
energy), and the way one studies cognition (i.e., what the system does), is by developing, 
simulating, and analysing the possible generative models that explain how the recognition 
density of interest (the system of interest) changes so as to attain minimal free energy.  
 
In other words, ‘drawing the bounds cognition’ means defining the recognition 
density of the system of interest, and identifying a generative model that explains changes in 
that system that follow variational Bayesian inference18. In this sense, cognitive science 
might be understood as the study of generative models and processes: it is in the business of 
modelling the correlational or causal structure of actions and observations of the organism. 
The generative model, then, is not the vehicle of something like content or mutual 
information; instead, it is the tool that we use to study cognitive systems (as explanatory 
model), and indeed, perhaps more speculatively, the guide, or path living systems entail and 
follow to stay alive (as control systems). The vehicle is the recognition density (also called 
the variational density), the ‘best guess’ that the system of interest embodies, and whose 
function and structure can be studied using the generative model.  
 
This means that we can study cognition meaningfully as it occurs in individuated 
systems at the respective scales at which those systems exist; e.g., the brain in ontogeny, or 
large-scale ensembles like species over phylogenetic time. Since organization at each level 
depends upon the integration to the entire dynamics, one can also study cognition ‘across 
boundaries’. Below, we will see that we can formalise how the system moves from one state 
to the other in terms of a free energy bounding dynamics. This dynamics integrates systems 
of systems; all individuated as nested Markov blankets of Markov blankets. 
 
In summary, we are suggesting that organisms use a statistical trick – i.e., the 
minimization of variational free energy – to track the causes of their sensory states and to 
select appropriate actions. The key is to note that organisms are organized such that they 
instantiate the prior that their actions will minimise free energy. This mechanics of belief is 
                                                 
18 This is especially true in specialised fields such as computational psychiatry, where a 
crucial part of the generative model – namely prior beliefs – completely specify behaviours 
and preferences. This means that any behavioural phenotype can be, in principle, quantified 
or understood in terms of prior beliefs. See Schwartenbeck and Friston (2016) for a worked 
example. 

212 
 
the only causally relevant aspect of the variational free energy. The free energy may or may 
not exist; what is at stake is the causal consequences of the action-guiding beliefs of 
organisms and groups of organisms, which are harnessed and finessed in the generative 
model (Ramstead et al., 2019). What matters is that organisms are organized such that they 
instantiate such a prior to guide their action.  
 
4.2. Enactivism 2.0.  
The generative model, as we have seen, functions as a control system. That is, its function for 
the cognitive system is to generate of adaptive patterns of behaviour. In the parlance of the 
FEP, its purpose is to guide the evaluation and selection of relevant action policies (Friston et 
al., 2016b). The generative model is a strange beast in the variational framework, in that it 
exists only insofar as it underwrites the organism’s inference about states of affairs and 
subsequent action selection. Since the free energy expected following an action, which 
determines the policy to be selected, is defined in terms of the generative model, the latter is 
the cornerstone of the self-evidencing process.   
 
This emphasis on adaptive action aligns active inference with one brand of radical 
accounts of cognition, namely enactivism. Indeed, it has been argued that the FEP provides 
an implementation of enactivism, and in a sense supersedes or absorbs classical (i.e., 
autopoietic) formulations of enactivism (i.e., Froese & Di Paolo, 2011; Thompson, 2010). 
(See Kirchhoff, 2018a; Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017, for a detailed argument to this effect). 
Active inference is inherently a pragmatist or enactive formulation, and can be contrasted 
with non-enactive appeals to Bayesian principles of cognition, such as predictive coding.  
 
However, because it relies fundamentally on formulations from information theory, 
active inference is in tension with a few of the more (arguably) conservative elements of the 
enactive theory. Indeed, classical enactivism has typically rejected the appeal to information 
theory to describe cognition (e.g., Thompson, 2010). We believe this is a hangover from 
another age in cognitive science. And, more to the point, this conservatism has not prevented 
the proponents of active inference from taking up the banner of enactivism (Bruineberg et al., 
2016; Engel et al., 2016; Kirchhoff & Robertson, 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018a). Active 
inference provides a theoretical model for enactment. Allen (2018) has called this form of 
enactivism, based in information theory, ‘enactivism 2.0’, or Bayesian enactivism. 
           
 
 

213 
 
4.3. Nestedness: or how to study cognition beyond the brain 
The existence of Markov blankets at one scale means that interaction amongst components at 
that scale are mediated by states belonging to their respective Markov blankets. These active 
exchanges have a sparsity structure that induces nested sets of Markov blankets – that is, 
Markov blankets of Markov blankets (Kirchhoff et al., 2018; Ramstead et al., 2018a). The 
central idea behind the multiscale integration of Markov blankets is that the particular 
statistical form and the specific partitioning rule that governs the Markov blanket allows for 
the assembly for larger and larger Markov blankets (of cells, of organs, of organisms, of 
environments, and so on). This is because Markov blankets at increasingly larger scales of 
systemic organisation recapitulate the statistical form of Markov blankets at smaller 
microscopic scales of systemic organisation. This can be shown to follow from the 
observation that any meaningful statistical separation between internal and external states at 
the scale of, for example, complex organisms, a macroscale Markov blanket must be present, 
whose sensory and active states, distinguish this organism from its local niche, and which 
itself is composed of smaller and smaller Markov blankets sharing the same statistical form 
as the macroscopic Markov blanket (see Figure 5) 
 
Figure 5 illustrates the idea of Markov blanket formation at any scale of hierarchical 
and systemic organisation, thus speaking to the notion that organisms and their local 
environment will be “defined not by a singular Markov blanket, but by a near-infinite regress 
of causally interacting Markov blankets within Markov blankets.” (Allen & Friston, 2016, p. 
19). This, in turn, provides an integrated perspective from which to approach the multiple 
scales of self-organisation in living systems. 
 
 

214 
 
 
Fig. 5. Blankets of blankets. This figure depicts the recursively nested structure of Markov blankets that forms 
the basis of our formal ontology of cognitive systems. In this scheme, successively larger and slower scale 
dynamics arise from, and constrain, those dynamics arising at subordinate (smaller and faster) scales. Consider 
an ensemble of vector states (here, in the lower panel, nine such states are depicted). The conditional 
dependencies between these vector states define a particular partition of the system into particles (upper panels). 
The effect of this partition into particles is, in turn, to partition each of these particles into blanket states and 
internal states. Blanket states comprise active states (red) and sensory states (magenta). Given this new partition, 
we can summarize the behaviour of each particle in terms of (slow) eigenmodes or mixtures of its blanket states, 
which in turn produces vector states at the next (higher) scale. These constitute an ensemble of vector states and 
the process can begin anew. The upper panels depict this bipartition into active and sensory states for a single 
particle (left panel) and for an ensemble of particles. The insets at the top of the figure illustrate the self-
similarity that arises as we move from one scale to the next. In this figure, Ω·b denotes a linear mixture of 
blanket states that decay sufficiently slowly to contribute to the dynamics at the level above. Adapted from 
Ramstead et al. (2018a). 
 
 
 
The multiscale partition of model parameters, encoded by internal states of the 
Markov blanket, attunes itself to the sufficient statistics of the generative process that 
generated the sensory observations, tuning its internal states by bounding free energy. This 
process occurs at and across spatiotemporal scales, effectively integrating the system through 
dynamics. Indeed, for each system individuated at a given scale, one can define a generative 

215 
 
model entailed by the dynamics at the scale above; which speaks to the complementarity 
between specialisation and statistical segregation, on the other hand, and functional 
integration, on the other (Badcock, Friston, & Ramstead, 2019).  
 
Free energy is an additive or extensive quantity minimised by a multiscale dynamics 
integrating the entire system across its spatiotemporal partitions (Ramstead et al., 2019). 
There is also, therefore, only one free energy for the entire system, which is simply the sum 
of free energies at all the relevant scales (see Figure 6). The whole system dynamics leverage 
internal states across temporal and spatial scales, to integrate the system across scales. This 
means that the variational approach accommodates both multiscale partition of the 
recognition density, and a multiscale integration (through active inference).  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 6. Multiscale self-organization and active inference. This figure depicts variational free energy being 
minimised across scales through active inference. It presents the results from a simulation of morphogenesis 
using the active inference framework (Friston et al., 2015). The simulation used a gradient descent on 
variational free energy to simulate a group of cells self-assembling into a larger pattern (i.e., target morphology). 
The simulation employed an ensemble of eight cells. Each cell was equipped with the same generative model, 

216 
 
which is a metaphor for shared genetic information. This generative model generated a prediction of what each 
cell would sense and signal to other cells (chemotactically) for any given location in a target morphology. In 
other words, the model predicted what each cell would expect to sense and signal if it were in that location 
(lower middle panel – extracellular target signal). Each cell engaged in active inference, by actively moving 
around to infer its place in the target morphology relative to other cells. In doing so, each cell minimised its own 
variational free energy (and by proxy, its surprise or self-information). Remarkably, the fact that all cells shared 
the same generative model allowed their individual active inference to minimise the free energy of the 
ensemble, which exists at the scale above the individual cells. Each of the cells that make up the ensemble 
shares the same generative model. Crucially, the sensory evidence for the model with which each cell is 
equipped is generated by another cell. The arrangement that minimises the free energy of the ensemble is the 
target morphology. This means that each cell has to ‘find its place’; the configuration in which they all have 
found their place is the one where each cell minimises its own surprise about the signals it senses (because it 
knows its place), and in which the ensemble minimises the total free energy as well. The upper panels show the 
time courses of expectations about the place of each cell in the target morphology (upper left), as well as the 
associated active states that mediate cell migration and signal expression (upper middle). The resulting 
trajectories have been projected onto the first (vertical) direction and color-coded to show cell differentiation 
(upper right). The trajectories of each individual cell progressively, and collectively, minimize total free energy 
of the entire ensemble (lower left panel), which illustrates the minimization of free energy across scales. The 
lower right panel shows the configuration that results from active inference. Here, the trajectory is shown in 
small circles (for each time step). The insert corresponds to the target configuration. In short, all multiscale 
ensembles that are able to endure over time must destroy free energy gradients, which integrates system 
dynamics within and between scales. Adapted from Friston et al. (2015). 
 
 
 
The underlying philosophical point is that states that are statistically isolated by 
Markov boundaries become integrated under one dynamics in active inference; they come to 
parameterise one generative model (the one entailed by the adaptive behaviour of the whole 
system), thereby guiding one integrated action across temporal and spatial scales. Internal 
states that are inferentially secluded at one scale become absorbed into higher order Markov 
blankets and dynamics at the scale above. This means that the epistemic seclusion of 
internalism is, in a sense, illusory or partial; since the entire organism engages in active 
inference across scales. Under the FEP, inferential seclusion coexists with existential 
(pragmatic) integration through dynamics (i.e., adaptive behaviour).  
 
This perspective vindicates an integrationist ontology of the boundaries of cognition, 
while retaining the possibility of granting epistemic priority to any of these boundaries, given 
explanatory interests. The nested Markov blankets perspective answers the question of how 
to understand the generative model from this multiscale perspective. The challenge, now, is 

217 
 
to develop the theoretical apparatus to describe the boundaries of cognition at higher scales. 
We address this issue in the next subsection.  
 
In a nutshell, at any scale, the relevant Markov-blanketed systems are composed of 
parts that, in virtue of their (relative) conditional independence, can also be described as 
Markov blanketed systems. Each of these separate Markov blanketed subsystems might count 
as separate systems, i.e., one cognitive subsystem can be a nested part of another system. 
However, all these nested boundaries are integrated within the same system. More precisely, 
all the subsystems that are individuated by their own Markov blanket are integrated as one 
single dynamical system through the system dynamics (i.e., adaptive action). Collectively, 
there is only one (hierarchical) generative model and therefore one free energy functional, for 
the ensemble of nested blankets (where each constituent blanket itself has a generative model 
and accompanying free energy functional). This sort of nesting is particularly prescient for 
hierarchical systems like the brain. In this brain-bound setting, the integrated Markov blanket 
could be regarded as comprising the brain’s sensory epithelia and motor (or autonomic) 
efferents, while internally nested Markov blankets are a necessary feature of neuronal (e.g., 
cortical) hierarchies (Shipp, 2016; Zeki, 2005; Zeki & Shipp, 1988). At each and every level 
of the cortical hierarchy the associated free energy is minimised by neuronal dynamics, such 
that the total free energy of the brain is upper-bounded in accord with the FEP. 
 
4.4. Multiplicity: or how to describe cognition beyond the brain  
Central to our discussion is the concept of joint phenotype, which we have introduced in 
Section 1 in terms of repertoire of highly probable states and traits. Some of those states are 
contained within the organism (e.g., brain states), and other traits extend far beyond the 
internal states of an organism (e.g., states of the niche). We use the concept of joint 
phenotype to support our description of the boundaries of cognition at higher scales.   
 
Typically, joint phenotypes are seen as shared ‘extended phenotypes’ (Dawkins, 
1982). Extended phenotypes are traits (e.g., niche construction outcomes like beaver dams) 
that, like physiological states, undergo selection due to their fitness enhancing impact. In the 
case of an extended trait, the impact is on the genes having favoured the reproduction of that 
extended trait (e.g., beavers’ genetic disposition to build dams).  
 
Extended phenotypes, therefore, are extensions from genes to the extended trait. 
Accordingly, the typical view of the joint phenotype broadly construed describes coextensive 
phenotypic traits consistent with two or more different species’ genetic makeup. In that case, 

218 
 
all parties can be ‘joint owners’ of the trait; for instance, the insect and the plant are joint 
owners of the portion of the leaf eaten by the insect (Queller, 2014).  
 
The FEP interpretation of the joint phenotype that interests us here brings this a step 
further. On that view, coextensive phenotypic traits do not need to be included in the 
extended phenotype. They can include biotic or abiotic traits, like ecological cascades 
produced by niche construction, or other ‘seemingly’ random effects of organismic activity. 
These are not directly related to the genetic makeup of either party, while nonetheless being 
seen as having a systematic and evolutionary significant impact on fitness.  
 
With the FEP, one can study organism-niche complementarity that obtains through 
phenotypic accommodation and niche construction over development (i.e., adaptation) using 
variational free energy (Bruineberg, Rietveld, Parr, van Maanen, & Friston, 2018; Constant, 
Ramstead, et al., 2018), and thereby predict the influence of a trait on fitness. Hence, one can 
conceive of and study joint phenotypic traits as non-genetically specified traits by studying 
the changes in the statistical relationship that bounds those traits to the states of the 
organism(s). 
 
Now, the point we want to motivate here is that – especially in humans – many traits 
of the constructed niche defining the human joint phenotype increase state-trait 
complementarity by smoothing the attunement process, or variational free energy minimising 
process. For instance, in developmental psychology and niche construction theory, it is 
argued that the material artefacts populating human niches enable individuals to deal with 
perceptual uncertainty (Christopoulos & Tobler, 2016; Dissanayake, 2009) by constraining, 
and directing sensory fluctuations in their surrounding (Constant, Bervoets, et al., 2018).  
 
Briefly, computing expected free energy requires computing the cost of a policy 
(where the cost is given in terms of the divergence between posterior beliefs and preference 
about sensory outcomes), and the expected ambiguity, or expected ‘certainty’ about the 
sensory outcome relative to one’s beliefs about the state of the world (i.e., expected surprise) 
(see Friston et al. 2016a,b for a detailed treatment). Artefacts that populate human niches can 
be seen as doing much of the legwork in computing the expected ambiguity term that 
constitute expected free energy. In that sense, they ease the modelling activity of the 
organism, understood as expected variational free energy minimization (Constant, Ramstead, 
et al., 2018); cf. epistemic affordance (Parr & Friston, 2017).   
 
Thus, especially in humans, when taking the FEP perspective, one can include 
external, joint phenotypic traits within the boundaries of cognition for higher scales systems 
like joint phenotypes, or bodies-environment systems. It also means that under the FEP, one 

219 
 
could meaningfully study cognition ‘from outside the brain’, for instance, by producing a 
generative model of an higher scale system (e.g., that of the leaf-insect system) and by 
simulating the effects of external factors on variational free energy, like environmental cues 
(Sutton, 2007); cultural practices (Vygotsky, 1978); ecological information (Gibson, 1979). 
Again, this speaks to the idea that the relevant boundaries of cognitive systems are relative to 
explanatory interests (e.g., cognition from the point of view of neurophysiology for cognitive 
neuroscientists, or cognition from the point of view of ecology, for behavioural ecologists).  
 
The Markov blanket formalism might allow us to study the transient assembly of 
cognitive boundaries over time, in the spirit of the models considered above. Indeed, the 
original simulation studies employing the Markov blanket formalism were about the carving 
out of Markov boundaries by the dynamics of free energy minimization (Friston, 2013). The 
variational framework, then, might allow us to model how organisms extend their Markov 
blankets into the environment, at a host of different spatial and temporal scales (Ramstead et 
al., 2019); e.g., to model the spider’s web extending its ensemble of sensory states to include 
states outside its body (Kirchhoff & Froese, 2017).  
 
In summary, the boundaries of cognitive systems are nested in that any system is 
made up of components, which (given that they, too, exist in a minimal sense) have a 
boundary that can be formalised as a Markov blanket. A given organism is essentially a 
hierarchical set of nested Markov blankets. Furthermore, there is a hierarchical listing of 
scales, in the sense that every state at a given scale is itself a mixture of blanket states at a 
smaller scale (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). The subsystems of interest here range from intra-
cellular blanketed systems (e.g., organelles) to the blanket of the entire species. By the very 
fact that they are nested in this way, up to the scale of the species, the boundaries of any 
cognitive process of cognitive dynamics are multiple, in the sense that cognitive systems at 
different scales are integrated in one multiscale cognitive dynamics. The boundaries and scale 
that are relevant will depend on the kind of investigation we are aiming at, the phenomenon 
that is of interest, etc. 
 
Concluding remarks: Towards multidisciplinary research heuristics for cognitive 
science 
In this paper, we have attempted to overcome a common tendency to think of the boundaries 
of cognitive systems as either brain-based, embodied, or ecological/environmental by 
appealing to a multiscale interpretation of Markov blankets under the variational FEP. The 

220 
 
resulting multiscale integrationist perspective suggests that the boundaries of cognition are 
multiple and nested. 
 
Some of the radical externalist views on cognition that we have discussed suggest that 
the divide between internalism and externalism is problematic (Thompson & Stapleton, 
2009). We agree, precisely because each of these two options begs the question over where to 
look for the realisers of cognition. We argued in favour of an ontological pluralism based on 
a multiscale formulation of Markov blankets under the FEP. We argued that ontologically, 
states statistically insular or segregated at one scale are integrated by the dynamics (i.e., 
adaptive behaviour) at scales above. States separated by their respective Markov blankets are 
dynamically and statistically linked as states of the same higher-order system. The 
recursively nested, multilevel formulations of the Markov blanket formalism under the FEP 
allow to study the realisers of cognition, while acknowledging that they are a moving target; 
they shift according to the level of inquiry.  
 
Some radical externalist views, enactive approaches especially, cast cognition as a 
relational phenomenon that equally recruits states of the brain, the body, and the world. The 
view we propose here agrees with the relational aspect of this project, but rejects the a priori 
emphasis in the assumption that all factors contribute equality to the causal patterns of 
interest. That cognition is inherently relational, that it integrates the contribution of states that 
are internal (systemic) and external to any given boundary, does not imply that the 
contributions of all relevant components are equal. Certain kinds of cognition rely mainly on 
the contributions of internal states (e.g., mental calculations); other activities are more 
embodied, and rely mainly on physiological or morphological states (e.g., walking); and other 
still depend most on the influence of abiotic, environmental factors or culturally patterned 
practices (e.g., driving a car). The approach we advocate here casts cognition as radically 
relational at each scale, even within the brain; e.g., relations between cells, relations to the 
brain’s microenvironment, between different networks or again, between different patterns of 
functionally integrated units; without for all that endorsing the view that nothing matters 
more than anything else. This speaks to the necessity of methodological pluralism in 
cognitive science; and to the importance of developing new interdisciplinary research 
heuristics to determine and study, for any phenomenon, the relevant levels of description that 
are necessary to account for it.  
 
Our multiscale integrationist formulation of the boundaries of cognition rejects any 
kind of essentialism about the boundaries of cognition. It suggests that explanations of 
cognition will differ conditioned on the phenomenon and our explanatory interests. In this 

221 
 
sense we are more aligned with Clark (2008) when he encourages us to “let a thousand 
flowers bloom” (p. 117). However, we restrict the scope of this gardening project by arguing 
that the FEP plays a coordinating and constraining role on the kind of explanations one 
should be looking for in the cognitive sciences.

9. A comprehensive scholarly discussion of all the findings 
 
9.1. Overview   
Generally speaking, the main outcomes of the work presented in this doctoral thesis are 
twofold. First, the papers in this thesis collectively proposed a model of explanation and a 
formalism that are apt to enable and guide the study of multiscale systemic dynamics. This 
model of explanation and formalism rest on three integrative theoretical frameworks for 
studying cognitive systems at and across spatiotemporal scales. Second, this thesis proposed 
an argument, based on this model of explanation and formalism, against essentialism about 
the boundaries of cognitive systems in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences.  
 
The three frameworks that were proposed in this thesis are: (1) a theoretical 
framework for understanding and modelling human sociocultural action, cognition, and 
learning, and the ways in which culture permeates possibilities for human action, called the 
cultural affordances framework; (2) a novel theoretical approach to neuroethology, which is 
the study of the mechanics and coevolution of adaptive behaviour and structures that control 
it (typically brains), called variational neuroethology; and (3) a new approach to cognitive 
ecology, that is, the study of how organisms and environments adapt to one another across 
time. This provides a theoretical framework to draw the boundaries around higher-order 
cognitive systems – and to formulate a physics of sentient systems – called variational 
ecology. Taken together, these three frameworks constitute an explanatory model that 
cognitive scientists can leverage to study the dynamics of systems that exist at and across the 
spatial and temporal scales at which they are manifest.  
 
The main philosophical outcome of this thesis is an argument against essentialist 
conceptions of the boundaries of cognitive systems. That is, by leveraging the above model 
and formalism, one can overcome conceptions of cognitive systems that privilege one single 
type of boundary over others. The thesis advances ontological and methodological pluralism 
as a consequence. Ontological pluralism means that the boundaries of cognitive systems must 
be understood as multiple and nested, and that which among these boundaries is the most 
salient to cognitive scientists will be determined relative to their interests. Methodological 
pluralism is a corollary of the ontological kind; and means that, given the multitude and 
heterogeneity of cognitive boundaries, the best course of action to study cognitive systems 
will inevitably have to draw from different methodologies, from neuroimaging and genetic 
sequencing to behavioural measures and ethnographic techniques – and on various 
mathematical and statistical techniques to integrate and interpret these measures.  

229 
 
 
The outcomes of my doctoral research have bearings on theoretical work in the 
cognitive sciences and for the simulation of the dynamics of cognitive systems, and also 
pertain to scientific research culture. The cultural affordances framework, variational 
neuroethology, and variational ecology are (meta-) theories of cognitive systems that can 
provide an integrative, fully generalizable framework enabling the study and modelling of the 
dynamics and interactions of nested cognitive systems embedded in their ecological niche – 
from microscopic phenomena such as cellular and subcellular processes, to mesoscopic 
phenomena, such as neural dynamics, homeostasis, and adaptive action; to macroscopic 
phenomena, such as niche construction and evolution by natural selection.  
 
In this final section, I will discuss the main implications of the work undertaken in 
this thesis, and unpack what I take to be the main limitations of this work. The first 
implication concerns the formal ontology that was developed in the last three chapters of the 
thesis, and how it relates to the philosophical debate between internalism and externalism 
about the boundaries of cognitive systems in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences, rather 
than engaging with the debate between emergentism and reductionism. The second concerns 
the limits and explanatory scope of the variational framework that was developed in the 
second and third chapters. The third concerns the limitations and blind spots of the approach 
to culture and cognition that was developed in the first chapter. The fourth set of 
considerations regards the relations between my doctoral project and phenomenological 
philosophy.  
 
9.2. A formal ontology for multiscale systems: Against a priori metaphysics of 
emergence, and towards a naturalistic ontology of nested systems 
The work presented in this thesis was premised on the notion that the debate between 
internalism and externalism in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences was more prescient – 
to clarify what was at stake in the study of multiscale systemic dynamics – than the debate 
between emergentism and reductionism. The choice to focus on this debate (instead of 
engaging the closely related debate over the epistemological status of downward causation 
and the metaphysics of emergent properties and their relation to the basal phenomena from 
which they emerge) may seem a bit contentious. This section will attempt to justify this 
choice and to consider the implications of the arguments and frameworks afforded by this 
thesis.   
 
One of the main theoretical results of the work in this thesis is a multiscale formal 
ontology of cognitive systems. An ontology simpliciter, in this context, is a meta-theory that 

230 
 
tells us about the kinds of things that exist according to a given target theory – that is, a 
typology of the kinds of systems that exist and that can be studied using the resources of that 
theory. A formal ontology is the application of a formalism (typically, a logical, 
mathematical, statistical formalism) in order to answer the kinds of questions that are raised 
by ontology. Typically, in philosophy, the task of constructing an ontology, that is, of 
determining the kinds of things that exist, what we can say about them, and the criteria for 
‘thinghood’ – as it were – are left to conceptual analysis. More precisely, these questions are 
typically addressed in an a priori fashion by metaphysics. To use a formalism to answer 
ontological questions is not unheard of. Philosopher nowadays turn to metaphysics to answer 
questions of this kind. Much work in metaphysics – classics as well as more contemporary 
work – concerns the application of logical formalisms, especially modal logic, to make sense 
of ontological issues (Lewis, 1986; Quine, 1961; Williamson, 2013). This work in analytic 
metaphysics has become a standard and popular way to deal with issues surrounding the 
development and articulation of particular ontologies. For example, much of the work done 
on emergent phenomena has been about specifying the right kind of logical relation between 
emergent (typically, mental) and basal (typically, physical) phenomena.  
 
Much of this work has focused on varieties of the supervenience relation (Davidson, 
1980/1970; Kim, 1993, 1999, 2006; Yoshimi, 2007, 2011, 2012). Briefly, supervenience is 
defined as a relation between properties or events, say A and B, where A supervenes on B if 
and only if there can be no changes in A without a corresponding change with respect to B. 
This might seem like a relation adequate to model relations between nested systems. 
However, upon reflection, while it may be adequate to capture relations between mental 
states (or events or properties) and physical ones, it almost invariably commits one to the 
causal inertness of supervening things on basal ones (Kim, 1989) – a consequence that we 
have tried to avoid in this thesis. It seems like supervenience is not specific enough to capture 
exactly the kind of nesting relation that we need to address multiscale causal dynamics. 
Supervenience is a purely logical construction, the relata of which can be very abstract 
properties, bearing little connection to the concerns of cognitive scientists – and it is not 
specifically tailored to address the kinds of issues that arise in the study multiscale systemic 
dynamics. Consider, for instance, the property of being F, whatever F may be. For any 
property F, the property of being not-F supervenes on that of being F – since, trivially, there 
cannot be a change with respect to F-ness without a change with respect not-F-ness. This 
hardly seems like a basis specific enough to link systemic phenomena across scales.   

231 
 
 
The formal ontology that is proposed in this thesis was first articulated in the second 
chapter, and was one of the two main components of the variational neuroethology that was 
proposed there – the other component being a heuristic for research on adaptive behaviour in 
nested multiscale systems. Two of the commentaries on our paper raised questions about how 
to draw the boundaries of Markov blanketed systems beyond the organism (Bruineberg & 
Hesp, 2018; Kirmayer, 2018). This challenge was taken up by the third chapter.  
 
The multiscale formal ontology that we propose answers many of the questions that 
need to be addressed to study multiscale systemic dynamics. First, our ontology answers 
ontological question par excellence, that of existence: What is it to exist? – And what does it 
mean to count as a thing? The supervenience formalism presupposes an account of 
individualization, whereas our account starts from one. Via our formal ontology, this question 
is reinterpreted as the requirement that a system be endowed with conditional independence 
from its embedding environment – which, under the variational approach, is operationalized 
as the requirement that a system be endowed with a Markov blanket. This provides, via a 
statistical formalism, a rigorous and unambiguous answer to a traditionally metaphysical 
question. More importantly perhaps, although it draws on the Markov blanket formalism to 
formulate this answer, any specific answer to the existence question will inevitably be based 
on the facts of experience – i.e., be based on our observations and measurements regarding 
the conditional independence of some phenomenon of interest (or lack thereof). After all, 
what determines whether a system counts as a system under this formalism is the verifiable 
(indeed, observable, measurable) fact that it is endowed with conditional independence with 
respect to its embedding environment.  
 
Under the FEP, if a system exists in a statistical sense, then it must have a Markov 
blanket – indeed, if it exists, then we can always define the appropriate blanket states. That is, 
the framework provided by variational neuroethology and variational ecology provides a 
principled answer to the question: What is it for a set of interacting things to be (to exist as) a 
system? Given this answer, one now disposes of a principled way to answering the other 
central metaphysical question: Which systems exist? So, the variational framework provides 
an ontology of systems (which is a good thing to have in the cognitive sciences – and in 
closely related sciences such as biology, anthropology, and the social sciences – since they 
are sciences of systems. Importantly, however, this is not a general metaphysics, since its 
does not allow us to answer questions about things that are not systems: time, events, art, 
numbers, etc. As a guide to research on cognitive systems, this seems more generative and 

232 
 
empirically adequate than do a priori pronouncements of the sort one might find in 
metaphysics.  
 
Second, and most importantly for the study of multiscale cognitive systems, the 
formal ontology proposed in this thesis deals explicitly with the status of higher-order 
emergent phenomena and the question of how they are related to the patterns from which 
they emerge. Again, the approach on offer here eschews metaphysics, being derived entirely 
from the (observable, measurable) statistical structure of the phenomena being studied. The 
idea on offer is reminiscent of the philosopher Daniel Dennett’s notion of ‘real patterns’ 
(Dennett, 1991). This is the idea that a given thing is real if and only if it corresponds to a real 
pattern in the world – that is, some patterned movement of matter that has real, measurable 
effects. The basic idea behind the multiscale formal ontology that is proposed in this thesis is 
simple, and continuous with this idea. It is, in a nutshell, that any component part of a 
Markov blanketed thing – insofar as it is also a thing that exists – must have a Markov 
blanket as well, by virtue of what it means to be a thing at all. This intuition fuels the 
extension of the formal ontology to cover systems of systems – and to make sense of 
dynamics all the way up and all the down the nested series of systems. Indeed, this intuition 
about scales lies at the heart of the approach proposed here. Markov blankets at a higher scale 
are statistical constructs, the states of which fluctuate more slowly (that is, at a slower 
timescale) than the internal states that they enshroud.  
 
This multiscale formal ontology effectively deals with the issues pertaining to the 
ontological status of higher-order systems, paving the way to a systematic approach to their 
study – all the while avoiding the pitfalls of an a priori approach. On this reading, emergent 
phenomena exist if and only if they can be associated with a Markov blanket at a ‘higher’ 
spatial and temporal scales (that is, over slower temporal scales and vaster spatial scales). 
This formal, statistical approach to the questions raised by ontology has the advantage of 
being based on the (observable and measurable) statistical structure of the phenomena being 
studied, rather than on a priori metaphysical categories – again, consistent with Dennett’s 
real patterns, the formalism tells us that if some higher-order pattern evinces a sufficient 
degree of conditional independence, then it counts as a system at higher spatial and temporal 
scales.   
 
As discussed in the introduction, the a priori metaphysics of emergence is not a 
fruitful approach to study multiscale systemic dynamics – for two main reasons. First, there 
exist formal means to articulate emergentist (synergetic) and reductionist (renormalization 
group theoretic) accounts of the relation between higher-order phenomena and the 

233 
 
phenomena from which they emerge. It may be that different kinds of systems call for 
different ontological assumptions – a perspective easily accommodated by our own formal 
ontological approach, but not by approaches that privilege a priori resolution of these issues. 
Second, it seems plain to me that questions about the nature of emergent phenomena should 
not be decided a priori – and especially not via conceptual analysis, which is not sufficiently 
constrained by empirical fact. That is, we are not rejecting metaphysics and ontology, but 
rather the a priori forms of these projects; and favour a naturalistic approach instead. Rather, 
these questions should be arbitrated by the empirically observable and measurable facts of the 
matter; and any formalism to which we appeal should give us a better grip on these facts, 
instead of speaking in their stead. We are, after all, trying to talk about the dynamics of 
systems that exist independently of our conceptual schemes – our concepts might guide us in 
our investigation, but in the end, nature is quite indifferent to our conceptual categories.  
 
As Pierre Poirier has emphasised in our discussions, this lends the theoretical 
framework developed in this thesis a rather ‘meta’ flavour, since it applies to itself. 
Metaphysics conducted in an a priori fashion (and indeed, perhaps also natural selection) 
have given us priors about what we think exists. A naturalistic epistemology based on 
variational neuroethology and variational ecology, however, affords something that a priori 
metaphysics does not; namely, a way of correcting these priors given evidence – that is, a 
Bayesian naturalistic metaphysics, i.e., something akin to empirical Bayes, but for 
metaphysics and ontology. 
 
From the point of view of the theory that we advocate, metaphysical a priori 
categories are something like Bayesian priors. They may represent a good-enough guess as to 
what is going on. Indeed, as hermeneutic philosophy has long argued (Gadamer, 2010/1927; 
Heidegger, 2010/1927), we only ever approach the world from the vantage point or horizon 
provided by our priors beliefs, expectations, and ways of being in the world. However, it is 
important to tune our priors to the environment – and at times, to reject them if they fail, lest 
we fall into madness (Frith & Friston, 2013). As research on delusions and schizophrenia has 
abundantly made clear, if our priors are off target, they may do more damage than good. I 
believe that the tradition of emergentist philosophy has led us a levels-based ontology, an 
ontology of distinct forms of existence (e.g., atomic existence, cellular existence, organismic 
existence, all related by logical relations) – where a process-based ontology, like the one 
proposed, would be more fruitful. Indeed, active inference is a story about the emergence and 
maintenance of Markov blankets – the ontology in play follows directly from the process of 
existing. We might speculate that much of the conceptual machinery used to study such 

234 
 
phenomena inherit from the tradition of British emergentist ontologies (Ablowitz, 1939; 
McLaughlin, 1992). These traditional views posit a hierarchy of levels, from atoms and 
molecules, to cells and organs, to organisms and social systems – each level existing as 
relatively independent. Strong emergentist views are certainly continuous with this view. 
Focusing on conditional independence and the ways that it is established and maintained 
through active inference is, I take it, a great source of prediction errors in this respect – 
which will help making our study empirically tractable and appropriately reactive to 
mistakes.  
 
Third, the approach here frays a path between weak and strong readings of 
emergence. It is close in spirit to weak (epistemological) readings of emergence because it 
remains agnostic about the metaphysics of downward causation. Indeed, on the formal 
ontology proposed here, variational free-energy is generated at each scale by the relevant 
patterns, and is integrated across scale in the selection of action policies. We thus have an 
account of how emergent phenomena can be causally efficacious – in effect, their role is to 
establish probability gradients on the trajectories of the constituent parts. Importantly, this 
does not commit us to a view on the metaphysics of inter-level causation; not least because 
we are replacing the metaphysics of levels of being with an approach to phenomena that are 
integrated systems of systems spanning several spatial and temporal scales. In summary, if 
successful, the formal ontology proposed by this thesis effectively supersedes metaphysical 
approaches to multiscale dynamics.   
 
9.3. The limits of the variational approach to the cognitive sciences 
Since the variational approach appears so all encompassing – or very nearly so – it may be 
worthwhile to discuss briefly its explanatory scope and to point out a few of its limits. First of 
all, as is emphasised throughout the thesis, the free-energy principle is not a theory of 
everything. Rather, it is a theory of biological and cognitive self-organisation via adaptive 
action. More technically, it is a fully general account of the constraints that must be met by 
any system that exists at nonequilibrium steady state. That is, it describes the most general 
conditions that must be fulfilled by any system with a set of attracting states, or a phenotype.  
 
The explanatory scope of the FEP is clearly very wide, but this breadth is purchased at 
the cost of saying, in effect, very little about the specifics of the biological systems so 
described or explained. This is not a defect of the principle – at least, arguably not. Indeed, as 
we argue in the last three chapters of this thesis, such minimalism positions the free-energy 
principle to act not as a finished theory of everything, but instead to provide a general 

235 
 
theoretical and mathematical framework to enable and guide multidisciplinary research on 
the behaviour of adaptive systems – especially in the multiscale formulations thereof. As 
Axel Constant has argued in discussions, the specificity of FEP-based explanations of given 
phenotypes rests on the specificity of the generative models that describe those phenotypes – 
that is, the set of beliefs about the typical causes of sensory states that make a creature ‘the 
kind of creature that it is’ (Friston & Buzsáki, 2016; Friston, Redish, & Gordon, 2017; Parr & 
Friston, 2018). One might say, then, that the species-specific character of a given FEP-based 
explanation can this coexist happily with the generality of the FEP as an explanatory 
principle.  
 
The second and third chapters of this thesis makes this very clear, in principle and in 
practice. In principle, the variational neuroethology and variational ecology that were 
developed there essentially and irreducibly draw upon established frameworks in biology, 
namely evolutionary systems theory and Tinbergen’s four questions (mechanism, ontogeny, 
phylogeny, and function) to propose a general account of the adaptive behaviour of 
multiscale systems and their control systems. Here, the FEP augments and complements 
existing bodies of theory, allowing for theoretical integration. In practice, we also derived a 
specific theory of the embodied, situated human brain from the more meta-theoretical work 
of variational neuroethology and variational ecology, namely, the hierarchically mechanistic 
mind – which we have continued to develop since (Badcock, Friston, & Ramstead, 2019). 
This theory appeals to theories that specifically address the human brain in its idiosyncrasy; it 
appeals to human neuroscience as well as other disciplines like human cognitive psychology 
and cognitive-evolutionary anthropology.  
 
To talk about a given species meaningfully and scientifically, it is necessary to look 
into the specific historical trajectories of the systems we are studying. This is why we 
appealed to specific, substantial explanations in the second chapter in constructing our 
approach to neuroethology. In the end, historicity may be the defining limitation of 
approaches to cognitive systems based on the FEP. The FEP is formulated in terms of 
conservative dynamics. That is, it captures the dynamical constraints that must necessarily be 
in play in systems that are endowed with a phenotype. The FEP tells us what must be true a 
system with a phenotype for it to remain in (that is, to periodically return to) the states that 
make it ‘the kind of creature that it is’. It is far from clear that historical drift and change can 
be accounted for. 
 
These are not ultimate limitations of the FEP, they have more to do with the 
mathematical assumptions that are in play in the current versions of the construction. One 

236 
 
such assumptions is worth mentioning here: The FEP holds for systems that are locally 
ergodic – which means, very crudely, that the average of our measures of that system 
coincide, over a long enough time, with a measure of the average state of such a system. 
While this is a plausible assumption for most biological systems, it may not be adequate for 
systems the dynamics of which are extremely transient; i.e., it may be a fair assumption to 
model societies in times of stability (e.g., feudal France, circa 1500) but not in times of great 
change (e.g., the French revolution and ensuing terror).  
 
Intriguingly, the FEP is deeply related to (indeed, can be derived from) what may be a 
theory of every ‘thing’ – in the sense of being a theory that can be applied to anything that is a 
thing at all, i.e., a physics of anything that is endowed with robust conditional independence 
from its embedding environment. The Markov blanket formalism, it has recently been shown, 
can be extended to cover all sorts of phenomena, ranging quantum to classical mechanics and 
thermodynamics (Friston, in preparation). Although the details of this ambitious proposal are 
far beyond the scope of this thesis, the existence of such a project does makes the FEP a 
special case of a more general theory of every ‘thing’ – as applied to systems the dynamics of 
which are dependent on their internal and active states.  
 
9.4. The cultural affordances framework: Affording blind spots 
 
The cultural affordances framework contributes to our understanding of multiscale 
dynamics by formulating a mechanism of the enculturation of human agents that involves 
factors pitched at different descriptive levels. We followed the lead of cognition, 
communication, and culture researcher Andreas Roepstorff, who suggested that the correct 
unit of analysis for studying cultural phenomena was that of patterned cultural practices 
(Roepstorff, Niewöhner, & Beck, 2010). Patterned cultural practices were suggested as the 
ideal unit of analysis for studying the interaction between cognitive and cultural phenomena 
because is they represent a ‘middle-range’ level of analysis – ideally pitched in between the 
(overly coarse) macro-level of cultural groups and the (overly narrow) micro-level of 
encultured brain activity in individuals.  
 
The first chapter identified one specific kind of patterned cultural practice that was 
central to enculturation – those practices that modulate the attention of human agents, which 
we call regimes of attention. The concept of regimes of attention is the central theoretical and 
mechanistic contribution of the first chapter, which ties together the various bodies of 
literature mobilized in the chapter. Indeed, the concept was used in the initial stages on my 
research as a case study on multiscale theorizing and modelling.  

237 
 
 
At the time of writing the first chapter, I had not yet become privy the integrative 
potential of the FEP to provide a general framework to explain multiscale integration. The 
construct of regimes of attention, when framed in terms of active inference, provide a natural 
and potent mechanism for the enculturation of human agents. The crucial outcome of this 
model, which makes it my first attempt to engage in multiscale theoretical pursuits, is that it 
combines factors operative at different spatial and temporal scales. According to the cultural 
affordances framework, regimes of attention organise and recruit practices and material 
artefacts at one scale – i.e., the scale of the embedding social and cultural environment. The 
effects of regimes of attention is to pattern the enculturation (that is, the culture-guided 
development) of human agents at another scale (at the scale of ontogeny), such that 
immersive participation in regimes of attention ends up installing in the learner (roughly) the 
same expectations that guided the practices in which they were immersed to begin with. This 
process itself is the result of accumulated interactions with the environment, which unfold 
over real-time or mechanistic timescales. Thus, true to its original aim, the cultural 
affordances framework provides a model of human sociocultural action and cognition that 
integrates factors from all these different scales.  
 
The centrality of regimes of attention came to the fore through my collaboration with 
Samuel Veissière. The significance of these kinds of cultural practices was made especially 
salient since I was also working on active inference models of attention while writing this 
chapter. Under active inference, the construct of attention has mostly been cast as equivalent 
to the process of precision weighting – that is, the modulation of the gain or ‘volume’ of 
neural signals as a function of their estimated reliability or precision (Feldman & Friston, 
2010). This process of precision weighting, in turn, is the main factor that determines what is 
retained by the system, since it effectively regulates belief updating in the brain. This 
feedback loop, when placed in cultural context, seemed like an ideal mechanism to explain 
enculturation. In other words, attention as precision weighting determines what content is 
processed – and that, in turn, determines what signals are processes and thereby learned by 
the agent.  
 
The resulting framework was a good point of departure, but proved insufficient on its 
own. For the purposes of my doctoral research, the most significant limitation of the cultural 
affordances framework lies in its treatment of multiscale integration; namely, the framework 
lacked a model of explanation able to account for how the various causal factors to which we 
appealed at different levels of description are related and interact. On its own, the cultural 
affordances framework begs the question of how multiscale dynamics are realised and leaves 

238 
 
unanswered the question of how phenomena occurring at different levels of description are 
integrated into coherent patterns of adaptive behaviour. The following years of my doctoral 
work (from 2016 to 2019) were thus devoted to the development of a meta-theory that could 
justify the results of the first chapter. The integrative work of the subsequent chapters is 
premised on this search, and resulted in an attempt to systematically extend the FEP from a 
unified theory of the function, structure, and dynamics of the brain to a theory of the 
adaptive, ecologically situated behaviour of nested cognitive systems.  
 
Another limitation of the cultural affordances framework, which was not apparent at 
the time of writing the paper but has become increasingly central to my more recent work, is 
that it does not capture one of the two intuitive or folk psychological meanings of the word 
‘attention’. Attention can refer to the metaphorical turning of the mind’s eye to information 
that has already been received, and engaging with the information (via cognitive processing) 
as a function of their estimated relevance. As discussed, under the FEP, this is cast as the 
mechanism of precision weighting. But attention can also refer to ‘eye-grabbing’ nature of a 
phenomenon, as when we hear a loud sound and direct our gaze to its perceived source. This 
aspect of attention did not receive explicit treatment in the cultural affordances framework, 
but would play a critical role in the work that followed shortly thereafter. Beyond the 
phenomenological differences between the two kinds of attention, there is an intuitively 
obvious difference between choosing where to direct visual saccade to disambiguate a visual 
scene, on the one hand, and determining what to do with that information once it has been 
received.  
 
This difference between these two forms of attention has been explored in the recent 
literature on active inference – as the difference between the process of precision weighting 
and the epistemic affordance or salience of an action policy (Parr & Friston, 2017). This 
latter quantity is involved in the selection of action policies, and quantifies the amount of 
uncertainty that is resolved by performing that action – as opposed to the utility that accrues 
to the performance of that action. Recent work on ecological interpretations of active 
inference cast epistemic affordance as the quantity that is optimised in the process of niche 
construction (Bruineberg, Rietveld, Parr, van Maanen, & Friston, 2018; Constant et al., 
2018). On this reading, organisms are able to act on the basis of the shared value of an action 
policy by leveraging the traces left by the adaptive actions of conspecifics. The variational 
approach to niche construction that results from this perspective was one of the central 
components in the theoretical integration accomplished by the variational ecology that is 
proposed in the third chapter of this thesis. We have conducted follow-up work that further 

239 
 
develops this perspective as well (Constant, Ramstead, Veissière, & Friston, 2019; Veissière, 
Constant, Ramstead, Friston, & Kirmayer, Accepted).  
 
9.5. Phenomenology: Reckoning with consciousness  
 
The truth (if I’m being honest) is that the secret – and indeed, abandoned – target of 
this thesis was phenomenology (the study of consciousness and conscious experience) and 
hermeneutic philosophy (the study of the experience, process, and methods of interpretation). 
 
One of the greatest lacunae of this doctoral thesis – and to me, its greatest failure – is 
the lack of a clear engagement with phenomenological philosophy, existentialism, and 
hermeneutics. The significance of this failure is so great in my view in no small part because 
the original intentions that motivated this doctoral work were deeply connected to 
phenomenological philosophy. My original hope in developing a multiscale approach to 
cognitive systems was to rehabilitate the descriptive level that corresponds to lived 
phenomenological experience.  
 
I was originally inspired by the project for a cultural neuro-phenomenology that was 
put forward by my mentor at McGill University, Laurence Kirmayer. I had initially thought 
of my project as prolonging the work on the naturalization of phenomenology that I had 
conducted over the course of my Master’s degree at Université du Québec à Montréal under 
the supervision of Pierre Poirier. Over the course of my Master’s research, I had examined 
various forms of phenomenological philosophy and became deeply dissatisfied with classical, 
Husserlian styles of phenomenology. Husserlian theory was disappointing to me, and became 
impossible to work with, mainly because, despite the insistence of some to the contrary 
(Zahavi, 2003), Husserl’s mature philosophy is a form of transcendental idealism – perhaps 
even a kind of transcendental absolutism, which reduced everything to the workings of 
transcendental subjectivity.  
 
Coming from cognitive science, I was more influenced by the guiding idea of 
philosopher Paul Ricoeur – that against the phenomenological impetus to reduce everything 
to consciousness, we should instead pursue an alternative, hermeneutic aim: the reduction of 
consciousness; i.e., the situation of consciousness within the deep history of processes – 
causal and historical – that produced it. The resources of Heideggerian and Merleau-Pontian 
phenomenology were richer for my purposes. Heidegger’s insistence on immediate 
engagement with the environment (Heidegger, 2010/1927) resonated deeply with the enactive 
approach that is employed throughout this thesis. The emphasis placed by Merleau-Ponty on 
embodied engagement with the world, and the emergence of meaning in embodied 

240 
 
engagement (Merleau-Ponty, 2013/1945), was perhaps the central guiding philosophical 
intuition of this thesis.  
 
The work of Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty had already been leveraged to great effect 
in the cognitive sciences when I began my doctoral studies (Kiverstein & Wheeler, 2012; 
Thompson, 2010; Varela et al., 1991). The affordances construct – as revised by philosophers 
and cognitive scientists Tony Chemero, Jelle Bruineberg, Erik Rietveld, and Julian Kiverstein 
(Bruineberg et al., 2016; Bruineberg & Rietveld, 2014; Bruineberg et al., 2018; Chemero, 
2003, 2009; Rietveld & Kiverstein, 2014) – was a central influence on my doctoral research. I 
followed their lead, using the resources of ecological psychology in an attempt to bring 
phenomenology into play, but in a way that was tractable to empirical inquiry (something that 
can hardly be said about Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty themselves).  
 
Previous work by the aforementioned philosophers had provided a proof of concept 
that the affordances construct could effectively translate much of the Heideggerian insights 
about readiness-to-hand (Zuhandenheit) – that is, the mode of immediate engagement with 
things around us – within a framework that is empirically tractable and is able to guide 
inquiry in the cognitive sciences. From there, it made a great deal of sense to see whether it 
was possible to articulate a culturally richer account of affordances, informed by recent 
cognitive anthropology. This led to the development of the cultural affordances construct – 
based in no small part on notes and seminars by Samuel Veissière, who was working on a 
similar set of issues, but coming at things from anthropology, and drawing on thinkers such 
as Tim Ingold (e.g., Ingold, 2001) and aspects of Francisco Varela’s work with which I had 
not previously engaged (Varela, 1999).  
 
To my deep chagrin and discontent, the place of consciousness remains mysterious 
and unclear in the theoretical edifice that has resulted from my doctoral work. The multiscale 
framework sketched here, with its consideration of affordances, at least dialogues with 
phenomenology – minimally, to be sure. However, this is also where it fails: besides its being 
inspired, albeit very loosely, by phenomenological philosophy, there is no explicit 
engagement of conscious, first-person experience to be found in this work.  
 
The meaning of the title of this thesis changed as I wrote my thesis. I originally 
wanted to say something about the mind, in the sense that occurs most in philosophy – i.e., 
the what-it-is-like or first-person, ‘for-me’ character of conscious experience. It was my 
contention that we had effectively lost sight of the phenomenological aspect of the mind in 
the cognitive sciences. Ironically, I also lost sight of consciousness as I developed the 
material in this thesis. The new meaning of title refers to the new question that became 

241 
 
central to the thesis: Where are we to draw the relevant boundaries of cognitive systems. In a 
sense, my thesis was transformed, from one question (Have we lost our minds?) to another 
(Have we lost our minds?).  
 
My PhD supervisor Laurence Kirmayer has on numerous occasions pressed me to 
clarify the relation between the technical use of ‘surprise’ in the variational formalism with 
the folk psychological or phenomenological use of the term ‘surprise’, e.g., as referring to the 
subjective experience of being surprised. Surprise in information theory is a measure of the 
improbability of some state or outcome. In its folk psychological usage, ‘surprise’ emerges 
out of a wider and deeper set of informational processes with a particular (cultural) history, 
and implies an extensive social and temporal embedding related to consciousness, felt 
phenomenal qualities, and cultural meaning. For instance, psychologically, surprise occurs 
when some event happens that contradicts the psychological expectations had by an agent. To 
my disappointment (and doubtless, to my supervisor’s as well), I have not been able to clarify 
the relation between the two uses of the term. Now, there must be some link between the two 
constructs. After all, at least heuristically, whenever some turn of events is psychologically 
surprising, this must be because there is some departure from expectations – and hence, some 
surprise. However, this seems like a sleight of hand and is not informative. After all, the 
quantity surprise is tracked by all cognitive processes, since variational free-energy is an 
upper bound on surprise, and all cognitive processes track (and avoid) variational free-
energy. There is, then, a sense in which surprise is involved even when expectations are met 
at the psychological level. The two notions thus do not converge, and it is beyond my ability 
at this stage to determine how the two connect to one another.  
 
My MA supervisor Pierre Poirier has suggested in discussions – more controversially, 
to be sure – that the frameworks that have been described in this thesis may serve to advance 
the agenda of eliminative materialism (Churchland, 1981). In a nutshell, eliminative 
materialism is the claim that our folk psychological concepts (such as the distinction between 
the mind and the body) are theories – and that like any theory, they are subject to revision. On 
this view, it also happens that folk psychology is a bad theory, which do not reflect the way 
that nature is. On this view, concepts such as ‘mind’ are akin to the ancient concept of 
‘elemental fire’: they cover disparate phenomena bearing little relation to each other – the 
way ‘fire’ covered phenomena as unrelated as nuclear fusion (in the sun), bioluminescence 
(in insects and sea creatures), and rapid oxidation (in combustion).  
 
The suggestion, then, is that the cultural affordances framework – when further 
developed to address a broader range of interactions between human agents and their 

242 
 
ecological niche – holds the promise of a wholesale replacement of folk psychological 
concepts (and indeed, perhaps also of many of the natural kind concepts from the ontologies 
of psychological and neuroscientific sciences, which inherit from folk psychology). This 
conceptual edifice provided by the cultural affordances framework arguably improves on folk 
psychology, in that the concepts in play always carve nature in a relational manner (in terms 
of organism-environment relations).  
 
I find this suggestion intriguing – and, in some ways, comforting. The implication of 
this view, after all, is that the failings just discussed are not due to my own limitations – but 
instead follow from the fact that there is no such thing as consciousness as phenomenological 
philosophy understands it. Instead, there is something a diversity of experiences, each with 
their own phenomenology (in attention, in expectation, in narrative, in subjectivity, in 
feelings of agency, of mineness, of knowing, of existence, etc.). Perhaps some of these can be 
dealt with individually within the framework proposed in this thesis. 
 
In the end, I hope my work in this thesis will lead others, who have more time and 
energy than I, to pursue this dialogue with the sciences that study first-person experience. I 
can only sketch general directions for future research here. My feeling is that there is much to 
accomplish within the broad, recently proposed project of a neural hermeneutics (Friston & 
Frith, 2015a; Friston & Frith, 2015b; Gallagher & Allen, 2016). This project is a revamped 
version of the attempt to bring phenomenology into contact with the natural sciences – what 
has been called ‘neuro-phenomenology’ (Gallagher, 2012; Ramstead, 2015; Zahavi, 2013). 
My only reservation with the neural hermeneutics project, which may not come as a surprise 
given the content of this doctoral thesis, is its overemphasis on neural dynamics. A more 
natural project, from the point of view articulated here, would be the project of multiscale 
hermeneutics, based on a multiscale reading of the FEP.

10. Final conclusion and summary 
The aim of this doctoral thesis was to examine the question: How best to address the study of 
systemic dynamics that span several spatial and temporal scales in the cognitive sciences, 
from cells to societies? The thesis aims to prevent us from ‘losing our minds’, that is, losing 
sight of the full phenomenon of cognition by focusing unduly on phenomena at specific 
scales and levels of description to the detriment of others.   
 
This thesis articulated a first principle approach to multidisciplinary research in the 
cognitive sciences. This synthesis is based on multiscale extensions of the variational free-
energy principle, a framework from theoretical biology that provides an account of the 
general information-theoretic constraints that must be met by all cognizing organisms – and 
indeed, by any system with a phenotype. This provides the cognitive sciences with models of 
the dynamics of cognitive systems at, and across, all the scales at which they exist.  
 
More specifically, leveraging work in philosophy and theoretical work in the 
cognitive sciences, this thesis proposed three new theoretical frameworks designed to address 
the dynamics of cognitive systems at and across scales: (1) the cultural affordances 
framework, an integrative theoretical model of how human action, cognition, learning, and 
culture, formulated in terms of possibilities for action in the environment (affordances) and 
the patterned cultural practices that direct the attention of human agents, leading to their 
enculturation (regimes of attention); (2) variational neuroethology, a new approach to the 
study of the mechanics and evolution of adaptive behaviour and behavioural control systems 
(such as brains), which foregrounds the construct of recursively nested cognitive systems (of 
systems); and finally, (3) variational ecology, a novel perspective on the project of cognitive 
ecology that emphasises the way such nested cognitive systems interact with the ecological 
niche in which they are embedded and with which they interact.  
 
Finally, leveraging these new frameworks, the thesis developed a philosophical 
argument against what we labelled ‘essentialism about the boundaries of cognitive systems’, 
a debate which still rages in the philosophy of the cognitive sciences. Essentialist approaches 
are those that privilege one type of boundary over others, and which argue that the boundaries 
of cognitive systems are essentially of a specific kind. The thesis argued that the boundaries 
of cognitive systems are not fixed once and for all, and identical for all inquiries, but instead, 
that they are multiple, nested, and interest-relative. With this thesis, I hope to have helped to 
resolve the artificial and false dichotomy between internalism and externalism in the 
philosophy of the cognitive sciences. Having done so, the author hopes that the thesis will 
prevent us from losing our minds – wherever they happen to be.
