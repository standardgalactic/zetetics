Preface to Volume II
My motivation in writing this second volume was to have a rather introductory
book on quantum gravity,1 supersymmetry,2 and string theory3 for a reader who
has had some training in conventional quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) dealing with
its foundations, with abelian and non-abelian gauge theories including grand
uniﬁcation, and with the basics of renormalization theory as already covered in
Vol. I Quantum Field Theory I: Foundations and Abelian and Non-Abelian Gauge
Theories. This volume is partly based on lectures given to graduate students in
theoretical and experimental physics, at an introductory level, emphasizing those
parts which are reasonably well understood and for which satisfactory theoretical
descriptions have been given.
Quantum gravity is a vast subject,4 and I obviously have to make a choice in this
introductory treatment of the subject. As an introduction, I restrict the study to two
different approaches to quantum gravity: the perturbative quantum general relativity
approach as the main focus and a non-perturbative background-independent one
referred to as “loop quantum gravity” (LQG), where space emerges from the theory
itself and is quantized. In LQG we encounter a QFT in a three-dimensional space.

Preface to Volume II
Some unique features of the treatment given are:
•
No previous knowledge of general relativity is required, and the necessary
geometrical aspects needed are derived afresh.
•
The derivation of ﬁeld equations and of the expression for the propagator of
the graviton in the linearized theory is solved with a gauge constraint, and a
constraint necessarily implies that not all the components of the gravitational
ﬁeld may be varied independently—a point which is most often neglected in the
literature.
•
An elementary treatment is given of the so-called Schwinger-DeWitt technique.
•
Non-renormalizability aspects of quantum general relativity are discussed as well
as of the renormalizability of some higher-order derivative gravitational theories.
•
A proof is given of the Euler-Poincaré Characteristic Theorem which is most
often omitted in textbooks.
•
A uniqueness property of the invariant product of three Riemann tensors is
proved which is also most often omitted in textbooks.
•
An introductory treatment is provided of “loop quantum gravity” with sufﬁcient
details to get the main ideas across and prepare the reader for more advanced
studies.
Supersymmetry is admittedly a theory with mathematical beauty. It unites
particles of integer and half-integer spins, i.e., with different spins, but with equal
masses in symmetry multiplets. Some important aspects in the treatment of the
subject are the following:
•
A fundamental property of supersymmetric theories is that the supersym-
metry charge (supercharge) operator responsible for interchanging bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom obviously does not commute with angular
momentum (spin) due to different spins arising in a given supermultiplet.
This commutation relation is explicitly derived which is most often omitted in
textbooks.
•
The concept of superspace is introduced, as a direct generalization of the
Minkowski one, and the basic theory of integration and differentiation in
superspace is developed.
•
A derivation is given of the so-called Super-Poincaré algebra satisﬁed by the
generators of supersymmetry and spacetime transformations, which involves
commutators and anti-commutators5 and generalizes the Poincaré algebra of
spacetime transformations derived in Vol. I.
•
The subject of supersymmetric invariance of integration theory in superspace is
developed as it is a key ingredient in deﬁning supersymmetric actions and in
constructing supersymmetric extensions of various ﬁeld theories.
•
A panorama of superﬁelds is given including that of the pure vector superﬁeld,
and complete derivations are provided.
5Such an algebra is referred to as a graded algebra.

Preface to Volume II

•
Once the theory of supersymmetric invariant integration is developed, and
superﬁelds are introduced, supersymmetric extensions of basic ﬁeld theories are
constructed, such as that of Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics; a spin 0–spin
1/2 ﬁeld theory, referred to as the Wess-Zumino supersymmetric theory with
interactions; the Yang-Mill ﬁeld theory; and the standard model.
•
There are several advantages of a supersymmetric version of a theory over
its non-supersymmetric one. For one thing, the ultraviolet divergence problem
is much improved in the former in the sense that divergences originating
from fermions loops tend, generally, to cancel those divergent contributions
originating from bosons due to their different statistics. The couplings in the
supersymmetric version of the standard model merge together more precisely
at a high energy. Moreover, this occurs at a higher energy than in the non-
supersymmetric theory, getting closer to the Planck one at which gravity is
expected to be signiﬁcant. This gives the hope of unifying gravity with the rest
of interactions in a quantum setting.
•
Spontaneous symmetry breaking is discussed to account for the mass differences
observed in nature of particles of bosonic and fermionic types.
•
The underlying geometry necessary for incorporating spinors in general relativity
is developed to ﬁnally and explicitly derive the expression of the action of the full
supergravity theory.
In string theory, one encounters a QFT on two-dimensional surfaces traced by
strings in spacetime, referred to as their worldsheets, with remarkable consequences
in spacetime itself, albeit in higher dimensions. If conventional ﬁeld theories are
low-energy effective theories of string theory, then this alone justiﬁes introducing
this subject to the student. Some important aspects of the treatment of the subject
are the following:
•
In string theory, particles that are needed in elementary particle physics arise
naturally in the mass spectra of oscillating strings and are not, a priori, assumed
to exist or put in by hand in the underlying theory. One of such particles emerging
from closed strings is the evasive graviton.
•
With the strings being of ﬁnite extensions, string theory may, perhaps, provide a
better approach than conventional ﬁeld theory since the latter involves products
of distributions at the same spacetime points which are generally ill deﬁned.
•
Details are given of all the massless ﬁelds in bosonic and superstring theories,
including the determination of their inherited degrees of freedom.
•
The derived degrees of freedom associated with a massless ﬁeld in D-
dimensional spacetime, together with the eigenvalue equation associated with
the mass squared operator associated with such a given massless ﬁeld, are
consistently used to determine the underlying spacetime dimensions D of the
bosonic and superstring theories.
•
Elements of space compactiﬁcations are introduced.
•
The basics of the underlying theory of vertices, interactions, and scattering of
strings are developed.
•
Einstein’s theory of gravitation is readily obtained from string theory.
•
The Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory is readily obtained from string theory.

Preface to Volume II
This volume is organized as follows. In Chap. 1, the reader is introduced to quan-
tum gravity, where no previous knowledge of general relativity (GR) is required.
All the necessary geometrical aspects are derived afresh leading to explicit general
Lagrangians for gravity, including that of GR. The quantum aspect of gravitation, as
described by the graviton, is introduced, and perturbative quantum GR is discussed.
The so-called Schwinger-DeWitt formalism is developed to compute the one-
loop contribution to the theory, and renormalizability aspects of the perturbative
theory are also discussed. This follows by introducing the very basics of a non-
perturbative, background-independent formulation of quantum gravity, referred to
as “loop quantum gravity” which gives rise to a quantization of space and should
be interesting to the reader. In Chap.2, we introduce the reader to supersymmetry
and its consequences. In particular, quite a detailed representation is given for the
generation of superﬁelds, and the underlying section should provide a useful source
of information on superﬁelds. Supersymmetric extensions of Maxwell’s theory, as
well as of Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory, and of the standard model are worked out,
as mentioned earlier. Spontaneous symmetry breaking, and improvement of the
divergence problem in supersymmetric ﬁeld theory are also covered. The uniﬁcation
of the fundamental couplings in a supersymmetric version of the standard model6
is then studied. Geometrical aspects necessary to study supergravity are established
culminating in the derivation of the full action of the theory. In the ﬁnal chapter,
the reader is introduced to string theory, involving both bosonic and superstrings,
and to the analysis of the spectra of the mass (squared) operator associated with the
oscillating strings. The properties of the underlying ﬁelds, associated with massless
particles, encountered in string theory are studied in some detail. Elements of
compactiﬁcation, duality, and D-branes are given, as well as of the generation of
vertices and interactions of strings. In the ﬁnal sections on string theory, we will see
how one may recover general relativity and the Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory from string
theory. We have also included two appendices at the end of this volume containing
useful information relevant to the rest of this volume and should be consulted by
the reader. The problems given at the end of the chapters form an integral part of
the books, and many developments in the text depend on the problems and may
include, in turn, additional material. They should be attempted by every serious
student. Solutions to all the problems are given right at the end of the book for
the convenience of the reader. We make it a point pedagogically to derive things in
detail, and some of such details are sometimes relegated to appendices at the end of
the respective chapters, or worked out in the problems, with the main results given
in the chapters in question. The very detailed introduction to QFT since its birth in
1926 in Vol. I,7 as well as the introductions to the chapters, provide the motivations

underlying symmetry represented by the group products SU.2/  U.1/  SU.3/.

and the pedagogical means to handle the technicalities that follow them in these
studies.
This volume is suitable as a textbook. Its content may be covered in a 1 year
(two semesters) course. Short introductory seminar courses may be also given on
quantum gravity, supersymmetry, and string theory.
I often meet students who have a background in conventional quantum ﬁeld
theory mentioned earlier and want to learn about quantum gravity, supersymmetry
and string theory but have difﬁculty in reading more advanced books on these
subjects. I thus felt a pedagogical book is needed which puts these topics together
and develops them in a coherent introductory and uniﬁed manner with a consistent
notation which should be useful for the student who wants to learn the underlying
different approaches in a more efﬁcient way. He or she may then consult more
advanced specialized books, also mentioned earlier, for additional details and further
developments, hopefully, with not much difﬁculty.
I ﬁrmly believe that different approaches taken in describing fundamental physics
at very high energies or at very small distances should be encouraged and considered
as future experiments may conﬁrm directly, or even indirectly, their relevance to the
real world.
I hope this book will be useful for a wide range of readers. In particular, I
hope that physics graduate students, not only in quantum ﬁeld theory and high-
energy physics but also in other areas of specializations, will also beneﬁt from it
as, according to my experience, they seem to have been left out of this fundamental
area of physics, as well as instructors and researchers in theoretical physics.

Chapter 1
Introduction to Quantum Gravity
All particles, whether massive or massless, experience the gravitational interaction
due to their energy content.1 Although the gravitational coupling is much smaller
than other couplings such as the electromagnetic coupling, the Fermi coupling,
the QCD couplings, and so on, the incorporation of gravity in quantum ﬁeld
theory interactions seems important. For one thing, we have seen that in grand
uniﬁed theories2 that the effective couplings of various theories merge at high
energies at which gravitation may play an equally important role as the other
interactions. This will also lead to the ultimate goal of developing a uniﬁed theory
for all the fundamental interactions, from which the various interactions become
distinguishable at limiting low energy limits of such a uniﬁed theory. Uniﬁcation of
the interactions in Nature is a major theme in fundamental physics. Even Einstein
tried to unify gravity and electrodynamics many years ago. It is expected that
gravitation would play, in general, a fundamental role in the ultraviolet divergence
problem in quantum ﬁeld theory when considering theories at small distances.
A quantum gravity (QG) theory as such is needed in early cosmology for the
description of the origin of the universe, as well as in black hole physics. It also
has to deal, in general, with singularities that may arise in a classical treatment,
and problems at small distances, or equivalently at high energies. In particular, it
is of interest to provide a uniﬁed description of Nature which is applicable from
microscopic to cosmological distances. Fundamental constants for a unit of length
and a unit of mass expected to be relevant to this end are, respectively, the Planck
length and the Planck mass. Out of the fundamental constants of quantum physics
„, of relativity c, and the Newtonian gravitational one GN, these units of length and

Since gravitation has a universal coupling to all forms of energy, one may hope
that it may be implemented within a uniﬁed theory of the four fundamental
interactions, as mentioned earlier, with the Planck mass providing a universal mass
scale. Unfortunately it is difﬁcult in practice to investigate quantum properties
of gravitation as one has to work at such high energies that are not accessible
experimentally.
A key observation of Einstein, referred to as the principle of equivalence, in
developing his general theory of gravitation, is that at any given point in space and
any given time, one may consider a frame in which gravity locally, at the point in
question, is wiped out. For example, in simple Newtonian gravitational physics, a
test particle placed at a given point inside a freely falling elevator on its way to the
Earth, remains at rest, relative to the elevator, for a very short time, depending on
the accuracy being sought, and, depending on its position relative to the center of
the Earth. The particle eventually moves, in general, from its original position in
a given instant.3 Einstein’s principle of equivalence applies only locally at a given
point of space and at a given time. At the point in question, in the particular frame in
consideration, gravity is wiped out and special relativity survives. The reconciliation
between special relativity and Newton’s theory of gravitation, then readily leads to
Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity (GR), where gravity is accounted for by the
curvature of spacetime and its departure from the ﬂat spacetime of special relativity
one has started out with, through the application of the principle of equivalence. As
a consequence of this, a geometrical description arises to account for the role of
gravity. By doing this, one is able to enmesh non-gravitational laws with gravity via
this principle.
GR predicts the existence of Black Holes.4 Recall that a black hole (BH) is a
region of space into which matter has collapsed and out of which light may not
escape. It partitions space into an inner region which is bounded by a surface,
referred to as the event horizon which acts as a one way surface for light going
in but not coming out. The sun’s radius is much larger than the critical radius of
a BH which is about 2.5 km to be a black hole. We will see in Appendix E of this
chapter by examining a spherically symmetric BH of mass M that this critical radius

One may argue that the Planck length may set a lower limit spatial cut-off. The
following formal and rough estimates are interesting. Suppose that by means of a
high energetic particle of energy E, hE2i

interested in measuring a ﬁeld within an interval of size ı around a given point in
space. Such form of energy acts as an effective gravitational mass M 

which, in turn, distorts space around it. The radius of the event horizon of such a
gravitational mass M is given by rBH D 2GNM=c2. Clearly we must have ı > rBH,
otherwise the region of size ı that we wanted to locate the point in question will be
hidden beyond a BH horizon, and localization fails. Also hp2i

referred to as the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy formula8 of a BH, where A is the
surface area of the BH horizon, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. This result is
expected to hold in any consistent formulation of quantum gravity, and shows that a
BH has entropy unlike what would be naïvely expect from a BH with the horizon as a
one way classical surface through which information is lost to an external observer.
The proportionality of the entropy to the area rather than to the volume of a BH
horizon should be noted. It also encompasses Hawking’s theorem of increase of the
area with time with increase of entropy.
From the geometrical description of gravitation given earlier, one may introduce
a gravitational ﬁeld to account for the departure of the curved spacetime metric from
that of the Minkowski one, and make contact with the approaches of conventional
ﬁeld theories, dealing now with a ﬁeld permeating an interaction between all
dynamical ﬁelds. The quantum particle associated with the gravitational ﬁeld, the
so-called graviton, emerges by considering the small ﬂuctuation of the metric,
associated with curved spacetime of GR about the Minkowski one, as the limit of the
full metric, where the gravitational ﬁeld becomes weaker and the particle becomes
5Hawking [31, 32].
6Particle emission from a BH is formally explained through virtual pairs of particles created near
the horizon with one particle falling into the BH while the other becoming free outside the horizon.

in it.

identiﬁed. This allows us to determine the graviton propagator in the same way
one obtains, for example, the photon propagator in QED, and eventually carry out
a perturbation theory as a ﬁrst attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravitation,
starting from the Lagrangian density of the action of GR, referred to as the Einstein-
Hilbert action.
In units of „ D 1; c D 1, Newtons gravitational constant GN, in 4 dimensional
spacetime, has the dimensionality Œ GN  D Œ mass 2, which is a dead give away of
the non-renormalizability of a quantum theory of gravitation based on GR. The non-
renormalizability of the theory is easier to understand by noting that the degree of
divergence of a graph, in general, in the theory turns out to increase with the number
of loops of integrations without a bound, implying the need of an inﬁnite number
of parameters are needed to be ﬁxed experimentally,9 indicating that perturbative
quantum general relativity is not of practical value, in general. Also correspondingly,
new interactions Lagrangians need to be added10 to the theory indicating that the
theory is far from being complete. Here we may pose to recall that in QED, for
example, only two parameters may be ﬁxed experimentally, the charge and the mass
of the electron. Also the additional terms to be added to the original lagrangian
density in doing so, have the same structure as the original terms in the original
Dirac-Maxwell Lagrangian density.
The Lagrangian density of the action of GR involves two derivatives. Some
higher order derivatives theories turn out to be renormalizable11 but violate, in a
perturbative setting, the very sacred principle of positivity condition of quantum
theory. Unfortunately, such a theory involves ghosts in a perturbative treatment, due
to the rapid damping of the propagator at high energies faster than 1=k2, and gives
rise, in turn, to negative probabilities.12
It is generally believed that one is trying to use general relativity beyond its limit
of validity, at energy scales where a more fundamental quantum gravity will be
involved. In this sense, general relativity is expected to emerge as a low energy limit
of a more fundamental theory, as the former has been quite successful in the low
energy classical regime. As a matter of fact the derivatives occurring in the action,
in a momentum description via Fourier transforms, may be considered to be small
at sufﬁciently low energies. In view of applications in the low energy regime, one
then tries to separate low energy effects from high energy ones even if the theory
has unfavorable ultraviolet behavior such as in quantum gravity.13 Applications
of such an approach have been carried out in the literature as just cited, and, for
example, the modiﬁcation of Newton’s gravitational potential at long distances has
9Manoukian [37], Anselmi [2].
10This fact is already revealed by going up to the two-loop contribution to the theory: ’t Hooft
and Veltman [61], Kallosh, Tarasov and Tyutin [34], Goroff and Sagnotti [30], van de Ven [65],

later in Sect. 1.8.
Conventional quantum ﬁeld theory is usually formulated in a ﬁxed, i.e., in, a
priori, given background geometry such as the Minkowski one. This is unlike the
formalism of “Loop Quantum Gravity” (LQG) also called “Quantum Field Theory
of Geometry”. The situation that we will encounter in this approach is of a quantum
ﬁeld theory in three dimensional space, which is a non-perturbative background
independent formulation of quantum gravity. The latter means that no speciﬁc
assumption is made about the underlying geometric structure and, interestingly
enough, the latter rather emerges from the theory. Here by setting up an eigenvalue
equation of, say, an area operator, in a quantum setting, one will encounter a
granular structure of three-dimensional space yielding a discrete spectrum for area
measurements with the smallest possible having a non-zero value given to be of
the order of the Planck length squared: „GN=c3  1066 cm2.15 The emergence of
space in terms of “quanta of geometry”, providing a granular structure of space, is
a major and beautiful prediction of the theory.
The 3 dimensional space is generated by a so-called time slicing procedure of
spacetime carried out by Arnowitt, Deser and Misner.16 The basic ﬁeld variables
in the theory is a gravitational “electric” ﬁeld, which determines the geometry
of such a 3 dimensional space and naturally emerges from the deﬁnition of the
area of a surface in such a space, and its canonical conjugate variable referred
to as the connection. By imposing equal time commutation relation of these two
canonically conjugate ﬁeld variables, the quantum version of the theory arises, and
the fundamental problem of the quantization of geometry follows. Loop variables
are deﬁned in terms of the connection, and corresponding spin-network states are
introduced to describe the underlying geometry of three space (Sect. 1.9). Here the
spin-network states correspond to microscopic degrees of freedom. The basic idea
goes to Penrose [47] whose interest was to construct the concept of space from
combining angular momenta. It is also interesting that the proportionality of entropy
and the surface area of the BH horizon in the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy formula
has been derived in loop quantum gravity.17 For general references on LQG, see also

Introduction to Quantum Gravity
We begin this chapter by developing the general geometric notion of spacetime in
general relativity from ﬁrst principles. No previous knowledge of general relativity
is required to follow the development. From this, the concept of a gravitational
ﬁeld is obtained and the graviton propagator and its inherited polarization aspects
are obtained as done in conventional quantum ﬁeld theory. Quantum ﬂuctuations
about a background metric, satisfying Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, are described and
renormalizability aspects of quantum general relativity as well of more general
quantum gravities with higher order derivatives are considered. In particular, to
study the one-loop divergence contribution to quantum GR, we develop an elegant
method, referred to as the Schwinger-DeWitt technique.18 In this respect, we also
prove two important theorems related to the “Euler-Poincaré Characteristic” and to
the “Invariant Products of so-called three Riemann tensors”. In the remaining part
of the chapter, we provide an introductory presentation of loop quantum gravity.
1.1
Geometrical Aspects, Structure of Spacetime
and Development of the General Theory of Relativity
In a geometrical context, gravity is accounted for by the curvature of spacetime
and the departure of the latter from that of the ﬂat Minkowski spacetime of special
relativity. With gravity, one associates several geometrical terms to describe the
underlying geometry of spacetime, and in this sense gravity and these geometrical
terms become simply interchangeable words for the same thing. The structure of
spacetime is then held “responsible” for the motion of a particle due to gravity
without introducing a gravitational ﬁeld as a dynamical variable as such. By such a
geometrical description, one is able to enmesh non-gravitational physical laws with
gravity via the principle of equivalence, to be discussed below, in a straightforward
manner. In turn, starting from a consistent geometrical formalism, a gravitational
ﬁeld may be introduced, as a dynamical variable, permeating an interaction between
all dynamical ﬁelds solely due to their energy-momentum content in the same way
that the Maxwell ﬁeld permeates the interaction between charged particles. Unlike
the Maxwell ﬁeld, however, which carries no charge, the gravitational ﬁeld, due to
its energy-momentum content, generates a direct self-interaction as well.
I present a simple treatment of this geometrical description in such a way that a
reader who has never been exposed to general relativity may, hopefully, be able to
follow.
A rather elementary and clear way to start and understand how Einstein’s theory
of gravitation arises is to consider, in Newtonian gravitational theory, a classic
thought experiment of an elevator in free-fall in the Earth gravity, as shown in
Fig. 1.1, neglecting, for simplicity, the Earth rotation. To account only for the
18Schwinger [55], DeWitt [21, 24]. See also [21] for the pioneering work on the description of
ﬂuctuations about an arbitrary spacetime background.

Fig. 1.1 A particle placed at the point O will remain at rest inside the elevator in free-fall, while
from outside the elevator the particle accelerates with the gravitational force. A particle placed at P
or at P 0 will remain at rest inside the elevator, only momentarily, and will eventually move toward
the center O due to the attraction of a particle to the center of the Earth. This leads to the basic
concept that at every point in spacetime, way before a particle falls to the surface of the Earth, a
coordinate system may be set up in which locally, and only locally, i.e., only at the point in question
a particle is at rest with the gravitational force wiped out
gravitational force due to the Earth one would, of course, neglect other forces.
By Newtonian gravitational theory, one usually means weak gravitational force and
slowly moving particles. In free-fall, the elevator on its way to the earth, its enter O
will move to a point, say, O 0 assumed to be tracing a line directed to the center of
the earth.
We are interested in investigating the role of gravitation, due to the Earth, on the
trajectory of a particle put, in turn at points O, P, P 0, in the elevator in free-fall, from
the point of view of what may seem to be happening inside the elevator, and what is
perceived from outside of the elevator.
A particle set at point O will remain there, in reference to the elevator in free
fall, with the gravitational force wiped out at that point, while from outside of the
elevator the particle is seen to accelerate in the Earth gravity. On the other hand, a
particle placed at point P or point P 0 the situation is different. Inside the elevator, the
particle will eventually move toward the center O due to the attraction of a particle
toward the center of the Earth. For a very short time, however, depending on the
accuracy being sought, the particle will be considered to be at rest at the point in
question inside (i.e., relative to) the elevator, indicating, momentarily, the absence of
a gravitational ﬁeld, while from outside of the elevator the particle again accelerates
in the Earth gravity. By considering the elevator, described by a coordinate system,

Introduction to Quantum Gravity
in which a particle is momentarily at rest, we need to introduce an inﬁnite number,
in a continuous manner, of such local coordinate systems, as we move, indicating
progress in time, along the line going from the point O to the point O 0, in each of
which the particle is momentarily at rest, while in a general coordinate system set
up in space, way above the Earth surface, a particle accelerates in the Earth gravity.
This is translated, by saying, that at every point in spacetime, way before falling to
the Earth, a coordinate may be set up in which a particle, locally and only locally,
i.e., only at the given point in question in spacetime, the gravitational force is wiped
out.
Within a relativistic framework, the above is formulated in the following way.
One is interested in ﬁnding the role of gravitation at a given point in spacetime. This
may be done by introducing a test particle at the point in question. As the particle
moves in spacetime, it will trace a curve which may be parametrized in terms of
its proper time 
. At every point of spacetime along such a curve, one may set up
a local inertial frame, in which locally, and only locally, the particle has zero four
acceleration, i.e., it would satisfy the special relativistic law d.dX=d
/=d
 D 0,
thus giving the equation of a straight line for the four velocity dX=d
 at the point in
question, where d
2 D  ˛ˇ dX˛ dXˇ. For a massless particle, such as the photon,
one may replace 
 above by q D X0, and the equation of the straight line, for a
massless particle, in the local Lorentz coordinate system becomes d.dX=dq/=dq D
0, with ˛ˇ .dX˛=dq/ .dXˇ=dq/ D 0 . In the sequel, we use, in general, the notation
 for such parameters.
The role of gravitation on the particle is then described by the comparison of all
such inertial frames and by the elucidation on the way they relate to one another.
Intuitively, in a geometrical sense, gravitation would imply a departure of a particle’s
path from a straight line, as deﬁned in a so-called ﬂat local Lorentz frame, to a
curved one attributed to an underlying curved geometric structure as will be seen
below.
This brings us to what is called the principle of equivalence in a more general
context: At every point in spacetime, one sets up a local Lorentz frame, such that
locally in it, and only locally, the laws of physics, not involving gravitation, may be
formulated by the application of special relativity, and the role of gravitation is then
taken into account by the comparison of such local Lorentz frames and by the way
they are inﬁnitesimally related to one another.
From a pure geometrical picture, the above means that for sufﬁciently small
regions such as on a curved surface, these regions may be considered to be ﬂat.
In a limiting sense, at every point on such a curved surface, one may then set
up a coordinate system corresponding to a completely ﬂat space, in which special
relativity applies at the point in question. To account for gravity, then one, clearly,
needs a structure to tell us how such coordinates may be arranged relative to
each and how the origin of one coordinate system is related to the origin of an
inﬁnitesimally close one and hence also give us the relation between the local
Lorentz coordinates and of the underlying spacetime. This structure is referred to
as the connection.

Fig. 1.2 The connection allows us to compare the tangent spaces shown in grey, on the left-hand
side of the ﬁgure, at inﬁnitesimally separated points on the curve parametrized by . At every
point x./ on the curve parametrized by , a Lorentz coordinate system is set up with coordinates
X1; X2; : : :
Figure 1.2 shows how Lorentz frames (ﬂat spaces), referred to as tangent spaces
here, may be set up at various points and arranged in a region of a curved space, with
their origins falling, say, on a curve in spacetime parametrized by some parameter .
The connection would then allow us to compare how a pair of such tangent spaces,
at inﬁnitesimally separated points, are arranged relative to each other. It is deﬁned
in terms of the concept of parallel transport to be discussed below. It is important to
know that it is not necessary to consider such a curved structure to be embedded in
a higher dimension. It just helps one to visualize the situation.
At every point x./, on such a curve, in a general curvilinear coordinate
description of curved spacetime, one sets up a Lorentz coordinate system with
coordinate basis vector ﬁelds e˛.x/, where ˛ is a Lorentz index, i.e., it refers
to the local Lorentz coordinate system, and the  indices refer to the generalized
coordinates. In a globally everywhere ﬂat Minkowski space, the curved lines,
speciﬁed by x1; x2; : : :, originating from the origin of the local Lorentz coordinate
system, on the right-hand side of Fig. 1.2, will straighten up and lie along the axes
X1; X2; : : : and the basis vectors will reduce simply to e˛ D •˛. In the more
general case with a curved spacetime, and only within this context of the comparison
of two such systems, it has been customary to use indices from the beginning of the
Greek alphabet ˛; ˇ; : : : for the Lorentz ones, and indices from about the middle of
the alphabet : : : ; ; ; : : : (and beyond) for the generalized coordinate ones. We use
this notation in the present section to avoid any confusion. Clearly, the orientation of
the axes speciﬁed by X1; X2; : : : are arbitrary and amounts to a freedom of carrying
a local Lorentz transformation to re-orient these axes.
A vector ﬁeld V./, with components V˛.x/, ˛ D 0; 1; 2; 3, in a local Lorentz
coordinate system set up at point , on a curve parametrized by , with coordinate

The ﬁelds e˛.x/ are called tetrad or vierbein ﬁelds. Thus the index  speciﬁes
the different vector ﬁelds in the curvilinear coordinate system, while an index ˛

Due to the symmetric nature of the product in (1.1.4), g is taken to be symmetric.

Let us consider just for a moment a global ﬂat Minkowski spacetime. In it
we deﬁne the parallel transfer, or parallel transport, of basis vectors along a
curve parametrized by a parameter , where they are literally moved parallel to
themselves, by
d e.x.//

with the parallel transport of the basis vectors as given above,

D dV./
d./
e.x/:
(1.1.8)

1.1

In curved space, this parallelism is taken over by introducing, in the process, the
concept of a covariant derivative, or equivalently by taking into account of the way
the basis vectors e˛ .x.// turn as  is made to vary, to make up for the difference
in such a geometrical context in a straightforward manner.
To ﬁnd the derivative of V./, with respect to , we need to know how these
tangent spaces at ,  C d arrange themselves with respect to each other. That is,
we need to know how the basis vectors change as we move inﬁnitesimally when  is
made to vary. This is done by introducing the concept of parallel transport. It is here
where we need a structure, referred to as the connection, to quantify this change. To
this end, we note that e.x. C d//  e.x.//, must vanish for dx./ ! 0. Also
at , it may be expanded in terms of e.x.//. That is, the derivative of e.x.//
with respect to  at this point, may be written as
d
d e.x.// D  
.x/ e.x/ dx./
d
;
(1.1.9)
where the totality of the expansion coefﬁcients f  .x/g is called the connection.
This equation may be also rewritten as


d
D 0;
(1.1.10)
which should be compared with the globally ﬂat space case on the right-hand side
of (1.1.7), and generalizes the concept of parallel transport of the basis vectors along
the curve in question to that of a curved space thanks to the introduction of the
connection as a result of the turning that the basis vectors go through to achieve this
in spacetime.
Accordingly, the derivative of a vector V./ ﬁeld, with respect to the parameter
, follows from (1.1.1), (1.1.9) to be simply
dV.x/

;
(1.1.12)
where we have used the notation DV=d for a component in order not to confuse
it with the ﬁrst term dV=d on the left-hand side of (1.1.12).
To reconcile with the fact that the just mentioned components are indeed compo-
nents of a vector ﬁeld, a rule of transformation for the connection automatically
follows. Under a coordinate transformation x ! x0, the relation between the
components V.x/, V0.x 0/ is, by deﬁnition, given by the chain rule, to be
V .x/ D @x

Due to the second term on the right-hand of (1.1.14), the connection is not a tensor

With covariant derivatives properly introduced, theories may be then developed
in terms of such derivatives which are invariant under general coordinate systems.
That is, they would lead, self-consistently, to theories which are invariant in such a
curved spacetime due to gravity.
Upon writing dV.x/=d D @V.x/ .dx=d/, we may use (1.1.12) to introduce

At every point in spacetime we may set up locally a Lorentz coordinate system,
in which the laws of special relativity hold such as, for example, that the partial
derivative of a vector is a tensor locally and hence the connection vanishes. We
cannot, however, conclude that the connection vanishes at every point in a general
coordinate system since the connection is not a tensor as we have seen in (1.1.14).
The combination

a tensor. We may thus conclude from the transformation law in (1.1.15), that at any
given point the latter combination must be zero as we consider the transformation
from a local Lorentz coordinate system to a general coordinate system at the given
point in question. That is, the connection is symmetric    D   .

In view of developing theories invariant under general coordinate transformation
and to account for the role of gravitation, we have learnt how to deﬁne covariant
derivatives of tensor, vector and scalar ﬁelds. We have also learnt, in particular,
how to introduce covariant derivatives of vector ﬁelds components V.x/, V.x/ in
a general coordinate system. In Sect. 2.4, of Chap. 2 dealing with supersymmetry,
we will see how the covariant derivative of a Dirac ﬁeld is deﬁned and further
generalizations will be carried out in Sect. 2.5 needed to develop supergravity. This
will not be needed in the present chapter.
In developing invariant theories involving such ﬁelds under general coordinate
transformations to account for the role of gravitation, one needs also to introduce
an invariant deﬁnition corresponding to a volume element in spacetime, which
would be needed in deﬁning an action integral. To this end, we note that under
a general coordinate transformation x ! x 0, a spacetime volume element .dx/
changes to j det.@x=@x 0/j .dx 0/ via the Jacobian. On the other hand, under such
a transformation, the basis vectors e˛.x/ transform as covariant components, with
general coordinate indices , as follows [see (1.1.9)]

What is special about a geodesic equation? Again coming back to describing the
role of gravitation at a given spacetime point, one may consider a test particle at the
point x./ in question at which a local Lorentz coordinate has been set up. Locally,
at the point x./, and only at this point, with labeling X˛./ pertaining to the latter

(1.1.31)
i.e., dX˛./=d satisﬁes the equation of a straight line at the point in question.
The geodesic equation in (1.1.30) is the corresponding generalized straight line in
curved spacetime, with the mathematical statement of the principle of equivalence
that the connection  .x/ vanishes, locally, in the local Lorentz coordinate system
at its origin with coordinate label x./. Thus a geodesic in curved spacetime is the
equation of a straight line in the local Lorentz coordinate system set up at the point
in question.
By setting up local Lorentz coordinate at spacetime points in curved spacetime,
and using the principle of equivalence, one is able to enmesh physical laws,
as developed in special relativity, with gravity. In such a context, gravitation
is visualized as a geometric property of spacetime. With it one associates such
geometrical terms as the metric, involved in measuring intervals in spacetime and
hence obviously appears in deﬁning an invariant measure of a spacetime volume
element as seen in (1.1.26), the connection which tells us how coordinate basis
vectors rotate, or equivalently as how pairs of inﬁnitesimally close tangent spaces
are arranged relative to each other in investigating the parallel transfer of a vector
along a curve such as a geodesic. With gravitation one also associates a structure of
most importance called the Riemann curvature discussed next. With such geometric
notions, information on gravity is obtained by probing the geometry of spacetime.
How does the Riemann curvature arise and what is its signiﬁcance? As in the
investigation of the non-abelian gauge ﬁelds, associated with internal degrees of
freedom,19 it arises due to the non-commutativity of the components of the covariant
derivative. Moreover, properties based on commutation relations are statements
concerning measurements. On may obtain the explicit expression for the Riemann
curvature by considering the parallel transport of a vector along a closed loop in
spacetime. A far more physically interesting way to investigate the nature of the
Riemann curvature, is by comparing inﬁnitesimally close paths (worldlines) of two
test particles, referred to as the method of geodesic deviations. This is discussed
next. The investigation of the non-commutativity of covariant derivatives will follow
this discussion.
On the left-hand side of Fig. 1.3, consider the relative acceleration of the two
test particles at P and P 0, as now perceived from outside the elevator in free-fall, in
Newtonian physics. On the other hand, on the right-hand side, two inﬁnitesimally
close geodesics are shown in curved spacetime. Points on the two geodesics are
identiﬁed and compared at the same given values of a parameter , which may be
19It is worth comparing this with the non-abelian gauge theories cases investigated in Vol. I [43].

If the latter is not equal to zero, it provides evidence of the presence of gravitation,
as a manifestation of the spacetime curvature, by the observed deviation of two
neighboring geodesics. It is important to note that a tensor which vanishes in
one coordinate system vanishes in every coordinate system. Accordingly, although
gravitational forces may be eliminated locally by a suitable choice of a coordinate
system, the non vanishing of the tensor R    in a given coordinate system

(1.1.54)
which is referred to as the Einstein tensor, satisfying a covariant generalization of

gravitation as we will see in the next section.
To make contact with conventional perturbative ﬁeld theory, in which a ﬁeld may
be introduced for gravitation, one may use the fact that the metric g .x/, used
to measure intervals in curved spacetime, will deviate from the Minkowski metric
due to gravity. Upon introducing a coupling parameter , which will be expressed
in terms of the gravitational constant, one introduces a gravitational ﬁeld h.x/
deﬁned through
g .x/ D   C  h.x/;
(1.1.55)
describing ﬂuctuations about the Minkowski metric. In a weak coupling limit,
the ﬁeld h.x/, which responds to gauge transformations, as will be investigated
later, describes a massless particle of spin 2—the graviton, with a corresponding
propagator which mediates the gravitational interaction between all particles. This
and general quantum aspects of gravitation will be the subject of Sect. 1.3 and other
sections.
Before closing this section and in view of application in curved spacetime, we
recall the deﬁnition of the Levi-Civita symbol

Partial integration reads slightly in a different manner in curved spacetime. In

see Problem 1.10.
From (1.2.2), (1.2.5), (1.1.53), in particular, we learn that the action W is
invariant under the gauge transformations
•g.x/ D  .r.x/ C r.x//;

with an overall plus sign for the variation of the metric relative to its inverse matrix

For future reference, the above transformation in (1.2.8) may be rewritten in an
equivalent form as follows. To this end, we may write, in detail,
•g.x/ D gr.x/ C gr.x/

(1.2.9)
where in the writing the second line, we have used the deﬁnition of the covariant
derivative of a vector ﬁeld, and then added and subtracted the term @g 
@g. We recognize the last term on the right-hand side of (1.2.9) as  rg
which is zero. Hence (1.2.8) may be equivalently rewritten simply as
•g.x/ D g@ C g@.x/ C @g:
(1.2.10)
At this stage, it is important to bring the above theory, based on the Einstein-
Hilbert action, in contact with that of Newton’s theory of gravitation. The potential
energy '.X/, in the latter, due to a mass distribution with mass density .X/ is given
by

Working in units, in which c D 1, we may, upon comparison of these two
equations and making use, in the process, of (1.2.12) and (1.2.16), that we may
take R00 	 4	G T00, where we have identiﬁed the mass density with T00 of the
energy-momentum tensor associated with matter. We may identify S00 in (1.2.15)
with 4	G T00 by noting that with g00 	 1, T D T00 C Ti i 	 T00, with Ti i
negligible in comparison to T00, for low speeds of the underlying matter particles,
we obtain for the right-hand side of (1.2.15) the expression 8	G .T00=2/. Hence as
a tensor equation, the ﬁeld equation (1.2.14) is taken as

(1.2.20)
which is the celebrated Einstein’s equation of general relativity.
The above doesn’t yet tell us how to generate the energy-momentum tensor and,
in turn, deﬁne the parameter  in (1.2.1). To this end, we introduce a Lagrangian

Z pg .dx/ R 2;
Z pg .dx/ RR; : : : ;
(1.2.25)
up to proportionality constants, where  is referred to as a cosmological constant.
The remaining actions are of higher orders in derivatives than the Einstein-Hilbert
action and are more problematic in conventional ﬁeld theory studies.24 We will
consider such terms in Sect. 1.8.
1.3
Quantum Particle Aspect of Gravitation: The Graviton
and Polarization Aspects
The quantum particle associated with the gravitational ﬁeld, the so-called graviton,
emerges by considering the small ﬂuctuation of the metric about the Minkowski one
as the limit of the full metric where the gravitational ﬁeld becomes weaker and the
particle becomes identiﬁed.
We consider the action of general relativity,

where for the simplicity of the notation we have set the parameter  D 1. One may
restore it at any stage. The ﬂuctuation about the Minkowski metric is obtained by
writing
g D  C h:
(1.3.4)
One eventually then carries out an expansion of the action in “powers” of h by
using, in the process, the Minkowski metric to lower and raise indices. Details of
such expansions are summarized in Box 1.1.
We may write det Œg as det Œ˛ˇ det Œ ı  C h  and note that h D

volume, we recognize the expression between the round brackets in (1.3.7) as the
Lagrangian density of a massless spin 2-particle.
Covariant descriptions of the graviton in second order and ﬁrst order formalisms
are dealt with in the following two subsections, respectively.
1.3.1
Second Order Covariant Formalism
The Lagrangian density in (1.3.7) is, up to a total derivative, invariant under the
transformation

one may always choose   D @.h  1

combination satisﬁes the gauge condition

We provide a covariant description of the graviton and work with the following
convenient constraint:


D ;
(1.3.11)
for some vector ﬁeld . This constraint may be derived directly from a Lagrangian
density having the following structure

h  1
2 h

C  ;
(1.3.12)
where LG is the Lagrangian density within the round brackets in (1.3.7) for a spin 2
massless particle. We have added an external source coupling to the ﬁeld h which
simpliﬁes the work quite a bit.

Emission and Gravitational Radiation
As we have seen in the beginning of this section, the quantum particle associated
with the gravitational ﬁeld, the so-called graviton, emerges by considering the small
ﬂuctuation of the metric about the Minkowski one as the limit of the full metric
where the gravitational ﬁeld becomes weaker and the particle becomes identiﬁed.27

Quantum Fluctuation About a Background Metric
We consider quantum ﬂuctuations about a given classical background metric g
which satisﬁes Einstein’s ﬁeld equation.32 To this end, we carry out the following
replacement of the classical metric g
g ! g C h;
(1.4.1)
in the Einstein-Hilbert action in (1.2.1), suppressing the depence of the action on the
parameter , with h now describing quantum ﬂuctuations. This leads to the new
action denoted by W:
W D
Z p
g.x/.dx/ R.x/ !
Z p
g.x/.dx/ R.x/
ˇˇˇŒg!.g C h/  W:
(1.4.2)
From (1.2.10), we may infer that for a given background metric g, the new action
W is invariant under inﬁnitesimal transformation of h
•h D .g C h/ @ C .g C h/ @ C @.g C h/:
(1.4.3)
Introducing the covariant derivative r deﬁned in terms of the background metric
g, we may rewrite the above transformation as33
•h D .g C h/ r C .g C h/ r C rh;
(1.4.4)
where in writing the last term we have used the fact that rg D 0.
We now develop the theory of quantum ﬂuctuations, about a given background
metric g, with the latter satisfying Einstein’s ﬁeld equation, as follows. We carry
out the analysis up to second order in h starting from the action W. In particular,
we note that indices are lowered via the metric g, and raised via its inverse g.
That is, covariance is deﬁned in terms of the background metric. Also we note that
the covariant derivative r is deﬁned in terms of the background metric g and is
independent of h. For simplicity of the notation, any coupling parameter has been
absorbed in h.
As in the entries of Box 1.1 (Sect. 1.3) we have, up to second order, in particular,
pg ! pg .1 C 1
2 h C 1
8 h2  1
4 h h/;
(1.4.5)
g ! g  h C h h;
(1.4.6)
32The background ﬁeld method was introduced by DeWitt [21].

We will see, however, only the ﬁrst correction in •  will contribute as given
in (1.4.10) below.
The investigation of the transformation rule of the Ricci tensor R is more
involved. This has been considered in Problem 1.7, part (iii), to ﬁrst order. Let us
consider this afresh for additional clarity and for generalization to second order.
Let •1  C •2  denote the correction of the connection up to second order.
From (1.1.49), we explicitly have up to second order, using the notation: R !

(1.4.7)
by conveniently re-arranging the order of the various terms, and by relabeling
dummy indices. We recognize the expressions within the ﬁrst two pairs of square
brackets, as the difference between two covariant derivatives: [r.•1C•2/
 r.•1 C •2/]. Accordingly the explicit change in the Ricci tensor, up to
second order, may be rewritten as
•R D r.•1   C •2 /  r.•1  C •2 /
C •1  •1   •1  •1 :
(1.4.8)
To ﬁrst order, this reduces to the expression given in Problem 1.7 (iii) as expected.
The ﬁrst two terms give rise to the following contributions to the new action
pg g r

As expected, the expression within the second pair of square brackets coincides,
up to total derivatives, with the one within the round brackets in (1.3.7) when the

To study the one loop contribution to the effective action of quantum general
relativity based on the description of quantum ﬂuctuation about a classic metric just
developed, we consider ﬁrst a useful technique, referred to as the Schwinger-DeWitt
technique, to this end.

1.5
The Schwinger-DeWitt Technique
The Schwinger technique34 of a parametric representation of a propagator and
the generation of an effective action was introduced and applied for a particular
case in Sect. 3.7 of Vol. I. In the present section, we consider further aspects of
this technique for wider applications with additional generalizations due to Bryce
DeWitt.35 This powerful and elegant technique is referred to as the Schwinger-
DeWitt technique. This will be used in the next section for studying the one loop
contribution to the effective action of quantum general relativity based on the
description of quantum ﬂuctuation about a classic metric developed in the previous
section.
For the simplest treatment of this technique, consider ﬁrst the propagator
associated with a free scalar ﬁeld in n-dimensional Minkowski spacetime

An equally important parametric relation involving the propagator, and in view
of applications to the effective action in quantum gravity, is the evaluation of the
simple functional integral of the form in (II.13)–(II.18) in Appendix II at the end of
this volume, involving a scalar ﬁeld :

regularization.

understood that the trace over the other variables pertinent to the problem in hand
have been carried out.

in the neighborhood of the origin. The coefﬁcients ak.x/, referred to as DeWitt
coefﬁcients, are obtained from the coincident limit x0 ! x of recursion relations
derived from the application in (1.5.22).38 From power counting, for n D 4, it is
easy to see that for s ! 0, the divergences occur for k D 0; 1; 2. Dimensional
regularization, however, wipes out the singularities for k D 0; 1, and the divergence
of the expression of TrŒ ln ˝  in (1.5.27) comes solely from the DeWitt coefﬁcient
a2.x/. The corresponding analysis will be carried out in Sect. 1.7.
In the next section, the one loop contribution to the effective action of quantum
general relativity is obtained, and the Schwinger-DeWitt technique is applied to it to
rewrite it in a manageable form for further analysis. Dimensional regularization is
applied to the one loop contribution in Sect. 1.7. This is followed by Sect. 1.8 which
deals, in general, with renormalization aspects of quantum gravity.

In the following section dimensional regularization is applied to the expression
in (1.6.14) to extract its divergent part.

Dimensional Regularization of the One Loop

The one loop contribution to the effective action  Œ 1  of quantum general relativity
was derived in the previous section with its expression displayed in (1.6.14). The

where we have used the deﬁnition in (1.5.26). For n D 4, we note that in the
neighborhood of the origin: s ' 0, that upon expanding F.x I s/ in powers of s,
as given in (1.5.28) and below in (1.7.6), the above integral diverges at the lower
end for k D 0; 1; 2 in the expansion of F.x I s/.
In dimensional regularization, the above integral is deﬁned by analytic contin-
uation from a domain in which n < 0, where it converges, to a value close to
the actual dimension of spacetime. Assuming the integrand in the above integral
vanishes rapidly for s ! 1, and through integration by parts twice, for n < 0,
using, in the process, the equality

Quantum general relativity is one-loop ﬁnite on the mass shell, i.e., for R D

the explicit computations involved in determining the coefﬁcients a2.x/; a2ghost.x/

part in the ﬁeld h in the Lagrangian density now contains the higher order term 2,
thus leading to a propagator which vanishes like 1=k4 instead of 1=k2, for k2 ! 1,
and destroys the positivity required by a quantum theory in a perturbative setting.50

Before

what

non-
renormalizable, let us ﬁrst investigate the divergence problem of quantum general
relativity in two and multi loops.
1.8.1
Two and Multi Loops
Consider the two-loop contribution. 2 is the expansion parameter in the loop
expansion. With „ set equal to one, the divergent part in two loops must be
proportional to the dimensionless integral:
2
Z
.dx/pg F.x/;

by Tomboulis [63].

the process of renormalization, such that the right behavior of a propagator for p2 ! 1 is
maintained thus avoiding non-positivity conditions, by expanding the metric around the Minkowski

where, because of dimensional reasons, F.x/ must be of dimensionality Œ Length6.
Clearly, any invariant of the form proportional to R.x/, or R.x/, i.e., having the
structures R.x/R.x/ R.x/R.x/ cannot contribute to F.x/ on the mass shell. On
other hand, any term having a structure such as:

may, from Problem 1.10, be written as a total derivative @.pg /, on the mass
shell, for some vector , and hence cannot contribute to the integral in (1.8.19).
Accordingly, only invariant products of three Riemann tensors, with each tensor
involving two derivatives, may contribute to F.x/ above. In Appendix D of this
chapter, we prove the remarkable result that all such invariants, on the mass shell,
are proportional to the invariant
R R R;

On the other hand, since the one-loop contribution is ﬁnite, the divergence, in
the two-loop contribution, must come from an overall integration as all the sub-
integrations are ﬁnite by dimensional regularization, implying that the two-loop
divergence must be proportional to a single power of 1=" instead of a quadratic
expression for the leading term.52 Accordingly the general expression for the two-
loop divergent part of quantum general relativity may be written to have the explicit
form

involving only one numerical constant c 2. If the latter constant were zero the theory
would be two-loop ﬁnite. Unfortunately, as has been conﬁrmed by two groups,53
the constant c 2 turns up to be not zero, implying that perturbative quantum general
relativity is non-renormalizable as we now discuss.
We note that the Einstein-Hilbert action contain terms of second order in

with such terms as in (1.8.15), (1.8.23), to deﬁne new coefﬁcients which are to be
determined experimentally. However, such terms, in turn, will, in general, generate
divergent terms in the effective action of arbitrary high order loops, giving rise to
an inﬁnite number of parameters that are to be determined experimentally, and the
theory would lose its predictive power. This is what is meant that the theory is
perturbatively non-renormalizable. It is traced back to the fact that the expansion
coupling 2 has a dimensionality of positive power of length: Œ Length2. Non-
renormalizability still holds when scalars, Yang-Mills ﬁelds ﬁeld as well as the
photon, are included in the theory. Here it is important to note that R ¤ 0 in
the presence of such ﬁelds and ﬁniteness even in one-loop fails.54
Let us investigate how the divergences in the perturbative loop-expansion
changes with the increase of the number of loops. To this end, we note by working
in the momentum presentation, that the graviton propagator given in (1.3.18), (an
internal line to a graph) carrying a momentum p goes like 1=p2, and a vertex involves
two derivatives and goes like p2. Two lines joining two vertices generate a loop with
momentum integration goes like p4. Three lines joining two vertices generate two
loops. Moreover, a graph55 involving `int lines, L loops, and V vertices satisfy the
relation
L D `int  V C 1:
(1.8.25)
By power counting, we may deﬁne the superﬁcial degree of divergence of a graph g
by
d.g/ D 4 L C 2 V  2 `int;
(1.8.26)
where the factor 4 multiplying the number of loops L corresponds to the dimension
of spacetime. The factor 2 multiplying the number of vertices V corresponds to the
two powers of momenta in a vertex part. The factor 2 multiplying the number of
lines ` int corresponds to the two powers of the inverse of the momenta associated
with a propagator. From (1.8.25), (1.8.26), we may solve for d.g/ in terms of the
number of loops L :
d.g/ D 2 C 2 L :
(1.8.27)
54See, e.g., [20], also [61].
55Here one is considering a connected proper graph, where proper means that it cannot become
disconnected by cutting a single line.

Introduction to Quantum Gravity
Thus we see that the superﬁcial degree of divergence increases without bound with
the number of loops.
The increase of the superﬁcial degree of divergence d.g/ with the number
of loops, naturally urges one to investigate the role of the renormalizabilty of a
corresponding quantum gravity involving higher order derivatives terms added to
the Einstein-Hilbert action. This is discussed next.

leads, as a consequence of the presence of the higher order term 2 in the kinetic
quadratic part in h in the Lagrangian density, to a propagator which falls of as
1=p4, instead of 1=p 2 at high momenta, as discussed earlier. Now the total number
of derivatives is 4. This simply implies to replace the 2 multiplying the number of
lines `int in the superﬁcial degree of divergence d.g/ in (1.8.26) by  4, and the 2
multiplying V by 4. From (1.8.25), (1.8.26), this tells that the superﬁcial degree of
divergence in this case becomes replaced by
d.g/ D 4:
(1.8.29)
independently of the number of loops, and the renormalizability of the modiﬁed
theory may be then established56 with only a ﬁnite number of parameters subjected
to an experimental determination. Unfortunately, such a theory involves ghosts in a
perturbative treatment, due to the rapid damping of the propagator at high energies
faster than 1=p2, and gives rise, in turn, to negative probabilities.57
We have seen that in a perturbative setting, the non-renormalizability of quantum
GR implies the need of an inﬁnite number of parameters are to be determined
experimentally and hence is not of any practical value. These inﬁnite number of
parameters arise as one must add an inﬁnite number of new terms to the Lagrangian
density of GR, referred to as counter terms, to make the theory ﬁnite at the cost of
having an inﬁnite number of parameters to be determined in a perturbative setting. A
non-perturbative approach, however, to the renormalization of such a theory may be
56See [59].
57A a quantum viewpoint treatment of a higher derivative modiﬁcation of the linearized Einstein-
Hilbert action in (1.2.1) obtained by replacing R in it by RCa R 2 with a > 0, shows that the theory
involves, in addition to the graviton, a massive scalar particle which cannot be gauged away and
no ghosts arise in the theory—see [42].

developed, referred to as asymptotic safety, and is discussed next for completeness
but rather brieﬂy.
One may consider the above generalizations of GR involving all such inﬁnite
number of terms added to the Lagrangian density of GR each of which satisﬁes
the same symmetry as in GR, implying the invariance of the generated action
under general coordinate transformations, in a non-perturbativesetting as follows. A
renormalization group analysis, which relates the theory at different energy scales, is
carried out with the main interest to investigate the theory at high energies at which
ultraviolet divergences may appear. One envisages and subsequently consistently
checks that effective couplings gi.k/ corresponding to the (dimensionless) couplings
deﬁned in the theory,58 approach ﬁxed points: gi.k/ ! g
i at high energy k ! 1,
i.e., the g
i are zeros of the beta functions59 of the renormalization group. The tacit
assumption in deﬁning an asymptotically safe theory, which is then consistently
veriﬁed via solutions of the renormalization group, is that one may restrict to
those theories involving only a subclass of the couplings, referred to as relevant
couplings, such that only a ﬁnite number of parameters are to be determined.60 The
corresponding theory is then referred to as asymptotically safe, and considered to
be consistent and meaningful in a non-perturbative sense.61 In this sense a non-
perturbative treatment would establish a renormalizable quantum gravity if it is
asymptotically safe. The great challenge is, of course, not only establish ultraviolet
ﬁniteness of the full theory, that no unphysical singularities in the theory would
arise,62 and most importantly, as just mentioned, that only a ﬁnite number of
parameters need to be adjusted if the theory is to be considered reliable. Much
work has been done on this63 and further work is needed. Here one introduces
an ultraviolet cut-off in the effective action as well as suppress energy modes less
58These are referred to dimensionless couplings in the sense that if the mass dimension of a
dimensionful coupling Qg is d, and Qg.k/ denotes the coupling deﬁned at a renormalization point with
energy scale k, then one may deﬁne its dimensionless counterpart coupling by g.k/ D .k/d Qg.k/.
The couplings are also restricted to those that do not change when a point-transformation of a ﬁeld
is carried since, in reference, to physical quantities the latter do not depend on how the ﬁelds are
deﬁned. Such inessential couplings g 0 give rise to partial derivatives of the Lagrangian density
@L =@g 0 which are at most total derivatives (or zero) when the Euler-Lagrange equations are used.
See [67].
59We have encountered beta functions in abelian and non-abelian gauge theories in much details in
Vol. I [43].
60One assumes at least one of the relevant couplings g
i ¤ 0. The reason is that when one considers
the application of the renormalization group to a physical quantity Q, such as a total cross section
of a process, and D is the dimensionality of Q, and E is some energy characterizing, then the
high energy behavior of the quantity .E/DR is governed by g.E/ deﬁned in terms of the relevant
couplings.
61This approach was introduced by Weinberg [67].
62Anselmi [2], Gomis and Weinberg [29].
63See, e.g., [46, 48, 49, 64].

than the energy k at which the theory is being considered.64 We will not, however,
consider asymptotic safety further, as it is beyond the scope of this book, and refer
the reader to the references just mentioned.
One may generally improve the ultraviolet behavior of a theory when more
symmetry is built into it. In supersymmetry, in particular, where there is a symmetry
between fermionic and bosonic ﬁelds, and each bosonic degree of freedom has
a supersymmetric fermionic degree of freedom counterpart and vice versa,65
the ultraviolet behavior of the theory improves. This is because often divergent
fermionic contributions from loops are canceled by the corresponding superpartner
bosonic contributions and vice versa.66 As a consequence of this, the divergence
problem in a supersymmetric generalization of general relativity, referred to as
supergravity, turns out to be better than the one in general relativity. Divergences,
nevertheless, seem to appear in higher order loops, with variations depending on the
number of supercharges (Sect. 2.1) involved in the theory and the dimensionality
taken for spacetime.67
General relativity is expected to emerge as a low energy limit of a more
fundamental theory, as the former has been quite successful in the low energy
classical regime. Referring to (1.8.24), if one formally combines the coefﬁcients
Nc1; Nd1; : : : with a priori existing coefﬁcients of such identical terms in a modiﬁed
Einstein-Hilbert action version which includes such identical structures, to generate
new ﬁnite parameters in the resulting theory, the number of parameters that have to
be taken from experiments increase with no bound as we go to higher order loops.
The modiﬁed terms beyond the Einstein-Hilbert action, however, involve higher
order derivatives, and in a momentum description involve powers of momenta. In
this sense, one may expect that such modiﬁcations are not important at low energies
or equivalently in computations dealing with the long distance behavior of the
theory, and one may expect, in turn, that the Einstein-Hilbert action to dominate
in this regime. A brief account of this is given below.
1.8.3
The Low Energy Regime: Quantum GR as an Effective
Field Theory and Modiﬁcation of Newton’s Gravitational
Potential
One is led to believe that Einstein’s general relativity is a low energy effective theory
as the low energy limit of a more complicated theory, and as such it provides a
reliable description of gravitation at low energies.
64This is in the spirit of Wilson’s [68] (see also [69] ) non-perturbative analysis of renormalizability
of a theory which treats renormalizable and non-renormalizable theories on equal footings.
65This is treated in Chap. 2.
66See, e.g., Sect. 2.10.
67See, e.g., [19].

1.8
Renormalization Aspects of Quantum Gravity: Explicit Structures of One-. . .
63
One may argue that the non-renormalizability of a quantum theory based on GR
is due to the fact that one is trying to use it at energies which are far beyond its
range of validity. As a matter of fact the derivatives occurring in the theory, in a
momentum description, may be treated as small at sufﬁciently low energies treating
it as an effective theory. Several applications on such an approach have been carried
out as determining corrections to Newton’s gravitational potential.
The modiﬁed terms beyond the Einstein-Hilbert action as counter terms needed
to redeﬁne coupling parameters in a perturbative setting, through the process of
renormalization discussed above in this section, involve higher order derivatives,
and in a momentum description involve powers of momenta. In this sense, one may
expect that such modiﬁcations are not important at low energies or equivalently in
computations dealing with the long distance behavior of the theory, and one may
expect, in turn, that the Einstein-Hilbert action to dominate in this regime.
As ultraviolet divergences are associated with the small distance behavior of the
theory, one tries to separate low energy effects from high energy ones, in view of
applications in the low energy regime even if the theory has unfavorable ultraviolet
behavior such as in quantum gravity. For interesting applications of such effective
theories, in long distance applications, see, e.g., Bjerrum-Bohr et al. [15, 16];
Donoghue [25–27].

At this stage assuming the validity of a perturbation expansion to second order

down corrections that may arise in the modiﬁcation of Newton’s static potential

Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity
“Loop Quantum Gravity” (LQG) is a non-perturbative background independent
formulation of quantum gravity. It is very interesting in the sense that space itself
emerges from the theory. The theory stems from general relativity and ends up to
be quite remote from it, but it retains the basic desirable ingredient of background
independence. In “Loop quantum Gravity”, we will encounter a quantum ﬁeld
theory in three dimensional space.
Our interest is measuring areas of surfaces in such a 3 dimensional space. We
will see that the latter is written in terms of a ﬁeld E i a, obtained directly from
the deﬁnition of area of a surface, and is referred to, generally, as a gravitational
“electric” ﬁeld, which, in turn, is expressed in terms of triads e jb in this space. Here
a; b D 1; 2; 3, pertain to this space, while i; j denote Euclidean space indices. The
metric on the 3 dimensional space is simply given by qa b D e ia ıij e jb. In a technical
language, E i a is called a densitized triad which determines the geometry of the 3
dimensional space. We then deﬁne, a canonical conjugate variable to E i a, referred
to as a connection, and ﬁnally impose equal commutation relations on this pair of
canonical conjugate ﬁeld variables promoting the formalism to the quantum world.
LQG is described by an SU.2/ gauge theory involving this connection giving rise
to the parallel transport of a spinor along a curve and leads naturally to the concept
of what is called a holonomy, as a propagator of parallel transport of a spinor. It also
involves the densitized triad, mentioned above, as the canonical conjugate of the
connection which determines the geometry of space instead of the metric or of its
departure from the Minkowski metric. These two basic ﬁelds : the connection and
the densitized triad, are referred to Ashtekar variables.71 The theory is formulated
in terms of these variables, where the connection dependence arises through the
holonomy, and of quantum loops 72 expressed in terms of the holonomies. It may be
stated that in this formalism, a priori, one is dealing with a quantum ﬁeld theory in
three dimensional space formulated in terms of the Ashtekar variables.
The states of space are described by the superposition of so-called spin-network
states.73 The basic idea goes to Penrose [47] whose interest was to construct
the concept of space from combining angular momenta. Spin-network states are
functionals of the connection and are deﬁned in terms of a graph, its lines and
vertices and are represented in a particular way which will be spelled out as we go
along. For the time being, it sufﬁces to say that they diagonalize the so-called area
operator, as a geometrical operator, providing a discrete spectrum for the latter with
the smallest possible non-zero value given by the order of the Planck length squared:

providing a granular structure of space, is a major and beautiful prediction of the
theory.
In Sect. 1.9.1, a time-slicing approach of spacetime is formalized which even-
tually leads to develop loop quantum gravity within a three-dimensional geometry,
where a time coordinate becomes an irrelevant variable. The concept of a grav-
itational ﬁeld in the language of loop quantum gravity, as one of the Ashtekar
variables, is introduced in Sect. 1.9.2, and the concept of a holonomy and some
of its basic properties are established in Sect. 1.9.3, which involves the second
Ashtekar variable—the connection. Via the quantization of the gravitational ﬁeld,
the concept of an area in the 3D space, as introduced in Sect. 1.9.2, is promoted
to a functional differential operator acting on functionals of the connection. Spin-
networks and spin-network states are introduced, and their intricacies are spelled
out, in Sect. 1.9.4. The discrete spectrum of the area operator, by developing in the
process an eigenvalue equation for it, is investigated in Sect. 1.9.5 establishing the
quantized nature of area measurements in space at small distances of the order of
the Plank length squared.
I will develop the subject matter in the simplest possible way, hoping that more
physics students who are ﬁnding it difﬁcult and beyond reach, would be exposed to
this beautiful and unique theory which I feel is essential. We concentrate on a “thin
slice” of the theory and refer the interested reader in more details, in the underlying
constraints of the theory, of detailed references, and of further developments to
Rovelli [50], Thiemann [62], Rovelli and Vidotto [51].
1.9.1
The ADM Formalism and Intricacies of the Underlying
Geometry
The ADM 74 formalism, also known as a 3C1 decomposition of spacetime, consists
of time slicing of spacetime, by introducing, in the process, a sequence of 3D spaces,
˙ labeled by a continuous coordinate t. Let ˙ denote such a space, to be introduced
in this formalism, labeled by a coordinate label t. We may deﬁne a time evolution
(time-like) vector t to specify the direction in which a time derivative is taken.
The temporal distance between such hypersurfaces, labeled by coordinates t and
t C d t, is denoted by N d t, and N is referred to as the “lapse”. Thus by introducing
a unit timelike vector n W nn D 1, perpendicular to the hypersurface ˙ labeled
by t, we may generate the following ﬁgure showing the same point P at different
times. The vector N in ˙, referred to as the “shift vector”, was introduced to move
from the point in question in ˙ to the point where the vector Nn is erected. By a
74ADM refers to Arnowitt, Deser and Misner [3].

Thus the interval is speciﬁed completely in terms of the metric75 qab of ˙, the lapse
N, and the shift vector Na (Fig. 1.7).
The ADM observation was that one may carry out tensor analysis of spatial
tensor ﬁelds on ˙t using the spatial metric qab, and this is unaffected by coordinate
choices at later times. The time coordinate variable t label then becomes irrelevant
in the underlying analysis. The lapse and the shift vector would tell us on how
a coordinate system may be continued as one moves away from the surface t D
const: .
Now we restrict the analysis to the three dimensional geometry in P with metric
qab. We may introduce triads e ia, where the indices a run over 1; 2; 3, with the indices
i; j; : : : denoting Euclidean space labelings, and write the metric qab, as

In the next section, we will see how the concept of the gravitation ﬁeld may
be introduced, as one of the key variables in the theory, and eventually introduce
the concept of holonomy.76 Thanks to the Ashtekar variables, introduced from the
subsequent analysis, the non-abelian gravitational ﬁeld character, in particular, is
reduced to a non-abelian Yang-Mills gauge ﬁeld one with an underlying SU.2/
gauge group in the “Loop Quantum Gravity” formulation.77

Gravitational “Electric” Flux Across a Surface in 3D

Consider a surface S in ˙ parametrized by a pair of variables (1; 2). When 2
is kept ﬁxed, and 1 is made to vary, one traces a curve with tangent having
components e ia.@x a=@1/  v i1 locally in a tangent plane. Similarly, when 1 is kept
ﬁxed, and 2 is made to vary, one traces a curve with tangent having components

As a further generalization, consider a curve  with no parts of it touching,
which crosses a surface S at several points as shown in Fig. 1.8b, then clearly by
partitioning S into very ﬁne cells so that at most one intersection occurs per cell, by
using (1.9.28) for each cell involving an intersection, and summing over these cells,
we obtain

Now we are ready to deﬁne the concept of spin networks, construct space itself
and derive formally a major result of loop quantum gravity.
1.9.4
Deﬁnition of Spin Networks, Spin Network States, States
of Geometry
To introduce the concept of “Spin Networks” and “Spin Network States”, we
introduce ﬁrst the terminology of a graph in this formalism. A graph G is a collection
of oriented curves, say,  1;  2; : : : ;  L, referred to as links, that may join only at
their end points. These end points are called nodes, or vertices and will be denoted
by N1; : : : ; NN. The number of lines meeting a given node is referred to as the
valence of the node and is necessarily non-zero. We associate spins j1; j2; : : : ; jL
with the L links which may take values in f1=2; 1; 3=2; : : :g. In Fig. 1.9, a simple
graph is shown involving three links with two three-valent nodes, and an n-valent
85We will not need actual explicit representations of the so-called Wigner type matrices RjŒA; h.
For details of Wigner matrices D. j / in the theory of angular-momentum & spin, in general, see
Manoukian [40].

nvalent node, with n lines impinging on it, with spins denoted generally by j1; j2; ; : : : ; jn
node, say Ni involving, by deﬁnition, n lines impinging on it, with spins denoted
generally by j1; j2; ; : : : ; jn.
In order to deﬁne spin network states, we have to combine these spins, and
most importantly, generate invariant, i.e., gauge invariant, states under SU.2/
transformations. To this end, a spin j may be described by a vector v. j /
m with 2j C 1
indices. Accordingly, when we combine n spins, we generate a vector space with
elements v. j1 ::: jn/
m1::: mn which we know from elementary quantum mechanics of addition
of (angular momenta) spins, may involve several total spins. Gauge invariance
implies to restrict to the subspace which is invariant under SU.2/ transformations,
referred to as the singlet space. For a trivalent node n D 3, one would then obviously
have the elementary restriction for the three spins: jj1  j2j 
 j3 
 j1 C j2.
In this case, we identify the single element v. j1 j2 j3/
m1m2 m3, simply with the Clebsch-
Gordan coefﬁcient h j1; m1I j2; m2 j j3; m3 i, up to a normalization factor.86 Such
vector elements (tensors) are referred to intertwiners. For a 4-valent node, and a
5-valent node, for example, one may represent the nodes with their lines impinging
on them as shown in Fig. 1.10 where one introduces so-called virtual links and
consider couplings of the spins at the resulting nodes 1 and 2 in case .a/, and at
nodes 1, 2, 3 in case .b/. That is, for these nodes, in such general cases, as well
as for n - valent nodes, they may be described as contractions of three-valent nodes.
These decompositions also show that the dimensions of the invariant vector spaces
may be greater than one.
The collection of all the links, with associated spins j`, the nodes, with associated
intertwiners vi of a given graph G , is referred to as a spin-network, represented by
(G ; j`; v i). A spin-network state, with connection  , or A, may be symbolically
represented by
 G
S Œ A  D ˝` R.j`/Œ A; h`  ˝i vi;
(1.9.32)
86Clebsch-Gordan coefﬁcients are proportional to so-called 3j symbols, see, e.g, Manoukian [40,
p. 289].

1.9
Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity
77
Fig. 1.10 A 4-valent node and a 5-valent node are shown, respectively, in parts (a) and (b). They
are expressed in terms of 3-valent nodes. The dashed lines denote virtual links and are introduced
so that contractions between nodes may, in general, be described as contractions between three-
valent nodes
deﬁned with appropriate contractions. The main thing to note here is that the
dependence of a spin-network state on the connection, arises from the dependence
of the spin j` irreducible matrix representations R. j`/Œ A; h `  of the holonomy of
the connection along the curves ` as explicitly displayed above. The action of the
operator b
E iŒ S  on these functionals have been spelled out in (1.9.31). Functionals
which depend on the connection through its holonomy are referred to as cylindrical
functionals.
Summarizing then, in reference to a graph G , a spin-network is deﬁned with
SU.2/ representations of spins associated with its links, and SU.2/ invariant tensors
attached to its nodes, referred to as intertwiners. We will see that the spin-network
states diagonalize the area operator. The quantum states of the geometry of space
are deﬁned as linear superpositions of spin-network states.
1.9.5
Quanta of Geometry
Here we set an eigenvalue equation for the area operator b
A Œ S  as obtained from the
expression in (1.9.8), with densitized triad E i a.x/ promoted to a quantum operator
b
E i a.x/ represented as a functional differential operator as given in (1.9.24) [see
also (1.9.32)].
A spin-network is shown below, with links intersecting some surfaces (repre-
sented by thinner lines in side views).

Classically, it looks continuous
Given a spin-network, let S be any surface such that no nodes of the spin-network
lie on it. Surfaces of this type are shown above. Since the links may join only at their
end points (at nodes), we may partition, the surface S into ﬁne cells Sk such that at
most one link intersects each cell. This allows us to use the limit of a Riemann
sum, as given in (1.9.8), and the explicit expression of the action of the operator

and it commutes with all the generators of the algebra. Here we have restored the
fundamental constants „; c. The sum is over all intersection points p, with the spin
of the corresponding link intersecting the surface being jp. This remarkable result
shows the quantization of area in units of the Planck length squared „GN=c3 
1066 cm2 as its smallest non-zero value. It is deﬁned by ultimate boundaries of
space itself at such microscopic distances. Obviously when there are no intersections
of the links with the surface,87 one gets zero—a hole in the quantum space. This
gives an interesting granular structure to space. It is important to emphasize that a
spin network is not embedded in space but deﬁnes space itself. Loops are generated
from links attached to nodes. Loop quantum gravity, unlike other approaches, offers
an intriguing description of space generated by such a set of loops with nothing else
in between (Fig. 1.11).
87For the situation when some of the nodes and/or nodes and links lie on the surface, the analysis
becomes quite involved, and we refer the reader for the underlying details to Rovelli [50, p. 254].

Summary
Let us recapitulate the basic points of this beautiful formalism of quantum gravity.
Although one has started from general relativity, and applied a time-slicing of
spacetime, one ended up with a theory quite far from its origin, but still retained
the very basic and desirable ingredient of background independence. The resulting
non-perturbative theory is an SU.2/ gauge theory. It involves a densitized triad E j b
obtained directly from the deﬁnition of area of a surface, and a connection  ia (or
Aia), which, through the expression of a holonomy, tells us how a spinor is parallel
transported along a curve, where A ia and E j b are canonical conjugate variables.
Here space is generated by the so-called spin networks, described by spin-network
states. A quantum state of space is given by a superposition of spin-network states.
The latter are also referred to as s-knots. A spin-network is a functional of the
connection. It is deﬁned in terms of a graph, its vertices, referred to as nodes, and a
collection of curves, referred to as its links. The latter are labeled by spins j, and may
join only at their end points at the nodes. Along, every link one introduces the spin -
j irreducible matrix representation of the holonomy of the SU.2/ connection along
the corresponding curve. On the other hand, the nodes are represented by tensors,
referred to as intertwiners, which are essentially contractions of Clebsch-Gordan
coefﬁcients. The spin-network states emerge by contracting the matrix elements
of the matrices of the various j-spins representations and the intertwiners resulting
in gauge invariant expressions. The spin-networks diagonalize the area operator
providing a discrete spectrum for the latter.
I have provided the simplest possible approach to this very interesting theory
and, as mentioned in the Introduction to this section on “Loop Quantum Gravity”,
we hope, as a result, more physics students will be able to beneﬁt from it. For more
intricate details, consistency and further developments, deﬁning other geometrical
objects, including the treatment of constraints in the theory, as well as studies of
the world-history of spin-networks and other applications, we refer the reader to
[50, 51, 62].

In varying pg with respect to g where g.x/ D det Œ g.x/ , we need to know
how to vary a determinant. This is explicitly used in Problem 1.3, and in obtaining

83
To investigate the nature of this second term on the right-hand side of (C-1.8),
we proceed as follows.
A totally anti-symmetric tensor of rank 5, i.e., having ﬁve indices, in four
dimensional spacetime, is necessarily zero due to the simple fact that at least two of
its indices must be equal. Now consider the part
•g R0R˛ˇ ;
in this expression, concentrating on the following ﬁve indices .;  0; ; ˛; ˇ/.
Suppressing the other indices in the just given part, we may, in turn, consider the
expression:

•g ˘ R0 ˘ ˘ R˛ˇ ˘ ˘

˛ˇ:
(C-1.10)
By interchanging in turn the index  0 with the other indices within the round
brackets, we may generate the expression

•g ˘ R0 ˘ ˘ R˛ˇ ˘ ˘  •g0 ˘ R ˘ ˘ R˛ˇ ˘ ˘  •g ˘ R0 ˘ ˘ R˛ˇ ˘ ˘


˛ˇ D 0;
(C-1.11)
where due to the anti-symmetry property of the multiplicative factor ˛ˇ, the
above must be equal to zero as indicated, since an antisymmetric tensor of rank 5
is zero as mentioned above. By re-inserting the suppressed ﬁxed indices, the above
equation leads, upon multiplying by g 0  , to
•g R  R˛ˇ  ˛ˇ   D g 0•g0 R R˛ˇ  ˛ˇ  

Appendix D: Invariant Products of Three Riemann Tensors
In this appendix we show that the invariant products of three Riemans tensors on the
mass shell, i.e., when R D 0 and hence also R D 0, are necessarily proportional
to the invariant
R R R:
(D-1.1)
At the very outset, we note the following:
(1) The condition R D 0 .R D 0/, and the anti-symmetry conditions of R
in the interchange  $  or of  $ , imply that in order to generate a non-
trivial, i.e., non-vanishing, invariant out a product of three Riemann, no two
indices within each of the Riemann tensors may be set equal.
(2) Exactly two indices must be common between any two of Riemann tensors in
the product. If four indices are common between two of the Riemann tensors
are common, no non-trivial invariant may be formed out of this scalar and the
third Riemann fourth rank tensor. If three indices are common between two
Riemann tensors, no non-trivial invariant may be constructed out of this second
rank tensor and the third Riemann fourth rank tensor. Similarly if only one index
is common between two of the Riemann tensors, no non-trivial invariant may be
constructed of this sixth rank tensor and the third Riemann fourth rank tensor.
Again we use the mass shell condition R D 0 .R D 0/.

Introduction to Quantum Gravity
To the above end, consider the invariant R   R  R , and concentrate on
the indices in R  ˘˘ R  ˘˘ R  ˘ ˘˘ , suppressing the other indices. Using the fact that
a totally anti-symmetric tensor with ﬁve indices must be zero in four dimensional
spacetime,90 we can construct the following totally anti-symmetric tensor in four
dimensions:

Inserting the remaining ﬁxed indices, for example, in R  ˘ ˘˘ , R  ˘ ˘˘ , we obtain
from the original expression R  , R  , which vanish on the mass shell. This
means that the second and third lines in the above equation do not contribute on the
mass shell. Similarly, within the ﬁrst pair of round brackets only the ﬁrst term gives
a non-zero contribution. Within the fourth pair of round brackets, only the second
and fourth terms are non-vanishing, and in the ﬁfth pair of round brackets, only the
third and the ﬁfth terms give non-zero contributions. All told, (D-1.10) implies that

(D-1.11)
which upon relabeling the indices on the right-hand side of the equation, and using
the elementary properties of the Riemann curvature tensor in (1.1.42), we obtain the
following identity

where in writing the fourth equality, we have relabeled the indices of the ﬁrst term,

mentioned. The above equation gives for the very last on its extreme right-hand side
the identity

establishing that the second invariant in (D-1.9) is proportional to the invariant in

The remarkable property of invariant products of three Riemann curvature
tensors, on the mass shell, being proportional to the invariant product in (D-1.1)
is a key identity in investigating the divergent part of quantum general relativity in
the two-loop contribution as discussed above within the text.91
Appendix E: Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy Formula
of a Black Hole
The Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy formula 92 was brieﬂy discussed in the introduc-
tion to this chapter. It relates the entropy of a Black Hole (BH) to the surface area
of the event horizon. It arises as a consequence of investigations by Hawking93
that a BH is a thermodynamic object, it radiates and has a temperature associated
with it.94 To ﬁnd its temperature of a BH, note that the so-called thermodynamic
partition function eˇH, in performing averages (by taking a trace), where H is the
91Identities similar to the one in (D-1.12), as follows from (D-1.10) on the mass shell, were derived
by different methods in [66].
92Bekenstein [14].
93Hawking [31, 32].
94Particle emission from a BH is formally explained through virtual pairs of particles created near
the horizon with one particle falling into the BH while the other becoming free outside the horizon.

Introduction to Quantum Gravity
Hamiltonian of a system,95 may be obtained from the time development unitary
operator e  i t H=„, by the substitution: t ! i„ˇ. The trace operation gives rise to a
periodicity condition on ˇ.
The inﬁnitesimal distance squared in Minkowski space, i.e., in ﬂat spacetime
is given by ds2 D  dx dx, with metric  D diagŒ 1; 1; 1; 1. For a
spherically symmetric (uncharged, non-rotating) body of mass M, for example, the
gravitational effect of the body causes a curvature of spacetime around it, which
amounts in replacing the line element squared by ds2 D g dxdx, where g is
the corresponding metric which takes this distortion into account. The line element
squared outside the body now takes the form

where the point r D RBH D 2 GNM=c2 at which the coefﬁcient of .dr/2 blows out
deﬁnes the radius of the BH, specifying the location of the horizon.96
The above metric is referred to as the Schwarzschild metric, and RBH is also
referred to as the Schwarzschild radius.

96For a pedestrian approach, this may be roughly inferred from Newton’s theory of gravitation that
the escape speed of a particle in the gravitational ﬁeld of a spherically symmetric massive body
of mass M, at a distance r, is obtained from the inequality v2=2  GNM=r < 0, and by formally
replacing v by the ultimate speed c gives for the critical radius RCRITICAL D 2 GN M=c2 such that
for r < RCRITICAL a particle cannot escape.

As mentioned earlier, the proportionality of entropy to the area rather than to the

Introduction to Supersymmetry
It is often stated that “Supersymmetry” is a theory with mathematical beauty.1 Well,
it is.2 Imposing, a priori, a symmetry in developing quantum ﬁeld theory interactions
is quite important in the sense that, together with the criterion of renormalizability,
it narrows down the type of interactions one was, a priori, set up to develop. New
physics may also arise from the requirement of the invariance of a theory under
some given symmetry. The discovery of the positron in Dirac’s work by insisting
the invariance of a quantum theory of the electron under Lorentz transformations,
as dictated by special relativity, is the classic example of one such a physical
consequence.3
Supersymmetry gives rise to symmetry transformations between fermions and
bosons. As such a unifying principle, it necessarily predicts the existence of new
particles, and gives rise to a complete symmetry between the known particles and
particles of opposite statistics, their superpartners, referred to in short as sparticles,
having the same masses, and unites them in symmetry multiplets, referred to as
supermultiplets, such that the number of degrees of freedom of the bosonic and
fermionic ones being equal.4 This will be spelled out in Sect. 2.5. Since no bosons
and fermions with equal masses are known at the present, this symmetry must be
broken spontaneously or may be made broken by the addition of supersymmetry
breaking terms to the initial Lagrangian density by making sure, in the process,
1It is worth remembering the famous statement made by Dirac in [12], in a different context, that
“A theory with mathematical beauty is more likely to be correct than an ugly one that ﬁts some
experimental data”.

4Here a degree of freedom is deﬁned as follows. A real scalar ﬁeld has one degree of freedom,
while a complex one has two, and a massive real ﬁeld of spin j > 0, has .2j C 1/ degrees of
freedom. A Dirac spinor has 2.2.1=2/ C 1/ degrees of freedom while a Majorana spinor has
.2.1=2/ C 1/.

Introduction to Supersymmetry
to preserve its renormalizabilty. The superpartners are expected to be heavier
than their particles counterparts, otherwise they would have been observed so far.
Supersymmetry is a theory with remarkable consequences and is the subject matter
of this chapter.
Although Nature is not necessarily supersymmetric, the imposition of such a
symmetry on a ﬁeld theory has turned out to have several advantages over its non-
supersymmetric counterpart many of which will be discussed later. For one thing, it
puts restrictions on the relation between the various couplings in a theory and also
improves, in general, the situation encountered in the basic divergence problem of
quantum ﬁeld theory. The uniﬁcation of the gauge couplings of a supersymmetric
version at high energies, also elaborated on it further below, is also more precise.
As we will also see, supersymmetric theories have the very desirable property of
having Hamiltonians with non-negative spectra.
By extending Minkowski space, supersymmetry may be elegantly formulated in
superspace (Sect. 2.1), where one introduces, in the process, a Majorana spinor5
, that is, a spinor which satisﬁes the relation  D C 
>, where C is the charge
conjugation matrix,6 and  D  0. The spinor  D .a/, with a denoting a spinor
index, gives rise to fermionic degrees of freedom which are included together with
those provided by the coordinates x, thus deﬁning generalized coordinate labels
.x; a/ in a mathematical description of superspace. The latter variables satisfy the
basic relations Œ x; a  D 0; fa; bg D 0. Supersymmetry transformations may
be introduced by deﬁning a unitary operator which for inﬁnitesimal transformations
takes the form
U D 1 C i •ϵaQa;
Q D Q>C 1;
•ϵ Q D Q •ϵ;
(2.1)
with C denoting the charge conjugation matrix, where the parameter ϵ is a Majorana
spinor, and Q is referred to as the supercharge operator. Here we note how the need
of a generator of fermionic type naturally arises, carrying a spinorial index, in order
to describe transformations between ﬁelds of particles of half-odd integer spins, the
fermions, and ﬁelds of particles of integer spins, the bosons, and vice versa.7
The operators Q; Q allow one to move within a supermultiplet involving bosonic
and fermionic particles (Sect. 2.5) implementing, in the process, transformations
between states differing by half-odd integer spins, relating states corresponding to
different statistics. The fact that supersymmetry transformations lead to changes of
5The components of which are anti-commuting referred to as Grassmann variables. The nature of
this additional variable (parameter) and relevant details to it will be exploited in detail in Sects. 2.1–
2.5.
6See Appendix II at the end of the book to see how the charge conjugation matrix arises.
7An earlier analysis by Coleman and Mandula [7] implied that, under some underlying conditions,
an extension of the Poincaré algebra was not possible if one restricts the new generators to be
of bosonic types, in the sense that these additional bosonic generators simply commute with
(i.e., decouple from) all the familiar generators of the Poincaré ones in Sect. 4.2 in Chap. 4 of
Vol. I. A fairly detailed and lucid treatment of this is given in [41, pp. 12–22].

spin, changing in turn the statistics of a state, means quantum mechanically that a
supercharge operator does not commute with spin: Œ Qa; J  ¤ 0. Accordingly, the
explicit derivation (Sect. 2.5) of this commutator is important as it embodies a key
result in supersymmetry. Since the masses in a given supermultiplet are equal, this
means quantum mechanically that Œ Qa; Mass2  D 0.
The super-Poincaré algebra involves anti-commutators, in addition to commuta-
tors, and the underlying algebra is referred to as a graded algebra. In particular, it is
shown in (2.5.28) for b D a, with a sum over a, that

That is, the spectrum of a supersymmetric theory is non-negative. In particular, we
note from this equation, that if the vacuum jvaci is invariant under a supergauge
transformation, as it should be in a supersymmetric theory, i.e., Qajvaci D 0 for all
a, then the vacuum energy is zero: hvacjHjvaci D 0.
On the other hand, if, say there is a ﬁeld  with inﬁnitesimal supersymmetry
transformation • D
Œ; •ϵQ=i, such that the vacuum expectation value of the
latter does not vanish, i.e.,
0 ¤ i hvacj•jvaci D hvacj•ϵQjvaci  hvacj.Q 0/•ϵjvaci;
(2.4)
where we have used the relations •ϵ Q D Q •ϵ, Q D Q 0, we must obviously
have Qajvaci ¤ 0, for at least an a, otherwise an equality to zero for all a
will be inconsistent with the non-vanishing of the vacuum expectation value of
• above. The non-vanishing property Qajvaci ¤ 0, for an a, implies that the
vacuum is not invariant under supersymmetry transformations and symmetry is said
to be spontaneously broken. This in turn implies that for spontaneously broken
supersymmetry, the vacuum energy satisﬁes the inequality hvacjHjvaci > 0, i.e.,
it is strictly positive, since hvacjQ
aQajvaci > 0, at least for an a. The situation is
summarized in Fig. 2.1.
Unlike other discoveries, supersymmetry was not, a priori, invented under pres-
sure set by experiments and was a highly intellectual achievement. Theoretically,
however, it quickly turned out to be quite important in further developments of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory. Elaborating on what was mentioned earlier, in a supersymmetric
extension of the standard model, the electroweak and strong effective couplings do
merge at energies about 1016 GeV, signalling the possibility that these interactions
are different manifestations of a single force in support of a grand uniﬁed theory of
the fundamental interactions. Also gravitational effects are expected to be important

b allow one to move within a supermuliplet, and if they do not annihilate a state,
they generate states with spins differing by ˙1=2. The latter implies that the commutator of the
supercharge operator and spin does not vanish. The non-vanishing of the vacuum expectation value
of a (scalar) ﬁeld leads to spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Note that if hvacj•jvaci /

value of the scalar ﬁeld is in question here
at the quantum level at the Planck energy of the order 1019 GeV, or possibly at
even lower energies, giving the hope of a uniﬁed theory of the four fundamental
interactions at high energies.
The enormous mass difference between the electroweak scale  10 2 GeV and
all the way up to a grand uniﬁcation scale  1015 GeV, referred to as the hierarchy
problem, should be of concern, as it is such an enormous shift in energy scale
providing no hint as to what happens to the physics in between. In the standard
model,8 the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson sets the scale for the
masses in the theory, such as for the masses of the vector bosons. The masses
imparted to the initially massless vector bosons in the theory, for example, via the
Higgs mechanism, using the parameters in the Lagrangian density, i.e., at the tree
level, are in very good agreement with experimental results. On the other hand, if
one introduces a large energy scale cut-off   1015 GeV, of the order of a grand
uniﬁed energy scale, or the Planck energy scale   1019 GeV, at which gravitation
may play a signiﬁcant role, to compute the shift of the squared-mass of the Higgs
boson (a scalar particle) due to radiative corrections, it turns out to be quadratic9
in , which is quite large for such a large cut-off. This requires that the bare mass
squared of the Higgs boson to be correspondingly large to cancel such a quadratic
dependence on  and obtain a physical mass of the Higgs boson of the order of
magnitude of the minute energy10 . 102 GeV/, in comparison, characterizing the
standard model, and this seems quite unnatural for the cancelation of such huge
quantities. The question, in turn, arises as what amounts for the enormous difference

between the energy scale of grand uniﬁcation and the energy scale that characterizes
the standard model. This unnatural cancelation of enormously large numbers has
been termed a facet of the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetric theories have, in
general, the tendency to cancel out such quadratic divergences, up to possibly of
divergences of logarithmic type which are tolerable, thus protecting a scalar particle
from acquiring such a large bare mass. So supersymmetry may have an important
role to play here.
The name “Supersymmetry” for this symmetry is attributed to Salam and
Strathdee as it ﬁrst appears in the title of one of their papers [30]. The extension
of the algebra of the Poincaré group to a superalgebra was ﬁrst carried out by
Gol’fand and Likhtman in [19] to construct supersymmetric ﬁeld theory models,
and with the implementation of spontaneous symmetry breaking by Volkov and
Akulov in [40]. In 1974,11 Wess and Zumino independently,12 also developed
supersymmetric models in 4 dimensions, and this work has led to an avalanche
of papers on the subject and to a rapid development of the theory. In particular,
supersymmetric extensions of the standard model were developed,13 supergravity,
as a supersymmetric extension of gravitational theory, was also developed.14 Color
conﬁnement, within supersymmetric settings, were also analysed.15 Of particular
interest was also the development of the superspace concept as an extension of the
Minkowski one, with generalized coordinates .x ; a/ as mentioned earlier. From
the superspace concept, one then conveniently sets up SUSY invariant integrals as
in deﬁning supersymmetric actions (Sect. 2.4) needed in developing supersymmetric
ﬁeld theories.16
As generalizations of ordinary ﬁelds, one may introduce instead so-called
superﬁelds to develop supersymmetric theories. These ﬁelds are functions of
superspace variables .t; x; / instead of just the spacetime ones .t; x/, and, as
ordinary ﬁelds, they may carry vector, spinor, and other indices. The main task in
gauge theories, is to develop supersymmetric extension of Yang-Mills ﬁeld theories,
where the Yang-Mills ﬁeld is a non-abelian vector gauge ﬁeld. Accordingly, it is
interesting to introduce a pure vector superﬁeld. That is, a superﬁeld for which its
-independent part is an ordinary (Lorentz) vector ﬁeld and hence the adjective
“pure”.17 Surprisingly, an explicit expression of the pure vector superﬁeld has
been only recently derived [25]. One usually constructs supersymmetric extensions
11Wess and Zumino [42].

15See Seiberg and Witten [35].

17Pure vector superﬁeld is not to be confused with so-called “vector” superﬁelds, given the
unfortunate name vector superﬁelds, which are real scalar superﬁelds depending on vector ﬁelds:
see, e.g. [2, p. 56], [41, p. 117], [3, p. 81]. They are sometimes referred to as scalar (vector)
superﬁelds.

of Yang-Mills vector ﬁeld theories, however, by introducing and using a spinor
superﬁeld to do so.18
Things are not much better for supergravity, as far as its renormalizability is
concerned. Unlike GR, however, non-renormalizability of supergravity is revealed
by necessarily going even to higher order loops in the theory.19
Superspace and the super-Poincaré transformations, and their group properties,
generalizing the Poincaré ones, is the subject matter of Sect. 2.1. Basic properties
of the Grassmann variable a are spelled out in Sect. 2.2. Superdifferentiation and
superintegrations are treated, respectively, in Sects. 2.3 and 2.4. Derivations of the
fundamental anti-commutators/commutators of the super-Poincaré algebra as well
as the spelling out the nature of the supermultiplets are given in Sect. 2.5. Superﬁelds
are generated in Sect. 2.6. Various supersymmetric ﬁeld theories are developed
in Sects. 2.7–2.9, with the supersymmetric gauge theories ones in Sect. 2.12. The
removal of the so-called quadratic divergence associated with the self-energy of
a scalar particle in a supersymmetric setting is exploited in Sect. 2.10 as it is
critical in supersymmetry. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is treated in Sect. 2.11.
Incorporation of supersymmetry in the standard model and the study of the
fascinating subject of the uniﬁcation of the gauge coupling constants as a much
improvement over the one obtained for the non-supersymmetric one is given in
Sect. 2.13. The local version of supersymmetry, where transformations between
bosonic and fermion ﬁelds depend on the spacetime dependent parameter ϵ.x/, that
is at which point x of spacetime we are, is called supergravity and is an immediate
generalization of general relativity with an underlying structure of spacetime. This
occupies us in the last three sections of this chapter, where the full pure supergravity,
including its underlying geometrical aspects, are derived culminating in Sect. 2.16.
We consider theories with only one spinor supercharge .Qa/, with four compo-
nents, corresponding to ones referred to as N D 1 (simple) supersymmetric ﬁeld
theories. With the very basics knowledge acquired by the reader of supersymmetry
in this chapter, he or she may consult more advanced treatments for additional
details and further developments of this fascinating subject.
2.1
Superspace: Arena of Sparticles—Particles
As discussed in the introduction to the chapter, to describe transformations between
particles of half-odd integer spins, the fermions, and particles of integer spins, the
bosons, one introduces a generator (generators) which necessarily carry a spinorial
18See [2, p. 74]), [41, p. 124]), [3, p. 92], [41], Weinberg in his monumental work on supersymme-
try, on p. 124, line 13 from below, states that it is rather surprising that the need of a spinor ﬁeld
arises in such a case.
19See, e.g., [8, 9, 21, 36, 37]. Here we are referring to the case of D D 4 dimensions with one
(N D 1) supersymmetry charge operator in the theory. For supersymmetric extensions (i.e., for
1  N  8) and arbitrary dimensions (4  D  11) of the theory, see these references on the
renormalizability problems of such extensions.

index. Accordingly, to accommodate such a symmetry, in a spacetime description
as an extension of the Minkowski spacetime, one may introduce a four component
spinor .a/, which commutes with the spacetime variable x, as an additional
coordinate tied together with x  in a way similar the time variable x 0 is tied
together with those of the space ones x in special relativity. The resulting space
with coordinates labels .x ; a/ is referred to as superspace. Supersymmetry is a
spacetime symmetry. By the extension of Minkowski spacetime to superspace, we
will, in later sections, develop supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.
Before discussing on how this spinor  is tied together with the spacetime
coordinate x, we note that the spinor  is chosen as a Majorana spinor with anti-
commuting components and, as mentioned above, that commute with x:

on the so-called superﬁelds and on particle supermultiplets. Next we derive basic
properties involving products of components of the spinor  and related summation
formulae needed in developing supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.

(2.2.12)
The coefﬁcients c1; c2; c3 are easily obtained by multiplying, in turn, by ıab, by

For further applications, we use the notation B for the matrices I;  5;  5, and
rewrite (2.2.12) in the more elegant form, after multiplying it by Cbc, using in the

Superderivatives and Products of Superderivatives
The next step needed in working in superspace is to see how the concept of a
derivative is generalized in this case. In Sect. 2.1, we have seen that a Majorana
spinor , with anti-commuting four components, is tied together with the spacetime
coordinate x and commutes with it, and the resulting space with coordinate labels
.x; a/ is referred to as superspace. Clearly a covariant derivative and the consistent
transformation rule for it in superspace must involve both x and  or , which we
now consider.
We ﬁrst recall with the rules developed for differentiation with respect to
Grassmann variables in Sect. 2.4 in Chap. 1 of Vol. I, that for any matrix A involving
product of gamma matrices we have . D C 

On the other hand, from the second identity in (2.1.9), K 0 D  0K1. Accord-

in (2.2.2), (2.2.3), the following two equalities are easily derived in Problem 2.8:

Invariant Integration in Superspace
The ﬁrst step in developing integration theory in superspace, one has to investigate
the nature of the volume element

(2.4.1)
under the Super-Poincaré Transformation in (2.1.10), (2.1.11) in superspace, in
analogy to the volume element .dx/ under the Lorentz transformation in Minkowski
spacetime. That is, given a scalar (super)ﬁeld ˚.x; / deﬁned by the condition
˚0.x 0;  0/ D ˚.x; /;
(2.4.2)
we have to investigate the meaning of an integral such as
Z

(2.4.3)
as an invariant integral in superspace. This is the essence of deﬁning invariant
actions in superspace as the ﬁrst step in developing supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.
Before doing this, let us see how one carries integrations with respect to
Grassmann variables. Assuming the translational invariance of an integral, say with

The elements of the matrices , K are c-numbers, while those in T are Grassmann
ones, that is anti-commuting but commuting with those in , K.
Remark Since the variables x, a are tied down together in a super-Lorentz
transformation, it would be not only naïve but incorrect to say that under such
a transformation, dx 0 D   dx, (in superspace, dx  has a more complicated

commuting variables (x ) and anti-commuting26 ones (a). We will see that due
to the presence of anti-commuting elements in the matrix in (2.4.17), one has to
re-deﬁne the concept of a determinant and the trace of such matrices and we end
up, nevertheless, obtain exactly the just mentioned expression for the Jacobian of
transformation.
When a matrix such as the one in (2.4.17) involves Grassmann variables, the
basic property det M1M2 D detM1 detM2, indeed breaks down for two such matrices
M1; M2. The presence of the Grassmann variables in (2.4.17) will, self consistently
allow us to extend the deﬁnition of a determinant as well as of the trace for such
supermatrices and the corresponding operations will be denoted, respectively, by
Sdet and STr.

The elements of the matrices A and B are c-numbers, while those in  are anti-

For a matrix X D exp A, with c-number elements, one has the useful identity
det X D exp Tr A. We now deﬁne supermatrices M1 D exp V1, M 2 D exp V2, and
for the superdeterminant of the product of two supermatrices, we must have
Sdet Mi D exp STr Vi;
Sdet .M1 M2/ D exp STr .V1 C V2/:

Introduction to Supersymmetry
By using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion, we may write for the left-
hand side of the second expression in the above equation
Sdet .M1 M2/ D exp STr

V1 C V2 C 1
2Œ V1; V2  C   
	
;
(2.4.23)
and every term beyond V1 C V2 has the structure of the commutator of two matrices
such as V1 and V2. According to the equality in the second equation in (2.4.22), the
STr of any two such matrices V1 and V2 must vanish.
From (2.4.8), one explicitly has
Œ V1; V2  D

ŒA1; A2 C 1 2  21
.A12  A21 C 1B2  2B1

ŒB1; B2 C 12   21
	
:
(2.4.24)
We note that in reference to the matrices on the diagonal of the commutator
Œ V1; V2 , we always have Tr ŒA1; A2 D 0 D Tr ŒB1; B2. On the other hand for the
matrices 1; 2; 1; 2 with anti-commuting elements, the following equality for the
traces hold
Tr .1 2  21/ D Tr .12   21/:
(2.4.25)
Thus we learn that the commutator of any two matrices of the type given
in (2.4.21), not only has the same structure as the type just mentioned, but also
the ordinary traces of the two matrices on the diagonal are equal. This applies to
every single term appearing in the exponential in (2.4.23) beyond the .V1 C V2/
term, being the commutator of two such matrices. Accordingly, for a general matrix
V as given in (2.4.21), in order to satisfy the condition (2.4.22), one deﬁnes the
supertrace
STr
A 
 B
	
D Tr A  Tr B;
(2.4.26)
with opposite relative signs, where Tr denotes the ordinary trace, and all the terms
in the exponential in (2.4.23), beyond that .V1 C V2/, will automatically vanish, due
to equalities as the one in (2.4.25).
The basic property embodied in this consistent deﬁnition of a determinant, now
extended to supermatrices M1; M2 in (2.4.22), will be then satisﬁed as follows
Sdet M1M2 D Sdet M1 Sdet M2:

and (2.4.22) holds true on account that the trace of the commutator of any two
matrices is zero.
Upon using the result in (2.4.26) for the matrix M in question in (2.4.17),(2.4.18),
by noting, in the process, that

(2.4.29)
and similarly for the matrix K, we obtain
Sdet M D det 
det K :
(2.4.30)
For Lorentz transformations, including 3D spatial rotations, det  D 1. This
also true for the matrix K implementing Lorentz transformations of spinors, that
det K D 1, thus establishing the invariance of the volume element in (2.4.1) in
superspace.
Consider two matrices ; , with elements of Grassmann type, and a matrix C,
with c-number elements, whose inverse exists, which give rise to a matrix  C1
with c-number elements. Quite generally, it is shown in Problem 2.13 that the
superdeterminant of an arbitrary matrix of the type Y, in the following equation,
is consistently given by
Sdet Y D Sdet

det.D  C1/;
(2.4.31)
provided the expression on the right-hand side of the equation exists,27 where D is
a matrix with c-number elements.
The above analysis establishes the invariance of the integral (2.4.3) in superspace.
Since the components of  may be written as a linear combination of the
components of , and due to the nature of the Grassmann character of these
components, we may spell out, in detail, the general structure of a scalar superﬁeld

Super-Poincaré Algebra and Supermultiplets
Supersymmetry transformations are carried out via generators, associated with
unitary operators, acting on particle states, and carry spinor indices and hence
are of fermionic type. These generators together with the ones of the Poncaré
transformations satisfy a new algebra, referred to as the Super-Poincaré Algebra,
involving commutators as well as anti-commutators. We consider theories with only
one supersymmetry generator as a spinor with four components corresponding to
ones referred to as N D 1 (simple) supersymmetric ﬁeld theories.
The mere fact that the supercharge operator, as will be derived below, does not
commute with the angular momentum operator necessarily implies that the particle
supermultiplets, associated with this algebra, involve particles with different spins
and hence the derivation of the commutator in question is of importance. The
fermionic character of the supersymmetric generator, as witnessed by working,
in particular, with Grassmann variables, shows also that the number of particles
in a supermultiplet are ﬁnite in number. Below we derive the details of this
algebra and investigate the nature of supermultiplets associated with these symmetry
transformations. The reader is advised to review ﬁrst the content of Sect. 2.1 on
superspace as well the section on the Poincaré Algebra in Sect. 4.2 in Vol. I [26].
In superspace, coordinates are labeled by .x; a/, where  is a Majorana spinor
with anti-commuting components which commute with x. For a supersymmetry
transformation, not involving Lorentz transformations and spatial rotations, the
transformation rule x;  ! x 0;  0, including translations, is deﬁned by [see (2.1.3),
(2.1.4)]
x 0 D x C i
2 ϵ    b;
(2.5.1)
 0 D  C ϵ;
(2.5.2)
and a Super-Poincaré Transformation, which involves Lorentz transformations and
spatial rotations, is deﬁned by [see (2.1.10), (2.1.11)]
x 0 D  x C i

with both sets written in convenient matrix notations. K denotes the spinor-
Dirac representation (Sect. 2.4 in Vol. I, Sect. 2.1) of a Lorentz group. In the
transformation rules (2.5.1)–(2.1.4), the spinor .a/ is tied together with the
spacetime coordinate .x / in a way similar that x 0 is tied together with x i in
special relativity. The transformation rules are also linear in .x ; a/. We consider
inﬁnitesimal transformations via a generator G spelled out in (2.5.5), (2.5.15) below,
which results from considering inﬁnitesimal transformations around a closed path
represented pictorially by
emphasizing the reversal of the transformations in the third and the fourth segments
of the path, described by successive unitary transformations U1

Uj D 1 C i Gj for inﬁnitesimal transformations.
For additional clarity we consider the simple supersymmetry transformations
in (2.5.1), (2.5.2) ﬁrst before tackling the ones in (2.5.3), (2.5.4). To this end, the
generator of the corresponding transformation on operators and particle states is
deﬁned by
G D • bP C • ϵa Qa;
(2.5.5)
where P is the energy-momentum operator and the Qa denote the components
of the spinor generator of supersymmetry, and is deﬁned to satisfy Q D C Q
>,
Q D .Q/ 0. The latter as well as • ϵ are taken as Majorana spinors which guaranty,
in particular, the Hermiticity of the generator G on account of the easily derived
property
• ϵa Qa D Qa • ϵa;
(2.5.6)
where the parameters ϵa and their variations anti-commute with the operators Qa.
As mentioned above, we consider inﬁnitesimal transformations forming a closed
path described by
.ϵ2; b2/1.ϵ1; b1/1.ϵ2; b2/.ϵ1; b1/ D .ϵ; b/;

For the subsequent analysis, we replace the expressions for the generators, G1,
G2, G, by their corresponding expressions given in (2.5.5) into (2.5.8), with G, for
example, deﬁned in (2.5.5), use the parametric relations in (2.5.9), (2.5.10), and note
that
Œ •ϵ1 a Qa; •ϵ2 b Qb  D  •ϵ1 a•ϵ2 b fQa; Qbg;

involve particles with different spins. This we consider next.

the following. For a given unit vector n, set

Introduction to Supersymmetry
We may, therefore, introduce new normalized spin states
j j; i0 D A
1 A
2 j j; i ;
(2.5.41)
orthogonal to the states j j; i as a consequence of the fact that the latter is
annihilated by Aa.
Clearly, the non-vanishing states A
1 jj; i, A
2 jj; i, jj; i, jj; i0, are mutually
orthogonal. On the other hand, by referring to the third equation in (2.5.33),
involving the operators A
1; A
2, we note that J C =2 represents the addition of two
angular momenta one of which corresponds to spin 1/2. Hence we may conclude that
for j > 0, a massive supermultiplet contains also states of spin j˙1=2 with all of the
corresponding particles having the same mass. Due to the Grassmann property of
the spinor generators .A]
a/2 D 0, and the anti-commutation relations in (2.5.34),
no other states may be constructed by the applications of these generators and
their products on the already obtained states above as they would either be zero
or proportional to the pre-existing ones.
In particular, for a given j > 0 we have learnt that there are two sates with
spin j. These states will correspond to bosonic or fermionic degrees of freedom,
depending whether j is an integer or a half-odd integer, respectively. An elegant
way of determining the number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in a
supermultiplet is obtained in the following manner.
Since from (2.5.23), ŒP; Q
a  D 0, every particle in a supermultiplet has the same
momentum, say, p, and same mass, say, m. Suppose that p D jp j.0; 0; 1/. Also

respectively. Hence we learn that the number bosonic degrees of freedom is equal
to the fermionic ones. For example for a given j, say j D 1=2, the above analysis
shows that we have a supermultiplet with two 1=2 spins with 2

fermionic degrees of freedom, one spin 1 of 3 degrees of freedom and one spin 0

and one of spin 1/2 with two degrees of freedom.

Introduction to Supersymmetry
Hence another state in the supermultiplet would be given by B1jE; Ni D jE; N 
1=2i. Also, .B1/2 D 0, implies that B1jE; N  1=2i D 0. That is, a massless
supermuliplet contains just the two states
ˇˇE; N

and
ˇˇE; N  1=2

. On the other
hand, CPT invariance implies the existence also of its anti-supermultiplet consisting
just of the states
ˇˇE; N

and
ˇˇE; N C 1=2

of opposite helicities. For example the
superpartner of the photon, called the photino, is a massless fermion, of helicities
˙ 1=2, and that of the graviton, the superpartner, called the gravitino, is a fermion,
a Rarita-Schwinger massless particle, of helicities ˙ 3=2. The photon and the
graviton being so-called gauge ﬁelds, their superpartners are also each referred to as
gauginos. In general supermultiplets with N D 1=2; 1 are referred to as chiral and
vector supermultiplets, respectively.
It is important to reiterate, in closing, that the second commutation rule
in (2.5.23) implies that all the particles within a supermultiplet have the same
masses, for both cases with massive or massless particles.

A Panorama of Superﬁelds
To develop supersymmetric ﬁeld theories, we introduce so-called superﬁelds deﬁned
on superspace, that is, functions of .x; a/ with the latter specifying points in
superspace (Sects. 2.1 and 2.4). One would then write a Lagrangian in terms of these
ﬁelds and eventually obtain supersymmetric actions to describe the dynamics of the
underlying particles and sparticles. We work exclusively in the chiral representation
of the Dirac matrices29 in which  5 is diagonal.
We recall that  is a Majorana spinor with anti-commuting components, which,
in turn, commute with x . That is,
 D C  >;
 D  >C 1;

where C is the charge conjugation matrix. Some pertinent equations, as given in
Sect. 2.2, that will be needed and used repeatedly in this section, are, conveniently,
summarized in Box 2.1.

We here introduce several superﬁelds together with some of their basic properties
and relegate the relevant technical details of investigations to their respective
subsections that follow. This makes the reading on this necessarily detailed study
much easier. Needless to say these subsections form an integral part of this section

Introduction to Supersymmetry
Here A.x/; B.x/; G.x/; D.x/ are Lorentz scalars, V.x/ is a Lorentz vector, and
 .x/; .x/ are spinors,  D @@. The numerical coefﬁcients in this expansion, as
well as the coefﬁcients of  5  and . 5/2, expressed in the above forms, are
written for convenience. One may, of course, absorb the numerical coefﬁcients in
the ﬁelds and introduce other symbols for the coefﬁcients just mentioned at the cost
of complicating the algebra and the interpretation that follows from the analysis. In
particular, it is important to emphasize that the  independent part A.x/ of the above
expression is a Lorentz scalar.
The supersymmetry transformations between spinor and boson ﬁeld com-
ponents arise in the following manner. For a supersymmetric transformation
(see (2.1.10)/(2.1.11), expressed in terms of ϵ with b D 0)

of the expressions obtained from both sides of (2.6.4), as applied to the explicit

also (2.2.20)–(2.2.28)), the following supersymmetry transformations between the

It is interesting to note that •D, as given in (2.6.11), is a total derivative. This point
is of great signiﬁcance and we will come back to it shortly.
The product of scalar superﬁelds is also a scalar superﬁelds. That is, in the above
notation,
˚1.x; / ˚ 2.x; / D ˚.x; /;
(2.6.12)
where the components ﬁelds of ˚.x; / are expressed in terms of the component
ﬁelds of ˚1.x; /, ˚ 2.x; /, and are spelled out in Sect. 2.6.1 below.
The importance of the scalar superﬁeld stems from the following. A scalar super-
ﬁeld ˚.x; / implies that the following integral is invariant under supersymmetry
transformations (see Sect. 2.4)
Z
.dx/.d/ ˚.x; / D invariant;
.dx/ D dx 0dx1dx 2dx 3; .d/ D d1d 2d3d4:
(2.6.13)
From the theory of integrations over Grassmann variables (Sect. 2.4) the only
contribution to the above integral comes from the last term in (2.6.2) involving the
factor .5/2 having four s. As a matter of fact from (2.2.28), we have explicitly
4321 D 1

(2.6.14)
and from (2.6.2), the above integral becomes

(2.6.15)
This provides the starting point to generate supersymmetric actions, with D.x/
real (Hermitian). In this respect, since A.x/ D @.@A.x// is a total differential,
the last term in (2.6.15), may be then omitted under the integral sign, leading
from (2.6.15) to

up to a surface integral, providing an explicit demonstration that the integral
in (2.6.16), corresponding to the D term of the scalar superﬁeld is invariant under a
supersymmetric transformation, and hence suitable candidate for a supersymmetric
action. For additional details concerning the scalar superﬁeld see Sect. 2.6.1 below.
In particular, it is shown in (2.6.80)–(2.6.86), that the product of scalar superﬁelds
is also a scalar superﬁeld.
Obviously, one cannot arbitrarily set some of the ﬁelds of the superﬁeld ˚.x; /
equal to zero since, according to (2.6.5)–(2.6.11), these ﬁeld components transform
between themselves. The ﬁeld ˚.x; / in (2.6.2) is, however, reducible, in the sense
that a subset of the ﬁeld components may be selected which transform among
themselves. This leads us next to discuss another set of superﬁelds.
Chiral Superﬁelds
We have just mentioned that the scalar superﬁeld ˚ is reducible. That is, one
may select a subset of its ﬁelds which transform among themselves. To this end, we
ﬁrst deﬁne the left-chiral and right-chiral ﬁelds as follows
 D  L C  R;
 L 
1   5
2
	
 ;
 R 
1 C  5
2
	
 ;
(2.6.18)
where  L,  R are referred to as left-chiral and right-chiral spinors, which may have,
respectively, only two upper and only two lower non-vanishing components. Recall
that in the chiral representation  5 is diagonal. Note that  5 L=R D   L=R.
In reference to (2.6.5)–(2.6.11), we set
 D 0;
D D 0;
i V D @ A;
i G D B  i F;
 R D 0;
(2.6.19)
and obtain a closed system of transformation of ﬁelds among themselves:
• L D i FϵL  @ϵRA;
(2.6.20)
•F D ϵ @  L;
(2.6.21)
•A D i ϵ  L;
(2.6.22)
thus generating a left-chiral superﬁeld deﬁned by

Here  is a Majorana spinor, and  L  .I   5/ =2 is its left-handed part, which
is the reason why this scalar superﬁeld is called a left-chiral superﬁeld.
Here we may pose to note that the last term in the expression in (2.6.23) is a total
derivative and hence its integral over superspace is zero (up to the total differential
contribution). The F term in it, however, is quite important in generating action
integrals for the following reason. Since  D  L C  R, accordingly, we have the
following integral [see also (2.4.25)–(2.4.31)]

R

components of  R by  3; 4, ı.2/. R/ D 43. We have also used the fact that
 L D >C 1 1   5
2
 D 1 2 C  21 D 2  21:
(2.6.25)
Since under a supersymmetry transformation, •F is a total differential, as seen
in (2.6.21), we learn that the integral in (2.6.24) corresponding to the F term of the
left-chiral superﬁeld in (2.6.23) is invariant under a supersymmetry transformation
up to a total differential in the integrand. On the other hand the D part of the left-
chiral ﬁeld (2.6.23), involving  A D @.@A/, is a total derivative and is thus not
interesting in setting up Lagrangian densities.
The expression of this ﬁeld in (2.6.23) may be simpliﬁed by introducing, in the
process, the variable
Ox D x C i
4  5;
(2.6.26)
leading to the following simple expression for the left-chiral superﬁeld
˚ L.x; / D A.Ox/ C i  L.Ox/ C 1
2  L F.Ox/;
(2.6.27)
as shown in Sect. 2.6.2 below. It is interesting to note that if one deﬁnes right-hand
and left-hand superderivatives by
DR=L  1 ˙  5
2
D;
then
DR˚L.x; / D 0:
(2.6.28)
That is, the right-hand superderivative annihilates a left-chiral superﬁeld. The latter
is often taken as the deﬁnition of a left-chiral superﬁeld.

132

Introduction to Supersymmetry
We may, in turn, generate a right-chiral superﬁeld as follows. In reference
to (2.6.5)–(2.6.11), we set
 D 0;
D D 0;
i V D  @ A;
i G D B  i F;
 L D 0;
(2.6.29)
where, needless to say, F.x/, A.x/ may be chosen as new functions. We obtain a
closed system of transformation of ﬁelds among themselves:
• R D i FϵR C @ϵLA;
(2.6.30)
•F D  ϵ @ R;
(2.6.31)
• A D  i ϵ  R;
(2.6.32)
thus generating a right-chiral superﬁeld deﬁned by
˚ R.x; / D A.x/  i  R.x/ C 1
2  R F.x/  i
4  5 @A.x/
1
4  5 @ R.x/  1
32 . 5/2A.x/:
(2.6.33)
The above expression simpliﬁes, in turn, to
˚ R.x; / D A.Ox/  i  R.Ox/ C 1
2  R F.Ox/;
(2.6.34)
and
DL˚ R.x; / D 0;
(2.6.35)
as is easily checked, which is often taken as the deﬁnition of a right-chiral superﬁeld.
Using the fact, in the process of demonstration, that . L/ D  R, as a
consequence of the anti-commutativity of  0 and  5, we note that the Hermitian
conjugate of a left-chiral superﬁeld is given by
˚

(2.6.36)
where we have used the facts that . 5/ D  5, and the Majorana character
of the ﬁeld  : . L/ D  R, . L/ D  R. That is, the Hermitian
conjugate of a left-chiral superﬁeld is a right-chiral one (and vice versa). For details
leading to the properties of chiral ﬁelds above, see Sect. 2.6.2 below.
To generalize abelian and non-abelian gauge theories to their supersymmetric
counterparts, we need to introduce supersymmetric vector ﬁelds. This is done next.

(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds
A (scalar-) vector superﬁeld is deﬁned by imposing a reality condition on the
general scalar superﬁeld ˚.x; / D ˚.x; / in (2.6.2), which, for convenience,
will be written as
V .x; / D S.x/  i  5Q .x/ C i

(2.6.37)
Although this is a scalar superﬁeld, it is referred to as a (scalar-) vector superﬁeld,
and quite often, unfortunately, it is also referred to as a vector superﬁeld because it
includes the Lorentz vector V as a component ﬁeld. We ﬁrst consider the abelian
case.
(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds: Abelian Case
We note that in (2.6.37), S; B; G; D are (new) real Lorentz scalars, V is a real
Lorentz vector, and Q ;  are Majorana spinors.
In analogy to ordinary gauge transformations, we deﬁne a supergauge transfor-
mation of, say, a left-chiral superﬁeld as follows:
˚ L.x; / ! e i e .x;/˚ L.x; /;
(2.6.38)
where .x; / is a classical left-chiral superﬁeld, with general structure that will
be given in (2.6.97) below, which may be referred to as a gauge-parameter
superﬁeld, and e is a parameter. We are interested in deﬁning supergauge invariant
combinations of bilinear products ˚ 
L.x; / : : : ˚ L.x; /. To this end we impose the
supergauge invariance of the combination
˚
L.x; / e2 eV .x;/ ˚ L.x; / ! ˚

(2.6.39)
where the factor of 2 in the exponential is introduced for convenience, e2 eV .x;/ is
referred to as the gauge connection. Thus from (2.6.38), one consistently obtains the
supergauge transformation of V .x; / to be
V .x; / ! V .x; /  i

Introduction to Supersymmetry
We work in a speciﬁc supergauge, referred to as the Wess-Zumino gauge, such
that the gauge-parameter superﬁeld  is chosen in such a manner as to gauge away
the ﬁeld components .S; Q ; B; G) of V , as shown in (2.6.98)–(2.6.104) below. In
this supergauge, the vector superﬁeld V then reduces to

(2.6.41)
as given in Sect. 2.6.3 below, where as will be shown in (2.6.103),  and D are
gauge invariant, while the vector ﬁeld components V have the conventional gauge
transformations of an abelian gauge theory
V.x/ ! V.x/ C @ a.x/:
(2.6.42)
The structure of the gauge-parameter  to be used now in this supergauge, is given
by the simpler expression

4  5 @a.x/  1
32. 5/2  a.x/;
a.x/  Re a.x/:
(2.6.43)
The advantage in working in the Wess-Zumino gauge is that since now V has no
-independent part, exp.2 e V / in (2.6.39) reduces from an inﬁnite series to a
polynomial. Note that the reality condition of V in (2.6.41) implies that ./ D
, and  is a Majorana spinor.
(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds: Non-Abelian Case
Introducing Hermitian generators tC of the underlying non-abelian group, we
write a vector superﬁeld, and, say, a left-chiral superﬁeld, and a gauge-parameter
left-chiral one as
V D tC VC;
˚L D tC ˚C L;
 D tC C;
(2.6.44)
where VC, ˚C L, C, are given, respectively, in (2.6.23), (2.6.37), (2.6.97) below,
with every ﬁeld component in them carrying now an index C. Implicit in this
deﬁnition here, is that one will be using the adjoint representation of the underlying
group. To avoid confusion with other indices occurring in the formalism, we have
used a rather standard notation of labeling the indices of the generators by capital
letters, e.g., tC, in this chapter.
Due to the matrix structure of the underlying superﬁelds, the supergauge
transformation rule in (2.6.38) is, from (2.6.39), replaced by the more complicated
structure applied to the gauge connection exp.2 g tC VC/, where g is a parameter,

as follows:
exp.2 g V / ! exp.i g / exp.2 g V / exp.i g /  exp.2 g V 0/:
(2.6.45)
We work in the Wess-Zumino supergauge for which the gauge-parameter
superﬁeld  is chosen in such a manner as to gauge away the ﬁeld components
.S; Q ; B; G) of V . In this supergauge, the vector superﬁeld V then reduces again
to the structure given in (2.6.41) (see Sect. 2.6.3), but now for inﬁnitesimal a.x/,
(2.6.112)–(2.6.114) lead to

the gauge parameter  to be used now in this supergauge is given in (2.6.43) with
a real. Note that the structure constants fDEC are real and totally antisymmetric. The

changes the variable x in the ﬁelds above to Ox, with the latter deﬁned in (2.6.26).
The presence of a spinor Aa as a  independent part of WAa should be noted. For
the abelian counterpart simply set fABC D 0, and delete the corresponding indices.
Now we go into the details of the superﬁelds encountered above.

2.6.1
The Scalar Superﬁeld
A scalar superﬁeld ˚.x; /, as a function of .x ; a/, may be expanded in powers of
the components a as follows
˚.x; / D A.x/C a.x/a C abab C abcabc C abcdabcd;
(2.6.71)
terminating, of course, in fourth order due to the anti-commutativity of the
components of , with the theta independent part A.x/ being a scalar.
By examining equations (2.2.21), (2.2.27), and (2.2.28), for the expansions
of products of the components of , we note that the product of four of s is
proportional to . 5/2, the product of three is proportional to . 5/ , (or
equivalently . 5/ ), and ﬁnally the product of two is a linear combination of ,
 5, and  5. Hence one may introduce a scalar superﬁeld as given in (2.6.2).
By deﬁnition, a scalar superﬁeld satisﬁes
˚ 0.x 0;  0/ D ˚.x; /;
(2.6.72)
and, in particular, for a supersymmetric transformation as given in (2.6.3),

(2.6.74)
We note that the above operation is almost the same as ϵD with the sign in the middle
of D changed, however, to a plus sign.
We may relate the above response of the superﬁeld to the action of the unitary
operator U D 1 C i ϵ Q [see (2.5.5)], for inﬁnitesimal ϵ, with ϵ Q D .ϵ Q/ as the
generator of the supersymmetry transformation, via ˚ 0 D U˚U and
•˚ D 1

(2.6.75)
The transformation rules for the component ﬁelds in (2.6.2) may be read-
ily obtained from (2.6.74), and, in particular, by the differentiation rules with
respect to  given in Box 2.1 in the beginning of the section, after ϵ.@=@ C
.i=2/ @/˚.x; / in (2.6.74) is expressed in the original form as ˚.x; /
in (2.6.2).
Expressing ϵ.@=@ C .i=2/ @/˚.x; / in the same form as ˚.x; / is best
illustrated by the application of the operation ϵ@=@ to the sixth term on the right-

hand side of (2.6.2), by using in the process the differentiation rule with respect to
the derivative @=@ in Box 2.1, and the use of the key equation for the expansion of

expressed in terms of ,  5, and  5 using (2.2.20). [Note the plus sign in
the second term in the extreme right-hand side of the equation.]
Another illustration of the same type is obtained by the application of the
operation .i=2/ ϵ@ to the second term on the right-hand side of (2.6.2). The
summation formula for ab, in Box 2.1 gives

(2.6.77)
where we have used f 5; g D 0, . 5/2 D 1, and the usual notation @  @.
The following equation should be noted which makes use of the vanishing
property of the product of any two of ,  5,  5 (see also Box 2.1). This
equation is obtained by the application of .i=2/ ϵ@ also to the sixth term on the
right-hand side of (2.6.2) and gives:

Finally we use the properties of the bilinear products ϵ : : : , given in Box 2.1, to
rewrite them as  : : : ϵ, and express the products  ,  5 , respectively, as
 5  5, and  5 , as shown on the second and third lines in Box 2.1.
The transformation rules, given in (2.6.5)–(2.6.11), then readily emerge for the
components ﬁelds of the scalar superﬁeld ˚.x; / in (2.6.2) by the application of
the operation in (2.6.74).

for the terms involving no s. The remaining relations (2.6.6) to (2.6.11) follow
upon the comparisons, respectively, of the coefﬁcients of ,  5, ,  5,
 5  and . 5/2. In obtaining the expression for relation in (2.6.10), the
transformation rule for  in (2.6.6), in the process, has been used. Similarly, in
obtaining the expression for the relation in (2.6.11), the transformation rule for A
in (2.6.5), in the process, has been used.
The transformation law
•˚ D 1

via the generator ϵQ D Qϵ, leads to transformations between bosons and fermions
as obtained through (2.6.5)–(2.6.11).
The product of scalar superﬁelds is also a scalar superﬁelds. That is, in the above
notation,
˚1.x; / ˚ 2.x; / D ˚.x; /;
(2.6.79)
where the components ﬁelds of ˚.x; / are expressed in terms of the component
ﬁelds of ˚1.x; /, ˚ 2.x; /. By using, in the process, the vanishing property of the
product of any two of ,  5,  5, and the expression for the expansion of
ab, as given in Box 2.1 in the beginning of this section, the components of the
scalar superﬁeld ˚.x; / are readily expressed in terms of the components of the

Chiral Superﬁelds
In reference to (2.6.5)–(2.6.11), if we set  D 0, D D 0, and V of the form
V D @, for some , then we have the following closed system of transformations
of ﬁelds among themselves:
•A D i ϵ  5 ;

(2.6.91)
where note that for V D @, Œ ;   @@ D 0 in (2.6.10).
Upon multiplying (2.6.88) by .1 ˙  5/=2 and using
 5.1 ˙  5/ D ˙.1 ˙  5/;
f 5; g D 0, the system of (2.6.87)–(2.6.91) may be conveniently rewritten as

These introduce two systems of equations. One by choosing  R D 0, B C iG D 0,
@A C iV D 0. Thus upon setting i G D B  i F, i V D @A, we obtain
the closed system of transformations in (2.6.20)–(2.6.22). Hence using the fact that

in (2.6.2) we now have

we generate a so-called left-chiral superﬁeld as given in (2.6.23).
The second system is introduced by choosing
 L D 0; B  iG D 0; @A C iV D 0:
Hence by setting, i G D B   i F, i V D @A, where, needless to say, F.x/,
A.x/ may be chosen as a new set of functions. We may then generate a right-chiral
superﬁeld as given in (2.6.33), with the transformation rules in (2.6.30)–(2.6.32).

 5  L D 0;  5 a D  5 ./a;
as given in (2.2.22), (2.2.23). On the other hand the exponential term is nothing but
a translation operator of x by i  5=4. That is, we have obtained the simple
expression for ˚ L.x; / in (2.6.27), and similarly for ˚ R.x; / in (2.6.33)/(2.6.34).
By applying the right-hand superderivative D R, deﬁned in (2.6.28), to ˚ L.x; /
in (2.6.27), and using, in the process, the chain rule,

and similarly with respect to x , for a function f of Ox, a left-chiral superﬁeld is
easily seen to be annihilated by the right-hand superderivative. Similarly, a right-
hand chiral ﬁeld ˚R.x; / in (2.6.34), is annihilated by the left-hand superderivative
D L, which is also deﬁned in (2.6.28). These are, respectively, given in (2.6.28),
(2.6.35).

(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds
The general structure of a (scalar-) vector superﬁeld was given in (2.6.37).
(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds: Abelian Case
Under the transformation in (2.6.38), V transforms as in (2.6.40). The gauge-

From (2.6.38)–(2.6.40), and Problem 2.16, we obtain the supergauge transforma-

(2.6.104)
Hence the ﬁeld components .S; Q ; B; G) of V
may be gauged away, by
choosing Im a; ; b, appropriately, to cancel the just mentioned ﬁeld components.
This supergauge is referred to as the Wess-Zumino gauge. In this supergauge, the
vector superﬁeld V then reduces to the expression given in (2.6.41) with the vector
ﬁeld components V having the standard gauge transformation of abelian gauge
theory in (2.6.102).
As mentioned in the text, the advantage in working in this gauge is that since now
V has no -independent part, exp.2eV / in (2.6.39) reduces from an inﬁnite series
to a polynomial. Also the parameter gauge function now takes the simple form given
in (2.6.43). Finally we note that  and D are invariant.

(Scalar-) Vector Superﬁelds: Non-Abelian Case
To investigate the nature of the right-hand side of (2.6.45), we may invoke the Baker-

The (scalar-) vector superﬁeld V , then reduces explicitly to the structure given

the gauge parameter  now to be used in this supergauge is given in (2.6.43) with a
real. That is, in particular, with

(2.6.114)
and the second term in (2.6.113), does not contribute to the commutator in (2.6.112)
since V , in (2.6.41), starts with second order in . Thus we obtain the expression
in (2.6.46) with inﬁnitesimal a.x/. This leads, in the super Wess-Zumino super-
gauge, the explicit rules spelled out in (2.6.47)–(2.6.49), for inﬁnitesimal a.x/.

which is expressed in terms of the right-hand superderivative D R on its extreme

the second term is zero in (2.6.128). This establishes the transformation rule of Wa

expression for WAa in (2.6.69), where the index A, as a capital letter, corresponds
to the group generators tA labels, a (standard) notation used before in Sect. 2.6.3,
while the lower case index a denotes a spinor index. The abelian counterpart is a
special case of the structure given above.

The quadratic divergence, involving the factor C.0/, cancels out exactly. On the

2.11
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
To investigate the concept of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking,40 it is easiest
to consider the Wess-Zumino Lagrangian density obtained in Sect. 2.9. To this end,

For A D 0, we have V D 0 which provides a minimum, since W00Œ0 D m > 0,
which is a condition that supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken, at least in the
tree approximation, since V is non-negative. This minimum corresponds to F D 0.

vacuum state.

2.11
Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking
159
If the vacuum expectation value hvacjFijvaci in (2.11.13) does not vanish for the
given i in question, the above equation implies that Qajvaci ¤ 0, at least for an a,
since otherwise the vacuum expectation of the expression in (2.11.14) will vanish.
We also obtain from (2.3), in the introduction to this chapter, hvacjHjvaci > 0,
implying spontaneous symmetry breaking.42 In the tree approximation, i.e., by
neglecting radiative corrections, the vacuum expectation value of Fi becomes
simply Fi itself.
Guided by the criterion of renormalizability, thus avoiding having interaction
terms with coupling constants with negative dimensionalities, we may introduce the

To ﬁnd the minimum of this potential, we may set A1 D .2ˇ=˛/A2A3, since
the last term above is non-negative. For deﬁniteness suppose that ˛2  2ˇ2M2. The
case with a reversed inequality may be similarly handled. Note that upon writing

(2.11.20)
Because at least one of the auxiliary ﬁelds is non-zero, the spontaneous symmetry
breaking encountered below is referred to as F-type supersymmetry breaking.
By introducing the vacuum expectation values of the ﬁelds, we may, in particular,
make the substitution A2 ! A2 C hA2i, working at the tree level, where now the
vacuum expectation value of the ﬁeld A2 is zero, and we have denoted h0jA2j0i
simply by hA2i, and will be taken to be real. Thus the scalar potential in (2.11.18)
takes the form

Since the latter does not involve the ﬁeld A2, the masses of the associated real
ﬁelds a2 b2 are zero. For hA2i ¤ 0, one may diagonalize the mass matrix extracted
from (2.11.22) in the basis .a1; b1; a3; b3/ to ﬁnd the mass spectrum of the scalar
ﬁelds. For hA2i D 0, in particular, we have also two scalar ﬁelds with masses

ﬁeld, two fermions with masses

(2.11.26)
respectively.
When a symmetry is broken spontaneously, massless particles (Goldstones)
appear in the theory. In supersymmetry theory, the generator of supersymmetry
transformations is fermionic, and the Goldstone now is a fermion, referred to as
a Goldstino. In the present model, it is associated with the massless fermion ﬁeld
we observed above.

The generation of the superpartners of the particles of the standard model is
implicitly taken care of by promoting the ﬁeld of the latter particles to superﬁelds.
For example, we may deﬁne the left-chiral superﬁeld associated with the electron,

an auxiliary ﬁeld. Similarly, we may introduce the superﬁeld of a gauge boson, say,

and , here, denotes its superpartner, a Majorana spinor, referred to as the wino, and
D denotes an auxiliary ﬁeld. In general, the superpartner of a gauge ﬁeld is called a
gaugino.
By continuing, the above process, we may generate the superﬁelds associated, in
particular, with the quarks and leptons of the standard model, conveniently, denoted
in the following manner:

(2.13.3)
where the subscript i speciﬁes the various generations, with the Ni denoting the left-
chiral superﬁelds associated with the left handed neutrino ﬁelds, the Ui denoting
the left-chiral superﬁelds associated with the left-handed u; c; t quarks, and the Di
denoting the left-chiral superﬁelds associated with the left-handed d; s; b quarks,
respectively, for i D 1; 2; 3. .E/c
i I .U/c
i ; .D/c
i are associated with the left-handed
positron, and the left-handed anti-quarks, respectively. The superpartner of a lepton
is referred to as a slepton, and of the quark as a squark. The superparticles of the
Gluons, eight of them, are referred as gluinos.
To consider the interaction of the above fermion ﬁelds, with the Higgs bosons,
recall how the F term of a superpotential W
ˇˇ
F, in Sects. 2.11, 2.12, was deﬁned.
To this end the following elementary properties, involving left-chiral superﬁelds ˚L
and their adjoints should be noted:
ı.2/. R/ .˚j L  Aj/ D 0;
(2.13.4)
ı.2/. R/ .˚i L  Ai/.˚j L  Aj/ D 0;

(2.13.6)
from which we may infer that for describing Yukawa interactions of the quark and
leptons, in a supersymmetric setting, the superpotential must be a functions of the
(left-) chiral ﬁelds but not of their adjoints. By attempting to deﬁne their interactions
with only one Higgs left-chiral superﬁeld doublet, say with weak hypercharge Y D
C1, we will encounter a difﬁculty as will be evident below. To this end, one deﬁnes

respectively, of weak hypercharges Y D 1. We note that using the identity
Y D 2.Q  T3/, the weak hypercharges associated with the superﬁelds in (2.13.3)
are respectively, Y D
1; 2I 1=3; 4=3; 2=3. Accordingly, SU.3/  SU.2/ 
U.1/ singlets may be introduced to deﬁne the Lagrangian density of the Yukawa
interactions of the fermions with the Higgs bosons and the superpotential will
involve linear combinations of F parts of the following anti-symmetric terms:

(2.13.8)
with coefﬁcients depending on i and j, where we note that the anti-symmetric
combinations of the two doublets, in each term, give rise to SU.2/ singlets. Clearly,
if we have only one Higgs doublet, say H1, then the last term will involve the adjoints
of the superﬁeld components of H1. Similarly, if we have the Higgs doublet H2
the ﬁrst two terms will involve the adjoints of the superﬁeld components of H2.
In particular, the two Higgs ﬁelds now give masses to u-type and d-type quarks
consistent with supersymmetry. The presence of two Higgs doublets turns out to be
also important in the elimination of higgsino related anomalies. In addition to the
Yukawa couplings in (2.13.8), we may also consider a mass-like term involving the
two Higgs doublets in the form / .H20H10  H2CH1/

F.44 Interactions with gauge
ﬁelds occur through the kinetic energy terms.
The theory under consideration, with just two Higgs doublets, with minimal
number of couplings and minimal number of ﬁelds is referred to as the Minimal
Supersymmetric Model (MSSM).
An important contribution of this model is to the problem of the uniﬁcation
of gauge couplings at high energies, that is, beyond the MSSM model. This is
considered next.
The beta functions of the MSSM are given in Table 2.1 together with the
corresponding ones for the SM for comparison,45 where

44Here it is worth noting that selecting renormalizable supersymmetric interactions terms which
conserve baryon and lepton numbers, may be equivalently achieved by imposing a symmetry
known as the conservation of R-parity, but we will not go into it here. See, e.g., [11, 14].

Introduction to Supersymmetry
Fig. 2.2 Quadratic divergent contributions to a scalar particle self-mass squared from the two
graphs, with the solid and the dashed lines denoting a spin 1/2 and a scalar particle, respectively
chapter. Also with the lifetime of the proton / M 4, one obtains the very welcome
additional power of  104 for the lifetime to that of the non-supersymmetric theory.
The recent experimental large lower bound51 for the lifetime of the proton justiﬁes,
however, the need of further investigations of uniﬁcations schemes.
In Sect. 2.10, we have seen, by a particular example, how supersymmetry
eliminates quadratic divergences in the radiative corrections to the mass squared,
through the study of the propagator, of a scalar particle. Due to opposite signs
of the statistics of the fermion and the scalar particle, and with the particular
relationship existing between the respective dimensionless couplings, as imposed
by supersymmetry, such quadratic divergences cancel out. As a matter of fact, in a
supersymmetric theory, some radiative corrections may not only be ﬁnite but may
be completely absent in perturbation theory.52
A fundamental energy scale arises in the SM from the vacuum expectation value
of the Higgs boson ﬁeld ' 246 GeV,53 which sets up the scale for the masses
of the particles in the theory, including its own mass. This energy scale is much
smaller in comparison to the Planck energy scale  1019 GeV or lower, at which
gravitation is expected to be signiﬁcant. It is even much smaller than a grand uniﬁed
energy scale, say  1016 GeV. The question then arises as to what amounts for
the enormous energy scale difference between a grand uniﬁed energy scale and the
energy scale characteristic of the SM? This is known as the hierarchy problem.
What kind of new physics arises in this huge range of energy? As a scalar particle,
the self-mass squared •M2
H of the Higgs boson, in the non-supersymmetric SM
model, is quadratically divergent,54 as inferred, by simple power counting, from
such diagrams as shown in Fig. 2.2.
51See [27].
52See [20, 34]. The underlying theorems are referred to as non-renormalization theorems.
53See, e.g., (6.14.34) in Chap. 6 of Vol. I [26].
54See also [39].

2.13
Incorporating Supersymmetry in the Standard Model and Couplings. . .
169
With an ultraviolet cut-off taken of the order, say, M  1016  1019 GeV, an
unnatural cancelation,55 referred to as ﬁne-tuning, has to occur between the bare
mass squared of the Higgs boson and radiative corrections of the order M2 in
order to give a net ﬁnite mass for the Higgs boson not much different from the
energy scale characterizing the SM.56 This unnatural cancelation of enormously
large numbers has been termed a facet of the hierarchy problem. We have seen
in Sect. 6.14 of Vol. I, that at the tree level approximation, the electroweak theory
provides very good agreement with experiments for the masses of the gauge bosons.
A supersymmetric removal of an unwanted quadratic divergence is a positive
contribution to the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry is of signiﬁcance in dealing
with the hierarchy problem, as in supersymmetric ﬁeld theories cancelations of
such large quadratic corrections, a priori, generally, occur between loops involving
particles and loops involving their supersymmetric counterparts in a supersymmetric
version of a non-supersymmetric ﬁeld theory, similar to the two loops shown in
Fig. 2.2. Moreover, this cancelation is, possibly, up to divergences of logarithmic
type which are tolerable, thus protecting a scalar particle from acquiring a large
bare mass.
Since no superparticles are expected to have the same masses as their particle
counterparts, otherwise some of them would have been discovered so far, super-
symmetry is to be broken. For supersymmetry to provide a solution to the hierarchy
problem, the relationship between the dimensionless coupling constants, in the
unbroken supersymmetric theory, must be maintained without spoiling renormal-
izability, and without re-introducing quadratic divergences that supersymmetry was
here to eliminate. This may be done by introducing supersymmetry breaking terms
in the Lagrangian density with mass terms and coupling terms with positive mass
dimensionalities, referred to as “soft” supersymmetry breaking terms.57 This, in
turn, introduces new physics beyond the SM, speciﬁed by an energy scale which
may be denoted by Ms. With the quadratic divergence now removed, the self mass
squared •MH 2, will, by dimensional reasoning, be proportional to Ms 2, up to the
well known logarithmic corrective factors of perturbation theory. Clearly, such a
mass scale Ms cannot be too large, say of the order of a TeV or so, otherwise the
hierarchy problem would re-emerge all over, or perhaps give rise to a little hierarchy
problem.
55In QED the self-mass of the electron is only logarithmically divergent and the shift between the
bare and the physical mass is not huge in comparison with a cut-off mass scale, say, of the order of
the Planck energy.
56Aad, et al. [1], Chatrchyan, et al. [6].
57“Soft” supersymmetry breaking terms have been classiﬁed systematically by Girardello and
Grisaru [18]. Such terms are spelled out in detail in [38, p. 68].

Spinors in Curved Spacetime: Geometrical Intricacies
With the detailed geometrical aspects developed of general relativity in Sect. 1.1, we
now consider further generalizations of geometrical nature to describe supergravity.
To this end, in the last three sections of this chapter, we consider a local version
of supersymmetry, where the parameter ϵ.x/, involved in supersymmetric transfor-
mations, depends on the particular spacetime point into consideration, and hence
takes into account the underlying local structure of spacetime. Not surprisingly,
this local version of supersymmetry is called supergravity. In the present section
we develop the action of the gravitational ﬁeld, associated with the spin 2 particle
massless particle- the so-called graviton, and consider the role of a spinor in such
a formalism. In the next section, the action of the Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld of spin
3=2 is developed, as the superpartner of the graviton. In the ﬁnal section, the full
action of pure supergravity is derived.58 Here we follow a rather standard notation
and, in order not to confuse Lorentz indices with general curved spacetime ones, we
use Latin indices for the former and Greek indices for the latter. Also since spinor
components will, in general, be suppressed throughoutthis section and the following
two sections, this turns out to be quite convenient.
Let us recall once more the deﬁnition of the parallel transfer of the components
V.x/ of a vector ﬁeld from a point x to a point inﬁnitesimally close point x C dx in
reference to some given curve as given in (1.1.28)

of a spinor ﬁeld by
 .x/ !  k.x C dx/ D  .x/ C ˝.x/  .x/ dx ;
(2.14.2)

We have a Lagrangian density depending on the tetrad ﬁelds ea, the ﬁelds  ;  ,
and the spin connection .!/ab. We have already considered the variation of this
action with respect to the spin connection in (2.15.9) and determined the torsion
in (2.15.10). Since the spin connection will depend on the tetrad and the Rarita-
Schwinger ﬁelds, the variations of the actions with respect to the latter may be
restricted to variations of the explicit dependence of the Lagrangian density only
to these latter variables. This is because a variation of the action A with respect to,
say, a tetrad ea, may, by using the chain rule, be symbolically written as

Introduction to String Theory
A string, whether open or closed, as it moves in spacetime, it sweeps out a two-
dimensional surface called a worldsheet. String Theory is a quantum ﬁeld theory1
which operates on this two-dimensional worldsheet with remarkable consequences
in spacetime itself, albeit in higher dimensions. The strings are supposedly very
small in extension and may “appear” almost point-like if they are indeed very small,
say, of the order of Planck length. Since no experiments can probe distances of the
order of the Planck length, such a string in present day experiments is considered to
be point-like. What is remarkable about string theory is that particles that are needed
to describe the dynamics of elementary particles arise naturally in the mass spectra
of oscillating strings, and are not, a priori, assumed to exist or put in by hand in
the underlying theories. Particles are identiﬁed as vibrational modes of strings, and
a single vibrating string may describe several particles depending on its vibrational
modes. Strings describing bosonic particles are referred to as bosonic strings, while
those involving fermionic ones as well are referred to as superstrings. Accordingly,
superstrings are expected to be more relevant to the real world than bosonic strings.
We will witness the emergence of the graviton, in addition to a whole spectrum
of other excitation modes from the theory and thus, hopefully, string theory may
provide a framework for the uniﬁcation of general relativity and quantum theory.
The ultimate goal of String Theory is actually to provide a uniﬁed description of all
the fundamental interactions in Nature and, in particular, give rise to a consistent
theory of quantum gravity. If string theory has to do with quantum gravity, it must
involve the three fundamental constants: Newton’s gravitational constant GN, the
quantum unit of action h
, and the speed of light c. The unit of length emerging from
these fundamental constants is the Planck length `P D

Introduction to String Theory
The dimensionality of the spacetime in which the strings live are predicted by
the underlying theory as well and are necessarily of higher dimensions than four for
consistency with Lorentz invariance of spacetime at the quantum level, consisting
of a dimensionality of 26 for the bosonic strings and a spacetime dimensionality
of 10 for the superstrings. We will see, in particular, how the knowledge of the
number of degrees of freedom associated with massless ﬁelds lead self consistently
to the determination of the dimensionality of the underlying spacetime of a string
theory. The extra dimensions are expected to curl up into a space that is too small to
be detectable with present available energies. For example the surface of a hollow
extended cylinder with circular base is two dimensional, with one dimension along
the cylinder, and another one encountered as one moves on its circumference. If the
radius of the base of the cylinder is relatively small, the cylinder will appear as one
dimensional when viewed from a large distance (low energies). Accordingly, the
extra dimensions in string theory are expected to be small and methods, referred to
as compactiﬁcations,2 have been developed to deal with them thus ensuring that the
“observable” dimensionality of spacetime is four.
Unlike loop quantum gravity, which provides a background independent formu-
lation of spacetime with the latter emerging from the theory itself, as discussed
earlier, the strings in string theories are assumed to move in a pre-determined
spacetime, and thus spacetime plays a passive role in them.3 There are also
several superstring theories, and a theory, referred to as M-Theory,4 based on non-
perturbative methods, is envisaged to unify the existing superstrings theories into
one single theory, instead of several ones, and be related to them by various limiting
and/or transformation rules, referred to as dualities,5 and is of 11 dimensional space-
time. M-Theory is believed to be approximated by 11 dimensional supergravity,6
and the spacetime structure may emerge from the theory as well. Bosonic strings
involve tachyonic states. This is unlike the situation in superstring theories in which
supersymmetry plays a key role in their deﬁnitions, and a process referred to as
a GSO projection method, ensuring the equality of the degrees of freedom of
bosonic and fermionic states, as required by supersymmetry, in turn implies that
no tachyonic states appear in the theory.7
String theory was accidentally discovered through work carried out by Veneziano
in 1968 when he attempted to write down consistent explicit expressions of meson-
meson scattering amplitudes in strong interactions physics.8 This was, of course
before the discovery of QCD. With the many excited states of mesons and baryons

in a 5 dimensional generalization of general relativity.

The above amplitude involves the exchange of an inﬁnite number of particles for
the various values of the non-negative integer n corresponding to arbitrary (integer)
spins. This is unlike the situation in conventional ﬁeld theory as QED or the standard
model, where a tree approximation involves the exchange of a ﬁnite number of
particles. String theory shares this property of the Veneziano amplitude. As a matter
of fact we will see in Sect. 3.5.1 how the Veneziano amplitude may be derived from
string theory. In string theory, two strings with given vibrational modes, identifying
two given particles, may combine forming one string with an arbitrary number of
different vibrational modes associated with a myriad number of particles, deﬁning
generalized 3-vertices (see Sect. 3.5). The combined string may again split into
two strings with associated vibrational modes, identiﬁed appropriately with two
more particles, describing a scattering process of 2 particles ! 2 particles. Thus
interactions involve string worldsheets of various topologies. Due to the assumed

non-zero extensions of strings, it is hoped that they provide, naturally, an ultraviolet
cut-off   .`P/1 and render all processes involving strings ultraviolet ﬁnite. This
is unlike conventional quantum ﬁeld theory interactions where all the quantum ﬁelds
are multiplied locally at the same spacetime points, like multiplying distributions at
the same point, and are, in this sense, quite troublesome.
Nambu [30], Nielsen [33] and Susskind [39] have shown that the famous
expression of the amplitude postulated by Veneziano may be interpreted as a
quantum theory of scattering of relativistic strings. Although, a priori, this was
assumed to describe a strong interaction process, Yoneya [48], and Scherk and
Schwarz [36] made use of the fact that string theory (involving closed strings)
contains a spin 2 massless state, which was identiﬁed with the elusive graviton,
in addition to a whole spectrum of other excitation modes, to propose that string
theory provides a framework for the uniﬁcation of general relativity and quantum
mechanics.
As early as 1971, Neveu and Schwarz [32], and Ramond [35] included fermions
in their analyses, which eventually led to the notion of superstrings, and during a
short period of time, several types9 of superstrings were introduced in the literature.
Other extended objects are also encountered in string theory called branes which,
in general, are of higher spatial dimensions than one, with the string deﬁned as a one
dimensional brane. For example, an open string, satisfying a particular boundary
condition, referred to as a Dirichlet boundary condition, speciﬁes a hypersurface,
referred to as a D brane, on which the end points of the open string reside. On
the other hand, the graviton corresponds to a vibrational mode of closed strings,
and since the latter, having no ends, may not be restricted to a brane and moves
away from it. This might explain the weakness of the gravitational ﬁeld, if our
universe is a 3 dimensional brane embedded in a higher dimensional spacetime.
Massless particles encountered in string theory are really the physically relevant
ones because of the large unit of mass .`P/1  1019 GeV in attributing masses
to the spectrum of massive particles. A systematic analysis of all the massless
ﬁeld excitations encountered in both bosonic and superstrings are investigated in
Manoukian [26–28], in their respective higher dimensional spacetimes, and include
the determinations of the degrees of freedom associated with them.10 As we will
see later a massless particle may acquire mass if, for example, the end points of the
open string are attached to two different branes, instead of a single brane.
Later we will learn the remarkable fact that Einstein’s general relativity
(Sect. 3.6), as well as Yang-Mill ﬁeld theory (Sect. 3.7) may be obtained from
string theory.
9Green and Schwarz [16, 17], Gross et al. [19, 20].
10Note that in four dimensional spacetime the number of degrees of freedom (spin states) of non-
scalar ﬁelds is always two. This is not true in higher dimensional spacetime. For example, the
degrees of freedom associated with a massless vector particle is 8 in 10 dimensions, while for the
graviton is 35, as shown later in the text. In 4 dimensions, their degrees of freedom are, of course,
two.

Introduction to String Theory
191
Interesting high energy scattering amplitudes have been computed in string
theory over the years,11 which provide a hint that space may not be probed beyond
the Planck length—a result shared with “loop quantum gravity”. It is also worth
mentioning that the Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy relation has been also derived in
string theory.12
In recent years much work has been done indicating that general relationships
may exist between ﬁeld theories and string theories, and consequently considerable
attention was given trying to make such a statement more and more precise, with
the ultimate hope of providing, in turn, a consistent and acceptable quantum theory
of gravitation relevant to our world, but much work still remains to be done. In
particular, much study has been made to study the equivalence between certain four
dimensional gauge theories and superstring theories, referred to as the AdS/CFT
correspondence which we now brieﬂy discuss. Such a correspondence has been
also referred to as a Gauge/Gravity duality, as well as Maldacena Duality, a duality
which was ﬁrst proposed by Maldacena.13 Here AdS stands for Anti-de-Sitter, and
CFT stands for conformal ﬁeld theory which we deﬁne below. Although we will not
go into theoretical developments of this correspondence principle in the text, it is
worth noting and, in turn, brieﬂy discuss that the aim of such a work is to show, for
example, the existence of an equivalence relation between a certain supersymmetric
SU(N) Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory in 4 dimensional Minnkowski spacetime, and a
superstring theory in 5 dimensional AdS space, having one additional dimension
to the Minkowskian one, and with the 5 dimensions of the AdS space supplemented
by the 5 dimensions of a 5-sphere, making up the 10 dimensions of a superstring
theory. The interest in here is that it deals with a connection between string theory
(involving gravity) and a supersymmetric gauge theory.
To the above end, we ﬁrst deﬁne the conformal group as applied in 4 dimensional
Minkowski spacetime. This involves a scale transformation x !  x, a so-called
special conformal transformation
x 0
x 0 2 D x
x 2 C a;
(3.6)
for a given four vector a, in addition to the Poincaré ones, generating all in all 15
generators which act on the ﬁelds as a set of ﬁeld transformations: 4 for the special
transformation, one for the scaling, 6 for Lorentz and 4 translations. The ﬁeld theory
(FT) in question is a supersymmetric SU(N) Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory with an N D 4
supersymmetry.

involves operators as that of a D-dimensional ﬂat space. That is, it involves D.D 
1/=2 generators which correspond to Lorentz transformations, and D generators
which correspond to translations, making a total of D.DC1/=2 generators. This
number will coincide with the number of 15 generators of conformal transforma-
tions discussed above only if D D 5. The latter implies that the space AdS has
to be of 5 dimensions, and consequently it may be denoted by AdS5. That is, due
to the additional number of generators in the conformal group, the AdS space is
of one dimensional higher than that of the 4 dimensional Minkowski space. In
order to have a superstring theory in 10 dimensional spacetime, we need extra 5
dimensions to that of AdS5 just described. This is achieved by the 5-sphere S5 which
matches the N D 4 transformations of the supersymmetric ﬁeld theory. We thus
generate the ten dimensional spacetime AdS5  S5 for the superstring theory.14 The
latter space carries as isometries, i.e., distance preserving maps, the symmetries of
the Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory which reside in 4 dimensional Minkowski spacetime.
Thus one expects that the conformal supersymmetric Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory (with
N D 4 spinor supercharges) is the same as a 10 dimensional superstring theory
(which includes gravity) on AdS5S5. This was conjectured in a remarkable classic
paper by Maldacana,15 and needless to say, there has been much interest in it as it
deals with a connection that may exist between string theory (involving gravity) and
supersymmetric gauge theories as mentioned earlier.
The above brings us into contact with the holographic principle, in analogy to
holography in capturing 3 dimensional images of objects on a two dimensional
plate.16 The conformal quantum ﬁeld theory is like a hologram capturing infor-
14The underlying superstring theory is of type II. Such superstrings as well as other ones, of course,
will be studied in this chapter.

mation about the higher dimensional quantum gravity theory, i.e., the boundary of
AdS space may be regarded as the spacetime for a conformal ﬁeld theory. In this
case the SU(N) theory provides a holographic description of gravitational ﬁeld.
This is in analogy to black hole entropy, with information encoded in it, being
proportional to the area rather than to the volume of the region enclosed by the
horizon. Perhaps holography is a basic property of string theory and one expects
that much has to be done before developing a realistic quantum gravity, and in turn
provide a background independent formulation for string theory. The holographic
principle was ﬁrst proposed by ’t Hooft.17 We will not, however, elaborate further
on AdS=CFT correspondence and the holographic principle in the text, and the
interested reader may refer to the references just provided.
This chapter is involved with a systematic presentation of the fundamentals of
string theory. The ﬁrst section deals with the development of action integrals for
relativistic particles and superparticles and of their interpretations as a preparation
to study strings. Bosonic strings are treated in Sect. 3.2, which includes the deﬁnition
of the action integral, underlying boundary conditions, details of the light-cone
gauge, open and closed strings, oriented and unoriented strings. Quantum aspects of
bosonic strings are developed and the mass spectra of the string vibrational modes
are analyzed with emphasis put on massless particles. The central problem of their
compactiﬁcation and the associated concept of a duality, referred to as T duality, are
ﬁnally analyzed. A detailed study is carried out of all the massless ﬁelds that emerge
from the theory of bosonic strings and their properties, such as their associated
degrees of freedom, are spelled out. This is followed by a study of superstrings.
Here Dirac ﬁelds are included in the action integral, and the Dirac equation in
two dimensions plays a key role. Boundary conditions are examined in detail and
the concept of the so-called GSO projection method, to ensure supersymmetry, is
invoked. The fundamental types of superstrings are analyzed, and the concept of
compactiﬁcation and the various duality relationships that are envisaged to exist
between these types and that of M-theory are brieﬂy discussed, giving the hope
of having one uniﬁed theory instead of several superstring theories. Detailed studies
are also carried out of all the massless bosonic and fermionic ﬁelds that emerge from
the theory of superstrings and their properties are spelled out. D branes, as extended
objects, speciﬁed by Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to which the ends of open
strings are restricted to move is the subject matter of Sect. 3.4. Here, in particular,
we show how a massless vector ﬁeld may acquire mass, when the ends of the open
string, in question, are attached to two different D branes mentioned earlier. Anti-
symmetric tensor ﬁelds, which are obtained in the mass spectra of vibrating strings,
due to their very nature, interact, in turn, with such extended objects providing a
justiﬁcation of the existence of branes. Section 3.5 deals with the introduction of
dimensional object. As one shines a Laser beam on it an image of the three dimensional object
emerges.

vertices in string theory and in developing expressions for scattering amplitudes. In
particular, the classic expression of the Veneziano amplitude, mentioned above, is
derived from string theory.
Simple demonstrations are given in Sects. 3.6 and 3.7, showing how Einstein’s
theory of general relativity and Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory may emerge from string
theory, respectively. No attempt will be made in this introductory presentation,
however, to consider supergravity in the light of superstring theory.

The Relativistic Particle and the Relativistic
Superparticle
In this section we set up the action integrals for a relativistic particle as well as of a
relativistic superparticle.
3.1.1
Action of the Relativistic Particle
A relativistic particle, as it moves in spacetime, traces a curve referred to as its
worldline (Fig. 3.1). In Minkowski spacetime, generalized, for convenience for later
studies, to D dimensions, with one time variable x 0,
and D  1 space variables
x 1; : : : ; x D1, as set up in a given coordinate system, the interval ds may be
expressed as
ds D c dt

c2 PX2;
(3.1.1)
where the X, in capital letters, with  D 0; 1; : : : ; D  1, X D .X1; : : : ; XD1/, are
the coordinate labels of points on the string in the “laboratory” system one has set
up, and we have inserted the speed of light constant c for further analysis. Here PX D
dX=dt, and as usual X0 D c t. The metric is deﬁned by  D diagŒ1; 1; : : : ; 1.
For low speeds, we may expand the expression in (3.1.1) as follows,

We recognize the terms within the square brackets as the non-relativistic kinetic
energy minus a constant potential energy. Accordingly, we may deﬁne the action

The Relativistic Superparticle
We note that the integral (3.1.12) is a one dimensional integral. Consider the
latter for m D 0. To develop an action with worldline supersymmetry to describe
a superparticle, we note that in one dimension, one may introduce one theta.
Accordingly, superﬁelds may be deﬁned involving a single power of theta as follows

Again the i factor, within the integrand in (3.1.19), ensures the reality of the action.
This action should be compared with the one in (3.1.12) for m D 0.
Next we consider strings.
3.2
Bosonic Strings
This section deals with the intricacies of bosonic strings.
3.2.1
The Bosonic String Action
An open or closed string as it moves in spacetime, it sweeps out a two-dimensional
surface referred to as its worldsheet . Some worldsheets generated by an open string
and a closed one are shown in Fig. 3.2:
The points on the worldsheet of a string are parametrized by coordinates 0 D 
,
1 D , which correspond, respectively, to timelike and spacelike directions. That
is, 1 D  is the spacial coordinate along the string, i.e., it provides a partition of
the string for somebody “sitting” on it, while 0 D 
, describes its propagation in
time. In a coordinate system set up (“laboratory system”), a point on the string is
labeled by X.
; /,  D 0; 1; : : : ; D 1.
We recall that the action for a relativistic particle was given by mc
R
ds,
corresponding to the curve traced by the particle, where ds is a measure of “length”
in spacetime. The proportionality constant m c, was ﬁxed by considering the non-
relativistic limit of the action, and, of course, by checking the correct dimensionality
of the action. To obtain the expression for the action of a string, we do the same thing
Fig. 3.2 Examples of worldsheets of an open string and a closed one. No speciﬁc dynamics of the
strings are considered in these diagrams

3.2
Bosonic Strings

Fig. 3.3
R
dA corresponds to the area swept by the string in spacetime
and write the action as Const:R dA, corresponding to the area swept by the string in
spacetime, where dA is such an inﬁnitesimal area, and investigate the nature of the
proportionality constant (Fig. 3.3).
To see how a two-dimensional surface may be generated in Minkowski space-
time, consider some event with coordinate label X.1; 2/, in some coordinate
system, parametrized by a pair of variables 1; 2. Suppose 2 is kept ﬁxed and 1
is varied. X.1; 2/ will then trace a curve, and a tangent vector to it may be then
deﬁned:
X.1; 2/
ˇˇˇ
2 ﬁxed;
tangent vector W
d1X D @X
@1 d1:
(3.2.1)
Similarly, for 1 kept ﬁxed and 2 is varied, X.1; 2/ will then trace a curve, and
a tangent vector to it may be then deﬁned:
X.1; 2/
ˇˇˇ
1 ﬁxed;

d2X D @X

In analogy to an oriented surface in 3 dimensional Euclidean space
.d1X  d2X/i D " ij k d1Xj d2Xk;
(3.2.3)
an oriented two-dimensional surface element may be deﬁned in a D dimensional
Minkowski space by
d1:::D2 D ϵ1:::D2  d1X d2X;
(3.2.4)
where ϵ1:::D is totally anti-symmetric with ϵ01:::.D1/ D 1.
Due to the antisymmetry of ϵ 1:::D , one and only one of its indices must be
zero, i.e., ϵ1:::D D  ϵ 1:::D , where we recall that we are working in Minkowski
spacetime. Using the identity

(3.2.9)
Since the scalar product of a timelike vector with itself has the opposite sign of
the scalar product of a spacelike vector with itself, the expression under the square
root sign in the integrand in (3.2.8) is non-negative. The presence of the minus sign
multiplying the integral in (3.2.8) will become clear below.
Clearly, the dimension of T in (3.2.8) is energy per unit length. As for the
situation with a particle, let us examine a non-relativistic limit of this action. To this
end, consider a string for which @X=@ D .0; @X=@/  .0; X0/, i.e., @t=@ D 0,
meaning that the string moves in such a way that all the clocks set at each point on
it are always synchronized. This leads with, v D PX, to

where t, is the coordinate time, i.e., t D X 0=c as determined in the “laboratory”

where N D X0=jX0j, speciﬁes a unit vector along the vector X0 at a point  on the
string. Then we note that the transverse velocity vtrans D Œv  N.v  N/, satisﬁes
.vtrans/2 D Œv  N.v  N/2 D Œv2  .v  N/2:

Note the minus sign within the square brackets above. We see that the string moves
with a transverse velocity with an associated mass per unit length m, and a potential
energy, given, respectively, by
m D TjX0j

Pot: En: D

(3.2.14)
Since jX0jd D j@X=@jd is an inﬁnitesimal change of length of the string, the
factor T is interpreted as the tension in the string, as the energy responsible of
stretching the string per unit length. In turn, we see that the origin of the mass of the
string is due to its inherit tension. The above equation also justiﬁes the introduction
of the minus sign multiplying the integral in (3.2.8).
The action in (3.2.8) is called the Nambu-Goto action [15, 31]. Further analysis
of this action is given next.
3.2.2
The String Sigma Model Action: Curved Nature
of the Worldsheet
We will re-express the Nambu-Goto action in (3.2.8) in a way that it does not involve
the square root sign in the integrand by following a procedure similar to the one
carried out for a point particle in Sect. 3.1.1. From now on we work with natural
units, with, in particular, c D 1.

from (3.2.16), the expression under the square root in (3.2.8) is equal to h. Using
the expression of the connecting formulae of induced metric h˛ˇ with its inverse

(3.2.21)
Instead of working with the action in (3.2.8), involving the square root expres-
sion, one may consider, anew, an equivalent action integral depending in addition to
X, the h˛ˇ, and vary these variables independently. This is easy to do provided one
uses the following formula for the variation of a determinant h D deth, given and

to (3.2.20). On the other hand, to carry out the variation with respect to h˛ˇ we may
use the identity

(3.2.26)
by a direct application of (3.2.24). The equality to zero on the extreme right-hand
side of (3.2.26) is a consequence of (3.2.21) which now follows from the action
in (3.2.23). That the energy-momentum tensor is zero is of no surprise, since the
action in (3.2.23) does not include an additional term corresponding to a dynamical
equation (no kinetic energy expression) for h˛ˇ.
The action W in (3.2.23) is referred to as the “String Sigma Model Action” and
has the names of many authors associated with it, notably Polyakov, Deser, Zumino,
Brink, Di Vecchia and many others.
In the next section we will see that a particular gauge may be found to simplify
the expression of the action considerably.

Parametrization Independence and the Light-Cone

The string sigma model action in (3.2.23) may be simpliﬁed quite a bit. We

the induced metric Œ h˛ˇ , on the worldsheet of a string, may be reduced to a ﬂat

For a Minkowski metric in 2D, the ﬁeld equations in (3.2.20) read

to zero.
The re-parametrization, via coordinate transformations, and Weyl scaling to
bring the worldsheet induced metric h˛ˇ to the Minkowski form, as a gauge choice,
is referred to as the conformal gauge.
It is convenient to re-express the ﬁeld equations in terms of light-cone variables:

This allows one to choose  0 as one of the ﬁelds in (3.2.31), corresponding to a

more precisely as a linear function of the latter:  0 D c1 C c 2 X C where c1; c 2,

A simple model may be provided to obtain further insight on the signiﬁcance of
the parameter ˛0 in (3.2.46). Consider a straight string of length L rotating about
its midpoint with its end points moving at the speed of light. At a point r from its
center, the speed, as a function of r, is given by v.r/ D r=.L=2/. Now for a point
particle of mass m moving with speed v, its energy is given by p 0 D m=.1  v2/1=2.
Accordingly, the energy of the string E and its angular momentum J are given,
respectively, by

This spacetime “background”, where the end points of the string are restricted,
deﬁnes an extended object referred to as a D brane of spatial dimensionality p and
is denoted by D p-brane.
According to this last boundary condition, the end of the strings are restricted to
the brane and free to move and “slide” only on this object. For p D D  1, the D
brane is referred to as spacetime ﬁlling . The letter D stands for Dirichlet and the
nomenclature “brane” is derived from the word membrane. The subject of D branes
will be taken up in Sect. 3.4.

massless particle. In D dimensions, a vector particle, with D  2 degrees of freedom
is a massless particle—the photon. A detailed analysis of the degrees of freedom
of massless ﬁelds in higher dimensions are derived in Sect. 3.2.9. Accordingly, the
right-hand side of (3.2.95) must be zero and leads to the critical dimension of

of degrees of freedom and the masslessness of the particle (described by a vector
ﬁeld) determine the dimensionality of the underlying spacetime of the theory.
The next states are massive and are obtained by the applications of ˛ i.2/ and

be enormous, and the analysis may be carried out further to higher massive states. In
such cases, only the massless excitation may be expected to be physically relevant at
present available energies acquiring masses by some mechanism. Such a mechanism
to generate a massive vector boson will be described later when dealing with branes.

In order to generate several gauge ﬁelds, as is necessarily required in particle
physics, the end of the open strings may be assumed to carry certain degrees of
freedom referred to as Chan-Paton degrees of freedom. That is, the ends of the
strings may exist in any of these “charge” states. One may label these states by a
pair of indices a; b D 1; 2; : : : ; N corresponding to the two ends of a string: The
ends of the strings will have associated with them the matrices of a gauge group
(Fig. 3.4).
The ground-state would then carry two indices a; b : j 0I p 0; abi, specifying, as
well, the states of the end points of the string. As the indices a; b take each N possible
values, this provides a way to generate N 2 gauge ﬁelds associated with the states
a i.1/ j 0I p 0; abi corresponding to a U.N/ gauge symmetry. Here we recall that the
group U.N/ consists of all N by N unitary complex matrices and may be generated
by N2 independent matrices.

independent components, where the ﬁrst term denotes the number of independent
components of a symmetric tensor and the minus one is due to the fact that one of the
elements on the diagonal may be determined in terms of the sum of the other .D3/
ones on the diagonal. This necessarily implies that the particle associated with it is
massless and represents the graviton in D-dimensional spacetime as analyzed in
detail in Sect. 3.2.9. From (3.2.121) we then conclude that the critical dimension of
spacetime, again, is D D 26. Thus we learn once more that the number of degrees
of freedom and the masslessness of the particle (described by a symmetric tensor
ﬁeld) determine the dimensionality of the underlying spacetime of the theory.
For a D 2, corresponding to

we are dealing with an anti-symmetric tensor, which has

we have a scalar, that is with one degree of freedom, and is referred to as the dilation.

(3.2.124)

out of two vectors of D  2 dimensions is written in a group theoretical notation as

Unoriented String Theories and Chan-Paton Degrees
of Freedom
Consider the worldsheet parity transformation, deﬁned by

(3.2.127)
After the above transformation is carried out, the direction of increase of  for the
given

From the expression of the worldsheet ﬁelds X i.
; / in (3.2.76), for the closed
bosonic string, one may infer that their two Fourier coefﬁcients are interchanged
under a worldsheet parity transformation
˝ ˛ i.n/ ˝1 D N˛ i.n/;
(3.2.128)
or equivalently one interchanges its right- and left-movers. The states of the string
theories considered earlier, however, are not invariant under the parity operation,
assuming the invariance of the ground-state ˝j 0I p 0i D j 0I p 0i. For example, the
anti-symmetric state
D  2
X
k; `D1
C2
i kj ` ˛ k.1/ N˛ `.1/ j 0I p 0i;
in (3.2.120)/(3.2.118), gives the eigenvalue ˝ D 1. By restricting these theories
only to ˝-invariant states, one generates theories which are referred to as unoriented
string theories, while the earlier ones as oriented ones. In general, one may deﬁne
the orientation of a worldsheet as the direction of increasing  for ﬁxed 
. Referring
to the zero mass modes of the closed strings just mentioned, the antisymmetric state,
corresponding to the Kalb-Ramond ﬁeld just given above is then projected out of the
spectrum in the process of deﬁning an unoriented bosonic string.
The situation dealing with open unoriented strings is a bit more involved. The
transformation in (3.2.127) interchanges the end points of the string. Here we note
that the expression of the ﬁelds for the open strings in (3.2.58) imply that under

As in the oriented open strings, we may consider the end of the open strings to carry
Chan-Paton degrees of freedom. That is, the ends of the strings may exist in any of
these “charge” states (see Fig. 3.4). One may label these states by a pair of indices
a; b D 1; 2; : : : ; N corresponding to the two ends of a string. The strings ends will
have associated with them matrices of a gauge group. The ground-state would then
carry two indices a; b: j 0I p 0; a bi, specifying, as well, the states of the end points
of the string.
We consider the action of the worldsheet parity operation on the states which
interchanges the Chan-Paton labels via a unitary operator 
˝ W j0I p 0; a bi ! aa 0 j0I p 0; b 0a 0i  1

Introduction to String Theory
Referring to the massless vector ﬁeld state in (3.2.95), we note from (3.2.129)
that a i.1/
!  a i.1/. Hence in order that the states a i.1/ j 0I p 0; i be
invariant under the worldsheet parity transformation, i.e.,
˝ ai.1/ j 0I p 0; i
D a i.1/ j 0I p 0; i, it is necessary that 0 D . This implies from (3.2.135)
that
  C > D 0:
(3.2.136)
An obvious solution, corresponding to  D > in (3.2.132), is  D I, which,
from (3.2.136), implies that the Hermitian  matrices are antisymmetric. That is,
the  matrices, generate the group SO.N/ with group elements O D e, with
O O> D I and det O D eTr D 1. The number of gauge ﬁelds generated then is
N.N  1/=2.
A solution, corresponding to  D  > in (3.2.132), is provided by the group
USp.N/ (read symplectic group), with N restricted to be even, which we deﬁne as
involving generators given by N N Hermitian matrices  satisfying (3.2.136) with
the unitary matrix  given by

;
B D B>;
C D C>;
D D A>:
Thus the number of independent elements of A; B; C, in general, are : N2=4,
N.N=2 C 1/=4, N.N=2 C 1/=4, respectively. Adding up, this leads to the generation
of N.N C 1/=2 gauge ﬁelds.

Compactiﬁcation and T-Duality: Closed Strings
We consider the compactiﬁcation of one of the extra spatial component, say, X 25,
of a bosonic string into a circle of radius R. In this respect, the light-cone variables
may be deﬁned by
X ˙ D .X 0 ˙ X 24/=
p
2;
X i; i D 1; : : : ; 23;
and the compactiﬁed dimension, X 25 will be denoted by X. We will see, that there
arises a duality, referred to as T-duality in the analysis, which relates two theories
with compactiﬁed extra dimension into a circle of radius R and one into a circle of
radius ˛ 0=R. In particular, the application of T-duality to open strings, as will be
seen in the next section, introduces necessarily the concept of D branes which were
brieﬂy mentioned in Sect. 3.2.4. We ﬁrst consider closed strings.

3.2
Bosonic Strings
225
For the closed string, the boundary condition for the extra dimension compacti-
ﬁed into a circle of radius R becomes
X.
;  C 	/ D X.
; / C 2	 R w;
(3.2.138)
replacing the boundary condition for X 25  X in (3.2.51), where w denotes
the winding number, indicating that the string can wind around the compactiﬁed
dimension any number of times, with w taking positive integer values for winding
in a certain direction and negative ones in the opposite one. The value w D 0
corresponds to no winding.
For a closed string, we have obtained in (3.2.72), the general expression for X i,
and in particular for X 25  X we have

The mass-squared operator in (3.2.149),including the constraint in (3.2.152) may
be expressed in a convenient way as

R C .N R  1/;
(3.2.153)
where, in the process of writing this equation, we have used (3.2.145).
Imposing single valuedness for the translation of a state in the x direction by 2	R,
via the operator exp Œ i x p , leads to the quantization of the momentum eigenvalues
to p 25 D k=R for integers k, called the Kaluza-Klein excitation number. The
expression for the mass operator in (3.2.149), may be then spelled out as
M 2 D k 2
R 2 C w 2 R 2

C 2
˛0 .N L C N R  2/:
(3.2.154)
The mass-squared operator is invariant under the simultaneous interchange w $
k, and R $ eR D ˛ 0=R referred to as T-duality. For the critical value R D
p
˛ 0,
the radius R is transformed into itself and is called the self-dual radius. Each radius
smaller than R is equivalent to some radius larger than R for the interchange of
the winding number w, and the Kaluza-Klein excitation number k.
Ground states of the compactiﬁed closed string may be determined by consid-
ering, in the process, states speciﬁed by j k; w; p 0i, where p 0 D . pC; p1; : : : ; p23/,
subject to the constraint (3.2.152). For N L D 0 D N R, the constraint is satisﬁed
if .k D 0 or w D 0/, or .k D w D 0/, remembering that p 25 D k=R. In the latter
case, j 0; 0; p 0i corresponds to a tachyonic state with mass squared 4=˛ 0. For the
former cases, one has the states j 0; w; p 0i, and j k; 0; p 0i corresponding to scalar
ﬁelds, with masses squared

respectively, and may or may not be tachyonic depending on the size of the radius R.
For k D 0 D w, and N L

one deﬁnes states of a graviton, an anti-symmetric second rank tensor ﬁeld, and a
scalar ﬁeld—the dilaton. Before we had no vector ﬁelds for the closed string, now
we encounter two vector ﬁelds at this stage.

Introduction to String Theory
For k D w D ˙1, N R  N L D 1, with the lowest-mass states for N R D 1,
N L D 0, we are led to consider the states
a.1/ j˙1; ˙1; p 0i;
ai.1/ j˙1; ˙1; p 0i
(3.2.159)
Similarly, for k D w D 1, N R  N L D 1, with the lowest-mass states for
N R D 0, N L D 1, we are led to consider the states
Na.1/ j1; ˙1; p 0i;
Na i.1/ j1; ˙1; p 0ij1; p 0i;
(3.2.160)
with all these eight states in (3.2.159), (3.2.160) corresponding to masses-squared
equal to .1=R  R=˛ 0/2. Thus for the self-dual radius R D R D
p
˛ 0,
a.1/ j˙1; ˙1; p 0i;
Na.1/ j1; ˙1; p 0i;
describe four massless scalar ﬁelds. On the other hand, the states
a i.1/ j˙1; ˙1; p 0i;
Nai.1/ j1; ˙1; p 0i;
describe four massless vector ﬁelds. Hence with the states in (3.2.157), we have 6
massless vector ﬁelds as the gauge ﬁelds of the symmetry group SU.2/  SU.2/,
with k D w for one set, and k D w, for a second. Here we recall that SU.2/
denotes the group of 2 by 2 matrices of determinant one, involving three generators.
The product SU.2/SU.2/ means that the two groups act independently, with each
involving three generators, they correspond to a total of 6 gauge ﬁelds.

dimensionality of the D brane is 24, and it is referred to as a D p-brane with p D 24.
Thus one sees that T-duality necessarily implies the existence of D branes.
T-duality has transformed the string with a Neumann boundary condition into a
Dirichlet boundary condition. The subject of D branes will be taken up in Sect. 3.4.
The next section deals with superstring theory. Before moving on to the next
section, we may pose and consider in some details all of the massless ﬁelds that have
emerged from bosonic string theory and study several of their properties including
their associated degrees of freedom.
3.2.9
All the Fundamental Massless Fields in Bosonic String
Theory
We now consider some technical aspects of all the massless ﬁelds encountered in
bosonic string theory. We work in arbitrary dimensions D of spacetime.25
Scalar Field
Here there is nothing new. The Lagrangian density is given by
L D  1

where for greater generality we have included an external source. The ﬁeld
equation is

(3.2.168)
with the scalar ﬁeld involving only one state.

where a sum over i D 1; 2; : : : ; D  1 understood. Greek indices ; ; : : : go over

We add an external source contribution to (3.2.169), obtaining
L D  1
4FF C JA; :
(3.2.171)
Due to the constraint in (3.2.170) not all the components of A may be varied

Clearly only the A i may propagate. Also i D 1; : : : ; D  1, but due to the constraint
in (3.2.170), which is also satisﬁed in (3.2.173), the number of states of the massless
vector ﬁeld is reduced to D  2.
Another but equivalent way of counting the number of states of the massless
vector ﬁeld, is to work in the momentum description and use a completeness relation
in terms of polarization vectors

Clearly, only the hij may propagate. Now a symmetric matrix hij has .D  1/D=2
independent components. However, for T D 0, we have the constraint hii D 0 and
the D  1 constraints @ihij D 0. Thus the number of states of this massless ﬁeld is
.D  1/D=2  1  .D  1/ D D.D  3/=2. Note that for T D 0, h  D 0.

Worldsheet Supersymmetry and the String Action
The basic properties of the theta spinors in (3.3.17), and the completeness of the

the sequel in the action in (3.3.32) as well, is that not only there is no interaction
between the ﬁelds but the ﬁeld equation for B, implies that the latter is trivially zero

combinations, T00 C T01 D 0, T00  T01 D 0, and T01 D 0, respectively as obtained
from the expression of the energy-momentumtensor in (3.3.35) (see Problems 3.17).

independent of .

the .NS/ boundary condition, clearly  C D 0, for such a boundary condition. On

D 0 to be 10, with the number of degrees of freedom of
the vector particle being equal to 8. Again we learn that the number of degrees of
freedom and the masslessness of the particle (described by a vector ﬁeld) determine
the dimensionality of the underlying spacetime of the theory.
There seems to be also a tachyonic state with negative mass squared 1=.2˛ 0/
which, however, by invoking the necessary supersymmetry restriction that the
number of fermion states is equal to the of bosonic states, this state is automatically
eliminated as we will see later.

where the zero point energies cancel out.
A key point which follows from (3.3.63) and distinguishes an R boundary
condition from a NS one, is that the former involves the index r taking the value
zero in the Fourier mode expansions of the spinor ﬁelds [see (3.3.64)] generating
the Hermitian coefﬁcients d i.0/ of zero mode. We will see how these coefﬁcients
play a major role in deﬁning the ground-states for an R boundary condition.
To investigate the nature of the ground-state of superstrings associated with the
R boundary condition, we consider the following well paused problem.
To the above end, given the following anti-commutation relations (a Clifford
algebra) satisﬁed by the set of the Hermitian operators d i.0/

We note that the states with negative/positive chirality correspond to an odd/even
number of creation operators applied to the Fock vacuum, since k in (3.3.97) denotes
the number of I taking the value 1=2 thus providing a non-vanishing power of one
for a corresponding creation operator.

Introduction to String Theory
Now we have to look for a fermion, for the R boundary condition, with
corresponding degrees of freedom to match the vector particle observed above, in
the NS boundary condition, in the light of supersymmetry.
The simultaneous eigenstates of M 2 and of the operators  1; : : : ;  4, deﬁne
degenerate ground-states, which may be labeled by the eigenvalues of the latter
operators. Each of these eigenvalues take on two values (see (3.3.94), with
I D ˙1=2) generating 16 eigenstates which are annihilated by the non-negative
operators M 2 in (3.3.88) leading to a 16-fold degenerate ground-state energy. By
referring to (3.3.98), we denote the two sets of these ground states with deﬁnite
chiralities by fj 

of a massless chiral ﬁeld with 8 degrees of freedom. These states are precisely the
ones annihilated by the (non-negative) mass operator in (3.3.88). These states are
then the lowest lying states with the R boundary condition.

To summarise, the massless excitation of an open superstring with an R boundary
condition, and a given chirality, is a chiral Fermion with 8 degrees of freedom
and matches the number of degrees freedom of the massless vector particle
corresponding to a NS boundary condition. What about the tachyon state observed
and discussed below (3.3.87) corresponding to the NS boundary condition?
By invoking the necessary condition for the equality of the fermionic and bosonic
degrees of freedom as imposed by supersymmetry, we will see that this tachyonic
state may be eliminated. For one thing, one may restrict to ground-states with a
given chirality for the R boundary condition and thus having 8 degrees of freedom
for the massless (chiral) fermion states. We have seen above in (3.3.98), that ground-
states, with negative chirality correspond to the application of an odd number of
fermion creation operator. If one simultaneously restricts the application of an odd
number of fermion operators for the NS boundary condition, not only the condition
of supersymmetry is achieved, with the equality of the number of fermionic and

That is supersymmetry eliminates the tachyon. This ingenious method is referred to
as the GSO projection32 method. This is applied next.

with 56 degrees of freedom (the gravitino), with a total of 8  8 D 64 states, with
necessarily zero mass particles. With a ¤ b, these states are of opposite chiralities
in the two sectors. The fundamental massless fermion ﬁelds of superstring theory
are analyzed in detail in Sect. 3.3.8 including the determination of the underlying
degrees of freedom.
(R; R) Boundary Condition
To describe the (R; R) sector and investigate the mass spectrum of related super-
strings, we consider ﬁrst the following well paused problem.
The direct product of two matrices B D Œ Bij  and A D Œ Aij , B  A, is deﬁned
as follows. Write down the matrix A in detail in terms of its matrix elements and
multiply each of its elements by the matrix B, i.e.,

 8 D i I  I  I  1
(3.3.137)
where I is the 2 by 2 unit matrix. From (3.3.134),the square of each of these matrices
is equal to minus one. For each pair of matrices  i,  j, i ¤ j, each matrix at the same
respective location in the direct product of the pair commute with the exception of
one matrix in the same location of the pair anti-commute. For example, for the
pair of matrices  1,  2, only the second matrices from the left, that is 2, and 1,
respectively, anti-commute, and all the other ones at the same respective locations
commute, i.e., from (3.3.136), f 1;  2g D 0. Hence we have the anti-commutation
relations

is that the product of more than 4 gamma matrices with  may be expressed as the
product of fewer gamma matrices. We will make use of these results to investigate
the nature of the (R; R) sector.

We consider two inequivalent superstrings. One type where the right and left
ground-states have opposite chiralities. These are called Type IIA theories, and
another type for which they have the same chirality and are referred to as Type
IIB theories.
For Type IIA theories we write:

having each 16 components, by simply extending the values taken by ;  0. Their

where we have used (3.3.143) and the second identity in (3.3.140), we learn, by
comparing the ﬁrst expression with the last, that only an odd number of gamma

3.3
Superstrings
261
matrices contribute to the above matrix elements. Finally invoking the last identity
in (3.3.140), we may infer that only one or three gamma matrices need to be
considered. On the other hand, the contraction of any two indices of the product of
three gamma matrices generates a single gamma matrix, which is already accounted
for, i.e., we are led to anti-symmetrize the product of the three gamma matrices so
that the contraction of any two of its indices is zero.
Hence we conclude that in the
(R; R) sector for the Type IIA superstrings,
having opposite chiralities of the left and right R ground states, the massless ﬁelds
are a vector ﬁeld Ai, corresponding to Lh 1 j i j 2iR, with 8 degrees of freedom,
and an anti-symmetric ﬁeld Aij k, corresponding to Lh 1 j  Œ i j k  j  2i R, with
56 degrees of freedom, where  Œ i j k  means to anti-symmetrize over the i; j; k
indices.
For Type IIB superstrings, where the left and right R ground states are taken to
have the same chirality, we may write:
Œ j  1i L  D

j  1
1i L; j  1

or equivalently as,

2 i R; j  2 0

>.
A similar analysis as in the previous case shows that only an even number of
gamma matrices contribute to the matrix elements (no sum over a):
Lh a j i1 : : :  ik j ai R;
since the latter equals
Lh a j i1 : : :  ik 2 j ai R D .1/kLh a j i1 : : :  ik j aiR;
k must be even. This leads to the conclusion that the massless ﬁelds are a scalar
A, corresponding to Lh a j ai R, with one degree of freedom, an antisymmetric
ﬁeld Aij, corresponding to Lh a j  Œ i j  j  ai R, with 28 degrees of freedom,
and an anti-symmetric fourth rank (self-dual) tensor ﬁeld Aij k l corresponding to
Lh a j  Œ i j k l  j  ai R, with 35 degrees of freedom. Here we note that for
the fourth rank tensor ﬁeld Aij k l for all disjoint sets fi; j; k; lg, fi 0; j 0; k 0; l 0g, with
unequal elements, Aij k l D ˙ Ai 0j 0k 0l 0 deﬁning a self-duality condition. Additional
details on this as well as on all the massless ﬁelds in superstring theory will be given
in Sects. 3.3.8 and 3.3.9.
The various types of superstrings are considered next.

Introduction to String Theory
3.3.6
Types of Superstrings: I, II and Heterotic
In this section we consider the various types of superstrings. Oriented open
superstrings were considered in Sect. 3.3.4, and the oriented closed Type IIA, Type
IIB superstrins were treated in Sect. 3.3.5. There are also Type I and the so-called
heterotic superstrings. The zero-mass modes of all these strings will be summarized
as we go along. At low energies, the massless ﬁelds are the most signiﬁcant ones
to consider. Details of both massless fermion ﬁelds of superstring theory are given
in Sect. 3.3.8, including the determination of the associated number of degrees of
freedom. Details of all the massless bosonic ﬁelds of superstring theory are given
in Sect. 3.3.9 (see also Sect. 3.2.9). We urge the reader to consult these subsections.
There are no tachyonic states in these strings. We begin with the study of Type I
superstrings.
 Type I Superstrings
The theory of Type I superstrings is a generalization of the theory of unoriented
bosonic strings treated in Sect. 3.2.6 and involves states which are invariant under
the worldsheet parity operation ˝. The latter operates on the worldsheet of a string
by effectively changing their  argument to 	  .
For closed strings, one may ﬁnd the states of the theory directly from those states
of Type IIB superstrings, which are ˝ - invariant, rather than from the Type IIA
superstrings as their R ground-states are different being of opposite chirality. Here
we have the transformations:
˛.n/ $
N˛.n/;
b i.r/ $ Nb i.r/;
d i.r/ $ Nd i.r/;
j NSiR $ j NSiL;
j  iR $ j  iL :
The zero-mass modes are then as follows:
.NS; NS/-sector: a scalar (dilaton) with one state, and a second rank traceless
tensor, the graviton, with 35 number of states. The anti-symmetric second rank
tensor ﬁeld being eliminated exactly in the same way as in our study of the
unoriented bosonic string given in Sect. 3.2.6.
Under the ˝ operation, the sectors .NSL; RR/ and .RL; NSR/ are interchanged,
thus one only picks up even combinations of their corresponding states. In particular,
we obtain from (3.3.128), (3.3.129), the invariant linear combination for the zero
mass mode:
Nb i.1=2/j  
ai R j NSi L j 0I p 0i C b i.1=2/j  
bi L j NSi R j 0I p 0i:

3.3
Superstrings
263
Hence we may infer that for the zero mass states one has only one chiral spin ﬁeld
(dilatino) with 8 number of states, and only one Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld (gravitino)
with 56 number of states, instead of having two of each as was the case for Type II.
The number of massless bosonic states obtained so far is 1 C 35 D 36, while the
number of fermionic states obtained was 8 C 56 D 64. Thus we conclude that only
the second anti-symmetric ﬁeld, with 28 number of states, survives in the .R; R/-
sector, with the scalar and fourth rank anti-symmetric tensor ﬁelds are eliminated.
For open strings, as for the bosonic case in Sect. 3.2.6, we consider that the end
points of a string involve Chan-Paton factors. With the underlying gauge group
SO.N/ with N D 32 D 2D=2; D D 10, we may infer directly from the open
superstrings treated in Sect. 3.3.4 that the zero-mass modes are as follows:
NS-sector: vector particle with 8  N.N  1/=2 states.
R-sector : chiral spinor with 8  N.N  1/=2 states. 
Oriented Open Superstrings
These oriented open superstrings were treated in Sect. 3.3.4 with the following zero-
mass modes:
NS-sector: vector particle with eight states.
R-sector : chiral spinor with eight states.
 Type IIA Superstrings
These oriented closed superstrings were treated in Sect. 3.3.5 with the following
zero-mass modes :
.NS; NS/-sector: a scalar (dilaton) with one state, an antisymmetric second rank
tensor ﬁeld, with 28 number of states, and a traceless symmetric second rank
tensor (graviton), with 35 number of states.
.NSL; RR/-sector: chiral Dirac ﬁeld (dilatino), with eight number of states, a
Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld (gravitino), with 56 number of states.
.RL; NSR/-sector: chiral Dirac ﬁeld (dilatino), with 8 number of states, a Rarita-
Schwinger ﬁeld (gravitino), with 56 number of states.
.R; R/-sector : vector ﬁeld, with 8 number of states, and an anti-symmetric third
rank tensor ﬁeld, with 56 number of states, with the right and left ground-states
of opposite chiralities. 
 Type IIB Superstrings
These oriented closed superstrings were also treated in Sect. 3.3.5 with the following
zero-mass modes :
.NS; NS/-sector: a scalar (dilaton) with one state, an antisymmetric second rank
tensor ﬁeld, with 28 number of states, and a traceless symmetric second rank
tensor (graviton), with 35 number of states.

.NSL; RR/-sector: chiral Dirac ﬁeld (dilatino), with eight number of states, a

.RL; NSR/-sector: chiral Dirac ﬁeld (dilatino), with eight number of states, a
Rarita-Schwinger ﬁeld (gravitino), with 56 number of states.
.R; R/-sector : scalar ﬁeld, with 1 number of states, and an anti-symmetric second
rank tensor ﬁeld, with 28 number of states, and a fourth rank anti-symmetric
ﬁeld, with 35 number of states, with the right and left ground-states of the same
chiralities. 
Now we come to a very interesting type of superstrings, referred to as heterotic
strings. These are closed oriented superstrings for which the right-movers are the
ones already considered for the Type II superstrings, in 10 dimensions, while the
left-movers are those of the bosonic strings in 26 dimensions, with 16 of the
spatial dimensions compactiﬁed on a torus, to match the 10 dimensions involving
the right-movers. The name heterotic is quite appropriate for these strings as they
mix together two theories which are different. The expression for the mass-squared
operator is easily obtained from our earlier expressions, as we will see, and is given
below.
 Heterotic Superstrings
Let the index i run from 1 to 8, and the index I run from 10 to 25. The index I
speciﬁes the 16 dimensions that are being compactiﬁed. The light-cone ﬁelds X ˙,
for example, may be then deﬁned in this case by
X ˙ D .X 0 ˙ X 9/=
p

Clearly, we have two sectors to consider, the NSR-sector, and the RR-sector. In
reference to the left-movers, as it is obtained from the bosonic string, we may refer
to the ﬁrst equality in (3.2.153)/(A-3.4), for the compactiﬁed bosonic part of the
string corresponding to the left-movers, together with the expression given in the
second equality in (3.3.126) corresponding to the right-movers, to obtain for the
NSR-sector :

For the NS R-sector, we have two cases corresponding to M 2 D 0 :

b i.1=2/˛I.1/ j NSiR j 0; ˛ 0p 2

corresponding to a vector, with 8  16 number of states, where we have labeled
the bosonic states by ˛ 0p 2
L, and p 0 D . p C; p 1; : : : ; p 8/. We also have the states
b i.1=2/˛ j.1/ j NSi R j 0; ˛ 0p 2
L D 0I p 0iL;
corresponding to a scalar with 1 number of states, an anti-symmetric second rank

Case 2: ˛ 0p 2
L D 1, N R D 1=2; N L D 0, giving the states
b i.1=2/ j NSiR j 0; ˛ 0p 2
L D 1I p0iL;
and with a gauge group SO.32/, we will see that the degree of degeneracy bd of
j 0; ˛ 0p 2
L D 1I p 0iL is 480. That is the number of states of the vector ﬁeld, just
given, is 8  480.
For the R R-sector, in order that M 2 D 0, we have the following cases :
Case 1 : ˛ 0p 2

Introduction to String Theory
corresponding to a chiral spinor (dilatino), with 8 number of states, and a Rarita-

L D 1, eN R D 0; N L D 0, giving the state
j  i R j 0; ˛ 0p 2
L D 1I p 0i L;
with a degree of degeneracy of 480. To obtain this degree of degeneracy, note that
the number of vector ﬁelds with gauge group SO.32/ is 32.32  1/=2 D 496. In
Cases 1 and 2 in the NSR-sector above, we have found .16 C bd / vector ﬁelds
which must add up to 496 vector ﬁelds, from which the degree of degeneracy bd
follows. These 8 components vector ﬁelds taken all together are gauge ﬁelds of
the group SO.32/, with the underlying string theory referred to as Heterotic-O, or
its T-dual, referred to as Heterotic-E, with a gauge group denoted by E8  E8. The
string can wind itself on the torus in nontrivial conﬁgurations leading eventually
to the total 496 states. The compactiﬁcation leads to the quantization of p 2
L, [Note
that some authors set `2 D 1 and hence, from (3.2.46), effectively set ˛0 D 1=2.]

Type I, including open and closed superstrings, Type IIA, Type IIB together with
the oriented open superstrings, and ﬁnally the two heterotic (closed) superstrings
Heterotic-O, and Heterotic-E, constitute the ﬁve basic superstring theories.35 Rela-
tions are expected to exist between them. This is discussed in the next section.
3.3.7
Duality of Superstrings and M-Theory
Type IIA string theory is the T-dual of Type IIB and versa. The reason is that
T-duality reverses the relative chiralities of the right- and left-movers. To see
this, suppose that X1 is compactiﬁed along a circle of radius R. In reference
to (3.3.73), (3.3.75)/(3.3.76), under a T-duality transformation,

by deﬁnition. The last transformation, as applied to the spinor, arises as a conse-
quence of invoking supersymmetry as an immediate extension of the bosonic one.
That is, in particular,
Nd 1.0/ ! Nd 1.0/;
d 1.0/ !  d 1.0/:
(3.3.154)
Using the notation d i.0/  d i, one may infer from the deﬁnition of the chirality
operator36: d D .2 i/nd 1d 2: : : d 2n, that under a T-duality transformation, d !  d,
reversing the chirality of right movers. Thus if one starts with Type IIA string theory
for which, by deﬁnition, the left- and right moving ground-states have opposite
chirality, then under a T-duality transformation, the ground-states will have the same
chirality thus transforming it to Type IIB and vice versa.
A more complicated argument establishes a similar kind of interchange exists
between Heterotic-O and Heterotic-E theories thus they are also related by T-duality.
Starting from Type IIB theory, we recall that Type I is obtained by restricting the
theory to states which are invariant under the worldsheet parity transformation ˝.
Now under a T-duality transformation because of the constraint set, in particular,
by the ˝ operation, the extra dimension is compactiﬁed on an interval instead of a
circle. The resulting theory is referred to as Type I0 theory. [The latter is sometimes
referred to as Type IA and the former as Type IB.]
An interesting theory in development, referred to as M-theory, believed to be
approximated by 11 dimensional supergravity in the low energy limit, and is based
on a non-perturbative approach which involves an eleventh dimension as well. The
reason why an eleventh dimension was not encountered in the earlier sections, is that
they were based only on free strings theories as basic ingredients for perturbative
analyses. Duality allows this more general theory to be linked to other superstring
theories. For example, compactiﬁcation of M-theory on a circle of small radius leads
to Type IIA theory.
A duality, referred to as S-duality, relates theories with strong coupling to
theories with weak coupling. For example, on may argue that the strong coupling
limit of Type IIA theory is described by M-theory, and that the strong coupling limit
of Heterotic-O string theory is related to Type I string theory.
Figure 3.6 provides a formal picture that seems to be emerging showing
duality transformations between various theories: where T0 refers to T-duality with
compactiﬁcation on an interval.

Introduction to String Theory
Fig. 3.6 Duality transformations envisaged between various theories
In the compactiﬁcation process in Heterotic string theory of the bosonic part with
16 extra dimensions, it was implicitly assumed that the compactiﬁcation was carried
out on a torus. The simplicity in toroidal compactiﬁcation is, in general, the fact
that a torus is locally ﬂat, and thus one is involved with the periodic identiﬁcations
of ﬂat dimensions in the compactiﬁcation process. A modiﬁcation of toroidal
compactiﬁcation, is compactiﬁcation on an orbifold which is a six dimensional
space obtained by the identiﬁcation of points on the toroid which are mapped into
one another by some speciﬁc discrete symmetries of the torus, deﬁning the point
group. This gives the possibly of producing four dimensional theories with only one
supersymmetry charge operator instead of several supersymmetry charge operators
as encountered in the toroidal one. The orbifold, however, involves singularities at
such identiﬁed ﬁxed points. A further generalization of this method is by far the
more complicated Calabi-Yau compactiﬁcation which provides a manifold avoiding
such singularities. We recall the rather intuitive deﬁnition of a manifold as being
locally Euclidean and may be covered by patches with mappings which map points
in the patches to points in Euclidean space, and if two patches overlap, one has a
smooth transformation from one of the coordinates to the other in the corresponding
subsets of the Euclidean space. Unfortunately, the Calabi-Yau compactiﬁcation is
not unique.
At this stage we pose and consider all the massless ﬁelds that have emerged
from superstring theory and study some of their properties such as their associated
degrees of freedom.

The Dirac Equation in Ten Dimensions
A simple way to derive the Dirac equation in ten dimensions, is to follow our
procedure in deriving the corresponding cases in two dimensions in Sect. 3.3.1.
Upon multiplying the equation: . p0 

we obtain
p2  1 D . p02  m2/  1;

where p is 9 dimensional. From the ﬁrst relation in (3.3.158), the latter may be
rewritten as
   p   p  1 D . p 02  m 2/  1:

All the Fundamental Massless Bosonic Fields
in Superstring Theory
The types of all bosonic massless ﬁelds in superstring theory we encountered were:
a fourth rank (self-dual) anti-symmetric tensor ﬁeld, a third rank anti-symmetric
tensor ﬁeld, a second rank anti-symmetric tensor ﬁeld, a traceless second rank

symmetric tensor ﬁeld, a vector ﬁeld, and ﬁnally a scalar ﬁeld. In this subsection,40
we work in 10 dimensions, not only because of the consistency requirement in
superstring theory, but also in order to take into account of the self-duality character
of the fourth rank anti-symmetric tensor ﬁeld as spelled out below.
The scalar, the vector, and both second rank tensor ﬁelds, mentioned above, were
treated in Sect. 3.2.9 in arbitrary dimensions D > 2. Accordingly, they will not
be considered further in this subsection. But it is interesting to look again in their
inherit degrees of freedom. In 4 dimensions, all non-zero spin massless ﬁelds have
two polarization states (degrees of freedom). In 10 dimensions, the massless vector
ﬁeld has D  2 D 8 degrees of freedom, the massless traceless symmetric second
rank tensor ﬁeld has D.D  3/=2 D 35, while the massless anti-symmetric tensor
ﬁeld has .D2/.D3/=2 D 28. The scalar ﬁeld has, of course, 1 degree of freedom
in any dimension, while the massless second rank anti-symmetric ﬁeld has 1 degree
of freedom in 4 dimensions. We consider, in turn, the massless third rank anti-
symmetric tensor ﬁeld, followed by the massless (self-dual) anti-symmetric fourth
rank tensor ﬁeld in 10 dimensions.
In this subsection, Latin indices, in the middle alphabet, i; j; k; : : : take on the
values 1; 2; : : : ; 9, while Latin indices, in the beginning of alphabet, a; b; c; : : : take
on the values 1; 2; : : : ; 8.

D Branes
We have seen (Sect. 3.2.8) that open strings with a compactiﬁed dimension with a
Neumann boundary conditions, necessarily changes, under T-duality, to a dimension
with a Dirichlet boundary condition and implies the existence of extended objects,
to which the motion of the end-points are restricted, and are referred to as D branes.

3.4
D Branes
279
On the other hand, a corresponding Dirichlet boundary condition implies that there
must be such objects to which the end points are attached.
The “D” in D branes, stands for Dirichlet, and the word “brane” is derived from
the word membrane. If p is the spatial dimension of a D brane, the latter is called a
D p -brane. The volume of a brane is termed as its worldvolume. The space outside
the brane is called the “bulk”. If p D D  1, where D denotes the dimensions of
spacetime, then the brane is referred to as space ﬁlling. Time ﬂows not only in the
brane but in the bulk as well.
Interestingly enough, one may be led to imagine that the universe in which we
live is a D3-brane with the bulk being associated with the extra dimensions. Closed
strings describing, in particular, gravitons, have no end points and are not restricted
to branes, and may move around all over spacetime. One may then infer that
gravitons can escape from branes into the bulk providing, perhaps, an explanation of
the feebleness of the strength of gravitation in comparison to the other interactions.

The ground-state may be labeled as shown in j0I p C; p ii with no momentum

there will be dependence on x ; x i. The massless vector particles are given by
˛ i.1/j0; p C; p ii with the index i belonging to Lorentz indices pertinent to the
brane only, with the number of states being equal to p  1 D . p C 1/  2, i.e., the
massless vector particles “live” in the brane. We also have D1 p massless scalar
particles, associated with the states ˛I.1/j0; p C; p ii, so-called Goldstone bosons,
arising from the symmetry breaking of translational invariance by the presence
of the brane. Such states correspond to displacements of the brane in the above
mentioned normal directions. Clearly, for p D D  1, there are no massless scalar
particles and translational invariance holds true in spacetime.
3.4.2
More Than One Brane
We recall (Sect. 3.2.5) that an open (oriented) bosonic string with end points
having N possible Chan-Paton states, generates N2 massless vector particle with
an underlying gauge group U.N/. For example, for the gauge groupU.2/, we have
four massless vector particles. Now consider two parallel D p-branes with locations
speciﬁed by NxI
1, NxI
2, and four possible conﬁgurations with ends of string falling on
the same brane or one end falling on one brane and the other end on the second one.
These conﬁgurations are shown in Fig. 3.7, and one may deﬁne four Chan-Paton
states .1; 1/; .1; 2/; .2; 1/; .2; 2/, e.g., with the ﬁrst entry in .1; 2/ corresponding to
the end of the string for  D 0, and the second entry for  D 	. For example, for
the Chan-Paton state .1; 2/ with the bosonic string stretched between the two branes
as shown, the ﬁeld variables, associated with the string, in directions perpendicular
to the branes, may be written as

Introduction to String Theory
3.5
Interactions, Vertices and Scattering
We consider scattering theory in string theory, where so-called external lines
represent single particle excitations of a string, but the internal structure, describing
the dynamics, include all the string modes. In a sense, the dynamics involved here
is much richer than in conventional ﬁeld theory where only a ﬁnite number of types
of particles are exchanged in the scattering process describing the dynamics.
The worldsheets of two open strings may merge together forming a single
worldsheet and may then split again as shown in Fig. 3.9.
We have to give some sense of such a process just described. Such diagrams
replace familiar Feynman diagrams involving no closed loops and a closed loop,
respectively, e.g., as shown in Fig. 3.10. String processes involving “loops” are much
harder to compute.
Examples of closed strings corresponding to the above processes are shown in
Fig. 3.11.
We present a simple intuitive description of scattering theory with interactions,
described by certain vertices. The scattering theory of string theory is not fully
developed to the extent of scattering theory in conventional ﬁeld theory but some
interesting results emerge.
Fig. 3.9 Two of simple examples where the worldsheets of two open strings merge together
forming a single worldsheet and then split again

3.5.1
Open Bosonic Strings
For any given particle state of, say, type , of momentum k, in the open string
spectrum, one associates a vertex operator V.k; 
/, using a rather standard notation.
This vertex describes the emission of such a particle from the  D 0 end of the open
string at a proper time 
. The nature of such vertices will be discussed below.
As a very simplistic view of a scattering process, consider a particle of type, say,
1, of momentum k1, in the spectrum of the string, being attached to the string at
the  D 0 end of the string in the far past. As time develops, one may, conveniently,
introduce a string diagram, not to be confused with its worldsheet, as the semi-
inﬁnite rectangular strip, with  taken along the vertical axis, while 
 taken along
the horizontal one, with 
1

    
 
n, and 
 1 ! 1 to 
 n ! 1. At times

 2; 
 3;    ; 
 n1, particles may be emitted (absorbed), at the  D 0 boundary of
the string, such that with each particle, a vertex operator is associated, as mentioned
above. Finally a particle of momentum kn emerges in the distant future. Such a string
diagram may be simply represented as shown in Fig. 3.12.
We may also map the semi-inﬁnite strip of the string diagram into other regions.
For example, given 
 1 < 
 2 < : : : < 
 n, we may introduce the variable,
 D e.
Ci /;

0 for 
 1 ! 1;
z n ! 1

One may also map the entire semi-inﬁnite strip of the string diagram above onto
a unit disc—a compact space—via the transformation

(3.5.2)
leading to Fig. 3.14. Here we note that u 2; u 3; : : : ; un1 represent the positions of

annihilation operators. To this end, let us spell out the normal-ordered expression

up to a momentum conserving delta function, with k1 C k 2 C k3 D 0, where, in the
process of the derivation, we have ﬁnally chosen the direction of all the momenta
such that momentum conservation reads as just given. Since the last term in (3.5.26)
involves three powers of momenta, we may infer from dimensional analysis alone
that its coefﬁcient is suppressed by a factor ˛ 0 relative to the other terms and hence
is of higher order. The leading contribution to (3.5.26) may be then conveniently
written as

with k1 C k2 C k3 D 0. It is easily veriﬁed, by the application of momentum
conservation and the orthogonality relations ej kj D 0, for each j D 1; 2; 3,
that this amplitude is anti-symmetric in the exchange of any pairs .ei; ki/ $
.ej; kj/. 44 Hence symmetrization over the exchanges of such pairs give zero unless
one considers a linear combination of such amplitudes with corresponding anti-
symmetric coefﬁcients thus leading naturally to a non-abelian gauge theory with
anti-symmetric structure constants. Thus this three point-function contributes only
in the non-abelian gauge theory case. This will be discussed again in Sect. 3.5.3, and
applied in Sect. 3.7.

For historical reasons, the amplitude (3.5.15) is often applied to the scattering of
four tachyons as the resulting amplitude, in particular, of scattering of four scalar
particles coincides with the expression conjectured by Veneziano in the sixties,
which was discussed in the introduction to this chapter, and has some desirable
properties. The vertex operator for a tachyon state of momentum k, has the simplest
possible structure given by
V.k; z/ D W exp i kX.z/ W
(3.5.29)
i.e., W.k; z/ D 1. We note from (3.2.94) that for the tachyon, M 2 D 2, for
˛ 0 D 1=2, i.e., k 2 D 2. We carry out a transformation of variable .z/i ! z , which
corresponds to so-called a Wick rotation in complex time plane.
In reference to (3.5.19), the following properties easily follow for a tachyon state,

Closed Bosonic Strings
The worldsheet of a closed string, does not have speciﬁc boundaries such as  D 0,
as in the open string case, and particle emission (absorption) is to be considered to
occur from any  value, as shown by the crosses in the string diagram of a closed
string in Fig. 3.15: One may map the surface of the cylinder onto the surface of a
unit sphere, as shown in Fig. 3.16, via the transformation

Fig. 3.15 Particle emission (absorption) is to be considered to occur from any points speciﬁed
by the variable  on the string diagram of a closed string. The latter is deﬁned as the surface of
the inﬁnite cylinder generated by the closed string set up vertically straight, in a circular shape
, with 
 labeled along a horizontal axis, from 
 ! 1 to 
 ! 1
Fig. 3.16 One may map the surface of the cylinder onto the surface of a unit sphere, with
transformation variables deﬁned in (3.5.38), (3.5.39), where  has its usual meaning and 2
replaces the angle , in spherical coordinates
Needless to say, one cannot order points on the sphere and a permutation over
vertex insertions may be then necessary.
In order to introduce a vertex for particle emission, let us consider,
say, the graviton which is in the spectrum of a closed bosonic string.
To this end, the state of graviton of momentum k, and described by a
polarization tensor ϵ, [see (3.2.188), (3.2.189), (3.2.175)], may be written as
[see (3.2.77), (3.2.78), (3.2.116), (3.2.117), (3.2.122)]

We note that for

sisting of operators of creation and annihilation of particles and is independent
of x, which we may denote by k  eX.0; /. Also note that the coefﬁcient of
exp Œ i k  X.0; /  in V.0; / in (3.5.42) is independent of x. Accordingly by using
the fact that the graviton is massless, i.e., k 2 D 0, we have for any constant ˇ the
following useful equations:
exp Œ i ˇp 2  exp Œ i k  x  exp Œ i ˇp 2  D exp Œ i k  x ;
(3.5.43)

(3.5.44)
Using the expression of the normal ordered expression in (3.5.19), (3.5.20),
adapted to the present situation, the graviton vertex operator may be deﬁned by

Upon rewriting the latter as V D ϵ V, we see that V, is written as the product

vertex operator in the closed string as a product of a right- and a left vertex operators

with the direction of momenta ﬁnally chosen so that momentum conservation reads

0 implying that A.k1; k2; k3/ must be linear in the momenta (see (3.5.28) and just
below it). We recall that for simplicity of notation we have set the dimensional
scale parameter `2 ! 1 in the present and in the last subsection computations, and
because of dimensional reasons the coefﬁcient of the products of three momenta in
A.k1; k2; k3/ must be proportional to ` 2 since dim k D Œlength1 and is of higher

Considering the limit ` ! 0 of (3.5.61), we may rewrite the corresponding

Introduction to String Theory
An interesting application of the above vertex is to determine the three-point
function involving three massless vector particles. The amplitude, as in the bosonic
string case, now applied to the vertex in question, is given by

ordered expression for e i k2  X.0/, when they are applied within the expression for the
amplitude in (3.5.74), (3.5.75). Thus the expression for the amplitude reduces to the

up to a momentum conserving delta function, with k1 C k2 C k3 D 0, where

48Note that this expression coincides with, or more precisely is proportional to, the one
in (3.5.26)/(3.5.27), (3.5.28), in bosonic string theory, in the limit ` ! 0 for the latter. See
Problem 3.24. In the supersymmetric case, however, there is no term non-linear in the momenta in
the corresponding three-point function and no limit ` ! 0 is to be taken.

From String Theory to Einstein’s Theory of Gravitation

Remark Here we reach a point of importance. We easily check that the three-point
function A.k1e1; k2e2; k3e3/ is anti-symmetric in the exchange of any pairs of vari-
ables .ei; ki/ $ .ej; kj/ for a theory meant to be dealing with bosons !. Thus the only
way such a three-point function can contribute to a theory involving massless vector
bosons is to consider linear combinations of such amplitudes with corresponding
anti-symmetric coefﬁcients. This is achieved by attaching an additional label (a
Chan-Paton factor) to the polarization vectors e a; a D 1; : : : ; N, introduce totally
anti-symmetric constants fabc and consider such a linear combination

where the overall phase factor “ i ” is introduced for convenience to ensure
reality in x-space. The above three-point function A .k1e1; k2e2; k3e3/ for bosons,
with necessarily totally anti-symmetric expansion coefﬁcients fabc, satisﬁes the
Bose character of the vector particles as it should. Are we on the verge in re-
discovering the Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory from string theory, where the fabc are
so-called structure constants? This is the subject of Sect. 3.7. For completeness, we
have also introduced a momentum conserving delta function factor in (3.5.80).
3.6
From String Theory to Einstein’s Theory of Gravitation
We recall that string theory, for closed strings, gives rise to the graviton, a
spin 2 massless particle, in their mass spectra. The graviton arises directly from
string theory and was not, a priori, assumed to exist. String theory, among other
things, also gave rise to a mathematical expression for the three-graviton vertex
in (3.5.64), (3.5.62) for ` ! 0. Given these two facts, that is a spin two massless
particle in D dimensions, and the mathematical expression of the three-graviton
vertex, as obtained in the just mentioned equation, would they lead to Einstein’s
theory of gravitation for ` ! 0 ? The purpose of this section is involved, rather
formally, with the simplest possible analysis of the underlying problem leaving a
detailed dynamical analysis for a more advanced treatment. Let us see what happens.
In this section all Greek indices go over from 0 to D  1.

density of free gravitons, with action given in (3.6.1), and an interaction term which
gives rise to the three-graviton vertex as obtained from string theory, followed by
an iteration, and no principle of equivalence or general covariance, were used to
obtain the expression for the effective action in (3.6.24). No attempt will be made,
in this introductory presentation, however, to consider supergravity in the light of
superstring theory.
3.7
From String Theory to the Yang and Mills-Field Theory
We have seen that string theory gives rise naturally to vector massless particles
associated with modes of vibrations of some of the strings. Superstring theory, in
particular, also gives rise to a mathematical expression for the three-vector-particle
vertex for massless particles in (3.5.76). Would these two facts lead to the Yang-
Mills ﬁeld theory? The purpose of this section is involved, rather formally, with the
simplest possible analysis of the underlying problem leaving a detailed dynamical
analysis for a more advanced treatment. As in the previous section, all Greek indices
go over from 0 to D  1.
For the description of the massless vector particle, we start from a ﬁrst order
formulation of free massless vector particles in D dimensions.
As we have witnessed, in particular, in (3.5.80), in order for a three-point func-
tion, giving the interaction of massless vector bosons, to contribute, it necessitates

to perform linear combinations of such three-point functions with anti-symmetric
constants fabc, consistent with Spin & Statistics.
The action of free massless vector particles may be deﬁned in terms of two sets
of ﬁelds Aa, and Fa as follows

(3.7.3)
As we will see below, given the ﬁelds Aa and Fb, an interaction term involving
the product of these ﬁelds which leads to the vertex part in (3.7.3) is simply given by
LI.x/ D  1

The expression for eV 1 2 3

The above analysis, in turn, suggests to add the integral of the interaction term
in (3.7.4) to the action in (3.7.1) as an iteration. Here we note that the ﬁelds Fa and
Aa are now subject to the variation of the new action and hence are automatically
modiﬁed. All told, the action becomes:

recognizing the Yang-Mills ﬁeld theory equations,50 where we have used, in
the process, the anti-symmetry property of fabc. The analysis was based on the
expression of Lagrangian density of free gluons and an interaction term which gives
rise to the three-vector-particlevertex as obtained from string theory, followed by an
iteration. Obviously no non-abelian gauge invariance argument was used to obtain
the expression for the effective action in (3.7.10).

Two things should be noted about this expression. From (3.2.66), we note that
for a given particle state j'i, in the spectrum of the string, i.e., in particular, on the
mass shell ( p 2 D M 2),

which accounts for the exchange of only one particle of mass m via the
corresponding propagator . p 2 C m 2  i ϵ/1, we see that in the string theory case,
we have the equivalence of the exchange of an inﬁnite number particles, in the the

General Appendices

Appendix I
The Gamma Matrices in Various Dimensions
In this appendix, we summarize some of the representations of the gamma matrices
 in D D 2; 4; 10 dimensional spacetimes, satisfying the anti-commutation
relations:1
f; g D 2;
 D diagŒ1; 1; : : : ; 1;
 D 0; 1; : : : ; .D1/:
(I.1)
Four Dimensional Spacetime
Some of the properties of the gamma matrices, based on their anti-commutations
relations in (I.1) in 4D are given here in Box I.1.
1It should be noted that no gamma matrix may be chosen to be the identity matrix I without making
the other gamma matrices non-zero. The reason for this is very simple. If, for example , for a
ﬁxed , is chosen to be I, then for any other gamma matrix , for  ¤ , the anti-commutation
relation (I.1) implies that 2I D 0, i.e., all the other gamma matrices , for  ¤ , are zero.
The latter, in turn, is inconsistent with (I.1) as the anti-commutator of the zero matrix with itself is
zero.

From this and the fact that @x 0=@x D  , we learn that the Jacobian of the

1.1. For the Minkowski metric ˛ˇ, @˛ˇ D 0, ˛ˇ D e˛  eˇ. Also, by mere
relabeling of dummy indices, we may write
  e˛  eˇ D  e˛  eˇ:
Accordingly, we obviously have
@.e˛ eˇ/ C   e˛ eˇ   e˛  eˇ D 0:
Upon expanding the latter equation we obtain
eˇ.@e˛  C  e˛ / D  e˛ .@eˇ   eˇ/;
or
eˇr e˛

The equality in question then follows upon rewriting the right-hand side of
the above equation as

using the fact that rg D 0. Equivalently, we may write r e˛  eˇ D 0.

which upon subtraction gives the identity in (i).
(ii) r h˛ˇ is a mixed tensor ﬁeld, r˛h˛ˇ is a vector ﬁeld. In a local Lorentz
coordinate system at the point x in question, the connection vanishes but
not its derivatives. Accordingly, we may write in the latter coordinate
system:

From (1.1.50), (1.1.39), we recognize the coefﬁcient of hˇ in the ﬁrst
term on the right-hand side, as R, and the coefﬁcient of h˛ as Rˇ ˛
at the point x in such a coordinate system. As a tensor equation the
statement of the problem holds true in a general coordinate system as
well.
1.3.
(i) According (A-1.9), for a matrix A: • det A D det A TrŒ.A1/•A. Hence
for A D Œg, •g D gg˛ˇ•g˛ˇ, since Œg˛ˇ is the inverse of Œg. The ﬁrst
equality then follows by multiplying the latter by minus, and noting that
•pg D .1=2/•.g/=pg. On the other hand g˛g ˇ D ı˛ ˇ which
upon taking the variation of the latter gives, in particular, g˛ˇ•g˛ˇ D
g˛ˇ•g˛ˇ, implying the second equality.
(ii) The ﬁrst equality in (i) above implies the ﬁrst equality in (ii). On the other
hand, we explicitly have   D .1=2/g˛ˇ@g˛ˇ which gives the second
equality.
1.4. (i) The vanishing of the covariant derivative of the (inverse of the) metric
rg˛ˇ D 0, gives  ˛gˇ D .@g˛ˇ C  ˇg˛/. Upon setting

the equality. Part (ii) is the content of part (ii) in Problem 1.3.

using part (ii) of Problem 1.4.
(ii) Recall that @ is a vector ﬁeld, we may write pg g@ @ D
pg @@. Partial integration implies that the latter is equivalent to
.@pg / @  pg @@. The result again follows from part
(ii) of Problem 1.3, and the expression of the covariant derivative of a
vector ﬁeld.
(iii) The results follows from the application of part (i) of Problem 1.3 for
pg followed by the variation of g (the coefﬁcient of @@),
keeping  ﬁxed as required.
1.6. From the just mentioned equation, the following transformation law of •%  

which is the transformation rule of a tensor.

•     • :
In a local lorentz coordinate system, the connection vanishes locally, but
not its variation since the latter is a tensor. Accordingly, in a local Lorentz
coordinate system, at the point x in question, we may write •R   D
@ •   @ •  . Since • , •   are tensors, a tensorial equation
holding in every coordinate is obtained by replacing the partial derivatives by
their covariant counterparts. This gives (i).
Part (ii) follows by writing R D gR  and using part (i).
Part (iii) is obtained by making a contraction between  and  in (i). In a
local Lorentz coordinate system, the ﬁrst derivative of the metric is, locally,
zero at the point in question, and we may write
•
 D 1
2g.@•g C @•g  @ •g/:
Accordingly, in every coordinate system, •  has the structure as stated
in the problem with covariant derivatives replacing partial derivatives, thus
establishing part (iv).

1.8. Upon using the expression for •R in Problem 1.7, the expression for
g  in part (i) of Problem 1.4, and the deﬁnition of a covariant derivative,

The last two terms constitute the total derivative @.pg g• /. On
the other hand, by partial integration the sum of the remaining terms is
equivalent to

the process, as is easily veriﬁed upon partial integration. Part (iii) is a
special case of (i).
1.11. From part (iii) of Problem 1.10, we may rewrite the integrand of the

(iii) With suitable relabeling of dummy indices, we explicitly have

But r@ D @@   @ D r@, leading to
rT D .   m2/ @;
which vanishes as a consequence of the ﬁeld equation. Due to symmetry in

Solutions to the Problems
Note that the terms involving h::  ::  in the second line cancel out, while
the corresponding ones with g:: give @g on account of the fact that
rg D 0. This establishes the statement of the problem. A more direct
way of seeing this is that (1.4.3) as a tensor equation and must hold with the
partial derivatives in it replaced by covariant ones. After having done this,
make use of the fact that rg D 0 to obtain (1.4.4).

3.13. The two dimensional Dirac equation in (3.3.10), in the presence of an
electromagnetic coupling, reads Œ ˛.@˛=ieA˛/Cm  D 0. Upon taking the
complex conjugate of this equation and using the fact that the Dirac matrices
are pure imaginary, give Œ ˛.@˛=i C eA˛/ C m   D 0, from which we infer
that  C D  , for the charge conjugate spinor.

almost identical.
3.19. Using the facts that @˛ C D 0 and @1XC D 0 [see (3.3.51), (3.3.52)], we

the remaining terms in T01 readily give the constraints in (3.3.77),

true as a special case of (3.3.35).

which establish the facts that W maps the upper complex -plane into

z 1; z 2; : : : ; z n1; z n, encountered in Sect. 3.5.1, may be chosen at will, on
account that three of real parameters a; b; c; d, such that ad  bc D 1, are
arbitrary, a natural choice, for a scattering process, is 
1 ! 1, 
 n ! C1,
which correspond to z 1 D 0, z n D 1. Finally, z n1 was chosen to be 1,
corresponding to 
 D 0, obtaining the following restriction on the variables

as appearing in (3.5.13).

where we have used, in the process, the fact that pj0I ki D kj0I ki, k 2
i D 0,
that x generates momentum translation, and that k1 C k2 C k3 D 0, and,
in the process of derivation, the directions of momenta were ﬁnally chosen
such that the conservation of momenta reads as just given. Adding these three
terms lead immediately to the expression in (3.5.26).
3.23. The three-point function in question, up to an overall coupling parameter, may
be rewritten as
e1 e2 e3%


./
It is sufﬁcient to establish the anti-symmetry property of, say, under the
exchange .e1; k1/ $ .e2; k2/. Momentum conservation allows us to write,
respectively, in reference to these corresponding momenta: k1 D k2  k3,
k2 D k1  k3, k3 D k1  k2. Using the properties ei  ki D 0; i D 1; 2; 3, the
above three-point function may be rewritten as

By a mere relabeling of the Lorentz indices, note that this is just the initial
three-point function of opposite sign.
3.24. The three-point function, in question, in bosonic string theory, with ` ! 0,
up to an overall coupling parameter, as in the previous problem, is given by

Using momentum conservation: k1 C k2 C k3 D 0, we may rewrite k1; k2; k3,
respectively, within the brackets above as
k1 D 1
2.k2 C k3  k1/;
k2 D 1
2.k1 C k3  k2/;
k3 D 1

Upon using the properties

the above three-point function simply becomes

and the proportionality of the latter to the superstring expression in (3.5.74) is
now evident. If the reader has gone through solution of the previous problem,
then note that the equality of the two equations ./; ./ in it imply they are
also both equal to Œ ./ C ./ =2, which is the equation derived above.
3.25. The equality follows by using, in the process, the basic equalities:
 @ @ D 1

where, for convenience, we have relabeled some of the indices in writing
down these equations. The last two equalities easily follow. The ﬁrst one in

where in writing the last term, on the extreme right-hand side, we have
exchanged the indices  $ , and when this last term is brought to the left-
