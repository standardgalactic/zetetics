Atomistic insights into predictive in silico
chemical vapor deposition
P. K. Saxena,
* P. Srivastava, Anshika Srivastava and Anshu Saxena
An unmatched atomistic technique for predictive in silico chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is reported
from an experimental and modeling perspective in the current manuscript. The gas-phase and surface-
phase chemical reaction rates dependent on the precursor’s flow rates, reactor chamber geometry, and
other input conditions are observed to play significant roles in deciding the monolayer growth
morphology. The randomness-based kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) technique is exploited for the
computation of adsorption, diﬀusion, and desorption rates. The deposition of silicon (Si) and silicon-
germanium (SixGe1x) layers over the h100i Si substrate is carried out to measure the thin film quality,
growth rate, strain, lattice constant, and mole-fraction and map the point defects (vacancies) along with
the surface roughness. The impact of variation of various input physical parameters is studied during the
validation of experimental results. The growth rates of Si and SixGe1x are found to be in good
agreement with the experimental results under the similar input conditions. The common natural
phenomenon of self-organization of spontaneously formed spatial, temporal, or spatio-temporal
patterns is observed during growth through the proposed technique.
Introduction
The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reaction process for homo
and hetero-epitaxy on single-crystal surfaces involves the follow-
ing mechanisms: transportation of reaction gases into the reac-
tion chamber; formation of intermediate reactants from reactant
gases; diﬀusion of reactant gases through the gaseous boundary
layer to the substrate; adsorption of gases onto the substrate
surface; single or multi-step reactions at the substrate surface;
desorption of product gases from the substrate surface; and
forced exit of product gases from the system.1–12
The computational solution of the problem associated with
length scales around micron and time scales of the order of
seconds is impossible through any numerical method. The
computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method uses continuum
model equations (Navier–Stokes) to predict the deposition pro-
cess without any knowledge of atomistic scale information.13
The epitaxial growth of silicon as a function of surface
temperature (570–770 1C) exploiting the kinetic Monte Carlo
(kMC) technique is reported by Vivien et al.14 Juan et al.
reported lattice kinetic Monte Carlo technique for reproducing
the epitaxial growth of silicon using H2/SiH4 chemistry for the
prediction of growth rates based on surface chemical kinetics.15
The review on the computational Si and SiGe CVD epitaxy
throws light on the latest updates till date.16 The lattice kinetic
Monte Carlo (LkMC) method reported in the ref. 14–16 uses two
approaches, i.e., on-lattice kMC and off-lattice kMC methods.
The on-lattice kMC method is where all the bonding positions
over the lattice are predefined.17 This method is incapable of
predicting information regarding strain, various types of
defects and their formation mechanisms, and other physical
parameters, which are required to understand the growth
morphology. On the other hand, the off-lattice kMC method
is more complex than the on-lattice method; however, incor-
porating elastic effects into kMC simulations in a way that
could retain simplicity has emerged as a central challenge in
the off-lattice mode.17 The impact of the CVD reactor geometry
and precursor diffusivity on the chemical kinetics is totally
ignored in all these previously reported studies.
In the current study, the authors have attempted to address
the above issues through the in-house developed algorithms in
form of TNL-EpiGrow simulator to handle the coupled reactor
geometry dependent chemical kinetics and kinetic Monte Carlo
(kMC) technique. It uses CVD reactor geometry dependence on
the precursors’ flow along with coupled gas- and surface phase
chemical kinetics. The atoms bonding is decided by the hybri-
dization rule, which itself find the bonding position following
the natural phenomenon of the growth process in the real
reactor environment. The proposed technique is innovative and
significantly diﬀers from the previously reported on-lattice and
oﬀ-lattice models. The diﬀerence can be accounted in terms of
the position of atoms, which are not fixed here as the case of
the on-lattice model and does not spend much time on
locating the local minima and saddle points to make the bond

as in the case of the oﬀ-lattice model. The surface grows like an
actual sample with atoms taking position according to their
bond angles and distances. The capabilities to map each and
every deposited atoms over the lattice layer-by-layer make it
possible to extract the lattice parameters, mole fraction, strain,
dislocations, defects (point, line, and stacking faults, misfits
etc.), and roughness.9,10
The proposed technique has capabilities to reproduce the
real-time experimental data in case users have calibrated the
CVD reactor process. Deeper insight and control over the
chemical kinetics and growth morphology can be achieved.
On the other hand, where users have no access to experimental
data or the process is new, means no information regarding the
process; the TNL chemical kinetics module with forward and
reverse reactions rates help to estimate the accurate flux inside
the reactor. TNL-Optimizer helps to run design of experiments
with minor variation in the Ehrlich–Schwoebel and nearest
neighbor energies barriers itself to obtain high-quality films
with minimum defect densities, roughness, etc. The optimum
growth rate obtained under the above conditions produced by
the TNL-optimizer guides the experimental design to get the
deposition information with the deeper insight. The proposed
technique in the form of the TNL-EpiGrow simulator is tested
and verified for other groups IV–IV, III–V, and II–VI semicon-
ductors on choosing a substrate other than Si. TNL-EpiGrow
simulator has flexibility to incorporate user-defined materials
as the substrate and coating materials.17–19
Technique
The CVD reactor-based epitaxial growth of Si and SixGe1x
materials over the Si(100) substrate are predicted with the help
of coupled chemical kinetics and kMC method.1–12
The chemical kinetics provides useful predictions regarding
chemical reactions probabilities of the particular gas phase
reaction in terms of the activation energy and the limiting steps
of surface phase reactions. These two terms are essentially
important
for
the
proper
understanding
of
deposition
processes.20–24 However, the rigorous kinetic analysis with the
probability of several reaction paths is crucial for the better
understanding of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) pro-
cesses, including the adsorption and desorption events over the
substrate surface.
TNL chemical kinetics utility package is designed to facil-
itate the simulations of the elementary gas and surface phase
chemical reactions under CVD process systems to help a user
work eﬃciently with large systems of chemical reactions and
develop representations of systems of equations that define a
particular problem. The reaction rate constant of the reactions
is generally assumed to have the following modified Arrhenius
temperature dependence17,18
k ¼ ATn exp  Ea
RT


(1)
where Ea(cal) is the activation energy and is often identifiable
with the energy barrier for some actual process to occur, e.g.,
breaking of a bond. Here, T refers to the gas temperature, n is the
temperature exponent, and R is the universal gas constant.17,18
The coeﬃcient A is known as the pre-frequency factor and is
dependent on the entropy of formation. The prefactor A (unit is
dependent on the order of reaction) also includes information
regarding the random motion of molecules as they vibrate,
rotate, and translate inside the CVD reactor space and take part
in the computation of the thermal energy of the molecules as per
the transition state theory (TST). The temperature distribution
inside the CVD chamber plays a significant role in the decision
of particular gas phase reactions.
Atoms are deposited at random on a periodic array of
adsorption sites at the rate of F per site (the deposition flux);
these atoms diﬀuse across the surface, leading to nucleation
and growth; subsequently, the atoms are deposited on the top
of these layers and either diﬀuse to their edges and descend
(often with some inhibition due to the presence of an Ehrlich–
Schwoebel step-edge barrier to downward transport25,26) or
nucleate new islands in higher layers. A step-edge barrier thus
induces the formation of stacks of atoms. The kinetic Monte
Carlo (kMC) technique is exploited to compute the adsorption,
diffusion, and desorption rates. The rates of each event help in
calculating the total rate and are given as.17,19,27
R = A + H + D
(2)
Here, A, H, and D are the adsorption, diﬀusion, and desorption
rates, respectively. The adsorption rate is measured as the
number of interacting adsorbed atoms per unit site per unit
time. Hopping rate (H) is the likelihood of an atom moving to
its neighboring site, while desorption rate (D) refers to the sum
of diﬀerent desorption rate of atoms from the CVD chamber.
The in-house developed technique (in form of TNL-EpiGrow
simulator) couples the chemical reactions kinetics in the gas-
and surface-phase with the kMC method along with the impact
of reactor geometry.17–19 The Si and SiGe CVD process details
are given in three subsections.

Chemical reaction kinetics
The gas- and surface-phases Arrhenius parameters are listed in
Table 2.
a.
Silane. Silane gas is used for the silicon (Si) epitaxial
growth with the possible decomposition reaction routes. It
decomposes into SiH2 and H2. SiH2 reacts with SiH4 to form
Si2H6 in the gas phase. The disilanes (Si2H6) decompose by the
elimination of hydrogen (H2) with the formation of HSiSiH3, an
intermediate compound. The possibility of the decomposition
of HSiSiH3 into H2SiSiH2 is also considered in present
analysis.25 The surface phase reactions consider the adsorption
of SiH4, SiH2, and H2 molecules over the Si substrate. SiH4 itself
decomposes into SiH3 - SiH2 - SiH and finally into Si with H2
abstraction in each decomposition over the substrate surface.
The hydrogen adsorption–desorption equilibrium is crucial
because hydrogen adsorption competes with silane for occupy-
ing the free available surface sites on the substrate lattice22.
b.
Disilane. Similarly, disilane is other most preferred
precursor gas used for Si epitaxial deposition.2,22
c.
Germane. SixGe1x, growth is carried out using silane
and germane as the main precursor’s gases along with H2 as the
carrier gas.23,24
III.
Kinetic Monte Carlo technique
The adsorption, hopping, and desorption rates are computed with
the help of eqn (2). The anisotropic kinetics due to the surface
reconstruction has dealt with the randomness of the kMC
method. The surface kinetics is totally dependent on randomness,
energy, and surface temperature. The adsorption rate is measured
as the number of interacting adsorbed atoms per unit site per unit
time. Since this rate is identical at every site on the surface, the
total adsorption rate is thus given as follows.17,18
A = Flw
(13)
Here, A denotes the total adsorption rate, F denotes incident
atomic or molecular flux over the substrate surface, and l and w
denote length and width of substrate, respectively.
The diﬀusion or hopping rate (H) is the likelihood of an
atom moving to its neighboring site. This is described through
the Arrhenius relation.
hj ¼ D0 exp  Ej

Here, hj is the hopping rate of the jth atom, Ej is the activation
energy of the jth atom and its unit is in eV, kB is the Boltzmann
constant in eV, and T is the substrate temperature (K). The pre-
factor D0 corresponds to vibration frequency, which can be
obtained by the application of the equipartition theorem. The

characteristic vibration frequency D0 is given as follows.17,18
D0 ¼ 2kBT
h
(15)
where kB is Boltzmann’s constant and h is Planck’s constant.
The desorption rate (D) is taken as the sum of diﬀerent
desorption rates of atoms. One atom desorption rate can be
described by Arrhenius relation and is given as follows.17,18
dj ¼ D0 exp 
Edes
j
kBT
 
!
(16)
Here, dj is the desorption rate of the jth atom, Edes
j
is the
activation energies responsible for desorption of the jth atom
and dependent on the nearest neighbor energies as well, and T
is the substrate temperature (K). The activation energies are
generally diﬀerent for each atom. Its calculation is based on the
assumption that bonds only exist between the nearest neigh-
boring atoms. Denoting Es as the surface diﬀusion energy
barrier, En is the nearest binding energy and n is the number
of nearest neighbors (n–n) on the surface. The total activation
energy is thus computed as follows.17,18
E = Es + nEn
(17)
The proposed technique has capabilities to reproduce the types
of growth modes itself without the use of any continuum
models, i.e., Stranski–Krastanov (SK), Volmer–Weber (VW),
and Frank–van der Merwe growth models. Refer to eqn (17);
the growth mechanism is only dependent on the nearest
neighbor (En), surface (Es) energies, and the lattice parameters
of the substrate and coating film. The role of various energies of
each and every atom on the surface decides the type of growth,
i.e., layer-by-layer or island-based growth.
Except for n–n interaction, other effects that are also respon-
sible for activation energies such as step-edge barriers from
descending steps in the form of Schwoebel–Ehrlich barrier and
ascending steps in the form of incorporation barrier are also
relevant in surface diffusion and are given in Table 2.
Thus,
E = Es + nEn + Eshw
(18a)
and
E = Es + nEn + Ei
(18b)
Here, Es and En describe the surface and nearest neighbor
energies, respectively. The Schwoebel and incorporation bar-
riers energies are represented by Eshw and Ei respectively. The
barrier energy is dependent on the sites on the lattice; hence,
the activation energy of the same atom is also dependent on the
sites available for diﬀusion on the lattice.
The total hopping rate is calculated by H ¼ P
j
hj. The total
absorption (A) and hopping (H) rates are dependent on the sites
available on the lattice. The rates of each type of event transi-
tions (R) are calculated by eqn (2).
t ¼ log x
R
(19)
where t denotes the time interval of an event, and x is a random
number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The selection
of any event is a random process in kMC algorithms, controlled
by a uniformly distributed random number x.
For the deposition event, the total transition rate R multi-
plying x must be smaller than the total adsorption rate A, i.e.,
xR o A
(20)
Otherwise, the diﬀusion or hopping event takes place if xR is
not smaller than A. The desorption event takes place when the
atom absorbs energy equal to the desorption energy.
The flux is assumed to be the same for all the sites on the
lattice; we may easily find the adsorption site by
j ¼ sup lwxR
A


(21)
where the lateral size of simulation surface l and w are
measured by unit cell and j reveals the deposition site from
one of the lw sites. In case of diﬀusion, due to the diﬀerent
hopping rates for diﬀerent atoms, the hopping sites are calcu-
lated as follows.

Here, j represents the diﬀusing atom number.
In case of sp3 hybridization, the bonds among atoms have
tetrahedral orientations, i.e., when an atom makes bond with
another atom, it follows tetrahedral bond angles between them,
and the rest of the bonds also follow this angle arrangement.
This is where the term patches came from; it only recognizes
the tetrahedral bonding position and angles.17 The values of y1
and y2 are computed by the adaption of the model proposed in
ref. 17. The model promotes the self-assembly of structures to
be grown by the kMC method.17 The complete kMC flow chart
of algorithms implemented inside the EpiGrow simulator and
the surface roughness are given in ref. 17. The proposed
epigrowth technique is also tested and verified with other
semiconductors of groups IV–IV, III–V, and II–VI on substrates
other than Si.
Results and discussion
An attempt to reproduce the in silico CVD process through the
simulation for Si and SiGe deposition respectively reported in
ref. 28 and 29 over the Si substrate with crystallographic
orientation (100) is carried out successfully by validating the
growth rates under similar conditions.
In case of Si deposition, silane and disilane precursors with
constant flow rate of 45 sccm were used, whereas for SiGe
deposition, the silane and germane precursors with flow rate of
10 sccm and 1 sccm are used, respectively. The partial pressure
of carrier gas H2 is taken as 1 slm in both cases. The various
geometrical parameters associated with the CVD chamber and
type of precursors and their flow rates listed in Table 1 are
taken from ref. 28 and 29 along with the various other physical

parameters used in the epitaxial deposition simulation of the
silicon (Si) and silicon-germanium (SixGe1x) layers. The values
of various energy barriers, i.e., surface energy (eV), nearest
neighbor energy (eV), Schwoebel barrier (eV), incorporation
barrier (eV), and desorption barrier (eV), are used here as the
free parameters. These values are optimized by the running
design of experiments (DOE) to calibrate the experimental
growth rates.28,29
The proposed technique is competent to extract various
physical properties and provides deeper insights into the CVD
process at the atomic scale.
Fig. 1 depicts the epitaxial atomistic scale Si thin film side
view and top view; atoms are deposited over the Si(100) sub-
strate. The unit cell of Si is taken as a group of four bonding
atoms in tetrahedral phase symmetry. The cluster of unit cells
in a row is treated as a single monolayer. The number of layers
is counted from the figure. The number of layers deposited is
found to be dependent on the partial pressure of the precursor
gases, i.e., with the increase in the partial pressure of the
precursor gases, the number of layers increases. The two case
studies for silane (SiH4) and disilane (Si2H6) gases with con-
stant flow rate 45 sccm are taken as precursor gases for the
deposition of Si. The Si substrate with crystallographic orienta-
tion (100) is used for the deposition of Si in both cases.

The substrate temperature is kept constant (800 1C) during the
entire growth mechanism, whereas the CVD chamber tempera-
ture is varied from 550 to 800 1C. The growth rate of each case
as a function of inverse CVD chamber temperature is shown in
Fig. 2. The atomistic Si deposition is carried out at 550–800 1C
temperature range. It is observed that below the chamber
temperature 550 1C (not shown here) in both cases, the growth
rates are negligible or diminished, which is explained in terms of
chemical kinetics. It is well known phenomena that CVD process
is a thermal process and temperature invokes the chemical
reactions kinetics inside the chamber. The dissociation tempera-
ture of silane and disilane is 525 1C and 500 1C, respectively.
Therefore, at Tcham o 550 1C, the decomposition of silane and
disilane is negligible; the growth rates are negligible in both
cases. The growth rates of Si using silane and disilane precursors
separately in the temperature ranges 660—780 1C and 700–
780 1C are observed to be limited by the mass transport regime,
as reflected from the figure (i.e., at x-axis range 0.95–1.075 for
silane and 0.94–1.028 for disilane, respectively). The growth rate
in the mass transport regime is almost constant. The gas phase
reactions kinetics play a significant role to decide the atomic
transport regimes. The impact of substrate orientation on the
mass transport limited growth rates are observed to be negligi-
ble. On the other hand, the kinetics-limited process in the case
of silane and disilane under temperature is in the range of 550–
660 1C and 550–700 1C (i.e., at x-axis range 1.072–1.215 for silane
and 1.028–1.215 for disilane), respectively, over the substrate
surface is observed to be strongly dependent on the crystal-
lographic orientation of the substrate. There are many studies on
the orientation dependence of harpooning in gas-phase reac-
tions, and a striking effect of orientation on the dynamics of
vibrational energy transfer is elaborated in detail; refer to ref. 30.
The temperature is varied from 550 to 800 1C, i.e., at higher
temperature range (B660–780 1C), the impact of mass transport
regime is observed, whereas under lower temperature range
(B550–700 1C), the surface kinetics reactions limited process
dictates the growth rates. The silane and disilane dissociation
rate at higher temperature increases with an increase in tem-
perature, resulting in more flux at the surface as compared to
lower temperature. It also causes a significant change in the
growth rates by affecting the surface adsorption, hopping, and
desorption rate probabilities due to change in the surface
composition. The growth steeply decreases under the surface
kinetics reactions limited region. The adsorption, hopping, and
desorption rates are also dependent on the number, nature, and
configuration of surface sites, bonds, and features (steps, kinks,
ledges, vacancies, etc.) at the substrate. The role of various energy
barriers treated as free parameters (e.g., surface, Schwoebel
barrier, incorporation, desorption, and nearest neighbor) during
the calibration of the experimental result have shown significant
contribution in the prediction of the growth morphologies. Each
energy barrier values are optimized by running virtual design of
experiments (VDOE) to match the experimental growth rate. The
growth rates in each case, i.e., for silane (SiH4) and disilane
(Si2H6) precursors separately at constant partial pressure 45
sccm, are matched with the experimental rates reported by Adam
et al.28 The absolute matching between the simulated and
experimental Si growth rate is achieved as shown in Fig. 2. It
justifies the validity and reliability of the proposed technique for
Si CVD growth.
The growth rate of epitaxially-deposited thin film of SixGe1x
using silane (SiH4) and germene (GeH4) precursors with flow
rates in the ratio 10 : 1 to obtain the desired mole fraction of Ge
is depicted in Fig. 3. The CVD chamber temperature is varied in
the temperature ranges of 600–700 1C, whereas the substrate
temperature is kept constant, i.e., 800 1C. The pressure of the
CVD chamber is set to 80 Torr. The growth rate of SixGe1x
using silane and germane precursors as a function of tempera-
ture is calibrated with the experimental rate reported by Tillack
et al.29 by treating various energies barriers as free parameters
(e.g., surface, Schwoebel barrier, incorporation, desorption, and
nearest neighbor). The barrier energies play a significant role in
achieving the bond-making conditions. The sticking coefficient
of the particular atom and molecule dictate the probability of

the adsorption rate. The hopping or diffusion rates of atoms
and molecules over the substrate surface are found to be
dependent on the substrate orientation and temperature.
Higher substrate temperature imparts more thermal energy to
the adsorbed atoms and molecules over the substrate surface.
The probability of the high diffusion rates increases the time to
make the bonds with the substrate atoms. A number of
adsorbed atoms and molecules are desorbed from the substrate
surface depending upon the desorption barrier energy value.
The growth rate of SixGe1x is shown in Fig. 3. The absolute
matching between simulated (solid line) and experimental
growth rate (symbol) result evidently again justifies the feasi-
bility and validity of the proposed atomistic CVD growth
technique. The inset curve shows the comparison between
the simulated Ge mole-fraction with the experimental one.
The inset figure shows the corresponding linear decrease
in the mole fraction (x) of germanium in Si1xGex thin film
with an increase in the chamber temperature. Under constant
chamber pressure, the variation in chamber temperature from
600 1C to 700 1C is responsible for the decomposition of
germene. At higher temperature, the gas phase decomposition
of germene is more probable compared to the lower tempera-
ture regime. Therefore, the mole-fraction of Ge increases with
the increase in the chamber temperature, which is evident from
the inset figure of Fig. 3. The addition of Ge atoms into the Si
lattice is observed to be strongly dependent on the substrate
temperature also. The addition of germane precursor causes an
increase in the hydrogen desorption process over the substrate
and increased growth rate is observed. The simulated growth
rate and mole fraction are in good agreement with the experi-
mental results.29
The comparison of surface profiles after 10 s, 20 s, and 30 s
growth of Si over 54.3  54.3 nm2 Si substrate are shown in
Fig. 4–6, respectively. From Fig. 4, it is clearly reflected that
atomistic growth shows layer-by-layer pattern and is dependent
on the surface and nearest neighbor energies. However, the
transition from layer-by-layer to island-based growth occurs
after a critical layer thickness is achieved, which is shown in
Fig. 5, and island-based growth mode is reflected in Fig. 6. The
transition from layer-by-layer to island-based growth justifies
the experimental Stranski–Krastanov (S–K) growth mode. The
island’s radius are extracted in the range of 8–12 nm.
The lattice feature is depicted in terms of variation of the
surface roughness, as shown in Fig. 7. The nature of roughness
curves with respect to increasing growth time for the Si and
SixGe1x thin films shows almost similar behavior. It is clearly
seen from Fig. 2 and 3 that the surface roughness curves during
the first 10 s increases sharply and then show saturation
behavior in both the Si case. The behavior of the surface
roughness curves for Si and SixGe1x is explained on the basis
of the arrival of number of atoms and available vacant sites
density on the substrate surface. Initially, the roughness curves
increase steeply because the density of atoms reaching the
substrate sites are dependent on the reversible chemical reac-
tion kinetic rate, start from zero, and increase until and unless
the forward reaction rate of reversible reactions attained equi-
librium. As compared to the Si case, low surface roughness
values are shown by the SixGe1x case. However, it increases
with respect to the growth time. The high decomposition rates
of GeH4 generate more flux as compared to SiH4 under similar
conditions. The increase in the surface roughness value with
respect to the growth time is attributed to the incorporation of
Ge atoms into Si monolayers. The diﬀerence in the radius of Ge
atoms and Si atoms, i.e., RGe 4 RSi (RGe = 1.225 Å, RSi = 1.11 Å) is
responsible for increasing the surface roughness an increase in
the growth time.
The vacancies density in each layer of Si and SiGe thin films,
which are extracted by tracing each bonding sites in the lattice,
are shown in Fig. 8. The lattice sites where no atoms with the
bonds are observed at that particular atomic position are
treated as vacancies. A higher number of vacancies are observed
in the SiGe film as compared to the Si film. The high vacancy
density in SiGe is due to the diﬀerence in the average lattice
parameters of Ge and Si. The average lattice parameters value
is found to be 5.45 Å for SixGe1x at the mole fraction x = 0.85.

and gemane precursors are taken as 10 sccm and 1 sccm for SiGe
deposition, whereas H2 flow rate is taken 1 slm. The content of Ge in the
SiGe film is shown in the inset figure and compared against the experi-
mental data.29

For the case of Si, the extracted average lattice parameter is
5.431 Å for Si. The diﬀerence in lattice parameter is attributed
to the radius of Ge atom as compared to Si, i.e., RGe 4 RSi (RGe =
1.225 Å, RSi = 1.11 Å). Here, R represents atomic radii. The impact
of vacancies is included in the extracted layer by layer lattice
parameter values. The defects in lattice sites introduce strain in
the mono-crystalline layer dependent on the density of defects.
The Si(100) substrate is used for the epitaxial growth of both Si
and SixGe1x thin films in the present study. The strain in each
layer is extracted with a diﬀerence in the lattice parameters of
two consecutive layers. Under ideal conditions, the strain must
be zero in the case of Si deposition over the Si substrate. On the
hand, the addition of Ge content into Si crystalline layers during
CVD-based epitaxial deposition process introduces strain in each
crystalline layer. The lattice parameter mismatch between Si and
Ge in each layer is responsible for strain generation. The strain
in each monolayer for both the cases, i.e., Si over Si and SiGe over
Si are depicted in Fig. 9. Nearest neighbor energy parameter is
found to play a significant role during the deposition event. The
deposited atom is traceable with their atomic position (a, b, c) on
the lattice. Taking average of the atomic parameters for each
monolayer, the strain in the plane of the homo- and hetero-
interface is calculated through the lattice mismatch.17

Here, a0 is the lattice parameter of the substrate or beneath
monocrystalline layer over which deposition is done. as is the
lattice parameter of the depositing materials. Both types of
compressible and tensile strain components are observed in
the deposited SiGe monolayer during the mapping of the layer by
layer growth. However, negligible stain of the order of 107–108
is observed in the deposited Si monolayers, and it is found that
the average strain associated with multiple layer relaxation itself
justifies the ideal situation of Si.
Conclusions
Si and SiGe epitaxy at the atomic scale is simulated through the
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process implemented in TNL-
EpiGrow simulator. The optimum conditions to successfully
reproduce the experimental output data in CVD growth are
obtained by the design of experiments on the TNL-EpiGrow
simulator. The inbuilt coupled algorithms in the TNL-EpiGrow
simulator have shown capabilities to simultaneously handle
the CVD reactor geometry-dependent chemical kinetics with
the deposition processes. The output extraction capabilities
provide a better understanding of the physical phenomenon

inside the CVD chamber at the atomic scale. The proposed
technique is found to be computationally eﬃcient with potential
to extract the thin film morphologies at the atomic scale, e.g.,
growth mode, point defects, strain layer by layer, growth in steps,
surface roughness, and lattice parameters along with the
chemical reaction kinetics data. The growth rates of Si using
silane and disilane precursors and SiGe using silane and ger-
mane precursors have been successfully reproduced against the
experimental findings. The observed growth modes justify S–K
mode growth obtained during the experiments.
TNL-EpiGrow simulator can be used to develop a closed loop
operation strategy to improve the thin film quality and to
reduce the batch-to-batch variability caused by drift during
the conditioning phase of CVD reactor operation. It is helpful
for reactor design engineers associated with the development of
CVD reactor processes associated with Si and SiGe deposition.
The technique provides flexibility to optimize the chemical
kinetics and growth conditions along with the flow rates of
the precursors for getting optimum quality thin film wafers.
