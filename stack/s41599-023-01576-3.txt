The problem of gender bias is highly prevalent and well known. In this paper, we have
analysed the portrayal of gender roles in English movies, a medium that effectively inﬂuences
society in shaping people’s beliefs and opinions. First, we gathered scripts of ﬁlms from
different genres and derived sentiments and emotions using natural language processing
techniques. Afterwards, we converted the scripts into embeddings, i.e., a way of representing
text in the form of vectors. With a thorough investigation, we found speciﬁc patterns in male
and female characters’ personality traits in movies that align with societal stereotypes.
Furthermore, we used mathematical and machine learning techniques and found some biases
wherein men are shown to be more dominant and envious than women, whereas women
have more joyful roles in movies. In our work, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, a
novel technique to convert dialogues into an array of emotions by combining it with Plutchik’s
wheel of emotions. Our study aims to encourage reﬂections on gender equality in the domain
of ﬁlm and facilitate other researchers in analysing movies automatically instead of using
manual approaches.

Introduction
A
s the movie industry is one of the inﬂuential branches of
the media reaching billions of viewers worldwide, they
play a great role in shaping the beliefs and opinions of
people (Sparks, 2015). Since blockbuster ﬁlms are those that make
money by giving the audience what they want, like, or expect,
thus the portrayal of gender roles in blockbuster movies has a
direct inﬂuence on viewers, possibly reinforcing or contributing
to societal gender stereotypes (Ward and Grower, 2020). Thus, in
our work, we aim to study and analyse gender bias based on
emotions expressed by male and female characters in movies
using different Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
For this purpose, we chose around thirty blockbuster English
movies from IMDb (IMDb, 2019) and performed a comparative
analysis of the characters. The study is mainly based on the sta-
tistical distribution of male and female characters over a certain
period and the sentiment and emotions expressed in their dia-
logues. Through our work, we are trying to present an approach
to understanding and promoting studies on the highly prevalent
issue of gender inequality in movies. Furthermore, our analysis
allows us to help address the global problem of gender inequality
and bring positive social change using NLP.
Related works
Several studies have emerged in the past two decades that attempt
to assess the gender gap between men and women in various
ﬁelds (Lariviére et al., 2013; Lauzen, 2019; Wagner et al., 2015).
Many studies have utilised the Bechdel Test (Bechdel, 1986) to
evaluate gender bias in movies. Kagan et al. (Kagan et al., 2020) in
their studies presented 15,540 movie social networks where their
ﬁndings showed a gender gap in almost all genres of the ﬁlm
industry. However, they also found that all aspects of women’s
roles in movies show a trend of improvement over the years with
a constant rise in the centrality of female characters and the
number of movies that pass the Bechdel test.
Xu et al. (Xu et al., 2019) in their analysis of 7226 books, 6087
ﬁlm synopsis, and 1109 ﬁlm scripts, identiﬁed the constructed
emotional dependence of female characters on male characters,
also called the Cinderella complex, where women depend on men
for a happy and fulﬁlling life. They used the word embedding
techniques with word vectors trained on the Google News dataset
to construct a happiness vector for automatically calculating the
happiness score for every word in the document. The happiness
vector contains words such as success, succeed, luck, fortune,
happy, glad, joy, and smile for positive and failure, fail, unfortu-
nate, unhappy, sad, sorrow, and tear for negative sentiment. Their
analysis of female and male characters showed that female’s word
vector is oriented toward romance, whereas men’s toward
adventure. Their studies showed how such narratives embed
stereotypical gender roles into moral tales and institutionalise
gender inequality through these cultural products.
Similarly, Yu et al. (Yu et al., 2017) analysed the emotion
represented in Korean thriller movie scripts. The authors per-
formed manual emotion annotation on movie scenes based on
eight emotion types deﬁned by Plutchik (Plutchik, 1988). Further,
they used the Python-based NLTK VADERSentiment tool to
analyse the sentiment of the same script and compared the results
obtained with manual tagging. Their result showed that the
emotions of anger and fear were most matched, whereas the
emotion of surprise, anticipation, and disgust had a lower
matching score.
Anikina (Anikina, 2017) in her work performed manual
annotation on movie dialogues based on Plutchik’s emotion
wheel. The author used machine learning classiﬁers (fastText,
OpenNLP
and
SVM)
to
train
on
different
datasets
and
implemented rule-based NRC emotion lexicon classiﬁers to detect
the emotions. The study compared the results obtained from
NRC Lexicon with manually annotated data to ﬁnd the accuracy.
The study highlighted how the unavailability of annotated
resources on movie script domain affected the training process as
the data from different domains had to be used and also discussed
the limitations of used classiﬁers in performing multi-label
emotion classiﬁcation.
Similarly, the Bechdel test mostly focuses on assessing the
fairness of female representation by three rules, which fails even
for female oriented movies (Coyle, 2018; Florio, 2019; Waletzko,
2015) and also does not address stereotypes. In this study, we
address the limitations of the Bechdel test by expanding our work
to examine the stereotypes by employing both sentiment analysis
and the analysis of the embedded emotions. Moreover, in pre-
vious studies, stereotypes are generally only analysed using word
embedding techniques by creating word vectors. In our work, we
are not only relying on the word vectors but also analysing the
sentiment and emotions embedded with those words for better
representation of our results and hence expanding the work
beyond just the positive-negative affect dimension. Further, we
present a novel approach to converting dialogues into an array of
emotions by combining it with Plutchik’s wheel of emotions.
Methods
In this section, we present the workﬂow of our approaches, as
presented in Fig. 1. A brief description of the three modules is as
follows. More detailed information on each module is provided in
sections ‘Data processing module, Emotion recognition module,
Analysis module’, respectively.
Data processing module. In this module, we convert the scripts
of movies from PDF into a machine-readable format. Movie
scripts are ﬁrst converted from PDF into HTML using online
tools. Then we process the HTML and separate scenarios and
dialogues of each character.
Emotion recognition module. This module looks at every
character’s prevalent positive and negative sentiments using
Stanza (Qi et al., 2020), a Python natural language analysis
package. Next, we run NRCLex (Mohammad and Turney, 2013)
—a rule-based model for emotion detection trained on 27,000
manually annotated common words and phrases. From this step,
we get the “emotion scores" for eight primary emotions: fear,
anger, trust, surprise, sadness, disgust, joy, and anticipation.
Finally, with the help of Plutchik’s wheel of emotions, which
describes how emotions are related, we compute 24 secondary
emotions. In this module, we convert sentences into embeddings.
An embedding is a learned numerical representation of sentences
in the form of a vector, where similar sentences will have a similar
representation.
Analysis module. In the last module, we perform empirical
analysis, statistical methods such as Mann–Whitney U-test, and
machine learning techniques, namely clustering and classiﬁcation,
to determine if gender bias exists in the collection of scenarios.
The way we determine if bias exists is explained in each section,
For example, after running the Mann–Whitney U-test, if we get
different U-scores for female and male populations with a sig-
niﬁcant P-value, we could be certain that they are written dif-
ferently. Our approach is modular, and modules are loosely
coupled and highly cohesive.

Data processing module. In this section, we present the ﬁrst
module of this study, i.e., the data processing module. This
module includes data collection and data processing steps.
Data collection. To ensure the global reach of the movies and
their impact on society, we opted only for the top-rated movies of
all time listed on IMDB. We downloaded scripts of 34 movies
from different genres, namely romance, fantasy, ﬁction, drama,
and action, spread over the years ranging from 1972 to 2021. We
considered several parameters while choosing the scripts: the
accessibility of the scripts, the compatibility of the script’s format
with our data processing module, and overall how popular the
movie was. Initially, we started with a list of the top 1000 popular
movies of all time on IMDB and grouped them into ﬁve chunks.
We then randomly selected ten movies from each chunk. In the
case of series such as Harry Potter, all of the movies were kept.
Afterwards, we dropped the movies whose script was not freely
available, or the quality of the available manuscript was not
suitable to be processed by our module. The ﬁnal dataset was
capped at 34. The year distribution of the movies is presented in
Fig. 2. In total, we collected 26,279 dialogues and 457 characters,
out of which 118 are female characters, and 339 are male.
Data processing. Movie scripts are technical documents created
by screenwriters and serve as an essential reference for ﬁlm-
makers. Blocks of text divided into scene headers, scene
descriptions, speakers, and utterances are parts of a standard
movie script. The critical point is the different indentations used
for every block. The typical format of scripts is shown in Fig. 3.
We converted these scripts into a processed set of scenarios
and
dialogues
where
individual
characters’
information
is
extracted and exploited using the information about indentation.
We would refer to them as character dictionaries for the rest of
this paper. We ﬁrst converted PDF ﬁles into HTML format and
used BeautifulSoup (Richardson, 2007)—a Python library for
pulling data out of HTML—and regex to create character
dictionaries. In the HTML ﬁles, the style attribute of every
element has a property named ‘left’ and ‘top’, which indicates the
value of the starting pixel from the left, i.e., indentation and
dialogue sequence, respectively. We have stored the processed
version of scripts in JSON format, i.e., attribute-value pairs, where
the attribute is the name of the character and the value is the list
of dialogues.
In the next step, we created a database from the character
dictionaries by further processing the data. Screenwriters some-
times add extra text to the character’s name, such as (V.O.),
(O.S.), etc., suggesting a voice-over or off-screen dialogue. First,
we processed such terms and deleted this extra information
because it is irrelevant to our study. Then, we tagged each
character with their respective genders.
Furthermore, we added the movie’s name and the year it was
released into the database for visualisation and analysis purposes.
Finally, we dropped the characters with less than ﬁve dialogues
since they did not contribute to our results in a meaningful way.
Performing all these steps, we generated a ﬁnal database, which
was also manually validated to ensure its correctness.

Emotion recognition module. In this section, we present the
second module of this study, i.e., the emotion recognition mod-
ule. This module includes ﬁnding sentiments and emotions for
each character.
Sentiment analysis. We ﬁrst used the Stanza package (Qi et al.,
2020) to ﬁnd the sentiment of every dialogue. Stanza is a Python
natural language analysis package that supports sentiment ana-
lysis on raw text from diverse sources as input. It produces
annotations without having to annotate or tokenize the text
manually. It is built with a highly accurate CNN classiﬁer pipeline
trained on 112 datasets, enabling efﬁcient training and evaluation
of annotated data. The reason for using Stanza is that it is built on
top of the PyTorch library (Paszke et al., 2019), which gives a
high-speed performance on GPU-enabled machines and has
better accuracy than other under-optimised models. Stanza clas-
siﬁed each dialogue as positive, negative, or neutral. However,
more than 70% of the conversations organised by Stanza were
neutral. Therefore, Stanza did not provide much information
about the bias in male or female characters.
These results prompted us to check the validity of the Stanza
model, for which we used the trivial approach of manually
annotating the data ourselves and then comparing the result with
the Stanza model. To reduce the bias, the same data were
manually annotated by two different people, and 179 dialogues
spoken by Harry in the Harry Potter series were chosen
randomly. After comparing the accuracy of the model with
human evaluation, we acquire the following accuracy scores
shown in Table 1.
Emotion detection. By looking at the results of Stanza, we came
to know that the overall outlook of positivity and negativity was
not drastically different. But, generally, the emotions conveyed
by humans are much more complex than only positive and
negative. Therefore, for deeper analysis, we ran NRCLex on
every dialogue. NRCLex takes a string, i.e., dialogue, as input
and returns the emotion scores for the primary eight emotions.
Those primary emotions can also be grouped into positive and
negative, as suggested by Robert Plutchik. The model classiﬁes
joy, anticipation, trust, and surprise as positive emotions and
anger, fear, sadness, and disgust as negative emotions. Com-
parison of genders based on positive vs. negative emotions
represented in Fig. 4.
By running NRCLex, we converted every dialogue into an
embedding of eight dimensions. Each dimension represents one
primary emotion, and its value is a ﬂoating-point number
showing the likelihood of that sentence conveying that emotion.
A sentence could be conveying multiple emotions with varying
intensities (Ward and Grower, 2020). It’s a probability distribu-
tion. Therefore, the embedding or vector sums up to one.
Furthermore, we analysed these primary emotions based on
Plutchik’s emotion wheel as shown in Fig. 5. Psychologist Robert
Plutchik proposes it through his famous “wheel of emotions”
(Mohsin and Beltiukov, 2019). The model shows the intensities of
different emotions and how they are interconnected. We use this
model as a reference to create complex emotions.
We computed 24 secondary emotions by averaging the scores
of two primary emotions, e.g., envy was derived by taking an
average score of sadness and anger. Lastly, we augmented this
new information with the previous database and converted every
dialogue into a vector of dimension 32. Since there are eight
primary emotions and 24 secondary emotions based on Plutchik’s
wheel of emotion (Mohsin and Beltiukov, 2019). The list of
emotions are; anger, joy, anticipation, surprise, trust, delight,

Analysis module. In this section, we present the third module of
this study, i.e., the analysis module. This module describes major
trends in the data and how characters are written.
Clustering. Clustering is the process of splitting a population or
set of data points into many groups so that data points in the
same group are more similar than data points in other groups
(Thomas, 2022). To put it another way, the goal is to separate
groups with similar characteristics and assign them to clusters.
In our ﬁnal database, we averaged the emotion scores of
characters based on all of their dialogues. This new database has a
size of 457 x 32, where 457 is the total number of characters. In
our database, the ratio of male and female characters is roughly
3:1, i.e., for every female character, there are three male
characters. The idea behind applying clustering is that if there
is no bias in how male and female characters are written, the
clusters made should also follow more or less the same ratio as
there is in the data.
We use both k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
First of all, we used the elbow method on the sum of squared
distances to ﬁnd the optimal number of clusters, which turned
out to be seven. For Agglomerative clustering, we use euclidean
distance and ward’s linkage, a method for hierarchical clustering.
The results of clustering are discussed in section ‘Clustering’.
Results
This section discusses the ﬁndings of our analysis using Empiri-
cal, Machine Learning, and statistical techniques.
Gender distribution over the years. We have compared the ratio
of male and female distribution over the years based on the
number of their presence and based on the number of their
dialogues. Figure 6 shows grouped total number of characters
over the last 20 years. During the years 2000–2004, only 15.1% of
characters were females however, during 2015–2019, this per-
centage increased to 43.9%. It is observed that with the evolution
of time, gender distribution is getting more or less balanced.
Mann–Whitney U-test. Based on NRCLex, we have extracted the
emotions expressed by male and female characters from their
dialogues in all the movies. The obtained emotion score was
within the range of 0-1. For detailed analysis, we performed the
Mann–Whitney U-test—a form of inferential statistic used to see
if there is a signiﬁcant difference between two groups’ means—on
all 32 emotions in the two gender groups. We choose the
Mann–Whitney U-test because it is non-parametric and robust
against non-normality, and our data is not normal. Through this
comparison, we found some notable differences in the distribu-
tion of some emotions. The analysis showed that male and female
characters exhibit most emotions like anger, aggressiveness, des-
pair, envy, outrage, and love very differently from one another.
Male characters have higher values for emotions like anger and
aggressiveness. On the other hand, female characters have higher

values for emotions such as joy. These results are in line with the
gender stereotypes in our society. Women are perceived to be
more loving and caring, whereas men are supposed to be more
aggressive and powerful.
The U1, U2, and P-value scores of some emotions are shown in
Table 2.
Visualising data. Box plots comparison of female vs. male on
average emotion scores is shown in Fig. 7. Female plots are shown
in blue colour, and the male plot is shown in red colour.
According to our results, it is observed that male characters have
higher scores on the emotions such as aggressiveness and dom-
inance, and female characters have higher scores on emotions
such as joy.
We have used the t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique to
visualise the characters’ data. It calculates a similarity measure
based on the distance between points and maintains the global
structure. In other words, it converts some N-dimensional data
into k-dimensional data, where k < N and x1, x2, …, xK are the
new axes for the data. In the visualisation shown in Fig. 8, male
characters are represented as blue and female characters as red. It
is observed that most females are crowded at the centre, whereas
the males are clustered sparsely. This uneven distribution shows a
pattern in which characters are primarily written in movies. With
the exception of two, most female characters exhibit more or less
the same emotions, implying they are written in the same way. In
contrast, male characters in the ﬁlm exhibit a range of emotions
and have much more diverse personality traits showing a
difference in how they are written.
Dialogues analysis. In order to analyse the variations in the
dialogues spoken by male and female characters, we performed a
sentence-level analysis, which involved extracting the most
commonly used words by both genders.
We plotted a word cloud of the words spoken by male and
female characters. A word cloud is a graphic depiction of a text’s
most commonly occurring terms. Each word’s size in a word
cloud reﬂects how frequently it appears in the text. The word
cloud will give us insight into the common themes of words the
characters use more often. In Fig. 9, the word clouds, matching
nouns used by male and female characters were excluded in order
to trace the unique differences between each gender. In this
illustration, we notice that the female characters’ dialogues
commonly included the nouns: kitchen, fashion, dress, skirt,
sweetheart, and madam; meanwhile, the male characters used the
nouns: time, business, war, world, man, and home. These results
imply that female characters are shown to be more inclined
towards their clothes and household chores. This is also in line
with other studies on gender roles (Collins, 2011). In comparison,

male characters are shown as more ambitious and concerned with
business and the world. These results correlate with social
stereotypes of gender (Yu et al., 2022) in our society.
Clustering. For further analysis to ﬁnd out if there is an implicit
bias between the traits of male and female characters, we have
clustered characters together into seven smaller groups. The
clusters are formed based on the similarity between characters,
and we can safely say that the groups represent the type or nature
of the characters in general. Therefore, characters with similar
traits will be grouped and of somewhat the same category. The
overall ratio of male and female characters in our database is 3:1.
And if there were no bias in how the characters are written, the
proportion of male and female characters would be similar in the
clusters. However, we employed two different techniques to
cluster them, and in both of them, there was an uneven ratio of
genders in the smaller groups, as shown in Fig. 10. Some groups
even have a balance of around 6:1, which implies high bias in
writing those kinds of characters.
Conclusion
Pop culture plays a signiﬁcant role in shaping societal perceptions
and attitudes towards gender roles. Through various forms of
media such as television, ﬁlm, music, and social media, pop
culture presents images and storylines that can reinforce or
challenge traditional gender roles. On the other hand, pop culture
can also challenge these stereotypes by featuring strong and
complex female characters or depicting men in traditionally
feminine roles. Pop culture can also inﬂuence how individuals
understand and perform their own gender, by providing exam-
ples of gender expression and behaviours.
In this study, we have analysed gender representation in a
collection of movies and how gender distribution changed over
time. Compared to previous works, we rely not only on word
vectors but create new embeddings by analysing the emotions
associated with these words. We looked into how stereotypes are
presented via emotions, making the results more intuitive. Fur-
thermore, we highlighted the hidden bias by using clustering and
other ML techniques. The result of this study suggests that
although over years the women portrayal have greatly improved,
underneath the surface, implicit biases exist. Our clustering
results indicate that while the male characters enjoy a variety of
emotions when they are portrayed, women are clustered together
following the same emotional pattern.
This insight is strengthened by our sentiment analysis of the
characters. We found that different kinds of positive emotions are
associated with different genders. Those emotions reﬂect the
stereotypes that exist in our society. For example, men are shown
to be more dominant and envious than women, and women are
shown to be more optimistic and joyful.
The result also indicates that the script writers and the movie
producers should be aware of these available biases. There should
be a conscious effort to question the portrayal of the characters to
make sure the individuality of the characters, independent of their
gender, is respected.
We believe that the implicit gender biases are not only available
in the movie industry but in a plethora of other cultural products.
As a future research direction, it would be interesting to inves-
tigate other areas, for example music and conceptual art industry.
