Information Definition  
within Entropic Information Theory 
 
“Information is a transition between different quantum states 
due to the modification of at least one degree of freedom” 
 
Olivier Denis 
 
 
information is conceptualized as a dynamic transition between quantum states, initiated by 
changes in a system's degrees of freedom. 
 
This model emphasizes the entropic nature of information, suggesting that the encoding of 
information within quantum states is inherently tied to the system's entropy. 
 
By this definition, information is both a marker of the system's current state and a driver of its 
entropic evolution.  
 
The EIT model provides a framework where the entropy and information are co-dependent, 
highlighting the role of information in shaping the entropy of a quantum system.
