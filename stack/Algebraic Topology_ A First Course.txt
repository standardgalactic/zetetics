Preface
To the Teacher. This book is designed to introduce a student to some
of the important ideas of algebraic topology by emphasizing the re-
lations of these ideas with other areas of mathematics. Rather than
choosing one point of view of modern topology (homotopy theory,
simplicial complexes, singular theory, axiomatic homology, differ-
ential topology, etc.), we concentrate our attention on concrete prob-
lems in low dimensions, introducing only as much algebraic machin-
ery as necessary for the problems we meet. This makes it possible to
see a wider variety of important features of the subject than is usual
in a beginning text. The book is designed for students of mathematics
or science who are not aiming to become practicing algebraic topol-
ogists—without, we hope, discouraging budding topologists. We also
feel that this approach is in better harmony with the historical devel-
opment of the subject.
What would we like a student to know after a first course in to-
pology (assuming we reject the answer: half of what one would like
the student to know after a second course in topology)? Our answers
to this have guided the choice of material, which includes: under-
standing the relation between homology and integration, first on plane
domains, later on Riemann surfaces and in higher dimensions; wind-
ing numbers and degrees of mappings, fixed-point theorems; appli-
cations such as the Jordan curve theorem, invariance of domain; in-
dices of vector fields and Euler characteristics; fundamental groups
and covering spaces; the topology of surfaces, including intersection
numbers; relations with complex analysis, especially on Riemann sur-

faces; ideas of homology, De Rham cohomology, tech cohomology,
and the relations between them and with fundamental groups; meth-
ods of calculation such as the Mayer—Vietoris and Van Kampen theo-
rems; and a taste of the way algebra and "functorial" ideas are used
in the subject.
To achieve this variety at an elementary level, we have looked at
the first nontrivial instances of most of these notions: the first ho-
mology group, the first Dc Rham group, the first Cech group, etc.
In the case of the fundamental group and covering spaces, however,
we have bowed to tradition and included the whole story; here the
novelty is on the emphasis on coverings arising from group actions,
since these are what one is most likely to meet elsewhere in mathe-
matics.
We have tried to do this without assuming a graduate-level knowl-
edge or sophistication. The notes grew from undergraduate courses
taught at Brown University and the University of Chicago, where about
half the material was covered in one-semester and one-quarter courses.
By choosing what parts of the book to cover—and how many of the
challenging problems to assign—it should be possible to fashion courses
lasting from a quarter to a year, for students with many backgrounds.
Although we stress relations with analysis, the analysis we require or
develop is certainly not "hard analysis."
We start by studying questions on open sets in the plane that are
probably familiar from calculus: When are path integrals independent
of path? When are I -forms exact? (When do vector fields have po-
tential functions?) This leads to the notion of winding number, which
we introduce first for differentiable paths, and then for continuous
paths. We give a wide variety of applications of winding numbers,
both for their own interest and as a sampling of what can be done
with a little topology. This can be regarded as a glimpse of the general
principle that algebra can be used to distinguish topological features,
although the algebra (an integer!) is fairly meager.
We introduce the first De Rham cohomology group of a plane do-
main, which measures the failure of closed forms to be exact. We
use these groups, with the ideas of earlier chapters, to prove the Jor-
dan curve theorem. We also use winding numbers to study the sin-
gularities of vector fields. Then I-chains are introduced as convenient
objects to integrate over, and these are used to construct the first ho-
mology group. We show that for plane open sets homology, winding
numbers, and integrals all measure the same thing; the proof follows
ideas of Brouwer, Artin, and Ahlfors, by approximating with grids.
As a first excursion outside the plane, we apply these ideas to sur-

faces, seeing how the global topology of a surface relates to local
behavior of vector fields. We also include applications to complex
analysis. The ideas used in the proof of the Jordan curve theorem are
developed more fully into the Mayer—V ietoris story, which becomes
our main tool for calculations of homology and cohomology groups.
Standard facts about covering spaces and fundamental groups are
discussed, with emphasis on group actions. We emphasize the con-
struction of coverings by patching together trivial coverings, since
these ideas are widely used elsewhere in mathematics (vector bundles,
sheaf theory, etc.), and Cech cocycles and cohomology, which are
widely used in geometry and algebra; they also allow, following
Grothendieck, a very short proof of the Van Kampen theorem. We
prove the relation among the fundamental group, the first homology
group, the first Dc Rham cohomology group, and the first Cech co-
homology group, and the relation between cohomology classes, dif-
ferential forms, and the coverings arising from multivalued functions.
We then turn to the study of surfaces, especially compact oriented
surfaces. We include the standard classification theorem, and work
out the homology and cohomology, including the intersection pairing
and duality theorems in this context. This is used to give a brief in-
troduction to Riemann surfaces, emphasizing features that are acces-
sible with little background and have a topological flavor. In partic-
ular, we use our knowledge of coverings to construct the Riemann
surface of an algebraic curve; this construction is simple enough to
be better known than it is. The Riemann—Roch theorem is included,
since it epitomizes the way topology can influence analysis. Finally,
the last part of the book contains a hint of the directions the subject
can go in higher dimensions. Here we do include the construction and
basic properties of general singular (cubical) homology theory, and
use it for some basic applications. For those familiar with differential
forms on manifolds, we include the generalization of De Rham theory
and the duality theorems.
The variety of topics treated allows a similar variety of ways to use
this book in a course, since many chapters or sections can be skipped
without making others inaccessible. The first few chapters could be
used to follow or complement a course in point set topology. A course
with more algebraic topology could include the chapters on funda-
mental groups and covering spaces, and some of the chapters on sur-
faces. It is hoped that, even if a course does not get near the last third
of the book, students will be tempted to look there for some idea of
where the subject can lead. There is some progression in the level of
difficulty, both in the text and the problems. The last few chapters

x
Preface
may be best suited for a graduate course or a year-long undergraduate
course for mathematics majors.
We should also point out some of the many topics that are omitted
or slighted in this treatment: relative theory, homotopy theory, fibra-
tions, simplicial complexes or simplicial approximation, cell com-
plexes, homology or cohomology with coefficients, and serious ho-
mological algebra.
To the Student. Algebraic topology can be thought of as the study of
the shapes of geometric objects. It is sometimes referred to in popular
accounts as "rubber-sheet geometry." In practice this means we are
looking for properties of spaces that are unchanged when one space
is deformed into another. "Doughnuts and teacups are topologically
the same." One problem of this type goes back to Euler: What re-
lations are there among the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces in
a convex polytope, such as a regular solid, in space? Another early
manifestation of a topological idea came also from Euler, in the
Konigsberg bridge problem: When can one trace out a graph without
traveling over any edge twice? Both these problems have a feature
that characterizes one of the main attractions, as well as the power,
of modem algebraic topology—that a global question, depending on
the overall shape of a geometric object, can be answered by data that
are collected locally. Since these are so appealing—and perhaps to
capture your interest while we turn to other topics—they are included
as problems with hints at the end of this Preface.
In fact, modern topology grew primarily out of its relation with
other subjects, particularly analysis. From this point of view, we are
interested in how the shape of a geometric object relates to, or con-
trols, the answers to problems in analysis. Some typical and histor-
ically important problems here are:
(i) whether differential forms w on a region that are closed (dw =
0) must be exact (w = dpj) depends on the topology of the region;
(ii) the behavior of vector fields on a surface depends on the topol-
ogy of the surface; and
(iii) the behavior of integrals f
depends on the topology
of the surface y2 = R(x), here with x and y complex variables.
In this book we will begin with the first of these problems, working
primarily in open sets in the plane. There is one disadvantage that
must be admitted right away: this geometry is certainly flat, and lacks
some of the appeal of doughnuts and teacups. Later in the book we

Preface
xi
will in fact discuss generalizations to curved spaces like these, but at
the start we will stick to the plane, where the analysis is simpler. The
topology of open sets in the plane is more interesting than one might
think. For example, even the question of the number of connected
components can be challenging. The famous Jordan curve theorem,
which is one of our goals here, says that the complement of a plane
set that is homeomorphic to a circle always has two components—a
fact that will probably not surprise you, but whose proof is not so
obvious. We will also spend some time on the second problem, which
includes the popular problem of whether one can "comb the hair on
a billiard ball." We will include some applications to complex anal-
ysis, later discussing some of the ideas related to the third problem.
To read this book you need a basic understanding of fundamental
notions of the other topology, known as point set topology or general
topology. This means that you should know what is meant by words
like connected, open, closed, compact, and continuous, and some of
the basic facts about them. The notions we need are recalled in Ap-
pendix A; if most of this is familiar to you, you should have enough
prerequisites. Because of our approach via analysis, you will also
need to know some basic facts about calculus, mainly for functions
of one or two variables. These calculus facts are set out in Appendix
B. In algebra you will need some basic linear algebra, and basic no-
tions about groups, especially abelian groups, which are recalled or
proved in Appendix C.
There will be many sorts of exercises. Some exercises will be rou-
tine applications of or variations on what is done in the text. Those
requiring (we estimate) a little more work or ingenuity will be called
problems. Many will have hints at the end of the book, for you to
avoid looking at. There will also be some projects, which are things
to experiment on, speculate about, and try to develop on your own.
For example, one general project can be stated right away: as we go
along, try to find analogues in 3-space or n-space for what we do in
the plane. (Some of this project is carried out in Part Xl.)
Problem 0.1. Suppose X is a graph, which has a finite number of
vertices (points) and edges (homeomorphic to a closed interval), with
each edge having its endpoints at vertices, and otherwise not inter-
secting each other. Assume X is connected. When, and how, can you
trace out X, traveling along each edge just once? Can you prove your
answer?

Exercise 0.2. Let v, e, and I be the number of vertices, edges, and
faces on a convex polyhedron. Compute these numbers for the five
regular solids, for prisms, and some others. Find a relation among
them. Experiment with other polyhedral shapes.
(Note: This problem is "experimental." Proofs are not expected.)

PART I
CALCULUS IN THE PLANE
In this first part we will recall some basic facts about differentiable
functions, forms, and vector fields, and integration over paths. Much
of this should be familiar, although perhaps from a different point of
view. At any rate, several of these notions will be needed later, so
we take this opportunity to fix the ideas and notation. And of course,
we will be looking particularly at the role played by the shapes (to-
pology) of the underlying regions where these things are defined. For
the facts that we use, sec Appendix B either for precise statements
or proofs. Most of this material is included mainly for motivation,
and will be developed from a purcly topological point of view later;
one fact proved in the first chapter—that a closed I-form on an open
rectangle is the differential of a function—will be used later.
In the second chapter we will see that for any smooth path not
passing through the origin, it is possible to define a smooth function
that measures how the angle is changing as one moves along the path.
This gives us a notion of winding number—how many times a closed
path "goes around" the origin. Facts about changing variables in in-
tegrals are used to see what happens to integrals and winding numbers
when paths are reparametrized and deformed. The third section in-
cludes a reinterpretation of the facts from the first chapter in vector
field language, and gives a physical interpretation of these ideas to
fluid flow. Although we will not use these facts in the book, we will
study vector fields later, and it should be useful to have some feeling
for them, if you don't already.

1. Path Integrals
Exercise 1.1. Prove that a function on an open set U in the plane is
locally constant if and only if it is constant on each connected com-
ponent of U. In other words, defining a locally constant function on
U is the same as specifying a constant for each of its connected com-
ponents.
1ff is locally constant, then äf/dx=O and äf/3y=O (identically,
as functions on U), as follows immediately from the definitions of
partial derivatives. The converse is also true and only slightly harder:
Proposition 1.2. /f f is a smooth function on U, then f is locally
constant if and only if Bf/äx =0 and äf/8y =0.
Proof. The point is that, in a rectangular neighborhood of a point of
U, the condition af/ax = 0 means thatf is independent of x, i.e., that
f is constant along horizontal lines. Likewise 8f/By = 0 means that f
is constant along vertical lines, and both conditions make f constant
in the rectangle.
U
It may not be much, but there is a grain of topology in this:
Corollary 1.3. The open set U is connected if and only if every smooth
function f in U with ôf/öx = 0 and äf/By =0 is constant.
A differential 1-form, or just a I-form, on U is given by a pair of
smooth functions p and q on U. We will usually denote a 1-form by
w, and we will write w=pdx+qdy. This can be regarded as just a
formal notation, with the dx and dy there merely to indicate what we
will do with I-forms, namely integrate them over paths. The pair of
functions (p,q) can also be identified with a vector field on U. For
this interpretation, sec §2c in Chapter 2.
By a smooth path (just called a path in this chapter) in U, we mean
a mapping y: [a,
—> U from a bounded interval into U that is con-
tinuous on [a, b] and differentiable in the open interval (a, h); in ad-
dition, to avoid any trouble at the endpoints, we assume the two com-
ponent functions of 'y can be extended to
functions in some
neighborhood of [a, fri. So i(t) = (x(t),y(t)), where x and y are re-
strictions of smooth functions on an interval2 (a — c, h + r), for some
2 In fact, therc are many extensions of these functions to such neighborhoods, but
we will never care about values outside the interval

to assure that the derivatives of these functions are continuous on the whole closed
interval la,bl

positive number E. We call
the initial point of *y, and 'y(b) the
final point; y(a) and
are called the endpoints, and we say that y
is a path from y(a) to y(b).
With wpdx+qdy as above, and
a path given by the pair of
functions "y(t) = (x(t),y(t)), the integral f1w of w along
is defined
by the formula

Lw = f

Note that the integrand is continuous on [a, hi, so the integral exists,
as a limit of Riemann sums.
The question we will be concerned with is this: given a I -form w
on U, when does the integral
w depend only on the endpoints y(a)
and
of y, and not on the actual path between them?
y1(h) =
y1(a) = y1(a)
Language is usually abused here, saying the integral is "independent
of path." This happens whenever there is a "potential function":
Proposition 1.4. If cv = af/öx dx + af/ay dy, for some
function f
on an open set containing the path y, then
Lw =

We write df
äf/t9xdx + Bf/äydy for this 1-form, and say that w
is the differential off if w = df.
Exercise 1.5. Show that df

For an cxample, take U to be the right half plane, i.e., the set of
points (x, y) with x> 0. Consider the functionf that measures the an-
gle in polar coordinates, measured counterclockwise from the x-axis.

Although the function fix, y) = tan - '(y/x), at least as it stands, is

tion
can, at least away from the origin. This is clear if we
think of it geometrically as the angle in polar coordinates, which can
be extended, for example, to the complement of the negative x-axis:

However, there is trouble in trying to extend this angle function to
be well defined everywhere on

last proposition to show that there is no smooth function g on

with dg = to0. For example, if y(t) = (cos(t), sin(t)), Os t s 2-rr, is the
counterclockwise path around the unit circle, we calculate using the

same initial and final points; (ii)
to = 0 for all segmented paths
'r in U that are closed; and (iii) cv = dffor some smooth function f

hence path-connected (see Appendix A2). Choose and fix an arbitrary

Challenge. Can you show that any two points in a connected open
set can be connected by an arc, i.e., a path that is one-to-one, and
whose tangent vector never vanishes?
Ic. A Criterion for Exactness
We want a practical criterion to tell if a given 1-form w is the dif-
ferential of some function without going to the work of constructing
such a function. We shall need another fact from calculus, the equal-
ity of mixed partial derivatives: 8/ax(af/oy) = 8/8y(af/84.
This
translates to a simple
Criterion 1.10. w =p dx + q dy cannot be the differential of a func-
tion unless Bq/Bx = ap/ay.
This necessary condition, however, is not always sufficient. For
example, if
is the I-form on U =
\ {(0, 0)} that we looked at
earlier, you can verify easily that w0 satisfies this condition—either
by direct calculation, or by the fact that any point in U has a neigh-
borhood on which the restriction of w0 is the differential of a func-
tion—but we have seen that
cannot be the differential of any func-
tion on U. We also saw that the restrictions of
to some simpler
open sets, like the right half plane, are the differentials of functions.
We will see that it is the topology of U that is controlling this situ-
ation.
A 2-form on U is an expression hdxdy, where h is a
function
on U. Logically, as before, a 2-form can be identified with the func-
tion h that defines it, with the "dxdy"
playing only a formal role.
The notation indicates that we will use 2-forms for integrating over
two-dimensional regions. All we will need is double integrals
over rectangles R = [a, hJ X [c, d], defined as limits of Riemann sums.

So our criterion can be stated: if cv = df, then dcv = 0; or simply that
d(df) = 0 for all functionsf.
Let R = [a, bJ X [c, ci] be a closed (bounded) rectangle, and con-
sider the four boundary segments:

'y3(t)=(t,d), astb;
12(t)=(b,t), ctsd;

The last calculation in the proof of Proposition 1.8 shows that 3f/äx =p,

(x0, y0 — t), 0
t  y0 — y; and similarly if x <XØ, replace y2(t) by
(x0—t,y),
Similarly, define a function g by g(P) =
to, where
is the path
that first goes horizontally from (x0, y0) to (x, y0) and then goes ver-
tically from (x, y0) to (x, y). The same argument, again left as an ex-
ercise, shows that 8g/äy = q. Our assumptions on U imply that the
closed rectangle with opposite corners at P0 and P is contained in U,
so that Green's theorem can be applied, and it follows from Lemma
1.11 thatf(P) is equal to g(P). It follows that 3f/äx = p and öf/äy =
which means that df= to.
Exercise 1.13. Show that the proposition is also true when U is the
inside ofadisk, i.e., U{(x,y):(x—a)2 +(y—b)2<r2}. Can you prove
it when U is any convex region, or any starshaped region? (Convex
means that the straight line between any two points in the region is
contained in the region, and starshaped means that there is a point P0
in the region such that for any point P in the region, the straight line
from P0 to P is contained in the region.)
A I-form to is called closed if thu = 0, and it is exact if to = df for
some functionf. So all exact forms are closed, and the last proposition
says that, when U is a rectangle, all closed forms are exact. There
are many other regions U for which this is true, besides rectangles
and those in the preceding exercise. For example, if U is the union

Ic. A Criterion for Exactness
13
of any two rectangles, each as in the proposition, then any closed 1-
form w in U is exact.
To see this, let U1 and U2 be the two open rectangles whose union
is U. By the proposition, there are functionsf1 in U1 andf2 in
such
that df1 = w on
and df2 = w on U2. Since U1 fl U, is connected,
and since d(f2—f1)=w—w=O on U1flU2, it follows thatf2—f1 is
a constant function on U1 fl U2. If we replacef2 byf'2 — c, where c is
this constant, we can assumef1 andf2 agree on U1 fl U2. This means
that there is a function I on U = U1 U U2 whose restriction to U1 1sf
and whose restriction to U2 isf2. Moreover, df= w on all of U, since
this condition is a local condition, to be verified at each point of U;
and every point is either in U1 or U2, where we know df = w and
df2=w.
In fact, this argument proves:
Lemma 1.14. Suppose U1 and U2 are open sets, and U1 fl U2 is con-
nected. Let U = U1 U U2, and let w be a 1-form on U. If the restric-
tions of w to U1 and U2 are both exact, then w is exact on U.
U
The connectedness of U1 fl U2 is crucial for this. For example, sup-
pose U1 and U2 are the regions indicated, with the shaded overlap,
and the origin outside in the middle.
Let w be the restriction of
to U, then
is the differential of a
function on each of the regions, but not on their union, as can be seen
by integrating w along a path around the origin in U.

then w is exact on U.
If w is a closed 1-form in an open set U, although w may not be
exact on all of U, it follows from Proposition 1. 12 that it is always
locally exact. That is, any point in U has a neighborhood (say rect-
angular), so that the restriction of w to this neighborhood is the dif-
ferential of a function. This can bc used to calculate path integrals,
by cutting the path into pieces, on each of which Proposition 1.4 can
be applied:

division. One quick way to do it is to use the Lebesgue covering
lemma (see §A4 of Appendix A), which guarantees that, if the sub-
division is small enough, each subinterval will be mapped into one
of the neighborhoods

CHAPTER 2
Angles and Deformations
2a. Angle Functions and Winding Numbers
Any point in the plane can be expressed in polar coordinates, i.e., it
can be written in the form (rcos({}), rsin({))) for some r0 and some
real number ii. The radius r is unique, being the distance from the
origin, or the square root of the sums of the squares of the Cartesian
coordinates. At the origin, r = 0, and * can be any number. We often
denote the origin simply by 0 instead of (0, 0). Except for the origin,
the angle ii is determined only up to adding integral multiples of 2'rr.
We call any of these numbers an angle for the point.
Suppose 'y: [a,
—>
\ {0} is a
path to the complement of the
origin, given in Cartesian coordinates by 1(t) = (x(t),y(t)). We want
to describe this in polar coordinates, that is, to find
functions r(t)
and *(t) so that
(2.1)
y(t) = r(t)(cos(*(t)), sin(*(t))) = (r(t) cos(*(t)), r(t)sin(*(t)))
for all a  it  b. There is no problem with the function r: it is the
distance from the origin, defined by
r(t) =
= Vxw2 + y(t)2.
The angle function is not so simple. At any time t, there are many
possible angles to choose, all differing by multiples of 2-ri. If we choose
them say all lying in the interval (—-rr,'rr] they would be unique, but
then would not vary continuously if the point crosses the negative
x-axis.
17

2. Angles and Deformations
The initial angle can be chosen arbitrarily. In other words, choose
any number
so that
'y(a) = (x(a),y(a)) = (r(a)cos(*a),r(a)sin('Oa)).
We will require that our function
satisfy the initial condition
Motivated by the discussion in §lb, we have a candidate
for the derivative
which is the rate of change of angle: it should
be
—y(t)x'(t) + x(t)y'(t)
—y(t)x'(z) + x(t)y'(t)
=
r(t)
So we can define
to be the unique function with this initial con-
dition and this derivative. That is, we define tI(t) by
ç' —y(T)x'(T) + x(r)y'Qr)

•
dr.
r('r)
Proposition 2.2. With these definitions, the functions r(t) and
are
functions, and equation (2. 1) is satAfied for all t in [a, bj.
Proof. The function r(t) is cr since it is a composite of C€X functions,
and ft(t) is
since it is the integral of a
function. Let
u(t) = (cos(*(t)), sin(&(t)))
and
v(t) =
cos(b(t))).
These are perpendicular unit vectors for all t. We want to show that
—'y(t) = u(t)
r(t)
for all t. We are assuming that they are equal for t = a. It suffices to
show that both sides of this equation have the same dot product with
vectors u(t) and v(t), since the difference (1
— u(t) would then
be perpendicular to two independent vectors, and so would be zero.
For the right side of the equation u(t), these dot products are iden-
tically I and 0, respectively, so it suffices to prove that the same is
true for the left side. Since we know the equality of the vectors for
t = a, it suffices to prove that the derivatives of these dot products

is similar and left as an exercise.
Exercise 2.3. (a) Show that this function 0(t) is unique, and that in
fact it is the only continuous function with 0(a) = Oa such that (2.1)
holds. (b) Show that if Oa is replaced by Oa + 2irn for some n, then
the corresponding angle function is 0(t) + 2-rn.
Using this angle function, we can define the (total signed) change
in angle of the path y to be 0(b) — 0(a). Note by the preceding ex-
ercise that this is independent of the choice of initial angle. Equiva-
lently, this change in angle is

If a segmented path does not pass through the origin, i.e., it is a
path in
{0}, we want to define its winding number, which should
be the "net" number of times
goes around the origin, counting the
counterclockwise motion as positive, and the clockwise motion as
negative. In other words, it is the total signed change in angle, di-
vided by 2-rr. We will denote it by
0), the "0" indicating that
we are going around the origin. What we have just done shows what
the definition should be. We define the winding number of

Proposition 2.4. For any closed segmented path that does not pass
through the origin, the winding number of the path around the origin
is an integer.
Proof. The formula given before the proposition defines a number
W(y, 0) for any segmented path y that does not pass through the or-
igin. Suppose y starts at P and goes to Q, and we choose an angle
for P. We claim that 'Up + 2'rrW(y, 0) is an angle for Q. This will
prove the result, for when P Q it says that 'U,. and
'U,. + 2'rrW(i, 0)
define the same angle, so they must differ by an integer multiple of
271.
It suffices to prove the claim for a smooth path, since if -y is a sum
of smooth paths, the assertion for each of them implies it for the sum.
But when y: [a,
—' R2 \ {0}
is smooth, 'U,. + 2irW(, 0) is just the
value of our angle function 'U(t) at
t = b, starting with 'U(a) = 'U,., so
the result follows from Proposition 2.2.

In earlier centuries, before modern rigor required functions to be
single-valued, the I -form
would have been written as the differ-
ential dO of the multivalued function 'U. (In fact, this is still a common
and useful notation for this I-form, as long as one realizes that 'U is
not a function, so that Proposition 1 .4 is not contradicted!) The graph
of this multivalued function can be visualized in 3-space, as the locus
of points Cr, y, z) of the form (rcos('U), rsin(O), 0) for some r >0 and
real number 'U. This is closely related to the polar coordinate mapping
p: {(r,0): r>0} —> 1P2\{O}

Path integrals do not depend on the parametrization of the path, in
the following sense. Suppose w is a I-form
on an open set U in the
plane, and y: [a,bI—* U is a smoothpath, and suppose p: [a',h'i—>[a, hi

that maps a' to a and b'
to b. The path -yop is called a reparame-

The following problem shows how one could avoid dealing with
segmented paths: by turning around the corners very slowly!
Problem 2.13. (a) Construct a

taking 0 to a and 1 to b, such that all derivatives of p vanish at 0
and at I. (b) Use this to show that any smooth path can be repara-
metrized to a path with the same endpoints but such that all deriva-
tives vanish at the endpoints. (c) lf'y1: [a,b]—*U and

path .y*: [0, n] —> U, so that the restric-
tion of

Problem 2.14. Given a I-form w on an open set U, show that the
following are equivalent: (i) there is a function f on U with df= w;
(ii)
whenever
and S are
paths in U with the same
initial and final points; and (iii) f7w = 0 whenever
is a cc closed
path in U (i.e., with the initial point equal to the final point).
Problem 2.15. Given a I-form o on an open set U, show that the
following are equivalent: (i) dw = 0; (ii) I8RW = 0 for all closed rect-
angles R contained in U; and (iii) every point in U has a neighborhood
such that IBR 03 = 0 for all closed rectangles R contained in the neigh-
borhood. Is the same true if rectangles are replaced by disks?
Next we turn to the question of what happens when the path is
moved, or deformed. We consider first the case of a deformation of
paths with fixed endpoints. This will be given by a family of paths
for simplicity all defined on the same interval La,b], with the pa-
rameter s varying in another interval which we take to be the unit
interval [0, lJ. We will assume this is a smooth family, in the sense
that the coordinates of the point
are smooth functions of both s
and t. This means that we are given a mapping H from [a, b] x [0, 1]
to U, which we assume is
(this, as usual, means that the two
coordinate functions can be extended to be infinitely differentiable
functions on some open neighborhood of the rectangle). We assume
that H(a, s) = P and H(b, s) = Q for all 0 S s S 1. Set
= H(t, s),
so each 'y. is a path in U from P to Q.

We call H a smooth homotopy from thc path

say that two paths from an interval [a, b] to U, with the same initial
and final points, are smoothly homotopic in U if there is such a ho-
motopy from one to the other.
Proposition 2.16. If y and ö are smoothly homotopic paths from P
to Q in an open set U, and cv is a closed i-form in U, then

Proof. First we sketch a proof using only ideas from calculus. Let V
be a neighborhood of the rectangle R = [a, b] X [0, 1] mapped into U

tions of this mapping from V to U. Define a "pull-back" form

A little calculation, left to you, shows that dw* = 0 on V. By Green's
theorem, we therefore know that the integral of 0fK around the bound-
ary of R must be zero. Simpler calculations show that the integral of
along the bottom of the rectangle is f7co, that along the top is
.IsCt), and that the integrals along the two sides are zero. Putting this
all together gives the required equality.
Here is another proof, more topological in flavor. Each point in
the image 11(R) of the rectangle has a neighborhood on which cv is
exact. Applying the Lebesgue lemma, it follows that, if we subdivide
the rectangle small enough, by choosing

There is another kind of deformation or homotopy that is also im-
portant. This is a deformation of closed paths, through a family of
closed paths, but allowing the endpoints to vary. It is given by a
mapping H from a rectangle Ia,bI X [0, 1] into U, with the property
that H(a, s) = H(b, s) for every s in [0, lj. Each of the paths

motopic if there is such a smooth homotopy between them.
Proposition 2.17. If y and 3 are smoothly homotopic closed paths in
an open set U, and w is a closed 1-form in U, then
is
Proof. Either of the proofs of the last proposition works for this one.
The only point to notice is that the integrals of w over the two sides
of the rectangle may not be zero, but since the two paths given by H
on these two sides are the same (namely 7), these integrals
can-
cel. The details are left as an exercise.

Of course, it is crucial for this that the homotopy stays in the com-
plement of the point P!

lence relation.
2c. Vector Fields and Fluid Flow
We defined a 1-form on an open set U in the plane to be a pair of
smooth functions p and q on U. Such a pair of functions can also be
identified with a vector field on U, which assigns to each point (x,y)
in U the vector
V(x,y)
p(x,y)i + q(x,y)j.

into vector field language says that the corresponding vector field is

The function f (or sometimes —f) is called a potential function.
We'll finish this chapter with a quick sketch of the interpretation
of these ideas for case where the vector field gives the velocity of a
fluid flowing in an open set in the plane. So V(x,y) is the velocity
vector at (x, y). We assume the flow is in a steady state, which means
that, as written, this velocity vector depends only on the point (and
not on time). Let p and q be the components of V, as above.

2c. Vector Fields and Fluid Flow
29
The integral
dx + q dy represents the circulation of the fluid along
the path 'y, per unit of time. This can be seen from the interpretation
as the integral of the projection of the velocity vector in the tangent
direction along the curve. There
is another important integral,
f1 q dx — p dy, that represents the flux of the fluid across the path i
(per unit of time). To see this, let N(t) = (—dy/dt, dx/dt) be the nor-
mal vector, which is perpendicular to and 900 counterclockwise from
the tangent vector.
Then

This is the integral of the projection of the velocity vector in the nor-
mal direction, which measures the flow across y, from right to left
in the direction along
per unit of time.
The flow is called irrotational if the circulation around all small
closed loops is zero. By Problem 2. 15, this is true precisely when
=0, i.e., ôq/äx — 3p/8y
0. The function 3q/äx — lip/By is called
the curl of the vector field.
The flow is called incompressible if the net flow across small closed
loops is zero. Applying Problem 2.15 to the 1-form qdx—pdy, this
is equivalent to the condition that Bp/Bx + Bq/By = 0. The function
Bp/Bx + Bq/By is called the divergence of the vector field.
Exercise 2.20. If R is a rectangle (or disk) in (I, show that the integral
of the curl (identified with the 2-form (Bq/Bx — lip/By) dx dy) over R
is the circulation around BR, and the integral of the divergence is the
flux across BR.

These physical notions suggest a way to generalize the notion of a
winding number to higher dimensions. 1ff is a t map from a rect-
angle or disk R to EJV \ (0), let Nf(P) be the cross product of the col-
umns of the Jacobian matrix off at P, and let
V(x, y, z) =
(1 /4'rc)(x, y,

It is a good project to develop a notion of an "engulfing number,"
setting W(f, 0) =
V(f(P)) N1(P).


PART 11
WINDING NUMBERS
The notion of winding numbers is generalized to arbitrary continuous
paths, and the facts we proved in the smooth case using calculus are
proved here by purely topological arguments. We also look at what
happens when the point being wound around is varied. Finally, we
use the idea of winding numbers to define the degree of a mapping
from one circle to another, and to define the local degree of a mapping
from one open plane set to another.
In Chapter 4 there are several applications of winding numbers,
some written out, and many left as exercises and problems. Many of
these results generalize to higher dimensions; the names attached to
some of them refer to these generalizations.


CHAPTER 3
The Winding Number
3a. Definition of the Winding Number
For any point P in the plane, and any sector with vertex at P, we can
define a continuous (even Lx) angle function on the sector, although
the choice is unique only up to adding integral multiples of 2'rr. Here
angles are measured with reference to P, counterclockwise from the
horizontal line to the east of P:
If p = p, is the corresponding polar coordinate map:
p(r, 0) = P + (r cosQ&), r sin(0)),
a sector is the image of a strip {(r, 0): r>O and
0 and 02 are any real numbers with 0<02 —
S 2#rr. The fact that
this 0 is a continuous function on the sector can be seen directly,
35

36
3. The Winding Number
using formulas like the arc tangent, or topologically as follows: p is
one-to-one and continuous from the strip onto the sector, and it maps
small open rectangles {(r, *): a < r C b, a C -0 C
onto small open
sectors (bounded by two straight lines and arcs of two circles), so p is
open as well as continuous; it is therefore a homeomorphism (in fact
a diffeomorphism). This means that r and * are continuous functions
of x and y.
For any continuous path 'y: Ia, bJ—>
\ {P}, we define its winding
number W(y, P) as follows:
Step 1. Subdivide the interval into a = t0 tc
.
. .  t,, = b, so that
each subinterval
is mapped into somc sector with vertex at P.
Such a subdivision exists by the Lebesgue lemma, since each point
in the image of y is contained in some such sector.
Step 2. Choose such a sector U1 containing 'y([t1_1,t1J) and a core-
sponding angle function fi, on
for 1
i c n. Let P, = y(tJ,0 c
n.
Define
W(y, P) =
[ft11(P1) — -01(P0)) + (02(P,) —
2ir
+
—
= 1E(01(P1)—1(P1 1)).
Each term represents the net change in angle along that part of the
path.
Proposition 3.1. (a) The definition of a winding number is indepen-
dent of the choices made in Steps I and 2. (b) If y is a closed path,
i.e., y(a) = y(h), then W(y,P) is an integer.
Proof.
(a) To see that it is independent of the choices of the sectors
U, and the angle functions '0,, suppose U1' and -0/ were other choices.
Then
and
would differ by a constant (in fact, a multiple of 2ir)
on the component of the intersection of U1 and U1' that contains
t1J). So the difference in the values of '01 at the two points P1_1
and P1 is the same as the difference in values of '0/
at these two
points, and adding over i shows that the winding number doesn't
change.
So it is enough to show that the definition is independent of the

3a. Definition of the Winding Number
37
choice of subdivision. Suppose we add one point to a given subdi-
vision that satisfies the condition in Step I, say by inserting a point
between some
and t,. If U1 and
are chosen for
t/j, these
same U1 and '0 can also be chosen for the two subintervals
t*]
and It*,t11. And if P*
y(t*), then
—
+ (&1(P*) — 01(P1_3) =
-01(P1) —
so again the sum is unchanged. It follows that if we insert any finite
number of points into a given subdivision, the definition of the wind-
ing number will not change. But then, if two subdivisions both satisfy
the condition in Step I, the common refinement of both of them, ob-
tained by including all division points for each, will define the same
winding number as each of them.
(b) In general, the claim is that, even when sy is not closed, if *(J
is an angle for the initial point
then
+ 2ir Wey, P) is an angle
for the endpoint
When the path is closed, this implies that W('y, F)
is an integer. This claim is evident for the restriction of
to each
subinterval
, tJ on which there is a continuous angle function, and
the general case follows by adding up the results (or inducting on the
number of subintervals).

that in Chapter 2.
Exercise 3.3. Show that if 'y: [a, b]—> U is a closed path, and U is
an open set in
{P} on which there is a continuous angle function

Exercise 3.4. Show that winding numbers are invariant by transla-
tion, in the following sense. Let 'y:

vector in the plane. Let y + v be the path defined by (y + v)(t) = 'y(t) + v.
Show that
W(y+v,P+v) =

Proof. In fact, the second proofs we gave for Proposition 2. 16 and
2. 17 work equally well in this case. As there, use the Lebesgue lemma
to subdivide the rectangle into subrectangles
such that F maps
R11 into a sector U, / (with vertex at P), on which there is a continuous
angle function

is defined similarly as the signed sum of the winding
numbers around the small rectangles. But these winding numbers around
the small rectangles are all zero, since each

gion where there is an angle function
So
= 0.
H
This theorem implies that the winding numbers have the same in-
variance under homotopies as in the smooth case considered in §2b.
Again, there are two kinds of homotopies we want to consider, first
for paths with fixed endpoints, and second for closed paths.
If
fa,bJ—>U and 8: [a,b]—*U are paths with the same initial and
final points, a homotopy from
to 8 with fixed endpoints is a con-
tinuous mapping H: [a, b] X [0, II
> U such that
H(t,O)=y(t)
and H(t,l)8(t)
forall
H(a,s)=y(a)=8(a)
and
forall
The paths y, defined by
= H(t, s) give a continuous family of
smooth paths from *yo =
to
= 8. The paths i and 8 arc called
homotopic with fixed endpoints if there is such a homotopy H.
On the other hand, if 'y and 8 are closed paths in U, again defined
on the same interval [a, bJ, a homotopy from
to 8 through closed
paths is a continuous H: [a,hl X [0, lj—÷U, such that
H(t,0)'y(t)
and
H(t, l)=8(t)
forall
H(a,s)H(b,s)
forall
The paths 'y and 8 are called homotopic closed paths if there is such
a homotopy H.
Exercise 3.7. Prove that the relation of being homotopic with fixed
endpoints, or as closed paths, is an equivalence relation
Corollary 3.8. If two paths 'y and iS in
\
are homotopic, either
as paths with the same endpoints, or as closed paths, then
= W(8,P).
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the theorem, applied to
the homotopy H = 1'.
In the first case, the winding numbers of the
constant paths from the sides of the rectangle are both zero, and in
the second case they are the same, so their winding numbers cancel
in the result.
H
We next consider what happens to the winding number by a change

case.

(a) If w(c)a and ço(d)=h, then W(y°çv,P)= W(y,P).

ular, zf'['(t)y(a+b—t), acth, then
W(1 ',P) =
Proof. For (a), define
[a,b] X [c,dJ—*U by the formula
F(t, s) = 'y(min(t + p(s) — a, h)).
yoç
y(h)
Then F is continuous, since the minimum or composite of two con-
tinuous functions is continuous. The paths from the sides of F are
11 = 1'
=
and "12 and
are constant paths at the point y(b).
So Theorem 3.6 applies and gives (a). Similarly for (b), use
= "y(max(t+p(s)—b,a)).
in this case

and 14 are constant.
Exercise 3.10. Give a direct proof of Corollary 3.9 from the defi-
nition of the winding number, in case the change of coordinates p is
a monotone increasing or monotone decreasing function. (Monotone
increasing means that p(t) <p(s) if t C s.)
As another application, we have the "dog-on-a-leash" theorem of
Poincaré and BohI. This says if the leash is kept shorter than the
distance from the walker to the fire hydrant, then the walker and the
dog both wind around the hydrant the same number of times:

This is a continuous homotopy from

hypotheses imply that F maps the rectangle into R2 \ {P}. The result
therefore follows from Corollary 3.8.

W are closed paths
such
that

W(y, P) = W(8, P).
Proof. The hypothesis implies that neither path hits P, and that the
line segment between 'y(t) and 3(t) doesn't hit P.

Exercise 3.13. Show that if U is an open rectangle (bounded or un-
bounded), then any two paths from [a, b] to U with the same end-
points are homotopic, and any two closed paths in U are homotopic.
Show that the same is true for any convex open set U. Can you prove
it when U is just starshaped?
Problem 3.14. Let

(i)
y and 3 are homotopic in

(ii) W('y,P)=W(S,P); and
(iii)
if 9 and 3 are liftings of 'y and 3 with the same initial point, as
in Problem 3.5, then

and S are homotopic through closed paths in
{P} if and only if W(y, P) = W(S, P).
3c.
Varying the Point
We want to study what happens to the winding number if a closed
path y: [a,bJ—>W is fixed, and the point P is allowed to vary, but
always so that the path does not pass through P. Let us denote the
image of the path
by Supp(y), and call it the support of 'y, i.e.,
=
Since the interval is compact, the support is a compact, and hence
closed and bounded, subset of the plane. The complement of the sup-
port is an open set, which may have many—even infinitely many—
connected components, each of which is open. Since the support is
bounded, however, there is one connected component of
\ Supp(y)
that contains all points outside some large disk; this component is
called the unbounded component.
Proposition 3.16. As a function of P, the function W(y, P) is constant
on each connected component of
Supp(y). It vanishes on the un-
bounded component.
Proof. For the first statement, we must show that W('y, P) is a locally
constant function of P in W Supp(y). Given P, choose a disk around
P contained in W
We must show that
P') = W(y, P)
for all P' in the disk. Let vP' —P be the vector from P to P'. By
Exercise 3.4,
W(-y,P) = W('y+v,P+v) = W(7+v,P').
The homotopy H(t, s) = y(t) + sv, a S t S b, 0 S s, 5 1, is a homotopy
through closed paths from
to
+ v that never hits the point P',

so
=
To show that the winding number vanishes on the unbounded com-
ponent, it suffices to show it vanishes on one such point. For ex-
ample, we can take P far out on the negative x-axis, so that the sup-
port of y is contained in a half plane to the right of P. But then there
is an angle function on this half plane, so the winding number is zero
by Exercise 3.3.
LI
The following exercise gives alternative proofs of the proposition:
Exercise 3.17. (a) Prove directly from the definition that for any path
y, whether closed or not, the function P '-÷
P) is continuous on
the complement of Supp(y), and approaches zero when
goes to
infinity. (b) Use (a) and the fact that, when y is closed, W('y, P) takes
values in the integers to give another proof of the proposition. (c) For
a closed path y, show directly that
P) is constant on path com-
ponents of

F(t,s)=y(t)—o(s) and the point P0, where
r is any path in
p2 \ Supp(y).

If/is any closed interval, and C is any circle, a continuous closed
path
from I to an open set U is essentially the same thing as a
continuous mapping from C into U:
I.
This can be realized explicitly as follows. Let us assume that I = [0, 1],

44
3. The Winding Number
since this is the most common convention. Suppose C has center (x0, Yo)
and radius r. Let p: I—> C be the function that wraps I around C:
p(t) =
(x0,y0) + (rcos(2'rrt),rsin(2'rrt)),
Ot
1.
So p is a one-to-one mapping of / onto C, except that p(O) = &p(l).
It follows that if F is a mapping from C into an open set U, then
= Fop is a mapping from ito U with
= y(l), and that any such
can be realized in this way for a unique F.
Lemma 3.18. The mapping y is continuous if and only if F is con-
tinuous.
Proof. in fact, p realizes C as the quotient space of I with its end-
points 0 and I identified. Concretely, this means that a subset X of
C is open in C if and only if p'(X) is open in I. This is easy to verify
directly, or one can argue that the quotient space is a compact Haus-
dorff space, and the induced mapping from it to C, being continuous
and one-to-one, must be a homcomorphism. If follows that for an
open subset Vof U, U'(V) is open if and only if f'(V) =
is open, which proves the lemma.
For any continuous F: C—>
{P}, we can define the winding number
ofF around P, denoted W(F, P), to be the winding number W('y, P)
of the path y=Fop.
Exercise 3.19. Identify
with the complex numbers C, and let
f: C —> C be the mapping that takes a complex number z to its nth
power f, where n is an integer. Let C be any circle centered at the
origin, and let F be the restriction of f to C. Show that W(F, 0) = n.
if f(z) = —z, show that W(F, 0) = I.
Proposition 3.20. Suppose C is the boundary of the closed disk D,
and F: C—>
\ {P} extends to a continuous function from D to
\ {P}.
Then W(F,P)0.
Proof. If D is the disk of radius r about
the point (x0,y0)
as
above, and
[0, l]—>R2\{P} is the path corresponding to F, and
F:
is such an extension ofF, then
H(t, s) =
F((xo,yo) + s(rcos(2irt), rsin(2irt))),0tcl,
OssSl,
gives a homotopy from y to the constant path at the point F((x0,y0)).
This homotopy stays inside W {P}, and since the winding number
of a constant path is zero, the claim follows from Corollary 3.8.

Problem 3.21. If F0 and F1 are mappings from a circle C to U, cor-
responding to paths 'yo and

Problem 3.22. Show that the converse of Proposition 3.20 is true: if

Problem 3.23. Let C be a circle centered at the origin, and let F:

The same idea lets us define the degree of any continuous mapping
F from one circle C to another circle C', which measures how many
times the first circle is wound around the second by F. Let P' be the
center of the circle C', and define the degree of F by the formula
deg(F) = W(F,P').
Exercise 3.24. Show that one could take any point inside C' in place

from Cto C', i.e., if there is a continuous mapping H from C X [0,

to C', with F(Q)H(Qx0) and G(Q)H(QX I) for all Q in C,
then F and G have the same degree. (d) Show that if C is the boundary

Problem 3.27. If F: C—> C' and G: C' —> C" are continuous mappings
of circles, what can you say about the relation among the degrees of
F, G, and the composite Go F? Can you prove your answer?
These ideas can also be used to define an important notion of a
local degree. Suppose U and V are open sets in the plane, and F: U—> V
is a continuous mapping, and let P be a point in U. Assume that P
has some small neighborhood such that F(Q)

neighborhood with Q

within a distance r of P has the same image as P, and let CAP) be
the circle of radius r about P. Then F restricts to a continuous map-
ping from Cr(P) to

Define the local degree ofF at P. denoted
to be the winding
number of this mapping of the circle around the point F(P). In other
words,

To know that this is well defined, we need
Lemma 3.28. This winding number is independent of choice of r.
Proof. If r' is another, H(t, s) = F(P + ((1 — s)r + sr')(cos(2'rrt), sin(2'rrt)))
gives a homotopy from y. to
Equivalently, the local degree of F at P is the winding number of
the mapping from the unit circle S' to itself given by
F(P+rQ)—F(P)

by a (2 X 2)-matrix, and the determinant is not zero, then the local
degree of F at the origin is + 1 if this determinant is positive, and —
if this determinant is negative.
Problem 3.30. Show that if F: U—> V is a
mapping, and the Ja-
cobian determinant of F is not zero at P, then the local degree is
defined, and is + 1 or — 1, depending on the sign of this determinant.
Problem 3.31. Suppose F: C—> C is given by a complex polynomial.
Show that the local degree of F at a complex number z is the mul-
tiplicity of z as a root of F(T) — F(z). (This multiplicity is the highest
power of T — z that divides F(T) — F(z).)
Problem 3.32. If F: C—>C' is a map between circles in the plane,
and P is a point in C such that F(Q)

hood of P in C, give a precise definition of a local degree of F at F;
this should be + I if F is increasing at P, —
1 if F is decreasing, and

of counterclockwise angles). Show that if F' is any point of C' such
that F'(P') is finite, then

that the right side is independent of choice of P'.

CHAPTER 4
Applications of Winding Numbers
4a. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra
The set C of complex numbers is identified as usual with the real
plane R2, the number z = x + iy being identified with the point (x, y).
We will use the fact that for any complex polynomial
.
.
.
with coefficients a complex numbers, the mapping z '—> g(z) is a con-
tinuous mapping from C to C. This follows from the fact that addition
and multiplication of complex numbers are continuous. The goal of
this section is to show that, if n > 0 and a0
0, then the polynomial
has a root, i.e., g(z) = 0 for some z. We may divide by a0, so we can
assume g(T) has leading coefficient a0 = 1. If g(T) has no root, g is
a mapping of C into the complement of the origin.
Restrict g to a circle
of radius r centered at the origin. This gives
a mapping from Cr to C \ {0}, which we denote by gr. Since
extends
to a continuous mapping of the disk Dr of radius r into C \ {0}, it
follows from Proposition 3.20 that the winding number W(gr, 0) must
be zero. The idea is to compare g,. with the mappingf. given similarly
by the polynomial
=
The restriction of this to the circle is
fr@) =
and a simple calculation shows that W(fr, 0) = n (see Ex-
ercise 3.19). We will apply the Dog-on-a-Leash Theorem 3.11 to show
that, for r sufficiently large, f,. and
must have the same winding
number, which will be the desired contradiction. For this, it suffices

which is less than P' if r is large, e.g., if a4 <r'/n for all i. This
completes the proof of

polynomial of degree greater than zero has a root.

polynomial of degree n — 1. By induction, we see that g(T) factors

solution z with zJ <R. (b) Suppose g: C—> C is a continuous function

Show that
g is surjective.
There is another topological proof of the Fundamental Theorem of
Algebra that is in some ways even simpler, but requires a little more
about the local structure of a mapping given by a polynomial. One
shows that g extends to a continuous mapping of the Riemann sphere
to itself, taking the point at infinity to itself (which is essentially what
the above calculation showed), and which is an open mapping (see
Problem 3.31, and § 19a for details). The image is compact, so closed,
and since both open and closed, it is the whole sphere.
4b. Fixed Points and Retractions
One of the most important applications of topological ideas in other
areas of mathematics, and in science in general, is to give criteria to
guarantee that a continuous mapping from a space to itself must have
a point that is mapped to itself.
We start with the case of a closed interval [a, bi. We claim that
any continuous function fi [a,
—÷ [a, b] must have a fixed point. This
can be "seen" by looking at the graph of the mapping:

50
4. Applications of Winding Numbers
b
/
a
b
To prove it rigorously, consider the function g(x) =f(x) — x. This is
a continuous function on the interval Ia, b], with g(a)  0 and g(b)  0.
Since the image g(Ia,h}) of the interval by g must be connected, it
must contain the interval [g(b), g(a)j, so it must contain 0. This means
that g(x) = 0 for some x, which says that fix) = x.
This is closely related to another property of an interval: that there
is no continuous mapping from an interval [a,
onto its endpoints
[a, fri that maps a to a and h to h. This fact is obvious since the image
of a connected set must be connected. In general if Y is a subspace
of a topological space X, a retraction from X to Y is a continuous
mapping r: X—> Y such that r(P) = P for all P in Y. In this case Y is
called a retract of X. So there is no continuous retraction of an in-
terval onto its boundary. This proves again that any continuous func-
tion f from the interval
L — 1, lJ to itself must have fixed points, for
otherwise the mapping x—* (x
would be a continuous
retraction off—I, lJ onto {—l, l}.
Next we turn to the case of a closed disk D. We first show there
is no retraction onto its boundary circle C = 3D, and then use this as
above to show that any map from the disk to itself must have a fixed
point.
Proposition 4.3. There is no retraction from a closed disk onto its
boundary circle.
Proof. If C is the boundary of the disk D, the identity mapping from
C to itself has degree I. A retraction would give an extension of the
identity mapping to a mapping from D to C, which would imply by
Proposition 3.20 that the degree is 0.
Proposition 4.4 (Brouwer). Any continuous mapping from a closed
disk to itself must have a fixed point.
Proof. We may assume the disk D is the unit disk centered at the
origin, with boundary C the unit circle (see Exercise 4.7 below). Sup-

4b. Fixed Points and Retractions
51
pose f: D —> D is a continuous mapping with no fixed point. The idea
is to define a mapping h:
that takes a point P to the point in
C hit by the ray from ftP) to P:
h will be the identity on C, so will be a retraction
of D onto C. To finish the proof, we must verify that h is continuous.
To do this, we find an explicit formula for h. We know that
P—ftP)
h(P) =
with U=
1V—f(P)M
and
is the positive number determined by the property that
= 1.
A little calculation shows that
=
is such a positive number. With this t, the above formula for h is then
continuous, and is easily checked to be the identity on C.
U
The following exercise gives a proof with less calculation:
Exercise 4.5. 1ff: D2—>D2 has no fixed point, define g:
\ {0}
by setting g(P)PftP). Show that g(P)'P>O for all P in S', so
the restriction of g to 5' is homotopic to the identity mapping of 5'
(by the homotopy H(P X s) = (I — s)P + sg(P)). Apply Proposition
3.20.
Exercise 4.6. Deduce Proposition 4.3 from Proposition 4.4.
One says that a topological space X has the fixed point property if
every continuous mapping
X—> X has some fixed point, i.e., there
is a point P in X with ftP) = P. So any closed interval and any closed
disk have the fixed point property.
Exercise 4.7. Show that a space that is homeomorphic to a space

52

with the fixed point property has the fixed point property. Show that
if Y
is a retract of a space X that has the fixed point property, then
Y has the fixed point property.
Exercise 4.8. Which of the following spaces have the fixed point
property? (i) a closed rectangle; (ii) the plane; (iii) an open interval;
(iv) an open disk; (v) a circle; (vi) a sphere S2; (vii) a torus S' x S';
and (viii) a solid torus S x D2.
Exercise 4.9. Let D be a disk with boundary circle C, and letf
be a continuous mapping. Suppose P is a point in Ek2 that is not in
the image C, and the winding number of the restriction fc off to C
around P is not zero. Show that there is some point Q in D such that
f(Q)=P.
Exercise 4.10. Suppose D and D' are disks with boundary circles C
and C'. Supposef: D—*

thatf(D) must contain D'.

there is some P in

there is some Q in 5' and some

(i) there is either some point Q E D2 such that f(Q) = Q; or (ii) there

g(x,y) = f((x,y,Vl —x2—y2fl.
This is continuous, sincc the projection from the upper hemisphere
of the sphere to the disk (being one-to-one and continuous) is a ho-
meomorphism, and g
is the composite of f with the inverse. Now
g(P*) =f(P*)
f(P)* = g(P)* for P in 5', so by Lemma 4.20 the de-
gree of the restriction of g to 5' must be odd. But since this map
extends over the disk, its degree must be zero, a contradiction.

A fact which was unquestionably obvious until people started look-
ing for a proof is the fact that open sets of different dimensions cannot
be homeomorphic. (The fact that they cannot be diffeomorphic can
be reduced, using Jacobian matrices, to the fact that vector spaces of
different dimensions cannot be isomorphic.) The fact that there are
continuous maps from intervals onto squares makes the assertion less
obvious than might have been thought. The first case is easy: an open
interval cannot be homeomorphic to an open set in the plane or any
W, for the reason that removing a point disconnects an interval, but
does not disconnect an open set in
n2. The next case is less
obvious:

Corollary 4.23 (Invariance of Dimension). An open set in ER2 cannot
be homeomorphic to an open set in W fbr n  3.
Proof. In fact, no subset of the plane can be homeomorphic to a set
which contains a solid ball in W, n  3, for a homeomorphism from
a ball D" (of some small radius) in the plane would embed a two-
sphere 52 c D3 C D" in the plane, contradicting the proposition.

As you must expect, these results are also true in higher dimen-
sions, but more machinery is needed to extend the proofs. We'll come

4. Applications of Winding Numbers
4d. Sandwiches
A pleasant application of the Borsuk—Ulam theorem is the so-called
ham sandwich problem: to cut both slices of bread and the ham be-
tween in two equal parts with one slice of a knife.
Suppose we have three bounded objects A, B, C in space. The prob-
lem is to show that there is one plane that cuts each of them in half
(by volume). Here is what we need to know about the volume of each
object X=A, B, or C:
(i) For any fixed line 1, there is a unique point in / such that the
plane perpendicular to / through the point cuts X in half. Call this
point P1g.
(ii) The point in (i) varies continuously as the line varies continu-
ously. More precisely, take a big sphere S with X inside, and
consider for each Q E S the line 1(Q) going from Q to its antipodal
point. Then the map from Q to
is continuous.
These properties are intuitively evident, and follow from elemen-
tary properties of volume. For example, the first follows from the
fact that the volume on one side increases continuously as the point
moves along the line. We will take them as axioms, or consider only
objects for which we know them. (For a detailed discussion, see Chinn
and Steenrod (1966).)
Given a body X inside a sphere S as above, define a continuous
real-valued function Ix: S—*
by defining fx(Q) to be the distance
from Q to the point PIIQLX. Note thatfx(Q*)=d_fx(Q), where d is
the diameter of the sphere, and Q* is the antipodal point to Q.

Now for three bodies, take S containing all three, and consider the
mapping g: S—÷ R2 given by
g(Q) =
Then g(Q*) = —g(Q) for all Q, so by Proposition 4.22 some Q must
be mapped to the origin, which means that
=

as
required. This proves
Proposition 4.32 (Stone—Tukey). Given three bounded measurable
objects A, B, and C in space, there is a plane that divides each in
half by volume.
The same idea is used in the following proposition, which looks
quite different.
Proposition 4.33 (Lusternik—Schnirelman—Borsuk). It is impossible
to cover a sphere with three closed sets, none of which contains a
pair of antipodal points.
Proof. Suppose the sphere S is covered by three such closed sets K1,
K2, and K3. For each i, define a real-valued continuous function f, on
5, whose value at P is the minimum distance from P to K, (see the
following exercise). Consider the mapping g: 5—>
given by
g(P) = (f1(P)—f3(P),f2(P)—f3(P)).
By Proposition 4.22, there is a point P with g(P*) = g(P). For such
P, f1(P) —f/P) =f(P*)
for all i and j. But P must be in one
of the sets
and
P
and
0> —f(P) = f(P)—f/P) = f(p*)_f(p*) = f(P*) > 0,
a contradiction.
Exercise 4.34. Show that for any compact set K in space, the function
p on W that maps a point P to its distance from K is continuous. Note
by compactness that if p(P) = r, then there is a point Q in K of dis-
tance r from P.
Exercise 4.35. Show that the unit ball D3 is not the union of three
closed sets, each with diameter less than 2.
Exercise 4.36. Show that the "three" in Proposition 4.33 cannot be
replaced by "four."

Exercise 4.37. State and prove the analogue of Proposition 4.33 for
a circle.
Exercise 4.38. Show how Proposition 4.33 implies Lemma 4.21, and
hence Proposition 4.22.
Exercise 4.39. For a subset X of a sphere, let X* = {J3*: P E X}. Sup-
pose A, B, and C are disjoint closed subsets in a sphere, none con-
taining a pair of antipodal points. Show that the six sets A, B, C, A*,
B*, and C* cannot cover the sphere.
Problem 4.40. True/False. If a sphere is a union of two closed sets
A and B, then either A or B must contain a closed connected set X
such that X* = X.
It is an excellent project to try to generalize the results of this chap-
ter, including the exercises, to higher dimensions, assuming, for ex-
ample, that there is no continuous retraction from if onto Se', and
that there is no continuous mappingf from the sphere

PART III
COHOMOLOGY AND HOMOLOGY, I
We have seen that the topology of an open set U in the plane is related
to the question of whether all closed 1-forms on U are exact. This is
formalized by introducing the vector space H1 U of closed forms mod-
ulo exact forms. What we learned in the first few chapters amounts
to some calculations of these first De Rham cohomology groups. There
is also a 0th De Rham group H°U, which measures how many con-
nected components U has.
A central theme will be how the topology of a union U U V of two
open sets compares with the topology of U and V and the intersection
U fl V. We construct a linear map from !-1°(U fl V) to H1(U U V), and
describe the kernel and cokernel of this map. We use these groups
and this map to prove the famous Jordan curve theorem, which says
that any subset of the plane homeomorphic to a circle separates the
plane into exactly two connected pieces, an "inside" and an "out-
side."

60
Part 111. Cohomology and Homology, I
This is one of those facts that seem intuitively evident, although a
complicated enough maze may raise a few doubts. In fact, it went
unquestioned until mathematicians realized that continuous mappings
can be pretty horrible—for example, that there can be a continuous
mapping from an interval onto a square. When X is a closed polygon,
it is not too hard to give an elementary proof, and you might enjoy
seeing if you can.
A basic question, which motivates Chapter 6 and the continuation
in Chapter 9, stems from three different ways one can compare two
closed paths
and a in an open set U in the plane, supposing for
simplicity that they are differentiable:
(1) Are the winding numbers of 'y and a around all points not in U
the same?
(2) Are all integrals of closed I -forms w on U along y and a the
same?
(3) Are the paths homotopic, or related by deformations of some kind?
In studying questions like this, we will find it useful to generalize
and formalize some of the ideas of previous chapters. In Chapter 6,
paths and segmented paths are generalized to the notion of 1-chains,
which are arbitrary sums and differences of (nonconstant) paths. We
define what it means for two such chains to be homologous: the dif-
ference should be a linear combination of boundaries of maps of a
rectangle into the region. For an open set in the plane, we show that
this notion is equivalent to saying that the two chains have the same
winding number around all points outside the open set. The main
technique is to approximate general paths by rectangular paths along

Part [II. Cohomology and Homology, 1

sides of a grid.3 We introduce the first homology group H1U, which
is the group of closed 1-chains up to homology, and a 0th group J-10U,
which is a free abelian group on the connected components of U. In
Part V we will develop general tools for computing these homology
and cohomology groups.
The use of grids in these chapters follows ideas of L.E.J Brouwer, E. At-tin, and
L. Ahifors, see Ahlfors (1979).


CHAPTER 5
De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan
Curve Theorem
5a. Definitions of the De Rham Groups
Define, for an open set U in the plane: the zeroth De Rham group,
H°U
(locally constant functions on U}.
This is a vector space, by the ordinary addition of functions, and
multiplication of functions by real scalars. As we have seen, to give
a locally constant function on U is the same as giving a constant on
each connected component of U. If U has n connected components,
then H°U is an n-dimensional vector space; if
.
.
.
, U,, are the
connected components of U, and e1 is the function that is I on
and
o on U1 for all jø i, then
.
.
.
, e,, is a basis for H°U. Similarly,
if U has infinitely many components, H°U is an infinite-dimensional
vector space.
The closed I-forms on U also form a vector space, since the sum
of closed forms, and a constant times a closed 1-form, are also closed.
The exact 1-forms on U are a subspace of this vector space, since
d(f1 +12) =
+ df2 and d(çf) = cdf. Whenever we have a subspace
W of a vector space V, we can form the quotient space V/W of equiv-
alence classes: two vectors in V are equivalent if their difference is
in W (see Appendix C). Define thefirst De Rham cohomology group
of U, denoted H'U, by
H'U = (closed 1-forms on U}/(exact I-forms on U}.
63

64
5. De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
If to
is a 1-form on U, we may write [to] for the equivalence class in
H'U containing the 1-form to.
Later we will have general methods for calculating H'U. In this
section we use the ideas of Part I to compute a few simple examples.
For any point P = (x0,y0), let top denote the 1-form

—(y—y0)dx+(x--x0)dy
topO)/){)
2

2ir
(x—x0) +(yyo)
We have seen that top is a closed 1-form on any open set not con-
taining P.
Proposition 5.1. (a) If U is an open rectangle, then H'U=O. (b) U
U
R2 \{P}, then [cop] is a basis forH'U. (c) If U= R2 \{P,Q}, with
then [top] and [coQ] form a basis for H'U.
Proof. Assertion (a) is a translation of Proposition 1.12. To prove
(b), fix a positive number r, and let
denote the counterclockwise
circle of radius r about P:
= P + r(cos(2-rrt), sin(2-rrt)),
0 S t S I.
Note first that [top] is not 0 in H'U, for if top were exact, its integral
around YPr would be zero by Proposition 1.4, and we know that this
integral is 1. Let to be any closed 1-form on U, and let c =
To
show that [top] spans H'U, it suffices to show that to — c top is exact,
for then [to]
c' Jto,4 in II'U. Now to—c'top is a closed 1-form on
U whose integral along
is 0, and Lemma 1. 17 implies that such a
form is exact.
For (c), fix a positive number r less than the distance between P
and Q. To see that [top] and [toQ] are linearly independent, we must
show that a top + b' toQ is not exact unless a and b are both zero.
The integral of this form along
is a, and the integral along "a,
is b, and by Proposition 1 .4, these integrals must vanish if the form
is exact. To show that [top] and [toQ] span flU, let to be any closed
1-form on U. Let a =
and let h =
To complete the proof
of (c), we must show that to — a' top — b' toQ is exact on U, for then
[to] = a' [top] + h' ItoQ] in H'U. Now to — a' top — h
toQ is a closed 1-
form on U whose integrals along 'YPr and "/Qr both vanish, and an
appeal to Lemma 1. 18 completes the proof.
Problem 5.2. Generalize the proposition from one and two to n points.
There is one other result we will need later in this chapter:

Sb. The Coboundary Map
65
Proposition 5.3. If A is a connected closed subset of W, and P and
Q are points in A, then [w,,J = IWQ]
in !I'(W \ A).
Proof. In order to show that to = to,, — (SQ is exact on
\ A it suffices
by Proposition 1.8 to show that
to = 0 whenever
is a segmented
closed path in W\A. But
Lto = L (OP_L

Now Proposition 3. 16 implies that the winding numbers
W(y,
P and Q belong to the same connected com-
ponent of
\ Supp('y).

as in the proposition, and P
in A, show that

if and only if A
is unbounded.
5b. The Coboundary Map
Our basic tool for studying H°U and H'U, and hence the topology of
U, will be a method to study the relations among these groups for
open sets U, V and their union U U V and intersection U fl V.
V
That there might be some relation can be seen already in Lemma
1.14. This showed, for example, that if Ufl V is connected, i.e.,
H°(UflV) has dimension at most one, and ifH'U=O, and H'V=O,
then H1(U U V) must vanish as well. We want to generalize this to
more complicated open sets.
For any two open sets U and V in the plane, we will define a linear
map
& H°(UflV) —* H1(UUV).
To do this, we will need the following basic fact:
Lemma 5.5. Given open sets U and V in W, any
function on

66
5. De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
U fl V can be written as the difference of two cr functions, one that
extends to a
function on U, the other to a
function on V.
Proof This is a consequence of the existence of a partition of unity,
for the simple (but not so trivial) case of the covering of U U V by
the open sets U and V. This says that there are
functions p and
on UUV such that
1 on UUV, such that the closure (in
U U V) of the support of p is contained in U, and the closure (in
U U V) of the support of iji is contained in V. (The support of a func-
tion is the set where it is not zero.) For the proof, see Appendix B2.
To use it to prove the lemma, given a cr function f on u n V.
definef1 on U by the rule
— Jkurf
on UflV,
on U\Ufl V.
The assumption on the support of 4i insures that any point in the set
U \ U fl V has a neighborhood disjoint from the support of tU, from
which
it follows that
is
on all of U. Similarly, define a cr
function f2 on V by
—
on UflV,
f2
—
0
on V\UflV.
Thenf1 —f2(4i+p)f=fon Ufl V, as required.
L
Construction of S:
Given a locally con-
stant function f on U fl V. use the lemma to find cr functions
and
12 on U and V respectively so thatf=f1—f2 on UflV. Sincef is
locally constant,
df1—df2d(f1—f2)df=0 onUflV.
This means df1 and df2 agree on Ufl V, so there is a unique 1-form
w on U U V that agrees with df on U and with df2 on V. This I -form
to is closed, since it is even exact on each of U and V.
We define S(f)
to be the equivalence class in H'(UUV)
deter-
mined
by this closed form to, i.e., S(f) =
For this to be well
defined, we must see how to depends on the way we write f as the
difference f' —f2. We claim that a different choice would lead to a
closed 1-form that differs from to by an exact I-form. To see this,
supposef' andf2' were another choice of functions on U and V with
IV
f2' f on U fl V. (These primes have nothing to do with deriv-
atives!) Let to' be the 1-form on Ufl V that
is
on U and is c/f2'

on Un V, so there is a
function g on UU V that 1sf1' —f' on U
and is f2' -Sf2 on V. Then dg = to' — to, as required.
Lemma 5.6. The mapping 8 is a linear mapping of vector spaces,
i.e., 8(f+ g) = 8(f) + 8(g) and 8(c .f) = c 8(f), forf, g locally con-
stant functions, and c a constant.
Proof. This is just a matter of making the choices "lincarly," and is
better (and probably easier) to check for yourself than to read. Write
f=f —f2 and g = g1 — g2 as in the construction of 8(f) and 8(g).
Thenf+ g =
+ g1)—(f2 + g2). If
is the 1-form that is df1 on U
and df2 on V, and cog is the 1-form that is dg1 on U and dg2 on V,
then tof+
is the 1-form that is d(f1 +g1) on U and d(f2+g2) on
V. Therefore 8(f+ g) is represented by the 1-form co1+
which by
definition represents the sum 8(f) + 8(g). This proves that 8 preserves
sums. The proof that it preserves multiplication by a scalar is similar,
and left as an exercise.
This map 8 is called the cohoundary map. In order to use it to
compare U fl V with U U V, we need a description of its kernel and
its image. The following two propositions do this.
Proposition 5.7. A locally constant function f on U fl V is in the ker-
nel of 8 if and only if there are locally constant functionsf1 on U and
f: on V so that
f2 on U fl V. In particular, if U and V are
connected, then the kernel of 8 consists of the constant functions on
Ufl V.
Proof. Iff=f1
withf1 andf2 locally constant on U and V. these
can be chosen for the construction of 8(f), and the corresponding
form to is zero. Conversely, if 8(f) is zero, the form to of the con-
struction from an equation
must be exact. Write to = dg.
Then df1 = dg on U, and df2 = dg on V. This means thatf1 — g is lo-
cally constant on U, andf2 — g is locally constant on V. And
ff1f2 = (f1-g)-(f2-g)
is the difference of two such functions.
If U and V are connected, locally constant functions on them must
be constant, and sincef is the difference of two such functions,f is
also constant.

68
5. De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
Exercise 5.8. Show that if U and V are connected, and H'(U U V) =0,
then U fl V is also connected.
Proposition 5.9. The class [cv] of a closed 1 -form cv on U U V is in
the image of 8 if and only if the restrictions of cv to U and to V are
exact. in particular, if H'U = 0 and H'V
0, then 8 is surjective.
Proof. By construction, if cv is in the image of 3, there are functions
f' on U andf2 on V with cv = df1 on U and cv = df2 on V. Conversely,
if there are such functions, the function
on U fl V is locally
constant, since dfdf1—df2cv—cv0 on UflV, and [cv]=3(f)
by construction.
Sc. The Jordan Curve Theorem
If X is a closed subset of the plane, there is a close relation between
the topology of X and the topology of its complement. We prove some
important cases of this fact here.
Theorem 5.10 (Jordan Curve Theorem). if X C
is homeomorphic
to a circle, then its complement
X has two connected components,
one bounded, the other unbounded. Any neighborhood of any point
on X meets both of these components.
Proof. Let P and Q be any two points in X. By considering a homeo-
morphism of X with the circle, we can write X as a union of two
subsets A and B, each homeomorphic to a closed interval, with
AflB={P,Q}.
5'
X
We will apply the results of the preceding section to the open sets
and VW\B. Note that
UUV =
and
UflV = W\X.
To show that R2 \ X has two components, we want to show that the
dimension of H°(U fl V) =
\ X) is 2.

Sc. The Jordan Curve Theorem
69

We know from Proposition 5. 1(c) that H (U U V) = H (It \ {P, Q})
is a vector space of dimension 2, with a basis the classes of Wp and
(DQ. Each of U and V is the complement of a subset homeomorphic
to an interval. We will need an analogue of the Jordan curve theorem,
but where the circle is replaced by an interval:
Theorem 5.11. If Y C
is homeomorphic to a closed interval, then
\ Y is connected.
We postpone a discussion of this theorem to the end of this section,
and show now how to use it to prove the Jordan curve theorem. Con-
sider the boundary map
&
—>
Our goal is to show that the image and kernel of S are both one di-
mensional, which will imply by the rank-nullity theorem (see Ap-
pendix C) that
\ X) is two dimensional, which means that
\ X
has two connected components.
Since, by Theorem 5. 11, U and V are connected, we can apply
Proposition 5.7, so the kernel of S consists of the constant functions
on
\ X, which is therefore one dimensional. We claim that the im-
age of S consists of those linear combinations
+
of the
basis elements that have a + b = 0. This means that [wp] — [WQJ forms
a basis for the image of 5, and completes the proof of the claim that
the image is one dimensional.
By Proposition 5.9, the image of S consists of those linear com-
binations
[topl +
[WQJ such that the restrictions of a (Op +
(OQ
to U and to V are exact. Since P and Q are in the same connected
component of
\ U and of
\ V, it follows from Proposition 5.3
that Wp —
is exact on U and on V. If a + b = 0, it follows that
a Wp +
=
(wp — (flQ) is exact on U and on V, so
+ b IWQI
is in the image of S if a + b = 0. Conversely, suppose the restriction
of w = a
üip +
(OQ to U (and to V) is exact. Let
=
be a circle
about the origin, with r so large that X is contained inside this circle.
Since w is exact on U, Proposition 1 .4 guarantees that
w = 0. Since
P and Q are inside the circle,
1 and LWQ= I, so

This completes the proof that
\ X has two connected compo-
nents. Note that since X is bounded, one of these components must
contain everything outside some large disk; this is the unbounded

5. De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
component, while the other must be bounded. To verify the last as-
sertion of the theorem, suppose N is a neighborhood of some point
in X. We may divide X into two pieces, as in the preceding discus-
sion, so that one of them, say A, lies entirely in N. Take two points,
say P0 and P1, one in each of the two components of W X.
x
By Theorem 5.11, W \ B is connected, so there is a path y(t), 0 
I,
from P0 to P1 in
\ B. This path must hit A, for if it didn't, it would
connect the two points in R2 \ X. By looking at the first and last time
the path hits A, i.e., the minimal and maximal t such that
is in
A (which is a closed set in [0, 1
it follows that N must contain points
of both components: for t near to but less than the minimum,
will
be in N and the component of Po, and for t near to but greater than
the maximum, 'y(t) will be in N and the other component.
El
Remark 5.12. (I) It follows in particular that X is nowhere dense:
no point has a neighborhood contained in X. Note that an arbitrary
continuous image of a circle or interval need not have this property.
(2) The fact that points on X are "accessible" from both sides is
strengthened in Problem 10.24.
Proof of Theorem 5.11. The proof of Theorem 5.11 uses the same
ideas, but with one new wrinkle. Choose a homeomorphism from the
interval [0, 1 } to Y. Let A be the subset of Y corresponding to the left
half of the interval 10,
and B the subset corresponding to the right
half ('/2, lJ, and Q A flB the point corresponding to
/2.

5c. The Jordan Curve Theorem
71
We apply the basic construction to U
=
\ A and V =
\ B,
with
UflVIP2\Yand UUV=W\{Q}. It might seem that little will be
gained by this, since each of U,
V
is of the same form:
the complement of a subset homeomorphic to an interval. But we will
see that some progress has been made.
Suppose F? \ Y is not connected, and let P0 and P1 bc points in two
different connected components. The claim we will prove is: P0 and
P1 must he in different connected components of F2 \ A or in different
connected components of F? \ B (or both). We use the map
Now H'(F2 \ {Q}) is generated by the class [w0] of WQ. By Propo-
sition 5.9 the image of S consists of classes
{w0J such that a
is exact on U and V. if a CüQ is exact on U, the integral of a
around a large circle is zero, which implies that a = 0. So the image
of S is zero. In other words, every locally constant function on F?
is in the kernel of S.
By Proposition 5.7, a function f in the kernel of S must have the
form f' —f, where
and f2 are locally constant functions on U and
on V, respectively. Takef to be any locally constant function on Ufl V
that takes on different values at the two points P0 and P1, which is
possible since they are in different components. If the claim were
false, and P0 and P1 were in the same component of U and of V, then
each of f' andf2 would have to take on the same values at P0 and
But then their differeneef would also take on the same values, which
is a contradiction.
The progress made by proving this claim comes from the fact that
the two sets A and B are smaller than Y. To take advantage of this,
we can argue as follows: Let
Y such that
P0 and P1
are in different components of F?
Y1. Repeat the argu-
ment, cutting Y1 into two
pieces (corresponding to cutting the half
interval (0, V2] or [1/2, 1] into equal pieces). For one of the two pieces,
say 1'2, by the same argument, the two points P0 and P1 are still in
different components of F?
Y2. Continuing in this way, we get a
nested sequence of subsets
with the property that P0 and P1 are in different components of F?
for all n, with the intersection of all these subsets
being a single
point P in 1'.
Since the complement of a point is connected, there is a path from
P0 to P1
in F? that doesn't pass through P. Some neighborhood N of

72
5. Dc Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
P is disjoint from this path, and, for large n,
is contained in N.
But this forces P0 and P1 to be in thc same component of
\
a
contradiction. This finishes the proof of Theorem 5. 11, and hence of
the full Jordan curve theorem.
3d. Applications and Variations
The same ideas can be used to calculate the number of connected
components of the complements of many other subsets in the plane.
For many of these variations, we need the following generalization of
Proposition 5.1, which will be proved in Chapter 9 (see §9c and
Lemma 9.1).
(*) Let K be a compact, nonempty subset of the plane. (a) If K is
connected, then H'(ER2 \ K) is one-dimensional, generated by [wpj
for any PEK. (b) if K is not connected, and P and Q are in differ-
ent components of K, then [wpl and [WQ] are linearly independent
in H'(EP2 \ K); if K has exactly two connected components, then
(w,4 and IWQI form a basis for
\ K).
Exercise 5.13. Show that, if A and B are compact connected subsets
in the plane such that AflB is not connected (and not empty), then
ftt\(AUB) is not connected.
Exercise 5.14. Show that if Y is a subset of the plane homeomorphic
to a closed rectangle or a closed disk, then the complement is con-
nected.
Exercise 5.15. Show that if X is a subset of the plane homeomorphic
to a closed annulus, then the complement has two connccted com-
ponents.
Exercise 5.16. Show that if X is a subset of the plane homeomorphic
to a figure 8, or a "theta" 0, then the complement has three connected
components.
Here is a simple application of the Jordan curve theorem. Let D be
a closed disk, D° its interior, and C its boundary circle.

Proposition 5.17. Let f:D—> DR?2 be a continuous, one-to-one map-
ping. Then fIR?2 \flC) has two connected components, which are
f(D°)
and
Dt\f(D).
in particular, f(D°) is an open subset of the plane.
Proof. Recall that a continuous, one-to-one mapping on a compact
set such as 13 or C must be a homeomorphism onto its image. So thc
Jordan curve theorem applies to the image of C, and its complement
has two connected components. The first displayed set is connected
since it is the continuous image of a connected space, and the second
is connected by Exercise 5. 14. They are disjoint, and their union is
p2 \f(C). It follows immediately that they must be the two compo-
nents of W \f(C). In particular, since the components of an open
subset of the plane are open, it follows that f(D°) is open.
The following is another intuitively "obvious" result that is not so
easy to prove by hand (try it!):
Corollary 5.18 (Invariance of Domain), if U is an open set in the
plane, and F: U—>
is a continuous, one-to-one mapping, then F(U)
is an open subset of
and F is a homeomorphism of U onto F(U).
Proof. Take any P in U, and a closed disk 13 containing P and con-
tained in U. By the proposition, the image of the interior of the disk
must be open. This gives an open neighborhood of the image point
in F(U), which implies that F(U) is open, and that F is a homeo-
morphism of U with F(U).
In particular, if two subsets of the plane are homeomorphic, and
one is an open subset, the other must also be open. So if one is a
domain (a connected open subset), the other must be as well.
Another application is another proof of a result from Chapter 4.
Corollary 5.19. There is no subset of the plane that is homeomorphic
to a iwo-sphere.
Proof. Suppose f: S—> W maps the sphere homeomorphically onto a
subset X of W. Let A and B be the upper and lower closed hemi-
spheres, with intersection C, and let A° = A \ C and B° = B \ C. Note
that A is homeomorphic to a disk, with C corresponding to the bound-
ary. The complement of the imagef(C) of the circle in the plane has
two connected components, and by the proposition (applied to the
map from A to the plane), f(A°) must be one of them. Since f(A°) is

74
5. De Rham Cohomology and the Jordan Curve Theorem
contained in f(A), it must be the bounded component. The same rea-
soning applies to the map from B, so f(B°) must also be the bounded
component of the complement of f(C). But then f(A°)
f(B°), which
contradicts the fact thatf is one-to-one.

This section concludes with a few related results, mostly in the
form of exercises and problems, which can be sampled according to
your interest or perseverance. The next proposition verifies that a Jor-
dan curve winds once around each point inside. (This result will not
be used elsewhere.)
Proposition 5.20. Let C be a circle, F: C—÷
a one-to-one, con-
tinuous mapping. Then W(F, P) = ± I for P in the bounded component
of W\F(C).
Proof. In the course of the proof, we will make several assertions
about winding numbers, leaving their proofs as exercises in using the
properties proved in Chapter 3. The mapping F is a homeomorphism
onto its image X = F(C). By the Jordan curve theorem, the comple-
ment has two components, and we know the winding number is 0 for
points in the unbounded component, and it is constant in the bounded
component. So it suffices to find one point P with W(F, P) = ± 1.
Take a horizontal line L that has points of X on both sides of it. Take
a point 0 on L so that X lies in the half plane to the right of 0. Let
S and T be the nearest and farthest points from 0 in Xfl L, and let M
and N be points on X below and above L such that no other points
of X lie on the line segments from 0 to M and from 0 to N.
The points M and N correspond by F to two points m and n of the
circle C. Let A be the image by F of the counterclockwise arc from
m to n, and let B be the image of the other clockwise arc from m to
n. Let
be a closed path starting at 0, going along the segment to
M, then traveling along A to N, and back to 0 along the segment;

define Is similarly using B in place of A. We choose these paths along
A and B by using the mapping F, so that
= W(F,P)
for all P not in X or the line segments from 0 to M or N.
The answer will depend on whether the point T
is in A or in B.
Suppose first that T is in A. Then W(y5, 7) = 0, so W(y8, T') = 0 for
all T' mA flL. ForapointQ on the line between 0 andS, W(18,Q)= I.
It follows that S is not in A, so it must be in B. Since W('YA, Q) = I,
we must have WeYA,S)
1, and therefore W('YA,S')
1 for all 5' in
B fl L. Let 5' be the point in B fl L that is farthest from 0, and let T'
be the point in A fl L that is closest to 0, and let P be any point on
L between 5' and T'. Then
W(F,P) = W('y4,P)—W(i5,P) = W(IA,S')—WCYB,T') = I.
If T is in B, a similar argument shows that W(F, P) = — I.
The proof gives a criterion to tell whether the winding number is
+
1 or — I:
it is + I when four points M, N, 5, and T chosen as in
the proof have the same relative position as the four corresponding
points of the circle. (This proof, from Ahlfors (1979), also shows
directly, without the Jordan curve theorem, that the complement of
X has at least two components.)
It is a fact that if X is a subset of W homeomorphic to a circle,
then the bounded component of the complement is homeomorphic to
an open disk, and the unbounded component is homeomorphic to a
disk minus a point. In fact, the Riemann mapping theorem of complex
analysis implies that any connected plane domain with 111U = 0 is
analytically isomorphic to (in particular, diffeomorphic to) an open
disk. Even more is true: any homeomorphism of 5' with X can be
extended to a homeomorphism from P! onto P2, mapping the inside
and outside of the circle to the two components of P2 X. This last
is called the Schoenflics theorem. For elementary (but not so simple)
proofs, see Newman (1939). This is a case where the analogue in
higher dimensions is more complicated: a homeomorphism of
in
P2, or of S"' in W for n  3, will separate the space into two con-
nected components, as we will see in Chapter 23, but the inside need
not be homeomorphic to an open disk; for a picture of a counterex-
ample, "Alexander's homed sphere," see Hocking and Young (1988).
However, if the embedding extends to an embedding of a product of
5fl1 with an interval into W, then this wild behavior cannot occur
(see Bredon (1993), § 19).

Let X be a subset of the plane that is a union of v  I points and e  0

[0, 11 to
each of which maps 0 and 1 into the set of vertices, and
maps the open interval (0, 1) one-to-one into the complement of the
set of vertices. In addition, these open edges are assumed to be dis-
joint. Suppose X has k connected components. Show that

You may enjoy comparing your argument in the last problem with

homeomorphie to one of these two examples can be embedded in the

inition of what it means for a path to cross X at a point!)
It is again an excellent project to speculate on the higher-dimen-
sional generalizations of the results of this chapter. For example, if
you assume the fact that if X is any subset of ER" homeomorphic to a
sphere S"1 (resp. a ball D"), then ER" \ X has two (resp. one) connected
components, can you state and prove the invariance of domain for
open sets in ER"?

interior or boundary point according to which case occurs. (a) Show
that this notion is well defined: a point cannot be both an interior

have homeomorphic boundaries (so the Moebius band is not homeo-

CHAPTER 6
Homology
6a. Chains, Cycles, and H0U
As we have seen, it frequently happens that one wants to compute
winding numbers or integrals along a succession of paths, counting
some positively and some negatively. For example, the integral around
the boundary of a rectangle is the sum of integrals over two of its
sides, minus the sum of the integrals over the other two sides. In this
section we formalize these ideas, by introducing the notion of a 1-
chain. A 1-chain y in U is an expression of the form
= ThYI+17f12+
.
.
.
where each
is a continuous path in U, and each n,
is an integer.
For simplicity, so we will not have to mention the interval each path
might be defined on, we will take all paths from now on to be defined
on the unit interval [0, 1]. The paths that are constant, that is, that
map [0, 1] to one point of U, can be ignored in the present story. For
example, their winding numbers are zero, all integrals over them are
zero. We will agree that if we meet a sum
where some of the
are constant paths, we simply throw away any constant paths that
occur. Another way to say this is that we identify two expressions
and
if their difference
—
is a linear combi-
nation of constant paths.
We will make this notion more precise in a moment, but for now
we note that, whatever it means, it is clear how we should define the
78

6a. Chains, Cycles, and J-10U
79
winding number of a 1-chain
with respect to P:
W('y,P) = n1W(y1,P)+
.
.
. +nrW('yr,P);
this will be defined provided P is not in the support of any of the
paths
In Chapter 9 we will also define the integral of a closed I -
form along a path, and it will extend additively in the same way to
integrals over I-chains. Two 1-chains should be regarded as the same
when each path occurs with the same multiplicity in both I-chains.
A 1-chain will have a unique expression as shown, provided the paths
are all taken to be distinct and nonconstant, and all the coefficients
are taken to be nonzero. (There is also the zero I -chain, written ny = 0,
which has no paths at all.)
To make this precise, define a 1-chain in U to be a function that
assigns to every nonconstant path in U some integer, with the property
that the function is zero for all but a finite number of paths. if
Yr are the paths for which the value is not zero, and the
value of this function on
is
we write
the
1-chain
as
n1y1 + .
.
. +n,ry1. From this definition it is clear how to add and
subtract I-chains: one just adds or subtracts the corresponding values
on each path, or the coefficients in such expressions. In this way the
I-chains form an abelian group,4 with the operation in the group writ-
ten additively. Any path y is identified with the I-chain I •y, the
corresponding function taking the value
I on
and 0 on all other
paths.
In practice, we will not use this "functional" terminology, but just
write I-chains as formal linear combinations of paths. Either way,
specifying a 1-chain is the same as specifying a finite number of paths,
and assigning an integer to each. It should be emphasized that in this
definition two paths are the same only if defined by exactly the same
mapping. However, the following problem indicates some common
variations that are possible.
Problem 6.1. Call two paths equivalent if they differ by a monotone
increasing reparametrization. Show that this is an equivalence rela-
tion. Show how to define an abelian group of 1-chains by using equiv-
alence classes of paths instead of paths. Do the same if paths are
called equivalent when they are homotopic with the same endpoints.
If you are familiar with the language from algebra, the chains arc elements of the
free abelian group on the set of nonconstant paths. See Appendix C for more about
free abelian groups.

Some particular paths and I -chains will be important. For any two
points P and Q, the straight path from P to Q will be the path
y(t)P+t(Q—P)(l—t)P+tQ,

from (a,c) to

We want to define the notion of a closed I -chain, also called a 1-
cycle. This should mean that each point occurs as many times as an
initial point as it does as a final point, counting multiplicities cor-
rectly. For example, any closed path, such as the preceding 3D, is a
closed I-chain, and the boundary ÔR of a rectangle is closed. The
precise definition is as follows. For I = nfl't +

•
The preceding definition of a closed I -chain can be said simply in
this language: a 1-chain is closed exactly when its boundary is zero.
Let Z0U be the group of 0-chains. A 0-chain
is called a 0-bound-
ary if there is a 1-chain
such that
= 8y. These 0-boundaries form
a subgroup of Z0U which is denoted by B0U. For example, if P and
Q are in the same component of U, then the 0-chain Q — P is in B0U,
since it is the boundary of any path from P to Q. The quotient group
ZOU/BOU is called the 0th homology group of U, and is denoted H0U:
1-10U = Z0U/80U.
We will see that although the groups Z0U and B0U are large (even
uncountable), the quotient group is small: it simply measures how
many connected components U has:
Proposition 6.3. The group H0U is canonically isomorphic to the free
ahelian group on the set of path-connected components of U.
Proof. Let F be the free abelian group on the set of path-connected
components of U. The map that takes a point to the path component
containing it determines a surjective homomorphism from Z0U to F.
We claim that the kernel of this homomorphism is exactly the group
of boundaries B0U. This will conclude the proof, since such a ho-
momorphism determines a canonical isomorphism of ZQU/BOU with
F (see Appendix C). Any boundary is in the kernel, since the end-
points of a path must be in the same component. Conversely, if a
0-cycle is in the kernel, the total of the coefficients appearing in front
of points in any given component must be zero. Such a 0-cycle can
be written (not necessarily uniquely) in the form >2(Q, — P3, where,
in each term, P, and Q, are in the same component. As we saw before
the proof, such a 0-cycle is a boundary.
LI
We will use this proposition to determine the number of connected
components of U, by finding other ways of calculating H0U. If we
show that J-10U has rank n, we will know that U has exactly n con-
nected components. This depends on the algebraic fact that a free
abelian group has a well-defined rank; this is proved in Appendix C.

82
6. Homology
(Alternatively, one could replace all the integer coefficients in all our
0-chains and 1-chains by real numbers. Then we would find that H0U
is a real vector space of dimension n, where n is the number of com-
ponents, and appeal to the fact that a vector space has a well-defined
dimension.)
There is a homomorphism from I-10U to the integers /, defined by
the map that takes each connected component of (I to I. In other
words, it takes the class of a 0-cycle
= in1P1 to the sum
of the
coefficients. This is called the degree homomorphism. it is an iso-
morphism exactly when U is connected.
6b. Boundaries, H1U, and Winding Numbers
The group of 1-chains on U is denoted C1U. The subgroup of closed
1-chains, or I-cycles, is denoted Z1U. There are some closed 1-chains
in U, called 1-boundaries, that play a particularly simple role. They
will turn out to be exactly those 1-chains for which winding numbers
around points not in U vanish, and for which all integrals of closed
1-forms in U also vanish. These come from boundaries of continuous
mappings F' from a square R = [0, 11 X [0, 1] into U. For such a map-
ping, define the 1-chain 81' by the formula
81' =
where
"y3, and
are the paths obtained by restricting F to the
four sides of the square, as in §3b. (We should note here that one or
more of these four paths 'y1 could be constant paths, in which case
we omit them from the formula for BF.) We call a 1-chain 'y a bound-
ary, or a boundary 1-chain, or 1-boundary, in U if it can be written
as a finite linear combination (with integer coefficients) of boundaries
of such maps on rectangles. Two closed 1-chains in U are homologous
if the difference between them is a boundary in U.
We will need to know that some other I-chains are boundaries. The
following lemma considers what happens when one reparametrizes,
subdivides, or deforms a path.

Exercise 6.5. Show that if U is starshaped, then every closed 1-chain

The 1-boundaries form a subgroup, denoted B1U, of the group ZIU
of 1-cycles. The quotient group Z1
U is called the first homology
group of U, and is denoted H1U. One of our aims in this book will
be to study and use this group. We will see that, as the 0th group

6. Homology
I-10U measures the simplest topological fact about U—how many con-
nected components it has—the 1st group H1U measures how many
"holes" there are in U. Two closed 1-chains are homologous exactly
when they have the same image in H1U, in which case we say that
they define the same homology class.
The support Supp(y) of a I-chain
in the plane is the union of the
supports of the paths that appear in
with nonzero coefficients. If P
is a point not in the support, we define the winding number of 'y

A grid G will be a finite union of lines in the plane, each parallel to
x-axis or the y-axis, with at least two horizontal and two vertical lines.
These lines cut the plane into a finite number of rectangular regions,
some bounded and some unbounded. By a rectangular 1-chain for a
given grid we shall mean a 1-chain

about these points.

has winding number zero around each
We must show that T is
zero as a 1-chain. Suppose an edge a occurs in T with nonzero coef-
ficient m. Suppose that a is a vertical or horizontal line between two
rectangles R and R' of the grid, with R to the left of or above R'.
Assume first that R is bounded:
The trick is to consider the closed 1-chain T' = T —
31?. Let P and

6c. Chains on Grids

P' be interior points in R and R', respectively. Since W(8R, P) =

—m,

W(BR,P') =0.
But the edge r does not appear in 7', so P and F' belong to the same
connected component of the complement of the support of 7', which
implies by Proposition 6.8 that WCr', F) = WCr', F'), a contradiction.
If R is unbounded, and R' is bounded, the argument is similar, using
Next we need an approximation lemma that will assure that, for
the purposes of winding numbers and integration, all paths and 1-chains
can be replaced by rectangular 1-chains.
Lemma 6.10. Let 'y be any 1-chain in an open set U. Then there is
a grid G, and a rectangular I -chain p. for G, with the support of 1a
contained in U, such that y — p. is a 1-boundary in U. If y is closed,
then p. is also closed.
Proof. By Lemma 6.4(b) we can subdivide any of the paths that occur
in y, and the difference between
and the I-chain with subdivided
paths will be a boundary. Using the Lebesgue lemma as usual to sub-
divide, we may therefore assume that each path
occurring in

[0, 1] into some open rectangle U1 contained in U. Let P, and Q, be
the starting and ending points of y1. Take any grid G that has a vertical
and horizontal line passing through each P1 and each Q. Let

rectangular 1-chain for G that goes from P, to
involving only edges
on the closed rectangle with corners at P1 and

LI
We are now ready to prove the main goal of this chapter: that the
geometric condition for 1-cycles to be homologous in an open set is
equivalent to the numerical condition of having the same winding
number around all points outside the open set.
Theorem 6.11. Suppose y and 8 are closed I -chains on an open set
U in the plane. Then the following are equivalent:
(1) y and 8 are homologous, i.e., y— 8 is a boundary in U; and
(2) W(y, P) = W(5, P) for all points P not in U.
Proof. We saw in Lemma 6.7 that (1) implies (2). For the converse,
by looking at T = "y — 8, it suffices to show that if T is a closed 1-chain
such that W('r, P) = 0 for all P
U, then T is a boundary. By Lemma
6. 10, there is a closed rectangular 1-chain p. for some grid G so that
is a boundary in U. By Lemma 6.9,
where
n = W(p., P3.
We claim that n1 = 0 unless the entire closed rectangle R, is con-
tained in U. For if Q is a point of R that is not in U, then W('r, Q) = 0
by assumption, so W(p., Q) = 0 by Lemma 6.7. Since the straight line
from P, to Q lies in the complement of the support of p., it follows
from Proposition 6.8 that W(p., P3 = W(p., Q), so n1 = W(p., P1) = 0.
It follows that p. =
with each R1 contained in U, and such a
1-chain is visibly a boundary in U. So T = (7 — p.) + p. is also a
boundary.
For example, if U =
\ {P} is the complement of a point, two
I-cycles are homologous in U exactly when their winding numbers

From this exercise and Theorem 6.11, we deduce the following
fact, which is not so obvious from the definition of thc winding num-
ber:
Proposition 6.15. If y and 8 are closed 1-chains in U with the same
winding number around all points not in U, then
and

closed 1-chains in U' with the same winding number around all points

6e. The First Homology Group for General Spaces
The general definitions of this chapter make sense without change for
any topological space, although, of course, one does not have wind-
ing numbers in arbitrary spaces. Any topological space X has abelian
groups 4)( of 0-chains, 80X of 0-boundaries, with 0th homology group
I-4X = Z0X/B0X, which is canonically isomorphic to the free abelian
group on the set of path-connected components of X. Similarly, one
has the abelian group C1X of I-chains on X, with the subgroups Z1X
of 1-cycles and 1-boundaries B 1X, and the
1st homology group
H1X=Z1X/B1X. There are no changes in the definitions, other than
replacing a "U" by an "X."

6. Homology
Exercise 6.19. Show that a continuous mapping F: X—> Y determines
a homomorphism from Z1X to Z1Y taking B1X to B1Y.
This determines a homomorphisms of the quotient groups, denoted
H1X —> H1Y.
Exercise 6.20. Show that if F: X—> Y and G: Y—÷Z are continuous,
then
=
as homomorphisms from H1X to H1Z. If F is
the identity map on X, show that

The result of this exercise is expressed by saying that the diagram
H1X
>
H1Y
H1Z
commutes: starting with an element in the upper left group H1X, map-
ping it to H1Z by either route gives the same answer.
For example, if Z = X, and F and G are homeomorphisms that are
inverses to each other, so that G°F is the identity map of X, then
(GOF)* is the identity map of H1X, so the composite
H1X -, HY
—> HX
is the identity map on FIX. Similarly FoG is the identity map on Y,
so
oF* is the identity map on flY. It follows that
and
are
inverse isomorphisms between HX and HY. In particular,
Proposition 6.21. If X and Y are homeomorphic, then HX and HY
are isomorphic abe/ian groups.
Similarly, if Y is contained in X, and r: X—÷ Y is a continuous re-
tract, the identity map on HY must factor into a composite of ho-
momorphismsHY—*HX—*HY. Forexample, if HX = 0,
0,
this shows that there can be no such retract.
Exercise 6.22. Compute HX for X a circle and for X a disk, and
show again that a circle is not a retract of the disk it bounds.
Two continuous maps F and G from X to Y are homotopic if there

A subspace Y of a space X is called a deformation retract if there
is a continuous retract r: X—> Y such that the identity map from X to
X is homotopic to the map ior, where i is the inclusion of V in X. A
space X is called contractible if it contains a point that is a defor-
mation retract of X.
Exercise 6.24. (a) Show that the circle S1 C
\ {0} is a deformation
retract. (b) Give an example of a retract that is not a deformation
retract. (c) Show that any two maps from any space to a contractible
space are homotopic. In particular, every point in a contractible space
is a deformation retract of the space.
Exercise 6.25. Show that if V is a deformation retract of X, then the
map from H1Y to H1X determined by the inclusion of V in X is an
isomorphism. Show that H1(X) = 0 if X is contractible.
Exercise 6.26. Show that F: X—> V determines a homomorphism from
to Z0Y taking B0X to 80Y, and so a homomorphism, also denoted
from H0X to H0Y. Verify the analogues of the assertions in Ex-
ercises 6.19 and 6.20, and Propositions 6.21 and 6.23.
If X
is a subspace of the plane that is not open, one does have a
notion of the winding number around points not in X, but the situation
is more complicated, as the following problems indicate.
Problem 6.27 (For those who know the Tietze extension theorem).
Suppose X and X' are closed subsets of the plane, and F: X—>X' is
a continuous mapping. Suppose

X
such that W('y, P) = W(S, P) for all P
not in X. Show that

Problem 6.28. Let X be a closed set in the plane. Show that if

8 are homologous 1-cycles on X, then

PART IV
VECTOR FIELDS
A mapping from an open set in the plane to the plane can be regarded
as a vector field, and winding numbers can be used to define the index
of a vector field at a singularity. The ideas of Chapter 6 can be used
to relate sums of indices to winding numbers around regions. This is
applied to show that vector fields on a sphere must have singularities:
one cannot comb the hair on a billiard ball. The same ideas are used
in the next chapter to study more interesting surfaces. These chapters
are inserted here to indicate some other interesting things one can do
with winding numbers; a reader in a hurry to move on can skip to
Part V or VI.
Chapter 8 sketches how some of the ideas we have studied in the
plane and on the sphere can be studied on more general surfaces. It
gives us a first chance to study some spaces other than plane regions
and spheres. In particular, we see how the "global" topology of the
surface puts restrictions on the "local" data of indices of a vector
field. We use this to discuss the Euler characteristic of a surface.
Some of the arguments in this section will depend on geometric con-
structions that will only be sketched, usually by drawing pictures
showing how to deform one surface into another. Later in the chapter
we discuss briefly what it would take to make these arguments rig-
orous, and later in the book we take up the study of surfaces more
systematically.


CHAPTER 7
Indices of Vector Fields
7a. Vector Fields in the Plane
We want to look at continuous vector fields on an open set U in the
plane, but allowing them to have a finite number of singularities. A
singularity will be a point at which either the vector field is not de-
fined, or a point where it is defined and is zero. A vector field on U
with singularities in Z will therefore be a continuous mapping
V: U\Z—>
where Z is a finite set in U. For vector fields arising from flow of a
fluid, the singularities may arise from "sources," where fluid is en-
tering the system, or "sinks," where it is leaving, or some other dis-
continuity.
Given such a vector field V, to each point P in U one can define
an integer called the index of V at P, denoted
To do this,
take a disk Dr of some radius r about P that does not meet Z at any
point except (perhaps) P. Let Cr be the boundary of this disk. The
restriction
of V to Cr is a mapping from this circle to
\ {O}, so
it has a winding number (by §3d). Define the index to be this winding
number:
= W(VIc,,O).
Lemma 7.1. (a) This definition is independent of choice of r.
(b) If P is not in Z, then
= 0.

Proof The proof of (a) is the same as that of Lemma 3.28, and (b)
follows from Proposition 3.20.
U
From the definition, the mdcx at P depends only on the restriction
of V to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of P. Here are some ex-
amples of vector fields with singularities at the origin, with the cor-
responding indices; the calculations are left as exercises. Instead of
drawing vectors at many points, it is more useful to draw some flow
lines, i.e., curves that are tangent to the vector field at each point.

Note that (2) and (3) are opposite as vector fields, as are (5) and (6),
but have the same index. Similarly, (4) is a positive multiple of (2).
These are special cases of Exercise 7.4, which shows that the mag-
nitude and sign of the vectors does not affect the index (which ex-
plains why the flow lines, without even their sense of direction, de-
termine the indices).
Exercise 7.2. Construct, for each integer n, a vector field with a sin-
gularity at the origin with index n.
Exercise 7.3. Let V0 and V1 be continuous vector fields in a punctured
neighborhood U of P, and suppose there is a continuous mapping
H: UX [0, 1]—> R2 such that

Exercise 7.4. Show that if p is any continuous function defined in a
punctured neighborhood of P that is always positive or always neg-
ative in this neighborhood, then the index at P of

the index at P of V.
The following proposition relates the behavior of a vector field along
the boundary of a region to the indices of the vector field at singular
points inside:
Proposition 7.5. Let V he a vector field with singularities in U. Sup-
pose y is a closed I -chain in U whose support does not meet the
singular set Z of V, such that W(y, P) = 0 for all P not in U. Then

larities on the boundary circle C of D. Then

Problem 7.8. Generalize this discussion to allow the singularity set
Z to be infinite but discrete,
i.e., Z
is a closed subset of U such that
each P in Z has a neighborhood UF in U such that UF fl Z = {P}. Show
that the sum in Proposition 7.5 is automatically finite.

Problem 7.9. Letf be a
function defined in U, defining a gradient
vector field Vgrad(f) on
U. A point P is
a critical point forf if
the gradient vanishes at P, and P is called nondegenerate if the "Hes-

(b) Suppose D is a disk in U with boundary C, andf has only non-

constant on C. Show that the number of local maxima plus the num-
ber of local minima is one more than the number of saddle points.
"On a circular island, the number of peaks plus the number of valleys
is one more than the number of passes."
7b. Changing Coordinates
Later we want to define the index of a vector field on a surface other
than an open set in the plane. To do this, the essential point is to
know that a change of coordinates does not change the index. This
result, which is intuitively obvious from pictures of vector fields, takes
some care to state and a little work to prove. To state it, suppose
p: U—> U' is a diffeomorphism from one open set in the plane onto
another; that is, p is
one-to-one, and onto, and the inverse map
p': U'—> U is also a
mapping. At any point P in U, we have the
Jacobian matrix

where
p(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) in coordinates. This gives a linear
mapping from vectors in
to vectors in R2 (see Appendix C). If V
is a continuous vector field in U, define the vector field p>V in U'

102
7. Indices of Vector Fields
by the formula
(p*V)(P') =
where P is the point in (I mapped to P' by p, i.e., P = çf'(P'). If V
has singularities in the set Z, V' will have singularities in p(Z).
Lemma 7.10. With V and
as above, then, for any P in U,
=
The proof of this lemma is given in Appendix D. We will also want
to compare the indices of two different vector fields on a surface. The
following lemma will be used to reduce to the case where they agree
in a neighborhood of some point. We say that two vector fields V
and W agree on a set A if V(P) = W(P) for all P in A. The proof is
also in Appendix D.
Lemma 7.11. Suppose V and W are continuous vector fields with no
singularities on an open neighborhood U of a point P. Let P C U he
a closed disk centered at P. Then there is a vector field V with no
singularities on U such that: (i) V and V agree on U \ D; and (ii)
V and W agree on some neighborhood of P.
7c. Vector Fields on a Sphere
A vector field V on a sphere S assigns to each point P in S a vector
V(P) in the tangent space
to S at P, the mapping from P to V(P)
being continuous. If 552 is the standard sphere, and P=(x,y,z),
the tangent space is
ax+ by + cz= 0}.
As before, we may allow a finite set Z of singularities. In fact, one
of our goals is to show that any vector field on sphere must have
singularities.

7c. Vector Fields on a Sphere
103
We want to flatten out the sphere, say by stereographic projection
from a point on the sphere, so that the vector field determines a cor-
responding vector field on the plane, and we will use what we know
about vector fields on the plane.
(0.0,1)
We need the following, whose proof is left as an exercise:

the tangent space to

and ço*V is the vector field on
defined by the equation
= V(p(P)),
then ço*V is continuous at P if V is continuous at ço(P).
Now suppose V is a continuous vector field with no singularities
on
Then p*V is a vector field on W with no singularities. Let C,.
be a large circle centered at the origin in the plane. We know from
Corollary 7.7 that the winding number of p*V around C. must be
zero. To get a contradiction, we must use the fact that V is continuous
and nonzero at the north pole. For r large, Cr can be thought of as a
small circle around the north pole. The winding number of p*V around
such a circle is not zero, even though it comes from a vector field
x

104
7. Indices of Vector Fields
that is not zero in the disk near the north pole. This can be seen by
unraveling what happens to a vector field on the sphere when the
sphere is flattened out. Think of the vectors as attached to a small
band, which is turned over:
The winding number of this vector field around this circle is 2, which
shows that no such vector field can exist.
Problem 7.13. Give an analytic proof of the fact that this winding
number is 2.
This shows more than the fact that a vector field on a sphere must
have singularities. If V
is a vector field on S2 with singularities in a
finite set Z that does not include the north pole, we can define the
index
at a point P of Z to be the index of p*V at the cor-
responding point &p'(P). Then the proof shows that, for any such
vector field V on
In order to include the north pole in thesc considerations, we also
consider a stereographic projection from the south pole. To make the
orientations match in our two charts, we first reflect in the x-axis. So

p*V or of 4,*V at the corresponding point. It follows from Lemma
7. 10 that these indices agree, if both are defined. In fact, we could
use a stereographic projection from any point; all the coordinate trans-
formations as above are
Proposition 7.15. For any vector field with singularities V on S2.

= 2.
PEZ
Proof. Instead of arguing as we did above, we can argue in two steps:
Step 1. There is a vector field V on
with
= 2. For
example, if W is
the
vector field on
given
in (8),
i.e.,
W(x,y)=(x2—y2,2xy), then
is a vector field on the com-
plement of the north pole with one singularity of index 2 at the south
pole. A short calculation shows that V extends continuously to the
north pole, with value there the vector (—2,0,0).
Step 2. We show that the sum of the indices of any two such vector
fields V and W on S is the same. Let P be a point where neither has
a singularity. By Lemma 7. Il, replacing V by another vector field
V with the same indices as V, we can assume that V and W agree in
some neighborhood of P. Then using stereographic projection from
P, one has two vector fields on the plane that agree outside some
large disk that contains all the singularities of either vector field. Tak-
ing a larger circle Cr, their winding numbers around C. will be the
same, and an application of Corollary 7.7 shows that the sum of their
indices is the same.

field on

CHAPTER 8
Vector Fields on Surfaces
8a. Vector Fields on a Torus and Other Surfaces
Let us look next at a surface X which is a torus, i.e., the surface of
a doughnut. This can be realized concretely in several ways: as a
surface of revolution, by an explicit equation in 3-space, as a Carte-
sian product S' X S', or by taking a square or rectangle and identifying
opposite edges:
It is clear by any of these descriptions that there are vector fields
on X that have no singularities at all. In order to state the analogue
of Proposition 7.15 for a torus, we need to define the index of a vector
field at a point on X. One way to do this is to realize X as a quotient

space of the plane
identifying two points if their difference is in
the lattice
This amounts to identifying the opposite sides of the
unit square [0, 1] X [0, 1]. We have a mapping
p:
and giving a vector field V on X is the same as giving a vector field
V on W that is unchanged by translation by any vector in j2, We
can define
index
to be the index of the corresponding
vector field V at any point of W that maps to P. As before, we allow
a finite set Z of singularities, and require V to be continuous outside
Z. Then we have the analogous proposition:
Proposition 8.1. For any vector field with singularities V on a
torus X,
Index,N = 0.
pcz
Proof. Take a square R1a,a+ I] X [b,b+ I] so that the image in
X of the boundary BR does not hit the singularity set Z. Look at the
corresponding vector field Vsn a neighborhood of R. By Proposition
7.5 the winding number of V around BR is the sum of the indices of
V inside R. This winding number is zero, since the vector field is the
same on opposite sides of the square. And the indices inside are the
indices of V on X.
For example, realizing X as a surface of revolution in space as in
the above picture, the projection of a vertical vector (0,0, 1) onto the
tangent space at each point gives a vector field with singularities at
the four points with horizontal tangents. The indices at the points at
the top and bottom (where the height has local maximum and mini-
mum) are + I, while those at the two saddle points are — I.

Vector Fields on Surfaces
Find the vector field on the plane corresponding to the above vector
field, and verify that the indices are 1, —1, —1, and I.
We want to generalize what we have just seen from the sphere and
torus to other surfaces, in particular to the surface of a doughnut with
g holes, or a "sphere with g handles":
We will argue geometrically and rather loosely for now, and post-
pone until later a discussion of what needs to be done to make the
arguments precise and rigorous. From the second picture, taking V to
be the vector field with V(P) the projection on the tangent space
of a vertical vector (0,0, 1) as before, we see that there are two points
with index
1 (at the top and bottom), and 2g points with index —
(at the saddles). This gives one vector field the sum of whose indices
is 2 — 2g. The claim is that this is always the case.
Theorem 8.3 (Poincaré—Hopf). Let X be a sphere with g handles.
For any vector field V with singularities on X, the sum of the indices
of V at the singular points is 2 — 2g.
Proof. Having seen one such vector field, it is enough to show that
any two vector fields have the same sum of indices. By Lemma 7. 11,
we can take a disk in X where both have no singularities, and modify
one so that they agree on such a disk. The idea of the proof is to
mimic the proof for a sphere: take a circle C in such a disk, and punch
out a smaller disk D (inside the circle) from the surface, and spread
the complement X \ D out on the plane. The two vector fields will
then have the same winding number around the curve C, so they will
have the same sum of indices by Proposition 7.5.

8a. Vector Fields on a Torus and Other Surfaces
109
For g >0, however, this complement is not diffeomorphic (or ho-
meomorphic) to a plane domain. However, it can be realized with a
mapping p: X \ D—>
that is a local diffeomorphism, i.e., every point
P in X \ D has a neighborhood that is mapped diffeomorphically (with
a diffeomorphic inverse) onto its image. To visualize this, look first
at the torus. The complement of a disk is formed of two bands joined
together. The mapping p from X \ D can be visualized by picturing
the bands over the plane.

The image of the circle C goes around near the boundary. We can
define the winding number
0) by cutting C up into pieces, each
of which is mapped one-to-one by p into the plane, and using the
usual definition on these pieces. We can also define the index of V
at a point P of X \ D by using the local diffeomorphism
to identify
V with a vector field
near p(P), and defining
to be
the index of
at p(P). To finish the proof, it is enough to show

8. Vector Fields on Surfaces
any singularities, and apply Proposition 7.5 to the restriction of V to
each of the pieces.
As usual, the added pieces get counted twice with opposite signs, so
they cancel, and one is left with the displayed equation.
The same works for any genus g, although the visualization is a
little harder. We claim that, when a closed disk D is removed from
X, the complement can be realized over the plane as indicated (for
g = 3):
Once we have this, the same argument completes the proof of the
theorem. To realize X \ D this way, an essential point is that, as a
larger and larger disk is removed from X, the complements are all
diffeomorphic. To aid in visualization, the situation for g =
1 is re-
done this way on a separate page. The picture after that shows a disk
with "fingers," which can be sewn to the back of the above figure,
giving a sphere with g handles.

8. Vector Fields on Surfaces
Exercise 8.4. Describe a vector field on X that has exactly 2g — 2
singular points, each with index —I.
It is time to discuss what it might take to make this sort of argument
rigorous. First, of course, one should give precise definitions of all
the objects involved: surfaces, a sphere with g handles, a vector field
on a surface, and the index of a vector field at a point. This not being
a course on manifolds, we will not go through all the details (but see
Appendix D for some of them). A key point, however, is that a sur-
face is covered by the images of coordinate charts
that
are homeomorphisms from open sets Ua in the plane to open sets
'PaUla) in X, and the change of coordinate mappings
defined
from
part of (Ia to part of
should be V. For the sphere, for
example, stereographic projections from the two poles gave coordi-
nate charts p and iJs, and for the torus, the mapping p:
= S1 x 5',
restricted to small open sets in the plane, gives charts on X.
A vector field V on X then determines a vector field Va on Ua, and
these are related by the condition that
opa)*(Va) =
on the open
subsets where both are defined. In fact, a vector field on X can be
defined as a collection of such vector fields Va, related by these com-
patibilities under changes of coordinates. The index of V at a point
P in X can be defined as the index of Va at the point
if Pa(Pa) = P.
The key Lemma 7. 10 implies that this is independent of choice of
chart near P. Note that the surface X is assumed to have a differen-
tiable structure, but that the vector field is only assumed to be con-
tinuous in the complement of a finite set.
The description of surfaces via cutting and pasting, which we have
indicated in pictures, could be done explicitly in coordinates, as a

large and not very pleasant exercise. For example, one can verify that
removing a slightly larger disk from a surface gives diffeomorphic
complements. The tools for doing this sort of argument properly are
developed systematically in the subject of differential topology, see
Milnor (1965), Wallace (1968), and Guillemin and Pollack (1974).
Exercise 8.5. What can you say about the number of peaks, valleys,
and passes on a planet shaped like a sphere with g handles?
Exercise 8.6. Does a sphere with g handles have the fixed point prop-
erty?
8b. The Euler Characteristic
Suppose X is a compact surface, and we have a triangulation of X.
This means thatX is cut into pieces homeomorphic to triangles, fitting
together along the edges. We will have a certain number v of vertices
(points), a number e of edges (homeomorphic to closed intervals),
and a numberf of faces (homeomorphic to closed triangles). These
homeomorphisms are assumed to take the ends of intervals to two
distinct vertices, and the three boundary pieces of a triangle onto three
distinct edges.
As you may have discovered in an exercise in the Preface, the
number v — e +f is independent of the triangulation:
Proposition 8.7. For any triangulation of a sphere X with g handles,
v—e+f = 2—2g.
Proof. The idea is to construct a vector field V on X with one sin-
gularity of index
I
for each vertex, one of index — 1 for each edge,
and one of index I for each face. Then the proposition follows from
the Poincaré—Hopf theorem. To do this, do a "barycentric subdivi-

114
8. Vector Fields on Surfaces
sion": put a new vertex in each edge, and one in each face, and con-
nect them as shown.
Then construct a vector field on X, so that in each triangle it looks
like:
Construct it first along the edges: on the old edges pointing from the
old vertices to the new ones added in the middle of the edges, and
on the new edges pointing toward the new vertices in the faces; then
fill in over the new triangles to make it continuous. If this is done,
one has a vector field V whose singularities are at the vertices, and
whose indices are: + I if P is an old vertex; — I if P is a new vertex
along an edge; and + I if P is a new vertex in a face. There are v of
the first, e of the second, andf of the third, so by the Poincard—Hopf
theorem,
v — e +f, for any triangulation, which is the same as
the sum of the indices of any vector field, is called the Euler char-
acteristic of the surface.
Exercise 8.8. Construct a triangulation on the sphere with g handles,
and verify the proposition for this triangulation.

If N
is
the largest integer less than or equal to the number
+ \/49 — 24(2 — 2g)), it is a fact that any map on X can be col-
ored with N colors, and N is the smallest number for which this is
true. See Rademacher and Toeplitz (1957) and Coxeter (1989). Sur-
prisingly, this is much easier for g >0 than for g = 0.
Exercise 8.10. Generalize Proposition 8.7 to allow arbitrary convex
polygons for faces in place of triangles.
Problem 8.11. Suppose a sphere with g handles is decomposed as in
the preceding exercise, but with each polygon having the same num-
ber p of edges, and assume that each vertex lies on the same number
qofedges.(a)Showthatl/p+l/q'/2+(l—g)/e.(b)Wheng=0,
find all positive integers p, q, and e that satisfy this equation, and
show that all possibilities are realized by the boundaries of the five
platonic (regular) solids.
A sphere with g handles can be oriented, i.e., one can coherently
(continuously) define a notion of counterclockwise (or "which way is
up") in the neighborhood of any point. (See Appendix D for a precise
definition.) it is a fact that the only compact surfaces that can be
oriented are diffeomorphic to spheres with g handles. At least with
the assumption that the surface can be triangulated we will prove this
in Chapter 17. There are also compact surfaces that cannot be ori-
ented. One example is the projective plane ftkEP2, which can be real-
ized as a quotient space of the sphere S2, by identifying each point
with its antipodal point. The projection from S2 to RP2 is two-to-one,
but a local diffeomorphism. One can also get
by taking the upper
hemisphere, and identifying opposite points on the boundary equator,
which is the same as identifying opposite points on the boundary of
a disk. Hence the projective plane can also be realized by identifying
the opposite sides of a rectangle as shown:

boundary behavior shown and one singular point.
What is the index at the singular point?
Starting with any surface, one can cut out a disk, and paste back
in a Moebius band, by identifying points on the boundary circles. This
is called a crosscap.
Project 8.16. Investigate the surfaces that arise this way, especially
the sums of indices of vector fields and the notion of Euler charac-
teristic. What do you get when you do this to a sphere? What happens
to the Euler characteristic of a surface when this is done to it? What
is the Euler characteristic of the surface obtained by punching h dis-
joint disks from a sphere with g handles, and sewing h Moebius bands
onto their boundaries. Can you realize the Klein bottle this way? Can
two of these be homeomorphic, if you start with a different g and h?
When?
There is a beautiful proof of the Poincaré—Hopf theorem for a com-
pact surface X that is oriented, using an inner product, varying con-

tinuously, on each tangent space. (If the surface is embedded in 3-space,
one can identify each tangent space
as a subspace of W, and use
the standard inner product on
To show that two vector fields V
and W on X have the same sum of indices, triangulate X so all the
singularities of V or W are inside triangles, and so that each triangle
contains at most one singularity.
If P is a singular point in a triangle T, one can see that the number
—
is thc change in angle of the vector field V — W
around the boundary of T, divided by 2'rr; this change in angle is zero
if there is no singularity in T. Adding over all the triangles, noting
the cancellations along the edges, the theorem follows. (See Hopf
(1983).)
There is a related proof, closer to our first proof for a torus. As
we will see in Chapter 17, the surface X can be realized by identifying
sides as indicated on a plane polygon R with 4g sides:
Exercise 8.17. Show that the resulting surface is a sphere with g
handles.
Given vector fields V and W on X, one can find such a realization

We saw that the Euler characteristic is 2 — 2g by looking at the
vector field of a fluid flowing down the surface, or the gradient of
the height function for the surface sitting nicely in space. That picture
also shows how one can build up the topology of X by looking at the
portion of X whose height is at most h, and seeing how the topology
changes as h increases. One sees that changes occur only when the
height crosses the singularities, and that the change there is controlled
by the indices of these singularities. This is the beginning of the beau-
tiful subject of Morse theory. See Milnor (1963).
There is an important method for reducing some problems about
nonorientable surfaces to the case of orientable surfaces. For a non-
orientable surface_X, there is an orientable surface X and a two-to-
one mapping p: X—*X, which is a local diffeomorphism. The two
points in X over a point P in X correspond to the two ways to orient
X near P. For example, if X is the projective plane, then X is the
sphere. We will discuss this in more detail when we come to covering
spaces, see §16a.
Problem 8.18. Show that a vector field V on X determines a vector
field V on X, and that the sum of the indices of V is twice the sum
of the indices of V. Deduce that if X is any compact surface, the sum
of indices of all vector fields with singularities on X is the same. If
X is the surface constructed by sewing h Moebius bands to a sphere
with g handles with h disks removed, show that X is a sphere with
2g+h— I handles.


PART V
COHOMOLOGY AND
HOMOLOGY, II
In Chapter 9 the first homology group H1U of a plane region U is
computed for a plane region "with n holes." The notion of the integral
of a closed cr I -form over any continuous path or any 1-chain is
defined. We show that these integrals are the same over homologous
1-chains. This leads to useful methods for computing integrals and
winding numbers, and relating the two notions; these are described
in the third section.
The last section of Chapter 9, which is optional, takes a look at
how these ideas are used in complex analysis. This is written as a
(very) short course in complex analysis. It is self-contained, except
for some calculations left as exercises, but in practice it will probably
be most useful to those who have seen some of it before. For ex-
ample, if you have seen Cauchy's formula and the residue theorem
for regions such as disks and rectangles, this will show how the ideas
of topology lead to the appropriate generalizations involving winding
numbers. (This section includes all the analysis that will be needed
when we study Riemann surfaces in Part X.)
The basic theme of the Mayer—Vietoris story in Chapter 10 is to
find relations among the homology and cohomology groups of two
open sets and their union and intersection. This possibility of com-
paring different homology groups Hk, for different k as well as dif-
ferent spaces, is a salient feature of algebraic topology. For coho-
mology, the beginnings of this story were seen in Chapter 5. This

122
Part V. Cohomology and Homology, 11
chapter proves analogous results for homology, and then completes
the cohomology story. This package of results, called the Mayer—
Vietoris theorem, gives a powerful tool for calculating homology and
cohomology groups.
It will be evident that the cohomology and homology groups behave
in a similar, or more precisely, dual fashion. This duality will be
made explicit in Part VIII. In fact, the proof of the full Mayer—Vie-
tons theorem for cohomology of plane domains will depend on this
duality.

9a. Multiply Connected Regions
Let U be an open set in the plane, and let A =
\ U. We know that
for a fixed closed chain y in an open set U, the function P F—> W(y, P)
is constant on connected components of R2 \ Supp('y). It is thcrefore
constant on connected components of A, since each connected com-
ponent of A is contained in some connected component of W Supp(y).
If A is a connected component of W \ U, we write W('y,A) for the
value of
P) for all P in A, and call it the winding number of
around A. Note that the connected components of a closed set such
as
\ U are closed, but they need not be path-connected (see Ex-
ercise 9.5).
Our goal is to calculate the first homology group of U, at least if
this complement A is not too complicated. The idea is to find a closed
path or 1-chain that "goes once" around each "piece" of A, and to
show that these give a free basis for
U. The following lemma gives
a precise statement and rigorous proof that this is possible:
Lemma 9.1. Suppose A is a disjoint union of two closed sets B and
C, with B bounded. Then there is a closed 1-chain y in U such that
W(y,P)= lfor all P in B and W(y,P)
Ofor all P in C.
Proof. By the compactness of B, there is a positive c so that every
point of B is at least distance E away from any point of C. Take a

if PEC, then W('y,P)=EkW(dRk,P)=O.
Li
A 1-chain
having the property of the lemma is certainly not unique,
but any other 1-chain with this property would have the same winding
numbers around all points not in U, and it follows from Theorem 6.11
that it would be homologous to y.
We next describe what it means for U to have "n holes." First we
describe the "infinite" part of the complement A, denoted by
which
will be a closed set with the property that winding numbers of closed
1-chains in U around points in Act are always zero. In most examples
it is obvious what
should be, but the general definition is a little
complicated. Certainly
should contain any unbounded connected
component of A; to assure that we get a closed set, we define
by
the following:
= {P E A: for any r >0 there is a connected subset C
of A containing a point within distance E of P
and a point farther than 1 /E from the origin}.

all closed I -chains y in U and all points P in

that any point of

that the support of any 1-chain is compact. By Proposition 6.8 the
winding number of any closed I -chain around a point of

Such a subdivision exists by the Lebesgue lemma, since each point
in the image of

The proof that this definition is independent of choices is almost

fining a subdivision by adding a point doesn't change the answer.
If y is a cr path, it follows also from Proposition 1.16 that this

to Theorem 3.6. One simply changes winding numbers to integrals,

It follows in particular that the integral of w is the same over two
paths that are homotopie closed paths, or homotopic paths with the
same endpoints. It also follows that the integrals are unchanged by
the reparametrization of paths.
Corollary 9.12. Given two closed 1-chains -y and 8 on U, the fol-
lowing are equivalent:
(1) W(y,P)= W(8,P) for alIP not in U;
(2)
w =

Corollary 9.13. Let U be any open set in the plane. Then the fol-
lowing are equivalent:

Ofcw all closed chains yin U and all P

(2)
w = 0 for all closed chains y in U and all closed i-forms w
on U;
(3) every closed 1-chain is a boundary: H1U = 0; and
(4) every closed 1-form won U is exact: H'U=O.
These conditions hold whenever U is 1-connected, i.e., W \ U = Aa.
Proof. The equivalence of the first three conditions follows from the
preceding corollary. We have (4)4' (2) by Exercise 9.10. Con-
versely, (2) implies that
w =
w whenever
and S are segmented
paths with the same endpoints, and w is any closed I -form; we saw
in Chapter 1 that this makes w exact, which is (4).

Applying Corollary 9.12, we have:
Corollary 9.19. A closed 1-form cv on U is exact if and only if all of
its periods p,(w) are zero.

up to adding integral combinations of the periods. For example, when
U =

riod, which is 2'rr, and we recover the fact that the integral is deter-
mined up to integral multiples of 2'rr.

The plane
can be identified with the complex numbers C, the pair
(x, y) being identified with z = x + iy. Functions on open sets in the
plane will be written as functions of z.
A complex 1-form w on an open set U in the plane is given by a
pair of ordinary (real) I-forms w, and w2, written in the form

Define dw = dw, + idw2, and for a function f= u + iv, with u and v
real-valued functions on U, set df
du + idv. The form w is closed
if clw = 0, and exact if w = df. For example, we have the I-form dz
defined by dz = dx + idy. A complex 1-form can by multiplied by a
complex-valued function: if w is as above, and f= u + iv, then
w
is the complex 1-form
frw =(u+iv)(w,+iw2)= (uw,—vw2)+i(uU)2+vw,).

Let us calif analytic if its real and imaginary parts satisfy the Cau-
chy—Riemann equations. For example, if f is locally expandable in a
power series, then f is analytic, so f(z)dz is closed. Indeed, if
f(z) =

The main fact about complex integrals is
Theorem 9.24 (Cauchy Integral Theorem). if -y is a closed chain in

Proof. Look at F(z) = (1(z) —J(a))/(z — a), which is analytic on U \ {a}.
Using the formula proved just before the statement of the theorem,
the displayed formula is equivalent to the formula

8r(t) = a + re2mt, 0 S t S 1, with r small enough so the disk of radius

to

that
But by Exercise 9.23(b), F(z) has a limit as z
approaches a, and the fact that
F(z) dz approaches iero as the ra-
dius goes to zero follows easily (see Exercise B.8).
The simplest form of Cauchy's formula is when 'y is a circle about
a. Since the right side of Cauchy's formula is expandable in a power
series in a neighborhood of a, this implies in particular the fact that
any analytic function is locally expandable in a power series.

circles and the region between them. For a in the region between the
circles, show that

larities: if f is analytic and bounded in a punctured neighborhood of
a point b, then f extends to an analytic function in a full neighborhood
of b.
A related application is to the general residue theorem. 1ff is an-
alytic in a punctured neighborhood of a point a (i.e., in some U \ {a},
for U a neighborhood of a), the residue of f at a, denoted Resa(f),
is defined by
Resa(f) = 2w

where S is a small counterclockwise circle around a. By the Cauchy
integral theorem, this is independent of the circle chosen.

lOa. The Boundary Map
For open sets U and V in the plane (or any topological space) we will
define a homomorphism
HI(UU
—* H0(EJflV),
called the boundary map.5 To do this we need a lemma.
Lemma 10.1. If y is a I-cycle on UU V. there are 1-chains 7' Ofl U
and 72 Ofl V such that 7' + 72 is homologous to 7 on U U V.
Proof. We know from Lemma 6.4(b) that if a path is subdivided, it
is homologous to the sum of the paths into which it is divided. By
the Lebesgue lemma, each path occurring in y can be subdivided so
that the image of each piece is in U or in V. So
is homologous to
a sum
where each
is a path in U or in V (or both). Then y'
can be taken to be the sum of those ncr1 for which T1 is a path in U,
and 12 can be the sum of the others.
Construction of the boundary map a:H1(UUV)—>I-10(UflV). Re-
call that H1(U U V) = Z1(U U V)/B1(U U V) is the group of I-cycles,
This symbol 3 is certainly overworked in this subject So far we have used it for
the boundanes of I-chains and for maps of rectangles. Rather than introducing dif-
ferent notations for the different uses, we try for clarity by saying in each case to
what sort of object the "8" is being applied.

modulo
the
subgroup
of
1-boundaries,
on
U U V.
And
H0(U fl V) = Z0(U fl V)/80(U U V) is the group of 0-cycles modulo
0-boundaries on U fl V. We will write ['yl for the homology class in
J-IJ(UUV) defined by a I-cycle y on UUV, and we write
in
H0(U fl V) for the class defined by a zero cycle
on U fl V.
Given a homology class a in H1(UUV), by the lemma, we may
choose a 1-cycle that represents a and has the form -'1i' + 12' where
is a I-chain on U and 12 is a 1-chain on V; in symbols,
+ 121 = a.
Since the boundary of this 1-cycle is zero, we have 8(-y1) =
This 0-cycle 8(1) = —8(12) is a 0-cycle on U and on V, so it is a 0-
cycle on Ufl V. We define 8: H1(UU V)—>H0(Ufl V) by sending a
to the class of this 0-cycle:
8(a) = 8([y+12]) = [8(1)1 = —[8(12)].
Note that, although the zero cycle 8(1k) = —8(12) is a boundary on U
and on V, it need not be a boundary on U fl V:
The hardest part of our task is to show that this class
is well
defined.
Lemma 10.2. The class of By1 in H0(U fl V) is independent of the
choice of y' and
Proof. Before giving the proof, we need a more canonical way to
subdivide our 1-chains, by cutting each one exactly in half. For any
path
[0, 1]—> U, define the 1-chain S(1) by the formula S(i) = a + T,
where a and 7 are the restrictions of 'v to the two halves of the in-
terval, but resealed as in Lemma 6.4(b). Extend this operator S lin-
early to all I -chains i =
by setting 5(y) =
n1S(y1). It follows
from this definition that the boundary of the 1-chain 5(y) is the same
as the boundary of y.

lOa. The Boundary Map
139
If 1: [0,
X [0, l}—÷ U is a map of the unit square, we can simi-
larly subdivide F into four pieces el),
and
as indicated:
P2J
Each restriction is rescaled to be a map from [0, 1] x [0, 1] to U. In
formulas,
s) = F('/2t, 1/2s),
s) = F('/2 +
1/2t, 1/2s),
F1"(t, s) = l'(I/21, 1/2 + 1/Qs),
s) = F('/2 +
1/2t,
+ '/2s).
It is clear from the picture, and easy to verify from the formulas, that
this subdivision is compatible with taking the boundary, i.e.,
s(aF) =
+
+
+ aP'",
the inside boundaries canceling as usual.
Now we prove the lemma. Suppose the class a is also represented
by the cycle 'y" + '?2' for I-chains 'y1' on U and
on V. Since both
sums represent 'y, we know that
+ Y2) —
+
is a boundary
on U U V, so we can write
=
for some maps
from rectangles to U U V. We must show that
= [Th1,'} in H0(Ufl V), i.e., that
—
is a boundary of some
I-chain on U fl V. We apply the subdivision operator S to each side
of the displayed equation. On the left, each of the four I-chains is
replaced by another with the same support and the same boundary.
On the right, each oF, is replaced by a sum of the boundaries of the
four subdivisions of
So we have an equation of the same form,
but with all the ['1's cut into quarters. The operator S can be applied
again, which subdivides each of these quarters into quarters, and so
on, dividing the smaller squares into quarters. When applied p times,
we have an equation
+
—
—
=
By the Lebesgue lemma, the restrictions of
to small enough por-
tions of the rectangles must be mapped into U or into V. It follows
that for some large p the right side of this equation can be written in
the form 'r + 'r2, where
is a 1-boundary on U and 'r2 is a 1-boundary

140
10. Mayer—Vietoris
on V. This gives an equation of 1-chains:
—
—
=
—
+ T2.
The left side is a 1-chain on U, the right side a I-chain on V, so the
I -chain they definc is a I -chain on U fl V. And the boundary of this
chain is
=
=
which shows that Thy, —
is a 0-boundary on Un V, and completes
the proof.
Lemma 10.3. The boundary operator a: H,(U U V)—*110(U fl V) is a
homomorphism of abe/ian groups.
Proof. This follows readily from the definition. For if a is represented
by y, +
and a' is represented by
+
with
and
1-chains
on U and
and Y2'
1-chains on V, then a±a' is represented by
so
8(a±a') =

The Mayer—Vietoris story gives the relations among all these groups
and homomorphisms. This can be described in a series of assertions,
moving from right to left in the diagram.
MV(i). Any e/ement in J-10(UU V)
is the sum of the images of an e/e-
ment in H0U and an e/ement in H0V.

lOb. Mayer—Vietoris for Homology
141
Proof. Any 0-chain that reprcsents an clement in H0(U U V) can be
written as a sum of a 0-chain in U and a 0-chain in V.
LI
MV(ii). An element in J-10U and an element in H0V have the same
image in H0(U U V) if and only if they come from some element in
H0(Ufl V).
Proof. Let b and c be 0-chains representing elements in J-10U and H0V.
If they have the same image in H0(U U V), there is a 1-chain -y on
UUV with 3yh—c. By subdividing the paths in I to be suffi-
ciently small, so that the image of each subdivided path is contained
in U or in V, we may find 1-chains
on U and
on V so that
+
= a1. Then b — Thy1 = c +
and the left side of this is a
0-chain
on
U,
and
the
right
side
is
a
0-chain
on
V,
so
a = b —
= c + &Y2 is a 0-chain on U fl V. Since a is homologous
to b on U and to c on V, the class in H0(U fl V) represented by a maps
to the classes represented by b in J-10U and c in H0V. The converse
is immediate from the definitions.
MV(iii). An element in H0(U fl V) maps to zero in I-10U and in H0V
if and only if it is the image by a of some element in H1(UU V).
Proof. We saw during the definition of the boundary a that a bound-
ary always has this form. Conversely, if
= a11 and g = a12 for 1-chains
y' on U and 12 on V, then [fl = a(a), where a is the class represented
by the 1-cycle
LI
MV(iv). An element in H1(U U V) maps to zero in I-10(U fl V) if and
only if it is the sum of an element coming from H1 U and an element
coming from H1V.
Proof. If a = [y' + 12] for some 1-cycle 'li on U and some 1-cycle
12 on V, we may take y' and 12 for the I-chains in the definition of
the boundary, so a(a)=[a11]=0. Conversely, if a is in the kernel
of a, and we write a = [It + 12], with
as in the definition of the
boundary, then a11 = —a2 is a 0-boundary on U fl V, SO a1 = aT for
some I -chain T on U fl V. Therefore,
a =
and 1' — T is a 1-cycle on U and 12 + 7 is a 1-cycle on V.
MV(v). An element in H1U and an element in H1V have the same
image in H1(U U V) if and only if they come from some element in
H1(Ufl IT).

142
10. Mayer—Vietons
Proof. Let
and
be 1-cycles on U and V representing the two
elements. If they have the same image in H1(U U V), there
is an equa-
tion

for some maps
from [0, 11 X [0, 1] to UU V. We apply the sub-
dividing opcrator 5, which was introduced in the proof of Lemma
10.2, to this equation. As in that lemma, if S is applied sufficiently
many times, the images of the subdivided rectangles will be contained
in U or in V, and we will have an equation
=
=
where S1 is a I-boundary on U and
is a 1-boundary on V. Lemma
6.4(b) proves that S takes a I-cycle to a 1-cycle that is homologous
to it. So
—
= S5 +
is a 1-cycle on U fl V that is homologous
to
on U and to
on V, as required. Again, the converse is
obvious.
In the case of open sets in the plane, there is one more assertion
that completes the Mayer—Vietoris story.
MV(vi). If U and V are open subsets of the plane, an element in
I-11(U fl V) is zero if and only if its images in H111 and in H1V are
zero.
Proof.
If
is a
I -cycle representing the element in 111(U fl V), if its
images are zero in 111U and H1V, then the winding number
is zero for all P not in U and all P not in V. This means that W('y,P)
vanishes for all P not in U fl V, and by Theorem 6. 11 this implies
that
is homologous to zero on U fl V.

then U fl V is also connected.
Exercise 10.7. If U fl V is connected, and H1(U fl V) = 0, show that
111(UUV) is isomorphic to the direct sum of H1U and I-11V.
Exercise 10.8. If the homomorphism from H1(U fl V) to J-11V is in-

jective, show that the homomorphism from H1U to H1(U U V) is also
injective.
Exercise 10.9. Suppose A and B are disjoint closed subsets in a space
X, and I-11X = 0. Show that if X \ A and X \ B are path-connected, then
X\ (A UB) is also path-connected.
Let us use Mayer—Vietoris to work out an example. We start with
a familiar situation, with U and V as simple as possible, which arises
when we take the union of two open sets each diffeomorphic to disks.
Suppose U and V are connected, with H1U = 0 = HV. Suppose Un v
has m 
1 connected components. We claim that H1(U U V) is a free
abelian group with m —
I generators. By MV(iv), the boundary map
8 is injective, and by MV(iii), the image of a consists of elements of
H0(Ufl 11) that restrictto zero inH0U= 1 andH0V= 1. NowH0(Ufl 1')
is the free abelian group on the m connected components of U fl V,
so the image of 8 is the kernel of the homomorphism from this free
abelian group to / that maps each component to I. it is easy to see
that this kernel is the free abelian group on m —
1 generators, which
completes the proof. For example, if the components of U fl V are
numbered W1,
.

,
and e is the class that puts coefficient 1 in
front of
— I in front of
and 0 in front of the other com-
ponents, then the classes e1,

in particular, this recovers the fact that if U is the complement of
a point, then H1U = /.
Exercise 10.10. Use Mayer—Vietoris to recover the fact that, if U is
the complement of n points in the plane, then HU is a free abelian
group with n generators. Show that small circles around each of the
points gives a basis for flU.

10. Mayer—Vietoris
lOc. Variations and Applications
The assertions of the Mayer—Vietoris story can be put in fancy lan-
guage (but with no change in content) as follows. Define, for k = 0
and k = 1, a homomorphism
+
HAUEBHkV—> Hk(UUV)
that takes a pair
to the sum of the image of f3 and the image
of
in Hk(U U V). In this language, MV(i) says that this homomor-
phism from !-'0U%H0V—>H0(UUV) is surjective. Similarly, define
a homomorphism
-
:
that sends a class a to the pair (13, —rny), where
is the image of a
in HkU and 'y is the image of a in HLV. Assertion MV(ii) says that
the image of this homomorphism from H0(U fl V) to HOUE9HOV is the
kernel of the homomorphism from HOUEBHOV to J-10(UU V).
Given a sequence
.

.
.
. of abelian groups
and homomorphisms between them, the sequence is called exact at
if the kernel of the map from
to
is equal to the image of
the map from
to
The sequence is called exact if it is exact
at every group in the sequence. For example, the exactness of a se-
quence A—÷B—>0
(at B) means precisely that the map from A to B
is surjective, and the exactness of 0—*A-->B (at A) means that the
map from A to B is injective. Assertions MV(i)—MV(vi) can be sum-
marized in the
Theorem 10.11 (Mayer—Vietoris Theorem for Homology). For any
open sets U and V of a topological space, the sequence
H1(Ufl V)-*H1UEBHV-4H1(UU it)
4H0(Ufl
V)-*0
is exact. If U and V are open subsets of the plane, the sequence
0->H1(Ufl V)->H1UEPHV411(UU V)
-4H0(Ufl
V)—*0
is exact.
Exercise 10.12. Verify that the exactness of the Mayer—Vietoris se-
quence at each term is indeed equivalent to the assertions MV(i)—
MV(vi).

Show that the number of connected components of ER2 \ (A U B) is one
less than the sum of the numbers of connected components of ER2 \ A

Problem 10.17. For any nonempty space X, we considered in §9a
the degree homomorphism deg: H0X—÷ / that takes the class of a zero
cycle
to the sum >2nd of the coefficients. The reduced

map. So X is path-connected if and only if H(X is zero. (a) Show that
[10X is a free abelian group with rank one less that the number of

there is an exact sequence

little smaller.

except for the endpoints is contained in U. Show that U \ X is dis-

Suppose U and V are open sets in the plane, and three of the four
open sets U, V, U fl V, and U U V have homology of finite ranks.
Show that the fourth does also, and that
x(UUV)+x(UflV) = x(U)+x(V).
Using the Mayer—Vietoris theorem, homology groups can be used
instead of cohomology to prove the Jordan Curve Theorem:
Problem 10.20. With U and V as in the proof of Theorem 5.10, show
that the image of the boundary map
a:H1(UuV)=H1(W\{P,Q}) —> H0(UflV)=110(ftk2\X)
is free with one generator, and deduce that 110(1R2 \ X) is a free abelian
group with two generators, so the complement of X has two connected
components. Similarly with U and V as in the proof of Theorem 5. 11,
show that the image of 8 is zero, and deduce that H0(W \ Y) is a free
abelian group with one generator, so
\ Y is connected.
The following are some complements to the Jordan Curve Theorem
that can be proved by combining Mayer—Vietoris with Corollary 9.4
or Problem 9.9:
Problem 10.21. A compact set K of an open set U is said to separate
two points if they belong to different connected components of U \ K.
Prove the following version of "Alexander's Lemma": If Y and Z arc
compact subsets of U, with Y fl Z connected, and P and Q arc two
points in U \ (Y U Z) that are not separated by Y or by Z, then they
are not separated by Y U Z.
Problem 10.22. Let X be a subset of the plane homcomorphic to a
circle, P a point on X, and D a disk centered at P. Let A be an open
arc of X containing P and contained in D, and let B be the comple-
mentary closed arc. Let E be a disk centered at P that doesn't meet
B. Show that if two points in E are not separated by X, then they can
be connected by a path in D \ X.

with a disk of radius r. Note that this is false when X is homeo-
morphic to an interval.

U \ (Y U Z) has at least n connected components. (b) If U \ Y and U \ Z
are connected, show that U \ (YU Z) has exactly n connected com-
ponents.
lOd. Mayer—Vietoris for Cohomology
The Mayer—Vietoris story for cohomology is similar to—in fact, dual
to—that for homology. If U' is an open subset of a plane open set
U, the restriction of 1-forms from U to U' takes closed forms on U
to closed forms on U', and exact forms on U to exact forms on U',
so we have a linear map of vector spaces
H'(U)-*H'(U').
There is also a linear map H°(U)—> !-I°(U') that takes a locally constant
function on U to its restriction to U'. If U and V are open sets in the
plane, we therefore have a diagram
H°U
HU
/N
/
H°(UUV)
H°(UnV)
> H'(UuV)
H'(UnV)
H°V
H'V
where the maps in each diagram are determined by restrictions, and
8 is the coboundary map defined in Chapter 5. The Mayer—Vietoris
story for De Rham cohomology, for open sets in the plane, is the
combination of six assertions:

148
10. Mayer—Vietoris
MV(i). An element in H°(U U V) maps to zero in H°U and in H°V if
and only if it is zero.
MV(ii). An element in H°U and an element in H°V have the same
image in H°(U fl V) if and only if they come from some element in
H°(UUV).
MV(iii). An element in Ft(Ufl V) maps to zero in H'(UU V) if and
only if it is the difference of an element coming from I-PU and an
element coming from H°V.
MV(iv). An element in H'(U U V) maps to zero in H'U and H'V if
and only if it is the image by 8 of an element in H°(U fl IT).
MV(v). An element in H'U and an element in H'V have the same
image in H'(U fl V) if and only if they come from some element in
H1(UUV).
MV(vi). Any element in H'(U fl V) is the difference of an element
coming from H'U and an element coming from H'V.
Of these, MV(i) and MV(ii) are straightforward exercises, and
MV(iii) and MV(iv) are Propositions 5.7 and 5.9. We prove the non-
trivial assertion in MV(v). Given closed 1-forms a on U and
on V,
such that there is a functionfon U fl V with a —
= dfon Un V, we
must construct a closed i-form w on U U V that differs from a by an
exact form on U, and from
by an exact form on V. That is, we
want functionsf1 on U andf2 on V such that
a—df1 =
on U fl V. In other words, we want df1 — df, = df So it will be enough
to findf1 andf2 so thatf
f on Ufl V. The existence of suchf,
follows from Lemma 5.5.
The last case, MV(vi), however is not so obvious. We postpone
the proof until Chapter 15, where we make rigorous the "duality"
between homology and cohomology. With this duality, in fact, all six
assertions for cohomology will be seen to follow from the six asser-
tions for homology.
U
The cohomology version of Mayer—Vietoris also has its concise
expression as an exact sequence. Define linear maps
+

by sending a class to the pair consisting of the restrictions of the class
to each open set. Define linear maps
-
: frUGJH"V—>H1'(UflV)
by taking a pair (wj,w2) to the difference
of its re-
strictions. As in the case for homology, the assertions MV(i)—MV(vi)
are equivalent to the exactness of a sequence:
Theorem 10.26 (Mayer—Vietoris Theorem for Cohomology). For any
open sets U and V in the plane, the sequence
O-*H°(UU V)4H°UEBH°V-*H°(Ufl V)
4H'(UU
V)—*O
is exact.
It is probably worth remarking that the choice of signs "+" and
—" in both the homology and cohomology versions of Mayer—Vie-
tons is perfectly arbitrary; those we have chosen will be convenient
later.
The following two exercises use Mayer—Vietoris for cohomology,
including MV(vi), to strengthen some facts we saw in Chapter 9:
Exercise 10.27. Suppose A and B are disjoint closed subsets in the
plane. Use Mayer—Vietoris to construct an isomorphism
H'(R2\(A UB))
Generalize to the complement of any finite number of disjoint closed
subsets.
Exercise 10.28. If K is a compact subset of an open set U, and K
has n connected components, construct an isomorphism
H'(U\K)
LJ'U$W,
where the maps to the second factor are given by periods around the
components of K.
Exercise 10.29. If U is not empty, define i-PU to be the quotient
space
of the locally constant functions on U by the subspace
of constant functions. This is called the reduced 0th cohomology group.
Ss dim(H°U) = dim(H°U) — I, and U is connected exactly when
H°U is zero. Show that, if U fl V is not empty, there is an exact

Problem 10.30. Let K be any compact connected subset of W, U a
connected component of R2 \ K. Show that the boundary 8U of U
is
connected. Is the same true if K is only closed and connected in

PART VI
COVERING SPACES AND
FUNDAMENTAL GROUPS, I
In Chapter II we introduce the notion of covering maps, which are
generalizations of the polar coordinate mapping, and study their basic
properties. Facts about lifting paths and homotopies will generalize
what we saw for this special case, which amounted to the basic prop-
erties of winding numbers. Many coverings, including the polar co-
ordinate mapping, are examples of G-coverings, arising from an ac-
tion of a group G on a space, and we emphasize those that arise this
way.
We have studied closed paths, and seen that homotopic paths have
similar properties. In Chapter 12 we formally introduce the funda-
mental group, which is the set of homotopy equivalence classes of
closed paths starting and ending at a fixed point, the equivalence given
by homotopy. In the last section we see how it is related to the first
homology group.


CHAPTER 11
Covering Spaces
ha. Definitions
If X and Y are topological spaces, a covering map is a continuous
mapping p: Y—> X with the property that each point of X has an open
neighborhood N such thatp'(N) is a disjoint union of open sets, each
of which is mapped homeomorphically by p onto N. (If N is con-
nected, these must be the components of
1(N).) One says that p is
evenly covered over such N. Such a covering map is called a covering
of X.
An isomorphism between coverings p: Y—>X and p': Y' —>X is a
homeomorphism p: Y—* Y' such that p' °p = p. A covering is called
trivial if, in the definition, one may take N to be all of X. Equiva-
lently, a covering is trivial if it is isomorphic to the projection of a
product X X T onto X, where T is any set with the discrete topology
(all points arc closed). So any covering is locally trivial.

or in a vertical picture:

p
We saw in Chapter 2 that the polar coordinate mapping
p
:
—>
given by p(r, ti) = (rcos(tfl, rsin(*)), is a covering. Another is the
mapping
S' —> S', for any integer n  1, given by
(cos(2rr&), sin(2irtI))
(cos(2'rrntI), sin(2-rrnti)),
or, using complex numbers, by
f; this can be visualized by join-
ing the loose ends in the last picture.
Exercise 11.1. Show that the following are covering maps, where
= C \ {O} is the group of nonzero complex numbers: (i) the nth
power mapping
z—*f; and (ii) the exponential mapping
exp:
Exercise 11.2. Let p: Y—*X be a covering. If X' is any subspace of
X, verify that the restriction Y'
is a covering.
Exercise 11.3. If p: Y—*X is a covering of an open subset X in the
plane, show that Y can be given the structure of a differentiable sur-
face in such a way that p is a local diffeomorphism. The components
V of p '(N), for N a connected open set in X over which the covering

ha. Definitions
155
is trivial, together with the homeomorphisms of N with V given by
the inverse of p, give charts covering Y. Similarly, any covering of
any manifold has a natural manifold structure.
Exercise 11.4. Show that if X is connected, all fibers of a covering
Y—÷X have the same cardinality.
When each
has cardinality a finite number n, the covering
is called an n-sheeted covering. It should be emphasized, however,
that one cannot distinguish n different "sheets," unless the covering
is trivial.
If p:
is a covering, and f:Z—*X is a continuous mapping,
a continuous mapping f:
Y such that p of =f is called a lifting
of f.

In the next section we will discuss the question of whether such lift-
ings exist. The following lemma discusses uniqueness: if Z is con-
nected, a lifting is determined by where it maps any one point.
Lemma 11.5. Let p: Y—>X be a covering, and let Z be a connected
topological space. Supposef1 andf2 are 20n nuous mappings from
Z to Y such that pof,
pof2. If f,(z)
for one point z in Z,
then
=/2.
Proof. It suffices to show that the set in Z where the mappings agree
is open, and its complement where they disagree is also open. If w
is in the set where they agree, take a neighborhood N of p of.(w) that
is evenly covered by p. Let p'(N) be a disjoint union of open sets
N0, with each N0, mapped homeomorphically to N by p. By conti-
nuity, /' and f2 must map a neighborhood V of w into the same N0,
and since pof, =pof2, f, and f2 must agree on V. Similarly, if w is
in the set where the mappings do not agree, f, and f2 must map a
neighborhood V of w into two different (and hence disjoint) N0's, so
they disagree on V.

156
II. Covering Spaces
lib. Lifting Paths and Homotopies
The work we did in studying the winding number will be abstracted
and formalized in the following propositions. In §2a we saw that de-
fining an angle function amounted to lifting a closed path 'y in
\ {O}
to a path j? in the right half plane so that the composite of
with the
polar coordinate covering p is the given path 'y; the difference in sec-
ond coordinates of ¶ from start to end is then the change in angle
along y. We will now see that this is a general property of covering
spaces.
Proposition 11.6 (Path Lifting). Let p: Y—>X be a covering, and let
y: [a, hi —>X be a continuous path in X. Let y be a point of Y with
p(y) = y(a). Then there is a unique continuous path
[a,bj—> Ysuch
that
= y and p° j7(t) = y(t) for all t in the interval [a, hi.
Proof. The uniqueness comes from Lemma II .5. When the covering
is trivial, the proposition is obvious: there is a unique component of
Y that contains y and maps homeomorphically to the component of X
that contains y(Ja, hi), and one must simply lift the path to that com-
ponent using the inverse horneomorphism. For the general case, we
apply the Lebesgue lemma (Appendix A) to the open sets f'(N),
where N varies over open sets in X that are evenly covered by p. This
gives a subdivision a =
.
. . S t,, = b such that each
t1i) is
contained in some open set that is evenly covered by p. By the trivial
case, there is a lifting of the restriction of y to [t0, zj, giving a path
in Y from y to some point y. Similarly, there is a lifting of the re-
striction of y to [t1, t2J that starts at yi; and one proceeds in n steps
until one has lifted the whole path.
It follows in particular that the final point
of the lifting is de-
termined by
and by the initial point y. We denote this point by y *
so
y*n,i =
If this is applied to the polar coordinate covering, and y = (r0, -'%) and
y*'y=(r1,fJ1) are the initial and final points of the lifting of a path
y, then the difference
—
is the total change of angle along
Exercise 11.7. Verify this last statement.
One consequence of the path-lifting proposition is the fact that any
covering of an interval must be trivial.

lib. Lifting Paths and Homotopies
157
The fact that homotopic paths in
{O} with the same endpoints
have the same total change of angle around zero is equivalent to the
fact that their liftings are homotopic. This too is a general fact about
coverings.
Proposition 11.8 (Homotopy Lifting). Let p: Y—> X be a covering,
and letHbe a homotopy of paths inX, i.e., H: [a,b]X [0, l]—>X is
a continuous mapping. Let y0(t) = H(t, 0), a S t S b, be the initiaL path.
Suppose Yo
is a lifting of yo.
hen
there is a unique lifting H of H
whose initial path is Yo' i.e., H: [a,
>< [0, 1]—* Y is continuous, with
poH=HandH(t,O)5/o(t), astsb.
Proof The proof is very much the same as for Proposition 11.6. First
apply the Lebesguc lemma to know that there are subdivisions
a=t0<t1<

then each

piece

tion of H to R11, R21
then doing the same for the next
row R12, R22, .

and so on until the entire rectangle has been
covered.

lifted homotopy H is a homotopy of paths from y to y'. (The
fact that
H is constant on the sides of the rectangle is guaranteed by the unique-
ness of the lifting of the restriction of H to these sides.) In particular,
if H

For the polar coordinate mapping, this is the preceding assertion about
homotopic paths having the same change of angle.
Exercise 11.9. Use the homotopy lifting proposition to show that
homotopic closed paths in R2 \ {0} have the same winding number.
(The paths in the homotopy are assumed to be closed, but the end-
points can vary during the homotopy.)
Exercise 11.10. Use the homotopy lifting proposition to prove that
any covering of a rectangle (closed or open) must be trivial. Deduce
the same for any space homeomorphic to a rectangle, such as a disk.

11 c. G-Coverings
Many important covering spaces arise from the action of a group G
on a space Y, with X the space of orbits. Recall that an action of a

lIe. G-Coverings
159
group G on Y (on the left) is a mapping GXY—÷Y, (g,y)—>g.y,
satisfying:
(2) e y = y for all y in Y, where e is the identity in G; and
(3) the mapping
is a homeomorphism of Y for all g in G.
In other words, G defines a group of homeomorphisms of Y. Two
points y and y' are in the same orbit if there is an element g in G
that maps one to the other: y' = g y. Since G is a group, this is an
equivalence relation. Let X = Y/G be the set of orbits, or equivalence
classes. There is a projection p: Y—>X that maps a point to the orbit
containing it. The space X is equipped with the quotient topology
(i.e., a set U in X is defined to be open when f'(U) is open in Y).
Exercise 11.15. (a) The group 1 acts on
by translation: n r = r + n.
Show that the quotient
can be identified with the covering
map from
to 5' described in the first section.
(b) Show that the polar coordinate covering map is the quotient of
the right half plane by a i-action.
(c) The group G =p'n of nth roots of unity (which is a cyclic group
of order n) in C acts by multiplication on 5', regarded as the complex
numbers of absolute value 1. Compare the quotient map with the coy-
described in §lla.
For another example, the group with two elements acts on the
n-sphere with the nontrivial element taking a point to its antipodal
point; i.e.,
acts on 5fl, with ±1
±P. The quo-
tient space is the real projective space
and the quotient mapping
1W" is a two-sheeted covering.
We say that G acts evenly6 if any point in Y has a neighborhood V
such that
V and
V are disjoint for any distinct elements g and h

Exercise 11.16. The group pU,, of nth roots of unity acts on C by
6 The standard terminology for the notion we are calling "even" is the mouthful
"properly discontinuous." The word "discontinuous" does not mean that anything
is not continuous or otherwise badly behaved; it means that the orbits are discrete
subsets of Y The word "properly" refers to the fact that every compact set only
meets finitely many of its translates If this were not bad enough, the use of "prop-
erly discontinuously" in the literature is inconsistent, in that often it is only required
that each point have a neighborhood V such that at most finitely many translates
g' V of V can intersect. In this case the word "freely" is added, so our "evenly" is

on the open subset C* = C \ {0} is even.
Lemma 11.17. If a group G acts evenly on Y, then the projection
p: Y—> Y/G is a covering map.
Proof. The map p is continuous, and open since for V open in Y, the
set p'(p(V)) is the union of open sets
g
V is taken as
in the definition of an even action, then this union is a disjoint union.
It is enough to prove that for such V, the mapping from each
V to
p(V) induced by p is a bijection, for then it follows that p is evenly
covered over p07). This
is a straightforward verification: since
fory in V, it is surjective;
there
is some h in G with
and the fact that the action is
even implies that h is the identity.
LI
A covering p: Y—÷X is called a G-covering if it arises in this way
from an even action of G on Y. An isomorphism of G-coverings is
an isomorphism of coverings that commutes with the action of G; i.e.,
an isomorphism of the G-covering p: Y—> X with the G-covering
p': Y'—>X is a homeomorphism p: Y—*Y' such that p'°ç=p and
y) =
p(y) for g in G and y in Y. The trivial G-covering of X
is the product X X G—÷X, where G acts by (left) multiplication on
the second factor.
Lemma 11.18. Any G-covering is locally trivial as a G-covering,
i.e., jfp: Y—>X is a G-covering, then any point in X has a neigh-
borhood N such that the G-covering p '(N)—> N is isomorphic to the
trivial G-covering N X G—÷N.

locally compact metric space). This puts a gcometric structure on the
quotient space X which is locally Euclidean. The reader is invited to
look at the resulting "locally Euclidean geometry" on X for some of
the groups we have seen. For a general discussion, with a list of
possibilities for W and W, see Nikulin and Shafarevich (1987).
lid. Covering Transformations
For any covering p: Y—> X there is a group Aut(Y/X) of covering
transformations, or deck transformations:
Aut(Y/X) = {p: Y— Y: p is a homeomorphism and pop = p}.
This is a group by composition of mappings, and it acts on Y in the
sense of the preceding section; it is called the automorphism group
of the covering.
Exercise 11.35. If Y—*X is a trivial n-sheeted covering, and X is
connected, show that Aut(Y/X) is isomorphic to the symmetric group
on n letters.
Exercise 11.36. If p: Y—*X is the covering of Exercise 11.14, show
that Aut(Y/X) contains only the identity element.
If the covering is a G-covering, there is a canonical homomorphism
from G to Aut(Y/X) that takes g to the homeomorphism
By
the definition of even action, this homomorphism is injective. It need
not be surjective; for example, it is not surjective if the covering is
a trivial G-covering, see Exercise II .35.
Proposition 11.37. If p: Y—>X is a G-covering, and Y is connected,
then the canonical homomorphism G
Aut( Y/X) is an isomorphism.
Proof. Fix any point y in Y. Given p in Aut(Y/X), since y and p(y)
lie in the same orbit, there is a g in G such that
g and p both take y to p(y),
so by Lemma 11.5 they coincide.
U
For a G-covering, G acts transitively on each fiberp'(x) of p; that
is, for y and y' in a fiber, there is a g in G with g y = y'. In addition,
this action is faithful: the element g taking y to y' is unique. The
following proposition gives a converse to this:

164
11. Covering Spaces
Proposition 11.38. Let p: Y—*X be a covering, with Y connected
and X locally connected. Then
acts evenly on Y. if
acts transitively on a fiber of p, then the covering is a G-covering,
with G=Aut(Y/K).
Proof. We show first that thc action is even. For y in Y, let N be a
neighborhood of p(y) evenly covered by p, and let V be the neigh-
borhood of y mapping homeomorphically to N by p. If p and p' are
distinct covering transformations, then p(V) and cp'(V) must be dis-
joint, for if not, then
has a fixed point in V. and Lemma 11.5
implies that
is the identity.
Let G = Aut(Y/X). The covering p factors into the composite of
the projection Y—* Y/G followed by a mapping fl: Y/G—÷X. It fol-
lows easily from the definitions that this p is a covering mapping;
indeed, any open connected set of X that is evenly covered by p is
evenly covered by p. If x is a point in X such that G acts transitively
on
1(4, then the fiber of p over x has only one point. By Exercise
11.4, all fibers of p have one point, so p is a homeomorphism. It fol-
lows that p is a G-covering.
U
Problem 11.39. Let p: Y—>X be a covering, with Y connected and X

determined by this restriction, so Aut(Y/X) C Aut(S). Show that

CHAPTER 12
The Fundamental Group
12a. Definitions and Basic Properties
The aim of this section is to make the homotopy equivalence classes
of paths that start and end at a fixed point in a space into a group.
We will see later how this group tells us about the covering spaces
of X, as well as determining the first homology and cohomology groups
(when X is an open set in the plane). In this chapter it will be con-
venient again to have all paths defined on the same interval. So a
path in a topological space X will be a continuous map "y: [0, lj—*X.
We say that y is a path from the point x
to the point x' =
In this chapter a homotopy of paths will always fix the endpoints x
and
i.e., H(0, s)
and H(l, s) =
for all0sss 1.
If a is a path from a point x to a point x', and t is a path from f
to a point x", there is a product path, denoted a T, which is a path
from x to 1. It is the path that first traverses a, then 7, but it must
do so at double speed to complete the trip in the same unit time:
Ia(2t)
a7(t) =
If a is a path from x to x', there is an inverse path a' from x' to x:

166
12. The Fundamental Group
Exercise 12.1. Show that, for paths from a point x to a point x', the
relation of being homotopie is an equivalence relation.
Next we verify that, up to homotopy, these operations satisfy (where
defined!) the group axioms. For example, if if is a path from x to x',
there is a homotopy from the path
if to u. This is done by adjusting
the time of waiting at x, as indicated in the diagram:
We write down the corresponding homotopy, which is constant on
the vertical and slanted lines drawn; on horizontal lines, it is the same
as indicated on the top and bottom, but adjusted proportionally:
Exercise 12.2. Construct a homotopy from
to u.
In these cases, and those that follow, it is not hard to write down
explicit formulas for the homotopy, using a little plane geometry to
map rectangles and triangles onto each other, to interpolate between
the values we want on boundary lines. It may be worth pointing out
that one could also appeal to general results about maps between con-
vex sets that guarantee the existence of such maps; the formulas them-
selves are not important.
If if is a path from x to x', T a path from x' to x", and
is a path
from x" to 1", there is a homotopy from (if

Now, for a point x in X, a loop at x is a path that starts and ends
at x. Define the fundamental group of X with base point x, denoted
'rr1(X, x), to be the set of equivalence classes of loops at x, where the
equivalence is by homotopy (see Exercise 12. 1). We write ['yJ for the
class of the loop
The identity is the class e =
of the constant
path E1. Define a product by
[a . Ti. The last displayed ho-
motopy implies that this product is well defined on the equivalence
classes. The others imply the equations

in rr1(X,x). Since (a')
= a, the equation [a'i [ai = e follows. So
this product makes 'rr1(X,x) into a group. From Exercise 12.3(b) we
deduce that the product ([of
ftt] is also equal to [a
It should be emphasized that endpoints must be fixed during the
homotopies discussed here. Otherwise any loop
would be homo-
topic to a constant loop, by the homotopy H(t, s) = 'y((l — s)O.
1ff: X—> Y is a continuous function, and fix) = y, then f determines
a homomorphism of groups
rr(X,x) —> 7r1(Y,y),
that takes [a] to [foa].
Exercise 12.4. Verify that this is well defined and a group homo-
morphism.
The fundamental group is a "covariant functor, on the category of
pointed spaces." This means that, if we also have a map g: Y—>Z
with g(y)z, so that we also have
then
i.e., the diagram

commutes. In addition, iff is the identity,
'rr(X,x)—>'rr(X,x)
is the identity mapping.
Some of the simple applications of fundamental groups use nothing
more than this functoriality. For example, if we know that 'rr1(X,x)
is a "complicated" group, and -rr1(Y,y) is a "simple" group, so that
there are no homomorphisms of groups such that the composite
'Tr1(X,x)—>m(Y,x)—*7r1(X,x) is the identity, then there can be no
continuous mapsf:
Y and g: Y—*X such that gof is the identity
map on X. For example, if 'r1(X,x) is not the trivial group, and 'rr1(Y,y)
is trivial, then X cannot be embedded in Y as a retract.
Exercise 12.5. Show that 'ti1(D2,x) = {e} for any x in the disk, and
that the winding number determines an isomorphism of 'rr1(S', (1 , 0))
with /. Deduce that S' is not a retract of D2.
Exercise 12.6. Show that if X C W is a subspace that is starshaped
about the point x, then 'rr1(X,x) = {e}.
Although the definition of fundamental group depends on the choice
of base point, one gets the same group (up to isomorphism) if one
chooses another base point, at least if X is path-connected, or if the
two points can be connected by a path. Suppose 7 is a path from x
to x'. Define a map
'rr1(X,x) —> 'rr1(X,x')
by [y]
.
. T)1 = [(7' . y) . 7]. As before, this is well defined,
and is a homomorphism of groups. It is an isomorphism, since (7 ')#
gives the inverse homomorphism from 'rr1(X,x') to 'rr1(X,x).
Exercise 12.7. (a) Verify these assertions. (b) If 7' is another path
from x to x', show that
=
where p is the loop 'r'
In particular, if t and 7' are homotopic
paths from x to x', they determine the same isomorphism on funda-
mental groups. In general, the displayed equation means that the iso-
morphism from rr1(X,x) to 'rr1(X,x') depends on the choice of path
from x to x' only up to inner automorphism.
For this reason, if X is a path-connected space, one often speaks
of "the fundamental group" of X, without referring to a base point.
This will cause no confusion as long as we are only interested in the
group up to isomorphism.

170
12. The Fundamental Group
The fundamental group of a ball
or of W is trivial, say by Ex-
ercise 12.6. We have seen that the circle has an infinite cyclic fun-
damental group. Let's look next at the n-sphere
for n  2. This is
almost as simple as it seems. The complement of any point in r is
homeomorphic to R'1, so any loop that misses any point is homotopic
to the constant loop. Although it is possible for a continuous loop to
map onto the n-sphere, for any such n, this is not a serious obstruc-
tion. We will see a more general reason later, but for now it can be
seen directly:
Exercise 12.8. Show that any path in 5n, n  2, is homotopic to a
path whose image contains no neighborhood of any of its points. De-
duce that the fundamental group of
n  2.
Exercise 12.9. Show that the fundamental group of a Cartesian prod-
uct is the product of fundamental groups of the spaces:
'rr1(XXY,xXy)
'rr1(X,4Xir1(Y,y).
Problem 12.10: If (43 is a topological group, show that 'rr1((53, e) is
commutative.
12b. Homotopy
Two continuous maps
X —* Y and
X —* Y are homotopic if there
is a continuous mapping H: X X 10, 1]
Y such that H(z, 0) =f0(z) and
H(z, 1) =f1(z) for all points z in X; H is a homotopyfromfi) tof1. We
want to say that homotopic maps determined the same homomor-
phism on fundamental groups, but to make this precise we must keep
track of base points. Let x be a base point in X, and let Yo =f0(x) and
f1(x). The mapping 7(t) = H(x, t) is a path from Yo to Y'.
Proposition
12.11. The diagram
rc1(Y,y0)
n1(Y, Y)
commutes, i.e.,
Proof. Let
y be a loop at x. We need to construct a homotopy from

Consider the homotopy h

This provides a kind of homotopy between the path f1

1 2c. Fundamental Group and Homology
For any topological space X, with base point x in X, there is a ho-
momorphism from the fundamental group -r1(X, x) to the homology
group H1X, that takes the class
of a loop y at x to the homology
class of y, regarded as a closed path or I-chain. It takes the constant
path E1 at x to 0. The fact that it is well defined amounts to the fact
that homotopic paths define the same homology class, as we saw in
Lemma 6.4. The same lemma showed that the homology class of a
product a T of loops is the sum of the homology classes of the loops,
which shows that the mapping is a homomorphism of groups.
Exercise 12.21. 1ff X—>Y is a continuous mapping, and f(x)=y,
show that the following diagram commutes:
f*
7c1(X,x)
H1X
>
H1Y.
Since H1X is an abelian group, this homomorphism must vanish on
all commutators
b a'b' in 7r1(X,x), so it must vanish on the
commutator subgroup [m(X,x),rr1(X,x)1 that consists of all finite
products of commutators. This is a normal subgroup of 'rr1(X,x), and
the quotient group is sometimes called the abelianized fundamental
group of X, and denoted 'rr1(X, X)ahel. So we have a homomorphism
TrI(X,X)abel = 'rr1(X,x)/[ir1(X,x),iT1(X,x)j
H1X.
Since the fundamental group 'rr1(X,4 depends only on the path-
connected component of X that contains x, we cannot expect the fun-
damental group to determine the homology group for disconnected
spaces. But except for this, the fundamental group determines the
homology group:
Proposition 12.22. If X is a path-connected space, then the canonical
homomorphism from 1T1(X, X)abel to H1X is an isomorphism.
Proof. We must define a homomorphism from the abelian group Z1X
of 1-cycles to
and show that the 1-boundaries B1X map
to zero. This will give a map back from H1X to

PART VII
COVERING SPACES AND
FUNDAMENTAL GROUPS, II
In this part we will see that the two basic notions of covering spaccs
and fundamental groups are intimately related. In Chapter 13 we see
how knowledge of the fundamental group controls the possible cov-
erings a space may have: coverings correspond to subgroups of the
fundamental group. There is a universal covering, from which all other
coverings can be constructed. In Chapter 14 we use this the other way
to prove the Van Kampen theorem, which relates the fundamental
group of a union of two spaces to the fundamental groups of the two
spaces and the fundamental group of their intersection. This can be
regarded as the analogue for the fundamental group of the Mayer—
Vietoris theorem for the homology group. The proof we give depends
on a correspondence between G-coverings and homomorphisms from
the fundamental group to G.
Caution to Beginners. The theorems relating coverings and the fun-
damental group are stated in their natural generality, with various
technical conditions about the spaces involved. This has two advan-
tages: you will have a reasonably complete story when you are fin-
ished, and the precise conditions sometimes help in shaping the proofs.
However, this also has a large disadvantage: the proliferation of these
technical conditions can get in the way of the main ideas. At least

178
Part VII. Covering Spaces and Fundamental Groups, II
for a first reading, it is probably a good idea to simply assume all
spaces arising are reasonably behaved—for example, that they are
open sets in the plane or a surface or manifold, or perhaps a finite
graph. These cases, in fact, will suffice for the applications consid-
ered in this text.

CHAPTER 13
The Fundamental Group
and Covering Spaces
13a. Fundamental Group and Coverings
We first have the basic:
Proposition 13.1. If p: Y—>X is a covering, and p(y) = x, then the
induced homomorphism
ir1(Y, y)—+ n1(X, x) is an injection.
Proof. This is a consequence of the lifting properties of Chapter 1 1.
We must show that the kernel of p* is {e}. If
is a loop at y, and
p*Ioi = e, there is a homotopy H from p°if to the constant path
at x. By homotopy lifting, H lifts to a homotopy H from u to somc
path. Since Hmaps the sides and top of the unit square to the point
x, its lifting H (by uniqueness oj path-lifting) maps the sides and top
of the square to the point y. So H is a homotopy from if to the constant
path
e, as required.
U
Exercise 13.2. (a) If if is a loop at x, and d is the unique lifting of
if to a path starting at y, show that d ends at y if and only if its class
is in the image
i.e.,
(b) If if and if' are two
paths in X from x to x', and d and it' are the lifts to paths in Y starting
at y, show that & and it' have the same endpoint if and only if [if' .if']
is in p*('rr1(Y,y)). In the notation of §llb,
y*if=y*if'

13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
Exercise 13.3. If y' is another point in Y with p(y') = x, and y and
y' can be connected by a path in Y, show that the image of
in 'rr1(X,x) is a subgroup conjugate to the image of 'rr1(Y,y). In fact,
if a is a path from y' to y, and
=p°a is its image, show that
p*('rr(Y,y')) = [ii
hi
Given a covering p: Y—*X, for any point y with p(y) = x, and any
loop a at x, we defined y * a to be the endpoint of the lift of a that
starts aty. This point y*a is also inp1(x). We saw in §llb that if
a' is a loop homotopic to a, then y*a' =y*a. For any homotopy
class [a] in 'rr1(X,x), we can therefore define
to bey*a. This
defines a right action of the fundamental group 'rr1(X,x) on the fiber
'(x):
p1(x)XIT1(X,x)
p'(x),
yX[a] F—) y*[aj,
taking y X [a] to the endpoint of the lift of a that starts at y.
Exercise 13.4. Show that this is a right group action; in particular,
y * ([al
['r]) = (y * [a]) * [T]. If Y is path-connected, show that this ac-
tion is transitive: for any y and y' in p 1(x) there is some Ia] with
y * [a] = y'. Show that the subgroup that acts trivially on a point y is
exactly
For fixed y, show that this defines a one-to-one
correspondence between set of right cosets 'rri(X,x)/p*('rr1(Y,y)) and
the fiber p'(x). In particular, the index of the subgroup
in 'rr1(X, 4 is the number of sheets of the covering.
We saw in the last chapter that fundamental groups provide an ob-
struction to the existence of mappings: if there is no map between the
groups, there cannot be a map between the spaces. The following
proposition shows that, in the case of covering maps, the converse
holds: if the fundamental groups say there may be a map, then there
will be. Recall that a space X is locally path-connected if any neigh-
borhood of any point contains a neighborhood that is path-connected.
Proposition 13.5. Suppose p: Y—>X is a covering, andf: Z—X is a
continuous mapping with Z a connected and locally path-connected
space. Let x E X, y E Y, z E Z, be points with p(y)
f(z) = x. In order
for there to be a continuous mapping f Z— Y with p of =1 and
H(z) = y, it is necessary and sufficient that

Such a ljfling j, when it exists, is unique.
Proof. The necessity is clear from the functoriality of the fundamental
group, and the uniqueness is a special case of Lemma 11.5. For the
converse, to construct f, given a point w in Z, choose a path
in Z
from z to w, and let u
fo y, which is a path starting at x in X. Define
f(w) to be y*a; that is, f(w) is the endpoint of the path that lifts o•

choice of path.

We must verify that this mapping I is continuous at the point w.
Let N be any neighborhood of f(w) that is evenly covered by p, let
V be the open set in p - '(N) that maps homeomorphically onto N and
that contains f(w), and choose a path-connected neighborhood U of
w so that flU) CN. We need to show that f maps U into V. For all

we can use

Corollary 13.6. Let X be a connected and locally path-connected
space. Letp:
andp': Y' —>X he two covering maps, with Y and
Y' connected and let p(y) = x and p'(y') = x. In order for there to be
an isomorphism between the coverings preserving the base points, it
is necessary and sufficient that
p*(m,(Y,y)) =
Proof. The necessity is clear, and if these subgroups agree, the prop-
osition gives maps p: Y—> Y' and 4i: Y' —* Y preserving the base points
and compatible with projections. (Note that X being locally path-con-
nected implies that covering spaces Y and Y' are also locally path-
connected.) Applying Lemma II .5 to
p and

are isomorphisms.

13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
Exercise 13.7. Show that two connected coverings of such an X are
isomorphic, with an isomorphism that may not preserve base points,
if and only if the images of their fundamental groups are conjugate
subgroups of the fundamental group of X.
A path-connected space X is called simply connected if its funda-
mental group is the trivial group. Note that this is independent of
choice of the base point. In the preceding proposition, if Z is simply
connected, it follows that the liftings f always exist.
Corollary 13.8. A simply connected and locally path-connected space
has only trivial coverings.
Proof. Suppose p: Y—*X is a covering, with X simply connected. Fix
x in X, and for each y Ep'(x) apply the proposition to get a unique
continuous map
X—> Y with
= y and po
the identity on X.
This gives an isomorphism from the trivial covering X Xp'(x) to Y,

Exercise 13.9. Verify that this map is a homeomorphism from the
space X Xp '(x) onto Y.

for the truth of Propositions 13.5 and the two corollaries. Challenge.
Find an example of a path-connected space X with trivial fundamental
group that has a nontrivial connected covering p: Y—>X.
1 3b. Automorphisms of Coverings
Our next goal is to relate the fundamental group of X to the auto-
morphism group of a covering of X. Let p:
be a covering, with
base point y in Y chosen so that p(y) = x, and assume Y is path-con-
nected. We want to make ir1(X,x) act on the left on Y. Given an
element
in 'rr1(X,x) and a point z in Y, we therefore want to define
a point [a] . z in Y. Let y' = y * [a] be the endpoint of the lift of a to
a path that starts at y. Choose a path 'y from y to z in Y. Since
p(y')=p(y)x, and
is a path starting at x, we have a point
y' *(poy) that is the endpoint of the lift of the path poy that starts
at y'. We want to define [a] z to be the pointy' *(po'y). Denote this
point y'*(po'y) temporarily by w(z,a,i):

Equivalently,
Sup-
pose, however, that we chose another path
from y to z. To have
w(z,a,'y')=w(z,u,y), we want the lifts of

that start at y to end at the same point. By Exercise 13.2(b), this is
the case precisely if the class

we need
to be a normal7 subgroup of
'rr1(X, 4. In this case we see that w(z, c, 'y) is independent of choice
of 'y, and depends only on z and the homotopy class [(Ti of c.
Assume then that

above construction determines a mapping

The fact that ([a]
[Ti) . z = [a]
([TI . z) follows readily from the def-
inition. For if y is a path from y to z, then the lift of T' (ponj), starting
at y, is a path from y to [Ti . z. It follows that [a] . ([Ti z) is the end-
point of the lift of the path
(T (poy)) that starts at y. The path

13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
follows from the fact that [sj.z=(y*sj*'y=y*y, andy*y=z by
definition.
To prove that, for fixed [oj, the map ZF—> [a] z is continuous, we
assume in addition that X is locally path-connected. To see the con-
tinuity near a point z, take, as in the preceding proposition, a path-
connected neighborhood N of p(z) that is evenly covered by p. Let V
and V' be the components of p (N) that contain z and z' = [al . z.
We must show that [a] . V is contained in V'. For v in V, let a be a
path from z to v in V. If
y
a
path from y
from which it follows that [al . v is the
endpoint of the lift of poa that starts at z'. This lift is in VI, which
concludes the proof of continuity.
Summarizing, we have constructed a homomorphism from 'rr1(X, 4
to the group Aut(Y/X) of covering transformations. We claim next
that this is surjective. Let p: Y—* Y be a covering transformation, and
suppose p(y)
y'. It suffices to find an element [a] in 'Tr1(X,x) with
Ja] y = y', since, Y being connected, two covering transformations
that agree at one point must be identical. Let y be a path from y to
y'. Let a =p°'y. Then [a]
is the endpoint of the lift of the path a
that starts aty. Since this lift is
as required.
Finally, we compute the kernel of this homomorphism from 'rr1(X, 4
to Aut(Y/X). As in the preceding step, it suffices to see which [a]
act trivially on y, and this happens when the lift of a at y ends at y,
i.e., when [a] is in
Putting this all together, we have
Theorem 13.11. Let p: Y—*X be a covering, with Y connected and
X locally path-connected, and let p(y) = x. if
y)) is a normal
subgroup of rr1(X, 4, then there is a canonical isomorphism
Aut(Y/X).
The covering is a G-covering, with G being the quotient group
ir1(X,
7T1(Y, y)).
The last statement follows from Proposition Il .38. A covering p: Y—>X
is called regular if
is a normal subgroup of 'rr1(X,4.
Exercise 13.12. Still assuming Y connected and X locally path-con-
nected, but without assuming

Exercise 13.13. Show that the following are equivalent (with Y con-
nected and X locally path-connected): (i) the covering is regular;
(ii) the action of Aut(Y/X) on p'(x) is transitive; and (iii)
for every
loop tr at x, if one lifting of r
is closed, then all liftings are closed.
Exercise 13.14. Show that any G-covering p: Y—*X, with Y con-
nected and locally path-connected, is a regular covering.
Corollary 13.15. If p: Y—>X is a covering, with Y simply connected
and X locally path-connected, then ¶1(X, 4 Aut(Y/X).
Corollary 13.16. If a group G acts evenly on a simply connected and
locally path-connected space Y, and X
Y/G is the orbit space, then
the fundamental group of X is isomorphic to G.
In fact, we know by Proposition 11.37 that G is canonically iso-
morphic to the group of automorphisms of Y over X. Choosing a point
y in Y over a point x in X determines an isomorphism of 'rr1(X, x) with
Aut(Y/X)G.
In general, the isomorphism of G with 'w(X, 4 depends on the choice
of base point y, but only up to inner automorphism. In particular, in
case the group is abelian, the isomorphism is independent of choices.
For example, this corollary, applicd to the mapping from l1 to
implies again that rr1(S',x) = /.
Applied to the two-sheeted covering p:
from the sphere
to the projective space, it follows that
'rr1(RP",x) = //2/
for n2,
where x is any point in RPM.
This can be used to give a more conceptual explanation of some-
thing we saw in Chapter 4: if n  2, there can be no continuous map-
ping from S" to S' with g(—P) = —g(P) for all P. Such a map would
define a continuous mapping h:
1W' on quotient spaces:

186
13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
where p': 5'—> 1W' is the corresponding mapping for n = 1. Since
the mapping
must
be trivial. Choosing a point y inS° with p(y) = x, by Proposition 13.5
there is a continuous mapping h from 1W" to 5' so that p' ° h = h and
h(x) = g(y). Now h °p and g are two mappings from 5" to 5' that map
y to g(y), and both, when followed by p', are the map hop. By Lemma
11.5, hop=g. But hop always takes P and —P to the same point,
while g never does. So such g cannot exist.

as in Exercise 11.27. Describe the image of the fundamental group
of the torus in the fundamental group of the Klein bottle, and verify
that it is a normal subgroup.
Exercise 13.18. If p: Y—*X is the three-sheeted covering of Exercise
11.14, show that
is not a normal subgroup of it,(X,x).
In particular, 'rr,(X,x) is not an abelian group.
1 3c. The Universal Covering
In this section we assume that X is a connected and locally path-
connected space. A covering p: Y—>X is called a universal covering
if Y is simply connected. It follows from Corollary 13.6 that such a
covering, if it exists, is unique, and unique up to canonical isomor-
phism if base points are specified. As we have seen, the fundamental
group of X will be isomorphic to the automorphism group of this

13c. The Universal Covenng
187
covering. The aim of this section is to show that, if one additional
property is satisfied, a universal covering always exists.
Suppose we have a universal covering p: Y—÷X. Any point in X
has an evenly covered path-connected neighborhood N. Any loop a
in N lifts to a loop & in Y, and, since Y is simply connected, this loop
is homotopic in Y to a constant path. It follows that the ioop a = p° a
is homotopic to a constant path in X. A space X is called semilocally
simply connected if every point has a neighborhood such that every
loop in the neighborhood is homotopic in X to a constant path. So
being semilocally simply connected is a necessary condition for the
existence of a universal covering. Note that if X is locally simply
connected, i.e., if every neighborhood of a point contains a neigh-
borhood that is simply connected, then X is semilocally simply con-
nected.
The spaces one generally meets, and those we have considered in
this book, are all locally simply connected. Any open set in the plane
or in I?, or any manifold, or any finite graph, is locally simply con-
nected. In fact, one has to work a little to produce spaces that are not
locally simply connected or semilocally simply connected.
Exercise 13.19. For a positive integer n, let C,, be the circle of radius
centered at the point (1
0). Let C C
be the union of all
the circles C,,; C is sometimes called a clamshell. (a) Show that C is
connected and locally path-connected, but not semilocally simply
connected. Let X be the cone over C, i.e., X C W is the union of all
line segments from points in C to the point (0,0, 1). (b) Show that
X is semilocally simply connected but not locally simply connected.
Suppose we have a universal covering p: Y—÷X, with p(y) = x. For
any point z in Y, there is a path
from y to z, which is unique up to

188
13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
homotopy since Y is simply connected. The image a = p° 'y is a path
from x to p(z), unique up to homotopy (with fixed endpoints). Con-
versely, given a path a in X starting at x, it determines a point z = y * a
in Y. This identifies Y, at least as a set, with the set of homotopy
classes of paths in X that start at a given point x. The idea to the proof
of the fol lowing theorem is to use this observation in reverse, by using
these homotopy classes to construct the universal covering.
Theorem 13.20. A connected and locally path-connected space X has
a universal covering if and only if it is semilocally simply connected.
Proof. To construct a universal covering, fix x in X and define X to
be the set of homotopy classes ['1'] of paths
in X that start at x, the
homotopies as usual being required to fix endpotnts. Assigning to
each such class its endsoint defines a function u: X—÷X. Our task is
t2 put a topology on X so that this is a covering map, and show that
X is simply connected.
Call an open set N in X good if N is path-connected, and every
loop in N at a point z in N is homotopic to the constant path
in X.
If
is a path from x to a point z in N, let
be the subset of X
consisting of the homotopy classes

that starts at z. Note that N111 depends only on the homotopy class ['y]

Exercise 13.21. Verify these properties.
Now define a subset C of X to be open if, for any
in C, there
is a good neighborhood N of the endpoint of y with
C C. It fol-
lows from properties (I) and (2) that these open sets form a topology
on X, and that each of these sets
is open, and the projection from
N is continuous. In fact, this projection is a homeomorphism,
the inverse being given by the map that takes w in N to
a], where
a is any path in N from the endpoint of y to w. This is independent
of choice of a, since if a' is another, a and a' are homotopic in X,
so
a is homotopie to
a'. This projection is continuous since for
smaller good N', N' maps to
The map u: X—>X is evenly covered over any good N, since the

13d. Coverings and Subgroups of the
Fundamental Group
The theorem of the preceding section will determine correspondence
between subgroups of the fundamental group and coverings. For the
following proposition, assume that X is connected, locally path-con-
nected, and semilocally simply connected, so that X has a universal
covering.
Proposition 13.23. (a) For every subgroup H of 1T1(X, 4 there is a
connected covering pn: Y11—* X, with a base point Yll E
'(4 so that
the image of
YH) in ir,(X, 4 is H. Any other such covering (with
choice of base point) is canonically isomorphic to this one.
(b) If K is another subgroup of ir,(X, x) containing H, there is a
unique continuous mapping p11K:
YK that maps yH to y,j- and is
compatible with the projections to X. This mapping is a covering map-
ping, and if H is a normal subgroup of K, it is a G-covering with
G=K/H.
Proof. Let u: X—*X bejt universal covering, with u(I) = x, and iden-
tify ir,(X,4 with Aut(X/&). Any subgroup H of ir,(X,x) acts evenly
on X, and the quotient X —> X/H =
makes X the universal coy-

13. The Fundamental Group and Covering Spaces
ering of
The fundamental group of
(with base point
the
imaae of 1) is canonically isomorphic to H. The projection from Y11
to X/ir1(X, 4 = X is a covering, and the image of its fundamental
group in rr1(X,x) is H. If H is contained in K, there is a canonical
map on the orbit spaces X/H—+ X/K. The remaining verifications are
left to the reader, using the results of the preceding section.
LI
As seen in the proof, the covering YH—> X corresponding to H can
be identified with X/H—>X, where H acts on X as a subgroup of
Aut(X/X) = rr1(X, 4. The regular coverings correspond to normal
subgroups H. This means (see Exercise 13.14) that every connected
G-covering p: Y—*X has the form X/H—*X, with
'rr1(X,4/H
Aut(Y/X)
G.
The correspondence of the proposition is similar to that seen in
Galois theory, where subgroups correspond to field extensions, smaller
subgroups corresponding to larger extensions. Here smaller subgroups
of the fundamental group correspond to larger coverings of the space:
X,i
{e}
I
n
H
I
n
K

If H is a normal subgroup of K, then the covering
is a K/H-
covering.
For example, if XS' is a circle, the coverings correspond to
subgroups of ir1(S', (1,0)) = /. The trivial group corresponds to the
universal covering
S', and the subgroups Zn C / correspond to
the n-sheeted covering
S'—>S' considered in §lla. Up to iso-
morphism, these are the only connected coverings of a circle.

ering of X is regular.

the first homology group H1X by Proposition 12.22. It is sometimes
called the universal abelian covering of X. In general a covering is
called ahelian if it is regular with abelian automorphism group.

We saw in Chapter 6 that for open sets in the plane, the homology
class of a closed 1-chain is determined by winding numbers around
points not in the sct. The ncxt exercise shows that this is true for
other nice subsets, but the following problem shows it is not true in
general.

CHAPTER 14
The Van Kampen Theorem
14a. G-Coverings from the Universal Covering
In this section X will denote a connected, locally path-connected, and
connected space, so X has a universal covering,
denoted u: X—÷X. All spaces will have base points, and all maps will
be assumed to take base points to base points. The base point of X
is denoted x, and the base point of X over x is denoted 1.
We have seen in §13d that for every G-covering p: Y—÷X, with Y
connected, and with base point y, there is a surjective homomorphism
of ir,(X,x) onto G. If H is the kernel of this homomorphism, so
G
ii1(X, 4/H, Y is the quotient of X by the action of H, with y the
image of 1. We want to extend this correspondence to G-coverings
that may not be connected. In this case there will only be a homo-
morphism from ir1(X, x) to G, which need not be surjective. Here we
will set up this correspondence between G-coverings and homomor-
phisms directly and rather briefly, omitting some verifications. Other
ways to carry this out, with a more general context for these con-
structions, together with more details about the verifications, are de-
scribed §l6d and §16e.
Suppose p: 'rr1(X, 4
G is a homomorphism from the fundamental
group of X to any group G. We will construct from p a G-covering
together with a base point
iQ
over x. Give G the
discretejopology, so the Cartesian product X X G is a product of cop-
ies of X, one for each element in G. The group 'rr1(X, 4 acts on the
left on X X G by the rule
[ff]'(zXg)
= [c]'zXg'p([c]') = [oj'zXgp([oj)',

14. The Van Kampen Theorem
for
zEX, gEG. Here [uIz is the action of ir1(X,x)
on 7 that was described in §13b, and gp([oj ')is the product in
the group G. Define
to be the quotient of X X G by this action of
'rr1(X, x):
= IXG/ir1(X,x),
and
let
be the image of the point LX e in
Let (z x g) denote
the image in
of thejoint z X g in X X G. Note that, by the above
action of 'rr1(X,x) on X X G, we have, for z in X, g in G, and [crj in
'rr1(X, x),
=
(z X g) to u(z).
The group G acts on
by the formula h
(z X g) = (z x h g), for
h and g in G and z in X. (Note that using the right side of G for the
left action of
frees up
the left side of G for a lefi action of
G!) We claim that this is an even action, making
a G-
covering. To prove
let N be any open set in X over which the
universal covering u: X
X is trivial. By Lemma 11. 18 there is an
isomorphism of u'(N) with the product covering
on
which
acts on the left on the second factor. This gives ho-
meomorphisms
(NXiT1(X,x))XG/7r1(X,x)
NXG,
the latter homeomorphism by ((u X [CI) X g)
u X
(The map
back takes u X g to ((u X e) X g).) These homeomorphisms are com-
patible with the projections to N, and it follows that, over N, the
action of G is even and the covering is a G-covering. Since X is
covered by such open sets N, the same is true for the map
from
to X.
Conversely, suppose p: Y—>X is a G-covering, with a base point y
over x. From this we construct a homomorphism p from 'rr1(X,x) to
G. For each Irl in 'rr1(X,x) the element p(frrj) in G is determined by
the formula
p([(rj)•y = y*cr,
where y * o is the endpoint of the lift of the path cr that starts at y.
We will need two facts about this operation:
(i)
path starting at x;
forgEG,zEp
starting at x.

14a. G-Coverings from the Universal Covering
195
The first of these facts is immediate from the definition. The second
follows from the fact that if
is lifting of y starting at z,
then the
path
Ot 1, is a lifting of
that starts at
The
endpoint of this path, which is (g
z) *
by definition, is g
I), and
since ji(l)=z*y, (ii) follows.
We claim now that the p defined above is a homomorphism. This
is a calculation, using (ii) and (i):
=
= (p(Ioi).y)*T=(y*o.)*T
= y*(u.T)=p([oj.[Tj).y.
Proposition 14.1. The above constructions determine a one-to-one
correspondence between the set of homomorphisms from ir1(X, x) to
the group G and the set of G-coverings with base point, up to iso-
morphism:
Hom(rr1(X, x), G) e
{G-coverings}/isomorphism.
Proof Given a G-covering p: Y—÷X with base points, from which we
constructed a homomorphism p. we must now show that the given
covering is isomorphic to the covering
constructed from p.
To map
Y,
to
Y, and show that orbits
by 'rr(X, x) have the same image. For this we identify the universal
covering X as the space of homotopy classes of paths in X starting
at x. Define a map
= (g.y)*y.
This is easily checked to be continuous. We must check that an equiv-
alent point ([ul
. lvi) X
p([ff]) 5 maps
to the same point. By (i)
and (ii), this point maps to
(g• pUaiiS . (y*(cr. y)) =
p([r])')
. ((y*r)>cy)
=
=
=
(g.y)*ftfl,
as required. Since the map takes the same values on equivalent points,
it gives a mapping from the quotient
to Y, which is a mapping of
covering spaces of X. This is easily checked to be a mapping of G-
coverings, from which it follows that it must be an isomorphism.
Conversely, starting with a homomorphism p, we constructed a G-

14. The Van Kampen Theorem

say
We must verify that
= p. Now for [ul in
ji([a])(iXe) = (ixe)*ff = (i*axe)

= (iXp([rr]))
= p([aj)'(iXe).
This shows that
p(Eoi), which concludes the proof.
Exercise 14.2. If p: Y—>X is the G-covering corresponding to a ho-
momorphism p: ir1(X,x)—>G, and X' is a subspace of X that also has
a universal covering, with x in X', show that the restriction p
—>
of this covering to X' is the G-covering corresponding to the com-
posite homomorphism p°i*, where
ir1(X',x)—>'rr1(X,x) is induced
by the inclusion i of X' in X.
Exercise 14.3. Show that, if base points are ignored, two G-coverings
Y1, and
are isomorphic G-coverings if and only if the homomor-
phisms p and p' are conjugate, i.e., there is some g in G such that
p'([o-J) =
forall
frrjEir1(X,x).
1 4b. Patching Coverings Together
Suppose X is a union of two open sets U and V. A covering of X
restricts to coverings of U and V. which are isomorphic over U fl V.
Conversely, suppose we have coverings
Y1
U and p2: Y2—> V,
and we have an isomorphism of coverings
p1'(U fl ')—+p2'(U fl V)
of U fl V. Then one may patch (or "glue," or "clutch") these together
to get a covering p: Y—> X, together with isomorphisms of coverings
Y1—>jf'(U),
Y
of the disjoint union
Y1 U Y2, by the equivalence relation that identifies a point Yt
in
p1'(UflV) with the point 0(y1) inp2'(Ufl V). (See Appendix A3.)
Since 0 is compatible with maps to X, one gets a mapping p from Y
to X. Since the map from Y1 to Y is a homeomorphism onto its image
f'U, which is open in Y, and similarly Y2 maps homeomorphically
onto p 'V. one sees that the restriction of p to the inverse image of

14c. The Van Kampen Theorem
197
U is isomorphic to Y1 —> U, and the restriction over V is isomorphic
to
V. From this it follows in particular that p is a covering map.
if each of Y1 —> U and Y2—* V is a G-covering, for a fixed group
G, and 0 is an isomorphism of G-coverings, then Y—>X gets a unique
structure of a G-covering in such a way that the maps from Y1 and
Y2 commute with the action of G.
Occasionally the following generalization is useful. Suppose we have
a collection X0 of open sets, a E
whose union is X, and a collec-
tion p0: Y0—>X0 of covering maps. Suppose, for each a and
we
have an isomorphism
of coverings of X0 fl
Assume these are compatible, i.e.,
(1)
is the identity on Y0; and
(2)
Then one can patch these coverings together to obtain a covering
p: Y—>X. One has isomorphisms p0:
of coverings of X0,
such that
=
0p on p0 '(X0
In addition, the space Y is
the union of the open sets p0(Y0).
One constructs Y as the quotient space
Y0/R of the disjoint
union of the Y0 by the equivalence relation determined by the
The assertions about Y and the p0 are general facts about patching
spaces together, as proved in Appendix A3. The map p is determined
by the equations p°p0 =p. on Y0. Since p0 is a homeomorphism of
Y0 onto p '(X0), it follows that p is a covering map.
If each p0:
is a G-covering, with fixed G, and each
is
an isomorphism of G-coverings, then there is a unique action of G
on Y so that each p0 commutes with the action of G, i.e.,
p0(g
. y0)
g p0(y0) for g in G and y0 in Y0. This gives the patched
covering p: Y—*X the structure of a G-covering, so that each p0 is
an isomorphism of G-coverings.
14c. The Van Kampen Theorem
The Van Kampcn theorem describes the fundamental group of a union
of two spaces in terms of the fundamental group of each and of their
intersection, under suitable hypotheses. Let X be a space that is a
union of two open subspaces U and V. Assume that each of the spaces
U, V and their intersection U fl V is path-connected, and let x be a

198
14. The Van Kampen Theorem
point in the intersection. Assume also that all these spaces X, U, V,
and U fl V have universal covering spaces; this is the case, for ex-
ample, if X is locally simply connected. We have a commutative dia-
gram of homomorphisms of fundamental groups:
V
1t1(UnV,x)
2t1(V,x)
The maps are induced by the inclusions of subspaces, and commu-
tativity means that
j2°i2.
We will describe how 'rr(X,x) is determined by the other groups
(and the above maps between them). The description will not be di-
rect, but will be by a universal property. Note that any homomor-
phism h from ir1(X,x) to a group G determines a pair of homomor-
phisms h1h°j1 from 7r1(U,x) to G and h,=hoj, from 'ff1(V,x) to
G; the two homomorphisms h1°i1 and h2°i2 from 'rr(Ufl V,x) to G
determined by these are the same. The Van Kampen theorem says
that m1(X,x) is the "universal" group with this property.

Theorem 14.4 (Seifert—van Kampen). For any homomorphisms
h1:ir1(U,x)—*G
and
h2:'rr1(V,4—>G,
such that h1 °i1 = h2 ° i2, there is a unique homomorphism
h: 7r1(X,x)
G,
such that h°j1=h1 and h°j2h2.
Exercise 14.5. Show that 'rr,(X,x), together with the homomorphisms

14c. The Van Kampen Theorem
199
j' and j2, is determined up to canonical isomorphism by thc universal
property.
Exercise 14.6. Use the universal property to show that ii1(X,x) is
generated by the images of 'rc1((J,x) and -rr1(V,x). Can you prove this
assertion directly?
A version of the Van Kampen theorem was found first by Seifert,
and the theorem is also known as the Seifert—Van Kampen theorem.
The version given here, via universal properties, was given by Fox,
see Crowd! and Fox (1963). The usual proof of the Van Kampen
theorem (without the hypotheses that the spaces all have universal
coverings) is rather technical, and for it we refer to Crowell and Fox
(1963) or Massey (1991). Here we will give a quick proof, due to
Grothendieck (see Godbillon (1971)), using the correspondence be-
tween homomorphisms from fundamental groups to a group G and
G-coverings. The assumptions assure that each of the spaces X, (I,
V, and U fl V has a universal covering space, and that homomor-
phisms from their fundamental groups to a group G correspond to
G-coverings.
in particular, the homomorphisms h1 and h2 determine G-coverings
U and Y2—> V, together with base points
and Y2 over x. The
fact that h1°i1 is equal to h2°i2 means that the restrictions of these
coverings to U fl V are isomorphic G-coverings, and since U fl V is
connected, there is a unique isomorphism between these G-coverings
that maps the base point y1 to the base point
(The uniqueness is
a special case of Exercise II .24.) By the construction of the preceding
section, these two coverings patch together, using this isomorphism
over the intersection. This gives a G-covering Y—÷X that restricts to
the two given G-coverings (and has the same base point). This
G-covering corresponds to a homomorphism h from 7r1(X,x) to G,
and the fact that the restricted coverings agree means precisely that
hoj=h and hoj2=h2.
Corollary 14.7. If U and V are simply connected, then X is simply
connected.
Note the important hypothesis in all these theorems, that all spaces,
including the intersection U fl V. are connected. It does not apply to
the annulus, written as a union of two sets homeomorphic to disks!
Exercise 14.8. ifVis simply connected, show that)1: 'rc(U,x)—> 'rr1(X,x)

200
14. The Van Kampen Theorem
is surjective, with kernel the smallest normal subgroup of 'rr,(X, 4 that
contains the image of i1: 'rr1(UflV, x)—>rr1(U,4.
Corollary 14.9. If U fl V is simply connected, then, for any G,
Hom(ir1(X,x),G) = Hom('rc1(U,4,G) X
This means that 'rr1(X,x) is the free product of 'rr1(U,x) and ir1(V,x).
Exercise 14.10. If U fl V is simply connected, show that the inclusion
mappings j' and 12 are one-to-one.
The following is a useful generalization of Van Kampen's theorem,
which can be used to compute the fundamental group of an increasing
union of spaces, each of whose fundamental groups in known. The
proof is identical to that of the preceding theorem, using the general
patching construction of the preceding section.
Suppose a space X is a union of a family of open subspaces X0,
a E
with the property that the intersection of any two of these
subspaces is in the family. Assume that X and each Xa is path-con-
nected and has a universal covering, and that the intersection of all
the Xa contains a point x. When
is contained in X0 let
be the
map from
to 'rr1(X0,x) determined by the inclusion, and let
j1, be the map from 'it (Xa,X) to 'rr1(X,x) determined by inclusion.
Theorem 14.11. With these hypotheses, ir1(X,x) is the direct limit of
the groups 71i(Xa, 4. That is, for any group G, and any collection of
homomorphisms ha from
4 to G such that
= ha °
when-
ever Xp C Xa, there is a unique homomorphism h from H1(X, 4 to G
such that ha = h of for all a.
The preceding theorem is recovered by taking the family to consist
of U, V, and UflV.
Although this version of Van Kampen's theorem is stated with each
subspace Xa open in X, it can often be applied to subspaces that are
not open. For example, if each Xa is contained in an open set
of
which it
is a deformation retract, with
C Ua whenever
C Xa,
and the hypotheses of Theorem 14. 11 apply to these
then 'rr1(X,x)
is the direct limit of the groups 'rr1(X0,4. This follows from the fact
that each 'rr1(X0,4—> 9T1(Ua,X) is an isomorphism. Without some such
hypotheses, however, the theorem is false. For example, if A and B
are copies of a cone over a clamshell (see Exercise 13.19), joined
together at the one point where all the circles are tangent, then the

14d. Applications: Graphs and Frcc Groups
201
spaces A and B are simply connected, and A fl B is a point, but A U B
is not simply connected. (In fact, A U B is an example of a space that
is not simply connected but which has no nontrivial connected cov-
erings.)
Exercise 14.12. Show if a space X is a union of a family of open
subspaces
such that the intersection of any two sets in the family
is also in the family, then H1X is the direct limit of the groups HiXa.
14d. Applications: Graphs and Free Groups
One simple application of the Van Kampen theorem is a result we
looked at earlier: the n-sphere c is simply connected if n
2. To see
this now, write the sphere as a union of two hemispheres each homeo-
morphic to n-dimensional disks, with the intersection homeomorphie
to 5'. It follows from Corollary 14.7 that the fundamental group of
5fl is trivial. (The assumption n2 is used to confirm that 5"
'
is
connected.)
Consider next a figure 8:
This is the union X of two circles U and V meeting at a point x. Let
y, and '?2 be loops, one around each circle. The fundamental group
of each circle is infinite cyclic, generated by the classes of these loops.
It follows that to give a homomorphism from 'rr,(X,x) to a group G
is the same as specifying arbitrary elements g, and g2 in G: there is
a unique homomorphism from 'rr,(X,x) to G mapping ['y,J to g, and
EY21 to g2. This means that ir,(X,x) is the free group on the generators
fry,] and [Y2].
Exercise 14.13. Let a = fry,] and b = fry2]. Show that every element

where the

The free group on two generators a and b can be constructed di-

14. The Van Kampen Theorem
rectly (and algebraically) as the set of all words of this form, with
products defined by juxtaposition of words, canceling to get a legit-
imate word. It is straightforward (if a little awkward) to show by hand
that this forms a group, and to see that it satisfies the above universal
property. With the use of the Van Kampen theorem, wc can avoid
this, by constructing the free group as the fundamental group of this
figure 8 space.
The free group F,, on n generators a1
is defined similarly:
it is generated by these elements, and, for any group G and any ele-
ments

algebraically using words in these letters, or as a fundamental group:
Exercise 14.14. Verify that the fundamental group of the space ob-
tained by joining n circles at a point is the free group on n generators.
Use this to show that the fundamental group of the complement of n
points in the plane is free on n generators.
Exercise 14.15. Let X be a connected finite graph. (a) Show that, for
any edge between two distinct vertices, X is homotopy equivalent to
the graph obtained by removing the edge and identifying its two end-
points. (b) Show that X is homotopy equivalent to the graph obtained
by joining n circles at a point, where, if the graph has v vertices and
e edges, n = e — v + 1. (c) Show that n is the "connectivity" of the
graph, i.e., the largest number of edges one can remove from the
graph (leaving the vertices), so that what is left remains connected.
One can use this result to give a simple proof of a rather surprising
fact about free groups.
Proposition 14.16. If G is a free group on n generators, and H is a
subgroup of G that has finite index d in G, then H is afree group,
with dn — d + 1 generators.
Proof Take G to be the fundamental group of a connected graph X
that has v vertices and e edges, with n = e — v + 1. For simplicity we

14d. Applications: Graphs and Free Groups
203
assume each edge of X connects two distinct vertices. The subgroup
H corresponds to a connected covering p: Y—>X with d sheets, with
the fundamental group of Y isomorphic to H. It is not hard to verify
that Y is a connected graph. In fact, the d points over each of the
vertices of X can be taken as vertices of Y, and (since a covering is
trivial over an interval), the d components of the inverse image of
each edge are edges of Y. Since Y is a graph, its fundamental group
is free, with
de—dv+l
d(e—v+1)—d+l
dn—d+l
generators.

If U is the plane domain that is the complement of two points, then
U has the figure 8 as a deformation retract. So U has the same fun-
damental group. In particular, this is not an abelian group. For ex-
ample, the path
is not homotopic to a constant path
(although all integrals of all closed 1-forms over this path are trivial).

PART VIII
COHOMOLOGY AND
HOMOLOGY, III
We have seen that coverings of a space can be described by giving
coverings on open sets and patching together the coverings over the
intersections of these open sets. in particular, one can start with trivial
coverings over small open sets, and patch them together, and any
covering arises this way. This process is formalized in Chapter 15,
and the data that describe such coverings made into Cech cohomology
classes. For G-coverings, when G is an abelian group, these classes
form a group which we see is "dual" to the homology group, i.e., it
is isomorphic to the group of homomorphisms from the first homol-
ogy group into G.
This is applied to show that the first De Rham group H'X of an
open set in the plane is isomorphic to the dual Hom(HX,
of the
homology group, which gives the culmination of our experience that
the homology group and the Dc Rham group are measuring the same
thing about X. This allows us to translate results about homology into
corresponding results about cohomology, and in particular to finish
the proof of the Mayer—Vietoris theorem for cohomology. (Another
proof of this fact will be given in the last chapter of this book.)
Chapter 16, which is optional, contains several miscellaneous vari-
ations, applications, and generalities on the same themes, with many
of the details left as exercises. The patching construction is used to
describe the orientation covering of a manifold. The construction of
a covering of a plane domain from a closed I -form, which follows
from the general results of Chapter 15, is carried out here directly
using the language of "germs" of functions; in particular, the coy-

206

erings are seen as graphs of multivalued functions, similar to the polar
coordinate covering of Part 1. We also describe briefly another co-
homology theory.
The last few sections of Chapter 16 generalize the constructions
relating coverings with actions of groups and group homomorphisms
that were used in Chapters 14 and 15. The added generality, while
not needed in this book, may help to make the constructions more
understandable by putting them in their natural context. In addition,
the exercises (with their hints) carry out proofs of general facts about
these constructions, special cases of which were used in Part VII.

CHAPTER 15
Cohomology
15a. Patching Coverings and tech Cohomology
Since a G-covering is locally trivial, it can be constructed by patching
together trivial coverings. In this section we specify exactly what data
are needed to carry this out. First, we need to know what this pasting
data looks like.
Lemma 15.1. If Y X X G—*X is the trivial G-covering, and h: X—÷ G
is any locally constant function, then the mapping
xxg
from Y to Y is an isomorphism of G-coverings, and every isomor-
phism of G-coverings has this form for a unique locally constant func-
tion h.
Proof. It is evident that such a map is continuous and compatible with
left multiplication by G, so it is an isomorphism of G-coverings. Con-
versely, if p:
Y is compatible with left multiplication by G, p
must take each point x X g to x X g h(x) for some h(x) in G. For p
to be continuous, the map r—>h(x) must be locally constant.
U
If p: Y—÷X is
any G-covering, one can
find
a
collection
= {Ua a E
of open sets whose union is X such that the restric-
tion of the covering to each
is a trivial G-covering. Choose iso-
morphisms of G-coverings
Pa Ua<G>P'(Ua).

morphisms

transition isomorphisms have the form xx g—*x x g ga,3(x) for some

G, by the preced-
ing lemma. The collection of these
satisfy three properties:
(i)

(the identity in G) for all a;
(ii)
= (gapi'
for all a, f3; and
The first two of these are obvious, and the last follows from the equa-
tion p'
=
0
A collection {gap} of locally con-
stant functions8 satisfying (i)—(iii) is called a Cech cocycle on GIL with
coefficients in G.
Conversely, given
and a Cech cocycle {g0,3} on GIL with coeffi-
cients in G, one can use it as "gluing data" to construct a G-covering,
together with a trivialization over each (Jo, so that the resulting co-
cycle is the given one. To do this, take the disjoint union of all the
products U0 x G (where G has the discrete topology, i.e., its points
are open), and define an equivalence relation by defining x x g in
x G to be equivalent
in U,3X G forx in U0fl (1,3.
Properties (i)—(iii) guarantee precisely that this is an equivalence re-
lation. Define Y to be the set of equivalence classes, with the quotient
topology. Since the equivalence relation is compatible with left mul-
tiplication by G and with the projections to X, the space Y gets an
action of G and a projection p from V to X so that the resulting maps
x G—* Y are G-maps and compatible with the maps to X. In other
words, this is the patching described in § 14b, using the transition
functions *,3a, where 'O,30(x X g) = x x g g0,3(x).
The cocycle is not uniquely determined by the G-covering, even
with a fixed choice of Gil, since it depends on the choice of triviali-
zations p0. But if {p0'} is another choice of trivializations, using the
lemma again, there is for each a a unique locally constant function

the equivalence classes are called Cech cohomology classes on Gil with

Exercise 15.2. Verify that the G-coverings constructed from coho-
mologous cocycles are isomorphic.
Exercise 15.3. Let 611 be a covering of an annulus by three sets ho-
meomorphic to disks, as shown:
For g in G let c(g) be the cocycle determined by setting g12 = g23 = e
and g31 = g. (a) Show that every Cech cocycle on 611 with coefficients
in G is cohomologous to such a cocycle, and show that c(g) is co-
homologous to c(g') if and only if g and g' are conjugate in G. This
gives a bijection between the set of conjugacy classes in G and H'(Gil; G).
(b) If G is cyclic of prime order, show that the coverings correspond-
ing to any two distinct elements that are not the identity in G are
isomorphic as coverings, but not as G-coverings.

210
15. Cohomology
What we have done in this section amounts to setting up a one-to-
one correspondence between H'(QL; G) and
{G-coverings of X that are trivial over each
If the
are chosen to be simple open sets like disks or rectangles,
or any simply connected and locally path-connected open sets, then
every covering is trivial over them (by Corollary 13.8), so we will
have all G-coverings of X classified by Cech cohomology classes.
Thus we have:
Proposition 15.4. If each Uc, is simply connected and locally path-
connected, then the set of G-coverings of X, up to isomorphism, is
in one-to-one correspondence with the Cech cohomology set H '(6t1; G).
Now suppose X is a connected space that has a universal covering.
From Exercise 14.3 we know that the set of G-coverings up to iso-
morphism is in one-to-one correspondence with the set of homomor-
phisms from ir1(X,x) to G, up to conjugacy. Putting this together,
and continuing to assume that the open sets in
are simply con-
nected, we have
Corollary 15.5. With these assumptions, there is a bijection
H'çkt; G)
Hom(7r1(X, x), G)/conjugacy.
15b. tech Cohomology and Homology
If we want to have a well-defined homomorphism from 'rr1(X,x) to
G, not just up to conjugacy, we know that we must consider coverings
Y—>X together with a base point y in Y over x. To do this with the
patching, for those open sets Ua that contain x, fix the local trivial-
izations pa: Ua X
so that pa(' X e) = y. The correspond-
ing cocycle then has
= e whenever x is in
fl
another
cocycle defines an isomorphic covering preserving base points when
it is of the form (he)'
with
Un—> G locally constant with
the restriction that ha(x) = e whenever x is in Ua. Such equivalence
classes form a set we can denote by H1(61L,x;G). This sets up bijec-
tions
H'(°lL, x; G)

*-> HomQir1(X,x),G).

15b. tech Cohomology and Homology
211
We will need a prescription to make the homomorphism p from
'ri-1(X,x) to G explicit, when the covering is given as above by a co-
cycle. As one should expect, the answer is the product of values of
the transition functions as one moves around a path, just as the wind-
ing number is the sum of changes in angle. If y is a loop at x, sub-

Now we specialize to the ease where G is an abelian group. In this

tator aba'b1 in 'rr1(X,x) to the identity of G, so it must define a

homomorphism on the abelian quotient group rr1(X, X)ahcI. By Prop-
osition 12.22, we have an isomorphism 'rrl(X,x)ahel
H1X. And con-
jugate homomorphisms to an abelian group must be equal. Putting all
this together, and assuming X and
are as in Proposition 15.4, we
have:
Corollary 15.7 (Hurewicz). if G is abelian, there are canonical bi-
jections
e Hom(rr1(X,x),G) e
-> Hom(ir1(X,x)/['rr1(X,x), 'rri(X,x)I, G)
Hom(H1X,G).
For a spacc X that may not be connected, we have:
Corollary 15.8. If X is a locally simply connected space, and °U is
a collection of simply connected open sets whose union is X, then
there are canonical hijections
H1(°lL;G) e->
Hom(H1X,G).
Proof. To give a G-covering of X is the same as giving a G-covering
of each connected component of X, and to give a homomorphism
from H1X to G is the same as giving a homomorphism from the first
homology group of each connected component of X to G. So the re-
sult follows from Corollary 15.7.

han, H'(GtL;G) has no natural group structure, see Exercise 15.3.) If
G is abelian, give Hom(H, G) the structure of an abehian group, for
any group H. Show that the bijections of Corollary 15.7 are iso-
morphisms of abehian groups.
Exercise 15.10. Define the 0th tech group H°(°1L; G) for an open
covering 61L of a space X with coefficients in a group by defining a
class (or cocycle—there is no equivalence relation) to be a collection
of locally constant functions

tions.
I 5c. De Rham Cohomology and Homology
We want to compare the Dc Rham group H'X with the first homology
group H1X, when X is an open set in the plane. If to is a closed 1-form,
and
a closed 1-chain, we defined the integral
in Chapter 9. For
fixed to, this map
F—>
is a homomorphism from the group Z1X
of closed I-chains to It Proposition 9. 11 says that this integral is the
same for homologous 1-chains. In other words, the map vanishes on
1-boundaries B1X, and therefore defines a homomorphism from H1X
to It Let us denote this homomorphism, at least temporarily, by
so that w(AI1])
The set Hom(H1X,
of homomorphisms from H1X to
has a nat-
ural structure of vector space: the sum p + 4i of two homomorphisms
is defined by (p + ifr)(['y])
p([y]) +
and multiplication of p
by a scalar r by
p)(fry]) =
p([y]). (Note that this works for any
group in place of H1X.) The above map that assigns pt,, to the closed
I -form to is a linear mapping of vector spaces
{closed 1-forms onX} —>
This follows from the equation

r1to +
r-,to2. If
the 1-form to is exact, the homomorphism
is zero. In fact, if to = df,
and
is any 1-chain, with boundary

It follows that the above mapping vanishes on the subspace of exact
1-forms, so it defines a linear map on the quotient space H'X. That
is, we have a natural linear map of vector spaces
H'X
[to] t>
If a E H'X and a E H1X, we may write simply faa in place of
where to is a representative of a and 'y a representative of a. The goal
of this section is to show that this mapping is always an isomorphism.

214
15. Cohomology
Theorem 15.11. If X is an open set in the plane, then the canonical
homomorphism
H'X —* Hom(H1X, R)
is an isomorphism.
The fact that this map is one-to-one is not hard to see, for if a closed
1-form w has all integrals 57 w vanishing for all closed paths 'y on X,
we know from Proposition 1 .8 that w is exact. The fact that every
homomorphism comes from a I-form, however, will take some work.
As a warm-up you may consider the special case:
Exercise 15.12. Show that the homomorphism H'X—> Hom(111X, R)
is an isomorphism when X is multiply connected.
Exercise 15.13. Show that, if U is an open subset of X, the diagram
H'X
>
H'U
'LI
Hom(H1X, R)
' llom(H1 U, R)
commutes, where the map on the bottom is determined by the map
from I-lU to H1X.
In order to prove the theorem, we specialize the results of §15b to
the case where G = R is the additive group of real numbers, and X
is an open set in the plane. Let Oil = {U0: a E
be a collection of
open rectangles whose union is X. We may find such a collection so
that any point in X is contained in only finitely many Ua (see Lemma
A.20 and Lemma 24. 10). By Corollary 15.8 we have a bijection be-
tween Hom(H1X, 11) and H'flt; ff1). To prove the theorem we will con-
struct a map from H'(°tL; R) to the De Rham group H'X, and then
show that all these maps are compatible and isomorphisms.
An element of H'(°lL; 11) is determined by a Cech cocycle
where the
are locally constant functions on
fl (4. We want to
produce from this a closed I-form w on X, well defined up to the
addition of an exact I-form. If we can find some
functionsfa on
so thatf.
=
on Ua fl (4, then dfa =
on the overlaps, so
there is a unique I-form w on U that is dfa on each Ua. This will be
the I -form we are after. The existence of such functions it follows
from a general lemma:
Lemma 15.14. Let {fap} he a collection of

satisfying the cocycle conditions: (i) faa = 0; (ii)

lay =fafl
on Ga fl
fl U,,. Then there are
on Ua,
for all a, such that
famf13=far3
on
UaflU13.
Proof. In order to solve these equations Ia —113 =fa13' we use the ex-
istence of a partition of unity subordinate to the covering Qt (Appen-
dix B2). This says there are
functions Pa on X, with the closure
of the support of

'Pa nonzero in a neighborhood of any point, and with
a
a cc function ha13 on Ua by the formula
h

onUaflU13,
aJ3 —
On Ua\Uafl LI13.
Now set fa>213ha13. It is an easy exercise to verify that ha13 andfa
are cc functions. To complete the proof, we calculate:
Ia
= E ('Pyfay — 'P,,fpy) = >
('py(fay
f13,,)
=
= lfa13fap.
We must verify that the construction made before the lemma gives
a well-defined map from H'flt;
to H'X. Suppose first that {fa'} is
another collection of functions, with Ia' on
such that fa'
=
on Uafl U13, giving rise to the I-form of that is dfa' on Ua. The
functions fa'
fa on
agree on the overlaps, so define a functionf
on X; and to' — to = df, so to' and to define the same element of H'X.
We must also show that if {g,,131} is a Cech cocycle that is cohomolo-
gous to
then they determine the same class in H'X. We are
given locally constant functions ha on
such that

Uafl U13, then(fa — ha)(f13h13fr gao' on Ga hhulp,
and since each ha is locally constant, d(fa — ha) = dfa, so they define

We want to show that all of these maps are bijections, and that
going once clockwise around the diagram, starting at any place, is
the identity map on that vector space. We have proved that the top

show that a trip around the diagram, starting with an element p in
Hom(H1X, li), takes p to itself. Let

15d. Proof of Mayer—Vietoris for
De Rham Cohomology
Now that we have explicitly identified the Dc Rham cohomology group
with the dual of the homology group, we can finish the proof of the
Mayer—Vietoris theorem stated in §lOd for the De Rham groups. What
was missing is the assertion MV(vi) that the map denoted "—" from

that takes a pair (a,
to the homomorphism that takes a pair (a, b)
in H1(U)EEIH1(V) to faa + lb
It is a simple exercise to verify, using
Theorem 15. 11, that this map is also an isomorphism.
The homomorphism "—" from I-1((] fl V) to H1UEE?,'-11V determines
a homomorphism
Hom(H1(Ufl V)jl),
and it is a general fact, proved in Appendix C (Lemma C. 10), that,
since the map that determines it is one-to-one, this map is surjective.
Consider the diagram

where the maps are as just described. We know that each of the ver-
tical maps is an isomorphism, and that the bottom horizontal map is
surjective. It follows that the top horizontal map is also surjective,
which is the assertion to be proved, provided we check that the dia-
gram commutes. But this is entirely straightforward. Given a class

to, and can be deduced from, the Mayer—Vietoris sequence in ho-

16a. The Orientation Covering
Every manifold M has a canonical two-sheeted covering p:
called the orientation covering, whose fiber over a point P is the two
ways to orient M at P. Cech cocycles providc a convenient way to
construct this covering. Let G = {± l} be the group of order two, and
take an open covering GIL = {Ua} of M to be images of the coordinate
charts
C Al, with
open in I?. The Jacobian determi-
nant of the change of coordinates from

sign, which gives a locally constant function from
to {±i}.
The chain rule for Jacobians implies that this is a cocycle. Define
p:

16b. Coverings from i-Forms
From Corollary 15.7 and Theorem 15.11 we have a canonical bijec-
tion
It follows that there is an
X
a closed 1-form w on X, with two 1-forms
giving isomorphic coverings when their difference is exact. To con-
struct this covering, following the procedure given in § l5c, one takes
a collection °U of open sets Ua on each of which w =
for some
functionfa, and then uses the transition functions
fa
to patch
together trivial R-coverings of each
into a global ftk-covering of
X. In this section we dcscribe a more direct way to construct this
covering.
The idea is to put all graphs of functions f on open subsets of X
such that df
w together into one big covering space. A good lan-
guage for describing this is that of germs. A germ of a t' function
at a point P in X is an equivalence class of
functions defined in
neighborhoods of P. Two functions f' on a neighborhood N1 and 12
on N2 are defined to be equivalent if there is a neighborhood N of P
contained in N1 flN2 such thatf1 andf2 are equal on N.
These germs can be added, multiplied, and differentiated, just like
functions on definite open sets.
Exercise 16.3. Verify that this is an equivalence relation, and that
these operations preserve equivalence classes.
A germ at P has a value at P (the valuef(P) of any representative
f), but it does not have a value at any other point. The idea is simply
that we only care about functions near the point P. and we allow
ourselves to shrink the neighborhoods arbitrarily. Given a functionf

16b. Coverings from 1-Forms
221
on a neighborhood of P, the equivalence class containing it is called
the germ defined by fat P.
Since derivatives of germs make sense, it makes sense to say that
the differential of a germ at a point is a given 1-form; if the I-form
is to =pdx + qdy, the differential of a germ off at P is to if
—(P)=p(P)
and —(P)q(P).
Bx
By
If to is a closed 1-form on X, define
to be the set of all germs of
functions at points of X whose differential is to. We will make this
into a topological space, so that the map
that takes a germ
to the point at which it is a germ, is a covering map. For each open
set N in X and function f on N such that df= to on N, define a basic
open set N1 in
N1 = {germs at points of N defined byf}.
A set in X,, is defined to be open if it is a union of basic sets N1.
If N is an open set in X such that to is exact on N (for example,
any open disk or rectangle in X), then
is a disjoint union of
the open sets N1, where f runs through all functions on N whose dif-
ferential is to. The point is that if f is one such function, then all
others, on N or on any open subset of N, are of the form f+ c for
some locally constant function c. This shows that the covering is triv-
ial over N, and, since any point in X has such neighborhoods, this
shows that we have a covering space:
p0
—> X.
In addition, this is an R-covering. The action of a real number on Xi,,
takes a germ to the sum of the germ and the real number. The pre-
ceding discussion shows that this is an even action of R on
and
that the covering is an l1-covering.
Exercise 16.4. Verify that when X=W\{(O,O)} and to=dtI, then
the polar coordinate covering of X is a connected component of Xi,,.
Choosing any function f on any connected open subset N of X with
df
to on N determines a connected component of
Namely, this
is the connected component containing the open set Nf.
Exercise 16.5. Show that this component is the union of all open sets
of the form

In general, there is a natural bijection between
X
a
the pair P X r, where r is the value
of the germ at P. If R is has its usual topology, this bijection is con-
tinuous, but it is not a homeomorphism. In the polar coordinate ex-
ample, each connected component of
maps to a closed submani-
fold of the product X X
these are the graphs of the multivalued
functions "0 + c." In general, however, this need not be the case.
Problem 6.22 shows that, when X is the complement of two points
P and Q, and w is a linear combination

with r/s irra-
tional, the sheets of a component of

together, if regarded as a subset of X X It With this understanding,

w, as -y varies over loops at x
(or equivalently, closed 1-chains on X).
I 6c. Another Cohomology Group
In addition to the Dc Rham and tech cohomology groups, there are
cohomology groups H°(X; G) and H'(X; G) that one can assign to any
topological space X, where G can be any abelian group. Lacking smooth
functions and I-forms to evaluate on points and paths, one makes
these groups directly out of objects that are defined by their values
on points and paths. Define a 0-cochain to be an arbitrary function
from X to G. Define a l-cochain to be a function from the set of all
continuous paths on X to G, with the requirement that the function
takes all constant paths to the identity element 0 in G. Note that,
unlike the case of 0-chains or I-chains, cochains can assign nonzero

16c. Another Cohomology Group
223
elements of G to arbitrarily many elements. Since the set of functions
from any set to an abelian group G is an abelian group (by adding
the values in G), the 0-cochains form a group denoted C°(X; G), and
the l-cochains form a group C'(X;G).
If a:X—+G is a 0-cochain, define the coboundary ba to be the
l-eochain whose value on a path
is a('y( I)) —
Define the
0th cohomology group H°(X; G) be the set of 0-cochains whose boundary
is zero.
Exercise 16.8. Show that giving an element of FJ°(X; G) is equivalent
to giving a function from the set of path-connected components of X
to G. Deduce an isomorphism H°(X; G)
G).
If c is a 1-cochain, it defines a homomorphism from the 1-chains
C1X to G by the formula
c is called
a l-cocycle if c(8F) = 0 for all continuous 1: [0, 1] x [0, 11—>X. The
1-cocycles form a subgroup Z'(X; G) of C'(X; G). Every coboundary
Sa
is a 1-cocycle, so the 1-coboundaries form a subgroup B'(X;G) of
Z'(X; G). The quotient group is the first cohomology group
I-I'(X;G) = Z'(X;G)/B'(X;G).
There is a natural homomorphism from H'(X;G) to Hom(X1X,G),
that takes the class of a 1-cocycle c to the homomorphism that takes
the homology class of a 1-cycle 'y to the element cCy).
Exercise 16.9. Verify that this is a well-defined homomorphism.
Proposition 16.10. The homomorphism H'(X;G)—>Hom(H1X,G) is
an isomorphism.
Proof. To give a homomorphism from H1X = Z1X/B1X to G is equiv-
alent to giving a homomorphism from Z1X to G that vanishes on B1X;
that is,
Hom(111X, G) =
Kernel(Hom(Z1X, G)—> Hom(81X, G)).
We have homomorphisms
B'(X;G) —> Z'(X;G) —* Hom(Z1X,G)
—> Hom(81X,G),
where the middle map takes the cocycle c to the homomorphism
ny—* c("y). The assertion of the proposition is easily seen to be equiv-
alent to the assertion that this sequence is exact at the two middle
groups.
The fact that the image of each map is contained in the next is the

we need to choose arbitrarily a point xa in each path component

the chosen point Xa of the component containing y and ending at )).
Suppose c in Z'(X; G) maps to the zero homomorphism from Z,X

the 0-chain a by the formula a(y) = cQrj. We claim that (ba)('y) = c(y)

16d. G-Sets and Coverings
In this section and the next we describe two general constructions,
which may help to put the constructions of § 14a in context. The ex-
ercises verify the assertions made about these constructions.
Let p: Y—÷X = Y/G be a G-covering, without base point for the
moment. Suppose T is any set, and we have a left action of G on T;
we say that T is a G-sei. Give T the discrete topology, so an action
of G on T is a mapping from G X Tto Tsatisfying properties (I) and
(2) of §llc. The group G acts on the left on Y X T by the formula
Define YTto be the space of orbits:
= (YXT)/G.
Write Ky x t) in YT for the orbit containing y X t. Let PT: Yr—>X be
the mapping that sends Ky x t) to p(y).
Exercise 16.13. Show that the
YT—>X is a covering map.
If T and T are sets with G-actions, a map of G-sets is a function
p: T—>T such that
for all tin Tand gin G. A map
of G-sets is an isomorphism if it is bijective, so there is an inverse
mapping of G-sets from T' to T. A map p: T—> T of G-sets deter-
mines a continuous mapping from Y>( T to Y X T', taking y x t to
y X p(t). This is compatible with the actions of G, so it determines a
continuous mapping from YT to Yr, taking Ky X t) to Ky X &p(t)), which
commutes with the projections to X. If p is an isomorphism, this is
an isomorphism of coverings. Conversely, we have:
Exercise 16.14. Letp: Y—>XY/G be a G-covering, with Y con-
nected. Show that the two G-sets determine isomorphic coverings of
X if and only if the G-sets are isomorphic. Show in fact that any
continuous mapping f from YT to

to X comes from a map of G-sets from T to V.

Exercise 16.15. If T—* T' and T'—> T" are maps of G-sets, show that
the composite of
and Y,—> Yr is the mapping determined by
the composite T—*T".
Suppose the action of G on a set T is transitive: for any
and t2
in T, there is some g in G such that g
t1
t2. If a point t is chosen,
let H C G be the subgroup of elements of G that
fix t, i.e.,
H = {g C G: g t = t}. Then the G-set G/H of left cosets is isomorphic
to the G-set T, by mapping the coset gH containing g to the point
gOt.
Exercise 16.16. Show that two transitive G-sets are isomorphic if and
only if the corresponding subgroups of G are conjugate.
In Exercise 11 .27 we saw how a subgroup H of G determines a
covering Y/H—*X.
Exercise 16.17. If T G/H is a set of left cosets, show that the cov-
ering
is isomorphic to the covering Y/H—>X.
Exercise 16.18. If T is a disjoint union of G-sets Ta, show that the
covering Y1—>X
is a disjoint union of the coverings
An arbitrary G-set T is a disjoint union of its orbits Ta. By the
preceding exercises the corresponding covering Y1 —> X is a disjoint
union of coverings of the form Y/HCX, for Ha subgroups of G.
Now suppose X is connected and locally path-connected, and has
a universal covering space X
X. Choose a point i of X lying over
x in X. We have seen that, with these choices, the universal covering
is a 'rr1(X,x)-covering. So ever1 action of the fundamental group on
a set T determines a covering XT—>X. Combining what we have just
proved with Proposition 13.23, we have:
Proposition 16.19. Every covering of X is isomorphic to one obtained
from the universal covering X —' X by a left action of ir1(X, x) on some
set T. This covering is connected if and only if the action on T is
transitive. Two such coverings are isomorphic if and only if the ir1(X, x)-
sets are isomorphic.
A left action of a group G on a set T is the same as a homomor-
phism of G to the group Aut(T) of permutations of T. Two such
homomorphisms give isomorphic G-sets exactly when the homo-

Suppose p: Y—>X is a G-covering, and '4i: G—*G' is any homomor-
phism of groups. If we make G' into a left G-set, the construction of
the preceding section can be used to construct a covering of X that is
locally a product Xx G'—>X. We want to do this in such a way that
this covering can be made into a G'-covering. The simplest way to
make G' into a left G-set is by defining, for g in G and g' in G',
to be 4r(g)g', the latter using the group product in G'. How-
ever, we will use anothcr, which will allow us to define a compatible
left action of G' on the result. Define the left action of G on G' by

It is straightforward to check that this is a left action of G on G'.

base points are taken into account, the coverings Y(41) and Y(tfr,) are
isomorphic if and only if

1412 are equal. Without base points,
they are isomorphic if and only if

229
In our definition of Cech cohomology Ht5tL; G) there has been no
topology on the group G, or, more accurately, we have equipped G
with the discretc topology. Cech cohomology is also important when
G is a group with a more interesting topology. One can define a set
H'(°tt; G) the same way, requiring the functions
and
in the def-
inition to be continuous maps from
a cocycle
one constructs in the same way a (principal) G-
bundle, i.e., a space Y, on which G acts continuously, with a mapping
p:
so that p(g . y) = p(y), locally isomorphic to the projection
X X G—>X (but in this product G is a topological space, not neces-
sadly discrete).
If the topological group G acts continuously on the left on a space
V, then a G-bundle determines a bundle with fiber V. The construction
is as in the discrete case: take trivial coverings Ua X V. and glue them
together using the identifications from Ua X V to
X V over
fl
by x X
X
v; or one may construct the quotient (Y X V)/G.
The fundamental example is the case G =
R (with its usual to-
pology as an open subset of W), with V = W, and the resulting bun-
dle is called a vector bundle of rank n.

morphism. Equivalently, giving a line bundle is equivalent to giving
a two-sheeted covering. Prove this directly. Compute this group for
U an annulus. Over a circle in the annulus you should find two line
bundles, corresponding to a cylinder and a Moebius band.

PART IX
TOPOLOGY OF SURFACES
The goal is to extend what we have done for open sets in the plane
to open sets in surfaces, especially compact orientable surfaces. Some
of this is straightforward generalization, valid for any surface, given
basic notions about coordinate charts, but there are some new features
that are special to the compact and orientable case.
We show that every compact orientable surface is homeomorphic
to a sphere with g handles, at least under the assumption that the
surface can be triangulated. Any such surface can be realized by tak-
ing a convex polygon with 4g sides, and making suitable identifica-
tions on the boundary. From this description it is routine to compute
the fundamental group and first homology group.
In Chapter 18 we show that for any differentiable surface X, there
is a canonical isomorphism between the De Rham group H'X of closed
mod exact 1-forms, and the dual group Hom(H1X,
to the homology
group. This leads to a definition and calculation of an intersection
pairing on the homology group H1X.
Note: A surface is assumed to be connected unless otherwise stated.
See Appendix D for foundational facts about surfaces.


CHAPTER 17
The Topology of Surfaces
17a. Triangulation and Polygons
with Sides Identified
Our aim in this section is to show that a compact orientable surface
is homeomorphic to a sphere with handles, under the assumption that
the surface can be triangulated. The idea is to "flatten" it out, to
realize the surface as a polygon in the plane, with certain identifi-
cations on the boundary edges, and then, by cutting and pasting, to
simplify these realizations until we can recognize the result.
A triangulation of a compact surface X has a finite number J' of
faces, each of which is a subset of X homeomorphie to an ordinary
(closed) triangle in the plane, with three edges homeomorphie to closed
intervals, and three vertices that are points. Two edges can meet only
at a vertex, and two faces meet only at one vertex or exactly along
a common edge; in the latter ease the faces are called adjacent. There
are many choices for such homeomorphisms between plane triangles
and faces of the triangulation. In order to be able to compare the
homeomorphisms on adjacent faces in X, we first choose a homeo-
morphism of each edge on X with the interval JO, Ii. We can then
find homeomorphisms of each face on X with a plane triangle so that,
on the edges, the maps are those determined by these homeomorphisms:
233

234
17. The Topology of Surfaces
(1-t)P+tQ
If two triangles correspond to adjacent faces, this means that there-
suiting homeomorphism between corresponding sides
and P'Q'
is given by the "affine" map (I — t)P + tQ'—>(l — t)P' + tQ'. When
we identify sides of polygons, it will always be by such affine homeo-
morphisms, so there will be no ambiguity in the results.
An orientation of X determines a counterclockwise direction around
the boundary of each triangle, with adjacent triangles determining op-
posite directions along their common edge:
Choose one face
in the triangulation, and choose a homeomor-
phism of
with a plane triangle H1 = T1, with counterclockwise ori-
entation. Choose a face r2 adjacent to

phism along their common edge to a homeomorphism of 'r2 with a

Choose T2 so the union of T1 and T2 is a convex quadrilateral 112.
This gives a homeomorphism from 'F1 U T2 to H2. Now choose
ad-
jacent to 'r1 or T2 (if
is adjacent to both, choose one of them ar-
bitrarily), and extend the map from the common edge of T3 and the
(chosen)
or 'r2 to a homeomorphism from 'r3 to a triangle T3 adjacent
to the corresponding side of H2. Let 113 be the resulting five-sided
polygon, which we can take to be convex:

The arrows indicate the identification made in the map from the
figure on the right onto that on the left. Continue in this way, until
all f of the faces have been used. We then have a convex polygon
111= II withf+ 2 sides. Each side of H will correspond to a common
edge of two faces on X, and each edge occurring this way will cor-
respond to two such sides of H. Thus the sides of 11 will be paired
off, and we have a continuous map from II to X that realizes X as a
quotient space of II, obtained by identifying corresponding points on
corresponding sides. Note that, when traveling around H in a coun-
terclockwise direction, one travels along two corresponding sides in
opposite directions.
This realization of X as an identification space of a polygon is half
way to our goal. The data used in constructing X from the polygon
can be encoded by taking an alphabet with m letters, with m = '/2(f+ 2),
and writing down a sequence of 2m symbols, each of which is a letter
a in the alphabet, or its "inverse" a', with each of these symbols
occurring just once. For example, the space constructed by making
the identifications indicated in the following diagram

Exercise 17.1. Show that this code represents a torus.
Exercise 17.2. If the number of sides is four, show that X is homeo-
morphic to a sphere or a torus.
There is a good deal of arbitrariness in the choice of polygon and
its code, even for a given triangulation and ordered choice of faces
of X. The polygon can certainly be replaced by any other convex
polygon with the same number of sides. (For simplicity, one may use
a regular polygon.) Of course, even when the polygon and the iden-
tifications are fixed, the choice of alphabet is arbitrary, as is the choice
of which of a pair of corresponding sides is written as a letter a of
the alphabet and which as if'. In addition, the place where one starts
listing the sides is arbitrary, and the code can therefore by cyclically
permuted. Note that the identifications are made by identifying cor-
responding points on corresponding sides; some vertices of LI may
become identified by this, and others may not.
17b. Classification of Compact Oriented Surfaces
For the rest of the argument we do not need the triangulation, but
only this description as a polygon with sides identified according to
a code. We want to prescribe some rules for simplifying a polygonal
presentation of a surface. We proceed in several steps. By Exercise
17.2 we can assume the polygon has 2m sides, with m  3.
Step I. If a letter a and its inverse if
1 occur successively in the code,
they can both be omitted. That is, X is homeomorphic to the surface
obtained from a convex polygon with 2m — 2 sides, using the same
code in the same order but with a and if' omitted. This can be seen
from the pictures

1 7b. Classification of Compact Oriented Surfaces
237
D::
The point is that if one first carries out the identification of a with
a', one gets a space homeomorphic to a convcx polygon, so that the
remaining identifications are prescribed by the code with a and a
omitted.
Step 2. It can be assumed that all the vertices of the polygon map to
the same point of X. To show this, it suffices, if not all the vertices
have the same image, to show how to increase by one the number of
vertices mapping to a given point x, without changing the total num-
ber of vertices. There is a side, say labeled a, that joins two vertices,
one of which is mapped to x and the other to a point y not equal to
x. Let
be the side of H adjacent to a at the point mapping to y.
Draw the diagonal
as shown on the polygon, and cut off the triangle
formed by a, J3, and
and attach it to the polygon by identifying f3
with
The surface X is the identification space of this new polygon, and it
has the same number of sides, but one more vertex mapping to x.
Step 3. By steps 1 and 2 we may assume that all vertices map to the
same point x in X, and that no edge is adjacent to its inverse. We
claim next that for any edge a there must be an edge
lying between
a and a' so that f3' lies between a' and a; that is, in a code, after
cyclically permuting if necessary, they occur in the order
If not, we could construct the identification space X by first identi-

238
17. The Topology of Surfaces
fying a with a', and then separately doing all the identification pre-
scribed by edges lying (counterclockwise) between a and a', and
those prescribed by edges lying (counterclockwise) between a' and
a. The two endpoints of a never get identified in this process, con-
tradicting the assumption that all the vertices map to the same point
of X.
Now we simplify the code as follows: Choose an edge a, and take
an edge
so that the edges a,
a
, and
occur in this order,
but perhaps with other edges in between some of these (denoted A,
B, C, and D in the following diagram). Perform the following se-

This gives a new polygon with the same properties and the same num-
ber of vertices, which also represents X, but now it has a successive
sequence
f'. in addition, if other such sequences occurred
elsewhere in the polygon (i.e., in one of the parts labeled A, B, C,
or D), such sequences are not disturbed by this procedure. So we may
continue this process, until we have represented X as a polygon with

17c. The Fundamental Group of a Surface
The normal form representation of a compact orientable surface X as
a 4g-sided polygon II with sides identified according to the code (17.3)
can be used to compute the fundamental group of X. Let x be the
point in X that is the image of the vertices in II, and let a1 and ft be
the loops in X that arc the images of the corresponding sides of fl.
Let F2g be the free group on 2g generators a1, b1,
.
.
.
,
/3g.
There is a homomorphism of groups from F2g to the fundamental group
'rr1(X,x) that takes a1 to a1 and b1 to ft for
I
We claim first
that the element
in F2g maps to thc identity element of ir1(X, x) by this homomorphism.
In fact, the product path
is homotopic to the constant path at x, since thc corresponding path
around the sides of LI is homotopic to a constant path in H (since 11
is convex), and composition with the continuous map from 11 to X
gives a homotopy in X.
Let Ng be the least normal subgroup of E2g containing Cg, i.e., Ng
is the subgroup generated by all elements of the form u ' 'u' for
all u in F2g. From what we have just seen, Ng is in the kernel of the
homomorphism from F2g to i'r1(X,x), so we have a homomorphism
F2g/Ng _4
'rr1(X,4.
Proposition 17.6. This homomorphism
n1(X, 4 is an iso-
morphism.
Proof. We will apply the Van Kampen theorem. Let U be the image
in X of the complement of a small disk in the middle of H, and let
V be the image in X of an open set that contains this disk as shown:

I 7c. The Fundamental Group of a Surface

Let K be the image of the boundary of 11 in X. This K
is a graph
that consists of 2g loops at x, so 'Tr1(K,x)
is the free group on gen-
eratorsa, h, .
.
.
,
i.e.,
By radial projection
from the center of the disk, one sees that K is a deformation retract
of U. We therefore have an isomorphism
'rr1(U,x)
so 'rr(U,x) is also the free group
on the same generators. Now V
is homeomorphic to a disk, so 'rr1(V,x) =
is trivial, and Un V has
a circle for a deformation retract, so ir(Ufl V,x) = /. The inclusion
of U fl V in U takes a generator of -rr1(U fl V, x) to the element
'b1
.
.
.
By Van Kampen's theorem, for any group
G, to give a homomorphism from 'rr1(X,x) to G is the same as giving
a homomorphism from 7r1(U,x) =
to G (and a homomorphism from
'ir1(V,x) = {e} to G) in such a way that the composite
Z=ir1(UflV,x) —> ir1(U,x)
—> G
takes a generator of / to the identity element of G. This means pre-
cisely that one has a homomorphism from F2g to G such that Cg maps
to the identity, or equivalently, that
maps to the identity. That is,
Hom('rr1(X,4,G) = Hom(F2g/Ng,G).
This implies that the map from
to 'rr1(X,x) is an isomorphism,
cf. Exercise 14.5. (See also Exercise 14.8, which applies to this sit-
uation directly.)
Corollary 17.7. The first homology group 111X is a free abelian group
of rank 2g, with basis the image of the loops a1, /3k,

Proof. Let A2g be the free abclian group on 2g generators. The ca-
nonical map from F2g to A2g maps Ng to 0, since Cg is in the com-
mutator
subgroup.
This

rr1(X, x) = F28/N8 to A28, and therefore a homomorphism
H1(X) = 'rr1(X,x)/[ir1(X,x),ir1(X,x)] —>
Since the images of a1, b1
a8, bg generate H1(X), and their
images in A28 are linearly independent, it follows that they are linearly
independent in H1(X) and that this map is an isomorphism.
U
In particular, since the rank of a free abelian group is an invariant
of the group, this shows that the number g of Theorem 17.4 is in-
dependent of choices, and depends only on the topology of X. It is
called the genus of the surface. Together with what we saw in Chapter
8, this shows that for any triangulation of X, the number v of vertices,
e of edges, and f of faces satisfies the Euler equation
v—e+f= 2—2g.

The polygonal normal form of a surface can also be used to de-
scribe its universal covering space. When g = 0, of course, X is a
sphere, so simply connected. When g = 1, X is a torus, which we
have seen has the plane
as its universal covering. One can con-
struct this universal covering from its representation as a rectangle
with sides identified, by pasting the sides together but without iden-
tifying opposite sides. For g  2, the universal covering can be re-
alized in a similar way by gluing together copies of the polygon 11,
but one cannot do this in a metrical way in the ordinary plane. How-
ever, in a hyperbolic plane this can be done, and one can see that the
universal covering can be realized as a hyperbolic plane. The hyper-
bolic plane is homeomorphic to an open disk (or to R2), so from this
one sees that for all g  2 the universal covering is an open disk. For
more on the hyperbolic plane, see Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen (1952).
Exercise 17.11. Give another proof of the results of this section by
computing the fundamental group of the complement of 2g disjoint
disks in a two-sphere, and then showing what happens when one sews
g handles (each homeomorphic to S X 10, II) onto pairs of the bound-
aries of these disks.
Problem 17.12. Compute the fundamental group and first homology
group of the space obtained from a surface X of genus g by removing
n disjoint disks or points.
There is another important operation on the first homology group
H1X of an oriented compact surface, an intersection pairing, that as-
signs a number (a,'r) to two classes cr and 'r in J-11X. If the classes
are represented by loops that meet each other transversally in a finite
number of points, this number is the sum of the numbers ± I assigned
to each point of intersection, with the number ± I assigned according
to the following picture:
+1
-l
a

246
17. The Topology of Surfaces
The number is + I if the direction from u to T is counterclockwise,
and — 1 if it is clockwise. (Note that this notion depends on having
an orientation for X.) What takes some proof is showing that this
gives a well-defined number: that any two classes in H1X have rep-
resentatives that meet transversally (which is not difficult), and then
that the number one gets is independent of choices (which is more
difficult). Rather than doing this directly, we will construct this in-
tersection pairing by another procedure in the next chapter, by relating
it to the wedge product of 1 -forms.

CHAPTER 18
Cohomology on Surfaces
18a. 1-Forms and Homology
On any 'C surface X, just as on an open set in the plane, we have a
notion of 'C functions, 1-forms, and 2-forms w, and we have linear
maps d, that take a function f to a 1-form df, and a 1-form w to a 2-
form dw. (See Appendix D3 for definitions and basic properties.)
Therefore we have a notion of a 1-form w being closed (dw = 0) or
exact (w = df for some f). All exact forms are closed, so we can
define the first De Rham cohomology group as before:
H'X = {closed 1-forms onX}/{exact 1-forms onX}.
Just as in the case of open sets in the plane, if'y: [a,b]—*X is a
continuous path, and w is a closed 1-form on X, we can define an
integral
As before, if 'y is differentiable, this can be done by
calculus: f1w = fby*w In general, as in the plane, we can subdivide
the interval by a = t0 t1 S .
. .  = b, so that
,
is con-
tained in an open set
on which w = df, and then
Lw =
The same argument as in §9b shows that this is independent of choices.
As before, this extends from integrals over paths to integrals over 1-
chains, and the same argument shows that the integral over a bound-
247

248
18. Cohomology on Surfaces
ary is zero, and that the integral of df over a cycle is zero. It follows
that we again have a canonical map
H'X —*
that takes the class of w to the homomorphism
We want to calculate H'X when X is a compact oriented surface.
in particular, we want to show that this canonical map is an iso-
morphism. This could be donc by the Mayer—Vietoris argument (which
generalizes from open sets in the plane), but we will do it by explicitly
constructing a basis, which will be useful later.
We take a model of X as in §17c, with a basis for H1X given by
the loops a1, b1,
.
.
.
,
as indicated in the picture there. For
each loop a, we will construct a closed 1-form a,, and for each b, a
closed I-form ft, and we will show that the classes of these 2g 1-forms
form
a basis of H'X. The forms a, and
will depend on several
choices, but we will see that their classes in H'X depend only on the
homology classes of the 2g loops a1, b1,
.
.
. , ag, /2g.
For each of these loops we can find an open set V containing it that
is diffeomorphic to an annulus U = {(x, y): a2 <x2 + y2 C c2}, with the
loop corresponding to a counterclockwise circle around the middle of
the annulus, i.e., to the path t'—>(bcos(2'rrt),bsin(2'rrt)),
I, for
some a </2 C c:
We take these neighborhoods V to be disjoint, except for those con-
taining the same
and
which can be taken to intersect in a set
diffeomorphic to an open rectangle.

18a. 1-Forms and Homology
249
Consider one such ioop, either a1 or h1, and fix such a diffeo-
morphism p from a neighborhood V of the loop to such an annulus
U. From Exercise B. 14 we can find a
function
on the plane that
is identically 1 outside the big circle and identically 0 inside the small
circle. In fact, for any c with 0 C s C 1/2 (c — a), we can find kk so
that
fi
if x2+y2_>(c—E)2,
=
if x2+y2(a+e)2.
The function t4i°p is a cc function on V that is constant on a neigh-
borhood of the boundary of V. Its differential d(4i op) is therefore a
1-form that is identically zero on a neighborhood of the boundary of
V. We can therefore define a
I-form on all of X by defining it to
be dOJi op) on V, and identically 0 outside V. This is certainly a closed
1-form. In fact, its restriction to V is exact, and its restriction to an
open set V' with VU V X is zero. (Note that the form is not exact
on X, however, as follows for example from the following lemma.)
This is the 1-form we wanted to construct. We denote it by a, if the
given loop is a1, and
if the given loop is b,.
Lemma 18.1. These 1-forms a, and
have integrals:
(i) jP1=O foralliandj,
and
and
Proof. This is a direct calculation. All of the assertions that integrals

250
18. Cohomology on Surfaces
vanish follow from the fact that they are integrals of 1 -forms over a
loop, and these forms are exact on an open set containing the loop.
For the integral of ft along a1, cut a1 into two pieces, one inside the
annulus as shown, the other outside.
For the piece inside the annulus, ft is the differential of a function
whose value at the initial point is 0 and at the end point is 1, so the
integral of ft along this piece is 1. For the second, ft is identically
zero. So the integral is l + 0 = I, as asserted. The argument is similar
for the integral of a1 along
but this time the function is
1 at the
initial
point and 0 at the final point of the part of the path in the
annulus, so the integral is — I.
Proposition 18.2. (1) The canonical map H'X—* Hom(L11X,
is an
isomorphism.
(2) The classes of the I-forms a1,

Proof. The same argument as in the plane shows that this canonical
map is one-to-one.
For if to is a closed I-form and
for all
closed paths
then one can define a functionf on X by fixing a point
P0 and defining ftP) to be the integral of to along any path from P0
to P. The assumptions make this a well-defined function, and the
proof that df= to is the same as for open sets in the plane (see Prop-
osition 1 .8); indeed, the assertion df
to is a local assertion, so it can
be verified on coordinate neighborhoods.
To see that the canonical map is subjective, a homomorphism
h: H1X—>
is determined by its values on a basis, so suppose h([a1]) =
and
= s1 for some numbers r1 and
I j
g. By the lemma,
the closed I-form to =
ft — s1 a1)has fajto = r1 and
fh,to = s1, which
means that the canonical map takes to to h.
Exercise 18.3. Show that for closed 1-forms to on the surface X one
has a "module of periods" story as in Chapter 9: if the integrals of

18b. Integrals of 2-Forms
251
w along the basic loops are known, all integrals are determined. Show
in fact that if
= r1 and fb,w = s1, then for any closed I-chain
Lw =
for some integers
and
n1.
Note in particular that the classes [a] and
of
and ft in H'X
are determined by their integrals, so are independent of the choices
we made in defining them. They depend in fact only on the choice
of the basis for H1X determined by the a, and b.
18b. Integrals of 2-Forms
Once an orientation of our surface is chosen, one can integrate cr
2-forms. The integral of the 2-form v on X will be a real number,
denoted ffi v. More generally, if X is any oriented surface, and v is
a 2-form with compact support (i.e., which is identically zero outside
a compact subset of X), one can define
v by the following pro-
cedure. Choose an atlas of coordinate charts
say with
each
an open rectangle in the plane, with all charts compatible
with the given orientation, and satisfying the condition that any point
of X has a neighborhood meeting only finitely many WaWa) (see Ap-
pendix A4 and Lemma 24.10).
To give a 2-form v on X is the same as giving a 2-form VadXdY
on
(which the same as prescribing a function Va on
(Ia), such that
these 2-forms are compatible under changes of coordinates. First sup-
pose v is a 2-form that is zero except on a compact subset of one of
the open sets P,AUa). Then one can define the integral of v by
jjv
where the integral on the right is the ordinary Riemann integral of a
(or continuous) function Va on a rectangle. in general, choose a
partition of unity {'j'a} so that the closure of the support of each
is
contained in pa(U,33. Define the integral of v to be the sum of the
integrals of the
i.e.,
=

252
18. Cohomology on Surfaces
where the integral of each
is defined by the preceding case, since
it is zero except on pa(UJ. Note by the compactness of the support
of v that only finitely many
can be nonzero, so this sum is finite.
Exercise 18.4. (a) Verify that this definition is independent of the
choice of partition of unity and the choice of coordinate charts.
(b) Verify that the integral is linear: ff5(r1v1 + r2v2) =
+ ffxr2v2
for 2-forms v1 and v2 and real numbers r1 and r2. (c) Show that, if
the other orientation is chosen, then the integral changes sign.
We need the following version of the Green—Stokes theorem for a
surface:
Proposition 18.5. If v = dw, where w is a I -form with compact sup-
port on an oriented surface X, then
v =0.
Proof. Choosing an atlas and partition of unity as in the definition,
since w =

responds to a 1 -form

I 8c. Wedges and the Intersection Pairing
If X is a compact oriented surface, and to and p. are I -forms on X,
we can define a real number (to, p.) by the formula
(w,p.) = 1fxt014L.
where to A p. is the wedge product (Appendix D3). From basic prop-
erties of the wedge product (see Exercise D.7) we have:

18c. Wedges and the Intersection Pairing
253
(i)
for 1-forms to1, to2, and
p., and real numbers r1 and r2;
(ii) (to, 4= —(p.,w) for any 1-forms to and p.; and
(iii) (df, p.) = 0 for a function f and a closed 1-form is.
Condition (i) says that (to, p.) is linear in the first factor. Similarly,
or using (ii), it is linear in the second, i.e., it is a bilinear pairing.
Condition (ii) says that this pairing is skew-symmetric. Condition (iii),
together with (ii), says that (to, p.)
0 if either to or p. is exact. It
follows that we can define a mapping
H'XXH'X—> Elk,
[to]x[p.]
The point is that, since the integral vanishes when either is exact, the
result is independent of choice of a closed 1-form in an equivalence
class. This is also a bilinear and skew-symmetric pairing.
Lemma 18.6. Let ct and
be the 1-forms constructed in § 1 8a. Then
all i andj, and
(a,,ft)
=
Proof. As in Lemma 18. 1, this is a direct calculation. The pairings
that are asserted to be 0 are evident, since
these cases the wedge
products of the forms are zero. This uses the fact that a wedge product
to A p. vanishes where either to or p. vanishes, and the fact that toA to =0
for any 1-form to. it therefore suffices to verify that (at, ft) = I, i.e.,
that ffxajAf3i= 1, for all i. The form
vanishes off the region
that is the intersection of the two annuli around the 1oops a, and b,,
and this region is diffeomorphic to a rectangle. In a coordinate patch
we have the picture

On this rectangle, a, = 4f, and

0 on the right side of the rectangle and I on the left side, and g, is a

function that is 0 on the top of the rectangle and 1 on the bottom. If
R is this rectangle,
= JfdfeAdgi = Jfd(JYdgi) =
the last step by Green's theorem on the rectangle R. Now since dg,
vanishes on the bottom and top edges of the rectangle, J
is zero
on all sides of the rectangle except for the left vertical edge
where
it is equal to dg,. So
ff.dgi =

Taking pO, this says in particular that if wEH'X and (w,p.)=0

that the map from 111X to H'X taking

Problem 18.12. Suppose
is represented by a map from the circle
S' to X that extends to a diffeomorphism from an annulus containing
S' to an open subset of X. Use this annulus as in §17a to construct a
differential form w that vanishes outside the image of the annulus,
and, on the annulus, is the differential of a function that increases
from 0 to 1 as one moves from the inside to the outside of the annulus.
Show that w represents the class
of the corollary.
We can use the corollary to define an intersection
number (er, r)
for any o and 7 in H1X, as we indicated at the end of the last chapter.
Namely, let
and
be the cohomology classes given by the cor-
ollary, and define (cr,i) to be
i.e.,
(o,T) =
JJWCTAWT = .LWT =

Proposition 18.13. (1) This pairing is a bilinear skew-symmetric pairing
on H1X, i.e.,
(m1o1+m2cr2,T) = m1(u1,T)+m2(ff2,T),
(u, m1'c1 + m2'r2) = m1(u,
+ m2(o, 72),
(r,o-) = —(o,r),
for all a, 'r,
r1, r2 in
and all integers m1 and m-,.

18. Cohomology on Surfaces
(2) With the basis a, and bfor H1X as before, (a1, a) = (b1, b1) = 0
for all i andj, and
(a, r) is always an integer.
(4) For any o- in H1X, the map r—* (a, r) is a homomorphism from
H1X to 1, and every homomorphism from H1X to 1 arises in this way
from a unique a in H1X.
Proof. Part (1) follows from the corresponding assertions for the pair-
ing (
,
) on cohomology classes. Part (2) follows from Lemma 18.6
and Exercise 18.11: for example,
which is I ifi=j
and 0 otherwise. Since the a, and b, form a basis for H1X, (3) follows
from (I) and (2). The proof of (4) is the same as before: the element
if =
+ s1b, has (c, a1) =
and (if, b1) = r1, with this time r, and
integers, and a homomorphism is determined by arbitrarily speci-
fying the integers to which each element of a basis maps.

Problem 18.14. Suppose r and T are represented by maps from S'
to X that extend to diffeomorphisms of annuli with open sets in X,
so that the images cross transversally at a finite number of points.
Show how to assign numbers +1 or —1 to each intersection point
(see the end of § 17), in such a way that (cr,-r) is the sum of these
numbers.
It should be pointed out that, as we have constructed it here, the
intersection pairing uses a differentiable structure on the surface.
However, as the preceding problem indicates; it really depends only
on the topology.
Problem 18.15. Prove this assertion.
18d. De Rham Theory on Surfaces
We have concentrated on the first Dc Rham group 
plane, on any surface one has the 0th group H°X, which is the space
of locally constant functions on X. If X is connected, such functions
are constant, and H°X is just the space ER of constant functions.

18d. Dc Rham Theory on Surfaces
257
We can define the second De Rham group H2X of a differentiable
surface X by
H2X = {2-forms on X}/{exact 2-forms on X}.
if X is a compact oriented surface, it follows from Proposition 18.5
that integration defines a canonical map
H2X —> IL
[vi
F—> JJv.
it is easy to see that this map is surjective, by constructing a form v
that vanishes outside one coordinate neighborhood PaWoJ, and in Ua
has an expression VadXdY, with Va a nonnegative function with given
integral. We claim that, in fact, this canonical map is an isomor-
phism. This is equivalent to the
Claim 18.16. If fix v = 0, then v must be exact.
Equivalently, the dimension of H2X is (at most) one. With this, we
will know all the De Rham cohomology groups of a compact surface
of genus g:
H°X = IL
H'X
H2X
ER.
We will show how to extend the Mayer—Vietoris story to include
the second cohomology group, which will in particular prove this claim.
We will also see that if X is not compact, or if X is not orientable,
then I-12X = 0: every closed 2-form is exact.
Exercise 18.17. Show directly from the definition that, if U is an
open rectangle, every 2-form is exact. Conclude that H2U = 0 if U is
diffeomorphic to an open rectangle.
Exercise 18.18. Suppose a surface X is a disjoint union of a finite or
infinite number of open sets
Show that specifying a k-form on X
is the same as specifying a k-form on each
and specifying a class
in HkX is the same as specifying a class in HLUI for each i. in other
words, HkX is the direct product of the groups
We want to compare the cohomology groups for different open sets.
Note first that if U1 is a subset of U2, any differential function or
form on U2 determines by restriction a differential function or form
on U1. This restriction commutes with the boundary maps d (which
amounts to the obvious fact that partial derivatives of a function re-

258
18. Cohomology on Surfaces
stricted from a larger open set to a subset are the restrictions of the
partial derivatives). This means that restriction takes closed forms to
closed forms, and exact forms to exact forms, and hence determines
linear maps, also called restriction maps:
Hk(U2) —* J-P(U),
k = 0,1,2.
Exercise 18.19. If U1 C U2 C U3, show that the restriction map from
nk(u3) to Hk(U1)
is the composite of the restriction map from Hk(U3)
to !IL(U2) followed by the restriction map from H'<(U2) to
Exercise 18.20. If U and V are open sets in a surface X, and w is a
k-form on U fl V (with Ic =
I or 2), show that there are k-forms to1 on
U and w2 on V so that w = w1 — to2 on U fl V.
Given open sets U and V in a surface X, the contructions of Chapter
10 extend without change, giving a coboundary map
&H°(UflV)
—> H'(UUV).
The Mayer—Vietoris properties MV(i)—MV(v) of § lOd continue to
hold for these spaces and maps. Similarly, we construct a coboundary
map
&H'(UflV) —*
The construction of a map from {closed 1-forms on U fl V} to H2(U U V)
proceeds exactly as before: Given a closed I -form to on U fl V, use
Exercise
18.20 to write to as
to1 — to-, with
to1 and to-, 1-forms on U
and V, respectively. The 2-forms dw and dw2 agree on UflV, so
there is a unique 2-form ji on U U V that agrees with dw1 on U and
with dw2 on V. Define 8(w) to be the class of this 2-form
8(w) = Its].
Exactly as before, one checks that this is independent of the choice
of to1 and to2, and is a linear map. To see that it defines a homo-
morphism on the quotient space
H'(U fl V) =
{closed I-forms on Un V}/{exact 1-forms on U fl V},
we must show that the map just defined vanishes on the exact 1-forms.
If to = df, write f =11
with f' and 12 functions on U and V, re-
spectively. Then in our construction of the coboundary of w we may
take to1 = df1 and to2 = df2, from which it follows that dto1 and dto2 are
both zero, so js = 0 and 8([to]) = 0, as required.
We claim next that properties (i)—(v) continue:
MV(vi). Given co in H'(U fl V), 8(w) = 0 if and only if w = a — /3Jbr
some a in H'U and
in H'V.

MV(vii). Given
/L in 112(U U V), ji restricts to zero in J-12U and 112V
if and only jf,a
8(w) for some win H'(Ufl V).
MV(viii). Given a in H2U and /3 in H2V, a and /3 have the same
restriction to H2(U fl V) if and only if a and /3 are the restrictions of
some element in i-12(U U V).
The proofs are exactly the same as before, and are left as exercises.
In addition, we have, as an immediate consequence of Exercise 18.20:
MV(ix). Any class it in H2(U fl V) can he written as the difference
of a class a in HU and a class /3 in I-12V.
Putting this together, using the fancy language as before, we have
the full
Theorem 18.21 (Mayer—Vietoris Theorem). For any open sets U and
V in a surface, there is an exact sequence

Problem 18.22. Use Mayer—Vietoris to show that H2X = 0 for any
open subset of the plane.
Proposition 18.23. if X is a surface diffeomorphic to a sphere with
g handles, then dim H2X =
1.
Proof. We can write X as the union of the same two open sets U and
V that we used in the proof of Proposition 17.6. Since V is diffeo-
morphic to an open disk, I-I'V=0=H2V, see Exercise 18.17. We
leave it as an exercise to show similarly that H2U = 0. We know that
!i'(U fl V)
The proof of Proposition 17.6 shows that the map
from H1U to 111X induced by inclusion is an isomorphism. It follows
from this and Proposition 18.2 that the restriction map from H'X to
H'U
is an isomorphism. The relevant part of the Mayer—Vietoris se-
quence is therefore
LIX -4 H'U%O -* H'(UflV) -* H2X -*
It follows that the map from H'(U fl V) to H2X is an isomorphism.
Since H'(U fl V)
IL this shows that H2X is one dimensional.

Exercise 18.24. Give another proof of the proposition by writing X
as a union of a sphere with 2g disjoint disks removed, and the union
of g handles, each diffeomorphic to a cylinder S' x (0, 1).
Exercise 18.25. If X is a nonorientable compact surface, use Mayer—
Vietoris to show that H2X = 0. If X is written in normal form as in
Problem 17.5, show that the dimension of H'X is h — I. Show that
for all the compact surfaces, if triangulated with v vertices, e edges,
andf faces,
v—e+f = dim(H°X)—dim(H'X)+dim(H2X).
Problem 18.26. (a) 1ff: Y—*X is a differentiable map of surfaces,
show how to define

orientable surface, andf: X —÷X is its orientation covering, show that
ffrf*w = 0 for any 2-form w on X. Conclude again that H2X = 0.
We will see in Chapter 24 that there are corresponding homology
groups H2X, with a corresponding Mayer—Vietoris sequence, and iso-
morphisms H2X
Hom(H,X, li). We will also see in Chaptcr 24 that
112X vanishes for any noncompact surface.

PART X
RIEMANN SURFACES
Many of the ideas about covering spaces, homology, and cohomol-
ogy, can be used in the study of Ricmann surfaces. A Riemann sur-
face is a differentiable surface with a complex analytic structure.
Compact Riemann surfaces arise by taking a finite-sheeted covering
of the complement of a finite set in the two-sphere S2. and then filling
in appropriately over the branch points. We prove the Riemann—Hur-
witz formula that computes the genus (number of handles) of a surface
arising this way.
If F(z, w) is an irreducible polynomial in two complex variables, it
defines w as an algebraic function of z, and one is interested in the
behavior of integrals of the form fdz/w, or more generally JR(z, w) dz,
where R is any rational function. Associated with F there is a complex
plane curve F(z, w) = 0; as a subset of C2 it is, except for a possible
finite number of singularities, a Riemann surface, and the above pro-
cess compactifies this surface. One of the key discoveries of the nine-
teenth century was how the topology of this surface, i.e., the genus
g, controls much of the analysis related to the algebraic function w
and its integrals. The integrals between two points are defined up to
"periods," which are integrals along classes in the first homology
group of the Riemann surface.
In Chapter 21 we use what we have learned about the topology and
differential forms on a surface to prove the celebrated Riemann—Roch
theorem, which shows how that topology (genus) of a surface controls
the kinds of meromorphic functions and forms one can find on the
surface. We also prove the Abel—Jacobi theorem, which similarly re-

262
Part X. Riemann Surfaces
lates the possible integrals on the surface to its topology. We prove
these theorems only for Riemann surfaces that are known to arise
from a plane curve, i.e., from an irreducible polynomial F(Z, W). (It
is true that all compact Riemann surfaces arise this way, but we do
not prove this here.) In this case there is a short proof of Weil that
uses the algebraic notion of adeles, together with the few facts from
analysis and topology that we have available.

CHAPTER 19
Riemann Surfaces
19a. Riemann Surfaces and Analytic Mappings
A Riemann surface X is a connected surface with a special collection
of coordinate charts pa:
As bcfore,
is a subset of
but
now we identify W with the complex numbers C. The requirement
to be a Riemann surface is that the change of coordinate mappings
from
C
to
C ¼ are not just
but they must also be
analytic, or holomorphic. Recall (see §9d) that an analytic function
f on an open set in C is a complex-valued function that is locally
expandable in a power series, i.e., at each point z0 in the open set,
there is a power series
—
that converges tof(z) for all z
in some neighborhood of z0. As before, another atlas of charts is
compatible with a given one (and defines the same Riemann surface)
if the changes of coordinates from charts in one to charts in the other
are all analytic.
Any Riemann surface has a natural orientation. This follows from
the fact that, when the analytic changes of coordinates are written out
in terms of their real and imaginary parts, the Jacobian of the result
has positive determinant. We will consider only connected Riemann
surfaces.
Exercise 19.1. Show that in fact, if wf(z), with w=u+iv and
z = x + iy, the determinant of the Jacobian of the map from (x, y) to
(u, v) is the square of the absolute value of the complex derivative
263

264
19. Ricmann Surfaces
We have seen several examples of Riemann surfaces. Of course,
C itself is one, with the identity coordinate chart C—* C, and any open
subset of C (or any Riemann surface) is also a Riemann surface. The
sphere S2 is a compact Riemann surface, with the charts given by
spherical projection from the north and south poles. Indeed, we saw
(Exercise 7. 14) that the change of coordinates mapping in this case
is given by the map z F—* liz from C \ {O} to C \ {O}. (When we speak
of 52, it will always be regarded as a Riemann surface with these
coordinate charts.) The torus
= C/(Z + Li)
is a compact Rie-
mann surface, using the projections from small open sets in C to the
quotient for coordinate charts.
Any compact oriented surface can be given a structure of a Rie-
mann surface (as we shall see later), but, except for the sphere
there are infinitely many nonequivalent Riemann surfaces with the
same underlying surface. For example, if A CC is any lattice, i.e.,
a subgroup generated by two elements that give a basis for C as a
real vector space, then C/A is likewise a compact Riemann surface.
These are all homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to each other, but
they are generally not isomorphic Riemann surfaces (see Exercise
19.17). This is part of the general subject of "moduli of Riemann
surfaees"—the study of the set of all Riemann surfaces of a given
genus—that we can only hint at in this book.
If X is a Riemann surface, it makes sense to say that a function
f: X—÷ C is analytic (or holomorphic): f is analytic if for each coor-
dinate chart
the composite fopa is an analytic function
on the open set (L in C. More generally, if X and Y are Riemann
surfaces, a mappingf: X—> Y is analytic at a point P in X if there are
charts p: U—>X and 4s: V—> Y mapping to neighborhoods of P and
f(P), respectively, so thatf(p(U)) C ili(V), and the composite
ofotp
is an analytic function from U to V:

19a. Riemann Surfaces and Analytic Mappings
265
This condition is independent of the choice of coordinates p and 4,.
In fact, we can choose both U and V to be disks centered at the origins,
with these origins mapped to P and f(P). In this case the composite
h = iJi' ofe p has the form h(z) =
1 a,,?, for some converging power
series. As we will soon see, the order of vanishing of h at the origin,
i.e., the smallest integer e such that a9
0, is independent of the
choice of coordinates. This integer is called the ramification index of
f at P, and we will denote it by e1(P), or just e(P) when one function
f is being considered. (1ff is constant, of course, h is identically 0,
and e = cc, but we will not be interested in constant maps.) The point
P is called a ramjfication point forf if e1 (P)> 1.
We claim next that we can change the coordinate chart p so that
the composite iJf1 efop is the function zF—>?. To see this, write
h(z) =
g(z), where g(z) is an analytic function at the origin and
g(0) 00. (g(z) =
Such an analytic function g, possibly in
a smaller disk around the origin, can be written as the eth power of
an analytic function k(z); for example, g(z)/a9 maps 0 to I, so maps
a neighborhood of 0 to the right half-plane, so one can compose it
with a branch of the log function
log(z) = —E1(l—zY
for
,,=
n
and then set
k(z) =
a is any eth root of a9 and exp(z) =
/n!)z".
Exercise 19.2. Verify that
in some disk containing the
origin. Show that there are exactly e choices for such Ic (up to shrink-
ing the disks they are defined on), obtained by the e choices for the
eth root a of a9.
Now we have written h(z) = (z . k(z))9, where Ic is an analytic func-
tion with k(0) 00. The mapping zF—>z k(z) is an analytic isomor-
phism in some neighborhood of the origin, since its derivative does
not vanish at the origin. Therefore, we can define a new coordinate
chart
(from some small disk U' to X) so that
= p(z k(z)) for
all small z. It follows that, with this new coordinate chart
the
composite 4,ofo
is just the map n—*z9, as required.
The mapping zi—*z9 is familiar: it maps 0 to 0, and outside the

266
19. Riemann Surfaces
origin it is an e-sheeted covering map. This shows that there are
neighborhoods U of P and V of f(P) so that f maps U to V, and the
mapping U \ {P}—÷ V \ {f(P)} is an e-sheeted covering. This shows in
particular that the number e is independent of choices, and in fact
depends only on the topology of the mapf near P.
Note another important consequence of this local structure: a non-
constant analytic mapping is always an open mapping, i.e., the image
of any open set is open. In particular, if X is compact and Y is not
compact, the only analytic mappings from X to Y are constants. When
Y = C
this openness is a strong form of the maximum principal: one
cannot have a point Po such that

hood of P0.
Proposition 19.3. Let f: X—* Y be a nonconstant analytic map be-
tween compact Riemann surf lices.
(1) There are a finite number of ramification points. Let R C X be
the set of ramjfication points, and set S =f(R) C Y.
(2) The map from X\f'(S) to Y\S determined byf is an n-sheeted
covering map for some finite number n. This integer n is called
the degree off
(3) For any point Q in Y,
= n.
Proof. (1) follows from the fact that for any point P, there is a neigh-
borhood of P that contains no other ramification point, using the com-
pactness of X to cover it by a finite number of such neighborhoods.
It follows similarly thatT'(Q) is finite for all points Q in Y (consider
a possible limit point of the setf '(Q)).
To prove (2), let Q

neighborhoods U, of P and V, of Q such that f maps

phically onto

are disjoint, and that V1 contains no point of S. For any connected

f maps each U1' homeomorphically onto V. We claim that
for V sufficiently small, f'(V) is the disjoint union of the sets U/,
from which it follows that V is evenly covered, so f is a covering in
a neighborhood of Q. To prove this claim, suppose on the contrary
that there is a sequence of neighborhoods N1 of Q whose intersection
is {Q}, such that there is a point P1' in f '(N1) with P1' not in

that the whole neighborhood V = flV1 is evenly covered.)

Again if V is a neighborhood of Q contained in the inter-

points over a point Q' in V except for the point Q. By
(2), this sum must be the number n of sheets of the covering.
fl
A meromorphic function f on a Riemann surface X is the same as
an analytic functionf: X—>S2 from X to the Riemann sphere. Equiv-
alently, f is an analytic function from X \ S to C, with S a discrete
subset of X, and for each point P in X, there is a coordinate chart
p: U—>XtakingOtoP, sothaton

integer k and some analytic function g that is nonvanishing in U. The
integer k is called the order off at P.
and is denoted
It is
independent of the choice of the local coordinate. If k is positive, one
says that f has a zero of order k, or vanishes to order k, and if k is
negative, we say that f has a pole of order —k.
Exercise 19.4. Show thatf is meromorphic at P if and only if there
is a coordinate chart as above and an integer k so that the function
z approaches 0.
In terms of the mappingf: X—>S2, the order off at P is positive if
f(P)=0, negative iff(P)=3c, and zero otherwise. lff(P)=O, the
order off at P is just the ramification index ef(P) off at P. Similarly,
if f(P) = °°, the order of f at P is minus the ramification index at P,
since 1 /z is a local parameter for the Riemann sphere at oc• Jf X is
compact, we know that the sum of the ramification indices over any
point in 52 is the degree n of f Assertion (3) of the proposition says
that f takes on all values the same number of times, counting mul-
tiplicity correctly. In particular, for the values 0 and oc, this gives:
Corollary 19.5. For any nonconstant meromorphic function f on a
compact Riemann surface X,
Eordp(J) = 0.

that the degree of this mapping is the maximum of the integers d1 and
d2. (c) Show that the ramification index of this mapping at cc is d1 — d2j.
(d) Show that every analytic mapping from 52 to s2 has this form.
19b. Branched Coverings
If Y is a Riemann surface, and p: X—+ Y is a covering mapping, then
thcre is a unique structure of a Ricmann surface on X so that p is an
analytic mapping. In fact, onc can choosc charts
—* V for Y so
that cach
is evenly covered by p; each component Vaj of
maps homeomorphically to Pcx(Ucr) by p, and the com-
posite
'PaWa)
*
of p(, and the inverse of p, gives a coordinate chart on X. It is straight-
forward to verify that the changes of coordinates for these charts are
analytic, so define a Riemann surface structure on X.
Exercise 19.7. If Y is a Riemann surface, and G is a group acting
evenly on Y by analytic isomorphisms, show that Y/G can be given
the structure of a Riemann surface so that Y—* Y/G is analytic.
An important case of this is the fact that the universal covering A' of
a Riemann surface is a Riemann surface, and the fundamental group
'r1(X,x) acts as a group of analytic isomorphisms of 7. When X = S2.
1= X; when X = C/A for a lattice A, X = C. It is a fact of complex
analysis (the uniformization theorem) that in all other cases, the uni-
versal covering is isomorphic to the upper half plane H (or an open
disk). The automorphisms of H all have the form z F—> (az + b)/(cz + d)
where
is a real matrix of determinant 1. This means that X can
be realized as the quotient of H by a subgroup of 5L2(R)/{±I} acting
evenly on H. We will not have more to say about this situation, which
is a fundamental area of mathematics in its own right.
In the last section we saw that any (nonconstant) analytic map X—> Y
of compact Riemann surfaces determines a finite-sheeted covering
X \f '(5)—> Y \ 5, for some finite set S in V. Our goal in this section
is to reverse this process. Given a Riemann surface Y, a finite subset
S of Y, and a finite-sheeted topological covering p: X°—> V \ S, by what
we just proved, X° gets a structure of a Riemann surface so that this

19b. Branched Coverings
269
mapping is analytic. We want to "fill in" the missing points over the
points of S, embedding r in a Riemann surface X, so that we have
an analytic mappingf from X to Y compatible with the given covering:
xocx
V
Y\S
C
Y.
If Y is compact, we want X to be compact. In general, we want the
mappingf to be proper: for any compact set K of Y, the inverse image
r'(K) should be a compact set in X. The problem is local on Y: we
need to fill in the covering over each point of S. We will look first
at the "local model" of a Riemann surface—an open disk.
Let D = {z: zJ C
I }, D° = D \ {O}. We know all about the coverings
of D°. In fact, its fundamental group is Z (since it contains a circle
as a deformation retract), so connected finite-sheeted coverings cor-
respond to subgroups of finite index in /, and the only such subgroups
of / are the groups e7L for e a positive integer. The e-sheeted covering
corresponding to this subgroup is

This means that if p: E°—÷D° is any e-sheeted connected covering,
there is a homeomorphism 4c: D°—* E° so that p° = Pe.

This homeomorphism tji is not uniquely determined, depending, as

there are exactly e such homeomorphisms, corresponding to the e

ping 0 to the added point, is an isomorphism of D with F. Note that
this does not depend on the choice of 4i, since the map
z is
an analytic isomorphism.
Now return to the givcn covering p: X°—> Y \ S. Given Q in 5, we
can find a coordinate chart p:D—>p(D)=UCY, with D the open
unit disk in the plane, and p(O) = Q, such that U does not contain
any other point of S but Q. Let 111° = U \ {Q}. The covering p restricts
to a covering of (1°, so p(U°) is a disjoint union of connectcd open
sets

with each V10—÷ (1° a connected covering, say with
sheets. By what we just saw, one can find homeomorphisms

so that each

from D to
Taking these extensions as charts, the disjoint union
of the V, becomes a Riemann surface. The map from
to U° extends
to an analytic map from V, to U that has ramification index e, at the
added point.
If this is done at each point of 5, one gets a space X that is the
union of X° with a finite number of points. These local charts give X
the structure of a Riemann surface (noting that the added charts are
compatible with the given charts on X°), and the covering p is ex-
tended to an analytic mapping f: X—* Y.
Exercise 19.8. Verify that this defines a Riemann surface X, and the
mapf is analytic and proper.

19b. Branched Coverings
271
These results are summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 19.9. Let Y be a Riemann surface, S a finite subset of
Y, andp: r—> Y \ S afinite-sheeted covering map, with IC connected.
Then there is an embedding of X° as an open subset of a Riemann
surface X that is a union of IC and a finite set, so that p extends to
a proper analytic mapping from X to Y.
Exercise 19.10. Show that X, with its Riemann surface structure, is
unique up to canonical isomorphism: if X° C X' —* Y is another, there
is a unique isomorphism of Riemann surfaces from X to IC compatible
with the inclusions of X° and mappings to Y.
Exercise 19.1!. Extend the proposition to the case where S is an
infinite but discrete subset of Y.
One reason for the importance of this proposition is that, since we
know the fundamental group of Y \ S (see Problem 17. 12 for the gen-
eral case), we know all possible finite-sheeted coverings. The main
case of concern to us will be Y=52, with S
a set of r points. By
choosing disjoint arcs from a base point
to these points, we can
number the points S =

in this order, going counterclockwise around
Then one can con-
struct loops

and go back along the
arc to Qo.

This is isomorphic to a free group on r —

Remark 19.13. In § 16d we described a correspondence between n-
sheeted coverings of a space and actions of its fundamental group on
a finite set T with n elements. To give an action of this fundamental
group on a set T is the same as giving r permutations s1,
.
.
. , Sr of
T, with the requirement that
.
.
.
is the identity permutation.
So any such data determine a branched covering of the sphere. The
classical way to do this was to use the fact that the complement of
the r arcs drawn is simply connected, so a covering over this is a
disjoint union of r copies of it. Labeling these by elements of T, the
permutations are used to describe how to glue the sheets together across
the arcs, to get the Riemann surface X. (Note, however, that the arcs
are only a tool used to give nice generators for the fundamental group,
and are not necessary for describing the covering.)
Exercise 19.14. (a) Carry out this construction, and show that it agrees
with that described before. (b) Show that the covering corresponding
to this choice of permutations is connected if and only if they generate
a transitive subgroup of the automorphisms of T. (Recall that a group
of permutations is transitive if, for any elements t1 and t2 of T, there
is a permutation in the group that takes t1 to t2.) (c) Let X be the
corresponding Riemann surface, withf: X—> S2 the analytic mapping.
For each i, write T as a disjoint union of sets
so that
permutes
the elements of each T11 cyclically. Show that there is one point of
X over Q for each set
and the cardinality of T11 is the ramification
index off at this point.
19c. The Riemann—Hurwitz Formula
Given an analytic mapping f: X—* Y between compact Riemann sur-
faces, our next aim is to describe the topology of X in terms of the
topology of Y and the local behavior around the branch points.

19c. The Riemann—l-Iurwitz Formula
273
Theorem 19.15 (Riemann—Hurwitz). Letf: X—÷ Y be an analytic map
of degree n between compact Riemann surfaces. If Y can be trian-
gulated, so can X, and the genus gx of X and the genus gy of Y are
related by the formula
=
Proof By refining the triangulation of Y if necessary, for example,
using the barycentric subdivision described in §8b, we can assume
the triangulation has the property that each point Q of S is a vertex
in the triangulation. We will construct from this an explicit triangu-
lation of X. It is simplest to describe the vertices and the "open"
edges (homeomorphic to (0, 1)) and the open faces (homeomorphic
to the interior of a plane triangle) of this triangulation of X: these are
exactly the components of the inverse images by f of the cone-
sponding vertices, open edges, and open faces of the triangulation of
Y. The point is that each of the open edges and faces on Y is in the
locus where the map is a covering, and, since edges and faces are
simply connected, the restriction of the covering to each of them is
trivial, which means that there are n subsets of X that map homeo-
morphically onto each of them, and these are the specified open edges
and faces.
For each closed edge and face on Y the triangulation specifies a
homeomorphism with a closed interval or a closed triangle. Com-
posing with the projections, we have compatible homeomorphisms of
the open edges and faces on X with the interiors of these intervals or
triangles. To see that we have a triangulation, we must verify that
these homeomorphisms extend to the closed intervals and triangles.
This is clear when the image edges or triangles in Y do not have
vertices in 5, since in that case the coverings are trivial over the entire
closed triangle. The same argument shows that the homeomorphisms
extend (uniquely, by continuity) to the closures of the intervals and
triangles, except possibly in an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a
vertex mapping to a point in f '(5). To see that it extends continu-
ously to such points is a local question, so we can assume we are in
the situation z p—> f of the mapping from the disk to itself. The cor-
responding vertex is sent to the center of the disk, and the continuity
of the map at the vertex follows from the fact that

The following picture shows the two types of behavior:

Now suppose the triangulation of Y has v vertices, e edges, and f
faces. By the construction of the triangulation of X, it has n
faces
and n e edges. But the number of vertices is not n v, since over
each point Q of S there may be fewer than n points, in fact, by the
equation
= n, the sum taken over the points P in
the
number of points over Q is n —
— 1). it follows that the num-
ber of vertices in the triangulation of X is nv—>2(e1(P)—- I), with
the sum over all P inr'(S), or in X, since ef(P)= I if P is not in
f'(S). The Euler characteristic of X is therefore

gulating Y so that each point of S lies inside a face, and no face

19c. The Riemann—Hurwiti Formula
275
The Riemann—Hurwitz formula can be useful to limit the possibil-
ities for mappings between Riemann surfaces. Consider for example
a nonconstant analytic mappingf C/A—>C/A', where A and A' are
two lattices in C. Since both have genus 1, it follows from the Rie-
rnann—i-lurwitz formula that e1(P)= I for all P. i.e.,f must be un-
ramified. Now f lifts to an analytic mapping 7: C—> C so that the
diagram
—
C

C/A
>-C/k,
commutes. In fact, since C is simply connected, the composite fop
lifts through the covering p' by Proposition 13.5, to produce a con-
tinuous map 7, and 7 is automatically analytic since the projections
from C to the quotient spaces arc local isomorphisms. Similarly, since
f is unramified, f is also unramified. From the topology one can see
also that 7 extends continuously to a map from
= C fl {oc} to itself,
taking
to
From Exercise 19.4 this extension, also denoted 7, is
an analytic mapping from S2 to
if the degree of 7 is n, the sum
of the e1(P) —
1 can be at most n —
1 (since ramification can take place
only over oc), and this contradicts the Riemann—Hurwitz formula un-
less n = I. By Exercise 19.6, we deduce that 7(z) = Ic + p. for some
complex numbers A and p., with
in particular,
Conversely, any such A and p. determine an analytic mappingf. This
puts strong restrictions on the relations between the lattices, and on
the possible maps f.
Exercise 19.17. (a) Show that for any lattice A there is a nonzero
complex number a so that
A is generated by I and 7, where
is
a number in the upper half plane. So every C/A is isomorphic to one
of the form C/(Z + / . 7). (b) Show that for two numbers 7 and 7' in
the upper half plane, C/(Z + 1 7) is isomorphic to C/(l + / 7') if
and only if 7'

surface C/(l + 1 7) to itself that take the image of 0 to itself are
given by multiplication by an integer n, unless 7 satisfies a quadratic
polynomial with integer coefficients.
it follows from the preceding exercise that the set of compact Rie-
mann surfaces that are isomorphic to some C/A are in one-to-one
correspondence with the space H/SL2(l) of orbits of the discrete group

276
19. Riemann Surfaces
SL2(Z) on the upper half plane H. In particular, not all such Riemann
surfaces are isomorphic as Riemann surfaces, although they are all
diffeomorphic to S' X S'. We will see later that every compact Rie-
mann surface of genus I has the form C/A, so H/SL2(Z) is the mod-
uli space of compact Riemann surfaces of genus I.

CHAPTER 20
Riemann Surfaces and Algebraic Curves
20a. The Riemann Surface of an Algebraic Curve
If F(Z, W) is a polynomial in two variables, with complex coeffi-
cients, that is not simply a constant, its zero set
C = {(z,w)EC2:F(z,w)0}
is called a "complex affine plane curve." Identifying C2 with W, C
is defined by two real equations: the vanishing of the real and imag-
inary parts of F(z, w). We may therefore expect C to be a surface,
and this expectation is generally true, except that, just as in the case
of real curves, C may have singularities. We will use the construction
of the preceding section to "remove" these singularities, and also add
some points over them and "at infinity," to get a compact Riemann
surface. In fact, if F is not irreducible, the surface we get will be the
disjoint union of the surfaces we get from the irreducible factors of
F, so we assume for now that F is an irreducible polynomial, i.e., it
has no nontrivial factors but constants. Write
F(Z,W) =
...
with
a polynomial in Z alone, and a0(Z)
0. We may also as-
sume that n is positive, for otherwise F = bZ + c, and C is isomorphic
to C, given by the projection to the second factor. We will need a
little piece of algebra. Let

Proof. We use the lemma of Gauss (Appendix C3): if F is irreducible
in C[Z,
then F is also irreducible in C(Z)[WI, where C(Z) is the
field of rational functions in Z. The equation of Lemma 20. 1 can be
found (and computed) from the Euclidean algorithm in the ring
C(Z)[W], as follows. Divide F by
to get, after clearing denomi-
nators, an equation of polynomials
b0 E C[Z], and R1 is a polynomial of degree less than n —

W. lf the degree of R1 in W is positive, divide
by R1, getting an

F is irreducible.
Set d = Rk+ 1• To find an equation of the form required amounts to
showing that d is in the ideal in C[Z, Wi generated by F and
this
ideal contains R1 by the first equation, then R2 by the second, and so
on, until finally it contains RL÷I =d.
If one takes an equation as in the lemma so that B, C, and d are
not all divisible by any nonconstant polynomial in Z, then d will be
unique up to multiplication by a constant; this d is called the dis-
criminant of F with respect to W. For our purposes any d will do.

Let p be the first projection from C to C: p(z, w) = z. We will show
that, if a finite number of points are removed, p becomes a covering
map.

Lemma 20.3. There is a finite subset S of C such that the projection
from C \p'(S) to C \ S is a finite covering with n sheets.
Proof. From Lemma 20.1 we draw the conclusion that if z E C and
then there is no w with F(z,w)0 and
This
means that the equation F(z, W) = 0 has no multiple roots. If in ad-
dition a0(z)

to do this is to apply the implicit function thcorem, either for a subset
of
defined by two real equations, or thc complex analogue for a
subset of C2 defined by one equation. Another is to use the Argument
Principle. For this, take small disjoint closed disks around these n
points, and let
be a counterclockwise path around the boundary of
the disk around w1. For z near z0 and w on a circle

since the integral is an integer that is I when z=z0, and it varies
continuously with z. This means that there is exactly one root of the
equation F(z, W) = 0 inside 'y•. In fact, from Problem 9.34, this root
is given by the formula

F(z,w)

In particular, take U to be a disk around z0 where all these functions
g1 are defined, and set V, = {(z, g(z)): z E U}. Since these points give
all possible roots of F(z, W) = 0 over z in U, we see that p'(U) is
the union of open sets
V, homeomorphically onto
V, with an inverse given by
LI
Now regard Cc
= Cu {oo} as usual, and enlarge S by including
the point at infinity in it. By the lemma, we have a covering map
x°—*s- \ 5, with X° = {(z, w): F(z, w) = 0 and z
S}. This covering
map gives X° the structure of a Riemann surface, except that we must
prove it is connected:
Lemma 20.4. If F(Z, W) is irreducible, then X° is connected.
Proof. Let Y° be a connected component of X°. If X° is not connected,

280
20. Riemann Surfaces and Algebraic Curves
then the covering x°—÷s2 S restricts to a covering r—>s2 \ S with
m<n sheets (see Exercise 11.11). For each z not in S, let e1(z),

, e,,,(z) be the elementary symmetric functions in the m val-
ues of w on the points in p'(z) fl Y°. That is, e1(z) is the sum of these
m values, e2(z) is the sum of all products of pairs of these values, and
so on until em(z) is the product of all m values. These functions
are
clearly analytic on
They are in fact meromorphic on
as
follows from the fact that, for a in 5, after multiplying by some (z — a)",
the roots w,(z) approach 0 (see Exercise 19.4). Consider the poly-

It follows that G divides F in C(Z)[WJ, since the remainder obtained
by dividing F by G would be a polynomial whose coefficients are
rational functions of Z vanishing on an infinite set. This contradicts
the irreducibility of F, and completes the proof.
By Proposition 19.9 this covering can be extended to a compact
Riemann surface X, together with an analytic map!: X—>
This Rie-
mann surface is called the Riemann surface of the algebraic curve C
or of the polynomial F. It is easily seen to be independent of choice
of S. In fact, the following exercise shows more.
Exercise 20.5. A point P = (z0, w0) is called a nonsingular point of
C if either: (i) Fjzo, w0) 0 0; or (ii)
w0) 00; or both. (a) Show
that the canonical map from X° to C extends to an isomorphism of a
neighborhood in X with C in a neighborhood of P. (b) Show that the
ramification index of z: X—>
at the corresponding point is 1 in case
(i), and the order of vanishing at w0 of the function w—>F(z0, w) in
case (ii).
It is a theorem in analysis that every compact Riemann surface is
the Riemann surface of an algebraic curve. The problem for proving
this is to produce the meromorphic functions "z" and "w" on X. It
is not at all obvious that there are any nonconstant meromorphic func-
tions. For those that arise as branched coverings of
(which is the

20b. Meromorphic Functions on a Riemann Surface
281
same as producing one nonconstant meromorphic function z), it is not
obvious how to produce another not in C(z); once one produces a
meromorphic function w that takes n distinct values on the n points
in X over some given point of S2, however, it is not hard to see that
w satisfies some irreducible equation F(z, w)
0, and that X is the
Riemann surface of this polynomial.
Let us work out the example with F(Z, W) = W3 + Z3W + Z. By
Exercise 20.2, d(Z) = 4Z9 + 27Z2, so the possible branch points are
where z = 0, z =
and the solutions of 1' = —27/4. The points of C
over the finite points are nonsingular. Over 0 there is one point (0,0),
and the ramification index of z: X—÷S2 is 3. Over each of the seventh
roots of —27/4 there are two points, so one of each must have ram-
ification index 2 and the other must be unramified. The point at in-
finity can be analyzed by making the substitution Z' = l/Z, but one
can see from the Riemann—Hurwitz formula that the sum of the num-
bers
—
I for the points P over
must be odd, so there must be
two points over
with ramification indices 2 and I. The genus gx
of the Riemann surface is given by
—6+2+71+l,
so the genus is 3.
Exercise 20.6. For each of the following polynomials, compute a set
S as in Lemma 20.3, compute the ramification indices of the points
over S in the Riemann surface, and compute the genus of the Riemann
surface: (i) W2 — [17

bers; (ii)4W3—3Z2W+Z32Z; (iii) W3—Z6+ 1; (iv) W3—3W2+Z6;
and (v)
I.
Exercise 20.7. (a) If a compact Riemann surface X has a mero-
morphic function with only one pole of order 1, show that X is iso-
morphic to
(b) If X has a meromorphic function with two poles
of order I, or one pole of order 2, show that it gives a two-sheeted
covering X—÷S2. (c) Show that, for a given set of 2g + 2 points in
there is, up to isomorphism, exactly one two-sheeted covering that
branches at these points.
20b. Meromorphic Functions on a
Riemann Surface
The meromorphic functions on a Riemann surface X form a field,
which we denote by M(X) or just M. If X is the Riemann surface of

282
20. Riemann Surfaces and Algebraic Curves
the polynomial F(Z, W), then the functions z and w (which come from
the two projections of C C C2 to the axes) are seen as in Lemma 20.4
to be meromorphic functions on X, as are any rational functions of z
and w. Such rational functions form a subfield of M, which we can
denote by C(z, w).
Proposition 20.8. Every meromorphic function on X is a rational
function of z and w:
M
M(X) = C(z,w)
Proof. Note first that any element in C(z)[w] can be written as a poly-
nomial of degree at most n — I is w, as seen by dividing by F. So it
suffices to show that any meromorphic function h on X is in C(z)[wI.
From Lemma 20. 1 we have an equation
d(z)'h =
=
so it suffices to show that Fh(z, w) 'h is in C(z)[w]. For z not in the
branch set S, let P1,
.

be the points of X over z. Then
F(z,W) =
Fh(Z,W) = ao(zYEH(W—w(P1)),

so, for I

Now consider the expression
w(P1)).

On the one hand, as in Lemma 20.4, this can be written in the form

This means that h

of a finite set, which implies that they are equal.
Exercise 20.9. If F7(z0, w0) 00, show that the ramification index of
z: X—> S2 at the point corresponding to (z0, w0) is one more than the
order of the meromorphic function
w) at (z0, w0).
With Y = S2 and f: X—> Y the mapping given by z, and with
p: X°—3 1' = Y \ S the covering space obtained by throwing away the
branch points, consider the three groups:
Aut(X°/Y°) = {continuous p: x°—>X°: p°p =
Aut(X/Y)
{analytich:X—*X:foh=h};
Aut(M(X)/C(z))
{field homomorphisms -&: M(X)—*M(X):
is
the identity on C(z)}.
The first is topological, the second analytic, the third algebraic. We
claim that they are the same, after reversing the order of multipli-
cation in the third group:
Aut(X°/r)
Aut(X/Y)
Exercise 20.10. Prove this by showing that every deck transformation
p extends uniquely to an analytic isomorphism h, and showing that
every automorphism of M(X) that is the identity on C(z) has the form
for a unique h. If you know some Galois theory, show that
M(X) is a Galois extension of C(z) if and only if the covering X° of
Y° is a regular covering. Show that the Riemann surfaces of two al-
gebraic curves are isomorphic if and only if their fields of mero-
morphic functions are isomorphic C-algebras. Show that for any finite
group G there is a Galois extension L of C(z) whose Galois group
isG.
In fact, for a given compact Ricmann surface Y, to give a compact
Riemann surface X with a nonconstant analytic map from X to Y is
equivalent to giving a finite-sheeted topological covering x°—÷ Y° of
the complement of a finite set, or to specify a finite extension M(X)
of the field M(Y) of meromorphic functions. In this setting, the sim-
ilarity seen in Proposition 13.23 between coverings and field exten-
sions is more than just an analogy.
In most expositions the Riemann surface of a polynomial is con-
structed, following Weierstrass, by starting with a germ of an analytic
function w(z) satisfying the equation F(z, w(z))
0, and analytically

continuing it around the plane. This approach, however, does not take
advantage of the fact that the algebraic curve C is already, except for
the modification and addition of a finite number of points, the desired
Riemann surface.
Problem 20.11. Carry out this construction, using the ideas of § lôb,
and show that it gives the same Riemann surface.
20c. Holomorphic and Meromorphic I -Forms
For any differentiable surface, as in Chapter 9, we can consider not
just real differentiable 1-forms but complex ones as well, where a
complex 1-form is given by w1 + ho2, with w1 and w2 real 1-forms.
Again we can consider closed and exact forms, with w1 + iw2 being
closed (resp. exact) when each of
and w2 is closed (resp. exact).
The corresponding group of closed complex 1-forms modulo exact
complex 1 -forms is denoted H '(X; C). It is a complex vector space,
which can be identified with H '(X)
iH '(X). If X is compact of ge-
nus
H1(X;C) is a complex vector space of dimension
When X is a compact Riemann surface, and not just a differentiable
surface, there are some special closed complex 1 -forms, called holo-
morphic 1-forms. They are the 1-forms that in local coordinates
with UQCC, have the form
idLY) =(UadX
i(vadx+ ujiy),
where
=fa(' + iy) = ujx, y) + iva(x, y) is an analytic function. To
define a global 1-form, using the notation of § 19a, we must have
fcr@) =
on
where
=
dz
is the complex derivative. As before, the Cauchy—Riemann equations
öua/äx =
and
=
say that such a 1-form is closed.
The holomorphic 1-forms form a complex vector space, sometimes
denoted f1"°(X), or just fi)°. A holomorphic 1-form w is exact pre-
cisely when there is an analytic function g on X with dg = w. In par-
ticular, if X is compact, every analytic function is constant, and so if
w is exact, then w
0. This means that the natural map from fl'° to
H'(X; C) is injective. We regard
as a complex subspace of H'(X; C).

20c. 1-lolomorphic and Meromorphic 1-Forms
285
There is also a notion of an antiholomorphic 1 -form. This is a 1-form
that locally has the form
=
with fa = Ua + lVa an analytic function as above. Again these form a
complex vector space, denoted
or fl°1, and again these are
closed forms, and the only antiholomorphic forms which are exact
are differentials of complex conjugates
of complex analytic func-
tions. Again, for X compact, we regard fl°' as a subspace of H'(X; C).
It follows readily from the definitions that no nonzero 1-form can
be both holomorphic and antiholomorphic: flt.0 fl flO.l = 0. For any
surface X the space H'(X; C) has a complex conjugation operator, that
takes w = w1 + iw2 to
=
— ho2. This is not a complex linear map,
but is conjugate linear: it is linear as a map of real spaces, and for
a complex number c, ?Zö = ëth. Complex conjugation takes fl'° to fl°'
and
to ftt°. The following is one of the major "existence theo-
rems" about compact Riemann surfaces:
Theorem. Fora compact Riemann surfaceX, H'(X;C) =ft°EBfl°'.
Equivalently, dim(ff'°) = dim(fl°3) =
In light of the preceding paragraph, the theorem is equivalent to
showing that there are
linearly independent holomorphic 1-forms
on X. We will say nothing about the proof of this theorem for a gen-
eral compact Riemann surface, except to say that producing such I -
forms is closely related to producing meromorphic functions, which
we have already discussed. For example, if W1 and w2 are two in-
dependent holomorphic 1-forms, then W2 =f w1, where f is a non-
constant meromorphic function. When the Riemann surface comes
from an algebraic curve, however, we will prove this theorem in the
next chapter. If the curve has a sufficiently nice form, however, it
can be proved directly, as in the following problems:
Problem 20.12. Suppose F(Z, W) =
is the polynomial
as in §20a, and assume: (i) the curve C is nonsingular, i.e., there are
no points (z0, w0) at which F,
and
all vanish; and (ii) the degree
of a•(Z) as a polynomial in Z is at most i, and if
is the coefficient
of Z' in a1, the equation
= 0 has n distinct roots. (a) Show
that X has n points over
E S2. (b) Show that h =
w) has a pole
of order n — I at each of these n points. (c) Show that the genus of

I )(n — 2)/2. (d) Show that
Ig(z,w)

mostn—3inzandw
which is a complex vector space of dimension g),.
The following problem generalizes this to allow the curve C to have
the simplest possible singularities: simple nodes. A node is a point
where the two partial derivatives vanish, but the Hessian
(_a2i'

is not zero. Geometrically, this means the curvc C has two nonsin-
gular branches that cross transversely; in particular, there are two points
of the Riemann surface over a node of C. The corresponding picture
of a real curve (W2 = Z2 + Z1) is:
Problem 20.13. Generalize the preceding problem to allow C to have
a certain number a of nodes, but no other singularities, but continue
to assume (ii). Show that the genus of X is (n — 1)(n — 2)/2 —3, and
that the holomorphic 1-forms on X are exactly those that have the
form (g(z,
w)) dz where g is a polynomial of degree at most
n — 3 in z and w that vanishes at the nodes of C.
It is an important fact from the theory of algebraic curves that, after
suitable algebraic transformations, every algebraic curve can be put
in the form considered in the preceding problem. Note that it is nec-
essary to allow singularities, since not every genus has the form
(n — I)(n — 2)/2. For a nice discussion of this, see Griffiths (1989).

20c. Holomorphic and Meromorphic I -Forms
287
One can also consider meromorphic i-forms on X, which can be
defined as for holomorphic I -forms, locally given by fa dz, but with
f, only required to be meromorphic. If to
is a meromorphic 1-form,
the order of to at a point P, denoted
is defined to be the order
of vanishing off, at the corresponding point in a coordinate disk. For

example, when X=S, and todz

to has a pole of order 2 at the point at infinity. In general, we have

compact Riemann surface X,

on a compact Riemann surface X, then
Res,(w) = 0.
PEX
Proof. We know that we can realize X as a polygon H with sides
identified. From the construction we see that the map from H to X
can be taken to be differentiable, and, moving the sides slightly, we
may assume the image of each side is disjoint from the set of poles
of w. The 1-form w then determines a closed 1-form of on II, and
we must show that the sum of the integrals of (0' around small circles
around the poles of of is zero. Corollary 9.12 implies that this sum
is the same as the integral of W' around the boundary of 11, and this
integral vanishes since the integrals over the sides that get identified
in X cancel in pairs.

Riemann's Bilinear Relations and the Jacobian
We have seen that the space 1l'°(X) of holomorphic 1-forms on X is
a subspace of the De Rham group H'(X;C). The way fl'°(X) sits in
C) is important both in studying functions on X and in studying
the moduli of Riemann surfaces of given genus. Here we indicate how
some of this is related to the facts about homology that we proved in
Chapter 18. For this we use the pairing (to, v) = ffxtoAv defined on
closed 1-forms and their cohomology classes, but extended linearly
to those with complex coefficients as usual. When applied to holo-
morphic 1-forms, there are two simple consequences of the definition:
(i) (to, v) = 0
if to and v are holomorphic; and
(ii)
(to, uS) >0
if to is nonzero and holomorphic.
The first follows from the fact that dzAdz = 0. For the second, if, in
local coordinates, to=f(z) dzf(z)(dx+idy), then

itive.
Taking a basis a

This gives a (g X g)-matrix of complex numbers Z =

(normalized) period matrix corresponding to the homology basis. This
matrix Z is far from arbitrary. It follows from what we have just seen
that Z is nonsingular. Moreover,

The matrix lm(Z) whose entries are the imaginary parts of the entries

Of course, the period matrix is not unique, depending as it does
on the choice of a homology basis, but if another basis is chosen,
with the same intersection numbers, they will differ by a nonsingular
matrix with integral entries that preserves this intersection pairing.
As in the plane, integrals between two points on X are determined
up to these periods. Periods also play a role in a fundamental theorem
of Abel, which concerns the question of when one can find a mero-
morphic function on a given Riemann surface with zeros and poles
of given orders at given points.

by A, then the quotient space (and group) U/A is called the Jacobian
of X, and denoted J(X); it is homeomorphic to

zero cycle D =

only if its degree

D is the boundary of a 1-chain y such that
w = 0 for all holomorphic
1-forms w. We will also prove the Jacobi inversion theorem that the
Abel—Jacobi map from Z0X to J(X) is surjective.
20e. Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curves
Before turning to the general situation it may be helpful to work out
the simplest nontrivial case in detail. Consider a Riemann surface of
the form C/A, where A is a lattice. By Exercise 19. 17 we may choose

292
20. Riemann Surfaces and Algebraic Curves
such a lattice to be generated by 1 and T, where T is in the upper half
plane. Realizing X by identifying the sides of the parallelogram
the images of the indicated sides can be taken as the standard basis
a1 and h1 for H1X. Now X has a natural holomorphic I-form to, whose
pull-back to C is just the I-form dz, with z the standard coordinate
on C. The integral of to along a1 is clearly 1, and the integral of to
along h1 is 'r. (Note that the corresponding period matrix is Z = (T),
in agreement with Corollary 20.22.) The mapping from 111X to C =
has image A generated by 1 and 7. Fix the point P0 in X to
be the image of the origin in C. The Abel—Jacobi mapping from X
to C/A then takes a point P to [P — P0] =
By looking at this
mapping on the parallelogram spanned by 1 and -r, we see that this
mapping is an isomorphism, i.e.,
Now suppose X is any compact Riemann surface of genus I, which
we assume to have a nonzero holomorphic I-form to. We have the
mapping H1X—>C taking a homology class 'y to Lto. The image is
a lattice A in C. If we take a basis a1, b1 for I-11X as usual, we can
take to so that fato
1, in which case A is generated by
1 and
=
to. As a very special case of Corollary 20.22 it follows that i
is in the upper half-plane. Fix a point P0 in X.
Proposition 20.25. The Abel—Jacobi mapping
X —÷ C/A,
P
[P-P0j =
to,
iF0
is an isomorphism of X with C/A.
Proof. Since the Abel—Jacobi mapping is analytic and nonconstant,
it is unramified by the Riemann—Hurwitz formula, and therefore a
covering map. We know from Chapter 13 that all finite coverings of
C/A are given by subgroups of the fundamental groups, which means
that X has the form C/A', where A' C A is a subgroup of finite index.

20e. Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curves
293
But we proved directly that for any X of this form, thc Abel—Jacobi
map is an isomorphism.
If a Riemann surface X is a two-sheeted covering of S2 with four
branch points, then by the Riemann—Hurwitz formula it has genus 1.
By changing the map by an automorphism of
one can take these
four branch points to be 0, 1,
and another X E C. It follows easily
(see below for a more general situation) that X is the Riemann surface
of the curve W2=Z(Z— l)(Z—X). Since dz/w is a holomorphic 1-
form on this Riemann surface, we know from what we have just seen
that if we fix P0 on X, the map
dz
P0W
l)(zX)
gives an isomorphism from X to C/A. We will see that every Rie-
mann surface of genus 1 is isomorphic to those arising this way, at
least under the assumption that X comes from an algebraic curve.
Most complex analysis texts have a chapter on such "elliptic inte-
grals." (The Weierstrass p-function is used to find a two-sheeted
branched covering from C/A to
We end this brief excursion by looking at the special case of Rie-
mann surfaces that can be realized as two-sheeted branched coverings
of the sphere. By the Riemann—Hurwitz formula, such a covering
must have an even number of branch points, namely,
+ 2. By
Exercise 20.7, there is only one two-sheeted covering of
with a
given set of an even number of branch points. If these are the points
a1,

. . ,am in C, possibly together with the point cc (if m is odd),
this can be realized as the Riemann surface of the algebraic curve
W2_fJ(Z_aj) = 0.
These curves, and the corresponding Riemann surfaces, are called
hyperelliptic. All Riemann surfaces of genus 2 are in fact hyperellip-
tic, but for genus greater than 2, not all Riemann surfaces arise this
way.
The topology of a hyperelliptic surface can be seen directly, by

CHAPTER 21
The Riemann—Roch Theorem
21a. Spaces of Functions and 1-Forms
Fix a compact Riemann surface X, and let g =
be its genus, M its
field of meromorphic functions, and lithe space of meromorphic I -
forms on X. A divisor D =
on X is just another word for a 0-
chain. That is, it assigns an integer m1 to each point P in X, with
only finitely many being nonzero. We say that the order of D at P
is mp, and write
= mp. The divisors on X form an abelian
group. As for 0-chains, the degree of a divisor is the sum of the
coefficients: deg(D) =
If E =
is another divisor, we write
ED to mean that
for all P in X. A divisor D is called
effective if each coefficient mp is nonnegative, i.e., D0.
Any nonzero meromorphic function f on X determines a divisor
Div(f) =
Similarly, any nonzero meromorphic 1-form to on X determines a di-
visor
Div(w) =
Corollary 19.5 and Proposition 20.14 say that
deg(Div(f)) =
0
and
deg(Divfto)) = 2g—2.
Our goal in this chapter is to find meromorphic functions and I -forms
with prescribed, or at least controlled behavior. For example, we want
to find functions with poles only at certain points, and with the orders
295

296
21. The Riemann—Roch Theorem
of poles at these points not exceeding some bounds. For a divisor
on X let
L(D) =
= {fEM:Div(f)+D0}.
This set of functions L(D) is a complex subspace of M. Similarly, let
11(D) = {w Eli:
 m, for all P cx}
= {wEftDiv(w)D},
a complex subspace of 11. For example, 11(0) is thc space 11' ° of
holomorphic I -forms on X. Note that L(D) allows poles at the points
P where mp> 0, while 11(D) requires zeros at thc same points.

dim(11(D)/11(D + Q)) S 1.
(c) L(D) and 11(D) are finite-dimensional vector spaces.
Proof.
(a)
follows
from
the
fact
that
deg(Div(f)) = 0
and
deg(Div(0)) = 2g — 2. To prove (b), fix a local coordinate function z
at Q, and let m = ordQ(D). Any f in L(D + Q) has a local expression
with h holomorphic at 0. The map which assigns h(0) to
f determines a homomorphism of complex vector spaces from L(D + Q)
to C,
whose
kernel
is exactly L(D). This shows that either
L(D) = L(D + Q) or the quotient L(D + Q)/L(D) is one dimensional.
Similarly, any w in 11(D) has a local expression h(zjzmdz for h hol-
omorphic, and assigning h(0) to w determines a map from 11(D) to
C whose kernel is 11(D + Q).
It follows from (b) that L(D) is finite dimensional if and only if
L(D + Q) is finite dimensional. Since one can get from any D to a
divisor of negative degree by a finite number of subtractions of a
point, the fact that L(D) is finite dimensional follows from (a). Sim-
ilarly for 11(D), one can add points until the degree gets larger than
2g—2.

Exercise 21.2. TfDSE, show that
dim(L(E)) — dim(L(D)) S deg(E) — deg(D).
One sees from the preceding proof that dim(L(D)) S deg(D) + I.

21a. Spaces of Functions and I-Forms
297
For example, L(0) = C has dimension 1. If D = Q is a point, however,
we see from Exercise 20.7 that L(Q) is also C unless
X = S2, show that dim(L(D)) = deg(D) + I when-
ever deg(D)  — 1.
Lemma 21.4. (a) For any nonzero meromorphic function f and any
divisor D,
dim(L(D)) = dim(L(D + Div(f))).
(b) For any nonzero meromorphic 1-form w and any divisor D,
dim(ul(D)) = dim(L(Div(w) — D)).
Proof. We have isomorphisms
L(D) —> L(D + Div(f)),
h
h
and
L(Div(o4—D)
11(D),
h
hOw,
from which the lemma follows.
Although it has been fairly easy to get an upper bound for the size
of L(D), it is not so easy to get lower bounds, i.e., to show that there
must be functions with given poles. When X comes from an algebraic
curve, however, Proposition 20.8 gives a first step, for at least one
divisor. Take z: X—> S2 as in that proposition, and let F be the divisor
of poles of z, that is,
F = E
z(P)x
This is a divisor of degree n on X, where n is the degree of the map-
ping z.
Lemma 21.5. For this divisor F, there is a constant k such that for
all integers m,
dim(L(mE))  deg(mE)+l—k = mn+l—k.
Proof. We need the following fact: for any meromorphic function h
on X, there is a nonzero polynomial p(z) in C[zJ and an integer t so
that p(z) h is in L(tF). To prove this, we need only find p(z) so that
p(z) h has no poles outside F, and one sees that 1 l(z —
the product over all P such that z(P)
oo and
<0, is such a
polynomial.

298
21. The Riemann—Roch Theorem
We saw in Proposition 20.8 (see Lemma C. 19) that M is a vector
spacc over C(z) of dimension n. By the fact proved in the preceding
paragraph, we can find a basis h1
for M ovcr C(z) and an
integer t so that each h1 is in L(tE). Now for m=t+s, s0, the
means that, for such m, the dimension of L(mE)
is
at least
(m—t+
1—k for some constant k. Increasing k ifnec-
essary, one may also achieve this inequality for the finite number of
m with 0  m C t. The inequality is automatic for in C 0 and any k  0,
so the lemma is proved.
LI
Lemma 21.6. There are integers k and N so that
dim(L(D))  deg(D) + 1 — k
for all divisors D on X, with equality
dim(L(D)) = deg(D)+ I —k
if deg(D)N.
Proof. Choose E as above, and define k to be the smallest integer so
that Lemma 21.5 holds for k. Suppose that D is a divisor on X such
that D  mE for some integer m. It follows from Exercise 21.2 that

which proves the required inequality for such a divisor D. Given any
divisor D on X, there is a nonzero meromorphic function h such that
D — Div(h)

one can take h to be fl(z —
z(P)
cc• Then by Lemma 21 .4(a) and the result just proved,
dim(L(D)) = dim(L(D — Div(h)))
deg(D—Div(h))+l—k=deg(D)+I—k.
By the minimality of k, there is some divisor D0 such that the di-
mension of L(D0) is deg(D0) + I — k. From Exercise 21.2 it follows
that for any divisor D such that D  D0,
dim(L(D)) S deg(D) + dim(L(D0)) — deg(D0) s deg(D) + 1 —
so dim(L(D)) = deg(D) + I — k for any such D.
Let N = deg(D0) + k. If the degree of D is at least N, then the degree
of D — D0 is at least k, so the dimension of L(D — D0) is at least
k + 1 — k = 1. There is therefore a nonzero function f in L(D — D0).
which means that D + Div(f) 
and so
dim(L(D)) = dim(L(D + Div(f)))

There can be only one integer k with the second property in the
lemma, so k depends only on the Riemann surface X. We will see in

Lemma 21. 1(b) says that each of the two subspaces L(D) C L(D + Q)
and 11W + Q) C 11(D) are either equalities or subspaces of codimen-
sion one. These cannot both be subspaces of codimension one, for if
to is in 111(D) andf is in L(D + Q),
to is a meromorphic 1-form
with at most one simple pole at Q; the Residue Formula then implies
that ResQ(f to) = 0, which means that
to does not have a pole at
Q, and hence either to is in f1(D + Q) orf is in L(D). We will even-
tually see that one of these inclusions is an equality exactly when the
other is not, and this is the core of the proof of the Riemann—Roch
theorem. What we will do in this section is to prove a kind of local
version of this assertion.
For a point P in X, let us denote by
the germs of meromorphic
functions at P. These germs are defined as in §lôb, by taking equiv-
alence classes of meromorphic functions in neighborhoods of P, two
being equivalent if they agree on some (punctured) neighborhood of
P. If z is a local coordinate at P. any such germ has a unique power
series expansion Z_manf. 1ff is in

form on X, the residue

the integral off to around a small counterclockwise circle around P.
In local coordinates,f to can be written

Define an adele on X to be the assignment of a germfp of a mero-
morphic function at P for every point P in X, with the property that
is holomorphic at?) for all but finitely many?.
We write f
(J'p) for the adele defined by such a collection of func-
tionsfp. These adeles form a complex vector space, which we denote
by R. Any meromorphic functionf on X determines an adele, by as-
signing the germ of f at P to each P, so the field M of meromorphic
functions is a subspace of R. An adele can be thought of as a kind
of "discontinuous function" on X. Since there is no relation between
the "values"fp at different points of X, it is remarkable that they can
be a useful tool.
If f =

Then p0, is an clement of this space ft'(D). What we have done is
construct a natural homomorphism from 11(D) to uI'(D), taking to to
In the next section we will show that this homomorphism is an
isomorphism.
Exercise 21.7. Show that the homomorphism from [1(D) to [1'(D) is
injective, and that a meromorphic I-form to is in 11(D)

In this section we prove that [1(D) has some properties we would
like 11(D) to have. As in the preceding section, the main idea is to
compare [1(D) and 11'(D + Q) for Q a point in X.
Since R(D) is contained in R(D + Q), there is a canonical surjection
from R/(R(D)+M) onto R/(R(D+Q)+M),
i.e., from S(D)
onto
S(D + Q). The kernel is (R(D + Q) + M)/(R(D) + M).

the
preceding
lemma,
this
means
that
R(D+Q)CR(D)+M. Continuing to add points to D+Q, we see
that R(E) C R(D) + M for all divisors E such that E  D. But any ele-
ment of R is in R(E) for some such F, so R = R(D) + M, which
proves (a).
For (b),

that S(E) is zero. Lemma 21 .8 implies that the kernel of each of these

morphism or its cokernel has dimension one. By the preceding lemma,
we see that the latter occurs exactly when L(D) = L(D + Q), which
proves (c).
For (d), there is a natural isomorphism from R(D + Div(f)) to R(D)
that takes 1 tofr f. This determines an isomorphism from S(D + Div(f))
to 5(D), and, taking duals, from fl'(D) to ft'(D + Div(f)).

Lemma 21.10. For any divisor D on X,
dim(L(D)) = deg(D)+ I —k+dim(Ik'(D)).
Proof. This equation is certainly true if deg(D)  N, with N as in
Lemma 21.6, for then dim(L(D)) = deg(D) + I — k and dim(if (D)) =0
by Lemma 21.6 and Lemma 21.9(a). Since we can get between any
two divisors by successively adding and subtracting points, it suffices
to show that the equation is true for a divisor D
if and only if it is
true for D + Q, where Q is any point. Comparing the two equations,
what must be proved is that
dim(L(D + Q)) — dim(L(D)) + dimffl'(D)) — dim(if(D + Q)) = I,
and this is simply a translation of (c) in the preceding lemma.

Let 11' be the union of all fl'(D), taken over all divisors D. An
element of [1' is a homomorphism from R to C which vanishes on M
and vanishes on some (unspecified) R(D). The space fl of mero-
morphic differentials on X maps to 11', and we want to see that this
is an isomorphism. We have seen that if w is any nonzero mero-
morphic differential, any other can be written in the form
w for
some meromorphic functionf. This means that 11 is a one-dimensional
vector space over the field M. The space if is also a vector space
over M, by the rule that iff is in M and p:
the
homomorphism which takes f to
f).
Lemma 21.11. The dimension of 171' over M is 1.
Proof. We know that 171' is not zero, for example, by applying the
preceding lemma for D of small degree to see that 1l'(D)
0. To
complete the proof we must show that two elements p and tji in if
cannot be independent over M. If this were the case, then for any
elements h1,
.

.
,
of M which are independent over C, it would
follow that h1p,
.
.
.
, h,,p, h1i.i,

.
.
, h,,4, are elements of 11' which
are independent over C. Take a divisor E which is large enough so
that p and iji are in f1'(E). Suppose the functions
are a basis for
L(D) for some D. Then the 2n products
and h1'4, are in 11'(E — D).

so
dim(fl'(E—D))  2dim(L(D))  2(deg(D)+ 1—k).
By Lemma 21.10,
dimUI'(E— D)) =
k —
1
— deg(E—D) + dim(L(E— D)).
Now deg(E—D) = deg(E)—deg(D), and L(E—D)=0 provided
deg(E — D) <0. So if we take any D with deg(D) > dcg(E), the dis-
plays lead to the inequality
which says that deg(D)
3k — 3 — deg(E). But we may take D of
arbitrarily large degree, which is a contradiction.
The canonical homomorphism from the space 11 of meromorphic
differentials to the space Il' is a homomorphism of vector spaces over
the field 44. It is not identically zero by Exercise 21.7, since one can
certainly find meromorphic differentials w and adeles f such that there
is exactly one point P at which
has a simple pole. But since
both vector spaces have dimension one over M, it follows that the
map f1—>f1' is an isomorphism. We saw at the beginning that the
subspace 11(D) of 11 is mapped into il'(D) by this map, and it follows
from Exercise 21.7 that 11(D) maps isomorphically onto 11(D). So
we have proved
Proposition 21.12. The canonical map
11(D) is an iso-
morphism.

21c. Riemann—Roch
From Lemma 21.10 and Proposition 21.12 we have the formula
dim(L(D)) = deg(D) + I — k + dim(fl(D))
for all divisors D on X, valid for some integer k which we do not yet
know. We can specialize (*) to some cases where we know some-

304
21. The Riemann—Roch Theorem
thing. For example, if we take D = 0, L(O)
C, and the formula says
that I = 0 +
1 — k + dimffl(O)), i.e., that the space of holomorphic
1-forms has dimension k. Fix any meromorphic divisor to, and let K
be the divisor of to, which we know is a divisor of degree 2g — 2.
Applying Lemma 21.4(b) with D = K, we get
dimffl(K)) = dim(L(K — K)) = dim(L(O)) = I,
and applying the same lemma with D = 0, we get
dim(L(K)) = dim(fl(0)) = k.
Now apply (*) with D = K, yielding
k = (2g—2)+l—k+l,
which means that k must be g. So we have proved:
Theorem 21.14 (Riemann—Roch Theorem). IfX is the Riemann sur-
face of an algebraic curve, then for any divisor D on X,
dim(L(D)) = deg(D) +
1 — g + dim (11(D))
= deg(D)+l—g+dim(L(K—D)),
where K is the divisor of any nonzero meromorphic I-form on X.
Corollary 21.15. The space of holomorphic differentials has dimen-
sion g.
This proves that H'(X;C) =
Corollary 21.16. dim(L(D))  deg(D) +

with equality when-
ever deg(D)2g— I.
Corollary 21.17. For any two points P and Q on X, there is a mero-
morphic 1-form ço with simple poles at P and Q and no other poles.
Proof Riemann—Roch for D = —P — Q gives
0 = —2+l--g+dim(1k(—P—Q)),
or dim(1l(—P — Q)) = g + I. This means that there is a meromorphic
I-form p that is in fl(—P — Q) but not in 11(0). Since the sum of the
residues is zero, p must have simple poles at both P and Q, with the
residue at Q being minus the residue at P.
Corollary 21.18. If gx = 0, then X is isomorphic to S2.
Proof Take any point P. Since dim(L(P))  deg(P) + I — g = 2, there

21c. Riemann—Roch

is a nonconstant meromorphic function f with at most one pole. This
is a mapping from X to S2 of degree I, so is an isomorphism.

up to multiplying by a nonzero scalar and adding a holomorphic 1-
form. Show that there is a unique such p whose residue at P is 1,
whose residue at Q is — 1, and so that
p is purely imaginative for

Exercise 21.22. A real-valued function u on a Riemann surface is
harmonic if it is locally the real part of an analytic function. A func-
tion which is harmonic in a punctured neighborhood of a point P is
said to have a logarithmic pole at P if, with z a local coordinate at
P, there is a nonzero real scalar a so that u —
extends to be
harmonic in a neighborhood of P. Show that for any two points P
and Q on X, there is a harmonic function U on X\{P,Q} that has
logarithmic poles at P and Q.
Exercise 21.23. For any point P on X, show that there is a mero-
morphic differential p on K with a double pole at P. Deduce that there
is a harmonic function u on X \ {P} so that, if z = x + iy is a local
coordinate at P, then u — x/(x2 + y2) is harmonic near P.
Historically, the arguments went in the reverse order: harmonic
functions were found with the properties in the preceding exercises,
and these were used to find meromorphic 1-forms and to prove Rie-
mann—Roch. By regarding harmonic functions as integrals of fluid
flows or electric fields on X, one can give intuitive arguments for
their existence, say by putting sources and sinks at the points P and
Q. For a lively discussion along these lines, see Klein (1893).

21d. The Abel—Jacobi Theorem
In this section we prove the assertions made in §20d. The first is
Abel's criterion for when a divisor /3 =
is a divisor of a mero-
morphic function: it must have degree zero and be in the kernel of
the Abel—Jacobi map. We use the notation of that section.
Theorem 21.28 (Abel's Theorem). There is a meromorphic function
f on X with Div(f) = /3 if and only if deg(D) = 0 and [/3] = 0 in J(X).
We first sketch the proof of the necessity of these conditions. Sup-
posef is a nonconstant meromorphic function on X, giving a mapping
of degree n from X to 52, with branch set S. Corollary 19.5 shows

21d. The Abel—Jacobi Theorem
307
that deg(Div(f)) = 0. Fix a point P0 in X. Consider the mapping from
\ S to J(X) that takes a point Q to the point
[P, — P0], where
P1
.
.
.
,
are the points of X inT'(Q). It is not hard to see that
this extends continuously to the branch points, giving a continuous
mapping from
to J(X). Since 52 is simply connected, by Propo-
sition 13.5 this mapping factors:
Cs/A. By looking locally,
one can verify that each of the g coordinate maps are analytic func-
tions on
But analytic functions on
are constant, so the given
map from
to J(X) must be constant. The fact that the value at 0
is
equal
to
the
value
at
is
precisely
the
condition
that
=
=0 in J(X).
We turn now to the converse. Let D be a divisor of degree zero in
the kernel of the Abel—Jacobi map. We must show that D is the divi-
sor of a meromorphic function. The motivation for the proof comes
from the fact that if f is a meromorphic function on X, and we set
p = df/f, then p is a meromorphic differential on X with at most sim-
ple poles and, in fact, for any P,
= ord1(f). We will look for
a meromorphic J -form p with at most simple poles among the points
appearing in D, such that
= ord,(D) for all P. Then we will
define a function f on X by the formula f(P) =
where P0
is a fixed point. Provided this is well defined, it will satisfy the equa-
tion p = df/f, and so we will have
=
for all P, so
Div(f) = D.
Since the degree of D is zero, we may write D =
— Q3, for
some
points
P,

Let

Let p =
p,. We want to
define f(P) =
p), where the integral is along any path from P0
to P in X\S. This will be well defined provided the integral of p
along any closed path 7 in X \ S is in 2'rril. The form p is only defined
up to the addition of a holomorphic 1-form, so the proof of the Abel—
Jacobi theorem is reduced to the
Claim 21.29. There is a holomorphic l-Jbrm w so that
— w) is
in 2iri7L for all I-cycles ronX\S.
We need the following refinement of Exercise 18.8. We take 2g
closed arcs a1 and b1 as in § 1 7c. Cutting the surface open along these
arcs, we realize it as the identification space of a plane polygon H
with sides identified. These choices can be made so that the map from
II to X is a diffeomorphism on the interior of H, and has a
exten-

308
21. The Riemann—Roch Theorem
sion to a neighborhood of Ii. By means of this map 1-forms on X
correspond to 1-forms on H. Let w be a closed 1-form on X, and
define a function h on the closure of H by the formula h(P) =
for some fixed point P0 in UI. Let p be a closed 1-form defined on a
neighborhood of the union of these 2g arcs in X, so p determines a
1-form on a neighborhood of the boundary all of H.

We can now prove Claim 21.29. Since a basis of H1(X \ 5) is given
by the cycles a1, b1, and small circles around the points in S (either
by Mayer—Vietoris or Problem 17. 12), it suffices to find a holo-
morphic I -form cv such that the integral of p — cv around all these
cycles is in 2'rril. Note that for any such p, the integral around a
small circle around a point in S is in 2'rril, since all the residues of
p are integers. To start, let A3 =
p. Subtracting the holomorphic
1-form fl1cv1 from p, we can assume that

ceding formula, with cv = t0k. gives

This means that we have an exact sequence
which realizes the torus J(X) = Cs/A as the quotient of the group of
divisors of degree zero by the subgroup of divisors of meromorphic
functions.
The proof, which we only sketch, requires a few basic facts about
holomorphic mappings of several complex variables. Let

fold Cartesian product of X with itself, which is a g-dimensional com-
plex manifold. Let

is a local isomorphism.

PART XI
HIGHER DIMENSIONS
This last part is designed to introduce the reader to a few of the higher-
dimensional generalizations of the ideas we have studied in earlier
chapters, both to unify these ideas, and to indicate a few of the di-
rections one may go if one continues in algebraic topology. It is not
written as the culmination or goal of the rest of the course, but rather
as a brief introduction to the general theory. How accessible or useful
it may be depends on several factors, such as background in manifold
theory, and ability to generalize from the special cases we have seen
to higher dimensions (an ability, it seems to me, often underestimated
in our teaching). For systematic developments of the ideas of this
part, the books of Bredon (1993), Bott and Tu (1980), Greenberg and
Harper (1981), and Massey (1991) are recommended.
We have studied the first homology group H1X, the fundamental
group ir1(X, x), and the first Dc Rham cohomology group H 'X, which
were sufficient to capture most of the topology of the spaces we have
been most concerned with: open sets in the plane and surfaces, and
an occasional graph. Each of these is the first in a sequence of groups
that are used to study similar questions for higher-dimensional spaces.
In contrast to many earlier chapters, the tone in this final part is de-
signed to be more formal, concise, and abstract; we are depending
on your experience with special cases and low-dimensional examples
for motivation.
We start by recalling some three-dimensional calculus, to indicate
the sort of "topology" these higher groups might measure. Then we
take a quick look at knots in 3-space, mainly because knot theory is

314
Part XI. Higher Dimensions
an interesting and important subject in its own right, and also because
it gives us a chance to use some of the tools developed in earlier
chapters. We also define the higher homotopy groups of a space and
the De Rham cohomology groups.
In the next chapter we define higher homology groups, and prove
their basic properties. We indicate some of the ways they can be used
to extend ideas we have looked at in the plane or on surfaces to higher
dimensions. In particular, they give a simple extension of the notion
of degree, and they lead to generalizations of the Jordan curve theo-
rem.
In the final chapter we include a couple of "diagram chasing" facts
from algebra, one of which can be used to compare different ho-
mology and cohomology groups, the other to construct long exact
sequences such as Mayer—Vietoris sequences. (Having proved this
once and for all, one does not have to keep doing the same sort of
manipulations we have done to define boundary and coboundary maps.)
Finally, we give proofs of the basic duality theorems between ho-
mology and Dc Rham eohomology on manifolds.
The sections involving higher De Rham cohomology on manifolds
are written for those with a working knowledge of differential forms
on differentiable manifolds. A reader without this background can
skip or skim this part (or stick to low dimensions and/or open sets
in R'1). The construction of higher homology groups and its appli-
cations to higher-dimensional analogues of the theorems we saw at
the beginning of the course do not depend on any of this, however,
and a reader who has mastered the earlier chapters should be able to
work through this without any gaps. We have included Borsuk's theo-
rem that maps of spheres that preserve antipodal pairs have odd de-
gree, since this allows generalizing all the results we proved about
winding numbers to higher dimensions.
A few remarks about other approaches may be in order. It is pos-
sible to define the degree of a mapping of a sphere to itself without
the notions of homology, and to prove many of its properties. Those
with a knowledge of differential topology can do this by approxi-
mating a continuous map by a differentiable one, and following the
pattern of Problem 3.32 for the winding number. (For a nice discus-
sion in the
context, see Milnor (1965)). There are also elementary
approaches using simplieial approximations, although considerable care
is required to make the arguments rigorous. (In fact, the difficulties
in this approach seem to us much greater than those involved in de-
veloping general homology theory—not to mention the fact that, hav-
ing done the latter, one can apply it in many other situations.)

Part XE. Higher Dimensions
315
We might also mention that we have used cubes rather than the
simplices that are common in many other treatments. Simplices have
a slight advantage that one has no "degenerate" maps to ignore, but
cubes are simpler for homotopies and product spaces in general, and
they are more convenient for integrating differential forms. (In fact,
it is not hard—as we do in §24d—to use cubes to calculate the sim-
plicial homology of spaces that are triangulated.)
Finally, a word on terminology: here manifolds always are assumed
to have a countable basis for their topology.


CHAPTER 22
Toward Higher Dimensions
22a. Holes and Forms in 3-Space
On an open set U in Ri we have: 0-forms, which are just cc functions
on U; 1-forms, which are expressions
p dx + q dy + r dz,
where p and q and r are cc functions on U; 2-forms, which are expres-
sions
u dy dz + v dx dz + w dx dy,
where u and v and w are
functions on U; and 3-forms, which are
expressions
h dx dy dz,
where h is a V function on U.
These forms are designed for integrating, just as in the plane. A 0-
form is evaluated at points. The integral of a 1-form over a differ-
entiable path
[a, b] —* U is defined exactly as for the plane:
qdy + rdz
=
where 'y(t) = (x(t),y(t), z(t)). A 2-form can be integrated over a dif-

ax/as ay/at — ax/at ay/as, and similarly for the other terms. A 3-
form is integrated over a differentiable map [I: B—> U where B is a
rectangular box [a,hj X jc,dl X [e,f 1:

where [T(s, t, u) = (x(s, t, u),y(s, I, u), z(s, t, u)), and a(x,y, z)/a(s, t, u)
denotes the Jacobian determinant.
The differential df of a 0-form f is a I -form defined by

The fundamental theorem of calculus gives

and Green's theorem (for rectangles in the plane) gives ff 4w = Li

where the integral around the boundary of the rectangle is defined as

d(udydz+vdxdz+wdxdy) = {——--+—Jdxdydz,

and Stokes theorem says that

Exercise 22.1. State and prove Stokes' theorem for a box, and define
the boundary of 11 as a sum and difference of the restrictions of II to
the six sides of the box, assigning correct signs to each so the above
formula holds.
We define the differential of a 3-form to be 0. A simple calculation

22a. Holes and Forms in 3-Space
319
using the equality of mixed derivatives shows that if f is a 0-form,
then d(df)=0, and if w is a I-form, then d(dw)=0. A k-form w is
closed if dco = 0, and exact if w =
for some (k — 1)-form ji. So all
exact forms are closed, and we have the same question as in the plane:
when are closed forms exact? We can define the De Rham groups
as before: for k = 0, 1, 2, or 3,
HAU = {closed k-forms on U}/{exact k-forms on U}.
The question becomes: How does the topology of U influence the size
of the vector spaces
For 1-forms, the answer is very similar to the case of open sets in
the plane. A closed 1-form w on U is exact if and only if integral of
w over paths in U depend only on the endpoints, or all integrals over
closed paths are zero. For example, if U is the complement of the z-
axis, the I-form o(—ydx+xdy)/(x2+y2) is closed but not exact;
as we know, an integral of w around a circle in the xy-plane is 2'rr.
Notice that taking a point or a closed ball out of W does not count
as a "hole" as far as I-forms in 3-space is concerned. In fact:
Exercise 22.2. Show that if 111U = 0 then every closed I-form on U
is exact.
For 2-forms, however, if U is the complement of a point, there are
closed forms that are not exact. For example, let
x dy dz — y dx dz + z dx dy
(0=
(x2 + y2 + z2)112
Exercise 22.3. Show that w is closed. Fix a positive number p, and
let F: [0, 2'rrj X
'/2'rrF> W be the spherical coordinate map-
ping, i.e.,
p) = (pcos(*) cos(p),
psin(p)).
Compute the integral of w over F, and deduce that co is not exact.
Exercise 22.4. Use this 2-form co to define the engulfing number around
0 of a differentiable map from S2 to
\ {0}. Can you prove any an-
alogues of the winding number?
We will see in the next chapter how to define second homology
groups H2U that have the same relation to 2-forms and H2U as the
first homology H1U has to 1-forms and H'U.
Some of these ideas may be more familiar in vector field language:

320
22. Toward Higher Dimensions
a 1-form pdx+qdy+rdz can be identified with the vector field
p1 + qj + rk, the 2-form udydz +vdxdz + wàxdy with the vector field
ui—vj+wk, and the 3-form hdxdydz with the function h. In this
language, the differential df of a function corresponds to the gradient
grad(f), the differential of a I-form to the curl of a vector field, and
the differential of a 2-form becomes the divergence of a vector field:

and the equations dod0 say that curlograd0 and divocurl=0.
The integral of the vector field corresponding to a 2-form over a sur-
face can be interpreted as the integral of a dot product with an out-
ward-pointing normal.
Problem 22.5. (a) Generalize the discussion of §2c to fluid flows on
open sets in 3-space. Interpret the engulfing number as the flux across
a surface of a flow with source at the origin (see Exercise 2.26).
(b) Define harmonic functions of three variables, and generalize Ex-
ercise 2.21 and Problems 2.22—2.25.
22b. Knots
A knot is a subset K of W or the 3-sphere S3 that is homeomorphic
to a circle. Call two knots equivalent if there is a homeomorphism of
(or S3) with itself that takes one homeomorphically onto the other,
and is orientation-preserving. (For a precise definition of "orientation-
preserving," see §23c.) A weaker notion is similarity, which is the
same except ignoring orientation, so "mirror image" knots are always
similar. The generalized Jordan curve theorem, which we will prove
in the next chapter, implies that the complement of X is connected,
that its first homology group is infinite cyclic, and its other homology
groups vanish. In particular, these groups are the same for all knots.
However, the fundamental group 'rr1(53 \ X) or 'rr1(R3 \ X) can some-
times be used to distinguish knots from each other. Note that these
fundamental groups are the same for similar knots, so they can be
used as a possible invariant.

22b. Knots
321
Exercise 22.6. If K C IV is a knot, and W is identified with the com-
plement of a point in S1, by stereographic projection, show that the
fundamental group of ER1 \ K is isomorphic to the fundamental group
of S1\K.
The standard embedding K =5' C ER? C ER? C
is called the trivial
knot, and any knot equivalent to this is called trivial. We want to use
fundamental groups to give one example of a knot that is not trivial.
We will do this by identifying
C
= C2 with the set of pairs (z, w)
of complex numbers such that
+
= I, and constructing a knot
K that is the intersection of
with a complex plane curve that has
a singularity at the origin. This is more than a convenient way to find
an example: the knots that arise this way are important invariants of
singularities of plane curves! In this language, the trivial knot can be
realized as the intersection of
with the "curve" w = 0.
Exercise 22.7. Show that the fundamental group of the complement
of the trivial knot is isomorphic to /. Show, in fact, that the circle
{(O, w):
= l} is a deformation retract of the complement of circle
{(z,O):
= l} in
In nature coverings often arise by starting with a mapping that is
not a covering, but becomes one after throwing away a locus where
it fails to be a covering. We have seen this for an analytic mapping
between Riemann surfaces in Chapter 19, where only a finite set had
to be thrown away. With appropriate hypotheses, such a mapping is
called a "branched covering," with the bad set the "branch locus."
Here is another example. Consider the mapping f: C2 —> C2 given by
the formulaf(u, v) = (u, v3 + uv). The inverse image of a point (z, w)
has three points if the equation v1 + zv = w has three distinct solutions
for the variable v, and one or two points otherwise.
Exercise 22.8. Show that f'(z, w) has three points if and only if
4z3 + 27w2
0. If 4z1 + 27w2 = 0, but (z, w)
(0,0), the inverse im-
age has two points, and for (z, w) = (0,0), the inverse image has one
point.
Let VC C2 be the plane curve 4z3 + 27w2 = 0, which is the branch
locus of the above mappingf. Let K be the intersection of V with
V = {(z,w):4z3+27w2=0},
K = VflS1.
We claim first that K is homeomorphic to a circle.

322
22. Toward Higher Dimensions
Exercise 22.9. Show that the mapping
where
a
is the positive solution to the equation 4a3 + 27a2 = 27
and
b =
is a homeomorphLsm of 5' onto K.
We will consider the mapping C2 \f'(V)—÷ C2 \ V determined by
f, and the restriction
p:Yr'(S3\K) — 53\KX,
(u,v)
s—> (u,v3+uv).
Take x
(1,0) as the base point in X, andy
(1,0) as the base point
in Y. Note thatp'(x)={(l,O),(l,i),(l, —i)}.
Claim 22.10. (1) p is a three-sheeted covering map; (2) Y is con-
nected; and (3) p is not a regular covering.
It follows from this claim that 'rr,(S3 \ K,x) is not abelian, since
every connected covering of a manifold with an abelian fundamental
group is regular. In particular, K is not a trivial knot. We leave the
proofs of (I )—(3) as exercises, with the following comments. The
essential point of (1) is showing that the roots of a polynomial are,
locally where the roots are distinct, continuous functions of the coef-
ficients. In fact, they are analytic functions, by the same argument
as in §20a. For (2), it suffices to show that the three points of f '(x)
can be connected by paths. Consider the loop -y(t) = (e2Wt, 0), 0  t s 1,
at x. This lifts to the loop
at y, and to the path
=
that goes from (I, i) to (1, —i) in
Y.
Exercise 22.11. Find a path of the form
= (X(t), ij4t)), Os ts
1,
with X(t) >0 and
 0 for all t, that goes from (1, 0) to (I, i) in Y.
This exercise shows that Y is connected, and since
is closed,
and
is not, the covering is not regular.
In fact, up to equivalence, K is an example of a torus knot. The
torus
sits
in
S3 by the mapping that takes (x,y) to
((1
(I
For any relatively prime pair of positive
integers p and q, the image in the torus of the line with equation
qy = px in W is a knot that winds p times around the torus one way
while it winds q times around the other way. This is called a torus
knot of type (p, q).
Exercise 22.12. (a) Show that the knot K = V fl
considered above
is equivalent to a torus knot of type (2, 3). (b) Show that for relatively
prime positive integers p and q the intersection of z" = wj" with
is
a torus knot of type (p, q).

22b. Knots
323
The Van Kampen theorem can be used to calculate the fundamental
group of the complement of any torus knot. The 3-sphere is the union
of two solid tori
A = {(z,w)ES3:
B =
so T = A fl B = {(z, w):
=
= 1/\ñ} is a torus.
Problem 22.13. If K is a torus knot of type (p, q) in T, show that
the fundamental groups of A \ K, B \ K, and T \ K are infinite cyclic,
and the generator of the fundamental group of T \ K maps to the pth
and qth powers of generators of the fundamental groups of A \ K and
B \ K. Apply the Van Kampen theorem to show that the fundamental
group of S3 \ K has two generators a and b, and one relation
=
i.e., the fundamental group is F2/N, where F2 is the free group on a
and b, and N is the least normal subgroup containing a'1
b".
For a knot of type (2, 3), for example, one can see again that this
group is not abelian by mapping it onto the symmetric group
on
three letters, sending a to the transposition (1 2) and b to the per-
mutation (1 2 3).
There are many knots that are not torus knots. For example, one
can take a torus knot, and take a small tube around it, which is ho-
meomorphic to another torus, and put a torus knot on this. Repeating
this construction arbitrarily often gives a class of knots which, re-
markably, are exactly the knots one gets from singularities of plane
curves. There are many other knots, however. Moreover, there are
some "wild" knots, such as "Antoine's necklace":
The fundamental group of the complement of this knot is not even
finitely generated. A piece of this is an embedding of a closed interval
in W such that the complement is not simply connected.

324
22. Toward Higher Dimensions
22c. Higher Homotopy Groups
The higher homotopy groups 'rrk(X, 4 are easier to define than higher
homology or cohomology groups, although their calculation turns out
to be far more challenging. Fix a base point S0 in the sphere S'<, say
the north pole:
.
.
. ,O,l). Define 'rrh(X,x) to be the set of
homotopy classes of maps from S'< to X that map
to x; here a ho-
motopy between two such maps must preserve basepoints throughout
the homotopy, i.e., H is a continuous map from
X
I] to X, with
x t) =x for all
1. One can also define 'rrk(X,x) as the set
of homotopy classes of maps from the standard k-cube P to X that
map the boundary of the cube to x, with homotopies also mapping
the boundary to x throughout.
Exercise 22.14. (a) Show that these two definitions agree by showing
that SL is homeomorphic to the space obtained by identifying all points
of the boundary of P to a point. (h) Show that
= 0 for all
k> 0 if X is contractible. (c) Show that a map f: X—> Y determines
maps
'rrh(X, 4—* ITL(Y,f(4), which are functorial, and that maps
that are homotopic through basepoint-preserving homotopies deter-
mine the same map on homotopy groups. (d) Show that
= 0
for O<k<n.
The sets
can be made into groups, much as for the fun-
damental group. Using the definition by cubes, one can "multiply"
two maps F and A from P to X, defining
A by using the first
coordinate:

Exercise 22.15. (a) Show that this operation is well defined on ho-
motopy classes, and makes 'rck(X,x) into a group. (b) Show that the
of Exercise 22.14 are homomorphisms of groups.
Problem 22.16. Show that, for all k> 1, the group
4 is abe-
han.
It is a fact that 'rr,,(S", So)
1, although this is quite a bit harder to
prove. Note that this gives a strong notion of degree for maps of S'7
to S'7: it defines the degree, and shows that maps are classified up to
homotopy by their degree. In the next chapter we will use chains to

define homology groups HA(X), which arc easier to calculate, and we
will show that
= / and
= 0 for all k> 0, k $ n. In stark
contrast with the homology groups, for k > n, the groups rrk(S", s0)
need not bc trivial.
Exercise 22.17. Identifying 51 with {Cz, w) E C:
+
= I }, show
that the map that takes (z, w) to w/z E C C
determines a continuous
mapping from
to S2.
It is a fact that 'rr3(S2, s0)
/, with generator given by the mapping
of the preceding exercise, which is called a Hopf mapping (see Hilton
(1961)). We will show in the next chapter that the fibers of the Hopf
mapping are circles that are "linked" togcther in
which is at least
an indication of the nontriviality of the Hopf map. It should be pointed
out, however, that in spite of enormous effort, which have produced
calculations of many special cases, the groups 'rrk(S", s0) are far from
known in general.
22d. Higher De Rham Cohomology
All of the discussion of §22a generalizes to n
variables, a k-form
being an expression

c n, with the coefficients
functions on an open set in W. There is a differential d that takes
ak-form to a(k+ 1)-form, and again d°d0. For U open in W one
then gets Dc Rham groups HkU, the space of closed k-forms modulo
the space of exact k-forms. The main complication is in keeping track
of the signs. This is best done by introducing formally the "exterior
algebra" structure that is already apparent in the plane and 3-space:
one allows the differentials to be written in arbitrary order, but put
in a sign whenever they are interchanged:
—dxdy, together
setting dxdx = 0. (The usual notation for this exterior product is the
wedge "A," so one writes dxAdy in place of our dxdy.) Working this
out properly belongs in an advanced calculus course.
As with surfaces, one can define k-forms on an arbitrary differ-
entiable manifold as collections of k-forms on the coordinate neigh-
borhoods of a chart that transform properly on overlaps. If you know
about differential forms on a manifold, it is not difficult to generalize

326
22. Toward Higher Dimensions
the idea of De Rham cohomology. Again there are differentials d from
k-forms to (k + 1)-forms, with d°d = 0. In this section we will assume
familiarity with notions of manifolds and differential forms. If this
applies to you, fine; if not, you can either stick to low dimensions
where we have done it by hand, or assume this formalism in gen-
eral—or you can turn immediately to the next chapter, which does
not depend on any of this.
If X is a differentiable manifold, one can define the De Rham co-
homology group HAX as the vector space of closed k-forms modulo
the subspace of exact k-forms. 1ff:
Y is a differentiable map,
there is a notion of pull-back of k-forms from Y to X, taking to on Y
to f*w on X. This commutes with the differential, so determines a
(functorial) homomorphism f*: i-P}'--÷ HLX.
Exercise 22.18. If X is a disjoint union of a finite or infinite number
of manifolds X,, show that HAX is the direct product of the
i.e.,
specifying a class on X is the same as specifying a class on each X,.
The fvlayer—Vietoris exact sequence is defined with almost no change
from the case with H° and H'. To define
&HL(UnV)
Ht(UUV),
as before, one uses a partition of unity subordinate to an open cov-
ering X= UU V by U and Vto write a closed k-form won Un V as
the difference pi1 —
of a k-form pi, on U and a k-form
on V;
there is a closed (k + 1)-form on U U V that is dpi, on U and dpi2 on
V, and this (k + 1)-form represents the image in HkI '(UU V) of the
class represented by to in Hk(U fl V). As before (and see §24a), one

The inverse isomorphism to

where s
is the embedding xF->x X 0 of X in X X
The problem is to show
that
os* = (sop)* is the identity. The idea of the proof is to con-
struct a linear map H from the space of k-forms on X x
to the space
of (k —
I )-forms on X X IlL for each k, such that for any form to on

(Note that the two H's and the two d's in this equation are defined
on different spaces of forms!) It follows that if to is closed, then
to — p*o
= d(H(to)), so to and
s*(to) define the same De Rham
cohomology class.
Problem 22.22. Show that any k-form to on X X 11 has a unique
expression as a sum of a k-form not involving di, where
t is the co-
ordinate on

Show that this operator is well defined and satisfies (22.21).
For any real number t, if s,: X—>X x 1k maps x to x X t, then, since

In particular, the maps

22e. Cohomology with Compact Supports
There is another way to use differential forms to construct coho-
mology groups, for open sets in W or any cc manifolds, which we
sketch briefly here. These cohomology groups are called De Rham
groups with compact supports, and denoted
the subscript c
standing for "compact." These are defined exactly as for the ordinary
De Rham groups, but using differential forms with compact support,
i.e., forms for which there is some compact set K contained in X such
that the form vanishes identically outside K. Define
to be the
quotient space of the closed k-forms with compact support by the
subspaee of forms that are differentials of (k — 1)-forms with compact
support.
If X is compact, of course, all forms have compact support, so
= HkX. Tn spite of this and the similarity of definition, however,
these groups are quite different on noneompact manifolds. For ex-
ample, locally constant functions on a noneompact connected space
can never have compact support unless they are identically zero:
= 0
if X is connected and not compact.
In fact, we will see that the theories
and
behave in an opposite,
or dual, way. By using a partition of unity as in Chapter 18, if X is
an oriented n-manifold, one can integrate an n-form with compact
support over the whole manifold. Using Stokes' theorem, it follows
similarly that the integral of the differential of a closed (n — 1)-form
with compact support is zero, so one has a map
wF->Jco.
It is easy to produce n-forms that are positive on a small piece of a
coordinate neighborhood, and zero elsewhere, to see that this map is
not zero. We will see in Chapter 24 that, if X is connected as well,
then this map is an isomorphism.
Exercise 22.24. If X is a disjoint union of a finite or infinite number
of open sets X1, show that
is the direct sum of the
i.e.,

22e. Cohomology with Compact Supports

specifying a class on X is the same as specifying a class on each
except that all but a finite number must be zero.
There is a Mayer—Vietoris exact sequence for cohomology with
compact supports, but it is different from that without supports. First
of all, there are no restriction maps, since if w has compact support
on an open set, its restriction to an open subset may no longer have
compact support. in fact, the maps go the other way: if U1 is an open
subset of U2, any k-form o with compact support on U1 extends by
zero outside U1 to define a k-form with (the same) compact support
on U2. Since any point in U2 \ U1 has a neighborhood not meeting the
support of w, this extension is
This extension commutes with the
differential map d, so determines a linear map
—*
In particular, for two open sets U and V, we have diagrams
H
We want to define a coboundary map
Given a class in
fl V), represent it by a closed k-form to with
compact supports. We can write to as a sum to1 + to,, with to1 and to2
k-forms with compact supports in U and V, respectively. In fact, if
+ 4', = lisa partition of unity subordinate to U and V, then to1 =
to
and
are such forms. Let sq be the (k+ 1)-form on UflV
that is (the restriction of) dto1. From the equation 0 = dto = c/to1 + dto2,
we have c/to1 = —dto2 on U fl V. so the support of sq is contained in
the intersection of the supports of to1 and to2. In particular, sq has
compact support on U fl V. Clearly 5q is closed. Set
6([to]) = [ii.
It is not hard to verify that this is independent of the choice, and it
is the familiar (by now) argument (and see §24a) to prove the
Mayer—Vietoris Theorem 22.25 (Compact Supports). For open sets
U and V in an n-dimensional manifold, there is an exact sequence

we need to compare a manifold X and X X
This time the projection

one can write a k-form with compact support of X x

a form not involving di, and a k-form
where p. is, in local
coordinates, a sum of expressions

(so forms not involving dt are mapped to zero). Note that these in-
tegrals are really over finite intervals, by the assumption of compact
support. One checks that this is well defined, and that p*(dw) = d(p*w).
so p* determines a map on cohomology classes as indicated, if
s: X—>X X

CHAPTER 23
Higher Homology
23a. Homology Groups
The groups H)( and H1X are the beginning of a series of abelian
groups HLX, defined for any topological space X. Define a k-cube in
X to be a continuous map F: JL_*X, where 11< is the k-dimensional
cube, i.e., 1= [0, 1], so
jL = [0,lJX
.
.
. X[0,fl c
For any such mapping F, and any integer i between I and k, and any
0 s
I, define a (k — 1)-cube a F, which is obtained by restricting
1' to the slice of the ith coordinate at s:
a;Ir(t,...,tk1)=F(t,...,tI
Call F degenerate if, for some i, 8T is a constant function of s, and
nondegenerate otherwise. (When k= I, F is a path, and degenerate
is the same as a constant path.) By convention, j0 = {0}, so as 0-cube
is given by a point in X; no 0-cube is regarded as degenerate.
Let CLX be the free abelian group on the nondegencrate k-cubes in
X, so an element of CLX is a finite linear combination
with
a k-cube in X and nQ an integer. An element of CLX is called a
cubical k-chain on X. It is useful to regard any finite linear combi-
nation
of arbitrary k-cubes as an element of CLX, by simply
discarding any degenerate k-cube
that appears. (In other words,
CLX is identified with the quotient of the free abelian group on all k-
cubes in X, modulo the subgroup generated by degenerate k-cubes.)
332

23a. Homology Groups
333
If F: P—÷X is a k-cube in X, its boundary di in CL_1X is defined
by the formula
or =
which is the sum of the 2k faces of F, each with a coefficient of + 1
or — 1. (Note that, even if F is nondegencrate, some of the
or
8,'F occurring in the formula can be degenerate, so they are dis-
carded.) This is extended linearly to a homomorphism
3: CLX —* CLIX
by the formula
=
A k-chain is called a k-cycle if
its boundary is zero; the k-cycles form a subgroup
of CLX. The
boundaries of (k + 1)-chains form a subgroup BLX of CLX.
Exercise 23.1. Show that for any (k + 1)-cube 1', 3(81') = 0 in Ck_ 1X.
From this exercise it follows that BAX is a subgroup of ZkX, so we
can define the kth homology group of X to be quotient
flAX = ZAX/BLX.
Exercise 23.2. (a) Show that HLX = 0 if X is a point and k >0. (Note
that this would not be true if degenerate cubes had not been dis-
carded.) (b) Verify that for k = 0 and k = 1, these are the groups we
studied in Chapter 6. (c) Show how any continuous mappingf: X—> Y
determines homomorphisms ft: HLX—> HAY, and show that these are
functorial in the sense of Exercise 6.20. (d) Construct homomor-
phisms from 'rrL(X,x) to b/AX that are compatible with the maps of
(c) and Exercise 22.14.
Proposition 23.3. 1ff and g are homotopic maps from X to Y, then
and
determine the same homomorphisms from I-/AX to I-JAY.
Proof. Suppose H:XX[0,lJ—>Y is a homotopy fromf tog, and
F:
is a k-cube; define a (k + 1)-cube R(F) by the formula
R(F)(s,t1,
.
.
. ,tk) = J1(1'(t1,
.
.
. ,tk)Xs).
If
is a k-cycle, a little calculation shows that the boundary of
>.naR(Fa) is >na(fo ía) —
I'a), which completes the proof. A
more elegant way to see this is to extend R by linearity to a map
R: CAX—÷ Ck+ X, R(ThaFa) = Th41R(Fj. Then a formal calculation shows

334
23. Higher Homology
that
g*—f* = 8oR+Rod
as homomorphisms from CkX to CAX. Then if z is a k-cycle,
—f*(z) = BoR(z) + R°8(z) =
which shows that g*(z) and
differ by a boundary.
U
It follows from the proposition that if Y C X is a deformation re-
tract, then !-IkY-—>HLX is an isomorphism for all k. For example, if K
is contractible, then
= 0 for all /c > 0.
23b. Mayer—Vietoris for Homology
To calculate the higher homology groups of more interesting spaces,
we want to extend the Mayer—Vietoris sequence to these higher groups:
if U and V are open subsets of a space, there is an exact sequence
>HkU$HOV
-
+ >Hk(UUV)
a
The idea is very much as in Chapter 10. The key is the definition of
the "boundary maps" 8: Hk(UU
V). For this, we show
that any class in I-Ik(U U V) can be represented by a k-cycle z that is
a sum of a chain c1 on U and a chain c-, on V. Then 8c1 = —Bc-, is a
cycle on Un V, and this represents the image class in HL_l(Ufl V).
To carry out the construction of the boundary map, we need a sys-
tematic way to subdivide k-cubes and chains into sums of smaller
chains, generalizing the constructions we used in Chapter 10. Given
a k-cube F:
we define S(F) to be the sum of the 2" k-cubes
obtained by restricting F to each of the 2" subcubes obtained by sub-
dividing the cube:

23b. Mayer—Victoris for Homology
335
Each of these restrictions must be renormalized, to be dcfined on the
cube 1" with sides of length 1. In symbols,
S(F) =
the sum over all
choices of
= 0 or 1, and
.FA is the k-cube
defined by the formula
FE.
.
.
.
,
= F(1/2(t + s1),
.
.
.
, '/2(4 + EkP.
This is extended by linearity to give a homomorphism S: CkX—>CkX,
i.e., by defining
=
If the boundary of S(F) is cal-
culated, all the terms corresponding to inner faces cancel, and one
gets the result of subdividing the boundary of F. In symbols,
(23.4)
3oS = Soa,
as homomorphisms from CkX to CLIX.
Exercise 23.5. Verify this formula.
We can iterate this subdivision operation, defining for any k-chain
c new k-chains S(c), S2(c) = S(S(c)), S3(c) = S(S(S(c))), and so on.
Lemma 23.6. If X is a union of two open sets U and V, and c is a
k-chain on X, then, for sufficiently large p, S"(c) can be written as a
sum c1 + c2 where c1 is a k-chain on U and c2 is a k-chain on V.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the Lebesgue lemma,
since, if F:
is a k-cube, the image of each k-cube appear-
ing in S"(F) is the image of a subcube of I" with sides of length
1/2".
To use this construction and lemma, we want to know that, if z is
a k-cycle, then S(z) is a k-cycle defining the same homology class as
z. For this we proceed as follows. Let a: [0, 1]—> [0, 1] be defined
by the formula
12t
1/2tS 1.
If F is a k-cube in X, define a k-cube A(F) by the formula
A(F)(t1 ,
.
.
.
,
= F(a(t1),
.
.
.
,
Note that the "first corner" A(F)0,
of this k-cube is F, and all the
other A(F)E.
EL are degenerate. Extend this by linearity as usual to

336
23. Higher Homology
a homomorphism A: CkX—+ CkX. (If k = 0, define A to be the identity
map.) By the observation just made, we have
(23.7)
SoA = I,
where I: CkX—> CkX is the identity map. Now define, for a k-cube F,
a (k+ 1)-cube H(F) by the formula
H(F)(s, t1 ,
.
.
.
,
= F((1
— s)oi(t1) + St1 ,
.
.
.
, (1 — s)a(tk) + stk),
and extend by linearity to a homomorphism H: CkX—* Ck+ 1X. (If k =0,
set H = 0.) Note that 8?(H(F)) = A(F) and
= F. From this one
sees that
(23.8)
3oH+Hoc9 = I—A,
as homomorphisms from CkX to CkX.
Exercise 23.9. Verify this formula.
For each p  I, define a homomorphism
CLX—> Ck+ X by the
formula
.
.
.
Then we have, for all p  1, the identity
(23.10)
BoR+Roö = S'—J.
In fact, this is a formal calculation, following from (23.4), (23.7),
and (23.8), as follows. When p = I, R1 = SoH, and
3oR+R1o8 = äoSoH+SoHoö
= SoôoH+SoHoô
= So(30H+H08)=So(I_A)
= S—SoA=S—I.

as asserted.

23b. Mayer—Vietoris for Homology
337
Now suppose that X = U U V. The definition of the boundary ho-
momorphism from Hk(U U V) to HL_l(U fl V) depends on the follow-
ing lemma:
Lemma 23.11. (a) Any homology class in HkX can he represented
by a cycle z on X of the form z = c1 + c2, where c1 is a k-chain on U
and c2 is a k-chain on V. (b) The (k — 1)-chain 8c = —8c2 is a cycle
on U fl
and its homology class in Hk_ (U fl V) is independent of
choice of c1 and c2.
Proof. For (a), take any cycle c that represents the homology class.
By Lemma 23.6, for some p  I, the chain &c can be written as the
sum of a chain c on U and a chain c2 on
V. By (23.10),
=
from which it follows that z = S'°c is
a cycle representing the same
homology class as c.
For (b), suppose z' = c1' + c2' is another representative of the same
form for the same homology class. There is a (k + 1)-chain w on X
with 0(w) =
— z. By Lemma 23.6, there is a p I
such that
can be written as a sum of a chain on U and a chain on V. Applying
(23.10) to the chain 0(w), we have
— z = 8(w) =
— 14(8(8(w))) —
— z))
=
—
— z)) = 8(S"(w) —
— z)).
From the formula for
it follows that 14 takes a chain on U to a
chain on U and a chain on V to a chain on V. We know that z' — z
is a sum of a chain on U and a chain on V, and it follows that
— z)
is also. It follows that there are (k + 1)-chains y1 and y2 on U and V
such that S"(w) —
— z) = y1 + y2, so
z'—z = 8(y1+y2).
This means that we have an equality of k-chains
— c1 — 8(y1) =
—(c2' — c2 — 8(y2)),
the left side of which is a chain on U and the right side is a chain on
V. This chain, denoted x, is a chain on U fl V, and it follows that
8(x) = 8(c1')—8(c1),
so the cycles 8(c1') and
8(c1) differ by a boundary on U fl V, as
asserted.
Define

23. Higher Homology
a cycle z of the form c1 + c2 with c1 and c2 chains on U and V, to the
homology class [8(c1)] of the cycle 8(c) = —8(c2) on U fl V. It fol-
lows from Lemma 23. 11 that this definition makes sense. The proof
that it is a homomorphism, and that the resulting Mayer—Victoris se-
quence is exact, is precisely the same as in Chapter 10, so will not
be repeated; the general algebra for this will be described in §24a.
In fact, the above argument shows something more. Let X be any
space, and °1L = {Ua: a EM any open covering of X. Let CdX)u be
the subgroup of Ck(X) consisting of linear combinations of nonde-
generate k-cubes F: P—>X such that the image of F is contained in
one (or more) of the open sets Ua. These cubes are said to be small
with respect to Gil. The boundary operator maps
to
so we can define the corresponding homology groups HA(X)U. There
is a natural map from
to Hk(X). The following proposition
says that we can always calculate homology by using chains that are
small with respect to any convenient covering.
Proposition 23.12. The natural map
is an isomor-
phism.
Exercise 23.13. Use (23.4), (23.7), (23.8), and (23. 10) to prove this
proposition.
This proposition also gives a more concise way to construct the
Mayer—Vietoris exact sequence:
Exercise 23.14. For Gil = {U, V}, construct a homomorphism from

Combine with the proposition to get the full Mayer—Vietoris se-

The following is a useful general consequence of the Mayer—Vietoris
sequence.

23c. Spheres and Degree
We saw that 5" is simply connected if n  2, so H1S" = 0. With Mayer—
Vietoris, one can calculate the homology groups of all spheres S".
One can cover 5" by two open sets U and V each homeomorphic to
open disks in
whose intersection is homeomorphic to
X P for
an open interval 1°. Mayer—Vietoris gives an isomorphism

Equipped with homology groups, the definition of the degree of a
continuous map!: 5"—> 5" is easy: Since HnS"
/, the induced map
is multiplication by an integer, and this integer is
defined to be the degree of f, denoted deg(f). Equivalently, if [z] is
a generator for HnS", deg(f) is the integer such thatf*([zj) =
171.
(Note that using the other generator —(zj leads to the same degree.)
Exercise 23.17. (a) Show that homotopic maps from 5" to 5" have
the same degree. (b) Show that if f:
extends to a continuous
map from

maps from
to 5n, then deg(g0f)=deg(g)-deg(f). (d) Show that
for any integer d and any n 
1 there are mapsf: S"—>S" of degree d.
In fact the converses of (a) and (b) of the preceding exercise are
true, but more difficult.
Having the notion of degree, we can define the generalization of
winding number: the engu(fing number W(f, F) of a continuous map
f:

that forf: S"—> I?' \ {0} differentiable, this definition agrees with that

Similarly, one can define the local degree of a continuous mapping
ft U—> V between open sets in I?' at a point P

is a neighborhood U4 of P such that no other point of U, has the same
image as P. This is the degree of the mapping

This can be used for example to define the notion of a homeomor-

to

being orientation preserving or orientation reversing, according as
the local degree at any point is +
I or — 1.
Exercise 23.19. (a) Show that this local degree is a continuous func-
tion of the point, so the notion of orientation preserving or reversing
is well defined. (b) Show that a homeomorphism of 517 is orientation
preserving or reversing according as its degree is +

that a homeomorphism of W extends to a homeomorphism of

that the local degree is given by the sign of the determinant of the

With the concept of degree, the following assertions of Borsuk and
Brouwer are proved just as before, and the proofs arc left as exercises.
Theorem 23.20. (1) There is no retraction from
onto 5".
(2) Any continuous mapping from a closed disk D" to itself must
have afixed point.
Exercise 23.21. Generalize the results of Exercises 4.9—4. 17.
Problem 23.22. Show that the degree of the antipodal map from 5"
to 5" is
1 if n is odd and — I if n is even. In particular, the antipodal
map is not homotopic to the identity if n is even.

Problem 23.23. (a) Show that no even-dimensional sphere can have
a nowhere vanishing vector field. (b) Construct on every odd-dimen-
sional sphere a nowhere vanishing vector field.
To extend the results about antipodal mappings, we need the fol-
lowing generalization of Borsuk's Lemma 4.20. As there, we denote
by
= —P the antipode of a point P in Sn.
Theorem 23.24. Letf:
be a continuous map.
(a) if f(P*)
f(p)* for all P in 5", then the degree off is odd.
(b) if f(P*)
flP) for all P in 5", then the degree off is even.
The proof of this requires some new ideas, and is postponed to
Appendix E. Assuming this theorem, we can draw the expected con-
sequences:
Corollary 23.25. (a) if m <n, there is no continuous mappingf:
such that f(P*)
flP)* frr all P in
(h) Any continuous mappingf:
must map some pair of an-
tipodal points to the same point.
(c) An open set in W cannot be homeomorphic to an open set in

contains a pair of antipodal points.
Exercise 23.26. Prove this corollary.

all P, show that deg(f) is odd. (b) If f(P*)
for all P. show
that deg(f) is even. (c) Show that the only nontrivial group that can
act freely on an even-dimensional sphere is the group with two ele-
ments.
Exercise 23.28. Show that if n> 1 any continuous mapping from 5"
to RP" must map some pair of antipodal points to the same point.
Exercise 23.29. Prove that if n + I bounded measurable objects are
given in ER", then there is a hyperplane that cuts each in half.
Exercise 23.30. (a) State and prove n-dimensional analogues of Ex-

field on an open set in It' at an isolated singular point, and state and
prove the n-dimensional analogues of Proposition 7.5 and its corol-
laries.

23. Higher Homology
Exercise 23.31. Use Mayer—Vietoris to compute the homology groups
of a torus 5' X 5', or of any product 5tm X Sn.
Homology can be used to define a notion of degree in many other
contexts. Here is an important illustration. A link in P? is a disjoint
union of knots. Equivalence is defined just as for knots. A link can
be nontrivial even if all the knots occurring in it are trivial. There is
a linking number that mcasures how many times two knots intertwine
with each other.
0°
Suppose K and L are disjoint knots. Define a mapping
x—y
F:KXL—>S2,
which assigns to the pair (x, y) the direction from x toy. This mapping
F determines a homomorphism
H2(K X L)—* H2(52). Both of these
homology groups are isomorphic with 7. Choosing orientations of
each identifies them with 7, and then
is multiplication by some
integer, which is defined to be the linking number l(K, L). If a stan-
dard orientation is fixed for
the sign of l(K,L) depends on ori-
entations chosen for K and L; it changes sign if either of these ori-
entations are changed. The linking number also changes sign if the
roles of K and L are reversed. Note that if K and L are far apart, then
F will not be surjective, so this linking number is zero.
Exercise 23.32. (a) Show that the linking number of the two circles
in Exercise 22.7 is ± I, and therefore the linking number of two fibers
of the Hopf mapping of Exercise 22. 17 is ± 1. (b) Show that the
intersection of a small sphere S3 around a singularity of a plane curve
that is a node (see §20c) is two circles whose linking number is ± I.
It is a fact (see §24c) that the top homology group HnX of an ori-
ented n-manifold X is 7 (the orientation determining a choice of gen-
erator). It follows that any continuous mapf: X—e. Y between oriented
n-manifolds has a degree.

the same as the number of sheets of the corresponding branched cov-
ering.
23d. Generalized Jordan Curve Theorem
There is a vast generalization of the Jordan curve theorem to higher
dimensions. This can be stated as follows:
Theorem 23.34. if X C 5" is homeomorphic to a sphere 5tn, then m.c
and m <n unless X = 5". Urn <n, the homology groups of the com-
plement are
1's' ifm=n—l and k=0,
1'
ifm<n—l and k=0 or
0
otherwise.
in particular, the complement has two components if m = n — I , and one
ifm<n- 1.
The essential point of this theorem is the assertion that the ho-
mology of the complement is the same for all embeddings of 5"' in
5fl
The proof follows the pattern for the Jordan Curve Theorem in
the plane very closely, using the full Mayer—Vietoris theorem. We
discuss only the new features, leaving details to the reader. First we
have the analogous result for embeddings of cubes in 5".
Proposition 23.35. /f X C 5" is horneomorphic to F", then 5" \ X is
connected and Hk(S" \ X) = 0 for all k >0.
Proof. This is by induction on rn, the case m = 0 being clear since
the complement of a point is homeomorphic to W, so contractible.
For rn >0 write
as the union of two halves whose intersection is
homeomorphic to jm
; this makes X a union of two subspaces A and
B. Applying Mayer—Vietoris to U = 5" \ A and V = 5" \ B, and know-
ing about U U V by induction, we have
>
>
From this it follows that if z is a k-cycle on 5" \ X that is not a bound-

344
23. Higher Homology
ary, then it is not a boundary on S"\A or Sn\B. Continuing to cut
the cubes in half, passing to the limit as in Chapter 5, we find that
z is not a boundary on S" \ {x} forx a point, from which the conclusion
follows easily.
To prove the theorem, also by induction on m, write X as the union
of two closed sets A and B homeomorphic to the upper and lower
hemispheres of the sphere
Each of A and B is homeomorphic to
r and A fl B is homeomorphic to 5m-1
Applying Mayer—Vietoris
and the proposition to U5"\A and
we get
o —+ Hk+(S"\AflB) —* Hk(S'1\X) —> 0
if k>0, and
We know about 5" \ A fl B by induction, so the first display computes

gives
o —* Ho(S"\X)

from which it follows easily that H0(St' \ X)

we find similarly
If mn, from

we see that
\ X) = 0, so X = 5". From this it follows that no
larger sphere can be embedded in 5", since an n-dimensional sub-
sphere would already map to the whole 5".
Exercise 23.36. State and prove analogous results for X C W homeo-
morphic to a sphere.
Exercise 23.37. If F: D"—* I? is continuous and one-to-one, show
that B? \ F(S") has two connected components, one the image of the
interior of if, the other the complement of F(D"). Deduce
the in-
variance of domain: if U is open in R", and F: U—>ftk" is a one-to-
one continuous mapping, then F(U) is open. Prove the invariance of
dimension: open sets in I? and I?' cannot be homeomorphic if n $ m.
It is
also true that if F: sn>w+l is an embedding, then its en-

gulfing number around points in the two components of the comple-
ments is ±1 for the bounded component and 0 for the unbounded
component (see Proposition 5.20), but this requires more machinery.
Exercise 23.38. Suppose A and B are disjoint closed subsets of S",
n> I, and two points are given in the complement of A U B. Show
that if A and B do not separate these points, neither does A UB.
The Mayer—Vietoris sequence can also be used to show that a com-
pact nonorientable surface cannot be topologically embedded in W.
We sketch a proof in the following problems:
Problem 23.39. (a) Show that if X C W is homeomorphic to a Moe-
bius band, then
if k0 or 1, and HalV\X)=o oth-
erwise. (b) With X as in (a), if YCX corresponds to the boundary
circle, show that the map
H(W\X)
H(W\Y)
/
determined by the inclusion of DV \ X
in lV \ Y takes a generator of
the first group to twice a generator of the second.
Suppose a subspace X of Ri were homeomorphic to the projective
plane. Write X as a union of a space A homeomorphic to a Moebius
band and B homeomorphic to a disk, with A fl B homeomorphic to
the boundary circle of each. Then with U = Ri \ A, V = Ri \ B, Mayer—
Vietoris and Exercise 23.36 give an exact sequence
H1(Ri\A)%0 —> H(Ri\AflB) —÷ J-10(Ri\X).
By the preceding problem, the image of a generator of H1(Ri \ A fl B)
maps to an element a in H0(Ri \ X) that is nonzero, but 2 a = 0.
However, we know that the 0th homology group of any space is a
free abelian group, which has no such element.
Problem 23.40. Show similarly that none of the nonoricntable com-
pact surfaces can be embedded in Ri.
The following problem generalizes two of the main results of Chap-
ters 6 and 9:
Problem 23.41. Let U be an open subset of I?. (a) Show that two
classes in Hn_1U are equal if and only if they map to equal classes
in Hn_i(W \ {P}) for all P not in U. (b) Show that if the complement
of U in
= W U {°°} is a disjoint union of m + 1 compact connected
sets, then Hn_1U is a free abelian group on m generators.

CHAPTER 24
Duality
24a. Two Lemmas from Homological Algebra
We frequently want to compare different homology and cohomology
groups, when we have exact Mayer—Vietoris sequences for each, and
maps between them. Assuming that most of the maps are isomor-
phisms, we want to deduce that the others are as well. There is a
general algebraic fact that can be used for this:
Lemma 24.1 (Five-Lemma). Given a commutative diagram
A
>B
->C
A'
> B'
—'
C'
>
D'
>
E'
of abe/ian groups, such that the rows are exact sequences, and a/l
the vertical maps but the middle one are isomorphisms, then the mid-
dIe map from C to C' must also be an isomorphism.
The proof is by a "diagram chase," which is much easier and en-
joyable to do for oneself than to follow when someone else does it.
Here is how to show that the map is one-to-one. If c in C maps to 0
in C', then its image in D maps to 0 in D' (by commutativity of the
diagram), so c maps to 0 in D (since D—>D' is injective), so c comes
from some element b in B (by exactness of the top row). The element
b maps to an element b' in B' that maps to 0 in C' (why?), that
346

24a. Two Lemmas from Homological Algebra
347
therefore comes from an element a' in A'. This element a' comes
from some element a in A, and this element a must map to b since
they have the same images in B'. Since a maps to 0 in C, and b maps
to c, c must be 0.
Exercise 24.2. (a) Prove similarly that C—> C' is surjective. (b) Show
that the five-lemma is also valid under the following weaker as-
sumptions, still assuming the rows are exact: (i) each square either
commutes or commutes up to sign, i.e., the composite going around
one way is plus or minus the composite going around the other way;
and (ii) the maps B—*B' and D—>D' are isomorphisms, A—'A' is
surjective, and E—>E' is injective.
If you like this diagram chasing, there is a general process that
constructs long exact sequences, which can be used to construct all
the Mayer—Vietoris sequences we have seen. For this, one has a com-
mutative diagram of abelian groups

where the rows are exact, and the composite of any two successive
maps in the columns is zero. One says that the columns are chain
complexes. The diagram is abridged to saying one has a short exact
sequence of chain complexes
0 —>
—>
—> Cs"
—> 0.
For each chain complex (column) one can form homology groups.
For the center column,
Hk(C*) =

348
24. Duality
where Zk(C*) = Kernel(Ck—4 CA
are the k-cycles, and BA(C*) =
Image(Ck+! —> C,j are the k-boundaries. Similarly for the other two
columns. There are maps from Hk(C*') to HA(C*) and from Hk(C*)
to HA(C*"), determined by the horizontal maps in the diagram. For
example, the map from CA' maps Zk(C*') to ZA(C*) and BA(C*') to
Bk(C*), so it determines a homomorphism on the quotient group. The
interesting maps are boundary homomorphisms
8: HA(C*") —> HA_i(C*').
To define these, take a representative z" in ZA(C*") of a class in Hk(C*").
Choose an element c in CA that maps onto z". Let ii be the image of
c in CA_I. Then Fmaps to 0 in CA_i", since it has the same image
there as z" does, and z" is a cycle. So Fcomes from an element c' in
CA
1
Exercise 24.3. Show that this element c' is a (k — 1)-cycle, and its
homology class in HAI(C*') is independent of choices of the repre-
sentative z" and the element c that maps onto z".
The homology class of c' is defined to be the boundary of the ho-
mology class of z": 8([z"]) = [c']. One checks easily that 8 is a ho-
momorphism of abelian groups.
Proposition 24.4. The resulting sequence
HA(C*') -4 11A(C*) -4 Hk(C*")
is exact.
The proof is some more diagram chasing, which again we leave as
an exercise. There is a similar result when the vertical maps in the
diagram go up rather than down. Usually then the indexing is by up-
per indices, so we have "cochain complexes"
C*:
.
.
.
A short exact sequence
C*'
C* S—>
0 determines a long
exact sequence of their cohomology groups
.
.
Let us see how some of the Mayer—Vietoris sequences we have
seen earlier fall out of this formalism. For example, if X is a
manifold, and CAX denotes the vector space of
k-forms on X, and

24a. Two Lemmas from Homological Algebra
349
U and V are open sets in X, there is an exact sequence
0 —* C*(UUV)
C*(U)EBC*(V) —> C*(UflV) —*
0
of cochain complexes. The first map takes a form to on U U V to the
pair
coIv), and the second takes a pair (to, , to2) to the difference
tojunv — to2JUflV. The exactness of this sequence is clear from the def-
initions except for the surjectivity of the second map, and that was
proved using a partition of unity in Chapter 10. The Mayer—Vietoris
sequence then results immediately from Proposition 24.4.
Similarly, for cohomology with compact support, one has a short
exact sequence of cochain complexes
0 -+ Ct(UflV) —> Q(U)Ef)Q(V) —* Ct(UUV) —> 0,
where the first map takes a form to on U fl V to the pair (to", —to"),
where to" denotes the extension by 0 from U fl V to U, and similarly
for V; the second map takes (to,,to2) to
Again, ex-
actness follows from a partition of unity argument, and the Mayer—
Vietoris exact sequence results.
For homology, if a space X is a union of open sets U and V, let
C,AXY1' denote the k-chains that are small with respect to the covering
= {U, V} of X. Then there is an exact sequence
0 —*
—*
—> 0
of chain complexes, the first taking a chain on U fl V to the pair con-
sisting of its images on U and on V. and the second taking a pair to
the difference of their images on X. The exactness is immediate, giv-
ing an exact sequence

—> Hk(U)EI9Hk(V)
—* Hk(C*(X)U)

)
To complete the proof, one appeals to Proposition 23. 12, which says
that
= Hk(X).
Exercise 24.5. If 0—>C'--->C—÷ C"—>O is an exact sequence of free
abelian groups, and G is any abelian group, show that
0 —> Hom(C",G) -* Hom(C,G)

chain complexes, and hence an exact sequence of cohomology groups.

350
24. Duality
Exercise 24.6. Let C* and
be chain complexes with boundary
maps denoted Bk: Ck—>Ck_I and BA':
respectively. Define
a map of chain complexesf*:
to be a collection of homo-
morphismsfk: Ck—> CA' that commute with the boundary maps. Show
that such maps
determines homomorphisms from I-Ik(C*) to Hk(C*').
Call two maps f* and

maps,
Ck—+Ckl!' such that

and
then determine the same maps from
Hk(C*)
to

If
is a map of chain complexes such that each CA'
is one-to-one, one can define CA" to be CA/CA', getting an exact se-
quence
so a long exact homology se-
quence. For example, if V is a subspace of a topological space X,
then
Y—÷
is one-to-one, so one can define a quotient chain
complex
V. The homology groups of this complex are de-
noted Hk(X, Y), and are called the relative homology groups. They
fit in a long exact sequence
—+11k41(X, Y)—>J-Jk(Y)-->HA(X)---*Hk(X, Y)—+HA1(Y)-->.
For suitably nice spaces, these relative groups are isomorphic to the
homology groups of the space obtained by collapsing (identifying) Y
to a point. In many treatments of algebraic topology, these relative
groups, and the above sequence, are used for calculation in most sit-
uations where we have used the Mayer—Vietoris sequence.
24b. Homology and De Rham Cohomology
In this section we want to prove that the De Rham cohomology groups
HAX of a manifold are dual to the homology groups flAX,
i.e., we
want to construct an isomorphism
HAX A
generalizing what we did for surfaces for k = I. The idea is similar:
one wants to integrate k-forms over k-cubes. This makes sense for
differentiable k-cubes, but there is a problem of how to define this
for continuous k-cubes that are not differentiable—a problem that we
avoided for k =
1 by cutting up the path, locally writing the k-form

24b. Homology and Dc Rham Cohomology
351
as the differential of a (k — 1)-form
and evaluating p. over the end-
points of the subdivided path. For k> 1, unless the restriction of the
k-cube to its boundary is differentiable, this will not work. A more
systematic procedure, that does work, is to show that the homology
HkX can be computed by using only differentiable cubes.
A cube F:
is a cc cube if it extends to a
mapping on
some neighborhood of the cube P C R'< Define CX to be the free
abelian group on the nondegenerate t' k-cubes. The boundary 8 from
the k-chains to the (k — 1)-chains takes cc cubes to
cubes, so we
can define the
homology groups
to be the quotient of the
closed
k-chains modulo the subgroup consisting of boundaries of
cc (k + 1)-chains. There is an obvious map
HX -÷ HkX,
which, in the language of the preceding section, is given by the map
of chain complexes
We will show that this is an iso-
morphism.
If w is a k-form on X, and F:
is a cc cube, we can define
the integral of w over F by
jw =
where F*(w) is the pull-back form; a form on the cube can be written
f(x1,.
.
. ,x,jdx1Adx,A.
.
and the integral of such a form is the usual Riemann integral of the
continuous functionf on the cube.
Exercise 24.7. Prove "Stokes' theorem" in this context: if w is a
(k— 1)-form, then
jdw = Jw.
From Stokes' theorem, it follows as in the case k =
1 that there is
a map
HkX
w
We will see that this is also an isomorphism. Combining these two
isomorphisms will give the duality we were after.

352
24. Duality
To prove these isomorphisms, we need to know that the groups
HrX have many of the same properties as the purely topological groups
HkX. For example,
Exercise 24.8. (a) Show that a cc mapping f:
Y of manifolds
determines functorial
HX—>
(b) If two maps
from X to Y are homotopic by a
mapping F: X X 1' —* Y (where I'
is an open interval containing [0, 1]), then they determine the same
homomorphisms. (c) Deduce that
= 0 for k >0, and
= 7
if U is a starshaped open set in W.
Similarly, one has Mayer—Vietoris exact sequences just as for the
groups I-/AX, and compatible with the maps from groups
to the
In fact, the same construction works in the cc case, noting that
the subdivision operators used to cut cubes into small pieces preserve
cc chains. One modification needs to be made in our proof, however,
since the operator A we used in Chapter 23 used a function that is
only piecewise differentiable.
Exercise 24.9. Change the function a used in §23b to a cc function
from [0, 1] to [0, IJ such that a(O) = 0 and a(t) = 1 if t  '/2. With
any such a, show that, for any chain F, SOA(F) — F is a boundary.
Use this to complete the proof of Mayer—Vietoris for these groups.
To prove these isomorphisms, we need a way to build up arbitrary
manifolds out of simple pieces. The following general lemma will
suffice for our purposes. Let us call an open rectangle in W an open
rectangular solid with sides parallel to the axes, i.e., an open set of
the form (a1,h1)X
.
.
.
X is an open set in W, then X can be written as
the union of two open sets U and V such that each of U and V and
Ufl Visa disjoint union of open sets, each of which is afinite union
of open rectangles.
Proof. Take compact sets K1 C

as in the Lemma A.20.
Construct a sequence of open sets
U
a finite
union of rectangles covering K1, with the closure of each contained
in the interior of K2. Let U2 be a finite union of rectangles covering
1(2 \ Int(K1), with the closure of each contained in the interior of K3.
Inductively, let
be a finite union of rectangles that covers the com-
pact set

2. Now let
U be the union of the union of all
with p even, and let V be the
union of the union of all U,, with p odd.
Lemma 24.11. If X is a differentiable n-manifold, then X can be
written as the union of two open sets U and V such that each of U
and V and U fl V is a disjoint union of open sets, each of which is a
finite union of open sets diffeomorphic to open sets in B?.
Proof. The argument is the same. Remark A.2 I shows that X is a
union of compact sets K1 C K2 C
.
.
. with the same properties. Then
the preceding proof, with "rectangle" replaced by "open set diffeo-
morphic to an open set in B?" goes over without change.
LI
Theorem 24.12. For any manifold X the natural maps
are isomorphisms.
Proof. Let us write "T(X)" for the statement that the maps from
I-CX to HkX are isomorphisms for all k. There are three tools:
(1) T(U) is true when U is an open rectangle in B?.
(2) If U and Vare open in a manifold, and if T(U), T(V), and T(Ufl V)
are true, then T(UU V) is true.
(3)
If X is a disjoint union of open manifolds
and each T(Xa) is
true, then T(X) is true.
With what we have seen, each of these is easy to prove. (I) follows
from the fact that
and HAU vanish for k >0, and both are nat-
urally isomorphic to / when k0, cf. Exercise 24.8. (2) follows
from the fact that we have Mayer—Vietoris exact sequences for each,
with compatible maps between them:
H;unv
HrUGHrV
'If
HkUflV
so the five-lemma shows that the middle map is an isomorphism if
the others are. (3) follows from the fact that to specify a class of either
kind on X is equivalent to specifying a class on each
with all but
a finite number of these classes being zero (i.e., HkX is the direct
sum of the groups HkXa, and similarly for Hr).
We can now use these tools to prove the theorem. We first show
that T(X) is true whenever X C B? is a finite union of open rectangles.
This is by induction on the number of rectangles. (1) takes care of

354
24. Duality
one rectangle, and if X is a union of p rectangles, let U he the union
of p — I of them and let V be the other. Then T(U) and T(V) are true
by induction, and T(U fl V) is true since U fl V is also a union of at
most p —
I rectangles, since the intersection of two rectangles is either
empty or a rectangle. Then T(X) is true by (2).
Next we show that T(X) is true whenever X is an open set in W.
By Lemma 24. 10 one can write X as a union of two open sets U and
V. such that each of U and V and U fl V is a disjoint union of open
sets, each of which is a finite union of open rectangles. Applying the
preceding step and (3) we know that T(U) and T(V) and T(U fl V)
are true, and by (2) again we know that T(X) is true.
Note that since a diffeomorphism between manifolds determines an
isomorphism between the corresponding groups, it follows that T(X)
is true for any set diffeomorphie to an open set in ER'. The same in-
ductive argument as for rectangles shows that T(X) is true when X is
a finite union of open sets, each diffeomorphie to an open set in ER".
For the general ease, Lemma 24. 11 shows that any manifold X is a
union of two open sets U and V such that each of U and V and U fl V
is a disjoint union of open sets, each of which is diffeomorphie to a
finite union of open sets in ER". By the last step and (3) again, T(U)
and T(V) and T(U fl V) are true, and a final application of (2) shows
that T(X) is true.
Theorem 24.13. For any manifold X the natural maps from HkX to
Hom(HX, ER) are isomorphisms.
Proof. The proof follows exactly the same format, with T(X) being
the statement that these maps are isomorphisms for all
Once (1)—
(3) are proved, in fact, the proof is identical. The proof of (I) is the
same, and (3) follows from the fact that to specify a class of either
kind is equivalent to specifying a class on each
(i.e., H&X
is the
direct product of the groups HLXQ, and similarly for
ER)).
To prove (2), we need to compare the cohomology Mayer—Vietoris
sequence with the dual of the Mayer—Vietoris sequence in homology.
For brevity write

An application of the five-lemma, together with the following ex-
ercise, finishes the proof.

Exercise 24.14. Show that this diagram commutes.
These theorems justify the use of cr techniques in studying the
topology of a differentiable manifold. For example, they show that
the De Rham groups depend only on the underlying topology of the
manifold. Combining the isomorphisms of the two theorems, one has
justified writing

form on a manifold.

Exercise 24.16. Let X be an n-manifold that can be covered by a
finite number of open sets such that any intersection of them is dif-
feomorphie to a convex open set in r. (It is a fact, proved by using
a Riemannian metric and geodesics, that any compact manifold has
such an open cover.) Show that each HkX is a finitely generated abe-
han group, and that each HAX and
is a finite-dimensional vector
space.
24c. Cohomology and Cohomology
with Compact Supports
In higher dimensions, except in simple cases in the Poincaré lemmas,
we have not yet used the higher-dimensional versions of wedging forms
that we used on surfaces in Chapter 18. In general the wedge to A p.
of a k-form to and an /-form p. is a (k + 1)-form. This operation is
linear in each factor, and satisfies the identities:
(i) p.Ato(_l)k 'toAp.; and
(ii)
Again, we assume these properties from advanced calculus. If either
to or p. has compact support, then to A p. has compact support, since
the support of the wedge product is contained in the intersection of
the supports of the factors. It follows from (ii) that the wedge product
of two closed forms is closed, and that, if one is closed and the other
is exact, the wedge product is exact. From this it follows that the
wedge product determine products on the cohomology groups

and
for Uan
open rectangle, and all other groups vanish, by the Poineard lemmas;
and since I E H°U maps to the nonzero homomorphism that is inte-
gration over U, the map is an isomorphism. For (2), one again has
maps from the Mayer—Vietoris sequence for HA to the dual of the
sequence for the Hr". This time the signs involved in the definition
mean that the key square in the diagram only commutes up to sign,
but that is good enough to apply the five-lemma, ef. Exercise 24.2.
We leave the calculation of these signs as an exercise.

This duality theorem has several corollaries that were not obvious
before. For example, the simple fact that
= 0 whenever X is a
connected but not compact manifold implies the
Corollary 24.19. If X is a connected, oriented, but noncompact n-
manifold, then I-P'X =0.
Corollary 24.20. If X is a connected oriented n-manifold, then the
map

mensional. (b) If n = 2m, with m odd, show that the dimension of

must be even.
This puts strong restrictions on the homology and cohomology groups
of a compact oriented n-manifold. For example, the dimension of HkX
must equal the dimension of H" LX. The skew-commutative algebra
structure on the direct sum of the cohomology groups is also useful
in many applications.
As we saw for Ricmann surfaces these duality theorems can be used
to define an intersection number (a,
for homology classes a in I-I,,X
and
in
when X is an oriented n-manifold. As in that case,
it is possible to do this directly and geometrically, by finding repre-
sentative cycles that meet transversally, and counting the points of
intersection with an appropriate sign. This takes quite a bit of work,
however, and one can use duality to define the intersection number
quickly: A class a in

for these groups; after proving appropriate duality theorems, one has
a construction of the intersection pairing whose values are integers.
This could be a next chapter, if this book didn't end here. At least
now we can give a quick definition of these groups, or of cohomology
groups H'<(X;G) with coefficients in any abelian group G, general-
izing directly the discussion in §16c. Define a k-cochain to be an
arbitrary function that assigns to every nondegenerate k-cube in X an
element of G; these form a group C'<(X; G). If c is a k-cochain, define
the cohoundary 8(c) of c to be the (k+ 1)-cochain
defined by the
formula 8(c)(F) = c(8fl, where a cochain is extended linearly to be
defined
on
all
chains.

boundaries (of (Ic — 1)-cochains).

24d. Simplicial Complexes
We have seen the usefulness of triangulating a surface. Many spaces
that arise in nature, including many which are not manifolds, admit
triangulations. When a space is triangulated, there is a much smaller
chain complex that can be used to compute its homology. The general
methods of §24a can be used to show that this complex computes the
same homology as that using cubical chains.
A (finite) abstract simplicial complex is a finite set V, called the
vertices, and a collection K of subsets of V, called the (abstract) sim-
p/ices, with the property that every subset of a simplex is a simplex.
One usually assumes also that every set {v} for v in V is a simplex,
and one says that K is the simplicial complex. An n-simplex is a set
a in K with n + I elements. A subset 7 of a simplex a is called a
face of a.

is called the (geometric) simplex spanned by the points. It is homeo-
morphic to an n-dimensional disk.
The realization
K can be con-
structed by taking the vertices V to be the basis vectors for a vector
space, and defining
to be the union of the geometric simplices
spanned by the abstract simplices in K. In practice one often takes
the vertices in a smaller vector space, provided those in any simplex
are affinely independent, and two geometric simplices are either dis-
joint or meet only along common faces.
We want to write down a chain complex for the simplicial complex
K. This is simplest if K is ordered. This means that a partial ordering
is given for the vertices, such that the vertices of each simplex are
totally ordered. Each simplex a then has a unique representation
a = (v0
v,,) where the vertices of a are listed in order. The chain
complex
of the ordered simplicial complex K is defined as fol-
lows:

A subcomplex L of a simplicial complex K is subset of the simplices
in K such that whenever a simplex if is in L, so are all its faces; then
L is a simplicial complex, with its vertices a subset of the vertices of
V. An ordering of K determines an ordering of L, and one has a ca-
nonical map
determining homomorphisms
on homology groups. If L1 and L2 are subcomplexes of K, the inter-
section L1 fl L2 and union L1 U L2 are also subcomplexes. These maps
determine an exact sequence of chain complexes

quences, and the five-lemma shows that if (b) is true for L1 and U,
and L1 flL2, then (b) is also true for L1 Ut2.
We can now prove (b) by induction on the number of simplices in
the simplicial complex K. Take any vertex v of K. Let L1 be
the
subcomplex consisting of all simplices of K that are contained in a
simplex of K that contains v, and let L2 be the subcomplex consisting
of all simplices of K that do not contain v. Then (b) is known for L1
by Exercise 24.31, and (b) is known for L2 and L1 fl L2 by induction
on the number of vertices. The preceding argument then shows that
(b)holdsforKL1UL1.
Corollary 24.34. If K and L are simplicial complexes whose geo-
metric realizations are homeomorphic, then

Proof. This follows from the fact that a homeomorphism between
spaces induces an isomorphism between their homology groups. U
In the early days of algebraic topology, the homology of a compact
space K was defined by triangulating the space, i.e., finding a homeo-
morphism between some
and X, and taking the homology
With this as the definition the assertion of the preceding corollary—
that homology is a topological invariant of the space—was a serious
problem.
The preceding discussion depended on a choice of ordering of the
simplicial complex, which is how one would usually use the result in

APPENDIX A
Point Set Topology
Al. Some Basic Notions in Topology
A topology on a set X is a collection of subsets, called the open sets, in-
cluding X itself and the empty set, such that any union of open sets is open,
and any finite intersection of open sets is open. A topological space is a set
X together with a topology. A collection of open sets is a basis for the open
sets if any open set is a union of sets in the basis For example, if X is a
metric space, the open balls Bjx)
{v E X: distance (y, 4 < r} form a basis
for a topology on X. In particular, Euclidean space R" with its usual distance
function is a topological space. A neighborhood of a point in a topological
space is an open set containing the point—or, occasionally, any set con-
taining such an open set.
Any subset Y of a topological space is a topological space with the induced
topology: the open sets are those of the form U fl Y, for U open in X. Such
Y is called a topological subspace of X. In particular, any subset of R" is a
topological space. A subset Y is closed if its complement is open. A map
f: X—> Y from one topological space to another is continuous if f '(U) is
open in X for every open set U in Y. A bijectionf. X—> Y is a homeomorph-
ism iffandf
' are continuous
A topological space X is Hausdorff if, for any two distinct points in X,
there are disjoint open sets, one containing one of the points, the other con-
taining the other. Any metric space is Hausdorff. Although we seldom need
to assume spaces are Hausdorff, the reader will lose little by assuming that
all spaces occurring in the book are I-Iausdorff
A subset K of a space X is called compact, if, for any collection of open

The following are some basic facts about compact spaces:

is a compact subset of Y.
(A.2) A compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed.
(A.3) 1ff: X—> Y is continuous and bijective, and X is compact and Y is
Hausdorff, then f is a homeomorphism.
(A.4) A subset K of W is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded.
Exercise A.5. If K and L are disjoint compact subsets in a Hausdorff space
X, show that there are disjoint open sets in X, one containing K, the other
containing L.
Exercise A.6. If K is compact, and, for each positive integer n,
is a
nonempty subset of K, show that there is a limit point, i.e., a point P in K
such that every neighborhood of P meets A,, for an infinite number of in-
tegers n.

If X and Y are topological spaces, the Cartesian products U x V of open
sets U in X and V in Y form a basis for a topology in the Cartesian product
X x V. called the product topology.
If X and V are topological spaces, the disjoint union XJ.J. V is a topological
space. A set in the disjoint union is open when it is the union of an open
set in X and an open set in V. More generally, if
a E s4} is any collection
of topological spaces, the disjoint union
is a topological space, with
open sets disjoint unions of open sets in each
X can be made into a topological space with the discrete topology,
in which every subset of X is open. Equivalently, all points are open.

A2. Connected Components
369
The interior of a subset A of a topological space, denoted Int(A), is the
set of points that have a neighborhood contained in A. The closure of a
subset A, denoted A, is the intersection of all closed sets containing A.
A2. Connected Components
A topological space X is connected if it cannot be written as a union of two
nonempty disjoint sets, each of which is open in X
Exercise A.9. Show that each of the following is equivalent to X being
connected: (i) X has no nonempty proper subset that is both open and closed;
(ii) X cannot be written as the union of two nonempty disjoint closed subsets;
and (iii) there is no continuous mapping from X onto the discrete space

The following are basic facts about connected spaces:
(A. 10) 1ff:
V is a continuous, surjective mapping, and X is connected,
then V is connected.
(A.l 1) If X is a subspace of a space V. andX is connected, then the closure
X of X in V is also connected.
(A. 12) If X is a union of a family of subspaces Xa, each of which is con-
nected, and each pair of which have nonempty intersection, then X
is connected.
(A. 13) The connected subsets of
are the intervals.
A connected component of X is a connected subset that is not contained
in any larger connected subset. Each connected component is closed in X.
Any two connected components of X are disjoint. The union of all connected
subsets of X containing a point x is a connected component, called the con-
nected component of x in X. The space X is a disjoint union of its connected
components.
Exercise A.14. Let XCW be the union of the points (0,0), (0,1), and the
lines {l/n} x [0, 1], n = 1, 2
Show that these are the connected com-
ponents of X, but whenever X is written as the union of two open and closed
subsets, the points (0, 0) and (0, 1) belong to the same subset.
A space is called locally connected if for every neighborhood V of every
point x, there is a connected open neighborhood U of x that is contained
in V.
Exercise A.15. If X is locally connected, show that all the connected com-
ponents of X are open in X.

370
Appendix A. Point Set Topology
A space X is path-connected if, for any two points x and y in X, there is
a continuous mapping
from an interval [a, bJ to X that maps a to x and b
to y. A space is locally path-connected if every neighborhood of every point
contains a path-connected neighborhood of the point.
Exercise A.16. If X is locally path-connected, show that all the connected
components of X are path-connected and open in X.
In particular, for U open in the plane or
the connected components
of U are open and path-connected.
A3. Patching
If a topological space X is the union of two sets A and B, both open or both
closed, and f: A—. Y and g:
Y are continuous mappings from A and B
to a space V. such thatf and g agree on A flB, then there is a unique con-
tinuous mapping h from X to V that agrees with Jon A and with g on B.
If Y is a topological space, and R
is any equivalence relation on Y,
the
set Y/R of equivalence classes is given the quotient topology: a set U is
open in Y/R exactly when its inverse image in V is open. 1ff: Y—>Z is a
continuous mapping that maps all points in each equivalence class to the
same point, thenf determines a continuous mapping f: Y/R—÷Z so that the
composite Y—. Y/R-.Z isf
Suppose V1 and V2 are two spaces, with open subsets U1 of Y1 and U2 of
V2. and a homeomorphism
U1 —>
is given between them Then one can
patch (or glue, or clutch) the spaces V1 and V2 together, to form a space V
There will be maps

V and p2: V2—÷ Y; V will be the union of the
open subsets
and p2(V2), each
will map V, homeomorphically onto
p1(V1), with p1(U1)p2(U2), and * will be the composite P2°P on U
YIcII.U1

One can construct Y as the quotient space V1 U V2/R, where R is the equiv-
alence relation consisting of pairs (u1 , 0(u1)) for u1 in U1, and of course the
symmetric pairs (0(u1), u3, together with all pairs (y1 ,y1) for y, in V1 and
all pairs (y2,y2) fory7 in V2.

(2) p0 is a homeomorphism of V0 onto
(3) V is the union of the sets ço0(V0);
(4)

(5) on
Proof. The fact that p0 is one-to-one onto its image, and the assertions (3)—
(5), are set-theoretic verifications, and left to the reader. The topology on
Y is defined to make each p0 continuous. To prove (I) and (2), it suffices
to verify that if U is open in some Y0, then p0(U) is open in Y, i.e., that,
for all
is open in V0. But

is open since Ufl

A4. Lebesgue Lemma
We make frequent use of the following lemma:
Lemma A.19. (Lebesgue Lemma). Given any covering of a compact metric
space K by open sets, there is an e >0 such that any subset of K of diameter
less than & is contained in some open set in the covering.

372
Appendix A. Point Set Topology
Proof. If not, there is for every integer n a subset
of K with diameter
less than 1/n and not contained in any open set of the covering. From the
fact that K is compact it follows that there is a limit point P, see Exercise
A.6. Let U be an open set of the covering that contains P. and take r> 0
so all points within distance r of P are contained in U. There must be (in-
finitely many) n with I/n < r/2 such that
meets the open ball of radius
r/2 around P. But such
must be contained in U, a contradiction.
El
The following lemma will be used in Appendix B to construct a partition
of unity:
Lemma A.20. if U is an open set in W', there is a sequence of compact
subsets K1, "2

Proof. Start with any countable sequence of open sets U, that cover U
such that the closure U, is compact and contained in U; for example,
one can take the U, to be balls at centers with rational coordinates and
rational radii. Take K1 = U1. Then take "2 = U1 U .

B2. Partition of Unity
For construction of the Mayer—Vietons sequence for open sets in the plane,
we need the following result:
Proposition B.1O (Partition of Unity). Suppose an open set U in
is the
union of a sequence U,, U2,
.
. . of open sets with the property that each
point is contained in U1 for only finitely many i. Then there is a sequence
of nonnegative cc functions cp1 on U such that the closure (in U) of the
support of ço1 is contained in U1, and
1 on U.
(We will construct these functions so that only finitely many
are nonzero
in a neighborhood of any point of U, so the sum is a well-defined cc func-
tion.)
Proof. There are several steps.

376
Appendix B. Analysis
Step 1. There is a C functionf on
that is zero on the negative half line
and positive on the positive half line. Such a function is
f(x)
= fexp(_i)
if x>O,
(p
if xO.
Exercise B.11. Verify that this is infinitely differentiable by showing that
any derivative of exp(— I /x) has the form (P(x)/xm)exp(— I /x) for some
polynomial P and some exponent m.
Step 2
Given a bounded rectangle (a1 , b1) X
.
. . X (ar, bj, there is a C
function h in W that is positive on the rectangle, and zero outside the rect-
angle. in fact, the function g(x)
f(x)
—x) is positive on (0, 1) and zero
outside this interval, and this leads to the required function
h(x1
=
1=1
Step 3
If A is a compact subset of U, there are cc functions a. so that the
closure of the support of a1 is contained in U,, and the sum
is every-
where positive on A. To construct them cover A by a finite number of rect-
angles Ra such that the closure of each Ra is contained in some U1, and use
Step 2 to construct ha that are positive on Ra and zero outside. Take
to
be the sum of those ha such that Ra is contained in U1, let a2 be the sum
of those among the others such that the closure of the support is contained
in U2, and continue in this way until all ha are used; set the other a, equal
to zero.

In this book, unless otherwise stated, vector spaces are real vector spaces.
The vector space I? consists of n-tuples (x1,

of real numbers, with
coordinatewise addition and multiplication by scalars. A set of elements
is a basis for a vector space if every element in the space has a unique
expression in the form
for some real numbers
with only finitely
many Xa nonzero. A vector space is finite dimensional if it has a finite basis.
The number of elements in a basis is independent of choice of basis, and is
the dimension of the space; the dimension of V is denoted dim(V). Choosing
a basis e1
for V sets up an isomorphism of V with W', with the
vector x1e1 + .

standard basis of

where e, has a I for its ith coordinate,
and zeros for the other coordinates.
If L. V--> W is a linear mapping, the kernel Ker(L) is the subspace of V
consisting of vectors mapped to zero, and the image lm(L)
is the subspace
of W consisting of vectors that can be written L(v) for some v in V
The rank-nullity theorem asserts that if L: V—÷ W is a linear mapping of
finite-dimensional vector spaces,
dim(Ker(L))+dim(lm(L))
dim(V).
If W is a subspace of a vector space V, the quotient space V/W is defined
to be the set of equivalence classes of elements of V. two vectors in V being
equivalent if their difference is in W. This set V/W has a natural structure
of a vector space, so that the mapping from V to V/W that takes a vector

this mapping from V to V/W is W
Conversely, if %/—* U is a surjective linear mapping of vector spaces, and
W is the kernel, this determines an isomorphism of V/W with U.
Suppose L: V—* V' is a linear mapping of vector spaces, and W is a sub-
space of V, and W' a subspace of V'. If L(W) is contained in W, then L

C2. Groups; Free Abelian Groups
A set of elements in a group G generates G if every element in G can be
written as a (finite) product of elements in the set and inverses of elements
in the set.
If H is a subgroup of a group G, a left coset is a subset of G of the form
g H = jg h: h E H}. The group G is a disjoint union of its left cosets; g1
and g2 are in the same left coset exactly when there is an element h in H
with g1
h
g2. The set of left cosets is denoted by G/H. There is a natural
map iT from G onto G/H that takes an element in G to the coset containing
it. A subgroup H is a normal subgroup if, for all g in G and h in H,
h
is in H. In this case
gets the structure of a group, in such a way that
the natural map
G—> G/H is a homomorphism of groups.
The identity element in a group G is usually denoted by e, or eG if there
is chance of confusion. lf p: G—' C is a homomorphism of groups, the
kernel N = {g E G: p(g) = eG } is a normal subgroup of G, denoted Ker(p)
Then p determines a one-to-one homomorphism
G/Ker(p)—> G' such that

C2. Groups; Free Abelian Groups
381
p
If p is surjective, then
is an isomorphism. More generally, if
N is any normal subgroup of G, a homomorphism from G/N to a group G'
determines a homomorphism from G to G' such that N is contained in its
kernel. The image p(G) of any homomorphism p. G—>G' is a subgroup of
G', denoted Im(p), and p determines an isomorphism of G/Ker(p) with
Im(p). IfNCG and N' CG' are normal subgroups, and p: G—*G' is a ho-
momorphism such that p(N) C N', then p determines a homomorphism
G to G' is denoted by Hom(G, G'). So
if N is a normal subgroup of G,
Hom(G/N,G') e {pEHom(G,G'): p(I'fl=eG}.
An important normal subgroup of a group G is the commutator subgroup,
denoted [G, Gi. This consists of all finite products
g1h1g('h('

.
.
.
for elements g1, h1, g2, h2
in G. The normality of this subgroup
group, any homomorphism of G to A sends all commutators to the identity,
so
Hom(G/[G,GI,A)
-* Hom(G,A).
We usually use an additive notation for the product in abelian groups,
writing g + h instead of g h, with the identity element denoted 0. The group
of integers under addition, which is the infinite cyclic group, is denoted /.
The abelian group with just one element is often denoted 0. If A is an abelian
group, and X is any set, the set of functions from X to A has a natural
structure of abelian group, with (f+ g)(x) =f(x) + g(x). In particular, if G
is any group, the set of homomorphisms Hom(G, A) has the structure of an
abelian group.
Exercise C.4. If p: G—*G' is a homomorphism of groups, show that the
mapping from Hom(G',A) to I-Iom(G,A) that takes 4, to 4iop is a homo-
morphism of abelian groups.
If A and B are abelian groups, the direct sum A E?B is the set of pairs
(a,b),
with
a

A
and
b

with
addition
defined
by
(a,b)+(a',b')(a+a',b+b'). More generally, given any collection Aa
of abelian groups, the direct sum
consists of collections
with

with the condition that a0 can be nonzero for only finitely many a.
Addition is defined component by component, as for two factors. For ex-
ample, 71" is the direct sum of n copies of 71. The same definition, but with-
out the restriction that only finitely many are nonzero, defines the direct
product, denoted HA0.
Exercise C.5. If an abelian group C contains subgroups A and B such that

382

every element of C can be written as a sum of an element in A and an
element in B, and A fl B
{O}, show that A EBB is isomorphic to C.
Exercise C.6. For any collection

group B, construct an isomorphism
Hom(EBA1,B)
A
abelian group, with bastc {e0}, if every ele-
ment in the group has a unique expression in the form
for some in-
tegers nQ, with only finitely many n1 nonzero. If the number of elements in
a basis is a finite number n, we say A is a free abelian group of rank n. As
we will see below, this number is independent of choice of basis.
Exercise C.7. (a) If A and B are free abelian groups, show that A EBB is
free abelian, and if the ranks are finite, rank(AEDB)=rank(A)+rank(B).
(b) If F is free abelian, and A is abelian, and p: A—*F is a surjective ho-
momorphism, show that A is isomorphic to the direct sum of F and Ker(p).
More generally, a set {eQ} of elements in an abelian group A is called
linearly independent if no linear combination of them is zero, i e., there is
no set of integers
with only finitely many nonzero, but not all zero,
such that
= 0. The maximum number of elements in a linearly inde-
pendent set in A is called the rank of A. We will prove at the end of this
section that any two maximal linearly independent sets have the same num-
ber of elements, at least when this number is finite.
Unlike the case with vector spaces, however, a maximal set of linearly
independent elements in an abelian group need not generate the group. For
example, a finite abelian group has no independent elements. Even for groups
with no elements of finite order, however, it is not true.
Exercise C.8. Show that the rank of the abelian group Q of rational numbers
is
1.
For any set X, the free abe/ian group on X, denoted F(X), can be defined
as the set of finite formal linear combinations inrx, with n, integers, the
sum over a finite subset of X. The addition is defined coordinate-wise:
+
= >(n, + rn1)x. More precisely, define F(X) to be the set of
functions from X to 1 that are zero except on a finite subset of X. This is
an abelian subgroup of the abelian group of functions from X to 1. To the
function f:
1 is associated the expression Ef(x)x. The element x cor-
responds to the function that takes x to I and all other elements of X to zero.
These elements form a basis for F(X).
For any abelian group A, and any function p from a set X to A, there is
a unique homomorphism from F(X) to A that takes
to

ticular, if p:

Lemma C.1O. If p: A—*A' is one-to-one, then cp* is surjective
Proof. We need some preliminaries. There exists a set 9/3 =
a E
of
elements in A', such that:
(i) no finite linear combination
with integer coefficients is in the
image of p unless all
are zero; and
(ii) 9/3 is maximal with this property
This is a consequence of Zorn's lemma, exactly as in the proof that every
vector space has a basis. Of course, there may be many such sets 9/3, but
we fix one It follows that for any element x in A', there is a nonzero integer
n and integers
all zero except for finitely many, so that in —
is
in p(A); otherwise one could enlarge 913 by adding x to it. Therefore for any
x in A' there is at least one equation of the form
(C.ll)
in
with y in A, n not 0.
Givenf in Hom(A,
we define g in Hom(A',
by setting
g(x) = —(f(y)),
n
for any integer
and yEA so that (C.ll) holds. To see that g is well
defined, suppose also
mx =

Then

By (i), this element must be zero, and since p is one-to-one, nz must be
equal to my. Therefore,

Corollary C.12. Suppose S is a set with n elements in an abe/ian group A,
and S is a maximal set of linearly independent elements. Then the dimension
of Hom(A,
is equal to n. in particular, any two maximal sets of linearly
independent elements in A have the same number of elements.
Proof. Let F be the free abelian group on 5, and p: F—*A the natural map.
The linear independence of S assures that p is one-to-one. The maximality
of S assures that the set
considered in the proof of the lemma is empty.
The proof of the lemma shows that the map
from Hom(A, R) to Uom(F, R)
is an isomorphism. The functions that take value 1 on a given element in
5, and value 0 on the other elements, give a basis of Hom(F, ER) with n
elements, and this shows that the dimension of Hom(A, ER) is n. Note that
if S were a maximal set of linearly independent elements that were infinite,

that

Given homomorphism p: A—*B and ui: B—>C, one says that the sequence
is exact, or exact at B if the image of p is equal to the kernel
of uP. To say that the sequence 0—*A--->B is exact is the same as saying the
map from A to B is one-to-one, and to say that

same as saying the map from A to B is surjective.

C3. Polynomials; Gauss's Lemma
For any field K the nng of polynomials KIX1 in a variable X over K is a
unique factorization domain. In fact, every nonzero P in K[X] has a unique
factorization P =
with a in K and each P an irreducible polynomial
that is monic.9 This follows from the fact that one has a division algorithm
for polynomials, just as one has for integers. In particular, any finite col-
lection of nonzero polynomials has a greatest common divisor, which is
unique if, in addition, it is required to be monic. The quotient field of K[X],
consisting of all ratios P/Q, Q
0, is denoted K(X).
The ring of polynomials K[X, Y I in two variables X and Y is a subring of
the ring K(X)IY], which, by what we have just seen, is a unique factori-
zation domain.
Lemma C.17 (Gauss). Let F he a polynomial in K[X, YI. 1fF is irreducible
in K(X) [Yl, then F is irreducible in KIX, 1'].
Proof. Given F in K[X,Y], write F=a0(X)+a1(X)Y+ .

with
a,(X) in KIX]. The greatest common divisor of a0(X)
is called
the content of F, and denoted c(F). Call F primitive if c(F) = I.

primitive.

Since all the terms but the first are divisible by p, and the first is not, this
is a contradiction.

domain. Generalize to polynomials in n variables.
If P is a polynomial in K[XJ,
the residue class ring

of equivalence classes of polynomials in K[XI, two being equivalent when
their difference is divisible by P. The residue classes KIX]/(P) have the
structure of a ring so that the natural map KIX1—>KIX1/(P) is a homo-
morphism of rings.

The object of this section is to prove Lemmas 7. 10 and 7. 11; we refer to
Chapter 7 for notation. Suppose p: U—* U' is a diffeornorphism from one
open set in the plane onto another. If p(x,y) = (u(x,y), v(x,y)) in coordi-
nates, at any point P in U, we have the Jacobian matrix

To prove this claim, we use Lemma B.9, replacing U by a smaller disk

with Cr functions u1, u2, v1, and v. Then

We are therefore reduced to showing that

and we leave the details as an exercise. (This is also special ease of the fact
that the degree of a composite of mappings of circles is the product of the

Now we consider the other lemma from Chapter 7.

D2. Charts and Vector Fields
389
Lemma D.4. Suppose V and W are continuous vector fields with no sin-
gularities on an open set U containing a point P. Let Ii C U be a closed
disk centered at_P. Then there is a vector field V with no singularities on
U such that (i) V and V agree on U \ D; (ii) V and W agree on some neigh-
borhood of P.
Proof. Suppose
first that the dot product V(P)' W(P) is positive Shrinking
the disk, we may assume that V(Q) W(Q) > 0 for all Q in D. As in Step 2
of the proof of Proposition B. 10 (see Exercise B. 14), there is a
function
p that is identically
1 in a neighborhood of P. and identically 0 outside D,
and taking values in 10, ii. Let
V(Q) = (l—p(Q))V(Q)+p(Q)W(Q).
Then
V(Q)>0 for all Q in U, so Vhas no singularities, and con-
ditions (i) and (ii) are clear.
For the general case, it therefore suffices to find a vector field V1 with
no singularities that agrees with V outside D, and such that V1(P)' W(P) is
positive. This can be done by rotating V inside D. With the same func-
tion

D2. Charts and Vector Fields
We start with a brief definition of a (smooth) surface X, and define what
we mean by a vector field on X and the index of a vector field at a point
on X. A surface X with an atlas of charts is a Hausdorff topological space,
equipped with a collection of homeomorphisms
U,, —*
C X,
with UL, open in the plane W, and
open in X; the a are in some index
set. The surface X should be the union of these open sets p0(Uj. Let

nate mappings

changes of coordinates
should be CF mappings for all a and

Another collection of charts
—*x} is said to be equivalent to this
one if all the changes of coordinates from one to the other are all CC, i.e.,
all
are CF where defined. We say that this collection defines the
same surface. More precisely, a smooth (or
surface
is the topological
space X together with an equivalence class of families of charts. For the
sphere S2, the two mappings p and 4s we obtained from stereographic pro-
jection in §7c form a family of charts. Stereographic projection from other
points gives charts that are compatible in this sense.
1ff is a CF function on some open set in W, and X is the locus where
fix, y, z) = 0 and grad(f) # 0, then X is a smooth surface. If for example
(3f/8z)(P)
0, the implicit function theorem says that projection from X to
the xy-plane is locally one-to-one near P. and the inverse to this projection
provides a chart near P
If X is a surface given by charts as above, a vector field V on X can be
defined as a compatible collection of vector fields
in each of the coor-
dinate neighborhoods U,,
The compatibility means that

to he the index of V at P.
The surface X is orientable if it has an atlas of charts such that all the
determinants of the Jacobians of the change of coordinate mappings are pos-
itive. An orientation is a choice of such an atlas, with two atlases defining

tions, with two orientations defining the opposite orientation if all changes

APPENDIX E
Proof of Borsuk's Theorem
This appendix contains a proof of Borsuk's theorem as statcd in §23c. It
assumes a knowledge of §23a and §23h.
So far in this book we have considered chains
with integer coeffi-
cients n1. In fact, one can use coefficients in any abelian group G, and one
gets chains Ck(X; G), cycles Zk(X;G), and boundaries RL(X; G), so homol-
ogy groups Hk(X;G)
All the formal properties proved
about ordinary homology groups extend without change to these groups, and
many of the calculations are similar. For example, the Mayer—Vietoris theo-
rem is true without change.
It is often useful to look at coefficients in lip!, the integers modulo a
prime p. In this case there is a natural homomorphism from each Hk(X) to
I-Ik(X;!/pZ,) obtained by reducing all coefficients modulo p. This gives
homomorphisms
Hh(X)/pHk(X) —*
These homomorphisms are isomorphisms if X is a sphere, as one sees by
tracing through the Mayer—Vietoris argument computing the homology of a
sphere. The following exercise shows that it is not always an isomorphism,
however.
Exercise E.I. (a) Show that the above map is an isomorphism if X is a
compact onented surface. (b) Show that, for X the real projective plane, or
any compact surface, H2(X; 1/21) = 1/21.
These homology groups are particularly useful when p = 2. In fact, every-

It follows from the isomorphism
that for any
continuous map f: 5'—> 5", the degree of f is odd if the homomorphism
f*:Hn(S")—>Hn(S") is not 7ero, and even if

tipodal map by
T:S" —> Sn.
Let 'rr: 5"—>
be the two-sheeted covenng map that identifies antipodal
points. We will prove Borsuk's theorem by using the chain complex and
homology of these spaces and maps with coefficients in 1/2/. For this we
need a general lemma.
Let 'rr: X—> Y be any two-sheeted covering map, and let T: X—?*X be the
map which interchanges the two points in ic '(P) for each P in Y. The cor-
responding map

of chain complexes is surjective. In fact,
if IT: P—> Y is a k-cube, there are exactly two k-cubes A1 and A2 = To A1 in
X with ir°A, = F This is proved exactly as we proved the lifting of hom-
otopies in §1 lb. The mapping
A1 + A2 determines a homomorphism
Y—>X of chain complexes, called the transfer (see Problem 18.26).
A chain is in the kernel of

It follows from this lemma that the corresponding maps between the long

Hints and Answers
Hints and/or answers are given for some of the exercises and problems,
especially those used in the text, or those that are hard.
0. 1. Hint: The answer depends only on the numbers of edges that emanate
from each vertex. What happens to these numbers when you travel, erasing
the edges as you travel over them? When do you get stuck at a vertex?
Answer: There is always an even number of vertices such that the number
of edges emanating from the vertex is odd (if an edge has both ends at a
vertex, it counts twice). If this number is greater than 2, the graph cannot
be traced. If the number is 2, it can be traced, but only by starting at one
of these, and (necessarily) ending at the other. If the number is 0, you can
start anywhere, and will end at where you start. To see that one can do it
under these conditions, one way is to make any trip, starting at an odd vertex
if there are two such, continuing until you get stuck. Then make another
trip, but adding a side trip along untraveled roads, until you (necessarily)
get back to the old route at the same point. Each trip becomes longer, until
the whole is traced.
