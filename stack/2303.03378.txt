Figure 1: PaLM-E is a single general-purpose multimodal language model for embodied reasoning tasks, visual-language tasks,
and language tasks. PaLM-E transfers knowledge from visual-language domains into embodied reasoning – from robot planning in
environments with complex dynamics and physical constraints, to answering questions about the observable world. PaLM-E operates on
multimodal sentences, i.e. sequences of tokens where inputs from arbitrary modalities (e.g. images, neural 3D representations, or states, in
green and blue) are inserted alongside text tokens (in orange) as input to an LLM, trained end-to-end.
Abstract
Large language models have been demonstrated to perform
complex tasks. However, enabling general inference in the
real world, e.g. for robotics problems, raises the challenge
of grounding. We propose embodied language models to di-
rectly incorporate real-world continuous sensor modalities
into language models and thereby establish the link be-
tween words and percepts. Input to our embodied language
model are multi-modal sentences that interleave visual, con-
tinuous state estimation, and textual input encodings. We
train these encodings end-to-end, in conjunction with a pre-
trained large language model, for multiple embodied tasks
including sequential robotic manipulation planning, visual
question answering, and captioning. Our evaluations show
that PaLM-E, a single large embodied multimodal model,
can address a variety of embodied reasoning tasks, from a
variety of observation modalities, on multiple embodiments,
and further, exhibits positive transfer: the model beneﬁts
from diverse joint training across internet-scale language,
vision, and visual-language domains. Our largest model,
PaLM-E-562B with 562B parameters, in addition to being
trained on robotics tasks, is a visual-language generalist
with state-of-the-art performance on OK-VQA, and retains
generalist language capabilities with increasing scale.
1. Introduction
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reason-
ing capabilities across various domains, including dialogue
(Glaese et al., 2022; Thoppilan et al., 2022), step-by-step
reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Kojima et al., 2022), math prob-
lem solving (Lewkowycz et al., 2022; Polu et al., 2022), and
code writing (Chen et al., 2021a). However, a limitation of
such models for inference in the real world is the issue of
grounding: while training LLMs on massive textual data
may lead to representations that relate to our physical world,
connecting those representations to real-world visual and
physical sensor modalities is essential to solving a wider
range of grounded real-world problems in computer vision
and robotics (Tellex et al., 2020). Previous work (Ahn et al.,
2022) interfaces the output of LLMs with learned robotic
policies and affordance functions to make decisions, but is
limited in that the LLM itself is only provided with textual
input, which is insufﬁcient for many tasks where the geo-
metric conﬁguration of the scene is important. Further, in
our experiments we show that current state-of-the-art visual-
language models trained on typical vision-language tasks
such as visual-question-answering (VQA) cannot directly
solve robotic reasoning tasks.
In this paper we propose embodied language models, which

Figure 2: PaLM-E-562B can do zero-shot multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, can tell visually-conditioned jokes given an image, and
demonstrates an array of robot-relevant multimodal-informed capabilities including perception, visually-grounded dialogue, and planning.
PaLM-E also generalizes, zero-shot, to multi-image prompts despite only being trained on single-image prompts. PaLM-E can also
perform math given an image with textually-interleaved handwritten numbers. In addition, the model can perform, zero-shot, question and
answering on temporally-annotated egocentric vision, similar to what was shown in (Zeng et al., 2022) but end-to-end all in one model.
directly incorporate continuous inputs from sensor modali-
ties of an embodied agent and thereby enable the language
model itself to make more grounded inferences for sequen-
tial decision making in the real world. Inputs such as images
and state estimates are embedded into the same latent embed-
ding as language tokens and processed by the self-attention
layers of a Transformer-based LLM in the same way as text.
We start from a pre-trained LLM in which we inject the
continuous inputs through an encoder. These encoders are
trained end-to-end to output sequential decisions in terms of
natural text that can be interpreted by the embodied agent
by conditioning low-level policies or give an answer to an
embodied question. We evaluate the approach in a vari-
ety of settings, comparing different input representations
(e.g. standard vs. object-centric ViT encodings for visual
input), freezing vs. ﬁnetuning the language model while
training the encoders, and investigating whether co-training
on multiple tasks enables transfer.
To investigate the approach’s breadth, we evaluate on three
robotic manipulation domains (two of which are closed-
loop in the real-world), standard visual-language tasks such
as VQA and image captioning, as well as language tasks.
Our results indicate that multi-task training improves perfor-
mance compared to training models on individual tasks. We
show that this transfer across tasks can lead to high data-
efﬁciency for robotics tasks, e.g. signiﬁcantly increasing
learning success from handfuls of training examples, and
even demonstrating one-shot or zero-shot generalization to
novel combinations of objects or unseen objects.
We scale PaLM-E up to 562B parameters, integrating the
540B PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022) LLM and the 22B
Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dehghani et al., 2023) into, to
our knowledge, the largest vision-language model currently
reported. PaLM-E-562B achieves state-of-the-art perfor-
mance on the OK-VQA (Marino et al., 2019) benchmark,
without relying on task-speciﬁc ﬁnetuning. Although not
the focus of our experimentation, we also ﬁnd (Fig. 2) that
PaLM-E-562B exhibits a wide array of capabilities includ-
ing zero-shot multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning,
few-shot prompting, OCR-free math reasoning, and multi-
image reasoning, despite being trained on only single-image
examples. Zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022), originally a
language-only concept, has been shown on multimodal data
with task-speciﬁc programs (Zeng et al., 2022) but to our
knowledge, not via an end-to-end model.
To summarize our main contributions, we (1) propose
and demonstrate that a generalist, transfer-learned, multi-
embodiment decision-making agent can be trained via mix-
ing in embodied data into the training of a multimodal large

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
language model. We show that, (2) while current state-of-
the-art general-purpose visual-language models out-of-the-
box (zero-shot) do not well address embodied reasoning
problems, it is possible to train a competent general-purpose
visual-language model that is also an efﬁcient embodied
reasoner. In studying how to best train such models, we (3)
introduce novel architectural ideas such as neural scene rep-
resentations and entity-labeling multimodal tokens. Finally,
in addition to our focus on PaLM-E as an embodied reasoner
we (4) show that PaLM-E is also a quantitatively compe-
tent vision and language generalist, and (5) demonstrate
that scaling the language model size enables multimodal
ﬁnetuning with less catastrophic forgetting.
2. Related Work
General vision-language modeling.
Building on suc-
cesses in large language (Brown et al., 2020; Devlin et al.,
2018) and vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) models, recent
years have seen a growing interest in large vision-language
models (VLMs) (Li et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019; Hao et al.,
2022; Gan et al., 2022). Unlike their predecessors, VLMs
are capable of simultaneously understanding both images
and text, and can be applied to tasks such as visual ques-
tion answering (Zhou et al., 2020; Zellers et al., 2021b),
captioning (Hu et al., 2022), optical character recognition
(Li et al., 2021), and object detection (Chen et al., 2021b).
The methods by which images are integrated varies. For ex-
ample, Alayrac et al. (2022) augments pretrained language
models with a mechanism to directly attend to a single con-
text image. In contrast, PaLM-E represents images and
text as “multimodal sentences” of latent vectors, allowing
it to process multiple images in a ﬂexible way within any
part of a sentence. More closely related to our work is
Frozen (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021) where vision encoder
parameters are optimized via backpropagation through a
frozen LLM (Lu et al., 2021). Inspired by this work, we
investigate the design in a broader scope by introducing
alternative input modalities (e.g. neural scene representa-
tions), and our proposed approach empirically outperforms
Frozen by more than 45% on the VQAv2 benchmark. More
importantly we demonstrate that PaLM-E is applicable not
only to perceptual but also embodied tasks.
Actions-output models. Prior works focus on combining
vision and language inputs in an embodied setting with the
goal of direct action prediction (Guhur et al., 2022; Shridhar
et al., 2022b;a; Zhang & Chai, 2021; Silva et al., 2021; Jang
et al., 2022; Nair et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2022; Brohan
et al., 2022). Among these methods, VIMA (Jiang et al.,
2022) explores multimodal prompts similar to PaLM-E. The
role of language is perhaps most aptly described as task
speciﬁcation in these works. In contrast, PaLM-E generates
high-level instructions as text; in doing so, the model is
able to naturally condition upon its own predictions and di-
rectly leverage the world knowledge embedded in its param-
eters. This enables not only embodied reasoning but also
question answering, as demonstrated in our experiments.
Among works that output actions, perhaps most similar is
the approach proposed in Gato (Reed et al., 2022) which,
like PaLM-E, is a generalist multi-embodiment agent. In
contrast to Gato, we demonstrate positive transfer across
different tasks where the model beneﬁts from diverse joint
training across multiple domains.
LLMs in embodied task planning. There have been sev-
eral methods proposed to leverage LLMs in embodied do-
mains. While many works focus on understanding natural
language goals (Lynch & Sermanet, 2020; Shridhar et al.,
2022a; Nair et al., 2022; Lynch et al., 2022), fewer con-
sider natural language as a representation for planning –
the focus of this work. LLMs contain vast amounts of in-
ternalized knowledge about the world (Bommasani et al.,
2021), but without grounding, generated plans may be im-
possible to execute. One line of research has employed
prompting to elicit a sequence of instructions directly from
an LLM either by leveraging semantic similarity between an
LLM’s generation and an eligible set of instructions (Huang
et al., 2022b), incorporating affordance functions (Ahn et al.,
2022), visual feedback (Huang et al., 2022c), generating
world models (Nottingham et al., 2023; Zellers et al., 2021a),
planning over graphs and maps (Shah et al., 2022; Huang
et al., 2022a), visual explanations (Wang et al., 2023), pro-
gram generation (Liang et al., 2022; Singh et al., 2022), or
injecting information into the prompt (Zeng et al., 2022). In
contrast, PaLM-E is trained to generate plans directly with-
out relying on auxiliary models for grounding. This in turn
enables direct integration of the rich semantic knowledge
stored in pretrained LLMs into the planning process.
With few exceptions, the parameters of the LLMs employed
in many of these works are employed as-is without further
training. In LID (Li et al., 2022), this constraint is relaxed
and LLM parameters are ﬁnetuned to produce a planning net-
work for generating high-level instructions. (SL)3 (Sharma
et al., 2021) tackles the more challenging task of simulta-
neously ﬁnetuning two LLMs: a planning network, which
produces high-level instructions, and a low-level policy net-
work, which selects actions. With PaLM-E, our interests
are distinct and complementary: we investigate a generalist,
multi-embodiment model, across multiple modalities.
3. PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal
Language Model
The main architectural idea of PaLM-E is to inject continu-
ous, embodied observations such as images, state estimates,
or other sensor modalities into the language embedding
space of a pre-trained language model. This is realized by
encoding the continuous observations into a sequence of

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
vectors with the same dimension as the embedding space of
the language tokens. The continuous information is hence
injected into the language model in an analogous way to
language tokens. PaLM-E is a decoder-only LLM that gen-
erates textual completions autoregressively given a preﬁx or
prompt. We call our model PaLM-E, since we use PaLM
(Chowdhery et al., 2022) as the pre-trained language model,
and make it Embodied.
The inputs to PaLM-E consist of text and (multiple) con-
tinuous observations. The multimodal tokens correspond-
ing to these observations are interleaved with the text
to form multi-modal sentences. An example of such a
multi-modal sentence is Q: What happened between
<img 1> and <img 2>? where <img i> represents an em-
bedding of an image. The output of PaLM-E is text gen-
erated auto-regressively by the model, which could be an
answer to a question, or a sequence of decisions produced by
PaLM-E in textual form that should be executed by a robot.
When PaLM-E is tasked with producing decisions or plans,
we assume that there exists a low-level policy or planner that
can translate these decisions into low-level actions. Prior
work has discussed a variety of ways to train such low-level
policies (Lynch & Sermanet, 2020; Brohan et al., 2022), and
we use these prior methods directly without modiﬁcation.
In the following, we describe our approach more formally.
Decoder-only LLMs. Decoder-only large language models
(LLMs) are generative models trained to predict the proba-
bility p(w1:L) of a piece of text w1:L = (w1, . . . , wL) that
is represented as a sequence of tokens wi ∈W. Typical
neural architectures realize this by factorizing into
p(w1:L) =
L
Y
l=1
pLM(wl|w1:l−1),
(1)
where pLM is a large transformer network.
Preﬁx-decoder-only LLMs.
Since the LLM is auto-
regressive, a pre-trained model can be conditioned on a
preﬁx w1:n without the necessity to change the architecture
p(wn+1:L|w1:n) =
L
Y
l=n+1
pLM(wl|w1:l−1).
(2)
The preﬁx or prompt w1:n provides the context based on
which the LLM continues to predict the subsequent tokens
wn+1:L. This is often used for inference to steer the predic-
tions of the model. For example, the prompt can contain a
description of the task the LLM should solve or examples
of desired text completions for similar tasks.
Token embedding space. The tokens wi are elements of a
ﬁxed vocabulary W which is a discrete, ﬁnite set correspond-
ing to (sub)words in natural language. Internally, the LLM
embeds wi into a word token embedding space X ⊂Rk via
γ : W →X, i.e. pLM(wl|x1:l−1) with xi = γ(wi) ∈Rk.
The mapping γ is typically represented as a large embed-
ding matrix of size k × |W| and trained end-to-end. In our
case, |W| = 256 000 (Chowdhery et al., 2022).
Multi-modal sentences: injection of continuous observa-
tions. Multi-modal information such as image observations
can be injected into the LLM by skipping the discrete token
level and directly mapping the continuous observations into
the language embedding space X. To this end, we train an
encoder φ : O →X q that maps a (continuous) observa-
tion space O (refer to Sec. 4 for details) into a sequence of
q-many vectors in X. These vectors are then interleaved
with normal embedded text tokens to form the preﬁx for the
LLM. This means that each vector xi in the preﬁx is formed
from either the word token embedder γ or an encoder φi:
xi =
(
γ(wi)
if i a is text token, or
φj(Oj)i
if i corresponds to observation Oj. (3)
Note that a single observation Oj is usually encoded into
multiple embedding vectors. It is possible to interleave
different encoders φi at different locations in the preﬁx
to combine, e.g., information from different observation
spaces. Injecting the continuous information this way into
the LLM reuses its existing positional encodings. In contrast
to other VLM approaches (e.g, (Chen et al., 2022)), the
observation embeddings are not inserted at ﬁxed positions,
but instead placed dynamically within the surrounding text.
Embodying the output: PaLM-E in a robot control loop.
PaLM-E is a generative model producing text based on
multi-model sentences as input. In order to connect the
output of the model to an embodiment, we distinguish two
cases. If the task can be accomplished by outputting text
only as, e.g., in embodied question answering or scene
description tasks, then the output of the model is directly
considered to be the solution for the task.
Alternatively, if PaLM-E is used to solve an embodied plan-
ning or control task, it generates text that conditions low-
level commands. In particular, we assume to have access to
policies that can perform low-level skills from some (small)
vocabulary, and a successful plan from PaLM-E must con-
sist of a sequence of such skills. Note that PaLM-E must
determine on its own which skills are available based on
the training data and the prompt, and no other mechanism
is used to constrain or ﬁlter its outputs. Although these
policies are language conditioned, they are not capable of
solving long-horizon tasks or taking in complex instructions.
PaLM-E is hence integrated into a control-loop, where its
predicted decisions are executed through the low-level poli-
cies by a robot, leading to new observations based on which
PaLM-E is able to replan if necessary. In this sense, PaLM-
E can be understood as a high-level policy that sequences
and controls the low-level policies.

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
4. Input & Scene Representations for
Different Sensor Modalities
In this section, we describe the individual modalities that we
incorporate into PaLM-E, and how we set up their encoders.
We propose different architectural choices for each encoder
φ : O →X to map the corresponding modality into the
language embedding space. We investigate state estimation
vectors, Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al.,
2020; Chen et al., 2022; Ryoo et al., 2021) for 2D image
features, and the 3D-aware Object Scene Representation
Transformer (OSRT) (Sajjadi et al., 2022a). In addition to
encoders that represent the input scene globally, we consider
object-centric representations that factor observations into
tokens that represent individual objects in the scene.
State estimation vectors. State vectors, e.g. from a robot
or a state estimate for objects, are perhaps the simplest to
input into PaLM-E. Let s ∈RS be a vector describing the
state of the objects in a scene. For example, s could contain
the pose, size, color etc. of those objects. Then, the MLP
φstate maps s into the language embedding space.
Vision Transformer (ViT). ViT ˜φViT (Dosovitskiy et al.,
2020) is a transformer architecture mapping an image I
into a number of token embeddings ˜x1:m = ˜φViT(I) ∈
Rm×˜k. We consider several variants, including the 4 billion
parameter model from Chen et al. (2022), which we refer to
as ViT-4B, and a similar 22 billion parameter model, ViT-
22B (Dehghani et al., 2023), both of which have been pre-
trained on image classiﬁcation. We further investigate the
ViT token learner architecture (ViT + TL) (Ryoo et al., 2021)
which is trained end-to-end from scratch. Note that the
dimensionality ˜k of the ViT embeddings is not necessarily
the same as that of the language model. We therefore project
each embedding into xi = φViT(I)i = ψ(˜φViT(I)i) with ψ
being a learned afﬁne transformation.
Object-centric representations. Unlike language, visual
input is not pre-structured into meaningful entities and rela-
tionships: while ViT may capture semantics, the structure of
the representation resembles a static grid rather than a col-
lection of object instances. This poses a challenge both for
interfacing with LLMs which have been pre-trained on sym-
bols, and for solving embodied reasoning which requires
interaction with physical objects. We therefore also explore
structured encoders that aim to separate visual inputs into
distinct objects before injecting them into the LLM. Given
ground-truth object instance masks Mj, we can decompose
ViT’s representation into xj
1:m = φViT(Mj ◦I) for object j.
Object Scene Representation Transformer (OSRT). An
alternative that does not require ground-truth segmentations
is OSRT (Sajjadi et al., 2022a): rather than relying on ex-
ternal knowledge about objects, they are discovered in an
unsupervised way through inductive biases in the archi-
tecture (Locatello et al., 2020). Based on SRT (Sajjadi
et al., 2022b), OSRT learns 3D-centric neural scene rep-
resentations on in-domain data through a novel view syn-
thesis task. Its scene representations consist of object slots
oj = ¯φOSRT(I1:v)j ∈R¯k. We project each of these slots
into xj
1:m = ψ(¯φOSRT(I1:v)j) with an MLP ψ. Note that
individual objects are always tokenized into multiple em-
beddings each, i.e. ψ : R¯k →Rm×k for OSRT maps into
m-many embeddings.
Entity referrals. For embodied planning tasks, PaLM-E
must be able to reference objects in its generated plan. In
many cases, including the majority of our experiments,
objects in a scene can be identiﬁed in natural language
by some of their unique properties.
However, there
also exist settings where objects are not easily identiﬁ-
able by language in few words, e.g. if there are multi-
ple blocks on a table of the same color at different loca-
tions. For object-centric representations such as OSRT, we
label the multi-modal tokens corresponding to an object
in the input prompt as follows: Object 1 is <obj 1>.
. . . Object j is <obj j>. This enables PaLM-E to ref-
erence objects via special tokens of the form obj j in its
generated output sentences. In this case, we assume that the
low-level policies operate on these tokens as well.

PaLM-E is trained on a dataset of the form D
=
 Ii
1:ui, wi
1:Li, ni
	N
i=1, where each example i consists of
ui-many continuous observations Ii
j, a text wi
1:Li, and an
index ni. Despite being a decoder-only model, the text
consists of a preﬁx part up to index ni that is formed from
multi-modal sentences, and the prediction target, which only
contains text tokens. The loss function is therefore a cross-
entropy loss averaged over the individual non-preﬁx tokens
wi
ni+1:Li. To form the multi-modal sentences within the
model, we have special tokens in the text that get replaced
by the embedding vectors of the encoders at the locations
in the text of those tokens. We base PaLM-E on the pre-
trained 8B, 62B, and 540B parameter variants of PaLM as
the decoder-only LLM into which we inject the continuous
observations through the input encoders. Those encoders
are either pre-trained or trained from scratch, see Sec. 4. We
refer to an 8B LLM combined with a 4B ViT as PaLM-E-
12B, similarly a 62B LLM + 22B ViT as PaLM-E-84B, and
540B LLM + 22B ViT as PaLM-E-562B.
Variation with Model freezing. Most of our architectures
consist of three parts, an encoder ˜φ, a projector ψ, and the
LLM pLM. When training PaLM-E, one way is to update
the parameters of all these components. However, LLMs
show impressive reasoning capabilities if supplied with a
suitable prompt (Wei et al., 2022). Therefore, we investigate
whether it is possible to freeze the LLM and to just train the

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
input encoders, and if so, how different-modality encoders
compare. In this case, the encoder has to produce embed-
ding vectors such that the frozen LLM is grounded on the
observations, and also propagate information to the LLM
about the capabilities of an embodiment. Training such en-
codings can be understood as a form of input-conditioned
soft-prompting (Tsimpoukelli et al., 2021), in relation to nor-
mal soft prompts (Lester et al., 2021). In experiments with
φOSRT, we also freeze the slot representation, i.e. we only
update the small projector ψ which serves as the interface
between OSRT and the LLM.
Co-training across tasks. In our experiments, we investi-
gate the effects of co-training our models on a variety of
diverse data. The “full mixture”, see App. A, consists pri-
marily of a diverse set of internet-scale vision-and-language
data, from a variety of tasks. The sampling frequencies are
set such that only 8.9% of the full mixture is embodied data,
and there are several tasks for each embodiment.
6. Experiments
Our experiments consider diverse robotic (mobile) manip-
ulation tasks across three different robot embodiments, in
simulation and with two different real robots. We refer to
https://palm-e.github.io for videos showing the
capabilities of PaLM-E on those tasks. Although not the
focus of our work, we evaluate PaLM-E also on general
vision-language tasks such as visual-question-answering
(VQA), image captioning, and established language model-
ing tasks.
We split our experimental investigation into two broad cate-
gories. First, we compare the different input representations
from Sec. 4 with respect to performance, generalization, and
data-efﬁciency. The second thread of experiments focuses
on one architecture, the main PaLM-E version, consisting
of a pre-trained ViT and PaLM language model that takes
in raw images as the continuous inputs. Here we show
that a single model, trained on a mixture of many datasets,
across diverse tasks, and across robot embodiments, can
simultaneously achieve high performance on all of those
tasks. Crucially, we investigate whether co-training on these
datasets enables transfer (Fig. 3): despite different tasks
and embodiments, the performance on the individual tasks
increases by training on the mixture of tasks. We study
the inﬂuence on performance, generalization, and data ef-
ﬁciency with respect to co-training strategies and model
parameter size. Finally, we consider if freezing the LLM
and just training the ViT that injects vision into the LLM is
a viable path.
As baselines, we consider the state-of-the art visual language
model PaLI (Chen et al., 2022), which has not been trained
on embodiment robot data, as well as the SayCan algorithm
(Ahn et al., 2022), supplied with oracle affordances.

Figure 3: Overview of transfer learning demonstrated by PaLM-
E: across three different robotics domains, using PaLM and ViT
pretraining together with the full mixture of robotics and general
visual-language data provides a signiﬁcant performance increase
compared to only training on the respective in-domain data. See
Tab. 1, Fig. 4, Tab. 2, Tab. 4 for additional data in each domain.
6.1. Robot Environments / Tasks
Our three robot environments (Fig. 1) include a Task and
Motion Planning (TAMP) domain where a robot has to
manipulate (grasp and stack) objects, a table-top pushing
environment, and a mobile manipulation domain. In each
domain, PaLM-E is trained on expert data from that do-
main. In many cases, this is a sparse amount of data per task.
The TAMP tasks involve large combinatorics over possible
plans, and many decision sequences are infeasible. PaLM-E
has to generate plans that consist of multiple steps, with
complicated decision boundaries. The multi-object tabletop
pushing environment is taken from the publicly available
Language-Table dataset (Lynch et al., 2022) and is chal-
lenging since it includes several objects, large cardinality
of language, and complex pushing dynamics. For both the
TAMP and Language-Table environment, PaLM-E has to
reason about the poses of the objects. It is not sufﬁcient to
know which objects are on the table or knowing their rough
relationships, the more ﬁne-grained details about the scene
geometry are important for solving the tasks. Finally, we
consider a mobile manipulation domain similar to SayCan
(Ahn et al., 2022), where a robot has to solve a variety of
tasks in a kitchen environment, including ﬁnding objects
in drawers, picking them, and bringing them to a human.
For all domains we consider both planning and VQA tasks
in those environments. For the mobile manipulation and
Language-Table environments, PaLM-E is integrated into
the control loop to execute the plans in the real world, and
has to adjust the plan in presence of external disturbances
or failures of the low-level control policies.
6.2. TAMP Environment
Tab. 7 (appendix) shows planning success rates and VQA
performance for the TAMP environment. The LLM is frozen
in these experiments (for pre-trained LLM). For the results

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
reported in Tab. 7, the input representations are trained
on a dataset containing 96,000 training scenes of solely
the TAMP environment, i.e. no other data is part of the
mixture. For 3-5 objects in the scene, which is the same
number as in the training set, most input representations
perform similarly well. However, when increasing the num-
ber of objects, it turns out that using a pre-trained LLM
improves performance considerably, especially with entity
referrals. Furthermore, we show that a 62B LLM shows
better out-of-distribution generalization compared to the 8B
variant, while a non-pretrained LLM shows basically no out-
of-distribution generalization. The SayCan baseline (Ahn
et al., 2022) utilizes oracle affordance functions and has
difﬁculties solving this environment, since affordance func-
tions only constrain what is possible right now, but are not
informative enough for the LLM to construct long-horizon
plans in TAMP environments.
Tab. 1 shows results for 3-5 objects when training on 1%
of the dataset, which corresponds to only 320 examples for
each of the two planning tasks. Here we see that there are
signiﬁcant differences between the input representations, es-
pecially for the planning tasks. First, pre-training the LLM
is beneﬁcial in the low data regime for state inputs. Second,
both ViT variants (ViT+TL, ViT-4B) do not perform well
in solving the planning tasks for this little data. However,
if we co-train on all other robot environments as well as
general vision-language datasets (ViT-4B generalist), then
the performance of the ViT-4B more than doubles. This
shows a signiﬁcant transfer effect between different robot
embodiments and tasks. Finally, using OSRT as the input
representation leads to the best performance here, demon-
strating the strengths of 3D-aware object representations.
We also observe another instance of transfer here: when
we remove the TAMP VQA data and only train on the 640
planning tasks examples, there is a (slight) drop in perfor-
mance. The state-of-the art vision-language model PaLI
(Chen et al., 2022) that was not trained on robot data is
not able to solve the tasks. We only evaluated it on q2 (ob-
jects left/right/center on the table) and q3 (vertical object
relations), since those most resemble typical VQA tasks.
6.3. Language-Table Environment
Tab. 2 reports success rates on long-horizon tasks from the
Language-Table environment (Lynch et al., 2022). PaLM-E
is integrated into a control loop that takes as input the long-
horizon task and the current image, and outputs an instruc-
tion for the low-level policy. We see that joint training on
internet-scale vision and language results in a more effec-
tive model for robot planning, particularly in the few-shot
regime with only 10 demos per task. Scaling the 12B model
to the 84B model leads to improvements on 2 of 3 tasks. As
with the TAMP environment, neither SayCan nor zero-shot
PaLI are effective, unable to solve the easiest task tested.

Real Robot Results and Few-Shot Generalization. In
Fig. 7, a), we see PaLM-E is capable of guiding a real robot
through a multi-stage tabletop manipulation task, while
remaining robust to adversarial disturbances. Given the ob-
served image and a long-horizon goal, e.g. “sort the blocks
by colors into corners”, PaLM-E outputs language subgoals
at 1 Hz to the policies from Lynch et al. (2022), that output
low-level robot actions at 5 Hz. Prior work (Lynch et al.,
2022) instead involved a human in the loop to interactively
guide subgoals and corrections. In Fig. 5, b) we see PaLM-
E is capable of one-shot and zero-shot learning. Here, we
ﬁnetuned PaLM-E on 100 different long horizon tasks with
a single training example each, e.g. “put all the blocks in
the center”, “remove the blue blocks from the line”. We
additionally see that PaLM-E can generalize zero-shot to
tasks involving novel object pairs (Fig. 7, c) and to tasks in-
volving objects that were unseen in either the original robot
dataset or the ﬁnetuning datasets, e.g. a toy turtle (Fig. 5, d).
6.4. Mobile Manipulation Environment
We demonstrate the performance of PaLM-E on challenging
and diverse mobile manipulation tasks. We largely follow
the setup in Ahn et al. (2022), where the robot needs to plan
a sequence of navigation and manipulation actions based on
an instruction by a human. For example, given the instruc-
tion “I spilled my drink, can you bring me something to
clean it up?”, the robot needs to plan a sequence containing
“1. Find a sponge, 2. Pick up the sponge, 3. Bring it to
the user, 4. Put down the sponge.” Inspired by these tasks,
we develop 3 use cases to test the embodied reasoning abil-
ities of PaLM-E: affordance prediction, failure detection,
and long-horizon planning. The low-level policies are from
RT-1 (Brohan et al., 2022), a transformer model that takes
RGB image and natural language instruction, and outputs
end-effector control commands.

Table 1: Comparison of different input representations on TAMP
environment (in terms of success rates), where data from TAMP
constitutes only 1% (i.e., 320 samples for p1, p2 each) of total
training data size. PaLM-E outperforms both PaLI and SayCan
on embodied VQA and planning tasks. Cross-domain transfer
is observed, since the PaLM-E with ViT-4B trained on our full
data mixture improves planning performance. OSRT, despite using
no large-scale data, provides the most effective input encodings
for learning. (GT) means ground-truth object-centric information
provided. In all experiments, the LLM is frozen. The non-object
centric ViT-4B variant utilizes color to reference objects, hence q1
cannot be evaluated here. The LLM is frozen in these experiments
(except for the case where it is not pre-trained). Sec. B.1 describes
the tasks q1-q4, p1, q2.
Affordance prediction. We investigate PaLM-E’s perfor-
mance at affordance prediction, i.e. whether a skill of the
low-level policy can be executed in the current environment.
This can be formulated as the VQA problem Given <img>.
Q: Is it possible to <skill> here?.
PaLM-E
outperforms PaLI (zero-shot), as well as thresholding on
value functions trained with QT-OPT (Tab. 4).
Failure detection. For a robot to do closed-loop planning,
it is also important to detect failures, as is shown in (Huang
et al., 2022c). The multi-modal prompt is Given <img>.
Q: Was <skill> successful?.
Tab. 4 shows that
PaLM-E outperforms PaLI (zero-shot), as well as a ﬁne-
tuned version of CLIP on this dataset. PaLM-E also out-
performs the algorithm proposed in Xiao et al. (2022) that
leverages two CLIP models trained with hindsight relabeled
data. This method has access to more information than our
method, and was speciﬁcally designed to just solve failure
detection on this dataset.
Real robot results: Long-horizon planning. Finally, we
use PaLM-E to perform embodied planning end-to-end
for mobile manipulation tasks. The prompt structure for
this task is Human:
<instruction> Robot:
<step
history>.
I see <img>. PaLM-E is trained to gener-
ate the next step of the plan, conditioned on the history of
taken steps and the current image observation of the scene.
After each step is decoded, we map them to a low-level
policy as deﬁned in Ahn et al. (2022). This process is done
in an autoregressive manner, until PaLM-E outputs “termi-
nate”. We train the model by using the runs from (Ahn et al.,
2022), which contains 2912 sequences. We qualitatively
evaluated the model in a real kitchen and found the model
can carry out long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks, even
under adversarial disturbances (Fig. 5).
6.5. Performance on General Visual-Language Tasks
Although it is not the focus of our work, we report in Tab. 5
results on general vision-language tasks, including OK-
VQA (Marino et al., 2019), VQA v2 (Goyal et al., 2017) and
COCO captioning (Chen et al., 2015). A single, generalist

PaLM-E-562B model achieves the highest reported number
on OK-VQA, including outperforming models ﬁnetuned
speciﬁcally on OK-VQA. Compared to (Tsimpoukelli et al.,
2021), PaLM-E achieves the highest performance on VQA
v2 with a frozen LLM to the best of our knowledge. This
establishes that PaLM-E is a competitive visual-language
generalist, in addition to being an embodied reasoner on
robotic tasks.
6.6. Performance on General Language Tasks
Tab. 8 reports the averaged performance of PaLM-E on 21
general language benchmarks for Natural Language Under-
standing (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG)
tasks. The notable trend is that with increasing model scale,
there is considerably less catastrophic forgetting of language
capabilities. As seen in Fig. 6, while for the smallest (PaLM-

7. Summary of Experiments & Discussion
Generalist vs specialist models – transfer. As summa-
rized in Fig. 3, we have shown several instances of transfer
in this work, meaning that PaLM-E trained on different
tasks and datasets at the same time leads to signiﬁcantly
increased performance relative to models trained separately
on the different tasks alone. In Fig. 4, co-training on the
“full mixture” achieves more than double the performance.
In Tab. 9, we see signiﬁcant improvements in performance if
we add LLM/ViT pre-training, and training on the full mix-
ture instead of the mobile manipulation data alone. For the
Language-Table experiment in Tab. 2, we observe analogous
behaviour.
Data efﬁciency. Compared to available massive language
or vision-language datasets, robotics data is signiﬁcantly
less abundant. As discussed in the last paragraph, our model
exhibits transfer, which aids PaLM-E to solve robotics tasks
from very few training examples in the robotics domain, e.g.
between 10 and 80 for Language Table or 320 for TAMP.
The OSRT results show another instance of data-efﬁciency
by using a geometric input representation. A promising

PaLM-E: An Embodied Multimodal Language Model
opportunity for future work is to combine this with a method
beneﬁtting from large-scale visual data.
Retaining language capabilities.
We have shown two
paths to retain the language capabilities of the model during
multimodal training. As one option, freezing the LLM and
only training the input encoders is a viable path for building
embodied language models, although this approach occa-
sionally struggled for robotics tasks (Tab. 2). As an alter-
native route, when the whole model is trained end-to-end,
the model retains signiﬁcantly more of its original language
performance with increasing model scale (Fig. 6).
8. Conclusion
We proposed to build an embodied language model by in-
jecting multi-modal information such as images into the em-
bedding space of a pre-trained LLM. Experiments showed
that off-the-shelf state-of-the-art vision-language models
trained on general VQA and captioning tasks are not sufﬁ-
cient for embodied reasoning tasks, as well as limitations of
a recent proposal for grounding language models through
affordances. To overcome these limitations, we proposed
PaLM-E, a single model that is able to control different
robots in simulation and in the real world, while at the same
time being quantitatively competent at general VQA and
captioning tasks. In particular the novel architectural idea of
ingesting neural scene representations (i.e., OSRT) into the
model is particularly effective, even without large-scale data.
PaLM-E is trained on a mixture of diverse tasks across mul-
tiple robot embodiments as well as general vision-language
tasks. Importantly, we have demonstrated that this diverse
training leads to several avenues of transfer from the vision-
language domains into embodied decision making, enabling
robot planning tasks to be achieved data efﬁciently. While
our results indicate that frozen language models are a viable
path towards general-purpose embodied multimodal models
that fully retain their language capabilities, we have also
surfaced an alternative route with unfrozen models: scaling
up the language model size leads to signiﬁcantly less catas-
trophic forgetting while becoming an embodied agent. Our
largest model, PaLM-E-562B, showcases emergent capabil-
ities like multimodal chain of thought reasoning, and the
ability to reason over multiple images, despite being trained
on only single-image prompts.

PaLM-E
Figure 7: PaLM-E interactively guides a real robot through long-horizon manipulation tasks on Language-Table, while remaining robust
to adversarial disturbances. We ﬁnd evidence that PaLM-E is capable of one-shot and zero shot generalization.
A. Data Mixture
Tab. 6 shows the dataset and sampling frequency for the “full mixture” as referred to in the experiments. The majority of the
data distribution is general vision-language tasks, with less than 10% robot data.
B. Environment Details
B.1. Task and Motion Planning (TAMP)
The training scenes for the TAMP environment contain 3-5 cube-shaped objects of different sizes, colors and sampled initial
poses. Fig. 8 show an example test scene that contains 6 objects.
In the global version, we consider the following three VQA tasks:

Q: How to grasp the green object?.
Tar-
get:
A: First grasp the orange object and place it on the table, then grasp the
green object.
• p2:

Example prompt:
Given <img>.
Q: How to stack the white object on top
of the red object?.
Target:
A: First grasp the green object and place it on the
table, then grasp the white object and place it on the red object.
For the object-centric version with entity referrals, all prompts contain the preﬁx <prefix> = Obj 1 is <obj1>. . . .
Obj j is <objj>., and the VQA task q1 is about the color of an object. The other tasks (except with the different
preﬁx, and entity referrals), remain the same.
We utilize the planner from Driess et al. (2020) to generate the dataset for the planning tasks. The low-level policies are also
obtained with the method of Driess et al. (2020).

Table 7: Success rates on TAMP environment for different input representations. 3-5 objects in the scene correspond to the training
distribution. OOD tasks means out-of-distribution tasks where the objects are referenced by color, although in the trainig data they have
been referenced by their special tokens objj in the object-centric case. The SayCan baseline (Ahn et al., 2022) utilizes oracle, one-step
affordance functions.
B.2. Interactive Language Table
We use the Language-Table real-world tabletop setup and simulated environment from Interactive Language (Lynch et al.,
2022).
Data collection. For each task, given the long horizon instruction, we prompt a labeler to enter a short horizon command
every 4 seconds. We pass the short horizon instructions to an Interactive Language policy trained using the same procedure
as in Lynch et al. (2022). The policy executes 40 steps (10Hz for 4 seconds) before requiring another command from the
labeler. This is repeated until the labeler determines the long horizon instruction is complete and issues a ’done’ instruction.
The data collection procedure for the real world experiments are the same as in simulation.
Train and Evaluation. To train the ﬁnetuned versions of these models, we train a pretrained PaLM-E model for 9,000
additional steps, in order to support a data complexity sweep without training several separate models from scratch on
slightly different versions of the full mixture. For Tasks 2 and 3 in simulation, we implement an automated reward to
measure the success rate, and we evaluate PaLM-E by running 80 rollouts for each task. Given the current image and high
level task, PaLM-E issues a text instruction which a trained low-level policy executes for 4 seconds before PaLM-E issues a
new text instruction. For Task 1, we use a test-set and report validation accuracy. This is because the task only requires one
step to solve, despite being a complicated visual and linguistic processing task and cannot be solved by the low-level policy
from the prompt alone.
