Abstract
Inﬂationary spacetimes have been argued to be past geodesically incomplete in many sit-
uations. However, whether the geodesic incompleteness implies the existence of an initial
spacetime curvature singularity or whether the spacetime may be extended (potentially
into another phase of the universe) is generally unknown. Both questions have important
physical implications. In this paper, we take a closer look at the geometrical structure of
inﬂationary spacetimes and investigate these very questions. We ﬁrst classify which past
inﬂationary histories have a scalar curvature singularity and which might be extendible
and/or non-singular in homogeneous and isotropic cosmology with ﬂat spatial sections.
Then, we derive rigorous extendibility criteria of various regularity classes for quasi-de Sit-
ter spacetimes that evolve from inﬁnite proper time in the past. Finally, we show that
beyond homogeneity and isotropy, special continuous extensions respecting the Einstein
ﬁeld equations with a perfect ﬂuid must have the equation of state of a de Sitter universe
asymptotically. An interpretation of our results is that past-eternal inﬂationary scenarios
are most likely physically singular, except in situations with very special initial conditions.

Introduction
Inﬂation is a theory of the primordial universe, which can nicely solve the problems of
standard big bang cosmology (monopole problem, horizon problem, ﬂatness problem) and
provide a framework for generating the seeds of large-scale structures (see, e.g., [1–6]).
There are many inﬂationary models that can be in agreement with observations (nearly
scale-invariant curvature power spectrum with slight red tilt, small tensor-to-scalar ratio,
small non-Gaussianities, etc.; see, e.g., [7–9]). However, inﬂation is not a theory ‘of the big
bang,’ i.e., it does not necessarily tell us anything about the very beginning of the universe
(if there was one).
In fact, it is known that if certain energy conditions are respected (together with ad-
ditional assumptions), then the universe is past geodesically incomplete [10–13] (theorems
more speciﬁc to inﬂation are also found in [14–18]). Moreover, it has been shown that a
universe that has always been expanding (in an appropriately deﬁned average sense) is simi-
larly past geodesically incomplete [19], thus demonstrating that any past-eternal expanding
cosmology including past-eternal inﬂation is also past geodesically incomplete regardless of
energy conditions. Yet, geodesic incompleteness does not tell us anything about the na-
ture of the spacetime singularities (in particular, it does not always imply the presence of
curvature singularities), a well-known drawback of any geodesic incompleteness theorems
(nevertheless usually called ‘singularity theorems’; see, e.g., [20] for a review and a dis-
cussion). In the context of an accelerating homogeneous and isotropic universe, de Sitter
(dS) spacetime is a prototypical example: the ﬂat Friedmann-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) patch (also known as the planar coordinates [21] of dS) only covers half of the
whole (global) dS spacetime. As such, null geodesics appear past incomplete within the ﬂat
FLRW patch, yet the whole maximal spacetime is non-singular. This known fact, reviewed
later in this paper and elsewhere, can be the basis for constructing past-eternal geodesically
complete inﬂationary scenarios (e.g., [22–24]; see [25,26] for related aspects).
There are very few concrete generic results regarding the actual presence and strength
of a singularity to the past of inﬂation. It is generally unknown whether the past geodesic
incompleteness of inﬂation always translates into a ‘big bang-like’ initial singularity or
whether the spacetime is actually extendible beyond its past boundary. A ﬁrst step in this
direction was given by [27] (further developed and applied in [28–32]), where the nature of
the singularity in quasi-de Sitter spacetimes was explored. Building on mathematical results
relating spacetime extendibility to parallelly propagated curvature singularities [33–37], it
was shown in [27,29] that the universe had to approach dS suﬃciently quickly in order to
avoid parallelly propagated curvature singularities.
The goal of this paper is to examine the geometrical structure of inﬂationary spacetimes
and determine when singularities are present prior to inﬂation versus when an inﬂationary
spacetime is potentially non-singular and extendible.
In particular, we will investigate
suﬃcient conditions for determining metric extendibility. Along the way, we will expand
on the results obtained in [27,29] as well as put them on more rigorous grounds. A related
important mathematical question is to pinpoint when spacetimes are inextendible with a
continuous metric, i.e., C0 inextendible. However, this is a notoriously diﬃcult question to
answer and only partial results are known (see [38–44]). In the cosmological setting, it is
known that FLRW spacetimes with ﬁnite particle horizons are C0,1 inextendible [42]. Also,
1

some C0-inextendibility results can be achieved within the class of spherically symmetric
spacetimes [38].
For a study of pre-big bang geometric extensions that still contain a
singularity, see [45].
As it will be physically and mathematically justiﬁed in Section 2, the framework of
the current paper is set within situations that are close enough to the ﬂat patch of dS.
Speciﬁcally, we will mostly explore spacetimes that are ﬂat past-asymptotically dS and
derive conditions on their extendibility. There will be many parallels with the works of [38,
46–49] on the topic of metric extendibility of Milne-like spacetimes, which are homogeneous
and isotropic universes with negative (as opposed to zero here) constant spatial curvature.
The structure of the paper is as follows: in Section 2, we further introduce and moti-
vate the questions of interest in this study. Speciﬁcally, we classify what are the possible
past histories of inﬂationary cosmology within a ﬂat FLRW spacetime. We deﬁne various
classes of inﬂation and show which ones inevitably have an initial scalar curvature sin-
gularity and which ones might not. Cosmologies that are inﬂating from the inﬁnite past
(past eternal) ﬁt in the latter class and motivate us to seek speciﬁc conditions permitting
spacetime extendibility. We deﬁne a generic subclass of such spacetimes, dubbed ‘ﬂat past-
asymptotically de Sitter’. Section 3 is devoted to showing suﬃcient conditions for metric
extendibility beyond the past boundary of past-eternal inﬂationary spacetimes. To do so,
we introduce a new set of coordinates that allows us to explicitly write down a spacetime
extension. We derive asymptotic criteria on the scale factor and/or the Hubble parameter
(and derivatives thereof when needed) that yield continuous (C0), continuously diﬀeren-
tiable (C1), twice-continuously diﬀerentiable (C2), etc. (up to smooth; C∞) extendibility.
We also comment on the notion of scalar curvature singularities versus parallelly propagated
singularities in those spacetimes. In Section 4, we present an alternative set of coordinates
in which past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes are continuously extendible. This is done
by showing that such spacetimes can be conformally embedded into the Einstein static uni-
verse, just like exact dS. This also serves for the result of Section 5: assuming the Einstein
equations with a perfect ﬂuid, we can prove that, under certain extendibility assumptions
that do not require homogeneity and isotropy, the initial equation of state of matter must
be that of a positive cosmological constant. (Recall dS solves the Einstein equations with a
positive cosmological constant.) After presenting some applications to inﬂationary cosmol-
ogy, we summarize and discuss our results in Section 6, especially with regard to physical
applications, implications, and interpretations.

Classiﬁcation of the past of inﬂation
2.1
Preliminaries
The ﬁrst sections of this work deal with homogeneous and isotropic (FLRW) universes with
ﬂat spatial sections. The 3 + 1-dimensional manifold is M = I × R3, where I ⊆R is an
open interval (of time). The metric g may be written in various ways, e.g.,
g = −dt2 + a(t)2hE = −dt2 + a(t)2  dr2 + r2dΩ2
,
(2.1)
where hE := dx2+dy2+dz2 is the usual 3-dimensional Euclidean metric, where the Cartesian
coordinates (x, y, z) are related to the spherical coordinates (r, θ, φ) in the usual way. In the
2

above, dΩ2 = dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2 is the round metric on S2. The scale factor a(t) : I →R>0
is a smooth, positive, dimensionless function of the physical time t, and it describes the
evolution of the size of spatial sections.1 The Hubble parameter H(t) : I →R, deﬁned
by H(t) := ˙a(t)/a(t) with a dot denoting a derivative with respect to t, characterizes the
expansion or contraction rate of the spatial sections.
Throughout Section 2, we denote the inﬁmum of I by tini, which thus corresponds to
the ‘initial time’ of comoving observers in this coordinate system. Either tini > −∞or
tini = −∞. In the former case, we will assume that a(t) ↘0 as t →t+
ini, i.e., we assume
tini > −∞
=⇒
lim
t→t+
ini
a(t) = 0+ ,
(2.2)
since otherwise one could easily extend the spacetime continuously to times t < tini and we
wish to ignore such situations. In the latter case (tini = −∞), many things can occur, e.g.,
a(t) could go to 0 in the inﬁnite past, it could go to inﬁnity (the universe started inﬁnitely
large in the asymptotic past as in bouncing scenarios), or it could go to a constant (the
universe started close to Minkowski space in the asymptotic past as in loitering scenarios).
Bouncing and loitering scenarios are the subject of vast literature, which we do not review
here (for some examples and reviews, see, e.g., [50–54]). For the rest of this paper (from
Section 3 onwards), we will be mostly concerned with the situation where a(t) ↘0 as
t →−∞.
2.2
Inﬂationary classiﬁcation
One can deﬁne inﬂation in many ways, but for the purpose of this work, we deﬁne it to be
a period of time during which the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate. Therefore,
we say that, for some interval Iinf ⊂I,
˙a(t) > 0
and
¨a(t) > 0
(2.3)
for all t ∈Iinf. Then, we can classify (the past of) inﬂationary scenarios into two general
cases, each containing various subcases:
1. Inﬂation started at some ﬁnite time in the past when the universe had a ﬁnite size.
Therefore, the universe had already undergone some evolution prior to inﬂation (we
say that there was a pre-inﬂationary phase). This corresponds to saying that there
are starting and ending times, say t1, t2 ∈R respectively, during which the universe
is inﬂating, so Iinf = [t1, t2]. Note that the universe had a ﬁnite size at the initial
inﬂationary time (i.e., 0 < a(t1) < ∞) and ﬁnite expansion rate (i.e., 0 < H(t1) < ∞).
Prior to inﬂation, two general situations could occur, so we deﬁne two subcases:
(a) The universe was always decelerating prior to inﬂation, i.e., ¨a(t) ≤0 for all
t ∈Ipre-inf := (tini, t1). As we will prove shortly, this situation implies that
lim
t→t+
ini
a(t) = 0+ ,
at which point scalar curvature invariants diverge, hence there is an initial scalar
curvature singularity. A depiction is given in Figure 1.
1The convention in cosmology is to set the present-time value of the scale factor to a0 = 1. Its value at
other times relates to the physical redshift z of electromagnetic waves through the relation 1/a(t) = 1 + z.

Figure 1: Sketch of an example of scale factor evolution in Classiﬁcation 1a. The universe is inﬂating
(˙a(t) > 0 and ¨a(t) > 0) for the interval [t1, t2], but it is decelerating in a pre-inﬂationary phase from
tini to t1. A singularity is reached at tini.
(b) Alternatively, the universe was not always decelerating prior to inﬂation. In such
a situation, many things can happen, for instance:
i. there could still be an initial singularity to the past; or
ii. A. the universe could slowly approach a loitering phase with constant scale
factor (i.e., it is past-asymptotically Minkowski), in which case it may
be non-singular and geodesically complete (a depiction is given in the
left panel of Figure 2);
B. or the universe could undergo a non-singular bounce, before which the
universe started large and was contracting. A depiction is given in the
right panel of Figure 2.
Figure 2: Left: Sketch of an example of scale factor evolution in Classiﬁcation 1(b)iiA, where
the universe is inﬂating from t1 to t2, but before that, a(t) both decelerates and accelerates. In
particular, the universe approaches a ‘loitering phase’ in the past, i.e., the scale factor goes to a
positive constant as time approaches −∞. Right: Sketch of an example of scale factor evolution
in Classiﬁcation 1(b)iiB, where the universe is again inﬂating from t1 to t2 and both accelerating
and decelerating before that. In particular, the universe undergoes a non-singular bounce, i.e., a
transition from contraction to expansion about a non-zero minimum for a(t). If the scale factor
grows to inﬁnity in the past or reaches a constant, the initial time tini is pushed to −∞.
These latter situations (loitering and bouncing) often have to invoke some mod-
iﬁcations to general relativity, matter violating the standard energy conditions
4

(the null energy condition in particular), or quantum gravity. While we do not
review them here, it is nevertheless important to stress that there are possible
non-singular, geodesically complete pre-inﬂationary scenarios.
2. The second possibility is that inﬂation happened all the way ‘to the beginning’, at
which point a(t) approaches 0. Here, the ‘beginning’ might be at ﬁnite time or at
inﬁnite time in the past, so we distinguish additional subcases:
(a) Iinf = (tini, t2], tini > −∞, and
lim
t→t+
ini
a(t) = 0+ .
A depiction is given in the left panel of Figure 3.
(b) Alternatively, Iinf = (−∞, t2] and
lim
t→−∞a(t) = 0+ .
A depiction is given in the right panel of Figure 3.
Figure 3: Left: Example of scale factor evolution in Classiﬁcation 2a. The universe is inﬂating from
a ﬁnite initial time tini, which corresponds to a singularity. Right: Example of scale factor evolution
in Classiﬁcation 2b, where the universe is inﬂating all the way to tini = −∞.
We will shortly show that Case 2a implies that there is an initial scalar curvature
singularity at tini. Correspondingly, this will motivate us to consider Case 2b more
closely for the rest of this paper.
A diagrammatic summary of the diﬀerent cases is given in Figure 4.
Let us repeat the statement of Case 1a deﬁned above:
Theorem 2.1. Let ¨a(t) ≤0 for all t ∈Ipre-inf := (tini, t1), where t1 denotes the time at
which inﬂation would start (so the second time derivative of a(t) would change sign from
that point onward). Then, tini > −∞, hence a(t) ↘0 as t →t+
ini, and at least two scalar
curvature invariants diverge in the same limit. Correspondingly, the spacetime has an initial
scalar curvature singularity in the limit to tini.

Figure 4: Classiﬁcation of (the past of) inﬂationary cosmology within ﬂat FLRW described in
the text. Note that ‘∄pre-inﬂationary phase’ is meant to apply only within the spacetime (M, g).
Indeed, the spacetime might well be extendible beyond the boundary that lives at inﬁnite proper
time in Case 2b. This is the subject of the next sections.
Proof. By integration, ¨a(t) ≤0 implies ˙a(t) ≥˙a(t1) for all t ∈Ipre-inf, and the fact that
¨a(t) ≤0 also implies ˙a(t) is a decreasing function of t in the interval Ipre-inf. From our
deﬁnition of inﬂation in equation (2.3), we have ˙a(t1) > 0, so
˙a(t) ≥˙a(t1) > 0
(2.4)
for all t ∈Ipre-inf. Integrating this inequality, we have, always for all t ∈Ipre-inf,
Z t1
t
d˜t ˙a(˜t) ≥
Z t1
t
d˜t ˙a(t1) > 0 =⇒a(t1) −a(t) ≥˙a(t1)(t1 −t) > 0
=⇒a(t) ≤a(t1) −˙a(t1)(t1 −t) .
(2.5)
Let H1 := ˙a(t1)/a(t1), which is a ﬁnite and positive number — it is the Hubble expansion
rate at the beginning of inﬂation. Then we can deﬁne tout := t1 −H−1
1 , −∞< tout < t1,
which would suggest a(tout) ≤0 according to (2.5). However, from our deﬁnition of the
scale factor in 2.1, a(t) > 0 for all t ∈I. Since a(t) is considered to be smooth all the way
to inf I = tini, it must be that −∞< tout ≤tini < t1, and thus by the assumption (2.2),
lim
t→t+
ini>−∞
a(t) = 0+ .
(2.6)
Consequently, the pre-inﬂationary phase can only have a ﬁnite duration with Ipre-inf =
(tini, t1), and this is the ﬁrst phase of the universe since tini = inf I = inf Ipre-inf in that
case. Then from (2.4) and from the fact that ˙a(t) is a decreasing function of t, we can tell
that ˙a(t) reaches a positive limit (either ﬁnite or inﬁnite) as t →t+
ini. Therefore, recalling
H := ˙a/a, equation (2.6) implies
lim
t→t+
ini
H(t) = +∞.
(2.7)
6

At this point, it is important to recall a few linearly independent curvature invariants in a
ﬂat FLRW spacetime:
R = 6(2H2 + ˙H) ,
(2.8a)
RµνRµν = 3
 (3H2 + 2 ˙H)2 + 3H4
,
(2.8b)
RµνρσRµνρσ = 12
 (H2 + ˙H)2 + H4
,
(2.8c)
are the Ricci scalar, the contraction of the Ricci tensor with itself, and the contraction
of the Riemann tensor with itself (also known as the Kretschmann scalar), respectively.
We can ﬁnally make the observation that at least two of them will diverge as t →t+
ini
because of (2.7). Indeed, RµνRµν and the Kretschmann scalar are non-negative functions
of H2 and ˙H, so they will diverge when H diverges as t →t+
ini, regardless of what ˙H does.
Correspondingly, there is an initial scalar curvature singularity as t →t+
ini.
Remark. If one assumed general relativity and the strong energy condition, deceleration
(¨a(t) ≤0) would follow and thus the above theorem. Whenever the strong energy condition
is satisﬁed, it is not unsurprising for the spacetime to have an inevitable initial singularity.
The previous theorem, though, applies irrespectively of the gravitational ﬁeld equations at
play: only a geometric ‘convergence’ condition (deceleration) is assumed, albeit the theorem
is restricted to ﬂat FLRW spacetimes.
Let us then present results pertaining to the Case 2 deﬁned earlier:
Lemma 2.2. Suppose H(t) →HΛ ∈R≥0 as t →t+
ini, where we recall tini is the inﬁmum of
the domain of a(t). Then, tini = −∞.
Proof. The proof goes by contradiction: suppose tini > −∞. Then, by the assumption
(2.2), we have a(t) ↘0 as t →t+
ini. Then, by deﬁnition of limt→t+
ini H(t) = HΛ, there exists
a tL > tini such that, for all t ∈(tini, tL), 0 < |H(t) −HΛ| < ε for any ε ∈R>0. Upon
integrating from t to tL, we thus have, at any time t ∈(tini, tL),
−ε(tL −t) <
Z tL
t
d˜t (H(˜t) −HΛ) < ε(tL −t)
=⇒(ε −HΛ)(t −tL) < ln
 a(tL)

−ln
 a(t)

< (ε + HΛ)(tL −t)
=⇒a(tL)e(ε+HΛ)(t−tL) < a(t) < a(tL)e(HΛ−ε)(t−tL) .
(2.9)
Therefore, a(t) is bounded below by a decaying exponential of t as time decreases.
In
particular, since (2.9) applies for all t ∈(tini, tL) and for any ε > 0, we can take the limit of
(2.9) as t →t+
ini, where we recall tini > −∞, and we ﬁnd that limt→t+
ini a(t) is bounded below
by a positive number, a(tL)e(ε+HΛ)(tini−tL), in contradiction with limt→t+
ini a(t) = 0+.
Remarks. Since the previous proof holds for any ε > 0, in particular it must be true for a
small 0 < ε < HΛ whenever HΛ > 0. Thus, in such a situation, a(t) is actually bounded
in between two decaying exponentials of t as time decreases according to (2.9), and hence
a(t) itself decays to zero.
7

Another observation is that the contrapositive of the above lemma tells us that whenever
tini > −∞, H(t) cannot approach a non-negative constant as t →t+
ini. This will be useful
shortly.
Proposition 2.3. Suppose the universe reaches zero volume in ﬁnite time, i.e., a(t) ↘0
as t →t+
ini with inf I = tini > −∞, and suppose the universe is initially expanding in some
neighborhood of tini, i.e., ˙a(t) > 0 for all t ∈U := (tini, tini + δ) for some ﬁxed δ ∈R>0.
Then, H(t) is unbounded in the neighborhood U of tini.
Proof. The proof goes by contradiction: suppose H(t) is bounded in the neighborhood U
of tini.
This means that there exists Hmax ∈R>0 such that 0 < H(t) < Hmax for all
t ∈U. The lower bound comes from the fact that H(t) must be positive in U, because
a(t) is always positive and ˙a(t) is positive in U. Writing H := ˙a/a = d ln a/dt, we ﬁnd
0 < d ln a < Hmaxdt for all t ∈U, and so, integrating from an arbitrary t ∈U to tini + δ
yields
0 < ln
 a(tini + δ)

−ln
 a(t)

< Hmax(tini + δ −t) .
In particular, this must hold as t →t+
ini, in which case a(t) ↘0, but since a(tini + δ) > 0,
this would then imply 0 < +∞< Hmaxδ, hence the contradiction.
Theorem 2.4. If inﬂation happens all the way to the beginning of the universe, i.e., a(t) ↘
0 as t →t+
ini, where inf I = inf Iinf = tini ∈R ∪{−∞}, and ˙a(t) > 0 (so H(t) > 0) and
¨a(t) > 0 for all t ∈(tini, t2], then either
(i) tini = −∞and H(t) has a ﬁnite limit as t →−∞;
(ii) tini = −∞and H(t) does not have a ﬁnite limit as t →−∞;
(iii) tini > −∞and H(t) does not have a ﬁnite limit as t →t+
ini.
In case (iii), the spacetime has an initial scalar curvature singularity.
Proof. According to the contrapositive of Lemma 2.2, if tini > −∞, then H(t) ↛HΛ ∈R≥0.
By the hypothesis that H(t) > 0 for all t ∈(tini, t2], it must therefore be that H(t) does not
have a ﬁnite limit (i.e., it cannot converge) as t →t+
ini — this corresponds to case (iii) of the
theorem (or 2a in the classiﬁcation deﬁned earlier). The other alternative (Classiﬁcation
2b) is that tini = −∞, in which case either H(t) converges to a ﬁnite positive number [case
(i)] or it does not [case (ii)].
In case (iii), Proposition 2.3 tells us that H(t) is actually unbounded in a neighborhood
of tini. This means that either H(t) diverges to +∞or H(t) oscillates without bound as
t →t+
ini. In both cases, we can use the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 2.1 to say
that a scalar curvature singularity is reached as t →t+
ini (in particular, the Kretschmann
scalar diverges, i.e., it either goes to ∞or oscillates without bound).
Remark. Note that there is no analogous statement to Proposition 2.3 when tini = −∞. In
fact, it is straightforward to construct a counter-example: if a(t) = exp
 t + 1
2 sin t

, then
a ↘0 as t →−∞and ¨a(t) is everywhere positive, but while H(t) = 1 + 1
2 cos t does not
8

reach a limit as t →−∞, it is nevertheless bounded within 1/2 and 3/2. Therefore, case
(ii) of the above theorem does not necessarily imply a ‘blow up’ of H(t) and thus a scalar
curvature singularity.
Examples. The previous theorem tells us that if we are in the Classiﬁcation 2a of inﬂation,
then there is an initial big bang-like scalar curvature singularity at a ﬁnite time in the past.
A prototypical example would be a scale factor that is asymptotically a power-law,
a(t) t→0+
=
a0tq + . . . ,
q ∈R>1 , a0 ∈R>0 ,
for which R, RµνRµν, and RµνρσRµνρσ are all divergent as t →0+. Here, without loss of
generality, we set tini = 0. Another example is a function of the form a(t) ∝exp(−1/tα) for
α ∈R>0. Yet another would be a(t) ∝exp[A(ln t)γ] with A ∈R>0 and γ ∈{3, 5, 7, 9, . . .}.
The latter is a subclass of what is known as ‘logamediate’ inﬂation in the literature [55,56].
Let us end this subsection by commenting on the fact that we specialized the discussion
to ﬂat FLRW. This is crucial since many statements do not necessarily apply with either
positively or negatively curved spatial sections. It is known that inﬂation ‘dilutes’ spatial
curvature, hence assuming ﬂatness during and after inﬂation is well justiﬁed.
Prior to
inﬂation (or at the very onset of inﬂation), all three cases — ﬂat, closed, open — are
possible. We choose to focus on ﬂat spatial sections. The issue of extendibility in negatively
curved FLRW spacetimes has been studied quite extensively in [29,38,46–49]. With positive
spatial curvature, some investigations exist as well [29]; in this context, there are examples
of pre-inﬂationary non-singular bounces [57, 58], and the issue of setting up the quantum
initial conditions has been tackled in [59].
2.3
Past-asymptotically de Sitter
To summarize what we have shown so far, either inﬂation in ﬂat FLRW did not occur all the
way to the past, in which case it is singular [cases 1a and 1(b)i] or potentially geodesically
complete due to some modiﬁcations to general relativity or quantum gravity eﬀects [example
cases 1(b)iiA and 1(b)iiB], or inﬂation happened all the way to the past, in which case either
there is a curvature singularity at ﬁnite time [Case 2a] or the beginning of inﬂation is at
t →−∞[Case 2b].
Therefore, this very last case is the only inﬂationary scenario in ﬂat FLRW that might
evade the singularity problem within the validity of general relativity and is the topic of
interest for the rest of this paper. In this context, the existing result — often referred to
as the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem [19] in the cosmological literature2 — states that if
H(t) > 0 for all t ∈(−∞, t2], then null geodesics are past incomplete. Yet, this does not
always imply the presence of a singularity as t →−∞, and the spacetime might actually
be extendible beyond the past boundary at tini = −∞. As alluded to in the introduction,
ﬂat de Sitter is a nice example of this feature, but exact dS is a very special solution that
cannot represent our universe. A necessary feature of all the inﬂationary scenarios is that
H(t) is not constant in time, allowing quantum ﬂuctuations to generate the seeds of our

universe’s large-scale structures consistent with observations. Therefore, it is more relevant
to examine the singularity for ‘quasi-de Sitter’ universes. In particular the next natural
step is to study those that approach dS in the inﬁnite past, as to ﬁt in the Classiﬁcation
2b. A similar premise was used in [27], but we shall make it more precise in the following
deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 2.5. A ﬂat FLRW spacetime as deﬁned in Section 2.1 is said to be ﬂat3 past-
asymptotically de Sitter if
H(t) t→−∞
=
HΛ + o(1) ,
˙H(t) t→−∞
=
0 + o(1) ,
where HΛ ∈R>0. Note that the asymptotic little-o notation is equivalent to saying that
lim
t→−∞H(t) = HΛ ,
lim
t→−∞
˙H(t) = 0 .
Remark. Exact de Sitter is a solution to the Einstein equations with a positive cosmological
constant Λ ∈R>0. In ﬂat FLRW, the corresponding Hubble parameter is a constant given
by HΛ = ±
p
Λ/3, and here we are choosing the expanding branch with positive constant
Hubble parameter. This is the motivation for the above notation in past-asymptotically dS.
In the following Lemma, we show that the deﬁnition of past-asymptotically de Sitter
could have been H(t) →HΛ and the limit of ˙H exists (and is ﬁnite) as t →−∞.
Lemma 2.6. Suppose a ﬂat FLRW spacetime as deﬁned in Section 2.1 is such that
H(t) t→−∞
=
HΛ + o(1) ,
˙H(t) t→−∞
=
c + o(1) ,
where HΛ ∈R>0 and c ∈R. Then the spacetime is past-asymptotically de Sitter.
Proof. We note that
lim
t→−∞
¨a
a =
lim
t→−∞( ˙H + H2) = c + H2
Λ ,
leading to
lim
t→−∞¨a =
lim
t→−∞
¨a
a × a =
lim
t→−∞
¨a
a × lim
t→−∞a = (c + H2
Λ) × 0 = 0 .
Note that we are using a(t) ↘0 as t →−∞. This follows since HΛ > 0; see the remark
after Lemma 2.2. At the same time, we have
lim
t→−∞˙a =
lim
t→−∞
˙a
a × a =
lim
t→−∞
˙a
a × lim
t→−∞a = HΛ × 0 = 0 .
Therefore, applying L’Hˆopital’s rule results in
lim
t→−∞H =

Λ) ,
3Since we will always be concerned with ﬂat spatial sections, the adjective ‘ﬂat’ shall often be omitted
and simply implied.
10

which can hold only if c = 0 since limt→−∞H = HΛ.
In the following Lemma, we show another alternative notion of past-asymptotically de
Sitter.
Lemma 2.7. Suppose there exists a smooth function f : I →R such that
a(t) = eHΛt + f(t) ,
˙a(t) = HΛeHΛt + ˙f(t) ,
¨a(t) = H2
ΛeHΛt + ¨f(t) ,
and such that f(t), ˙f(t), ¨f(t) are asymptotically o(eHΛt) as t →−∞, i.e.,
lim
t→−∞
f(t)
eHΛt =
lim
t→−∞
˙f(t)
eHΛt =
lim
t→−∞
¨f(t)
eHΛt = 0 .
Then the spacetime is past-asymptotically de Sitter.
Proof. We note that
H(t) −HΛ = ˙a(t)
a(t) −HΛ = HΛeHΛt + ˙f(t)
eHΛt + f(t)
−HΛ = e−HΛt( ˙f(t) −HΛf(t))
1 + e−HΛtf(t)
t→−∞
−→0 ,
and
˙H(t) = ¨a(t)
a(t) −˙a(t)2
a(t)2 = (H2
ΛeHΛt + ¨f(t))(eHΛt + f(t)) −(HΛeHΛt + ˙f(t))2
(eHΛt + f(t))2
= e−HΛt(H2
Λf(t) −2HΛ ˙f(t) + ¨f(t)) + e−2HΛt(f(t) ¨f(t) −˙f(t)2)
(1 + e−HΛtf(t))2
t→−∞
−→0 .
Remarks. Note that the converse of the previous lemma does not generally hold. A counter-
example could simply be a(t) = (1−t)eHΛt, which respects H →HΛ and ˙H →0 as t →−∞,
but which is not asymptotically of the form a(t) = eHΛt + o(eHΛt). Therefore, a scale factor
that is past-asymptotically of exponential form is not equivalent to our Deﬁnition 2.5 of a
past-asymptotically dS spacetime. Nevertheless, we shall explore both premises where the
scale factor is past-asymptotically of exponential form and where the spacetime is past-
asymptotically dS.
In the hypothesis of the previous lemma, note that we could have written a(t) t→−∞
=
a0eHΛt + o(eHΛt), ˙a(t) t→−∞
=
a0HΛeHΛt + o(eHΛt), etc., for some constant a0 ∈R>0, but a0
is a physically irrelevant dimensionless quantity in ﬂat FLRW, so we can set it to unity.
As another remark, one could replace the hypothesis of Lemma 2.7 by just ¨a(t) t→−∞
=
et+
o(et) and the conditions that a(t) ↘0 and ˙a(t) ↘0 as t →−∞. Indeed, if (¨a(t)−et)/et →0
as t →−∞, then by L’Hˆopital’s rule since ˙a(t) ↘0, we must have (˙a(t) −et)/et →0 [so
˙a(t) t→−∞
=
et + o(et)], and applying L’Hˆopital’s rule once more, together with a(t) ↘0,
implies (a(t) −et)/et →0 [so a(t) t→−∞
=
et + o(et)]. Therefore, the asymptotic conditions
on a(t) and ˙a(t) are implied by the asymptotic condition on ¨a(t) in this context.
11

Another motivation for Deﬁnition 2.5 is that if the spacetime approaches dS in the
asymptotic past, we expect to recover the non-singular nature of exact dS, i.e., there should
not be any scalar curvature singularity on the past boundary. To be precise, we conjecture
the following:
Any scalar contractions of the Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and Ricci scalar are ﬁnite
as t →−∞in a past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetime.
We do not provide a rigorous proof of this statement, but as we will see and argue later
in Section 3.5, any scalar curvature invariants constructed out of the product of n Rie-
mann tensors contracted with the metric tensor and its inverse (thus possibly involving
the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar) in ﬂat FLRW seems to consist of a linear combination
of {H2n, H2(n−1) ˙H, H2(n−2) ˙H2, · · · , H2 ˙Hn−1, ˙Hn}. Therefore, it is straightforward to see
from the deﬁnition of past-asymptotically dS that any such scalar curvature invariants
should have a ﬁnite limit as t →−∞.
While past-asymptotically dS spacetimes should not have C2 scalar curvature singulari-
ties according to the previous statement (where C2 refers to the diﬀerentiability class of the
metric tensor), this does not guarantee metric extendibility beyond the spacetime boundary
at tini = −∞. Conditions for metric extendibility will be the subject of the next section.
We can already mention that other kinds of singularity such as parallelly propagated singu-
larities can still be present as t →−∞in past-asymptotically dS universes, and those may
be an obstruction to spacetime extendibility (cf. [27,29] and references therein).
To end this section, let us mention that one might want to consider other leading-order
functions for a(t), ˙a(t), and ¨a(t) in the limit t →−∞than those in the hypothesis of Lemma
2.7. However, ignoring (pathological) cases where H(t) oscillates without reaching a limit or
where H(t) is unbounded (in which case there is a scalar curvature singularity to the past),
the only possible situations as t →−∞are H(t) →HΛ > 0 or H(t) ↘0 (when H(t) > 0
at least in a neighborhood of tini = −∞). The case H(t) →HΛ > 0 as t →−∞is the
motivation for our deﬁnition of past-asymptotically dS spacetime, while the case H(t) ↘0
would correspond to something like a past-asymptotically Minkowski spacetime. We are
only interested in the former case in the present work. In such a situation, as mentioned in
the remark after Lemma 2.2, a(t) must be bounded in between two decaying exponentials,
hence additional justiﬁcation for looking at the asymptotic functional expressions for a(t)
and its derivatives given in the hypothesis of Lemma 2.7.
As a couple of examples of asymptotic functions that are not of interest in the current
work, one could have a(t) = 1/|t|α (α ∈R>0), which goes to 0 slower than et as t →−∞,
or a(t) = exp(−exp(|t|α)) (α ∈(0, 1]), which goes to 0 faster than et as t →−∞. Both
examples respect the conditions of (2.3) for inﬂation with Iinf = (−∞, 0), but by direct
evaluation, one ﬁnds that H(t) →∞as t →−∞in both cases. A couple more examples
could be a(t) = exp(−|t|α) and a(t) = exp(−(ln |t|)α) (α ∈R>0 in both cases), again
respecting (2.3) with Iinf = (−∞, 0), but in those cases one ﬁnds H(t) ↘0 as t →−∞.
Past-asymptotically Minkowski spacetimes could be the topic of a diﬀerent paper.

Metric extendibility
After formally deﬁning spacetime extendibility (Section 3.1) and presenting how exact dS
may be continously extended as a warm-up (Section 3.2), we derive a C0-extendibility
theorem in Section 3.3, which either requires an asymptotic condition on the scale factor
alone, a(t) = eht + o(eht) as t →−∞for some h > 0, or the condition that H →h > 0
as t →−∞. Asymptotic conditions on a(t) and its derivatives lead to higher-regularity
theorems in Section 3.4, and we ﬁnally discuss curvature singularities in Section 3.5.
3.1
Further preliminaries
Our conventions will follow [47, Sec. 2], which we brieﬂy review.
Let k ≥0 be an integer or ∞.
A Ck spacetime (M, g) is a Ck+1 four-dimensional
manifold M (connected, Hausdorﬀ, second countable) equipped with a Ck Lorentzian met-
ric tensor g (i.e., its components gµν are Ck functions in any coordinate system) and a
time orientation induced by some C0 timelike vector ﬁeld. A future-directed timelike curve
γ : [a, b] →M is a piecewise C1 curve such that ˙γ(s) := dγ/ds is future-directed timelike for
all s ∈[a, b], including its break points and endpoints (understood as one-sided derivatives).
Past-directed timelike curves are deﬁned time-dually. The timelike future of a point p ∈M
with respect to an open set U ⊂M containing p is denoted by I+(p, U) and is deﬁned by
the set of points q ∈U such that there is a future-directed timelike curve γ : [a, b] →U from
p to q. The timelike past I−is deﬁned time-dually. If we need to emphasize the metric g,
then we will write I±
g .
Deﬁnition 3.1.
Suppose (M, g) is a C∞spacetime and (Mext, gext) is a Ck spacetime.
Then we say that (Mext, gext) is a Ck extension of (M, g) if there is an isometric embedding
(M, g) ,→(Mext, gext) such that M ⊂Mext is a proper open subset. Note that we are
identifying M with its image under the embedding.
Deﬁnition 3.2. Let (Mext, gext) be a Ck extension of a C∞spacetime (M, g). The topo-
logical boundary of M within Mext is denoted by ∂M. A future-directed timelike curve
γ : [a, b] →Mext is called a future-terminating timelike curve for a point p ∈∂M provided
γ(b) = p and γ
 [a, b)

⊂M. Past-terminating timelike curves are deﬁned time-dually. The
future and past boundaries of M within Mext are
∂+M = {p ∈∂M | there is a future-terminating timelike curve for p} ,
∂−M = {p ∈∂M | there is a past-terminating timelike curve for p} .
3.2
Warm-up: exact de Sitter
The ﬂat de Sitter model is a FLRW spacetime with vanishing spatial curvature and an
exponentially growing scale factor.
Speciﬁcally, the manifold is M = R × R3, and the
metric is (2.1) with scale factor a(t) ∝exp
p
Λ/3 t

for some real positive constant Λ.
This is a solution to the Einstein ﬁeld equations with cosmological constant Λ. From here
on, we set the arbitrary proportionality constant to unity, and for this subsection we also
13

work in units where Λ = 3, such that the scale factor simply reads a(t) = et. The time
orientation is given by declaring ∂t to be future directed.
We deﬁne conformal time, η, such that it satisﬁes dη = dt/a(t), i.e., so that a ﬂat
FLRW metric may be expressed as a conformal transformation of Minkowski spacetime,
g = a(η)2(−dη2 + hE). In dS, we may take η(t) = −
R ∞
t
d˜t/a(˜t) = −e−t = −1/a(t), and
this allows us to express the metric of dS as
g = 1
η2
 −dη2 + dr2 + r2dΩ2
.
(3.10)
As inspired by [27], we then introduce new coordinates (λ, v) as functions of (t, r) via4
λ(t) :=
Z t
−∞
d˜t a(˜t)
and
v(t, r) := η(t) + r ,
(3.11)
so for dS this gives
λ(t) = et = a(t)
and
v(t, r) = −e−t + r = −1
λ(t) + r .
(3.12)
Since v + 1/λ = r > 0, the coordinates (λ, v) are a diﬀeomorphism from
{(t, r) | t ∈R and r > 0} onto U := {(λ, v) | λ ∈(0, ∞) and v ∈(−1/λ, ∞)} .
(3.13)
Using dλ = a dt (equivalently dt = dλ/a) and dv = dt/a+dr (equivalently dr = dv−dλ/a2),
we have
−dt2 + a2dr2 = −1
a2 dλ2 + a2

dv −1
a2 dλ
2
= a2dv2 −2 dλ dv .
Therefore the metric on U × S2 is given by
g = −2 dλ dv + a2dv2 + a2r2dΩ2 .
(3.14)
In the above expression, a and r are functions of λ and v. Explicitly, plugging (3.12) into
(3.14) speciﬁcally gives for dS
g = −2 dλ dv + λ2dv2 + (λv + 1)2dΩ2 .
(3.15)
Note that t = −∞corresponds to λ = 0. From equation (3.15), there is no degeneracy at
λ = 0. Therefore these coordinates can be used to extend the spacetime through λ = 0. Of
course the extension is not unique without any further assumptions.5
To illustrate the existence of a C0 extension, note that U ∪{(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R}
is a smooth manifold since U is given by (3.13). Therefore,
Mext = M ∪
 {(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R} × S2
(3.16)
4By virtue of satisfying dλ = a dt, λ can be interpreted as the aﬃne parameter of null geodesics, which
are characterized by v = constant (as well as constant angular coordinates).
5Evidently, the extension should still be a solution to whatever ﬁeld equations are at play. Here we are
not prescribing any ﬁeld equations and keep the discussion purely geometrical, i.e., results apply for arbitrary
metrical theories of gravity.
14

is a smooth manifold which contains M as a proper subset. We deﬁne the extended metric
via
gext =
 g
on M
−2 dλ dv + dΩ2
on {(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R} × S2.
(3.17)
We choose the time orientation on Mext such that ∂λ + ∂v is future directed for λ ≤0.
This time orientation agrees with the original one on M. Then (Mext, gext) is a continuous
extension of (M, g) as deﬁned in Section 3.1. Of course, other choices could be made for
the metric in the extension. In particular, there exists C∞extensions such as full (global)
de Sitter spacetime.
Lastly, we note that λ = 0 serves as the past boundary ∂−M of M for this extension.
To see this, ﬁx v0 ∈R and ω0 ∈S2. Deﬁne γ : [0, f(v0)] →Mext by
λ ◦γ(s) = s
and
v ◦γ(s) = v0 + s ,
(3.18)
and γ(s) keeps the ﬁxed value ω0 on S2. Here f(v0) is given by f(v0) = 1 for v0 ≥−1/2 and
f(v0) = −1/(2v0) for v0 ≤−1/2. (This choice of f(v0) is mostly arbitrary — this example
is suﬃcient to ensure γ remains in the manifold, but it is not necessary.) Then γ has past
endpoint, γ(0), at (0, v0, ω0). Since U is given by (3.13), the choice of f ensures that γ maps
into Mext. Using (3.15), we see that γ is a timelike curve:
gext(γ′, γ′)|γ(s) = gext(∂λ + ∂v, ∂λ + ∂v)|γ(s) = −2 +
 λ ◦γ(s)
2 = −2 + s2 ≤−1 .
Conversely, it is straightforward to see that if p is any point on ∂−M, then λ(p) = 0. Hence
∂−M coincides with the λ = 0 hypersurface.
3.3
Conditions for continuous extendibility
Now we consider spacetimes that in some sense asymptotically approach ﬂat de Sitter
towards the past. The manifold is given by M = (−∞, tmax) × R3 for some tmax ∈R. The
metric is ﬂat FLRW as before, but now the scale factor a: (−∞, tmax) →(0, ∞) is either
assumed to satisfy
a(t) t→−∞
=
eht + o(eht)
(3.19)
or
H(t) := ˙a(t)
a(t)
t→−∞
→
h
(3.20)
for some h ∈R>0. (By deﬁnition, the former assumption means
 a(t) −eht
/eht →0 as
t →−∞.) We assume a(t) is smooth so that (M, g) is a smooth spacetime. Again, the time
orientation is given by declaring ∂t to be future directed.
Remarks. The positive ﬁnite number h plays the role of HΛ in Deﬁnition 2.5. Note that
while the scale factor in (3.19) is past-asymptotically exponential (so it has the same form
as exact dS in the asymptotic past), it does not necessarily qualify as past-asymptotically de
Sitter as per our Deﬁnition 2.5. Indeed, according to Lemma 2.7, we would need knowledge
of the ﬁrst and second derivatives of a(t) to properly call the scale factor past-asymptotically
dS. Likewise, H →h > 0 is not past-asymptotically dS without proper knowledge of ˙H.
15

However, as it will soon become clear, knowledge of the derivatives of a(t) or H(t) is not
necessary to derive C0 extendibility results. Still, we will see that the C0-extendibility result
does apply to past-asymptotically dS spacetimes.
Let us mention that all the results in this subsection apply without knowledge of the sign
of ¨a [and even of ˙a if the assumption is6 (3.19)]. Therefore, the results can apply to universes
that are not necessarily past-asymptotically inﬂationary — one could have examples that
are cyclic (i.e., undergoing a series of bounces and turnarounds) and only inﬂationary in
an ‘averaged’ sense (e.g., [61,62]). If the universe is past-asymtotically inﬂationary (as per
Classiﬁcation 2b), then the results certainly apply.
Fix any tL ∈(−∞, tmax); its choice does not matter for what follows. We take our
deﬁnition of conformal time to be
η(t) = −
Z tL
t
d˜t
a(˜t) .
(3.21)
Again, we introduce new coordinates (λ, v) as functions of (t, r) via (3.11). (The asymptotic
assumption on a implies that the integral for λ converges.) Note that λ maps (−∞, tmax)
onto (0, λmax) where λmax =
R tmax
−∞dt a(t).
Since a is positive, the mapping t 7→λ is
invertible. From this it follows that the coordinates (λ, v) are a diﬀeomorphism from {(t, r) |
t ∈(−∞, tmax) and r > 0} onto its image. Unlike (3.13), there is not an easily deduced
closed form for the image, however we know that it lies in λ > 0.
Notation remark. Since t and λ are invertible, we can view η as a function of λ via η ◦t(λ);
we will abuse notation and call this η(λ). Context can be used to distinguish between η(t)
and η(λ). Likewise, if we write a(λ), then we mean a ◦t(λ). Again, context can be used to
distinguish between the two.
Note that η(λ) is a strictly increasing function deﬁned on (0, λmax) and is a diﬀeomor-
phism onto its image. Since v −η = r > 0, the coordinates (λ, v) are a diﬀeomorphism from
(−∞, tmax) × (0, ∞) onto
U :=

(λ, v) | λ ∈(0, λmax) and v ∈
 η(λ), ∞
	
.
(3.22)
In analogy to (3.16) in exact dS, we then wish to choose the extended manifold to be
Mext = M ∪({(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R} × S2). The following lemma ensures that if we
attach the lower half plane λ ≤0 to U, then the resulting space is indeed a manifold.
Lemma 3.3. Let U denote the image of the (λ, v) coordinates. For each v ∈R, there is a
λ > 0 such that (0, λ) × (v −λ, ∞) ⊂U. Consequently, U ∪{(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R} is a
smooth manifold.
Proof. We showed that η(t) →−∞as t →−∞, so η(λ) →−∞as λ →0+. Fix v ∈R.
There is a λ > 0 such that η(λ) < v −λ. Since η is an increasing function, it follows that
6If the assumption is (3.20), then we necessarily know that ˙a ↘0 as t →−∞, so the universe has to be
expanding in a neighborhood of t = −∞. However, this still holds regardless of ¨a, so it may or may not be
past-asymptotically inﬂationary.
16

the vertical line {(λ′, v −λ) | λ′ ∈(0, λ)} is contained in U. Likewise, for any v′ > v −λ,
we also have v′ > η(λ) and so the same vertical line based at v′ is also contained in U.
The next lemma will guarantee that the extended metric is not degenerate on the bound-
ary of the extension.
Lemma 3.4. Suppose a(t) satisﬁes (3.19) or (3.20). Then a(t)η(t) →−1/h as t →−∞.
Proof. Let us start with the assumption (3.19). Deﬁne Θ(t) := 1/a(t) −e−ht. Claim 1:
Θ(t) = o(e−ht) as t →−∞. Indeed,
Θ(t)
e−ht = 1/a(t) −e−ht
e−ht
= eht
a(t) −1 →0
as
t →−∞;
the limit follows since the asymptotic assumption on the scale factor implies a(t)/eht →1
as t →−∞. This proves claim 1.
Claim 2: eht R tL
t
d˜t Θ(˜t) →0 as t →−∞. Fix ε > 0. By claim 1, there is a δ > 0 such
that t < δ implies
−εe−ht < Θ(t) < εe−ht .

To prove claim 2, it suﬃces to show eht R δ

Theorem 3.5. Let (M, g) be the smooth spacetime given by
M = (−∞, tmax) × R3
and
g = −dt2 + a2(t)hE ,
time oriented by declaring ∂t to be future directed. If the scale factor satisﬁes
a(t) t→−∞
=
eht + o(eht)
for some
h ∈R>0 ,
or if it satisﬁes
H(t) := ˙a(t)
a(t)
t→−∞
→
h
for some
h ∈R>0 ,
then a continuous extension (Mext, gext) of (M, g) is given by
Mext = M ∪Mλ≤0 ,
Mλ≤0 := {(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R} × S2
and
gext =
 −2 dλ dv + a(λ)2dv2 + a(λ)2(v −η(λ))2dΩ2
on M
−2 dλ dv + h−2dΩ2
on Mλ≤0 .
The (λ, v) coordinates are deﬁned in (3.11), and η is the conformal time given by (3.21).
The time orientation on (Mext, gext) is determined by declaring ∂λ +∂v to be future directed,
which agrees with the original time orientation on M. The past boundary ∂−M is given by
the λ = 0 hypersurface which is topologically R × S2.
Proof. The same computations leading to (3.14) in the previous subsection still apply, hence
the metric in (λ, v, θ, φ) coordinates is again given by (3.14). Since a(t(λ)) ↘0 as λ →0+,
the worrisome term in the metric is a2r2, where a(λ)r(λ, v) = a(λ)
 v −η(λ)

. We want to
show that this expression limits to a ﬁnite nonzero number as λ →0+ in order to achieve
nondegeneracy of the metric. Since λ →0+ if and only if t →−∞, this follows from Lemma
3.4.
Now we show how to obtain a continuous extension. We choose the extended manifold to
be Mext = M ∪Mλ≤0 — Lemma 3.3 ensures that this is indeed a manifold. Again in analogy
to (3.17) in exact dS, the metric gext on Mext is taken to be g on M and7 −2 dλ dv+h−2dΩ2
on {(λ, v) | λ ≤0 and v ∈R}×S2. Thus (Mext, gext) gives the desired continuous extension.
Furthermore, as in exact dS, λ = 0 coincides with the past boundary ∂−M for this
extension. One can show this with a similar curve γ : [0, f(v0)] →Mext as deﬁned in (3.18),
but one has to be a little more careful choosing the function f(v0); the existence of some f
is guaranteed by Lemma 3.3 since we can draw a tiny timelike curve from v0 on λ = 0. It
will be timelike for a small enough curve since so long as a(λ) <
√
2.
Corollary 3.6. A ﬂat past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetime is continuously extendible.
Proof. Past-asymptotically dS spacetimes satisfy H →h > 0 and ˙H →0 as t →−∞, so
Theorem 3.5 applies.
7Note that the metric in the extension here is the same as in (3.17), where we had set h = 1.

Figure 5: Venn-like diagram of classes of functions [either a(t) or H(t)] characterized by their
asymptotic behavior as t →−∞. We see that a(t) = eht + o(eht) (green circle) is not equivalent
to H →h (purple rectangle; neither one implies the other without further assumptions), but there
is some overlap (called region II in the ﬁgure). The condition H →h implies ln(a) = ht + o(ht)
(dashed red rectangle), hence the purple rectangle lies within the red one, but the converse is not
true, leaving region IV. Functions that fall inside the green circle and the purple rectangle (so regions
I, II, and III) are C0 extendible. We remain agnostic about functions that fall in region IV. Examples
are presented in the text.
Examples. Let us consider the following scale factor ﬁrst:
a(t) = et + sin2(e−3t)e2t t→−∞
=
et + o(et) .
(3.24)
Since it respects (3.19), the resulting spacetime must be C0 extendible by Theorem 3.5.
However, note that H = ˙a/a does not have a limit as t →−∞; hence it does not re-
spect (3.20). Therefore, this is an example of C0-extendible spacetime that is not past-
asymptotically dS. This falls in region I of the diagram presented in Figure 5. Conversely,
let us consider
a(t) = (1 + t2)et t→−∞
̸=
et + o(et) .
This does not satisfy (3.19), but a simple calculation shows H →1 (and ˙H →0) as t →−∞,
so it does satisfy (3.20). Therefore, it still qualiﬁes for C0 extendibility by Theorem 3.5.
This falls in region III of Figure 5.
These examples highlight the fact that conditions on a(t) alone and on H(t) [which
involves ˙a(t)] are not always equivalent. Of course, in many instances they are equivalent;
a simple example could be a(t) = et + e2t, which falls in the overlapping region II of Figure
5.
There exists a straightforward relation between H →h and a condition on a(t) if we
express the latter as a logarithm. Speciﬁcally, we note that H →h as t →−∞implies
ln a(t) t→−∞
=
ht + o(ht). Indeed, using L’Hˆopital’s rule
lim
t→−∞
ln a(t)
ht
=
lim
t→−∞
H(t)
h
= 1 .
19

However, the converse is not true in general. A counter-example could be ln a(t) = t +
sin
 t2√−t t→−∞
=
t + o(t), t < 0, for which one can verify that H(t) does not have a limit
as t →−∞. Thus this example falls in region IV of Figure 5.
Remarks. Note that, contrary to regions I, II, and III of that diagram, we do not know
whether functions falling in region IV admit C0 extensions.
For the example ln a(t) =
t + sin
 t2√−t, one can numerically integrate 1/a(t) to show that aη does not converge
as t →−∞. Therefore, this suggests functions in region IV are generally not extendible
within the (λ, v) coordinates of this section. Let us stress again that this does not mean
general inextendibility since our statements are restricted to a particular coordinate system.
In fact, this holds for any functions that do not ﬁt in the classes of functions of Figure 5.
Furthermore, even within (λ, v) coordinates, we do not know whether regions I, II, and III
of Figure 5 exhaust all possibilities allowing C0 extensions.
Let us end this subsection with an important observation. As is known but perhaps
not always appreciated, the concepts of spacetime extendibility and singularities are not
equivalent. We have encountered such an example above: indeed, the scale factor (3.24)
allows a C0 extension of the spacetime, but the divergence of the Hubble parameter in
this case implies the presence of a scalar curvature singularity at t = −∞[e.g., the Ricci
and Kretschmann scalar curvature invariants diverge; recall (2.8)].
We thus stress that
while past-asymptotically dS spacetimes are expected to be always free of scalar curvature
singularities and while they are always C0 extendible, there certainly are C0-extendible
examples that do not ﬁt in that class and that might still be singular.
3.4
Gaining higher regularity
We have so far found an asymptotic condition on a(t) or on H(t) that ensures C0 metric
extendibility. Naturally, we then wish to ask what asymptotic conditions are needed to ﬁnd
more regular extensions, e.g., an extension that is continuously diﬀerentiable once (C1),
twice (C2), or more. We address these questions in the following subsections.
3.4.1
Continuously diﬀerentiable once and twice
From the metric g = −2 dλ dv + a2dv2 + a2r2dΩ2, we see that we have to control a and ar
(as functions of λ and v) to gain higher regularity. The v-derivatives are well-behaved at
λ = 0 since
∂
∂va(t(λ)) = 0 and, recalling r(λ, v) = v −η(t(λ)),
∂
∂v

a(t(λ))r(λ, v)

= a(t(λ)) λ→0+

∂λa(t(λ)) = da

The above calculation shows that the following limits are desirable:
H(t) →h
and
1
a(t) + H(t)η(t) →c ∈R
as t →−∞,
(3.27)
for some real number c. Recall that taking the limit as t →−∞is equivalent to taking the
limit as λ →0+.
Lemma 3.7. Suppose both a(t) = eht+o
 e(2+ε)ht
and ˙a(t) = heht+o
 e(2+ε)ht
as t →−∞
for some h, ε ∈R>0. Then (3.27) holds.
Proof. Choose tL1 < 0 such that t < tL1 implies heht −e(2+ε)ht > 0, |a(t) −eht| < e(2+ε)ht,
and |˙a(t) −heht| < e(2+ε)ht. Then
0 < heht −e(2+ε)ht < ˙a(t) < heht + e(2+ε)ht
and
1
eht + e(2+ε)ht <
1
a(t) <
1
eht −e(2+ε)ht ,
(3.28)
so H(t) = ˙a(t)/a(t) →h as t →−∞follows via the squeeze theorem.
Now we show 1/a(t) + H(t)η(t) approaches some real number c. Note that part of the
problem is deducing the value of c.
Set Θ(t) := 1/a(t)−e−ht. Claim: Θ(t) = o(eεht/2) as t →−∞. To prove the claim, note
that (3.28) implies
1
a(t) <
1
eht−e(2+ε)ht =
e−ht
1−e(1+ε)ht = e−ht  1 + e(1+ε)ht + e2(1+ε)ht + · · ·

.
Hence
1/a(t) −e−ht
eεht/2
< eεht/2 + e(1+3ε/2)ht + · · · .
The right hand side limits to zero. Likewise, the reverse inequality is similar. Therefore the
claim follows by the squeeze theorem.
By the claim, there is a tL2 such that t < tL2 implies |Θ(t)| < ehεt/2. Let Θ±(t) :=
max{0, ±Θ(t)} denote the positive and negative parts of Θ(t), so that Θ(t) = Θ+(t)−Θ−(t).
Then |Θ(t)| < ehεt/2 implies both
R tL2
−∞dt Θ+(t) and
R tL2
−∞dt Θ−(t) converge to real numbers.
Therefore
R tL2
−∞dt Θ(t) converges to a real number as well and hence so does
R tL
−∞dt Θ(t).
Then
η(t) = −
Z tL
t
d˜t a(˜t)−1 = h−1e−htL −h−1e−ht −

The right hand side limits to the ﬁnite number

as t →−∞. Indeed, a quick calculation shows that the hypotheses on a(t) and ˙a(t) imply
e−ht
1−e(1+ε)ht −H(t)e−ht
h
limits to 0 as t →−∞.
The reverse inequality is similar.
Thus
1/a(t) + H(t)η(t) limits to c by the squeeze theorem.
Remarks.
- It is not hard to see that Lemma 3.7 still holds under the weaker set of assump-
tions “a(t) t→−∞
=
eht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
and ˙a(t) t→−∞
=
heht + o
 e(1+ε)ht
.” However, if
a(t) t→−∞
=
eht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
and limt→−∞
˙a(t)−heht
e(2+ε)ht
exists or diverges to ±∞, then an
application of L’Hˆopital’s rule shows that the limit must be zero, and hence we must
have had ˙a(t) t→−∞
=
heht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
to begin with. Therefore the only time the
weaker set of assumptions holds but ˙a(t) ̸= heht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
as t →−∞is when
limt→−∞
˙a(t)−heht
e(1+ε)ht = 0, limt→−∞
˙a(t)−heht
e(2+ε)ht
does not exist, and limt→−∞
a(t)−eht
e(2+ε)ht = 0 —
a situation which seems of scant importance.
- In fact, using L’Hˆopital’s rule again, the hypothesis of Lemma 3.7 is equivalent to the
set of assumptions “a(t) ↘0 as t →−∞and ˙a(t) t→−∞
=
heht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
.”
- If a(t) = et + e2t or
a(t) =
et
1 + et/t
t→−∞
=
et −e2t
t + . . . ,
then direct evaluation shows that (3.27) does not hold.
The latter is a counter-
example showing that Lemma 3.7 would not hold if the assumption were “a(t) t→−∞
=
eht + o(e2ht) and ˙a(t) t→−∞
=
heht + o(e2ht).” Hence taking ε = 0 in the hypothesis of
Lemma 3.7 is not suﬃcient to achieve its conclusion.
Theorem 3.8. Let (M, g) be the smooth spacetime given by
M = (−∞, tmax) × R3
and
g = −dt2 + a2(t)hE ,
time oriented by declaring ∂t to be future directed. Let (λ, v) denote the coordinates given
by (3.11).
(a) Suppose a(t) = eht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
and ˙a(t) = heht + o
 e(2+ε)ht
as t →−∞for some
ε > 0. Then (M, g) admits a C1 extension through the λ = 0 hypersurface.
(b) Suppose the assumptions from part (a) and suppose limt→−∞˙H(t)/a(t)2 exists within
R, where H(t) = ˙a(t)/a(t). Then (M, g) admits a C2 extension through the λ = 0
hypersurface.
Remark. By “admits a Ck extension through the λ = 0 hypersurface” we mean there is a
neighborhood V of the λ = 0 hypersurface, {0} × R × S2, and a Ck Lorentzian metric gext
on V such that gext = g on M ∩V , and a time orientation on V which agrees with the one
on M ∩V . Consequently, if Mext = M ∪V , then (Mext, gext) is a Ck extension of (M, g).
22

Note that we are certainly not constructing any type of maximal extension.
Moreover,
the extended metric gext cannot be the same as the one introduced in Theorem 3.5. To
construct the desired Ck extension, it suﬃces to show that all the partial derivatives (up to
order k) of the metric components have continuous limits to the λ = 0 hypersurface. Then
the existence of a suﬃciently diﬀerentiable metric extension follows from [63]; see also [64].
However, since the metric components are well behaved with respect to v-derivatives, it is
easy to construct a Ck extension simply by creating a Taylor series in λ with coeﬃcients
given by the partial derivatives at the past boundary. This is demonstrated for the C1 case
in the proof below.
Proof.
(a) Within M the metric takes the form g = −2 dλ dv + a2dv2 + (ar)2dΩ2 in the (λ, v)
coordinates. In this expression, a and r are functions of λ and v. Using (3.26), we
have ∂λ(ar)2 = 2a(v −η)(H(v −η) −1/a). Since the condition for C0 extendibility
is met, we have aη →−1/h as λ →0+. It thus follows from Lemma 3.7 that ∂λ(ar)2
extends continuously to the λ = 0 hypersurface. In fact, its continuous extension is
given by 2(v −c/h), where c is given by (3.27). The other partial derivatives, ∂v(ar)2,
∂λa2, ∂va2, all limit to zero. Since these derivatives have continuous limits to the
λ = 0 hypersurface, it follows that a2 and (ar)2 admit C1 extensions on the lower
half-plane λ ≤0. Explicitly, a C1 spacetime extension can be deﬁned via
gext = −2 dλ dv + 1
h2
 1 + 2h(hv −c)λ

dΩ2
for λ ∈(−δ, 0].
By choosing δ > 0 small enough, we can ensure that the metric
remains Lorentzian. Moreover, we can ensure that ∂λ + ∂v is timelike throughout
λ ∈(−δ, 0]. Therefore, we time-orient the extension by declaring ∂λ + ∂v to be future
directed, which agrees with the original time orientation on M.
(b) Under the assumptions of part (a), it is easy to see that each of the second order
partial derivatives of all the metric components limit to a ﬁnite value on approach to
the λ = 0 hypersurface except for ∂2
λa2 and ∂2
λ(ar)2. It is these terms where we need
the extra assumption on ˙H/a2. Recalling (3.25), we ﬁnd
∂2a
∂λ2 = ∂H
∂λ = dH
dt
dt
dλ =
˙H
a ,
(3.29)
and so we have ∂2
λa2 = 2( ˙H + H2). Since H2 →h2 and
˙H →0 under the extra
assumption, ∂2
λa2 limits to 2h2 on approach to the λ = 0 hypersurface. Using the
calculation of ∂λ(ar)2 from part (a), as well as (3.26) and (3.29), we have
∂2
λ(ar)2 = ∂λ
 2a(v −η)(vH −Hη −1/a)

= 2(vH −Hη −1/a)∂λ
 a(v −η)

+ 2a(v −η)∂λ(vH −Hη −1/a)
= 2(vH −Hη −1/a)2 + 2 ˙H(v −η)2 .
The ﬁrst term above limits to a ﬁnite value by Lemma 3.7. For the second term, we
have ˙H(v −η)2 =
˙H
a2 (av −aη)2. Since a ↘0, aη →−1/h, and ˙H/a2 limits to a ﬁnite
23

value by assumption, it follows that ∂2
λ(ar)2 limits to a ﬁnite value on approach to
the λ = 0 hypersurface. The C2 extension can be obtained in the same way as in part
(a).
Corollary 3.9. Suppose that for some numbers h ∈R>0 and b ∈R, we have
a(t) = eht + be3ht + o(e3ht) ,
˙a(t) = heht + 3hbe3ht + o(e3ht) ,
¨a(t) = h2eht + 9h2be3ht + o(e3ht) .
Then (M, g) admits a C2 extension through the λ = 0 hypersurface.
Proof. A straightforward limit calculation shows that ˙H(t)/a2(t) →4bh2 as t →−∞.
Remarks. In the previous corollary, note that a(t), ˙a(t), and ¨a(t) respect the conditions
of Lemma 2.7, hence the spacetime in that example may be called past-asymptotically de
Sitter.
Note also that we may equivalently rewrite a(t), ˙a(t), and ¨a(t) in the previous corollary
as ∼eht + O(e3ht) as t →−∞. This asymptotic condition matches the one already found
in [29].
Furthermore, the existence and ﬁniteness of limt→−∞˙H/a2 as a condition for
spacetime extendibility matches the results [27,29].
3.4.2
Continuously diﬀerentiable more than twice (up to smoothness)
Let us start by deﬁning some new notation: for any function F(λ) : R>0 →R and any
integer k ∈Z≥0, let us use the short-hand notation
lk
λ[F] := lim
λ→0+
dkF(λ)
dλk
.
If limλ→0+ dkF(λ)
dλk
exists and is ﬁnite, then lk
λ[F] is a functional (which simply yields a ﬁnite
real number) and F(λ) is of diﬀerentiability class Ck as λ →0+. Similarly for a function
G(a) : R>0 →R, we write
lk
a[G] := lim
a→0+
dkG(a)
dak
.
Let us now make the observation that since our metric is
g = −2 dλ dv + a(λ)2dv2 + a(λ)2r(v, λ)2dΩ2 ,
(3.30)
where r(v, λ) = v −η(λ), the metric is Ck extendible as λ →0+ if and only if lr

exist and are ﬁnite for all r ∈{0, . . . , k}. In the above, [∂λ∂v]r schematically means any
combination of partial derivatives with respect to λ and/or v of total order r.8
Let us
note that the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a2], lr
λ[a2η], and lr
λ[a2η2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k}
is equivalent to that of (3.31) by repeated use of Clairaut’s theorem on equality of mixed
partial derivatives, noting that ∂v(a2v2) = 2a2v, ∂2
v(a2v2) = 2a2, ∂v(a2ηv) = a2η, and any
other v derivatives vanish. We recall here that the limit λ →0+ should always be taken
at ﬁxed v. Therefore, the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a2], lr
λ[a2η], and lr
λ[a2η2] for all
r ∈{0, . . . , k} is equivalent to the metric (3.30) being Ck extendible as λ →0+. This
brings us to the following results:
Lemma 3.10. The existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[aη] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k} is
equivalent to the metric given in (3.30) being Ck extendible as λ →0+.
The proof is given in Appendix A.9
Next, we note that for C2 extendiblity, the existence and ﬁniteness of l0
λ[a], l0
λ[aη], and
l0
λ[ ˙H/a2] implied the existence and ﬁniteness of l2
λ[a] and l2
λ[aη] since ∂2
λa = a( ˙H/a2) and
∂2
λ(aη) = (aη)( ˙H/a2). As we see below, one can generalize this relation to arbitrary higher
derivatives.
Lemma 3.11. This lemma consists of two similar (but independent) statements:
(a) the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies the
existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[a] and lk
λ[a];
(b) the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[aη] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies
the existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[aη] and lk
λ[aη].
The proofs are given in Appendix A.
Corollary 3.12. The existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a], lr
λ[aη], and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈
{0, . . . , k −2} implies the metric (3.30) is Ck extendible as λ →0+.
Proof. From Lemma 3.11, we get the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[aη] for all
r ∈{0, . . . , k}, hence from Lemma 3.10 the metric (3.30) is Ck extendible as λ →0+.
For applications, it will turn out to be useful to relate λ-derivatives of ˙H/a2 with a-
derivatives of ˙H/a2 in the limit as λ →0+. Of course, a-derivatives only make sense if
we can express ˙H/a2 as a function of a. This will hold if a and λ are invertible on some
interval (0, λL), which will hold, for example, if ˙a(t) > 0 on some interval (−∞, tL) —
this is certainly achieved for a 2b inﬂationary universe satisfying (2.3). In the following
statements, whenever we make a claim about an a-derivative, we are implicitly assuming
that this invertibility assumption holds.

Lemma 3.13. The existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
a[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}
implies the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}.
The proof is given in Appendix A.
Corollary 3.14. The existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a], lr
λ[aη], and lr
a[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈
{0, . . . , k −2} implies the metric (3.30) is Ck extendible as λ →0+.
Proof. From Lemma 3.13, we get the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a], lr
λ[aη], and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2]
for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}, hence from Corollary 3.12 the metric (3.30) is Ck extendible as
λ →0+.
Gathering the above allows us to prove our main result:
Theorem 3.15. If the metric (3.30) is Ck−2 extendible as λ →0+ and if lr
a[ ˙H/a2] exists
and is ﬁnite for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}, then the metric (3.30) is Ck extendible as λ →0+.
Proof. By the hypothesis, Lemma 3.10 tells us that lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[aη] exist and are ﬁnite for
all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}. Thus, we can apply Corollary 3.14, which completes the proof.
Remarks and examples.
We see from this theorem that for the metric to be smoothly
extendible, one needs ˙H/a2 seen as function of a to be smooth as a →0+. (This proves a
result stated without proper proof in the appendix of [27].) This is the case, for instance,
if ˙H ∝aq for q ∈Z≥2 or if ˙H = PN
q=2 cqaq for some coeﬃcients cq ∈R, q from 2 up to
N ∈Z≥2 ∪{∞}. In the former case, there is a unique solution to when ˙H = −baq for some
proportionality constant b ∈R>0: demanding H = ˙a/a →h as t →−∞, it is of the form
a(t) =
h2q
2b sech2
hq
2 (t −t0)
1/q
,
t0 ∈R .
(3.32)
Letting b = 2q, h = 1, and t0 = 0 for illustrative purposes, the asymptotic expansion of the
above is
a(t) t→−∞
=
et −2
q e(1+q)t + 2 + q
q2 e(1+2q)t + . . . .
Recall here q ∈Z≥2, so the above is asymptotically a(t) t→−∞
=
et + O(e3t).
Another interesting class of examples is
a(t) = et + ent ,
n ∈R≥3 .
(3.33)
We will show C∞extendibility for n = 3.10 When n = 3, one can analytically invert the
scale factor in such a case, yielding

∆(a) := 9a +

10More generally, we conjecture that Ck extendibility follows if n ∈R≥k+1 or if n ∈{3, 4, . . . , k}. Cor-
respondingly, C∞would follow if n ∈Z≥3. We checked several cases that support these conjectures, but a
general proof, though achievable, is beyond the scope of this work (and also somewhat tangential).

which is a smooth function of a as a →0+. One way to see this is to notice the series
expansion as a →0+ is
˙H
a2 = 4 −16a2 + 72a4 −352a6 + 1820a8 −9792a10 + . . . ,
hence ˙H/a2, as a function of a, is real analytic in an open neighborhood about a = 0+;
consequently, it is smooth in that neighborhood.
More examples, including a realization of slow-roll inﬂation with a scalar ﬁeld, can be
found in Appendix B.

Comments on curvature singularities
To end this section, we discuss the relationship of a C2 extension with curvature singular-
ities. Let (M, g) be a C2 spacetime. We shall call a scalar curvature invariant S a scalar
function on M that is a polynomial in the components of the metric gµν, its inverse gµν, and
the (Riemann) curvature tensor Rµναβ. Common scalar curvature invariants include the
scalar curvature R = gµνRµν = gµνgαβRαµβν to linear order in curvature and, to quadratic
order in curvature, the Kretschmann scalar K := RµναβRµναβ, the contraction of the Ricci
tensor with itself RµνRµν, and the Gauss-Bonnet invariant G := R2 −4RµνRµν + K. To
any order in curvature, there is always a ﬁnite number of linearly independent polynomials
that can be written down due to the ﬁnite number of contractions of the Riemann tensor
(further constrained by its symmetries); see, e.g., [65, 66] to cubic order. The following
theorem demonstrates the lack of curvature singularities on approach towards the λ = 0
hypersurface (i.e., the past boundary) for those spacetimes that admit C2 extensions.
Theorem 3.16. Suppose (M, g), deﬁned as in the premise of Theorem 3.8, admits a C2
extension through the λ = 0 hypersurface. (This is achieved, e.g., if we assume the hypothe-
ses of part (b) of Theorem 3.8 or Corollary 3.9.) If S is a scalar curvature invariant on
M, then S extends continuously to the λ = 0 hypersurface.
Proof. The curvature tensor Rµναβ is a ﬁnite sum of terms involving the metric gµν, the
inverse metric gµν, and their ﬁrst and second derivatives. Taking derivatives of gµαgαν =
δν
µ, it follows that the inverse metric is as regular as the metric.
Therefore, by the C2
extendibility of the metric, each of the terms appearing in any curvature invariant S extends
continuously to the λ = 0 hypersurface.
Remark. When the previous theorem is realized, one usually says that the resulting space-
time is non-singular in the sense that it has no scalar curvature singularity.
Theorem 3.16 may be stronger than necessary though. Indeed, as mentioned in Section
2.3, the fact that there is no scalar curvature singularity may already be implied by the
past-asymptotically dS nature of the C2 extendible spacetime. In fact, we claim that any
27

past-asymptotically dS spacetime (in the sense of Deﬁnition 2.5) is free of scalar curvature
singularities. To be more precise, we assert that, to any order in curvature (say order n),
any scalar curvature invariant will be a polynomial in H2 and ˙H of the same order, i.e.,
it will consist of a linear combination of {H2n, H2(n−1) ˙H, . . . , H2 ˙Hn−1, ˙Hn}. The reason
for this is that any scalar curvature invariant of order O(curvaturen) is schematically of
the form g−nRiemn. Then, we can make the observation in FLRW spacetime coordinates
(and Cartesian spatial coordinates i, j ∈{x, y, z}) that the non-vanishing contractions in-
volve the components Rjiji = a2H2 and Rtiti = a2(H2 + ˙H) of the Riemann tensor (no
summation implied) contracted with gii = 1/a2 and the components Ritit = H2 + ˙H of the
Riemann tensor contracted with gtt = −1. Thus, a scalar polynomial (which is coordinate
independent) can only consist of the terms H2 and ˙H raised to the appropriate order. We
can see this explicitly for linear and quadratic invariants [recall (2.8)], and to give a couple
of examples to cubic order, we have RµνRνρRρµ = 108H6 + 162H4 ˙H + 108H2 ˙H2 + 30 ˙H3
and RµναβRαβγσRγσµν = 48H6 + 72H4 ˙H + 72H2 ˙H2 + 24 ˙H3.
Any past-asymptotically dS spacetime thus seems to be free of any scalar curvature
singularity (as for exact dS). However, as we have encountered throughout this section,
a past-asymptotically dS spacetime is not necessarily extendible (within the (λ, v) coordi-
nates); conditions for (C0, C1, C2, etc.) extendibility may be stronger than those deﬁning
past-asymptotically dS. Therefore, we may wonder what goes wrong for those spacetimes
that might be (C0, C1, C2, etc.) inextendibile, yet free of scalar curvature singularities.
For Ck (in)extendibility, k ≥2, we can provide some explanation. Recalling part (b)
of Theorem 3.8 for C2 extendibility, if the quantity
˙H/a2 convergences toward the past
boundary, then C2 extendibility is achievable. If the quantity ˙H/a2 diverges, then we do
not know whether a C2 extension exists within the (λ, v) coordinates. What we can show,
though, is that the spacetime possesses a null parallelly propagated curvature singularity
on the past boundary. Indeed, it is straightforward to verify that some components of the
curvature tensor in the (λ, v) coordinates will involve the quantity ˙H/a2 and hence diverge.
For instance, the λλ component of the Ricci tensor is Rλλ = −2 ˙H/a2. Since the divergence
of the curvature tensor is speciﬁc to this coordinate system, this is not a scalar curvature
singularity, but bears the aforementioned name often abbreviated p. p. singularity.11 To be
precise, one must ﬁnd a tetrad basis {EM} that is parallelly propagated along null geodesics,
that is for which the covariant derivative along the tangent vector K to the null geodesics
vanishes: ∇KEM = Kµ∇µEM = 0. Diﬀerent bases can be constructed [27,29], but they all
share the property that ˙H/a2 appears in the components of the Ricci tensor in the given
basis. For instance, the null parallelly propagated basis constructed in [29] can be written
in terms of our coordinates as E0 = dv/
√
2, E1 = (2dλ −a2dv)/
√
2, E2 = ar dθ, E3 =
ar sin θ dφ, and in that parallelly propagated basis12 one ﬁnds R11 = −˙H/a2. Whenever
this is divergent, we can say that there is a p. p. curvature singularity.
One may say that a p. p. singularity is weaker than a scalar curvature singularity, but it
may nevertheless be physically relevant. In fact, the relation between p. p. singularities and
spacetime extendibility was the crux of the work by Clarke [33,36,37], which was applied
11The discussion is generalizable to Ck extendibility, k ≥2, recalling Corollary 3.12. In this case, the
relevant quantity is dk−2( ˙H/a2)/dλk−2, and this enters in the components of the (k−2)th covariant derivative
of the curvature tensor in (λ, v) coordinates. See the appendix of [27] for more details.
12At ﬁxed v, θ, and φ, this makes it clear that it is the λ components that matter along null geodesics.
28

in cosmology in [27–32]. For instance, the approach of [27] was precisely to evaluate the
curvature tensor in a null parallelly propagated basis within a ﬂat FLRW spacetime and
ﬁnding the criterion that determined the presence/absence of a p. p. curvature singularity.
The result showed that the quantity ˙H/a2 had to converge for the spacetime to be free of
p. p. singularities and for there to be no obstruction to spacetime extendibility. We thus see
that this approach and ours yield consistent results — they certainly are complementary.

Conformal embeddings into the Einstein static universe
It is well known that the ﬂat de Sitter model conformally embeds into the Einstein static
universe [67–69]. In this section, we show that the past-asymptotically de Sitter models also
conformally embed into the Einstein static universe and retain similar geometrical proper-
ties. These properties will be used in the subsequent section to go beyond the symmetries
of FLRW, i.e., beyond exact homogeneity and isotropy.
First, we give the deﬁnition of a conformal extension. Deﬁnitions 4.1 and 4.2 parallel
Deﬁnitions 3.1 and 3.2 in Section 3.1.
Deﬁnition 4.1. Suppose (M, g) is a C∞spacetime and (f
M, eg) is a Ck spacetime. We say
that (f
M, eg) is a Ck conformal extension of (M, g) if there is an embedding M ,→f
M and a
Ck function Ω: M →[0, ∞) (M is deﬁned below) such that
(i) M ⊂f
M is a proper open subset,
(ii) the restriction Ω|M is smooth and positive,
(iii) ∂0M ̸= ∅where ∂0M := {p ∈∂M | Ω(p) = 0},
(iv) the pull back of eg under the embedding equals Ω2g.
In this setting, we refer to M ,→f
M as a Ck conformal embedding.
A couple of comments: (1) as in Section 3.1, we are identifying M with its image under
the embedding; (2) M denotes the closure of M within f
M, and likewise, ∂M denotes the
topological boundary of M within f
M, hence M = M ∪∂M.
Deﬁnition 4.2. Let (f
M, eg) be a Ck conformal extension of a C∞spacetime (M, g). A
future-directed eg-timelike curve γ : [a, b] →f
M is called a future-terminating timelike curve
for a point p ∈∂M provided γ(b) = p and γ
 [a, b)

⊂M. Past-terminating timelike curves
are deﬁned time-dually. The future and past conformal boundaries of M within f
M are
deﬁned as
∂+
0 M = {p ∈∂0M | there is a future-terminating timelike curve for p} ,
∂−
0 M = {p ∈∂0M | there is a past-terminating timelike curve for p} .
The future and past boundaries of M within f
M are deﬁned as
∂+M = {p ∈∂M \ ∂0M | there is a future-terminating timelike curve for p} ,
∂−M = {p ∈∂M \ ∂0M | there is a past-terminating timelike curve for p} .
29

Remark. The deﬁnition of future and past boundaries of M within f
M (Deﬁnition 4.2) is
similar to the deﬁnition of future and past boundaries of M within Mext (Deﬁnition 3.2)
where (Mext, gext) is a continuous extension of (M, g). While they are in general diﬀerent,
there may be cases where they coincide as we will see in Corollary 4.5. (Coincide here
means that one can ﬁnd the same terminating timelike curve in M for the two boundary
points.) Under some mild regularity assumptions along with global hyperbolicty of (M, g),
there will be a local isometry up to the boundary between such points [70].
4.1
Review of the conformal embedding of the ﬂat de Sitter model into
the Einstein static universe
The Einstein static universe is the spacetime (f
M, eg) given by
f
M = R × S3
and
eg = −(dT ′)2 + hS3 ,
where hS3 is the usual round metric on the unit 3-sphere and T ′ is the coordinate on R.
(The choice of T ′ instead of T is so that our notation is consistent with below.) In this
subsection, we review how the ﬂat de Sitter comformally embeds into the Einstein static
universe. Let ( ˆ
M, ˆg) denote the ﬂat de Sitter model, i.e.,
ˆ
M = R × R3
and
ˆg = −dˆt 2 + e2hˆthE ,
where hE is the Euclidean metric as before; if (r, θ, φ) denote the usual spherical coordinates,
then hE = dr2 + r2(dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2). Moreover, we denote the de Sitter Hubble constant
by h ∈R>0.
We introduce new coordinates (T, χ, θ, φ) for ( ˆ
M, ˆg) via
ehˆt = sinh(hT) + cosh(hT) cos χ ,
(4.34a)
hrehˆt = cosh(hT) sin χ ,
(4.34b)
θ and φ are unchanged.
The Jacobian between (ˆt, r, θ, φ) and (T, χ, θ, φ) is nonzero, so the latter are well-deﬁned
coordinates. The metric ˆg in (T, χ, θ, φ) coordinates is
ˆg = −dT 2 + cosh2(hT)
h2

dχ2 + sin2 χ (dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2)

.
The term in square brackets is the round metric on S3. The coordinates (θ, φ) are the
usual coordinates on S2 and hence their ranges are the usual ones. Now we determine the
ranges of T and χ. Squaring equations (4.34a) and (4.34b) and summing them, we obtain
sinh(hT) = 1
2h2r2ehˆt + sinh
 hˆt

. Therefore the range of T is R. Plugging this into (4.34a)
and substituting (4.34b), we ﬁnd tan χ = 2hr/(1 −h2r2 + e−2hˆt). Thus the range of χ is
(0, π). The (T, χ, θ, φ) coordinates are usually referred to as the closed de Sitter slicing —
or global de Sitter — in the literature.
Now we investigate the trajectories of the ﬂat de Sitter comoving observers within the
(T, χ, θ, φ) coordinates as ˆt →−∞.
Recall that a comoving observer in ﬂat de Sitter
30

coordinates is the timelike curve ˆt 7→(ˆt, x0, y0, z0) for some ﬁxed (x0, y0, z0). (From here on,
when we refer to comoving observers, we are referring to these observers.) Let r0 denote
the corresponding radial point. Since r0 is ﬁxed, the expression for sinh(hT) in the above
paragraph shows that T →−∞as ˆt →−∞along the comoving observer. Then (4.34b)
implies χ approaches either 0 or π. However, we can rule out χ approaching π from (4.34a).
Thus, we have established the following proposition which will play an important role in
things to come.
Proposition 4.3. T →−∞and χ →0 as ˆt →−∞along each comoving observer. Hence
all the comoving observers limit to the north pole (χ = 0) on S3 as ˆt →−∞.
Deﬁne a new coordinate T ′ via T ′ = 2 arctan
 ehT 
−π/2 so that cosh(hT) = sec T ′.
Hence T ′ maps R diﬀeomorphically onto (−π
2 , π
2 ). From (4.34a) and (4.34b), the relationship
between (ˆt, r, θ, φ) and (T ′, χ, θ, φ) is
ehˆt = sin T ′ + cos χ
cos T ′
,
(4.35a)
hr =
sin χ
sin T ′ + cos χ ,
(4.35b)
while θ and φ are unchanged. Writing the metric in (T ′, χ, θ, φ) coordinates, we readily see
that the metric is conformal to the Einstein static universe:
ˆg =
1
h2 cos2 T ′
 −(dT ′)2 + dχ2 + sin2 χ (dθ2 + sin2 θ dφ2)

.
(4.36)
The values that (T ′, χ) on M assume are restricted as we explain now.
Since T ′ ∈
(−π
2 , π
2 ), from (4.35a), we have sin T ′ + cos χ > 0. Hence cos
 T ′ −π
2

> cos(χ −π). Since
cosine is strictly increasing on the interval (−π, 0), we have T ′ > χ−π
2 . In view of Deﬁnition
4.1, the following properties are now readily established.
Properties of the conformal embedding ˆ

(1) The Einstein static universe (f

M corresponds to the set of points {(T ′, χ) ∈(−π

(3) The topological boundary is given by the disjoint union ∂ˆ
M = {O} ⊔B−⊔Σ+. Here
O is the point that corresponds to the the north pole (i.e., χ = 0) at T ′ = −π
2 . Also,
B−= {(T ′, χ) ∈(−π
2 , π
2 ) × (0, π) | T ′ = χ −π
2 } is the past null boundary of ﬂat de
Sitter, and Σ+ = {T ′ = π
2 and 0 ≤χ ≤π} is the future spacelike boundary. In what
follows, it shall be useful to also deﬁne P, the point at T ′ = π
2 that corresponds to
the south poles (i.e., χ = π).
(4) The conformal factor Ωis given by h cos T ′ restricted to the closure of ˆ

i.e., restricted to ˆ
M ∪∂ˆ

Conformal embeddings of quasi-de Sitter spacetimes into the Einstein
static universe
In this section, we show many of the geometrical properties of the previous section hold for
spacetimes that approach de Sitter in the asymptotic past. Speciﬁcally, we have in mind
working under the same premise as at the beginning of Section 3.3. As before, we ﬁx a ﬂat
FLRW spacetime (M, g) given by M = (−∞, tmax) × R3 and g = −dt2 + a(t)2hE where a(t)
is a smooth positive function on (−∞, tmax). We seek functions ω(t) > 0 and ˆt(t) such that

Remarks. The function ω(t) is positive for all t ∈(−∞, t0). Moreover, ω(t) ↘0 as t →t−

Recall we are using O to denote the point at the north pole (χ = 0) at T ′ = −π/2
within the Einstein static universe (f
M, eg).
Proposition 4.4. Fix any t0 ∈(−∞, tmax). Deﬁne Mt0 ⊂M via Mt0 = (−∞, t0) × R3.
Suppose the hypothesis of Lemma 3.4 is respected, i.e., either a(t) = eht+o(eht) or H(t) →h
as t →−∞for some positive ﬁnite number h ∈R>0.
Then there is a C0 conformal

Proof. Let ω(t) and ˆt(t) be given by (4.40) and (4.42). Recall a(t) ↘0 as t →−∞. From
(4.41) and the result of Lemma 3.4 (which says that aη →−1/h as t →−∞), we ﬁnd that
ω(t) →1 as t →−∞. Consequently, ˆt →−∞as t →−∞.
Let (T ′, χ, θ, φ) denote the coordinates for the Einstein static universe introduced in
Section 4.1. Recall that the ﬂat de Sitter model ( ˆ
M, ˆg) corresponds to the set of points
T ′ ∈(−π
2 , π
2 ) and χ ∈(0, π) such that T ′ > χ −π
2 .
From equation (4.35a), it follows
that the hypersurface ˆt = +∞corresponds to the hypersurface T ′ = π/2. Therefore, Mt0
corresponds to all of ˆ
M as in Figure 6.
From (4.38) and (4.36), we have

Since ω(t) is positive and limits to 1 as t →−∞, it follows that ˆt maps (−∞, t0) diﬀeomor-
phically onto (−∞, ∞), so it follows that Mt0 is diﬀeomorphic to ˆ
M. Therefore, the past
conformal properties of the conformal embedding Mt0 ,→f
M are inherited from the confor-
mal embedding ˆ
M ,→f
M from Section 4.1. That is, (b)–(e) hold for Mt0 since analogous
statements hold for ˆ
M. The only diﬀerence is that now the conformal factor is
Ω= h cos T ′
ω(t)

,
where we combined (4.35a) and (4.39b). Hence Ωvanishes when T ′ = ±π/2 and when ω(t)
is non-zero; this happens only for T ′ = −π/2, so at {O}, since ω →0 as T ′ →π/2 (i.e.,
as t →t−
0 or ˆt →∞). The only other situation where Ωcan vanish is when T ′ = π/2 and
χ = π, so at {P}, since then a(t) is non-zero, but sin T ′ + cos χ = 0. Since h ̸= 0, it follows
that Ωextends as a C0 function to the topological boundary ∂Mt0 within f
M; hence we can
only guarantee that we have a C0 conformal embedding.
From equation (4.43), we have
g =
ω(t)2
h2 cos2 T ′ eg .
Since ω(t) →1 as t →−∞, we have the following corollary.
Corollary 4.5. Suppose a(t) = eht+o(eht) or H(t) →h as t →−∞for some positive ﬁnite
number h ∈R>0. Consider the C0 conformal embedding Mt0 ,→f

a C0 extension of (M, g). The past boundary of M within Mext (Deﬁnition 3.2) coincides
with the past boundary of M within f
M (Deﬁnition 4.2). Each is denoted by ∂−M and
corresponds to the lightcone T ′ = χ −π
2 within Mext.

Remark. The only assumption appearing in Corollary 4.5 is that either a(t) = eht + o(eht)
or H(t) limits to a positive ﬁnite number h as t →−∞. This is in agreement with the
C0-extendibility result from Section 3.3, which provided an alternative proof to why a(t) =
eht + o(eht) or H →h > 0 as t →−∞yields a C0 extension.
Note that the choices
of extension are clearly diﬀerent though: in Theorem 3.5, the extension was essentially
handpicked to be ﬂat spacetime (Minkowski); here the extension is closed (global) de Sitter.
Now we take a closer look at the comoving observers, i.e., the integral curves of u := ∂t.
In Proposition 4.4, we saw that all the comoving observers emanate from the north pole
(χ = 0) at T ′ = −π
2 . Note that the integral curves of u are parameterized by g-proper time.
Now consider the vector ﬁeld 1
Ωu on Mt0, where the integral curves of 1
Ωu are parameterized
by eg-proper time. Next we prove the following proposition.
Proposition 4.6. For each integral curve of 1
Ωu, the vector ﬁeld along said integral curve
extends continuously to ∂T ′ at O.
Remark. In other words, Proposition 4.6 says the following: let eγ : (0, b) →M be an integral
curve of 1
Ωu; hence it is parameterized by eg-proper time. From Proposition 4.4, we know
that eγ(s) →O as s →0+. Proposition 4.6 says that its tangent vector, eγ′(s), converges to
∂T ′ ∈TO f
M as s →0+ as well. And this is true for each comoving observer. In fact, this
behavior can be seen in Figure 6.
Proof. Using (4.35a) and (4.35b), the relationship between T ′ and χ of a comoving observer
at a ﬁxed r0 is given by
hr0(sin T ′ + cos χ) = sin χ .
(4.44)
Since T ′ is a time function for (f
M, eg), we can parameterize the curve for the comoving
observer via T ′. With this parameterization, the comoving observer t 7→(t, r0, θ0, φ0) with
respect to the (t, r, θ, φ) coordinates is given by T ′ 7→(T ′, χ(T ′), θ0, φ0) with respect to the
(T ′, χ, θ, φ) coordinates. Implicitly diﬀerentiating (4.44) with respect to T ′, one calculates
the derivative of χ(T ′):
dχ
dT ′ =
hr0 cos T ′
cos χ + hr0 sin χ .
We can relate hr0 cos T ′ to χ via (4.44). Substituting this relationship into the expression
for dχ/dT ′ gives a χ-parameterization of the curve for the comoving observer. To obtain
a eg-proper time paramterization, one normalizes the vector ﬁeld along the integral curve
with respect to eg. Doing this yields the following expression for the vector ﬁeld along the
integral curve of 1
Ωu at constant r0:
s
cos2 χ + 2hr0 sin χ + h2r2
0 sin2 χ
1 + 2hr0 sin χ(1 −cos χ)

s
h2r2
0 −sin2 χ + 2hr0 cos χ sin χ −h2r2
0 cos2 χ
1 + 2hr0 sin χ(1 −cos χ)
∂χ .
As χ →0+, the above vector ﬁeld along the integral curve approaches ∂T ′.
The next proposition and corollary will motivate an important hypothesis in Theorem
5.2.

Proposition 4.7. Within Mt0, the nonzero components of the g-Ricci tensor, Ricg, in the
(T ′, χ, θ, φ)-coordinates are determined by

and Ω2 Ricg(∂θ, ∂θ) = (3H2 + ˙H) sin2 χ = Ω2Ricg(∂φ, ∂φ)/ sin2 θ.
Proof. The proof is computational. We sketch the proof for the ﬁrst equality. The rest
are analogous. Set RT ′T ′ := Ricg(∂T ′, ∂T ′) and likewise with Rtt, etc. Recall that Rtt =
−3(H2+ ˙H), Rrr = a2(3H2+ ˙H), and Rtr = 0. Since Rtr = 0, the component transformation
law gives RT ′T ′ = Rtt( ∂t
∂T ′ )2 + Rrr( ∂r

˙H
a2 = ˙H cos2 T ′

We say that a function f : Mt0 →R extends continuously to Mt0 ∪{O} if there is a
continuous function ef : Mt0 ∪{O} →R such that the restriction of ef to Mt0 coincides with
f. The topology on Mt0 ∪{O} is just the subspace topology inherited from f
M.
Corollary 4.8. If H limits to a positive ﬁnite number and ˙H/a2 limits to a ﬁnite number
as t →−∞, then the (T ′, χ, θ, φ)-components of Ω2Ricg extend continuously to Mt0 ∪{O}.
Remark. The hypothesis “ ˙H/a2 limits to a ﬁnite number as t →−∞” was the hypothesis
used to obtain a C2 extension in Theorem 3.8.
Proof. Since H limits to a positive ﬁnite number, ω limits to unity (see the proof of Proposi-
tion 4.4). Therefore, from Proposition 4.7, it suﬃces to show that the function f : Mt0 →R
given by f = (1 + sin T ′ cos χ)/ cos T ′ extends continuously to Mt0 ∪{O}. Indeed, we will
show that the continuous extension is given by ef(O) = 0.
Recall that O corresponds to the point T ′ = −π
2 and χ = 0. Note that we can write
f = 1 + sin T ′
cos T ′
−(1 −cos χ) tan T ′ .
As T ′ →−π/2, one can show by l’Hˆopital’s rule that (1 + sin T ′)/ cos T ′, which is of the
form 0/0, limits to −cot(−π/2) = 0.
Regarding the second term in f above, we can
36

Taylor-expand tan T ′ about T ′ = −π/2 and cos χ about χ = 0, so for points near O, we
have
(1−cos χ) tan T ′ = −

Thus we are left with showing that χ2/(T ′ + π/2) extends continuously to Mt0 ∪{O} and
takes on the value 0 at O. This is indeed the case: since 0 < χ < (T ′ + π/2) within Mt0,
we have 0 < χ2/(T ′ + π/2) < χ within Mt0, which limits to 0 at O.

The cosmological constant appears as an initial condition
So far, we have been able to derive conditions on spacetime extendibility in past-eternal
quasi-de Sitter universes, which were restricted to the symmetry assumptions of homogene-
ity and isotropy (FLRW). While those results are fairly exhaustive and purely geometrical
— they do not depend on the physical input, i.e., they are independent of any gravita-
tional ﬁeld equations — they necessarily are of limited physical applicability as soon as one
departs from an exact FLRW background. This is particularly relevant since, within the
theory of inﬂationary cosmology as a proposed early universe scenario to generate the initial
conditions for structure formation, there has to be primordial quantum ﬂuctuations (hence
spacetime inhomogeneities). In this section, inspired by the consequences of the analysis
in Section 4, we will derive results that go beyond the isotropy and homogeneity assump-
tions of FLRW. In particular, in Theorem 5.2, we show that in some sense the cosmological
constant appears as an initial condition for spacetimes satisfying geometrical properties
described in the previous section. However, to do so we shall specify some physical input;
conservatively, let us apply the Einstein ﬁeld equations of classical general relativity.
5.1
The cosmological constant appears as an initial condition for past-
asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes
As shown in [71, Thm. 12.11], FLRW spacetimes satisfy the Einstein equations with a
perfect ﬂuid (u, ρ, p),
Ric −1
2Rg = 8πT = 8π
 (ρ + p)u∗⊗u∗+ pg

,
(5.45)
where u∗= g(u, ·) is the one-form metrically equivalent to the ﬂuid’s velocity vector ﬁeld
u = ∂t (in the comoving frame of the ﬂuid).
Note that we set Newton’s gravitational
constant to unity. We emphasize that for FLRW spacetimes, the (total) energy density ρ
and pressure p are purely geometrical quantities given by ρ =
1
8πG(u, u) and p =
1
8πG(e, e),
where e is any unit spacelike vector orthogonal to u (its choice does not matter by spatial
isotropy).14 Here G := Ric −1
2Rg is the Einstein tensor, which is related to the energy-
momentum tensor T via G = 8πT. To incorporate a positive cosmological constant Λ > 0,
14In the physics literature, it is more customary to deﬁne ρ = T(u, u) and p = T(e, e), but if the Einstein
equations G = 8πT hold, then the physical and geometrical deﬁnitions are equivalent. If gravity is modiﬁed,
then one has to be more careful as the deﬁnitions may deviate. In this paper, we work under the geometrical
deﬁnition.
37

we deﬁne Tm = T + Λ
8πg, so that the Einstein equations become
Ric −1
2Rg + Λg = 8πTm .
Setting ρm = Tm(u, u) and pm = Tm(e, e), we have
ρ = ρm + ρΛ
and
p = pm + pΛ ,
where ρΛ = Λ
8π and pΛ = −Λ
8π. Note that
pΛ = −ρΛ .
(5.46)
Equation (5.46) is the equation of state for a cosmological constant.
For a ﬂat (k = 0) FLRW spacetime, the Friedmann equations [71, Thm. 12.11] are given
by
8π
3 ρ(t) = H(t)2
and
−8πp(t) = 2¨a(t)
a(t) + H(t)2 .
(5.47)
These equations imply
˙H(t) = −4π
 ρ(t) + p(t)

.
(5.48)
Proposition 5.1. If a ﬂat FLRW spacetime as deﬁned in Section 2.1 is past-asymptotically
de Sitter (recall Deﬁnition 2.5), then ρ(t) and p(t) converge as t →−∞, and furthermore, if
ρ(−∞) and p(−∞) denote the limits of ρ(t) and p(t) as t →−∞, then p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞).
Conversely, if ρ(t) and p(t) converge as t →−∞in a ﬂat FLRW spacetime and if space
is expanding in that regime (i.e., if the Hubble parameter is positive in a neighborhood of
t = −∞), then the spacetime is past-asymptotically de Sitter and p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞).
Proof. For the ﬁrst part, suppose a ﬂat FLRW spacetime is past asymptotically de Sitter.
Since
˙H = ¨a/a −H2, it follows that ¨a(t)/a(t) converges as t →−∞. And clearly ρ(t)
converges from the ﬁrst Friedmann equation in (5.47). Thus p(t) converges as t →−∞as
well from the second Friedmann equation in (5.47). Then p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞) follows from
(5.48).
For the second part, suppose for a ﬂat FLRW spacetime ρ(t) and p(t) converge as
t →−∞. Then (5.47) and (5.48) imply both H and ˙H converge as t →−∞. If we denote
the limit of H as t →−∞by HΛ, then it must be that HΛ > 0 by the hypothesis. It
then also follows from Lemma 2.6 that
˙H(t) →0 as t →−∞. Therefore, spacetime is
past-asymptotically de Sitter and also p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞) according to (5.48).
Remarks. Given equation (5.46), we refer to p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞) as the cosmological constant
appearing as an initial condition. An implication of the above proposition is that all the
past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetime cases discussed in previous sections were equivalent
to having a cosmological constant as an initial condition. For instance, Corollary 3.6 could
now be restated as follows: if p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞), then the spacetime is C0 extendible. As
another example, if the hypotheses of the C2 extendibility Theorem 3.8(b) are respected,
then certainly it means that a cosmological constant appears as an initial condition for that
spacetime.
We generalize Proposition 5.1 in the next section (see Theorem 5.2).
38

5.2
Beyond homogeneity and isotropy
In this section, we generalize Proposition 5.1 to a nonhomogeneous setting.
We show
that the reason why the cosmological constant appears as an initial condition has to do
with the geometry of the conformal embedding in Proposition 4.4.
It is the fact that
the comoving observers all emanate from the origin point O (see Proposition 4.4) which
forces the cosmological constant to appear as an initial condition; it has nothing to do with
the symmetry assumptions appearing in ﬂat FLRW spacetimes. As such our theorem has
applications to inﬂationary scenarios in spacetimes that are not isotropic or homogeneous,
which we discuss in Section 5.3.
We set the stage for our theorem.
Let (M, g) be a smooth spacetime.
Let (f
M, eg)
be a C0 conformal extension of (M, g) with conformal factor Ω(Deﬁnition 4.1). Assume
M = I+
eg (O, f
M) ∩M for some point O ∈∂−
0 M. Let f : M →R be a smooth function. We
say f extends continuously to M ∪{O} if there is a continuous function ef : M ∪{O} →R
such that ef|M = f. In this case, we call ef the continuous extension of f to M ∪{O}.
The topology on M ∪{O} is the subspace topology inherited from f
M. In other words, ef is
continuous at O means that for each ε > 0 there is a neighborhood U ⊂f
M of O such that
| ef(O) −ef(x)| < ε for all x ∈U ∩(M ∪{O}).
Likewise, a smooth vector ﬁeld X on M extends continuously to M ∪{O} provided there
is a coordinate neighborhood U ⊂f
M of O with coordinates (x0, . . . , x3) such that each of
the components Xµ in X = Xµ∂µ extends continuously to (U ∩M) ∪{O}. If e
Xµ are the
continuous extensions of Xµ, then the continuous extension of X at O is simply the vector
e
Xµ(O)∂µ ∈TO f
M. A similar deﬁnition applies to smooth tensors on M by requiring each
of its components to extend continuously. (This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice
of coordinate system by the usual transformation law for tensor components.)
For example, the conformal metric Ω2g on M extends continuously to M ∪{O} by
deﬁnition. For another example, suppose T is a smooth tensor on f
M, then obviously the
restriction, T|M, extends continuously to M ∪{O} since it extends smoothly.
The following theorem generalizes Proposition 5.1. It is an analogue of [48, Thm. 2.2] for
the past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes we consider in this paper. The main diﬀerence
between [48, Thm. 2.2] and Theorem 5.2 is the use of a conformal boundary.
Theorem 5.2. Let (f
M, eg) be a C0 conformal extension of a smooth spacetime (M, g) with
conformal factor Ωsuch that M = I+
eg
 O, M ∪{O}

for some point O ∈∂−
0 M. We make
the following assumptions:
(a) (M, g) solves the Einstein equations with a perfect ﬂuid (u, ρ, p) as described in (5.45).
(b) Each of the integral curves of u have past endpoint O within f
M. Moreover, the vector
ﬁeld along each integral curve of 1
Ωu extends continuously to a eg-timelike vector at O.
(c) The energy density ρ and pressure p extend continuously to M ∪{O}.
Moreover,
Ω2Ricg extends continuously to M ∪{O}, where Ricg is the Ricci tensor for (M, g).
(d) (f
M, eg) is strongly causal at O.
Then the continuous extensions of ρ and p satisfy ep = −eρ at O.
39

Before proving Theorem 5.2, we make some remarks.
Remarks.
- The conclusion of Theorem 5.2 is that ep(O) = −eρ(O). This generalizes Proposition
5.1, where we found p(−∞) = −ρ(−∞).
- Note that M = I+
eg
 O, M∪{O}

holds for Mt0 in Proposition 4.4. Likewise assumption
(b) in Theorem 5.2 holds for Mt0 as well. Assumption (b) means that if γ : [0, b] →
M ∪{O} is an integral curve of 1
Ωu on (0, b] with past endpoint γ(0) = O, then γ′(0)
is a future-directed eg-timelike vector and hence γ is a future-directed timelike curve
within f
M. Therefore Proposition 4.4 and Proposition 4.6 imply that assumption (b)
holds for Mt0. Using a more relaxed deﬁnition of timelike curves than the one we are
using in this paper, assumption (b) in Theorem 5.2 can be relaxed. For example, see
assumption (b) in [48, Thm. 2.2] and the remark after it.
- Regarding assumption (c), we saw in Proposition 5.1 that if H converges and
˙H
converges to zero, then ρ and p converge as t →−∞. From Corollary 4.8, we see that
Ω2Ric extends continuously to M ∪{O} provided H limits to a positive ﬁnite number
and ˙H/a2 limits to a ﬁnite number as t →−∞.
- Regarding assumption (d), recall that (f
M, eg) is strongly causal at O means that for
any neighborhood U of O there is a neighborhood V ⊂U of O such that for any
future-directed causal curve γ : [a, b] →f
M, if γ(a), γ(b) ∈V , then γ
 [a, b]

⊂U.
This assumption holds for any globally hyperbolic spacetime and hence holds for the
Einstein static universe appearing in Proposition 4.4.
Proof of Theorem 5.2.
The proof only requires some modiﬁcations to the proof of [48, Thm. 2.2]. However, for
completeness, we provide all the details.
Since (M, g) solves the Einstein equations with a perfect ﬂuid (u, ρ, p), the Einstein
tensor satisﬁes equation (5.45). Recall that u∗is the one-form which is g-metrically equiv-
alent to the vector ﬁeld u (i.e., in coordinates, u∗= gµνuµdxν, and recall gµνuµuν = −1).
Contracting this equation gives an expression for the scalar curvature Rg in terms of ρ and
p. Plugging this expression back into (5.45), we have
Ricg = 8π
 (ρ + p)u∗⊗u∗+ pg

+ 4π(ρ −3p)g .
Multiplying by Ω2 gives
Ω2Ricg = 8π
 (ρ + p)(Ωu∗) ⊗(Ωu∗) + pΩ2g

+ 4π(ρ −3p)Ω2g .
(5.49)
Seeking a contradiction, suppose ep(O) ̸= −eρ(O). Then there is a coordinate neighbor-
hood U ⊂f
M of O such that eρ + ep ̸= 0 for points in U ∩(M ∪{O}). Therefore, within this
set, we can solve for (Ωu∗) ⊗(Ωu∗) in the above equality, which yields
(Ωu∗) ⊗(Ωu∗) =
1
8πΩ2Ricg −1
2(ρ −p)Ω2g
ρ + p
.
40

Since eg = Ω2g, and since eg and Ω2Ricg extend continuously to M ∪{O}, it follows that the
right-hand side of the above equality extends continuously to M ∪{O}. Therefore so does
the left-hand side.
Let S denote the continuous extension of (Ωu∗) ⊗(Ωu∗) to M ∪{O}. Let (x0, . . . , x3)
denote the coordinates on U. Let Sµν = S(∂µ, ∂ν). Then Sµν = Ω2uµuν within U ∩M,
where uµ = gµνuν are the components of u∗. Deﬁne a one form α on M ∪{O} via α|M = Ωu∗
and the extension
αµ(O) =



+
p
Sµµ(O)
if Sµµ(O) ̸= 0 and Ωuµ > 0 near O ;
−
p
Sµµ(O)
if Sµµ(O) ̸= 0 and Ωuµ < 0 near O ;
0
if Sµµ(O) = 0 .
Then α is a continuous extension of Ωu∗to M ∪{O}. Now consider the vector ﬁeld X,
deﬁned on M ∪{O}, which is eg-metrically equivalent to the continuous extension of Ωu∗.
Using components via a coordinate system in M, it is easy to see that, within M, X is just
the vector ﬁeld 1
Ωu:
X = egαν(Ωgµνuµ)∂α = Ω−2gαν(Ωgµνuµ)∂α = Ω−1uα∂α .
Therefore X is a continuous extension of 1
Ωu to M ∪{O}.
Since g(u, u) = −1 (by deﬁnition of a perfect ﬂuid), continuity implies eg(X, X) = −1
at O.
Using [72, Lem. 2.9] and applying the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization process
appropriately, for any 0 < ε < 1, we can assume that the coordinates (x0, . . . , x3) on U
satisfy assumptions (1)–(6) below:
(1) ∂0|O = X|O,
(2) x0 is a time function on U,
(3) egµν(O) = ηµν and |egµν(x) −ηµν| < ε for all x ∈U where egµν = eg(∂µ, ∂ν).
Here ηµν are the usual components of the Minkowski metric with respect to the coordinates
(x0, . . . , x3), that is,
η = ηµνdxµdxν = −(dx0)2 + hE ,
where as before hE = δijdxidxj. By choosing U even smaller, similar arguments as in [72,
Lem. 2.9] show that we can also assume that
(4) ηε(Y, Y ) ≤0 =⇒eg(Y, Y ) < 0 for all nonzero Y ∈Tp f
M whenever p ∈U,
where ηε is the narrow Minkowskian metric on U given by
ηε = −1 −ε
1 + ε(dx0)2 + hE = η +
2ε
1 + ε(dx0)2 .
Moreover, since X is a continuous extension of 1
Ωu to M ∪{O}, we can also assume that
(5) |Xµ(x) −Xµ(O)| < ε
2 for all x ∈U ∩(M ∪{O}).
Lastly, if φ: U →R3+1 denotes the coordinate map [i.e., φ = (x0, . . . , x3)], then, by restrict-
ing the domain of φ, we can assume that
41

(6) φ(U) = B2r where B2r ⊂R3+1 is an open ball with radius 2r > 0 (as measured by
the Euclidean metric δ = δµνdxµdxν on U) centered at the origin: φ(O) = (0, 0, 0, 0).
Choose ε = 3
5. Then ηε has lightcones with ‘slope’ 2 in these coordinates. Consider the
curve c: [0, r] →B2r lying on this narrow lightcone deﬁned by c(s) = (s, s
2, 0, 0). By (4), the
curve φ−1◦c(s) is future-directed timelike. Let q = φ−1 c(r)

. Since M = I+
eg
 O, M ∪{O}

,
it follows that q ∈M.
Let γ : [0, b] →M ∪{O} denote the integral curve of
1
Ωu, i.e.,
γ′(t) = X|γ(t) on (0, b], with future endpoint γ(b) = q and past endpoint γ(0) = O. Note
that t is the eg-proper time of γ.
We can assume γ

this, note that strong causality implies that there is a neighborhood V ⊂U of O such that
if γ has endpoints in V , then the image of γ is contained in U. Let V ′ ⊂V denote a
neighborhood of O satisfying assumption (6) above. Then we work in V ′ to construct the
curve γ in exactly the same way as in the paragraph before this one. Then strong causality
implies that the image of γ is contained in U.
Since γ

⊂U it follows by (2) that we can reparameterize γ by x0. Let ¯γ : [0, r] →

Corollary 5.3. Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 5.2. Then the continuous extension of

Proof. The proof is analogous to [48, Cor. 2.5]. Essentially, it follows from “plugging in”
eρ(O) + ep(O) = 0 into (5.49). However, one needs to be careful to control (Ωu∗) ⊗(Ωu∗).

Applications to inﬂationary theory
The results in the previous section have applications to inﬂationary theory in a nonhomo-
geneous setting. We will show that the geometrical assumptions appearing in Theorem
5.2 will imply inﬂationary scenarios under favorable conditions. This section is analogous
to [48, Sec. 3], so we will be brief with the details.
Let M ,→f
M be a C0 conformal embedding satisfying the hypotheses of Theorem 5.2.
Set H =
1
3divg(u).
This H is a generalization of the Hubble parameter, H, in FLRW
spacetimes. (Recall u is the four-velocity of the perfect ﬂuid.) Following [73], we deﬁne
an average length scale a(t) along the ﬂow lines of u via ˙a/a = H, where a dot denotes a
derivative with respect to the proper time t of the ﬂow lines, i.e., generally ˙a := ∇ua. The
average length scale, a(t), is a generalization of the scale factor, a(t), for FLRW spacetimes.
The generalization of Friedmann’s second equation is the Raychaudhuri equation,
3¨a
a = −Ricg(u, u) + 2ω2 −2σ2 + divg ˙u ,
(5.51)
where ω and σ are the vorticity and shear scalars, respectively, and ˙u = ∇uu is the accel-
eration of the ﬂow. If u were hypersurface orthogonal (as in FLRW spacetimes), then we
would have ω = 0 and H would be the mean curvature of the corresponding spatial slices.
Also, if u were a geodesic vector ﬁeld (as in FLRW spacetimes), then the acceleration would
vanish and so would the divergence term (i.e., divg ˙u = 0).
From Corollary 5.3, it follows by continuity that for points in M that are suﬃciently
close to O, we have Ricg(u, u) ≈8πeρ(O)g(u, u) = −8πeρ(O). Plugging this into (5.51) and
not making the assumptions of hypersurface orthogonality and vanishing acceleration gives
3¨a
a ≈8πeρ(O) + 2ω2 −2σ2 + divg ˙u .
(5.52)
We thus see that if the shear is suﬃciently small and the divergence of the acceleration is
not too negative, so that
8πeρ(O) + 2ω2 ≳2σ2 −divg ˙u ,
(5.53)
then (5.52) yields an accelerated expansion, ¨a > 0, for points in M that are suﬃciently close
to O. This is a generalization of an inﬂationary era.
Let us discuss the potential sources on the right-hand side of (5.53). A consequence
of the spatial isotropy for FLRW spacetimes is that its shear vanishes: σ2 = 0. In fact,
the shear is zero for any ﬂow with uniform expansion. In this sense, assuming 2σ2 is small
in (5.53) can be thought of as an approximation to the spatial isotropy associated with
FLRW spacetimes. In other words, ignoring inhomogeneities, the background should be
closer to ﬂat FLRW than, e.g., Bianchi I for anisotropies and thus shear to be suﬃciently
small. Indeed, Bianchi I can be seen as an average FLRW background with the addition
of shear anisotropies, and the FLRW limit is precisely the one where the matter energy
density dominates over shear; see, e.g., [74] and references therein for such a discussion.
We see that the vorticity ω2 in (5.53) generally ‘helps’ successfully starting inﬂation. It
is a well-known fact that vorticity in fact generally mitigates spacetime singularities, but
the absence of evidence for vorticity in our universe today indicates that the presence of
vorticity in the very early universe is unlikely (see, e.g., [75]).
43

Finally, the divergence of the acceleration in (5.53) can be sourced by the presence of
(not necessarily linear) inhomogeneities. To see this, it is useful to express the divergence
of the acceleration as
divg ˙u = −⃗∇·
 ⃗∇p

= −c2
s


∇2δρ −1 + c2
s
p + ρ
⃗∇δρ
2

,
where ⃗∇and ∇2 denote the spatial derivative and Laplacian, respectively. The ﬁrst relation
above is straightforward to derive from the momentum conservation equation for a perfect
ﬂuid (see, e.g., [75]). In the second equality above, we are expressing the pressure and
energy density into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, i.e., p(t, ⃗x) = ¯p(t) + δp(t, ⃗x)
and ρ(t, ⃗x) = ¯ρ(t) + δρ(t, ⃗x), without necessarily assuming δp and δρ to be smaller than
their homogeneous parts.
In the last equality, we assume the inhomogeneous parts are
related by a spatially constant parameter as δp = c2
sδρ, which would hold if δp and δρ were
small linear perturbations — in this case the linearized Einstein equations would show that
δρ satisﬁes a modiﬁed wave equation, where cs can be interpretated as the ﬂuid’s sound
speed. Inhomogeneities are typically assumed to be much smaller than the homogeneous
background (to meet observational constraints), but without this assumption at early times,
the divergence of the acceleration above could be large15, especially since it involves 1/(p+ρ)
and p →−ρ at the origin. However, precisely because the equation of state approaches a
cosmological constant at the origin, one may expect inhomogeneities to also vanish in that
limit. Yet, Theorem 5.2 does not tell us anything about the limit of ⃗∇p and ⃗∇ρ — it would
require knowledge of the derivatives, i.e., a higher regularity result, which we do not have
at this point.

Conclusions

Summary
In this paper, we investigated diﬀerent aspects of initial spacetime singularities in the con-
text of inﬂationary cosmology.
In particular, in Sections 3 and 4, we obtained several
interesting conditions on spacetime extendibility in ﬂat past-eternal quasi-de Sitter uni-
verses where homogeneity and isotropy assumptions are valid (i.e., ﬂat FLRW spacetimes).
These results are fairly exhaustive and purely geometrical — they do not depend on the
physical input. While the central theme of our work focused on ﬂat FLRW spacetimes, in
Section 5 we derived, without the isotropy and homogeneity assumptions of FLRW, that
in some sense a cosmological constant appears as an initial condition. Here we provide a
detailed summary of our results.
Within ﬂat FLRW, we showed that if inﬂation were to be past eternal, i.e., if the universe
had been expanding at an accelerating rate from its inception, then the only situation that
might be free of scalar curvature singularities is when the universe extends to inﬁnite proper

so it would favor inﬂation in light of (5.53). The term proportional to ∇2δρ may oscillate though.

time in the past (Classiﬁcation 2b). When spatial sections reach zero size in ﬁnite proper
time in the past, a scalar curvature singularity is necessarily reached, whether the scale
factor is decelerating (Classiﬁcation 1a; see Theorem 2.1) or accelerating (Classiﬁcation
2a; see Proposition 2.3) initially.
The prototypical example of an inﬂationary universe
within Classiﬁcation 2b is the ﬂat foliation of de Sitter spacetime, where the scale factor
follows an exponential function of time, whence the Hubble rate reaches a constant. This
motivated us to consider situations that are close to de Sitter (quasi-de Sitter), or often
more speciﬁcally, ﬂat past-asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes according to our Deﬁnition
2.5. Such spacetimes are expected to be always free of scalar curvature singularities, but
whether they are extendible beyond the past boundary at t = −∞is one of the main
research questions of this work. This paper investigated low regularity extensions. If the
extended metric is C2 (or just C1,1), existence and uniqueness of geodesics emanating from
the past boundary into the original spacetime ensures geodesic incompleteness of that patch.
However, the geodesics extend beyond the boundary, and they could be complete in the
extended spacetime.
Building on the fact that ﬂat dS in FLRW coordinates can be extended beyond the past
boundary using diﬀerent coordinates [dubbed the (λ, v) coordinates], we derived suﬃcient
asymptotic conditions on the extendibility of quasi-de Sitter metrics within (λ, v) coordi-
nates. In particular, a(t) = eht + o(eht) or H →h as t →−∞for some h > 0 ensures con-
tinuous (C0) extendibility (see Theorem 3.5). For higher regularity, a(t) = eht + o(e(2+ε)ht)
and a(t) = heht + o(e(2+ε)ht) as t →−∞for some ε > 0, guarantees C1 extendibility,
while the convergence of ˙H/a2 yields C2 extendibility (see Theorem 3.8). Furthermore, we
discussed how these conditions can be generalized to Ck extendibility, k ∈Z≥3 ∪{∞}. In
particular, when the quantity ˙H/a2 can be reexpressed as a function of the scale factor,
smooth extensions follow if, for instance,
˙H/a2 is real analytic in a neighborhood of the
past boundary (see Theorem 3.15). An example includes a(t) = et + e3t.
Let us stress again at this point that the above results did not presuppose any gravita-
tional theory, i.e., no ﬁeld equations were ever solved, so the results were purely geometrical.
In fact, an alternative geometrical method was used to prove that past-asymptotically dS
spacetimes are continuously extendible, by showing that they could be conformally embed-
ded into the Einstein static universe. Indeed, a spacetime close enough to dS in the asymp-
totic past can be conformally embedded into the Einstein static universe just like exact dS,
and as such, their past conformal boundaries share similar geometrical and topological prop-
erties (see Proposition 4.4 and Corollary 4.5). A fundamental geometric property for these
spacetimes is that the comoving observers (i.e., the integral curves of u = ∂t in comoving
coordinates) all emanate from a single origin point O in the past conformal boundary.
As mentioned before, if one assumes that the Einstein ﬁeld equations are respected
with a perfect ﬂuid, then we were able to show a result that did not rely on the strong
symmetry assumptions of FLRW, i.e., it applied for metrics that may be inhomogeneous
and anisotropic. Speciﬁcally, the statement (Theorem 5.2) stipulated that if the spacetime
admits a conformal extension satisfying the fundamental geometric property alluded to in
the above paragraph, then the equation of state at the origin must be that of a cosmological
constant. Applications of Theorem 5.2 to inﬂationary theory in a nonhomogeneous setting
were discussed in Section 5.3.

6.2
Discussion and future directions
Although Theorem 5.2 is applicable to spacetimes which are not homogneeous, the only
examples of spacetimes that we are aware of which satisfy its hypotheses are past-
asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, i.e., ones that are already isotropic.
Therefore,
an important mathematical question is to ﬁnd examples of spacetimes satisfying the hy-
potheses of Theorem 5.2, which do not belong to the class of past-asymptotically de Sitter
spacetimes. The same question remains in the Milne-like case as well [48].
Physical insight can be gained by examining the contrapositive of Theorem 5.2: if the
‘initial’ equation of state at the origin is not that of a cosmological constant, then under the
premise at least one of the assumptions (a)–(d) must break down. If we enforce the Einstein
equations (more on this below), reasonable causality, and that the integral curves of u all
emanate from the origin, this leaves us with conditions pertaining to the extendibility of
physically meaningful (dimensionful) quantities such as the energy density, the pressure,
and the Ricci tensor.16
Consequently, a possible conclusion in such a case is that such
quantities diverge at the origin. While this is not an inextendibility result on its own, it
certainly suggests that any universe with a pointlike past conformal boundary other than
those ‘beginning’ with a cosmological constant might well be inextendible (at least in a
conformal sense). If this proves to be true, it may be interpreted from diﬀerent viewpoints:
if general relativity always holds and if inﬂation is fundamentally past eternal, then it either
means that a cosmological constant is ‘selected’ as the only viable initial condition (and thus
the spacetime is extendible), or it means that an initial singularity is truly unavoidable.
The latter possibility prevails from a dynamical point of view. Indeed, within general
relativity, the regime of small spatial volume and large spacetime curvature (and ultimately
the approach to a singularity) is generally expected to be highly anisotropic. This is known
as the Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) chaotic mixmaster approach to a singularity
[76–78]. In a similar fashion to why we may expect a cosmological constant to dominate at
late times (cf. the cosmic no-hair conjecture; see, e.g., [79–89]), we may expect exactly the
opposite at early times. Let us consider a Bianchi I metric in general relativity with a perfect
ﬂuid for instance. The Hamilton constraint equation implies that the average expansion
rate squared, H2, is proportional to the sum of the shear anisotropies, where σ2 ∝a−6, and
of the matter energy densities, where ρ ∝a−4, a−3, a0 for radiation, dust, and a cosmological
constant, respectively; a is the averaged scale factor. Therefore, while the energy density
of a cosmological constant dominates as a →∞, it is easily overtaken by other matter
components — and eventually anisotropies — as a ↘0. In fact, it might be that, from a
dynamical point of view (and within general relativity), the slightest perturbations preclude
the existence of realistic spacetimes satisfying the conditions of a ﬂat past-asymptotically
dS metric. In other words, inﬂation happening all the way to a ↘0 as t →−∞is quite
special, ‘inﬁnitely tuned’ in the sense that the energy density of any matter component
(i.e., the slightest perturbation) would become dominant (and ultimately blow up) over the
energy density of the inﬂaton (approximately constant as for a cosmological constant) in
that limit. As soon as these matter components dominate (standard matter in the sense

transformed Ricci tensor) that enters in the hypothesis of the theorem eludes us. This could be investigated
in future work.
46

that it respects the strong energy condition for instance), then we necessarily end up in Case
1a, with a decelerating pre-inﬂationary phase and an initial big bang-like scalar curvature
singularity.17
This can be interpreted as saying that inﬂation is unlikely to ‘start’ the
universe18; alternatively, it might mean that some fundamental principle needs to ‘select
inﬂation’ as the ‘initial condition’ (such as ﬁnite quantum amplitudes; see [103,104]).
It is worth noting that our analysis in this paper is at the level of classical gravity.
However, in the approach to a singularity, classical physics might break down due to large
quantum eﬀects, or at the very least from an eﬀective ﬁeld theory point of view, higher-
curvature terms can start becoming important. This is particularly relevant in the high-
curvature regime that might correspond to the past of inﬂation. Yet, most of our results
in Sections 2 to 4 solely relied on having a real, Lorentzian metrical theory of gravity, so
they are not limited to GR and could be readily applicable to eﬀective theories of gravity
with higher derivatives too. Even in Section 5, where we explicitly relied on the Einstein
ﬁeld equations, we may conjecture that the results could be generalized to theories with
higher curvature terms. For instance, if hypothesis (a) of Theorem 5.2 is replaced by the
ﬁeld equations of whatever higher-curvature theory (e.g., involving the Riemann tensor,
contractions thereof, and derivatives thereof, all raised to some higher powers), then as long
as the appropriate higher-curvature terms are assumed to be continuously (or potentially
smoothly) extendible in hypothesis (c), then we may conjecture the same result will follow,
namely ep(O) = −eρ(O). This is interesting since novel solutions exist in higher-curvature
theories. For instance, in quadratic gravity one can have solutions with constant Hubble
parameter H and constant shear σ2, so the solution is de Sitter-like, but anisotropic [105–
108], though such solutions are unlikely to be past dynamical attractors [105,109].
Certainly, the issues of extendibility, geodesic incompleteness, and spacetime singularity
change if the notion of spacetime continuum as we know it completely breaks down or,
perhaps less drastically, simply if it is no longer real and Lorentzian.19 For example, the
Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal is a well-known example of quantum prelude to inﬂa-
tion, in which the ‘pre-inﬂationary phase’ is conjectured to be Riemannian [120] (or at least,
the metric may have a complex transition from Riemannian to Lorentzian — see, e.g., [121]
and references therein for how such complex metrics might be theoretically constrained).
Nevertheless, classical physics is still relevant in the context of quantum cosmology: if we
imagine performing a semi-classical path integral of gravity (as a proxy for the unknown
theory of quantum gravity), the leading-order ‘tree-level’ contribution is often the classical
on-shell action, i.e., the action evaluated on classical solutions to the equations of motion.
Determining whether the classical solutions are past extendible or inextendible is therefore
17Assuming the Bousso bound on entropy [90] (which is motivated by holography and quantum gravity
[91]), a general (semi-classical) singularity theorem has been proved [92], from which the following corollary
follows: the slightest radiation added to global de Sitter suﬃciently far into the future or past results in a
null geodesically incomplete spacetime. As expected, the energy density in radiation will get to dominate
over the cosmological constant in the approach to the throat and disrupt the global de Sitter bounce.
18How likely it is that the universe becomes inﬂationary is somewhat of a related issue; see, e.g., [93,94]
for standard reviews, as well as some of the more recent developments from a numerical perspective [95–102]
or from a mathematical perspective [84–88].
19There still are singularity theorems within low-regularity geometry constructions of spacetime (see,
e.g., [110–119] and references therein), but it is currently unknown whether such geometries could ﬁnd
applications in quantum gravity.
47

crucial since the conclusions may depend signiﬁcantly on the nature of the classical solutions.
For instance, it was found in [103,104] that non-singular bouncing or cyclic universes that
are geodesically complete often have divergent classical on-shell actions (thus such solutions
would have to be disregarded from a quantum viewpoint), while geodesically incomplete
accelerating solutions emanating of an initial singularity in higher-curvature gravitational
theories have ﬁnite classical on-shell actions (thus they are well deﬁned).20 In this work,
we certainly conﬁrm that an accelerating scale factor that reaches 0 in ﬁnite time has an
initial scalar curvature singularity, but we have shown when it reaches 0 in inﬁnite time
some asymptotic conditions (e.g., corrections to eht) lead to extendible spacetimes. The
issue of quantum transition amplitudes in such universes could be an interesting follow-up
subject.
An aspect of our work that we have touched upon but have not explored in great detail
is the possible forms of the extensions when the spacetime is extendible. As we mentioned
several times, if the spacetime is extendible beyond its past boundary, the choice of exten-
sion is often not unique. As an example, the spacetime extension chosen in Theorem 3.5
(which applies, e.g., for the continuous extension of past-asymptotically de Sitter space-
times) corresponds to Minkowski; however, many diﬀerent choices could have been taken.
A Minkowski extension is also what we showed for the warm-up in exact de Sitter (Section
3.2). It is quite clear, though, that for exact de Sitter we could have taken the extended
metric and manifold to be copies of the original metric and manifold (so the extension is
a sort of spacetime ‘reﬂection’). The continuous extension would follow just as well, and
in fact, as already alluded to, the resulting extension would be the smooth extension cor-
responding to global de Sitter (this is shown in [27]). For quasi-de Sitter spacetimes that
admit extensions, we conjecture that a similar ‘reﬂected’ extension may work in general;
proving this and analyzing the geometrical and topological properties of the resulting ex-
tended spacetime could be the subject of a follow-up work. Such extensions might ﬁnd
physical applications to symmetric ‘mirror’ universes, such as in the works of [124–127].
Another physical aspect of the resulting ‘reﬂected’ global spacetime that would be interest-
ing to investigate is whether it would generally manifest a (non-singular) bounce, as closed
de Sitter does.

Lemma 3.11. This lemma consists of two similar (but independent) statements:
(a) the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies the
existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[a] and lk
λ[a];
(b) the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[aη] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies
the existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[aη] and lk
λ[aη].
Proof. Let us prove the statements separately:
(a) Recalling (3.29), the general Leibniz rule gives

Therefore, in the limit λ →0+,

r=0

r!(k −2 −r)!lk−2−r
λ
[a]lr

This relation shows that the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all
r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies the existence and ﬁniteness of lk
λ[a]. Then, in particular,
the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −3} implies the
existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[a].
(b) Recalling dη = a−1dt and dλ = a dt, we have
d(aη)

To arbitrary order k, the general Leibniz rule then gives

This relation shows that the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[aη] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all
r ∈{0, . . . , k −2} implies the existence and ﬁniteness of lk
λ[aη]. Then, in particular,
the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[aη] and lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −3} implies
the existence and ﬁniteness of lk−1
λ
[aη].
The following is a new lemma, absent in Section 3.4.2, but it is needed as an intermediate
step to subsequently show Lemma 3.13.
Lemma A.1. The λ- and a-derivatives of ˙H/a2, up to order k −2, are related as follows:
for k = 2, we trivially have ˙H/a2 as a function of λ equal to ˙H/a2 as a function of a; then
for any k ≥3,

(A.55)
where the functions H(k)
m
are non-negative-integer polynomials in H and its λ-derivatives
(up to order k −3). Speciﬁcally,
H(k)
1
= dk−3H
dλk−3 ,
H(k)
k−2 = Hk−2 ,
(A.56)
and, for m ∈{2, . . . , k −3} when k ≥5, there exists c(m,k)
n
∈Z≥0 such that
H(k)
m =

i=1
 ni ∈{0, . . . , k −2 −m} and
m

)
.
(A.58)
Remark. For our purposes, the exact form of the coeﬃcients c(m,k)
n
is not needed, but it
would be interesting to see if they exhibit a pattern.
Proof. The proof for k ≥3 goes by induction. For k = 3, we have

which is indeed the k = 3 case of (A.55)–(A.56).
Now, let us assume the lemma holds at order k −3, so we have

Lemma 3.13. The existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[a] and lr
a[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}
implies the existence and ﬁniteness of lr
λ[ ˙H/a2] for all r ∈{0, . . . , k −2}.
Proof. If k = 2, obviously l0
λ[ ˙H/a2] = l0
a[ ˙H/a2]. Then for k ≥3, taking the limit as λ →0+
(equivalently a →0+) of equation (A.55) in Lemma A.1, we ﬁnd

which completes the proof. Note, in particular, that the nis in the middle term range from
0 to at most k −3 according to (A.58). In going to the second line above, we used the fact
that, recalling da/dλ = (1/a)(da/dt) = H,
dm+1a
dλm+1 = dmH
dλm ,
which implies lm
λ [H] = lm+1
λ
[a].
We also used the knowledge that l0
λ[H] is a constant
(denoted h or HΛ previously), so l0
λ[Hk−2] = l0
λ[H]k−2 = hk−2 is just a constant as well.
B
More smoothly extendible examples
We provide more examples of smoothly extendible spacetimes, continuing the discussion
present at the end of Section 3.4.2.
An interesting class of examples is
a(t) =
1
e−t + ent = et −e(2+n)t + e(3+2n)t −e(4+3n)t + . . . ,
n ∈R≥1 .
(B.61)
Here again, we conjecture that Ck extendibility, k ≥2, follows if n ∈R≥k−1 or if n ∈
{1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , k −2}; C∞would thus follow if n ∈Z≥1. (A proof would be tedious, but the
conjecture has been checked to hold in many cases.) For the special case n = 1 (already
discussed in [27]), we can prove this explicitly since a direct computation shows that ˙H/a2
is constant.
Another example (which can be found in [31]) is
a(t) =
et
√
1 + e2t .
(B.62)
This can be analytically inverted to ﬁnd
t(a) = ln

a
√
1 −a2

,
˙H
a2 = −
2
1 + e2t = −2(1 −a2) .
This is a smooth function of a, so a smooth extension is possible in this case.
55

As a somewhat more physically motivated example, let us consider a proper ﬁeld theory
realization of inﬂation. An enormous number of examples could be explored, but let us
only revisit a particular case of small-ﬁeld inﬂation, for which [27] found the absence of
obstructions to C2 metric extendibility.
The potential of the scalar ﬁeld ϕ is given by
V (φ) = V0(1 −( ϕ
2m)2)2, where the ﬁeld asymptotically begins at the unstable point ϕ = 0
with no velocity and slowly rolls down the potential toward one of its minima. The slow-
roll solution was derived in [27] as a function of ϕ, but let us repeat it as a function of
t. Under the slow-roll approximation, the scalar ﬁeld’s velocity follows ˙ϕ ≃−1
3H
dV
dϕ , and
the Hubble parameter satisﬁes the constraint 3H2 ≃V (ϕ).
We are using units where
Newton’s gravitational constant is equal to 1/(8π) (or where the reduced Planck mass is set
to unity). The resulting equation, given the above potential, is ˙ϕ ≃(ϕ/m2)
p
V0/3, whose
solution is ϕ(t) ≃ϕe exp
q

for some integration constant ϕe. Then, upon solving
˙a(t)/a(t) ≃

V (ϕ(t))/3, we ﬁnd
a(t) ≃ae exp

−ϕ2
e
8 exp

for some integration constant ae. As t →−∞, this is not asymptotically equal to eht+o(eht),
but it does respect H →
p
V0/3, so this is C0 extendible. In fact, it is C2 (as shown in [27]).
Moreover, it can be shown to be C∞extendible: upon inverting the above scale factor, one
can compute ˙H/a2 and express it as a function of a as
˙H
a2 ≃
2V0
3m2a2 W(−x(a)2) ,
with x(a) = ϕe
2m
 a

and where W is the Lambert W function. Near a = 0+ asymptotically, the above can be
expanded as

Provided m < 1 (it must be so for the ﬁeld’s mass to be sub-Planckian), the above converges
as a ↘0, thus conﬁrming smoothness. However, as is discussed in Section 6.2, this example
is one of inﬁnitely tuned initial conditions for the ﬁeld to sit at ϕ = 0 asymptotically on
the unstable point of the potential. Therefore, it is an unlikely scenario from a dynamical
perspective. This is a well-known initial conditions problem in small-ﬁeld inﬂation [93,94],
but the comment applies more broadly as we argue in Section 6.2.
