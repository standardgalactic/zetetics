Stark Effect
This state exhibits strong correlations as for example a photon number measure-
ment in one mode determines the outcome of a photon number measurement in
the other mode. Two-mode squeezed states form the basic resource for  quan-
tum communication protocols such as quantum state teleportation. Various methods
for the generation of such states exist. A simple method consists of sending two
single mode squeezed states of the type described above onto the two inputs of a
beam-splitter making sure that one squeezed state exhibits squeezing along the x
quadrature while the other exhibits exactly the same degree of squeezing but along
the p quadrature. The output of the beam-splitter will then be a two-mode squeezed
state as in (3).
The distribution of two-mode squeezed states, and therefore entanglement, gen-
erally suffers from noise and the development of methods to combat the effects of
noise and to improve the squeezing and entanglement in such states is an active area
of research today [6,7].

Stark Effect
Klaus Hentschel
In late 1913 Johannes Stark (1874–1957), the professor of experimental physics
at the technical university of Aachen who would later champion the Aryan
physics movement, discovered the effect of electric ﬁelds on spectral lines. This

phenomenon is usually referred to as the Stark effect, though some Italian authors
prefer to call it ‘Stark-Lo Surdo effect’, because Antonio Lo Surdo (1880–1949)
independently also found this long-sought electric analogue to the magnetic  Zee-
man effect. Both discoverers worked with specially constructed discharge tubes.
Stark’s tube allowed stable electric ﬁelds of up to 100,000V cm−1. In numerous
experiments during the course of the next decade, Stark demonstrated the following:
• The spectrum lines in the Balmer series of hydrogen split up into several
components
• The number of these components increases with the series number
• Splitting and polarization of Balmer lines is symmetric to the original line
• The splitting seemed to be asymmetric for some other elements
• The distances between the hydrogen spectral-line components (in units of fre-
quency or wave-number) are all integer multiples of a smallest line distance
• The splitting interval  increases proportionally with the electric ﬁeld F
(i.e., ∼F for not too small or too large F)
• For very small electric ﬁelds and atoms not subject to a permanent dipole mo-
ment,  actually increases by the second power of F (‘quadratic Stark effect’)
• For very strong electric ﬁelds F ∼1,000,000V cm−1, the splitting is asymmet-
ric, as was found experimentally by two Japanese physicists in 1918 and derived
theoretically by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1921 (‘Stark effect of second order’)
Mathematical techniques from perturbation theory to make corrections for Kepler
ellipses induced by remote third masses were already well developed at the time.
Applying these techniques, Paul Sophus Epstein (1871–1939) in Munich (a mem-
ber of the  Sommerfeld School) and the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild
(1873–1916) in Potsdam succeeded independently of each other in incorporat-
ing this effect in the  atomic model of Niels Bohr (1885–1962) and Arnold
Sommerfeld (1868–1951).
In analogy to the  Zeeman effect, they interpreted the Stark effect as a splitting
of energy levels of initial and ﬁnal states, in this case induced by the external elec-
tric ﬁeld, i.e., as a vanishing of the degeneracy in normal hydrogen. Put intuitively,
eccentric orbits of the  electrons start to differ in energy from less eccentric or-
bits due to the external electric ﬁeld. The problem is described mathematically in
parabolic coordinates (ξ, η, ψ), with ψ as the angle off the z-axis which is parallel
to the external electric ﬁeld F.

ξ + 2x = ξ

η −2x = η
The main  quantum number n is then the sum of three quantum numbers nξ, nη,
nψ linked to the three degrees of freedom of the system. Because ψ is a cyclic
coordinate, nψ ⩾1, i.e., nψ = 0 is forbidden (analogous to the discussion of  ﬁne
structure). Intuitively put, this means that the electron has to revolve around the
z-axis).

Stark Effect
Thus the main quantum number n = nξ + nη + nψ = nξ + nη + m + 1,
with nψ = 1, 2, 3, . . . ⇔m = 0, 1, 2, . . . and m the so-called azimuthal quantum
number m = nψ −1. After elaborate calculations (cf. [1, Chap. 6, Sect. 2]), one
obtains for the energy of the orbit as a function of the quantum numbers and the
ﬁeld:
−E(n, nη, nξ, F) = 2π2μZ2e4
h2n2
+
3hF
8π2μZen(nη −nξ)
The ﬁrst expression on the right-hand side of the equation recovers the normal
Balmer term; the second term describes the energetic splitting ∼F and ∼n(nη–nξ).
After insertion of initial state (1) and ﬁnal state (2), the splitting ν of spectral lines
in terms of frequency results as
ν = 3h · F
8π2μZe[n2(nη −nξ)2 −n1(nη −nξ)1]
These formulas thus correctly describe  as proportional to the ﬁeld F, and sym-
metric to ν = 0, because for each allowed transition (nη, nξ, m)1, (nη, nξ, m)2,
there also exists an inverse transition. Additional  selection rules had to be set so
as not to get too many components: m = 0 or 1, with the additional constraint of
excluding m = 0 →m = 0 sufﬁcing to explain the observed number of compo-
nents and splitting patterns. The observed polarization of the m = ±1 components
also agreed well with what was expected classically for light emitted from moving
charges: circular polarization for observations vertical to the ﬁeld. The outcome
was a perfect  semi-classical model to explain the normal Stark effect for hydro-
gen and similar simple atoms. In 1920, Bohr’s assistant Henrik Anthony Kramers
(1894–1952) showed that Epstein’s and Schwarzschild’s approximation was only
good as long as the exterior electric ﬁelds were large compared with the relativis-
tic ﬁne structure of the unperturbed energy levels. For small F and atoms without
permanent dipole moment,  was proportional to the 2nd power of the electric
ﬁeld. This ‘quadratic Stark effect’ and a smooth transition from the quadratic to the
normal Stark effect for an increasingF were conﬁrmed experimentally by Rudolf
Ladenburg (1882–1952) in Breslau in 1924.
The Stark effect of second order was found by the two guest researchers at
the laboratory of the Mt. Wilson observatory, Toshio Takamine (1885–1959)
and Noboru Kokubu. Experimenting with an unusually high electric ﬁeld of
147,000V cm−1, they found an asymmetric shift of 0.8 ˚A of the middle com-
ponent towards the red instead of the normal symmetric splitting. Upon hearing
about their result from Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld used second-order perturbation
calculations to derive this asymmetric shift. This Stark effect of second order
was also responsible for the so-called pole effect, an asymmetric line broadening
well-known to spectroscopists (cf. [8,9], pp. 357–366). After the advent of quantum
mechanics, Erwin Schr¨odinger (1887–1961) was the ﬁrst to show that very sim-
ilar results could be derived for the Stark effect within this new framework. The
resulting formulas were virtually equivalent for the normal Stark effect, whereas
small deviations between the old semi-classical Sommerfeld formulas and the new

the splitting of the hydrogen Hδ line in an electric ﬁeld (observed vertically). From [3, p. 473]
quantum mechanical formulas existed for the second and third-order Stark effect.
By 1929 it had become clear that quantum mechanics yielded better agreement with
experimental precision measurements (see, e.g., [10]), even though it took much
longer for a perfect match between theory and experiment to be reached.

States in Quantum Mechanics
Leslie E. Ballentine
The most general meaning of the term state is a manner of existing, a combination
of attributes belonging to a thing (paraphrased from the Oxford English Dictionary).
In physics the term state has various, more speciﬁc meanings in thermodynamics,
in classical mechanics, and in quantum mechanics, but all include the notion that a
knowledge of the state is sufﬁcient to make predictions about the future behavior of
the system.
A pure state ( states, pure and mixed) is one that is speciﬁed or controlled as
precisely as possible. In classical mechanics a pure state is speciﬁed by a point in
phase space, i.e. by the values of all position and momentum variables. In quan-
tum mechanics a pure state is speciﬁed by a  wave function or state vector in
 Hilbert space. In both classical and quantum mechanics the motion of the state
is deterministic, in the sense that the speciﬁcation of the initial state determines a
mathematically unique trajectory of future states.
However, the dissimilarities between the classical and quantum pure states are
even more signiﬁcant. The speciﬁcation of the classical state uniquely determines
all observable properties of the system, as functions of the position and momentum
variables. But the connection between the quantum state and observation is only
probabilistic; the state vector does not determine the values of the  observables,
but only the probabilities of the various possible values. The same classical state
leads necessarily to the same observable events, but a new preparation of the same
quantum state may lead to quite different observable outcomes. Thus, even though
