Abstract
We evaluate one-loop amplitudes of N = 4 supergravity in D dimensions using the double-copy
procedure that expresses gravity integrands in terms of corresponding ones in Yang–Mills theory. We
organize the calculation in terms of a set of gauge-invariant tensors, allowing us to identify evanes-
cent contributions. Among the latter, we ﬁnd the matrix elements of supersymmetric completions
of curvature-squared operators. In addition, we ﬁnd that such evanescent terms and the U(1)-
anomalous contributions to one-loop N = 4 amplitudes are tightly intertwined. The appearance of
evanescent operators in N = 4 supergravity and their relation to anomalies raises the question of
their eﬀect on the known four-loop divergence in this theory. We provide bases of gauge-invariant
tensors and corresponding projectors useful for Yang–Mills theories as a by-product of our analysis.

INTRODUCTION AND REVIEW
Recent explicit calculations have shown that gravity theories still have perturbative se-
crets waiting to be revealed. We have learned a number of surprising lessons from these
calculations: results in gravity theories can be obtained directly from their Yang–Mills
counterparts via a double-copy procedure [1–4]; of a curious disconnect between the leading
two-loop divergence of graviton amplitudes [5, 6] and the corresponding renormalization-
scale dependence [7, 8]; and about the surprisingly tame ultraviolet behavior of certain
supergravity theories [9–12]. These lessons augur more surprises to come. In this paper
we investigate the role of evanescent eﬀects in the one-loop four-point amplitude of N = 4
supergravity, along with its relation to the U(1) anomaly in the duality symmetry of this
theory [13–15].
Evanescent eﬀects arise from operators whose matrix elements vanish when working
strictly in four dimensions, but give rise to nonvanishing contributions in dimensional regu-
larization. Such contributions originate from the cancellation of poles against small devia-
tions in the four-dimensional limit; that is, they are due to ǫ/ǫ eﬀects, where ǫ = (4−D)/2 is
the dimensional regulator. Although such eﬀects might at ﬁrst appear to be a mere techni-
cality, they turn out to play an important role [7] in understanding ultraviolet divergences of
Einstein gravity in the context of dimensional regularization [5, 6]. In particular, the Gauss–
Bonnet operator is evanescent and appears as a one-loop counterterm whose insertion at two
loops contaminates the ultraviolet divergence, but results in no physical consequences in the
renormalized amplitude. An important question therefore is whether a supersymmetric ver-
sion of the Gauss-Bonnet operator appears in the matrix elements of N = 4 supergravity. If
such an operator exists it would be important to determine its eﬀects on the known four-loop
divergence [16] of the theory.
On the other hand, the N = 4 supergravity theory has an anomaly in its U(1) duality
symmetry [13]. The anomaly manifests itself in the failure of certain helicity amplitudes
which vanish at tree level to persist in vanishing at loop level. In the context of dimensional
regularization these anomalous amplitudes arise from ǫ/ǫ eﬀects, in much the same way as
the usual chiral anomaly arises in the ’t Hooft–Veltman scheme [17]. Refs. [14, 16] have
suggested that the U(1) duality anomaly plays a key role in the four-loop divergence of the
theory [14, 16], although a detailed explanation is still lacking. In contrast to the anomaly
2

terms, it is unlikely that evanescent eﬀects can alter any physical quantity derived from
scattering amplitudes [7, 8]. Nevertheless, one may wonder if there any connections between
the two phenomena, given that both arise from ǫ/ǫ eﬀects.
In order to investigate these questions we compute the one-loop four-point amplitude of
N = 4 supergravity in arbitrary dimensions, using the double-copy procedure based on the
duality between color and kinematics [1, 18]. The corresponding helicity amplitudes were
previously calculated using various methods [19–21]. Here, we use formal polarizations in
order to study evanescent eﬀects, which are hidden when four-dimensional helicity states
are used. The conclusion of our study is two-fold: an evanescent contribution of the Gauss–
Bonnet type does appear in the pure-graviton amplitude of N = 4 supergravity; and its
eﬀects are indeed intertwined with the U(1) duality anomaly.
We argue that the main evanescent contributions to the amplitude correspond to the
supersymmetric generalization of the curvature-squared terms. Oﬀ-shell forms of curvature-
squared operators are known for N = 1 and N = 2 supergravity [22, 23]; but explicit forms
of a supersymmetric extension of the Gauss-Bonnet curvature-squared operator are not
known oﬀshell in N = 4 supergravity.1 Nonetheless their matrix elements can be computed
directly using standard amplitude methods, even without knowing their oﬀ-shell forms. In
contrast to the nonsupersymmetric case, the coeﬃcients of these matrix elements are ﬁnite.
This turns out to be a consequence of the same ǫ/ǫ cancellation that generates the anomaly.
As we will see, in the context of the double-copy construction there is a single object that
has matrix elements that contribute to both the anomaly and evanescent curvature-squared
terms.
The double-copy structure implies that we can write the one-loop four-point amplitude
of N = 4 supergravity in terms of pure-Yang–Mills theory building blocks, up to an overall
factor. We can therefore employ a set of gauge-invariant tensors written in terms of formal
gluon polarization vectors to carry out the calculation. We present the results in terms of
linearized ﬁeld strengths, which is natural for connecting to operators in a Lagrangian and
making manifest on-shell gauge invariance. In order to explore the evanescent properties
we also construct tensors with deﬁnite four-dimensional helicity properties. We provide the
tensors in a form natural for use in color-ordered Yang–Mills theory, as well as in a fully

crossing-symmetric form natural in N = 4 supergravity.
Similar gauge-invariant tensors
have recently been discussed by Boels and Medina [25].
In the Appendix we give details of the gauge-invariant tensors and describe the con-
struction of projectors for determining the coeﬃcient of the tensors in a given amplitude.
These projectors and tensors are useful not only for N = 4 supergravity but can be applied
to four-gluon amplitudes at any loop order in any Yang–Mills theory, including quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). Because of their more general usefulness we attach a Mathematica
ﬁle [26] that includes the two sets of tensors with diﬀerent symmetry properties, alongside
the corresponding projectors.
This paper is organized as follows.
In Sect. II we give the construction of the four-
loop four-point amplitude of N = 4 supergravity and describe the gauge-invariant tensors
in terms of which the amplitudes are constructed. In Sect. III we give the results for the one-
loop supergravity amplitudes. Then in Sect. IV we identify evanescent curvature-squared
terms in the amplitude. We show the connection of these terms to the U(1) anomaly in
Sect. V. We give our conclusions in Sect. VI. An appendix describing the gauge-invariant
tensors and projectors is included.

CONSTRUCTION OF THE ONE-LOOP AMPLITUDE
In this section we construct the one-loop four-point amplitude of N = 4 supergravity.
Details of the gauge-invariant tensors used for expressing the results are found in the ap-
pendix.
A.
Color-Kinematics Duality and the Double Copy
We apply the double-copy construction of gravity amplitudes based on the duality be-
tween color and kinematics [1, 18]. This has previously been discussed in some detail in
Ref. [21] for the one-loop amplitudes of N = 4 supergravity. In contrast to the earlier con-
struction, we use D-dimensional external states instead of four-dimensional ones, in order
to have access to evanescent eﬀects.
Amplitudes of half-maximal supergravity in D dimensions can be obtained through a
double copy, where one factor is derived from maximally supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory
4

(MSYM), and the other from pure Yang–Mills (YM) theory. In four dimensions, this gives us
amplitudes in N = 4 supergravity in terms of a product of N = 4 and pure Yang–Mills the-
ory. Alternatively, one may also construct N = 4 supergravity amplitudes using two copies
of N = 2 super-Yang–Mills (SYM) theory, as shown in Ref. [27]. This latter construction
is, however, more complicated, and furthermore includes unwanted matter multiplets. We
use the simpler construction.
The double-copy construction starts from the integrands of two Yang–Mills gauge-theory
amplitudes, written in terms of purely cubic diagrams. In a Feynman-diagram language,
four-point vertices can always be “blown up” into a product of three-point vertices, possibly
with the exchange of a ﬁctitious tensor ﬁeld. The representation of one-loop amplitudes is,
A1-loop
m

Z
dDp
(2π)D
X
j∈ICD

Sj
njcj
Q
αj p2
αj
,
(2.1)
where the sum runs over the independent cubic diagrams (ICD) labeled by j, while the
cj and nj are the color factors and kinematic numerators associated with each diagram.
The factor 1/Sj accounts for the usual diagram symmetry factors and the product over αj
runs over the Feynman propagators 1/p2
αj for diagram j. If the kinematic numerators can
be arranged to satisfy the same algebraic properties as adjoint representation color factors,
that is so that Jacobi relations hold,
ci + cj + ck = 0 ⇒ni + nj + nk = 0 ,
(2.2)
along with all anti-symmetry properties, then we can obtain gravity integrands and thence
amplitudes by replacing the color factors cj in Eq. (2.1) by the second Yang–Mills theory’s
kinematic numerators,
ci →˜ni .
(2.3)
We do this while keeping the original kinematic factors nj of the ﬁrst Yang–Mills theory. A
similar procedure holds for particles in the fundamental representation [28].
The one-loop four-point amplitude of N = 4 supergravity is easy to construct via the
double-copy construction, because the N = 4 MSYM numerators are especially simple [29].
The numerators of triangle and bubble diagrams vanish, and the box integrals illustrated in
Fig. 1 have kinematic numerators proportional to the tree amplitude,
n1234 = n1342 = n1423 = s tAtree
N =4(1, 2, 3, 4) ,

where we deﬁne the usual Mandelstam invariants,
s = (k1 + k2)2 ,
t = (k2 + k3)2 ,
u = (k1 + k3)2 .
(2.5)
These numerators trivially satisfy the dual Jacobi identities in Eq. (2.2). Thus, the N = 4
supergravity one-loop amplitude is

at one loop. The coupling is related to Newton’s constant via κ2 = 32πGN. An alternate
form of Eq. (2.6) is,

,
(2.10)
where A1-loop(1, 2, 3, 4) is the color-ordered one-loop amplitude of pure Yang–Mills theory.
The diﬀerence between Eqs. (2.6) and (2.10) cancels in the permutation sum. The second
form makes gauge invariance manifest, as the building blocks are gauge-invariant color-
ordered amplitudes. We use the form in Eq. (2.6) to evaluate the amplitude explicitly.

B.
Gauge-Invariant Building Blocks
The relatively simple double-copy structure of the one-loop four-point N = 4 supergravity
amplitude displayed in Eq. (2.10) makes manifest a factorization into the product of an
MSYM tree amplitude and a sum over the three distinct permutations of the one-loop color-
ordered amplitude of pure Yang–Mills theory. This suggests that we can obtain a convenient
organization of the supergravity amplitude by ﬁrst decomposing the Yang–Mills amplitudes
into gauge-invariant contributions. We do so using bases of local on-shell ‘gauge-invariant
tensors’.
By gauge-invariant tensors here we mean polynomials in (εi · εj), (ki · εj) and
(ki · kj) that vanish upon replacing εi by ki. These tensors are distinct only if they diﬀer
after imposing on-shell conditions. We can build such tensors by starting with tree-level
four-point scattering amplitudes for external gluons, for example, or with four-point matrix
elements of local gluonic operators, and then multiplying by appropriate factors of s, t, or
u to make the quantities local. Boels and Medina [25] have also recently constructed such
tensors.
In the Appendix we present two diﬀerent bases. In the ﬁrst, we impose deﬁnite cyclic
symmetry; this yields a basis natural for color-ordered Yang–Mills amplitudes. In the sec-
ond, we impose deﬁnite symmetry under crossing, making them natural for supergravity.
Associated with each gauge-invariant tensor is a projector built out of momenta and conju-
gate polarization vectors. When applied to an integrand, it yields the coeﬃcient of the given
tensor. Integrating the coeﬃcient then yields the coeﬃcient of the tensor in the amplitude.
This type of projection to a basis of gauge-invariant tensors has been used in Ref. [31]. We
stress that the ﬁrst of these bases is directly useful in gauge-theory calculations. We refer the
reader to the Appendix for more details about the bases, their properties, their construction
and the projection techniques. We also make these tensors and projectors available in a
ancillary Mathematica ﬁle [26].
We apply this projection technique to the integrand in Eq. (2.6). This reduces the numer-
ators to sums of products of inverse propagators and external kinematics. The integrand
is then expressed as a sum over tensors, with each coeﬃcient expressed in terms of the
scalar box and simpler triangle and bubble integrals that are easy to evaluate (via Feynman
parameterization, for example). The scalar box integral is taken from Ref. [32]. As a cross-
check we also evaluated the tensor integrals prior to applying the projectors, following the
7

methods of Refs. [33] that express every tensor integral in terms of Schwinger parameters.
These integrals are in turn expressed in terms of scalar integrals with shifted dimensions and
higher powers of propagators. We use FIRE5 [34] to reduce these integrals to elements of
the standard basis of scalar integrals. The integrals are then shifted back to four dimensions
using dimension-shifting formulas [33, 35]. Both methods yield identical results.
We introduce linearized ﬁeld strengths corresponding to each external particle,
Fi µν ≡ki µεi ν −ki νεi µ ,
(2.11)
in order to organize the results obtained from the projection technique. We express our
results using Lorentz-invariant combinations of these linearized ﬁeld strengths. For four-
point scattering in a parity-even theory, the only combinations at the lowest mass dimension
are [36],
(FiFjFkFl) ≡F µν
i Fj νρF ρσ
k Fl σµ ,
(2.12)
(FiFj)(FkFl) ≡F µν
i Fj µνF ρσ
k Fl ρσ .
(2.13)
These quantities are not symmetrized over the indices i, j, k, and l.
We need only one additional tensor for four-point scattering. This tensor can be expressed
as a linear combination of terms of the form D2F 4. It is, however, more convenient to express
this tensor as a matrix element with an insertion of an F 3 operator,
F 3 ≡1
3 Tr F µ
νF ν
ρF ρ
µ ,
(2.14)
where the trace is over color. The gauge-invariant tensor is given by
TF 3 ≡−istAtree
F 3 (1, 2, 3, 4) ,
(2.15)
using the four-point tree-level color-ordered amplitude with a single insertion of the operator
(2.14), as depicted in Fig. 2. As we see below, after applying the double-copy procedure,
this element of our basis is the one giving rise to the curvature-squared matrix elements, as
well as some of the anomalous ones.

familiar from the four-point one-loop type-I superstring amplitude. The rank-8 tensor t8
arises from the trace over the fermionic zero-modes (see for instance3 Ref. [37]). The com-
bination in Eq. (3.6) is crossing symmetric and is related to the Yang–Mills tree amplitude

physical region where s > 0 and t, u < 0 using ln(−s) →ln(s) −iπ.

The amplitude in Eq. (3.1) is ultraviolet-ﬁnite; the poles in ǫ in Eq. (3.1) are infrared ones.
We have carried out a number of checks of the amplitude. A simple check is that the
infrared singularity in Eq. (3.1) matches the known form [38],

N =4,SG(1, 2, 3, 4) ,
(3.9)
where the last step uses the Kawai–Lewellen–Tye (KLT) relation [39] between tree-level
gravity and Yang–Mills amplitudes. We have also compared the ﬁnite parts of all the am-
plitudes with external scalars and gravitons to the results in Ref. [14, 19, 21] and found
agreement. The remaining fermionic amplitudes are related by supersymmetry Ward identi-
ties. We have checked that, prior to specializing to D = 4, the ultraviolet divergence cancels
for D < 8, as expected [11]. In D = 8, we match the prediction from the heterotic string
(see section 3.A.1 of Ref. [40]) as well as the calculation in Ref. [11]. It may also be possi-
ble to compare our D-dimensional expression to the recent D = 10 prediction in Ref. [41]
obtained from M-theory. However, performing this comparison would be nontrivial as the
divergences are quadratic in this dimension and hence depend on the regulator. It would be
interesting to study this connection further.
The form in which we presented the amplitude in Eq. (3.1) makes the supersymmetry
completely manifest, because it acts only on the MSYM side of the double copy. In addition,
this form makes the translation to gravity transparent.
We now show in some detail how this works for the case of external gravitons. In the
double-copy construction, amplitudes with four external gravitons can be built from inte-
grands with purely gluonic external states on both sides of the double copy. As discussed
in the previous section, it is convenient to use linearized ﬁeld strengths in Eqs. (2.12) and
(2.13) to write the answer. In order to translate to gravity we do this on both sides of the
double copy. From this form, we can easily convert the linearized ﬁeld strengths F in our
10

formulas to a linearized Riemann tensor R using the relation,
2
κRi µνρσ = Fi µνFi ρσ = (ki µεi ν −ki νεi µ) (ki ρεi σ −ki σεi ρ) ,
(3.10)
where the index i refers to the particle label, just as in Eq. (2.11). In this equation the
product of Yang–Mills polarization vectors is identiﬁed as a graviton polarization tensor via
the replacement εi µεi ν →εi µν. The graviton is related to the metric via gµν = ηµν + κhµν,
as in Ref. [36]. The factor of 2/κ is included in Eq. (3.10) so that Ri µνρσ is given by the
linearized Riemann tensor with the ﬁeld hµν replaced by a polarization tensor εi µν.
The contribution from the pure-gluon factor from MSYM is always a factor of stAtree =
it8F 4. Once we multiply the tensors from both sides of the double-copy we then obtain the
following combinations,
t8F 4t8F 4 →t8t8R4 ,
(3.11)
t8F 4(FiFjFkFl) →t8(RiRjRkRl) ,
(3.12)
t8F 4(FiFj)(FkFl) →t8(RiRj)(RkRl) ,

In ten dimensions Eq. (3.11) is a component of the only N = 2 superinvariant, whereas
Eqs. (3.12) and (3.13) are components of the two N = 1 superinvariants [41, 42].
The mapping of the ﬁnal TF 3 tensor to gravity may appear more complicated than for
the F 4-class tensors, because the former is generated from a scattering amplitude with an
F 3 insertion, as previously illustrated in Fig. 2.
A relatively simple way to obtain this
tensor is to use KLT relations for amplitudes extended to include insertions of this higher-
dimensional operator [43, 44]. This extension is in line with expectations from string-theory
KLT relations [45, 46], where the operator appears in the low-energy eﬀective action. In
Refs. [43, 44] it was established that the KLT relations apply to F 3 operators as,
sAtree(1, 2, 3, 4) × Atree
F 3 (1, 2, 4, 3) = iMtree
R2 (1, 2, 3, 4) ,
(3.16)
where all particles are gluons on left-hand side of the equation, and all are gravitons on the
right-hand side when the helicities of each pair of gluons align. Direct checks using Feynman
11

diagrams, starting from the Einstein action, conﬁrm that the Gauss–Bonnet insertion into
a four-point gravity tree amplitude indeed satisﬁes Eq. (3.16) [47]. Hence we see that the
tensor TF 3 maps into the curvature-squared matrix elements in gravity as follows,
stAtree(1, 2, 3, 4)TF 3 = −isuAtree(1, 2, 4, 3)stAtree
F 3 (1, 2, 3, 4) = stuMtree
R2 (1, 2, 3, 4) ,
(3.17)
where we used the crossing symmetry of stAtree(1, 2, 3, 4) and the KLT relation in Eq. (3.16).
After the complete map to linearized Riemann tensors, the graviton amplitude takes the
form,

The same construction works for any supergravity state. For all states in the supergrav-
ity multiplet, the same pure Yang–Mills tensors feed into the corresponding supergravity
expressions; the diﬀerences are solely on the MSYM side of the double copy.
It is remarkable that the coeﬃcient of the curvature-squared matrix element Mtree
R2
ap-
pearing in Eq. (3.18) is just a simple number.
If the theory had a nonvanishing trace
anomaly [48], the coeﬃcient of Mtree
R2
would have contained a 1/ǫ divergence [5, 7, 49]. In
our calculation the divergences are suppressed by an explicit factor of D −4 = 2ǫ, (see, for
example, Eq. (2.11) of Ref. [50]) leaving a ﬁnite rational contribution. From the perspective
of the double copy, this ǫ/ǫ eﬀect also generates the nonvanishing all-plus and single-minus
one-loop amplitudes associated with the U(1) duality anomaly [14]. We comment on this
below.

CURVATURE-SQUARED MULTIPLETS AND DIVERGENCES IN SUPER-
GRAVITY
In the previous section we found curvature-squared contributions to the eﬀective action.
In this section we describe these contribution in more detail.
12

A.
Curvature-Squared Multiplets with Half-Maximal Supersymmetry
In the full superamplitude, we ﬁnd a term proportional to,
sAtree
N =4(1, 2, 4, 3)Atree
F 3 (1, 2, 3, 4) ,
(4.1)
which, as described in the previous section, contains the evanescent matrix element of cur-
vature operators. In general dimensions there exist several oﬀ-shell curvature-squared oper-
ators in gravity theories. The two most important ones are the Gauss–Bonnet density and
the square of the Weyl tensor4, which respectively are given by,
E4 = RµνρσRµνρσ −4RµνRµν + R2 ,
(4.2)
W 2 = Wµνρσ W µνρσ = RµνρσRµνρσ −2RµνRµν + 1
3R2 .
(4.3)
The diﬀerence between the two is,
W 2 −E4 = 2(RµνRµν −1
3R2) ,
(4.4)
which vanishes on shell. The single on-shell independent operator is usually chosen to be the
Gauss–Bonnet combination (4.2). It is however a total derivative in four dimensions, which
implies that all curvature-squared matrix elements are evanescent in this dimension [51]. A
consequence of this is the ﬁniteness of pure-graviton amplitudes at one loop [51] in Einstein
gravity, as these operators are the only available counterterms. (When matter is added to
the theory—even supersymmetric matter multiplets—generic divergences do appear at one
loop starting with amplitudes for four matter particles [52].)
Oﬀ-shell R2 supermultiplets were constructed long ago for N = 1 supergravity in four
dimensions [22], and more recently for N = 2 supergravity [23] using a version of N = 2
superspace. Very recently an N = 4 supersymmetric completion of the Weyl-squared op-
erator has been discussed in Ref. [15] in terms of linearized superﬁelds in four dimensions.
However, at the nonlinear level no fully oﬀ-shell versions have been constructed to date for
any of the curvature-squared multiplets. This is unsurprising in light of the more general
unsolved problem of constructing an oﬀ-shell N = 4 superspace.
4 There is another interesting curvature-squared operator, the Pontryagin density ∗RµνρσRµνρσ; but it is
parity odd and hence it cannot appear in the amplitudes of parity-conserving theories.
13

Eq. (4.1) also contains matrix elements related by supersymmetry to the one correspond-
ing to curvature-squared operators. These must arise from the N = 4 supersymmetric com-
pletion of the curvature operators in Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3). Therefore the existence of such
matrix element implies the existence of the corresponding N = 4 curvature-squared mul-
tiplets. In particular, these matrix elements should correspond to the single insertion of
the operator discussed in Ref. [15] in four dimensions as all curvature-squared operators
are equivalent on shell. However, we cannot analyze such matrix elements strictly in four
dimensions, because they will vanish identically.
The double-copy construction provides additional information, because it implies that
completions of curvature-squared operators with half-maximal supersymmetry should exist
in any integer dimension D ≤10 and that their on-shell matrix elements are given by the
KLT product of the F 3 operator insertion and ordinary MSYM amplitudes. The restriction
to D ≤10 arises because that is the maximum dimension for a super-Yang–Mills theory.
The double-copy perspective also shows that an N ≥5 supersymmetric completion of
curvature-squared operators [53] cannot exist. We have an overall factor of stAtree
N =4 from
the MSYM amplitude on the one side of the double copy. On the other side we would have
an N ≥1 super-Yang–Mills amplitude. From the double-copy perspective, in any dimen-
sion the R2 terms correspond to an F 3 operator on this latter side. We would then need a
supersymmetric completion of the F 3 operator, to make it compatible with N = 1 super-
symmetry. We know, however, that no such completion exists in four dimensions because
F 3 matrix element contributes only to all-plus and single-minus helicity conﬁgurations; and
these are forbidden by a supersymmetric Ward identity [54]. This also rules out supersym-
metric completions for these theories in any dimension D > 4 because on shell there is only
a single independent curvature-squared invariant and one can choose the external momenta
and states to live in a four-dimensional subspace, and hence the same argument applies.
B.
Possible Eﬀects at Higher Loops
In the context of dimensional regularization, evanescent R2 contributions such as the ones
described here play a crucial role in the two-loop divergences of pure gravity [5, 6]. This
happens because the evanescent R2 terms appear at one loop with a divergent coeﬃcient
proportional to the trace anomaly. While such terms do not contribute in four dimensions,

(a)
(b)
FIG. 4: Representative diagrams for insertions of the supersymmetric R2 operator at three loops

they do appear at two loops as subdivergences in the dimensionally regulated amplitude,
directly aﬀecting the value of the two-loop divergence [7]. One must then subtract a one-
loop R2 counterterm insertion, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This evanescent contribution becomes
nonvanishing in dimensional regularization where it modiﬁes the two-loop divergence. The
net result is a curious disconnect between the coeﬃcient of the dimensionally-regulated two-
loop R3 ultraviolet divergence of these theories and the corresponding renormalization-scale
dependence. The coeﬃcient of the divergence depends on details of the regularization, while
the renormalization scale dependence is simple and robust [7, 8].
As shown in Eq. (3.18), in N = 4 supergravity the R2 contribution appears with a ﬁnite
coeﬃcient, so it cannot contribute to possible two-loop divergences. One may nonetheless
expect it to modify divergences at yet-higher loops. Explicit calculations reveal no diver-
gences in N = 4 supergravity through three loops [9], but unveil them at four loops [16].
The addition of supersymmetrization of a curvature-squared operator as a local counterterm
to the action is not expected to have any physical consequences in the scattering amplitudes,
because it is evanescent. The analysis in Ref. [7] shows that it can however aﬀect divergences.
It would be interesting to study the eﬀect of such local counterterms on the known four-loop
divergence calculated in Ref. [16]. One may wonder whether such a ﬁnite counterterm can
be used to modify or even remove the four-loop divergence. The answer to this question
would require a three-loop computation with insertions of this operator, as illustrated in
15

EVANESCENT EFFECTS AND THE U(1) ANOMALY
We now show that from the vantage point of the double copy that the U(1) anomalous
contributions cannot be separated from the evanescent R2 matrix elements, described in
the previous section. We ﬁrst review the anomaly and its manifestation in one-loop matrix
elements [14], before explaining how these eﬀects are intertwined.
In order to describe the anomaly we recall some basic facts about the spectrum of four-
dimensional N = 4 supergravity and the associated superamplitudes.
We focus here on
pure N = 4 supergravity with no matter multiplets. The states of pure N = 4 supergravity
fall into two supermultiplets. One contains the positive-helicity graviton and its superpart-
ners [55]:
(h++, ψ+
a , A+
ab, χ+
abc, φ−+) ,
(5.1)
where h++ is the positive-helicity graviton, ψ+
a are the four positive-helicity gravitinos, and
so forth until the complex scalar φ−+. The indices a, b, c are SU(4) R symmetry indices.
The other supermultiplet is the CPT conjugate to the one above, containing the negative-
helicity graviton h−−and the conjugate scalar φ+−. Seen through the lens of the double-copy,
each multiplet corresponds to the supermultiplet of MSYM multiplied by either a positive-
or negative-helicity gluon on the pure Yang–Mills side. For instance the positive-helicity
graviton arises from a positive-helicity gluon on both sides of the double copy, and the
complex scalars come from negative-helicity gluons on one side and positive-helicity gluons
on the other side.
Because not all the states of this theory are in a single supermultiplet, the amplitudes are
16

organized into diﬀerent sectors not directly related by supersymmetry. For each one of these
sectors there is an associated superamplitude. A simple way to understand this organiza-
tion is via the double-copy construction. The supersymmetry Ward identities imply that
the only nonvanishing helicity amplitudes in MSYM are those in the maximally-helicity-
violating (MHV) sector corresponding to amplitudes with two negative-helicity and two
positive-helicity gluons (g−g−g+g+) and their superpartners, which all sit in a single su-
peramplitude. On the pure Yang–Mills side of the double copy, however, there are three
distinct types of amplitudes: all-plus (g+g+g+g+), single-minus (g−g+g+g+), and two-minus
or MHV (g−g−g+g+), together with their parity conjugates. Hence there are three distinct
sectors of supergravity super-amplitudes, inherited from each of the pure-Yang–Mills he-
licity conﬁgurations. In the all-plus and single-minus pure Yang–Mills sectors the gluons
do not have the same number of negative or positive helicities as the gluons in the MSYM
amplitude. Because of this the corresponding N = 4 supergravity superamplitudes do not
contain four-graviton amplitudes, but have mixed graviton–scalar amplitudes as their top
components, as illustrated in Table I.
Ref. [13] showed that there exists an anomaly in an abelian U(1) subgroup of the SU(1, 1)
duality group of N = 4 supergravity. This anomaly is manifested in the nonvanishing of the
amplitudes,
MN =4,SG(1h−−, 2φ−+, 3h++, 4h++) =

MN =4,SG(1φ−+, 2φ−+, 3h++, 4h++) =
i
(4π)2 [3 4]4 ,
(5.2)
as well as those related by supersymmetry [14]. The spinor inner products ⟨a b⟩and [a b]
follow the standard conventions in Ref. [56]. The scalars carry a charge under the U(1) sub-
group whereas the gravitons are uncharged and hence these amplitudes violate conservation
of this charge. At tree level the charges are conserved because the amplitudes all vanish, but
at loop level they do not. This anomaly can be traced back to O(ǫ) terms which interfere
with a would-be 1/ǫ divergence, leaving behind a rational term. This is similar to the way
the chiral anomaly arises in dimensional regularization [17].
As explained above, our calculation reveals evanescent contributions in Eq. (4.1), which
are related to the supersymmetric completion of the R2 operator. Mixed graviton–scalar
amplitudes also receive non-evanescent contributions from the same terms. A simple way
to see this is by expressing the F 3 matrix element in a basis of gauge-invariant tensors that

has deﬁnite four-dimensional helicity properties. We give two such bases in the Appendix.
In the basis with tensors that have deﬁnite crossing-symmetry properties, we ﬁnd that the
F 3 matrix element is given by,
TF 3 =
2stu
(s2 + t2 + u2) H(++++)−H(−+++)+2(s −t)(s −u)(t −u)
3(s2 + t2 + u2)2
Hev1−
6stu
(s2 + t2 + u2)2 Hev2 ,
(5.3)
where the nonlocal denominators all cancel to give a local expression for TF 3. This de-
composition explicitly shows that TF 3 has nonvanishing contributions to the all-plus and
single-minus helicity conﬁgurations, with the rest of the tensor being evanescent in four di-
mensions. This gives some additional insight into the evanescent nature of the R2 matrix
element in gravity. The only nonvanishing amplitudes on the MSYM side of the double
copy have an MHV helicity conﬁguration (−−+ +), whereas Eq. (5.3) shows that the F 3
matrix element does not contribute to MHV amplitudes on the pure Yang–Mills side. This
implies that the pure-graviton matrix elements vanish in four dimensions. More importantly,
we see that this matrix element contributes to the all-plus and single-minus helicities, thus
generating anomalous mixed graviton-scalar matrix elements after applying the double-copy
construction.
An alternative way to understand the diﬀerent contributions of this matrix element is to
recall that in general dimension, a pair of gluons is mapped via the double copy to a graviton,
a dilaton and an antisymmetric tensor. In four dimensions the antisymmetric tensor is dual
to a pseudoscalar that together with the dilaton combines into the complex scalar discussed
above. The intertwining of the anomalous and evanescent contributions in Eq. (3.16) there-
fore follows from the entanglement of the graviton, dilaton and an antisymmetric tensor in
the double-copy construction.
From the discussion above, we conclude that the F 3 KLT product in Eq. (3.16) not
18

only gives the evanescent curvature-squared matrix elements, but it necessarily results in an
anomalous contribution to the amplitude. It is striking that contributions to both can be
traced back to precisely the same term in the double copy. The anomalous contributions
arising from TF 3 are summarized in Table II. In this table the supermomentum delta function
can be expanded as [57]

(5.4)
where we take the top component to be the one containing the factor [3 4]4. Comparing
these to the anomalous amplitudes in Eq. (5.2) we see that, while the amplitudes in the
single-scalar sector are fully contained in this term, those in the two-scalar sector are oﬀby
an overall factor and receive additional contributions that change the overall coeﬃcient.
Finally, it is interesting to note that such anomalous and evanescent eﬀects will not
appear in the one-loop amplitudes of N ≥5 supergravity. The lack of anomalous one-loop
amplitudes in N ≥5 supergravity has been recently explained from the vantage point of
super-invariants [15]. This, together with the absence of evanescent eﬀects, is understood
in the double-copy procedure as a consequence of the vanishing of the one-loop all-plus and
single-minus amplitudes in super-Yang–Mills theories.
VI.
CONCLUSION
In this paper we identiﬁed terms in the dimensionally regulated one-loop four-point am-
plitude of pure N = 4 supergravity that can be written as insertions of curvature-squared
operators into matrix elements. Such terms are evanescent and vanish for four-dimensional
external states. We also showed that these evanescent terms are intertwined with contri-
butions generated by the U(1) duality anomaly [13, 14]. These two eﬀects both arise from
rational pieces that result from an ǫ/ǫ cancellation, where ǫ = (4 −D)/2 is the dimensional
regularization parameter.
Both the anomaly and the evanescent curvature-squared terms may play a central role in
the ultraviolet properties of gravity theories. As explained in Ref. [14] the anomaly in N = 4
supergravity gives contributions with a poor ultraviolet behavior. We also know that beyond
one loop, evanescent eﬀects contribute to dimensionally regulated ultraviolet divergences in
gravity theories [7].
19

We carried out our analysis using the double-copy construction [1, 18] of N = 4 super-
gravity [21] in terms of the corresponding pure Yang–Mills and N = 4 MSYM amplitudes.
The double-copy construction makes the on-shell supersymmetry manifest, because N = 4
supergravity inherits the well-understood on-shell superspace of MSYM theory. By using
formal polarization vectors on the pure-Yang–Mills side of the double copy, we were able to
evaluate all one-loop four-point amplitudes of N = 4 supergravity simultaneously. In the
graviton sector we gave explicit conversion formulas from gauge theory to gravity, using rela-
tions between linearized Riemann tensors and Yang–Mills ﬁeld strengths. The double-copy
construction implies that completions of curvature-squared operators with half-maximal su-
persymmetry should exist in any dimension with D ≤10 and that their on-shell matrix
elements are given by the KLT product of the F 3 operator insertion and ordinary MSYM
amplitudes.
There are a number of interesting avenues for future research.
Although it is is not
known how to write the super-Gauss–Bonnet in an oﬀ-shell superspace, our paper provides
all components of four-point matrix elements of single insertions of these operators. For the
pure-graviton amplitude the Gauss–Bonnet operator is the correct one for generating these
matrix elements. For amplitudes with other external states, one would ﬁrst need to system-
atically write down a set of evanescent operators of the same dimension, feed them through
a tree-level matrix-element computation and then match them to our evanescent matrix
elements. Once the combination of operators leading to our evanescent matrix elements are
found, one can try to appropriately package the components into superﬁelds.
We organized the one-loop amplitude in terms of gauge-invariant tensors. These and
their associated projectors are described in the appendix and given in the Mathematica
attachement [26]. They are useful, not only for N = 4 supergravity, but for any gauge-
theory four-gluon amplitude at any loop order.
In pure gravity the evanescent one-loop curvature-squared terms enter with a coeﬃcient
proportional to 1/ǫ. Because of this, when inserted as counterterms in a two-loop calculation
they aﬀect the leading ultraviolet divergence [7]. In N = 4 supergravity these evanescent
terms appear with a ﬁnite coeﬃcient. This means that they cannot aﬀect divergences until
three loops or higher. Direct calculations show that the three-loop divergences cancel [9]
and the ﬁrst divergence occurs at four loops [16]. It is important to understand the eﬀect of
evanescent and anomalous contribution on higher-loop amplitudes, especially to see whether
20

their contributions can account for the four-loop divergence of N = 4 supergravity. A direct
study requires a three-loop computation.
An important step in this direction would be
to analyze the anomalous sector at two loops in N = 4 supergravity and its relation to
evanescent eﬀects. In the longer term, understanding the role of anomalies and evanescent
eﬀects more generally at higher loops appears to be crucial in order to unravel the ultraviolet
properties of supergravity theories.

Appendix A: Gauge-Invariant Tensors for Yang–Mills Four-Point Amplitudes
In this appendix, we describe two independent sets of Yang–Mills kinematic tensors built
out of physical polarization vectors εi and on-shell momenta ki. In both sets, the tensors are
constrained to be on-shell gauge invariant, that is vanishing under the substitution εi →ki
for each external leg independently. The tensors are polynomials in the dot products ki · εj,
εi·εj, and the Mandelstam invariants s and t. They are thus free of poles by construction. We
also organize the tensors to have deﬁnite symmetry properties under a relevant symmetry,
and to be diagonal in a four-dimensional helicity basis. The tensors are dimension-agnostic,
and so the sets are not in general diagonal in a basis of external states outside of four
dimensions. Both sets have seven tensors.
In the ﬁrst set, each tensor represents kinematic parts of a color-ordered amplitude, up
to a function of s and t. Such amplitudes are invariant under a cyclic permutation of the
external indices, i →(i + 1) mod 4, so we choose the tensors to have deﬁnite symmetry
properties under the cyclic shift. An arbitrary function can be split up into symmetric and
antisymmetric combinations, f±(s, t) = 1
2[f(s, t) ± f(t, s)], so we choose the tensors to be
symmetric or antisymmetric. It might seem simpler to choose them to be symmetric; but
for some of them, an antisymmetric form is simpler. In an amplitude, such antisymmetric
tensors would then appear multiplied by an antisymmetric function of s and t. We present
this set in the ﬁrst subsection.
For the second set, each tensor represents one Yang–Mills copy in a double-copy construc-
tion of an N = 4 supergravity amplitude, where the other copy is given by the tree-level
tensor. These tensors then suﬃce to construct the N = 4 supergravity four-point amplitude
at one and two loops. These tensors are required to have deﬁnite symmetry properties un-
der the full permutation group acting on the external indices. We are interested only in the
one-dimensional representations of this group, so again each tensor will either be completely
invariant, or will change sign according to the signature of a permutation. We present this
set in the second subsection.
In the third subsection, we describe set of projection operators that can be applied to
an expression given in terms of polarization vectors and momenta to obtain the (scalar)
coeﬃcients of the diﬀerent basis tensors.

It vanishes, of course, for the ( + + + + ) and ( −+ + + ) classes of helicities, and is
nonvanishing for MHV helicities ( −−+ + ). It is invariant under cyclic shifts of the
external legs. We choose the remaining tensors to have deﬁnite helicity properties as well.

The ﬁrst tensor is the tree-level tensor given above in Eq. (A1). The subsequent four
tensors each are labeled by the class of four-dimensional helicity conﬁguration on which
they are nonvanishing. The ﬁnal two tensors are nontrivial formal objects, but vanish for
24

all four-dimensional helicities. Outside of four dimensions, they do not vanish, however, as
demonstrated, for example, by the nonvanishing value of the sum over states of each tensor
multiplied by its conjugate. They represent the kinematic part of evanescent operators in
Yang–Mills theory. In a slight abuse of language, we will therefore call them evanescent
tensors. Three other gauge-invariant tensors can be constructed, but these do not have the
correct symmetry properties to appear in color-ordered physical amplitudes. The properties
of all the tensors, as well as their values in four-dimensional helicity are summarized in
Table III. The expressions for the tensors are also given in a companion Mathematica ﬁle,
tensors-ym.m. The notation there is,
ee[i,j] = εi · εj ,
ke[i,j]
= ki · εj ,
dot[i,j] = ki · kj .
(A4)
The seven tensors in Eq. (A3) sequentially correspond to T[[i]] in the ﬁle for i = 1, . . . , 7. The
spinor-valued expressions for the tensors in four dimensions are also given that ﬁle, with the
seven values for each four-dimensional helicity conﬁguration recorded in value[helicity-string],
for example value[“++++”]. These expressions employ the notation,
spa[i,j] = ⟨i j⟩,
spb[i,j] = [i j] .
(A5)
Conversely, we can express the linearized combinations (A2) in terms of the color-ordered
tensors,

Tensors with Deﬁnite Permutation Symmetry
In this subsection, we present four-gluon kinematic tensors with deﬁnite properties under
the full permutation group. These are ultimately useful for decomposing N = 4 supergravity
amplitudes at one and two loops in a double-copy approach. The tree tensor (A1) is already
fully crossing invariant, so we take it to be the ﬁrst tensor in this set as well, here calling
it Htree.
The remaining tensors are either invariant under all permutations of external
labels, or are multiplied by the signature of the permutation (±1). We will call the latter
signature-odd.
A signature-odd tensor will be multiplied by a signature-odd polynomial in s and t in
any physical amplitude. Any invariant polynomial can also appear as a tensor prefactor in
an amplitude, of course. All invariant polynomials can be built out of products of two basic
polynomials,
σ2(s, t, u) = s2 + t2 + u2 = 2(s2 + st + t2) = −2(st + tu + us) ,
σ3(s, t, u) = s3 + t3 + u3 = 3stu ,
(A7)
with a constant prefactor. Any signature-odd polynomial is a product of an invariant poly-
nomial and the basic signature-odd polynomial,
α(s, t, u) = −(s −t)(t −u)(u −s) = (s −t)(2s + t)(s + 2t) .
(A8)
This polynomial satisﬁes the identity
2 α2 = σ3
2 −6 σ2
3 ,
(A9)
so that we need not consider powers of α.
We can again express the tensors in terms of the linearized-ﬁeld strength quantities deﬁned
26

in Eq. (A2),
Htree = −1
2((F 2
s )2 + (F 2
t )2 + (F 2
u)2) + 2 (F 4
st + F 4
tu + F 4
us) = t8F 4 ,
H(++++) = 3
2 ((F 2
s )2 + (F 2
t )2 + (F 2
u)2) −2 (F 4
st + F 4
tu + F 4
us) ,
H(−+++) = −TF 3 −4
3 (F 4
tu s + F 4
us t −F 4
st (s + t)) ,
Hmhv1 = −((F 2
s )2 + 2 F 4
tu) s −((F 2
t )2 + 2 F 4
us) t + (2 F 4
st + (F 2
u)2) (s + t) ,
Hmhv2 = (F 2
u)2 (s −t) (s + t) + (F 2
t )2 t (2 s + t) −(F 2
s )2 s (s + 2 t) ,
Hev1 = 4 (F 4
st (s −t) (s + t) + F 4
us t (2 s + t) −F 4
tu s (s + 2 t)) ,
Hev2 = ((F 2
s )2 + (F 2
t )2 + (F 2
u)2) (s2 + s t + t2) −4 (F 4
tu t (s + t) −s (F 4
st t −F 4
us (s + t))) .
(A10)
The second and third tensors are again labeled by the four-dimensional helicity class
for which they are nonvanishing; the fourth and ﬁfth are both nonvanishing for all MHV
helicities.
The last two are again “evanescent”, in the sense that they are nonvanishing
outside of four dimensions but vanish for all four-dimensional helicity conﬁgurations. (As in
Sect. A 1, they do not include factors of 1/ǫ that would be needed to yield a nonvanishing
result in four dimensions.)

TABLE IV: Nonvanishing helicities and values for the pregravity tensor basis.
Each tensor is
also nonvanishing on the permutations and parity conjugates of the indicated helicity states. The
evanescent tensors vanish for all four-dimensional helicities but are included in the table.
The expressions for the tensors are also given in a companion Mathematica ﬁle, tensors-
neq4gr.m, with H[[i]], i = 1, . . . , 7 corresponding in order to the tensors in Eq. (A10).
27

The spinor-valued expressions for the tensors in four dimensions are also given in that
ﬁle; as in Sect. A 1, the seven values for each four-dimensional helicity conﬁguration given
by value[helicity-string]. The notation follows Eqs. (A4) and (A5). The properties of the
tensors are summarized in Table IV.
Because these tensor have deﬁnite properties under permutations, we can connect them
straightforwardly to matrix elements of corresponding operators after the double copy. A
few examples would be,
σ2t8F 4t8F 4 ↔t8t8D4R4 ,
t8F 4(uF 4
st + sF 4
tu + tF 4
us) ↔t8tr(D2R4) ,
σ2t8F 4((F 2

Projectors for Basis Tensors
In this subsection, we present a set of projectors that can be used to obtain the scalar
coeﬃcients of the basis tensors for an expression given in terms of polarization vectors
and momenta. When applied to an integrated expression for an amplitude, the resulting
decomposition will reproduce the original expression; when applied to an integrand, there
may be a total-derivative discrepancy that will integrate to zero.
We deﬁne an inner product ⊙of a polarization vector and its conjugate to be given by
the sum over states,
ǫ∗µ
i
⊙ǫν
i =
X
states h
ǫ∗(h),µ
i
ǫ(h),ν
i
= −gµν + kµ
i qν + qµkν
i
q · ki
,
(A12)
where q is a null reference vector not collinear to any external momentum. (It is similar to
a lightcone-gauge vector.) In four dimensions, the state sum becomes,
X
states h
ǫ∗(h),µ
i
ǫ(h),ν
i
=
X
h=±
ǫ∗(h),µ
i
ǫ(h),ν
i
=
X
h=±
ǫ(−h),µ
i
ǫ(h),ν
i
,
(A13)
where the sum is over vector helicities.
In all dimensions, the projector onto the jth tensor is then given by,
Pj = cjiT ∗
i ,
(A14)
where the matrix c is the inverse of the (symmetric) inner product matrix m, whose elements
are given by,
mij = T ∗
i ⊙Tj .
(A15)
28

The coeﬃcient of Tj in an expression X is given by Pj ⊙X.
Each basis has a corresponding set of projectors; the projectors for the cyclicly-organized
basis described in Sect. A 1 are given alongside the tensors and helicity values in tensors-
ym.m, where the projector Pj onto Tj is given by P[[j]]. The expressions make use of the
following notation in addition to that in Eq. (A4),
cc[i,j] = ε∗
i · ε∗
j ,
kc[i,j] = ki · ε∗
j ,
chi = t/s ,
d = D .
(A16)
In four dimensions, m has rank 5, as expected from the nature of T5 and T6. In six dimen-
sions, it has rank 7, showing indirectly that there are some helicities with non-vanishing
values for these two tensors. The corresponding projectors for the basis of Sect. A 2 orga-
nized under the full crossing symmetry are given in tensors-neq4gr.m. The projector matrix
again has rank 5 in four dimensions, and rank 7 in six dimensions.
