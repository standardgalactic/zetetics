Acknowledgments
I am grateful to God for life and breath and mathematics, as well as my ability to write
it, draw it, and enjoy it. I am grateful to my family, especially Lydia, who put up with
my absence during times I needed to work on this manuscript.
Many thanks to Doug Hofstadter, who showed me the power of group theory visu-
alization and supported my work on it in several ways, including much good advice.
Many thanks to Charlie Hadlock, who kept me away from not-so-good advice (such as
\Don't write a book before you get tenure") and who guided many of the early steps
of this project. I also thank Don Albers, the MAA, and Bentley University (particularly
Rick Cleary and Kate Davy), all of whom encouraged, supported, and took a chance on
a first-time author.
I must also thank those whose mathematical work helped me in mine. One of my
early exposures to group theory visualization techniques was Magnus and Grossman's
Groups and Their Graphs. In writing this book I made frequent reference to the excellent
texts by Michael Artin, John Fraleigh, Charles Hadlock, and Thomas Hungerford. The
powerful and well-designed software Asymptote by John Bowman helped me make the
more than 300 figures herein. Thank you!
Lastly, there are many people who read early chapters and drafts and provided much
helpful feedback. These include Doug Hofstadter, Jon Zivan, an anonymous referee, my
parents, and my Fall 2006 Discrete Mathematics class, especially Kathryn Ogorzalek.
Thank you for helping me see my work through your eyes, and improve it.

Preface
If you are interested in learning about group theory in a relaxed, intuitive way, then this
book is for you. I say learning about group theory because this book does not aim to cover
group theory comprehensively. Herein you will find clear, illustrated exposition about the
basics of the subject, which will give you a solid foundation of intuitions, images, and
examples on which you can build with further study.
This book is ideal for a student beginning a first course in group theory. It can be used
in place of a traditional textbook, or as a supplement to one, but its aim is quite different
than that of a traditional text. Most textbooks present the theory of groups using theorems,
proofs, and examples. Their exercises teach you how to make conjectures about groups
and prove or refute them. This book, however, teaches you to know groups. You will
see them, experiment with them, and understand their significance. The mental library of
images and intuitions you gain from reading this book will enable you to appreciate far
better the facts and proofs in a traditional text.
This book is also appropriate for recreational reading. If you want an overview of the
theory of groups, or to learn key principles without going as deep as some upper-level
undergraduate mathematics courses, you can read this book by itself. Only a typical high
school mathematics education is assumed, but you should have a willingness to think
analytically.
My work on this book stems from Group Explorer, a software package I wrote that
creates illustrations for finite groups, and allows the user to interact and experiment
with them. Many of the illustrations in this text were generated with the help of Group
Explorer, and the investigations possible in Group Explorer can help you with some of
this book's exercises.
You do not need Group Explorer to benefit from this book; very few exercises specif-
ically direct you to Group Explorer. But I recommend taking full advantage of hands-on,
interactive learning experiences when they're available; the more involved we are, the
more we tend to learn. Group Explorer is free software, available for all major operating
systems. You can find it online at
http://groupexplorer.sourceforge.net.

Overview
I highlight here three essential aspects of this book's nonstandard approach to group
theory, and briefly discuss its organization.
First and foremost, images and visual examples are the heart of this book. There are
more than 300 images, an average of more than one per page. The most used visualiza-
tion tool is Cayley diagrams (defined in Chapter 2) because they represent group structure
clearly and faithfully. But multiplication tables and objects with symmetry also appear
regularly, and to a lesser extent cycle graphs, Hasse diagrams, action diagrams, homomor-
phism diagrams, and more. As you can tell by flipping through the pages, visualization
is the name of the game.
Second, I focus more on finite groups than on infinite ones. This is partially because
they are easier to diagram, but more so because they give a solid foundation of intuition
for group theory in general. Understanding finite groups well makes the infinite a natural
generalization. This approach sacrifices little, if anything, because so much remains to
study in the realm of the finite. I cover the most common infinite groups, and each
chapter's exercises includes some on infinite groups.
Lastly, this book approaches groups from the opposite direction of many traditional
textbooks. The usual paradigm defines a group as a set with a binary operation, and later
proves Cayley's Theorem, that every group is a collection of permutations (or you could
say that every group acts on some set, most notably itself). The traditional definition does
not appear in this book until Chapter 4; I define groups in Chapter 1 as collections of
actions, and later prove that they can also be thought of as sets with binary operations.
This nonstandard paradigm facilitates my introduction in Chapter 2 of Cayley diagrams,
which depict groups as collections of actions.
The book's structure is linear, to be read in order; later sections usually depend on
earlier ones. There are two exceptions. Chapter 5, which gives broad exposure to finite
groups, is helpful but not strictly necessary for what follows. You could skip most of it
(except the definition of abelian in Section 5.2) and turn back to it later as needed. The
other exception is that Chapter 10 depends only slightly on Chapter 9; Cauchy's Theorem
from Section 9.2 is used in Section 10.7, and the remainder of Chapter 9 may be useful
in a few of the exercises in Chapter 10.

Overview
Chapter 10, on Galois theory, aims to show the power of group theory and some of
its historical roots. It includes an introduction to fields, but several theorems are stated
without proof. It gives enough understanding to see how group theory ties in, and points
the reader elsewhere for more details on fields. The beautiful and historic result of the
unsolvability of the quintic is the focus and endpoint of that final chapter.

What is a group?
1.1
A famous toy
In 1974, Ernâ¢o Rubik of Budapest, Hungary unleashed his fascinating invention called
Rubik's Cube. It infiltrated popular culture, appearing in feature films, inspiring competi-
tions, and captivating children and geniuses alike. Mathematics journals carried research
articles analyzing the cube and its patterns. Those unable to solve the cube could learn
solutions from any of dozens of books.
A new Rubik's Cube comes out of the box looking like Figure 1.1. Each face of the
cube contains nine smaller faces of smaller cubes, with the colors arranged to agree. You
begin playing with the cube by rotating its faces to mix up the colors. Figure 1.2 shows
how two different rotations in succession begin to disorder the cube. After playing with
a cube idly for a few minutes, an innocent customer finds that the colors are completely
shuffled, and there is no obvious way of returning to the original, pristine state. The
challenge of Rubik's Cube is to restore a scrambled cube to its original state.
Rubik's Cube has a unique flavor among puzzles and games, and much of this flavor
comes from the mathematical patterns inherent in the cube itself. At first the cube may

the final cube shows the result of that move.
not seem very mathematical, given that it doesn't seem to require any skill with numbers,
equations, or quantities in order to play with it, or even to solve it. But that is because
the mathematics covered in this book, group theory, is not primarily about numbers; it is
about patterns. Group theory studies symmetry, which can be found not only in the cube
itself, but also in the patterns of its movements.
Marketing slogans like \Easy to learn, a challenge to master" adorned several puzzles
invented by Ernâ¢o Rubik. This tagline certainly describes the cube, and we can get an
excellent start to our group theory studies by examining why this is so. In this chapter
we will examine those aspects of the cube that make it easy to learn and in Chapter 2 we
will look at what makes it a challenge to master.
1.2
Considering the cube
To explore why Rubik's Cube is easy to learn, let's make several observations.
In part, the cube is easy to play with because users don't need to learn a complex
list of rules. In contrast, players wanting to play chess must first learn the different rules
for each piece. Furthermore, some of the available moves may become unavailable to
the player as the game progresses. Rubik's Cube does not have this type of intricacy;
we might even say it has only six moves|rotating any one of the six faces 90 degrees
clockwise.1 By combining these six moves, players can explore the full (enormous) gamut
of cube configurations. This accessibility leads us to our first observation about the cube.
Observation 1.1. There is a predefined list of moves that never changes.
Another agreeable aspect of Rubik's Cube is that it is somewhat forgiving of mistakes.
If a player rotates a face and immediately regrets the move, no great harm has been done.
The player can simply rotate the face the other way to undo the mistake. Let us make
this our second observation.
Observation 1.2. Every move is reversible.
Another helpful aspect of the cube is a bit less noticeable, but becomes clearer in
contrast with other games: Rubik's Cube is not a game of chance. A tennis player may
have every intention of hitting a great shot, but fail to do so because their body does not
execute their wishes. A poker player may have an excellent strategy, but not win because of
the cards they were dealt. Unpredictability and chance give a certain flavor to a game, and
1Although a player can also rotate faces 90 degrees counterclockwise, that movement is the same as three
sequential 90 degree turns clockwise.

1.3. The study of symmetry
5
Rubik's Cube is devoid of that flavor. The turning of a face of the cube has a predictable
outcome, depending on neither skill nor luck. An action whose outcome can be determined
in advance, free from influences that are random or uncertain, is called deterministic.
Observation 1.3. Every move is deterministic.
But we must be fair. On their own, these observations seem to imply that the cube
has no complexity. To give an accurate account, we must admit that the seemingly limit-
less combinations of moves make the cube challenging. Thus we balance our first three
observations with one more.
Observation 1.4. Moves can be combined in any sequence.
Note the impact of Observation 1.2 on Observation 1.4. If a player were so meticulous
as to write down carefully every move that he or she did, then even a long sequence of
moves could be carefully reversed one at a time.
1.3
The study of symmetry
We could add many other observations to the four above. We could mention the colors of
the faces, the physical construction of the cube, the number of moves it typically takes to
arrive at a solution, or any other aspect of the puzzle or the experience of playing with
it. But we will concentrate on the four above because they highlight those aspects of the
cube that are most relevant to this book. Group theory is the study of symmetry, and we
will see how Observations 1.1 through 1.4 describe the symmetry in Rubik's Cube.
All cubes are symmetrical in that they have all sides the same, all angles the same,
and all edges the same. But Rubik's Cube has the added intricacy of its moving parts.
The set of possible motions and configurations of the smaller cubes that make up the
whole also has a great deal of symmetry. But to clearly explain this, we need to know
what \symmetry" means.
This brings us to the gateway of this book, because group theory is the branch of math-
ematics that answers the question, \What is symmetry?" The first three chapters of this
book give a careful answer to that question by introducing groups and showing how
they describe symmetry. That introduction is already underway|Rubik's Cube is the first
example we will see of objects and patterns that exhibit symmetry. As we analyze them, we
will be learning group theory. Our explorations in future chapters will lead us to other prac-
tical examples of symmetry, including ones as diverse as molecular crystals and dancing.
But we will not limit ourselves only to seeing examples of symmetrical objects. Our
investigations will use many other tools as well; the purpose of this book is to focus on
tools that are visual. This includes common group theory tools such as the multiplication
table as well as less common ones such as Cayley diagrams and cycle graphs. I will
introduce each of these in chapters to come.
Beginning in Chapter 2, you will see examples of objects that have symmetry. Some
of them are physical objects, some of them are actions or behaviors of physical objects,
and some of them are purely imaginary situations. But what they have in common is that
Observations 1.1 through 1.4 apply to all of them. Group theory studies the mathematical
consequences of those observations, and therefore can help answer interesting questions
about symmetrical objects. For instance, how many different configurations does Rubik's

6
1. What is a group?
Cube have? Although we will not do the computation of that number in this book,
interested readers can refer to [21].
1.4
Rules of a group
Let's therefore return to those observations on which group theory is founded. But instead
of considering them as descriptions of Rubik's Cube, let's rephrase them as rules that will
define the boundaries of our study. This is how mathematical subject areas are typically
introduced. A set of rules is laid down, then mathematicians proceed to study things that
obey those rules. The mathematical term for such rules is axioms, but I will call them
rules as long as our discussion remains informal.
Laying down such rules has some noteworthy advantages. First, they make the bound-
aries of our study clear. Things that fit the rules introduced below are part of the study of
group theory, and things that don't are not. Second, by agreeing on the rules in advance
as a mathematical community, we can ensure that we all have the same ideas when we
discuss the subject. In other words, codifying our ideas into rules helps us be sure we
are speaking the same language and minimizes communication problems. Third, we can
use the rules as a basis from which to make logical deductions, and thereby unearth new
facts (in our case, facts about symmetry) that we may not have anticipated from the rules
alone. The computation mentioned above about Rubik's Cube depends on just such facts.
You will do some of these deductions yourself in the exercises for this chapter.
So let us rephrase the observations about Rubik's Cube into rules. As mentioned
above, think of these rules as the requirements that something must meet to belong in our
study of symmetry.
Rule 1.5. There is a predefined list of actions that never changes.
Rule 1.6. Every action is reversible.
Rule 1.7. Every action is deterministic.
Rule 1.8. Any sequence of consecutive actions is also an action.
My rephrasing involved making only two changes. First, I changed the word move to
the word action to make it sound less like a game. In the Rubik's Cube context, the former
wording was appropriate, but we do not want to restrict our attention only to games.
Second, when writing Rule 1.8, I rephrased Observation 1.4 to make the terminology
clearer; not only is every sequence of actions possible, but we will go so far as to call
every sequence an action in its own right. This does not mean that such an action has
to appear on the list required by Rule 1.5, but rather that the (usually short) list in Rule
1.5 is a starting point from which we can create new actions using Rule 1.8, that is, by
chaining actions together into sequences.
In the case of Rubik's Cube, although I list only six basic actions, you can form
many actions by combining these six. As a simple example, combining two 90-degree
rotations of the front face in sequence creates a new action, a 180-degree rotation of the
front face. More complicated examples can be created from sequences of three or four or
more different basic actions chained together. The standard way to say this is that Rule
1.5 gives us actions that generate all the others, and are therefore called generators.
We are now ready for our first definition, which marks your passage into the study
of group theory. This is not the usual mathematical definition of a group, but it expresses

1.5. Exercises

the same idea as the usual one, as we will see later. For now, let's call this our unofficial
definition.
Definition 1.9 (group, unofficially). A group is a system or collection of actions satis-
fying Rules 1.5 through 1.8.
You may now be wondering what things besides Rubik's Cube fit this definition. What
other things deserve to be called groups? As we will see in Chapters 2 and 3, anything in
which symmetry arises will satisfy Rules 1.5 through 1.8, including important examples
from science, art, and mathematics. But for now, the following exercises will allow you
to play with the rules themselves a bit, and see a few simple contexts in which they apply.
They will give you a firmer grasp on the meaning of the rules before we proceed.
1.5
Exercises
The following exercises are thought experiments to help you understand the concepts
just discussed. With mathematics and similar scientific endeavors, the exercises usually
require some thought, and therefore take more time than the reading itself. Although you
can appreciate the material with a quick reading, you can know it intimately only with
lengthier consideration. Therefore, do not be discouraged if the exercises take some time;
this is normal.
Also, feel no shame looking up the answers to a few exercises in the Appendix to get
the idea for how to complete them. Because these are not typical mathematical exercises,
they may seem unfamiliar or strange. Therefore looking up an answer or two to get the
hang of them is a reasonable strategy.

Exercise 1.1. Place a penny and a nickel side by side on a table or desk. Consider just
one action, the action of swapping the places of the two coins. Is this a group? (Check
each of the four rules to see if they are true for this situation. Explain your conclusion.)
Exercise 1.2. Consider the same situation as in Exercise 1.1, but add a dime to the right
of the other two coins. The only action is still that of swapping the places of the penny
and nickel. Is this a group?
Exercise
1.3. Imagine that you have five marbles in your left pocket. Consider two
actions, moving a marble from your left pocket into your right pocket and moving a
marble from your right pocket into your left pocket. Is this a group?
Exercise 1.4. Three walls in your bedroom hold pieces of art, one hung on each wall.
You are rearranging them to see which arrangement best suits your taste. You cannot use
the fourth wall, because it has a window.
(a) Count the number of ways there are to rearrange the pictures, as long as only one is
hung on each wall.
(b) Consider two actions: You may swap the art on the left wall with the art on the center
wall, and you may swap the art on the center wall with the art on the right wall. Can
these two actions alone generate all of the configurations you counted?

1. What is a group?
(c) Does part (b) describe a group? If not, what rule or rules were broken?
(d) Now add a new action, moving all art from the right wall to the center wall, even if
this causes there to be more than one piece of art there. Is this new situation a group?
If not, what rule or rules were broken?
1.5.2
Consequences of the rules
Exercise 1.5. Does Rule1.8 imply that every group must contain infinitely many actions?
Explain your reasoning carefully.
Exercise
1.6. For each of Exercises 1.1 through 1.4 that actually described a group,
determine exactly how many actions there are in that group. That is, do not count only
the generators, but all possible actions obtainable using Rule 1.8.
Exercise 1.7. Consider again the situation from Exercise 1.1.
(a) Only one action was given. By Rule 1.8, performing this action twice in a row is also
a valid action. Describe it.
(b) Will every group have an action like this? Explain your reasoning carefully.
Exercise
1.8. For each of the following requirements (a) through (e), devise a group
that meets that requirement. (Groups always satisfy Rules 1.5 through 1.8; the require-
ments below are additional ones just for this exercise.) If some groups you've already
encountered fit these requirements, you may feel free to reuse them.
(a) The order in which actions are performed impacts the outcome.
(b) The order in which actions are performed does not impact the outcome.
(c) There are exactly three actions.
(d) There are exactly four actions.
(e) There are infinitely many actions.
Exercise
1.9. Can you devise a plan for creating a group with any given number of
actions? (I do not mean a plan for creating a group with a specified number of generators,
but rather a specified number of actions, once Rule 1.8 has been applied.)
1.5.3
Breaking the rules
Rules 1.6 through 1.8 would not make much sense without Rule 1.5, because it introduces
the notion of a list of actions. But for each of the other rules, we can ask what it would
be like if that rule were not present.
Devising a context in which all but one of the four rules is true shows something
significant|that the missing rule is not redundant. For instance, let's say someone sug-
gested to you that Rule 1.8 could be dropped, because the combination of the other three
rules implies that Rule 1.8 must be true. By finding a context in which the other three
rules are true, but Rule 1.8 is false, you can prove that the combination of Rules 1.5, 1.6,
and 1.7 does not imply the truth of Rule 1.8. Thus by doing Exercises 1.10 through 1.12,
you will have shown that all the rules are necessary; that is, none are redundant.

Exercise 1.10. Devise a situation that satisfies all of the four rules except Rule 1.6.

Groups of numbers
Since group theory is a mathematical subject, it should not surprise us that numbers can
be formed into groups, in various ways.
Exercise
1.13. Pick any whole number and consider this set of actions: adding any
whole number to the one you chose. This is an infinite set of actions; we might name
them things like \add 1" and \add  17." Is it a group? If so, how small a set of generators
can you find?
Exercise 1.14.
(a) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only even numbers?
(b) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only whole numbers
from 0 to 10?
(c) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed all whole numbers,
but changed the set of actions to multiplying by any whole number? (I do not ask
you to consider those actions as generators, but as the complete set of actions.)
(d) What would be the answer to the previous exercise if we allowed only the numbers
1 and  1, and just two actions, multiplying by either 1 or  1?

Mapmaking
Chapter 1 introduced group theory by examining those properties of Rubik's Cube that
make it attractive to beginners. Let us now investigate those aspects of the cube that make
it difficult to solve.
When you have in your hands an unsolved Rubik's Cube, and you do not know a
method for solving it, experimentally twisting the faces quickly begins to seem pointless.
You are wandering aimlessly through the multitude of possible configurations of the cube.
Somewhere in this enormous wilderness of jumbled cube configurations is the one oasis
you want to find|the solved cube. But without any idea of where you are, where the
oasis is, or what direction you're walking as you make moves, the situation is (almost)
completely hopeless.
What would be very helpful to someone lost in the endless reaches of Rubik's wilder-
ness is a map|a reference that could say, \You are here," and \The solution is over here,"
and show you the path to get there. Such a map would eliminate all your navigational
problems. Anyone could solve the cube quickly with such a map (although it may not be
much fun to do so).
Many books on Rubik's Cube teach solution techniques, and some academic papers
use group theory to provide detailed analyses of the cube [21]. My purpose is not to
duplicate their efforts here by providing you with a map of Rubik's wilderness. Instead, I
want to conduct a thought experiment about what a fully detailed map of that wilderness
would be like. Such a map is not just a technique for getting to the solved state, but a
complete map of every configuration of the cube and how those configurations relate to
one another. Since all this information will obviously not fit on an ordinary-sized map,
let's say we'll put it in a big book. Because this is only a thought experiment, let's call
our book The Big Book, and consider what this book will need to contain.
Imagine that you have both a jumbled Rubik's Cube and a copy of The Big Book.
The Big Book should first help you determine where you are in the wilderness. To make
11

12
2. What do groups look like?
this possible, let's organize The Big Book to have one cube configuration on each page,
and let's order the pages in a dictionary-like way. Just as all the words starting with \a"
in the dictionary are together, perhaps all cubes with a red sticker on the leftmost square
of their top face would be together. Within that group of cubes, another sticker's color
would organize, like the second letter of a dictionary word, and so on. The details of such
an organization are not important, because this is only a thought experiment, after all.
Let's agree that we could come up with such an organization if necessary, enabling the
readers of The Big Book to look up their jumbled cubes in the book (with a good dose
of patience and care).
Now let's say you have found the page in The Big Book showing your cube's config-
uration. That page should provide some navigational help, the details of which are best
shown by an example. Figure 2.1 shows a page from The Big Book. The page shows all
faces of a certain cube configuration, front and back, and tells the reader how far that
cube is from being solved. A table then provides navigational help; it tells the reader
what each available move would accomplish. For instance, the first row of the table tells
us that twisting the front face of the cube clockwise would result in the configuration on
page 36; 131; 793; 510; 312; 058; 964 of the book, which is closer to the solution than the
configuration shown on the current page.
You can see how you could use such a book to solve your cube. Once you have
found the page on which your cube is shown, simply make a move that puts you closer
to being solved, and turn to the corresponding page. Then repeat the process from there.
You always know how far you are from the solution, and you can always compare your
cube against the picture on the page to be sure you haven't made a navigational error.
The Big Book has one significant problem, which you may have already noticed from
Figure 2.1. Rubik's Cube has more than 4  1019 potential configurations, which would
make a prohibitively large book. We might suggest putting more than one cube state per
page, but in fact even if we could fit one cube state in a square inch, the amount of paper
needed to print the book would cover the surface of the earth many times over. Storing
the book electronically won't help either; even using a very efficient encoding scheme, no
computer in existence at the time of this writing has sufficient storage to contain it.1 So
The Big Book is a thought experiment only, but the remainder of this chapter will show
how valuable a thought experiment it has been.
The most important thing for The Big Book to teach us is that a map of Rubik's
wilderness is really a map of a particular group. Let me explain. The moves in Rubik's
Cube form a group because they satisfy Definition 1.9. (In fact, those moves were our
first example of a group, motivating that very definition.) The rules in Definition 1.9
refer only to the cube's moves, and combinations thereof. Because The Big Book contains
complete data on the moves in Rubik's Cube and how they combine, it is a map of the
group constituted by those combinations.
So the mapmaking ideas introduced by our discussion about The Big Book do not
need to be abandoned simply because the group exhibited by Rubik's Cube is too large.
We can use the same ideas to map out any group, and in the next section we do just that.
1To store only the data (from which to later reconstruct text and images) would require approximately 1021
bytes, or one billion terabytes.

A not-so-famous toy
Allow me to introduce you to a puzzle much like Rubik's Cube. This puzzle has been
around much longer, but has a much less impressive name. It is called the rectangle, and
I'm sure you've heard of it before! Even though nearly everyone's mathematical education
includes rectangles at some early point, I provide a useful illustration in Figure 2.2, with
the corners of the rectangle conveniently numbered. The first thing to notice about this
puzzle is that it is much less complicated than Rubik's Cube, and so it might cooperate
better with our mapmaking aspirations.

Figure 2.2. A rectangle with its corners numbered
But first, to fully benefit from the upcoming discussion of the rectangle, you should
make one for yourself. Take an ordinary sheet of paper and label it with numbers in the
corners as shown in Figure 2.2. Making your own rectangle may sound unnecessary, but
we will be investigating flips and twists of this object in space, which are difficult to
picture accurately with the mind's eye alone. So go ahead and grab a piece of paper and
make your own personal (numbered) rectangle.
Here are the rules for the rectangle puzzle. Begin with the rectangle flat on a table,
on a desk, or in your lap so that you can read the four numbers, as in Figure2.2. Like the
Rubik's Cube, the rectangle puzzle starts out in its solved state|the way you have it now.
You will mix up the puzzle and your job will then be to return it to this original state.
The rectangle puzzle has two legal moves. You can flip the paper over horizontally
and you can flip it over vertically, as shown in Figure 2.3.2 In Chapter 3 I'll talk about

of such a flip. The bottom arrow illustrates a vertical flip; the lower right rectangle shows the result
of such a flip.
2 Readers familiar with axes of rotation may consider the naming convention in Figure2.3 backwards. Because I
have not yet introduced axes of rotation, I use a simpler naming convention. \Horizontal" and \vertical" describe
the motion of the player's hands, which follow the arrows in Figure 2.3.

2.3. Mapping a group
15
why these moves (and not others) make sense for the rectangle puzzle, but for now, let's
just call them the rules of the game. As with Rubik's Cube, you may feel free to repeat
and combine moves as much as you like. (In fact, you may have already noticed that the
moves in the rectangle puzzle form a group.)
Take a moment now to mix up your rectangle puzzle, and then solve it. This should
not take very long, but be sure you do not (accidentally) cheat! A natural mistake is to
pick up the rectangle and inspect it a bit, rotating it freely and experimentally until it
is solved. This move is rarely valid, and thus is not what you're supposed to be doing.
Making such a move is analogous to disassembling Rubik's Cube and reassembling it
solved. Remember that you are limited to the two moves in Figure 2.3 as you mix up the
puzzle and as you solve it.
Let's take a moment to verify that the moves in the rectangle puzzle form a group, and
to compare it to Rubik's Cube. Rule 1.5 requires a predefined list of moves, which we
have given: horizontal and vertical flips. Rule 1.6 requires that each move be reversible. It
holds true for the rectangle because in fact each move undoes itself. For example, if you
have performed a horizontal flip and wish to return to the previous state, simply perform
another horizontal flip. The same is true of vertical flips. Rule 1.7 requires that these moves
be deterministic, free from randomness, and they are because they are completely within
your control. Rule 1.8 requires that any possible combination of moves also be a valid
move. This rule is satisfied because a horizontal or vertical flip puts the rectangle into a
physical position from which either valid move is still possible. In contrast, if we were to
add the move \rip up the rectangle and throw it away," that would bring about a dead end;
no subsequent moves would be possible. Neither of our two moves has this problem; they
always permit further moves and thus allow us to string them together in any sequence.
In the next section we will map out the rectangle puzzle's group. But first, notice
how its physical construction contrasts with that of Rubik's Cube. The rectangle puzzle
requires you to place the rectangle on a flat surface, to remember its original orientation,
and to try to return to it. Rubik's Cube is not this way; you can toss it around the
room, drop it in your sock drawer, and when you come back to it, its configuration will
not have changed. The cube's moving parts internalize the puzzle, so that no external
reference (to a table, or an original orientation) is required. Because the rectangle puzzle
is a simple do-it-yourself rectangle made of paper, it has no moving parts and thus to
use it as a puzzle required external landmarks (the table and the original orientation you
remembered). We could design a puzzle that behaves identically to the rectangle puzzle,
but which is self-contained; it would just not be as easy to make at home.
2.3
Mapping a group
Mapmaking begins with exploration. We need to know the lay of the land if we are to draw
a useful map of it. Let's therefore explore the realm of the rectangle puzzle, and map it out
as we go. We will need to ensure that our exploration is thorough|that we find all possible
configurations of the rectangle puzzle|so we should conduct our search systematically.
Begin with the rectangle puzzle in its solved state (Figure 2.2). Our two moves
(horizontal and vertical flips) are our only means for exploring. They are the group's
generators, and our map will show how they generate the group.

16
2. What do groups look like?
Start exploring by performing a horizontal flip. Because our exploration has just
begun, this of course leads us to a configuration we have not yet mapped. But it is a
configuration that was originally introduced in Figure 2.3. Performing another horizontal
flip returns the rectangle to its original, solved state. Therefore let's begin making our
map with this information. Figure 2.4 shows a map of the terrain we have explored so far.
I use a two-way arrow to mean that from either of the two configurations in the figure,
a horizontal flip leads to the other configuration.

Figure 2.4. Partial map of the configurations of the rectangle puzzle, using only horizontal flips
These configurations are as far as we can go with horizontal flips alone. Keeping
with the exploration metaphor, we can say that we have found two places in the rectangle
realm. From each of these places, the map in Figure 2.4 tells us where a horizontal flip
will take us, but there is (so far) no information about where vertical flips lead. Our map
is not complete without such information, and so we must explore further.
Let's return to the rectangle in its solved state, and explore the results of vertical flips.
Figure 2.3 already tells us what vertical flips do, but let's be thorough and explore those
states as we add them to our map. From the solved state, a vertical flip leads to a new
state we have not yet visited, and from there a vertical flip returns the rectangle to the
solved state. We augment our map as shown in Figure 2.5.
Our map is still not complete, because we have not yet recorded where a vertical flip
leads from the upper right configuration in Figure 2.5. To explore from that configuration,
we first need to get our rectangle in that configuration. If you've been following along with
your own rectangle, we left it in the solved state, and can get to the upper right configu-
ration from Figure 2.5 by doing a horizontal flip|that's what our map tells us! After
that horizontal flip, we perform a vertical flip to see where it leads. This move is the first
exploration we've done whose outcome we could not predict from Figure 2.3. Perform
this move yourself and see where it leads. Does it lead to a new location we must add to
our map, or to a location we've already been? (You'll find the answer in Figure 2.6.)
Figure 2.6 contains four states of the rectangle, but the lower two have no \horizontal
flip" arrows leading to or from them. Therefore our map is still incomplete. For instance,
if your rectangle is like the lower left one in Figure 2.6, where does a horizontal flip lead
you? The map does not say; we still have work to do.
Use the map to get your rectangle to look like the lower left rectangle in Figure 2.6,
then perform a horizontal flip and see what configuration results. It is not a new config-
uration; it is the same one you discovered moments ago. Performing another horizontal
flip will, of course, get you back to the lower left rectangle from Figure 2.6. The final
map for the rectangle puzzle then looks like Figure 2.7. We can tell that our explorations
are complete because there are no unanswered questions. From every location, it is clear
from the map where every given move leads.

Figure 2.7. Full map of the configurations of the rectangle puzzle
You have just created your first map of a group! We have to admit that the map in
Figure 2.7 is a bit unnecessary, because the rectangle puzzle is easy to solve without a
map. But the map does serve to show us exactly the structure of the rectangle puzzle,
and to let us see why it is easy. (For instance, from the map, you can see that alternating
horizontal and vertical flips will walk you through every location in the rectangle realm.)
The map we made is also an excellent first example of how to map a group, and allows
us get our feet wet before we come upon more complicated groups.
2.4
Cayley diagrams
Maps like Figure 2.7 are called Cayley diagrams, after their inventor, Arthur Cayley,
a nineteenth century British mathematician. We will use Cayley diagrams extensively
throughout this book; they can be very potent visualization tools. It will help to begin by
noting some important facts about the Cayley diagram we just made. These facts may
seem obvious or uninteresting as far as they apply to the rectangle puzzle, because it
is a puzzle that is so easy to solve. But we will be making Cayley diagrams for more
complicated groups, and these facts will remain true.
The map in Figure 2.7 allows us to get from any place in the rectangle realm to any
other without any guesswork. For instance, suppose you wanted to get from the lower
right configuration to the solved configuration. From the map, you can see that there are
two different (short) paths you could follow (up and then left or left and then up). To
make use of the map, as you trace either of these paths on the map with your finger
or your eyes, obey the instructions on that path using your rectangle. Going up from the
lower right configuration, flip your rectangle vertically; then going left, flip it horizontally.
Doing so successfully navigates to your desired destination; the map could help you plan
and execute any such journey.

2.5. A touch more abstract
19
Recall also that we took pains to ensure that the map in Figure 2.7 is comprehensive.
There is no location in the rectangle realm that does not appear on the map. Our con-
struction of the map ensured this. We branched out from the starting position using each
generator, and then branched out from each of those positions using each generator again.
If the puzzle had been more complicated, we could have continued this process further,
exploring farther and wider until we had found every location in the realm. We know
our explorations are incomplete if our map fails to answer a question like \Where does
a horizontal flip take me from this location?" That is, if there is a location on your map
from which you have not yet explored where all moves lead, then your map is incomplete.
When all such questions are answered, the map is complete.
Cayley diagrams have the two important properties just discussed: they clearly show
all possible paths and they include every configuration. Just as the rectangle puzzle has a
map, every other group also has a map with the same two properties. From now on, I will
call such maps by their official name, Cayley diagrams. The most useful aspect of Cayley
diagrams is that they give a clear picture of the structure of a group. Seeing the Cayley
diagram of a group gives a much more immediate and complete idea of the group's size,
complexity, and structure than a simple prose description can. This illustrative power is
why we use them so frequently for learning about groups hereafter.
You can make a Cayley diagram for any group the way we made the one in Figure2.7.
Beginning at any one configuration or situation, explore carefully using each generator,
one at a time. Explore thoroughly and carefully, making a map as you go and labeling
the transitions between states with the moves that cause them. Continue until your map
contains no unanswered questions, as described above. Although Figures 2.4 through
2.7 are laid out nicely, the first time you draw a Cayley diagram it will probably be
disorganized. As you explore a realm for the first time, the Cayley diagram that evolves is
messy because you do not know in advance the simplest way to lay it out. Cayley diagrams
created by exploration need to be reorganized into a more symmetric or aesthetically
pleasing arrangement after the exploration is complete.
The exercises at the end of this chapter encourage you to make a few Cayley diagrams
using this exploratory technique. You will appreciate the previous paragraph more after
some personal involvement with this type of mapmaking. Feel free to jump ahead and do
the first few exercises now, and then return to this point in your reading.
2.5
A touch more abstract
It is important to get to the heart of the mapmaking concepts that we have just learned.
As Definition 1.9 makes clear, what is important about a group is the interactions of its
actions, not the specific situation that gave rise to those actions. Let me illustrate this fact
with an example. Consider two light switches side-by-side on a wall. You are allowed
two actions, flipping the first switch and flipping the second switch. This collection of
(two) actions generates a group; you can check the rules yourself. The map of this group
is shown in Figure 2.8.
You will notice that it has the same structure as the map of the configurations of the
rectangle puzzle from Figure 2.7. The four rectangle configurations have become four
light switch configurations, and the arrows labeled \horizontal flip" and \vertical flip"

20
2. What do groups look like?
flip switch 1
flip switch 1
flip switch 2
flip switch 2
Figure 2.8. Full map of the configurations of the two-light switch group
have become arrows labeled \flip switch 1" and \flip switch 2" respectively. But the
arrows connect the configurations in the same pattern as before, making a clear analogy
between Figures 2.7 and 2.8.
So although these two groups are superficially different, they are structurally the
same. The important lesson to learn here is that two different groups may have the same
structure, and that the Cayley diagrams help us see this. Therefore, in order for us to study
groups in the abstract, we wish to remove from our Cayley diagrams the details of the
practical situation from which they were constructed. After all, a group is a mathematical
structure, and mathematicians study groups as abstract (purely mathematical) objects. The
rectangle puzzle and the light switches example just help us anchor our abstract study in
something familiar.
So let's replace each rectangle in Figure2.7 with something purely meaningless, a spot
we will call a node. And we will replace the two different types of arrows (distinguished
by their labels \horizontal flip" and \vertical flip") with different colored connectors that
have no labels. (In fact, we can simplify even further by removing the arrowheads, since
all arrows point in both directions anyway; I'll still refer to these headless connectors as
\arrows.") The result is Figure 2.9, a Cayley diagram of a group, now shown pure and
without any trappings of the example from which we learned it. You will note that the
structure shown in Figure 2.9 is not only the heart of Figure 2.7, but also that of Figure 2.8.
This group in Figure 2.9 is called the Klein 4-group3. I chose it as our first group to
visualize because it was simple enough for us to map quickly and easily, and yet still have
some interesting structure. Figure 2.10 shows several other Cayley diagrams, to give you
3Also simply called the 4-group, and denoted V or V4 for vierergruppe, \four-group" in German. It is named
for the mathematician Felix Christian Klein.

a broader idea of what they tend to look like. As you can see, some are very simple, and
others very complex. This diversity in the diagrams is indicative of a range of complexities
in the underlying groups as well. You should not feel as if you must understand every
part of Figure 2.10 already; it is present as an example of what is to come.
My interest in group theory visualization led me to write Group Explorer, a free
software package that draws Cayley diagrams (and other illustrations you'll learn in
later chapters). Group Explorer is an optional (but helpful) interactive companion to this
book, and you can retrieve it from http://groupexplorer.sourceforge.net.
It provides a list of groups, and extensive information about each one, including at least
one Cayley diagram. Group Explorer creates Cayley diagrams using much the same
algorithm we did|it uses the rules of the group to follow arrows, exploring the realm,
and after it has found every location, it makes an attempt to arrange them presentably.
This chapter taught you your first technique for visualizing groups|the Cayley dia-
gram. We will explore applications of this technique in chapters to come, and will use
it extensively throughout our group theory studies. First, take some time to build your
understanding of Cayley diagrams using the following exercises.

Exercise
2.6. Exercise 1.13 described an infinite group which can be generated with
just one generator. Can you draw an infinite Cayley diagram for it? (Just draw a portion
of the diagram that makes the infinite repeating pattern clear.)
How does that Cayley diagram compare to one for the group in Exercise 1.14 part
(a)?
Exercise
2.7. Exercise 1.14 part (d) described a two-element group. Can you draw a
Cayley diagram for it? Which arrow or arrows should you use and why?
Exercise
2.8. Section 2.2 introduced the rectangle puzzle. Imagine instead a square
puzzle with its corners labeled the same way. Such a puzzle would allow a new move
that was not possible with the rectangle puzzle; you could rotate a quarter-turn clockwise.
(a) Make the map of this group.
(b) Why is the quarter-turn move not \allowed" in the rectangle puzzle?
Exercise 2.9. Most groups can be generated many different ways, and each way gives
rise to a corresponding way to connect a Cayley diagram with arrows. For example,
consider the group V4, which we met in the rectangle puzzle. Let's shorten the names
of its actions to n, h, v and b, meaning (respectively) no action, horizontal flip, vertical
flip, and both (a horizontal flip followed by a vertical flip).
We saw that h and v together generate V4. But it is also true that h and b together
would generate V4, or v and b together. (You can verify these facts by exploring the
rectangle realm using these generators on your own numbered rectangle.)
(a) Make a copy of Figure 2.9 and add to it a new type of arrow, representing the action
b.
(b) Make a copy of your answer to part (a), with the arrows representing h removed.
How does your diagram show that v and b are sufficient to generate V4?
(c) Make a copy of your answer to part (a), with the arrows representing v removed.
How does your diagram show that h and b are sufficient to generate V4?

Exercise 2.12. We have not yet seen a group whose Cayley diagram has the three-node
form called C3, shown in the top left of Figure 2.10. Can you come up with a group
whose Cayley diagram has that form?
2.6.4
Rules
Exercise 2.13. A group's generators have a special status in a Cayley diagram for the
group. What is that special status?
Exercise
2.14. Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.5, which states, \There is
a predefined list of actions that never changes." How does this rule impact the appear-
ance of Cayley diagrams? (Or how would diagrams be different if this rule were not a
requirement?)
Exercise 2.15. Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.6, which states, \Every action
is reversible." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name \Cayley diagram," except for that one rule violation.)
Exercise 2.16. Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.7, which states, \Every action
is deterministic." What constraint does this place on the arrows in a Cayley diagram? Can
you draw a diagram that does not fit this constraint? (That is, draw a diagram that almost
deserves the name \Cayley diagram," except for that one rule violation.)
Exercise 2.17. Chapter 1 required groups to satisfy Rule 1.8, which states, \Any sequence
of consecutive actions is also an action." How do we depend upon this fact when using
a Cayley diagram as a map?
2.6.5
Shapes
Exercise
2.18. If we created an equilateral triangle puzzle, like the square puzzle in
Exercise 2.8, what would the valid moves be? Map the group of such a puzzle.
Exercise 2.19. A regular n-gon is a polygon with n equal sides and n equal angles. You
have already analyzed regular n-gons with n D 3 (equilateral triangle, Exercise 2.18) and
n D 4 (square, Exercise 2.8).
(a) Based on what you know about the cases when n D 3 and n D 4, make a conjecture
about how many actions will be in the group of the regular n-gon for any n > 2.
(b) Test your conjecture by making the map of the group for a regular pentagon (n D 5).
(c) Find the equilateral triangle group, the square group, and the regular pentagon group
in Group Explorer's library. (Hint: Use the search feature.)
(i) Do your Cayley diagrams look like those in Group Explorer?
(ii) Does your conjecture hold up against all the data you can find in Group
Explorer?
(d) Write a paragraph giving as convincing an argument as you can in favor of your
conjecture. Try to anticipate the counterarguments of a skeptical reader.
The groups you studied in this exercise are called dihedral groups. We will return to them
in Exercise 4.9, and then formally study them in Chapter 5.

Why study groups?
The groups you've seen in this book so far may leave you wondering what the purpose of
group theory is. After all, the things we've studied have little value other than intellectual
amusement|games, puzzles, and imaginary situations like coins on a table. If group
theory were just a collection of intellectual amusements, anyone could be forgiven for
asking, \So what?"
The two chapters we've spent learning the basics have positioned us to learn some of
group theory's more practical applications. This chapter tours a few of those applications,
and provides references to where interested readers can go to explore any of them further.
After this chapter, our study of group theory will get more advanced, and I will return to
choosing examples based on how well they illustrate the material (rather than based on
how useful they are in the real world).
We will see applications of group theory in three different areas: science, art, and
mathematics. Further examples could have been included, but these are a good start.
Woven throughout all the examples you will see the notion of symmetry. After reading
this chapter, you will be well-equipped to identify and classify symmetry in the world
around you. Some of this chapter's exercises will encourage you to spot new objects and
situations to which group theory applies.
3.1
Groups of symmetries
We say something is symmetrical when it looks the same from more than one point of
view. For instance, humans have bilateral symmetry; our left and right sides are similar,
so we look (basically) the same in a mirror as we do face-to-face. Sea stars (starfish) have
pentaradial symmetry; their five alike arms radiate outward, separated by equal angles.
You can turn one a bit and it looks the same after the turn as before. (To be precise, turn
it 72 degrees, one fifth of a full 360 degree rotation.)
How does this relate to groups? The example groups we've looked at so far deal with
arrangements of similar things|the numbered corners of a rectangle, the colored squares

3. Why study groups?
on Rubik's Cube, the several paintings on a room's walls (Exercise 1.4)|and in Chapter
5, we will cover a foundational fact of group theory, that every group can be viewed as
a collection of ways to rearrange some set of things. Groups relate to symmetry because
an object's symmetries can be described using rearrangements of the object's parts. My
example of turning a sea star put each arm in a new location, and is thus a (simple)
rearrangement of the arms.
Mathematicians and scientists use groups to describe the symmetry in physical ob-
jects. The technique for finding a group that describes an object's symmetry has already
appeared in this book; you have seen it used with the rectangle puzzle in Chapter 2 and
tried something similar yourself in Exercises 2.8, 2.18, and 2.19. It's time this technique
had an official introduction. Definition 3.1 describes it thoroughly, and thereafter I explain
why the technique makes sense.
Definition 3.1 (technique for measuring symmetry). The following process extracts from
any physical object a group that describes the symmetry in that object.
1. Identify all the parts of the object that are similar, and give each such part a different
number. (The rectangle had four alike corners, so we numbered them. We could have
instead numbered the four sides, because the left is the same as the right and the top
is the same as the bottom.)
2. Consider the actions that you can perform with your hands that may rearrange the
numbered parts, but that leave the object taking up the same space it did originally.
(If the object is too large or small for your hands, imagine holding a perfectly scaled
model instead.) This collection of actions forms a group.
3. If you want to visualize the group, explore and map it as we did in Chapter 2 with
the rectangle, shown in Figures 2.2 through 2.7.
Reviewing how Chapter 2 applied this technique to the rectangle puzzle should help
clarify this definition. Figure 3.1 does just that.
Let's take a moment to consider this technique so that we can see the logic behind it.
Step 1 of Definition 3.1 numbers the object's parts so that we can track the manipulations
permitted in Step 2. That is, it enables us to distinguish all the object's different states from
one another, and to see how they relate. Note that new each state is a new arrangement of
the object's similar parts, a re-arrangement. The numbering allows us to clearly describe
each of these rearrangements, which would otherwise be indistinguishablefrom each other.
The heart of the technique lies in Step 2, which gives both freedom and restriction:
You should look for all manipulations of the object provided that it takes up the same
space. The freedom (in fact, the command) to find all manipulations ensures that we get
a complete description of the object's symmetry; to do so may require some exploration,
as it did in the case of the rectangle. The restriction to manipulations that take up no
new space ensures that our exploration pays attention to the object's shape. Recall that
symmetry is not only a set of similar parts, but also their arrangement. (A starfish is
more than just five alike arms in a pile!) The restriction in Step 2 ensures that this whole
technique respects the arrangement of the object's parts.
Step 2 defines a group that describes the symmetry in the original object. Step 3 is
optional, but we perform it in order to see the group, since we are studying group theory

Figure 3.1. In Chapter 2, we applied the technique in Definition 3.1 to the rectangle. A summary
of the steps we took is shown here as an example. Clearer illustrations of the rectangle's valid moves
and its map appear in Figures 2.3 and 2.7, respectively.
visually. Although we have already experienced this technique in Chapter 2 when we
studied the rectangle puzzle, now it is time to employ it for something more useful.
3.1.1
Shapes of molecules
Chemists need to classify the molecules they study by shape, because those shapes impact
the molecules' behavior. They use group theory to do so. This gives us a chance to apply
the technique in Definition 3.1 to something practical. Figure 3.2 represents a molecule of

Figure 3.2. A molecule of Boric acid, B.OH/3
Boric acid; the red ball is boron, the blue oxygen, and the green hydrogen. Let's measure
its symmetries as a chemist would, and find the group that describes them.
Step 1 of the technique in Definition 3.1 insists that we label the molecule's alike
parts|in the case of Boric acid, this means the three \arms." I have done so in Figure3.3.

Figure 3.3. The same molecule as in Figure 3.2, but now with each of the three identical arms
numbered, to distinguish them, as in Step 1 of Definition 3.1
Step 2 of Definition 3.1 requires us to ask what manipulations of this molecule are
available. As Step 2 instructs, we imagine holding a scale model of the molecule and
twisting it about. One of the first things to notice is that rotating one-third of a full circle
in either direction is a valid move, because the result occupies the same space as the shape
we started with; only the numbering has changed. (To help your mind's eye, see Figure
3.4.) On the other hand, we can find manipulations that are not admissable. For example,
a horizontal flip was legal in the rectangle puzzle (Figure 2.3, page 14), but is not legal
here. Figure 3.5 shows that a horizontal flip results in a shape that sits differently in space
than the original.

Rotating the numbered molecule from Figure 3.3 clockwise one-third of a full
rotation rearranges the numbering, but the molecule occupies the same space as before. Thus a
one-third turn is part of the group describing this molecule, as per Definition3.1.

Figure 3.5. Flipping the numbered molecule from Figure3.3 over horizontally situates the shape
differently in space. (The arms do not reach in the same directions as originally.) Thus a horizontal
flip is not part of the group describing this molecule, as per Definition3.1.
If we conducted a full exploration of this group, as we did when mapping out the
rectangle puzzle, we would generate a cyclic group with three actions, shown in Figure
3.6. It is satisfyingly natural that a molecule with three prongs like a propeller has a three-
step cyclic symmetry group. The term \cyclic" is not used casually here; it is actually a
technical term, although its meaning should be mostly obvious from Figure 3.6. We will
talk more about cyclic groups in Chapter 5.

we obtain the top left diagram in Figure 2.10, page 22, the cyclic group C3.
3.1.2
Crystallography
Of course, chemists study more than one molecule at a time. One of the easiest ways
for a chemist to learn about solids at the atomic level is to study solids whose atoms are
naturally well organized. Solids whose atoms arrange themselves in a regular, repeating
pattern are called crystals. The study of them is called crystallography.

30
3. Why study groups?
Figure 3.7. One cube from a crystal whose type chemists have named body-centered cubic.
Each white ball represents an atom (of lithium or sodium, for instance) and each line a bond
between atoms. The crystal structure formed by repeating many of these through space is shown in
Figure 3.8.
There are hundreds of three-dimensional crystal patterns, but let us take one example.
The atoms of several common elements (including sodium and lithium, for example)
arrange themselves in a grid of cubes when they form a solid, with an extra atom at the
center of each cube. This is called a body-centered cubic arrangement, and is shown in
Figure 3.7. Many of these cubes together form a crystal, as shown in Figure 3.8. The
cubes sit next to one another, and over and under one another, and in front of and in back
of one another, in all three dimensions, extending indefinitely. Where cubes touch faces,
they share the four atoms of the face between them.
The technique from Definition 3.1 can even be used to classify the symmetry of pat-
terns like this one. I will not do so complex an example here, but most of that complexity
comes from just one aspect of the crystal: that it seems to go on forever. Chemists study-
Figure 3.8. The cube from Figure 3.7 repeated to fill three-dimensional space. The different
colors of the lines have no chemical significance; they make it easier to distinguish the edges of
each cube from the diagonal lines through the cubes' centers.

ing crystals do indeed treat them as patterns that repeat without end, and thus the groups
describing them are infinite. Perhaps your curiosity is now aroused, and you're wishing
that I would do an example. That's good! Although I do not classify the symmetry of a
crystal, in the following section I give an example of classifying the symmetry of infinite
repeating patterns in one dimension. The interesting aspect of the example remains: How
do we deal with infinite objects, and what are infinite groups like?
The World Wide Web contains excellent resources for further investigation of the
group theory of molecules and crystals. One particular site that helped generate some of
the examples in this chapter is maintained by Jonathan Goss [10].
3.1.3
Art and Architecture
Crystals are patterns that repeat in three dimensions, but we can think of repeated patterns
that are not three-dimensional. Such repeating patterns appear in several areas of art. First,
let's consider simply patterns that repeat in only one direction, along a strip. Perhaps you
have seen such a pattern embroidered on the hem of a piece of clothing, or the edge of
a tablecloth. You may have seen a piece of jewelry composed of the same type of links
chained together. The cornices of some buildings are sculpted in a one-dimensional repeat-
ing pattern called a frieze. Mathematicians have adopted this term, and call all patterns that
repeat in one dimension frieze patterns and the groups that describe them frieze groups.
A simple frieze pattern is shown in Figure 3.9. It may not be intricate or beautiful enough
for you to want on your clothes or your house, but a simple first example is best. Although
Figure 3.9 only shows five leaves, the ellipses at either end of the diagram indicate that
one should imagine the pattern extending infinitely left and right.
â¦
â¦
Figure 3.9. A frieze pattern, which can be extended indefinitely to the left or right.
Applying the technique from Definition 3.1 to an infinite object will be a new experi-
ence for us. Step 1 of that technique asks us to number all the object's alike parts, which
can be a challenge if there are infinitely many! I number only those parts of the pattern
that are present in Figure 3.9, and use a numbering scheme that makes it obvious how you
could continue numbering in either direction if more of the frieze pattern were drawn. But
what are the alike parts of the pattern, which I must number? It might be tempting to say
that the leaves are the alike parts, but that is only half of the story. Each leaf is also itself
symmetrical, its left side like its right side. So the parts we need to number are actually
both sides of each leaf. Figure 3.10 shows a numbering that starts with 1 at the right side
of the center leaf and counts to the right. In mirror image fashion, it uses negative numbers
to go from the left of the center leaf to the left. If the vine were extended and more leaves
shown in either direction, it is clear how we could continue numbering them.

Figure 3.10. The frieze pattern from Figure 3.9, now with all alike parts labeled, as Step 1 of
Definition 3.1 requires.
Step 2 from Definition 3.1 instructs us to find the manipulations of the frieze that rear-
range the numbered parts but keep the shape occupying the same space. One such action
we have seen twice before|a horizontal flip. Just as Figure 2.3 showed that a horizontal
flip is a valid move for the rectangle, and Figure 3.5 showed that it is not a valid
manipulation of an atom of Boric acid, so Figure 3.11 shows that it is a valid move for
this frieze pattern. The second manipulation shown in Figure 3.11 has not yet appeared
in this book; it is called a glide reflection. To perform a glide reflection, move the pattern
to the right and then flip it vertically, as shown by the arrow in that figure. An upper leaf
moves to the right and then flips down to end up where the adjacent lower leaf had been.

Figure 3.11. The legal moves for the leaf frieze shape from Figure3.9, according to Step 2 of
Definition 3.1.
This glide reflection is the first time we have had any manipulation that involved
moving an object in any direction. This is because only with an infinite object is it
possible to move it and still have it look the same when the move is completed. Because
the pattern repeats infinitely along one axis, moves in that direction may not alter the
space it occupies. (Note that another legal manipulation is to move the center leaf twice
as far, to take the place of the right leaf, with no vertical flip involved. But this is the
same as two sequential glide reflections, so by including a glide reflection, we will end
up generating this move as well.)
If we carefully map the interactions among these two moves, as Step3 of Definition
3.1 recommends, we obtain a Cayley diagram of the group describing the symmetry in
this frieze pattern. Like the frieze pattern itself, the Cayley diagram is infinite and thus
we can only see a portion of it at one time, and must use ellipses to suggest how it could
be extended. We will not go through the details of the mapping out of such a diagram

Figure 3.12. A portion of the infinite Cayley diagram of the group of symmetries of the frieze
pattern in Figure 3.9.
here, as we did with the rectangle in Chapter 2. Figure 3.12 shows the resulting diagram,
the abstract version of which is shown in Figure 3.13.
The study of group theory has yielded a very interesting fact about frieze patterns.
The symmetry of any frieze pattern can be described by one of seven different infinite
groups.1 That is, although you may spend a lifetime creating new and different frieze
Figure 3.13. The abstract version of Figure 3.12. All the friezes and names of actions have
been removed, leaving only nodes representing different states, and two kinds of arrows connecting
them. The pattern of such connections, however, remains unchanged from Figure3.12 to here.
1Actually, some of the frieze groups are isomorphic to one another, a concept we will learn in Chapter8.
But the frieze groups that are isomorphic (i.e., have the same structure) are still different in the actions that
comprise them, and thus different in their visual appearance.

34
3. Why study groups?
patterns, the symmetry in each of those patterns can only be of one of seven different
types. Each such type is described by a group, one of which we just saw in Figures 3.12
and 3.13. Exercise 3.11 asks you to diagram the other six frieze groups, given six different
vine-and-leaf patterns that exemplify them.
This frieze example shows that the technique from Definition 3.1 is more broadly
applicable than it may at first have seemed|it can even apply to infinite objects! We
used it to measure the symmetries in a one-dimensional repeating pattern, and mentioned
earlier that chemists use it to classify the three-dimensional repeating patterns that occur
naturally in crystals. Just as frieze patterns can be described by one of seven frieze groups,
so crystal patterns can be described by one of 230 crystallographic groups [19]. As you
may therefore suspect, we can also classify two-dimensional repeating patterns with the
same technique, yielding one of what are appropriately called the 17 wallpaper groups.
Two-dimensional repeating patterns, like those found in wallpaper, will not be inves-
tigated in depth here. Although the technique from Definition 3.1 can be applied to such
patterns in principle, it takes a great deal of patience and a very large piece of paper. Such
diagrams have several different types of arrows, and extend infinitely in two directions,
like the wallpaper patterns they describe. They can be very tangled.
But notice the specific import generators have in visualization: a Cayley diagram for
a group relies on having a small set of generators to use as arrows. A Cayley diagram is
a map of the group, and the arrows are the roads. So on the one hand, if the set of actions
we use as arrows does not generate the whole group, then there will be some unreachable
nodes, and the diagram will not be connected. On the other hand, including an arrow for
every action in a group would typically clutter diagrams beyond readability. (In fact, in
infinite groups it simply could not be done!) A set of generators provides a few arrow
types that still connect all the nodes; this is what makes Cayley diagrams possible.
3.2
Groups of actions
This book introduced groups with two examples, Rubik's Cube and the rectangle. The
example applications we've seen so far in this chapter are like Rubik's Cube and the
rectangle in that they deal with physical objects with inherent symmetry. Therefore each
application so far has seen use of Definition 3.1 to find and illustrate the groups describing
the symmetry of some physical object.
But the definition of a group we learned in Chapter 1 is not restricted only to the
symmetry of physical objects. Any collection of actions satisfying the rules from Defintion
1.9 is a group. Indeed, some important examples of group theory (and some fun ones) do
not involve the symmetry of a physical object at all. This second section of the chapter
briefly shows two such examples.
3.2.1
Dancing
Several traditional styles of country dancing involve predefined steps called figures that
move couples around the dance floor. In square dancing and contra dancing, the dancers
learn these steps by name and practice following a caller who orders them to perform
specific figures in time with the music. In both these kinds of dances, couples stand in
pairs forming a box, as shown in Figure 3.14.

Figure 3.14. The arrangement of two couples in a square, ready to begin a square dance or a
contra dance.
Dancing a figure rearranges the dancers. If they correctly obey the caller, every dance
ends with the dancers back to the locations in which they began the dance. Figure 3.15
shows the effects of six example contra dance figures. The particular steps are not shown,
only the effect the figure has on the dancers' arrangements.
The collection of all such figures turns out to form a group. That is, all the criteria
from Definition 1.9 are satisfied by the collection of contra dance figures. Furthermore,
that group has the same structure as the group describing the symmetries of a square
(D4). In other words, the Cayley diagrams of both groups have the same shape, but with
different names on the nodes and arrows. When two groups have the same structure, we
say they are isomorphic, a topic we will study in Chapter 8.
Readers interested in learning more about the group theory in dance figures can begin
with the Exercises in Section 3.4.4 of this chapter. Further reading is available on the
World Wide Web; the author has found the website of Larry Copes [5] and an article by
Ivars Peterson [15] particularly informative.

3. Why study groups?
3.2.2
Polynomial roots
By now the reader is certainly convinced that group theory shows up in diverse situations.
But it would be a great disservice to the history of mathematics if I did not mention one
more application, the very reason that group theory was invented! In the nineteenthcentury,
two young mathematical prodigies, Neils Abel and Evariste Galois, solved a mathematical
problem that had stood unsolved for centuries. It has come to be called \the unsolvability
of the quintic." It is one of the great discoveries in mathematics, and when you come to
Chapter 10 of this book, you will be ready to read about it in some detail. It rests on the
fact that the solutions to polynomial equations have a certain relationship to one another.
They form a group.
Galois did not call the patterns he noticed groups; later mathematicians who extended
his work gave them that name. But he was the first to notice them and study them. Galois
found groups when studying the roots of polynomials, but since his day mathematicians
have found a multitude of other contexts in which groups arise, some of which you have
just read about.
As in contra dancing, the actions in the groups Galois studied are not manipulations of
a physical object, but instead rearrangements of a collection of things. Instead of dancers,
Galois was rearranging the solutions to polynomial equations. The remarkable discovery
he made was that by examining the group of those rearrangements, you could tell how
difficult it was to solve the original equation. Some groups, he proved, correspond to
equations that are impossible to solve.2
This brief mention of the work of Galois, skipping many details (including Abel's
contribution), is included here for two reasons. First, it gives you a bit of the historical
origins of the subject, which are themselves group theory's first application. Second, you
now have something to look forward to as your study of group theory progresses; the end
of this book describes some famous, deep, and beautiful mathematics. The intervening
chapters prepare you for it.
3.3
Groups everywhere
This chapter has applied group theory to chemistry, visual art, dancing, and mathematics.
From these applications, it is clear that group theory arises in diverse contexts, yet these
examples are just a few from among the many applications of group theory. There is
neither space nor need to cover all the applications of group theory here, but I mention
some in passing, so that readers interested in a specific application know where to look
for more information.
We saw two ways that groups are useful to chemists|molecular shape and crystal
structure. Another way chemists use group theory is for studying and enumerating isomers,
using Polya's technique. A paper of Kennedy, McQuarrie, and Brubaker [12] gives a good
overview of this technique with references to sources with more detail. Theoretical physics
has used group theory when looking at fundamental particles [4, 17].
Section 3.2.2 revealed that the birth of group theory was in the solution to a famous
mathematical problem from algebra. Since then, several other branches of mathematics
2Exactly what \impossible" means in this context is described in Chapter 10.

3.4. Exercises
37
have made use of groups as well; I mention a few examples. Group theory has tight
connections to linear algebra (which can describe spatial manipulations, like some of our
group actions) and number theory (in which we will dabble in Section 8.3). Topology, the
abstract study of shapes and spaces, with applications in physics, astronomy, and else-
where, uses groups to categorize spaces and shapes. The textbook Group Representations
in Probability and Statistics covers uses of group theory in probability and statistics [7].
Subgroups and cosets (topics from Chapter 6) can be used to design error-correcting
codes, which help minimize error in transmitted messages. Every time you download a file
from the Internet, your computer uses codes like these to keep your download uncorrupted
by minor noise or static on the network lines.
David Benson's book Music: A Mathematical Offering [2] contains a chapter on the
application of group theory to music. It uses many different results from group theory,
from introductory through advanced. The technique mentioned above that chemists use
to count isomers, Benson uses to enumerate pitch classes with certain properties.
I could continue with further examples from poetry, juggling, sudoku, and more. But
the point has been made. Symmetry is everywhere, and group theory makes an essential
contribution to the study of symmetry. Our eyes can spot symmetry, but the measuring
technique from this chapter takes us beyond just spotting it. Cayley diagrams show that an
object's symmetries are not a disordered collection, but relate in what are often intricate
and beautiful ways. Group theory studies those relationships mathematically and uses
them to solve diverse problems.

Exercises
3.4.1
Basics
Exercise 3.1. Consider the six contra dance figures shown in Figure3.15. Which of them,
if any, when repeated twice in succession, return the dancers to their original positions?
Which, if any, do not return the dancers to their original positions until the move is
repeated three times? Four? Do any figures require more repetitions than four to return
the dancers to their original positions?
Exercise
3.2. Consider the horizontal flip shown on top of Figure 3.11. What is the
effect of repeating that action twice in succession? How is the glide reflection shown in
the same figure different?
Exercise 3.3. Figure 3.4 shows that if you rotate a boric acid molecule clockwise one-
third of a full turn, it takes up the same space as it did originally. This clockwise rotation
generates the Cayley diagram shown in Figure 3.6. How would the diagram be different
if I had generated it with a counterclockwise rotation instead? Would the group size or
structure change?
Exercise
3.4. Name three physical manipulations you could do to the cube in Figure

The symmetry of molecules
Exercise 3.5. Apply the technique from Definition 3.1 to a molecule of ethylene, shown
below. (Include the optional Step 3.) Where have we seen the resulting group before and
what is its name?
The chemical formula for ethylene is C2H4; the dark atoms indicate carbon and the light
blue atoms indicate hydrogen. A scale model of this molecule would lie flat on a table;
it has no depth.
Exercise 3.6. Apply the technique from Definition 3.1 to a molecule of sulfur chloride
pentafluoride, shown below. As in the previous exercise, perform the optional Step 3.
We have not named the resulting group so far in this book; can you find it in Group
Explorer?
The chemical formula for sulfur chloride pentafluoride is SF5Cl; the yellow atom indicates
sulfur, the white indicates chlorine, and the magenta atoms indicate fluorine.
Exercise 3.7. Repeat the previous exercise on a molecule of benzene, as shown below.
The chemical formula for benzene is C6H6; the dark atoms indicate carbon and the light
blue atoms indicate hydrogen. A scale model of this molecule would lie flat on a table;
it has no depth.

all possible symmetries for frieze patterns. The diagram of one such group appears in
Figures 3.12 and 3.13.

If so, which contra dance figure should you choose? If not, how many more contra
dance figures beyond \Ladies' chain" would you need?

Algebra at last
So far you have been learning about groups in a way that is unique to this book. Our
unofficial definition of a group, Definition 1.9, is not how mathematicians define a group.
Though there are many benefits to the approach I have taken (and will continue using
later), it would be an incomplete education in group theory that did not acquaint you with
the official definition of a group, the one you would find in any other group theory book.
That standard definition comes with its own natural visualization technique, called a
multiplication table. Since we are focusing on visualization, multiplication tables will be
our inroad to the study of the standard definition of a group. But there is some background
material we must cover first, in Sections 4.1 and 4.2.
4.1
Where have all the actions gone?
In the Cayley diagrams we made in Chapter 2, actions in a group showed up in the
diagram as arrows. But in a typical Cayley diagram there were only arrows for some of
a group's actions, specifically the generators. Multiplication tables will fill an important
gap in our study by allowing us to see all the actions in a group and how they interact
with each other.
To see why Cayley diagrams do not illustrate all of a group's actions, recall Rule 1.8
on page 6, which stipulated that any combination of actions is also an action in its own
right. So, for example, even though Chapter 2 introduced the rectangle puzzle as having
two actions (horizontal and vertical flips), it is also legal to flip first horizontally and then
vertically. Furthermore, this combination can be thought of as one single action. But the
Cayley diagram for the rectangle puzzle (Figure 2.7 on page 18) does not include arrows
for this combined action. It only illustrates the two generators that were introduced with
the puzzle, horizontal and vertical flips. This subtle point was addressed in Exercise 2.13:
generators receive special treatment in Cayley diagrams, because they are represented by
the diagram's arrows. I encourage you to reexamine Figure2.7 briefly to verify this fact
and your understanding of it.
41

4. Algebra at last
Figure 4.1. An annotated copy of Figure 2.7 from page 18. Above each rectangle in the figure
appears a phrase describing an action that leads there from the starting point.
Although Cayley diagrams do not show us every action in a group directly, they do
display the full set of actions indirectly. Every location in a Cayley diagram such as Figure
2.7 naturally correlates with the action that leads to that location. Therefore the full set
of actions is implicitly present in the diagram as the locations to which they lead. Let us
alter the diagram in Figure 2.7 to explicitly demonstrate this point. Figure 4.1 is a copy
of Figure 2.7 in which each rectangle configuration has been labeled with the name of
an action that leads there from the starting configuration. This makes the correspondence
between the locations and the actions that lead to them clear. Take a careful look at Figure
4.1 now and compare it to Figure 2.7. Note that the starting configuration is associated
with the action \none," because to get there from the start, simply do nothing!
Removing the rectangles and leaving only the annotations, as in Figure 4.2, has the
effect of making the diagram no longer be about configurations, but about actions. If you
prefer, it has changed from a diagram about nouns to one about verbs. Figure 4.2 does
not include arrow labels because they would be redundant. To distinguish \vertical flip"
arrows from \horizontal flip" ones at a glance, the vertical arrows are dashed. We can
infer which arrow is which by the actions they connect: Because the solid arrow points
from the start to \horizontal flip," it must symbolize the horizontal flip action, and thus
the dashed arrow symbolizes the vertical flip.
Diagrams like Figure 4.2 will become very useful to us in the next section, so let us
take a careful look at that diagram before proceeding. The following definition summarizes
the transformation that turned Figure 2.7 into Figure 4.2. As you read it, look over Figures
2.7, 4.1, and 4.2 to be sure that you see how each part of the definition plays out in that
example.

4.1. Where have all the actions gone?
43
Figure 4.2. A simplified copy of Figure 4.1. The rectangles themselves have been removed, and
replaced by the actions that led to them. The labels on the arrows have become superfluous, and
were therefore removed. The two types of arrows are now distinguished by dashed vs. solid lines.
Definition 4.1 (diagram of actions). The following three steps transform a Cayley dia-
gram into one that focuses on the group's actions.
(i) Choose any node and call it the \start." A natural choice for starting node often
exists, as it did in the rectangle puzzle.
(ii) Relabel each remaining node in the diagram with a path that leads there from the
start.
(iii) Remove the arrow labels, and distinguish arrows in some other way (e.g., by color
or using solid lines vs. dashed lines).
Let us call the result of such a transformation a diagram of actions.
The transformation described in Definition 4.1 can be done to any Cayley diagram,
even a purely abstract one, such as the diagram of the Klein 4-group in Figure 2.9 on page
21. (Recall that the lines in Figure 2.9 lack arrowheads, for simplicity and to indicate
bidirectionality. We'll call them arrows nonetheless.) We will need to refer to the different
colored arrows in some way, in order to speak of paths in the diagram. Let's write R for
red arrow and B for blue. Applying the transformation in Definition 4.1 results in Figure
4.3. As a test of your understanding of Definition 4.1, check that Figure 4.3 is the correct
result of transforming Figure 2.9 into a diagram of actions.
Figure 4.3. The result of labeling nodes according to \actions" (in this case the colors of the
diagram's arrows) in the abstract Cayley diagram from Figure2.9 on page 21. The group shown is
the Klein 4-group V4, which we first encountered in Chapter 2.

44
4. Algebra at last
4.2
Combine, combine, combine
The diagram of actions for a group presents new information to us, information about the
relationships among the actions in the group. In fact, we will soon see that diagrams of
actions, like Figure 4.3, can be used as a simple kind of calculator. They calculate the
effect of combining any two of the group's actions.
It may seem strange to say that Figure 4.3 has actions in it, since it is an abstract
diagram. Of course, we expect mathematics to be abstract at times, but concrete cir-
cumstances help ground our understanding. So recall that we saw concrete examples in
Sections 2.2 through 2.5 that fit the abstract pattern in Figure 4.3. Here in this abstract
case, the \actions" are just following red and blue arrows in the diagram (called actions
R and B respectively). To see how any two actions combine, simply begin at the starting
node (N for none) and perform the two actions one after the other. This is how we can
use Figure 4.3 as a calculator.
For example, we can verify that \R followed by B" has the same effect as \B followed
by R." Use the diagram to follow the red (R) arrow from the start node, and then the
blue (B) arrow. This ends us at the RB node. Now verify for yourself that B followed by
R leads from the start to the same place. Thus those two different phrases, \R followed
by B" and \B followed by R," really describe equivalent actions, because they have the
same final result.
It is common to express this relationship using notation that comes from algebra. (In
fact, group theory is usually studied in a very algebraic way, as this chapter will continue
to show, and hence falls under the mathematical subject area called abstract algebra.) To
say \R followed by B" we write RB as if we were multiplying two variables in algebra;
to say \B followed by R" we will just write BR. Then the sentence
\R followed by B" is equivalent to \B followed by R"
can be written clearly and concisely as
RB D BR:
This observation is a very simple one, but Figure 4.3 can also calculate more complex
relationships among the group's actions. Consider, for instance, the lengthy sequence
of actions RRRBRRBBB. We can use common conveniences of algebraic notation to
write this same sequence of actions more concisely, as R3BR2B3, again as if we were
multiplying variables in algebra. Figure 4.3 can simplify this lengthy sequence as well.
Beginning at the start, perform the given sequence of actions|follow the red arrow three
times, then the blue once, the red twice, and finally blue three times. You should end up
at the node labeled R, which gives us the equation
R3BR2B3 D R:
We have used the diagram of actions as a calculator to do a multiplication problem; we
multiplied R3 times B times R2 times B3 and found it to equal R. Any diagram of
actions (as in Definition 4.1) can be used as a calculator in this same way.
(Perhaps you're wondering whether it's okay to simplify R3BR2B3 further and write
it as R5B4. Find out for yourself whether those two expressions mean the same thing by
trying the technique just described.)

4.3. Multiplication tables
45
Now it's becoming clear why group theory is part of algebra|these equations actually
look like algebra. But there is an important difference to keep in mind. Although we
write RB as if it is a multiplication of R and B, we use \multiplying" metaphorically|
we're really combining the actions by doing them sequentially. I will continue to use
the term \multiplication" in this loose way throughout this book. Using common names
like multiplication and addition as placeholders for abstract operations is common in
mathematics.
The equation R3BR2B3 D R (and each of an endless supply like it that we could
come up with) is a fact about how the actions in the group combine. The method we used
for finding that equation shows us that we don't need to worry about long, complicated
sequences of actions like R3BR2B3, because no matter how lengthy a sequence of actions
we write down, our diagram of actions will always help us simplify it to an equivalent
action from among R, B, RB, or N .
4.3
Multiplication tables
Knowing how to use a diagram of actions as a calculator for a group is like having a
secret decoder ring|you can read facts from a diagram of actions because you know
the secret. But the purpose of visualization is not to keep secrets; it is to make things
clear. Let's therefore create a table containing all the information about how group actions
combine so that we no longer need to know the secret of how to read that information
from a Cayley diagram.
Such a table, which shows how every pair of group actions combine, is called a mul-
tiplication table. Recall how a gradeschool multiplication table looks; if you've forgotten,
see Figure 4.4. We wish to make a multiplication table with group actions in place of
numbers, and in which \multiplication" means combining two actions one after the other,
as above.
Continuing with the group shown in Figure 4.3 as our example, the four actions we
need to be concerned with are N , R, B, and RB. So we make a table analogous to Figure
4.4, but with N , R, B, and RB as row and column headings; see Figure 4.5. We can fill
the table by calculating the combinations of various pairs of actions, using Figure 4.3.
For example, in the R row and the B column, we write the result of combining R and B,
Figure 4.4. A standard elementary-school multiplication table, in this case only showing how
to multiply the numbers 1 through 6.

46
4. Algebra at last
Figure 4.5. Beginning to create a multiplication table for the group V4, whose Cayley diagram
appears in Figure 4.3
which is RB. In the RB row and the RB column, we write the result of combining RB
and RB, which is N . In performing the computations leading to these answers, Figure
4.3 is our calculator. Completing the whole table in this manner results in Figure 4.6.
Because N stands for \no action," combining it with another action has no effect,
e.g., NB D B. For this reason, the first row and column of Figure 4.6 are just multiplica-
tion by N , and thus simply repeat the headings. This makes the row and column headings
superfluous. It is therefore possible to omit those headings, and write the table as on the
right of Figure 4.6. The row and column headings have become part of the table itself, its
first row and column. This convention is used by Group Explorer because it makes the
table simpler. But the headings can be a useful reference, so later multiplication tables in
this book include them.
Figure 4.6. On the left, a completed version of the multiplication table begun in Figure4.5.
Each entry can be computed using Figure 4.3 as a calculator. On the right, the same table with row
and column headings removed, because they appear as the first row and column of the remaining
table anyway.
Multiplication tables are a potent new visualization technique because they reveal
patterns in the way the actions in the group combine, something Cayley diagrams do not
explicitly do. To make such patterns visually obvious, it helps to color the cells of the
multiplication table systematically. Assigning a different color to each action in the group
enables us to color each cell according to the action that appears there. Figure 4.7 shows
six multiplication tables colored in this way. The six groups depicted in the tables are the
same depicted by the six Cayley diagrams in Figure 2.10 on page 22.
For now, the patterns in Figure 4.7 are of purely visual interest, but we will study
them more in chapters to come. What remains in this chapter is to use multiplication
tables as an inroad to the standard definition of a group.

The classic definition
Group theory is usually not introduced the way this book introduces it. It is only after
covering several chapters of fundamentals that most textbooks reveal that every group
can be seen as a collection of actions, the way this book introduces them. Most textbooks
introduce groups by stating the official definition of a group, Definition 4.2 on page 51.
It uses very mathematical language, which has the advantage of being very precise but
the disadvantage of being difficult to penetrate, especially for newcomers. Because that
standard definition lends itself more easily to constructing multiplication tables than does
our definition (Definition 1.9 on page 7), we can take advantage of our recent acquaintance
with multiplication tables to ease its introduction.
We have been calling the objects in a group \actions" because our definition requires
a group to be a collection of actions (with certain additional restrictions). But the standard
definition of a group is not based on actions. So we need to use more general terminology;
we'll call the objects in a group the elements of the group. This is a mathematical term;
mathematicians call collections of objects \sets" and the things in them \elements."
Along with this terminology comes some useful notation. To say that N is one of the
elements of the group V4, the standard notation is
N 2 V4:
The symbol 2 looks like an \e" in reference to the word \element." This is pronounced
\N is an element of V4." This terminology and notation is used not only in Definition
4.2 but in the remainder of this book and throughout mathematics in general.
In addition to this new terminology, let us also revive some old terminology. The
previous section taught us that multiplication tables show how to combine any two group
elements into one. Mathematicians call a method for combining objects an \operation,"
a word familiar to high-school algebra students. Such students learn the \order of oper-
ations," that multiplication and division must be done before addition and subtraction.
These are the four basic operations of arithmetic|each takes two numbers and combines
them in some way to produce a new number (e.g., 2 C 3 D 5 or 6:3  7 D 0:9). Be-
cause each of the operations mentioned here combines two things into one, we can more
specifically call them binary operations.
The combining of group elements, as depicted in a multiplication table, is also a
binary operation. We say it is a binary operation on the elements of the group, meaning
that it can combine any two of those elements to yield another one. We've been writing
this binary operation using multiplicative notation (R combined with B written as RB).
Other common ways to denote group operations include additive notation R C B and
other creative symbols such as R  B and R  B. As long as the writer is consistent, the
particular symbol used matters little.
These two new terms, element and operation, are central to Definition 4.2, and know-
ing them better prepares us to understand that definition. Interested readers can find more
formal definitions of set and operation in nearly any textbook on discrete mathematics,
or in a more traditional introductory group theory textbook.
Every multiplication table depicts a binary operation; it shows it to us in full. That's
what multiplication tables do|they have two axes (across and down), because the op-

Figure 4.8.
Can you figure out which of these two multiplication tables depicts the binary
operation for a group? To learn how, read Sections 4.4.1 and 4.4.2 and then try the exercises in
Section 4.5.3 on page 55.
eration is binary. But because the multiplication tables we're studying depict groups,
they will reflect the defining characteristics of a group from Definition 1.9. Not just any
square grid with symbols in it is the multiplication table for a group. In fact, two distinct
features distinguish those tables that depict groups from those that do not. Sections 4.4.1
and 4.4.2 cover those features, and enable us better to understand Definition 4.2. But if
you like thinking ahead, try figuring out which of the two multiplication tables in Figure
4.8 depicts a group. (And what's wrong with the one that does not?)
4.4.1
Associativity
Recall the example from page 44 in which we simplified the sequence R3BR2B3. Al-
though we simplified it to one basic operation, R, we can actually write lots of less
significant simplifications. Here are a few examples.
R3BR2B3 D RBR2B3
(because R3B D RB)
R3BR2B3 D R3BB3
(because BR2 D B)
R3BR2B3 D R3BB
(because R2B3 D B)
In the first simplification on the list, we're concentrating on the R3B at the beginning of
R3BR2B3, and simplifying it alone. We might draw our attention to it with parentheses,
like this.
.R3B/R2B3 D .RB/R2B3
What is in parentheses on the left-hand side has been simplified to what is in parentheses
on the right-hand side. Writing the parentheses didn't change the meaning of the equation
at all; it just made it easier to understand. Parentheses are permitted anywhere but required
nowhere.
Because group operations permit parentheses for clarity but neither require them nor
have their meaning changed by parentheses, we say that group operations are associative.
That is, you may associate any portion of a multiplied chain of elements together without
changing the meaning. The two other examples above are rewritten parenthesized here.
R3.BR2/B3 D R3.B/B3
R3B.R2B3/ D R3B.B/

50
4. Algebra at last
Not all binary operations are associative. For instance, consider subtraction of whole
numbers.
4   .2   5/ Â¤ .4   2/   5
Because the placement of parentheses in this chain of subtractions changes the result,
subtraction is not associative. When subtracting, parentheses matter, unlike when adding,
or when combining group elements.
Combining actions in sequence is always associative, and thus group operations are
always associative. This is the first of two special properties every group operation must
have; the second is discussed below. Together they form the heart of Definition 4.2.
Several exercises at the end of this chapter will help you get to know how multiplication
tables for groups display both associativity and inverses.
4.4.2
Inverses
Rule 1.6 in Definition 1.9 requires each group element to be reversible. That is, given any
group element, you should also be able to find its opposite, which we call its inverse. If
you perform an action and then perform its inverse, the end result is the same as if you
had done nothing at all. In Rubik's Cube, for instance, the inverse of a clockwise turn
for a face is a counterclockwise turn of the same face. Doing the one and then the other
has no impact on the state of the cube; it is equivalent to having taken no action.
In order to write this principle down using algebraic notation, we need a symbol that
means \no action." In the multiplication tables I made for V4, I used N for \no action;"
often group theory textbooks use 0, 1, or e instead. This special element of a group is
called the identity element. In this book I will usually write e for the identity. (Do not
confuse this use of the lowercase letter e with its other common use in mathematics.
The Euler number e D limn!1
 1 C 1
n
n  2:271828 is used for computing compound
interest, radioactive decay, etc.)
Having this symbol enables us to write equations saying that every element of a group
has an inverse. As an example, consider the group S3, whose multiplication table appears
in Figure 4.7. Using the notation in that multiplication table, with e as the identity, we
can write equations showing each element of S3 has an inverse. Here are six equations,
one for each element of S3. The first equation, for example, shows that r can be undone
by r2|so r2 is the inverse of r.
r.r2/ D e
.r2/r D e
ff D e
.f r/.f r/ D e
.f r2/.f r2/ D e
ee D e
In this group, elements such as f and f r are their own inverses, but two are not, r
and r2. Instead, they are one another's inverses. All of these equations could have been
written without parentheses, due to associativity, but I chose to add them for clarity.

4.4. The classic definition
51
The group V4 is a more unusual example, because every element in it is its own
inverse. (Think of the rectangle puzzle|any flip twice changes nothing.)
NN D N
RR D N
BB D N
.RB/.RB/ D N
The fact that every element of a group has an inverse is the second of two key facts in
Definition 4.2, the first being associativity, covered in the previous section. This chapter's
exercises will also give you a chance to examine the impact of this fact on the appearance
of multiplication tables. But now, we are ready to read and analyze the classic definition
of a group.
4.4.3
Putting it all together
Definition 4.2 (group). A set G is a group if the following criteria are satisfied.
1. There is a binary operation  on G.
2. That operation is associative | i.e., for any elements a; b; c 2 G, the equation
.a  b/  c D a  .b  c/ is true.
3. There is an identity element e 2 G. That is, for any other element g 2 G, the
equations e  g D g and g  e D g are true.
4. Every element g 2 G has an inverse, written g 1, and the equations g  g 1 D e
and g 1  g D e are true.
Part (1) of this definition essentially says \a group is a multiplication table." Part (2)
restricts attention only to those multiplication tables that display associative operations, as
explained in Section 4.4.1. Part (4) says that every element has an inverse (as in Section
4.4.2) and it depends upon the notion of an identity element (also from Section 4.4.2),
required by Part (3).
Notice that a new notation has been introduced|g 1 means the inverse of the group
element g. So, for instance, in V4, we could write
R 1 D R;
and in S3, we could write
r 1 D r2:
In any group, e 1 D e. Can you see why the definition makes this true?
The discussions leading up to this point have made it clear that Definitions 1.9 and 4.2
are very related. But are they really the same? That is, if Definition1.9 says that something
is a group, will Definition 4.2 agree? Or vice versa? The previous two sections constitute
an informal argument for why the answer to the first question must be yes. But we will
return to this and definitively answer the second question also when we cover permutation
groups in Chapter 5.

Past, Present, Future
This chapter has provided an important new outlook on our subject matter. We can now
think of groups using either of two equally correct paradigms, as a collection of actions
or as a set with a binary operation. Each has its own advantages, and sometimes a group
theoretic fact is more clear from one viewpoint than from the other. Thus it is good
to have both at our disposal as we proceed into the next few chapters, which get into
more serious study of groups and unearth some of the famous theorems of this branch
of mathematics. But at present, it is time to exercise the new viewpoint on group theory
this chapter has given us.

Exercise 4.8. Exercises 2.4 through 2.8 of Chapter 2 asked you to draw Cayley diagrams
for three groups. Use the diagrams you drew to make multiplication tables for those same
groups. Note that if your diagram is not yet a diagram of actions, you may need to apply
the transformation in Definition 4.1.
Exercise 4.9. Exercises 2.18 and 2.19 of Chapter 2 asked you to find the pattern describ-
ing the sequence of Cayley diagrams for the \n-gon puzzle." I mentioned in that exercise
that the family of groups describing such puzzles are called the dihedral groups. You will
study them in detail in Chapter 5, and this exercise previews some of that material.
Find the pattern describing the sequence of multiplication tables for those same groups.
You might consider the following steps.
(a) Create multiplication tables from the Cayley diagrams for triangle, square, and regular
pentagon puzzles.
(b) Discern a pattern and describe it. This will be your conjecture about n-gons for n > 5.
(c) Return to the group library in Group Explorer and investigate the same groups as in
Exercise 2.19. (If you do not remember which ones they are, you can use the search
feature again and look up \triangle," \square," etc.)
(i) Do your multiplication tables from part (a) agree with those in Group Explorer?
Note that Group Explorer may have used different names for the elements of
the group than you did, and may have chosen a different order for the rows
and columns, but the pattern in the table should be the same. You can rename
elements and reorder the rows and columns in Group Explorer's multiplication
tables to help with the comparison.
(ii) Does your conjecture about the pattern of multiplication tables for n-gons with
n > 5 hold up against all the data you can find in Group Explorer? (This
includes groups other than the three you just examined.)
(d) Can you give a convincing reason why the conjecture you made ought to be true?
4.5.3
Almost tables

Exercise 4.14. The following multiplication table does not depict a binary operation on
the set fe; x; yg. The reason is part of the definition of a binary operation; we would say
that this binary operation lacks closure. Can you spot the problem and explain it in your
own words?

4.5. Exercises
57
Exercise
4.15. Why can the same element not appear twice in any row of a group's
multiplication table? Does this restriction also apply to columns?
Exercise 4.16. Exercises 2.14 through 2.17 on page 24 asked you to translate the rules
from Definition 1.9 into criteria about diagrams. The goal was to create criteria for judging
whether a diagram was a Cayley diagram|i.e., whether it represented a group.
This exercise will show that the answers to Exercises 2.14 through 2.17 are not
sufficiently restrictive. That is, there are diagrams that satisfy those criteria but are not
Cayley diagrams for any group. Consider the two diagrams shown below, neither of which
is a valid Cayley diagram.
(a) Does each diagram meet all the criteria that were your answers to Exercises 2.14
through 2.17?
(b) Try to convert each of these diagrams into a multiplication table. What problem arises
in each case?
(c) Can you explain what is wrong with these diagrams that caused the problems you
encountered in part (b)?
(d) Create another diagram satisfying the criteria of Exercises 2.14 through Exercises
2.17, yet having the same problem as the two diagrams above.
This exercise shows a slight discrepancy between the actions-based definition of group
(Definition 1.9, illustrated using Cayley diagrams) and my algebraic one (Definition 4.2,
illustrated using multiplication tables). This discrepancy will be cleared up in Section 6.1.
Exercise
4.17. Explain why a Cayley diagram must be connected. That is, why must
there be a path from every node to every other node?
Exercise 4.18. When creating a multiplication table for a group, if you try to include
two different identity elements, what goes wrong? What does this lead you to conclude
about groups?

4.5. Exercises
59
Exercise
4.21. From Exercise 4.19 part (a) you can conclude that there is only one
pattern for a group containing two elements. This is because the only difference between
the multiplication table you computed and that of any other group with two elements will
be the names of those elements. So the pattern of interactions among elements (or colors
if we were to color the cells of the table) would be no different.
(a) How many patterns are there for groups containing three elements?
(b) Containing one element?
(c) Containing four elements?
Chapter 9 attacks the general question, \How many groups there are with n elements?"
4.5.5
Table patterns
These exercises preview Section 5.2, about an important family of groups called the
abelian groups.
Exercise 4.22. We saw earlier in this chapter that in the group V4, the equation RB D BR
is true. In fact, for any two elements a; b 2 V4, the equation ab D ba is true. That is,
the order in which you combine elements does not matter. Consider each group whose
multiplication table appears in Figure 4.7 (except A5, whose details are too small to see).
For which of those groups does the order of combining elements matter?
Exercise 4.23. Groups in which the order of multiplication of elements does not matter
are called commutative or abelian. Look through the groups in Group Explorer's group
library, starting with the smallest, until you find one that is noncommutative. What is the
name of the smallest noncommutative group?
Exercise 4.24. What visual pattern do the multiplication tables of commutative groups
exhibit?
4.5.6
Algebra
Exercise 4.25. To go along with the other algebraic notation we've seen in this chapter,
there is also an algebraic notation for generators. For instance, the group C5, which
appears in the first few exercises of this chapter, is generated by the element a. The
standard notation for this is C5 D hai. The hai means \what you can generate from a,"
and so the equation C5 D hai is saying \C5 is the group generated from a." From Figure
4.3, we can write V4 D hR; Bi, saying that R and B together generate V4.
Show your understanding of this new notation by filling in the blanks below using
however many elements are necessary to generate the group. Use as few elements as
possible.

answer to each of the previous two questions.

(b) Is it a group using ordinary multiplication as the operation?
(c) Are the even integers a group using ordinary addition as the operation?

same way, for what integers n is the set nZ a group using ordinary addition as the
operation?
Exercise 4.33. The rational numbers (often written Q) are the set of fractions a
b , where
a and b are integers (but b Â¤ 0). For example, 1
2,  6
11 , and 50
3 are all rational. Any integer,
including zero, is rational, because you can just divide it by 1. For example, 10 is the
rational number 10
1 .
Use Definition 4.2 to answer each of the following questions about Q.
(a) Is it a group using ordinary addition as the operation?
(b) Is it a group using ordinary multiplication as the operation?
(c) Call QC the positive rational numbers (only those greater than zero). Is QC a group
under ordinary addition?
(d) Is QC a group under ordinary multiplication?
(e) Call Q the nonzero rational numbers (all positive and negative ones, only leaving
out zero). Is Q a group under ordinary addition?
(f) Is Q a group under ordinary multiplication?
(g) Why are groups like Q, QC, and Q difficult to visualize using multiplication tables
and Cayley diagrams?

Five families
We have learned two powerful group theory visualization techniques. Cayley diagrams
show us groups as collections of actions, and multiplication tables show them to us as
binary operations. This chapter uses both to give a well-rounded introduction to five
famous families of groups. Along the way a variety of new concepts will also arise.
We will begin by meeting the cyclic groups, for many reasons the perfect place to start
our tour. Not only are cyclic groups the simplest kind of symmetry groups, but meeting
them first will make the rest of the chapter clearer: Cyclic groups show up in all other
groups as what we call orbits, and we will learn a new visualization technique based on
orbits, called a cycle graph. Cyclic groups will also help us understand the groups we
meet thereafter, the abelian groups and the dihedral groups. Both these families of groups
can be built by combining cyclic groups using product operations, which we will preview
in this chapter and study fully in Chapter 7.
Last, we will meet the symmetric and alternating groups, which will show the con-
nection between groups and the idea of rearranging a set of items. Many examples and
exercises in this book have dealt with rearrangements of things, which mathematicians
call permutations. The chapter culminates with two beautiful results from group theory:
the symmetries of the five Platonic solids and an illustrated proof of Cayley's theorem,
as promised at the end of Chapter 4.
In some ways, this chapter is a gateway from introductory material to deeper material.
Of course, everything in it (including the proof of Cayley's theorem) is done visually.
To see how familiarity with the five families this chapter introduces will pay off, take
a moment to briefly consider each of the following questions.
(1) Is there more than one group with ten elements?
(2) Is there a group in which no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse?
(3) Do all groups describe the symmetries of some object?
Think how helpful it would be, when trying to answer such questions, to have a large,
well-organized library of groups in your memory. The tour this chapter gives exposes you

to many new groups, organizes them into memorable categories, and highlights their key
features visually.
5.1
Cyclic groups
5.1.1
Things that spin
Chapter 3 taught us how to describe the symmetries of physical objects using groups. The
most basic family of groups, the cyclic groups, describe objects that have only rotational
symmetry. The symmetry group for the molecule of Boric acid we analyzed (Figure3.6,
page 29) is a cycle of three actions. What makes cycles simple is that they only have one
kind of action. There's only one thing you can do to the molecule B.OH/3 that respects
its symmetry|rotate it. You can rotate it backwards or rotate it several times, but those
are consequences of one fundamental rotation, in this case of 120 degrees clockwise.
The group of symmetries of the Boric acid molecule has three elements because the
molecule has three arms. Similar shapes with more arms are described by cyclic groups
with more elements. There may not be molecules with these shapes, but we can imagine
them. Also, some everyday objects have only rotational symmetry|considerthe pinwheels
and propellers in Figure 5.1. Notice the similarities between the simple analysis of the
propeller's symmetries in Figure 5.2 and that of the Boric acid molecule in Figures 3.4
and 3.5.
Figure 5.1. A six-bladed propeller and an eight-foiled pinwheel, whose symmetry groups are
the cyclic groups with six and eight elements, respectively.
Because the cyclic group describing the B.OH/3 molecule has three elements, it is
commonly called C3. The groups of symmetries for the propeller and the pinwheel in
Figure 5.1 would therefore be C6 and C8, respectively. You may hear C3 called \the
cyclic group of order 3," because order is the group theory term for size, or number
of elements. When speaking of the whole family of cyclic groups, or of a nonspecific
member of it, it is common to write Cn, meaning that n could stand for any positive
whole number.
The most common way to name the elements in Cn is to call the identity 0, the clock-
wise rotation 1, the clockwise rotation done twice 2, and so on, up to n   1. We do not
have an action called n in Cn because an n-bladed propeller rotated n times returns to its
original position, so n rotations are really no different than zero rotations. Each number
therefore signifies how many times to repeat the one fundamental action, named 1.

Figure 5.2. Propellers have only rotational symmetry. Rotating them clockwise (as shown in the
top row) keeps them occupying the same space, but flipping them over (as in the bottom row) does
not. The lower right propeller rotates backwards compared to the other three, and thus doesn't sit
the same in space.
Figure 5.3 shows Cayley diagrams for C3, C5, and Cn using this naming convention.
The rightmost diagram in Figure 5.3 makes use of an ellipsis to show that the Cayley
diagram for Cn is always a cycle for any value of n.

5.1.2
Multiplication tables and modular addition
You may also see a cyclic group Cn referred to as Zn. This alternate naming convention
comes from the common mathematical use of Z to refer to the integers. Since we think
of Cn as the first n nonnegative integers, many books and papers call it Zn instead.
In Exercise 4.6, you created a multiplication table from the Cayley diagram of C5, also
known as Z5. Using numbers as names for actions, as described above, that multiplication
table becomes the left one in Figure 5.4. Although much of that table looks like ordinary
addition (e.g., 0C3 D 3 and 2C2 D 4), not all of it does (e.g., 2C3 D 0 and 3C3 D 1).
The official name for the operation in C5 is modular addition, or less formally, clock
addition. It works just the way we count on a clock|because the numbers wrap around

Figure 5.4. Multiplication tables for the groups C5 and C15
in a cycle, so does the addition. If at 10:00pm, you start to watch a three-hour movie,
you wouldn't say it will end at 13:00pm, but rather at 1:00am. That's how 10 and 3 are
added modulo 12, or mod 12. Counting past 12 does not lead to 13, but rather back to
1. The only difference between a typical wall clock and the Cayley diagram for C12 is
that the number at the top will be 12 on the clock, but 0 in the Cayley diagram. This
difference is not significant, but just a matter of convention.
Similarly, in C5, when we add 3 C 4, we cannot get 7 because C5 contains only 0,
1, 2, 3, and 4. Instead, we count 4 steps from 3, because that's the meaning of 3 C 4,
wrapping around the \clock" when necessary, 3 ! 4 ! 0 ! 1 ! 2. To be sure this
makes sense, try adding 3 and 2 in C5; your result should be 0. If your mind's eye is not
used to envisioning five-hour clocks, use the one in Figure 5.3 for convenience.
Modular addition has a nice visual effect on multiplication tables; each row is different
from the row above it only by being cycled one cell to the left. In colored multiplication
tables, this extends the color spectrum in the top row diagonally through the table, creating
a rainbow effect; see the table for C15 on the right of Figure 5.4. That table also exem-
plifies the general pattern for multiplication tables for cyclic groups. Notice the diagonal
strip of 14s, from the lower left corner to the top right. Above that strip, the table obeys
the laws of ordinary addition, because none of the sums exceeds 14. Below that strip,
addition mod 15 shows its colors. Figure 5.5 illustrates this pattern in the general case, Cn.
5.1.3
Orbits
We started our study of families of groups with Cn partly because of its simplicity and
partly because cyclic groups are fundamental to the study of group theory in several ways.
Shortly we will meet the abelian groups, and thereafter the dihedral groups, which can

sequences and the colored diagonal lines connect strips that are numbered (and therefore colored)
the same.
be built up in straightforward, regular ways from cyclic groups. But first, let's learn how
to find cyclic groups inside all other groups.
Look back at the first Cayley diagrams in this book, in Figure 2.10 on page 22. In
the top right diagram, of S3, consider just the blue arrows, which represent the action
r. Starting at the identity e, the blue arrows lead in a cycle around the outside of the
diagram, tracing out a copy of C3 inside S3. The standard term for this cycle is the orbit
of the element r. Orbits are usually written with braces to indicate that the elements are
to be treated together as a set; this one is therefore fe; r; r2g.
Every element in a group can trace out an orbit. In the same diagram for S3, imagine
starting from e and repeatedly following the f arrows. A shorter orbit is generated, fe; f g,
because f 2 D e.
The orbits of r and f we can clearly see in the diagram as it is shown in Figure
2.10; r's orbit is the outermost ring and f 's is a single vertical two-way arrow. But other
orbits exist. For instance, we can compute the orbit of f r2 by doing just what its name
suggests|follow the f arrow and then the r arrow twice|see where you end up, and
repeat as necessary. Trace out this path in the diagram; you should find that the orbit
of f r2 is fe; f r 2g. So the orbit of f r2 is not visually obvious in the diagram of S3 in
Figure 2.10, but it is an orbit nonetheless. Chapter 6 will show that there are many ways
to structure a Cayley diagram, and S3 can be represented in a way that makes the orbit
of f r2 obvious.
Even those orbits that are clear in a Cayley diagram do not always look circular.
Consider the diagram of C3  C3, also in Figure 2.10. The orbit of .e; a/ is the three-
element cycle along the top of the diagram. Though it is a copy of the group C3, in the
diagram it is laid out linearly, not circularly.

Figure 5.6. The orbits for the group S3, shown on the left in a table, and on the right as the
group's cycle graph.
If we consider each element of S3 in turn and compute its orbit, we come up with the
list shown on the left of Figure 5.6. (Note that the sets fe; r; r2g and fe; r2; rg are the same;
we are not concerned with the order in which the elements appear in an orbit.) We cannot
compute an orbit for the identity element, since it has no arrow to lead us anywhere.
5.1.4
Introducing cycle graphs
From lists like the one in Figure 5.6, we can create a diagram connecting the elements that
appear in an orbit together. Such diagrams show how the group is made up of the orbits of
its elements. Since each orbit is a cycle, the resulting diagram is called a cycle graph. The
cycle graph for S3, constructed from the list in Figure 5.6, is shown in that same figure.
We will use cycle graphs throughout the rest of this chapter to see how the families
of groups we meet are built on cycles. However, since cyclic groups themselves are
comprised of only one cycle, their cycle graphs are rather unrevealing compared to the
cycle graph of S3. In fact, they look no different from the groups' Cayley diagrams, except
that by convention cycle graphs do not use arrowheads. Compare the Cayley diagrams in
Figure 5.3 with the cycle graphs for the same three groups, in Figure 5.7.
Figure 5.7. Cycle graphs for the cyclic groups C3, C5, and Cn, the same groups whose Cayley
diagrams appear in Figure 5.3.
5.2
Abelian groups
Cyclic groups lead naturally to abelian groups in two ways. First, all cyclic groups are
abelian, and the abelian groups retain some of the important simplicities that cyclic groups
have. Second, we will see that there is a natural way to construct abelian groups by piecing
together cyclic ones. This fact is called the Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups,
which this chapter will preview, leaving the full details until Chapter 8.

5.2. Abelian groups
69
Named after Neils Abel, one of the founders of group theory, abelian groups are those
in which the order in which one performs the actions is irrelevant. That is, if a and b are
any two actions in an abelian group, then the action a followed by the action b yields the
same result as b followed by a. The algebraic way to say this is that a commutes with b,
and so abelian groups are often referred to as commutative. The equation ab D ba says
that a and b commute; a group is abelian when that equation is true no matter which two
elements from the group a and b stand for.
5.2.1
Noncommutativity in Cayley diagrams
To see the impact of commutativity on the appearance of a Cayley diagram, let's imagine
we have the Cayley diagram of some abelian group G. Say the diagram's red arrows
represent multiplication by a and its blue arrows represent multiplication by b. (Recall
the convention from Exercise 4.6 that arrows represent multiplication on the right.) In
such a diagram, ab is the combination of a red arrow and then a blue one, in that order,
while ba is the combination of a blue and then a red arrow. Commutativity stipulates
that ab D ba, and so from any node in the Cayley diagram, if you follow a red arrow
and then a blue one, you must arrive at the same point you would have if you had first
followed the blue arrow and then the red one. Figure 5.8 illustrates this visually.
*
*
Figure 5.8. On the left is a pattern that never appears in Cayley diagrams for abelian groups:
from the node marked , following a red and then blue arrow does not reach the same node as
following a blue and then red. The pattern on the right will always appear instead.
The patterns in Figure 5.8 give us an easy way to spot abelian groups using Cayley
diagrams: Ensure that every pair of arrows leaving a node closes to a diamond shape,
as on the right of Figure 5.8. Whether or not the pattern appears laid out exactly in a
diamond shape is unimportant|it's the pattern of connections that matters. An example
will make this more clear.
Figure 5.9 shows Cayley diagrams for two slightly different groups. Look carefully
through the two diagrams in Figure 5.9 and see if you can find an instance of the left
pattern from Figure 5.8 in either one. If you find an instance of that pattern, you know
Figure 5.9. Cayley diagrams for two very similar groups, D4 and C2  C4. Test these groups
for commutativity by finding instances of the patterns in Figure5.8.

70
5. Five families
Figure 5.10. The diagrams from Figure 5.9 reappear here, highlighted to show instances of the
patterns in Figure 5.8. The left diagram highlights an instance of the pattern that makes it non-
abelian: if a stands for red and b for blue, then ab Â¤ ba because from , ab leads to a different
destination than ba does. The right diagram highlights the analogous paths, but the pattern indicates
commutativity.
the corresponding group is not abelian. Recall that connections without arrowheads in
a Cayley diagram count as arrows in both directions. When you have finished, examine
Figure 5.10 and compare your answer to the explanation in its caption.
The straight lines in Figure 5.8 become smooth curves in Figure 5.10, but the pattern
of connections is the same. Note that the  element could have been placed anywhere
and similar patterns highlighted; Cayley diagrams embody a great deal of symmetry.1 In
Chapter 8 we will see how the visual patterns from Figure 5.8 lay the foundation for the
Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups.
5.2.2
Commutative multiplication tables
Abelian groups are easier to spot from their multiplication tables than from their Cayley
diagrams. Consider Figure 5.11, sketching a partial multiplication table, cut in half diag-
onally from top left to bottom right. Only the rows and columns for the elements a and b
are shown, and consequently the cells for both ab and ba, which are directly across the
diagonal dividing line from one another. The equation ab D ba requires that these two
cells must contain the same group element. That is, they must mirror one another, with
the diagonal dividing line acting as the mirror.

Figure 5.11. The equation ab D ba, which defines abelian groups, causes their multiplication
tables to be symmetric across the diagonal shown here.

Figure 5.12. The symmetry of the table on the right tells us it is abelian. The left table does
not have the required diagonal symmetry.
Since this same pattern holds for any two elements a and b, the whole upper right
of the table (the white triangle) is mirrored in the lower left (the gray triangle). If you
folded the table in half along the diagonal dividing line, pairs of identical elements would
touch. Consider the two example multiplication tables in Figure 5.12; it is easy to spot
which of the two is abelian by looking for this kind of diagonal mirroring.
5.2.3
Intricate cycle graphs
Abelian groups that are not cyclic often have very interesting cycle graphs. Take a moment
to inspect those in Figure 5.13. Let's take a closer look at the simplest of them, the top
left one. It shows that C3  C3 is composed of four three-step orbits, and Figure 5.14
shows where in the Cayley diagram for C3  C3 we can find these orbits.
The top two orbits are fairly self-explanatory; they are the orbits of the red and blue
arrows, respectively. The other two orbits were constructed from sequences of red and
blue arrows, to visit nodes the first two orbits did not reach.
This cycle graph is an example of a general pattern. In Section 8.4 you will encounter
a famous theorem that will enable you to prove that for any prime number p, the cycle
graph of Cp  Cp will always have p C 1 orbits with p elements in each, all touching at
the identity.
But now it is time to leave the gentle realm of commutative groups and dip into some
of the rich complexity non-abelian groups can offer. The smallest step into that realm leads
to the dihedral groups. You have already seen the dihedral group D4 on the right of Figure
5.9, and from that figure you can tell that although D4 is not abelian, it is very close.

Dihedral groups
5.3.1
Things that flip (and spin)
While cyclic groups describe objects that have only rotational symmetry, dihedral groups
describe objects that have both rotational and bilateral symmetry. Objects have bilateral
symmetry if they look the same when flipped over (usually in a specific direction, such
as horizontally). Figure 5.2 showed that a propeller does not have bilateral symmetry|
flipping it over changes the space it occupies. The easiest geometric examples of objects
with both rotational and bilateral symmetry are regular polygons, several of which are
shown in Figure 5.15. \Regular" means that all their sides and angles are equal.
Figure 5.15.
Regular polygons, from three- through seven-sided: triangle, square, pentagon,
hexagon, and heptagon.
A polygon with n sides is called an n-gon, and the dihedral group that describes the
symmetries of a regular n-gon is written Dn. All the actions in Cn are also actions in Dn
because rotating a regular polygon preserves the space it occupies. But because regular
polygons also permit flipping, we expect there to be more elements in Dn than in Cn,
and indeed there are. While Cn contains n actions, Dn contains twice as many, 2n. Let
us see what these n new actions do.
Recall that C3 described the symmetries of the three-armed molecule of Boric acid, as
in Figure 3.6. Let's compare this to the symmetries of a regular three-sided polygon, an
equilateral triangle. (If you did Exercise 2.18 this will seem familiar. If not, you may want
to create for yourself a numbered triangle to make it easier to follow along.) We've seen
that rotations respect the shape of the Boric acid molecule or a propeller or a pinwheel,
but horizontal flips do not (Figures 3.4, 3.5, and 5.2). Figure 5.16 shows that this changes
with an equilateral triangle; both rotations and flips respect its shape.
If we use only the rotation from Figure 5.16, the resulting group will be the copy of
C3 we already know to be in D3. If we call that clockwise rotation r, then our copy of
C3 is the orbit of r. Let us call the flip shown in Figure 5.16 f , and see what happens

when we use it together with the orbit of r. From the starting position, if we flip the
triangle over, we reach a new position, one outside the orbit of r. From this position,
using r reaches two other new positions. These three new positions bring the total to six.
Applying f to any of these new positions returns us to the orbit of r, and therefore the
complete list of actions in D3 is e, r, r2, f , rf , and r2f . Indeed, this is the process
you went through and carefully recorded in a Cayley diagram if you did Exercise 2.18.
5.3.2
Cayley diagrams for Dn
The leftmost Cayley diagram in Figure 5.17 shows D3 as just described. If that diagram
seems familiar (even apart from Exercise 2.18), it is because D3 has already appeared in
this book, but under the name S3 (Figure 2.10, page 22). Both names are common, and
you will learn the origin of the name S3 at the end of this chapter.
Dihedral groups come in many sizes, but as a family they share important structural
characteristics. Cayley diagrams for other dihedral groups resemble the one for D3, as
exemplified by the center diagram in Figure 5.17, showing D5. The rightmost diagram
in Figure 5.17 shows the pattern for an arbitrary Dn.

Figure 5.17. Cayley diagrams for the dihedral groups D3 (left) and D5 (center), as well as the
general scheme for Cayley diagrams of Dn (right).
The outer ring in each of these diagrams is the orbit of r, and is a copy of the cyclic
group Cn. The inner ring is a cycle of the same size, but pointing counterclockwise instead
of clockwise. To see the reason for this reversal, imagine yourself holding a triangle in
the initial configuration shown on the left of Figure 5.16. A friend stands facing you, and
you hold the triangle up between the two of you, so that you see the front face and your
friend sees the back. You can swap viewpoints with your friend by doing the f action to
the triangle. When you see the triangle in its initial configuration, your friend sees it in
its flipped configuration, the bottom right of Figure 5.16.
Your performing action r to the triangle will be different than your friend's doing it.
When your friend turns the triangle clockwise, it will look counterclockwise to you. It is
the same if you temporarily take the role of your friend by flipping the triangle, rotating
it clockwise, and flipping back: the overall effect is a counterclockwise rotation. To say
this algebraically, f rf D r 1.
The inner ring of the diagrams in Figure 5.17 represents your friend's point of view,
the one you can take on by performing action f , and put off again the same way. Thus the

Figure 5.18. Multiplication table for the dihedral group D5
f actions connect the inner and outer rings. The r action rotates in the opposite direction
in the inner ring because the inner ring corresponds to a viewpoint from the other side of
the triangle, where clockwise and counterclockwise have been switched.
5.3.3
Multiplication tables for Dn
This separation of the elements of Dn into two categories|the inner and outer rings|is
also visible in multiplication tables. Consider the table for D5 in Figure 5.18. It is not
difficult to mentally divide this table into quarters by splitting it in half horizontally and
again vertically; in fact, the colors of the cells encourage you to do so.
This is because the headings in the table have been organized with those from the
Cayley diagram's outer ring listed first (e through r4) and its inner ring listed next (f
through f r4). This makes the upper left quarter of the table show only the interactions
among members of the outer ring. It's a copy of the multiplication table of C5, because
the outer ring of the Cayley diagram is a copy of C5.
This table will be analyzed further in the next section, and in Exercise 5.35.
5.3.4
A preview of Chapter 7
Consider the overall color pattern of Figure 5.18. The top left quarter uses the same
colors as the bottom right, and the bottom left matches the top right. This color pattern
clusters the elements that do not involve the flip f in two quadrants of the table, and
the elements that do involve f in the other two quadrants. If we call them \flip" and
\non-flip" elements for short, the clustering makes the following facts clear.
Any non-flip times a non-flip is a non-flip.
Any non-flip times a flip is a flip.
Any flip times a non-flip is a flip.
Any flip times a flip is a non-flip.

Figure 5.19. Multiplication table for D5 with annotation that clusters elements according to
whether they involve a flip. The resulting two-by-two pattern matches the multiplication table for
the group of order two, shown on the right.
Annotating the table to illustrate this pattern results in Figure 5.19, a simple two-by-
two table overlayed on the original ten-by-ten table. This two-by-two table is actually the
multiplication table for the only group of order two.
The color pattern in the multiplication table for D5 revealed within that table the
structure of a smaller group, C2. Shrinking a group this way is called taking a quotient,
and we have only previewed it here. Group quotients and the complementary notion of
group products are central to the study of groups, and Chapter 7 will cover both notions
thoroughly. We'll learn that a dihedral group Dn can be obtained by combining the groups
Cn and C2 using what's called a semidirect product, and the quotient in Figure 5.19 is
reversing that product operation.
5.3.5
Cycle graphs for Dn
Before we move beyond dihedral groups, let's examine their cycle graphs, to solidify
our understanding of the roles of the elements in Dn. Figure 5.6 shows that the orbit of
r in D3 contains three elements, and each element outside that orbit is in a little orbit
consisting only of itself and the identity. For larger dihedral groups than D3, this pattern
continues. Dn consists of an r orbit of size n, and n other elements each in an orbit of
size two. Let us see why this is so.
Any element of Dn that's not in the orbit of r can be written as f r m for some number
m between 0 and n 1. (If you can't recall why this is so, look back at Figure5.17.) I will
explain why doing the action f rm twice has the same result as doing nothing. Recall the
description from Section 5.3.2 of you and a friend holding a triangle. That example taught
us that performing the action f rf is the same as performing the action r in reverse. It did
so by having us realize that surrounding r with f 's was like taking on the role of our friend,
who faces the opposite direction. The same argument applies to surrounding rm with f 's,

Figure 5.20. Cycle graphs for D4, D5, and the general pattern for Dn
and so f rmf is the same as rm in reverse. Consequently, f rmf followed by rm returns
the triangle to its original position. Algebraically, we can either write it as f rmf D r m
or as f rmf rm D e. Both signify that f r m done twice returns to the original state.
This explanation did not depend on the fact that the regular polygon in question was a
triangle; it could have been a pentagon, square, or any other regular polygon. So in any Dn,
every element outside the orbit of r will have its own two-step orbit. This makes the cycle
graph of Dn look like one ring of size n with many two-element orbits connected to it at
the identity. Examples for D4, D5, and the general pattern for Dn appear in Figure 5.20.
Now it's time to move on from Dn, which has been our first exposure to a family of
non-abelian groups. As you recall from Figure 5.9, the dihedral groups are structurally
very close to being abelian, and are therefore not very complex. The following section
opens the floodgates, letting in the full measure of the complexity of group theory.
5.4
Symmetric and alternating groups
Many groups we've seen in this book have been collections of ways to rearrange things.
Chapter 1's exercises had you rearranging coins on a table and paintings on walls. It also
talked about Rubik's Cube, which we can think of as rearranging colored stickers. In
Chapter 3, we numbered the parts of symmetric objects so that manipulations of those
objects could be analyzed as rearrangements of the numbers. Rearrangements, which
mathematicians call permutations, are intimately tied to group theory in two ways. First,
we will meet two important families of groups, the symmetric and alternating groups,
that can be built from permutations in a natural way. Then we will see a visual proof
of Cayley's theorem, which says that permutations are a powerful enough tool that from
them we can build any group.
5.4.1
Permutations
A permutation is an action that rearranges a collection of things. Permutations can de-
scribe the shuffling of cards in a deck, a rearrangement of the letters in a word, or the
way you sort the CDs on your shelf. Mathematicians usually refer to permutations of
small positive integers, partly just to make permutations easy to write down.

Figure 5.21. Three example permutations of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. For example, the leftmost
one permutes the elements by moving each one step to the right, but moving 4 all the way to the
left. The central permutation does not alter the positions of 1 or 4, but swaps the other two numbers.
Following this convention, let's assume we have four things we can rearrange, 1, 2,
3, and 4. A few example ways to permute these numbers are shown in Figure 5.21. There
are many notations mathematicians use to represent permutations, but we will use the
notation in Figure 5.21.
5.4.2
Permutation groups
Permutations cooperate well with the original requirements we put on groups, in Definition
1.9 on page 7. If we take all permutations of a certain collection of things (such as the
numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4), we clearly have a predefined, unvarying list of actions (satisfying
Rule 1.5), each of which is unambiguous (satisfying Rule 1.7). Furthermore, the work of
any two permutations done in succession can just as easily be done by one permutation,
the combination of the two (satisfying Rule 1.8). Figure 5.22 exemplifies how any two
permutations can be combined. Lastly, every permutation is reversible (satisfying Rule
1.6), as Figure 5.23 shows by example. So there is a good reason why so many examples in
this book have involved rearranging things: permutations are natural group-building tools.

Figure 5.22. Two examples of combining two permutations to form a new one. In the top row,
the first permutation moves 1 to 2, which the second permutation moves to 3, so their combination
must move 1 to 3. In the bottom row, the first permutation moves 1 to 2, which the second
permutation leaves untouched, so in combination, they move 1 to 2. Try following the paths of 2,
3, and 4 through each pair of combined permutations yourself.
For instance, Exercise 1.4 asked you to count all possible ways to rearrange three
paintings on three walls. Exercise 2.5 built on Exercise 1.4, asking you to you draw a
Cayley diagram for that group, and Exercise 4.8 asked you to make its multiplication
table. In this chapter we've seen that this group has the name D3, but in earlier chapters
we called it by its more common name, S3. The S stands for symmetric, because the
group of all permutations of a given size is called a symmetric group. So Sn represents
the group of all permutations of n things.
We've seen a diagram of S3, but have not yet encountered other members of the
symmetric group family. The smallest members of the family, S1 and S2, you will analyze
yourself in Exercise 5.18, but the larger Sn groups are both complex and intriguing. Their

size increases quickly; the order of Sn is n factorial (written nÅ , meaning the product
of all whole numbers from 1 to n). Thus S4 has order 1  2  3  4 D 24 and S5 has
order 1  2  3  4  5 D 120. Cayley diagrams for groups as large as S5 can be tangled
and hard to draw, but the Cayley diagram for S4 is still small enough to admit a very
pleasing arrangement, shown in Figure 5.24. As you will read in the next section, it is no
coincidence that it looks cube-like.

Node labels were omitted to eliminate clutter.
Although the collection of all permutations of n items forms a group, creating a
group of permutations does not require taking all permutations of a given size. It is often
possible to form a group from just some of the permutations from Sn. One famous way is
to take exactly half of the elements of Sn, creating what is called an alternating group.
Not just any half will do; random choosing will rarely result in a group. But if you take
every element in Sn and square it, that collection of squared elements will be exactly half
of Sn, an alternating group called An. The creation of A3 from S3 is shown in Figure
5.25. As you recall from Exercise 4.21 there is only one structure for groups of order 3,
so A3 has the same structure as the cyclic group C3.

The Platonic solids
There are only five three-dimensional shapes all of whose faces are regular polygons that
meet at equal angles. We call them the Platonic solids, and you can see renderings of

alternating groups.
Recall the technique Chapter 3 taught for classifying the symmetries of any three-
dimensional object. We applied it to molecules and dancers and other things, and we
could apply it to the Platonic solids. Exercise 5.25 asks you to try this for the tetrahedron,
and helps you out with a diagram. Applying the technique to the other Platonic solids,
especially the icosahedron or dodecahedron, is a bookkeeping challenge. This work has
already been done, and we will see the results.

right shows which permutations in A4 the arrows represent. As in Figure 5.24 and Figures 5.28
and 5.29, node labels are omitted to eliminate clutter.
The symmetry group for the tetrahedron is A4, half of all permutations of four items.
We can lay out a Cayley diagram for A4 in a way that makes its connection to the
tetrahedron clear; see Figure 5.27. The cube and octahedron have the same symmetry
group, S4. This is why it is no coincidence that the Cayley diagram for S4 in Figure 5.24
looked cube-like. It is possible to arrange the diagram like an octahedron by using arrows
that refer to different permutations; compare Figures 5.24 and 5.28. The dodecahedron
and icosahedron also share a symmetry group, A5, of order 60. Its Cayley diagram can
therefore be tailored to suggest either shape, as shown in Figure 5.29.

So groups of permutations are important in group theory. We saw that permutations
can be used to form groups very easily, by simply taking all permutations of a given size.
We called these groups the symmetric groups Sn, and then took exactly half of each Sn
to form the alternating groups An. Then we saw that some members of the Sn and An
families describe the symmetries of some beautiful shapes, the five Platonic solids. But
beyond even all this, there remains a yet more significant way that permutations relate to
group theory. Cayley's theorem states that relationship.

5.4.4
Cayleyâs Theorem
At the beginning of Section 5.4, I stated that permutations can be used to construct any
group. This statement effectively says that all of group theory can be found in permu-
tations, a fact known as Cayley's theorem. As a first step toward proving this theorem,
let's see how every Cayley diagram and multiplication table expresses a collection of
permutations.
Consider the Cayley diagram for S3 on the left of Figure 5.30. The nodes in the
diagram have been numbered 1 through 6 to make it easy to talk about permutations
of them using familiar notation. Each color of arrows in the diagram can be interpreted
as a permutation: The red arrows move 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 1, 4 to 6, and so on. The
permutation representing this is on the top right of Figure 5.30. The blue arrows in the
diagram for S3 interchange pairs of nodes, and the permutation representing this appears
below the red one. To create these permutations from the diagram, I've just written the
numbers from the diagram's nodes in order in a row, 1 to 6, and connected them with
arrows the same way the diagram connects them.

analyzing how the arrows permute the elements (shown to the right)
Cayley's theorem says that these two permutations embody the relationship among
the six elements of S3. That is, if we create a group from the two permutations in Figure
5.30, we will find that the combinations of those permutations with one another form a
six element group with the same structure as S3. Furthermore, the red permutation will
behave in that group the same way that r behaves in S3, and the blue permutation will
behave like f in S3. Two groups with the same structure are called isomorphic, a term
we will use loosely for now, and study in Chapter 8. We have not yet proven any of this,
but we are about to. First, let us see how it relates to multiplication tables.
In Figure 5.30 I created permutations from the arrows in a Cayley diagram, which
represent right multiplication. What part of a multiplication table shows us right multipli-
cation? Consider the multiplication table for the group V4 in Figure 5.31, with elements
renamed 1 through 4 to make it easier to relate to permutations.

A multiplication table for the group V4, with nodes numbered 1 through 4 to
facilitate analyzing how the arrows permute the elements. The permutation for each arrow color is
shown on the right.
Each cell contains the result of its row heading times its column heading. So one
column in a multiplication table contains the results of multiplying each row heading by
the same column heading. For instance, the column labeled 3 in the multiplication table in
Figure 5.31 contains the results of each group element multiplied on the right by 3. That
column contains a complete record of what right multiplication by 3 means in V4. Notice
that the column is simply a reordering of the numbers 1 through 4, a permutation. (Your
answer to Exercise 4.15 explains why each column in a multiplication table is always a
reordering of the elements.) That column turns a 1 into a 3, a 2 into a 4, a 3 into a 1,
and a 4 into a 2. We can represent it by the following permutation.

So each column in a multiplication table is a permutation of the row headings. The four
permutations represented by the four columns of the multiplication table in Figure 5.31
are on the right of that same figure.
Notice that we could apply the procedure exemplified in Figure 5.30 to any Cayley di-
agram, and we could apply the procedure exemplified in Figure 5.31 to any multiplication
table. The important difference is that from a multiplication table we do not obtain simply
a few permutations we could use to build a group by combining them with each other, but
rather the full set of permutations that form the group. This difference arises because the
column headers of a multiplication table contain every group element, whereas the arrows
in a Cayley diagram usually only depict a set of generators. Cayley's theorem states that
in both cases, the resulting group will have exactly the same structure as the original. It
is now time to see why Cayley's Theorem is true. We begin with a proof based on the
visual computations in Figures 5.30 and 5.31, then illustrate that proof in Figure 5.32.
Theorem 5.1 (Cayley). Every group is isomorphic to a collection of permutations.
Proof. We have just seen that from the columns of any group's multiplication table, we
can create a permutation for each element of the group, as Figure 5.31 exemplifies. We
can also make a multiplication table out of those permutations. This proof explains why
such a multiplication table must behave the same as the original.
To make it easy to refer to them, let's say the group's elements are numbered 1 through
n, with 1 standing for the identity, just as in Figure 5.31. We also need a way to refer
to the permutations we created, one created for each element of the original group as in
Figure 5.31. So let's write p1 for the permutation for column 1, p2 for the permutation
created from column 2, and so on. Let's compare two multiplication tables, the original
one containing the numbers 1 through n, and a new one containing the permutations p1
through pn.
Imagine we're looking at the entry in the row for pi and the column for pj in the
new table, and the cell contains pk. That is, the table is saying pi  pj D pk. I will now
give evidence that these permutations faithfully represent the elements from which we
created them; that is, that the original table must say that i  j D k.
Consider how the permutations treat the identity element from the original group.
Because pk represents the \multiply by k" column in the table, applying pk to 1 means
multiplying 1 by k. To say this with an equation, pk.1/ D 1  k D k. Similarly, doing
pi  pj to 1 means multiplying 1 by i and then j , as follows.2
pi  pj.1/ D 1  i  j D i  j
Because pi pj D pk, we know that pk.1/ and pi pj .1/ must result in the same answer.
Because the former is k and the latter is i  j , that means i  j D k.
So any equation like pi  pj D pk from the table of permutations is an imitation of
an equation from the original group, i  j D k. Thus the entire permutation group follows
the same pattern as the original group, as the theorem states.
2 For the detail-oriented: I have just revealed my convention for function composition. Since I use f Ä± g to
mean \f then g," I am using the convention .f Ä± g/.x/ D g.f.x//.

Figure 5.32. A multiplication table made up of the permutations created in Figure 5.31. Each
cell highlights the destination to which the permutation sends 1, using the corresponding color from
Figure 5.31, emphasizing what the colors of the arrows already showed: The two tables contain the
same pattern.
This proof can be summarized as two steps: Create a permutation for each column in
a group's multiplication table, and then inspect how those permutations treat the group's
identity element. Figure 5.32 illustrates these two steps. It shows a multiplication table
comprised of the permutations from Figure 5.31, and each cell of the table highlights the
result of applying the permutation to the identity element 1. The correspondence between
Figures 5.31 and 5.32 is clear: If I remove all but the highlighted elements from Figure
5.32, all that remains is the multiplication table from Figure 5.31.

Cayley diagram from that exercise represents an abelian group. Then determine whether

Exercise 5.12. Why is it sufficient, when looking to see if a Cayley diagram represents

Small examples
Many of the smallest members of the families Dn, Sn, and An do not display the char-
acteristic complexities of larger members of those families. The following exercises ask
you to investigate the simplest (i.e., smallest) dihedral, symmetric, and alternating groups.
Exercise
5.17. Create multiplication tables for the smallest dihedral groups D1, D2,
D3, and so on, until you find the first non-abelian member of the family. Which is it,
and how can you tell?
Exercise 5.18. Repeat Exercise 5.17 for the symmetric groups Sn. Use the permutation
notation from this chapter.
Exercise
5.19. For each symmetric group whose multiplication table you created in
Exercise 5.18, compute the elements of the corresponding alternating group, as in Figure
5.25. For each alternating group you compute, create
(a) a multiplication table,
(b) a Cayley diagram, and
(c) a cycle graph.
Exercise
5.20. Some of the smallest members of the families Cn, Dn, Sn, and An
actually belong to more than one family, as long as we do not care about the names of the
elements, but about the group structure. For instance, D1 is a group with two elements,
and its multiplication table has the same pattern as that of C2, as shown here.

What other groups belong to more than one of the families we studied in this chapter?
(Another way to read this question is, \Are there any groups in one of the families Cn,
Dn, Sn, or An that are isomorphic to a group in another of those families?")
Exercise 5.21. For each of the following questions, either exhibit a group that answers
the question in the affirmative or give a clear explanation of why the answer to the
question is negative.
(a) Is there a cyclic group with exactly four generators? (Not that it takes four elements
to generate the group, but that there are four different elements a; b; c; d in Cn and
Cn D hai D hbi D hci D hdi.) Is there more than one such group?
(b) Is there a cyclic group with exactly one generator? Is there more than one?
Exercise
5.22. Open Group Explorer and sort the group library by order, with the
smallest groups on top. Where in the list do you find the first group that's not in any of
the families this chapter introduced? What is its name and size? How can you tell that
it's not in any of the families you just learned?

Going a bit further
Exercise 5.23. This chapter gave propellers and pinwheels as examples of objects whose
symmetries are described by cyclic groups, that is, objects with rotational symmetry only.
What other objects fit in this category?
Exercise 5.24. This chapter gave regular polygons as examples of objects whose sym-
metries are described by dihedral groups, that is, objects with both rotational and bilateral
symmetry, but no other symmetries. What other objects fit in this category?
Exercise 5.25. Analyze the symmetries of a tetrahedron using the technique from Defi-
nition 3.1, resulting in the Cayley diagram for its symmetry group. Here are a few hints
to get you started.
First, if you need a tetrahedron, copy the following pattern onto a separate sheet, cut
along the solid lines, and fold along the dotted lines. Keep the numbers on the outside
of the figure as you fold, and the 1's should join to form the fourth vertex of the three-
dimensional shape. You may need tape to hold that vertex together.

Second, decide on an orientation for the tetrahedron before you begin. For example,
you might always keep one of its faces flat on the tabletop in front of you, and another
facing up towards you. Obviously, as you manipulate the shape, it will change which face
is on the tabletop or facing you.
Third, if you want your Cayley diagram to resemble the one in Figure 5.27, use the
following two moves. One move is a 120-degree rotation of the tetrahedron about whatever
vertex is pointing up, as shown on the left below. The other is a 180-degree rotation of
the tetrahedron performed by putting two fingertips at the midpoints of opposite edges
(edges that do not touch one another), as shown on the right below.
Exercise 5.26. As you know from the chapter, the symmetry group for the tetrahedron
is A4. We can think of it, as you saw in Exercise 5.25, as permuting four vertices. What
physical features of the tetrahedron prevent its symmetry group from being all of S4?

92
5. Five families
Exercise 5.27. As you know from the chapter, S3 and D3 are two different names for
the same group. Yet no larger dihedral group is also a symmetric group. Give an argument
based on the physical features of an n-gon for why this is so (n  4).
Exercise 5.28. Section 5.2.3 describes what the cycle graph will look like for Cp  Cp
if p is a prime number. Draw the cycle graph for C5  C5. (It is not necessary to label
the elements.)
Exercise 5.29. Each part of this problem should help you answer the later parts.
(a) Is it true that any a in Cn will generate the whole group, i.e., Cn D hai? Why or
why not? If not, for which elements a in which groups Cn is it false?
Hint: Although it is quite possible to solve this problem with what you know now, if
it seems too tricky for the moment, come back to it after you've read Section8.4.
(b) For how many different pairs a; b in D3 can you write D3 D ha; bi? What if I change
the D3 to Dn?
(c) You may have noticed that D3 D hrf; r2f i, which for the moment I will rewrite as
hrf; r 1f i. Does this same set of generators generate any other Dn? Which ones,
and how do you know?
Exercise
5.30. In Exercise 4.32 you were introduced to the set Z, which is a group
under the operation of ordinary addition.
(a) Create a Cayley diagram for it.
(b) Create a cycle graph for it.
(c) Is it abelian?
(d) Are there any objects whose symmetries it describes?
Exercise 5.31. The group Z from the previous exercise is considered an infinite cyclic
group. What do you think an infinite dihedral group would be like?
Exercise
5.32. In Exercises 4.32 and 4.33 you investigated some infinite groups of
numbers. Are any of them abelian?
5.5.5
Going beyond
Exercise 5.33. The notation for generating a group, introduced in Exercise 4.25, can be
extended to what are called \group presentations" by adding equations that describe how
the elements relate. For example, the presentation for S3 is
hr; f j r3 D 1; f 2 D 1; f rf D r 1i:
We can think of this as specifying a Cayley diagram; the r; f tells there will be two arrow
colors (one for r and one for f ) and the equations that follow tell us how those arrows
tie together. The first two, r3 D 1 and f 2 D 1, tell you the orders of the generators, and
the last equation tells you how the generators relate. Such a presentation gives you all the
information you need to construct a Cayley diagram for S3, step-by-step.

5.5. Exercises
93
(a) Explain how the information from the presentation
hr; f j r3 D 1; f 2 D 1; f rf D r 1i
enables you to create each step of a Cayley diagram for S3. That is, go through
the step-by-step process and write down both the steps and how you concluded the
information you needed at each step.
(b) Repeat part (a) for the presentation hr; f j r 4 D 1; f 2 D 1; f rf D r 1i, which is
only different in that the 3 changed to a 4. What group is this?
(c) What group has the presentation ha j an D 1i?
(d) What is the presentation for Dn?
(e) Sketch a Cayley diagram for the group ha; b j a4 D 1; b4 D 1; a2 D b2; bab D a 1i.
Exercise 5.34. This exercise gives you a different look at S3 and S4 by looking at them
using a different set of generators than we have up until this point.
(a) The group S3 can be generated by the following two permutations. Make a Cayley

Exercise
5.35. This exercise analyzes the multiplication table for D5 in Figure 5.18,
relating it to a Cayley diagram for that same group, shown in the center of Figure5.17. It
begins with a generic question that will help us relate multiplication to Cayley diagrams,
and the remaining parts apply it to D5.
(a) Consider an equation like a  b D c about the elements a, b, and c in a group. What
part of a multiplication table for the group expresses the information a  b D c? What
part of a Cayley diagram for the group expresses the same information?
(b) The upper left quarter of the multiplication table for D5 in Figure 5.18 corresponds
to what portion of the Cayley diagram for D5 in Figure 5.17? Justify your answer
here using your answer from part (a).
(c) The lower left quarter of the multiplication table for D5 in Figure 5.18 corresponds
to what portion of the Cayley diagram for D5 in Figure 5.17? Justify your answer
here using your answer from part (a).
(d) Why do the diagonal stripes in the right half of the table in Figure 5.18 slant opposite
to those in the left half of the table? This part's answer, too, can be justified using
your answer from part (a).

Exercise 5.36.
(a) Is there a group in which no element (other than the identity) is its own inverse?
(b) The previous question was one of the three from page 63. Answer the other two as
well.
(c) In every group, any two orbits touch at the identity. Is there any group containing two
orbits that touch only at the identity? Is there any group containing two orbits that
touch at the identity and at exactly one other place?
(d) Find a group with at least two elements in it, and only one solution to the equation
x2 D e, the solution x D e.
(e) Find a group that has exactly two solutions to the equation x2 D e.
(f) Find a group that has more than two solutions to the equation x2 D e.
(g) Find a group with at least two elements in it, and only one solution to the equation
x3 D e, the solution x D e, or explain why no such group exists.
(h) Find a group that has more than two solutions to the equation x3 D e, or explain
why no such group exists.
(i) Find a group that has exactly two solutions to the equation x3 D e, or explain why
no such group exists.
Exercise 5.37.
(a) There are two different groups of order 6. What are their names? Specify which, if
any, are abelian.
(b) If there is only one group of a given order, to what family must it belong? Why?
(c) Find some values of n for which there is only one group of order n. Can you see
a pattern among the numbers you found? (Chapter 7 will talk about the pattern that
exists.)
Hint: The group library in Group Explorer may speed your search.
Exercise
5.38. Prove using algebra that if every element in a group has order 2, then
the group is abelian.
Exercise 5.39. In finite groups, the orbit of an element can be defined as all the positive
powers of that element; the orbit of a is Ëa1; a2; a3; a4; : : :	, a sequence which cannot
go on infinitely. Because the group is finite, eventually one of the elements encountered
(maybe a20, maybe a1000, maybe later) must be a repetition of an element already on the
list. Explain why this means that some power of a must equal e.
Exercise
5.40. The parts of this exercise ask you to explore the relationship among
the elements in D4, and how different layouts of its Cayley diagram can show those
relationships in different ways. Begin with the Cayley diagram you created for D4 in
Exercise 5.6. Ensure that it follows the pattern given in Figure 5.17.

5.5. Exercises
95
(a) Make another copy of this diagram with one change: Reorder the elements of the
inner ring so that the arrows representing r point clockwise in that ring, as they do in
the outer ring. In order for it to still be a Cayley diagram of D4, you must preserve
the same pattern of connections. Therefore some of your f arrows will be stretched
by this new layout, but try to stretch them as little as possible.
(b) Make another copy of the diagram, but this time arrange the nodes in two horizontal
rows, the top row proceeding through the orbit of r starting from e, and the bottom
row connected to the top row by four parallel f arrows.
(c) Make another copy of this two-row diagram, but this time arrange the bottom row
so that each element f rm is below the corresponding element rm for every number
m (between 0 and 3). The f arrows will no longer be parallel, but try to make it as
organized as possible.
(d) For each of these three new ways of laying out the dihedral group D4 (parts (a)
through (c)), explain what the Cayley diagram for an arbitrary dihedral group Dn
would look like if laid out similarly.
(e) In Group Explorer, open a Cayley diagram for the group D4. It defaults to the pattern
from Figure 5.17. How can you instruct Group Explorer to reorganize the nodes of the
diagram in the same ways you did in this exercise? (You may need to refer to Group
Explorer's built-in help system for information on manipulating Cayley diagrams.)
5.5.6
Cayleyâs theorem
Exercise 5.41. The following applications will give you some hands-on experience with
Cayley's theorem.
(a) Extract from the multiplication table of C2  C4 shown on the right of Figure 5.12
the eight permutations in S8 that behave like a copy of C2  C4. You may want to
make a copy of the table with the elements numbered from 1 to 8; the example in
Figure 5.31 may help.
(b) Extract from the Cayley diagram of D5 in Figure 5.17 the two permutations that
describe its arrows, following the example of Figure 5.30. Here it may also be useful
to number the elements, 1 to 10.
(c) Take the two permutations shown in Figure 5.30 and make a multiplication table
from them and all their combinations. Organize your table and highlight what each
permutation does to the identity element, as in Figure 5.32. The result should make
it clear that the multiplication table you created is one for D3, as shown in Figure
2.10 (under the name S3).
Exercise
5.42. Cayley's theorem says that any group is isomorphic to a collection of
permutations. If we restrict ourselves to only using permutations of three items (i.e., ele-
ments of S3), what groups can we form? For instance, we can obviously create all of S3
by taking every permutation of three elements, and we can obviously create the group C1
by just taking the identity permutation from S3. What other groups are possible?

96
5. Five families
Exercise 5.43. Repeating Exercise 5.42 for S4 would be lengthy, so rather than ask you
to search blindly, I will give you hints. All of the following groups can be built using
collections of permutations of four things (i.e., elements of S4). Find the appropriate
collection of permutations for each group given.
(a) every group of order 1, 2, 3, or 4 (for a total of five groups)
(b) the group D4
Hint: Apply the technique from Chapter 3 to a square. Recall Exercise 2.8.
(c) the group A4
Exercise 5.44. Although you can find a copy of C6 in S6 by simply taking the orbit of
the permutation shown here,
1
2
3
4

6
that is not the most \efficient" way to embed C6 in an Sn. The following permutation in
S5 also has order 6, and therefore its orbit is a copy of C6 as well.
1
2
3
4
5
Thus we can fit C6 in S6 in an obvious way, or in C5 with a little cleverness. So although
the easiest way to embed Cn in a symmetric group is by taking a permutation that cycles
the elements of Sn, for some n there is a way to embed Cn in a smaller symmetric group.
(a) For each n between 1 and 12, determine the smallest value of m such that Cn can be
expressed in Sm. Can you find any pattern or determine any strategy for computing
m from n?
(b) Does your answer change if instead of a copy of Cn, you must find in Sm a copy of
Dn?

Subgroups
Though the chapter title may not suggest it, you've come to the exciting part of this book!
Through five chapters, you've gained a lot of familiarity, learned the lay of the group
theory land, and are now ready for in-depth study. Starting with this chapter, we'll be
getting more analytical and learning more mathematical terminology, but without giving
up our visual roots. Entering advanced realms doesn't mean leaving visualization behind;
it can be just as helpful in advanced areas as in introductory ones, and often moreso. In
fact, the degree to which visualization has helped me better understand the material in
the latter half of this book is a large part of my motivation for writing it. This chapter
is exciting because it starts to bring the power of visualization to bear on a few of the
theorems and proofs in group theory, a trend that continues throughout the rest of the book.
Analyzing groups more deeply means asking questions about what kind of organizing
structure they have, how they relate to one another, how to construct large ones by
combining smaller ones, and how to dissect larger ones to expose the smaller ones inside.
This chapter and those to come answer all these questions, beginning with looking inside
groups to find smaller groups (subgroups). This chapter will be the foundation on which
the following chapters of advanced study build. It will also deepen our understanding of
the makeup of both the groups we know and our familiar means of visualizing them.
I begin laying that foundation with Section 6.1, which brings together the two paradigms
this book has presented so far. We have seen how to view a group as a collection of ac-
tions and how to view it as an operation on a set. Cayley diagrams illustrate the former,
action-based point of view and multiplication tables illustrate the latter, algebraic one.
The following section looks at one of the most important things the algebraic point of
view can teach us about Cayley diagrams, a concept called regularity. The remaining
sections of this chapter use that concept to simplify their analysis of subgroups.
6.1
What multiplication tables say about Cayley
diagrams
Multiplication tables are part of the algebraic view of groups, which encourages and
enables us to use equations to describe relationships among elements of a group. As we
97

98
6. Subgroups
know, such equations speak about Cayley diagrams by referring to their arrows. Consider
the Cayley diagram for S3, as shown on the left of Figure 5.17 on page 75. The equation
f rf D r 1 is true in S3 because the path f rf is the same as the path r 1, in the sense
that following an f arrow, then an r arrow, then another f arrow accomplishes the same
thing as following an r arrow in reverse.
This holds true regardless of where in the Cayley diagram you begin. Starting at
the identity, f rf and r  1 both lead to the same endpoint, r2, but starting at any other
element they both still lead to the same endpoint, though the particular endpoint will be
different. We can illustrate the equation f rf D r  1 by lifting out just those two paths
from the Cayley diagram for S3, as shown in Figure 6.1.
Figure 6.1. A Cayley diagram fragment representing the equation f rf D r 1. The top path,
followed left-to-right, is f rf , and the bottom path, followed left-to-right, is r 1. This diagram
indicates their equality by giving them common starting and ending points.
An algebraic equation is true not just about one portion of a Cayley diagram, but it is
true all across the diagram in the same way. The pattern in Figure 6.1 appears not just
in one part of a Cayley diagram for S3, but at every point in the whole diagram. This
is why I did not need to label the nodes in Figure 6.1; the pattern in that figure can fit
anywhere in a Cayley diagram for S3.
And that pattern is not the only one that permeates a Cayley diagram for S3. Any
other equation from S3 can also be represented by a pattern that appears throughout every
Cayley diagram for that group. Thus Cayley diagrams always have a uniform symmetry;
every part of the diagram is structured like every other. We cannot have f rf D r 1
true at some part of a Cayley diagram and yet false in another part of the same Cayley
diagram.
Definition 6.1 (regular). I call a diagram regular if it repeats every one of its internal
patterns throughout the whole diagram, in the sense discussed above.1 In particular, every
Cayley diagram is regular; diagrams lacking regularity do not represent groups, and so
we do not call them Cayley diagrams.
For instance, consider the arrows in the Cayley diagram in Figure 6.2 as representing
actions and the numbers 0 through 7 as situations through which those actions navigate.
Then in any of situations 4 through 7, if we call the red action r, then we can see that
the equation r 2 D 0 is true. Yet in situations 0 through 3, things change; r 2 Â¤ 0 in any
of those situations. The diagram is not regular, and thus it is not a Cayley diagram; it
does not describe a group.
Regularity shows us how groups embody symmetry. We have used groups to measure
symmetry, and said that Cayley diagrams faithfully represent groups; regularity is one of
1 I use the term regular because the property I'm speaking of comes from [16], which classifies Cayley
diagrams as those graphs whose automorphism groups have a subgroup that acts regularly on the diagram's
nodes, a more technical way to describe this same property.

6.2. Seeing subgroups
99
the consequences of that faithful representation. Every part of a group looks like every
other part. Groups themselves are full of symmetry.
6.1.1
Perfecting our unofficial definition
In Exercise 4.16, I asked you to inspect two Cayley diagrams, one of which is repeated in
Figure 6.2. Exercises 2.14 through 2.17 asked you to come up with criteria for determining
if a diagram represents a group as defined in Definition 1.9. The diagram in Figure 6.2
satisfies all of them! Therefore, from the viewpoint of the unofficial Definition 1.9, such
a diagram would seem to describe a group. This is why I called that definition unofficial;
for the sake of keeping Chapter 1 simple, I left out a technical point.

Figure 6.2. A diagram that satisfies many of the criteria for being a Cayley diagram, but violates
one: equations about relationships among the generators change from one part of the diagram to
another.
That technical point is what was stated above: a diagram is not a Cayley diagram
(i.e., it does not describe a group) unless it is regular. I omitted any reference to regularity
of diagrams in Chapter 1 because it requires speaking of equations, which it was too
early to bring up. The informal argument in Section 4.4, that any group by Definition
1.9 is a group by Definition 4.2, glossed over this detail by nature of its informality. A
rigorous argument would require making our informal definition mathematically precise;
this could be done by incorporating regularity.
But there is no need to do so; we have gained what we need from the introduction
of regularity, a better understanding of Cayley diagrams, in preparation for the coming
sections. I will be using Cayley diagrams as our primary visualization tool for the rest
of this book (occasionally also referring to multiplication tables when they are helpful).
The following sections use this new idea of regularity to prove some essential theorems
about subgroups.
6.2
Seeing subgroups
As we became acquainted with a wide variety of groups in Chapter 5, we talked a bit about
their internal structure. Most importantly, we saw that every group has one or more cyclic
groups inside it, called orbits. It's now time to take this idea beyond just cyclic groups.
Definition 6.2 (subgroup). When one group is completely contained in another, the inner
group is called a subgroup of the outer one. When a group H is a subgroup of a group
G, the standard way to write this is H < G.

Figure 6.3. Three Cayley diagrams highlighting easy-to-spot subgroups.
All the orbits we saw in Chapter 5 are subgroups. For instance, the orbit of r in S3,
fe; r; r2g, is a cyclic subgroup of order 3, a copy of C3. We can write fe; r; r2g < S3, or
if we're less concerned with formality, even C3 < S3. This is the first example shown in
Figure 6.3. The second example in that figure, fe; f g < S3, is also an orbit, but the third
example is not, because the highlighted subgroup is not just a single cycle. The generator
notation from Exercise 4.25 (page 59) gives us a handy way to describe these subgroups.
For example fe; r; r2g is generated by r, and thus can be more succinctly written hri.
The other two examples in Figure 6.3 are therefore hf i and h001; 010i.
Every single group has some kind of subgroup, for the following two reasons. The
identity by itself, feg, is a copy of C1 in any group, called the trivial subgroup. And techni-
cally every group is a subgroup of itself (e.g., S3 < S3), called the non-proper subgroup.
The example subgroups in Figure 6.3 are easy to spot. We are familiar with these
small groups from earlier chapters and can recognize their Cayley diagrams on sight,
probably even if Figure 6.3 hadn't highlighted them for us. But not every subgroup in
every Cayley diagram is visually obvious. Figure 6.4 shows two less obvious examples,
yet they are by no means as visually obscure as subgroups can be. To visualize subgroups,
we therefore need a method for bringing them out of hiding.

6.3. Revealing subgroups
101
6.3
Revealing subgroups
Any subgroup can be revealed by a suitable reorganization of the group's Cayley diagram.
For example, recall Figure 5.29 on page 83, which shows two Cayley diagrams for A5.
One of these diagrams is organized to emphasize a cyclic subgroup of order five, and the
other to emphasize a cyclic subgroup of order three. The five- and three-cycles are visible
in the respective diagrams. This section explains how to reorganize Cayley diagrams to
emphasize specific subgroups; I explain a similar strategy for multiplication tables in
Exercise 6.26.
The language of generators makes it easier to discuss how Cayley diagrams and multi-
plication tables are organized. Consider the example C6 D f0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5g. This group can
be generated several ways, including C6 D h1i and C6 D h5i. Perhaps unexpectedly, we
can also write C6 D h2; 3i. If indeed the fact C6 D h2; 3i surprises you, I recommend tak-
ing a moment to verify that you can create every element of C6 using just 2, 3, and addition
mod 6. Neither 2 nor 3 alone generates C6, but together they do. These different ways to
generate C6 give rise to correspondingly different ways to connect a Cayley diagram of C6
with arrows, an idea you may remember from Exercise2.9. Each is shown in Figure 6.5.
The left two diagrams in Figure 6.5 clearly represent a six-element cyclic group, but
the right two diagrams disguise the cycle. The left two diagrams emphasize the non-proper
subgroup h1i D C6, while each of the right two emphasizes both of the subgroups h2i
and h3i. Take a moment to spot the subgroups h2i and h3i in each of the right two Cayley
diagrams in Figure 6.5.
The moral of the story is that we can make any subgroup visually prominent in a
Cayley diagram by choosing generators for the group that include the generators of that
subgroup. Sometimes it is also necessary to then choose a new layout for the nodes that
untangles the resulting connections. This is how I brought out the subgroups h2i and h3i: I
generated C6 as h2; 3i, resulting in the third diagram in Figure 6.5. I then reorganized that
diagram to look cleaner, resulting in the rightmost diagram in the same figure. Because
there is sometimes more than one clear, useful layout, there is not necessarily one \perfect"
or \correct" one; it may be a matter of preference.
Judicious choices of arrows and new layouts enable us to reveal hidden subgroups
like h2i < C6. You can experiment easily with different ways to generate and organize
Cayley diagrams using Group Explorer; refer to its documentation for details.

you spot the difference?

6. Subgroups
6.4
Cosets
The first step towards a deeper study of subgroups is to notice that identical copies of each
subgroup appear throughout the rest of the group's Cayley diagram. For instance, consider
the copy of C3 in S3, shown on the left of Figure 6.3. That same cyclic, three-element
structure is repeated as the inner ring of the Cayley diagram (although it is reversed).
Similarly, the copy of C2 in S3 shown in the middle of Figure 6.3 is repeated twice more
throughout the diagram, as Figure 6.6 shows.

Figure 6.6. Copies of the subgroup hf i in S3
But not all those copies are subgroups. A subgroup, because it is a group, must have
an identity element. In Figure 6.6 only the leftmost copy fe; f g contains e. Furthermore,
multiplying two elements in fr; rf g, for example, does not yield another element in that
set. For this reason also, it is not a group. So the sets fr; rf g and fr2; r2f g have a
different name; they are called cosets, to indicate that they are copies of a subgroup
structurally, but are not themselves groups.
Learning about subgroups and their cosets will reveal important structural properties
about groups in general. Let's begin by making a few observations about cosets. I call
them \observations" rather than theorems because they are simple enough that I can
justify them with informal comments. A concept that shows up several times below is
the regularity in every Cayley diagram, a concept introduced in Section 6.1. The first
observation points out that cosets aren't specific to the example in Figure 6.6.
Observation 6.3. Every subgroup has cosets, and they cover every node of the group's
Cayley diagram.
Let's see why this observation is true. In Figure6.3, what allowed us to write fe; f g as
hf i and f000; 001; 010; 011g as h001; 010i was that every group has a set of generators,
even if that group is a subgroup of another. We can visualize how a subgroup is generated
by exploring from the identity node in a Cayley diagram using just the generators for that
subgroup.
But such exploration could be done from any node. We could explore using the gen-
erators for a subgroup H, but starting at any other element g in the larger group G. The
regularity of the diagram means that such exploration will reveal the same pattern no
matter where it begins. Thus such an exploration will trace out a structural copy of H
beginning at g. So a Cayley diagram for G is full of copies of H touching every element
of G.
Observation 6.4. We can also describe cosets algebraically. The copy of H based at a
is named aH.

6.4. Cosets
103
The choice of the name aH is not arbitrary. Recall that to multiply ab in a Cayley
diagram, start from the node a and follow the path for b. The meaning of aH in a Cayley
diagram is similar: Start from the node a and follow all the paths in H. This describes the
copy of H based at a, so the naming convention makes sense. Following that convention,
the middle coset in Figure 6.6 is called rhf i and the right one is r 2hf i.
I have described how to compute a coset aH visually, but we can compute it alge-
braically as well. To do so, multiply the element a by the list of elements of H, with a
the left element in each multiplication, as suggested by the name aH. An example of this
computation for the coset rhf i is shown here.
rhf i D rfe; f g D fr  e; r  f g D fr; rf g
For this reason all the cosets we have seen are actually called left cosets, because the
multiplication is done on the left. I introduce the complementary notion of right cosets
after two final observations.
Observation 6.5. Each coset can have more than one name.
For example, rhf i is the name given to the middle coset in Figure 6.6, because it is
the copy of hf i based at r. However, it is just as true to say that it is the copy of hf i
based at rf . As another example, consider the subgroup highlighted in C2  C2  C2 in
Figure 6.3 (call it H). The coset behind H could be described as 100H, 101H, 110H,
or 111H, because exploration using the generators of H from any one of those elements
reaches the same coset. The regularity in the subgroup's Cayley diagram is what makes
this so.
Whenever a left coset aH contains an element b, we could just as easily have called
the coset by the name bH. Since aH means the copy of H containing a and bH means
the copy of H containing b, they refer to the same copy of H. Let's make this our final
observation.
Observation 6.6. If b is in aH, then aH D bH.2
Thus in Figure 6.6, we can also call rhf i by the name rf hf i, and r2hf i by the name
r2f hf i. The element you choose to use to name the coset is called the representative.
Let us put left cosets aside for a moment and find out about their counterparts, right
cosets, which I have mentioned but not yet showed. From an algebraic point of view, you
can probably guess how I will describe right cosets; a right coset Ha is computed just
like a left coset, but the multiplication is done on the right. The right cosets of hf i in S3
are therefore
hf ir D fe; f gr D fe  r; f  rg D fr; r2f g and
hf ir2 D fe; f gr2 D fe  r2; f  r2g D fr2; rf g:
Neither of these right cosets matches either of the left cosets of hf i we saw. Therefore
they must look different in the Cayley diagram. Let's see how they look.
To compute a right coset visually, reverse the process for left cosets: Start with the
subgroup hf i and follow the path for r from each element of that subgroup. The resulting
set of destinations is the right coset hf ir. Notice how this agrees with the algebraic
computation; it multiplies each element of the subgroup on the right by r.
2 A more formal argument justifying Observation6.6 can be obtained by doing Exercise 6.15.

Figure 6.7. The left diagram shows the left coset rhf i in S3, the nodes that f arrows can
reach after the path to r has been followed. The right diagram shows the right coset hf ir in S3,
the nodes that r arrows can reach from the elements in hf i.
Figure 6.7 compares the computations of rhf i and hf ir in a Cayley diagram. Figure
6.8 moves beyond that specific example, showing the distinction between left and right
cosets in a Cayley diagram more generally. The reason that left cosets look like copies of
the subgroup while the elements of right cosets are usually more scattered is that I adopted
the convention that arrows represent right multiplication. If I had used the convention
where arrows represent left multiplication, right cosets would have been copies of the
subgroup and left cosets would have been scattered.

arrows take the elements of H, as in the right illustration.
The subgroup hf i < S3 was a good first example because it showed us that left and
right cosets are generally different. But because they are not always different, it is worth
also seeing an example of when left and right cosets come out equal. Figure6.9 illustrates

The visual computation of left and right cosets in multiplication tables. The
computations of gH and Hg are exemplified for H D fe; f g and g D r2 in the group S3.
such a situation using the subgroup H D h.0; 1/i < C3  C3. Although it only depicts
the equality gH D Hg for g D .1; 0/, we would find gH D Hg to be true no matter
which value of g we choose. Subgroups for which this is true are given the special name
normal, and we will learn their importance in Chapter 7.
Computing left and right cosets using multiplication tables is also straightforward; I
show how in Figure 6.10. I have ordered the row and column headings in the multiplication
tables in that figure according to the subgroup hf i and its left cosets. The left coset r2hf i
must appear in the r 2 row under the e and f columns, because those cells hold the results
of r2  e and r2  f . In any multiplication table, you can compute left cosets this way;
the elements of gH are in the g row under the H columns. On the other hand, the right
coset Hg can be computed in a similar way, but with the words \rows" and \columns"
interchanged: Hg appears under the g column in the H rows.
6.5
Lagrangeâs theorem
Allow me to draw your attention to a pattern in all the examples of subgroups and their
cosets that we've seen so far. Observation 6.3 stated that the left cosets of a subgroup
cover the whole group. And in all the examples we've seen so far, not only is this true,
but every element in the group has actually been in exactly one left coset. Figure 6.6
shows us not only that the left cosets of hf i cover all of S3, but also that no element is
in more than one of them; no two cosets overlap. This was also true of the right cosets
of hf i we computed in the previous section, although we did not illustrate them.
Because the cosets of hf i do not overlap, I can consolidate all of Figure6.6 into one
Cayley diagram, with a color for each coset, as on the left of Figure 6.11. The right of
Figure 6.11 shows a similar diagram, but for right cosets. The coloring schemes in these
diagrams are possible because no element belongs to more than one coset, and thus no
element requires more than one color.
When a collection is separated into categories, each item ending up in exactly one
category, mathematicians call this a partition. Figure 6.11 shows that the left cosets of
hf i partition S3 and the right cosets of hf i do also, but differently. A careful look at
Figure 6.9 reveals that the cosets of h.0; 1/i also partition C3  C3.

Figure 6.11. The left Cayley diagram for S3 shows how the group is partitioned by the left
cosets of the subgroup fe; f g; the right diagram shows how S3 is partitioned by the right cosets
of fe; f g.
The natural question is therefore whether this pattern we've noticed is a coincidence.
Do the cosets of a subgroup always partition the group? The answer is given by the
following theorem. I keep things simpler by dealing only with left cosets; Exercise 6.16
asks you to think through the same question for right cosets.
Theorem 6.7. If H is a subgroup of G, then each element of G belongs to exactly one
left coset of H.
Proof. Suppose the element g of G appears to belong to two different left cosets, say
aH and bH. In such a case, aH and bH must actually be two different names for the
same coset (in the sense of Observation 6.5); here's why.
Since g is in aH, we can conclude that gH D aH, based on Observation 6.6. And
since g is also in bH, we know gH D bH for the same reason. The reason, then, that
aH D bH is that both are equal to gH.
Theorem 6.7 teaches us to think of a group as being composed exclusively of non-
overlapping copies of any subgroup (that subgroup's left cosets). We saw a specific
example of this in Figure 6.11, and you can easily picture a similar division of C3  C3
suggested by Figure 6.9. The shapes of these two example partitions are different, but
the abstract idea is the same in both cases. That idea, that cosets partition a group, is
depicted a few ways in Figure 6.12.
Picturing groups this way reveals an important relationship between a group and each
of its subgroups, expressed in the following important theorem, named after the Italian-

of cosets in a diagram differs based on the layout of the diagram, so each of these illustrations
represents the same idea, but for a different type of Cayley diagram layout.

6.5. Lagrangeâs theorem
107
born mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange. In stating the theorem, I use the standard
notation jGj to mean the size (order) of the group G. Although there is a version of this
theorem for infinite groups, in this section we assume G is finite.
Theorem
6.8 (Lagrange's Theorem). If H < G, then the order jHj of the subgroup
divides the order jGj of the larger group.
Here I'm using the word divides in its common mathematical sense, as shorthand for
\divides evenly into." In other words, we say that a smaller whole number divides a larger
when the smaller number is one of the factors of the larger. Six divides twelve, but not
twenty, because 20  6 leaves a remainder; the division does not come out \even."
Proof. Theorem 6.7 proved that the group G is partitioned into copies of H. So the size
of G can be determined just by counting how many copies of H there are and multiplying
that number by the size of each one, the number jHj. So if n is the number of left cosets
(including H itself), we can write the equation
jGj D
repeated n times
â
â¦â
Æ
jHj C jHj C    C jHj D n jHj :
The number n in the above proof comes up so frequently in the study of groups and
their subgroups that it has a name.
Definition 6.9 (index). If H < G then the index of H in G, written ÅG W HÂ, is how
many times jHj goes into jGj.
ÅG W HÂ D jGj
jHj
The index is the number of left cosets of H, if we count H itself as a coset. Most of the
time when the word coset is used, it is understood that the subgroup itself is both a left
and a right coset of itself, because H D eH D He.
You will notice that the index ÅG W HÂ must also divide jGj, because the above
equation could also be written as
jHj D
jGj
ÅG W HÂ:
Let's make these ideas concrete by returning to the example of hf i < S3. The order
of S3 is 6, which we can see is the sum of the sizes of the three cosets of order 2. The
index of hf i in S3 is therefore 3, because it has three cosets.

Since Lagrange's Theorem has a famous mathematician's name attached to it, you
may suspect that it has some interesting implications. Your suspicion would be correct!
One important use of the theorem is that it significantly narrows down the possibilities
for subgroups. For instance, in a group of order 8, you know not to bother looking for
subgroups of order 3, 5, 6, or 7, because none of those numbers divides 8. More generally,

108
6. Subgroups
in any group G, you know not to look for subgroups H with jHj > jGj
2 , because numbers
larger than half of jGj cannot divide jGj. (The only exception here is the one non-proper
subgroup H D G.) When you try the exercises in this chapter, keep these shortcuts in
mind.
A natural and fruitful question is whether Lagrange's Theorem can be \turned around."
The theorem states that if there is a subgroup H, then its order divides jGj. \Turning this
around" means asking if for every n that divides jGj, we can find a subgroup H < G of
order n. The short answer is no, and Exercise 6.31 will guide you in demonstrating why.
But some modified versions of this turned-around Lagrange's Theorem are both true and
useful. Among them are the Sylow Theorems, which we will study in Chapter 9.
Be sure to try the exercises in Section 6.6.3 on Hasse diagrams, because Chapter 10
depends on an understanding of such diagrams. They help us understand the relationships
among subgroups in general.

Exercise 6.15. Leading up to Observation 6.6, I gave an informal explanation of why

b is in the left coset aH, and answer the following questions.

1. At the top of the Hasse diagram we place the whole group, and at the bottom the
trivial subgroup feg.
2. Subgroups are arranged between, with larger ones higher up.
3. Vertical or diagonal lines connect smaller subgroups to those larger subgroups that
contain the smaller ones.
Here are two examples, the Hasse diagram for all subgroups of C5 on the left, and for

Organizing visualizations
Exercise
6.25. In each of the following cases, draw a Cayley diagram for the given
group that emphasizes the given subgroup. Choose a layout for the nodes that clusters
together each left coset of the given subgroup.
(a) the subgroup h2i in C4
(b) the subgroup h3i in C9
(c) the subgroup h011; 110i of C2  C2  C2, as diagrammed in Figure 6.3
(d) the subgroup hr 2; f i of D4 D hr; f i
Hint: Use arrows for r, r2, and f .
(e) the subgroup A4 of S4
Hint: Take a Cayley diagram for S4 from Chapter 5, label an element as the identity,
and then square each element in the diagram visually (treating it as a path from the
identity node). This quick, visual way to compute A4 results in a diagram that must
simply be reorganized to cluster A4 apart from its one coset.
Exercise 6.26. Layouts for multiplication tables are determined by the ordering of the
elements along the row and column headings. For most purposes, the order across the
column headings should match the order down the row headings, and so just one order
should be chosen.
It is usually helpful to order the elements in an organized way. If the group is cyclic,
the natural order is the sequence of the cycle. Otherwise, choose a subgroup to list first,
and then list its cosets in order thereafter, as was done in Figure 6.10.
Doing so emphasizes the subgroup by placing that subgroup's multiplication table in
the upper left corner of the larger multiplication table. You can see this in Figure 6.10
and in the following table, organized by the subgroup hri in S3.

Notice that the elements of the subgroup, too, are ordered using the same principles|
because it is cyclic, they are in the order of the cycle; if the subgroup had not been cyclic,
I would have chosen one of its subgroups to help me organize it, and so on.

Exercise 6.27. The previous exercises had you organize Cayley diagrams and multipli-
cation tables in different ways. Are there also different ways to organize cycle graphs? If
so, what significance do they have? Can they be used to emphasize specific subgroups?
Why or why not?

Finding examples
When doing the exercises in this section, rely upon the library of groups you learned in
Chapter 5.
Exercise 6.28. For each of the following questions, either find a group that answers the
question in the affirmative or give a clear explanation of why the answer to the question
is negative.
(a) Is there a non-cyclic group all of whose proper subgroups are cyclic?
(b) Is there a non-abelian group all of whose proper subgroups are abelian?
Exercise 6.29. For each of the following questions, either find a group that answers the
question in the affirmative or give a clear explanation of why the answer to the question
is negative.
(a) Is there a group of order 8 with a subgroup whose cosets partition the group into two
different cosets (each coset therefore containing four elements)?
(b) Is there a group of order 8 with a subgroup whose cosets partition the group into
eight different cosets (each element in its own coset)?
(c) Is there a group of order 8 with a subgroup whose cosets partition the group into just
one big cluster (every element in one coset)?
(d) Is there a group of order 30 with a subgroup whose cosets partition the group into
20 different cosets?
(e) Is there an abelian group with a subgroup whose left and right cosets partition the
group differently?
Exercise 6.30. For each integer n between 1 and 5, find a non-abelian group G with a
subgroup H such that jHj  3 and ÅG W HÂ D n.
Exercise 6.31. This exercise investigates subgroups of A4. By Lagrange's Theorem, the
only sizes possible for subgroups of A4 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
You can either do the work of this exercise using permutations, or using the following
multiplication table for A4. In it, the elements are colored according to their order: a, b,
c, and d are of order 3, while the elements x, y, and z are of order 2. This coloring
should prove helpful in answering the questions below.

Products and quotients
Chapter 6 looked inside groups to find subgroups, and so taught us something about
the groups' internal structure. This chapter moves in the opposite direction, showing
how groups can be assembled together to construct larger groups. We will learn two
such construction processes, each a different kind of group product operation. Here I'm
using the word \product" in its mathematical sense, meaning a kind of multiplication.
We will also learn how certain subgroups can be the key to reversing such a process,
facilitating a quotient operation that deconstructs any kind of product, revealing how
a larger group may be constructed from smaller groups. This will enable us to picture
clearly and simply the structure of many large groups, bringing otherwise large, complex
objects within intellectual reach.
This chapter therefore teaches three processes: how to perform each of two product
operations and how to perform a quotient operation. Each process is illustrated by several
examples, and the exercises at the end of the chapter ask you to practice each of these
processes. It is essential to \get your hands dirty" with such practice, because doing so
strengthens your intuition for both the processes themselves and the groups that they
construct and deconstruct.
I have organized this chapter's exercises to help you build your intuition one topic at
a time. Each section in the chapter corresponds to a section in the exercises. So when you
finish reading Section 7.1, if you feel you need to practice those concepts to strengthen
your understanding before reading further, you can jump straight to the exercises in Section
7.6.1, which cover only the material from Section 7.1. Each section in the chapter follows
this pattern, so that the material can be digested in bite-sized pieces.
We begin with the simpler of the two product operations we will study, the direct
product.
7.1
The direct product
You have seen some direct product groups already in this book. Every group whose name
contains the multiplication symbol  can be constructed using a process called the direct

product. The first such groups we saw were C3  C3 and C2  C2  C2 in Figure 2.10,
but we have seen others since then, such as C2  C4 in Figure 5.9. For convenience, I
repeat the Cayley diagrams for these three groups in Figure 7.1. The  symbol is often
pronounced \cross" or \times," so you might read C2  C4 as \cee two cross cee four."
It is not a requirement that direct products only involve various Cn, but small examples
usually do. In a few pages we will come to the larger example S3  C2.
Section 7.1.1 explains how to construct direct product groups and demonstrates the
process on several examples. After that introduction to direct product groups, we will be
prepared to learn how they will benefit our study of group theory in general (Section 7.1.3).
Before we learn the details of the direct product operation, let's pick up a few funda-
mentals by inspecting the examples in Figure 7.1. Those diagrams show us two reasons
why the operation we are about to learn is a product, and uses the  notation. First, the
diagram of C3  C3 is obviously a three-by-three (3  3) grid, making the name C3  C3
sensible. Second, C3  C3 is therefore obviously a group with nine elements, since after
all, 3  3 D 9. These same two basic ideas also hold for C2  C4 (a two-by-four grid of
eight elements) and C2  C2  C2 (a two-by-two-by-two grid of eight elements), as we
can see from the figure.
7.1.1
Constructing a direct product visually
I introduce the direct product construction as a visual procedure. From Cayley diagrams
for groups A and B, we will create a Cayley diagram for the group AB as described in
Definition 7.1. Each step in the process is exemplified in Figure 7.2, using the groups C2
and C4 for A and B, respectively. The example therefore constructs the middle diagram
from Figure 7.1. I later extend this method to cover multiplication tables, and from there
we can gain an algebraic understanding of it.
Definition 7.1 (technique for constructing direct products using Cayley diagrams). To
create a Cayley diagram of A B from Cayley diagrams of A and B, proceed as follows.
1. Begin with the Cayley diagram for A.
In the example in Figure 7.2, the group A D C2 appears on the left.
2. Inflate each node in the Cayley diagram of A and place in it a copy of the Cayley
diagram for B.
In the middle of Figure 7.2, each of the two nodes of C2 grew taller to contain a copy
of a Cayley diagram for C4.

3. Remove the (inflated) nodes of A while using the arrows of A to connect corresponding
nodes from each copy of B. That is, remove the A diagram but treat its arrows as a
blueprint for how to connect corresponding nodes in the copies of B.
In the example in Figure 7.2, each C4 has four nodes. Thus the top pair of nodes
correspond to one another, and we connect them as a little copy of C2. We do the
same with the pair below them, and so on through all four pairs, resulting in a complete
Cayley diagram for C2  C4. Because this step is more complicated than the first two,
Figure 7.3 is devoted to illustrating this step alone.
From the diagram created in Step 2
of Definition 7.1,
remove the outer nodes from A
(which in this case is C2),
and spread the arrows of A over cor-
responding elements from each copy
of B (in this case C4).
The result is one unified diagram for
A  B, in this case C2  C4.
Figure 7.3. An example execution of Step 3 of Definition 7.1, illustrated in greater detail than
Figure 7.2 shows. As in Figure 7.2, in this example, A D C2 and B D C4.

120
7. Products and quotients
The group A  B whose Cayley diagram results from the procedure in Definition 7.1
is called the direct product of A and B, and we call A and B its factors. Note that it
was essential to use different colors for A arrows than B arrows in Step 2, so that the
merge in Step 3 created a valid diagram. Note also that it was helpful (though not strictly
essential) to orient the copies of B perpendicular to the copy of A.
Notice that C2 C4 has copies of C2 as its rows and copies of C4 as its columns. The
process described in Definition 7.1 uses two copies of C4 and connects corresponding
pairs of nodes from each copy, turning each pair into a copy of C2. But the same diagram
would have been achieved doing the product in the other order. Figure 7.4 shows that
the direct product C4  C2 gives a group that is isomorphic to C2  C4. The C4  C2
structure is simply the C2  C4 structure turned on its side. It turns out that A B always
has the same structure as B  A, for any groups A and B. We say that the direct product
operation is commutative, and Exercise 8.36 asks you to prove it. For now, I use this fact
without having given evidence for it.

Figure 7.4. Constructing a Cayley diagram for the group C4  C2, using Cayley diagrams of
C4 and C2 and following the procedure in Definition 7.1. The result is a group that is equivalent
to C2  C4, as constructed in Figure 7.2.
The nodes in the Cayley diagrams that the direct product process creates have no
labels, but it would be helpful if they did so that we may refer to individual elements by
name. There is a standard way to give names to the elements in a direct product group.
High school algebra courses teach students to label points in the plane with names like
.1; 3/ and . 10; 6/. These names are .x; y/ pairs, the left number designating the point's
x position and the right number its y position. In AB, we give each element a name that
is a pair .a; b/, with the a coming from A and the b coming from B. In the two simple
examples we've seen so far, we can follow the high school algebra convention, with the
first entry in the pair (the a) representing horizontal position, and the second entry (the b)
representing vertical position, as shown in Figure 7.5.1 In general, for a node in any direct
product Cayley diagram, both components of its name come from Step 2 of Definition
7.1. A node gets the a component of its name from the inflated A node to which it
belonged, and the b component of its name from the inner B node that it once was. In
the simple examples in Figure 7.5, these correspond to columns and rows, respectively.
Given our recent work with subgroups, you may have noticed that C2 is a subgroup
of C2  C4; specifically, it is the subgroup h.1; 0/i. Furthermore, the cosets of h.1; 0/i are
clearly visible as the rows of C2  C4. They are both left and right cosets, which makes
1 You could instead choose to do it the other way around, following the row-then-column convention of
matrix algebra. The difference is superficial. In more complicated examples, it won't be possible to keep the
horizontal/vertical distinction, but it's helpful when getting started.

rise to it in Step 2 of Definition 7.1. Colored numbers are used to make it easier to see that the
names of the inflated A nodes go on the left of each pair, and the names of the inner B nodes on
the right.
C2 a normal subgroup. I mentioned normal subgroups in passing in Chapter 6, but they
will be important throughout this chapter, so it's time for a formal definition.
Definition 7.2 (normal subgroup). A subgroup H < G is called normal if each left
coset of H is also a right coset of H (and vice versa). We indicate that H is a normal
subgroup of G by writing H C G.
We can therefore write the fact we just noticed as h.1; 0/i C C2  C4. Similarly, C4
is normal in C2  C4 as the subgroup h.0; 1/i and its cosets are the columns of C2  C4.
We will see that the factors in any direct product are normal subgroups (Exercise 7.12).
That is, for any groups A and B, we will always have A C A  B and B C A  B.
7.1.2
More direct product examples
Let's flesh out our understanding of the direct product by moving beyond the basic
example of C2  C4, to the group C2  C2  C2, which we first saw long ago in Figure
2.10. A three-dimensional direct product, such as C2  C2  C2, can be thought of as two
products taken successively, as in .C2  C2/  C2. The parentheses suggest we should
first compute C2  C2, and then take the direct product of that group with C2 again. This
involves using the process in Definition 7.1 twice in succession, as illustrated in Figure
7.6. Notice that each time a diagram's nodes are inflated to contain copies of C2, a new
direction is used for the sake of clarity. The first inflation creates vertical C2 copies and
the second creates C2 copies that extend deeper into the page, perpendicular to it. The
result is a two-by-two-by-two grid, as the name C2  C2  C2 suggests.
Thinking of the group as .C2  C2/  C2 suggests assigning the elements awkward
names like ..0; 1/; 0/. The usual convention, however, is to use only one set of parentheses,
naming group elements things like .0; 1; 0/. The first number in this three-part name is
an element from the first C2 factor, the second is from the second, and the third is from

the third. Similarly, for a group like C2  C2  C2  C2, elements will have names
like .1; 0; 1; 1/, and so on for larger products. I occasionally shorten such names to
make diagrams easier to read, as I did in Figure 2.10, dropping parentheses and commas
altogether and turning .0; 1; 0/ into 010. This shortening is handy for making diagrams
readable, as long as the names of the elements remain clear.
Our final example, S3  C2, involves a slightly larger, non-abelian group. It is not
convenient to line up all the nodes in S3 in one row, as I did in the previous example,
so I render it as I have before, as on the left of Figure 7.7. When filling each node in S3
with a copy of C2 inthe middle of that figure, I align the copies of C2 to extend deeper
into the page, as I did in the C2  C2  C2 example. The result, on the right of Figure

7.1.3
Why direct products?
We have seen how to construct direct products, but of what value is this technique? It is
one of several common, simple techniques for creating larger groups. If we understand the
technique, we can understand some large groups more simply. This section explains how,
using the fact that the factors in a direct product are independent. In a Cayley diagram
for A  B, following A arrows neither impacts nor is impacted by the location in group
B.
For example, in the C4C2 diagram I constructed in Figure 7.4, following a horizontal
(C4) arrow navigates to a new column, but stays in the same row. Another way to say it
is that the green A arrows only impact the left component of each element's name (the
A component). The orbit of the green arrow in C4  C2 is as follows.
(0, 0)
(1, 0)
(2, 0)
(3, 0)
(0, 0)
â¦
Similarly, following a vertical (C2) arrow changes the row and thus the second component
of the element name, but stays in the same column and thus keeps the first component of
the element name the same.
(0, 0)
(0, 1)
(0, 0)
â¦
In a sense, the A arrows move you only in A and not in B, and the B arrows move you
only in B but not in A. This independence of the two factors in a direct product leads to
a new, useful way to think about direct product groups, which I now introduce.
We normally think of navigating a Cayley diagram by picturing each node as a place
and the arrows as paths between places. You can picture yourself located at just one node
at a time, and walking a path to get to another. As you do this imaginary walk through
a group, what would it be like to stop and check a roadside map? Such a map could be
a Cayley diagram for the group, with a \You are here" marker pointing to the node in
which you stand, like one of the maps in Figure 7.8.

7. Products and quotients
Navigating a direct product group can be thought of as navigating two different Cayley
diagrams simultaneously, and independently. Figure 7.9 shows maps analogous to those
in Figure 7.8, but each map in Figure 7.9 shows two groups and highlights a location in
each. Perhaps rather than trying to imagine yourself in two places at once, imagine yourself
remotely directing the movements of two others, sometimes instructing one person who's
walking in C4 which path to follow, and at other times instructing another person who's
walking in C2 to move. Your directing two people through two Cayley diagrams is a
perfect analogy to your navigating the direct product group by yourself. Each node in
C4  C2 is named for a C4 node and a C2 node, and we can interpret those names as
horizontal and vertical positions of the original node in the C4C2 grid, or as two different
nodes in separate diagrams, one for C4 and one for C2. For instance, the element .1; 0/ in
C4C2 can mean either the node in the second row and first column in the C4C2 diagram
in Figure 7.5, or it can mean the second roadside map in the top row of Figure7.9. Thus we
have two equivalent ways to think of a direct product group like C4  C2. We can think
of the direct product Cayley diagram, or of two Cayley diagrams used in tandem.

Figure 7.9. Each of these maps depicts a two-part location as you simultaneously navigate the
two groups C4 and C2.
Let me make clear what I mean when I ask you to imagine directing two people who
move independently. The motions of either person have no impact on either the position
or the motion of the other person. A situation without such independence is shown in the
rectangular Cayley diagram for D4 in Figure 7.10. Vertical movements in that diagram can
change horizontal positions, and thus the horizontal is not independent from the vertical.
For instance, moving vertically from .1; 0/ does not result in .1; 1/, but rather in .3; 1/. In
C4  C2, however, a vertical move from .1; 0/ would result in .1; 1/, causing no change
in horizontal position. Although you could rearrange and rename the nodes of D4 to fix

this one problematic column, the tangles inherent in the structure of D4 would create
similar problems in other columns as you did so.
We saw our first example of two groups joined independently in Figure 2.8 on page
20. In the two-lightswitch group, each switch is independent of the other in the sense that
flipping either one leaves the other unchanged. Alone, each switch is described by the
group C2, and so together, they are described by the group C2  C2, the more common
name for which is V4.
One of the benefits of viewing direct products as two groups to be navigated simulta-
neously is that some large groups become simpler to visualize. For instance, rather than
draw the 56-element group D4  C7 as a rather messy 56-node Cayley diagram, we can
instead draw two side-by-side Cayley diagrams, one for D4 and one for C7, and picture
navigating them simultaneously and independently. Elements such as .r2; 5/ represent
two positions, one in D4 and one in C7, as shown in Figure 7.11. This involves drawing
(and reading) many fewer nodes and arrows, and keeps us from having to look at any
structure with more than eight nodes. Furthermore, not only is the 56-element group still
faithfully represented (though less directly), but representing it as shown in Figure 7.11
helps us better understand the overall 56-element structure by seeing how it can be built
by the direct product process. Thus direct products are one way of making some large
groups easier to understand, by showing us how the larger group is built from smaller
groups using a simple process.

The algebraic viewpoint
Both ways this book has taught us to approach group theory, from the actions-based view-
point and from the algebraic one, are helpful in understanding group theoretic concepts.
So let's try to understand direct product groups from the algebraic viewpoint as well,
seeing them as a set of elements with a binary operation on it. Because multiplication
tables show us groups in this way, knowing how to construct direct product multiplication
tables is a good place to start. Fortunately, just as there is a visual way to create Cayley
diagrams of direct product groups (Definition 7.1), there is also a visual way to create
multiplication tables of direct product groups.
Definition 7.3 (technique for constructing direct products of multiplication tables). To
create a multiplication table for the direct product group AB from multiplication tables
for the groups A and B, follow these three steps. Notice how analogous they are to the
steps in Definition 7.1. Figure 7.12 illustrates them using A D C4 and B D C2 as an
example.
1. Begin with a multiplication table for A.
In Figure 7.12, the table for C4 is shown with blue element names.
2. Inflate each cell in the table to include a copy of the entire multiplication table for B.
To avoid losing the information from the original table for A, retain its labels as well.
In the middle of Figure 7.12, the large, blue numbers were retained from the C4 table,
and now they sit over red copies of the table for C2.
3. Rename the elements in the table as pairs, using the A elements on the left of each
pair and the B elements on the right.
Each number in each pair in the C4  C2 table of this example kept its original color
so that you can tell which table it came from.
This construction process, illustrated in Figure 7.12, can tell us a lot about the binary
operation in the product group C4  C2. For starters, we can use its final table to do
multiplication in C4  C2. For example, to find .2; 1/  .3; 1/, we can look up the entry in

row .2; 1/ and column .3; 1/ of the table, finding the answer .1; 0/. But what we really
want to know is why the table gives the answer that it does. The way the table was
constructed answers that question.
The structure of the final table in Figure 7.12 was determined by the two overlaid tables
in the middle of that figure. The pattern of the blue numbers in the direct product table was
copied directly from the pattern of the large, blue numbers in the middle table, which in
turn come from the original table for C4. Thus the way the left (blue) elements in the pairs
in the final table relate is determined by the original table; that is to say, it's determined
only by their status in C4, and in no way depends on the red elements with which they
are paired. So the reason that the left component of the answer to .2; 1/ .3; 1/ is 1 is that
2 C 3 D 1 in C4. The right elements are irrelevant when computing the left half of the
answer. The left table in Figure 7.13 illustrates this by showing that any element whose left
entry is 2 times any element whose left entry is 3 results in an element whose left entry is 1.

Figure 7.13. The multiplication table for C4  C2 constructed in Figure 7.12, used to show the
independence of the factors in a direct product. The left table shows that any element .2;â¹/ times
any element .3; â¹/ results in some element .1; â¹/. The right table shows that any element .â¹;1/ times
any element .â¹;1/ results in some element .â¹;0/.
A similar fact holds for the red numbers in the final table of Figure 7.12. Their pattern
is made from many copies of a C2 table. The blue number under which a C2 copy lay in
the middle table in no way affected that table; it was the same everywhere. Thus the right
component of the answer to .2; 1/  .3; 1/ is 0 because 1 C 1 D 0 in C2; the 2 and 3 are
irrelevant. This is illustrated on the right of Figure 7.13, which shows that any element
whose right entry is 1 times any element whose right entry is 1 gives an element whose
right entry is 0. The pattern depends upon the fact that all the C2 copies are the same;
when we do the 1 C 1 computation in 16 identical copies of C2, we get the same answer
all 16 times.
So we find that to compute .2; 1/  .3; 1/ in C4  C2 we only need to know how to
compute 2 C 3 in C4 and 1 C 1 in C2. Each component in the pairs is treated completely
independently, as summarized in the following equation.
.2; 1/  .3; 1/ D .2 C 3; 1 C 1/ D .1; 0/
We have already seen the independence of the factors in a direct product show up in

128
7. Products and quotients
Cayley diagrams; the principle above describes how that same independence appears in
multiplication tables.
Now we are in a position to express that independence in algebraic terms. Take
elements a 2 A and b 2 B. If we use e to stand for the identity in each group, then the
corresponding elements in the direct product group are .a; e/ and .e; b/. The following
chain of equalities shows that .a; e/ and .e; b/ commute, based on the independence of
factors discussed above.
These equalities depend on the principle above.
The equation as a whole says that ( , ) and ( , ) commute.
a e
e b
Thus the independence of factors in a direct product means that elements from one factor
commute with elements from the other. Returning for a moment to considering Cayley
diagrams, this means that arrows from one factor commute with arrows from the other.
Figure 7.14 illustrates this idea using two different diagrams.
Figure 7.14. The left Cayley diagram illustrates the equation a  b D b  a in C3  C3, and the
right Cayley diagram illustrates the equation a3  b2 D b2  a3 in C4  C3. In each case, a is the
red generator and b is the blue generator.
We now have a well-rounded view of the direct product, having seen it from both the
actions-based and algebraic viewpoints. It is time to progress to another kind of product
operation, also useful for breaking large groups down into smaller conceptual pieces.
Although it is more intricate than the direct product, they have in common that if we
understand the ingredients in the construction and the construction process, then we gain
the ability to understand the resulting large group, even if it is too complex to diagram.
7.2
Semidirect products
The clean and simple direct product operation we just learned has two more complex
cousins. I introduce the semidirect product here, but do not cover the more complex knit
product in this book. Even the semidirect product depends on some concepts we will not
learn until Chapter 8, so this section gives an initial taste of semidirect products, but the
remainder must wait until the following chapter. As was the case with direct products,

7.2. Semidirect products
129
the reason for learning semidirect products is to have understandable ways to describe
the structure of large groups more simply.
We've learned that direct products are made up of identical copies of one factor, with
corresponding elements connected according to the pattern of the other factor. Semidirect
products are very similar, in that they have two factors, and one determines the pattern
for connecting corresponding elements in copies of the other. Where they differ is that
those copies need not all be laid out in an identical way. Some twisting is permitted
in the copies, and thus more intricacy is possible. To describe the kind of twists that
semidirect products allow, I introduce the following term. It is not standard group theory
terminology; in fact, we will replace it with a more technical term later. But for now, a
visual term is appropriate.
Definition
7.4 (rewiring). I call one Cayley diagram a rewiring of another if all the
following conditions are met.
(a) The two diagrams must have the same arrangement of nodes.
(b) The diagrams may have their arrows arranged differently.
(c) The algebraic relationships among group elements must be the same in both diagrams.
Condition (b) is not really a restriction, but appears on the list to highlight the major
feature of rewirings, which is the differing patterns of arrows between the two diagrams.
Another way to state condition (c) is that although the two Cayley diagrams are different,
they correspond to the same multiplication table and thus describe the same group.
Figure 7.15 shows C3 and a rewiring of it. Let's consider how it satisfies each of
the three criteria of Definition 7.4. Condition (a) requires that the nodes be arranged
the same in both diagrams, which is obvious from the figure. Condition (b) permits the
arrows to connect the nodes differently in the two diagrams, which they do; one diagram
cycles clockwise, the other counterclockwise. Verifying condition (c) means verifying that
every equation that one diagram satisfies, the other does as well. (This is what \algebraic
relationship" means here.) For example, the left diagram satisfies a  a D a2, because
following two red a arrows from e reaches a2. So we must verify that the right diagram
also satisfies this equation. It does satisfy it, but for a different reason than the left
diagram. In the right diagram, a is represented by two red arrows in succession, so a  a
is four red arrows, which leads from e to a2 only after going around the whole diagram
once. We could also verify that both diagrams satisfy a3 D e, and many other equations.
To be thorough, we could convert each Cayley diagram into a multiplication table, and
we would find the resulting multiplication tables to be the same. So the two diagrams
describe the same group. Thus Figure 7.15 satisfies all three conditions.

Two ways to rewire a Cayley diagram for V4, described as permutations of
horizontal (h), vertical (v), and diagonal (d). The permutations refer to diagonal (d) arrows even
though the original diagram has only horizontal and vertical arrows, because they can be rearranged
to diagonal positions.
Figure 7.16 shows a slightly larger example, two ways to rewire V4, each described
as a permutation of the diagrams' arrows. The top rewiring performed twice returns the
diagram to its original state, because it is simply an exchange of horizontal arrows with
vertical ones. The bottom rewiring, however, must be repeated three times to return to
the original diagram, and it is therefore described by a permutation with order 3.
It may also be helpful to contrast these first two examples with two examples of
what is not a rewiring, in Figure 7.17. Its top row shows a way to rearrange a Cayley
diagram's arrows that does not produce another Cayley diagram. It is therefore not a
rewiring because Definition 7.4 applies only to two Cayley diagrams. The bottom row
of the same figure shows a transformation that does not keep the algebraic relationships
among the group elements the same, even though it transforms one 4-cycle into another.
For instance, 2 C 2 D 1 in the right diagram, but to satisfy condition (c) of Definition
7.4 it ought to be 2 C 2 D 0, as in the left diagram.

7.2. Semidirect products
131
As you may have suspected from the fact that Figure7.16 uses permutations to describe
rewirings, we can put a collection of rewirings together to form a group. The simplest
example is in Figure 7.15; not only does it show a way to rewire C3, but if we view each
Cayley diagram in Figure 7.15 as one single node, then the overall picture has the structure
of the group C2, whose only arrow is the one in the center of the diagram, labeled \reverse
arrows." A more interesting example is the group of all rewirings of V4, generated by the
two rewirings from Figure 7.16. It has the structure of S3, and is shown in Figure 7.18.

meanings of the arrows are given by the legend in the upper right.
Diagrams like those in Figures 7.15 and 7.18 are reminiscent of the direct product
construction, because they treat Cayley diagrams as nodes to be connected. This is what
Step 2 of Definition 7.1 asks us to do, as shown in the middle diagrams in Figures 7.2
and 7.4. The important difference between the direct product construction and groups of
rewirings is that not all the Cayley diagrams in a rewiring group are identical. On the
contrary, each is different! If we connect the rewirings in Figure 7.15 or 7.18 as Step 3 of
Definition 7.1 taught us to do, the group that results is called a semidirect product group.
Figure 7.19 illustrates doing such a connection to the diagram from Figure 7.15. We call
the result a semidirect product of C3 with C2, because the individual groups in Figure
7.19 are rewirings of C3, while its overall structure is that of C2. A semidirect product
of C3 and C2 is written C3 Ã C2.
This semidirect product construction can be stated more generally as follows: From
a group G, draw a Cayley diagram of its rewiring group, and connect the rewirings as
we connected copies in a direct product (in Step 3 of Definition 7.1). You could use this
procedure to draw a Cayley diagram of the group V4 Ã S3 based on Figure 7.18. But
semidirect product groups created using this procedure are just some of the semidirect

product groups that exist. To be able to describe and build other semidirect product groups
requires using homomorphisms to describe rewirings and combinations thereof. We will
do so in Chapter 8, and will see how to construct various A Ã B for any two groups A
and B.
7.3
Normal subgroups and quotients
In Section 7.1.3 we saw that we could make some large groups more easily understandable
if we described them as direct product groups. Understanding the factors and the direct
product process gave us a simple way to picture an otherwise complex group. We need a
similar technique for deconstructing semidirect products as well. It is therefore natural to
wonder how to recognize a Cayley diagram of a product group when we see one. That is,
if you didn't construct the Cayley diagram yourself, how could you tell that it represented
A B or A Ã B, for some groups A and B? And how could you tell what A and B are?
The most general way to deconstruct a large group into two factors is called taking
a quotient; it reveals not only direct products but semidirect products as well. When a
quotient exposes a direct or semidirect product, it gives us clear insight into the group's
structure. (This will be even more true after we learn more about semidirect products
in Chapter 8.) Quotients can even be used to organize groups that were not built by a
direct or semidirect product operation, and the structure they reveal is often helpful for
understanding the large group in those cases as well. Group products multiply groups, and
group quotients divide them. We divide a group by one of its subgroups as follows. As
with the other processes introduced in this chapter, I include in the definition an example
that illustrates the process.
Definition
7.5 (quotient operation). To attempt to divide a group G by one of its
subgroups H, follow these steps.
1. Organize a Cayley diagram of G by H (as we first did in Section 6.3).
The top diagram in Figure 7.20 shows this for G D C6 and H D h2i. Notice that the
cosets of H have been grouped together in rows, in preparation for the following steps.

subgroup H D h2i, isomorphic to C3. Notice that organizing the Cayley diagram of G by the
subgroup H facilitates collapsing of the cosets of H.
2. Collapse each left coset of H into one large node.2 Unite those arrows that now have
the same start and end nodes. This forms a new diagram with fewer nodes and arrows.
The middle and bottom diagrams in Figure 7.20 show this process in two steps.
3. If the new diagram is a Cayley diagram of a group, then you have obtained the quotient
group of G by H , and the new diagram shows that group. If not, then G cannot be
divided by H.
The bottom diagram in Figure 7.20 is of the group C2, so C6 divided by C3 is C2.
We can already see one obvious way in which this quotient operation is like a re-
versal of both product operations we've seen. Both product processes created copies and
arrows among them, while the quotient process collapses both copies and arrows. Another
important detail to notice and understand in this example and in each example to come
is that the elements in a quotient group are the cosets of the original subgroup H. The
names of the nodes in the bottom diagram in Figure 7.20 make this clear.
But what was the original structure that this quotient operation deconstructed? Is C6 a
direct product, a semidirect product, or something else? We can tell that it is a direct prod-
uct because the Cayley diagram for C6 on the top of Figure 7.20 could have been created
by the direct product construction: It is two copies of C3 with corresponding elements
2 I will use the informal word \collapse" from here on to refer to this clustering or collecting of several
nodes together into one node. Probably the most natural English word for this type of uniting is \grouping,"
but obviously we're already using the word \group" to mean something else!

134
7. Products and quotients
connected after the pattern of C2. Step 1 of Definition 7.5 is essential because it reorga-
nizes the Cayley diagram to bring out a structure that another layout of the same diagram
may disguise. The group C6 is therefore the group C3C2, although we already knew this
from the last chapter (and Figure 6.5 in particular). If you're wondering which other cyclic
groups hide direct products inside them, we'll answer that question in Section 8.4!
Using the quotient process to deconstruct any direct product group reveals the two
factors as follows. The left factor A is the subgroup by which Step 1 organizes the
diagram, and the right factor B is the result of taking the quotient, the final diagram that
the process creates.
A subgroup isomorphic to C3 also appears in the group S3, a group with a lot in
common with C6. Let's try to divide S3 by C3, and compare it to the previous example.
Figure 7.21 shows the three steps of the quotient process applied to the group S3. Although
both quotients C6
C3 and S3
C3 give the result C2, the groups are not the same. The quotient
process has removed their differences.
I mentioned earlier that the quotient C6
C3 disassembled a direct product, so it is natural
to ask whether the quotient
S3
C3 also did. Notice that the blue arrows in S3 cross in
the top diagram of Figure 7.21; they do not connect elements of the C3 subgroup with
corresponding elements of its coset. Thus S3 is not the direct product of C3 with C2. If we
rearrange the nodes in the bottom row of S3 to uncross the blue arrows, the result is shown

process.

in Figure 7.22. Although this means that corresponding elements are now connected, the
bottom row is no longer an exact copy of the top row; it is a rewiring of it instead. Thus
while S3 is not a direct product, it is a semidirect product of C3 with C2. In fact, Figure
7.22 is just another layout of Figure 7.19.

We have therefore seen how quotient operations can reveal each of two different
product structures. When a quotient operation yields identical copies with correspond-
ing elements connected, it reveals a direct product structure. When it yields a group of
rewirings with corresponding elements connected, it reveals a semidirect product struc-
ture. We will also see quotients that reveal neither of these patterns, but that nonetheless
help us see structure in a large group (e.g., Exercise 7.18).
These first examples have been informative, but small. An instructive larger example
is the group A4, which we saw in Figure 5.27. That figure emphasizes the relationship
between A4 and the symmetries of the tetrahedron, but it doesn't tell us much about
the group's internal structure. Finding a way to take a quotient of A4 reveals a simpler
structure therein. Let's take a quotient of A4 by a subgroup isomorphic to V4.
Following Step 1 of Definition 7.5, the top of Figure 7.23 shows A4 organized by the
subgroup hx; zi. This reorganization required using arrows for the generators x and z, as
well as a generator that connects cosets of hx; zi, in this case a. Step 2 of Definition 7.5
asks us to collapse each of the three left cosets of hx; zi into a single node, uniting any
arrows that are thereby rendered redundant. Doing so reveals a three-step cyclic structure
in A4, as shown on the bottom of Figure 7.23. Therefore A4
V4 is isomorphic to C3.
Has this quotient reversed any kind of product? We can tell that it is not a direct prod-
uct because the Cayley diagram on top of Figure 7.23 shows that the arrows connecting
the cosets of H do not connect corresponding elements. For example, the top right node
of H is not connected to the top right node of aH. Just as in the S3 example above,
this is not an issue simply of layout. Although we could rearrange the diagram's nodes to
make the arrows connect corresponding elements of each coset, it would alter the layouts
of those cosets, as in Figure 7.24. This trade-off is an unavoidable consequence of the
tangled structure of A4; you can either arrange the arrows the same or the cosets, but not
both.
So A4 is not V4  C3, but it may still be a semidirect product. Having rearranged the
cosets of V4 in Figure 7.24 so that the arrows connect corresponding elements, we notice
that they form the outer ring of the semidirect product group V4 Ã S3 whose blueprint
appears in Figure 7.18. Figure 7.25 shows the pattern. The group A4 therefore forms
one of that large group's subgroups, and when we learn the full generality of semidirect

products in Chapter 8, we will learn how to express A4 as a semidirect product of C3
and V4. For now, the quotient process has revealed to us that A4 has the simple structure
shown in Figure 7.25.
As the wording of Step 3 of Definition 7.5 suggests, in some cases an attempted
quotient operation does not go smoothly, but instead results in an invalid Cayley diagram.
It is therefore important for us to see an example of just such an invalid result, and A4
can provide us with an example of this type as well. That example will help lead us to a
theorem about when the quotient operation will succeed and when it will fail.

Figure 7.25. The pattern in A4 as a subgroup of a rewiring group. To create A4, connect the
corresponding nodes in each rewiring with arrows in the three-cycle shown.
When we originally met A4 in Figure 5.27, it was organized by the three-element
subgroup hai. Figure 7.26 shows an attempt to divide A4 by this subgroup, but the result
is not a valid Cayley diagram. It is invalid for several reasons, but the most obvious one
is that the only arrow type in the diagram (the blue) is ambiguous. For instance, from
the top node, the blue arrows lead not to just one node, but to all three other nodes.
Therefore this diagram does not depict a group. (Recall the visual criteria from Exercises
2.14 through 2.17, also mentioned in Section 6.1.)
So quotients succeed for some subgroups and not for others. In order to say we truly
understand the quotient process, we need to know the reason for this. What is it about a
group or a subgroup that determines whether a quotient is possible? As the title of this
section suggests, the deciding factor is whether the subgroup is normal.
Theorem
7.6. If H < G, then a quotient group
G
H can be constructed just when
H C G.
Proof. The quotient process from Definition 7.5 succeeds just when the resulting diagram
is a valid Cayley diagram. Most aspects of valid Cayley diagrams are guaranteed by the
quotient process. For instance, because we begin with a diagram that has an arrow of every
color exiting every node, our resulting diagram has this property as well. Because we begin
with a regular diagram (as in Definition 6.1) and collapse identically structured sections
distributed uniformly throughout the diagram, we end up with a regular diagram as well.

Figure 7.26. An organization of A4 by a subgroup that is not normal, and therefore does not
allow us to take a quotient.
One problem can arise. Recall the requirement that the final diagram in Figure 7.26
violates: only one arrow of a given color must enter or leave any given node. Because
we collapse many nodes into one, dragging their various arrows along for the ride, the
resulting diagram may not satisfy this requirement. So this theorem boils down to the
following fact, for which I have yet to give evidence. Collapsing left cosets results in un-
ambiguous arrows just when the subgroup is normal. I show that this is true by comparing
the appearances of arrows that will become ambiguous after collapsing to the appearances
of those that will not.
Collapsing cosets produces ambiguous arrows when some arrows of a given color
go from nodes of one left coset to nodes of two or more different left cosets. The left
illustration in Figure 7.27 shows this, and it is what caused problems in Figure 7.26. On
the other hand, when all the like-colored arrows from any one coset go unanimously to
another coset, no ambiguity arises, as the right illustration in Figure 7.27 exemplifies.
This is what happened in the first three examples we saw of the quotient process, in
Figures 7.20, 7.21, and 7.23.
The reason that unanimity of arrows occurs among left cosets just when the subgroup
is normal lies in our original visualizations of left and right cosets from Chapter 6. Look

again at Figure 6.8 on page 104, which helped us picture a left coset gH as the copy
of H to which the g arrow from e leads. That figure also depicts the right coset Hg as
the nodes that g arrows can reach from H. These visualizations tell us that the defining
characteristic of normal subgroups, gH D Hg, can be restated as follows.
To whichever coset one g arrow leads from H (the left coset gH),
all g arrows lead unanimously (because it is also the right coset Hg).
This is illustrated in Figure 7.28, which unites the two illustrations in Figure 6.8. Thus
a subgroup is normal just when the arrows leaving the subgroup H are unanimous.
Furthermore, because Cayley diagrams are regular, the pattern of arrows connecting H
to each of its cosets will be repeated at every copy (left coset) of H throughout the
whole diagram. So a subgroup is normal just when every color of arrow between cosets
is unanimous, which is when the quotient operation succeeds.

This theorem shows us the very important role that normal subgroups play in group
theory. Originally we described them as those subgroups whose left and right cosets match,
which may not have seemed very significant at the time. But now we know its implica-
tions, that normal subgroups are those by which we can take a quotient, and thereby expose
an overall structure that can help us better understand a large group. I therefore spend the
final two sections of this chapter broadening our experience with normal subgroups and
quotients in preparation for the more advanced material in Chapters 9 and 10.

140
7. Products and quotients
7.4
Normalizers
Our return to studying normal subgroups begins with a simple question. Is there a way to
measure how close a subgroup is to being normal? The answer to this question reveals
several interesting patterns that can help our intuition about normal subgroups.
We have said that a subgroup H is normal when every element g in the group
satisfies the requirement gH D Hg. So a simple way to measure how close a subgroup
is to normal is to check how many of the g 2 G satisfy this requirement. As if G were
a democracy, we give to each g 2 G a vote for whether H should be normal, and see
how many vote in favor. Only those subgroups that earn a unanimous victory are given
the coveted title \normal."
At a minimum, we know that every g 2 H must vote in favor, because for any g 2 H,
both gH and Hg are simply H. (Candidates usually get the votes in their hometown.)
The other extreme is when H is normal, and all the g 2 G vote in favor. But there may be
levels in between these two extremes as well, and in those cases we can use the number
of elements that voted for H as a measure of how close it came to getting elected normal.
The set of elements in G that vote in favor of H's normality are called the normalizer
of H in G, usually written NG.H/.
In this democracy, cosets of H always vote together. If some g 2 G satisfies gH D
Hg, then every other element of gH does also. The reason comes from Observation6.5,
which told us that any k 2 gH could be used as the coset representative, so gH D kH
and Hg D Hk. Thus k votes for H (kH D Hk) just when g does (gH D Hg) because
gH and kH are synonyms, as are Hg and Hk. This voting pattern narrows down the
possibilities for what NG.H/ might be, especially regarding its size. Because NG.H/ is
made up of whole cosets, its size will always be a multiple of jHj.
Furthermore, the deciding factor in how a left coset will vote is simply whether it is
also a right coset, because gH votes for H just when gH D Hg. Thus the normalizer
NG.H/ is made up of all the left cosets that are also right cosets. This gives us a
straightforward way to pick out NG.H/ visually in a Cayley diagram. Because it is made
up of those left cosets that are also right cosets, we can describe it more visually by
saying that it is made up of those copies of H that are connected to H by unanimous
arrows. Let's look at a few examples.
I start with a normal subgroup for simplicity. We saw in Figure 7.23 that hx; zi C A4,
and therefore each of its three left cosets is also a right coset; they are all connected to
one another by unanimous arrows. Thus NV4.A4/ D A4 because the subgroup is normal.
The other extreme appears in Figure 7.26, showing hai, a non-normal subgroup of A4.
It has four left cosets (counting itself) but the arrows are spread so broadly that no left
coset is also a right coset. Thus no element outside the subgroup hai votes for it, making
hai as non-normal a subgroup as we'll ever find; NA4 .hai/ D hai.
Of course a more interesting example would be neither of these extremes, a subgroup
that measures as being somewhat normal, but not all normal. Figure 7.29 shows D6
organized by left cosets of hf i. Consider the left coset rhf i, labeled in the figure. There
is no unanimous collection of arrows connecting hf i to rhf i. The arrow from e to r
makes rhf i a left coset, but the other r arrow leaving H disagrees, heading to r5hf i
instead. Verify for yourself that the same is true for each of the cosets r2hf i, r4hf i, and

7.4. Normalizers
141
r5hf i; none have a connection to hf i by a unanimous set of arrows. But the case of
r3hf i is different; the r 3 paths do indeed head from hf i to r3hf i unanimously, although
in this Cayley diagram one goes clockwise and the other counterclockwise. Similarly, r3
paths returning from r 3hf i to hf i are also in agreement. Thus the normalizer ND6.hf i/
does not contain only hf i, but one of its cosets is as well, r3hf i. Though hf i does not
get elected to be a normal subgroup, it does get some votes outside its hometown.

Figure 7.29. The subgroup hf i in D6 is not normal, but neither is it its own normalizer. The
normalizer ND6.hf i/ is hf;r3i, a group isomorphic to V4, as shown on the right.
The right side of Figure 7.29 shows ND6.hf i/ lifted out of D6. As you can tell, it is
not just a set of nodes, but is in fact a group in its own right, and hf i is normal in it. These
two facts are not coincidences. We may not have expected that the normalizer would be
a group, but knowing that it is should make it obvious that the original subgroup must be
normal inside its own normalizer. After all, the normalizer consists of just those elements
that voted in favor of the subgroup being normal! So let us see why every normalizer is
a group.
Theorem 7.7. For any H < G, NG.H/ < G as well.
Proof. In the past, I've used the notation ha; b; ci to indicate a subgroup generated by
the elements a, b, and c. Generating the subgroup means combining a, b, c, and their
inverses in all possible ways. We know this will be a subgroup because this kind of
exploration from generators is how we built groups in the first place, in Chapter 2.
Say the elements of NG.H/ are g1; g2; : : : ; gn, and consider the subgroup they gen-
erate, hg1; g2; : : : ; gni. I prove that generating this subgroup does not actually reach any
new elements, but rather hg1; g2; : : : ; gni is just NG.H/. This proves that NG.H/ is a
subgroup of G; it is the subgroup generated by its own elements. I do this by first proving
that multiplying two elements of NG.H/ never reaches outside of NG.H/, then proving
that every inverse of an NG.H/ element is also an NG.H/ element.

142
7. Products and quotients
Consider two elements g1 and g2 in NG.H/. Each corresponds to some path in a Cay-
ley diagram for G, and those paths must connect cosets of H unanimously because they
are in NG.H/. Figure 7.30 illustrates the straightforward conclusion that the combined
path g1g2 must also connect cosets of H unanimously. Thus g1g2 is also in NG.H/,
and we see that combining elements in NG.H/ stays within NG.H/.

connect the cosets of H unanimously, shows that the product g1g2 must also connect the cosets
of H unanimously.
Inverses of elements in NG.H/ are also in NG.H/, as follows. Take any g in NG.H/
and consider a particular unanimous set of g arrows from some left coset aH to another
left coset bH. There are no other g arrows entering bH besides those from aH, because
there is no place for them to go; there is already one from each aH element (matching
the number of bH elements) and no two arrows can have the same destination. Thus g
arrows into bH come only from aH, making g 1 arrows from bH lead unanimously to
aH. This shows that the inverse of any g in NG.H/ is also in NG.H/.
So NG.H/ is a subgroup because it is the subgroup generated by its own elements.
This theorem shows that NG.H/ is always a group, and I mentioned earlier that it is
a group in which H is normal. It is called the normalizer because it answers the question
of how much must be removed from G to make H normal, a variation of the question
that opened this section.
A few important aspects of the relationship H C NG.H/ < G are highlighted in
Figure 7.31. First, the size of NG.H/ is some multiple of jHj, and the size of G is some
multiple of jNG.H/j, so that the three are only different when H is fairly small compared
to G (at most one fourth its size). Second, the boundary of NG.H/ falls on the boundaries
of left cosets of H, cutting through none of them; it includes cosets whole or not at all,
as we saw earlier. Third, it contains exactly those left cosets of H that are also right
cosets. Although all of G is full of copies of H (its left cosets), the NG.H/ boundary is
as large as it can be while still keeping all of the relationships H C NG.H/ < G true.
Normalizers will be a powerful tool in the advanced study of subgroups in Chapter 9.
7.5
Conjugacy
So far we've been using the most common definition of normal subgroup, that H < G
is normal if gH D Hg for every g 2 G. Another common (and equivalent) way to write
the equation gH D Hg is as gHg 1 D H. This alternate form was obtained from the
original by multiplying both sides by g 1 on the right, then canceling, as follows.

Original equation:
gH D Hg
Multiply both sides by g 1:
gHg 1 D Hgg 1
Cancel gg 1 from the right:
gHg 1 D H
This equation expresses the same information as the first, and thus it is an acceptable
alternative way to describe what it means for H to be normal.
Just as each side of the equation gH D Hg is a set of group elements, so is each side
of the equation gHg 1 D H. This new equation says that if you take all the elements
h 2 H and multiply each on the left by g and on the right by g 1, yielding ghg 1, then
the new collection of elements you obtain, written gHg 1, is really just the subgroup H.
Visually, that same equation says that all the g 1 arrows lead back from the left coset
gH to the subgroup H.
The motivation for rewriting gH D Hg as gHg 1 D H is to bring out the connection
between normal subgroups and an operation called conjugation. Taking h and surrounding
it with g and its inverse (yielding ghg 1) is called conjugating h by g, and the result is

144
7. Products and quotients
called the conjugate of h by g, or just a conjugate. Similarly, gHg 1 is also called the
conjugate of H by g. Because normal subgroups can be defined using conjugation, the
two concepts are tightly related. This section explores some of the consequences of their
relationship.
The expression ghg 1 probably seems rather arbitrary, so I begin by explaining why
conjugating one group element h by another element g often has a natural and useful
meaning. Viewed as a sequence of actions, a conjugate ghg 1 is the action g, followed
by the action h, followed by a reversal of the action g. Many everyday events fit this
pattern. Let h stand for the simple action of opening a jar. When the lid is tight so that
you're having trouble with h, you may heat the lid under hot running water (g), open the
jar (h), and let the lid cool again (g 1). The action h is temporarily moved into a different
context by the action g, and the result is therefore different than if h had been done alone.
As another example, say that action h is a band playing their songs, and action g
is the band driving to the auditorium where they will perform. This band does action h
frequently when rehearsing, but on a concert night things are different. They conjugate
their usual action h by g, thereby moving it into a new setting (and in this case a more
exciting and lucrative one). They drive to the auditorium (g), perform their songs (h),
and then drive back (g 1). A good way to think of any conjugate action ghg 1 is that it
is the action h moved into a new context by the action g. For this reason, an action and
its conjugates often have a lot in common.
These first two examples of conjugacy are easy to understand, but are not examples
from group theory. There are countless group theoretic examples to choose from; let's
look at one from the group A4, the symmetries of the tetrahedron. As before, I use the
names a, b, c, and d in A4 to represent the four 120-degree clockwise rotations about
each of the four different vertices of the tetrahedron. In Figure 7.32 I've labeled the four
vertices A, B, C, and D, corresponding to those four actions. Each of these four rotations
is a conjugate of each of the others. This resonates with the non-group-theoretic examples
above, because each of these 120-degree clockwise rotations is essentially the same as
any other, except in a different context. Let's see exactly why they are conjugates.

Figure 7.32. A tetrahedron with vertices A, B, C, and D. From each vertex a line through the
opposite face is drawn, and the actions of rotating the entire object 120 degrees clockwise around
each such line are labeled a, b, c, and d, respectively. (Here \clockwise" is interpreted from the
point of view that looks toward the vertex from outside the tetrahedron.)

7.5. Conjugacy
145
I show how to conjugate a by another element of A4 to obtain b, but the work would
be very similar if I chose a different pair of rotations instead. (I ask you to try another in
Exercise 7.37.) The action a is a clockwise rotation about the vertex A. We need an action
that will reorient the tetrahedron so that the action a rotates instead about the vertex B.
This can be done by any action in A4 that repositions B to be the leftmost vertex (where
A is in Figure 7.32), in order to \fool" action a into rotating the tetrahedron about the
vertex B. Action c is just such an action.
Figure 7.33 shows what happens when we conjugate a by c. Each portion of the figure
represents a different one of the three actions in the conjugate, and shows the orientation
of the tetrahedron after that action is completed (assuming it began oriented as in Figure
7.32). The final result has the vertices A, C, and D rotated one step clockwise, as if all
we had done was the one action b. Thus conjugating a by c does indeed result in b. We
can express this algebraically by the equation cac 1 D b. Similar work could show that
any two of the 120-degree clockwise rotations are conjugates.

Conjugating a by c results in b, written cac 1 D b. This figure assumes the
tetrahedron began in the configuration shown in Figure 7.32. Thus you can verify the equation
cac 1 D b by picturing the effect of b on the tetrahedron in Figure7.32; your result should be the
result of the conjugation shown here.
Because conjugate elements often share many qualities, it can be informative to par-
tition a group into sets of conjugates. There are three key facts that enable us to use a
relationship like conjugacy to partition a group. You will be asked to prove each of these
facts in Exercise 7.36, and therefore I will not prove them here. One of these facts is that
whenever an element a is a conjugate of an element b, then b is also a conjugate of a. For
this reason, the simpler (and appropriately ambiguous) phrase \a and b are conjugates"
is common.
Table 7.1 partitions the elements of A4 so that the elements in each row are all
conjugate to one another, but not to any elements in any other row. Notice how each row
has a simple, meaningful description that states the similarities the conjugates share. The
four rows in Table 7.1 are called conjugacy classes.
A common way to summarize the information in a table of conjugacy classes is in an
equation saying that the sizes of the conjugacy classes add up to the size of the group.
For example, from Table 7.1, with conjugacy classes of sizes 1, 3, 4, and 4, we would

write
1 C 3 C 4 C 4 D 12:
This is called the class equation for A4; each number on its left side represents a con-
jugacy class and the number on its right side is the group order. Class equations carry
a surprising amount of information for how small and simple they are. The important
use of class equations to which I now draw your attention brings us back to where our
acquaintance with conjugacy started, its connection to normal subgroups.
I began the topic of conjugacy by pointing out that the defining characteristic of
normal subgroups could be expressed as gHg 1 D H. Consequently, any element h in
a normal subgroup H must have all its conjugates in H as well, because any conjugate
ghg 1 is in gHg 1, which for normal subgroups is H. Another way of saying this is
that for every element in a normal subgroup, its whole conjugacy class is also in the
subgroup. Therefore every normal subgroup is made up of whole conjugacy classes.
A class equation therefore enables us to dramatically narrow down a search for normal
subgroups, as follows. From only the class equation for A4, we can tell that the group has
four conjugacy classes, with sizes 1, 3, 4, and 4. Any normal subgroup of A4 will be one
or more of these classes united together. That is, based on the previous paragraph, we can't
put just half of a conjugacy class in a normal subgroup; we must put the whole thing. So
to find all the normal subgroups of A4, we experiment with different combinations of the
numbers 1, 3, 4, and 4, trying to build subgroups out of conjugacy classes. While doing
so, we have two restrictions. First, because we're trying to build subgroups, we must
always include the conjugacy class containing the identity. Second, Lagrange's Theorem
tells us that the size of the resulting subgroup must divide the size of the whole group, in
this case 12. Once we've taken these two principles into account, only three possibilities
emerge.
The whole group A4,
1 C 3 C 4 C 4
The identity and the flips,
1 C 3
The trivial subgroup,
1
No other combinations of 1 with 3, 4, and 4 add up to a factor of 12. The whole group
and the trivial subgroup are normal subgroups of any group, and thus it is not a surprise
to find them on this list. The interesting one is the middle one, standing for the first two
rows of Table 7.1, fe; x; y; zg.

7.6. Exercises
147
From this work alone, we cannot conclude that fe; x; y; zg is a normal subgroup. We
would need to look at a Cayley diagram or multiplication table to tell if fe; x; y; zg is
a subgroup of A4, and not simply a subset. Of course, we have already done so in this
chapter, even verifying that fe; x; y; zg is normal by dividing A4 by it in Figure 7.23. But
in general, combining conjugacy classes does not always create subgroups. What it does
is give us a much shortened list of things to check when seeking normal subgroups.
So class equations provide a shortcut when searching for normal subgroups. Rather
than checking many subgroups for normality by attempting the quotient process in each
case, we only have to check a few. (In this example, we only had to check one.) Although
this connection of conjugacy with normal subgroups is useful, it is not the only value we
will derive from the concept of conjugacy. Some of the exercises in Section7.6.5 reveal
new uses for conjugacy, and each of the remaining chapters in this book depends upon it
as well.

The power of homomorphisms
Throughout this book I've said things like \this group has the same structure as that group"
or \there is a copy of this group inside that group." The first time I did so (page 19, regard-
ing the equivalence of Figures 2.7 and 2.8), I carefully explained how the two structures
were the same. But since then, when stating that two structures are the same, I've depended
on your ability to see how their patterns match, without my spelling out all the details. The
purpose of this chapter is to create and study precise descriptions of how two structures
correspond, because doing so will significantly advance our study of group theory.
To describe groups with the same structure, in Chapter 3 I introduced the technical
term \isomorphic" without giving a formal definition. The related term \homomorphism"
refers to a correspondence between two groups. The Greek roots \homo" and \morph"
together mean \same shape." Isomorphisms are a specific kind of homomorphism, and
this chapter explores both. Section 8.1 introduces homomorphisms through their relation-
ship with two major topics we've already studied. The rest of the chapter tours four
important ideas in group theory that homomorphisms help us better describe, understand,
and visualize.
8.1
Embeddings and quotient maps
Homomorphisms are hiding in two important contexts we've already studied. It's time to
bring them out of hiding and learn what they can teach us. First, we will find homomor-
phisms whenever one group is a subgroup of another. Second, we will find homomor-
phisms whenever we perform a quotient.
I begin with the case of subgroups. Consider the mathematical statement C3 < S3,
which we first illustrated on the left of Figure 6.3 on page 100. The highlighting in that
figure shows that S3 contains a three-step cyclic subgroup, which is identical to C3 in
structure only. That is, none of the elements of C3 (0, 1, or 2) are actually in S3 at all.
When we say that C3 is a subgroup of S3, we really mean that the structure of C3 shows
up, even if the elements are not 0, 1, and 2.
In Chapter 6, I expected you to visually recognize the structural correspondence in
Figure 6.3 on your own; it is a rather obvious one. But this chapter studies such corre-

pattern in S3 is the pattern of C3, and to make it possible to describe the element-by-element
correspondence
spondences, so let's begin by describing this one precisely. Figure 8.1 shows the Cayley
diagrams of C3 and S3 side-by-side to facilitate the following explanation of the structural
correspondence of C3 to the orbit hri in S3.
The top element 0 2 C3 corresponds to the top element e 2 S3. If we proceed
clockwise, following red arrows in each Cayley diagram, the correspondence continues.
The first step along the red arrow path in C3, to the element 1, corresponds to the first
step along the red arrow path in S3, to the element r. The path continues, making 2 2 C3
correspond to r2 2 S3, and then returning to both starting points simultaneously. The
three-step walk through C3 corresponds to the three-step walk through the r-orbit in S3.
This explanation leaves no doubt about exactly what it means to say that C3 is a
subgroup of S3, but it is far too wordy! It shouldn't take a whole paragraph to precisely
describe such a simple correspondence. Homomorphisms are the mathematical tool for
succinctly expressing precise structural correspondences. The homomorphism represent-
ing the explanation above is illustrated in Figure 8.2. It is depicted by dashed arrows
connecting each C3 element to its corresponding S3 element, and it is also described
in the legend on the right of the figure. The legend writes 0 7! e to say that 0 2 C3
corresponds to e 2 S3, and so on.
Because homomorphisms describe how elements of one group correspond to elements
of another, they are a kind of function. In mathematics, we often graph and study functions,
which connect each value of an independent variable x to one and only one value of a
dependent variable y. The x and y values are usually numbers, but not always; in group
theory, our functions will often not be about numbers. Figure 8.2 specifies a function

8.1. Embeddings and quotient maps
159
from the group C3 (a group of numbers) to the group S3 (not containing numbers). We
say that this function maps elements of C3 to elements of S3.
Traditionally, Greek letters stand for maps between groups, so I'll use  for the map in
Figure 8.2. I can use the mathematical notation  W C3 ! S3 to say that  maps C3 to S3.
Just as standard function notation writes f .2/ to mean the number to which f maps 2, in
group theory we can write .2/. In the case of the homomorphism in Figure8.2, .2/ D
r2. And just as it is standard to define a function using notation like f .x/ D x 2 C 1,
I can define  succinctly with the expression .n/ D rn. This definition works for any
n 2 C3 (if we think of r 0 as e) and it highlights the connection of C3 to the orbit of r.
The group from which a function originates is called its domain (in this case C3),
and the group into which the function maps is called its codomain (in this case S3).
The particular elements of the codomain that the function touches (in this case the orbit
hri) are called the image of the function. The notation Im./ means the image of the
homomorphism .
The original description I gave of  a few paragraphs ago makes it clear that 
carefully mimics the structure of its domain C3 in its codomain S3. Group theory concerns
itself most with functions that have this property, as described in the following definition.
Definition 8.1 (homomorphism). A homomorphism is a function between two groups that
mimics the structure of its domain in its codomain. The following condition expresses this
requirement; I state it in two equivalent ways, both of which are illustrated in Figure 8.3.
(1) In terms of Cayley diagrams: If an arrow b in the domain leads from the element a
to the element c, then the .b/ arrow in the codomain must lead from the element
.a/ to the element .c/.
(2) In terms of multiplication tables: If the domain multiplication table says that ab D c,
then the codomain multiplication table must say that .a/  .b/ D .c/.
These statements must hold true for any a, b, and c in the domain. Take a moment
to consider why each of these statements expresses the idea of mimicking the domain
structure in the codomain.

Figure 8.4. A diagram that spells out the correspondence between C3 and the h2i orbit in C6
by showing which element from C6 corresponds to each element in C3.
Another example can help us better appreciate this definition. Recall that C3 is also
a subgroup of C6, as shown on the right of Figures 6.4 and 6.5 on page 100. We can
express C3 < C6 using the homomorphism .n/ D 2n from C3 to C6, as in Figure 8.4.
The next few paragraphs use  as an example to point out some important facts about
homomorphisms in general.
Just as  maps the node 1 to the node 2, it maps the 1-arrow in C3 to the two-step path
representing 2 in C6. The 1 arrow traces the orbit f0; 1; 2g in C3, and the .1/ path traces
the corresponding orbit f.0/; .1/; .2/g in C6, which is f0; 2; 4g. Thus homomorphisms
not only map nodes of the domain's Cayley diagram to nodes of the codomain's, but also
implicitly map paths in the domain's Cayley diagram to paths in the codomain's. Part
(2) of Definition 8.1 requires that the path from a to b in the domain correspond to the
path from .a/ to .b/ in the codomain. The Cayley diagram of C6 in Figure 8.4 does
not include arrows for .1/, but they could be added. Or we can simply think of the .1/
arrow as the path consisting of two red arrows in succession. So  doubles both numbers
and arrows. By viewing each pair of successive arrows in C6 as one step that skips the
odd-numbered nodes, we find the structure of C3 in C6.
Thus when using Cayley diagrams to visualize homomorphisms, we can think of the
homomorphism on two levels, mapping nodes in the domain to nodes in the codomain
and also mapping paths in the domain to paths in the codomain. Furthermore, if we know
where a homomorphism maps the domain's arrows, this tells us enough to deduce where
the homomorphism maps every element of the domain. The reason is that the arrows of
a Cayley diagram represent the group's generators. Just as those elements generate the
group, where they are mapped generates the homomorphism. For example, suppose there
were another homomorphism 0 W C3 ! C6 different from the  in Figure 8.4. Given
only that 0.1/ D 4, it is possible to determine the rest of the homomorphism.
You could proceed using part (2) of Definition 8.1. For instance, it tells us that because
1C1 D 2 in C3, we must require 0.1/C0.1/ D 0.2/ in C6. Therefore we can determine
0.2/ as follows.
0.2/ D 0.1/ C 0.1/ D 4 C 4 D 2
Similarly, from 1 C 2 D 0 in C3 we can determine that 0.0/ must be 0. So all of 0 is
generated by the fact that 0.1/ D 4. Try drawing this homomorphism and comparing it
to the homomorphism  shown in Figure 8.4.
Similar steps can be used to generate any homomorphism. Say  W G ! H and assume
that G D ha; bi and we are given the values of .a/ and .b/. We can determine the value

8.1. Embeddings and quotient maps
161
of .g/ for any element g 2 G as follows. The element g can be written as some multi-
plied sequence of a's and b's, say g D a  b  a  a  b. Applying part (2) of Definition 8.1
several times yields
.g/ D .a/  .b/  .a/  .a/  .b/:
We can compute what .g/ must be by multiplying .a/  .b/  .a/  .a/  .b/ in
the group H. In this way, any homomorphism is generated by what it does to a group's
generators.
That G has two generators is irrelevant; similar reasoning works for three or more.
Exercise 8.7 asks you to explain why this implies that any homomorphism must map the
domain's identity to the codomain's identity. I will use this fact without having given
evidence for it myself.
To understand Definition 8.1 better, it is helpful to contrast the example homomor-
phisms we've seen with examples of correspondences that are not homomorphisms. Figure
8.5 shows four examples of non-homomorphisms, with reasons for why each fails to sat-
isfy Definition 8.1. Two are not homomorphisms because they are not even functions, and
the other two are functions but do not mimic the structure of the domain or the codomain.
Take a moment to understand each example in Figure 8.5.

Although I find it most helpful to visualize homomorphisms using Cayley diagrams,
we could use multiplication tables or cycle graphs instead. For example, Figure8.6 shows

8.1. Embeddings and quotient maps
163
8.1.1
Embeddings
I began Section 8.1 by saying that homomorphisms show up in two group theory situations
we've seen before. The first is that homomorphisms help us get specific about how one
group is a subgroup of another group, as in the examples we just saw. We call such
homomorphisms embeddings because they show us how one group can be embedded in
another.
Because any embedding finds a copy of the domain in the codomain, its image is
therefore the same size as its domain. For this reason, embeddings have the interesting
property that they never map two different domain elements to the same codomain element.
If one did, its image would be smaller than its domain, and not a copy of it. This property
is easy to verify in a figure, because it is easy to spot two homomorphism arrows that
have the same destination.
An embedding whose image fills the whole codomain shows us that the domain and
codomain actually have all the same structure. In such a case, we say that the function
is not just a homomorphism, but an isomorphism. Figure 8.8 shows a simple example.
Two groups are isomorphic if there is an isomorphism between them. This is the formal
definition of the term I've been using informally since Chapter 3. Two isomorphic groups
may name their elements differently and may look different based on the layouts of Cayley
diagrams or multiplication tables, but the isomorphism between them guarantees that they
have the same structure. When two groups G and H are isomorphic, we write G Å  H,
read \G is isomorphic to H."

Figure 8.8. The domain of this isomorphism is C4, and the codomain is a group of complex
numbers f1;  1;i; ig under the operation of multiplication. The isomorphism points out that
despite their different elements and operations, these groups have the same structure.
8.1.2
Quotient maps
Figure 8.9 shows two examples of homomorphisms that are not embeddings. They satisfy
all the requirements from Definition 8.1 for being a homomorphism, but they map more
than one domain element to the same codomain element. In doing so, their image becomes
a smaller, simplified version of their domain. The diagrams in Figure 8.9 are intricate;
take a moment to study them. Verify that they satisfy Definition 8.1, and try to notice
patterns they have in common.
There are several useful patterns to notice that are not unique to these two examples,
but hold for all non-embeddings. I make three observations below about non-embedding

homomorphisms and give reasons to support each. As you read Observations8.2 through
8.4, verify that they are true about the two homomorphisms in Figure 8.9. This can help
you gain some concrete intuition for both the observations and the reasoning behind them.
Observation 8.2. Every collection of domain elements that maps to the same codomain
element has the same structure in the domain.
In other words, every non-embedding homomorphism follows a repeating pattern. For
instance, in the homomorphism 1 in Figure 8.9, each element of the codomain is mapped
to by a little copy of C2 in the domain, two elements connected by a  1 arrow. In the
homomorphism 2, each element in the image (0 and 3) is mapped to by five elements
of the domain connected in a chain by pairs of red arrows. Let's prove that Observation
8.2 is true about any non-embedding.

8.1. Embeddings and quotient maps
165
Proof. Take two elements a and b in the image of a homomorphism . Let A stand for
the set of domain elements that  maps to a, and B the elements it maps to b. I will
explain why A and B must have the same structure. It may help to visualize the following
argument with a concrete example. For , think of 2 from Figure 8.9 and let a D 0 and
b D 3 in its codomain, so that A D f0; 2; 4; 6; 8g and B D f1; 3; 5; 7; 9g in its domain.
The structure of A and B is comprised of the paths within them. Choose two starting
points, a1 in A and b1 in B, as illustrated in Figure 8.10. I explain why every path from
a1 to another element in A also leads from b1 to some other element in B.
Let p be a path from a1 to some point a2 in A. Part (1) of Definition 8.1 tells us that
.p/ leads from .a1/ to .a2/. But .a1/ D .a2/ D a, so .p/ is a path leading from
a to a. It is a path with zero steps (or you can think of it as a path that goes somewhere
but then returns to end at its starting node). So where does the path p lead if we start
from b1? I'll call the point to which it leads b2, and the important question is whether
b2 is in B. Well, .p/ leads from .b1/ to .b2/, making them equal since .p/ is an
empty path. Thus .b2/ D .b1/ D b, which means that b2 is in B, because B is the
set of elements that  maps to b.
This shows that my path from a1 that stays within A has a corresponding path from
b1 that stays within B. Similar reasoning could show that any path from b1 that stays
within B has a corresponding path from a1 that stays within A. Thus A and B have
all structure in common. Because they stood for any two sets in the domain that map to
single elements of the codomain (a and b), this shows that all such sets have the same
structure. Observation 8.2 is true for any non-embedding.
As Figure 8.10 suggests, this creates a partition of the domain into identical copies of
a structure. This is reminiscent of when we partitioned a group by cosets of a subgroup
in Chapter 6. In fact, that is exactly what is happening here as well.
Observation 8.3. The collections of domain elements mentioned in Observation 8.2 are
actually a subgroup and its left cosets.

8. The power of homomorphisms
From Chapter 6, we know that the left cosets of any subgroup are structural copies,
and they partition the group. Thus if any one of the identical structures mentioned in
Observation 8.2 is a subgroup, the others must be its left cosets. If one such structure
were to be a subgroup, it would need to be the one containing the identity element, and
therefore it would need to be the one that maps to the codomain identity. I give evidence
for Observation 8.3 by explaining why the structure that maps to the codomain identity
is indeed a subgroup of the domain.
I use the same type of argument that I did for Theorem 7.7. Let C stand for the col-
lection of elements that map to the codomain identity. I show that the subgroup generated
by C is just C. Obviously C generates at least its own elements, but I must show that it
generates no more. For any two elements a and b in C, must their product ab remain in C?
The element ab is where the b arrow reaches from a, and thus the element .ab/ is
where the .b/ arrow reaches from .a/. But since b is in C,  maps b to the identity
and thus .b/ is an empty path. So .a/ D .ab/, and because  maps a to the identity,
it must map ab there as well. Thus ab is in C.
So the collection of elements that map to the codomain identity is a subgroup of the
domain, and each of its left cosets maps to a different, single element of the codomain.
The subgroup C is called the kernel of the homomorphism , and we write it Ker./.
Observation 8.4. The left cosets mentioned in Observation 8.3 are also right cosets, and
thus the subgroup is normal.
In Chapter 7 we saw that normal subgroups are those with no ambiguous arrows
among their cosets, as illustrated in Figure 7.27. If the arrows for any element g in the
domain were ambiguous, connecting Ker./ to both gKer./ and kKer./ as in Figure
8.11, then part (1) of Definition 8.1 requires that .g/ in the codomain connect e to both
.g/ and .k/. Since we know that the codomain is a group, this cannot happen. The
kernel must therefore be a normal subgroup.
Putting together Observations 8.2 through 8.4 we can see that the homomorphisms in
Figure 8.9 are functioning much like the quotient process from Definition 7.5. The quotient
process collapsed cosets of a normal subgroup into single nodes representing the coset;
the way that a homomorphism maps each coset of its kernel to a single node is another
way of doing the same collapsing. For example, the homomorphism 1 in Figure 8.9

begins with a famous theorem stating the connection formally. Because of this relation-
ship, I call non-embedding homomorphisms quotient maps. This is one of the key facts
about homomorphisms: they come in only two types, embeddings and quotient maps. Em-
beddings never collapse two domain elements into one codomain element, and quotient
maps do so in the same way that a quotient process does. You have spent this section
learning about embeddings first and quotient maps second, and there is no other kind of
homomorphism.
8.2
The Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem
The following theorem has an important-sounding name for good reason; it sums up a
lot of what we've already observed about homomorphisms, and more. I begin by simply
stating it, then discuss its implications and its proof.
Theorem 8.5 (Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem). If  W G ! H is a homomor-
phism, then Im./ Å 
G
Ker./.
As we move toward understanding why this theorem is true, let's first see some of
its simplest implications. First, consider what the theorem says about embeddings. Any
embedding  must map only one element to the codomain identity, and so its kernel is
just the trivial subgroup feg. Theorem 8.5 therefore says that Im./ is isomorphic to G
feg,
which is isomorphic to G. Thus the theorem says that embeddings deserve their name,
because their image is a copy of their domain.
When  is not an embedding, somewhere it must collapse two domain elements to
one codomain element. In fact, because quotient maps follow a repeating pattern, every
coset of Ker./ will have at least two elements in it. Thus the quotient
G
Ker./ collapses
cosets with several elements into single elements, resulting in a smaller group (unlike
the quotient
G
feg). So Theorem 8.5 tells us that quotient maps, too, deserve their name,
because they perform a nontrivial quotient process. In fact, after we prove the theorem,
we will use it to see exactly how quotient processes and quotient maps relate.

168
8. The power of homomorphisms
Proof. For any homomorphism  W G ! H, we know from Observations 8.2 to 8.4 that
Ker./ C G, so we know that we can take a quotient
G
Ker./ and obtain a group. Now
I must explain why that group is isomorphic to Im./, a subgroup of H. We learned
how to compute quotient groups like
G
Ker./ by collapsing cosets of Ker./ in G, and
Observations 8.2 to 8.4 already showed that homomorphisms collapse cosets of Ker./;
each maps to a single node in Im./.
The question is whether  also collapses arrows in the same way that the quotient
by Ker./ does. Let's recall what the quotient process does to arrows between cosets.
If b arrows lead from the coset aKer./ to the coset cKer./ in G, then when the
quotient collapses cosets to nodes, the b arrows also collapse to one b arrow connecting
the aKer./ node to the cKer./ node in the quotient group. That is, the quotient process
requires the arrows to connect nodes in the same way after the quotient as before, but
duplicate arrows become one. This is perfectly analogous to what homomorphisms do.
Part (1) of Definition 8.1 requires that whenever an arrow b connects a to c in G, we must
have .b/ mapping .a/ to .c/ in H. Furthermore, because H is a group, there will
be no duplicate arrows between nodes. Any homomorphism  collapses both cosets and
arrows just as does a quotient by Ker./, and the results therefore have the same structure.
If
G
Ker./ and Im./ are the same structures, then there must be a suitable renaming, an
isomorphism converting cosets of Ker./ to elements of Im./. Figure8.13 diagrams this
relationship and calls the isomorphism i W
G
Ker./ ! Im./. A specific example following
the pattern of Figure 8.13 is shown in Figure 8.14. The homomorphism  W A4 ! C3 is
the same as the quotient process q that divides A4 by Ker./, followed by a renaming of
cosets to numbers using the isomorphism i.
But what is the formula for i? As suggested by Figure 8.14, i must map a coset in
G
Ker./ to where  maps all that coset's elements. After all, we want q followed by i
to agree with . Thus the isomorphism i should map any coset gKer./ to the element
.g/ in H. There is no ambiguity here, because regardless of which element is chosen
to represent the coset,  maps them all to the same destination. This isomorphism i is
what makes
G
Ker./ isomorphic to Im./.

We can interpret Theorem 8.5 as saying that any homomorphism can be imitated by
combining a quotient process with a suitable renaming isomorphism. What you may also
suspect from these figures is that the quotient process is itself a homomorphism. It is a
function from a group to a quotient group, and it respects the group operation. For this
reason the quotient processes in Figures 8.13 and 8.14 are named q and diagrammed
like the other homomorphisms in those figures. In fact, the term \quotient map" becomes
rather ambiguous. I've been using it to mean a non-embedding homomorphism, which acts
like a quotient process, as 1 in Figure 8.9 acts like the quotient process in Figure 8.12.
But the quotient process is itself a homomorphism, and thus is also called a quotient map.
We now have a strong foundation for using homomorphisms in our study of group
theory. The rest of this chapter explores a variety of uses for both homomorphisms and
Theorem 8.5. There are many uses, but I choose four of the most significant and famous
ones on which to spend our time, one topic each in Sections 8.3 through 8.6.
8.3
Modular arithmetic
In Section 5.1.2 we learned that the binary operation for the groups Cn is addition mod
n. I introduced this concept by comparing C12 to a clock. A clock and a Cayley diagram
for C12 are numbered almost exactly the same, but where the clock has 12, the Cayley
diagram has 0 instead. This leads to a very useful way to think of the group C12. It is

170
8. The power of homomorphisms
the group obtained by taking the group Z of all integers and imposing the requirement
that 12 and 0 should be the same. Theorem 8.5 can help us do this.
Begin with a Cayley diagram for Z (using one arrow for the generator 1), as shown
in Figure 8.15. The recent discussion of Theorem 8.5 tells us that dividing Z by a normal
subgroup containing 12 corresponds to a homomorphism that maps 12 to 0. Both represent
the idea that 0 and 12 should become the same. Let's perform this quotient.

Figure 8.15. The infinite cyclic group Z of integers
To avoid removing too much, let's divide by the smallest normal subgroup of Z
containing 12. Well, the smallest subgroup containing 12 in Z is of course h12i, the
contents of which are exactly the multiples of 12.
h12i D f: : : ;  36;  24;  12; 0; 12; 24; 36; : : :g
Because Z is abelian, all subgroups (including this one) are normal. Thus I now compute
Z
h12i using the visual quotient process from Chapter 7.
First I must organize a Cayley diagram of Z by h12i and its cosets. To do so, we must
know what those cosets are. Because Z is a group whose binary operation is addition
(rather than multiplication, as in many of the groups we've seen), we will indicate cosets
of h12i using the notation k C h12i (rather than kh12i). A few cosets are shown in
Figure 8.16; notice that they are structural copies of h12i, as expected. The coset 1Ch12i
contains all the numbers that are one more than a multiple of 12, that is, those numbers
whose remainder is 1 when the number is divided by 12. The coset 2 C h12i contains
elements that give remainder 2 when divided by 12, and so on.
These cosets are called congruence classes mod 12, and we say two elements are
congruent mod 12 if they're in the same congruence class|they have the same remainder
when divided by 12. When a and b are congruent mod 12, we write a 12 b. Thus, for

Figure 8.17. A Cayley diagram of the group Z organized by cosets of h12i. The quotient group
structure becomes clear; we can see that the cosets form C12.
example, the following congruences are true.
6 12 18
1 12 25
12 12 1200 12 0
The group Z organized by these cosets forms an infinite spiral, as shown in Figure 8.17.
The coset grouping in this layout shows that
Z
h12i Å  C12.
But there's more to learn from this example. Figure 8.18 diagrams this quotient after
the pattern of Figures 8.13 and 8.14. The homomorphism  W Z ! C12, the combination
of the quotient and the isomorphism i W
Z
h12i ! C12, is a natural and meaningful function.
For any integer k, q.k/ is the coset containing all integers with the same remainder as
k when divided by 12. Then i maps this coset to the element it has in common with C12.
Because  is q followed by i, we know it maps all elements in the coset k C h12i to the
element k 2 C12. Of course, C12 contains just the possible remainders (0 through 11), so
for any integer k, .k/ is the remainder when k is divided by 12. The homomorphism 
is the natural arithmetic operation of finding a remainder.
This analysis of
Z
h12i could have been done for any
Z
hni, not just n D 12. Any Cn is
isomorphic to
Z
hni, and the corresponding homomorphism  computes remainders mod n.
Two numbers are congruent mod n (a n b) if and only if  maps them to the same
element of Cn.

Direct products and relatively prime numbers
Some cyclic groups can be disguised as direct products and some cannot. Earlier in this
book, I disguised C6 by using arrows for the generators 2 and 3, revealing its alternate
identity, the direct product of C2 and C3. (See Figure 6.5 on page 101 and Section 7.3.)
In contrast, it is not possible to disguise C8 as anything but a cyclic group. You may add
unneeded arrows, or leave off so many arrows that it's not a connected diagram anymore
(and therefore does not clearly show C8), but a valid Cayley diagram for C8 will always
include an order-8 arrow, and thus be recognizably cyclic. Why the difference? Why can

8.4. Direct products and relatively prime numbers
173
some Cn be disguised and others not? The answer can be expressed using isomorphisms,
but it depends on the notion of relatively prime numbers.
What it means for two numbers a and b to be relatively prime can be defined in several
ways. The definition most convenient here is based on the numbers into which both a
and b divide evenly, their common multiples. Every two numbers a and b have their
product ab as a common multiple. But they may also have a smaller common multiple;
for example 6 and 15 both divide 30, which is smaller than 6  15 D 90.
Definition 8.6 (relatively prime1). Two integers a and b are relatively prime when their
least common multiple is their product ab.
Let's see how this definition applies to Cayley diagrams of cyclic groups and their
direct products. The numbers 3 and 4 are relatively prime, and Figure 8.19 shows a
Cayley diagram for C3  C4 with the beginning of the orbit of .1; 1/ highlighted. What
order does the element .1; 1/ have? Take a moment to determine the answer by tracing
the rest of the orbit in the Cayley diagram.

Figure 8.19. Tracing the orbit of .1;1/ in the group C3  C4
As you may have noticed while tracing the orbit, each step of .1; 1/ moves to the right
one column, eventually returning from the rightmost column to the leftmost on the fourth
step, and again on the eighth step, and so on. It returns to the first column every fourth
step because of course there are four columns in the diagram. The orbit of .1; 1/ ends
when it comes back to .0; 0/, an element in the first column. Thus the number of steps
in the orbit must be a multiple of 4. A similar fact is true about rows; each step of .1; 1/
moves down one row, returning to the top row every third step. Because .0; 0/ is also in
the first row, the number of steps in the orbit of .1; 1/ must be a multiple of the number
of rows in the diagram, 3. So the order of .1; 1/ is a multiple of both 3 and 4, a common
multiple. Since the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is their product 12, the order of
.1; 1/ must be at least 12. Thus its orbit covers all of C3  C4, making C3  C4 a cyclic
1 An equivalent definition can be given in terms of common factors. Any two numbers a and b have 1 as a
common factor, but they may also have a greater common factor. For example, 6 and 15 share the factor 3. You
could define a and b to be relatively prime when their only common factor is 1 (making it also their greatest
common factor). The reason this definition is equivalent to Definition8.6 is a fact of number theory I will not
prove here.

group generated by .1; 1/. The Cayley diagram in Figure 8.19 could be unwound to a
single, 12-step cycle generated by .1; 1/.
The only assumption about 3 and 4 used in the above reasoning was that they are
relatively prime. You could rewrite the previous paragraph about a Cayley diagram for
Cn  Cm for any two relatively prime numbers n and m, and it would still be true. This
proves one half of the following important theorem, which we will use to answer the
question from the first paragraph of this section.
Theorem 8.7. Cn  Cm Å  Cnm if and only if n and m are relatively prime.
The phrase \if and only if" is a common mathematical phrase indicating that the two
halves of the sentence always occur together. That is, if n and m are relatively prime,
then the groups are isomorphic, and if the groups are isomorphic, then n and m must be
relatively prime. I have already explained why one of these two statements is true. The
paragraphs following Definition 8.6 demonstrate that if n and m are relatively prime, then
Cn  Cm is isomorphic to the cyclic group Cnm.
Furthermore, they gave enough information to determine the isomorphism explicitly.
The orbit of .1; 1/ in Cn  Cm is a cycle filling the whole group, and thus both Cn  Cm
and Cnm are cycles containing exactly nm elements. Each element in the cycle Cnm
corresponds to a step in the orbit of .1; 1/ in Cn  Cm by the isomorphism
 W Cnm ! Cn  Cm
by
.k/ D step k in the orbit of .1; 1):
I prove the other half of the theorem now.
Proof. If Cn Cm is cyclic, it must be generated by one of its elements; let's call it .a; b/
because we do not know specifically which a 2 Cn or b 2 Cm it involves. Because the
orbit of .a; b/ includes every element in Cn  Cm, the orbit of a must therefore include
every element in Cn and the orbit of b must include every element in Cm. (If hai did not
include some c 2 A, how would h.a; b/i ever include an element starting with c?) Thus
a generates Cn (and is of order n) and b generates Cm (and is of order m). Figure 8.20
is therefore an acceptable way to organize a Cayley diagram of Cn  Cm, with generators

.a; e/ and .e; b/ as arrows. The orbit of .a; b/ walks through this diagram much as the
orbit of .1; 1/ walks through the diagram in Figure 8.19.
Let's see why the order of .a; b/ must be the least common multiple of n and m.
The orbit visits column 1 of the diagram after step m, step 2m, step 3m, and so on, all
multiples of m, the number of columns in the diagram. Similarly, the orbit visits row
1 after steps that are multiples of n. Thus it visits the identity element, in both row 1
and column 1, after steps that are multiples of both n and m, any one of their common
multiples. The order of .a; b/ is defined as the first power that returns to the identity
element. So in this case, the order of .a; b/ will be the least common multiple of n and
m. But we know that the orbit of .a; b/ includes all nm elements of Cn  Cm, and so
the least common multiple of n and m is nm, and they are relatively prime.
Theorem 8.7 answers the question of when it is possible to disguise a cyclic group as a
direct product. If a cyclic group has an order that can be factored into two relatively prime
numbers, as 6 D 2  3, then it can be diagrammed as a direct product, C6 Å  C2  C3.
By contrast, the number 8 factors only into 2  4, two numbers that are not relatively
prime, and thus C8 6Å  C2  C4. Theorem 8.7 has other applications, some of which you
will explore in this chapter's exercises. It can help determine the shapes of certain cycle
graphs (Exercise 8.23) and determine efficient embeddings for Cn in Sm (Exercise 8.27).
It also applies in the following section and the related exercises.
8.5
The Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups
Abelian groups have a simple definition: all pairs of elements commute (ab D ba). But
the consequences of this one small requirement are so significant that a statement of its
full implications directs the course of much of the study of group theory! This section
tells us why.
We can get an idea of just how special abelian groups are by looking at Cayley
diagrams for a representative sample of them. Figure 8.21 shows six abelian groups'
Cayley diagrams. It includes two one-dimensional diagrams for one-generator abelian
groups (cyclic ones), two two-dimensional diagrams for two-generator abelian groups, and
two three-dimensional diagrams for three-generator abelian groups. The pattern typifying
abelian groups (the leftmost pattern in Figure 5.8 on page 69) appears throughout each
Cayley diagram in Figure 8.21. It makes all arrows parallel to arrows of the same color
and perpendicular to arrows of other colors. (Those slightly curved arrows in some parts
of Figure 8.21 could be flattened out, but I curved them to improve readability.)
As Figure 8.21 shows, abelian groups' Cayley diagrams are grids. Some are one-
dimensional grids (just a line), some are two-dimensional grids (like graph paper), and
some are three-dimensional grids (one or more boxes). But all have the parallel-and-
perpendicular pattern just mentioned. And most importantly, that pattern is not only in-
dicative of a group's being abelian, but also of a direct product structure. The Funda-
mental Theorem of Abelian Groups states this important connection precisely.
Theorem 8.8 (Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups). Every finite abelian group A
is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. That is, there is some list of integers

Although we learned about abelian groups in Chapter 5 and direct products in Chapter
7, we did not encounter isomorphisms until this chapter, and thus were unable to state this
theorem until now. I do not include the proof of Theorem 8.8 here, because it is lengthy.
I guide interested readers through constructing a proof in the exercises in Section 8.7.10.
The important consequence of this theorem for the study of group theory is that abelian
groups are very easy to understand! We understand cyclic groups and direct products very
well, so abelian groups are built from two simple group theoretic concepts. Thus the grid-
like Cayley diagrams in Figure 8.21 give an appropriately clean and organized impression;
all the tangled intricacy possible in groups takes place in the non-abelian ones.

8.6. Semidirect products revisited
177
You could say that groups are like cities. A map of Long Island is very different from
a map of Paris. It's much easier to give directions, to follow directions, and to picture
your location when on Long Island, because all streets are straight, all turns are right
angles, and all blocks are the same size. It's comprehensible in the same way abelian
groups are, and so its map is a grid, just as is the Cayley diagram of an abelian group.
Paris is a much harder city to navigate; the streets curve, connect at varying angles, and
have varying lengths. It is much more difficult to get to know your way around, just as
non-abelian groups require more study.
This is what I meant earlier by saying that the Fundamental Theorem of Abelian
Groups impacts where we direct our efforts; because abelian groups are so well under-
stood, the bulk of the study of group theory is aimed at non-abelian groups. The following
section and Chapter 9 both contain material aimed primarily at better understanding non-

Semidirect products revisited
In Chapter 7, I introduced semidirect products by connecting rewirings of Cayley dia-
grams. I confessed that I was only introducing some semidirect products then, and prom-
ised to finish the job later. Now we can use the power of homomorphisms to do just that.
Definition 7.4 specified that a rewiring rearranges a Cayley diagram's arrows but not
its nodes. For this reason, a rewiring that has both its nodes and its arrows labeled carries
a complete record of how the diagram was rewired. Consider, for example, Figure8.22,
a rewiring of V4. You can tell how the green and red arrows originally connected the dia-
gram, because obviously the v arrow (green) must originally have connected e to v, and the
h arrow (red) must originally have connected e to h. Or we could state this in terms of what
the rewiring action did: It moved the h arrows to where v arrows were, and the v arrows
to where d arrows would have been, had they been included in the original diagram.

Figure 8.22. A rewiring of the group V4, with both nodes and arrows labeled to make clear
how the rewiring was done
Stating it this way reveals that the rewiring is a function; it maps each of the group's
generators to one the group's elements. But it is not just any function; the definition of
rewiring (Definition 7.4) requires that it result in no change to the group's multiplication
table. In other words, the group structure after the rewiring must be no different than
before. This is precisely what it takes to be an isomorphism! Every rewiring of a group is
an isomorphism from the group to itself. Although rewirings only show where to map a
Cayley diagram's arrows, those arrows generate the group, and as on page161, knowing

178
8. The power of homomorphisms
where to map the generators tells us how to generate the entire homomorphism (or in this
case isomorphism).
Let's build an isomorphism from the rewiring in Figure 8.22. Let  W V4 ! V4 be
generated by .h/ D v and .v/ D d. We can generate the following full description of
 using the procedure exemplified on page 161.
.e/ D e
.h/ D v
.v/ D d
.d/ D h
The standard mathematical term for an isomorphism from an object to itself is automor-
phism. The prefix \auto" means \self."
Chapter 7 told us that the set of rewirings (now called automorphisms) of a group
G is also a group; we write it as Aut.G/. Look back at Figure 7.18, which showed
the rewiring group Aut.V4/. We used Cayley diagrams like that one to create semidirect
product groups by connecting corresponding elements in the rewirings, as in Figure 7.19.
The result was the semidirect product group G Ã Aut.G/. In general, however, there
exist semidirect product groups G Ã H for any group H at all. In Chapter 7 we did not
have the tools to describe how such products can be constructed, but now we do.
The process is similar to that for the direct product, given in Definition 7.1. The direct
product process fills nodes of one factor with copies of the other, then connects corre-
sponding elements. The semidirect product process connects rewirings instead, so we need
a way to fill each element of H with a rewiring of G. That is, we need a map of elements
of H to elements of Aut.G/. An example homomorphism of this type is shown in Figure
8.23; it maps C3 into Aut.V4/, and its image is the outer ring of the automorphism group.
Any homomorphism whose codomain is an automorphism group, as in Figure 8.23,
enables us to form a semidirect product group. The following definition explains the
process completely. Compare it to the direct product process in Definition 7.1 and note
how they are nearly the same. Like Definition 7.1, this definition includes an example,
illustrated in Figure 8.24. Because different homomorphisms lead to different semidirect

products, we distinguish them using subscripts: G Ã H means the semidirect product
created using the homomorphism .
Definition 8.9 (technique for constructing semidirect products using Cayley diagrams).
To create a Cayley diagram of G Ã H from a Cayley diagram of G and a homomorphism
 W H ! Aut.G/, proceed as follows.
1. Begin with the Cayley diagram for H.
In the example in Figure 8.24, the group H D C3 appears on the left.
2. Inflate each node h in the Cayley diagram of H and place in it a diagram of the
rewiring .h/.
In the middle of Figure 8.24, each of the three nodes h 2 C3 grew larger to contain a
copy of .h/, using the  from Figure 8.23.
3. Remove the (inflated) nodes of H while using the arrows of H to connect corre-
sponding nodes from each rewiring, just as in the construction of a direct product
group.
In the example in Figure 8.24, each rewiring has four nodes. Thus the top left nodes
in all the rewirings correspond to one another, and we connect them as a little copy
of C3. We do the same with the top right nodes, then bottom left, then bottom right,
resulting in a complete Cayley diagram for V4 Ã C3.
As was promised in Chapter 7, we now see exactly how A4 is a semidirect product
of V4 and C3; it is the semidirect product in Figure 8.24. We could therefore label the
elements in V4 Ã C3 with the names from A4. But in any semidirect product, we also
have the option to name the nodes as pairs, just as in the case of a direct product. Give
the name .g; h/ to the element that was g in the rewiring .h/.

8.7.5
Abelianization
Section 8.4 showed how to divide Z by hni to make all multiples of n zero. We now
wish to divide a non-abelian group by its \non-abelian parts," to make them zero, leaving
only abelian parts in the resulting quotient. This process is called abelianization, and is
investigated in the exercises in this section.
Exercise 8.15. Figure 5.8 on page 69 shows the pattern in Cayley diagrams distinguishing
abelian and non-abelian groups, the visualization of the equation ab D ba.
(a) Use algebra to show that the equation aba 1b 1 D e is equivalent to the original.
(b) Use algebra to show that it is also equivalent to the equation ab.ba/ 1 D e.
(c) Create an illustration of what aba 1b 1 Â¤ e looks like in a Cayley diagram.
Based on Exercise 8.15, a group G containing an element ab.ba/ 1 that is not the
identity e cannot be abelian. Such elements are called commutators. We wish to form the
commutator subgroup, generated by the set of all commutators. Then we will divide G
by it to eliminate all the elements that keep G from being abelian, and an abelian group
will result.
Exercise 8.16. Explain why the commutator subgroup must be a normal subgroup.
Exercise 8.17. The abelianization of a group G is the quotient of G by its commutator
subgroup.
(a) Compute the abelianization of S3.
(b) Compute the abelianization of A4.
(c) Compute the abelianization of D5. What does it have in common with the abelian-
ization of D3 from part (a)?
(d) The group D2 is isomorphic to V4, which is abelian. What is its abelianization?
(e) Compute the abelianization of the groups D4 and D6.
(f) What general conclusion do you draw about the abelianizations of dihedral groups?
Exercise 8.18. Use the abelianizations in Exercise 8.17 to help you determine whether
an abelianization of a group is the same thing as its largest abelian subgroup.

Exercise 8.43. If a group G has two subgroups H and K, we write HK to mean the
set of elements obtained by multiplying any h 2 H by any k 2 K, as in hk. In other
words, combine all the elements of all the left cosets hK for any h 2 H; this is the same
as combining all the right cosets Hk for all the k 2 K.
This problem deals with the special case when H and K are both normal subgroups.
Consider the homomorphism  W H  K ! G by .h; k/ D hk, which takes pairs of
elements from H  K and multiplies them in G. Notice that Im./ D HK.
(a) If H and K intersect only at the identity element, explain why  is an isomorphism
(and thus H  K Å  HK).
(b) Is the reverse also true? That is, if H  K Å  HK, must H and K only overlap at e?

Finite Abelian Groups
Exercise 8.44. For each order given below, list all abelian groups of that order. Use the

In the following chapter, we will learn to list all groups of a given order (if the order
is relatively small).
The remaining exercises in this section ask you to complete a proof of the Fundamental
Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, following an outline developed elsewhere [14, 20].
Some hints are available in the Appendix.
Any composite number can be factored, and then its factors can be factored, and so
on, until only prime numbers are left. This is called a prime factorization. Here is an
example.
600 D 30  20 D 2  15  2  10 D 2  3  5  2  2  5
If we write the primes in increasing order and combine duplicates using exponents, we
can write 600 D 23  3  52.
The proof of Theorem 8.8 begins by breaking up an abelian group in a similar way.
For example, if A is an abelian group of order 600, we can find groups G2, G3, and G5
so that A Å  G2  G3  G5 and jG2j D 23, jG3j D 3, and jG5j D 52. The following
exercise asks you to prove that we can separate any abelian group into a direct product
of factors whose orders are the powers of primes in the prime factorization of the group's
order.

Exercise 8.45. Let A be any abelian group, and let p be a prime number that divides
the order of A. Make the following definitions.
Gp D the set of all g 2 A whose orders are powers of p (including p0 D 1)
S D the set of all g 2 A whose orders do not have p as a factor
(a) Show that Gp and S are both subgroups of A.
(b) What elements do Gp and S have in common? Justify your answer.
Exercise 8.43 defined multiplication of two subgroups. Let's show that GpS is actually
the whole group A; take any g 2 A and we will show that it is in GpS.
Let pk be the highest power of p that divides jgj. Then jgj D pkm for some number
m into which p does not divide, making pk and m relatively prime. From Exercise 8.24,
we take the equation apk D bmC 1, and we can then write the equation gapk D gbmC1.
(c) How does this equation help show that g 2 GpS?
(d) Therefore what is the relationship between A, Gp, and S? Why?
(e) Explain how repeating steps (a) through (d) for other values of p achieves the desired
result. (You may assume that Gp Â¤ feg; this is guaranteed to be true by Theorem 9.6
of Chapter 9.)
The previous exercise showed that any abelian group A can be factored into groups
whose orders are powers of primes. Thus if we can prove Theorem8.8 just about abelian
groups whose orders are powers of primes, we can then apply it to the factors of A and
the entire result is proven. Exercise 8.47 accomplishes this, and the argument it uses
depends upon Exercise 8.46.
Exercise 8.46. This exercise shows that the following fact holds for all abelian groups
G whose order is a power of a prime p: If G has only one subgroup of order p, then G
is cyclic. (We already know that if G is cyclic, then it has only one subgroup of order p;
that was Exercise 6.8. Now we're working in the other direction.)
Assume we have an abelian group G whose order is a power of p, and H is its only
subgroup of order p. If jGj D p, then we know that G is cyclic from Exercise 6.12.
Since that is the easy case, assume jGj > p.
(a) Let  W G ! G be the homomorphism that raises all elements to the p power, as in
Exercise 8.13. Show that if Im./ is a cyclic group, then G must be a cyclic group.
Even if the group Im./ < G is not a cyclic group, it is still an abelian group whose
order is a power of p, like G. Therefore set up a sequence of homomorphisms as follows.
Let 1 W G ! G be the homomorphism  from part (a), 1.g/ D gp.
Let 2 W Im.1/ ! Im.1/ also be defined by 2.g/ D gp.
Let 3 W Im.2/ ! Im.2/ also be defined by 3.g/ D gp, and so on for 4, etc.
(b) For which of the images Im.n/ is H < Im.n/?
(c) How many subgroups can Im.n/ have of order p?
(d) Illustrate the chain of connected homomorphisms 1, 2, 3, and so on. How does
the chain end, and what are the last few groups before the end?

8.7. Exercises
191
(e) Put together the facts from parts (a) through (d) to prove the goal stated at the
beginning of this exercise.
Exercise 8.47. This exercise shows that you can factor an abelian group G whose order
is a power of a prime p into a direct product C  H for some cyclic subgroup C of G
and another subgroup H of G. The process for finding C and factoring it out can then be
reapplied to H to factor out another cycle, and so on, until G is shown to be a product
of cycles.
Take any element in G with the highest order (or tied for it) and let C be the cyclic
subgroup generated by that element. If C D G, then G is cyclic, and so we don't have
to do any work to factor it into cycles. Thus the interesting case is when G is not cyclic.
(a) When G is not cyclic, what does Exercise 8.46 tell us?
(b) Because C is cyclic, how many subgroups of order p does it have?
(c) Use the previous two parts to explain why there is a subgroup K < G of order p
that is not a subgroup of C. How many elements do C and K have in common?
(d) What does Exercise 8.43 say about C and K? (Keep in mind that both are normal
in G because it is abelian.)
We can take a quotient G
K because G is abelian; let q W G ! G
K be the quotient map.
(e) To what does q map the subgroup CK < G? To what is that subgroup isomorphic?
(f) Explain why G
K contains a cycle of the same size as C.
As in the previous exercise, let's build a chain of homomorphisms; I'll use G1, C1,
K1, and q1 to refer to G, C, K, and q, as the start of the sequence. Let G2 stand for G1
K1
and let C2 stand for the cycle of the same size as C1 in G2. Exercise 7.22 and Exercise
7.23 part (c) guarantee that G1
K1 is an abelian group whose order is a power of p. We can
therefore find a subgroup K2 < G2 that is not a subgroup of C2, and take a quotient G2
K2
with the map q2, just as in part (c).
This process could continue with G3 D G2
K2 and so on. Yet of course the orders of
these groups are decreasing, jG1j > jG2j > jG3j.
(g) Where will this process lead? That is, when does it stop, and what is the final Gn?
(h) As in Exercise 8.46, work backwards from the last group Gn to show that at every
step, Gi is isomorphic to a product Ci  Hi for some subgroup Hi of Gi.
Hint: Hn D Kn. What are Hn 1, Hn 2, and so on?
Exercise
8.48. Summarize the argument in the past three exercises. That is, explain
(without the details) how to factor any abelian group A into a product of cyclic groups,
and why the combination of Exercises 8.45 through 8.47 proves that it is possible.
Exercise 8.49. The exercises in this section have proven something stronger than The-
orem 8.8, which put no requirements on what the subscripts n1 through nm had to be
like. Yet our proof guarantees something special about those subscripts. What can you
say about n1 through nm, based on Exercise 8.45?

192
8. The power of homomorphisms
Exercise 8.50. If an infinite abelian group G is generated by g1; : : : ; gn, only some of
which have finite order, then how might we write G as a cross product of cyclic groups?
(The proof of this infinite version of Theorem 8.8 is lengthier than the proof built
from Exercises 8.45 through 8.47. I do not ask you to prove your answer to this question,
but rather make a reasonable conjecture about an infinite version of the theorem.)

Sylow theory
This chapter is about one question: What groups are there? In Chapter 5, we met a variety
of groups, to gain a breadth of exposure to the subject. But it was just a sample, not a
comprehensive list. We have since seen groups outside the five families of that chapter.
Seeing a list of all groups would surely benefit our knowledge of (and intuition for) group
theory. This chapter begins to make such a list.
Of course, there are infinitely many groups, so we cannot list them all! But we can
start with the smallest ones and grow our list to include larger ones. For starters, we can
ask what groups there are of order 1. (There's just one, C1.) What groups are there of
order 2? If we answer that question, and then move on to order 3, then 4, and so on, we
build up a reference library of all groups up to a certain size. To answer such questions,
we need a method for finding all the groups of a given order.
Exercise 8.44 is a simplified version of this problem, asking you to find all abelian
groups of a given order. The Fundamental Theorem of Abelian Groups (Theorem 8.8) is
a powerful tool for answering that exercise. But the complexity of group theory lies in the
non-abelian groups, so to find all groups of a given order, we need stronger tools. Those
tools are the Sylow Theorems, and although they do not give us a foolproof method for
finding all groups of a given order, they guide our search by telling us what structures
such groups must contain. From just a group's order, they can answer questions like these.
1. How big are its subgroups?
2. How are those subgroups related?
3. How many subgroups are there?
4. Are any of them normal?
The Sylow Theorems do not always fully answer each of these questions, but their power
comes from the fact that they can give answers based only on a group's order. This
chapter proves the three Sylow Theorems and uses them to find all groups of order 10 or
less and some orders beyond 10. In this way the chapter begins to answer the question
\What groups are there?"
193

194
9. Sylow theory
The Sylow Theorems also answer another question, one that's been lingering since
Section 6.5, about Lagrange's Theorem. That theorem tells us that if G has a subgroup
of order n, then n must be a factor of jGj. I asked whether this statement would still be
true if we turned it around: If n is a factor of jGj, then must G have a subgroup of order
n? This is called the converse of Lagrange's Theorem, and we saw that it is not true; just
because Lagrange's Theorem permits a subgroup of a certain size does not guarantee that
such a subgroup will exist. Sylow Theory digs deeper, finding which sizes of subgroups
are guaranteed to exist.
The common thread among this chapter's theorems is that they determine group struc-
ture based on group order. I illustrate this common thread by applying each theorem to
an unknown group A of order 200. I make no assumptions about A except that it has
order 200; it could be an abelian group such as C200, a non-abelian group such as D100,
or a group we've never heard of. To illustrate how little we've assumed about A, Figure
9.1 contains a diagram with almost no content. The group A contains an identity e, but
the scattered question marks indicate that we don't know anything about the other 199
elements of A. (Yet.)
In fact, there are several different groups of order 200, and we don't even know which
one A is. The theorems in this chapter tell us what structures all groups of order 200 have
in common, and we can conclude that A contains those structures. As we meet each new
theorem in the chapter, I use it to update the illustration in Figure 9.1, removing question
marks and replacing them with new information. To preview how Figure 9.1 will evolve,
you can look ahead to Figures 9.6, 9.13, 9.18, and 9.20.

its internal structure. This chapter teaches several theorems that will reveal much of that structure.
9.1
Group actions
I prepare us for the theorems of this chapter by expanding our understanding of groups
as collections of actions. In Chapter 3 we saw many applications of groups as collections
of actions, beginning with the rectangle puzzle. We studied groups that permute dancers,
coins, and other objects. In Chapter 10 we will learn how studying groups that rearrange
polynomial roots made mathematical history.
It is no coincidence that applications of group theory often mention permutations
(rearrangements). We proved at the end of Chapter 4 a tight connection between the two

9.1. Group actions
195
concepts: Every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group of permutations. Using the
language of homomorphisms, we say that every group can be embedded into some Sn.
Because of this connection, given any group of actions, we should be able to find
a set of things it permutes. Sometimes such a set is obvious, as in the example of the
dancers; their dancing rearranged them, and it was therefore the dancers themselves being
permuted. In other examples, such as the rectangle puzzle, what's being permuted is less
obvious. In fact, in the rectangle puzzle, we have two different ways to look at it, both of
which are valid. The symmetry-measuring technique in Definition 3.1 suggests viewing
the actions as permuting the numbered corners of the rectangle, which they do. However,
I prefer an alternative that connects more closely to Cayley diagrams, like the Cayley
diagram of the rectangle puzzle in Figure 2.7 on page 18. If we view the actions as
permuting the configurations of the rectangle, then each arrow type in the Cayley diagram
in Figure 2.7 clearly shows how its group element permutes the configurations.
Our knowledge of homomorphisms enables us to turn this principle into a mathemat-
ical definition. In the following definition, I write Perm.S/ to indicate the group of all
possible permutations of the elements of a set S. (So the group structure of Perm.S/ is
the same as Sn, for n D jSj.)
Definition 9.1 (group acting on a set). A group G acts on a set S if there is a homo-
morphism  W G ! Perm.S/.
Think of  as a way to interpret every g 2 G as doing something to the elements
of S (rearranging them). That is, .g/ is the action that g takes on the elements of S.
The definition requires that  be a homomorphism (not just a function) because we want
to interpret a combination of group elements as a combination of actions. That is, the
interpretation of ab should be two actions in succession, the action for a and then the
action for b. This requirement can be expressed as the equation .ab/ D .a/.b/,
which is the defining characteristic of homomorphisms.
Let's see some example group actions, beginning with the familiar rectangle puzzle.
If S is the set of four configurations from Figure 2.7, then the arrows show how the
actions permute those configurations, and we can formalize that action to fit Definition
9.1 as follows. The group V4 D hh; vi acts on S by the interpretation homomorphism
 W V4 ! Perm.S/ with the following definition.
.h/ D the permutation swapping each configuration with its horizontal flip
.v/ D the permutation swapping each configuration with its vertical flip
It is just as easy to rewrite any Cayley diagram of a group of symmetries to show
that it fits Definition 9.1. Thus we can see the technique of Definition 3.1 as leading
(indirectly) to a group G and an interpretation homomorphism  W G ! Perm.S/, with
S being the set of configurations of the object. But the technique does not give just any
G and ; its symmetry-measuring ability came from the following two desirable traits.
1. The image of  is exactly those permutations corresponding to actions possible by
hand (guaranteed by part (2) of Definition 3.1).1
1 Imposing different restrictions in part (2) of Definition 3.1 would create group actions whose homomorphisms
have different images. For example, some definitions of symmetry include any manipulation that alters neither
distances nor angles, including some manipulations not possible by hand. (One such manipulation is turning
the object into its mirror reflection.)

196
9. Sylow theory
2. The homomorphism  is an embedding, so that G is isomorphic to that image. (Because
we create  from the Cayley diagram drawn in part (3) of Definition 3.1.)
Thus the technique from Definition 3.1 constructs a very specific kind of group action,
one that corresponds to the object's three-dimensional symmetries. Of course, other groups
may act on the object's configurations in ways that have nothing to do with symmetry.
Thus our first example of group actions, while familiar, was a special case. To get a
broader idea of what group actions can be like, we need to see some different examples.
Let S still stand for the configurations of the rectangle, and define  W V4 ! Perm.S/
by
.h/ D the permutation swapping each configuration with its horizontal flip,
and .v/ D the identity permutation:
This homomorphism violates both conditions given above that  satisfies, because it was
not designed to measure or reflect the rectangle's symmetry. It will therefore result in a
different kind of group action than  did. Figure 9.2 diagrams that group action.

Figure 9.2. The group V4 acts on the configurations of the rectangle puzzle by the homomorphism
 defined in the text. That homomorphism assigns v to the identity permutation (no action), so the
v arrows in this diagram do not alter the rectangle at all.
It is not a Cayley diagram for two reasons. First, there are not enough arrows to
connect all the configurations to one another. Second, although a group must have only
one identity element, the non-identity element v is drawn as if it were the same as the
identity element e. I call diagrams of group actions (like Figure 9.2) action diagrams.
Some action diagrams are Cayley diagrams (Figure 2.7) and some are not (Figure 9.2).
Like Cayley diagrams, action diagrams include arrows only for generators.
Because action diagrams are not Cayley diagrams, they have some new structures that
we have not seen before. The following two definitions give names to two such structures
that are important for the rest of this chapter.

9.1. Group actions
197
Definition 9.2 (orbit). When a group G acts on a set S, the orbit of any s in S is the
set of elements of S that G arrows can reach from s. I write it as Orb.s/.
For example, in Figure 9.2, the orbit of the original rectangle configuration (top left) is
the pair of configurations in the top row of the figure. The only other orbit in the figure is
the pair of configurations in the bottom row; each orbit has just two elements. In contrast,
in Figure 2.7, the orbit of any one configuration is the entire set of four configurations.
Obviously two different orbits are totally unconnected by an action diagram's arrows.
(If they were connected, they would be just one orbit, not two.) This makes orbits easy
to spot in an action diagram, and means that the orbits partition S. Orbits arise when
there aren't enough arrows to connect the whole diagram, as in Figure9.2. The redundant
arrows in that same figure (the v arrows, which act like e arrows) give rise to the following
complementary notion.
Definition 9.3 (stabilizer, stable). The stabilizer of an element s in S is the set of group
elements g that don't move s. I write it as Stab.s/. A configuration s in S is called stable
if no actions move s (that is, Stab.s/ is all of G).
For example, the stabilizer of any configuration in Figure 9.2 is fe; vg. Neither e nor
v arrows lead from any configuration to a different configuration. But in Figure 2.7, the
stabilizer of any configuration of the rectangle is just feg. Notice that while orbits are
collections of elements of S, stabilizers are collections of elements of G. Exercise 9.17
will ask you to explain why any stabilizer is a group (and therefore a subgroup of G).
We have not yet seen an example with any stable elements; the following example fills
that gap. In this example, S3 acts on its own subgroups, which is good preparation for the
rest of the chapter, because Sylow theory is built on using groups to act on group-theoretic
objects like subgroups and cosets. Let S stand for all the subgroups of S3.

The homomorphism  W S3 ! Perm.S/ will have S3 act on S as follows.
.g/ D the permutation that moves each subgroup H to the subgroup gHg 1
For such an action, we say that S3 acts on S \by conjugation." Figure 9.3 shows the
corresponding action diagram and each permutation in the image of the homomorphism.2
I adopt the convention of putting stable elements on the left of an action diagram and
larger orbits on the right. This action diagram is not a Cayley diagram, but for a different
reason than Figure 9.2; it is not regular, and therefore lacks the uniform symmetry of a
Cayley diagram.
Now that we have seen examples of both orbits and stabilizers, let's see how they
relate. The larger Orb.s/ is, the more group elements move s around, and the smaller
2 Beware of a common misinterpretation of Figure9.3: If, from a subgroup H of g, we follow two arrows
in succession, say r then f , we have conjugated first by r and then by f .
H
first conjugate by r
          ! rHr 1 then conjugate by f
           ! f rHr 1f  1
The result of conjugating by r and then f is not the same as conjugating by the element rf , as we might expect.
Rather, it is the same as conjugating by f r. This reversal is an unavoidable consequence of the definition of
conjugacy.

Figure 9.3. The group S3 acts on its own subgroups by conjugation. Each element in S3 maps
to a permutation of S, as shown. Note that none of the permutations move feg or hri, and those
two elements are stable.
Stab.s/ must be. Conversely, the larger Stab.s/ is, the fewer elements there are that move
s, and so the smaller Orb.s/ must be. Although this give-and-take relationship makes
sense as just stated, it is not very specific; the following theorem makes it precise.
Theorem 9.4 (Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem). The size of an element's orbit times the size
of its stabilizer is the size of the group.
jOrb.s/j  jStab.s/j D jGj
This indeed makes the statements from the previous paragraph precise; for a given orbit
size, the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem immediately determines the size of the same element's
stabilizer (and vice versa). Although Orb.s/ is not a group, I still use the notation jOrb.s/j
to mean the number of elements in it. I will continue to use this notation for the size
of any set. Before reading the following proof, consider using Figure 9.3 to find Orb.s/

9.2. Approaching Sylow: Cauchyâs Theorem
199
and Stab.s/ for each s 2 S. It should help your intuition for the theorem, and make the
following proof more concrete.
Proof. Because Stab.s/ is a subgroup of G, the definition of subgroup index (Definition
6.9) tells us that
jStab.S/j

 ÅG W Stab.s/Â

Æâ

number of cosets
D jGj :
I prove that the number of elements in Orb.s/ equals the number of cosets of Stab.s/,
so that I can substitute jOrb.s/j for ÅG W Stab.s/Â in the above equation to prove the
theorem. I show that each left coset of Stab.s/ pairs up with some element of Orb.s/ in
a one-to-one relationship, and thus the two sets must be the same size.
First, let's see that the elements of any left coset gStab.s/ all move s to the same
place, so that no coset corresponds to more than one element of Orb.s/. Consider two
elements of gStab.s/, say gh1 and gh2. If  is the interpretation homomorphism, then
.gh1/ D .g/.h1/
and
.gh2/ D .g/.h2/:
But h1 and h2 are in Stab.s/, so neither .h1/ nor .h2/ moves s. Thus we can rewrite
the above equations as
.gh1/ D .g/
and
.gh2/ D .g/:
Both gh1 and gh2 have the same effect on s, as would any other element of gStab.s/.
Next, let's see that elements of different left cosets correspond to different operations
on s, so that no element of Orb.s/ corresponds to more than one coset of Stab.s/. Consider
two different cosets gStab.s/ and kStab.s/; I show that they affect s differently. In a
Cayley diagram of G, any arrow h from gStab.s/ to kStab.s/ corresponds to the action
that changes the results of the gStab.s/ action into the results of the kStab.s/ action.
Thus if gStab.s/ and kStab.s/ have the same effect on s, then h should do nothing to s
at all. But the h arrow begins in one copy of Stab.s/ and ends in another, and thus h is
not in the subgroup Stab.s/. It does move s, and so gStab.s/ and kStab.s/ have different
effects on s.
The previous two paragraphs establish a one-to-one relationship between the left cosets
of Stab.s/ and the elements of Orb.s/. Thus the two sets have the same size, and we can
substitute jOrb.s/j for ÅG W Stab.s/Â in the first equation in this proof so that the desired
relationship holds.
jOrb.s/j  jStab.s/j D jGj

Approaching Sylow: Cauchyâs Theorem
Theorem 9.4 is a key insight into group actions that will be used to prove many of
this chapter's theorems. The first, Cauchy's theorem, gives us a small, partial converse
to Lagrange's Theorem, by guaranteeing the existence of subgroups of prime order. In
Section 9.4, the Sylow Theorems will build on Cauchy's Theorem and extend it. Cauchy's
Theorem uses the following short theorem, built on the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem.

non-stable elements in orbits of size p
The number of non-stable elements is a multiple of .p
Figure 9.4. A group of prime order p acts on the elements of S. Therefore elements of S are
either stable or part of an orbit of size p.
Theorem 9.5. If a group G of prime order p acts on a set S, then the order of S and
the number of stable elements in S are congruent mod p.
Recall that what it means for two elements to be congruent mod p is that the distance
between them on the number line is a multipleof p, so that they are in the same congruence
class. We first pictured congruence classes this way in Figure 8.16.
By now it should come as no surprise that I find this theorem far easier to understand
and to prove if I draw a picture of it. The following short proof is based on Figure 9.4,
which shows what action diagrams for groups of prime order look like.
Proof. The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem tells us that the size of each Orb.s/ is a factor of
jGj, so when jGj is a prime p, all orbits have size 1 or p. The stable elements are in
orbits of size 1 (each by itself) and the rest of S is partitioned into orbits of size p. The
number of non-stable elements in S is therefore a multiple of p, as in Figure 9.4.
Consider the following straightforward equation.
number of stable elements in S C number of non-stable elements in S
â
Æâ
â¦
This is a multiple of p.
D size of S
Another way to read this equation is that the distance (on the number line) between the
number of stable elements in S and the size of S is a multiple of p, and so they must be
in the same congruence class mod p.
Theorem 9.6 (Cauchy's Theorem). If p is a prime number that divides jGj, then G has
an element g of order p, and therefore a subgroup hgi of order p.
Proof. Because p is prime, if I find some g Â¤ e satisfying gp D e, then g must have
order p. Exercise 9.15 asks you to explain why this is so, but for now I use the fact
without justification.
In most groups there are lots of ways to multiply p group elements together and result
in the identity element e, but usually only a small minority of them are powers, like the
gp we're looking for. The equation ep D e is part of that minority and is true in any
group, but we seek a g other than the identity.

Table 9.1. All equations a  b  c D e for any a;b; c 2 S3
For example, consider the case when G D S3 and p D 3. Table 9.1 lists all products
of three S3 elements that yield e. Direct your attention to the left-hand sides of these
equations, the 36 expressions in the set
fe  e  e; e  r  r2; e  r2  r; : : : ; f r2  f r2  eg:
In this example and for any G and p in general, I call this set of expressions S, and the
set of powers in it (like ep) I call P .
This proof focuses on S and P , and so it will be helpful to know how many elements
are in those sets. Let's deal with S first. In the example of G D S3 and p D 3, there are
obviously 36 equations in Table 9.1. Let's see why that total comes to 36, and discern the
general pattern from there. To create one of the equations in Table 9.1, you can choose
any of the six S3 elements to be the first in the equation and any of those same six
elements to follow it, but then the final element of the equation's left side is constrained
to be the one element that makes that left side equal e. If we call the first two elements a
and b, then the third must be nothing other than .ab/ 1. In Table 9.1, these two choices
(of a and b) correspond to each of the six columns and six rows, respectively, giving 36
equations in all.
If p were larger, creating an element of S could be done by a similar (but longer)
sequence of choices. For p D 5, you could choose elements a, b, c, and d, but then the
fifth element must be .abcd/ 1 to make the equation a  b  c  d  .abcd/ 1 D e true.
For any size p, choose the first p   1 elements from G any way at all, but then the last
element must be the inverse of their product. Thus creating an element of S involves
jGj choices for each of the first p   1 elements but no choice at all for the last element,
giving the following equation for the size of S.
jSj D jGj  jGj      jGj

Out of this total of jGjp 1 expressions, the ones I care about are those in P , those
elements g satisfying the equation gp D e. In the example of G D S3 and p D 3, Table
9.1 shows that P contains three elements. But how many does it contain in general, for
any G and p? It is impossible to get a precise answer from how little we know of G, but
I do not need a precise answer. I need to prove only that jP j > 1, so that there is some
g 2 P besides e. Strategic use of Theorem 9.5 can tell us something about jP j. That

Figure 9.5. The group C3 acts on the set of triples of elements of S3 that multiply to e, as

each triple to the right one step.
theorem deals with group actions and their stable elements, so the strategy is to devise a
group action whose stable elements are the members of P .
Let the cyclic group Cp act on S with the interpretation homomorphism  W Cp !
Perm.S/ defined by
.n/ D the permutation that cycles the elements in an expression to the right n steps:
For example, the action .1/ sends the expression e  r  r2 to the expression r2  e  r.
The action .2/ would cycle the expression f r  r2  f to the right two steps, giving
r2  f  f r. Figure 9.5 shows the action diagram in the case where G D S3 and p D 3.
In Exercise 9.16, I ask you to prove that each .n/ will be a permutation of S, as I have
claimed above.
I set up this action intending that its stable elements should be just the members of
P . We can see that this is the case, because those expressions that .1/ does not change
are those in which each element is the same as the next, making them all equal. Thus
the stable elements are just those in P . And because Cp is a group of prime order, we
can apply Theorem 9.5 to give us some information about jP j. Theorem 9.5 gives us the

9.2. Approaching Sylow: Cauchyâs Theorem
203
equation jSj p jP j. But jSj D jGjp 1, and jGj is a multiple of p, making jSj and jP j
multiples of p as well. Although we do not know exactly what jP j is, we now know that
it is in the set f0; p; 2p; 3p; : : :g.
But it cannot be zero, because ep is in P . So there must be at least p elements in
P , which means at least 2 (the smallest prime). Thus there is at least one other equation
gp D e besides ep D e, which gives us the element g of order p that we have been
seeking.
After every important theorem in this chapter, we will take the theorem for a test drive
to see what it can do. I have selected two applications of Cauchy's Theorem to show
us its power. First, recall the unknown group A of order 200 from Figure 9.1; Cauchy's
Theorem gives us some new information to add to the diagram. The number 200 factors
into 2352, so the only primes dividing 200 are 2 and 5. Cauchy's Theorem therefore says
that A contains elements a and b of orders 2 and 5 respectively, as shown in Figure 9.6.

9.6 guarantees
The elements a and b (and thus the subgroups hai and hbi) exist regardless of what
group A is; Cauchy's Theorem requires only that 2 and 5 divide the group's order. I
still include many question marks in the picture, because we only know about two small
subgroups of this very large group! We do not yet know whether there are more subgroups
of the same sizes as hai and hbi, or whether there are any larger subgroups. But Cauchy's
Theorem did tell us some information, and in fact the kind of information it gives us can
be even more significant when we apply the theorem to smaller groups. The following
section does so, and is our second example application of Cauchy's Theorem.
9.2.1
Classification of groups of order 6
If you did Exercise 4.21 part (c), then you know that there are only two different groups
of order 4. That exercise depends on earlier ones in which you must painstakingly create
all possible four-by-four multiplication tables. In those exercises, the elements are named
0, 1, 2, and 3 because the names are unimportant; it is the structure of the group we care

204
9. Sylow theory
about. The result of these exercises is that any group of order 4 is isomorphic to either
V4 or C4 by a suitable renaming isomorphism.
We say that those exercises \classified groups of order 4 up to isomorphism." Such
work answers the question, \What groups are there with four elements?" The exhaus-
tive, multiplication-table approach to classification becomes unworkably tedious for even
slightly larger groups. The results of this chapter, starting with Cauchy's Theorem, give us
a better way to find out how many groups there are of a given order, and what those groups
are. For small group orders like 6, Cauchy's Theorem is sufficient, as this section shows.
For larger orders we will need stronger tools, which is where the Sylow Theorems come in.
We already know that there are at least two groups of order 6, C6 and S3 (also known
as D3); we will see that there are actually none but these two. I begin by using Cauchy's
Theorem to deduce some essential facts about any group of order 6. Then to find all
groups of order 6, we start exploring using Cayley diagrams that fit those facts. Thus
Cauchy's Theorem gives us a head start on our search, and keeps us from searching down
some dead-end streets.
The head start Cauchy's Theorem gives us is that in any group of order 6, there must
be an element of order 2 and an element of order 3, because those are the two primes
that divide 6. Call those elements a and b, respectively. Therefore we can start drawing
a Cayley diagram for any group of order 6 by drawing a subgroup hai of order 2, like
the top diagram in Figure 9.7. From the identity element in the Cayley diagram, one can
also follow b arrows, which must create an orbit of size 3. Such an orbit contains only
elements of order 3, and thus it does not contain a (which has order 2). So we can safely
extend our diagram to the one on the lower left of Figure 9.7.
The subgroup hbi must have a left coset ahbi, a copy of hbi that does not touch
hbi and contains a. That coset therefore contains two new group elements, as shown in
the lower right image in Figure 9.7. See how much our diagram has grown just from
the seeds Cauchy's Theorem provided! Any Cayley diagram for a group of order 6 must
contain the pattern on the lower right of Figure 9.7. Our search for groups of order 6 is
therefore quickly drawing to an end; we have a nearly complete Cayley diagram already.
One choice remains: How will the a arrows connect the lower four nodes in this
partial diagram? Or more simply, where does an a arrow lead from b? There are only

9.3. p-groups

three other nodes that need an a arrow entering them, b2, ab, and ab2. Each of these
choices can be expressed as an equation involving a and b. For example, an a arrow
connecting b to b2 implies the equation ba D b2. Cancelling b from the left of each side
yields a D b, which we know is not true, so the a arrow from b does not lead to b2. I
consider the remaining two options separately in the following two paragraphs.
If the a arrow from b leads to ab, then ba D ab. This equation determines all
remaining connections in the diagram. The visual reason for this is that Cayley diagrams
must be regular, and so the path ab must equal the path ba throughout the diagram.
We could state the same idea algebraically, by multiplying the equation ba D ab by
various elements on the left, to see where a arrows lead from other nodes. For example,
multiplying by b yields b2a D bab, telling us where the a arrow leads from b2. Either
the visual or algebraic view can be used to complete the diagram, resulting in the diagram
on the left of Figure 9.8. The group is C2  C3, or simply C6.

If the a arrow from b leads to ab2, the equation ba D ab2 results. As in the previous
case, either visual or algebraic means could use this equation to determine all other
connections in the diagram. The Cayley diagram on the right of Figure9.8 results, showing
the group S3.
We have therefore classified groups of order 6. There are only two of them up to
isomorphism; we could also say that there are two \isomorphism classes" of groups
of order 6. This classification tells us not to waste our time imagining any groups of
order 6 besides these two. Trying to contemplate a group of order 6 all of whose non-
identity elements have order 3 is nonsensical, as is imagining a group with class equation
1 C 1 C 2 C 2 D 6. Our classification shows that the laws of group theory forbid such
objects, and permit only the two in Figure 9.8.
9.3
p-groups
Cauchy's Theorem is a partial converse to Lagrange's Theorem, \partial" because it
guarantees the existence of a subgroup only if its order is prime. As we just saw, in small
groups this can be very helpful because the subgroups of prime order make up a large
portion of the group. But in large groups (like our order-200 example), knowing whether
there are larger subgroups would be more helpful. The Sylow Theorems include a more
general converse to Lagrange's Theorem, using p-groups.

206
9. Sylow theory
Definition 9.7 (p-group, p-subgroup). A p-group is a group whose order is a power of
a prime p. A p-group that is a subgroup of G is called, for short, a p-subgroup of G.
For example, D4 is a 2-group, because its order is 8, a power of the prime 2. It
contains a subgroup isomorphic to C4, which is therefore a 2-subgroup of D4 because its
order is 22. Similarly, C1 and C13 are both 13-groups, because their orders are powers of
the prime 13 (specifically, 130 and 131). We finish preparing for the Sylow Theorems by
applying what we know of group actions to p-groups in the following two short results.
Theorem 9.8. If a p-group G acts on a set S, then the order of S and the number of
stable elements in S are congruent mod p.
This theorem is nearly identical to Theorem 9.5. The only change is that the assump-
tion jGj D p has become jGj D pn, making it more general.
Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 9.5, the size of each orbit must divide the order of
G. In this case, only powers of p divide jGj, so the orbits are therefore of various sizes
including 1, p, p2, p3, up to at most pn. So simply modify the illustration for Theorem
9.5 (in Figure 9.4) so that the orbits are any of these various sizes, all powers of p. The
rest of the proof is then the same as for Theorem 9.5.
The following theorem is a bit dense with notation, but the subsequent paragraphs
clarify what it's saying.
Theorem 9.9. If H is a p-subgroup of G, then ÅNG.H/ W HÂ p ÅG W HÂ.
Recall that ÅG W HÂ is the number of left cosets of H in G. Thus the theorem says
that whether we count only those cosets in the normalizer NG.H/ or all the cosets in G,
the result is the same mod p. Another way to state this is that the difference (the number
of cosets outside NG.H/) is a multiple of p.
This theorem is here because the First Sylow Theorem depends on it. But secondarily,
its proof reiterates a valuable proof strategy from Cauchy's Theorem that we will encounter
several times in this chapter. One way to learn how many elements are in a set is to devise
an action of a p-group whose stable elements are just those we wish to count. Then
Theorem 9.5 or Theorem 9.8 can count those elements mod p. In the proof of Cauchy's
Theorem the stable elements were the set P of powers gp; a similar strategy is used here.
Proof. Let S be the left cosets of H in G and consider the group H acting on S by the
interpretation homomorphism  W G ! Perm.S/ defined by
.h/ D the permutation that sends a coset gH to the coset hgH.
Exercise 9.19 asks you to prove that each such .h/ is indeed a permutation. In such
a situation, we say that G acts on S \by left multiplication." This action was chosen
because of the strategy mentioned above; I can prove that its stable elements are just
those left cosets in the normalizer, as shown in Figure 9.9.
Recall that the left cosets of H in NG.H/ are those left cosets that are also right
cosets. Figure 9.10 illustrates and explains why they are also those cosets stabilized by
the above group action. The explanations in that figure are an important part of this proof.
Since the stable elements are those cosets in NG.H/, the number of them is ÅNG.H/ W HÂ.

9. Sylow theory
The final step of the strategy is to apply Theorem 9.8, which tells us that the number
of stable elements must be congruent mod p to jSj, which in this case is the number of
left cosets of H, ÅG W HÂ. Writing this as an equation yields the statement of the theorem,
ÅNG.H/ W HÂ p ÅG W HÂ :
If you wish to pause and gain a better understanding of this theorem, I encourage you
to try Exercise 9.10 now, which asks you to illustrate the group action used in the proof,
for a specific group G and subgroup H.
9.4
Sylow Theorems
The Sylow Theorems give us the following three kinds of information about the p-
subgroups of any group. I state them imprecisely here, just to give some intuition for
what is to come.
Existence: In every group, p-subgroups of all possible sizes are guaranteed to exist.
Relationship: A group's p-subgroups have ties to one another through conjugacy.
Number: There are restrictions on how many p-subgroups a group can have.
This section proves the three Sylow Theorems and shows some of their applications,
including extending our knowledge of the order-200 group A.
9.4.1
The First Sylow Theorem: Existence of p-subgroups
Theorem 9.10 (First Sylow Theorem). If G is a group and pn is the highest power of p
dividing jGj, then there are subgroups of G of every order 1, p, p2, p3, up to pn. Also,
every p-subgroup with fewer than pn elements is inside one of the larger p-subgroups.
The First Sylow Theorem generalizes Cauchy's Theorem in several ways, summarized
in Table 9.2. Its proof deals with both statements in the theorem at once by using Cauchy's
Theorem to expand smaller p-subgroups to create larger ones. The First Sylow Theorem
also tells us a bit about the relationship among p-subgroups, but we will learn more about
that relationship from the Second Sylow Theorem.
Proof. It is easy to find a p-subgroup of order 1 (which is p0) because it is obviously
feg. We also know that there is a p-subgroup of order p (which is p1) from Cauchy's
Cauchy's Theorem (Theorem 9.6)
First Sylow Theorem (Theorem 9.10)
If p divides jGj,
If pi divides jGj,
then there is a subgroup of order p.
then there is a subgroup of order pi.
It is cyclic and has no subgroups.
Each has subgroups of orders 1, p, p2, up to pi.
There is also an element of order p.
There is not necessarily an element of order pi.

Figure 9.11. Theorem 9.10 gives a procedure for taking a subgroup of order pi and finding a
larger subgroup whose order is piC1 (as long as piC1 divides jGj).
Theorem (as long as jGj > 1). The main job of this proof is showing the existence of
the larger subgroups, by explaining how to take any H < G of any order pi < pn and
expand it to create a new subgroup H0 < G that contains H and is p times as large, as
shown in Figure 9.11. We can then repeatedly expand the smallest p-subgroups, creating
larger ones up to size pn.
We can find the H 0 we seek inside the normalizer NG.H/ by relying on the fact that
H CNG.H/. Figure 9.12 illustrates the groups, subgroups, and homomorphism that come
into play in the rest of this proof; refer to it to help visualize the following argument.
Create the quotient group NG.H/

and call the quotient map q. The size of the quotient
group is the number of cosets of H in its normalizer, ÅNG.H/ W HÂ, which Theorem 9.9

says must be congruent to ÅG W HÂ mod p. So what do we know about ÅG W HÂ? We're
given that the order of G is some multiple of pn, say pnm. So the number of cosets of
H is
ÅG W HÂ D jGj
jHj D pnm
pi
D pn im:
Because pi < pn, we know that pn i > 1 and so p divides pn im. Therefore ÅG W HÂ
and ÅNG.H/ W HÂ are both multiples of p.
The order of NG.H/
H
is obviously not 0, so it must be a positive multiple of p. This
lets us use Cauchy's theorem to find an element of order p in the quotient group; call
that element aH. The cyclic subgroup haHi will be very useful to us.
The collection of elements that q maps to haHi obviously contains H, but as Figure
9.12 suggests it is also a subgroup of NG.H/, by Exercise 8.6 part (c). It is the subgroup
H 0 that we seek; it contains H and has size piC1 for the following reason. There are p
elements in haHi, and therefore p cosets of H in H0. Since H contains pi elements,
each of its cosets does as well, and H0 contains p of them, for a total of piC1 elements.
The preceding paragraphs give a way to expand any H of order pi < pn into a larger
H 0 of order piC1. Beginning with H D feg, we can repeatedly expand it to create H0,
H 00, and so on of orders p, p2, up to pn.
The expansion technique in this proof is an example of conjugacy. It applies q to H,
applies Cauchy's theorem in the quotient group to turn one element into p elements, and
applies q 1 to bring those p elements back into G as p cosets forming a subgroup H0.
Even though q 1 isn't really a function, this is a useful way to summarize the argument.
Let's see how much more power this theorem has than Cauchy's Theorem. First, let's
return to the group A from Figure 9.6, of which we assumed only that its order is 200.
Cauchy's Theorem told us that there must therefore be two subgroups of orders 2 and
5, but the First Sylow Theorem tells us much more. Those small, prime-order subgroups
are inside groups of orders 4 and 25 respectively, and the subgroup of order 4 is in one
of order 8. These larger, nested subgroups are shown in Figure 9.13.

We also know that there are no subgroups of order 24 D 16, nor 53 D 125, because
those numbers do not divide 200. But we do not yet know how many subgroups there are
of orders 2, 4, 8, 5, and 25. We know there is at least one of each of these sizes, but we do
not yet know whether there are more. Hence, some questions marks remain in Figure9.6.
9.4.2
Classification of groups of order 8
Cauchy's Theorem helped us classify groups of order 6, because the subgroups it gave
us were a significant portion of the whole group. Because larger numbers may not factor
so helpfully, the First Sylow Theorem becomes valuable in classifying groups of those
orders.
Table 9.3 lists every group of order 1 through 7, and the reason justifying each
of the seven classifications. Four of the seven classifications are based on Exercise6.12,
regarding groups of prime order necessarily being cyclic. Let's extend that table to groups
of order 8. From Exercise 8.44 part (b) you know that there are three abelian groups of
order 8, C2  C2  C2, C2  C4, and C8. The First Sylow Theorem helps simplify the
search for non-abelian groups of order 8, and together these results add another row to
Table 9.3.

Table 9.3. Classification of groups of orders 1 through 7.
The First Sylow Theorem says that in any group of order 8, there will be at least one
subgroup of order 4 (something Cauchy's Theorem could not tell us). From Table 9.3,
we know that such subgroups must be isomorphic to either V4 or C4. If all of them were
isomorphic to V4, then the group would have no elements of order 4, and therefore only
elements of order 2. From Exercise 5.38, we know that such a group must be abelian, and
so we've already counted it (C2  C2  C2). Therefore any non-abelian group of order 8
has a copy of C4 in it.
Let a stand for the generator of this copy of C4, so that we can speak of the subgroup
hai and its one left coset, which together form all eight elements of the group. Call the
coset bhai, for some element b â¦ hai. Just as in the classification of groups of order 6,
our task is to determine the possibilities for how a and b relate, and so determine the
structures possible in non-abelian groups of order 8. We do not yet know the order of b,
though we know it must be 2 or 4. I consider each of these two possibilities. Notice how

groups of order 8. They differ only in that the b arrow in the left diagram has no arrowhead, because
it is of order 2.
much the First Sylow Theorem has helped us; we know that non-abelian groups of order
8 are built from one of two partial Cayley diagrams, those shown in Figure 9.14.
First assume b has order 2, as diagrammed on the left of Figure 9.14. We must decide
where b arrows send the element a. Any such decision can be expressed as an equation
relating a and b, which must then hold throughout the entire diagram. I use a process of
elimination to determine which of the alternatives lead to groups.
The arrow for b cannot send a to the top row of the diagram because there are
already b arrows touching both such elements.
The b arrow cannot send a to the left column, because b â¦ hai.
If the b arrow were to send a to ba, we would have the equation ab D ba, resulting
in an abelian group. We have already listed all abelian groups and are now seeking
only the non-abelian ones.
If the b arrow were to connect a to ba2, we would have the equation ab D ba2.
By regularity, the paths ab and ba2 should lead to the same place no matter where
in the diagram we start. Starting from a, this requires drawing a b arrow from a2
to b. But b already has an incoming b arrow, so we have hit a dead end; we cannot
have ab D ba2.
The only remaining choice is to connect a to ba3, and all other b connections are then
determined by the equation ab D ba3. This creates the Cayley diagram on the left of
Figure 9.15, of the group D4.
We also must investigate the possibilities when b has order 4, as diagrammed on
the right of Figure 9.14. We can determine the relationship between a and b by asking

where the b cycle continues from b. I again apply a process of elimination, this time to
determine which element is b2.
It is not any of the elements in the right column, because b â¦ hai, and so b2 â¦ bhai.
It is not e because that would make jbj D 2, a case we've already considered.
It is not a because if b2 D a, then b has order 8 (twice the order of a), and yields
the group C8, a case that's already done.
It is not a3 because that, too, would make jbj D 8.
Thus our only choice is b2 D a2, an equation that we can use to determine the entire b or-
bit, as shown in Figure 9.16. Regularity requires that we duplicate this pattern of b arrows
when connecting the coset ahbi. The resulting group is Q4, as on the right of Figure 9.15.

Thus there are two non-abelian groups of order 8, D4 and Q4. Together with the
abelian groups C2  C2  C2, C4  C2, and C8, the total number of groups of order 8
is five (up to isomorphism). The First Sylow Theorem helped us in this exploration by
giving us the two partial Cayley diagrams in Figure 9.14 as starting points. As in the
classification of groups of order 6, much fruitless searching was thereby eliminated.
9.4.3
The Second Sylow Theorem: Relationship among p-
subgroups
The First Sylow Theorem guarantees the existence of subgroups of certain sizes, and
what it told us of the relationship among such groups was that all smaller p-subgroups
are inside larger ones. The Second Sylow Theorem shows us how the largest such p-
subgroups relate through conjugacy.
Definition 9.11 (Sylow p-subgroup). We call H a Sylow p-subgroup of G if it is a
p-subgroup whose order is the highest power of p that divides jGj. In other words, H
is a p-subgroup of G that's either the largest one, or tied for it.
Theorem 9.12 (Second Sylow Theorem). Any two Sylow p-subgroups are conjugates.
Before proving this theorem, let me mention some of its important consequences that
may not at first be obvious. Conjugating by any group element creates an isomorphism
from the group to itself called an inner automorphism (Exercise 8.32). Thus when two
subgroups are conjugates (say H D gKg 1), there is an inner automorphism mapping
one to the other (.x/ D gxg 1). Therefore conjugate subgroups are isomorphic.

Figure 9.17. The inner automorphism i maps one Sylow p-subgroup (of order p3) to another,
which therefore has identical internal structure.
The Second Sylow Theorem tells us that all of a group's largest p-subgroups are
one another's conjugates, and so they are all isomorphic to one another. Now recall the
nesting relationship among p-subgroups given by the First Sylow Theorem, so that every
p-subgroup is inside a Sylow p-subgroup. Conjugating any Sylow p-subgroup by any
group element results in a (possibly different) Sylow p-subgroup, with identical internal
structure, as shown in Figure 9.17. Therefore any smaller p-subgroup must have a copy
of itself (one of its conjugates) in every Sylow p-subgroup.
This improves our picture of the group A of order 200, but in a subtle way. We still
do not know whether there are any p-subgroups other than those we saw earlier in Figure
9.13, but if there are, then we know that they must have the same internal structure as
the ones in that figure, and in fact must be their conjugates. Figure 9.18 shows a Sylow
2-subgroup different from the first, yet identical in structure. I draw it in dashed lines
because its existence is not guaranteed by any of the theorems we have seen. Although

Figure 9.18. If the group A from Figure9.13 has more than one Sylow 2-subgroup (for example),
the Second Sylow Theorem tells us that such additional subgroups will be identical in structure to
the first (and conjugate to it).

it appears to intersect the original Sylow 2-subgroup only at the identity, that is just one
possibility. For instance, if hai were a normal subgroup, then it would be conjugate only
to itself, so every Sylow 2-subgroup would contain all of hai.
Proof. I use again the strategy described after the statement of Theorem 9.9. Let S be
the left cosets of some Sylow p-subgroup H < G and have another Sylow p-subgroup
K act on S by left multiplication (as in the proof of Theorem 9.9).
A stable element of this action is a left coset gH for which kgH D gH for every
k 2 K, as in Figure 9.19. The path from g to kg in that figure is g 1kg, which is a
member of H because it starts and ends inside the same copy of H. When this is true
for any k 2 K, we find that all of g 1Kg is in H, and therefore g 1Kg D H, since
they are the same size. Thus if there is even one stable element gH, then H and K are
conjugates and the theorem is true.
Theorem 9.8 tells us that the number of stable elements must be congruent mod p to
jSj, which is ÅG W HÂ. Because H is a Sylow p-subgroup, its order is the highest power
of p dividing jGj. Thus ÅG W HÂ D jGj
jHj is not a multiple of p, and thus it is not zero. So
the number of stable elements must also be nonzero, making K and H conjugates.
Because a conjugate of a subgroup is a subgroup of the same size, any conjugate of a
Sylow p-subgroup will be another Sylow p-subgroup. Thus the Sylow p-subgroups are
not just some of one another's conjugates, but are all of one another's conjugates.
This is noteworthy when there is only one Sylow p-subgroup. Normal subgroups are
those that are unmoved by conjugation (Section 7.5). Thus a Sylow p-subgroup is normal
just when it has no conjugates, which is when it is the only Sylow p-subgroup. Therefore
being able to deduce the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a group helps us label some
of them as normal. The Third Sylow Theorem often helps us do just that. For this reason,
the Second Sylow Theorem is most useful when combined with the third.
9.4.4
The Third Sylow Theorem: Number of p-subgroups
Theorem 9.13 (Third Sylow Theorem). The number n of Sylow p-subgroups of G obeys
the following two restrictions.
n divides jGj
n p 1
This theorem helps us narrow down, just based on a group's order, the possible
number of Sylow p-subgroups that the group can have. It does not always narrow down

216
9. Sylow theory
the possibilities to only one number, but it is often a big improvement over no information
at all. After proving this theorem, I conclude the chapter with two of its applications.
Proof. The first of the two restrictions is the easier to prove. Let H be one of the n Sylow
p-subgroups of G. We know that the set of Sylow p-subgroups is the set of conjugates
of H. Another way to say this is that if G acts on its subgroups by conjugation, then the
set of Sylow p-subgroups is Orb.H/. The size n of that orbit must therefore divide jGj
by Theorem 9.4; this is the first restriction on n.
To see that n is also congruent to 1 mod p, I apply for the last time the proof strategy
used several times already this chapter (from the proof of Theorem 9.9). Let S be the set
of n Sylow p-subgroups, and consider just the subgroup H acting on S by conjugation.
If I can show that the number of stable elements is congruent to 1 mod p, then n must
also be (by Theorem 9.8). I show that there is actually just one stable element, which
obviously must be H.
For a Sylow p-subgroup K to be a stable element means that hKh 1 D K for every
h in H. That is, H is in the normalizer of K. But H and K are also Sylow p-subgroups
of the group NG.K/, and therefore conjugates in that group. Yet since K is normal in
NG.K/, its only conjugate there is itself, meaning that K and H must be the same.
Thus the number of stable elements is 1, and thus n D jSj p 1, the second restriction
stated in the theorem.
Before seeing an extended application of this theorem, let's see how it impacts our
running example of the group A of order 200. The Third Sylow Theorem requires that
the number of Sylow 5-subgroups be a factor of 200 that's congruent to 1 mod 5. The
factors of 200 are
1; 2; 4; 5; 8; 10; 20; 25; 40; 50; 100; and 200;
and you can verify that the only one congruent to 1 mod 5 is the number 1 itself. Thus
there is only one Sylow 5-subgroup, and it must therefore be normal. However, the Third
Sylow Theorem does not narrow down the possible number of Sylow 2-subgroups as
much. That number must be a factor of 200 that's congruent to 1 mod 2, which leaves
three options, 1, 5, and 25. So the Third Sylow Theorem does not give us full information
about the number of Sylow 2-subgroups. Perhaps some additional reasoning would narrow
the number down further, or perhaps not.
The final modification of our running illustration of A is shown in Figure 9.20. It de-
scribes the Sylow 5-subgroup as both unique and normal, but leaves some question marks
near the Sylow 2-subgroup, because its number of conjugates remains undetermined.
This example of the group A has shown us how much information we can glean just
from a group's order. Smaller groups are usually easier to dissect with Sylow Theory
than larger groups, but not always; what matters more is how the group order factors.
For example, classifying groups of order 8 is harder than classifying groups of order 15,
which is our final application of Sylow Theory. The Third Sylow Theorem gives us key
information for shortening the job.
9.4.5
Classifying groups of order 15
Cauchy's Theorem tells us that in any group of order 15, there must be an element a
of order 3 and an element b of order 5. Since no higher powers of 3 or 5 divide 15,

The group A illustrated throughout this chapter must have only one subgroup

immediately tell us how many subgroups there are of order 8.
the subgroups hai and hbi are Sylow 3- and 5-subgroups respectively. The Third Sylow
Theorem tells us that the number of conjugates of hai must be a factor of 15 that's
congruent to 1 mod 3; the only such number is 1, making hai normal. Similar reasoning
shows that hbi must also be unique and normal.
Because hai contains only elements of order 1 or 3 and hbi only elements of order 1
or 5, these subgroups intersect only at the identity. Thus the fact proven in Exercise 8.43
applies, telling us that the group must be isomorphic to hai  hbi, or C3  C5, which
is isomorphic to C15 by Theorem 8.7. Thus there is only one group of order 15 up to
isomorphism, the cyclic one.
We have classified all groups of order 8 or less, as well as those of order 15. In the
exercises, you are asked to extend this work to order 10, and also to try classifying all
groups of a few larger orders (12, 14, and 21). Group Explorer contains a visual library
of all groups of order 40 or less, and the computational software package GAP has a
database of all groups that goes beyond order 1000 [3].
Classifying groups of a given order is the most common use of Sylow Theory. Other
applications arise in the culmination of this book, Chapter 10, which discusses the historic
work of a young Frenchman named Evariste Galois. See Exercise 9.22 for a preview.

Galois theory
This book ends where group theory began. In the nineteenth century, two very young
mathematicians, Neils Abel and Evariste Galois, answered a question about which the
mathematical world had been curious for centuries. It is a question about the central activ-
ity of algebra, solving equations. Galois coined a new term to describe the mathematical
objects that played a central role in his work on this question; he called them groups, and
group theory was born.
But groups are only part of the solution; the work of Abel and Galois also involves
algebraic structures called fields. I touch on field theory in this chapter, but many of its
facts I state without proof; this book is about groups. Part of what makes the material in
this chapter great is that Galois theory is built on a beautiful interplay between groups
and fields, which we will see in Section 10.6. I hope that this final chapter also serves
as a \teaser" for field theory. If field theory piques your interest (or to see the proofs I
omit), I encourage you to study it further; refer to the list of good books I recommend at
the end of this chapter.
Let's begin with the big question that Abel and Galois answered. It's a question from
elementary algebra, about solving the simplest kinds of equations we can write. The next
two sections give all the background, state the big question, and prepare us to appreciate
its solution.
10.1
The big question
One of our first exposures to mathematics as children is counting. The set of counting
numbers f1; 2; 3; : : :g is often called N, the natural numbers.1 Later we learn the basic
operations of arithmetic, starting with addition and subtraction, and then moving up to
multiplication and division. I call these four operations \arithmetic."
As children learn arithmetic, they also learn new kinds of numbers. Although adding
two natural numbers gives another natural number (nothing new), subtracting two natural
1Some prefer to include zero in N, others leave it out. For this chapter, I use N D f1; 2; 3; : ::g.
221

222
10. Galois theory
numbers like 7   7 or 3   6 requires a knowledge of zero and the negative numbers.
Adding and subtracting natural numbers broadens children's horizons to a set of numbers
we know well, the integers, Z. Soon, however, we move beyond Z as well. Although
multiplication does not reach beyond Z, division can. For example, 6  2 is an integer,
but 65 is not. This prompts the introduction of fractions like 6
5, leading to the set of all
rational numbers, Q. This brings us to the first of five key points I emphasize to organize
the background material of this chapter.
Key Point 10.1. To do arithmetic, we need at least the rational numbers.
Figure 10.1 shows the growing number system, from N to Z to Q, required by the
operations of arithmetic. Children who know only how to count live in N. When they
learn to add and subtract, they move up to Z; when they learn to multiply and divide, they
move up to Q. I use diagrams like Figure 10.1 to explain relationships among number
systems throughout this chapter.

Three number systems. The smallest one, the natural numbers, appears at the
bottom. Expanding it (upwards) with addition and subtraction gives the integers, and expanding
that set with multiplication and division gives the rational numbers.
Our knowledge of groups and their operations allows us to explain the expansion of
N to Z in terms of group theory. The set N is not a group under addition, because there
is no identity (zero) and there are no inverses (negative numbers). To find them, we must
expand to Z, which is a group under addition. In that group, negative numbers are the
inverses of positive ones, and so subtraction is not really a new operation, but a particular
use of addition; a   b can be thought of as a added to the inverse of b, as in a C . b/.
Similarly, expanding from Z to Q can be described as generating a group under
multiplication, with one exception. As in Exercise 4.33, zero has no multiplicative inverse,
so we remove it and use the remaining integers as generators. Their multiplicative inverses
are fractions, with which we generate all the rational numbers. Exercise 4.33 used the
notation Q to mean Q without zero, a group under multiplication. Thus on Q we have
two groups, addition on all of Q and multiplication on most of it, Q. This prompts us
to define a new type of algebraic structure.
Definition 10.1 (field). A set S with addition and multiplication operations is a field if
the following three conditions hold.
1. S and its addition operation form an abelian group.
2. Removing the identity element from that group (the zero) leaves a set that, under the
multiplication operation, also forms an abelian group.

10.1. The big question
223
3. Addition and multiplication relate through the distributive law, a.b C c/ D ab C ac.
The rational numbers Q, the real numbers R, and the complex numbers C are all
fields. (See Exercise 10.8.) There are finite fields as well, which have Cayley-diagram-
like visualizations that you can investigate in Exercise 10.29. But finite fields do not enter
into the work of Abel and Galois, so I do not cover them here.
The number systems N and Z are not fields. Although both satisfy the last condition
of Definition 10.1, N does not satisfy either of the other conditions and Z satisfies only
the first. Because arithmetic cannot be done in N or Z, the rest of this chapter works in
Q, as Key Point 10.1 suggests.
So in Q we can do arithmetic, and all that arithmetic is good for, like accounting,
basic physics, and many other quantitative disciplines. From work in these areas, natural
questions arise. How many haircuts must a barber give in a month to break even on the
costs of his shop? What will my monthly payment be on a loan of this much money
over this much time? What is the escape velocity for a rocket with given specifications?
Answering these questions is the business of algebra, building on the foundation of
arithmetic. In algebra, you express a question's requirements in an equation using the
language of arithmetic and an \unknown" (such as x). Then you \solve" the equation for
the unknown quantity. Though notation has changed over time, this kind of mathematical
work has been going on for millenia. So surely mathematicians must know how to solve
every equation of arithmetic by now. But this is not so, and it is the problem that Abel
and Galois addressed.
The question is about the most basic algebraic equations we can write, with only the
operations of arithmetic, rational numbers, and one variable for expressing an unknown
quantity; I always use the variable x. I call this family of equations \equations from
arithmetic." Here is a simple example.
2x C 1 D 0
To \solve" the equation means to find a number that can replace x to make the equation
true. This equation is easy to solve, using the operations of arithmetic on both sides at
once.
subtract 1:
2x D  1
divide by 2:
x D   1
2
But what about more difficult equations from arithmetic? Even this simple family
contains some pretty hairy equations, like this one. (And you can imagine worse!)

But all equations from arithmetic can be simplified dramatically. The above equation, for
instance, simplifies to this one.
x4 C 4x3 C 3157x2   31354x C 31192 D 0
Still tricky to solve, but with two advantages. First, all fractions, parentheses, and nested
expressions have been removed and the equation looks much neater. Second, all equations
of the above form have a centuries-old, proven technique for solving them.

224
10. Galois theory
The left side of the above equation is a polynomial. A polynomial is a list of terms
added together; each term includes a coefficient, an x, and an exponent on the x. Here
are some polynomials, with example terms explained.

We use exponents when writing polynomials, but exponentiation is not really a new oper-
ation; because the exponents will always be nonnegative whole numbers, they are just
shorthand for repeated multiplication.
Polynomials have the general form
anxn C an 1xn 1 C    C a2x2 C a1x C a0;
in which each ai is a coefficient and n is the highest power of x, called the degree of the
polynomial. The degrees of the three example polynomials above are 1, 2, and 8, from left
to right. As those examples indicate, some of the coefficients other than an may be zero.
Exercise 10.4 asks you to prove that any equation from arithmetic simplifies to a
polynomial on one side and zero on the other. To get better acquainted with that fact,
you may wish to try that exercise now. Because of that simplification, a method for
solving equations of a polynomial equal to zero could be used to solve any equation from
arithmetic. This is so important, I stress it as my second key point.
Key Point 10.2. A method for solving an equation of a polynomial equal to zero would
actually solve every equation from arithmetic, because any equation from arithmetic sim-
plifies to that form.
I therefore focus our attention on equations that set a polynomial equal to zero, called
polynomial equations. The solutions to such equations are called roots of the polynomial.
Because our equations come from arithmetic, their coefficients are all rational numbers.
Polynomials of degree 1 (like the one I solved on page223) are called linear polynomials.
Those of degree 2 are called quadratic, and algebra students learn to solve them with the
quadratic formula. It says that any equation ax2CbxCc D 0 has two solutions, expressed
together in the formula
x D  b Ë
p
b2   4ac
2a
:
The quadratic formula has been known since at least as early as the twelfth century.
Although elementary algebra classes usually end their study of polynomial equations with
the quadratic formula, the curiosity of mathematicians does not stop there, especially
given the importance of solving polynomial equations just stated in Key Point 10.2. In
the sixteenth century, Girolamo Cardano published a formula for solving cubic equations,
those made from third-degree polynomials, and therefore having the form
ax3 C bx2 C cx C d D 0:
Although the cubic formula is lengthier than the quadratic formula (filling up several
lines), it doesn't involve any new concepts. It uses only the operations of arithmetic and

10.2. More big questions
225
radical signs, just like the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula involves a square
root and the cubic formula involves both square and cube roots, but both types of roots
are written using radical signs. The quadratic formula finds two solutions, while the cubic
finds three.
And mathematics marches on. In the same century Lodovico Ferrari developed a way
to solve any quartic polynomial equation (fourth degree), and that solution also involves
just the operations of arithmetic and radicals (in his case, sometimes fourth roots). It, too,
is lengthy, but it finds all four solutions to any quartic polynomial equation.
The war on polynomial equations seemed to be going well, but that's where progress
stopped. Although some later mathematicians developed formulas for solving some types
of quintic polynomial equations (fifth degree), no method was found to handle every
quintic. In fact, there were some quintic polynomials, like x5C10x4 2, whose solutions
no one could find. This brings us to the big question I've been building up to since the
first page of this chapter.
Key Point 10.3. The work of Abel and Galois answered this big question: \Is there a
formula for solving fifth degree polynomial equations?"
In 1824, at the age of 22, Neils Abel found a particular quintic polynomial that he
proved could never be solved using only the operations of arithmetic and radicals. It's
not that the equation had no solutions, but rather the operations of arithmetic together
with radicals could not express those solutions. In other words, the language for writing
the solutions for polynomial equations of degrees 1 through 4 is insufficient for writing
the solutions to polynomial equations of degree 5.
It has since become common to call a polynomial \solvable" or \solvable by radicals"
when its roots can be written using the operations of arithmetic and radicals, and \unsolv-
able" or \unsolvable by radicals" otherwise. Shortly after Abel's revelation, the budding
19-year-old prodigy Evariste Galois introduced the subject of group theory to classify ex-
actly which polynomials were solvable by radicals. This chapter is about the role of group
theory in that work. Because all that follows depends on the answer Abel and Galois gave
to the big question, I state their answer again, more fully, as my next key point.
Key Point
10.4. The operations of arithmetic and radicals have been used to write
formulas to solve polynomial equations of degrees 1 through 4, but they cannot be used
to write a \quintic formula," for solving polynomial equations of degree 5.
10.2
More big questions
Figure 10.1 showed us that learning the operations of arithmetic broadens our number
system, first to the integers and then to the rationals. Algebra also broadens our view,
because the fundamental operation of algebra, solving equations, often introduces new
kinds of numbers. Solving a simple linear equation does not result in anything but rational
numbers, as in the example on page 223. But solving a quadratic equation often requires
taking a square root.
Some square roots of rational numbers give other rational numbers, such as

Let's review how Q, R, and C differ.
The rational numbers are those that can be written as a ratio a
b of two whole numbers
a and b (with b Â¤ 0). Another (equivalent) way to define Q is those numbers whose
decimal expansions are either finite or repeating. Many real numbers are in neither of
these two categories, and are therefore irrational. Table 10.1 shows example decimal
expansions inside and outside Q. To move beyond R requires the introduction of the
so-called \imaginary" number i, which satisfies the equation i2 D  1. Just as arithmetic
expands a child's number system from N to Z to Q, so algebra expands students' number
systems from Q to R to C, as illustrated in Figure 10.2. (Technically, solving polynomial
equations cannot generate every element of R, but I come to that shortly.)
The irrational numbers that matter most to the big question are square roots, cube
roots, and other radicals. If we can take square roots then we can use the quadratic
formula to solve any quadratic equation. If we can also take cube roots, we can use the
cubic formula to solve any cubic equation. If we have fourth roots, the quartic formula

will solve any quartic equation. You can see how it would be natural to think that fifth
roots should make it possible to write a formula for solving quintic polynomial equations.
But Abel and Galois's answer to the big question is the opposite. It is at this point|degree
5|that radicals stop being sufficient to solve polynomial equations.
This suggests we view the big question in a new light, as a comparison of the power
of two operations, using radicals and solving polynomial equations. Figure 10.3 shows
these two operations leading from Q, and asks whether their destinations are different.
We can improve that figure in two ways. First, it should be clear that every radical
is a solution to some polynomial equation; any
npa is a solution to xn   a D 0. So I
should redraw Figure 10.3 to indicate that the unknown field on the top left is contained
in the unknown field on the top right. Second, some real and complex numbers are not
the solution to any algebraic equation; such numbers are called transcendental, and those
that are solutions to polynomial equations are called algebraic. The numbers  and e are
well-known transcendental numbers. So we know that neither of the unknown fields in
Figure 10.3 is all of R or C. Figure 10.4 is a more accurate version, in which A stands
for the algebraic numbers.
Figure 10.4 helps us phrase the big question in terms of the relative power of two
basic operations. Does introducing radicals reach as far beyond Q as solving polynomials
does? Or, can polynomials be solved using just arithmetic and radicals? The big question
is about the relationship between these two fundamental mathematical activities.

10. Galois theory
Phrasing the big question this way shows its similarity to other big mathematical
questions, hence the title of this section. There are three famous questions that the ancient
Greeks asked in the field of geometry. Can the basic operations of geometry, performed
with a ruler and compass, be used to square a circle, double a cube, or trisect an angle?
You can see their similarity to our big question; each is a question of how far certain
operations can reach. These three questions can also be answered using Galois theory,
due to the tight relationship between algebra and geometry. This is my final key point.
Key Point 10.5. Galois Theory is useful when analyzing operations that reach out from
Q to new fields. Our big question can be answered using Galois theory, as can other
historical questions in mathematics.
I mention these geometric questions to show that Galois theory has power beyond
the one question I cover in this chapter. Readers interested in the application of Galois
theory to geometric problems can refer to sources such as [11] and Chapter 13 of [1].
This completes the background material, and we can now dig into the work that answered
the big question.
10.3
Visualizing field extensions
Two kinds of diagrams will play an important role in this chapter. I use diagrams like
Figure 10.4 to illustrate and compare operations that reach outside Q. They are actually
a kind of Hasse diagram. In Section 6.6.3 we used Hasse diagrams to illustrate the
relationships among a group's subgroups. Vertical lines connected smaller subgroups
(lower in the diagram) up to larger ones (higher in the diagram) in which they were
contained. Now I use Hasse diagrams to show the relationships among fields that extend
Q, and vertical or diagonal lines still indicate containment.
The second visualization technique important in this chapter is based on the fact that
all polynomials whose coefficients are in C have all their roots in C as well. For this
reason C is called an algebraically closed field, meaning that the operation of solving
equations never reaches outside it. Thus all the numbers and fields in this chapter are
inside C, and a way to visualize the field C would enable us to visualize any of those
numbers and fields.
Exercise 10.8 guides you through proving that any complex number can be written as
a C bi for some real numbers a and b. Here are some complex numbers in this form.

Because complex numbers have this two-part structure, we use points in the familiar
two-dimensional coordinate plane to represent complex numbers, plotting a C bi at the
point .a; b/. Figure 10.5 shows where some example complex numbers lie on the complex
plane. Take a moment to verify your understanding of this visualization technique, since
many future figures depend on it. Notice that the x axis is the real number line.
We can use graphs like Figure 10.5 to visualize the solutions to polynomial equations,
putting all of a polynomial's roots together on one graph. Figure10.6 shows four examples,
a graph for each of four different polynomials. See if you can spot any patterns in Figure
10.6. One interesting thing to notice is that whether a polynomial is solvable is not

related to how complicated it looks on paper. I stated earlier that the deceptively simple
polynomial x5 C 10x4   2 is unsolvable, yet the lengthy quintic on the bottom right of
Figure 10.6 is solvable, and all its solutions are listed there.
But a more important pattern you may have spotted is that the root sets in Figure 10.6
have some symmetry. Each is a mirror reflection of itself over the x axis, and a vertical
flip would therefore respect the shape of the root set. Seeing symmetry in polynomial root
sets is the first step in Galois theory. The following definition will help us prove that this
mirror symmetry appears in the root set of any polynomial.
Definition 10.2 (complex conjugate). For any complex number a C bi, we call a   bi
its complex conjugate (or sometimes just its conjugate, for short). If c is any complex
number, we write c to mean its complex conjugate.
For example, 1 C i and 1   i are conjugates, so we could write 1 C i D 1   i. And if

Complex conjugation negates the imaginary part only, and is therefore the vertically
flipped version of the original point. Real numbers are their own complex conjugates, for
example 6 D 6 and 0 D 0.
Theorem 10.3 (Complex Conjugate Root Theorem). If r is a root of a polynomial, then
its conjugate r is a root of the same polynomial. Therefore every polynomial's root set
has mirror symmetry over the x axis of the complex plane.

.a C bi/ C .c C di/ D a C bi C c C di
This is not very hard to prove; applying Definition 10.2 and some simple algebra shows
that the two sides of this rule are equal.
.a C bi/ C .c C di/ D .a C c/ C .b C d/i D .a C c/   .b C d/i

Applying the rule simplifies the original polynomial equation a bit.
anrn C an 1rn 1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0 D 0
Each term in this sum is a conjugate of two multiplied expressions, an ai and an ri.
So to simplify further, I would like to split the conjugation over the two terms in each
multiplication, using a rule like this one.
.a C bi/.c C di/ D .a C bi/.c C di/
Exercise 10.5 asks you to prove this rule, and I apply it here without proving it.
an rn C an 1 rn 1 C    C a2 r2 C a1 r C a0 D 0
Because each coefficient ai is a real number, it is its own conjugate, so the equation
simplifies even further.
anrn C an 1rn 1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0 D 0
Finally, natural number exponents just mean repeated multiplication, so the multiplication
rule used earlier allows me to split up powers as well.
anrn C an 1rn 1 C    C a2r2 C a1r C a0 D 0:
This last equation shows what I set out to prove, that r is a root of the same polynomial.
This symmetry of root sets can also be expressed using group actions (as defined in
Definition 9.1). The above theorem tells us that the group C2 acts on any polynomial
root set S via the homomorphism  W C2 ! Perm.S/, with  .1/ being the permutation
that sends each root r to r. This is only the beginning of the symmetries we will find
in root sets, and such symmetries are the foundation of Galois theory. To find other such
symmetries, we will need to get acquainted with the concept of irreducible polynomials.
10.4
Irreducible polynomials
One of the first techniques algebra students learn for solving polynomial equations is
factoring. For example, we do not need to resort to the quadratic formula to solve the
following equation; we can factor instead.
x2   x   6 D 0

232
10. Galois theory
.x   3/.x C 2/ D 0
x   3 D 0
or
x C 2 D 0
x D 3
or
x D  2
Factoring is breaking a larger-degree polynomial down into smaller-degree polynomials
multiplied together; they are the factors, and they are easier to solve because they're
smaller. In this case the factors are linear polynomials, which are very easy to solve. If
we had known the two roots 3 and  2 beforehand, they would have told us how to factor
the polynomial, because a quadratic with roots a and b factors as .x   a/.x   b/.
In general, if we know how to find even one rational root r of any polynomial, then
we can factor the linear polynomial .x   r/ out of the original. For example, take the
cubic polynomial
12x3   44x2 C 35x C 17
from Figure 10.6; one of whose roots is  1
3. We can factor out the corresponding linear
polynomial .x C 1
3/, which has   1
3 as a root. To stick with integer coefficients, we could
use .3x C 1/, which has the same root. Factoring can be done by polynomial division,
which you can learn from Exercise 10.6, and yields
.3x C 1/.4x2   16x C 17/:
The quadratic factor cannot be factored further (into two linear polynomials) because its
roots are not rational and we are only considering polynomials with rational coefficients.
We could factor it if we allowed complex coefficients; its roots are 2Ë 1
2i, so it factors as
 x    2 C 1
2i  x    2   1
2i :
Because 4x2   16x C 17 cannot be factored into polynomials with rational coefficients,
we call it irreducible, or more specifically irreducible over Q.
Irreducible polynomials are of interest to us precisely because they are the polynomials
whose roots are outside of Q. If a polynomial can be factored into linear factors over Q,
like the first example in this section, then its roots are part of that factoring and must
therefore be in Q. Solving such a polynomial does not require expanding our number
system beyond Q. If a polynomial cannot be factored at all, then none of its roots are
in Q, and solving it requires expanding to some number system that contains the roots.
Then of course there are polynomials in between these two extremes, like the one we just
considered; one of its roots was in Q, but to find the other two we had to move outside Q.
For polynomial roots outside Q, we need new notation (besides just arithmetic and
natural numbers) to write them down. Thus the radical sign was invented. There is no
rational number solution to x2   2 D 0, and so mathematicians created a new symbol,
p
2, and adopted the convention that that symbol stands for the number whose square is
2, the solution to the equation x2   2 D 0.
Of course then whenever we encounter any irreducible polynomial x2 a (for a > 0 in
Q) we express its root as pa. And the root of any irreducible xn a, for any integer n > 1,
we write as
npa, which allows cube roots, fourth roots, and so on.2 Radicals represent
solutions to this particular family of irreducible polynomials, xn   a, for a > 0 in Q.
2Polynomials like xn   a have n roots, but only one of them is a positive real number. That is the one we
express as
npa. For more details on this ambiguity (and what the other roots look like), try Exercise10.17.

10.5. Galois groups
233
Combining radicals with the other field operations, we can express solutions to equa-
tions outside that family as well. We've seen that the quadratic formula combines one
radical with several arithmetic operations to solve any second-degree polynomial equation.
Although we haven't looked at the formulas for solving cubic and quartic equations, they,
too, are only arithmetic operations and radical signs (though they are large expressions!).
So the new notation
npa has more power than just solving xn D a; in fact, combined
with the existing arithmetic operations, it has been used to create formulas for solutions
to all polynomials up to degree 4!
But we begin to see the problem that causes the quintic to be unsolvable. This handy
npa notation was invented only to solve some irreducible polynomials, and thus we should
not be surprised if it is not enough to solve all irreducible polynomials. In fact, perhaps
the surprise should be that it can be used to solve all polynomials of degrees 1 through 4!
This is what Figure 10.4 represents; we know that what we can reach by adding radicals
to Q is part of A, but it is not surprising that radicals are not enough to reach all of A.
Since irreducible polynomials play such an important role, we will want to be able to
tell when a polynomial is irreducible. There is not an easy method that works all the time,
but the following theorem helps. It is the first of several facts outside of group theory
that I introduce without proof.3
Theorem
10.4 (Eisenstein Criterion). A polynomial with integer coefficients is irre-
ducible if we can find a prime number p that satisfies both of the following requirements.
1. The coefficient of the highest power of x is not a multiple of p, but all the other
coefficients are.
2. The constant term (the term without an x) is not a multiple of p 2.
For example, the theorem says that the following polynomial is irreducible, using the
prime p D 2.

Galois groups
Now comes the real meat of the chapter, where I use both irreducible polynomials and
group theory to analyze operations like radicals that reach outside Q. Such operations
are called field extensions, and we have already seen in Theorem 10.3 that they have
symmetry, which group theory can describe.
3 Mathematical texts do not usually state results without proving them. But my purpose with this theorem and
those that follow is not to convince you that they are true, but to show you the beautiful theory they create. If
you are curious about the proofs, as I hope you are, refer to the books I recommend at the end of the chapter.

10. Galois theory
We study polynomial roots (and their symmetries) by examining what it is like to
extend Q just enough to contain one polynomial's roots. I begin with a simple example,
x2 2, whose two roots are Ë
p
2. Once we understand the operation of adding one radical
to Q (in this case
p
2), I move on to adding more than one radical (Section10.5.4), then
adding radicals that are not square roots (Section 10.5.5). I then show how Galois proved
powerful and beautiful facts about these symmetries.
10.5.1
A small field extension, Q.
p
2/
How far beyond Q must I expand my view to solve x2   2 D 0? It is not enough to add
the single number
p
2; I want the result to be a number system capable of arithmetic, a
field. Furthermore, I want it to be the smallest field outside Q that contains
p
2, because
I want to know just how far I am forced to reach to solve x2  2 D 0. We call such a field
Q.
p
2/; it includes Q,
p
2, and all numbers obtainable from
p
2 using the operations of
arithmetic. For example, all of the following numbers are in Q.

Even so, every element of Q.
p
2/ can be written compactly. Although some of those
shown above look not-so-compact (and we could imagine huge expressions involving lots
of natural numbers, arithmetic, and
p
2), they all simplify to a rather small form. For
example, expanding the cube
p

and combining like terms (remembering that

Exercise 10.9 covers tricks for simplifying other expressions from Q.
p
2/; curious readers
may wish to try that exercise now. The result is that any element of Q.
p
2/ can be
simplified to the two-term form a C b
p
2 for some a; b 2 Q. Thus Q.
p
2/ is rather like
C, whose elements have the two-term form a C bi, with a; b 2 R.
The number of terms in the expression for a general element of an extension field is
called the degree of the extension. We write
h
Q.
p
2/ W Q
i
to mean the degree of Q.
p
2/
as an extension of Q, so
h
Q.
p
2/ W Q

D 2. Though I did not need it for this example, the
following theorem will prove useful in determining the degree of other (larger) extensions.
Exercise 10.12 asks you to do a portion of its proof.
Theorem
10.5. The degree of an extension Q.r/ always matches the degree of the
irreducible polynomial to which r is a root.
For example, Q.
p
2/ is a degree-2 extension and
p
2 is a root of the degree-2 irre-
ducible polynomial x2   2.
Extension fields are not easy to visualize directly. On a graph of the complex plane,
both Q and Q.
p
2/ look just like R, the x axis. So rather than visualize field extensions
themselves in the complex plane, I return to Hasse diagrams and depict relationships
among fields. Figure 10.7 shows Q.
p
2/ as larger than Q, but smaller than R.

The fact that Q.
p

Q.
p
2/. Although adding
p
2 to Q required adding many irrational numbers besides just
p
2, it did not require adding every irrational number. For example,
p
3 is not in Q.
p
2/,
as you already know if you have tried Exercise 10.9. Now that we know what Q.
p
2/
contains, let's see how Galois theory can show us its symmetry.
10.5.2
The symmetries of Q.
p
2/
In the polynomial root sets of Figure 10.6, the vertical mirror symmetry of complex
conjugation is visually evident. But since we are not visualizing Q.
p
2/ in the complex
plane, how can we measure its symmetries? More to the point, what do we mean by
\symmetry" in this case?
In Chapter 3, I said that an object has symmetry when it looks the same from two
different points of view. In the case of Q.
p
2/, we cannot speak of points of view, because
we have no way to look at the field with our eyes. So in place of our \eyes" we use
arithmetic, the field Q. Any two roots that can't be distinguished using equations of
arithmetic we will say \look the same" to us. More specifically, we're interested in those
ways that the roots of a polynomial can be rearranged without making any true equations
of arithmetic become false, or vice versa.
Let me show you what I mean. The polynomial x2   2 has two roots, Ë
p
2, so we
seek an action of some group G on the roots,  W G ! Perm.f
p
2;  p
2g/. Because the
group Perm.f
p
2;  p
2g/ has only two elements, our task is simple; either the roots are
interchangeable, in which case G is C2 and  is an isomorphism, or they aren't, in which
case G is the trivial group (no symmetry). The group G is therefore the symmetries of the
polynomial's roots, and is called the Galois group of the polynomial. Here is a precise
definition.
Definition 10.6 (Galois group). If r1 through rn are the roots of a polynomial and we
specify an action of G on them by an embedding  W G ! Perm.fr1; : : : ; rng/ whose
image is exactly those permutations undetectable by equations of arithmetic, then G is
the Galois group of the polynomial.
The question is therefore this: Can we use equations of arithmetic to tell the roots Ë
p
2
apart? If we can, then they are not interchangeable and these roots have no symmetry.
Otherwise, they are interchangeable, and the roots have a small amount of symmetry (but
as much symmetry as you can expect from two things|they can be swapped). Since

236
10. Galois theory
arithmetic does not include the square root symbol, I will need to call the roots r1 and r2
in order to be able to mention them in an equation of arithmetic.
We might try to force r1 D
p
2 and r2 D  p
2 using the equation r1 D r2 C 2
p
2.
This would certainly distinguish one root from the other, but unfortunately it cheats
by including the symbol
p
2, so it's not an equation from Q. Sticking to equations of
arithmetic allows true statements like r1r2 D  2, but this equation fails to distinguish
the two roots. You could assign the values Ë
p
2 to r1 and r2 in either order and this
equation would remain true. The equation r1 C r2 D 0 has the same problem; it is an
equation from arithmetic, but doesn't tell the roots apart.
Try as I may, I will never find any way to distinguish the roots of x2   2 using
only equations of arithmetic. (A theorem supporting this appears in Section 10.5.4.) The
two roots \look the same" from Q's point of view. The group G of symmetries of this
polynomial's roots is isomorphic to C2, because the two roots are interchangeable as far
as Q is concerned. The action  .1/ interchanges the two roots.
10.5.3
Symmetries of field extensions
This symmetry extends beyond just the roots themselves, to all of Q.
p
2/, because Q.
p
2/
is generated by those roots. All elements of the field Q.
p
2/ are of the form a C b
p
2,
so interchanging Ë
p
2 turns any element a C b
p
2 into a   b
p
2. Because we're only
rearranging the roots, the elements and operations of Q are left unmoved. Mapping a C
b
p
2 to a   b
p
2 interchanges Ë
p
2, but leaves a and b unchanged, and if we think of
a b
p
2 as aC b. p
2/, we see that the addition was also unaltered. Any rearrangement
of a polynomial's roots can be expanded to a symmetry of the whole extension field of Q
generated by those roots, one that leaves elements and operations of Q unaltered. Galois
theory is a study of the symmetries both of roots and of their field extensions.
In Chapter 8, I called ways to rearrange the elements of a group while respecting
its operation automorphisms of the group. So we call ways to rearrange a field while
respecting its operations field automorphisms. If  W Q.
p
2/ ! Q.
p
2/ is the above
example, .a C b
p
2/ D a  b
p
2, then it does respect the operations of Q, by satisfying
the following two equations for any a and b in Q.
p
2/. (See Exercise 10.15.)
.a C b/ D .a/ C .b/
.a  b/ D .a/  .b/
Beyond being a field automorphism,  also keeps every element of Q unmoved. Like all
symmetries we'll study in polynomial roots, it only rearranges numbers outside Q. We
say that  leaves Q fixed, or  fixes Q.
Complex conjugation is another field automorphism that fixes Q. (Recall Theorem
10.3.) Note how similar complex conjugation is to the map ; it maps a C bi to a   bi.
Figure 10.8 illustrates complex conjugation in two ways, on the left as a permutation
of the roots of a polynomial, and on the right as a field automorphism. Both ways of
thinking of the action have natural visualizations, as shown.
But not all field automorphisms are easy to draw in the complex plane. For example,
the permutation interchanging the roots Ë
p
2 is easy to draw, as in Figure 10.9, but
the corresponding automorphism  of Q.
p
2/ cannot be drawn clearly. The reason is
that  does not keep numbers near one another. For example, it maps
p
2 to  p
2, but

Complex conjugation acts on the roots of
12x3   44x2 C 35x C 17 by this
permutation.
Complex conjugation is an automorphism
of C that can be shown as a vertical flip
over the x axis.
Figure 10.8. Complex conjugation depicted in two ways, on the left as a permutation of the
roots of a specific polynomial (12x3   44x2 C 35x C 17 from Figure 10.6), and on the right as an
automorphism of C that fixes R (and therefore Q).
the rational number 7
5, which is near to
p
2, is kept fixed. This same problem occurs
all along the x axis, and so no simple geometric operation like the flip of Figure 10.8
suffices to represent . For this reason, I primarily speak of polynomial root symmetries
as permutations of the roots, as in Definition 10.6, and I illustrate them as in Figure 10.9.
Galois theory is about computing and using these groups of symmetries. We computed
C2 as the Galois group of x2   2, and the homomorphism  W C2 ! Perm.f
p
2;  p
2g/
defining the action is an isomorphism. It is common to use the term \Galois group"

loosely, and sometimes refer to the image of  (a group of permutations) as the Galois
group, or refer to the corresponding group of automorphisms as the Galois group. These
three groups are isomorphic (since  is an embedding), so this bit of imprecision does
no harm.
In Section 10.6, we'll use a polynomial's Galois group to determine that polynomial's
solvability by radicals. But first, let's get a better feel for Galois groups by computing
two more.

I stated earlier that
p

p

p

extending the field Q, but the field Q.

Because
p
3 is a root of a degree-2 polynomial, we might expect that this is a degree-2
extension of Q.
p
2/. This means it should contain elements of the form a C b
p
3, with
a and b coming from Q.
p
2/ rather than from Q (that is, each of a and b is a two-term
c C d
p

elements of Q.
p

This theorem is best shown in a diagram like Figure 10.10. On the bottom is the field

Theorem
10.8. Take any polynomial irreducible over Q and any two of its roots,

1. There is an isomorphism  W Q.r1/ ! Q.r2/ that replaces every r1 with r2, but fixes
Q. For example, in a degree-2 extension,  would look like this.
.a C br1/ D a C br2
2. This remains true if Q is replaced with any field between Q and C.
This theorem is best understood in action. Let's take stock of the irreducible poly-
nomials in our current situation. The irreducible polynomial for
p

irreducible polynomial for
p
3 is x2   3. These two polynomials together have the four

Theorem 10.8, which helped us find this Galois group, raises the importance of ir-
reducible polynomials. By saying that there is an automorphism sending any root of an
irreducible polynomial to any other, it says that Q can't tell apart the roots of an irre-
ducible polynomial. In other words, setting an irreducible polynomial equal to zero is the
most specific statement we can make in the language of Q about that polynomial's roots.

Therefore Q.r1/ does not contain the roots r2 or r3, because Q.

the degree-2 cases we have seen, in which adding one root of an irreducible polynomial
automatically added the other. To include all the roots of x3   2 requires another field
extension. I leave some of its details for Exercise10.18, in which you are asked to verify
that

from r1, r2, and r3 using the operations of arithmetic. This is clear from the six-term
form above, which can yield

3i by letting all coefficients but d equal zero. Therefore
Q.

When an extension includes all the roots of an irreducible polynomial, we call it a
normal extension. Thus Q.r1/ is not normal, but Q.r1; r2; r3/ is. As we compute the
Galois group of this normal extension, we have the following useful theorem.

Theorem 10.9. The degree of a normal extension equals the order of its Galois group.
This theorem makes it easier to compute the Galois group of Q.r1; r2; r3/. Because
there are three roots, the Galois group (which permutes those roots) must be isomorphic
to some subgroup of S3. Theorem 10.9 says that the order of the Galois group must
match the degree of the extension, 6, and so we conclude that it must be all of S3. The
homomorphism  W S3 ! Perm.fr1; r2; r3g/ specifying how this Galois group acts on
the roots is an isomorphism. I illustrate its action in Figure 10.16.

This completes our tour of Galois groups. Now it is time to see the use to which
Galois put these tools, determining which polynomials are solvable. The following section
introduces the two central theorems of Galois theory that help us prove that there is no
formula for solving quintic polynomials by radicals.
10.6
The heart of Galois theory
Figure 10.15 is a Hasse diagram, showing relationships among field extensions of Q. We
first encountered Hasse diagrams in Section 6.6.3, when showing relationships among
subgroups. Take a moment to compare the Hasse diagram in Figure10.15 with the Hasse
diagram of the subgroups of its Galois group, S3, in Exercise 6.22 on page 112. What
relationships do you see?
The two Hasse diagrams (one of subgroups and one of field extensions) are identical
in shape, except that one of them is upside down. Applying a vertical flip to either the
field extension diagram or the subgroup diagram makes the two look identical. Will the
symmetry never stop! This same symmetry holds for the Galois group V4 that we computed
in Section 10.5.4, whose field extension diagram is in Figure 10.11. The Hasse diagram
for subgroups of V4 is in the solution to Exercise 6.23, on page 270. The vertical mirror
symmetry still holds in this case, but is a bit redundant because each Hasse diagram itself
has vertical mirror symmetry. This vertical mirror symmetry brings us to a key theorem
from Galois's work.
Theorem 10.10 (mirror theorem). The following two facts are true for any polynomial
with roots r1; r2; : : : ; rn and Galois group G.

The vertical mirror image symmetry from Theorem 10.10 illustrated. Each
subgroup of S3 is the reflection of an extension field of Q, but not just any extension field|the
field fixed by that subgroup of automorphisms.
1. The Hasse diagram for the subgroups of G becomes identical to the Hasse diagram
of the extension fields between Q and Q.r1; : : : ; rn/ if you flip it vertically.
2. Each subgroup H < G is not only the reflection of an extension field of Q, but it is
the reflection of the exact field that the automorphisms in H hold fixed.
The second part of Theorem 10.10 requires some explanation; I exemplify it in Figure
10.17. It tells us that the symmetry of the two Hasse diagrams is not superficial, but
meaningful. We don't use groups to measure the symmetry in field extensions just because
mathematicians like patterns, but because those patterns say something about the field
extensions. In fact, the Galois group can tell us everything we need to know about the
field extension. Galois groups aren't just pretty patterns; they answer the big question.
One final theorem shows us how.
Theorem 10.11. A field extension contains only elements expressible by radicals if and
only if the following criterion holds about its Galois group G.

10.6. The heart of Galois theory
245
There is a chain of subgroups from feg up to G, each one normal in the next,
feg C N1 C N2 C    C Nn C G;
and each quotient along the chain is abelian.
N1
feg
N2
N1
N3
N2
  
G
Nn
Although this may seem like a strange condition, a few remarks may make it more
intuitive. First, it talks about a chain of subgroups between feg and G, which forms a path
through a Hasse diagram of the subgroups of G, one that corresponds (by Theorem10.10)
to a chain of field extensions between Q and the field in question. Theorem 10.11 also
requires the steps along the chain to be simple ones, from a subgroup to another in which
it is normal, and the quotient abelian. The theorem says that putting such a requirement
on the Galois group translates to an analogous requirement on the field extensions; they
cannot be too complex either. Specifically, the theorem guarantees that the corresponding
field extensions only add numbers expressible by radicals.
Because of the connection to polynomials, we call groups that fit the criteria of
Theorem 10.11 solvable groups. Any abelian group G is solvable, because the tiny chain
feg C G satisfies Theorem 10.11;
G
feg is abelian. Also, we've computed the Galois groups
of two solvable polynomials already. So we expect both those groups (V4 and S3) to be
solvable. The group V4 is solvable because it is abelian. The group S3 has a normal sub-
group hri that is abelian, so the following chain of normal subgroups shows its solvability.
feg C hri C S3
Both quotients hri
feg Å  C3 and S3
hri Å  C2 are abelian groups. In Figure 10.18 I highlight
this chain of subgroups as a path through the Hasse diagram of subgroups of S3, and
label the corresponding quotients. The same evidence can be visualized in greater detail
using homomorphisms, as in Figure 10.19, which shows the embedding of feg into hri
and the corresponding abelian quotient hri
feg, as well as the embedding of hri into S3 and
the corresponding abelian quotient S3
hri.

The solvability of the smallest group requiring a three-step chain of normal
subgroups between feg and the full group of order 24. I name the subgroups by groups to which
they are isomorphic, rather than define G in terms of generators. The chain feg C C2 C Q4 C G
does not include a subgroup isomorphic to V4, but passes directly from C2 to Q4.

10.7. Unsolvability
247
The solvability of larger groups sometimes requires a longer chain of subgroups, but
the smallest such group is of order 24. The corresponding diagram of homomorphisms is
too tangled to be enlightening, but the path through the Hasse diagram appears in Figure
10.20. In fact, solvable groups are actually very common; it's the unsolvable ones that
are hard to find. And that's what's left to do.
Armed with Galois's classification of which polynomials are solvable, we need to
do what Abel did, find one specific unsolvable quintic polynomial. We need a quintic
polynomial with roots r1 through r5 such that the Galois group of Q.r1; : : : ; r5/ is not
solvable. This is a job that requires mostly group theory, so let's leverage our knowledge
of group theory to see how this story ends.
10.7
Unsolvability
We need an unsolvable group that describes the symmetries among the roots of some
quintic polynomial. Those symmetries will form a subgroup of S5, because we can view
them as permutations of the five roots. A systematic search through S5 yields many
subgroups, and Exercise 10.26 asks you to show that all of them are solvable, except one.
The smallest non-solvable group is one with no normal subgroups at all, A5.
10.7.1
An unsolvable group
In Section 7.5, analyzing the conjugacy classes of A4 revealed its only normal subgroup.
I now analyze the conjugacy classes of A5 to show that it has no normal subgroups.
We learned in Chapter 5 that A5 has order 60, so we seek a class equation with 60 on
the left and a sum of sizes of conjugacy classes on the right. Knowing that the identity
element is in a conjugacy class by itself, we begin with this equation.
1 C [some partition of the other 59 elements] D 60
Figures 5.26 and 5.29 showed that A5 is the group of symmetries of the icosahedron and
the dodecahedron. I use the symmetries of the icosahedron to provide the words and images
for describing conjugacy classes in A5 (though the dodecahedron would work just as well).
The icosahedron permits a one-fifth clockwise turn around any one vertex, as shown
in Figure 10.21. (To be specific, the axis of rotation is the line through the vertex and
the icosahedron's center.) The icosahedron has 12 vertices, so there are 12 such rotations.
Figure 10.21. The icosahedron permits a one-fifth turn about any vertex.

248
10. Galois theory
They are conjugate to one another just as are the rotations of the tetrahedron, illustrated
in Figure 7.33. I do not make a similar illustration here to prove it, because it would
involve labeling all the icosahedron's vertices. It should be clear that the simple idea in
Figure 7.33 can be transferred to the icosahedron. This updates our class equation with a
conjugacy class of order 12.
1 C 12 C [some partition of the other 47 elements] D 60
Another 12 elements can be found by considering the squares of the same one-fifth
turns, which are therefore two-fifths turns. They are all conjugate for the same reason
that the one-fifth turns are, bringing the class equation to
1 C 12 C 12 C [some partition of the other 35 elements] D 60:
But considering the cubes of the one-fifth turns (the three-fifths turns) produces no
new elements. A three-fifths clockwise turn is a two-fifths counterclockwise turn, and
so a three-fifths turn about a vertex is the same as a two-fifths turn about the vertex on
the opposite side of the icosahedron. Similarly, a four-fifths turn is just a one-fifth turn
about the opposite vertex. So all the actions that involve rotating around a vertex have
been counted in the two 12-element conjugacy classes.
The icosahedron also permits rotations about the center of each face, as shown in Fig-
ure 10.22. The axis of rotation is the line through the face's center and the icosahedron's
center. Each of these one-third clockwise turns is another element of A5, and they are
all conjugates for the same reason that the one-fifth turns were. The icosahedron has 20
faces, giving a new conjugacy class of 20 elements, and updating our class equation to
1 C 12 C 12 C 20 C [some partition of the other 15 elements] D 60:
Since we have only 15 elements left to classify, clearly the two-thirds turns of each face
do not form another 20-element conjugacy class. This is because a two-thirds turn is the
same as a one-third turn of the opposite face, so we have already counted them.
The icosahedron allows a one-half turn about the axis through the center of any edge
and the icosahedron's center, as shown in Figure 10.23. However, a one-half turn about
any edge is the same as a one-half turn about the opposite edge, so the 30 edges yield only
15 distinct group elements. These elements are conjugates, making the final class equation
1 C 12 C 12 C 20 C 15 D 60:
I use this class equation to show that A5 has no normal subgroups.
Figure 10.22. The icosahedron permits
a one-third turn of any face.
Figure 10.23. The icosahedron permits
a one-half turn that flips any edge.

10.7. Unsolvability
249
A normal subgroup's order must be a sum of sizes of conjugacy classes. Furthermore,
we must ensure that the identity element is present if we hope to form a subgroup. Thus
the only sizes achievable are these.
All classes, the whole group
Four conjugacy classes
1 C 12 C 12 C 15 C 20 D 60
1 C 12 C 15 C 20 D 48
1 C 12 C 12 C 20 D 45
1 C 12 C 12 C 15 D 40
Three conjugacy classes
Two conjugacy classes
One conjugacy class
1 C 15 C 20 D 36
1 C 20 D 21
1 D 1
1 C 12 C 20 D 33
1 C 15 D 16
1 C 12 C 15 D 28
1 C 12 D 13
1 C 12 C 12 D 25
But most of these totals do not describe subgroups, because they do not divide the order
of the group, which is 60. The only totals from this list dividing 60 are 1 and 60, the
normal subgroups feg and A5, which we knew were there before we began. Thus no
other normal subgroups exist.
The only chain of normal subgroups between feg and A5 is therefore the short one
feg C A5, which does not meet the requirement that A5
feg be abelian. The group A5 is
not solvable. Furthermore, no group containing A5 can be solvable, because the smallest
first step in any chain of normal subgroups in such a group would be the invalid step
feg C A5. Thus S5, S6, S7, and so on are all unsolvable groups.
10.7.2
An unsolvable polynomial
Our question narrows to this: Does any quintic polynomial have roots whose Galois group
contains A5? I have already claimed that this is so for the polynomial x5 C 10x4   2.
From my analysis of this polynomial, you will see that it is easy to create others like it,
and Exercise 10.28 gives you the opportunity to do so. Let's see why x5 C 10x4   2 is
unsolvable.
It is irreducible by the Eisenstein Criterion (Theorem 10.4), using p D 2. Call its
five roots r1 through r5. Then Q.r1/ is a degree-5 extension because the polynomial has
degree 5. Perhaps it is a normal extension, and equal to the field Q.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/, or
perhaps it is not, and Q.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/ is much larger. But the degree of the extension
Q.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/ is either 5 or some multiple of 5, because Theorem 10.7 says
ÅQ.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/ W QÂ D ÅQ.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/ W Q.r1/Â  ÅQ.r1/ W QÂ
D ÅQ.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/ W Q.r1/Â  5:
Because it is a normal extension, the order of the Galois group of Q.r1; r2; r3; r4; r5/
matches the extension's degree, some multiple of 5. Now group theory begins to help us.
Cauchy's Theorem guarantees that the Galois group contains an element of order 5.
That element permutes the five roots, and the only permutations of order 5 in S5 are

250
10. Galois theory
cycles of the five roots, like this example.
r1
r2
r3
r4
r5
The Galois group must also contain the complex conjugacy automorphism, as all
Galois groups do. How this automorphism permutes the five roots depends on how many
of those roots are real numbers. We can find the number of real roots by graphing the
polynomial on a calculator or computer, giving a plot like the one on the left of Figure
10.24. It shows three points on the real number line where the polynomial equals zero,
meaning three roots are real and two are complex. If you prefer to reason out this fact
without using technology, see Exercise 10.27.

Figure 10.24. On the left, the graph of x5 C 10x4   2 shows that it has exactly three real
roots, and therefore two complex ones. On the right, those five roots are plotted, and decimal
approximations of their values given.
By Theorem 10.3, these two non-real roots must be conjugates, so the complex con-
jugacy automorphism swaps them. It corresponds to a permutation like this one.
r1
r2
r3
r4
r5
Although we only know two of the permutations in the Galois group, it is enough. The
work of Exercise 7.32 proves that a subgroup of S5 containing two permutations like
these (a five-cycle and a transposition) must be all of S5. So this Galois group does
indeed contain A5. We have found an unsolvable Galois group! By Theorem 10.11, the
polynomial is unsolvable as well. On the right of Figure 10.24 I plot the five roots of
x5C10x4 2, but their values are given only approximately. I cannot write them precisely
with radical notation because the polynomial is not solvable by radicals.
10.7.3
Conclusion
You now have a good idea why x5 C 10x4  2 is unsolvable, and therefore have a deeper
appreciation of both the big question and its answer. Of course, I gave several facts
from field theory without proof, so I cannot say that you know every detail of why the
polynomial is unsolvable. But we have seen the beautiful and famous relationship between

10.7. Unsolvability
251
groups and fields from Theorems 10.10 and 10.11, and how group theory marshals the
ideas of field theory to this historical result.
The group A5 turned out to be central to the answer to the big question. Figure 10.25
is a larger version of a Cayley diagram of A5 from Figure 5.29. A close look shows hints
of the group's unsolvability all over the diagram; all visible subgroups look quite non-
normal. For instance, consider the cyclic subgroup of order 5 generated by a red arrow.
If that subgroup were normal, then all blue arrows leaving one of its cosets would go
to another coset. But the complete opposite is true|each blue arrow goes to a different
coset! This same fact is true about the order-3 subset obvious in the other Cayley diagram
of A5 in Figure 5.29, also generated by a red arrow. All the visible subgroups of A5 are
as far from normal as they can be.
This makes the Cayley diagram very interconnected, and gives it a certain appearance
of stability. Each cycle is linked to as many others as possible, a feature that makes
physical structures strong. This is not just appearance; carbon atoms in nature can bond
in a structure just like the Cayley diagram in Figure 10.25, forming the molecule Carbon-
60. This structure is called a fullerene, named after architect Richard Buckminster Fuller,
who designed geodesic domes in a similar style.
Figure 10.25. A Cayley diagram for A5, showing its thorough interconnectedness
So in place of the details from field theory, I show you the structure on which the
unsolvability of the quintic rests, the group A5. And you've seen it in a way that Abel
and Galois probably never did!
The unsolvability of polynomials shows us that groups are essential for understanding
the relationships among the most basic operations of algebra. We have seen both the
beauty and the utility of studying abstract patterns like groups. If you are interested in
learning more about structures like fields, I encourage you to try textbooks such as [1],
[8], or [9]. Two other books that do an excellent job of keeping the historical roots of
field theory clear of modern debris are [6] and [11]. The latter is aimed at a broader
audience than the former. Other books I find useful appear in the Bibliography.

Answers to selected Exercises
Chapter 1. What is a group?
Exercise 1.1. It is a group, as follows.
Rule 1.5 is satisfied because the problem specified a predefined list of actions that
contained just one action.
Rule 1.6 is satisfied because swapping two things back is the same as swapping them
in the first place.
Rule 1.7 is satisfied because swapping two things has a very predictable outcome.
Rule 1.8 is satisfied because any sequence of swaps is possible; swapping the two
coins 100 times doesn't prevent you from doing it again, or 100 more times.
Exercise 1.3. It is not a group. Rule 1.8 is not satisfied; you cannot chain together any
sequence of moves you like. If you try to move marbles from your left pocket to your
right pocket twenty times in a row, you will find that it is not possible.
Exercise 1.5. No, it does not, as we can clearly see by the fact that we have encountered
several finite groups already! But more to the point, although Rule 1.8 requires that any
combination of actions be an action, it does not require that it be a new action. For the
group in Exercise 1.1, for instance, there are infinitely many action sequences we could
list, \swap the coins once," \swap the coins twice," \swap the coins three times," etc.,
but that long, infinite list really only contains two different things. Swapping the coins
once produces the same result as swapping them three times, so we do not consider them
different actions in the group. Swapping the coins twice or four times has the same result
as not swapping them at all.
Exercise 1.7.
(a) Swapping the coins twice in a row is equivalent to the action \doing nothing."
(b) Every group will have such an action, because every action is reversible, and thus
any action can be combined with its reversal to produce an action that does nothing.
261

262
Appendix
Exercise 1.10. Many answers are valid here; this one is an example. Consider the list
of actions containing only one thing, this action: Light a match and let it burn out.
Assuming we're doing this with reliable matches in a controlled environment, the result
is predictable. Assuming matches will continue to be manufactured indefinitely, you can
do as many of this action in a row as you like. But it's definitely not reversible.
Exercise 1.12. Many answers are valid here; one example is the situation described in
Exercise 1.3.
Chapter 2. What do groups look like?
Exercise 2.1. The two generators are the horizontal flip and vertical flip. The other actions
in the puzzle are the non-action (do nothing) and the combined action \horizontal flip
then vertical flip."
Exercise 2.3. Arrows that point from a node to itself represent the non-action. Typically
such arrows are not included in the diagram, since they add clutter, but not any useful
information.

Exercise 2.8.
(a) This group is called D4, and there are several ways to represent it with a Cayley
diagram. Here is one.
(b) The moves in the rectangle puzzle are restricted by the shape of the rectangle
itself. Each move returns the rectangle to the same area it originally occupied, with just
the label numbers different. Rotating a rectangle (that isn't a square) one quarter-turn
clockwise does not keep it in the same area, but rotating a square a quarter-turn does.
I was asking you to think ahead a bit with that question; I don't introduce those
reasons in the text until Chapter 3.
Exercise 2.9.
(a)
(b)
(c)
In both parts (b) and (c), the diagram shows that the generators drawn are sufficient
because the diagram is connected. (From any one location, you can get to any other.)

Exercise 2.12. The following is one example answer; it represents the cycle of activities
for a typical newborn baby.

Exercise 2.13. The generators have the special status of being represented by the diagram's
arrows. (And like all other elements of the group, the generators are also represented as
nodes.)
Exercise 2.15. If following arrows in a diagram corresponds to doing actions, then fol-
lowing arrows backwards corresponds to undoing the actions. So in order for us to be
able to follow arrows backwards in a diagram, we cannot have two arrows of the same
type pointing to the same destination from two different sources. For instance, in the
following diagram, it is not clear how to undo the action of the solid black arrow when
in configuration C. Should you go to A or to B?
A
B
C
Exercise 2.17. It guarantees that from every point on the map, there will always be an
arrow of each type leaving that point. This can be verified by considering what it would
be like if it were not true; let's say we had some point P on our map that was lacking
an outbound arrow corresponding to some action A. Then the sequence of moves leading
from the start to P followed by action A would be invalid, which Rule 1.8 forbids.
Chapter 3. Why study groups?
Exercise 3.6. In the Cayley diagram in Figure A.1, the arrows labeled \ 1
4 turn" mean a
quarter turn as if you had twisted the white molecule on top clockwise, spinning the atom
around the vertical axis.
Exercise 3.8. A solution to this problem is not provided, but here is a hint. You may
find it easier to explore the molecule's symmetry group if you know that it has the same
symmetries as a regular pentagon. (Think of laying a pentagon flat with its center at the
center of the molecule, each of its five corners half way between two of the purple atoms,
vertically. Just as the molecule can be spun or flipped, so can the pentagon, and vice
versa.)
Exercise 3.11. The solution to part (d) is shown in Figure A.2. It is a pattern that repeats
vertically in blocks of four; each block of four is a little Klein 4-group, like the group of
the rectangle puzzle from Chapter 2. The curved arrows represent the action of sliding
the pattern to the right by the width of one leaf.

The particular numbering scheme you used is unimportant; it need not be exactly like
mine. But of course, you must label each of the four corners of each leaf, since they are
all alike.
Exercise 3.13.
(a) The following Cayley diagram shows the group generated by the contra dance
figure called \Circle right." Note that the dancers are moving to their own right sides,
which from our point of view means they move counterclockwise.
dancers circle right
dancers circle right
dancers circle right
dancers circle right
Figure A.3.
Rather than moving the dancers around the square, as in the diagram above, I could
have drawn each square with the dancers in their original position, but with arrows to
show where they would end up. This makes it easier to see how repetitions of the \Circle
right" figure can yield other figures, and therefore makes it easier to answer the second
part of this question. Figure A.4 does so.
(b) It contains the \Right and left through," as well as two other figures not shown in
Figure 3.15. One of those figures doesn't look very interesting, because the dancers don't
change positions at all. But keep in mind that these illustrations only show the results of
the figures, not the steps taken during them; a figure may be interesting to watch or to
dance, even though it does not result in a shuffling of the dancers at its end.

Chapter 6. Subgroups
Exercise 6.1. The rightmost one is a Cayley diagram of the group C6, reorganized to
use generators 2 and 3. The leftmost one satisfies all requirements except for regularity;
the blue arrows do not behave the same everywhere. The remaining diagram lacks blue
arrows exiting either of the nodes in its bottom row.
Exercise 6.3(a).

Exercise 6.12(a). Two. (The explanation is up to you.)
Exercise 6.14. Yes. If n is the order of the desired subgroup, try the generator jGj
n .
Exercise 6.16(b). The coset Hb is the set of destinations of the b-arrows that lead from
the elements of H. There are never two different b-arrows leading into the same node

270
Appendix
because the actions represented by the generators are reversible (Exercise2.15). There are
never two b-arrows leaving the same node because the actions represented by the arrows
are deterministic (Exercise 2.16). Thus each b-arrow leads to a different node from each
of the elements of H, so there are exactly as many nodes in Hb as in H.
Exercise 6.17(d). Yes, always. For example, h2ni < hni for any n.

Exercise 6.26.
(a) Every multiplication table for V4 is organized by an order-2 subgroup, because every
element in V4 has order 2. So whichever one appears next to the identity in the
row/column ordering will generate a subgroup of order 2 in the upper-left corner of
the table.
(b) Your column headings should read as follows.

Exercise 6.28. The answers to both parts are \yes," but I leave you to find the examples.
Exercise 6.30. Hint: Look at subgroups of the groups S3, A4, and D10.
Chapter 7. Products and quotients
Exercise 7.3(b). False. For instance, the element .3; 0/ is in C4  C3, but it is not in
C3  C4, because 3 is not in C3.
Exercise 7.4(c). Hint: Start from Figure 7.6, which shows C 3
2 . Your final answer may
require some careful drawing of arrows.
Exercise 7.8.
(c) Hint: Use the information in Section 7.1.4.
(d) Hint: Can you tell whether it is abelian? How can you tell?
Exercise 7.9. Hint: Recall Exercise 6.31.
Exercise 7.14(a). The following diagram is for the rewiring group of C5, with blue arrows
standing for the operation of doubling each red arrow. Another way to say it is that the
action in this rewiring group moves the red arrow that had stood for a to stand for a2.

Answers to Chapter 7

Exercise 7.14(d). Interestingly enough, the rewiring group of S3 is isomorphic to S3
itself. It is shown below; green arrows in the rewiring group represent reversing the red
arrows in S3, and orange arrows in the rewiring group represent advancing the blue arrow
in S3 to where the path red-then-blue had been.

Exercise 7.21. Your answer to Exercise 6.29 part (e) should prove helpful here.
Exercise 7.25(d). Hint: Refer to Exercise 7.23.
Exercise 7.33.
(a) Because D3 is isomorphic to S3, you have already computed its class equation
in Exercise 7.32. The class equation for D1 (isomorphic to C2) is easy to compute, and
then doing one more (D5) should make the pattern clear.
(b) Because D2 is isomorphic to V4, you have already computed the class equations
for the first two odd Dn in Exercise 7.31. Doing one more (D6) should make the pattern
clear.
(d) Hint: See Exercise 7.29.

Exercise 8.6. Yes, all four parts are true, but I leave the explanations to you. Be sure to
base your explanations on Definition 8.1.
Exercise 8.9(c). This is true as long as the group is finite. When the group is infinite,
consider the function in Exercise 8.5.
Exercise 8.11(c). Here is one way to show the infinite quotient using a multiplication

(b) Technically, no. We get a group of cosets that is isomorphic to a subgroup of G.
(c) No. For instance,
Q4
h 1i Å  V4, and yet there is no embedding from V4 into Q4.
Exercise 8.16. Hint: If H is the commutator subgroup, consider an element in the conju-
gate subgroup gHg 1, say gaba 1b 1g 1. Multiply this element by a few commutators
to yield an element of H. What can you then conclude?
Exercise 8.17. In each case, the commutator subgroup is highlighted in red; it maps to
feg in the abelianization.

Exercise 8.24. Hint: Does the orbit of .1; 1/ in Cn  Cm pass through the element .0; 1/?

Exercise 8.29.
(b) Dn Å  Zn Ã C2 for a certain . (What is ?)
(d) We have seen such groups before in Exercise 7.7(c). There is another in Exercise

(c) All of an element's conjugates are in a row, so the row lists all the elements in a
conjugacy class (sometimes more than once). Therefore the rows show all the conjugacy
classes of the group.
(d) A column shows all the conjugates by the specific element at the head of the
column. It therefore shows the whole inner automorphism created by that element. For
instance, reading down the column that is headed by r will tell you where the inner
automorphism .x/ D rxr 1 maps e, then r, then r2, and so on. This makes answering
part (e) easy.
Exercise 8.35. Hint: Use the direct product process for multiplication tables in Definition
7.3 as a starting point. Then come up with a notion of rewiring for multiplication tables.
Exercise 8.38 (b) and (c). Hint: Divide C8 by C2.

Exercise 8.43(a). Hint: Show that it is an embedding by showing that the only element
to which  maps .e; e/ is e.
Exercise 8.44.
(a) By Theorem 8.8, any abelian group of order 4 must be a direct product of cyclic
groups whose orders multiply to 4. The only possibilities of whole numbers multiplying
to 4 are 1  4 and 2  2. The first corresponds to C1  C4, or just C4, and the second
corresponds to C2  C2, which is isomorphic to V4. Thus all abelian groups of order 4
are isomorphic either to C4 or V4, and no other.
(b) The final answer for this part is given here, but justifying it is up to you. There
are three groups to which any abelian group of order 8 must be isomorphic, C2C2 C2,
C2  C4, and C8.

276
Appendix
(d) By Theorem 8.8, any abelian group of order 30 must be a direct product of cyclic
groups whose orders multiply to 30. The possibilities are therefore C1  C30, C2  C15,
C3  C10, C5  C6, and C2  C3  C5. The first of these (C1  C30) is obviously just
C30. But the rest are as well, based on Theorem 8.7. Thus every abelian group of order
30 is isomorphic to just one, C30.
Exercise 8.45(c). Hint: Rewrite the equation as follows.
gapk D gbmg
.gpk /a D .gm/bg
g D .gm/ b.gpk /a
What order does the element gm have? What order does gpk have?

(g) If a copy of C always remains, then the quotients must be eliminating the other

Chapter 10. Galois Theory
Exercise 10.3.
(g) False, because complex conjugation might be equal to the identity, if all the
polynomial's roots are real numbers.
(i) True, a polynomial that doesn't fit the theorem's requirements may still be irre-
ducible.
(j) True. All factorable quintic polynomials are solvable because the existing methods
for polynomials of degrees 1 through 4 can be applied to the factors. For example, because
the quintic equation
3x5 C 6x4 C 13x3 C 21x2 C 28x C 14 D 0;
factors into
.x2 C 2x C 2/.3x3 C 7x C 7/ D 0;
it can be solved. One of the factors must equal zero, so we have two simpler equations.
x2 C 2x C 2 D 0
3x3 C 7x C 7 D 0
For the first, the quadratic formula gives  1 Ë i. For the second, the cubic formula gives
solutions whose exact representations are a bit lengthy, but which are approximately equal
to 0:394 Ë 1:67i and  0:789.

Exercise 10.12. If r is a root of a degree-m polynomial from Q, write
amrm C am 1rm 1 C    C a0 D 0:

Thus all powers r m or above can be reduced, so only powers less than m are needed.

(f) The group of roots is isomorphic to C6, which is generated by the elements 1 and
5. The group of roots itself is generated by either c.
3 / or c.5
3 /.
Exercise 10.20. It requires starting with
p
3i, which is not a root of x3   2. Also, I was
not focused on solvability at that time; it was clear that Q.r1; r2; r3/ is an extension by
radicals because I wrote r1, r2, and r3 using radicals.
Exercise 10.21. Hint: Show that  fixes 0 and 1, then proceed to all of Q from there.
Exercise 10.22(b). If r is the given root, r D

So the polynomial is x10   2x5   1.
Exercise 10.24(a). One of the roots is  1
3; the other two are not. Write x D   1
3.
Exercise 10.25. Hint: Factor x  3p
2 out of x3   2. Recall that you are permitted to use
any coefficient in Q.r1/.
Exercise 10.27. The derivative is 5x4 C 40x3.
5x4 C 40x3 D 0
5x3.x C 8/ D 0
x D 0 or x D  8
Thus the polynomial has only two places where it changes direction (from uphill to
downhill or vice versa). Thus there are at most three places it might cross the x axis, since
between any two such crossings it must change direction. We can tell that the polynomial
does indeed cross the x axis exactly three times by plugging into the polynomial four
values, 0,  8, a large number (say 100), and a small number (say  100). The results are
in the following table.

Thus the function goes from negative to positive, back to negative, and then positive one
final time, for a total of three crossings of the x axis, and thus three real roots.
Exercise 10.28.
(a) See Exercise 10.17.
(c) I describe the general technique and one possible answer; you must find your
own polynomial. Let the derivative of the polynomial we seek have four different roots
a; b; c; d, so there may be five crossings of the x axis. That derivative is then .x  a/.x  b/.x   c/.x   d/.
Multiply out the derivative and integrate to get the original polynomial (introducing
a new constant e). Multiply by a common denominator to have only integer coefficients.
Find values of a; b; c; d; e that satisfy the Eisenstein criterion. (You have a lot of freedom,
so guess-and-check is a somewhat effective method.)
Now we have to verify that the peaks and valleys of your polynomial are on opposite
sides of the x axis. So plug a; b; c; d into your polynomial and see what y values they
yield. Modify e to ensure they straddle the x axis, while preserving the Eisenstein criterion.
When following this procedure, I obtained the polynomial
6x5   15x4   10x3 C 30x2   1;
but yours may be different.
(d) Your answer to part (b) is, for the reasons in Section 10.7.
