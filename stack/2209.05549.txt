Abstract
The properties which give quantum mechanics its unique character - unitarity, comple-
mentarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty, nonlocality - derive from the algebraic structure of
Hermitian operators acting on the wavefunction in complex Hilbert space. Because of this,
the wavefunction cannot be shown to describe an ensemble of deterministic states where un-
certainty simply reﬂects a lack of knowledge about which ensemble member describes reality.
This has led to endless debates about the ontology of quantum mechanics.
Here we derive these same quantum properties from number theoretic attributes of trigono-
metric functions applied to an explicitly ensemble-based representation of discretised complex
Hilbert states. To avoid ﬁne-tuning, the metric on state space must be p-adic rather than Eu-
clidean where 1/p determines the ﬁneness of the discretisation. This hints at both the existence
of an underpinning fractal state-space geometry onto which states of the world are constrained.
In this model, violation of Bell inequalities is a manifestation of this geometric constraint and
does not imply a breakdown of local space-time causality.
Because the discretised wavefunction describes an ensemble of states, there is no collapse of
the wavefunction. Instead measurement describes a nonlinear clustering of state-space trajec-
tories on the state-space geometry. In this model, systems with mass greater than the Planck
mass will not exhibit quantum properties and instead behave classically. The geometric con-
straint suggests that the exponential increase in the size of state space with qubit number may
break down with qubit numbers as small as a few hundred. Quantum mechanics is itself a
singular limit of this number-theoretic model at p = ∞. A modiﬁcation of general relativity,
consistent with this discretised model of quantum physics, is proposed.

Introduction
The quantum revolution was kickstarted by Planck’s insight that the energy of an electrically
charged oscillator in a cavity containing black-body radiation varies, not continuously, but in
discrete increments. This proposal led directly to the development of quantum mechanics, our
most successful theory of physics.
The properties that give quantum mechanics its unique status in physical theory - unitarity,
complementarity, non-commutativity, uncertainty and nonlocality - derive from the represen-
tation of quantum observables as Hermitian operators on complex Hilbert space.
From an
experimental point of view there is no reason for questioning this representation. And yet from
a theoretical point of view, perhaps there is [8]. Not least, the measurement problem is still
felt by many to be unsolved and perhaps unsolvable in quantum mechanics. In addition, the

failure of local realism in quantum mechanics, implied by the violation of Bell’s inequality [1]
[6], is at least in tension with the deterministic causal theory of general relativity. At heart,
these conceptual problems arise because the quantum mechanical wavefunction ψ cannot be
interpreted as describing an ensemble of states of a deterministically evolving locally causal
system.
In this paper, a diﬀerent approach is taken. Planck’s great insight is applied a second time,
to the complex continuum of Hilbert space (if the term ‘second quantisation’ was not already
used in physics, it would have formed the title of this paper). That it to say, we discretise
Hilbert space [3]. Since the precision at which experiments are performed is necessarily ﬁnite,
the experiments that conﬁrm quantum mechanics will also conﬁrm a consistent theory in which
complex Hilbert vectors and tensor products belong to a suﬃciently ﬁne discretisation of Hilbert
space.
Of course, this would achieve nothing if all aspects of the discretised model were arbitrarily
close to quantum mechanics. However, important diﬀerences between quantum mechanics and
the discretised model are uncovered. Firstly, the unique properties that characterise quantum
mechanical systems (see above) can all, instead, be derived as a simple consequence of num-
ber theoretic properties of trigonometric functions, applied to this ψ-ensemble [12] description.
Here we ﬁx the ﬁneness of the discretisation by the value 1/p where p is a large integer. To
avoid the derivations from being considered ﬁnely tuned (the number-theoretic derivations dis-
tinguish between rational and irrational angles), the metric on state space must be p-adic rather
than Euclidean. This hints at a p-adic and hence fractal geometric explanation of quantum
nonlocality: not as a physical process that is in tension with the causal space-time geometry
of general relativity, but rather as a constraint imposed by fractal state-space geometry.
In this model there is no ‘collapse of the wavefunction’ and the measurement problem [15]
is simply that of describing trajectory clustering - potentially gravitationally induced - in state
space. In this framework, quantum mechanics is a singular limit of this discretisation at p = ∞.
This notion is consistent with Hardy’s axioms for quantum mechanics - any discretisation, no
matter how ﬁne, will violate the Continuity axiom [16]. Indeed, all the number-theoretic results
in this paper hold no matter how ﬁne is the discretisation providing 1/p ̸= 0. Nevertheless we
estimate a value pmax of p and from this make two predictions: that a limited number of qubits
(possibly as few as a couple of hundred) can be generally entangled together, and that objects
with mass greater than the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum properties.
Section 2 describes the framework for the discretisation of complex Hilbert space and a key
number theorem that is used to derive quantum properties from bit string representations of
the wavefunction. Section 3 describes the number-theoretic approach to complementarity, non-
commutativity, uncertainty, Schr¨odinger evolution and measurement, the quantum mechanical
and classical limit of this theory. Section 4 describes Bell’s theorem and the GHZ state from this
discretised perspective. A modiﬁcation to the ﬁeld equations of general relativity, consistent
with the results above, is proposed in Section 5. This paper is an extension and a simpliﬁcation
of the author’s earlier work [26] discretising the Bloch sphere.

Discretisation of Complex Hilbert Space and the
Ensemble Representation of the Wavefunction
2.1
The Symbolism of Atomic Measurements
The title of this sub-section is taken from the sub-title of Schwinger’s book [29] on quantum
measurement. In his book, Schwinger attempts to develop quantum mechanics by constructing
an algebra of abstract measurement symbols. This notion of measurement outcomes as mere
2

symbols clearly makes some sense: we do not need to know what ‘spin up’ and ‘spin down’
actually means in order to express the spin state of some electron a |spin up⟩+ |spin down⟩,
any more than we need to know what it means biologically for a cat to be alive or dead, in
order to express the state of a cat as |alive⟩+|dead⟩. In both cases we can simply replace words
with symbols so that these states are represented as |1⟩+ | −1⟩.
This notion of measurement symbolism ﬁts well with the other use of symbols in this pa-
per, to represent a coarse-grain partition of the state space of deterministic dynamical systems.
Indeed symbolic dynamics is a mature branch of classical dynamical systems theory [21], and
is useful for describing the topology of attractors of dynamical systems. As an example, the
unstable periodic orbits (UPOs) which are embedded in the Lorenz attractor [22] can be rep-
resented as ﬁnite bit strings (e.g. 1, −1, 1, −1, 1, 1, −1, 1 represents symbolically a UPO of the
Lorenz attractor, where ‘1’ is a symbol representing the left-hand lobe of the attractor, and
‘−1’ is a symbol representing the right-hand lobe). As an example of symbolic dynamics, Ghys
[10] has shown that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the symbolic representation
of the UPOs of the Lorenz attractor and a symbolic representation of the modular group.
We discretise complex Hilbert space with these dual notions in mind. Hence, when rep-
resenting Hilbert states as bit strings, the individual bits are to be thought of as deﬁning
underlying deterministic states relative to some coarse-grain partition of some deterministic
state space. Long strings of such bits will have well-deﬁned statistical properties in terms of
ensemble averages, standard deviations and correlations
2.2
Discretisation and Niven’s Theorem
Hilbert vectors over the real numbers provide a natural way to represent classical systems under
(epistemic) uncertainty. For example, the state of the top card of a well-shuﬄed face-down deck
of cards can be represented as
|ψball bearing⟩=
r
1
52 |ace of hearts⟩+
r
51
52 |not ace of hearts⟩
(1)
That the squared sum of the components of the vector equals one is consistent with Pythagoras’
theorem [18]. Born’s rule (interpreting squared amplitudes as probabilities) is consistent with
the fact that the probabilities of the top card being the ace of hearts and not being the ace
of hearts sum to 1. That the squared amplitudes are rational numbers is consistent with the
frequentist-based probabilities associated with the ﬁnite deck, and it is also consistent with
one of Penrose’s motivations for developing his model of spin networks [28] where combinatoric
rules ensure probabilities are always describable by rational numbers.
Based on the notion of discretisation of Hilbert space, we will be seeking an ensemble
description of a generic K-qubit quantum state |ψK⟩in the form
a0|1, 1, . . . , 1⟩+a1eiφ1|1, 1, . . . , 1, −1⟩+a2eiφ2|1, 1, . . . , −1, 1⟩+. . . a2Keiφ2K |−1, −1, . . .−1, −1⟩
(2)
where P2K
0
a2
j = 1. Motivated in part by the discussion above we look for a discretisation of
the form
a2
j = mj
2N ∈Q,
(3)
where N ∈N and 0 ≤mj ≤2N.
The factor 2 is linked to a speciﬁc representation of
quaternionic operators discussed in Section 2.3.
A key diﬀerence between the Hilbert space representation of a quantum state and the Hilbert
space representation of a classical state under uncertainty, is the essential role that complex
numbers play in the former [5]. We seek a discretisation of complex phases of the form
φj
2π = nj
4N ∈Q
(4)
3

with 1 ≤nj ≤4N where again the factor of 4 is linked to a representation of quaternionic
operators discussed in Section 2.3. In this way {φj} is the ﬁnite multiplicative group of 4Nth
roots of unity. Importantly for the development below, this is homomorphic to the group of
cyclic permutations of the form (1, 2, . . . 4N).
As an example, in quantum mechanics a single qubit
|ψ1(θ, φ)⟩= cos θ
2|1⟩+ sin θ
2eiφ| −1⟩
(5)
can be represented by a point on the continuum Bloch sphere, where θ denotes colatitude and
φ longitude relative to some north pole z. In the discretised framework, if (5) satisﬁes the
rationality constraints (3) and (4) then
sin2 θ
2 = m
2N ;
φ
2π =
n
4N
(6)
where 0 ≤m ≤2N, 0 ≤n ≤4N. From (6), cos θ = 1 −2 sin2 θ/2 must be rational.
Let Sz(θ, φ) (Sz for short) denote a skeleton of points on the unit 2-sphere (the discretised
Bloch sphere) with north pole at z, satisfying (6). A critical property of Sz, exploited repeatedly
below, is the number theoretic incommensurateness between rational angles and angles with
rational cosines, referred to as Niven’s Theorem:
Theorem. Let φ/2π ∈Q. Then cos φ /∈Q except when cos φ = 0, ± 1
2, ±1. [24, 19]
In the remainder of this section, an explicit ensemble-based representation of the K-qubit
wavefunction is developed Most discussion is devoted to K = 1. From there, the generalisation
to higher qubit states is relatively straightforward.
2.3
Single Qubits
To start, consider four bit strings A, B, C and D, each of N elements drawn from {1, −1} but
otherwise arbitrary. As discussed in more detail in Section 3.4, ‘1’ and ‘−1’ will be used as
symbolic representations of some partition of state space. As discussed in Section 3.5, N is a
positive integer inversely dependent on the energy of the quantum system under study.
The fundamental notion underpinning the construction in this section is the close link be-
tween quaternions and rotations in physical space. In particular, with || denoting concatenation,
let
E = A || B || C || D
(7)
denote a 4N element bit string and deﬁne
i1(E) = B || −A || −D ||
C;
i2(E) = C ||
D || −A || −B;
i3(E) = D || −C ||
B || −A
(8)
where the negation of a bit string is obtained by negating all individual bits in the string. It is
straightforwardly shown that the operators i1, i2 and i3 are quaternionic, i.e. satisfy
i2
1(E) = i2
2(E) = i2
3(E) = −E;
i2 ◦i1(E) = i3(E)
(9)
We now construct a 1-parameter family of bit strings i(m)
1
(E) that monotonically interpolates
4

between E and i1(E) as m goes from 0 to N. For example, with N = 3, this is achieved with
i(0)
1 (E) = E = a1a2a3 ||
b1b2b3
||
c1c2c3

i(1)
1 (E) = a1a2b3 ||

1 (E) = a1b2b3 || b1 −a2 −a3

i(3)
1 (E) = i1(E) = b1b2b3 || −a1 −a2 −a3 || −d1 −d2 −d3 || c1c2c3
(10)
where the correlation between i(m)
1
(E) and E equals 1−m/3 and the correlation between i(m)
1
(E)
and i1(E) equals m/3. More generally, deﬁne partial concatenation operators

(11)
so that B0
||C = B, BN
|| C = C. Deﬁne the following generalisations i(m)
1
of i1 for 0 ≤m ≤2N:
i(m)
1
(E) =

||
(−A) || (−A)m−N

(−B) || (−D)m−N
||
(−C) || Cm−N

(−D)
; N ≤m ≤2N (12)
Note that, i(0)
1 (E) = E, i(N)
1
(E) = i1(E), i(2N)(E) = −E. The correlation between i(m)
2
(E) and
E is equal to 1 −m/N.
We now let i(m,n)
1
(E) denote the result of applying the cyclic permutation (1, 2, 3 . . . 4N) n
times to i(m)
1
(E). Hence, from (10), for N = 3
i(0,0)

(13)
and so on.
Finally, in the discretised representation of complex Hilbert space, we associate the single
qubit wavefunction |ψ1(θ, φ)⟩(see (5)) with the length 4N bit string
B(θ, φ) = i(m,n)
1
(1).
(14)
where

(15)
In (14): i) sin2 θ/2 = m/2N (the fraction of −1s in B(θ, φ)) and cos θ = 1−m/N (the correlation
between B(θ, φ) and B(0, 0)); ii) φ = 2πn/4N. The property
i3 (B(π
2 , 0)) = i3 ◦i1(1) = −i2(1) = i(N,N)
1
(1) = B(π
2 , π
2 )
(16)
describes the essential complex nature of the bit-string states (and the associated skeleton Sz)
in this discretised model - operating on a bit string at the equator of the discretised Bloch
Sphere by the square root of minus operator i3 is equivalent to a rotation in longitude by an
angle π/2 about the z axis.
Just as the quantum wavefunction is deﬁned modulo a global phase transformation, so,
in this discretised ensemble representation, the statistical properties of B(θ, φ) are preserved
under a global permutation of bits - one that is consistently applied to all B(θ, φ). We can
represent this global phase transformation by replacing 1 in (14) with a more general E.
5

This construction can be generalised by including the notion of a ‘null measurement’ [16].
For example, we may have two (or more) detectors, each represented by a symbolic label,
but a particle may be incident on neither (or none) of them.
This generalisation can be
achieved by appending the null symbol X to i(m)
1
(1), nX times. With such a generalisation,
cos2 θ/2 = 1 −m/2N equals the fraction of 1s amongst all non-null states in B(θ, φ) whilst
φ = 2πn/p where p = 4N + nX. If nX is odd and p not divisible by 3, then the exceptions
cos φ = 0, ±1/2, −1 to Niven’s theorem can be ignored (which we henceforth do).
2.4
Multiple Qubits
In quantum mechanics, let |ψ1⟩, |ψ2⟩denote two general K −1 qubit states in quantum me-
chanics. Then a general K qubit state can be written as
cos θ
2|ψ1⟩|1⟩+ sin θ
2eiφ|ψ2⟩| −1⟩
(17)
Here the number 2K −1 of complex degrees of freedom in an K-qubit Hilbert vector increases
exponentially as 1, 3, 7, 15 . . . for K = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ..
A general K-qubit Hilbert state in the discretised model is associated with K bit strings,
each string comprising 2K+1N bits. The state can be deﬁned inductively. Let B1(K −1),
B2(K −1) denote two ordered collections of K −1 bit strings each of length 2KN and let
B1 ⊕B2 denote an ordered collection of K −1 bit strings obtained by concatenating the jth
bit string of B1 with the jth bit string of B2, so that each bit string of B1 ⊕B2 has length
2K+1N. Then, consistent with (17), the K-qubit discretised Hilbert state is given by the K −1
bit strings B1(K −1)⊕B2(K −1), and the single length-4N bit string i(m0,n0)

degrees of freedom in quantum mechanics). Here the two pairs of bit strings in between the
upper and lower braces are generic 2-qubit states.
The entangled Bell state is discussed in particular in Section 4.1

The Physical Interpretation of Single Qubit Physics
3.1
Complementarity
In quantum mechanics, systems can exhibit wave-like properties or particle-like properties, but
not both simultaneously. As shown in Fig 1, these properties are manifest in a Mach-Zehnder
(MZ) interferometer (Fig 1) with the second half-silvered mirror in place, or with the second
half-silvered mirror removed, respectively. The quantum state of a photon passing through an
6

Figure 1: a) A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the second half-silvered mirror in place, per-
forming an interferometric experiment. b) A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with the half-silvered
mirror removed, performing a which-way experiment. In both cases, the nominal lengths of the
interferometer arms are the same. However, the exact lengths must necessarily diﬀer. Conversely,
for number theoretic reasons, it is impossible for the experimental outcomes in a) and b) to be si-
multaneously deﬁned, i.e., for the same exact arm lengths, consistent with the quantum notion of
complementarity.
7

MZ interferometer can be written as
|ψ⟩= cos φ
2 |1⟩+ sin φ
2 | −1⟩
(20)
where φ denotes a phase diﬀerence associated with the two arms of the interferometer. Here
|1⟩and | −1⟩are the measurement eigenstates associated with the detectors D1 and D−1,
respectively. If we now remove the second half-silvered mirror, then the quantum state becomes
|ψ⟩=
1
√
2
(|1⟩+ eiφ| −1⟩)
(21)
As discussed, in the discretised model, |ψ⟩in (20) is represented by a bit string B(φ, 0)
where the fraction of 1s is equal to cos2 φ/2 (and the fraction of −1s is equal to sin2 φ/2),
providing cos2 φ/2 is rational, and of the form m/2N. By varying φ from 0 to π in discrete
steps which ensure the rationality condition is satisﬁed, then the fraction of 1s varies from 1
to 0 in steps which can be as small as we like, for large enough N. In the discretised model,
the symbol ‘1’ labels a deterministic world where the detector D1 registers a particle, and the
symbol ‘−1’ labels a deterministic world where the detector D−1 registers a particle. How
to deﬁne ‘measurement’ objectively in this discretised model is discussed in Section 3.4. By
contrast, |ψ⟩in (21) is represented by a bit string B(π/2, φ) where, for all φ, the fraction of 1s
(and −1s) is equal to 1/2 and φ is a rational angle.
Now when an experimenter sets up such an experiment, of course he or she cannot control
directly whether φ or cos φ is rational. All an experimenter can do is set φ to within some
nominal accuracy. We imagine some small interval of size ϵ > 0 which deﬁnes the nominal
accuracy of the experimenter’s ability to set φ. The theoretical structure of the model, not
some incredible experimental ﬁnesse, ensures that the appropriate rationality constraints are
obeyed.
Imagine performing interference measurements on one ensemble of particles with the second
half silvered mirror in place, and which-way measurements on a second ensemble of particles
with the second half silvered mirror removed.
Suppose that φ is nominally the same (say
φ = 0) for both ensembles of measurements. Then the exact values φ∗will not be the same
for both ensembles: for the ﬁrst ensemble, each φ∗would be drawn from the subset of exact
values where cos φ∗is rational, whilst for the second ensemble, each φ∗would be drawn from
the subset where φ∗was itself rational. Indeed, we can, without loss of generality, assume that
each particle is uniquely labelled by an exact φ∗value. This will be a pervasive theme in the
discussion below, that a particle’s ‘hidden variables’ can be associated with some exact (but
unknown) measurement setting φ∗. Of course this means that, at the time a particle is emitted
from a source, its hidden variables are not localised within the particle in question. However,
such a situation is no diﬀerent to describing a human by some lifetime achievement (e.g.,
whether they won a Nobel Prize or not). The data that determines such a lifetime achievement
is manifestly not localised within the baby’s DNA at the time of birth, but nevertheless exists
on a spacelike hypersurface through the birth event.
Suppose an interference measurement was performed on a particular particle and consider
the hypothetical counterfactual measurement where a which-way measurement was performed
on the same particle, i.e., keeping the hidden variable ﬁxed. By construction, such an hypo-
thetical experiment is deﬁned by removing the half-silvered mirror but keeping ﬁxed the exact
lengths of the interferometer arms associated with the real experiment. It is clearly a matter
for the model equations as to whether such a hypothetical experiment is consistent with the
laws of physics: as mentioned, the experimenter does not have control over the exact measure-
ment settings and therefore cannot ensure that the exact length of the arms remain identical (a
passing gravitational wave would cause them to diﬀer) from one run to the next. Indeed, this
8

simultaneous measurement is internally inconsistent: by Niven’s theorem it is impossible for
φ to be simultaneously a rational angle and have a rational cosine (above we have eliminated
all exceptions to Niven’s theorem). Hence, by number theory, it is impossible for a quantum
system to have wave-like properties (|ψ1⟩) and particle-like properties (|ψ2⟩) simultaneously.
To prevent simultaneous knowledge of the wave and particle properties of a quantum sys-
tem in their deterministic toy-model of quantum interference, Catani et al [4] introduce by
assumption an ‘epistemic obstruction’. We do not need to postulate such an obstruction here;
it is a consequence of the particular discretisation of complex Hilbert Space used. Indeed, as
discussed in Section 4.1, the number-theoretic basis for this epistemic obstruction is identical to
that which explains the violation of Bell’s inequality - Niven’s theorem. From this perspective,
we agree with Feynman [9], and Hance and Hossenfelder [14] that quantum interference is the
only real mystery in quantum physics and disagree with Catani et al who claim that it isn’t.
3.2
Non-commutativity
We analyse a sequential Stern-Gerlach experiment (Fig 2a) in the discretised framework. In a
particular run of the experiment, a spin-1/2 particle passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus
(SG1) oriented in the nominal a direction. The spin-up output channel of SG1 is fed into a
second Stern-Gerlach apparatus (SG2) oriented in the nominal b direction. The spin-up output
channel of SG2 is fed into a third Stern-Gerlach apparatus (SG3) oriented in the nominal c
direction. We can suppose that an experiment comprises many individual runs, all with the
same nominal orientations, but diﬀerent exact orientations.
For any particular run of this experiment, there exist 3 exact orientations referred to as a∗,
b∗and c∗respectively. In the discretised model, the cosines of the relative orientations between
a∗and b∗and between b∗and c∗must be rational. In Fig 2 c) is shown 4 (of potentially
many) diﬀerent possible triples of exact orientations satisfying these rationality constraints.
They correspond to 4 diﬀerent runs of SG1 −SG2 −SG3, i.e., four diﬀerent particles with four
diﬀerent exact measurement orientations. As discussed further below, these exact measurement
settings can be used to deﬁne a particle’s unique hidden variables.
As with the Mach-Zender experiment where we performed an interference measurement
in one run, and a which-way measurement in another run, so here it is possible to perform
SG1 −SG2 −SG3 in one run and SG1 −SG3 −SG2 in a second run (Fig 2b). In the second
run, the cosines of the relative orientations between the exact settings of SG1 and SG3 and
between the exact settings of SG3 and SG2 must both be rational. For this second run (unlike
the ﬁrst) we do not require that the cosine of the relative orientation between SG1 and SG2 is
rational.
The essential nature of non-commuting quantum observables lies in the impossibility of
simultaneously performing these two sequential SG experiments a) and b) on the same particle,
i.e. keeping the particle’s hidden variables ﬁxed. According to the deﬁnition above, keeping
the hidden variable ﬁxed in going from a) to b) - from the real-world run to a counterfactual
run - we keep a∗, b∗and c∗ﬁxed. But now we run into a number theoretic inconsistency. This
is a corollary of Niven’s Theorem, referred to as the Impossible Triangle Corollary.
Corollary. Let △a∗c∗c∗be a non-degenerate triangle on the unit sphere with rational internal
angles such that the cosines of the angular distances between a∗and b∗and between b∗and c∗
are both rational. Then the cosine of angular distance between a∗and c∗cannot be rational.
Proof. Assume otherwise. Use the cosine rule for △(a∗b∗c∗),
cos θa∗c∗= cos θa∗b∗cos θb∗c∗+ sin θa∗b∗sin θb∗c∗cos φb∗

straints for experiment a). One set of triples, shown as a∗, b∗and c∗, labels a particle’s set of hidden
variables. By the Impossible Triangle Corollary, these constraints make experiment b) impossible
when applied to the particle with the same hidden variables as in a). Speciﬁcally, the cosine of the
relative angle between a∗and c∗cannot be rational when the cosines of relative angles between a∗
and b∗and between b∗and c∗are rational. In this way, the quantum notion of non-commutativity
can be explained from the properties of numbers.

Figure 3: Analysis of the properties of spherical triangles formed from the point q and the nominally
orthogonal triple of points, z, x and y provides a number-theoretic representation of the Uncertainty
Principle, both statistical and ontological.
where θa∗c∗denotes the angular distance between a∗and c∗on the unit sphere, etc and φb∗is the
internal angle at the vertex b∗. Since cos θa∗b∗and cos θb∗c∗are both rational, then from (22),
sin θa∗b∗sin θb∗c∗cos φb∗must be rational. Squaring, (1 −cos2 θa∗yb∗)(1 −cos2 θb∗c∗) cos2 φb∗
must be rational. Again, since cos θa∗b∗and cos θb∗c∗are both rational, cos2 φb∗and hence
cos 2φb∗must be rational. Since △(a∗b∗c∗) is non-degenerate cos2 φb∗must be irrational by
Niven’s theorem. Hence cos θa∗c∗must be irrational.
As discussed at the end of Section 2.3, we assume the bit strings include null measurements
to exclude exact multiples of π/4 and π/3 in Niven’s theorem.
As illustrated in Fig 2 c), we label one of four possible triples of exact points where both
cos θa∗b∗and cos θb∗c∗are rational. For this, cos θa∗c∗rational. Hence the hypothetical experi-
ment in Fig 2 b), counterfactual to the real-world experiment in Fig 2 a) and using the hidden
variable as in a), is not consistent with the rationality conditions of the discretised model. We
can therefore explain the non-commutativity of spin from properties of numbers in a discretised
model of quantum physics.
3.3
Uncertainty
Consider an exact point q on the Bloch sphere lying on a skeleton with north pole at z, where
x and y are nominally orthogonal points on the equator (Fig 3). Using the sine rule for the
spherical triangle △(q, x, y) to nominal accuracy
sin φx
sin θqy = sin φq
1
(23)
Taking the modulus we therefore have
| sin φx| ≤| sin θqy|
(24)
11

Using the cosine rule for the spherical triangle △(q, x, z)
cos θqz = sin θqx cos(π
2 −φx) = sin θqx sin φx
(25)
Taking absolute values and substituting in (24) then
| sin θqx|| sin θqy| ≥| cos θqz|
(26)
Now as discussed above, the mean value of the bits in the bit string on Sz at co-latitude θqz
equals cos θqz, whilst it is easily shown that | sin θqz| equals the standard deviation. Writing
cos θqz = ¯Sz, sin θqx = ∆Sx and sin θqy = Sy then
∆Sx∆Sy ≥| ¯Sz|
(27)
If the elements of the bit string were set equal to ±ℏ/2 instead of ±1, then (27) would be
replaced by:
∆Sx∆Sy ≥ℏ
2| ¯Sz|
(28)
which is of course the expression of the Uncertainty Principle for qubits.
But there is more to the Uncertainty Principle than this.
Let z∗, and x∗denote exact
orientations inside the nominal orientations. If the cosines of the angular distances between z∗
and x∗and between q and z∗are rational, then the cosine of the angular distance between q and
x∗will not be rational. Similarly if we replace x∗with y∗. That is to say, using the Impossible
Triangle Corollary, if the discretised quantum state is deﬁned at q relative to a precise North
Pole at z∗, it cannot simultaneously be deﬁned relative with respect to a rotated North Pole
at x∗or y∗.
Hence, this number-theoretic version of the Uncertainty Principle accounts for both the sta-
tistical relationship governing the mean and standard deviation of measurements on ensembles
of particles, and the inherent contextuality of quantum spin.
3.4
Schr¨odinger Evolution and Measurement.
The distinct nature of unitary evolution and of measurement is straightforwardly described
in this discretised model of quantum physics. Consider a quantum mechanical wavefunction
prepared in state |ψ(t0)⟩, which evolves through a series of unitary transformations
|ψ(tn)⟩= U(tj, tj−1) U(tj−1, tj−2) . . . U(t2, t1) U(t1, t0)|ψ(t0)⟩= U(tj, t0)|ψ(t0)⟩
(29)
where U(tj, tj−1) = eiH(tj−tj−1) and H is the relevant Hamiltonian operator for the Schr¨odinger
equation.
In the discretised model, the prepared state |ψ(t0))⟩is associated with the bit string 1 at
the north pole z = z(t0) of the Bloch sphere skeleton Sz(t0). |ψ(t1)⟩is then associated with the
bit string i(m(t1),n(t1))
1
(1) associated with the point z(t1) on Sz(t0) with colatitude/longitude
(θ(t1), φ(t1)), where cos2 θ(t1)/2 = 1 −m(t1)/2N and φ(t1) = 2πn(t1)/4N. Continuing, we
associate |ψ(t2)⟩with the bit string
i(m(t2),n(t2))
1
(i(m(t1),n(t1))
1
(1))
(30)
at the point z(t2) with colatitude/longitude (θ(t2), φ(t2)) relative to the Bloch sphere skeleton
Sz(t1), where cos2 θ(t2)/2 = 1 −m(t2)/2N and φ(t2) = 2πn(t2)/4N. In this way, |ψ(tn)⟩is
associated with the bit string
i
(m(tj),n(tj))
1
(i
(m(tj−1),n(tj−1))
1
(. . . (i(m(t2),n(t2))
1
(i(m(t1),n(t1))
1
(1))) . . .).

We now come to the ﬁnal measurement step. What distinguishes the measurement step
from just another unitary step? The key point is that during each of the unitary steps, the bit
strings are strictly ordered. Because of this ordering, it is always possible to undo (31) with
inverse transformations, returning the ensemble state to 1. However, in the measurement step,
the bit string is simply a disordered mixture.
To make sense of this, we need to turn to a more geometric representation of these bit
strings. To motivate such a geometric representation, consider ﬁrst the possible objection that
since the discretised model makes an ontological distinction between states with rational angles
and states with rational cosines of angles, the model is unrealistically ﬁne tuned. However, to
make such an objection requires a speciﬁcation of metric with respect to which the tuning is
deemed ﬁne. According to Ostrowsky’s theorem [20], there exist two classes of norm-induced
metric: the Euclidean metric and the p-adic metric. The set of p-adic integers is homeomorphic
to Cantor sets with p iterated pieces [20]. This hints at the existence of some global fractal
geometry IU in state space to which states of the universe are constrained.
Motivated by
chaos theory, we call this the ‘invariant set’ geometry in the sense that IU is invariant under a
dynamical evolution of states [25]. Points which lie oﬀIU are inconsistent with the geometric
constraint and are p-adically distant from points on IU, no matter how close such points may
seem to be from a Euclidean perspective. We can state this in a related way. Associated with
IU is a non-trivial non-zero (Haar) measure. The states of the world which do not lie on IU
have zero invariant measure [13]. The geometric structure of IU will be analysed further in
Section 3.4 when comparing unitary evolution and measurement from the discretised model
perspective.
Fig 4 illustrates the diﬀerence between unitary evolution and measurement from this ge-
ometric perspective. Fig 4 a) shows a state-space trajectory segment. At some low-level of
iteration of IU it appears a 1D curve. On magniﬁcation it is seen to comprise a helix of 4N
trajectories. For simple unitary transformations where we write eiH∆t = eiω∆t, the unitaries
(cyclic permutations of the bit strings) can be represented geometrically in terms of a helix
of trajectories rotating with frequency ω. In the relativistic Dirac equation, we would simply
add a second helix rotating in the opposite direction (giving representation of the left- and
right-handed Weyl spinors).
A cross section through a trajectory segment would reveal a fractal structure homeomorphic
to a Cantor set with p iterated pieces, as shown in Fig 4 b. In Fig 4c we associate measurement
with a divergence of trajectories associated with the interaction of the quantum system with
its environment, and a (nonlinear) clustering of trajectories into discrete clusters, which we
label 1 and −1. If we form bit strings after the trajectories have clustered, then there is no
natural order in the bit strings - they have become disordered. This can be contrasted with
the helical structure in the unitary phase where the trajectories are ordered. Note that we can
label the trajectories in the unitary phase of evolution in Fig 4a with the clusters to which
they subsequently evolve. This of course does not imply any kind of retrocausality. The cluster
labels merely provide a convenient means to express the ordering of the trajectory segments.
This divergence of trajectories can be thought of as part of a ‘fractal zoom’ and reveals the
trajectory segments at the next level of iteration. In this sense the passage of time can itself
be thought of as a fractal zoom of the invariant set IU.
These clusters are not the only way to label trajectories symbolically. For example, we can
partition state space as the union of subspaces where a particle either went through the upper
arm of a Mach-Zehnder device, or through the lower arm. We can form strings comprising bits
which are the symbolic labels associate with such a partition. Hence, according to this version
of the discretised model, a particle goes through the upper arm or the lower arm. It does not go
through both arms simultaneously. From this perspective, the ‘non-classical’ nature of quan-
tum physics arises from the assumption that the laws of physics describe a geometry in state
13

Figure 4: Local state space geometry of the invariant set IU. a) a state space trajectory which appears
a 1D curve at a low iterate of the fractal geometry is found to comprise a helix of 4N trajectories
(whose periodicity is related to the energy of the quantum system). b) A cross section through a
trajectory is a Cantor set with 4N +nX iterated pieces, homeomorphic to the 4N +nX-adic integers.
c) On the invariant set, measurement is associated with a divergence of trajectories as a quantum

clustering. In a) and b) each trajectory is labelled/coloured by the cluster to which it evolves in c).

space. This geometry embodies information about the structure of neighbouring counterfactual
trajectories where the particle went through the other arm of the interferometer. This is why
it is necessary to invoke counterfactual computation [23] to understand the power of quantum
computers. By contrast, the laws of classical physics merely describe information about how
systems evolve on a single (least action) trajectory. In quantum physics one cannot think of
the trajectories in isolation as one can in classical physics.
In this picture of measurement, the wavefunction does not ‘collapse’ in the usual quantum
sense of the word. By contrast, the wavefunction is always just an ensemble description of
reality. On the other hand, the transition from the ordered bit string description to a disor-
dered description (from helix to discrete clusters) clearly does signal some loss of information
associated with what we call the ‘measurement process’.
Above we have identiﬁed p with the number 4N of Section 2.
However, for algebraic
reasons, it is usually assumed that p is prime. However, as discussed in Section 2, there will
exist trajectories which do not cluster, e.g., if they lie on the boundary between clusters. If we
write p = 4N + nX where nX denotes a number of such null states, then it becomes possible
for p to be prime. If nX = 1, indicating a single null trajectory at the boundary between
the partition into 1 and −1, then p, if prime, would be a Pythagorean prime.
The p-adic
theory underpinning the symbolic bit string representations of the quantum state has not been
developed in suﬃcient detail to be able to make more precise observations of the relationship
between p and N than this.
However, numerical estimates of N and hence p are made in
Section 3.5.
With this geometric link established, the discretised model is henceforth referred to by the
name ‘invariant set theory’ [26].
3.5
The Quantum Mechanical and Classical Limits of Invariant
Set Theory and the size of N
The quantum mechanical limit of invariant set theory occurs when N is set equal to inﬁnity.
At this limit, the whole of complex Hilbert space is part of the state space of the theory, the
rationality conditions become nulliﬁed and we are simply left with the state space of quantum
mechanics. However, it is important to understand that N = ∞is a singular limit. Invariant
set theory does not steadily approach quantum mechanics as N gets bigger and bigger, since
the constraints of Niven’s theorem holds no matter how large is N. Berry [2] has noted that
singular limits are commonplace in physics and that frequently an old theory is a singular limit
of a new theory as a parameter of the new theory is set equal to zero or inﬁnity.
How large is N if is not inﬁnite? One can start by considering a minimum size ϵ0 for an
ϵ-disk. We know that attempts to measure a quantum system on scales smaller than the Planck
scale will require such a concentration of energy as to form a black hole. This suggests that
ϵ0 and hence the largest value N could be is set by gravity. This in turn suggests that N is
a function of the energy E of the quantum system under consideration, i.e., N ∼E/EPlanck.
For an infrared photon this would give N ∼1026 and for a quantum system with Compton
wavelength equal to the diameter of the observable universe (N ∼1062).
The classical limit of invariant set theory occurs at N = 1, when the fractal structure
of trajectories disappears. Then we simply revert to single state-space trajectories without
internal structure. This would occur for quantum systems where E ≥EPlanck, i.e. for particles
whose mass exceeds about 22 µg (for comparison, a tardigrade has mass about 10 µg). In this
sense, invariant set theory predicts that quantum systems with detectable self gravitation will
not show quantum mechanical properties. The notion that N (and hence p) is in part set by
the strength of gravity is consistent with the conjecture that the clustering of trajectories on
IU, associated with the measurement process, is itself a gravitational phenomenon [7] [27].
15

In Section 2.4, it was noted that a general K qubit state was described by K bit strings
of length 2K+1N. If we take the largest value of 2K+1N to be 1062 ∼2205, and the smallest
value of N as 1, then this will imply a maximum value Kmax of K to be around 200 (before
the degrees of freedom become restricted by the maximum length of a bit string). Of course
the size of the observable universe is not the same as the size of the universe, and we do not
even know if the latter is ﬁnite. However, if it is ﬁnite, invariant set theory predicts that the
exponential increase in the number of freedom will eventually cease. Some estimates based on
Bayesian model averaging suggests a largest size at least some 250 greater than the observable
size. However, a factor 250 only increases Kmax by about 8. Hence, depending on the size of
the universe, it may not be possible to build a general purpose quantum computer with more
than a few hundred qubits.

Entangled qubits and nonlocality
4.1
Bell’s Theorem
In quantum mechanics, the Bell state is given by
|ψBell⟩=
1
√
2
 | 1⟩| −1⟩+ | −1⟩|1⟩

(32)
In invariant set theory, consistent with Section (2.4), |ψBell⟩is associated with a pair of bit
strings of length 8N (one for experimenter Alice and one for experimenter Bob)
Ba =
i(ma)
1
( 1) || i(ma)
1
(−1)
Bb =
i(mb)
1
(−1) || i(mb)
1
(
1)
(33)
From (33) it is straightforwardly seen that Ba and Bb contain equal numbers of 1 and −1 bits
for all values of the free parameters ma and mb. In addition, the correlation between Ba and
Bb is equal to |mb −ma|/N −1. As such, we can represent Ba and Bb as a pair of points on
a 2-sphere whose angular separation is θab such that cos θab = 1 −|mb −ma|/N ∈Q. These
two points will correspond to the (exact) orientations of the experimenters’ Alice and Bob’s
measuring apparatuses.
For each run of a CHSH experiment, the experimenters Alice and Bob choose one of two
possible spin measurements to perform, denoted by x and y, where x, y ∈{0, 1}. Such x and
y deﬁne the nominal orientations of SG devices/polarisers. As before, we treat these choices
x = 0, x = 1, y = 0 and y = 1 as four small ϵ-disks on the 2-sphere of measurement orienta-
tions. We label Alice and Bob’s measurement outcomes as a and b where a, b ∈{1, −1}. From
(33), for any run of the experiment there exist a pair of exact measurement orientations whose
relative orientation satisﬁes cos θab = 1 −|mb −ma|/N. As before, although the discretised
model requires cos θab to be rational, Alice and Bob do not have any direct control over the ra-
tionality or irrationality of cos θab. Rather rationality is inevitably associated with the model’s
representation of the real world.
Since we can represent quantum mechanical Bell states to arbitrary precision in invariant
set theory, then, for large enough N, the violation of Bell’s inequality is as close to quantum
mechanics as we like. In the rest of this section we show that this comes about from a violation
of the Statistical Independence (SI) assumption
ρ(λ|x y) = ρ(λ)
(34)
16

where ρ(λ) is a probability density on the hidden variables. In particular, it does not come
about from a violation of local causality
a = A(λ, x);
b = B(λ, y)
(35)
where A and B denote deterministic functions and λ hidden variables. The locality condition
expresses the idea that the outcome of Alice’s measurements do not depend on Bob’s choices
or vice versa. As discussed, the violation of Statistical Independence is non-conspiratorial, that
is to say, it does not depend on Alice and Bob making ‘just the right choices’. Instead there
is nothing in the analysis below to prevent Alice and Bob from chosing as they like. In this
sense the hidden variables are not akin to some ‘alien mind control’ as some observers imagine
a violation of SI to be.
From (35), the hidden variables are those which help determine measurement outcomes,
but over which the experimenters have no direct control. Following the analysis of the Mach-
Zehnder and the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the hidden variable of Alice’s particle is associated
with the exact measurement setting x∗relative to the ϵ-disk x (the hidden variable associated
with Bob’s particle is associated with the exact setting y∗relative to y).
Fig 5b illustrates a particular run of the experiment (particular λ) where Alice chooses
x = 0 and Bob y = 0. According to invariant set theory there exist pairs of points inside the
ϵ-disks associated with x = 0 and y = 0, such that the cosine of the angular distance between
the exact points is rational. There will be as many such points as we like for large enough N.
Let x∗
0 and y∗
0 denote two possible exact points. Hence ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 0) ̸= 0 in the model,
consistent with what happens in the real world, where λ is associated with the pair {x∗
0, y∗
0}.
Consider now the counterfactual world where, for the same particle pair, i.e., the same
λ, Alice chose x = 0, as she did in the real world, but Bob chose y = 1. If SI holds, then
ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 1) = ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 0) ̸= 0. According to the discussion above, ﬁxing λ and
ﬁxing x = 0 means ﬁxing the exact point x∗
0 in the ϵ-disk x = 0. If ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 1) ̸= 0, then
ﬁxing λ and varying y = 0 to y = 1, there must exist an exact point y∗
1 in the ϵ disk y = 1 such
that the cosine of the angular distance between x∗
0 and y∗
1 is rational. As before there are many
such possibilities, Fig 5 shows one choice for y∗
1. Hence, for Bob’s counterfactual choice y = 1
we can additionally associate λ with the exact orientation y∗
1, and hence λ is now associated
with the triple {x∗
0, y∗
0, y∗
1}. With this, ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 1) ̸= 0 consistent with (34).
Consider now a second counterfactual world where, again keeping λ ﬁxed, Alice chose x = 1
and Bob y = 0. Keeping λ ﬁxed, we keep ﬁxed the exact orientation y∗
0 in the ϵ-disk y = 0.
If ρ(λ|x = 1 y = 0) ̸= 0, then ﬁxing λ and varying x = 0 to x = 1, there must exist an exact
orientation x∗
1 in the ϵ disk x = 1 such that the cosine of the angular distance between y∗
0 and
x∗
1 is rational. As before there are many such possibilities, Fig 5b shows one choice for x∗
1.
Hence, for Alice’s counterfactual choice x = 1 we can associate λ with the exact choice x∗
1 and
hence λ is now associated with the quadruple {x∗
0, x∗
1, y∗
0, y∗
1}. With this, ρ(λ|x = 1, y = 0) ̸= 0
consistent with (34).
So far SI has not been violated. However, ﬁnally, consider the third counterfactual world
where, keeping λ ﬁxed, Alice chose x = 1 and Bob y = 1. Now both of the exact orientations
inside the ϵ disks x = 1 and y = 1 have already been ﬁxed (see Fig 5b). Hence we have no
free choices left. If ρ(λ|x = 1 y = 1) ̸= 0, it must be the case that the cosine of the angular
distance between x∗
1 and y∗
1 is rational. However, this cannot be the case as a straightforward
generalisation of the Impossible Triangle Corollary shows.
Corollary. Let x∗
0, x∗
1, y∗
0, y∗
1 denote 4 exact points inside the ϵ disks, x = 0, x = 1, y = 0,
y = 1 respectively, such that cos θx∗
0y∗
0 , cos θx∗
0y∗
1 and cos θx∗
1y∗
0 are rational. If φx∗
0 and φx∗
1 are
independent rational angles subtended by the great circles at x∗
0 and x∗
1 then cos θx∗

1 /∈Q.
Proof. As before, we give a proof by contradiction and assume cos θx∗
1y∗
1 is rational. Using
the cosine rule for the two triangles △(x∗
0y∗
0y∗
1) and △(x∗
1y∗
0y∗
1), we have two expressions for
17

Figure 5: a) An schematic set up for the CHSH Bell experiment with nominal measurement settings

Bob y = 0. The points x∗
0, y∗
0, x∗
1, y∗
1, one within each of the ϵ disks, denote exact settings for
some particular value of λ. The cosines of the angular distances between x∗
0 and y∗
0, between x∗
0
and y∗
1, and between x∗
1 and y∗
0, are all rational. However, given this, the cosine of the angular
distance between x∗
1 and y∗
1 cannot be rational. Hence, with λ ﬁxed (i.e., x∗
0, y∗
0, x∗
1, y∗
1 ﬁxed),
0 = ρ(λ|x = 1 y = 1) ̸= ρ(λ|x = 0 y = 0) ̸= 0 and Statistical Independence (34) is violated. Alice’s
exact measurement setting x∗
0 and hence measurement outcome (when she chooses x = 0) does not
depend on whether Bob chooses y = 0 or y = 1. Hence the model satisﬁes the locality condition
(35).

rational if the two individual summands are rational. Squaring the individual summands then
we deduce that cos 2φx∗
0 and cos 2φx∗
1 must both be rational. As discussed in the Impossible
Triangle Corollary, this contradicts the assumption that φx∗
0 and φx∗
1 are rational angles. Hence
cos θx∗
1y∗
1 /∈Q.
Hence ρ(λ|x = 1 y = 1) = 0 and SI is violated.
We now show that this model satisﬁes locality (35). In Fig 5b) it can be seen that the exact
measurement setting x∗
0 - the setting associated with Alice’s particle’s hidden variable - does
not depend on whether Bob chose y = 0 or y = 1; either choice is allowed for a ﬁxed x∗
0 as
evidenced by the two solid lines emanating from x∗
0. Similarly, the exact measurement setting
y∗
0 - Bob’s particle’s hidden variable - does not depend on whether Alice chose x = 0 or x = 1;
either choice is allowed for a ﬁxed y∗
0. Hence, the measurement outcome a does not depend on
Bob’s choice y, nor b depend on Alice’s choice x. This is a statement that local causality holds.
More generally, if ¯x = 1 −x, ¯y = 1 −y, then
ρ(λ|x, y) ̸= 0;
ρ(λ|x, ¯y) ̸= 0;
ρ(λ|¯x, y) ̸= 0
(38)
implies
ρ(λ|¯x, ¯y) = 0
(39)
It is worth noting that the proof of the violation of Statistical Independence in the original
Bell inequality [1] can be derived directly from the Impossible Triangle Corollary and does not
require the extension above. In particular, the three ϵ-disks in Fig 2 c) correspond to the three
nominal settings in the original Bell inequality. Exactly the same argument applies.
As mentioned, there is nothing to constrain Alice and Bob’s choices of nominal settings.
They can chose as they like (e.g, on the wavelength of light from distant quasars, or from the
Dow Jones index, or any whimsical alternative). However, the exact measurement settings and
hence the hidden variables are constrained by these choices. This does not occur in classical
mechanics: throwing a stone with a certain nominal speed does not limit the set of exact
solutions to the governing equations where the stone was thrown faster or slower. Importantly,
this constraint on exact settings does not imply any breakdown of local causality in space-time
- once again, the model satisﬁes the locality condition (35). Quantum physicists may wish to
use the word ‘nonlocality’ to describe this global state-space geometric constraint. However,
it should not be conﬂated with some unattractive and implausible action-at-a-distance which
was the basis of Einstein’s dislike of quantum mechanics.
A model which violates Statistical Independence is sometimes called ‘superdeterministic’
[17] though here the term ‘supermeasured’ [13] is to be preferred as this refers to the notion
that the dynamics must respect the invariant measure associated with IU. This violation of
Statistical Independence does not imply some kind of ﬁne-tuned conspiracy. For one thing, as
mentioned, Alice and Bob can chose as they like. In addition, as discussed above, the natural
metric on the state space of this discretised model is p-adic and bit strings which do not satisfy
the rationality conditions are p-adically distant from those that do. This is not a conspiracy; it
is an elegant interpretation of an otherwise problematic experiment in quantum foundations.

vertical and horizontal polarisation. Through the unitary transformation

linear polarisation measurements can be made on any one of the three photons at angle φ to
the v/h axis. This requires cos2 φ and hence cos 2φ to be rational. Conversely, through the

it is possible to make circular polarisation measurements on the other two photons.
The resulting correlations are impossible to explain with a hidden variable theory if we
assume that the ﬁrst photon could have been measured relative to the L/R basis. However,

As in the discussion in Section 3.1, there is a number theoretic inconsistency which prevents
linear and circular polarisation being simultaneously measured: φ can be a rational angle, or
it can have a rational cosine.
We do not have to give up deterministic realism to explain GHZ in this discretised picture
of quantum physics.

Discussion
This work was motivated by a belief that the synthesis of quantum and gravitational physics
will require more give from the quantum side and less from the gravitational side. Here we
have ‘second quantised’ quantum mechanics in an unconventional way: by discretising complex
Hilbert space. The particular discretisation leads to an inherent number-theoretic incommen-
surateness between complex amplitudes and complex phases. The discretisation allows complex
Hilbert states to be given an ensemble interpretation, and the incommensurateness generates
all the conventional properties of quantum systems typically associated with the algebra of Her-
mitian operators in complex Hilbert Space, but without invoking such an algebra. Importantly,
with this discretisation, it is no longer necessary to interpret the violation of Bell inequalities
as implying a breakdown of causal realism in space-time, making the discretised model more
consistent with the causal determinism of general relativity than is quantum mechanics.
Although the experimental consequences of this discretised theory can be made identical
to quantum physics by setting the parameter N to a large enough value, here estimates of N
have been given that lead to experimentally testable diﬀerences from quantum mechanics: that
20

systems with masses greater the Planck mass will not exhibit quantum properties, and that
general purpose noise-free quantum computers may in principle be limited to a few hundred
qubits. The latter invokes the fact that the discretised theory has a geometric underpinning,
describing the fractal invariant set of the universe.
There is one further implication of this fractal geometry worth commenting on here. Con-
sider a state space trajectory at some low level of fractal iteration and zoom into it with higher
and higher magniﬁcation. At the next level of fractal iteration the trajectory appears as a
helix of trajectories, i.e., as an ensemble. At the next level of iteration the trajectory again
returns to appear as a single curve. A trajectory vacillates between a single curve and a helix
ensemble as the zoom proceeds. This means that the laws of physics similarly should vacillate
between being classical-like and quantum-like. This gives a very diﬀerent picture to the usual
one, where classical theories are assumed to be less fundamental than quantum theories. The
author intends to expand on this in more detail elsewhere.
Although a radical modiﬁcation of quantum mechanics has been proposed, there has to be
some modiﬁcation to general relativity to make it compatible with this discretised version of
quantum physics. Most importantly, the energy-momentum tensor on the right hand side of
the ﬁeld equations should describe not only energy-momentum distributions in our space time
M, but energy-momentum distributions on space-times M′ in the neighbourhood of our space
time, on the p-adic geometry in state space, suitably weighted with a suitable Haar measure
ρH, i.e.,
Gµν(M) = 8π
Z
M′ dM′ ρH(M, M′) Tµν(M′)
(44)
In the classical (N = 1) limit of GR, ρH(M, M′) = δ(M −M′).
Whether the diﬀerence
between ρH(M, M′) and δ(M −M′) can help explain the existence of dark matter (as regular
matter on neighbouring space-times on IU, having a gravitational eﬀect in our space-time)
remains to be seen.
