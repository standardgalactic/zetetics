Preface
The purpose of this little book is to provide an introduction to the basic concepts of
category theory. It is intended for the graduate student, advanced undergraduate
student, nonspecialist mathematician or scientist working in a need-to-know area.
The treatment is abstract in nature, with examples drawn mainly from abstract
algebra. Although there are no formal prerequisites for this book, a basic knowledge
of elementary abstract algebra would be of considerable help, especially in dealing
with the exercises.
Category theory is a relatively young subject, founded in the mid 1940s, with the
lofty goals of uniﬁcation, clariﬁcation and efﬁciency in mathematics. Indeed,
Saunders MacLane, one of the founding fathers of category theory (along with
Samuel Eilenberg), says in the ﬁrst sentence of his book Categories for the Working
Mathematician: “Category theory starts with the observation that many properties
of mathematical systems can be uniﬁed and simpliﬁed by a presentation with
diagrams of arrows.” Of course, uniﬁcation and simpliﬁcation are common themes
throughout mathematics.
To illustrate these concepts, consider three sets with a binary operation:
1) the set ∗of nonzero real numbers under multiplication
2) the set M(n, k) of n  k matrices over the complex numbers under addition
and
3) the set B of bijections of the integers under composition.
Now, very few mathematicians would take the time to prove that inverse
elements are unique in each of these cases—They would simply note that each of
these is an example of a group and prove in one quick line that the inverse of any
element in any group is unique, to wit, if α and β are inverses for the group element
a, then
α ¼ α1 ¼ α αβ
ð
Þ ¼ αa
ð
Þβ ¼ 1β ¼ β
This at once clariﬁes the role of uniqueness of inverses by showing that this property
has nothing whatever to do with real numbers, matrices or bijections. It has to do
only with associativity and the identity property. This also uniﬁes the concept of
uniqueness of inverses because it shows that uniqueness of inverses in each of these
three cases is really a single concept. Finally, it makes life more efﬁcient for
mathematicians because they can prove uniqueness of inverses for all groups in
one fell swoop, as it were.
Category theory attempts to do the same for all of mathematics (well, perhaps
not all) as group theory does for the case described above.
But there is a problem. It has been my experience that most students of
mathematics and the sciences (and even some mathematicians) ﬁnd category
theory to be very challenging indeed, primarily due to its extremely abstract nature.
We must remember that the vast majority of students are not seeking to be category
theorists—They are seeking a “modest” understanding of the basic concepts of
vii

category theory so that they can apply these ideas to their chosen area of specialty.
This book attempts to supply this understanding in as gentle a manner as possible.
We envision this book as being used as independent reading or as a supple-
mentary text for graduate courses in other areas. It could also be used as the
textbook for either a short course or a leisurely one-quarter course in category
theory.
The Five Basic Concepts of Category
Theory
It can be said that there are ﬁve basic concepts in category theory, namely,
•
Categories
•
Functors
•
Natural transformations
•
Universality
•
Adjoints
Some would argue that each of these concepts was “invented” or “discovered” in
order to produce the next concept in this list. For example, Saunders MacLane
himself is reported to have said: “I did not invent category theory to talk about
functors. I invented it to talk about natural transformations.”
Whether this be true or not, many students of mathematics are ﬁnding that the
language of category theory is popping up in many of their classes in abstract
algebra, lattice theory, number theory, differential geometry, algebraic topology and
more. Also, category theory has become an important topic of study for many
computer scientists and even for some mathematical physicists. Hopefully, this
book will ﬁll a need for those who require an understanding of the basic concepts of
the subject. If the need or desire should arise, one can then turn to more lengthy and
advanced treatments of the subject.
A Word About Definitions
To my mind, there are two types of deﬁnitions. Standard deﬁnitions are, well,
standard. They are intended to be in common usage and last through the ages.
However, after about 40 years of teaching and the writing of about 40 books, I have
come to believe in the virtue of nonstandard, temporary, ad hoc deﬁnitions that are
primarily intended for pedagogical purposes, although one can hope that some ad
hoc deﬁnitions turn out to be so useful that they eventually become a standard part
of the subject matter.
Let me illustrate a nonstandard deﬁnition. One of the most important (some
would say the most important) concepts in category theory is that of an adjoint.
There are left adjoints and right adjoints, but the two concepts come together in
something called an adjunction.
viii
Preface

Now, there are many approaches to discussing adjoints and adjunctions. In my
experience, adjunctions are usually just deﬁned without much preliminary leg work.
However, one of the goals of this book is to make the more difﬁcult concepts, such
as that of an adjunction a bit more palatable by “sneaking up” on them, as it were.
In order to do this with adjunctions, we gently transition through the following
concepts,
initial objects in comma categories ! universality ! naturalness !
binaturalness adjunctions
ð
Þ
During this transition process, we will ﬁnd it extremely useful to use certain maps
that, to my knowledge, do not have a speciﬁc name. So this is the perfect place to
introduce a nonstandard deﬁnition, which in this case is the mediating morphism
map.
The only downside to making nonstandard deﬁnitions is that they are not going
to be recognized outside the context of this book and therefore must be used very
circumspectly. But I think that is a small price to pay if they help the learning
process.
That said, I will use nonstandard deﬁnitions only as often as I feel absolutely
necessary and will try to identify them as such upon ﬁrst use, either by the term
“nonstandard” or by a phrase such as “we will refer to . . .”.
Thanks
I would like to thank my students Phong Le, Sunil Chetty, Timothy Choi, Josh
Chan, Tim Tran and Zachary Faubion, who attended my lectures on a much
expanded version of this book and offered many helpful suggestions.

Foundations
Before giving the deﬁnition of a category, we must brieﬂy (and somewhat informally) discuss a
notion from the foundations of mathematics. In category theory, one often wishes to speak of
“the category of (all) sets” or “the category of (all) groups.” However, it is well known that these
descriptions cannot be made precise within the context of sets alone.
In particular, not all “collections” that one can deﬁne informally through the use of the
English language, or even formally through the use of the language of set theory, can be
considered sets without producing some well-known logical paradoxes, such as the Russell
paradox of 1901 (discovered by Zermelo a year earlier). More speciﬁcally, if φ(x) is a well-
formed formula of set theory, then the collection
X ¼
sets x
 φ x
ð Þ is true


cannot always be viewed as a set. For example, the family of all sets, or of all groups, cannot be
considered a set. Nonetheless, it is desirable to be able to apply some of the operations of sets,
such as union and cartesian product, to such families. One way to achieve this goal is through
the notion of a class. Every set is a class and the classes that are not sets are called proper
classes. Now we can safely speak of the class of all sets, or the class of all groups. Classes have
many of the properties of sets. However, while every set is an element of another set, no class
can be an element of another class. We can now state that the family X deﬁned above is a class
without apparent contradiction.
Another way to avoid the problems posed by the logical paradoxes is to use the concept of
a set U called a universe. The elements of U are called small sets. Some authors refer to
the subsets of U as sets and some use the term classes. In order to carry out “ordinary
mathematics” within the universe U, it is assumed to be closed under the basic operations of
set theory, such as the taking of ordered pairs, power sets and unions.
These two approaches to the problem of avoiding the logical paradoxes result in essentially
the same theory and so we will generally use the language of sets and classes, rather than
universes.
The Definition
We can now give the deﬁnition of a category.
1
1

1 Definition
A category C consists of the following:
1) (Objects) A class Obj C
ð Þ whose elements are called the objects. It is customary to write
A 2 C in place of A 2 Obj C
ð Þ.
2) (Morphisms) For each (not necessarily distinct) pair of objects A, B 2 C, a set homC A; B
ð
Þ,
called the hom-set for the pair (A, B). The elements of homC A; B
ð
Þ are called morphisms,
maps or arrows from A to B. If f 2 homC A; B
ð
Þ, we also write
f: A ! B
or
fAB
The object A ¼ dom(f) is called the domain of f and the object B ¼ codom(f ) is called the
codomain of f.
3) Distinct hom-sets are disjoint, that is, homC A; B
ð
Þ and homC C; D
ð
Þ are disjoint unless
A ¼ C and B ¼ D.
4) (Composition) For f 2 homC A; B
ð
Þ and g 2 homC B; C
ð
Þ there is a morphism
g ∘f 2 homC A; C
ð
Þ, called the composition of g with f. Moreover, composition
is associative:
f∘g ∘h
ð
Þ ¼ f ∘g
ð
Þ ∘h
whenever the compositions are deﬁned.
5) (Identity morphisms) For each object A 2 C there is a morphism 1A 2 homC A; A
ð
Þ, called
the identity morphism for A, with the property that if f AB 2 homC A; B
ð
Þ then
1B ∘fAB ¼ fAB
and
fAB ∘1A ¼ fAB
The class of all morphisms of C is denoted by Mor C
ð Þ.
□
A variety of notations are used in the literature for hom-sets, including
A; B
ð
Þ,
A; B
½
,
C A; B
ð
Þ
and
Mor A; B
ð
Þ
(We will drop the subscript C in homC when no confusion will arise.)
We should mention that not all authors require property 3) in the deﬁnition of a category.
Also, some authors permit the hom-sets to be classes. In this case, the categories for which the
hom-classes are sets is called a locally small category. Thus, all of our categories are locally
small. A category C for which both the class Obj C
ð Þ and the class Mor C
ð Þ are sets is called a
small category. Otherwise, C is called a large category.
Two arrows belonging to the same hom-set hom(A, B) are said to be parallel. We use the
phrase “f is a morphism leaving A” to mean that the domain of f is A and “f is a morphism
entering B” to mean that the codomain of f is B.
When we speak of a composition g ∘f, it is with the tacit understanding that the
morphisms are compatible, that is, dom(g) ¼ codom(f).
The concept of a category is very general. Here are some examples of categories. In most
cases, composition is the “obvious” one. We suggest that you just skim this list of examples at
this point. If you are not familiar with some of the concepts in these example (such as smooth
manifolds), not to worry. The purpose of this list is to give you a general idea of the wide range
of categories in mathematics.

□
1 Example 2
The category of all categories does not exist, on foundational grounds. The well-known Russell
paradox shows that the set of all sets does not exist and an analogous argument has been
constructed to show that the category of all categories does not exist. However, the argument is
a bit involved and is not really in the spirit of this introductory book, so we will not go into the
details. On the other hand, the class S of all small categories does form the objects of another
category, whose morphisms are called functors, to be deﬁned a bit later in the chapter.
□
Here are some slightly more unusual categories.
1 Example 3
Let F be a ﬁeld. The category MatrF of matrices over F has objects equal to the set ℤþ
of positive integers. For m, n 2 ℤþ, the hom-set hom(m, n) is the set of all n  m matrices
over F, composition being matrix multiplication. Why do we reverse the roles of m and n?
Well, if M 2 hom(m, n) and N 2 hom(n, k), then M has size n  m and N has size k  n
and so the product NM makes sense and has size k  m, that is, it belongs to hom(m, k), as
required. Incidentally, this is a case in which the category is named after its morphisms, rather
than its objects.
□
1 Example 4
A single monoid M deﬁnes a category with a single object M, where each element is a
morphism. We deﬁne the composition a ∘b to be the product ab. This example applies to
other algebraic structures, such as groups. All that is required is that there be an identity
element and that the operation be associative.
□
1 Example 5
Let (P, ) be a partially ordered set. The objects of the category Poset(P, ) are the elements of
P. Also, hom(a, b) is empty unless a  b, in which case hom(a, b) contains a single element,
denoted by ab. Note that the hom-sets specify the relation  on P. As to composition, there is
really only one choice: If ab: a ! b and bc: b ! c then it follows that a  b  c and so a  c,
which implies that hom(a, c) 6¼ ;. Thus, we set bc ∘ab ¼ ac. The hom-set hom(a, a) contains
only the identity morphism for the object a.
As a speciﬁc example, you may recall that each positive natural number n 2 ℕis deﬁned to
be the set of all natural numbers that preceed it:
n ¼ 0, 1, . . . , n  1
f
g
4
Chapter 1· Categories
1

and the natural number 0 is deﬁned to be the empty set. Thus, natural numbers are ordered by
membership, that is, m < n if and only if m 2 n and so n is the set of all natural numbers less
than n. Each natural number n deﬁnes a category whose objects are its elements and whose
morphisms describe this order relation. The category n is sometimes denoted by bold face n.□
1 Example 6
A category for which there is at most one morphism between every pair of (not necessarily
distinct) objects is called a preordered category (some authors use the term thin category). If
C is a thin category, then we can use the existence of a morphism to deﬁne a binary relation on
the objects of C, namely, A ⪯B if there exists a morphism from A to B. It is clear that this
relation is reﬂexive and transitive. Such relations are called preorders. (The term preorder is
used in a different sense in combinatorics.)
Conversely, any preordered class (P, ⪯) is a category, where the objects are the elements of
P and there is a morphism fAB from A to B if and only if A ⪯B (and there are no other
morphisms). Reﬂexivity provides the identity morphisms and transitivity provides the
composition.
More generally, if C is any category, then we can use the existence of a morphism to deﬁne
a preorder on the objects of C, namely, A ⪯B if there is at least one morphism from A to B.□
1 Example 7
Consider a deductive logic system, such as the propositional calculus. We can deﬁne two
different categories as follows. In both cases, the well-formed formulas (wffs) of the system are
the objects of the category. In one case, there is one morphism from the wff α to the wff β if and
only if we can deduce β given α. In the other case, we deﬁne a morphism from α to β to be a
speciﬁc deduction of β from α, that is, a speciﬁc ordered list of wffs starting with α and ending
with β for which each wff in the list is either an axiom of the system or is deducible from the
previous wffs in the list using the rules of deduction of the system.
□
The Categorical Perspective
The notion of a category is extremely general. However, the deﬁnition is precisely what is
needed to set the correct stage for the following two key tenets of mathematics:
1) Morphisms (e.g. linear transformations, group homomorphisms, monotone maps) play an
essentially equal role alongside the mathematical structures that they morph (e.g. vector
spaces, groups, partially ordered sets).
2) Many mathematical notions are best described in terms of morphisms between structures
rather than in terms of the individual elements of these structures.
In order to implement the second tenet, one must grow accustomed to the idea of focusing
on the appropriate maps between mathematical structures and not on the elements of these
structures. For example, as we will see in due course, such important notions as a basis for a
vector space, a direct product of vector spaces, the ﬁeld of fractions of an integral domain and
the quotient of a group by a normal subgroup can be described using maps rather than
elements. In fact, many of the most important properties of these notions follow from their
morphism-based descriptions.
Note also that one of the consequences of the second tenet is that important mathematical
notions tend to be deﬁned only up to isomorphism, rather than uniquely.
The Definition
5
1

An immediate example seems in order, even though it may take some time (and further
reading) to place in proper perspective.
1 Example 8
Let V and W be vector spaces over a ﬁeld F. The external direct product of V and W is usually
deﬁned in elementary linear algebra books as the set of ordered pairs
V  W ¼
v; w
ð
Þ
v 2 V , w 2 W


with componentwise operations:
v; w
ð
Þ þ v0; w0
ð
Þ ¼ v þ v0, w þ w0
ð
Þ
and
r v; w
ð
Þ ¼ rv, rw
ð
Þ
for r 2 F. One then deﬁnes the projection maps
ρ1: V  W ! V
and
ρ2: V  W ! W
by
ρ1 v; w
ð
Þ ¼ v
and
ρ2 v; w
ð
Þ ¼ w
However, the importance of these projection maps is not always made clear, so let us do
this now.
As shown in Figure 1, the ordered triple (V  W, ρV, ρW) has the following universal
property: Given any vector space X over F and any “projection-like” pair of linear trans-
formations
σ1: X ! V
and
σ2: X ! W
Figure 1
6
Chapter 1· Categories
1

from X to V and W, respectively, there is a unique linear transformation τ: X ! V  W for
which
ρ1 ∘τ ¼ σ1
and
ρ2 ∘τ ¼ σ2
Indeed, these two equations uniquely determine τ(x) for any x 2 X because
τ x
ð Þ ¼ ρ1 τ x
ð Þ
ð
Þ, ρ2 τ x
ð Þ
ð
Þ
ð
Þ ¼ σ1 x
ð Þ, σ2 x
ð Þ
ð
Þ
It remains only to show that τ is linear, which follows easily from the fact that σ1 and σ2 are
linear. Now, the categorical perspective is that this universal property is the essence of the direct
product, at least up to isomorphism. In fact, it is not hard to show that if an ordered triple
U, λ1: U ! V , λ2: U ! W
ð
Þ
has the universal property described above, that is, if for any vector space X over F and any
pair of linear transformations
σ1: X ! V
and
σ2: X ! W
there is a unique linear transformation τ: X ! U for which
λ1 ∘τ ¼ σ1
and
λ2 ∘τ ¼ σ2
then U and V  W are isomorphic as vector spaces. Indeed, in some more advanced treatments
of linear algebra, the direct product of vector spaces is deﬁned as any triple that satisﬁes this
universal property. Note that, using this deﬁnition, the direct product is deﬁned only up to
isomorphism.
If this example seems to be a bit overwhelming now, don’t be discouraged. It can take
a while to get accustomed to the categorical way of thinking. It might help to redraw Figure 1
a few times without looking at the book.
□
Functors
If we are going to live by the two main tenets of category theory described above, we should
discuss morphisms between categories! Structure-preserving maps between categories are
called functors. At this time, however, there is much to say about categories as individual
entities, so we will brieﬂy describe functors now and return to them in detail in a later chapter.
The unabridged dictionary deﬁnes the term functor, from the New Latin functus (past
participle of fungi: to perform) as “something that performs a function or operation.” The term
functor was apparently ﬁrst used by the German philosopher Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) to
represent a special type of function sign. In category theory, the term functor was introduced by
Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane in their paper Natural Isomorphisms in Group
Theory [8].
Functors
7
1

Since the structure of a category consists of both its objects and its morphisms, a functor
should map objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms. This requires two different maps.
Also, there are two versions of functors: covariant and contravariant.
1 Definition
Let C and D be categories. A functor F : C ) D is a pair of functions (as is customary, we use
the same symbol F for both functions):
1) The object part of the functor
F : Obj C
ð Þ ! Obj D
ð Þ
maps objects in C to objects in D
2) The arrow part
F : Mor C
ð Þ ! Mor D
ð Þ
maps morphisms in C to morphisms in D as follows:
a) For a covariant functor,
F : homC A; B
ð
Þ ! homD FA, FB
ð
Þ
for all A, B 2 C, that is, F maps a morphism f: A ! B in C to a morphism Ff: FA ! FB
in D.
b) For a contravariant functor,
F: homC A; B
ð
Þ ! homD FB, FA
ð
Þ
for all A, B 2 C, that is, F maps a morphism f: A ! B in C to a morphism Ff: FB ! FA
in D. (Note the reversal of direction).
We will refer to the restriction of F to homC A; B
ð
Þ as a local arrow part of F.
3) Identity and composition are preserved, that is,
F1A ¼ 1FA
and for a covariant functor,
F g ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ Fg ∘Ff
and for a contravariant functor,
F g ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ Ff ∘Fg
whenever all compositions are deﬁned.
□
As is customary, we use the same symbol F for both the object part and the arrow part of a
functor. We will also use a double arrow notation for functors. Thus, the expression F: C ) D

Chapter 1· Categories

implies that C and D are categories and is read “F is a functor from C to D.” (For readability’s
sake in ﬁgures, we use a thick arrow to denote functors.)
A functor F : C ) C from C to itself is referred to as a functor on C. A functor F : C ) Set
is called a set valued functor. We say that functors F, G: C ) D with the same domain
and the same codomain are parallel and functors of the form F : C ) D and G: D ) C are
antiparallel.
The term covariant appears to have been ﬁrst used in 1853 by James Joseph Sylvester (who
was quite fond of coining new terms) as follows: “Covariant, a function which stands in the
same relation to the primitive function from which it is derived as any of its linear transforms
do to a similarly derived transform of its primitive.” In plainer terms, an operation is covariant
if it varies in a way that preserves some related structure or operation. In the present context, a
covariant functor preserves the direction of arrows and a contravariant functor reverses the
direction of arrows.
One way to view the concept of a functor is to think of a (covariant) functor F : C ) D as a
mapping of one-arrow diagrams in C,
A !
f B
to one-arrow diagrams in D,
FA !
Ff FB
with the property that “identity loops” and “triangles” are preserved, as shown in Figure 2.
A similar statement holds for contravariant functors.
Composition of Functors
Functors can be composed in the “obvious” way. Speciﬁcally, if F : C ) D and G: D ) E are
functors, then G ∘F: C ) E is deﬁned by
G ∘F

Special Types of Functors
1 Definition
Let F: C ) D be a functor.
1) F is full if all of its local arrow parts are surjective.
2) F is faithful if all of its local arrow parts are injective.
3) F is fully faithful (i.e., full and faithful) if all of its local arrow parts are bijective.
4) F is an embedding of C in D if it is fully faithful and the object part of F is injective.
□
We should note that the term embedding, as applied to functors, is deﬁned differently by
different authors. Some authors deﬁne an embedding simply as a full and faithful functor.
Other authors deﬁne an embedding to be a faithful functor whose object part is injective. We
have adopted the strongest deﬁnition, since it applies directly to the important Yoneda lemma
(coming later in the book).
Note that a faithful functor F: C ) D need not be an embedding, for it can send two
morphisms from different hom sets to the same morphism in D. For instance, if FA ¼ FA0 and
FB ¼ FB0 then it may happen that
FfAB ¼ FgA0B0
which does not violate the condition of faithfulness. Also, a full functor need not be surjective
on Mor C
ð Þ.
A Couple of Examples
Here are a couple of examples of functors. We will give more examples in the next chapter.
1 Example 9
The power set functor ℘: Set ) Set sends a set A to its power set ℘(A) and sends each set
function f: A ! B to the induced function f: ℘(A) ! ℘(B) that sends X to fX. (It is
customary to use the same notation for the function and its induced version.) It is easy to see
that this deﬁnes a faithful but not full covariant functor.
Similarly, the contravariant power set functor F : Set ) Set sends a set A to its power set
℘(A) and a set function f : A ! B to the induced inverse function f 1: ℘(B) ! ℘(A) that
sends X  B to f 1X  A. The fact that F is contravariant follows from the well known fact
that
f ∘g
ð
Þ1 ¼ g1 ∘f1

1 Example 10
The following situation is quite common. Let C be a category. Suppose that D is another
category with the property that every object in C is an object in D and every morphism
f: A ! B in C is a morphism f: A ! B in D.
For instance, every object in Grp is also an object in Set: we simply ignore the group
operation. Also, every group homomorphism is a set function. Similarly, every ring can be
thought of as an abelian group by ignoring the ring multiplication and every ring map can be
thought of as a group homomorphism.
We can then deﬁne a functor F : C ) D by sending an object A 2 C to itself, thought of as
an object in D and a morphism f : A ! B in C to itself, thought of as a morphism in D.
Functors such as these that “forget” some structure are called forgetful functors. In
general, these functors are faithful but not full. For example, distinct group homomorphisms
f, g: A ! B are also distinct as functions, but not every set function between groups is a group
homomorphism.
For any category C whose objects are sets, perhaps with additional structure and whose
morphisms are set functions, also perhaps with additional structure, the “most forgetful”
functor is the one that forgets all structure and thinks of an object simply as a set
and a morphism simply as a set function. This functor is called the underlying-set functor
U: C ) Set on C.
□
The Category of All Small Categories
As mentioned earlier, it is tempting to deﬁne the category of all categories, but this does not
exist on foundational grounds. On the other hand, the category SmCat of all small categories
does exist. Its objects are the small categories and its morphisms are the covariant functors
between categories. Of course, SmCat is a large category.
Concrete Categories
Despite the two main tenets of category theory described earlier, most common categories do
have the property that their objects are sets whose elements are “important” and whose
morphisms are ordinary set functions on these elements, usually with some additional struc-
ture (such as being group homomorphisms or linear transformations). This leads to the
following deﬁnition.
1 Definition
A category C is concrete if there is a faithful functor F: C ) Set. Put more colloquially, C is
concrete if the following hold:
1) Each object A of C can be thought of as a set FA (which is often A itself). Note that distinct
objects may be thought of as the same set.
2) Each distinct morphism f: A ! B in C can be thought of as a distinct set function Ff: FA !
FB (which is often f itself).
3) The identity 1A morphism can be thought of as the identity set function F1: FA ! FA and
the composition f ∘g in C can be thought of as the composition Ff ∘Fg of the corresponding
set functions.
□
Concrete Categories

Categories that are not concrete are called abstract categories. Many concrete categories
have the property that FA is A and Ff is f. This applies, for example, to most of the previously
deﬁned categories, such as Grp, Rng, Vect and Poset. The category Rel is an example of a
category that is not concrete.
In fact, the subject of which categories are concrete and which are abstract can be rather
involved and we will not go into it in this introductory book, except to remark that all small
categories are concrete, a fact which follows from Yoneda’s lemma, to be proved later in
the book.
Subcategories
Subcategories are deﬁned as follows.
1 Definition
Let C be a category. A subcategory D of C is a category for which consists of a nonempty subclass
Obj D
ð Þ of Obj C
ð Þ and a nonempty subclass Mor D
ð Þ of Mor C
ð Þ with the following properties:
1) Obj D
ð Þ  Obj C
ð Þ, as classes.
2) For every A, B 2 D,
homD A; B
ð
Þ  homC A; B
ð
Þ
and the identity map 1A in D is the identity map 1A in C, that is,
1A
ð
ÞD ¼ 1A
ð
ÞC
3) Composition in D is the composition from C, that is, if
f: A ! B
and
g: B ! C
are morphisms in D, then the C-composite g ∘f is the D-composite g ∘f.
If equality holds in part 2) for all A, B 2 D, then the subcategory D is full.
□
1 Example 11
The category AbGrp of abelian groups is a full subcategory of the category Grp, since the
deﬁnition of group morphism is independent of whether or not the groups involved are
abelian. Put another way, a group homomorphism between abelian groups is just a group
homomorphism.
However, the category AbGrp of abelian groups is a nonfull subcategory of the category
Rng of rings, since not all additive group homomorphisms f: R ! S between rings are ring
maps. Similarly, the category of differential manifolds with smooth maps is a nonfull subcate-
gory of the category Top, since not all continuous maps are smooth.

The Image of a Functor
Note that if F: C ) D, then the image FC of C under the functor F, that is, the set

 f 2 homC A; B


of morphisms need not form a subcategory of D. The problem is illustrated in Figure 3.
In this case, the composition F (g) ∘F (f ) is not in the image FC. The only way that this
can happen is if the composition g ∘f does not exist because f and g are not compatible for
composition. For if g ∘f exists, then
F g
ð Þ ∘F f
ð Þ ¼ F g ∘f
ð
Þ 2 FC
Note that in this example, the object part of F is not injective, since F(A) ¼ F(C) ¼ X. This is
no coincidence.
1 Theorem 12
If the object part of a functor F: C ) D is injective, then FC is a subcategory of D, under the
composition inherited from D.
1 Proof
The only real issue is whether the D-composite Fg ∘Ff of two morphisms in FC, when it
exists, is also in FC. But this composite exists if and only if
Ff: FA ! FB
and
Fg: FB ! FC

and so the injectivity of F on objects implies that
f: A ! B

Diagrams
The purpose of a diagram is to describe a portion of a category C. By “portion” we mean one or
more objects of C along with some of the arrows connecting these objects.
Informally, we can say that a diagram in C consists of a class of points (or nodes) in the
plane, each labeled with an object of C and for each pair (A, B) of nodes a collection of arcs
from the node labeled A to the node labeled B, each of which is labeled with a morphism from
A to B.
The simplest way to form a diagram is with a functor—any functor.
1 Definition
Let J and C be categories. A J -diagram (or just diagram) in C with index category J is a
functor J: J ) C.
□
Since the image J J
ð
Þ is indexed by the objects and morphisms of the index category J , the
objects in J are often denoted by lower case letters such as m, n, p, q. Figure 4 illustrates this
deﬁnition.
Observe that, as in this example, the image J J
ð
Þ need not be a subcategory of C. In this
example, J sends n and p to the same object in C but since α and β are not compatible for
composition, the image of J need not contain the composition Jβ ∘Jα. Thus, the image of a
functor simply contains some objects of C as well as some morphisms between these objects.
It is worth emphasizing that any functorF: J ) C is a diagram and so we have introduced
nothing new other than a point of view and some concomitant terminology.

The Digraph-Based Version of a Diagram
Of course, another way to view the diagram (functor) in Figure 4 is simply to label the nodes
and arrows of the index category J with the images of the objects and morphisms of J under
the functor J, as shown in Figure 5. This description of a diagram has the disadvantage that it
does not show as clearly as in Figure 4 the conﬂuence of Jn and Jp, but it does have some
advantages, as we will see later in the book.
Because generally speaking, the sole purpose of the objects and morphisms of the index
category is to uniquely identify the nodes and arcs of the diagram, Figure 5 is really little more
than a digraph whose nodes and arcs are labeled with objects and morphisms from C,
respectively. Here is the formal deﬁnition of a labeled digraph, along with some terminology
that we will need later in the book.
1 Definition
1) A directed graph (or digraph)Dconsists of a nonempty classV D
ð Þof vertices or nodes and
for every ordered pair (v, w) of nodes, a (possibly empty) set A v; w
ð
Þ of arcs from v to w. We
say that an arc inA v; w
ð
Þleaves v and enters w. Two arcs from v to w are said to be parallel.
The arcs from v to v are called loops.
2) The cardinal number of arcs entering a node is called the in-degree of the node and the
cardinal number of arcs leaving a node is called the out-degree of the node. The sum of the
in-degree and the out-degree is called the degree of the node.
3) A labeled digraph D is a digraph for which each node is labeled by elements of a labeling
class and each arc is labeled by elements of a labeling class. We require that parallel arcs have
distinct labels. A labeled digraph is uniquely labeled if no two distinct nodes have the same
label and no two distinct arcs have the same label.
□
A directed path (or just path) in a labeled digraph D is a sequence of arcs of the form
e1 2 A v1, v2
ð
Þ, e2 2 A v2, v3
ð
Þ, . . . , en1 2 A vn1; vn
ð
Þ
where the ending node of one arc is the starting node of the next arc. The length of a path is the
number of arcs in the path.
Thus, to create what we will call the digraph version of a diagram, we ﬁrst draw a digraph
whose nodes are labeled with the distinct objects of the index category J and whose arcs are
Figure 5
Diagrams
15
1

labeled with the distinct morphisms of J , subject to the obvious condition that the morphism
f: A ! B labels an arc from the node labeled A to the node labeled B. This is referred to as the
underlying digraph for the diagram.
Then, as shown on the right in Figure 6, we further label the nodes and arcs of the digraph
with the image of the functor J. Note that the labels from the index category J are distinct, but
the labels from C are not necessarily distinct (in the previous example, Jn ¼ Jp). This view of a
diagram will be useful when we deﬁne morphisms between diagrams.
Note that if the object part of the functor J is not injective, then two distinct nodes of the
underlying graph will be labeled with the same object in C. Although this is useful on occasion
(we will use it precisely once), for most applications of diagrams (at least in this book) the
object part and the local arrow parts of J are injective and so the nodes and arcs are uniquely
labeled from C.
Since as we have remarked, the purpose of the objects and morphisms of the index category
is to uniquely identify the nodes and arcs of the underlying digraph, once the graph is drawn on
paper, the nodes and arcs are uniquely identiﬁed by their location and so the labels from J are
not needed and are typically omitted. This is why diagrams are often drawn simply as in
Figure 7, for example.
We will use blackboard letters , , , . . . to denote diagrams and if we need to emphasize
the functor, we will write
J: J ) C

Commutative Diagrams
We consider that any directed path in a diagram is labeled by the composition of the
morphisms that label the arcs of the path, taken in the reverse order of appearance in the
path. For example, the label of the path
A !
f B !
g C
in Figure 7 is g ∘f.
A diagram in a category C is said to commute if for every pair (A, B) of objects in and
any pair of directed paths from A to B, one of which has length at least two, the corresponding
path labels are equal. A diagram that commutes is called a commuting diagram or commuta-
tive diagram.
For example, the diagram in Figure 1 commutes since
ρ1 ∘τ ¼ σ1
and
ρ2 ∘τ ¼ σ2
Note that we exempt the case of two parallel paths of length one so that a diagram such as the
one in Figure 8 can be commutative without forcing f and g to be the same morphism. The
commutativity condition for this diagram is thus f ∘e ¼ g ∘e.
Special Types of Morphisms
For functions, the familiar concepts of invertibility (both one-sided and two-sided) and
cancellability (both one-sided and two-sided) are both categorical concepts. However, the
familiar concepts of injectivity and surjectivity are not categorical because they involve
the elements of a set.
In the category Set, morphisms are just set functions. For this particular category, the
concepts of right-invertibility, right-cancellability and surjectivity are equivalent, as are
the concepts of left-invertibility, left-cancellability and injectivity. However, things fall apart
totally in arbitrary categories. As mentioned, the concepts of injectivity and surjectivity are not
even categorical concepts and so must go away. Moreover, the concepts of invertibility and
cancellability are not equivalent in arbitrary categories!
Let us explore the relationship between invertibility and cancellability for morphisms in an
arbitrary category. In the exercises, we will ask you to explore the relationship between these
concepts and the noncategorical concepts of injectivity and surjectivity, when they exist in the
context of a particular category.
We begin with the formal deﬁnitions.

1 Definition
Let C be a category.
1) A morphism f: A ! B is right-invertible if there is a morphism fR: B ! A, called a right
inverse of f, for which
f ∘fR ¼ 1B
2) A morphism f: A ! B is left-invertible if there is a morphism fL: A ! B, called a left
inverse of f, for which
fL ∘f ¼ 1A
3) A morphism f : A ! B is invertible or an isomorphism if there is a morphism f 1: B ! A,
called the (two-sided) inverse of f, for which
f1 ∘f ¼ 1A
and
f ∘f1 ¼ 1B
In this case, the objects A and B are isomorphic and we write A  B.
□
Note that the categorical term isomorphism says nothing about injectivity or surjectivity, for
it must be deﬁned in terms of morphisms only!
In fact, this leads to an interesting observation. For categories whose objects are sets and
whose morphisms are set functions, we can deﬁne an isomorphism in two ways:
1) (Categorical deﬁnition) An isomorphism is a morphism with a two-sided inverse.
2) (Non categorical deﬁnition) An isomorphism is a bijective morphism.
In most cases of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings or vector spaces, these
deﬁnitions are equivalent. However, there are cases where only the categorical deﬁnition is
correct.
For example, as shown in Figure 9, let P ¼ {a, b} be a poset in which a and b are
incomparable and let Q ¼ {0, 1} be the poset with 0 < 1. Let f: P ! Q be deﬁned by fa ¼
0 and fb ¼ 1. Then f is a bijective morphism of posets, that is, a bijective monotone map.
However, it is not an isomorphism of posets!
Proof of the following familiar facts about inverses is left to the reader.

g ¼ h

g ¼ h
for any parallel morphisms g, h: C ! A. A left-cancellable morphism is called a monic

In general, invertibility is stronger than cancellability. We also leave proof of the following
to the reader.

1) f left-invertible ) f left-cancellable (monic)
2) f right-invertible ) f right-cancellable (epic)
3) f invertible ) f monic and epic.
Moreover, the converse implications fail in general.
□
It is also true that a morphism can be both monic and epic (both right and left cancellable)
but fail to be an isomorphism. (Hint: Check the examples of categories given earlier). On the
other hand, one-sided cancellability together with one-sided invertibility (on the other side, of
course) do imply an isomorphism.
1 Theorem 15
Let f: A ! B be a morphism in a category C.
1) If f is monic (left-cancellable) and right-invertible, then it is an isomorphism.
2) If f is epic (right-cancellable) and left-invertible, then it is an isomorphism.

Special Types of Morphisms

Initial, Terminal and Zero Objects
Anyone who has studied abstract algebra knows that the trivial object (the trivial vector space
{0}, the trivial group {1}, etc.) often plays a key role in the theory, if only to the point of
constantly needing to be excluded from consideration. In general categories, there are actually
two concepts related to these trivial or “zero” objects.
1 Definition
Let C be a category.
1) An object I 2 C is initial if for every A 2 C, there is exactly one morphism from I to A.
2) An object T is terminal if for every A 2 C, there is exactly one morphism from A to T.
3) An object that is both initial and terminal is called a zero object.
□
Note that if C is either initial or terminal then hom(C, C) ¼ {1C}. The following simple
result is key.
1 Theorem 16
Let C be a category. Any two initial objects in C are isomorphic and any two terminal objects in C
are isomorphic.
1 Proof
If A and B are initial, then there are unique morphisms f: A ! B and g: B ! A and so
g ∘f 2 hom(A, A) ¼ {1A}. Similarly, f ∘g ¼ 1B and so A  B. A similar proof holds for
terminal objects.
□
1 Example 17
In the category Set, the empty set is the only initial object and each singleton-set is terminal.
Hence, Set has no zero object. In Grp, the trivial group {1} is a zero object.
□
Zero Morphisms
In the study of algebraic structures, one also encounters “zero” functions, such as the zero
linear transformation and the map that sends each element of a group G to the identity element
of another group H. Here is the subsuming categorical concept.
1 Definition
Let C be a category with a zero object 0. Any morphism f: A ! B that can be factored through
the zero object, that is, for which
f ¼ h0B ∘gA0
for morphisms h: 0 ! B and g: A ! 0 is called a zero morphism.
□
To explain this rather strange-looking concept, let us take the case of linear algebra, where
the zero linear transformation z: V ! W between vector spaces is usually deﬁned to be the map
20
Chapter 1 · Categories
1

that sends any vector in V to the zero vector in W. This deﬁnition is not categorical because it
involves the zero element in W. To make it categorical, we interpose the zero vector space {0}.
Indeed, the zero transformation z can be written as the composition z ¼ h ∘g, where
g: V ! 0
f g
and
h: 0
f g ! W
Here, both g and h are uniquely deﬁned by their domains and ranges, without mention of any
elements. The point is that g has no choice but to send every vector in V to the zero vector in {0}
and h must send the zero vector in {0} to the zero vector in W. Using g and h, we can avoid
having to explicitly mention any individual vectors!
In the category of groups, the zero morphisms are precisely the group homomorphisms
that map every element of the domain to the identity element of the range. Similar maps exist
in CRng and Mod.
It is clear that any morphism entering or leaving 0 is a zero morphism.
1 Theorem 18
Let C be a category with a zero object 0.
1) There is exactly one zero morphism between any two objects in C.
2) Zero morphisms “absorb” other morphisms, that is, if z: A ! B is a zero morphism, then so
are f ∘z and z ∘g, whenever the compositions make sense.
□
Duality
The concept of duality is prevalent in category theory.
Dual or Opposite Categories
For every category C, we may form a new category Cop, called the opposite category or the dual
category whose objects are the same as those of C, but whose morphisms are “reversed”, that is,
homCop A; B
ð
Þ ¼ homC B; A
ð
Þ
For example, in the category Setop the morphisms from A to B are the set functions from
B to A. This may seem a bit strange at ﬁrst, but one must bear in mind that morphisms are not
necessarily functions in the traditional sense: By deﬁnition, they are simply elements of the
hom-sets of the category. Therefore, there is no reason why a morphism from A to B cannot be
a function from B to A.
The rule of composition in Cop, which we denote by ∘op, is deﬁned as follows: If
f 2 homCop A; B
ð
Þ and g 2 homCop B; C
ð
Þ, then
g ∘op f 2 homCop A; C
ð
Þ
Duality
21
1

is the morphism f ∘g 2 homC C; A
ð
Þ. In short,
g ∘opf ¼ f ∘g
Note that Cop
ð
Þop ¼ C and so every category is a dual category.
It might occur to you that we have not really introduced anything new, and this is true.
Indeed, every category is a dual category (and conversely), since it is dual to its own dual. But
we have introduced a new way to look at old things and this will prove fruitful. Stay tuned.
The Duality Principle
Let p be a property that a category C may possess, for example, p might be the property that C
has an initial object. We say that a property pop is a dual property to p if for all categories C,
C has pop
iff
Cop has p
Note that this is a symmetric deﬁnition and so we can say that two properties are dual (or not
dual) to one another. For instance, since the initial objects in Cop are precisely the terminal
objects inC, the properties of having an initial object and having a terminal object are dual. The
property of being isomorphic is self-dual, that is, A  B in C if and only if A  B in Cop.
In general, if s is a statement about a category C, then the dual statement is the same
statement stated for the dual category Cop, but expressed in terms of the original category. For
example, consider the statement
the category C has an initial object
Stated for the dual category Cop, this is
the category Cop has an initial object
Since the initial objects in Cop are precisely the terminal objects in C, this is equivalent to the
statement
the category C has a terminal object
which is therefore the dual of the original statement.
A statement and its dual are not, in general, logically equivalent. For instance, there are
categories that have initial objects but not terminal objects. However, for a special and very

properties. Let p be a single property. Consider the statement
1) If a category C has P, then it also has p (abbreviated P ) p).
Since all categories have the form Cop for some category C, this statement is logically
equivalent to the statement
2) If a category Cop has P, then it also has p.
and this is logically equivalent to

3) If a category C has Pop, then it also has pop (abbreviated Pop ) pop).
The fact that
Π ) p
iff
Πop ) pop
is called the principle of duality for categories. Note that if Π is self-dual, that is, if Π ¼ Πop,
then the principle of duality becomes
Π ) p
iff
Π ) pop
Of course, the empty set of properties is self-dual. Moreover, the condition ; ) p means that all
categories possess property p. Hence, we deduce that
if all categories possess a property p, then all categories also possess any
dual property pop
For example, all categories possess the property that initial objects (when they exist) are
isomorphic. Hence, the principle of duality implies that all terminal objects (when they exist)
are isomorphic.
New Categories From Old Categories
There are many ways to deﬁne new categories from old categories. One of the simplest ways is
to take the Cartesian product of the objects in two categories. There are also several important
ways to turn the morphisms of one category into the objects of another category.
The Product of Categories
If B and C are categories, we may form the product category B  C, in the expected way.
Namely, the objects of B  C are the ordered pairs (B, C), where B is an object of B and C
is an object of C. A morphism from B  C to B0  C0 is a pair (f, g) of morphisms, where
f: B ! B0 and g: C ! C0. Composition is done componentwise:
f; g
ð
Þ ∘h; k
ð
Þ ¼ f ∘h, g ∘k
ð
Þ
A functor F: A  B ) C from a product category A  B to another category is called a
bifunctor.
The Category of Arrows
Given a category C, we can form the category of arrows C! of C by taking the objects of C!
to be the morphisms of C.

A morphism in C!, that is, a morphism between arrows is deﬁned as follows. A morphism

in C for which the diagram in Figure 10 commutes, that is, for which
g ∘α ¼ β ∘f
We leave it to the reader to verify that C! is a category, with compositon deﬁned pairwise:
γ; δ
ð
Þ ∘α; β
ð
Þ ¼ γ ∘α, δ ∘β
ð
Þ
and with identity morphisms (1A, 1B).
Comma Categories
Comma categories form one of the most important classes of categories and they should be
studied carefully since we will encounter them many times in the sequel. To help absorb the
concept, we will deﬁne the simplest form of comma category ﬁrst and then generalize twice.
Arrows Entering (or Leaving) an Object
The simplest form of comma category is deﬁned as follows. Let C be a category and let A 2 C.
In this context, the object A is referred to as a source object. The category of arrows leaving
the source object A, denoted by A ! C
ð
Þ has for its objects the set of all pairs,
B, f: A ! B
ð
Þ
 B 2 C


(19)
The objects B are referred to as target objects. Note that there is in general only one source
object but many target objects. For pedogogical reasons, we will refer to the pairs (19) as
comma objects.

Note that since a morphism uniquely determines its codomain, we could have deﬁned the
objects of
A ! C
ð
Þ to be just the morphisms f: A ! B themselves but it is customary to
include the codomains explicitly.
The morphisms
α: B, f: A ! B
ð
Þ ! C, g: A ! C
ð
Þ
in the comma category A ! C
ð
Þ are deﬁned by taking the morphisms α: B ! C in C between
the target objects for which the triangle shown on the left in Figure 11 commutes, that is, for
which
α ∘f ¼ g
(20)
and changing the domain and codomain to (B, f: A ! B) and (C, g : A ! C), respectively.
Note that although some authors say that a morphism from (B, f: A ! B) to (C, g : A ! C) is
a morphism α: B ! C that satisﬁes (20), this is not quite correct, since the two morphisms
have different domains and codomains. To temporarily help clarify this distinction, we will
write α for the morphism in the comma category, but will drop this notation quickly, since
other authors do not use it at all.
Now we can deﬁne composition in the comma category by
α ∘β ¼ α ∘β
whenever α ∘β is deﬁned. As to the identity on an object (B, f : A ! B), we have
1B ∘a ¼ 1B ∘α ¼ α
and
α ∘1B ¼ α ∘1B ¼ α
and so 1B is the identity morphism for the object (B, f: A ! B). We leave a check on
associativity to you. The category of arrows leaving A is also called a coslice category.
Dually, the category C ! A
ð

pairs
B, f: B ! A

in C ! A
ð
Þ comes from a morphism α: B ! C in C for which
g ∘α ¼ f
by changing domain and codomain. The category of arrows entering A is also called a slice
category. In this case, there is only one target object A and many source objects B.
The First Generalization
There are many occassions (in fact, most occassions) when we would like to exercise
control over what types of objects can be the target objects in a comma category. This is
accomplished using a functor. Speciﬁcally, as shown in Figure 12, let F : C ) D be a functor
and let A 2 D be a source object.
As shown on the left in the ﬁgure, the objects of the comma category (A ! F) are the pairs

C, f: A ! FC
 C 2 C

(21)
whose target objects FC come from the image of the category C under the functor F. Again for
pedological reasons, we will refer to the pairs (21) as comma objects.
As a quick example, suppose we wish to consider group homomorphims f: A ! R from a
ﬁxed abelian group A (the source) into the additive portion of various rings R (the targets).
To accomplish this, we use the forgetful functor F: Rng ) AbGrp to forget the multiplicative
structure of a ring and so our morphisms take the form f: A ! FR for R 2 Rng.
As to morphisms in the comma category (A ! F), as shown on the right in Figure 12, a
morphism
α: C1, f1: A ! FC1
ð
Þ ! C2, f2: A ! FC2
ð
Þ
comes from a morphism α: C1 ! C2 in C between “pre-target” objects with the property that
Fα ∘f1 ¼ f2
with the appropriate change in domain and codomain. Note that the comma category A ! C
ð
Þ
deﬁned earlier is just A ! IC
ð
Þ, where IC is the identity functor on C.
Dually, we can deﬁne the comma category (F ! A) by reversing the arrows. Thus, a
comma object in (F ! A) is a pair
Figure 12

C, f: FC ! A

Þ
consisting of a source object C and an arrow from FC to the target object A. A morphism
α: C1, f1: FC1 ! A
ð
Þ ! C2, f2: FC2 ! A
ð
Þ
effects a change in source objects, which is accomplished by a morphism α: C1 ! C2 between
“pre-source” objects for which
f2 ∘Fα ¼ f1
The Final Generalization
As a ﬁnal generalization, we can allow both the source and the target objects to vary over the
image of separate functors. Speciﬁcally, let F : B ) D andG: C ) D be functors with the same
codomain. As shown in Figure 13, an object of the comma category (F ! G) is a triple
B, C, f : FB ! GC
ð
Þ
where B 2 B, C 2 C and f is a morphism in D.
As to morphisms, as shown in Figure 14,
Figure 13
Figure 14
New Categories From Old Categories

a morphism from (B, C, f: FB ! GC) to (B 0, C 0, f0: FB0 ! GC0) is a pair of morphisms
α: B ! B0, β: C ! C0
ð
Þ
for which the square commutes, that is,
Gβ ∘f ¼ f0 ∘Fα
The composition of pairs is done componentwise.
1 Example 22
Let C be a category and let F: C ) Set be a set-valued functor. The objects of the category of
elements Elts(F) are ordered pairs (C, a), where C 2 C and a 2 FC. A morphism f: (C, a) !
(D, b) is a morphism f : C ! D for which Ff (a) ¼ b. We leave it to the reader to show that this
is a special type of comma category.

Note that any categoryC can be viewed as a hom-set category by adjoining a new initial “object”
 not in C and deﬁning a new morphism fA:  ! A from  to each object A 2 C. Then each
object A 2 C can be identiﬁed with its hom-set hom(, A). Also, the morphisms f: A ! B in C
are identiﬁed with the morphisms

of hom-sets.
The Categorical Product
Recall that in Example 8, we tried to motivate the categorical perspective by describing how the
external direct product of vector spaces can be deﬁned using morphisms (linear
transformations) rather than elements. The key to this description is the projection maps.
At this point, we want to generalize this example, so that we can use it in further examples
and exercises. We will revisit this again in more detail in the chapter on cones and limits, so we
will be brief here.
Here is the formal deﬁnition of the product for general categories.
1 Definition
Let C be a category and let A, B 2 C, as shown in Figure 16. A product of A and B is a triple
A  B, ρ1: A  B ! A, ρ2: A  B ! B
ð
Þ
Figure 16
The Categorical Product
29

where A  B is an object in C and ρ1 and ρ2 are morphisms in C with the property that for any
triple
X, f: X ! A, g: X ! B
ð
Þ
where X 2 C, there exists a unique map θ: X ! A  B, called the mediating morphism for
which the diagram in Figure 16 commutes, that is, for which
ρ1 ∘θ ¼ f
and
ρ2 ∘θ ¼ g
The maps ρ1 and ρ2 are called the projection maps.
□
Of course, by now you realize that the projection maps are critical to the concept of a
categorical product. However, although it is quite misleading, it is common practice to denote a
product simply as A  B, without explicit mention of the projection maps. It can be shown, as
we will do later, that all products of A and B are isomorphic.
It follows from the deﬁnition that two morphisms α, β: X ! A  B into a product are
equal if and only if
ρ1 ∘α ¼ ρ1 ∘β
and
ρ2 ∘α ¼ ρ2 ∘β
This is a common application of the uniqueness of the mediating morphism (and worth
remembering!).
Here are some simple examples of the categorical product. It is interesting to note that the
familiar product of groups, rings and vector spaces, for example, is an example of the same
categorical concept as the upper bound in a poset!
1 Example 23
1) In Set, the product is the cartesian product, with the usual projections.
2) In Grp, Mod, Vect and Rng, the product is the usual direct product of groups, modules,
vector spaces and rings, deﬁned coordinatewise.
3) In Poset(P), the product is the least upper bound.
□
If a category C has the property that every pair of objects in C has a product, which is the
case for Grp, Mod, Vect and Rng but not for Poset(P), we say that C has binary products. On
the other hand, the category Field does not have products.
As mentioned, we will go into more details about the product in a later chapter. For now,
this is all you need to know to handle any subsequent discussions.
The Product of Morphisms
We can use the categorical product to deﬁne the product of morphisms in a category. Let C be
a category with binary products and let f1: A1 ! B1 and f2: A2 ! B2 be morphisms in C. We
wish to deﬁne the product morphism
30
Chapter 1 · Categories

f1  f2: A1  A2, α1, α2
ð
Þ ! B1  B2, β1, β2
ð
Þ
(24)
where the maps αi and βi are the corresponding projection maps for the two products.
Let us “discover” the deﬁnition using some typical categorical reasoning, which we will call
the mediating morphism trick so we can refer to it again later in the book. The mediating
morphism trick is this: To get a map from any object X into a product such as B1  B2, we
simply deﬁne two maps δ1: X ! B1 and δ2: X ! B2 from X into the components of the
product and then invoke the deﬁnition of product! This deﬁnition says that there is a unique
(mediating morphism) map τ: X ! B1  B2 for which
β1 ∘τ ¼ δ1
and
β2 ∘τ ¼ δ2
So, to use the mediating morphism trick to get a map from A1  A2 to B1  B2, all we need is a
pair of maps: one from A1  A2 to B1 and one from A1  A2 to B2.
The whole story is shown in Figure 17.
We have the projections αi: A1  A2 ! Ai and the maps fi: Ai ! Bi, whose compositions
gives us the desired maps from A1  A2 to the components B1 and B2. Hence, there is a unique
map (24) for which
β1 ∘f1  f2
ð
Þ ¼ f1 ∘α1
and
β2 ∘f1  f2
ð
Þ ¼ f2 ∘α2
(25)
Equations (25) deﬁne the product f1  f2.
Note that in categories where the product is a cartesian product of sets and the projections
are ordinary projection set functions, these equations give the coordinates of the ordered pair
(f1  f2)(x1, x2) and so
f1  f2
ð
Þ x1; x2
ð
Þ ¼ f1 x1
ð
Þ, f2 x2

as we would hope. However, in more unusual categories, we must rely on Equations (25).

Let us now take a closer look at functors, beginning with some additional examples.
Examples of Functors
We have already discussed the power set functor and the forgetful functor. Let us consider
some other examples of functors.
1 Example 26
1) For a given positive integer n, we can deﬁne a matrix functor Fn: CRng ) Grp sending a
commutative ring R to the general linear group GLn(R) of nonsingular n  n matrices
over R. Each ring homomorphism f: R ! S is sent to the map that works elementwise on
the entries of a matrix.
2) Another functor G: CRng ) Grp is deﬁned by setting GR ¼ R, the group of units of
R and Gf ¼ f
R for any ring homomorphism f: R ! S. This makes sense since a ring
homomorphism maps units to units.
□
1 Example 27
If P is a poset, then a nonempty subset D of P is a down-set if d 2 D and x  d imply that
x 2 D. Let Poset be the category of all posets. Deﬁne the down-set functor O: Poset ) Poset
as follows. A poset P is sent to the family O P
ð Þ of all down-sets in P, ordered by set inclusion.
If f : P ! Q is a monotone map, then the inverse image of a down-set in Q is a down-set in
P and so we may take O f

ð Þ to be the induced inverse map f 1. Since

P ¼ 1O P

and
g ∘f

it follows that O is a contravariant functor on Poset.

Here is a functor tongue-twister. Let C be a category. We can deﬁne a functor F : C ) SmCat
that takes an object A2C to the comma category C ! A
ð
Þ2SmCat, with target object A. For
this reason, we might call the functor F an target functor (a nonstandard term). A morphism

f: A ! A0

Now, Ff must take u to a morphism
Ff
ð
Þ u
ð Þ: C, f ∘α: C ! A 0
ð
Þ ! C 0, f ∘β: C 0 ! A 0
ð
Þ
But
f ∘β
ð
Þ ∘u ¼ f ∘α
implies that u is also qualifying for the pair
P ¼
C, f ∘α: C ! A 0
ð
Þ; C 0, f ∘β: C 0 ! A 0
ð
Þ
ð
Þ
so we can take
Ff
ð
Þ u
ð Þ ¼ u
where the overbar on the right means give u the domain and codomain in P.
We will leave it to you to show that Ff is indeed a functor and then that F is also a
functor!

1 Example 30
Let C be a category with binary products. We deﬁne the squaring functor as follows. For each
object A, ﬁx a product (A  A, ρ1, ρ2) of A with itself. Let F : C ) C send A to A  A.
For a morphism f: A ! B in C, we want to deﬁne an appropriate morphism
Ff : A  A, ρ1, ρ2
ð
Þ ! B  B, σ1, σ2
ð
Þ
This clearly calls for the mediating morphism trick. So we need a couple of maps: one from
A  A to B1 and one from A  A to B2.
The two compositions f ∘ρi: A  A ! Bi for i ¼ 1, 2 will do the trick. Speciﬁcally, there
is a unique mediating morphism
θf : A  A ! B  B
as shown in Figure 21,

for which
σi ∘θf ¼ f ∘ρi
Let Ff ¼ θf . Then Ff is uniquely deﬁned by the conditions
σi ∘Ff ¼ f ∘ρi i ¼ 1; 2
ð
Þ
It is clear that F1A ¼ 1A, because we have ﬁxed a single product for each pair of objects. Also, if
f: A ! B, g: B ! C and the product for C is (C  C, τ1, τ2), then
τi ∘Fg ∘Ff
ð
Þ ¼ g ∘σi ∘Ff ¼ g ∘f ∘ρi ¼ τi ∘F g ∘f
ð
Þ
for all i and so Fg ∘Ff ¼ F (g ∘f ). Thus, F is a covariant functor on C.
□
1 Example 31
Let C be a category with binary products. To deﬁne a product functor
F : C  C ) C
we must assume that for every pair (X, Y) of objects in C, we have selected a product
X  Y , ζ1, ζ2
ð
Þ
The product functor F takes an object (A1, A2) to its chosen product (A1  A2, α1, α2) and a
morphism

Þ: A1; A2
ð
Þ ! B1; B2

to the product morphism
f1  f2: A1  A2, α1, α2
ð

(32)
recall that f1  f2 is deﬁned as the unique morphism satisfying the conditions
β1 ∘f1  f2
ð
Þ ¼ f1 ∘α1
and
β2 ∘f1  f2
ð
Þ ¼ f2 ∘α2
To see that F is a functor, we must ﬁrst show that 1A1  1A2 is the identity 1A1A2 on A1  A2
and for this, we use (32). Since
α1 ∘1A1A2 ¼ 1A1 ∘α1
and
α2 ∘1A1A2 ¼ 1A2 ∘α2
the uniqueness condition implies that
F 1A; 1B
ð
Þ ¼ 1A  1B ¼ 1AB

We have saved the most important example of a functor (at least from the perspective of
category theory itself) for last.
1 Example 33
One of the most important classes of functors are the hom functors, shown in Figure 22. Let C
be a category and let A 2 C. We refer to A as the source object for the hom functor.
Figure 22

The covariant hom functor
hom A, 
ð
Þ : C ) set
sends an object X 2 C to the hom-set of all morphisms from the source object A to X,
hom A, 
ð
Þ X
ð Þ ¼ hom A; X
ð
Þ
and it sends a morphism f: X ! Y to the “follow by f” map,
hom A, 
ð
Þf ¼ f 
Thus,
f : hom A; X
ð
Þ ! hom A; Y
ð
Þ
is deﬁned by
f τ ¼ f ∘τ
for any τ: A ! X. This functor is covariant precisely because
g ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ g ∘f 
Covariant hom functors are also called covariant representable functors.
Dually, the contravariant hom functor
hom  ; A
ð
Þ: C ) set
is deﬁned by
hom  ; A
ð
Þ X
ð
Þ ¼ hom X; A
ð
Þ
for all X2C and
hom  ; A
ð
Þ f
ð Þ ¼ f!
where f ! is the “preceed by f ” map,
f !τ ¼ τ ∘f
for any τ: Y ! A. This functor is contravariant precisely because
g ∘f
ð
Þ! ¼ f! ∘g!
Contravariant hom functors are also called contravariant representable functors.

Morphisms of Functors: Natural Transformations
Let C and D be categories. We would like to form a new category, denoted by DC, whose objects
are the functors from C to D. But what about the morphisms between functors?
Consider a pair of parallel covariant functors F, G: C ) D, as shown in Figure 23. As
discussed earlier in the book, we think of F and G as mapping one-arrow diagrams.
A structure-preserving map between F and G is a “map” between the image one-arrow
diagrams
FA !
Ff FB
and
Gf: GA !
Gf GB
As shown in Figure 23, this is accomplished by a family of morphisms in D
λ ¼
λA: FA ! GA
 A2D


for which the square in Figure 23 commutes, that is,
Gf ∘λA ¼ λB ∘Ff
The family λ is called a natural transformation from F to G.

for any f : A ! B inC and if F and G are contravariant, as shown on the right in Figure 24, then
λΑ ∘Ff ¼ Gf ∘λB
for any f: A ! B inC. Each morphism λA is called a component of λ. It is customary to say that
λA is natural in A from F to G. We denote the class of natural transformations from F to G by
Nat(F, G). We also use the notation λ(A) for λA when it is more convenient.
□
Some authors refer to the function λ: A ↦λA that maps an object A 2 C to the component
λA as a natural transformation as well.
Intuitively Speaking
Intuitively speaking, we can think of a natural transformation as follows. If f: A ! B is a
morphism in C, then let us think of Ff and Gf as two different versions of f. Then the natural
transformation condition
λB ∘Ff ¼ Gf ∘λA
is a kind of commutativity rule, for it says that we can swap λ (actually, an appropriate
component of λ) with one version of f provided we change the version of f.
An Example
Let us do an example.
1 Example 34 (The determinant)
Fix a positive integer n. As shown in Figure 25, consider two parallel functors G, U: CRng )
Grp deﬁned as follows. The functor G sends a ring R to the general linear group GLn(R)
and a morphism f: R ! S to the map f applied elementwise to the elements of a matrix,
which we denote by fe,

G: R ↦GLn R
ð Þ,
G: f : R ! S
ð
Þ ↦fe: GLn R
ð Þ ! GLn S
ð Þ
ð
Þ
The functor U sends a ring R to its group R of units and a ring map f to the restricted map
fu: R ! S, which makes sense since a ring map sends units to units,
U: R ↦R,
U: f: R ! S
ð
Þ ↦f: R ! S
ð
Þ
So we have two versions of the ring map f : apply f to matrices elementwise and apply f to
units. Can you think of some operation {λA} that “commutes” with these two versions of f, that
is, for which
λS ∘fe ¼ fu ∘λR
for f: R ! S?
Well, the determinant does not care whether it is applied before or after a ring map f, more
precisely, before fu or after fe, in symbols,
det feA
ð
Þ ¼ fu det A
ð Þ
ð
Þ
Thus,
detS ∘fe ¼ f ∘detR
which says that {detR j R 2 CRng} is natural in R.
□
We will do some additional examples in a moment.
Composition of Natural Transformations
Natural transformations can be composed by composing corresponding components.
In particular, if λ: F !
 G and μ: G !
 H are natural transformations, then the composition
μ ∘λ: F !
 H is deﬁned by
Figure 25

μ ∘λ
ð
ÞA ¼ μA ∘λA
We leave it to the reader to show that the composition of natural transformations is a natural
transformation. Also, the identity natural transformation 1: F !
 F is deﬁned by specifying that
1 A
ð Þ ¼ 1FA
Natural Isomorphisms
Suppose that λ: F !
 G is a natural transformation from F to G, where each component
λA: FA  FB is an isomorphism. The condition that λ is natural is
λB ∘Ff ¼ Gf ∘λA
Applying λ1
B on the left and λ1
A on the right gives
Ff ∘λ1
A ¼ λ1
B ∘Gf
Thus, the familyμ ¼
λ1
A
 A2C


is a natural transformation from G to F, that is, μ: G !
 F.
Moreover, μ ∘λ ¼ 1 and λ ∘μ ¼ 1 are the respective identity natural isomorphisms (each
component is an identity morphism).
Conversely, if λ: F !
 G and μ: G !
 F are natural transformations for which μ ∘λ ¼
1 and λ ∘μ ¼ 1, then λA is an isomorphism for all A2C.
1 Theorem 35
Let λ: F !
 G be a natural transformation. The following are equivalent:
1) Each component of λ is an isomorphism.
2) There is a natural transformation μ: G !
 F for which
μ ∘λ ¼ 1
and
λ ∘μ ¼ 1
where 1 is the appropriate natural isomorphism all of whose components are identity morphisms.
When these statements hold, we say that λ is a natural isomorphism and that F and G are
naturally isomorphic, written λ: F _G or F _G. When F and G are set-valued, we use the
notation _$ . in place of _ , since the components are bijections in this case.
□
More Examples of Natural Transformations
Let us consider some additional examples of natural transformations.
1 Example 36 (The double-dual)
Let Vect be the category of vector spaces over a ﬁeld k, with linear maps. We need a little
vector space theory for this example. As you probably know, the dual space V  of a vector
46
Chapter 2 · Functors and Natural Transformations
2

space V is the family of linear functionals on V. Hence, the double-dual space V  is the family
of linear functionals on V .
For example, if v 2 V, then the evaluation at v map v: V  ! k deﬁned by
v f
ð Þ ¼ f v
ð Þ
for all f 2 V  belongs to the double dual V . Let us set
ϵV : V ! V ,
ϵV v
ð Þ ¼ v
The operator adjoint τ!: W ! V  of a linear map τ: V ! W is deﬁned by
τ! f
ð Þ ¼ f ∘τ
Therefore, the second adjoint τ!!: V  ! W  is given by
τ!! α
ð Þ ¼ α ∘τ!
for α 2 V .
In this case, we would like to ﬁnd two versions of a linear map τ: V ! W that commute
with evaluation.
We begin by looking at ϵW ∘τ. If v 2 V, then
ϵW ∘τ
ð
Þ v
ð Þ ¼ ϵW τv
ð
Þ ¼ τv
Now we want to massage this until evaluation pops out the front. Applying τv to f 2 V  gives
τv f
ð Þ ¼ f τ v
ð Þ
ð
Þ ¼ v f ∘τ
ð
Þ ¼ v τ! f
ð Þ
ð
Þ ¼ v ∘τ!
ð
Þ f
ð Þ
and so
τv ¼ v ∘τ!
Thus,
ϵW ∘τ
ð
Þ v
ð Þ ¼ τv ¼ v ∘τ! ¼ τ!! v
ð Þ ¼ τ!! ϵV v
ð Þ
ð
Þ ¼ τ!! ∘ϵV
ð
Þ v
ð Þ
and we ﬁnally arrive at
ϵW ∘τ ¼ τ!! ∘ϵV
(37)
We can now put this in the language of natural transformations. Deﬁne a functor F : Vect )
Vect that takes a vector space V to its double dual V  and a linear map τ: V ! W to its double
adjoint,
F : V ↦V 
and
F : τ ↦τ!!
Morphisms of Functors: Natural Transformations
47
2

Then (37) can be written as
Fτ ∘ϵV ¼ ϵW ∘Iτ
where I is the identity functor on Vect. Thus, as shown in Figure 26, the family {ϵV j V 2 Vect}
is natural in V.
This example is a little more abstruse than the determinant example. The determinant
example says that we can apply a ring map either before or after taking the determinant. This
example says that we can either follow a linear map τ by evaluation or preceed its second
adjoint τ!! by evaluation. Whoever would have guessed that?
We leave it to you to show that the family is a natural isomorphism when restricted to the
category of ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces.
□
1 Example 38 (The Riesz map)
For the category Vect, the dual functor G is deﬁned by
GV ¼ V 
and
Gτ ¼ τ!
In examining the relationship between vector spaces and their duals, it is immediately clear that
there cannot be a natural transformation from the identity functor on Vect to the dual functor
on Vect because the identity functor is covariant but the dual functor is contravariant.
On the other hand, there is an important (and basis free) natural transformation for
ﬁnite-dimensional inner product spaces. Let FinInner be the category of ﬁnite-dimensional
real inner product spaces, with unitary transformations. A linear transformation σ: V ! W is
unitary if it is a bijection and
σu; v
h
i ¼ u, σ1v


The background we need here is the Riesz representation theorem. Deﬁne the Riesz map
RV : V ! V  by
RV v
ð Þ x
ð Þ ¼ v; x
h
i
Figure 26
48
Chapter 2 · Functors and Natural Transformations
2

In words, RV (v) is “inner product with v.” Because V is ﬁnite-dimensional, the Riesz
representation theorem says that RV is an isomorphism and so each element of V  has the
form RV (v) ¼ hv, i for a unique v 2 V.
In an effort to ﬁnd a commutativity rule involving the Riesz maps, we write for any v 2 V,
RW ∘τ
ð
Þ v
ð Þ ¼ RW τv
ð
Þ
¼ τv, 
h
i
¼ v, τ1 

ð
Þ
¼
τ1
ð
Þ! ∘RV


v
ð Þ
and so
RW ∘τ ¼ τ1

! ∘RV
This prompts us to make the following deﬁnition. Deﬁne the Riesz functor G by
GV ¼ V 
and
G τ
ð Þ ¼ τ1

!
where τ: V ! W is unitary. Then
RW ∘τ ¼ Gτ ∘RV
and so the family {RV j V 2 FinInner} is natural. In words, we can swap the Riesz maps with
τ and (τ1)!.
1 Example 39 (The coordinate map)
Let k be a ﬁeld. For each nontrivial vector space V over k, choose an ordered basis BV. Choose
the standard basis En for the vector spaces kn. Let FinVectB be the category whose objects are
the ordered pairs (V, BV). We will write Vn to denote the fact that V has dimension n.
The morphisms τ : V n; BV
ð
Þ ! W m; BW
ð
Þ are just the usual linear transformations
τ: Vn ! Wm.
Figure 27

Now, the coordinate map is deﬁned by
φ V ; BV
ð
Þ: V n; BV
ð
Þ ! kn; En
ð
Þ,
φ V ; BV
ð
Þ v
ð Þ ¼ v½ BV
where v½ BV is the coordinate matrix of v with respect to BV is an isomorphism.
The coordinate map can be used to deﬁne the matrix representation τ½ B,C of a linear map
τ: V ! W with respect to a pair of ordered bases B and C for V and W, respectively. Recall that
this matrix satisﬁes the equation
τv
½
BW ¼ τ½ BV ,BW v½ BV
where x
½ B denotes the coordinate matrix of x with respect to B. In terms of coordinate maps,
this can be written
φ W;BW
ð
Þ τv
ð
Þ ¼ τ½ BV ,BW φ V ;BV
ð
Þ v
ð Þ
or equivalently in terms of the matrix multiplication operator,
φ W;BW
ð
Þ ∘τ ¼ τ½ BV ,BW ∘φ V ;BV
ð
Þ
(40)
Now it is time for some functors, one being the identity functor I on FinVectB. The other
functor G is the matrix representation functor deﬁned by
G V n; BV
ð
Þ ¼ kn; En
ð
Þ
and
Gτ ¼ τ½ BV ,BW
(We leave it to you to check that this is a covariant functor.)
Then (40) becomes
φ W;BW
ð
Þ ∘Iτ ¼ Gτ ∘φ V ;BV

which shows (see Figure 28) that the family

1 Example 42 (Any morphism defines a natural transformation between hom functors)
Let C be a category and let f, h and α be morphisms in C for which the composition exists

f! h α

where each component is f ! (applied to the appropriate domain). We will see a bit later that

Natural Isomorphisms and Full Faithfulness
It is not surprising that a natural isomorphism of functors preserves fullness and faithfulness.
We leave proof of the following as an exercise.
1 Theorem 43
1) Let F _ G be naturally isomorphic functors.
a) F is faithful if and only if G is faithful.
b) F is full if and only if G is full.
In particular, if F _ IC, then F is fully faithful.
2) Let F : C ) D and G: D ) C be functors.
a) If G ∘F is faithful, then F is faithful.
b) If G ∘F is full, then G is full.

In particular, if
G ∘F 
 IC
and
F ∘G 
 ID
then F and G are fully faithful.
□
Functor Categories
As mentioned earlier, if C and D are categories, we would like to form the category DC, whose
objects are the functors from C to D and whose morphisms are the natural transformations
between functors. The only problem is that our deﬁnition of category requires that each
hom-set be a set, but the class of natural transformations between two functors need not be a
set. This issue can be resolved by requiring C to be a small category, that is, by requiring that
Obj C
ð Þ be a set. From now on, when we use the functor category DC, it is with the tacit
assumption that C is small.
1 Example 44
Let 2 be the category whose objects are 0 and 1 and whose morphisms are 10, 11 and 01:
0 ! 1. Then each functor F : 2 ) Dessentially just selects an arrow F(01): F(0) ! F(1) ofD.
Moreover, a natural transformation λ0; λ1
f
g: F !
 G is a pair of morphisms in D, as shown in
Figure 31.
Hence, the functor category D2, whose objects are the functors F : 2 ) D and whose
morphism are the natural transformations
λ0; λ1
f
g: F !
 G between functors is just the
category D! of arrows of D.
□
The Category of Diagrams
If C is a small category, the family of all diagrams J : J ) C in C over a particular index
category J form the objects of a new category diaJ C
ð Þ. The morphisms f: F ) G from
diagram J: J ) C to diagram G: J ) C are simply the natural transformations from J to G.
Figure 31
The Category of Diagrams

We can draw a picture of a morphism
λn
f
g: !
 
from diagram to diagram as shown in Figure 32. For this to represent a morphism, the
square must be commutative.
The category of diagrams will prove to be quite useful to us when we discuss universality
later in the book.
Natural Equivalence
Two categories C and D are said to be naturally equivalent if there are antiparallel covariant
functors F: C ) D and G: D ) C for which the compositions F ∘G and G ∘F are naturally
isomorphic to the corresponding identity functors ID andIC. There is also a similar concept for
contravariant functors.
1 Definition
1) Two categories C and D are naturally equivalent if there are covariant functors F : C ) D
and G: D ) C for which
F ∘G 
 ID
and
G ∘F 
 IC
where ID and IC are identity functors.
2) Two categories C and D are dually equivalent (or dual) if there are contravariant functors
F : C ) D and G: D ) C for which
F ∘G 
 ID
and
G ∘F 
 IC
where ID and IC are identity functors.
□
Note that the functors in this deﬁnition are fully faithful.

Let us show that the category FinVect of nonzero ﬁnite-dimensional vector spaces over a ﬁeld

is the standard basis En.
The dimension functor dim: FinVect ) Matrk sends V to its dimension and sends each

Since μI ¼ 1V and μMN ¼ μM μN, it follows that exp is also a functor.
The composition dim ∘exp: Matrk ) Matrk is the identity functor, since for any positive

Natural Transformations Between Hom Functors
Let us speak about natural transformations between hom functors. Let C be a small category.
Recall that for each A 2 C, the covariant hom functor
homC A, 
ð
Þ: C ) set
with source A is deﬁned by
homC A, 
ð
Þ X
ð
Þ ¼ homC A; X
ð
Þ
and for each f: X ! Y in C,
hom A; 
ð
Þf ¼ f 
A
where we have used subscripts to remind us to which domain the “follow by f ” map applies.
Figure 33 shows the diagram for a natural transformation λ between two hom functors.
The naturalness condition is the commutativity of the square, that is,
f 
B ∘λX ¼ λY ∘f 
A
(46)
Taking X ¼ A and applying this to the identity 1A gives

or ﬁnally,

for all f: A ! X. Hence,

where

ð
Þ
Note that all of the components h!
X of λ do the same thing (preceed by h) but to different
domains, so they are different morphisms.
Conversely, if h 2 homC B; A
ð
Þ, then the family {h!} is natural from homC A; 
ð
Þ to homC
B; 
ð
Þ because for any g: A ! X,

X g
ð Þ ¼ f ∘g ∘hX

and
h!

which are equal precisely because composition is associative. Thus, we have completely
characterized the natural transformations between hom functors.

Let C be a category and let A, B 2 C. Then the natural transformations

The Yoneda Embedding
Now that we understand the nature of natural transformations between hom functors, we can
deﬁne a rather important contravariant functor, called the Yoneda embedding
y: C ) SetC
The Yoneda Embedding
57

as follows. To each object A 2 C, we associate the covariant hom functor homC A; 
ð
Þ with
source A. Thus, the object part of y is
y A
ð Þ ¼ homC A, 
ð
Þ
The arrow part of y maps a morphism h: B ! A to a natural transformation between hom
functors and Theorem 47 gives us the “natural” choice
y h
ð Þ ¼ h!
f
g: homC A, 
ð
Þ !
 homC B, 
ð
Þ
To see that y actually is a contravariant functor, note that
y 1A
ð
Þ ¼



is the identity natural transformation and that
y g ∘h
ð
Þ ¼ g ∘h
ð
Þ! ¼ h! ∘g! ¼ y g
ð Þ ∘y h
ð Þ
It is customary to view y as a covariant functor,
y: Cop ) SetC
from the opposite category Cop to the functor category SetC, or equivalently, as a covariant
functor
y: C ) SetCop
However, lest all of these opposite categories give you a headache, we will leave the functor
y alone and live with its contravariance.
1 Theorem 48
Let C be a category. The contravariant functor y: C ) SetC deﬁned by
y A
ð Þ ¼ homC A, 
ð
Þ
and
y h
ð Þ ¼ h!
f
g: homC A, 
ð
Þ !
 homC B, 
ð
Þ
for all A 2 C and all h 2 homC B; A
ð
Þ is a contravariant embedding of C into the functor
category SetC, called the Yoneda embedding of C in SetC.
1 Proof
We must show that y is an embedding, that is, that the object part of y is injective and that the
local arrow parts of y are bijective. The object part of y maps A to homC A; 
ð
Þ and since homC
A; 
ð
Þ and homC B; 
ð
Þ are distinct for distinct objects A and B, the object part of y is injective.
To get the local arrow part of y, we ﬁx A, B 2 C to get the map
yA,B: homC B; A

We have already proven that yA,B is surjective, that is, that all natural transformations
from homC A; 
ð
Þ to homC B; 
ð
Þ have the form {h!}. As to injectivity, if yA,B(h) ¼ yA,B(k)
for h,k: B ! A, then
h!
X
 X2C

 X2C


In particular, for the components associated with X ¼ A, we can apply them to 1A to get
1A ∘h ¼ 1A ∘k
and so h ¼ k. Thus, the local arrow parts of y are injective and the Yoneda embedding is indeed
an embedding.
□
The Yoneda embedding states that any category C can be (contravariantly) embedded
in the functor category SetC of set-valued functors on C. In other words, each object A2C can
be represented as a hom functor homC A; 
ð
Þ and each morphism as a natural transformation
between hom functors.
To help remember the contravariant Yoneda embedding, we can also think of it as
the source embedding. Speciﬁcally an object A2C is used as the source of the hom functor
homC A; 
ð
Þ and a morphism h: B ! A is used to change the source from A to B, since the
embedding is contravariant. But to change the source from A to B, we must preceed by h.
1 Example 49
It is said that the Yoneda embedding is a vast generalization of Cayley’s theorem of group
theory. Cayley’s theorem says that any group G can be embedded in a permutation group.
Speciﬁcally, for a 2 G, right translation by a is deﬁned by
ρa: G ! G,
ρa g
ð Þ ¼ ga
Cayley’s theorem says that the map
ρ: G ! SG,
ρ a
ð Þ ¼ ρa
is an embedding of G into the permutation group SG.
Now recall that the group G can be thought of as a category G with just one object,
namely G itself. Moreover, each element a 2 G is a morphism a: G ! G and composition of
morphisms is the group product of elements.
Since G has only one object, it has only one hom functor
hom G, 
ð
Þ: G ) Set
deﬁned by
hom G, 
ð
ÞG ¼ hom G; G
ð
Þ ¼ U G
ð Þ
The Yoneda Embedding

where U (G) is the underlying set of G (that is, G thought of simply as a set) and for a 2 G,
hom G; 
ð
Þa ¼ a 
The contravariant Yoneda embedding y: G ! SetG is
y G
ð Þ ¼ hom G, 
ð
Þ,
y a
ð Þ ¼ a!
f
g
where
a! b
ð Þ ¼ ba ¼ ρa b
ð Þ
for all b 2 G and so
y G
ð Þ ¼ hom G, 
ð
Þ,
y a
ð Þ ¼ ρa
f
g
for all a 2 G.
But in this case, since there is only one object G, their is only one component in the family
{ρa} and so the arrow part of y is essentially just the Cayley embedding ρ.

Yoneda’s Lemma

arbitrary set valued functors. With reference to Figure 34, let A 2 C and consider the hom

and so
λY ∘f ¼ Hf ∘λX
Note that by taking X ¼ A and g ¼ 1A in (51), we get

Thus, any element of H(A) is the Yoneda representative for some natural transformation λ
from homC A; 

The Universal Mapping Property
Let us recall the deﬁnition of a comma category (mid level of generalization). If G: D ) C is a
functor and C 2 C is an (anchor) object, then the comma category (C ! G) is the category
whose objects are the pairs
U, u: C ! GU
ð
Þ
(54)
for U 2 D. Moreover, a morphism
τ: U, u: C ! GU
ð
Þ ! D, f: C ! GD
ð
Þ
(55)
between comma objects is essentially just a morphism τ: U ! D in D for which
Gτ ∘u ¼ f
(56)
(We have dropped the overbar notation τ.)
Therefore, referring to Figure 38, an initial comma object (54) has the deﬁning property
that for any comma object (D, f: C ! GD), there is a unique morphism (55) for which (56)
holds.
This property (or something equivalent) turns out to be critically important and has a
special name.
Universal Mapping Property (UMP): A pair (U, uC: C ! GU) has the universal mapping
property if for any morphism f: C ! GD, there exists a unique morphism τf: U ! D in Dfor
which the triangle in Figure 38 commutes, that is, for which
Figure 38

Gτf ∘uC ¼ f
(57)
It is worth mentioning that the presence of the functor G restricts the codomains of the maps in
question to the image GD. As we will see, this is an extremely valuable feature of these comma
categories.
The object U is known as a universal object, the map u is a universal map and the pair
(U, uC: C ! GU) is a universal pair for (C, G). Thus, we can state that
a universal pair for C; G
ð
Þ is simply an initial comma object in C ! G
ð
Þ:
Note that the universal object U depends on both C and G, as does the universal map uC.
The Mediating Morphism Maps
For each D 2 D, the universal mapping property deﬁnes a function
τC,D: homC C; GD
ð
Þ ! homD U; D
ð
Þ
by
τC,D f
ð Þ ¼ τf
for all f: C ! GD. Note that we have indexed τ with both C and D even though C is ﬁxed for
now. In the chapter on adjoints, we will allow C to vary as well and it is better to get used to the
double indexing now rather than having to deal with it later, when more pressing issues are at
hand. For a ﬁxed C 2 C, the family of morphisms τC,D as D ranges over the objects in D will be
denoted by
τC,D
f
gD ¼
τC,D
 D 2 D


Some authors refer to the map τf as the mediating morphism for f, although many authors do
not give τf any special name at all. We will use this term and also make the following
nonstandard deﬁnition.
1 Definition
Let G: D ) C be a functor and let
U ¼ U, uC: C ! GU
ð
Þ
be a universal pair for (C, G). Then the mediating morphism map for U is the map
τC,D: homC C; GD
ð
Þ ! homD U; D
ð
Þ
72
Chapter 3 · Universality
3

deﬁned for all f: C ! GD by
τC,D f
ð Þ ¼ τf
where τf is the unique mediating morphism for f.
□
The deﬁnition and uniqueness of mediating morphisms implies that
GτC,D f
ð Þ ∘uC ¼ f
and
τC,D Gh ∘uC
ð
Þ ¼ h
for all f: C ! GD and all h: U ! D and so the mediating morphism map is bijective, with
inverse map
τ1
C,D h
ð Þ ¼ Gh ∘uC
(58)
for all h: U ! D. Note also that the universal map is given in terms of the mediating
morphism map by
uC ¼ τ1
C,U 1U
ð
Þ
(59)
In fact, we have the following characterization of mediating morphism maps.
1 Theorem 60
A map
τC,D: homC C; G; D
ð
Þ ! homD U; D
ð
Þ
is the mediating morphism map for a universal pair
U ¼ U, uC: C ! GU
ð
Þ
if and only if τC,D is a bijection and
τ1
C,D hU,D
ð
Þ ¼ GhU,D ∘uC
(61)
1 Proof
If τC,D is a bijection given by (61), then for any f: C ! GD, we have
GτC,D f
ð Þ ∘uC ¼ f
and if
Gh ∘uC ¼ f
The Mediating Morphism Maps
73

for any h: U ! D, then applying the bijection τC,D gives
τC,D f
ð Þ ¼ τC,D Gh ∘uC
ð
Þ ¼ τC,D τ1
C,D h
ð Þ


¼ h
Hence, τC,D(f) ¼ τf is the unique mediating morphism for f and so τC,D is the mediating
morphism map.
□
A word about notation is in order. We have two choices when it comes to writing formulas
such as the one displayed in Theorem 60. We can write
τ1
C,D h
ð Þ ¼ Gh ∘uC
with the added condition that this holds for all h: U ! D or we can simply write
τ1
C,D hU,D
ð
Þ ¼ GhU,D ∘uC
with the tacit understanding that such a formula holds for all values of hU,D.
Frankly, we see virtue in both formats. The ﬁrst format is a bit easier to read, but it is also a
bit harder to follow, especially as the formulas become more complex and contain
compositions of maps. In any case, after much deliberation (and some vacillation), we have
settled on the more compact second format in most displayed equations, although we will use
the ﬁrst format at times as well.
Naturalness of the Mediating Morphism Maps
One of the main virtues of the mediating morphism maps is that they show how the universal
mapping property is actually equivalent to a naturalness property. Another virtue is that they
will allow us to obtain a certain “dual symmetry” that leads naturally (both ﬁguratively and
literally) to the notion of an adjunction (and left and right adjoints).
As to the naturalness property, let C 2 C and suppose that
τC,D
f
gD: homC C, GD
ð
Þ $ homD U; D
ð
Þ
is a family of bijections and set
uC ¼ τ1
C,U 1U
ð
Þ
Then the maps τC,D are mediating morphism maps if and only if
τ1
C,D α
ð Þ ¼ Gα ∘uC
(62)
for all α: U ! D. Moreover, (62) implies that for any h: D ! D0,
τ1
C,D0 h ∘α
ð
Þ ¼ G h ∘α
ð
Þ ∘uC ¼ Gh ∘Gα ∘uC ¼ Gh ∘τ1
C,D α
ð Þ
74
Chapter 3 · Universality
3

This shows that we may pull the map h outside of τ1
C,D0 h ∘α
ð
Þ by replacing it with Gh.
Note that this formula is equivalent to (62), as can be seen by taking α ¼ uC.
Moreover, since each τC,D is a bijection, as α varies over homD U; D
ð
Þ, the maps
f ¼ τ1
C,D α
ð Þ vary over homC C; GD
ð
Þ and so (62) is equivalent to
τ1
C,D0 h ∘τC,D f
ð Þ
ð
Þ ¼ Gh ∘f
for all f: C ! GD. Applying τC,D0 to both sides, this can be written in the form
τC,D0 ∘Gh

Þ

f
ð Þ ¼ h ∘τC,D
ð
Þ f
ð Þ
and so
τC,D0 ∘Gh
ð
Þ ¼ h ∘τC,D
(63)
on homC C; GD
ð
Þ.
Well, as shown in Figure 39, condition (63) says that the family
τC,D

gD: homC C, G 
ð

ð

is a natural isomorphism in D from the composite functor

The following are equivalent:
1) (Mediating morphisms) The maps τC,D

universal pair (U, uC: C ! GU), that is, τC,D(fC,GD) is the unique solution to the equation

∘uC ¼ fC,GD
2) (Inverse fusion formula) The maps τC,D

τ1

Þ ¼ GhU,D ∘uC
We will call this formula the inverse fusion formula.
3) (Naturalness in D) τC,D

gD is a natural isomorphism in D, that is,
τC,D0 ∘GhD,D0

or equivalently (and of more practical use),
τC,D0 GhD,D0 ∘fC,GD


¼ hD,D0 ∘τC,D fC,GD


□
The term “inverse fusion formula” is not standard. The term “fusion formula” does appear
in some literature, but refers to a formula that we will introduce later and call the “direct fusion
formula.” We use the term “inverse” here because this formula gives an expression for the
inverse of the mediating morphisms. The term “fusion” comes from the fact that these
formulas can be used to “connect” the concepts of left and right adjoint.
Examples
Let us turn to some examples of universality.
1 Example 65 (Sets)
Perhaps the simplest example of universality comes when G is the identity functor on Set.
76
Chapter 3 · Universality
3

With reference to Figure 40, a pair (U, u: C ! U) is universal for (C, I) if any set function
f: C ! D can be uniquely factored through u, that is, if there is a unique set function τf:
U ! D for which
τf ∘u ¼ f
(66)
Now, it is clear that (66) implies
f x
ð Þ 6¼ f y
ð Þ ) u x
ð Þ 6¼ u y
ð Þ
for x, y 2 C and since this applies to any set function f: C ! D, it follows that u must be
injective.
Moreover, if u is not surjective, then any map τf satisfying (66) can be changed by
changing the value of τf on an element of U \ im(u) without affecting the validity of (66)
and so uniqueness will not hold. Therefore, u must be a bijection. Conversely, if u: C ! U is a
bijection, then (66) will hold for τf ¼ f ∘u1.
Thus, a pair (U, u: C ! U) is universal for (C, I) if and only if u is a bijection. Incidentally,
this shows that neither universal maps nor universal objects are unique, although in this case
any two universal objects are equipollent, that is, isomorphic in Set.
□
1 Example 67 (Free Groups)
Consider the underlying-set functor G: Grp ) Set, which sends a group to its underlying
set and a morphism to the underlying set function. Let X be a nonempty set. Then a pair
(U, u: X ! U) where U is a group and u is a set function is universal for (X, G) if for any
set function f: X ! D where D is a group, there is a unique group homomorphism τf: U ! D
for which
τf ∘u ¼ f
as set maps.
Therefore, if X  U and if j: X ! U is the inclusion map, then to say that the pair
(U, j: X ! U) is universal is to say that every set function f: X ! D where D is a group
can be uniquely extended to a group homomorphism from f: U ! D. In this case, we say that
such a group U has the unique extension property with respect to the subset X.
Now, in treatments of group theory, free groups are deﬁned in one of two ways. The more
elementary (or perhaps just less categorical) treatments tend to deﬁne the free group FX as
the set of all words over the alphabet A ¼ X [ X1, under juxtaposition and the usual rules of
Figure 40
Examples
77
3

exponents. It is then shown that the free group FX has the unique extension property with
respect to X, that is, that the pair (FX, j: X ! FX) is universal for (X, G).
In more advanced treatments (or perhaps just more categorical treatments), the free group
on X is deﬁned as any group that has the unique extension property with respect to X. It is then
shown that the set of words over the alphabet A is one such group. In either case, the end result
is that the pair (FX, j: X ! FX) is universal for (X, G).
1 Theorem 68
Let G: Grp ) Set be the underlying-set functor. Let X be a nonempty set, let FX be the free
group on X and let j: X ! FX be the inclusion map. Then the pair
X, j: X ! F X
ð
Þ
is universal for (X, G).
□
1 Example 69 (Vector space bases)
One could say, but never does, that a vector space V with basis B is a “free vector space” over
B. On the other hand, one often does say the following: Any linear map f: V ! W is uniquely
determined by its values on the basis vectors in B and these values can be assigned arbitrarily.
But this is the same as saying that the pair
V , j: B ! V
ð
Þ
where j is the inclusion map is universal for (B, G), where G: Vect ) Set is the underlying set
functor.
□
1 Example 70 (Field of quotients)
Let IntDom be the category of integral domains, with morphisms being ring embeddings
(monomorphisms). Let G: Field ) IntDom be the forgetful functor, forgetting the fact that
every nonzero element of a ﬁeld is a unit. Let R0 denote the ﬁeld of quotients of an integral
domain R. Then
R0, j: R ! R0
ð
Þ
where j is the inclusion map, is universal for (R, G). This amounts to saying that any ring
embedding f: R ! F where F is a ﬁeld can be lifted in a unique way to the ﬁeld of quotients
f: R0 ! F. Thus, ﬁelds of quotients are universal objects.
□
1 Example 71 (Quotient spaces and canonical projections)
Let C be the category of all pairs (M, A) of R-modules, where A is a submodule of M. We call
C the category of modules with distinguished submodules. A morphism f: (M, A) ! (N, B)
is a linear map f: M ! N for which f (A)  B. Composition in C is composition of linear
maps. For if g: (N, B) ! (P, C), then
g ∘f
ð
Þ A
ð Þ ¼ g f A

Þ  g B
ð Þ  C
78
Chapter 3 · Universality

and so
g ∘f: M; A
ð
Þ ! P; C
ð
Þ
is a morphism in C. Referring to Figure 41, let G: ModR ) C be the functor that maps an
R-module M to (M, {0}) and sends a linear map f: M ! N to f: (M, {0}) ! (N, {0}).
Consider the pair
M=K, 0

Þ, π: M; K

(72)
where π is the canonical projection. If f: (M, K) ! (N, {0}), then
Gτf ∘π ¼ f
if and only if

Þ
for all m 2 M and so this will serve as the deﬁnition of τf, provided that it is well deﬁned. But
mK ¼ nK

m  n 2 K

ð
Þ ¼ 0

and so τf: M=K ! N is a well deﬁned module map. Thus, the pair (72) is universal.
□
1 Example 73 (The tensor product)
Let U  V be the cartesian product of two vector spaces over a ﬁeld k. Let Vect+ be the
category of all vector spaces over F with linear maps, to which is adjoined the object U  V,
as a set. The morphisms from U  V to a vector space W are the bilinear maps and there
are no morphisms from a vector space W to U  V. Also, hom(U  V, U  V) consists of
just the identity map.
Let G: Vect ) Vect+ be the inclusion functor. Then the tensor product
U  V , t: U  V ! U  V
ð
Þ
Figure 41
Examples
79
3

where t (u, v) ¼ u  v, is universal for (G, U  V). For if W is a vector space and
f: U  V ! W is bilinear, then there is a unique linear map τf: U  V ! W for which
τf ∘t ¼ f. Thus, tensor products are universal objects.
□
We have just seen that free groups, vector spaces, ﬁelds of quotients, quotient modules and
tensor products are all universal objects. Thus, all of these constructions are speciﬁc cases of the
same categorical concept—universality.
The Importance of Universality
The traditional method for deﬁning a new mathematical “object” is to ﬁrst describe what the
object is, that is, give its deﬁnition and then describe what it does, that is, describe its important
properties.
Traditional perspective: first definition, then properties:
However, a moment’s reﬂection shows that a deﬁnition is really only a means to an end and is
useless per se. The only reason to deﬁne a mathematical object is because that object has some
useful properties.
To illustrate, as we have seen, the pair (FX, j: X ! FX) where FX is the free group on the
set X satisﬁes the UMP. Moreover, this property characterizes the free group (up to isomor-
phism). Therefore, one could argue that the sole purpose for deﬁning the free group in the
traditional element-based manner is to deﬁne an object that has this universal property.
Indeed, the categorical perspective is that the free group should be deﬁned as any pair that
has this universal property.
Categorical perspective: definition by univeral
ð
Þ property:
This reveals the fact that the concept of a free group is really a categorical concept, that is, a
property of morphisms and not elements, even though the traditional deﬁnition of free group is
all about elements and ignores maps entirely.
A similar argument can be made for the other examples of universal properties that we have
discussed, namely, vector space bases, quotient spaces, ﬁelds of fractions, tensor products as
well as a host of other common mathematical constructions.
Indeed, there are many other examples of deﬁning an object by a universal property. One
example is the direct product of vector spaces described in 7 Example 8, which is an example of
a categorical construction. In fact, categorical constructions are nothing more or less than
universal pairs in a category of diagrams. We will discuss these constructions in a later chapter.
Uniqueness of Universal Pairs
Since universal pairs are deﬁned as initial objects in a comma category, they are unique up to
isomorphism in that category.

1 Theorem 74
Let G: D ) C and C 2 C and let

ð
Þ
be universal for (C, G). Then
T ¼ T, v: C ! GT
ð
Þ
is universal for (C, G) if and only if there is an isomorphism α: S  T in D for which
v ¼ Gα ∘u
(75)
1 Proof
Suppose ﬁrst that S is universal and that α: S  T satisﬁes (75). Then for any f: C ! GD,
there is a unique mediating morphism τf: S ! D for which
Gτf ∘u ¼ f
Then
G τf ∘α1


∘v ¼ G τf ∘α1


∘Gα ∘u ¼ Gτf ∘u ¼ f
and so τf ∘α1 is a mediating morphism for T . As to uniqueness, if Gμf ∘v ¼ f then
f ¼ Gμf ∘v ¼ Gμf ∘Gα ∘u ¼ G μf ∘α


∘u
and so the uniqueness of mediating morphisms for S implies that μf ∘α ¼ τf and so
μf ¼ τf ∘α1, proving uniqueness. Thus, T is universal.
For the converse, suppose that S and T are both universal. Then since v: C ! GT, the
universality of S implies that there exists a unique mediating morphism τv: S ! T for which
Gτv ∘u ¼ v
A similar argument shows that there exists a unique mediating morphism τu: T ! S for
which
Gτu ∘v ¼ u
and so
v ¼ Gτv ∘u ¼ Gτv ∘Gτu ∘v ¼ G τv ∘τu
ð
Þ ∘v
Then the uniqueness of mediating morphisms implies that τv ∘τu ¼ ιT. Similarly, τu ∘τv ¼ ιS
and so τu and τv are both isomorphisms. Taking α ¼ τv gives (75).

Note that universal morphisms are not unique in general, even for a single universal object.
For if

u ∘v: C ! GS
and
u ∘v1: C ! GS
implies that there are unique mediating morphisms τu∘v: S ! S and τu∘v1: S ! S for which
Gτu∘v ∘u ¼ u ∘v
and
Gτu∘v1 ∘u ¼ u ∘v1
(76)
Hence,
G τu∘v ∘τu∘v1
ð
Þ ∘u ¼ Gτu∘v ∘Gτu∘v1 ∘u ¼ Gτu∘v ∘u ∘v1 ¼ u
and similarly,
G τu∘v1 ∘τu∘v
ð
Þ ∘u ¼ Gτu∘v1 ∘Gτu∘v ∘u ¼ Gτu∘v1 ∘u ∘v ¼ u
and so the uniqueness of mediating morphisms implies that τu∘v is an isomorphism. There-
fore (76) and Theorem 74 imply that is universal.
□
Couniversality
The dual of the concept of an initial object in a comma category (C ! G) where G: D ) C is
the concept of a terminal object in a comma category (F ! D), where F: C ) D is a functor.
This deﬁnes the couniversal mapping property (CMP) although many authors use the term
universal mapping property for this property as well. For later use, we have interchanged the
roles of the two categories.

Referring to Figure 42, let F: C ) D and let D 2 D.

The statement that the object (S, v: FS ! D) is terminal in the comma category (F ! D)
is the following:
Couniversal mapping property (CMP): For every f: FC ! D, there is a unique μf: C ! S
for which
f ¼ v ∘Fμf

Cones and Limits
S. Roman, An Introduction to the Language of Category Theory, Compact Textbooks
in Mathematics, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41917-6_4, © The Author(s) 2017
We wish to continue our exploration of universality with some additional examples. For this,
we need to deﬁne a few more categorical concepts.
Cones and Cocones
Limits and colimits are key concepts in category theory. These concepts are based in turn on
the concepts of cones and cocones.
1 Definition
Referring to Figure 43, let J: J ) C
ð
Þ be a diagram in a category C and let V 2 C.
1) A cone V ; 
ð
Þ from V to with vertex V and base consists of the object V, together with
one morphism of C from V to each node in . We call these morphisms the legs of the cone.
Moreover, all triangles involving the vertex V and any two legs must commute. Thus, in the
left half of Figure 43, we must have
α ∘f3 ¼ f1
and
β ∘f3 ¼ f2
A cone over is a cone from some vertex V to . To specify the vertex and legs of a cone
V ; 
ð
Þ, we will write
K ¼ V ;
fn: V ! Jn
 n 2 J




or if we do not care about the functor J,
Figure 43

K ¼ V ;
fi: V ! Ai
 i 2 I




for an appropriate index set I.
2) The dual of a cone is a cocone, as shown in the right half of Figure 43. The deﬁnition of
cocone is obtained from the deﬁnition of cone by “reversing the arrows”, that is, by replacing
the phrase
together with one morphism of C from V to each node in 
with the phrase
together with one morphism of C from each node in to V
□
We phrase the following comments in the language of cones, but they apply equally well to
cocones.
Often a cone is pictured without drawing all of its legs. For instance, Figure 44 shows a cone
over a base diagram (the shaded portion). The cone also contains a leg λ from P to C, but the
cone condition requires that
λ ¼ g ∘α ¼ f ∘β
and so it need not be explicitly drawn.
Note that the presence or absence of identity morphisms in the base diagram does not
enter into the cone condition.
Cone and Cocone Categories
The cones over a diagram J: J ) C

shown in Figure 45, a cone morphism h: K ! L from a cone


is a morphism h: V ! W of C between the vertices of the cones with the property that any
triangle involving h and one leg from each cone must commute, that is,
gn ∘h ¼ fn
for all n 2 J .
We leave it to the reader to verify that this does deﬁne a category, where composition of
cone morphisms is ordinary composition of morphisms in C.
The notion of a cocone category coconeC 
ð Þ is dual to that of a cone category and we
leave the details to the reader.
Any Category Is a Cone Category: Objects Are
One-Legged Cones
Actually, any category C can be thought of as a cone category (or cocone category), where each
object in C is the vertex of a one-legged cone.
As shown in Figure 46, let  be a symbol that does not represent any object or morphism in
C and consider the category C whose objects are Obj C
ð Þ [ 
f g and whose morphisms are the
morphisms in C, along with one morphism fA: A !  for each object A of C and an identity
morphism 1 for . Composition is composition in C, along with the rule

Limits and Colimits
A terminal object in a cone categoryconeC 

1 Definition

ð
Þ be a diagram in a category C.

there is a unique cone morphism θ: L ! K, that is, a unique morphism θ: W ! V for which
fn ∘θ ¼ gn
for all n 2 J . A limit (or its vertex) is often denoted by lim
 .
2) Dually, a colimit of is an initial cocone over , that is, a cocone

1 Theorem 79
Limits are determined up to isomorphism, that is, if a diagram has a limit K, then the limits of
are precisely the cones that are isomorphic to K. The dual statement holds for cocones.
□
Terminal Cones and Couniversality
Let us ﬁx an index category J , a category C and a diagram
J: J ) C
ð
Þ
Our goal is to show that terminal cones (limits) over are essentially just special types of
couniversal pairs in an appropriate comma category.
The ﬁrst “issue” with a cone is that it mixes apples and oranges, that is, objects in C (the
vertex of the cone) with objects in the diagram category diaJ C
ð Þ (the base of the cone).
To ﬁx this, we deﬁne the constant diagram J: J ) C
ð
Þ with index set J and vertex
V 2 C to be the constant functor deﬁned by
JV n
ð Þ ¼ V
and
JV f
ð Þ ¼ 1V
As pictured in Figure 47, this is the diagram for which all nodes in the underlying graph are
labeled V and all arcs are labeled 1V.
Since the categories J and C are ﬁxed, it is clear that there is a bijection between objects
V 2 C and constant diagrams J: J ) C
ð
Þ in the diagram category diaJ C
ð Þ and so these
concepts are equivalent.
Now, Figure 48 shows a cone
K ¼ V ; λn: V ! Jn
 n 2 J


over the base diagram J: J ) C
ð

vertex V of the cone with the constant diagram .

Note that the cone’s leg set

 n 2 J

 J
(80)
between the J -diagrams (functors) on the right in Figure 48. Thus, we may think of the cone

K with vertex V over the base diagram J: J: ) C

(81)
consisting of the vertex V and the natural transformation {λn} that makes up the leg set for the
cone. But this looks a lot like a member of a comma category with anchor object J, where the
domains of the arrows are restricted to constant diagrams (functors).
So, as shown in Figure 49, we deﬁne the constant-diagram functor GJ: C ) diaJ C
ð Þ that
sends an object V to the constant diagram JV: J ) C
ð
Þ and a morphism f: V ! W to the
“constant” natural transformation f
f g: !
 all of whose components are f. Then the cone
K in (81) can be written in the form
V , λn
f
g: GJ V !
 J


which belongs to the comma category GJ ! J
ð
Þ with anchor object J.
Moreover, a cone morphismf: K ! Lbetween cones corresponds to a morphism between
the corresponding comma pairs. Thus, we can state that a terminal cone is equivalent to a
terminal object in the comma category GJ ! J
ð
Þ, that is, to a couniversal pair for GJ ; J
ð
Þ.
Categorical Constructions
Categorical constructions provide more evidence that universality is, well, universal. As
mentioned earlier, a categorical construction is nothing more or less than an example of a
universal or couniversal pair in the context of a category of diagrams. However, we will use the
traditional terminology of limits and terminal cones (and colimits and initial cocones), rather
than universal pairs (and couniversal pairs).
Figure 49

Chapter 4 · Cones and Limits

We will concentrate on three important categorical constructions and their duals:
equalizers and coequalizers, products and coproducts, and pullbacks and pushouts.
Equalizers and Coequalizers
We begin with a deﬁnition.
1 Definition
Let C be a category and let f, g: A ! B be parallel morphisms.
1) A morphism h: C ! A right-equalizes f and g if
f ∘h ¼ g ∘h
2) Dually, a morphism k: B ! C left-equalizes f and g if
k ∘f ¼ k ∘g
□
Now we can deﬁne the equalizer of f and g.
1 Definition
Let C be a category. As shown in Figure 50, an equalizer for a diagram consisting of two parallel
morphisms
¼
f: A ! B, g: A ! B
f
g
is a limit (terminal cone)
E ¼ E, e: E ! A
ð
Þ
over , that is, a pair E for which e right equalizes f and g and for any h: X ! A that right-
equalizes f and g, there is a unique mediating morphism θ: X ! E for which
e ∘θ ¼ h
□
Figure 50
Equalizers and Coequalizers
93
4

As alluded to earlier, we often omit legs of a cone that are uniquely determined by other
legs, which is why we have denoted the cone E by
E ¼ E, e: E ! A
ð
Þ
rather than
E ¼ E, e: E ! A, f ∘e: E ! B
ð
Þ
(By the deﬁnition of cone, f ∘e ¼ g ∘e.)
It is not hard to see that equalizer morphisms are monic.
1 Theorem 82
If E ¼ E, e: E ! A
ð
Þ is an equalizer of the pair f, g: A ! B, then e is monic.
1 Proof
A common technique for showing that two morphisms are equal is to show that they are both
mediating morphisms for the same limit or colimit. Recalling that monic means left-
cancellable, we want to show that if α, β: X ! E then
e ∘α ¼ e ∘β ) α ¼ β
To this end, we draw the diagram in Figure 51.
Then the cone condition f ∘e ¼ g ∘e implies that
f ∘e ∘α ¼ g ∘e ∘α
and so
X ¼ X, e ∘α: X ! A
ð
Þ
is a cone over {f, g: A ! B}. But each of α and β is the mediating morphism for X and so
α ¼ β. Thus, e is left-cancellable.
□
Note that there is no requirement in the deﬁnition of equalizer that f and g be distinct.
We leave it to the reader to show that a pair (E, e) is an equalizer of (f, f ) if and only if
e: E ! A is an isomorphism.

1 Example 83
For the category Set and for many common “set-based” categories, such as Grp, Rng and Mod,
the equalizer of f, g: A ! B is easy to describe. In fact, the name “equalizer” gives away the
description: It is the largest object (group, ring, module) contained in A upon which f and g are
equal:
E ¼
a 2 A
 f a
ð Þ ¼ g a
ð Þ


along with the inclusion map e: E ! A. This can be seen by noting that f and g are right-
equalized by h: X ! A, that is,
f ∘h ¼ g ∘h
if and only if f and g agree on the image h(X), that is, if and only if h(X)  E. Hence, the map
h0: X ! E deﬁned simply by restricting the range of h to E is a mediating morphism, since
e ∘h 0 ¼ h
As to uniqueness, if θ: X ! E also satisﬁes e ∘θ ¼ h, then e ∘θ ¼ e ∘h0 and so θ ¼ h0. □
Coequalizers
The dual to the equalizer is the coequalizer.
1 Definition
Let C be a category. Referring to Figure 52, the coequalizer of the diagram
¼ f: A ! B, g: A ! B
f
g
is an initial cocone
I ¼ C, k: B ! C
ð
Þ
under , that is, a pair I for which k left-equalizes f and g and for every k: B ! C that left-
equalizes f and g, there is a unique mediating morphism θ: C ! X for which
θ ∘k ¼ h
□
Figure 52
Equalizers and Coequalizers

In general, even though coequalizers are obtained from equalizers by “reversing all arrows,”
speciﬁc coequalizers seem rather more complex, or at least rather less intuitive than equalizers.
In certain contexts, the coequalizer describes one of the most important constructions of
modern algebra, namely, quotient structures. We remind the reader of the bijective correspon-
dence between partitions of a set and equivalence relations on the set. We will use both
concepts interchangeably in these examples.
1 Example 84
Consider the coequalizer in Set. The condition that h: B ! C left-equalizes f and g is
h ∘f a
ð Þ ¼ h ∘g a
ð Þ
and this is equivalent to the statement that h is constant on all sets of the form {f(a), g(a)} for
a 2 A.
It is well known that any set function h: B ! C induces a partition of its domain B whose
blocks are the nonempty inverse images h1(c), for c 2 C. Moreover, as shown in Figure 53,
h left-equalizes f and g if and only if for all a 2 A, the elements f(a) and g(a) belong to the
same block of this h-induced partition of B.
As we will see, the most “universal” such partition is the ﬁnest partition P of B for which
each set {f(a), g(a)} lies in a single block. Note, however, that the fact that f(a) and g(a) lie in a
single block K of P may force other elements of B to also lie in that block. For example, if
g(a) ¼ f(a0) for some a0 6¼ a, then of course f(a0) 2 K and so g(a0) must also lie in K.
Perhaps the best way to get a handle on the partition P is to consider the corresponding
equivalence relation  deﬁned by P. Thus, we begin by deﬁning a binary relation on B by
b  b0
if
b ¼ b0 or
b; b0
f
g ¼
f a
ð Þ, g a
ð Þ
f
g for some a 2 A
This relation is both reﬂexive and symmetric, but it need not be transitive, so we must pass to
the transitive closure . Thus, b1  bn if there is a ﬁnite sequence
b1, b2, . . . , bn
of elements of B for which bi  bi+1 for i ¼ 1, . . ., n  1.
Now, the function h left-equalizes f and g if and only if h is constant on the equivalence
classes of this equivalence relation. Moreover, the most “universal” choice for h is any function
that assigns different values to these equivalence classes. Perhaps the simplest way to deﬁne
such a function, which we denote by π is to send each element of a particular equivalence
class E to the equivalence class E itself, that is, π(b) ¼ [b], where [b] is the equivalence class
containing b.

The function π is called the canonical projection associated with the equivalence relation
or the partition and P is denoted by B= . Hence, π: B ! B=  is deﬁned by
π b
ð Þ ¼ b½ 
To see that π is indeed a coequalizer of f and g, if h: B ! X left-equalizes f and g, then
h is constant on the aforementioned equivalence classes and so the function θ: (B=  ) ! X
deﬁned by
θ b½ 
ð
Þ ¼ h b
ð Þ
is well-deﬁned. Moreover, h ¼ θ ∘π. As to uniqueness, if h ¼ τ ∘π for some τ: B=  ! X,
then
θ b½ 
ð
Þ ¼ h b
ð Þ ¼ τ b½ 
ð
Þ
for all b 2 B and so τ ¼ θ. Hence,
B=  , π: B ! B= 
ð
Þ
is a coequalizer of f and g.
□
1 Example 85
We can perform a similar analysis to determine the coequalizer in other categories. For example,
consider the coequalizer in Grp. As with Set, a group homomorphism h: B ! C
left-equalizes f and g if, for all a 2 A, the values f(a) and g(a) belong to the same equivalence
class of the equivalence relation  generated by h. However, since h is a group homomorphism,
this equivalence relation is a congruence relation, that is,
x  y
and
u  v
)
x1  y1
and
xu  yv
In the language of partitions, the blocks of the associated partition are called congruence classes.
Thus, we seek the congruence relation  on B that has the ﬁnest partition among all
congruence relations  for which f(a)  g(a), for all a 2 A.
The congruence relations on B correspond bijectively to the normal subgroups of B. (This
is a critical fact that seems often to be played down in elementary algebra books.) This
correspondence sends a congruence relation  to the normal subgroup [1] and a normal
subgroup N ⊴B to the congruence relation
a N b
if
b1a 2 N
Moreover,  N has a ﬁner partition than  M if and only if N  M. Thus, we may deal with
normal subgroups instead of congruence relations.
To
determine
the
normal
subgroup

associated
with
the

Products and Coproducts
The direct product is a familiar construction in many categories. Here is the formal deﬁnition
for general categories.

Chapter 4 · Cones and Limits

1 Definition
LetC be a category. Referring to Figure 54, letbe the diagram consisting of two objects A and B,
with no morphisms. Any limit of is called a product of A and B. Thus, a product of A and
B is a triple
A 	 B, ρ1: A 	 B ! A, ρ2: A 	 B ! B
ð
Þ
with the property that for any object X and morphisms f: X ! A and G: X ! B, there exists a
unique mediating morphism θ: X ! A 	 B for which the diagram in Figure 54 commutes, that
is, for which
ρ1 ∘θ ¼ f and ρ2 ∘θ ¼ g
The maps ρ1 and ρ2 are called the projection maps.
□
Although it is quite misleading, it is common to denote a product simply as A 	 B, without
explicit mention of the projection maps. Since the product is a limit, we know immediately that
all products of A and B are isomorphic.
Note that two morphisms α, β: X ! A 	 B are equal if and only if
ρ1 ∘α ¼ ρ1 ∘β and ρ2 ∘α ¼ ρ2 ∘β
This is a common application of the uniqueness of the mediating morphism.
Once the product of two objects is deﬁned, it is not hard to generalize to the product of any
nonempty family F ¼
Ai
 i 2 I


of objects in C. Let be the diagram consisting of the
objects in F, with no morphisms. A product of F is a limit in the category of cones over . In
other words, the product is a pair
∏
i 2 I
Ai,
ρi: ∏
i 2 I
Ai ! Ai
	



where
∏
i 2 I
Ai ¼ ∏F
is an object and the morphisms ρi are called projections, with the following property: If
X is any object of C with morphisms gi: X ! Ai then there is a unique mediating morphism
θ: X ! ∏F for which ρi ∘θ ¼ gi. If any pair of objects has a product, then C has binary

Products and Coproducts

products. If any ﬁnite family of objects has a product, then C has ﬁnite products. If any family
of objects has a product, then C has products.
The dual notion to product is coproduct, denoted by +, whose deﬁning digraphs are the
duals of the diagrams in Figure 54. We leave it to the reader to formulate the precise deﬁnition
of coproduct.
One note on notation: In older literature, the product is denoted by u and the coproduct by t.
A careful look at the deﬁnition of product shows that the product of the empty family is an
object T with the property that there is exactly one morphism entering T from any object, that
is, T is terminal. In short, the product of the empty family is a terminal object, if one exists.
Otherwise, the product does not exist.
Similarly, the coproduct of the empty family is an initial object in C, if it exists. As a result,
the statement that a category has ﬁnite products implies that it also has a terminal object and
similarly for coproducts. If C has both ﬁnite products and ﬁnite coproducts, then C has a zero
object.
Since products are limits, they are deﬁned up to isomorphism. This is also true of the
projection maps. For if
A 	 B, ρ1: A 	 B ! A, ρ2: A 	 B ! B
ð
Þ
is a product of A and B and if λ: A 	 B  A 	 B is an isomorphism, then
A 	 B, ρ1 ∘λ: A 	 B ! A, ρ2 ∘λ: A 	 B ! B
ð
Þ
is also a product of A and B.
We leave it as an exercise to show that, in general, the projection morphisms of a product
need not be epic (right-cancellable). However, it is often the case that projections are not only
epic, but right-invertible.
1 Theorem 86
Let C be a category. Assume that the product (A 	 B, ρ1, ρ2) exists. If there is at least one
morphism f: A ! B, then ρ1 is right-invertible. If there is at least one morphism f: B ! A, then
ρ2 is right-invertible.
1 Proof
The diagrams in Figure 55 tell the whole story. They show the product of A and B along with
two cones, one with vertex A and the other with vertex B. Here fAB is any morphism from
A to B and fBA is any morphism from B to A.
Figure 55

Chapter 4· Cones and Limits

Since ρ1 ∘θ ¼ 1A, it follows that ρ1 is right-invertible. Similarly, ρ2 ∘μ ¼ 1B implies that
ρ2 is right-invertible.
□
1 Example 87
1) In Set, the product is the cartesian product, with the usual projections.
2) In Grp, Mod and Rng, the product is the usual direct product of groups, modules or rings,
deﬁned coordinatewise.
3) In Poset(P ), the product is the least upper bound.
4) In Poset, the category of all posets, with monotone maps, there are two potential candidates
for the product
P 	 Q, ρ1, ρ2

of posets P and Q. The product order on the cartesian product P 	 Q is deﬁned by
p1; q1

and

The set P 	 Q with this order is called the product of P and Q. Also, the lexicographic
order on the cartesian product P 	 Q is deﬁned by
p1; q1
ð
Þ 
 p2; q2
ð
Þ
if
p1 < p2
or
p1 ¼ p2
and
q1

ð
Þ
This is also a partial order on P 	 Q. We leave it as an exercise to determine which of these
candidates gives the categorical product. (Or is it both?)
5) In the exercises, we ask the reader to show that the category Field does not have products.□

In Set, the coproduct is the disjoint union A t B of the sets (with the obvious inclusions).

In Grp, the coproduct is the free product of groups, in fact, this is often taken as the deﬁnition of
the free product. In AbGrp, ModR and VectF, the coproduct is the usual direct sum of abelian
groups, modules and vector spaces, respectively. Thus, ﬁnite coproducts are the same as ﬁnite
products, but inﬁnite coproducts differ from their product counterparts. In CRng, the coprod-
uct of commutative rings is their tensor product. In Poset(P ), the coproduct is the greatest
lower bound.

Pullbacks and Pushouts
We next look at pullbacks and pushouts.
1 Definition
Let C be a category. As shown in Figure 56, a pullback of the pair (f: A ! C, g: B ! C) is a
terminal cone over the diagram .
Pullbacks and Pushouts

Thus, a pullback is a triple
P, α: P ! A, β: P ! B
ð
Þ
(along with the determined third leg from P to C ) for which
g ∘α ¼ f ∘β
and with the property that for any object X and morphisms h: X ! A and k: X ! B for which
f ∘k ¼ g ∘h
there exists a unique mediating morphism θ: X ! P for which
α ∘θ
and
β ∘θ ¼ k
Referring to Figure 56, α is called the pullback of f along g and β is called the pullback of g
along f.
□
In any category C, pullbacks, equalizers and products are related as follows:
pullbacks and terminal objects
)
finite products
binary products and equalizers
)
pullbacks
We leave proof of the ﬁrst statement as an exercise and prove the second.
1 Theorem 89
If a category C has binary products and equalizers, then it has pullbacks. In fact, a pullback of
¼ f: A ! C, g: B ! C
f
g can be obtained as follows: As shown in Figure 57, let

be an equalizer of the lower and upper diagonal maps
f ∘ρ1: A 	 B ! C
and
g ∘ρ2: A 	 B ! C
Then the triple
U ¼ E, ρ1 ∘e: E ! A, ρ2 ∘e: E ! B
ð
Þ
is a pullback of .
1 Proof
As shown in Figure 58, if X ¼ X; h; k
ð
Þ is a cone over , that is, if
f ∘h ¼ g ∘k
(90)
then we must show that there is a unique mediating morphism α: X ! E for which
ρ1 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘α ¼ h
and
ρ2 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘α ¼ k
(91)
Figure 57

Now, by deﬁnition of the product, there exists a unique θ: X ! P for which
ρ1 ∘θ ¼ h
and
ρ2 ∘θ ¼ k
(92)
Substituting these expressions for h and k in (90) gives
f ∘ρ1 ∘θ ¼ g ∘ρ2 ∘θ
Thus, θ also equalizes the upper and lower paths and so there is a unique α: X ! E for which
e ∘α ¼ θ
Substituting into (92) gives
ρ1 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘α ¼ h
and
ρ2 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘α ¼ k
which is (91) as desired.
As to uniqueness, if μ: X ! E is another such mediating morphism, that is, if
ρ1 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘μ ¼ h
and
ρ2 ∘e
ð
Þ ∘μ ¼ k
then the uniqueness of θ satisfying (92) implies that
e ∘μ ¼ θ ¼ e ∘α
But the equalizer arrow e is monic and so μ ¼ α.
□
1 Example 93
The previous theorem gives us a strong sense of what the pullback looks like in many familiar
categories. For instance, in Set, we equalize the upper and lower diagonals
f ∘ρ1: A 	 B ! C
and
g ∘ρ2: A 	 B ! C
to get
E ¼
a; b
ð
Þ 2 A 	 B

with legs equal to the restriction of the projection maps ρ1 and ρ2 to the set E. This shows that
pullbacks are a form of “super diagonalization” based on the functions f and g.
□
The pullback of a monic is monic. However, the pullback of an epic need not be epic.
1 Theorem 94
Let C be a category.
1) If a monic in C has a pullback, then the pullback is also monic.
2) The pullback of an epic need not be epic.
3) The pullback of a right-invertible morphism is right-invertible.
4) The pullback of an isomorphism is an isomorphism.
104
Chapter 4· Cones and Limits
4

1 Proof
For part 1), Figure 59 shows a pullback P ¼ P; α; β
ð
Þ for {f, g}, where g is monic.
To show that α is also monic, let
α ∘h ¼ α ∘k
To show that h ¼ k, we show that h and k are mediating arrows for P. First note that
β ∘h ¼ β ∘k
since
g ∘β ∘h ¼ f ∘α ∘h ¼ f ∘α ∘k ¼ g ∘β ∘k
and since g is left-cancellable. Thus, all paths from X to either A, B or C commute. It follows
that
X ¼ X, α ∘h ¼ α ∘k, β ∘h ¼ β ∘k
ð
Þ
is a cone over {f: A ! C, g: B ! C} and that both h and k are mediating arrows from X to P,
whence h ¼ k. We leave proof of the remaining statements as an exercise.
□
One can easily generalize the pullback to families F ¼ fi: Ai ! A
f
g of morphisms with
the same codomain A: A pullback of F is a terminal cone over the cocone with vertex A and
legs fi: Ai ! A.
The dual construction to the pullback is the pushout. We leave it to the reader to formulate
the deﬁnition and to show that the pushout of two set functions f: C ! A and g: C ! B is the
disjoint union of A and B, but with elements that have the same preimage under f and
g identiﬁed.

Exponentials
Let us begin with some motivation. Let A, B and C be sets. The exponential notation C B
is often used to denote the family of set functions from B to C. Now consider a set function
f: A 	 B ! C of two variables. We can turn f into a function τf : A ! C B of one variable by
letting τf (a) be the function deﬁned by
τf a
ð Þ b
ð Þ ¼ f a; b
ð
Þ
(95)
It is clear that f and τf determine each other uniquely, that is, if σ: A ! CB satisﬁes
σ a
ð Þ b
ð Þ ¼ f a; b
ð
Þ
then σ ¼ τf. This is a technique that computer scientists refer to as currying. (Speciﬁcally,
currying is the technique of transforming a function of several arguments into a function of the
ﬁrst argument that returns a function of the remaining arguments. The technique was named
after the logician Haskell Curry.)
To make this notion categorical, we need to remove mention of elements. To this end,
deﬁne the evaluation function ϵ to be the map that takes a function α 2 CB and an element
b in the domain B and gives α(b) 2 C, that is,
ϵ: CB 	 B ! C,
ϵ α; b
ð
Þ ¼ α b
ð Þ
Then (95) can be written in the form
ϵ τf a
ð Þ, b


¼ f a; b
ð
Þ
or
ϵ ∘τf 	 1B


a; b
ð
Þ ¼ f a; b
ð
Þ
or ﬁnally,
ϵ ∘τf 	 1B


¼ f
This looks a lot like a couniversal mapping property.
Figure 60

To this end, deﬁne the “product by B” functor GB: C ) C by
GB A
ð Þ ¼ A 	 B,
GB f
ð Þ ¼ f 	 1B
for A 2 C and f 2 Mor C
ð Þ. Then with reference to Figure 60, for any f: A 	 B ! C, there is
a unique τf : A ! CB for which
f ¼ ϵ ∘GBτf
(96)
Let us generalize this construction.
1 Definition
Let C be a category with binary products and let B, C 2 C. As shown in Figure 60, an
exponential of B with C consists of a pair
CB, ϵ: CB 	 B ! C


where CB is an object of C and where the following property holds: For any object X 2 C and
morphism
f: X 	 B ! C
there is a unique morphism τf: X ! CB for which
ϵ ∘τf 	 1B


¼ f
The map ϵ is called evaluation and the morphism τf is called the (exponential) transpose of f.□
1 Example 97
Consider the category Poset of all posets, with monotone maps. Let P, Q 2 Poset. Using the
example of Set, we guess that the exponential
QP, ϵ: QP 	 P ! Q


is given as follows. Let QP be the set of all monotone maps from P to Q and let ϵ be deﬁned by
ϵ g; p
ð
Þ ¼ g p
ð Þ
To see if this is an exponential, suppose that f: X 	 P ! Q is a monotone map. Deﬁne
τf: X ! QP as the curried version of f, that is,
τj x
ð Þ ¼ f x; 
ð
Þ
To see that τf is monotone, if x 
 y, then for all p 2 P, we have (x, p) 
 (y, p) in X 	 P and so
τf x
ð Þ p
ð Þ ¼ f x; p
ð
Þ 
 f y; p
ð

which implies that τf (x) 
 τf (y). Then we have

then

for all p 2 P and all x 2 X and so μ ¼ τf .
□
1 Example 98
Consider the category Grp and let G be a group. Using the example of Set, we guess that the
exponential
GG, ϵ: GG 	 G ! G


is given as follows. Let GG be the set of all group homomorphisms from G to itself and let ϵ be
deﬁned by
ϵ f; a

To see if this is an exponential, suppose that f: X 	 G ! G is a group homomorphism.
Deﬁne τf: X ! GG by

To see if τf is a group homomorphism, let x, y 2 X. Then we want to show that

or applying it to a 2 G,
f xy; a

ð
Þ
which looks a bit untrue in general, thus putting the existence of group exponentials in serious
doubt.
108
Chapter 4· Cones and Limits
4

In fact, if we take X ¼ {1}, then the existence of exponentials would imply that there is
a bijection between group homomorphisms f: {1} 	 G ! G and mediating morphisms
τf: {1} ! GG. But there are in general many of the former and only one of the latter! Thus, the
category Grp does not have exponentials.
□
Existence of Limits
Let us now consider the question of the existence of arbitrary limits in a category. In general, it
is too much to expect a category to have arbitrary limits. For example, in Set, the diagram
consisting of all sets cannot have a product, since this would be the Cartesian product of all sets,
which is not a set. Thus, we restrict attention to small diagrams.
1 Definition
1) A diagram in a category C is called a small diagram if the class of objects of is a set
and a ﬁnite diagram if the class of objects of is a ﬁnite set.
2) A category C. is complete if every small diagram has a limit and ﬁnitely complete if every
ﬁnite diagram has a limit. Dually, C is cocomplete if every small diagram has a colimit and
ﬁnitely cocomplete if every ﬁnite diagram has a colimit.
□
We assume in the following discussion that all diagrams are small diagrams and use
the term small product to denote the product of a small diagram. Our main theorem says that
ifis a small diagram in a categoryC that has equalizers and if certain small products related to
exist, then has a limit in C.
Note that since the presence or absence of loops labeled with an identity morphism in a
diagram does not change the cone category over , this has no effect on the existence of a
limit. Therefore, in order to ensure that every node inhas in-degree at least 1, we may assume
that every node has a loop labeled with the appropriate identity morphism.
Now let be a small diagram in C, as shown on the left in Figure 61. For clarity, we have
omitted the loops at each node labeled with identity morphisms. Let
Dk
 k 2 K


be the multiset of objects that label the nodes of , where the index set K indexes the nodes of
. (A multiset is a “set” in which each element may appear more than once.) Thus, Dk and Dj
need not be distinct objects for k 6¼ j.
As shown in Figure 61, we make two new diagrams from. The diagram consists of just
the nodes of . To make the diagram þ, if a node of has in-degree mk in , then þ has mk
nodes, each labeled with Dk.
Existence of Limits

Now we can state the general result.
1 Theorem 99
Let C be a category with equalizers. Let be a diagram in C and let
Dk
 k 2 K


be the multiset of objects labeling the nodes of . Assume the following:
1) The product
P ¼ P; ρk
 k 2 K




of the diagram  deﬁned above exists.
2) The product
Q ¼ Q; πk,i: Q ! Dk
 k 2 K, 1 
 i 
 mk




of the diagram þ deﬁned above exists.
Then þ has a limit in C. In particular, if C has equalizers and small products, then C is complete
and if C has equalizers and ﬁnite products, then C is ﬁnitely complete.
1 Proof
The proof is illustrated in Figure 62.
Figure 61
110
Chapter 4· Cones and Limits
4

The ﬁgure shows a node of with in-degree mk ¼ 2 and object label Dk, which manifests
itself in the diagram þ as a pair of nodes labeled Dk. Two morphisms
fd k;1
ð
Þ: Dd k;1
ð
Þ ! Dk
and
fd k;2
ð
Þ: Dd k;2
ð
Þ ! Dk
in that enter Dk are also shown. The ﬁgure shows the vertices P and Q of the products of 
and þ,
P ¼ P ¼ ∏, ρk:P ! Dk
ð
Þ
Q ¼ Q ¼ ∏þ, πk,i:Q ! Dk
ð
Þ
Notice that the projections πk,i for the product Q are doubly indexed because each object in 
may be duplicated in þ. For example, since the object Dk appears twice in þ, we need two
projections from Q to Dk, labeled πk,1 and πk,2.
The projections ρk of the product P of  can be used to deﬁne two cones over þ, both
with vertex P. The ﬁrst cone is obtained by simply duplicating each projection ρk a total of mk
times, giving the cone
K1 ¼ P; ρk,i:P ! Dk
 k 2 K, 1 
 i




where ρk,i ¼ ρk.
The second cone over þ uses the morphisms of . Speciﬁcally, each leg of this cone is a
path of length 2 that consists of a projection to the domain of each morphism fd(k,i) of ,
followed by the morphism fd(k,i) itself. Thus,

Now, since Q is a product of þ, there are unique mediating morphisms θ1, θ2: P ! Q,
corresponding to the two cones K1. and K2, for which
πk,i ∘θ1 ¼ ρk
and
πk,i ∘θ2 ¼ fd k;i
ð
Þ ∘ρd k;i
ð
Þ
If (E, e: E ! P) is the equalizer of θ1 and θ2, then applying e to the right gives the two

πk,i ∘θ1 ∘e ¼ ρk ∘e
and
πk,i ∘θ2 ∘e ¼ fd k;i
ð
Þ ∘ρd k;i

and since θ1 ∘e ¼ θ2 ∘e, the left sides are equal and therefore so are the right sides, whence
ρk ∘e ¼ fd k;i
ð
Þ ∘ρd k;i
ð
Þ ∘e
This says that the pair
E ¼ E; ρk ∘e: E ! Dk
 k 2 K




is a cone over , since the morphisms {fd(k,i)} constitute a complete set of morphisms in .

X ¼ X; βk: X ! Dk

Since X is also a cone over , there is a unique mediating morphism μ: X ! P for which
ρk ∘μ ¼ βk
The map μ right-equalizes θ1 and θ2, since for all projections πk,i, we have
πk,i ∘θ1 ∘μ

πk,i ∘θ2 ∘μ
ð

Hence, there is a unique mediating morphism λ: X ! E for which
e ∘λ ¼ μ
But then

Þ ∘λ ¼ ρk ∘μ ¼ βk
which shows that λ: X ! E is a cone morphism from X to E. As to uniqueness, if

Completeness
We have mentioned that if C has pullbacks and a terminal object, then C has ﬁnite products.
Therefore, since an equalizer is a special type of pullback, we have the following result.
1 Theorem 100
Let C be a category. The following are equivalent:
1) C is complete.
2) C has equalizers and small products.
The following are also equivalent:
3) C is ﬁnitely complete.
4) C has equalizers and ﬁnite products.
5) C has pullbacks and a terminal object.

Inverse and Direct Systems
A partially ordered set N is directed if for any i, j 2 N, there is a k 2 N for which k > i and
k > j. We make the following deﬁnitions, which are standard for speciﬁc cases (such as the
category of groups or modules) but perhaps not standard in the general setting of a category.
1 Definition
Let C be a category. An inverse system is a diagram in C with the following properties:
1) The objects of are indexed by a directed partially ordered set N.
2) There is exactly one morphism
fi,j: Aj ! Ai
between each pair (Ai, Aj) of objects of with i 
 j (note the direction of the morphisms).
3) fi,i ¼ 1Ai is the identity for all i 2 N

Adjoints
S. Roman, An Introduction to the Language of Category Theory, Compact Textbooks
in Mathematics, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41917-6_5, © The Author(s) 2017
It has been said that the notion of an adjoint is the pinnacle notion in category theory; that it is
the culmination and perhaps even the raison d'être of all of the theory that comes before it. It
has also been said that adjoints are both unifying and ubiquitious in mathematics and have a
strong and powerful presence in other disciplines as well, such as computer science.
There are many approaches to the study of adjoints and it seems as though every
source uses a somewhat different tack. We will approach the subject through the concept of
(bi)naturalness.
To improve readibility, we will often write GD)C in place of G: D ) C.
Binaturalness

g ¼ τC,D
f

ð
Þ $ homC FC, D
ð
Þ
be a doubly indexed family of maps. Thus, C ranges over the objects of C and D ranges over
the objects of D. Then we can combine Theorem 64 and Theorem 78 as follows. Note that
U ¼ FC in Theorem 64 and S ¼ GD in Theorem 78.

The Unit-Counit Structure
Theorem 101 is centered on the families τC,D
f
gC,D of bijections. We can also take the point of
view of the families of maps
uC: C ! GFC
f
gC
and
vD: FGD ! D
f
gD
To begin, we note a special case of the fusion formulas that involve only these two families.
Speciﬁcally, setting C ¼ GD and hFGD,D ¼ vD in the ﬁrst fusion formula gives
τ1
GD,D vD
ð
Þ ¼ GvD ∘uC
But vD ¼ τGD,D(1GD) and so
GvD ∘uC ¼ 1GD
Similarly,
vFC ∘FuC ¼ 1FC
It will be convenient to call these two formulas the basic fusion formulas.
Now, in the setting of Theorem 101, if f : C ! C0, then
uC0 ∘f: C ! GFC0
and so the direct fusion formula gives
τC,FC0 uC0 ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ vFC0 ∘F uC0 ∘f
ð
Þ
¼ vFC0 ∘FuC0 ∘Ff
¼ vFC0 ∘Fτ1
C0,FC0 1FC0
ð
Þ ∘Ff
¼ 1FC0 ∘Ff
¼ Ff
Hence,
τ1
C,FC0 FfC,C0


¼ uC0 ∘fC,C0
(102)
and the inverse fusion formula gives
GF fC,C0 ∘uC ¼ uC0 ∘fC,C0
This says that the family
uC
f
gC is a natural transformation from the identity functor to the
composite functor GF,
uC
f
gC: IC _! GF
The Unit-Counit Structure

Dually, we leave it to the reader to show that the fusion formulas also imply that
vD ∘FGhD0,D ¼ hD0,D ∘vD0
and so
vD
f
g: FG _! ID
Thus, the units and counits of an adjunction are natural transformations. Of course, they also
satisfy the basic fusion formulas.
Conversely, suppose that we start with natural transformations
uC
f
gC: IC _! GF
and
vD
f
gD: FG _! ID
that satisfy the basic fusion formulas. Then we deﬁne a family of maps
τC,D: homC C, GD
ð
Þ ! homD FC, D
ð
Þ
by what would be the direct fusion formula
τC,D fC,GD


¼ vD ∘FfC,GD
(103)
The naturalness of {uC} and the basic fusion formulas give for any f: C ! GD,
G vD ∘Ff
ð
Þ ∘uC ¼ GvD ∘GFf ∘uC
¼ GvD ∘uGD ∘f
¼ 1GD ∘f
¼ f
and so
GτC,D fC,GD


∘uC ¼ fC,GD
Hence, τC,D has left inverse
μC,D hFC,D
ð
Þ ¼ G hFC,D
ð
Þ ∘uC
(104)
Moreover, the naturalness of {vD} and the basic fusion formulas imply that for any h: FC ! D
τC,D μC,D hFC,D




¼ vD ∘F GhFC,D ∘uC
ð
Þ
¼ vD ∘FGhFC,D ∘FuC
¼ hFC,D ∘vFC ∘FuC
¼ hFC,D ∘1FC
¼ hFC,D
Thus, the maps τC,D are bijections, μC,D ¼ τ1
C,D and so (103) and (104) are the two fusion
formulas. In summary, the fusion formulas imply the naturalness of the families
uC
f
gC and
vD
f
gD (and the basic fusion formulas) and conversely, the naturalness of these two families and
the basic fusion formulas imply the fusion formulas.
This calls for a deﬁnition followed by a theorem.

Uniqueness of Adjoints
Adjoints are not unique, but they are unique up to natural isomorphism. Here is the formula-
tion for left adjoints.
1 Theorem 106
The left adjoints of a functor G: D ) C are unique up to natural isomorphism, that is, if F a G,
then
F a G
,
F _ F
1 Proof
Since F a G, we have
GFf ∘uC ¼ uC0 ∘f
(107)
Moreover, F a G if and only if
GFf ∘uC ¼ uC0 ∘f
(108)
Assume ﬁrst that (108) holds. We want to show that there is a natural isomorphism
λC
f
g: F _ F, that is, that
Ff ¼ λC0 ∘Ff ∘λ1
C
(109)
for all f : C ! C0. But since (FC, uC: C ! GFC) and
FC, uC: C ! GFC


are universal
pairs for (C, G), Theorem 74 implies that there are isomorphisms λC: FC  FC for which
uC ¼ GλC ∘uC
Hence, the properties of the units imply that

ð
Þ ∘uC0 ∘f

¼ GFf ∘uC
and since the map ξ ↦Gξ ∘vC is injective, we get (109).
For the converse, suppose that (109) holds. Then λC: FC ! FC for each C 2 C. Let

and this completes the deﬁnition of the functor F, but it remains to show that F a G. This is
where Theorem 110 provides several alternatives (that is, pick one from section 1 and one from
section 2).
1 Example 111 (Free Groups)
First a few observations about free groups. If FX is the free group on a nonempty set X, then a set
function f: X ! A from X to a group A induces a group homomorphism f: F X ! A deﬁned
by

where xi 2 X. More generally, a set function f: X ! Y induces a group homomorphism
f: F X ! F Y between free groups.
Now let Set be the category of nonempty sets and let G: Grp ) Set be the underlying-set
functor, which forgets all algebraic structure and sends group homomorphisms to set
functions. We have seen that the family
F X,uX: X ! GF X
ð
Þ
f
gX 2 Set
where uX is set inclusion is universal. Now, the mediating morphisms

are given by the equation

ð
Þ ∘uX ¼ f

for all set functions f: X ! GA and so if x 2 X, then
τX,A f x
ð Þ ¼ f x
ð Þ
which means that τX,A(f): FX ! A is the group homomorphism that agrees with f on X, that
is,
τX,A f
ð Þ ¼ f
A candidate for left adjoint F: C ) D is the functor with object part FX ¼ FX and arrow part
satisfying
FfX,Y ¼ τX,A uY ∘fX,Y


¼ uY ∘fX,Y ¼ fX,Y
To verify that F a G, we check the binaturalness of τX,A. The naturalness of τX,A in X is
τX,A g ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ τX0,A g
ð Þ ∘Ff
that is,
g ∘f ¼ g ∘f
for all f: X ! X0 and g: X0 ! GA, which is true. Naturalness in A is
τX,A0 Gg ∘f
ð
Þ ¼ g ∘τX,A f
ð Þ
that is,
g ∘f ¼ g ∘f
for all g: A ! A0 and f: X ! GA, which holds since g is a group homomorphism. Thus, the
free group functor is the left adjoint the forgetful functor.

1 Example 112
Let U: Vectk ) Set be the underlying-set functor. In a manner similar to that of Example
111, one can show that the functor that sends each nonempty set X to the vector space kX
over k with basis X and sends each set function f: X ! Y to the unique linear extension
τ: kX ! kY is a left adjoint for U.

To see that τX is a cone over , we must show that

ð

Since τX is a cone, there is a unique mediating morphism θ: FX ! V for which

Moreover, the map

It remains to show uniqueness. If λ: X ! GV satisﬁes

then
τX,DhD ¼ τX,D GfD ∘λ

since
G fD ∘τX,Dλ

and so the uniqueness of θ implies that λ ¼ τ1

□
The Existence of Adjoints
We now come to one of the most important theorems in category theory, called the adjoint
functor theorem, which characterizes the existence of adjoints. Let us state the theorem now.
The proof will follow shortly.
1 Theorem 117 (Adjoint functor theorem)
Let D be a complete category. A functor G: D ) C has a left adjoint F: C ) D if and only if the
following hold:
1) G preserves limits
2) G satisﬁes the solution set condition for all C 2 C.
□
The Solution Set Condition
To understand the solution set condition, let us start from the bottom and work up. Let
G: D ) C and let C 2 C. We refer to a map of the form f: C ! GD, for D 2 D as a source
morphism. For any source morphism f, we refer to a factorization of the form
Gτ ∘u ¼ f
(118)
The Existence of Adjoints
135

where
u: C ! GS
and
τ: S ! D
as an (S, u)-factorization for f with mediating morphism τ. The pair
U ¼ S, u: C ! GS
ð
Þ
(119)
for which there is an (S, u)-factorization of f is known as a solution for f (although it may
seem more reasonable to refer to the mediating morphism τ as a solution for the pair (S, u)).
We call the object S a solution object and the map u in a solution (S, u) a solution map.
Thus, a pair (S, u: C ! GS) is universal if and only if every source morphism has a unique
(S, u)-factorization. We can weaken the universality condition by removing the requirement
that mediating morphisms must be unique. Let us say that a pair (S, u: C ! GS) is
quasiuniversal (a nonstandard term) if every source morphism has a (perhaps nonunique)
(S, u)-factorization. Put another way, a pair (S, u: C ! GS) is quasiuniversal if it is a solution
for all source morphisms.
Actually, any morphism f: C ! GD has at least one (S, u)-factorization, namely,
G1D ∘f ¼ f
that is, any morphism f: C ! GD has at least one solution
D, f: C ! GD
ð
Þ
(120)
So it might seem now that this deﬁnition is useless, but stay tuned.
A solution class SC for G: D ) C and C 2 C is any class that contains a solution (S, u) for
every possible source morphism f: C ! GD and every D 2 D. Any class that contains the
pairs (120) is a solution class. However, in general, solution classes are proper classes, that is,
they are not sets. We can now deﬁne the solution set condition.
1 Definition
A functor G: D ) C satisﬁes the solution set condition for a given C 2 C if there is a solution
class that is actually a set.
□
In more colloquial terms, G: D ) C satisﬁes the solution set condition for a given C 2 C if
there is a set worth of pairs (S, u: C ! GS) that provide a solution for all source morphisms.
Note that a solution U is quasiuniversal if and only if the set U
f g is a solution set and so if a
quasiuniversal pair exists for (C, G), then G satisﬁes the solution set condition for C.
One
half
of
the
adjoint
functor
theorem
now
follows
quite
easily.
For
if
U ¼ U, u: C ! GU
ð
Þ is a universal pair for (C, G), then G has the solution set condition
for C. Therefore, if G has a left adjoint, then G satisﬁes the solution set condition for all C 2 C.
Since we have already proven that G also preserves limits, we have proved one half of the
adjoint functor theorem. To prove the converse, we must take a closer look at factorizations
and solutions.
136
Chapter 5· Adjoints
5

A Closer Look at Factorizations and Solutions
Solutions have a form of “absorption property” described as follows. Suppose that a source
morphism f: C ! GS has a solution (S, u) with factorization
Gτ ∘u ¼ f
If (T, v) is a solution for u with factorization
Gσ ∘v ¼ u
then
G τ ∘σ
ð
Þ ∘v ¼ Gτ ∘Gσ ∘v ¼ Gτ ∘u ¼ f
and so (T, v) is also a solution for f. Therefore, if (T, v) is a common solution for all solution
maps in a solution set SC, then (T, v) is a solution for every source morphism. Let us record
these facts in a theorem.
1 Theorem 121
Let G: D ) C and let C 2 C.
1) If (S, u) is a solution for f: C ! GD then any solution (T, v) for the solution map u is also a
solution for f.
2) If SC is a solution set for C and if (T, v) is a common solution for every solution map u in SC,
then (T, v) is a quasiuniversal pair for (C, G).
3) If (S, u) is a quasiuniversal pair for (C, G) and if (T, v) is a solution for u, then (T, v) is also a
quasiuniversal pair for (C, G).

Gρi ∘θ ¼ ui
for all i, θ is a common solution map for all of the solution maps ui in the solution setSC and so
the pair (P, θ) is quasiuniversal for (C, G).
□
The Adjoint Functor Theorem
We can now prove the adjoint functor theorem.
1 Theorem 123 (Adjoint functor theorem–Freyd 1964)
Let D be a complete category. A functor G: D ) C has a left adjoint F: C ) D if and only if the
following hold:
1) G preserves limits
2) G satisﬁes the solution set condition for all C 2 C.
1 Proof
One direction has been proved. Assume that 1) and 2) hold. Fix C 2 C. Since C has a solution
set, Theorem 122 implies that there is a quasiuniversal pair (S, u) for (C, G). The story of the
proof that there is a universal pair for (C, G) is told in Figure 69.
138
Chapter 5· Adjoints
5

By way of motivation, since (S, u) is quasiuniversal and u: C ! GS, there is a mediating
morphism τ: S ! S for u itself, that is,
Gτ ∘u ¼ u
Of course, the identity is one such mediating morphism, but there may be others. Suppose that
τ is one such nonidentity mediating morphism. If f: C ! GD is a source morphism, with
mediating morphism σ, that is, if
Gσ ∘u ¼ f
then Theorem 121 implies that σ ∘τ is also a mediating morphism for f. Therefore, it is
unlikely that (S, u) will be universal.
This gives us the idea of trying to ﬁnd a quasiuniversal pair (E, θ) for which θ has only one
mediating morphism (which will be the identity). One way to achieve this goal is to equalize all
of the mediating morphisms for u with respect to (S, u).
So let
T ¼
τ: S ! S
 Gτ ∘u ¼ u


The right side of Figure 69 shows two such maps τi and τj. Let
E ¼ E, e: E ! S
ð
Þ
be the equalizer of the setT . On the left side of the ﬁgure, we ﬁnd the G-image of this structure,
along with the cone
K ¼ C; u: C ! GS
f
g
ð
Þ
over G. The cone condition for K is that
Gτi ∘u ¼ u
which is precisely the condition that τi 2 T . Now, since GE is an equalizer of GT , there is a
unique mediating morphism θE: C ! GE for which
Figure 69
The Existence of Adjoints
139
5

Ge ∘θE ¼ u
(124)
We wish to show that (E, θE) is a universal pair for (C, G).
Equation (124) says that (E, θE) is a solution for u and so Theorem 121 implies that (E, θE)
is a quasiuniversal pair for (C, G). It remains to establish uniqueness of mediating morphisms.
So let f: C ! GD and suppose that
Gσ ∘θE ¼ f ¼ Gσ0 ∘θE
for σ, σ0: E ! D. Let (Q, q: Q ! E) be the equalizer of σ and σ0. Then (GQ, Gq: GQ ! GE)
is the equalizer of Gσ and Gσ0 and so there exists a unique θQ: C ! GE for which
Gq ∘θQ ¼ θE
Since θQ : C ! GE, there is a φ: S ! Q for which
Gφ ∘u ¼ θQ
Now, if
σ ¼ e ∘q ∘φ
then
Gσ ∘u ¼ Ge ∘Gq ∘Gφ ∘u
¼ Ge ∘Gq ∘θQ
¼ Ge ∘θE
¼ u
and so σ 2 T . It follows that σ ∘e ¼ τ ∘e for all τ 2 T , including the identity 1S 2 T . Hence,
e ¼ σ ∘e ¼ e ∘q ∘φ ∘e
Since e is monic, this gives
q ∘φ ∘e ¼ 1S
which shows that the monic q is also right-invertible and is therefore an isomorphism. Thus,
σ ∘q ¼ σ0 ∘q implies that σ ¼ σ0. This establishes uniqueness and shows that (E, θE) is
universal. Hence, G has a left adjoint.
□
1 Example 125
The adjoint functor theorem can be used to prove that the forgetful functor U: Grp ) Set has a
left adjoint F. This means that free groups exist for every generating set X!
To see this, suppose that X 2 Set. We must show that there is a set worth of pairs (H, u:
X ! H) that provide solutions for every set function f: X ! A, where A is a group. Let B be
the subgroup of A generated by the elements of f X. The generating set W ¼ {fxi} [ {( fxi)1}
140
Chapter 5· Adjoints
5

has the same or smaller cardinality as X and so the cardinality of B is bounded by the
cardinality of X, say |B|  α(|X|).
Now, consider a particular cardinality k  α(|X|). The family of all sets of cardinality k is
not a set. However, we can construct all groups of cardinality k up to isomorphism by taking a
single set S of cardinality k and scanning all of the k functions f: S  S ! S, picking out the
legal group operations. This shows that a family consisting of one group from each isomor-
phism class from among the groups of cardinality max{κ, ℵ0} is a set. Indeed, a family F
consisting of one group from each isomorphism class from among the groups of cardinality
max{k, α(|X|)} is a set.
Finally, the family of all pairs (H, u: X ! H) for H 2 F and all maps u is a solution set for
X. Hence, the solution set condition holds for every X 2 Set and so the forgetful functor
U: Grp ) Set has a left adjoint. This is a proof that free groups exist.

g ∘h ¼ 1C0 and so g is an isomophism.

morphism must send 1 to 1, the trivial ring {0} (in which 1 ¼ 0) is not initial but it is
terminal.
13. Consider all subcategories of C with the same objects as that of and that contain all of
the morphisms of . The full subcategory is one such category. The intersection of all such
categories is the smallest such category. D is the subcategory of C with objects the same
as the objects of and whose morphisms are the identity morphisms of objects in D, the
morphisms in and the compositions of ﬁnite sequences of morphisms of .

Hence, the sets g({bi}) form a partition of A. Now we can deﬁne f: A ! B to send the
elements of g({bi}) to bi for all bi 2 B. Clearly, f 1 ¼ g.
17. To show that monic does not necessarily imply injective, intuitively speaking, if the images
of all morphisms in a category C are conﬁned to a “restricted” set, then f need only be
well-behaved on this set in order to be left-cancellable. With this guidance, consider the
category C whose objects are the subsets of ℤand for which homC A; B
ð
Þ is the set of all
nonnegative set functions from A to B, along with the identity function when A ¼ B. In
this case, the images of all nonidentity morphisms are contained in the natural numbers ℕ.
Now, the absolute value function α: ℤ! ℕis monic since α ∘f ¼ f for all morphisms
f in C. On the other hand, α is clearly not injective.
To show that injective (and therefore also monic) does not necessarily imply left-
invertible, consider the inclusion map κ: ℤ! ℚbetween rings, which is injective.
However, κ is not left-invertible, since a left-inverse σ: ℚ! ℤwould satisfy σ ∘κ ¼ 1,
that is, σ(k) ¼ k for all integers k. This is not possible since, for example, it would imply
that σ(1/2) ¼ σ(1)/σ(2) ¼ 1/2, which is not an integer.
To see that epics are not necessarily surjective, if we can ﬁnd a category in which each
morphism leaving an object A is completely determined by its values on a proper subset
S of A, then the inclusion map i: S ! A, which is not surjective, will be right-cancellable.
To this end, the monoids ℕand ℤare additive monoids. Moreover, the inclusion map
κ: ℕ! ℤis not surjective. However, it is epic since if
g ∘κ ¼ h ∘κ
for g: ℤ! C and h: ℤ! C then g and h agree on all nonnegative integers. This implies
that g ¼ h, since for n > 0, we have (where e is the identity in C)
g n

Finally, to see that surjective (and therefore epic) maps are not always right-invertible,
let C ¼ hai be a cyclic group and let H ¼ ha2i. Consider the canonical projection map
π: C ! C/H ¼ {H, aH}. This map is surjective, but it is not right-invertible. In fact, any
group morphism σ: C/H ! C must send aH, which has order 2 to an element σ(aH)
of exponent 2 and so σ(aH) ¼ 1. Since σ(H) ¼ 1 as well, the only group morphism from
C/H to C is the zero map.

1. Let F: C ) D be a contravariant functor. Then since C and its opposite category Cop have
the same objects and the same morphisms (they even have the same hom-sets, but they are
associated to different pairs of objects), F can also be thought of as mapping the objects
and morphisms of Cop to the objects and morphisms of D. Moreover, if f: A ! B and
g: B ! C are morphisms in the opposite category Cop, then
F g ∘opf

3. For part a), to see that F is well deﬁned, if aG0 ¼ bG0, then b1a 2 G0 and so σ(b1a) 2 H0

f(aba1b1) ¼ f(a)f(b)f(a)1 f(b)1 2 C(H) and so the subgroup of G that maps into
C(H) contains all commutators, and therefore contains C(G). Clearly C preserves the

F(01): F(0) ! F(1). Moreover, every arrow f: A ! B in D gives rise to such a distinct
functor Ff from 2 to D. Hence, there is a bijection between the objects (functors) ofD2 and
the arrows of D.

21. Deﬁne a functor F: Set ) Set0 as follows: F sends A ¼ A + {} to A and if f: A ! B is a
partial function, then Ff: A ! B sends all elements of A ∖dom(f) to . To see that F is
a functor, note that F1 ¼ 1. Also, let f: A ! B and g: B ! C be partial functions. We

a) if x 2 dom(g ∘f) then (g ∘f)(x) ¼ x ¼ g(f(x))
b) if x 2 dom(f) ∖dom(g ∘f) then (g ∘f ) (x) ¼  ¼ g (f (x))
c) if x =2 dom(f) then (g ∘f ) (x) ¼  ¼ g (f (x))

F of the partial function σ: σ1(B) ! B obtained by restricting σ to σ1(B). Finally, if f,

5. The cones over {f: A ! B} are the same as the cones over the diagram {f: A ! B,
f: A ! B} and so a terminal cone is an equalizer of {f, f }, that is, an isomorphism.
7. A morphism in Field is either the zero map or an embedding. Let P ¼ P, ρ1: P ! A, ρ2:
ð
P ! BÞ be a product. Since hom(A, B) 6¼ ;, projections are surjective and so
isomorphisms. Thus, P ¼ A  B is isomorphic to A and to B. The product construction
implies that for any (X, f: X ! A, g: X ! B) there is a unique θ: X ! P such that
ρ1 ∘θ ¼ f
and
ρ2 ∘θ ¼ g
Now, if f ¼ 0 then θ ¼ 0 since ρ1 is an isomorphism. Hence, g ¼ 0. Thus, the cone
(B, 0, 1B) has no mediating morphism.
9. Lexicographic order does not work because the second projection is not monotone.
However, product order works just ﬁne.
13. Consider the category with 4 objects and 9 morphisms, as shown in the commutative
diagram below What is the dual of this result?
A
B
C
P
f
g
h
k
Since the only cone over {B, C} is (P, h, k), this must be the product of B and C. However,
h is not epic since f ∘h ¼ g ∘h but f 6¼ g.
15. For part a), let f, g: M ! N be R-maps. Let A ¼ im(f  g) and let π: N ! N/A be the
canonical projection map. Then for m 2 M,
π ∘f  g
ð
Þ m
ð
Þ ¼ A
and so π ∘f(m) ¼ π ∘g(m), whence π ∘f ¼ π ∘g. Now, if h: N ! X satisﬁes h ∘f ¼ h ∘g,
it follows that h ∘(f  g) ¼ 0 and so A ¼ im(f  g)  ker(h). Hence, there is a unique map
θ: N/A ! X for which θ ∘π ¼ h, as desired.
For part b), let f, g: R ! S be ring homomorphisms. Let A ¼ im(f  g) and let π: S ! S∕I
where I ¼ hAi is the ideal generated by A and π is the canonical projection map. Then for
r 2 R,
π ∘f  g
ð
Þ r
ð Þ ¼ I
and so π ∘f(r) ¼ π ∘g(r), whence π ∘f ¼ π ∘g. Now, if h: S ! X satisﬁes h ∘f ¼ h ∘g,
it follows that h ∘(f  g) ¼ 0 and so A ¼ im(f  g)  ker(h). Hence, there is a unique
map θ: S/I ! X for which θ ∘π ¼ h, as desired.

where f and g are the unique morphisms associated to the terminal object T. This follows
from the fact that f ∘α and g ∘β must be the unique morphism from X to T, which
makes the right-hand diagram commute. Thus, a limit in the cones over the left-hand
diagram, that is, a product, is a limit in the cones over the right-hand diagram, which is a
pullback for this diagram.

Since (α, θ) is a cone for the square on the left, there is a unique μ: X ! A1 for which

then we claim that μ0 satisﬁes (), in which case μ0 ¼ μ. To see this, we have already that
h1μ0 ¼ α. Also, we claim that f1μ0 ¼ θ, in which case, g1f1μ0 ¼ g1θ ¼ β and we are done.
