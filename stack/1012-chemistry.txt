Frank Cardulla, M.A. 
 
Niles North High School 
 
Describing himself as “a retired teacher who can’t seem to stay retired,” Professor Frank Cardulla is a 
veteran of 38 years of public high school teaching—35 of them at Niles North High School in Skokie, 
Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. He holds a B.S. in the Teaching of Chemistry and an M.A. in the 
Teaching of Physical Sciences, both from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as 
60 credit hours of postgraduate education at various institutions. 
During his tenure, Professor Cardulla has taught chemistry at every high school academic level. His 
primary assignments were to the first-year honors and second-year Advanced Placement courses at 
Niles North, where his students established a legacy filled with a long list of academic awards and 
scholarships in various competitions. Two former students worked closely with 2 Nobel Prize winners 
on the research for which their prizes were awarded. He has received citations from institutions such as 
MIT and the University of Chicago for being named “most influential teacher” by attending students. 
Average and struggling students have always held a special place in Professor Cardulla’s heart. Much 
of his time, effort, and thought has been directed toward developing an approach to solving 
introductory chemistry problems that will allow the average student to succeed. He helps students 
realize that what often seems a difficult subject is in reality a simple subject that utilizes the natural 
quantitative reasoning abilities that they possess. 
At every opportunity, Professor Cardulla has enthusiastically jumped at the chance to teach courses 
outside of the honors track. These courses have included regular-level traditional chemistry, 
Chemistry for the Health Sciences, and Chemistry in the Community. In addition, he has served as 
science seminar director, taught physics, and on one occasion taught a special education class of 6 
students, something he still calls “the most inspiring, enjoyable, and rewarding teaching experience I 
ever had.” He has also served as an Adjunct Professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, 
Illinois, teaching a science methods course for several years. 
Throughout his career, Professor Cardulla has been very active in helping to prepare numerous national 
chemistry examinations, serving on and chairing several American Chemical Society examinations 
committees that prepared examinations for both regular and Advanced Placement high school courses 
as well as the Chemistry in the Community Course and the first Conceptual Chemistry examination. In 
addition, he served as a member of the Advanced Placement Chemistry Test Development Committee 
that prepared 3 of the College Board’s Advanced Placement chemistry examinations. 
Professor Cardulla has delivered more than 30 presentations on a wide variety of topics, including several 
devoted to his approach to teaching problem solving that is utilized in this lecture series. Some notable 
titles include “Acid-Base Chemistry,” “History and Development of Modern Atomic Theory,” 
“Thermodynamics,” “Problem Solving,” “De Broglie’s Hypothesis and the Heisenberg Uncertainty 
Principle,” “The Life and Work of Louis de Broglie,” “Teaching Schrodinger’s Equation to High School 
Sophomores,” and “Teaching High School Chemistry Without Utilizing the Factor-Label Method.” 
Professor Cardulla has published several articles in the Journal of Chemical Education and 
ChemMatters magazine; he also served as a reviewer for the latter publication and as associate editor 
for an outreach program connected with NASA’s Aura project to study Earth’s atmosphere. 
Professor Cardulla’s contributions to chemical education have been recognized with numerous 
teaching awards, the most notable being a Presidential Award in Mathematics and Science Teaching, 
the National Catalyst Award, and the National James Bryant Conant Award. The last 2 are given to 
only 1  high school chemistry teacher in the nation each year.

Chemistry, 2nd Edition 
Scope: 
High school chemistry, unfortunately, is a subject that too often is either (1) avoided by many high 
school students whenever possible, (2) taken only because of college admission requirements, or  
(3) described later in life as “my worst subject.” 
This all-too-common view is the dragon that this course attempts to slay. 
The central tenet permeating all 36 lectures is that learning based on true understanding stands a 
higher chance of success in the long run. Rote memorization may succeed in the short term or be 
useful for learning a few basic concepts, but true understanding increases the likelihood of success as 
more concepts are added each lecture. 
The first lecture expounds this philosophy, followed by hopefully convincing demonstrations that 
solving most high school chemistry problems does not require any special talent or intellectual ability. 
The vast majority of high school students possess more than adequate mental equipment to succeed 
admirably, and they use naturally and easily in their daily lives the same kind of quantitative 
reasoning ability that is used to solve high school chemistry problems.  
Lectures Two and Three demonstrate how a student’s logical thinking skills can be used to perform 
basic calculations that are common throughout the course. We then discuss popular problem-solving 
techniques, emphasizing logical thinking instead of rote memorization of procedures or rules. We 
apply these quantitative reasoning skills to the simple concept of density in Lecture Four.  
Lecture Five follows with a discussion of that stalwart topic in high school chemistry courses—the 
International System of Units (SI), or the metric system. After a brief discussion of its history and 
advantages, we address SI basic and derived units, along with the metric prefixes encountered 
throughout the course. In Lecture Six we use this information to convert between SI and non-SI units.  
The next 3 lectures are devoted to preliminary ideas valuable both in and of themselves and 
containing information useful in later lessons. Lecture Seven explores the development of the 
periodic table, including a discussion of the elements. We then extend this discussion to include ions, 
chemical formulas, protons, electrons, and atomic weights in Lecture Eight. Lecture Nine concludes 
this preliminary overview with a discussion of isotopes, neutrons, and mass numbers, along with a 
general summary of the periodic table’s structure. 
Lecture Ten addresses the key topic permeating most high school problems—the mole. We explore 
the importance of this concept and its relationship to molar masses and Avogadro’s number. We use 
these relationships to solve sample mole-related problems in Lecture Eleven. In Lecture Twelve we 
examine the relationship between the mole and the molar volume of gases and apply these ideas to 
sample problems.  
Lecture Thirteen demonstrates how the mole concept can be applied to determine the percent 
composition of each element in a compound. We then use percent compositions and other laboratory 
data to determine empirical and molecular formulas in Lecture Fourteen. 
After learning how to write and balance chemical equations in Lecture Fifteen, the next 3 lectures 
cover what is often the core topic that frustrates students—stoichiometry. Lecture Sixteen 
demonstrates how a balanced equation serves as a chemical “recipe” and explores the important role 
of the mole in stoichiometry. Lectures Seventeen and Eighteen expand on these basic concepts as we 
solve a variety of typical stoichiometry problems. 
1

The next 3 lectures examine the concentrations of solutions. Lecture Nineteen introduces the most 
common unit of measurement for concentration—molarity—and demonstrates how to prepare a 
solution correctly. We will apply these basic concepts to solve various molarity problems in Lectures 
Twenty and Twenty-One. 
We spend the next 3 lectures discussing the fundamental concepts of equilibrium, with an emphasis 
on understanding as opposed to just memorizing. Lecture Twenty-Two addresses the basic ideas 
related to chemical equilibrium, and Lectures Twenty-Three and Twenty-Four explore these ideas 
quantitatively by using the equilibrium constant. Qualitative changes in equilibrium systems are 
treated by applying Le Chatelier’s principle, as we see in Lectures Twenty-Five and Twenty-Six.  
With this firm foundation established, Lecture Twenty-Seven tackles various types of equilibrium 
problems. We then discuss the self-ionization of water and pH in Lecture Twenty-Eight. We continue 
the discussion of pH in Lectures Twenty-Nine and Thirty as we describe the characteristics of strong 
acids and bases. In Lecture Thirty-One, we compare the characteristics of strong and weak acids and 
bases and solve related equilibrium and pH problems.  
Lectures Thirty-Two and Thirty-Three introduce a common laboratory technique used to determine 
unknown concentrations of acids and bases—the titration. In Lecture Thirty-Three, we also discuss 
the chemistry behind acid-base indicators that are used during titrations. 
We move on to qualitative and quantitative discussions of solubility in Lectures Thirty-Four and 
Thirty-Five. Lecture Thirty-Four qualitatively discusses solubility and then quantitatively defines it 
by using the solubility product constant. In Lecture Thirty-Five, we examine the common ion effect 
and discuss its impact on solubility equilibrium. 
This lecture series concludes with a capstone lecture called “Putting it All Together,” which allows us 
an opportunity to pull concepts from multiple lectures to try to solve a few rather demanding 
problems. Lecture Thirty-Six highlights the importance of understanding, instead of memorizing, the 
concepts presented in these lectures.

How to Use This Workbook 
The questions and problems presented in this workbook are designed to provide you with both an 
opportunity to practice the tasks presented in the lectures and feedback on how well you are achieving 
the goals of both the individual lectures and the entire course. 
Levels of Difficulty: For many (but not all) of the lectures, questions and problems have been divided 
into 2 categories, labeled standard and advanced. While these designations should not be taken too 
literally, in general, standard items are items it is assumed students would be expected to master in most 
high school courses with relatively strong academic expectations. Advanced items represent more 
challenging versions of classic problems and/or questions or problems that might only be addressed in 
what are often labeled honors courses. In some cases, questions and problems have been included that 
are exceptionally challenging, just for fun, and on occasion a few truly fun items have been included for 
no other reason than the fact that I enjoy a bit of humor now and then and thought you might also. 
If you have difficulty with the advanced items, in no way should this be taken as an indication that 
you have not achieved adequate mastery of the material presented in the lectures.  
Even standard items vary significantly in their level of difficulty. Only you can judge the academic 
level of achievement that is most appropriate for your particular situation and goals. 
Work all Problems: My recommendation would be to try to work problems at all levels, even if they 
might not be demanded in your particular situation. Think of it this way: If you wanted to become an 
excellent miler on the track team, you would not practice by only running a mile. You would run 
greater, more difficult distances. A similar concept may apply here. 
Worked-out solutions have been provided for all problems. Space limitations do not allow detailed 
written explanations of all the logic behind each solution, but I have tried to include comments to help 
explain the thinking that underlies each mathematical solution. 
When comparing your answer to the answer given for a mathematical problem, remember that 
answers will often vary slightly depending on how and where numbers are rounded off during the 
solving process. Do not be concerned if you obtained an answer of perhaps 7.35, for example, while 
the answer given was 7.33, 7.37, or something similar. In addition, the number of digits or decimal 
places contained in the answer is not important, within reason. No serious effort has been made to 
observe what are often called significant figure rules, so if you wrote down your answer with either 
an extra digit or decimal place or perhaps one fewer digits or decimal places, this is of no 
significance. What is important is whether you put the numbers given in the problem together in the 
proper way, not how you wrote down your final answer. 
Working these practice problems and/or similar items from your current text is vital for almost all 
students who expect to achieve proficiency at solving the kinds of problems encountered in high 
school chemistry. Solving problems is generally time well spent. 
Contact Information: I have given a lot of thought to including my e-mail address in this 
introduction. I greatly enjoy receiving and responding to e-mails from students and have been able to 
reply to every one that I have received to date. My fear, however, is that the number might very well 
become so great that replying to all of them would no longer be possible at a practical level, so please 
be understanding if you send an e-mail and do not receive a reply. I will try very hard to respond if at 
all possible. My e-mail address is chemcanbesimple@aol.com. I especially welcome your feedback as 
to what you found valuable and what you may have found less than optimal in both the lectures 
themselves and this workbook. 
I wish you success in all your studies and in life.

Lecture One 
Introduction and Philosophy 
Scope:
This lecture sets forth the general philosophy of the course—namely, that learning is much more 
effective when it occurs through understanding rather than rote memorization. Though chemistry is 
often considered a hard course, the vast majority of high school students possess more than adequate 
mental equipment to succeed admirably, and they use the same kind of quantitative reasoning ability 
naturally and easily in their daily lives that is used to solve high school chemistry problems.  
Outline
I. General introduction. 
A. Your instructor is a high school teacher with long and varied experience teaching all levels of 
high school chemistry. 
B. The focus of the lectures will be the general area of problem solving. 
II. The major goal of these lectures is to help beginning or struggling chemistry students. 
A. Usefulness was always put before sheer entertainment value when choosing topics 
for inclusion.
B. The entire focus is to increase understanding, rather than encourage memorization. 
III. Approaches to problem solving based solely on memorization are almost certainly doomed 
to failure. 
A. Problem solving must be accompanied by understanding to ensure long-term success. 
B. The type of logical reasoning abilities required to solve introductory high school chemistry 
problems is very similar to what students use easily and naturally in their everyday lives. 
IV. “Chemistry is the easiest class in school.” 
A. Most students do not agree with the above statement and believe chemistry is, by its very 
nature, a difficult subject. 
1. This belief often becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. 
2. Almost any high school student has more than adequate abilities to do well in high 
school chemistry. 
B. If you can work the simple problems involving students and rooms shown in this lecture, you 
can work virtually any chemistry problem you might be assigned.  
V. Some of these lectures should probably be watched in order, but most can be watched in any 
sequence that is most useful to an individual student. 
4

Lecture One—Questions 
Introduction and Philosophy 
1. Which statement below best describes the goals and philosophy of this course? 
A. Try and solve as many different problems as possible so you will have direct experience with 
every possible kind of problem you might encounter. 
B. Solve only a very few kinds of problems, since students typically do not find this aspect of 
high school chemistry too difficult. 
C. Learn specific formulas and approaches for as many different kinds of problems as possible, 
so you can have a specific approach custom designed for each problem that you might be 
asked to solve. 
D. Try and develop a deep understanding of fundamental concepts and modes of quantitative 
reasoning that can be applied to the vast majority of problems that you might be asked 
to solve. 
2. True or false: Although high school chemistry is not that difficult a subject, it does demand that 
you learn and apply modes of quantitative reasoning and specific mathematical techniques that 
are essentially and uniquely required to solve chemistry problems. Explain. 
3. What is a self-fulfilling prophesy? Give an example. How does it apply to why some students 
have difficulty with high school chemistry? 
4. What was the point of working the students and rooms problem? 
5. It is argued in these lectures that the kind of quantitative thinking used to solve most high school 
chemistry problems is identical to the thinking students use easily and naturally in their everyday 
lives. Yet it is also admitted that many students who can apply quantitative reasoning in their 
everyday lives still have difficulty solving chemistry problems. What 2 reasons account for this 
apparent contradiction? 
6. Must all the lectures be viewed in order? What recommendations are made regarding the order 
of viewing? 
7. What should you do if you are watching one of the later lectures in this course and encounter a 
concept or topic that you either have not studied or no longer remember? 
8. What is one of the most critical things you must do to get the maximum benefit from this course? 
9. Just for fun, what is the rule behind the following series of numbers? 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 … 
5

Lecture Two 
Basic Concepts of Quantitative Reasoning 
Scope:
This lecture establishes the basic logical framework that students will use for the remainder of the 
course. Chemistry requires simple quantitative reasoning that generally comes quite naturally to 
students. Here we break down the types of numbers involved in the study of chemistry and the 3 
approaches that can be used to solve problems involving these numbers. 
Outline
I. The students and rooms problem, although very simple, illustrates the exact type of quantitative 
reasoning that is used in solving introductory chemistry problems. 
A. Nevertheless, students often have difficulty clearly explaining how they reasoned out the 
answer, even though they have no difficulty whatsoever in doing the reasoning. 
B. Few students have ever taken the time to analyze what they are really doing when they 
perform calculations. 
C. This problem is a simple example of a “guzinta” (goes into) problem. 
II. There are only 2 different kinds of numbers in most chemistry problems: “amount” and “this 
per that.” 
III. There are 3 common approaches to solving problems that involve this type of 
quantitative relationship.
A. Some students use a formula or equation. 
B. Some use the proportion method. 
C. Some use the factor-label approach. 
D. The students and rooms problem could have been solved by using any of these approaches. 
E. Although any of these approaches can be used, it is not necessary to use any of these 
approaches to be a successful problem solver. 
IV. Chemistry problems can usually be solved by an application of simple, natural ways of 
reasoning quantitatively. 
A. There are basically only 3 ways in which numbers are normally related to one another. 
B. In the students and rooms problem, you have 3000 students and 30 rooms. What are the 3 
ways to relate these numbers? 
1.
3000
30
2.
30
3000
3. (3000)(30) 
C. Because you understand the quantities involved, you know instinctively that the first way is 
correct. This course is about developing that same kind of understanding about the numbers 
involved in chemistry. 
6

Lecture Two—Questions 
Basic Concepts of Quantitative Reasoning 
1. What are the 2 basic kinds of numbers that typically appear in chemistry problems?  
2. Classify each of the following quantities as an amount, a this per that, or neither. 
A. 5 plates/place setting 
B. 53 players/team 
C. 66.2 g 
D. 500 marbles 
E. 30 marbles/box 
F. 500 marbles/30 marbles/box 
G. 76 trombones  
3. Name 3 popular techniques that can be successfully applied to solving many chemistry problems. 
4. Why is it recommended that you not rely on using formulas to solve chemistry problems? 
5. Since proportions and the factor-label approach can also be successfully used to solve chemistry 
problems, why is it recommended that you not rely on these 2 approaches? 
6. When faced with a chemistry problem that you do not immediately know how to solve, what 3 
things should you get into the habit of doing? 
7. What is another thing you can do if you are not confident that you worked the problem correctly? 
8. What is the primary reason that some chemistry students have difficulty solving chemistry problems? 
7

Lecture Three 
Quantitative Reasoning in Everyday Life 
Scope:
This lecture further explores successful strategies for understanding and solving chemistry problems. 
The most helpful step a student can take in approaching a problem in chemistry is to understand fully 
what is being asked. Visualization can often help in achieving this. The lecture concludes with several 
practice problems designed to help the student use these strategies. 
Outline
I. There are only a handful of important ideas that must be mastered for success at solving 
chemistry problems. 
A. You must really try to understand what is meant and represented by the numbers (with 
accompanying units) stated in the problem. 
B. Whenever you divide 2 numbers, understand that you are making the denominator 1, whether 
you actually do the division on your calculator or not. 
C. When you are presented with a problem, read the problem several times—first quickly, then 
slowly; stopping, thinking, and visualizing as you go along. Draw a picture of the quantities 
represented in the problem. Always attach proper units to all numbers, and think about what 
these numbers represent. 
D. The numbers in a problem are generally of 2 types: amount and this per that. 
1. An amount is a quantity that you can visualize in your mind. 
2. A this per that tells you how many of the numerator you have for 1 of the denominator. 
II. Several practice problems can help us grasp the concepts stated above. 
III. The problems just worked incorporated virtually all of the quantitative reasoning skills required 
to solve all but a handful of the chemistry problems you will likely be asked to solve in a 
chemistry course. 
8

Lecture Three—Questions 
Quantitative Reasoning in Everyday Life 
Note: In solving numerical problems, it may turn out that your answer will differ slightly from the 
answer presented. This is of no consequence if you have solved the problem correctly. Read the 
introduction to the workbook for a more detailed discussion of this. 
Standard Problems 
1. What does a this per that always tell you? 
2. What does a quantity like 33 mi/h tell you? 
3. What does a quantity like 238 mi
4.5 h  tell you? 
4. A hybrid car can get 48 mi/gal. How many gallons of gas does it take to drive 1 mi? 
5. If you are having difficultly visualizing the fact that a quantity like 238 mi
4.5 h  is actually telling you 
how many miles you drive in 1 h (not 4.5), or that 1 gal
48 mi  is telling you how many gallons of gas it 
takes to drive 1 mi (not 48), what is a little trick you can use to help you overcome this difficulty? 
6. List some of the things you should get in the habit of doing when faced with a problem you are 
having difficulty solving. 
7. A marathon runner trains, on average, by running 8.5 mi/day. How many training miles will she 
have run during 6 months of training? Assume an average month has 30.5 days. 
8. A car traveling at 47 mi/h travels a distance of 5 mi. Given that there are 60 min in an hour and 
60 s in a minute, how many seconds did it take for the car to travel the 5 mi? 
9. You go to the store to purchase some turkey. Turkey costs $6.99/lb. How much turkey can you 
purchase if you have $11.85 to spend? 
10. You plan to drive your car a distance of 825 mi. If your car gets 29.7 mi/gal and gasoline costs 
$4.28/gal, how much will you have to spend on gas? 
Advanced Problem 
11. A teacher needs M&M’s candies for a simulated radioactive decay lab (there actually is such a 
lab—students love it for obvious reasons). There are a total of 87 students who will have to run 
the lab. Each student will require about 120 M&M’s to run the simulation. A single M&M weighs 
about 0.89 g on average. How many grams of M&M’s will be needed to run the lab? If M&M’s 
came in packages that weighed 100 g (they do not), how many packages would the teacher have 
to purchase? 
9

Lecture Four 
Quantitative Reasoning in Chemistry—Density 
Scope:
We now apply the tools that we acquired in Lectures One through Three to a basic quantitative 
measure in chemistry: density. We begin by defining density and exploring its properties as a 
relationship between mass and volume. We then solidify our understanding of density—and our skills 
at problem solving—by finding solutions to some simple density problems. 
Outline
I. Density is often the first quantitative concept studied in a high school chemistry course. 
A. Density problems can be solved by using a formula or some other technique, such as the 
proportion method or the factor-label method. However, these approaches have some 
significant disadvantages. 
B. A much better approach is to work at really understanding what is meant by the quantities 
used in defining the density of something and how they are combined to produce the 
density unit. 
II. Density involves 2 quantities and 1 relationship. 
A. The quantities are mass and volume, perhaps measured in grams and cubic centimeters. 
B. The relationship is the number of grams that are contained in 1 cm3.
C. To understand density, you must understand what we mean when we talk about mass, 
volume, and mass per volume. 
1.
The mass is the amount of matter in an object, expressed in grams. (Mass is similar to, 
but not the same as, weight.) 
2. The volume is the amount of space an object occupies. 
3. The density of an object is the amount of its matter in a given space; in other words, 
density is mass per volume. 
D. Density is an excellent example of what is meant by a ratio. 
III. We can solidify our understanding of the concept of density as well as develop a deeper 
understanding of what is involved in quantitative reasoning by working density problems.

Lecture Five 
The SI (Metric) System of Measurement 
Scope:
Lecture Five introduces a discussion of that stalwart topic in high school chemistry courses—the 
International System of Units (SI), or the metric system. After a brief discussion of its history and 
advantages, we will address the basic and derived units, along with the metric prefixes encountered 
throughout the course. 
Outline
I. The metric system of measurement has a long historical background and grew out of a need for 
standard and reproducible measurements for both science and commerce. 
A. The metric system has at least 2 distinct advantages over the English system of measurement. 
1.
Units are defined in terms of things that are easily and accurately reproduced. 
2. All conversions within the system can be performed by moving a decimal point. 
B. The metric system has undergone numerous minor and significant modifications over the 
years since its introduction. 
II. In 1960, the modern SI units were established. 
A. All base units are now well defined in terms of reproducible phenomena or objects. 
B. This revision established a philosophy that declared that only a minimum number of base 
units would be rigorously defined; all other units would be derived from these base units. 
1. There are 7 base units. 
2. All other scientific units can be derived from combinations of these 7 base units. 
3. Because some units are not of convenient size, a few additional units remain in common 
use in chemistry. 
III. There are 20 different SI prefixes. (You can find them all in the appendices.)

8. In June 1957, MAD Magazine published a humorous system of weights and measures called the 
Potrzebie system. It was created by Donald E. Knuth, a 19-year-old student who went on to 
become one of the most renowned computer scientists in the world. It was a humorous, tongue-
in-cheek, but completely rational and internally consistent system of measurement based on the 
thickness of MAD Magazine no. 26, listed as being 2.263348517438173216473 mm, or 1 
potrzebie (1 p). Volume was measured in ngogn, mass in blintz, and density in halavah; 0.000001 
p is equal to 1 farshimmelt potrzebie (1 fp); and it goes on and on. There is no assignment now 
except to research this system on the Internet if you wish. A fun Potrzebie problem will be 
included with the problems that accompany Lecture Six.

Lecture Six 
Converting between Systems of Measurement 
Scope:
Now that we have established an understanding of the SI, we will put that knowledge to use by 
converting units from one system of measurement to another. The factor-label method introduced in 
Lecture Two can be very useful in accomplishing these conversions. We will end by working through 
several practice problems to hone our conversion skills. 
Outline
I. Conversion from a unit with one prefix to a unit with another can either be done by the factor-
label method or by the big guy/little guy method. 
A. In the factor-label method, the quantity being converted is multiplied by a conversion factor 
(a fraction) with units in the appropriate place—the numerator or denominator. The starting 
units should cancel out, and only the desired units should remain. 
B. In the big guy/little guy approach, the size of the given quantity is compared to the desired 
quantity to determine how many places and in which direction the decimal point should 
be moved. 
II. The factor-label approach to solving problems is one of the most powerful methods ever designed 
to obtain the answer to a simple problem. 
A. Its power lies in the fact that it is possible to obtain the correct answer without having to 
understand anything about the quantities involved, other than their units. 
B. Its power is also its weakness, because using this approach lets you ignore the important 
conceptual understandings required to do well in chemistry. 
C. Although the approach should be used cautiously, it is an excellent method for converting 
from one unit of measurement to another. 
III. Practicing on a number of conversion problems will allow us to understand how to use  
the factor-label approach to do unit conversions and how to apply it to check our answers in 
later problems.  
A. We will begin with some fairly simple, classic types of unit conversions. 
B. We can also work conversions that involve raising units to some power.

16. In the questions that accompanied Lecture Five, problem 8 talked about a humorous system of 
weights and measures called the Potrzebie system. Recall that the fundamental unit of length in this 
system was called the potrzebie, and its standard was the thickness of MAD Magazine no. 26, which 
was said to be 2.263348517438173216473 mm, or 1 p. Volume was measured in a unit called a 
ngogn, which was equal to 1000 p3. Mass was measured in blintz, and 1 blintz was equal to the 
mass of 1 ngogn of halavah. Halavah is a form of pie; it has a specific gravity of 3.1416, which 
means it is 3.1416 times as dense as liquid water. Liquid water has a density of 1 g/cm3. What is the 
mass of 1 blintz of halavah, in grams? You may round off the potrzebie to 2.26335 mm.

Lecture Seven 
Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table 
Scope:
In this lecture we will explore the development of the periodic table of elements. Although there are 
several ways that a periodic table can be built, the example that we find in chemistry textbooks is the 
most common form. To understand the development and organization of the periodic table, we must 
also understand some basic properties of the elements themselves. The lecture ends with a discussion 
of the fundamental structure of all elements. 
Outline
I. There are several different ways of preparing the periodic table of elements. The most common 
form is found in most textbooks. 
II. The periodic table displays all the known elements arranged in a pattern. 
III. Elements can be defined operationally and conceptually. 
A. The operational definition of an element is “a substance that cannot be broken down into 
simpler substances by ordinary physical or chemical techniques.” 
B. The conceptual definition of an element is “a substance made of only 1 kind of atom.” 
IV. By 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had published what is generally regarded as the first true 
periodic table. 
A. Mendeleev’s table had approximately 60 elements, compared to over 100 in the modern table. 
B. The elements were arranged according to their relative weights, from lightest to heaviest. 
C. Mendeleev and other scientists noticed that the properties of elements repeated themselves at 
regular intervals. Mendeleev then arranged the elements into families of elements with 
similar properties. 
D. Based on the properties of the elements, Mendeleev predicted the location of and some 
properties for several of the missing elements. These elements were later discovered and 
closely matched Mendeleev’s predictions. 
V. Each element on the periodic table is represented by a 1- or 2-letter symbol. 
A. When using 2-letter symbols, the first letter is capitalized and the second letter is lowercased. 
B. Many symbols correlate with the English name for the element. Some symbols do not 
because the name was derived from another language, usually Latin. 
VI. Each element has a unique atomic number that represents the number of protons in the nucleus, as 
well as the number of electrons, in an atom of that element. 
A. A proton is a fundamental type of particle found in the nucleus of all elements, and it carries a 
charge of +1. 
B. Electrons are found outside the nucleus, and they carry a charge of 1.
C. Atoms are electrically neutral, so the number of protons and electrons must be equal.

6. What does the atomic number of an atom tell us about the atom? 
7. What is the charge of a proton? 
8. What is the charge of an electron? 
Advanced Problems 
9. Can you find at least 1 weakness in both the operational and conceptual definitions of an element 
presented as the answers to question 3? 
10. We say that there are only 2 different kinds of charges, which we have arbitrarily labeled as being 
+1 and 1. We could have just as easily called them Sammy and Joey, if we wished. We labeled 
them +1 and 1 because these were the only 2 different kinds of charges we found, and in 
addition, if we combine 1 of each of these 2 different kinds of charges, the result is no charge at 
all. If we assume that opposite charges attract and like charges repel, what kind of experimental 
result would force us to conclude that there were, in fact, 3 different kinds of charges in nature 
instead of only 2?

Lecture Eight 
Ions, Compounds, and Interpreting Formulas 
Scope:
In this lecture we extend our discussion of the elements to include ions, chemical formulas, protons, 
electrons, and atomic weights. We will discover how electrically charged particles can cause atoms to 
combine and create ionic solids and molecules. We will end by exploring the units and formulas 
necessary to describe these structures. 
Outline
I. An atom or group of atoms can lose or gain electrons to form charged particles called ions. 
A. Atoms that gain electrons become negatively charged and are called anions. 
B. Atoms that lose electrons become positively charged and are called cations. 
C. The charge of an ion is written to the upper right of the chemical symbol, like S2 or Al3+.
D. Polyatomic ions are ions that contain more than 1 atom, like OH or 
2
4
SO .

II. Cations and anions attract one another and combine to form ionic solids. 
A. The proper number of positive and negative ions must combine to form an electrically neutral 
ionic solid. 
B. The required number of each ion is represented by a subscript in the chemical formula, 
like CaCl2.
C. Some chemical formulas contain parentheses to indicate the required number of ions,  
like Ca(OH)2.
III. Molecules are made by combining 2 or more atoms and are represented by formulas. 
A. There are 7 elements that actually exist as diatomic molecules in their natural state. These are 
represented by formulas, not just symbols: H2, O2, N2, Cl2, Br2, I2, and F2. The word 
“HONClBrIF” is a mnemonic device made from the symbols of the 7 elements. 
B. Some elements exist in nature as molecules with more than 2 atoms, including P4 and S8.
C. When we think of molecules, we most commonly think of compounds such as H2O or CO2.
D. The names of simple molecules contain prefixes to indicate the number of each in the 
compound. These prefixes are not used to name ionic solids. 
IV. Ionic solids consist of an enormous number of ions, not individual molecules, and are represented 
by formula units. 
V. The atomic weight indicates how heavy the average atom of one element is compared to atoms of 
other elements. 
A. In addition to the protons in the nucleus, most atoms also have neutrons. Neutrons are 
electrically neutral (i.e., have a charge of 0). 
B. Protons and neutrons have similar masses, but electrons are much smaller. 
C. The masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons are extremely small, so the kilogram is not a 
convenient measurement. 
D. The atomic mass unit (amu) is used to express the mass of individual particles or atoms. One 
atomic mass unit equals 1
12  the mass of the carbon-12 atom.

Lecture Nine 
Isotopes and Families of Elements 
Scope:
In this lecture we conclude our preliminary overview of the basic ideas of chemistry with a discussion 
of isotopes, neutrons, and mass numbers. We will also establish a more thorough grasp of the 
structure and organization of the periodic table of elements. 
Outline
I. Isotopes are atoms of a given element that differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. 
II. The mass number of an atom represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, 
or the mass of the isotope rounded off to the nearest whole number. 
A. The actual mass of an atom is less than the calculated mass. This occurs because protons and 
neutrons release energy and lose mass when they combine to form a nucleus. 
B. Mass numbers are written as superscripts to the left of an element’s symbol, like 35Cl. 
III. The number of protons, neutrons, and electrons in an isotope can be determined from the atomic 
number, the mass number, and the charge of an atom. 
IV. The atomic weight of an element is an average weight of all isotopes of that element. Atomic 
weights take into consideration the weights of the different isotopes and the relative abundance of 
each isotope in nature. 
V. The periodic table is broadly divided into different regions. 
A. The vertical columns are called groups, or families. 
B. The horizontal rows are called rows, or periods. 
C. The zigzag staircase line near the right-hand side of the table divides the elements into metals 
on the left and nonmetals on the right. 
D. Metals share some properties, as do nonmetals. Metals and nonmetals tend to have 
different properties. 
E. Metalloids are found along the zigzag staircase and have properties of both metals  
and nonmetals. 
F. There are 4 main sections to the periodic table: the transition elements, the inner transition 
elements, and 2 groups of elements called the representative or main group elements. 
G. Within these, some smaller sets of elements are classified into families. 
VI. Molecular and formula weights can be calculated from individual atomic weights.

Lecture Ten 
The Mole 
Scope:
This lecture addresses the key topic permeating most high school chemistry problems: the mole. We 
explore the invention of the mole as a conceptual means of counting atoms and molecules while 
avoiding the physical impracticalities. We explore the mole’s relationship to Avogadro’s number and 
conclude with its quantitative definition. 
Outline
I. One of the most important concepts to master in an introductory chemistry course is the mole.  
II. Chemists invented the concept of the mole because they needed a way to count atoms  
and molecules. 
A. We need to be able to count out atoms and molecules to run chemical reactions without 
having anything left over. 
B. The important thing is not to literally count the actual number of atoms or molecules but to be 
able to obtain samples of substances that contain the same number of atoms or molecules as 
samples of other substances. 
C. Since atoms and molecules are far too small and far too numerous to actually count, we must 
be able to achieve this counting by some indirect method. 
D. Since the atomic weights of the elements tell us how heavy one atom is compared to another 
atom, we can weigh out equal numbers of atoms (or molecules) by simply using the ratio

mass of the substance. 
C. Since we know how to calculate molecular weights, we do the same calculation but call the 
number obtained the molar mass, and we express it in grams per mole instead of amus 
per molecule. 
D. The number of particles in a mole is equal to 6.02 × 1023, called Avogadro’s number. 
E. Moles of different substances have different weights because some molecules are heavier 
than others.

Lecture Twelve 
Avogadro’s Hypothesis and Molar Volume 
Scope:
This lecture introduces the concept of molar volume, the amount of space occupied by a mole.  
For solids and liquids, the molar volume is different for each substance. However, for gases we will 
learn to use a key principle known as Avogadro’s hypothesis, which states that equal volumes of 
different gases contain the same number of molecules, assuming the same conditions of temperature 
and pressure.
Outline
I. In this lecture we consider the amount of space, or volume, occupied by a mole of any 
gaseous substance. 
A. The volume occupied by a mole of a substance is referred to as its molar volume. 
B. The molar volume of a solid or liquid is different for every different substance. 
C. Avogadro’s hypothesis states that at the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal 
volumes of different gases contain the same number of molecules. 
1. This is true because under normal conditions, gases are 99.9% empty space, so the size of 
the molecules themselves has very little effect on the volume occupied by a mole 
of molecules. 
2. Actually, equal volumes of different gases do not contain exactly the same number of 
molecules, but it is so close that Avogadro’s hypothesis can be accepted as a very 
reasonable approximation. 
3. If equal volumes contain the same number of molecules, it follows that equal numbers of 
molecules occupy equal volumes. 
D. A mole of any gas at what chemists call standard temperature and pressure (STP) occupies a 
volume of 22.414 L. 
1. This holds only for gaseous substances. 
2. This is only true at STP. 
II. In solving molar volume problems, the following ideas should be kept in mind. 
A. The important quantities are moles, grams, molecules, and liters. 
B. The most common this per thats are grams per mole, molecules per mole, and liters per mole. 
III. Solving several practice problems will allow us to deepen our understanding of several important 
fundamental quantities and relationships and will also allow us to improve our general ability to 
reason quantitatively.

Lecture Thirteen 
Percent Composition and Empirical Formulas 
Scope:
In this lecture, we encounter 2 classic types of chemistry problems: those involving percent 
composition and those involving empirical formulas. In the first type, we learn how to present the 
amounts of individual elements in a compound as percentages of total mass. In the second type, we 
determine the simplest formula to describe the ratios between atoms of each element in a compound. 
We will solve several percent composition problems in this lecture, saving our practice of empirical 
formula problems for later. 
Outline
I. One of the classic types of problems that students learn how to solve in an introductory chemistry 
course is determining what is referred to as the percent composition of a compound. 
A. The term “percent composition” is always understood to mean percent composition by mass, 
even though it may not be specifically stated as such. 
B. Calculating the percent composition of a compound involves determining what percentage of 
the total mass of the compound comprises each of the elements present in the compound. 
C. There are a number of different ways in which percent composition problems can  
be presented. 
1. Sometimes the masses of the elements that react with each other to form a sample  
of the compound are given, and the percent composition is determined from  
this information. 
2. Sometimes the formula of the compound is given, and the percent composition can be 
determined from the formula. 
3. Several examples of each type of problem are presented and solved. 
II. Another classic type of problem is determining what is referred to as the empirical formula of 
a compound. 
A. The term “empirical formula” is sometimes called the simplest formula. 
B. The empirical formula is defined as the formula of the compound written with the lowest 
possible whole-number ratio of the atoms of the elements in the compound. 
C. Sometimes the molecular formula and the empirical formula of a compound are different. 
D. Sometimes the molecular formula and the empirical formula of a compound are the same. 
E. The general concept of empirical formulas and how they are related to molecular formulas 
is presented. 
F. There are 2 reasons why chemists even bother to talk about the empirical formulas of 
substances rather than their actual formulas. 
1. For ionic solids, no actual molecular formula exists, since the substance comprises an 
enormous aggregate of ions.  
2. The only type of formula that can be discussed for the substance is an  
empirical formula.

8. One day, you find a wonderful money-making opportunity on the internet. Someone is willing  
to sell you a mineral called axinite for $9.00/kg. He furnishes you with directions on how  
to extract aluminum from this mineral and also directs you to another company that is willing  
to pay you $50.00/kg for the aluminum you can provide. Assuming the procedure actually  
works as advertised, is this a good opportunity to get rich? You can assume that the formula  
for axinite is HCa3Al2BSi4O16. Oh, and you must act now, because only a limited amount of 
axinite is available.

Lecture Fourteen 
Solving Empirical Formula Problems 
Scope:
We will now learn to solve the empirical formula problems that were discussed in the previous 
lecture. In solving these problems, it is often useful to assume a sample mass of 100 g and to express 
the formula in the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms. Determining the empirical formula allows 
us then to determine the molecular formula. 
Outline
I. When determining the empirical formula of a substance from its percent composition, it is 
convenient to assume a sample of the substance with a mass of 100 g. 
A. Since the size of the sample of the substance does not affect its formula, any sample size 
could be chosen. 
B. Assuming a sample size of 100 g simplifies the mathematics involved. 
II. When you calculate an empirical formula, the formula you come up with sometimes appears to 
contain fractions of atoms. 
A. These fractions are often halves or thirds. 
B. When this happens, it is necessary to multiply each of the subscripts in the formula by an 
appropriate integer to rid the formula of fractions and to obtain the simplest whole-number 
ratio of the atoms of the elements in the compound. 
III. Molecular formulas can be determined from empirical formulas. 
A. Analyzing percent composition data only allows us to determine the simplest ratio of the 
atoms of the elements in the compound, not the actual molecular formula. This is the second 
reason why chemists bother to discuss empirical formulas.  
B. Once the empirical formula has been determined, the molecular formula can be determined 
by using the molar mass of the substance. 
1. The molar mass is obtained by performing an additional experiment that is capable of 
providing this information.  
2. The molar mass will be some integer multiple of the empirical mass, and the molecular 
formula will be equal to the empirical formula multiplied by this integer multiple. 
IV. Several practice problems are done to illustrate how empirical and molecular formulas  
are determined.

Lecture Fifteen 
Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations 
Scope: 
This lecture answers some fundamental questions involving chemical reactions and the equations that 
represent them. We will learn to identify when a chemical reaction has occurred and then to describe 
that reaction in a chemical equation. Once we know how to write a chemical equation, we can then 
balance it to conserve the atoms in the equation.  
Outline
I. In this lecture some very fundamental questions are considered. 
A. What is a chemical reaction? 
B. When we mix substances, how can we tell if a chemical reaction has occurred? 
C. How do we write equations for chemical reactions? 
D. How do we balance chemical equations, and what are we really doing when we do this? 
II. What is a chemical reaction? 
A. It is a process where 1 or more substances are transformed into 1 or more  
different substances. 
B. What are some indications that a chemical reaction has occurred? 
1. The formation of a precipitate. 
2. The production of a gas. 
3. A color change. 
4. A temperature change that occurs even though we did not heat or cool the  
system ourselves. 
III. A chemical reaction involves the rearrangement of the atoms present in the reactants to produce 
the arrangement that is present in the products. 
IV. How do we write and balance chemical equations? 
A. It is very inefficient and awkward to attempt to represent chemical reactions with words. 
B. A chemical equation, in contrast, is a very efficient method for communicating what has 
occurred in a chemical reaction. 
C. To correctly write a chemical equation, you must know the correct formulas for all the 
reactants and products. 
D. The reactants are written to the left of the arrow, and the products are written to the right of 
the arrow. 
E. The states of the reactants and products can also be indicated in the equation. 
V. How are chemical equations balanced, and what does “balancing” really mean? 
A. When we balance a chemical equation, we are simply making sure that atoms are conserved 
in our equation, which is necessary because they are conserved in the actual reaction. 
B. To balance the equation, we simply search for a set of coefficients that results in both sides of 
the equation containing the same number of atoms of each element. 
C. Never begin by balancing atoms that appear in more than 1 substance on 1 side of  
the equation. 
37

D. If the equation contains a free element—a reactant that contains only 1 kind of atom, like 
O2—balance that element last. 
E. If the equation contains polyatomic ions that remain the same on both sides of the equation, 
these ions can be balanced as entire units.

Lecture Sixteen 
An Introduction to Stoichiometry 
Scope:
We now turn to a core topic that often frustrates students of chemistry: stoichiometry, or the study of 
the quantitative relationships between substances in a chemical reaction. To solve stoichiometry 
problems, we must first look more closely at what is represented by the coefficients in a balanced 
chemical equation. We will examine and learn to solve the 4 basic types of stoichiometry problems. 
Outline
I. Stoichiometry is the study of the quantitative relationships that exist between substances involved 
in a chemical reaction. 
A. The key to solving all stoichiometry problems is the balanced chemical equation for  
the reaction. 
B. The most important thing to understand to solve stoichiometry problems correctly is exactly 
what is represented by the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. 
1. The coefficients in the balanced chemical equation can represent the ratio of molecules of 
the substances that are consumed or produced. 
2. The coefficients in the balanced chemical equation can represent the ratio of moles of the 
substances that are consumed or produced. 
II. There are 4 basic types of stoichiometry problems: moles-moles, moles-grams, grams-moles, and 
grams-grams. However, all stoichiometry problems are really very similar, and the same general 
approach can be used to solve any of them. 
III. Several practice problems are solved to illustrate the general approach to solving the 4 basic types 
of stoichiometry problems. 
IV. The lecture ends with additional problems being presented and then solved.

Advanced Problem 
5. The same internet outfit that offered you the opportunity to make money by selling you axinite 
from which you could extract and sell aluminum (see Lecture Thirteen’s questions) has come up 
with another offer. They are willing to sell you an alloy of gold (Au) and copper (Cu) for an 
introductory price of only $25.00/g. You make money by removing the copper from the alloy 
using the following reaction, which we saw in the lecture: 
 
3Cu + 8HNO3  3Cu(NO3)2 + 2NO + 4H2O
 
After you remove the copper, you sell the gold that remains. It sounds like a good opportunity to 
get rich quick rather than stay in school and get a degree, but because of your past experience 
with this company, you decide to just order 1 oz to test the validity of the offer. You run the 
reaction shown and find that it takes 34.39 g HNO3 to completely react with the copper in the 1 
oz of alloy that you purchased. If gold is selling for $1,000.00/oz and there are about 28.35 g/oz, 
is this a good business opportunity?

Lecture Seventeen 
Stoichiometry Problems 
Scope:
In this lecture we will continue our discussion of stoichiometry problems. We will extend our study 
beyond the 4 basic types by adding units of volume, molecules, and energy. Although this may 
increase the complexity of the problem, the basic approach remains the same. We will also learn a 
few special ideas that are relevant to specific situations. 
Outline
I. Even though the 4 types of stoichiometry problems appear to be different, they can all be worked 
by using the same basic approach.  
II. In this lecture we are going to extend our study of stoichiometry to several additional types  
of problems. 
A. Even though this will increase the number of possible types of problems greatly, it really does 
not complicate things very much. 
B. All of these different problems can be solved by using the same basic type of approach. 
1. Take the substance that is given in the problem, look at the units in which it is 
represented, and convert this quantity into the number of moles of the substance. 
2. From the number of moles of the given substance, solve the moles-moles problem to find 
the number of moles of the substance requested. 
3. Take a look at what units were desired for the requested substance, then convert the 
moles of this substance into these units. 
C. The units that we will be adding to our mix of problems are volume of a gas at STP, 
molecules, and energy. 
1. The addition of these units increases the number of possible types of problems. 
2. Because the addition of these new units increases the number of possible types of 
problems so greatly, it is clear that no memorization approach could be successful in 
learning how to solve these problems. 
3. The units given should be turned into moles first. You can then work the moles-moles 
problem and convert your answer into whatever unit was requested. 
III. The remainder of the lecture is devoted to solving several problems that illustrate the general 
approach that is used, as well as a few special ideas that can be applied to specific situations.

Lecture Eighteen 
Advanced Stoichiometry 
Scope:
Now that we have a fundamental knowledge of stoichiometry, we can move on to more advanced 
problems involving limiting reagents. Although these problems are more complicated, they can be 
solved by using a very simple approach. We will also encounter 3 terms often applied to chemical 
reactions: theoretical yields, actual yields, and percent yields. 
Outline
I. In many chemical reactions, 1 of the reactants is completely consumed, while 1 or more of the 
other reactants is only partially consumed, so that some remains when the reaction is over. 
A. The substance that is completely consumed is often referred to as the limiting reagent, or 
limiting reactant. 
B. An analogy can be drawn between recipes used in cooking and the “recipe” for a chemical 
reaction. The coefficients in the balanced chemical equation essentially provide a recipe for 
the reaction, telling us the proper ratio in which the reactants react, so that there are no 
reactants remaining when the reaction is finished. 
II. Limiting reagent problems can be solved by using a very simple approach. 
A. You must first determine which reactant is the limiting reagent. 
1. This can be done by comparing the actual amounts of each reactant to the amount 
represented in the balanced chemical equation. 
2. The reactant that allows us to run the reaction the fewest number of times is the limiting 
reagent.
3. Once the limiting reagent is determined, it is used to calculate the amount of the products 
that can be produced. 
B. In this lecture several limiting reagent problems are presented and solved. 
III. Three terms often used in chemistry are the theoretical, the actual, and the percent yield in  
a reaction. 
A. The theoretical yield is the amount of a substance we are capable of producing from a given 
amount of reactant. 
B. The actual yield is the actual amount of the substance that is produced when the reaction 
is run. 
C. The percent yield is the actual yield divided by the theoretical yield and multiplied by 100.

offer is a sure thing, they show calculations that demonstrate that just reacting the 100.0 g Sc2O3
will produce over 219 g ScCl3. Since ScCl3 sells for $15.00/g, you are guaranteed to return of at 
least $3,285 on your initial $3,000 investment. 
A. Is their calculation that over 219 g ScCl3 is produced if 100.0 g Sc2O3 is consumed correct?

Lecture Nineteen 
An Introduction to Molarity 
Scope:
This lecture examines the components of chemical solutions and introduces the important concepts of 
concentration and molarity. We will learn to distinguish between solutes and solvents in a solution 
and then to determine the concentration of a solute. Finally, we will discuss the units and 
relationships involved in molarity. 
Outline
I. One important concept to master in any introductory chemistry course is the concept of 
concentration of a solution in general, as well as the specific unit of concentration referred to as 
the molarity of a solution. 
A. Two terms that must be distinguished from each other are solute and solvent. 
1. “Solute” refers to the substance that gets dissolved. 
2. “Solvent” refers to the substance that does the dissolving. 
3. When 2 liquids are mixed with each other, which term applies to which substance  
is ambiguous. 
4. For aqueous solutions, water is generally regarded as being the solvent. 
5. When a solid or gas is dissolved in a liquid, the solid or gas is generally considered to be 
the solute and the liquid the solvent. 
B. There are several different units of concentration used in chemistry. 
1. These different units have been developed for specific situations where they prove 
most useful. 
2. All units of concentration involve a ratio of either the amount of solute to solvent or the 
amount of solute to solution. 
C. It is important to distinguish between the amount of a solute and its concentration. 
1. “Amount” refers to the gross quantity of solute present. 
2. “Concentration” refers to the ratio of the amount of solute to solvent or solute  
to solution. 
II. The most commonly used unit of concentration in chemistry is the unit of molarity. 
A. The symbol for molarity is M. 
B. The molarity of a solution is defined as the number of moles of solute divided by the total 
number of liters of solution in which this amount of solute is dissolved. 
C. A 1 M solution contains a mole of solute for every liter of solution. 
1. It is important to remember that molarity involves the total volume of the entire solution, 
not just the volume of solvent. 
2. The 1 M does not imply that we actually have a single mole of solute and a single liter of 
solution but rather is the ratio between these quantities. 
3. To prepare 1 L of a 1 M solution, you would dissolve 1 mol solute in just enough water to 
produce a total of 1 L solution.

C. You could have only 1
2  L solution and it could still be 1.00 M HCl.

of 40.0 g/mol.

2.00-L volumetric flask filled with water. The other is prepared by adding 1 drop of vegetable dye 
to 250 mL of water. Which solution will be darker in color?

Lecture Twenty 
Solving Molarity Problems 
Scope:
In this lecture we extend our understanding of molarity by solving some typical molarity  
problems that students might encounter in a high school chemistry class. Again, our approach to these 
problems will be based on deep understanding of the concepts involved, not meaningless 
memorization of formulas. You will be asked to draw on your natural logic in solving several practice 
molarity problems. 
Outline
I. In this lecture we are going to learn how to solve some typical high school–level  
molarity problems. 
A. Keep in mind as we approach these problems that our goal is not to find some formula or 
method by which we can obtain the correct answers to the problems without having to 
understand the concept of molarity. 
B. What we want to do as we work through these problems is to think deeply about the concept 
of molarity, try to visualize the problems as they are presented, and then use our natural 
ability to reason quantitatively and obtain the correct answers. 
C. It is probably not a good idea to try to solve molarity problems by just using the formula 
for molarity. 
D. A general approach to molarity problems might be something like the following. 
1. Take time to think about what is really being represented by the quantities given in the 
problem. If necessary, draw a picture or diagram of the problem. 
2. After really thinking about what the quantities represent, put the numbers together in a 
logical manner. 
3. Check your answer by using the molarity formula or factor-label method if necessary. 
II. Several practice problems are presented and solved.

This lecture presents some challenging new problems that will require you to draw on many of  
the skills learned in previous lectures. Some of these problems may be difficult at first, but 
successfully solving them can be considered proof that you have mastered the concepts and 
procedures presented so far.
Outline
I. In this lecture we take what we learned about molarity and apply this knowledge to a few 
additional types of problems. 
A. This is a very challenging task because no sample problems of this type have been modeled

specific concepts previously covered and the general approach to thinking about problems 
offered throughout this series of lectures. 
C. If you encounter difficulty in solving the problems, that is to be expected. 
D. Some of these problems have specific names, such as dilution problems. 
1. In some cases, special formulas are presented for solving the specific problems.

Lecture Twenty-Two 
Basic Concepts of Chemical Equilibrium 
Scope:
We continue our study of chemical reactions by examining an important new component: the 
equilibrium system. We begin by looking carefully at the difference between reactions that go to 
completion and those that are reversible and reach a state of apparent stasis. This will bring us to our 
examination of equilibrium systems and how to achieve them in a chemical reaction. We conclude by 
learning how to graphically present a system that is approaching equilibrium. 
Outline
I. Some chemical reactions are said to go to completion, while other chemical reactions are said to 
be reversible. 
A. When we say that a reaction goes to completion, we mean that the reactants continue to react 
with each other until one of them is completely consumed and we have formed as much 
product as possible. 
B. When we say that a reaction is reversible, we mean that the reaction does not continue until 
all of at least one of the reactants is consumed. 
1. In principle, all chemical reactions are reversible, although for practical purposes many 
can be considered to go to completion. 
2. With reversible reactions, the system achieves a state where, although the reactants have 
not completely converted to products, the reaction appears to have ceased. 
3. Actually, the reactions have not ceased at all. In fact, the forward and reverse reactions 
are still occurring but at equal and opposite rates, producing a situation where the 
concentrations of the substances present in the system do not change with time. 
II. There are several important ideas to keep in mind when thinking about equilibrium systems. 
A. When setting up an equilibrium system, it is not necessary to mix the substances involved  
in the equilibrium in the mole ratio obtained from the balanced chemical equation for  
the reaction. 
B. The amounts of substances present when equilibrium is achieved (and even the ratio of the 
amounts of substances present) need not bear any relationship whatsoever to the coefficients 
of these substances in the balanced chemical equation for the reaction. 
C. The coefficients in the balanced chemical equation only tell you the mole ratio in which the 
substances react with each other. 
D. Equilibrium is achieved when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions become equal. 
1. This means that the reactants are being converted into products at the same rate that the 
products are being reconverted into reactants. 
2. The fact that the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal in no way implies 
that there will be equal amounts of reactants and products present at equilibrium. 
3. Although the actual rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal at equilibrium, 
one reaction will have the faster intrinsic rate. 
III. We can graphically represent a system approaching equilibrium by plotting the concentrations of 
all the substances present in the equilibrium versus time. 
A. We will consider such a graph for the general reaction 2A + B  C + 3D. 
B. Several important ideas about equilibrium systems can be illustrated by such a graph.

2. What are the characteristics of what we are calling a reversible reaction? 
3. Select all of the true statements from among the following for a chemical system that has

A. There are no longer any visibly observable changes occurring in the system. 
B. The rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal.

D. The number of grams of reactants and products will be equal. 
E. The mole ratios of the reactants and products can be different from their ratios in the balanced

4. Select all of the true statements from among the following. 
A. When a reaction begins with only reactants, the concentration of the products will continue to 
increase until the system has achieved a state of equilibrium. 
B. When a reaction begins with only reactants, the concentration of the reactants will continue to 
decrease until the system has achieved a state of equilibrium. 
C. In the reaction 2A + 3B  C + 4D, as the system approaches equilibrium, the concentration 
of A will change at twice the rate at which the concentration of C increases. 
D. In the reaction 2A + 3B  C + 4D, if we start with only A and B, the concentration of D at 
equilibrium will be 4 times the concentration of C. 
E. In the reaction 2A + 3B  C + 4D, if we start with only A and B, the concentration of B at 
equilibrium will be 3
2  the concentration of A. 
F. In the reaction 2A + 3B  C + 4D, if we start with 10.0 mol A and only 1.0 mol B, the 
concentration of B will still fall at 1.5 times the rate at which the concentration of A falls. 
5. What is the one thing that the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation for a reversible 
chemical reaction tell you? 
6. Consider this hypothetical reaction: 
 
3A + B  4C + 2D 
 
First, 7.00 mol A and 2.00 mol B are placed in 1.00 -L container and allowed to reach 
equilibrium. At equilibrium, the number of moles of D are measured, and it is found that 1.50 mol 
D were formed at equilibrium. Calculate the number of moles of A, B, and C that would be 
present at equilibrium. 
56

Lecture Twenty-Three 
An Introduction to the Equilibrium Constant 
Scope:
In this lecture we will hone our understanding of chemical equilibrium by tracking and graphing a 
hypothetical reaction as it approaches a state of equilibrium. We will then examine a concept that is 
key to understanding equilibrium: the equilibrium constant. While the equilibrium constant is difficult 
to grasp intuitively, establishing a familiarity with it will allow us to consider it more 
comprehensively later.  
Outline
I. In this lecture we take a close look at the hypothetical reaction 2A + B  C + 3D. 
A. Beginning with several different initial concentrations of reactants and products, we watch 
the system as it approaches and finally attains equilibrium. 
B. These processes can be nicely represented on graphs of the concentrations of all reactants and 
products versus time. 
1. We find that after a period of time, all concentrations become constant, indicating that the 
systems have achieved equilibrium states. 
2. Looking at the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and products after equilibrium 
is attained, it would appear that each state is completely independent of the other states 
and that they have absolutely nothing in common. 
II. The single most important thing to understand about equilibrium is the form and nature of the 
equilibrium constant. 
A. For every equilibrium system at a given temperature, there exists a specific equilibrium constant. 
1. This constant is usually symbolized by K, Keq, or Kc. (We will use simply K.)
2. The mathematical form of the equilibrium constant for a reaction, while difficult to state 
in words, is easy to represent symbolically. 
3. This constant will always have the same numerical value at a given temperature, no 
matter what the individual concentrations of the various reactants and products. 
B. While the existence of such a constant is not easy to understand intuitively, it is fairly easy to 
demonstrate theoretically why such a constant should exist, although such a demonstration is 
beyond what we will be covering in this series of lectures. 
C. Heterogeneous reactions involve reactants or products that are pure solids or liquids. 
1. When writing the equilibrium constant expressions for these reactions, the pure solids 
and pure liquids are omitted from the expressions. 
2. Several examples are done to illustrate the correct method of writing expressions for 
heterogeneous reactions.

Lecture Twenty-Four 
Interpreting an Equilibrium Constant 
Scope:
In this lecture we become more familiar with the quantitative aspects of the equilibrium constant. We 
find that for any reaction at a given temperature, the equilibrium constant is always satisfied, no 
matter the individual concentrations in the solution. By working some sample equilibrium problems, 
we can interpret what the equilibrium constant means for each system. 
Outline
I. For every reaction at a given temperature, there exists an equilibrium constant that is always 
satisfied when the system is at equilibrium, no matter what the individual concentrations of the 
reactants and products. 
A. The nature and numerical value of the equilibrium constant is probably the single most 
important thing to understand about any equilibrium reaction. 
B. The range of possible numerical values for equilibrium constants ranges from almost zero to 
almost infinity. 
1. If the value for the equilibrium constant is large (greater than 1), chemists say that “the 
products are favored,” or “equilibrium lies to the right.” 
2. If the value for the equilibrium constant is small (less than 1), chemists say that “the 
reactants are favored,” or “equilibrium lies to the left.” 
3. If the value for the equilibrium constant is large, you tend to have more products than 
reactants at equilibrium, while if the value for the equilibrium constant is small, you tend 
to have more reactants than products at equilibrium. 
C. When presented with an equilibrium problem, you can always begin by writing down the 
expression for the equilibrium constant for the system and setting it equal to the numerical 
value for the equilibrium constant. 
D. Equilibrium constants are usually measured under standard state conditions, namely 25°C and 
1 atm of pressure. 
II. This lecture concludes by looking at some actual equilibrium systems and their equilibrium 
constants and interpreting what these constants tell us about each system.

Lecture Twenty-Five 
Le Chatelier’s Principle—Concentration 
Scope:
This lecture introduces us to a very useful tool in chemistry known as Le Chatelier’s principle. While 
Le Chatelier’s principle does not help us describe the quantitative aspects of an equilibrium system, it 
does allow us to make qualitative judgments about the system—for instance, whether the equilibrium 
constant will change under altered conditions, and if so, in what direction. While the principle can be 
stated in many ways, it basically asserts that a system will attempt to shift in such a way as to 
counteract whatever stress is applied to it. 
Outline
I. Equilibrium systems are very changeable. 
A. The only way to quantitatively determine the result of altered conditions is to actually work a 
numerical equilibrium problem. 
B. If you only want a qualitative idea about what happens to an equilibrium system when 
conditions are changed, you can often achieve this by using Le Chatelier’s principle. 
II. Le Chatelier’s principle is an extremely useful qualitative tool in chemistry. 
A. It is really more of a game than a rigorous scientific principle. 
B. Le Chatelier’s principle cannot provide quantitative answers in most cases. 
C. Le Chatelier’s principle can do the following. 
1. It can tell us the direction in which a system at equilibrium will shift. 
2. It can tell us whether the amounts and concentrations of the reactants and products in the 
new equilibrium will be larger or smaller than the amounts and concentrations of these 
substances in the original equilibrium. 
3. It can tell us whether the equilibrium constant for the reaction will change, and if it does, 
whether it will increase or decrease. 
D. Le Chatelier’s principle can be stated in various ways. 
1. We will state the principle as follows: If a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the 
system will shift, if possible, in the direction that completely or at least partially alleviates 
the stress. 
2. There are several important points to keep in mind when applying this principle. 
a. The system should be at equilibrium before the stress is applied. 
b. The term “stress” means a change in the concentration of one of the reactants or 
products, a change in pressure, or a change in temperature. 
c. “Shifting” means converting some reactants to products or products to reactants. 
d. There are some situations where the system cannot do anything about the stress. 
e. In some cases the system can completely alleviate the stress, but more often it can 
only partially alleviate the stress. 
3. A simple way to state Le Chatelier’s principle is to say that whatever you do to a system 
at equilibrium, the system will try to do the opposite. 
III. We will begin our application of Le Chatelier’s principle by considering changes in the 
concentration of one of the reactants or products.

Lecture Twenty-Six 
Le Chatelier—Pressure and Temperature 
Scope:
Having established a basic understanding of Le Chatelier’s principle, we will now explore the various 
ways in which this principle can manifest itself when an equilibrium system is changed. Specifically, 
we will examine circumstances in which the pressure or temperature of a system is changed. By 
applying Le Chatelier’s principle, we will be able to qualitatively predict the system’s reaction to 
these changes. 
Outline
I. In this lecture we are going to see how Le Chatelier’s principle can be used to predict the effect of 
a change in pressure or temperature on an equilibrium system. 
A. When we refer to a change in pressure, we always mean a change in pressure brought about 
by a change in the volume of the system. 
1. There are other ways of changing the pressure of a system, such as adding or removing a 
gaseous reactant or product or changing the temperature. 
a. Neither of these changes are treated as pressure changes. 
b. Adding or removing a gaseous reactant or product is treated as a change  
in concentration. 
c. Changing the pressure by changing the temperature is simply treated as a change 
in temperature. 
2. Pressure changes are only relevant to equilibrium systems that contain at least 1 gaseous 
reactant or product. 
B. If we increase the pressure on the system, the system will try to decrease the pressure, and 
vice versa. 
1. The only way it is able to alter the pressure is to either shift to the right or to the left. 
2. A system can decrease its own pressure by shifting in the direction where there are fewer 
gaseous molecules, and vice versa. 
C. When dealing with changes in an equilibrium system brought about changes in pressure, we 
must be careful to only specify what happens to the amounts of reactants and products, not 
their concentrations. 
1. The change in the amounts of reactants and products can be unambiguously predicted by 
Le Chatelier’s principle. 
2. What happens to the concentrations of the reactants and products is sometimes 
ambiguous because the concentrations of all reactants and products were immediately 
changed when the initial volume of the system was altered. 
D. Changing the pressure cannot change the value of K.
E. When counting molecules to determine which way a system will shift in response to a change 
in pressure, only gaseous molecules should be counted. 
F. If a system contains the same number of gaseous molecules on both sides of the equation, it 
cannot react to a change in pressure. 
G. To predict how an equilibrium system will respond to a change in temperature, we must 
know whether the reaction is exothermic or endothermic. 
1. If temperature is raised, the system will try to lower the temperature by shifting in the 
endothermic direction. 
64

2. If temperature is lowered, the system will try to raise the temperature by shifting in the 
exothermic direction. 
3. Changing temperature will change the value of K.

C. We can tell how the amounts of reactants and products in an equilibrium system after it reacts 
to a stress will compare to the amounts present in the system before the stress was applied. 
D. For concentration stresses, we can tell qualitatively (without actual numerical values) how the 
concentration of the reactants and products in the system after it has reacted to a stress will 
compare to their concentrations before the stress was applied. 
E. For temperature stresses, we can tell qualitatively how the concentration of the reactants and 
products in the system after it has reacted to a stress will compare to their concentrations 
before the stress was applied.

and products in the system after it has reacted to a stress will compare to their concentrations 
before the stress was applied.

Lecture Twenty-Seven 
An Introduction to Equilibrium Problems 
Scope:
Now that we understand some fundamental qualities of equilibrium systems, we can try our hands  
at solving equilibrium problems. While it may take practice to become comfortable with these 
problems, the only knowledge essential to solving them is how to write and interpret equilibrium 
constants. With this knowledge in hand, we will learn how to approach several different types of 
equilibrium problems. 
Outline
I. Once a good understanding of the basic nature of equilibria is achieved, it is possible to tackle the 
solving of equilibrium problems. 
A. In principle, the only essential thing that must be understood to work any equilibrium 
problem is how to write and interpret the meaning of an equilibrium constant. 
B. While the solving of equilibrium problems does not require learning very much more about 
equilibria in general, it usually takes a lot of exposure and practice to become fluent at  
the task. 
II. Equilibrium problems can be conveniently separated into different types. 
A. One of the easiest types gives you the equilibrium concentrations of the reactants and 
products in some system and then asks you to calculate the numerical value of the 
equilibrium constant for the reaction. 
B. Another type gives you the numerical value for the equilibrium constant for a reaction, the 
equilibrium concentrations of all reactants and products except 1, and then asks you to find 
the equilibrium concentration of this substance. 
C. When solving equilibrium problems one must be very careful to distinguish initial 
concentrations from equilibrium concentrations. 
D. Although they can be divided into different types, all equilibrium problems involve applying 
the very same principles and are not really different in any important way. 
III. Several equilibrium problems are presented and solved.

The Self-Ionization of Water 
Scope:
In this lecture, we will explore one of the most important equilibria that exist in nature: the self-
ionization of water. After examining the categories of substances that are liquid or that can be 
dissolved in water, we will learn the basic quantitative characteristics of the self-ionization of water 
and solve some problems using this information. The lecture will end with a brief introduction to the 
pH of solutions. 
Outline
I. One of the most important equilibria that exist in nature is the equilibrium that exists in water, 
called the self-ionization of water. 
A. Substances that dissolve in water are often divided into 3 broad categories. 
1. These categories are nonelectrolytes, strong electrolytes, and weak electrolytes. 
a. Nonelectrolytes do not conduct electricity. 
b. Strong electrolytes conduct electricity very well. 
c. Weak electrolytes conduct electricity to a small extent. 
2. The key to whether a substance conducts electricity and how well it does so is whether or 
not it forms ions in solution. 
a. Nonelectrolytes are made of molecules and remain molecules when dissolved  
in water. 
b. Strong electrolytes exist in water only as ions. 
c. Weak electrolytes dissolve in water to form mostly molecules, but a small percentage 
of the molecules break apart to form ions. 
3. Water is classified as a weak electrolyte. 
B. The self-ionization of water can be represented by the equation H2O(l)  H+(aq) + OH(aq).

Lecture Twenty-Nine 
Strong Acids and Bases—General Properties 
Scope:
We will now broaden our understanding of pH by examining strong acids and bases. The term 
“strong” does not describe the concentration of a solution but rather how highly the substance is 
ionized in solution. We will apply what we have learned by finding some pH-related values in 
solutions of strong acids. 
Outline
I. In this lecture we continue our study of the meaning and usefulness of the concept of pH. 
A. The pH of a solution can be found if the [H+] in the solution is known, since pH = log[H+].
B. It is also possible to find the [H+] in a solution if the pH is known, since [H+] = 10pH.
C. Another quantity that can be specified for a solution is its pOH. 
1. The pOH of a solution is equal to log[OH].
2. The sum of the pH and the pOH of a solution equals 14. 
II. A strong acid or base is defined as an acid or base that is 100% ionized in solution. 
A. The term “strength” is not related to the concentration of the solution. 
1. Strength refers only to how highly ionized the substance is, not how concentrated the 
solution is or how dangerous the solution might be. 
2. It is quite common to confuse the terms “strength” and “concentration.” 
B. There are 6 common strong acids in nature: HCl, HBr, HI, HNO3, HClO4, and H2SO4.
1. These acids are 100% ionized in solution. 
2. Sulfuric acid ionizes one H+ at a time and is a strong acid only for the first ionization. 
III. An introductory problem is worked involving finding the concentrations of H+ and OH, the pH, 
and the pOH in solutions of strong acids.

Lecture Thirty-One 
Weak Acids and Bases 
Scope:
We now look at weak acids and bases, those that are only slightly ionized in water-based solutions. 
While many bases are strong, most acids are weak. In this lecture we will learn how to solve the 
classic weak acid problem—determining the concentrations, pH, pOH, and ionization level in a 
solution of weak acid. Once we are able to solve weak acid problems, we can use the same approach 
for weak base problems. 
Outline
I. Weak acids are acids that are only slightly ionized in aqueous solution. 
A. They can be contrasted with the 6 common strong acids, which are essentially 100% ionized 
in aqueous solution. 
B. Most acids are weak acids. 
C. Weak acids still differ from each other in their relative strengths. 
1. The best way to compare the relative strengths of weak acids is to compare the numerical 
value for their ionization constants, Ka.
a. For a general weak acid HX, Ka = [H+][X]/[HX]. 
b. The smaller the numerical value of Ka, the weaker the acid. 
2. Chemists have prepared and published tables that compare the relative strengths of acids 
according to the numerical values for their ionization constants. 
D. The classic weak acid problem involves determining the concentrations of all molecular and 
ionic species, the pH, the pOH, and the percent ionization in a solution of a weak acid of 
known concentration. 
II. Several weak acid problems are presented and solved. 
III. Weak base problems can be solved in the same manner as weak acid problems. 
A. The only common weak base generally encountered in a first-year high school chemistry 
course is ammonia, NH3.
1. Ammonia ionizes according to the equation NH3 + H2O 
4
NH+ + OH.
2. The ionization constant (Kb) for ammonia is 1.8 × 105.
B. When solving problems involving solutions of ammonia, you should remember that the x that 
is solved for represents the concentration of hydroxide ion, not hydrogen ion.

Lecture Thirty-Two 
Titrating Acids and Bases 
Scope:
Acids and bases neutralize each other, and these neutralization reactions can be used in laboratory 
procedures called titrations. In this lecture we learn how to perform titrations and how to use them to 
determine unknown concentrations of acids and bases. 
Outline
I. Acids and bases neutralize each other. Hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions tend to combine to 
form water. 
II. Reactions between strong acids and strong bases have extremely large equilibrium expressions. 
These reactions essentially go to completion to form water. 
III. Neutralization reactions are used in laboratory procedures called titrations. A titration allows us to 
determine the unknown concentration of an acid or base.  
A. Titrations have 2 key requirements. 
1. The amounts of acid and base mixed together must be carefully controlled and measured. 
2. There must be some way of determining when enough acid or base has been added to 
neutralize the solution. 
B. The equivalence point is the point at which enough acid or base has been added to neutralize 
the solution.
C. A pH meter or acid-base indicator can be used to determine when the equivalence point has 
been reached.
D. Titrations are performed by using burettes, which allow you to carefully control and measure 
the amounts of acid and base mixed together.
E. Solutions of unknown concentrations are mixed with standard solutions of known 
concentrations. The number of moles used from the standard solution can be related to the 
number of moles of the unknown. Molarity can then be calculated from this information.
IV. The rest of the lecture is devoted to describing the titration procedure and solving  
sample problems.

Lecture Thirty-Two—Questions 
Titrating Acids and Bases 
Standard Problems 
1. What allows us to say, for all practical purposes, that the reaction of a strong acid with a strong 
base essentially goes to completion? 
2. What is the technical difference between the equivalence point of a titration and the  
end point? 
3. Why can the end point in a titration be assumed to be an adequate approximation of the actual 
equivalence point? 
4. What are we using as our preliminary definition of an indicator? Name 2 indicators commonly 
used in high school labs and state their colors in acidic and basic solutions. 
5. Explain why each of these procedures is performed during an acid-base titration lab. Assume you 
are going to determine the concentration of an unknown acid by titrating it with a solution of a 
standardized base. 
A. After cleaning the burettes, some of the solutions they are going to be filled with are added to 
the burettes and rolled around inside them, and then this solution is discarded. 
B. After filling your burettes, you drain a bit of the acid or base into a waste container and 
discard it. 
C. After adding your acid solution to the reaction vessel, you add an unmeasured amount of 
distilled water to the reaction vessel. 
D. You constantly swirl the solution in the reaction vessel as you perform the titration. 
E. If you accidentally add too much base, and the solution turns more red than pink, suggesting 
that you have gone past the end point, additional acid is then added drop by drop until a  
good end point is achieved. If you accidentally go past the end point when trying to  
add more acid, then additional base is added drop by drop until a good end point  
is achieved. 
6. A titration is performed by adding a standardized solution of NaOH to a solution of an unknown 
solution of HCl. The following data is obtained.

equation for the reaction before you do the calculations. 
8. A very popular formula for solving acid-base titration problems is MaVa = MbVb, where Ma is the

corresponding terms for the base.

B. Under what circumstances would the formula not work? 
C. Why do you think this formula was not presented in this lecture? 
82

Lecture Thirty-Three 
Titration Curves and Indicators 
Scope:
In this lecture we discover how acid-base indicators can be used to find the equivalence point of a 
titration. An acid-base indicator will undergo a change in color at a particular pH value, a value that is 
different for different indicators. When a solution is titrated, it will typically undergo a dramatic 
change in pH near the equivalence point of the titration. By selecting an indicator that changes color 
at a pH value near the equivalence point of a particular acid-base titration, we can visually observe 
when we have reached the equivalence point for the titration we are performing. 
Outline
I. Acid-base indicators are used to determine the equivalence point of a titration. 
A. The pH of the solution being titrated changes dramatically around the equivalence point. 
B. By choosing an appropriate indicator, a color change can be observed when the equivalence 
point is reached. 
II. An acid-base indicator is a weak acid or base whose molecular form is one color while its ionic 
form is another.
A. Since they are weak acids or bases, indicators ionize slightly in solution. Their strength, as is 
true of all weak acids or bases, is indicated by the numerical value of their 
ionization constant. 
B. A weak acid indicator will change color when the pH of the solution into which it is placed 
equals pKa for the indicator (pKa = logKa).
C. Indicators come in a variety of colors and operate in different pH ranges. The indicator 
chosen for a particular titration will depend on the pH range of the solution at the  
equivalence point. 
III. Titrations can result in acidic, basic, or neutral solutions at the equivalence point. 
A. Strong acids titrated with strong bases result in neutral solutions at the equivalence point. 
B. Weak acids titrated with strong bases result in basic solutions at the equivalence point. 
C. Strong acids titrated with weak bases result in acidic solutions at the equivalence point. 
IV. Titration curves for weak acids and strong bases differ from strong acid/strong base  
titration curves. 
A. The initial pH is higher in weak acid/strong base titrations. 
B. The pH does not jump as dramatically around the equivalence point for weak acid/strong 
base titrations. 
C. The pH at the equivalence point is above 7 for weak acid/strong base titrations. 
83

Lecture Thirty-Three—Questions 
Titration Curves and Indicators 
Standard Problems 
1. Consider the titration curve for titrating a strong acid, like HCl, with a strong base, like NaOH. 
Select all the true statements from among the following. 
A. At the beginning of the titration, the pH of the solution is 7. 
B. At the beginning of the titration, the pH of the solution will be below 7. 
C. At first the pH of the solution rises rapidly as base is added. 
D. The pH of the solution rises at a constant rate as base is added. 
E. At the equivalence point of the titration, the pH of the solution is 7. 
F. The pH of the solution changes very rapidly around the equivalence point of the titration. 
G. When you get well past the equivalence point, the pH of the solution rises rapidly. 
H. After you pass the equivalence point, the pH of the solution will be greater than 7. 
I. Any indicator that changes color from perhaps a pH of 4 to a pH of 10 would be appropriate 
to use in this titration. 
2. What is a good definition of an indicator? 
3. Do indicators have some special property that causes them to change color so rapidly around  
the equivalence point of a titration? If so, what is this property? If not, why do they change color 
so rapidly? 
4. Consider weak acid indicators. Why do different indicators change color over different  
pH ranges? 
5. Suppose a weak acid indicator had a Ka = 8.3 × 106. Around what pH would you expect it to 
change color? 
6. What was the comical “ME STRONG ACID; me weak base” joke designed to help  
you remember? 
7. From the following lists, select the indicator that would be most appropriate for each of the 
titrations listed. 
 
Titrations: 
A. 1.00 M HNO3 titrated with 1.00 M NaOH 
B. 1.00 M HC2H3O2 with 1.00 M KOH. 
C. 1.00 M NH3 with 1.00 M HCl. 
 
Indicators: 
a. methyl red: changes color from pH 4.4–6.2 
b. litmus: changes color from pH 5–8 
c. alizarin yellow: changes color from 10.0–12.0 
84

8. Two students are assigned to do 2 different titrations and prepare titration curves. Student A is 
told to titrate 50.0 mL of 1.00 M HCl, a strong acid, with 1.00 M NaOH, a strong base. Student B 
is told to titrate 50.0 mL of 1.00 M HClO, a weak acid, with 1.00 M NaOH. Student A correctly 
calculates that he needs 50.0 mL of 1.00 M NaOH to complete his titration. When the 2 students 
go to the stock room, they find that there is only a total of 70.0 mL of the 1.00 M NaOH available 
for both of them. Student B suggests that they both should just titrate 25.00 mL of their acids with 
the NaOH, arguing that both of them will then require only 25.0 mL of the NaOH, so there will 
be enough for both of them to complete their projects. Student A argues that he should get 50.0 
mL of the NaOH, since that is how much he needs, and anyway, the remaining 20.0 mL should be 
more than enough for Student B, since he is titrating a weak acid and since weak acids only 
contain a small concentration of H+, so he will not really need much of the NaOH to complete his 
project. Which is the better plan? Explain why. 
9. Suppose you were to titrate a 1.00 M solution of a weak acid like acetic acid (HC2H3O2) with a 
strong base like KOH. Select all of the true statements from among the following. 
A. The pH of the initial acid solution would be the same as it would be if your starting solution 
was 1.00 M HCl, since both are 1.00 M solutions. 
B. The pH would still rise slowly at the beginning of the titration. 
C. The pH at the equivalence point would be below 7. 
D. The pH at the equivalence point would be greater than 7. 
E. The pH at the equivalence point rises just as much and just as rapidly as it did when we 
titrated HCl with NaOH. 
F. The pH at the equivalence point rises rapidly, but not quite as much as it did when we titrated 
HCl with NaOH.

(KHC8H4O4, often abbreviated as KHP in laboratory manuals), dissolves it in some distilled 
water, and titrates it with the solution of NaOH that is to be standardized. He determines that it

Lecture Thirty-Four 
Solubility Equilibria—Principles, Problems 
Scope:
This lecture introduces us to solubility equilibria, the equilibria found in saturated solutions of 
slightly soluble ionic solids. We will discuss the difference between dissociation equilibria and 
solubility equilibria, and we will clarify some possible points of confusion in solving solubility 
equilibria problems. 
Outline
I. The term “solubility equilibria” refers to the kind of equilibria that exist in saturated solutions of 
slightly soluble ionic solids. 
A. A classic example would be the equilibrium that exists in a saturated solution of silver 
chloride (AgCl). 
1. This equilibrium can be represented by the equation AgCl(s)  Ag+ + Cl.
2. The equilibrium constant for a system is given the symbol Ksp and is referred to as a 
solubility product. 
a. For this system, Ksp = [Ag+][Cl].
b. There is no denominator in the expression for the solubility product because the 
denominator is a pure solid, and pure solids and liquids are never included in 
equilibrium constant expressions. 
B. One important difference between dissociation equilibria and solubility equilibria is that in a 
dissociation equilibrium the value of the equilibrium constant must always be satisfied, 
whereas in a solubility equilibrium the solubility product is only satisfied if the solution 
is saturated. 
C. In these types of equilibria, it is important to not confuse the molar solubility of the substance 
with the value of its solubility product. 
1. The term “solubility” refers to how much of a substance can be dissolved in a liter of 
solution, i.e., the molarity of a saturated solution. 
2. The term “solubility product” refers to the numerical value of the equilibrium constant 
for the equation that represents the substance dissolving in water. 
3. For example, the solubility of AgCl in water is about 1.3 × 105 M, whereas the value of 
the solubility product is 1.8 × 1010.
4. Two classic types of problems are to determine the molar solubility of an ionic solid 
given the value of this solubility product, and vice versa. 
II. In this lecture several problems relating to the solubility and the solubility product of various 
ionic solids are presented and solved.

compound B?

Lecture Thirty-Five 
Solubility Equilibria—Common Ion Effect 
Scope:
Our study of solubility equilibria continues with some more advanced practice problems. In this 
lecture, we encounter the last major type of equilibrium problem that we will see in this course: those 
that involve the effect of already-present solutes on the solubility of an added ionic solid. In solving 
this problem, we will revisit Le Chatelier’s principle and will learn some pitfalls to beware of when 
calculating the equations. 
Outline
I. We start this lecture by tackling a fairly involved solubility problem that probably exceeds what 
is demanded in most high school courses but will provide a good vehicle to sharpen our reasoning 
skills even further.
II. Next we encounter the last general type of equilibrium problem in this course. These problems 
involve situations where a slightly soluble ionic solid is establishing an equilibrium with a 
solution that happens to contain a second source of one of the ions present in that equilibrium. 
A. This problem shows that the solubility of a substance can be markedly affected by the 
presence of other solutes in the solution. 
B. This is in fact predicted by Le Chatelier’s principle, which we learned several lectures ago. 
III. In our last practice problem, we have to combine the processes developed in this lecture with 
concepts and processes learned earlier in the course.

have acquired throughout the course. To avoid the dull nature of review problems, I have included in 
each of these final exercises an element that is completely new but entirely workable within the 
logical framework that we have built. These problems are meant to be challenging—their primary 
goal is to build confidence in your ability to encounter and unravel new problems. With that 
confidence and with the deep understanding of chemistry that this course has emphasized, any student 
should feel well equipped to tackle even higher levels of learning in chemistry.

solve challenging problems that you have not encountered before.

Lecture One 
Introduction and Philosophy 
1. D 
2. False. Solving most high school chemistry problems only involves applying quantitative 
reasoning that you use easily and naturally in your everyday life. 
3. A self-fulfilling prophesy is a prophesy that comes true solely because people believe it will come 
true. The example given in the lecture is a bank that fails for no other reason than the fact that 
people believe it is going to fail: This belief causes them to withdraw their money—what is called 
a run on a bank. The bank fails even though it is a very sound bank. The belief that it was going 
to fail caused it to fail. Similarly, some chemistry students who believe that they will not do well 
in chemistry become so negative in their attitudes and nervous at the first sign of difficulty that 
their very belief that they will not do well results in their not doing well. 
4. The quantitative thinking that is applied when solving a problem like the students and rooms 
problem is identical to the kind of quantitative thinking required to solve most high school 
chemistry problems. Solving this problem correctly demonstrates that you have the requisite 
ability to solve high school chemistry problems. 
5. The numbers encountered in chemistry problems are not always nice, whole numbers. They  
often involve decimals and exponential numbers, which some students find more difficult to 
reason with. Also, students may not have a deep understanding of what the numbers given in a 
problem really represent; without this understanding, they do not know how to reason through  
the problem. 
6. It is not necessary to view all the lectures in order. It is recommended that the first 4 lectures be 
viewed in order and mastered before continuing. After that, students can view whichever lecture 
or lectures might relate to whatever they are studying in class at that particular time. 
7. Go back and view the lecture or lectures that apply to the topic that you either have not been 
exposed to or have forgotten. 
8. Try to solve every problem before watching the solution on the video. Be an active learner, not a 
passive observer. 
9. Starting with 0, then 1, each successive number in the sequence is obtained by adding the 
previous 2 numbers. This is a very famous sequence called the Fibonacci numbers.

Lecture Two 
Basic Concepts of Quantitative Reasoning 
1. Amounts and this per thats 
2.
A. This per that 
B. This per that 
C. Amount 
D. Amount 
E. This per that 
F. Neither. Although this is a fraction, the denominator is not a single quantity. The denominator 
itself is a this per that. 
G. Amount 
3. The 3 techniques are (1) use of a formula or equation, (2) the proportion method, and (3) the 
factor-label method. 
4. Plugging numbers into a formula allows you to solve a problem without really understanding the 
underlying concepts. As the number of different formulas increases, it becomes more and more 
difficult to both remember them and know where and when they can be applied. 
5. Because these 2 approaches can be applied without a real understanding of the nature of the 
actual quantities that appear in a problem or the concepts that underlie the problem. When 
problems become more complex, this lack of fundamental understanding can cause serious 
difficulties that are not easily remedied. 
6. First, try to understand what the numbers given in the problem are really representing. Second, try 
to visualize what is being described in the problem. Third, try to put the quantities together in the 
natural way they would have to go together to make any sense. 
7. You can check your answer by using a formula, proportions, or the factor-label approach, but 
these should be used to check your work, not as the primary approaches to obtaining the solution 
to the problem. 
8. They do not really understand what the numbers given in the problem truly represent.

Lecture Three 
Quantitative Reasoning in Everyday Life 
1. It tells you how many you have of whatever is in the numerator for 1 of what is in  
the denominator. 
2. It tells you how many miles you can drive in 1 h. 
3. Although this fraction certainly tells you that you can drive 238 mi in 4.5 h, what it is really 
telling you (i.e., the way you should think about this) is how many miles you can drive in 1 h. If 
you actually do the division, it says that you can drive 238 mi
4.5 h , or 52.9 mi/h. 
4. The number of gallons of gas it takes to drive 1 mi is a this per that. The “this” is the number of 
gallons of gas you use; the “that” is the number of miles you drive. This car uses 1 gal gas to go 
48 mi, so the gallons per mile would be 1 gal
48 mi , or 0.021 gal/mi. It takes much less than 1 gal to 
drive just 1 mi, which makes sense. 
5. Cover up the numbers. Just look at the units. Without the numbers this is easier to see. Miles per 
hour tells you how many miles you can drive in 1 h. Gallons per mile tells you how many gallons 
of gas it takes to drive 1 mi. 
6. Read the problem several times, both rapidly and slowly; stop to think; and visualize. Then draw 
a picture of the things being described in the problem. Attach proper units to all numbers given in 
the problem, and think about what these numbers represent. 
7. (6 mo)(30.5 days/mo) = 183 days 
 
(183 days)(8.5 mi/day) = 1555 mi  
8.
5 mi
47 mi/h  = 0.1064 h 
 
Note: A common error here would be to divide 47 by 5, but it is very unlikely that you would do 
this if you stopped and visualized a distance of 5 mi and a car that was traveling at 47 mi/h. 
Stopping to think about this would make it clear that it would take much less than 1 h to travel the 
5 mi. 
 
(0.1064 h)(60 min/h)(60 s/min) = 383 s

11. (87 students)(120 M&M’s/student) = 10,440 M&M’s  
 
(10,440 M&M’s)(0.89 g/M&M) = 9291.6 g M&M’s

Lecture Four 
Quantitative Reasoning in Chemistry—Density 
1. Mass refers to how much matter the object contains. 
2. Volume refers to how much space is taken up by the object. 
3. Density refers to how much mass is contained in a given volume of a substance. 
4. F; both B and C are correct. 
5. The density is 5.00 g/cm3. Density does not depend on how much of the material you have; 
2.00 cm3 would have a mass of 10.00 g, but the density would still be 5.00 g/cm3:

10.00 g
2.00 cm  = 5.00 g/cm3.
6. Dime, nickel, small fork, orange, liter bottle of soda

9.
3
9.00 g
13.59 g/cm  = 0.662 cm3. Did you reason that the volume had to be less than 1 cm3 before you did 
the math? 
10. This problem illustrates how to determine the volume of an irregularly shaped object by using the 
technique of water displacement: volume of object = (final water level)  (initial water level). 
 
volume = 44.8  35.2 = 9.6 cm3
 
density = 
3
28.73 g
9.6 cm  = 2.99 g/cm3
11. The Nerf ball. Even though it has less mass, its low density (Nerf balls are made of a low-density, 
spongelike material) means that the Nerf ball will still have to be much larger than the piece of 
candy, since there are very few grams in a given volume of Nerf ball material. 
12. The density would still be 60.0 g/cm3. Density refers to the amount of mass that is contained in a 
given volume of something (like 1 cm3). The mass of an object is the same on the Moon as it is 
on Earth. The weight of the object, on the other hand, would only be 1
6  of what it is on Earth. The 
density of an object does not depend on its weight, only on its mass.

number of blood cells that you have.

that is assumed will remain the same for all time and cannot be lost, stolen, or destroyed. (2) It 
must be defined in terms of something that can be measured with great accuracy. The definition 
of the meter has undergone several revisions to accomplish these goals.

Lecture Seven 
Elements, Atoms, and the Periodic Table 
1. An operational definition is a definition expressed in terms of operations or tests that can be 
performed to see if something fits into that category or set of things that you are trying to define. 
If it passes the test, it is included. 
 
An operational definition of a circle might simply be that it is a smooth line with no breaks  
or corners that bends around and rejoins itself, like a snake biting its own tail, and it looks  
the same no matter how you rotate it or from which direction you look at it. (Note: This is 
certainly not the best definition, but it is these kinds of properties that allow little children to 
identify circles long before they understand what they actually are or can verbally explain how 
they know which shapes are circles and which are not. I hope trying to come up with this 
definition has shown you how difficult it can often be to define something clearly and 
unambiguously. There are almost always things that do not quite fit, whatever definition we 
might come up with.) 
2. A conceptual definition is a definition expressed in terms that allow us to understand why 
something belongs to that set of things established by the definition. The conceptual definition of 
a circle might be that it is a curved line around a center point, where every point on the line is 
equidistant from the center point. 
3. Operational: An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by 
ordinary physical or chemical techniques. 
 
Conceptual: A substance that contains only one kind of atom. 
4. He predicted the existence of several undiscovered elements that later were discovered. 
5. H, He, Li, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, Ar, K, Ca, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Ag, Sn, I, 
Xe, Ba, Au, Hg, Pb, Bi, Rn, and U. 
6. The atomic number tells us how many protons are in the nucleus of that atom and/or the number 
of electrons in the atom. 
7. The charge +1, where the 1 simply represents 1 elementary charge. 
8. The charge is 1, where the 1 simply represents 1 elementary charge. 
9. In the operational definition, we need to further understand what is meant by “ordinary physical 
and chemical techniques.” In the conceptual definition, does “one kind of atom” mean that an 
element cannot contain different isotopes of the same atom? (It does not—all isotopes are 
considered to be the same kind of atom when defining an element, but that is not apparent from 
the definition as given.) 
10. If we could charge 3 different spheres and then found that any combination of 2 would  
attract each other, then we would have to conclude that there were 3 different kinds of  
charges instead of only 2. In reality, it is impossible to charge 3 spheres without at least  
1 combination repelling each other, which indicates that there are only 2 different kinds  
of charges.

9. CO is carbon monoxide, and it consists of individual, separated CO molecules, each consisting of 
1 atom of carbon and 1 atom of oxygen. NaCl consists of an enormous aggregate of sodium and 
chloride ions. There are no individual NaCl molecules. You cannot say that any particular Na+ ion 
is attached to any particular Cl ion. Consequently, we say that NaCl simply represents the 
formula for sodium chloride, and thus NaCl is a formula unit (i.e., 1 unit of this formula). 
10. The atomic weight tells us how heavy an atom of that element is compared to the atoms of any 
other element. 
11. All we have to do to answer this is compare the ratio of their atomic weights: Al/Fe = 27.0
55.8  = 0.48. 
Thus an aluminum atom is a bit less than half as heavy as an iron atom, or you can say that an 
atom of iron is a little over twice as heavy as an aluminum atom. 
12. Ba/Ag = 137.3
107.9  = 1.27. Thus a barium atom is 1.27 times as heavy as a silver atom. Be sure to take 
the ratio of their atomic weights, not their atomic numbers.

2. The atomic number refers to the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. The mass number 
refers to the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of a particular atom. The atomic 
weight refers to the average weight of all the isotopes of a particular element. 
3. C. Since 45X is by far the most abundant isotope, the average atomic weight should come out to 
be just a bit below 45. 
4. Metals and nonmetals. Metals are much more abundant. They are usually separated from each 
other by a staircase-like line near the upper-right side of the periodic table. 
5.
A. False. The properties of different metals vary, so we can hardly know the element’s 
properties with any great degree of specificity. What we can do is make statements about 
what its general properties probably are, although we might be wrong in any particular case. 
B. False. We cannot even be certain of its general properties, although this is a much more 
reasonable statement, so if you answered true, I would not judge that to be an indefensible answer. 
C. True. We can state what its general properties probably are. Although any particular metal 
may not fit our generalizations, the odds are with us. 
D. False. If we know an element is a metal, we can state with some confidence that it probably 
forms positive ions, its clean surface is probably shiny, it probably is a good conductor of 
heat and electricity, and it probably is malleable and ductile (although any specific metal may 
lack 1 or more of these properties). 
6. A. The properties listed are properties of nonmetals. Iron and sodium are metals. Helium is a 
noble gas. 
7.
A. No. Metals typically form positive ions. 
B. Yes. Nonmetals typically form negative ions. 
C. No. The charge on its ions does not indicate anything about how reactive it is. 
D. No. Although oxygen does form 2 ions, so do other elements, such as sulfur and selenium.

m = 3.88 × 1012 kg = 3.88 × 109 g, or 0.00000000388 g, which is hardly measurable 
14. This is a question that is sometimes asked by outstanding thinking students and even pops up 
occasionally on chemistry Listservs. How could you possibly average the numbers 16, 17, and 18 
and get an average that was below 16? The answer lies in the fact that 16O, for example, does not 
have an actual mass of 16. That is its mass number. The actual mass is a bit less than 16, because 
of the effect discussed in the previous question. This fact, coupled with the fact that naturally 
occurring oxygen is about 99.762% 16O, with only small amounts of 17O and 18O, allows the 
average atomic weight to actually be a bit less than 16. 
15. Average atomic weight = (0.05 × 42) + (0.08 × 43) + (0.87 × 45) = 44.69

5. They caught the same number of fish. The father caught 9.24 kg big fish
0.770 kg/fish  = 12 fish. The son caught 
2.90 kg little fish
0.242 kg/fish  = 12 fish. The ratio of the weights of all the fish they caught ( 9.24 kg
2.90 kg  = 3.19) is about 
the same as the ratio of the weights of the individual fish ( 0.770 kg
0.242 kg  = 3.18), which means that they 
had to catch the same number of fish. 
6. It illustrates the fact that if the ratio of the weights of a large number of things (like fish) is the 
same as the ratio of the weights of each individual thing (like 1 fish), then you have the same 
number of these things. Atomic and molecular weights tell us the ratio of the weights of 
individual atoms and molecules, in amus. Molar masses use these same numbers and just change 
the units from amus to grams—the ratio of the molar masses is the same as the ratio of the 
molecular and atomic weights. Therefore, if we weigh out a mole (1 molar mass) of anything, it 
will contain the same number of things as a mole of anything else.

9. B. While all of the others are meaningful quantities, it would be relatively rare to have to 
determine any of them when solving a problem. Grams per mole represents the number of grams 
it takes to have a mole of a substance—its molar mass. This is a quantity that is very often needed 
in order to solve a problem. 
10. 63.5 + 32.1 + 4(16.0) + 5(18.0) = 249.6 g/mol (Note: I’ve treated the entire H2O as a unit and 
used its entire molar mass of 18.0 g/mol in this calculation.) 
11. There are a total of 7 atoms of Fe—4, plus an additional 3 that are inside the square brackets. There 
are 18 atoms of carbon—1 inside the parentheses, but taken 6 times; then these 6 are taken 3 times, 
for a total of 18 carbon atoms. Finally, there are 18 atoms of nitrogen, by the same reasoning.

are so many of them in even a small sample of material that even with their infinitesimal size, 
they would stretch a great distance.

Lecture Twelve 
Avogadro’s Hypothesis and Molar Volume 
1. Molar volume refers to the volume occupied by a mole of a substance. 
2. G, I, J, and K are all units that are expressed in terms of a volume per mole of material. 
3. The molar volume of a substance is the volume occupied by 1 mol, or 6.02 × 1023 molecules of 
the substance. We would expect the amount of space taken up by this number of molecules to 
depend on how big the molecules are. Larger molecules should take up more space. 
4. The generalization in question 3 is not true for equal volumes of gases measured at the same 
temperature and pressure. Equal volumes of different gases measured at the same temperature and 
pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. The reason this is possible is that gaseous 
substances at normal conditions of temperature and pressure are about 99.9% empty space. The 
molecules themselves only take up a very tiny fraction of the volume that the gas occupies. Since 
the amount of space taken up by the molecules themselves is so insignificant, it makes little 
difference how large or small these molecules are. 
5. At the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of different gases contain the 
same number of molecules. It is not exactly true, since the size of the molecules does make a 
small difference, but the difference is so insignificant that this hypothesis can be assumed to be 
true for most gases at reasonable temperatures and pressures. 
6.
A. True. A large bottle of soda is about 2 L. 
B. True 
C. True 
D. True. A basketball has a volume of a bit more than 6 L. 
7. Two conditions must be met before this number can be used: (1) We must be talking about a 
gaseous substance; 22.414 L/mol does not apply to solids or liquids, and (2) the gas must be at 
STP. If it is at a different temperature and/or pressure, then 22.414 L/mol does not apply.

13. Since this problem asks for grams, we will need the molar mass of SF6.
 
SF6 = 32.1 + 6(19) = 146.1 g/mol

15. (6.22 mol)(44.0 g/mol) = 274 g 
 
Note: This was a simple but trick problem. Since nothing was asked or given about the volume of 
the carbon dioxide gas, there was no reason to grab the 22.414 number. But students often do this 
reflexively when they read the phrase “gas at STP.” Think before you calculate!

44.0 g/mol  = 0.2255 mol CO2
 
(0.2255 mol)(6.02 × 1023 molecules/mol) = 1.36 × 1023 molecules 
 
Again, there’s no reason to bring 22.414 L/mol into this problem, since nothing is given or asked 
about volume. 
17. NaCl = 23.0 + 35.5 = 58.5 g/mol 
 
Molar volume is the volume of 1 mol. For sodium chloride, this would be the volume occupied 
by 58.5 g. 
3
58.5 g
2.16 g/cm  = 27.1 cm3
 
This is much smaller, because the answer is in cubic centimeters, not liters. We would expect this 
because solids occupy much smaller volumes than gases for the same number of particles. 
18. A cubic meter is 100 cm on a side, so the volume of this cube in cubic centimeters would be  
(100 cm)3, or 106 cm3. There are 1000 cm3 in a liter (a cm3 is the same as a mL—do not let the 
“centi” part of the name throw you off). Therefore, 1 m3 = (106 cm3)(

38.346 g × 100 = 44.87% 
 
%S = 7.062 g
38.346 g × 100 = 18.42% 
 
%O = 14.080 g
38.346 g × 100 = 36.72% 
2. 5.68 g total compound  1.55 g C = 4.13 g O 
 
%C = 1.55 g
5.68 g × 100 = 27.3% 
 
%O = 4.13 g
5.68 g × 100 = 72.7% 
3. Assume you have 1 mol (NH4)2CO3. It would contain the following: 
 
2(14.0) = 28.0 g N 
 
8(1.0) = 8.0 g H 
 
1(12.0) = 12.0 g C 
 
3(16.0) = 48.0 g O 
 
We then calculate the total molar mass of the compound. 
 
28.0 g + 8.0 g + 12.0 g+ 48.0 g = 96.0 g/mol 
 
From there, we can determine the percent composition. 
 
%N = 28.0 g
96.0 g × 100 = 29.2%  
 
%H = 8.0 g
96.0 g × 100 = 8.3%  
 
%C = 12.0 g
96.0 g × 100 = 12.5% 
 
%O = 48.0 g
96.0 g × 100 = 50.0%

4. Assume you have 1 mol Fe2(MnO4)3. It would contain the following: 
 
2(55.8) = 111.6 g Fe 
 
3(54.9) = 164.7 g Mn 
 
12(16.0) = 192.0 g O 
 
Then the total molar mass: 
 
111.6 g + 164.7 g + 192.0 g = 468.3 g/mol 
 
And the percent composition: 
 
%Fe = 111.6 g
468.3 g × 100 = 23.8%  
 
%Mn = 164.7 g
468.3 g × 100 = 35.2% 
 
%O = 192.0 g
468.3 g × 100 = 41.0%  
5. Remember that the empirical formula is the simplest formula—that is, the formula with the 
lowest possible whole-number ratio of the atoms of the elements in the compound. 
A. CH 
B. Na2Cr2O7
C. C6H15N

6. Assume 1 mol C8H10N2O2. It would contain the following:

10(1.0) = 10.0 g H 
 
2(14.0) = 28.0 g N 
 
2(16.0) = 32.0 g O 
 
Then the total molar mass: 
 
96.0 g + 10.0 g + 28.0 g + 32.0 g = 166.0 g/mol 
 
And the percent composition: 
 
%C = 96.0 g
166.0 g × 100 = 57.8%  
 
%H = 10.0 g
166.0 g × 100 = 6.0%  
 
%N = 28.0 g
166.0 g × 100 = 16.9%  
 
%O = 32.0 g
166.0 g × 100 = 19.3%  
7. The answer is the same. The empirical formula must contain the same relative amounts of each 
element. All that happens if you do the calculation is that every number is divided by 2. The %C, 
for example, would just be 48.0 g
83.0 g × 100 = 57.8%, and so forth.

8. You are paying $9.00/kg for the axinite and selling the aluminum for $50.00/kg, but only a small 
fraction of the axinite is actually aluminum. You will make a profit if you can sell the aluminum 
for a high enough price to compensate for all the other elements that you pay for when you buy 
the axinite but never would be able to sell. 
 
Let’s compute the percentage of aluminum in axinite. 
 
The molar mass of axinite is as follows: 
 
1(1.0) + 3(40.1) + 2(27.0) + 10.8 + 4(28.1) + 16(16.0) = 554.5 g/mol 
 
We then calculate the percentage of aluminum: 
 
%Al = 54.0 g
554.5 g × 100 = 9.74% 
 
So for each kilogram of axinite that you process, you only obtain 0.0974 kg Al. 
 
At $50.00/kg, you calculate the value of the aluminum: 
 
(0.0974 kg)($50.00/kg) = $4.86

Solving Empirical Formula Problems 
1. A and B. You can calculate C and D from the formula (and a table of atomic weights), but the 
subscripts do not tell you directly. 
2. A, C, D, and E would all have the same percent composition because they all have the same 
empirical formula: C2H3O. 
3. If there are only 2 elements in the compound, then the %O would have to be 100  40.07, or 59.93%. 
 
To determine the empirical formula, assume 100 g of the compound. From the percent 
composition, we know that this sample would contain 40.07 g S and 59.93 g O. We can 
determine how many moles there are of each element using their known molar masses. 
40.07 g
32.1 g/mol  = 1.25 mol S 
59.93 g
16.0 g/mol  = 3.75 mol O 
 
Bringing those 2 results together produces a formula of S1.25O3.75. Dividing both subscripts by 
1.25 to find the simplest whole-number ratio gives us an empirical formula of SO3.
4. Again, assume 100 g of the compound and determine how many moles there are of each element. 
13.53 g
55.8 g/mol  = 0.242 mol Fe 
39.93 g
54.9 g/mol  = 0.726 mol Mn 
46.53 g
16.0 g/mol  = 2.91 mol O 
 
Bringing those 3 results together produces a formula of Fe0.242Mn0.726O2.91. Dividing all the 
subscripts by 0.242 produces an empirical formula of FeMn3O12.
5. First, the percentage of sulfur in the compound must be 100  57.10  4.76 = 38.14%. Assume 
100 g of the compound and proceed as in the last 2 questions. 
57.10 g
12.0 g/mol  = 4.76 mol C 
4.76 g
1.0 g/mol  = 4.76 mol H 
38.14 g
32.1 g/mol  = 1.19 mol S 
 
This produces a formula of C4.76H4.76S1.19. Dividing all the subscripts by 1.19 produces an 
empirical formula of C4H4S. 
116

6. The percentage of oxygen in the uranium oxide must be 100  84.7 = 15.3%. 
 
Assume 100 g of the compound and continue as before. 
84.7 g
238.0 g/mol  = 0.356 mol U 
15.3 g
16.0 g/mol  = 0.956 mol O 
 
This produces a formula of U0.356O0.956. Dividing both subscripts by 0.356 produces a formula of 
UO2.68. Now you have to recognize that 2.68 is about 2 2
3 . To rid the formula of fractions, 
multiple both subscripts by the denominator 3. This produces an empirical formula of U3O8.
7. The percentage of oxygen in the compound must be 100  30.43 = 69.57%. 
 
Assume 100 g of the compound and continue. 
30.43 g
14.0 g/mol  = 2.17 mol N 
69.57 g
16.0 g/mol  = 4.35 mol O 
 
This produces a formula of N2.17O4.35. Dividing both subscripts by 2.17 produces an empirical 
formula of NO2. If this were the actual molecular formula, its molar mass would be  
1(14.0) + 2(16.0) = 46 g/mol. Since the actual molar mass is 92.0 g/mol, and since 92.0
46.0  = 2, the 
molecular formula must be twice the empirical formula, or N2O4.
8. Assume 100 g of the compound. 
30.19 g
12.0 g/mol  = 2.52 mol C 
5.03 g
1.0 g/mol  = 5.03 mol H 
44.60 g
35.5 g/mol  = 1.26 mol Cl 
20.17 g
32.1 g/mol  = 0.628 mol S 
 
This produces a formula of C2.52H5.03Cl1.26S0.628. Dividing all subscripts by 0.628 produces an 
empirical formula of C4H8Cl2S. If this were the molecular formula, the molar mass of the 
compound would be 4(12.0) + 8(1.0) + 2(35.5) + 32.1 = 159.1 g/mol. Since this actually is the 
molar mass, in this case the empirical formula does represent the actual formula.

Writing and Balancing Chemical Equations 
1. A chemical reaction is a process where 1 or more substances are transformed into 1 or more 
different substances. 
2. Some indications that a chemical reaction has occurred are the formation of a precipitate, the 
production of a gas, a color change, or a temperature change that occurs even though we did not 
heat or cool the system. Making these observations does not guarantee that a chemical reaction 
has occurred, but it is an indication. The formation of a precipitate and the production of a gas are 
stronger indicators than just a color change or a change in temperature. Temperature changes are 
particularly suspect and not all that strong an indication.

A. False. The coefficients tell you nothing about how many moles of reactants and products are 
actually in the container. You can obviously put in any amount of the reactants and products 
into the container that you wish. 
B. False. See above. 
C. False. Although the coefficients do not automatically tell you this, you could calculate it. 
D. True. This is the most important thing to understand. 
E. True. 
F. False. You do not have to mix reactants and products in the mole ratio given in the equation 
for them to react. If you mix them in a different ratio, all that happens is that one reactant will 
get all used up and the others will be in excess and will remain after the reaction is complete.

5. You decided to purchase 1 oz, or 28.35 g, of the alloy. This would cost (28.35 g)($25.00/g) = 
$708.75. You will make a profit if there is enough gold in that 1 oz of alloy to return more than 
the $708.75 you paid for the alloy in the first place. So let’s calculate how many grams of gold 
are actually in 1 oz of the alloy. 
 
Since it took 34.39 g HNO3 to completely react with all of the copper in 1 oz of the alloy, the 
number of grams of copper in 1 oz of the alloy can be calculated as follows: 
 
HNO3 = 1.0 + 14.0 + 3(14.0) = 63.0 g/mol 
3
34.39 g HNO
63.0 g/mol  = 0.5459 mol HNO3
 
(0.5459 mol HNO3)(
3
3 mol Cu
8 mol HNO ) = 0.2047 mol Cu 
 
(0.2047 mol Cu)(63.5 g/mol) = 13 g Cu 
 
So in 1 oz, or 28.35 g, of the alloy you purchased, there were 13 g Cu, which means that there 
were 28.35  13 = 15.35 g Au, or 15.35 g Au
28.35 g/oz  = 0.5414 oz Au. When you sell this, you would receive 
(0.5414 oz)($1,000.00/oz) = $541.45. It is another scam. You bought the alloy for $708.75, but 
only extracted enough gold to get $541.45 when you sold it.

Stoichiometry Problems 
1. The general approach to a typical stoichiometry problem would involve the following steps: 
A. Take the amount of the starting substance and convert it into moles if it is not given in these units. 
B. Work the mole-mole problem to find the number of moles of the substance you are asked to find. 
C. Convert the moles of the substance you are asked to find into whatever units are requested. 
2. A, because what you were given was given in moles, so there was no need to convert it 
into moles. 
 
D, because the coefficients represent molecule ratios as well as mole ratios.  
 
E, because you convert the amount of energy directly into moles of the substance requested.
The energy term is treated in a manner similar to how it would be treated if it were an actual 
starting substance. 
 
F, because the coefficients represent volume ratios for gases at the same temperature 
and pressure.

Now set up an equation for the total number of moles of H2 produced.

produced.

The calculation they showed was correct. 
B. It is not a good deal, because Sc2O3 is the excess reactant, not the limiting reactant. To

Lecture Nineteen 
An Introduction to Molarity 
1. While most of these are not actually used, all the listed ratios are valid (but perhaps not very 
useful) ways of expressing the concentration of a solution because they are all ratios of an amount 
of solute (expressed in various units) to either an amount of solvent or an amount of solution. 
2. B, C, D, and F. G is not correct because you need a total of 1 L solution, which would not require 
1 L water. 
3. The 250 mL is 1
4  L. Since a 1.00 M solution contains 1 mol NaOH per liter, 1
4  L of this solution 
would only require 1
4  mol NaOH, or 10.0 g NaOH. To prepare this solution, you would get a 
250-mL volumetric flask. You would add some distilled water to the flask, then add your 10.0 g 
of NaOH. You would swirl the flask until the NaOH dissolved completely, then add water until 
the total volume of the solution reaches the etch mark on the neck of the flask, which means you 
have a total volume of solution equal to 250 mL. 
4. Neither. The first solution has a concentration of 8 drops/2.00 L, or 4. The second solution has a 
concentration of 1 drop/0.250 L, or 4. Since the 2 solutions have the same concentration, they 
should appear equally dark.

Solving Molarity Problems 
1.
0.423 mol
0.25 L  = 1.69 M 
2. Na2WO4= 2(23.0) + 183.8 + 4(16.0) = 293.8 g/mol 
255 g
293.8 g/mol  = 0.8679 mol 
0.8679 mol
0.388 L  = 2.24 M 
3. The solution we are asked to prepare would contain the following: 
 
(1.25 mol K2CrO4/L)(0.500 L) = 0.625 mol K2CrO4
 
Since we have to obtain this amount of K2CrO4 by weighing it out, we will have to determine 
how much this weighs. 
 
K2CrO4 = 2(39.1) + 52.0 + 4(16.0) = 194.2 g/mol 
 
(0.625 mol)(194.2 g/mol) = 121.4 g K2CrO4
 
You would take a 500 mL volumetric flask, pour some water into it, add the 121.4 grams of 
K2CrO4, swirl it until it dissolves, and then add enough water to reach the 500 mL etch mark on 
the neck of the volumetric flask. 
4. (0.333 mol/L)(0.125 L) = 0.0416 mol HNO3
5. (2.22 mol/L)(0.038 L) = 0.08436 mol H2SO4
 
(0.08436 mol H2SO4)(98.1 g/mol) = 8.28 g H2SO4
6. First, let’s work this the “long” way. 
 
mol HNO3 in 250 mL of 0.75 M HNO3 = (0.75 mol/L)(0.250 L) = 0.1875 mol 
0.1875 mol
0.25 mol/L  = 0.75 L = 750 mL 
 
Or you can just think about it this way: Since the first solution is only 1
3  as concentrated as the 
second, it will take 3 times the volume to obtain the same number of moles of solute. 
7.

6.00 mol/L  = 0.573 L = 573 mL 
8. C12H22O11 = 342.0 g/mol 
50.00 g
342.0 g/mol  = 0.1462 mol 
0.1462 mol
3.00 mol/L  = 0.0487 L = 48.7 mL 
9. Assume you had 1.00 L of the entire solution. 
 
Total mass of solution = (1.15 g/mL)(1000 mL) = 1150 g 
 
Mass of water = 922 g (since water has a density of 1.00 g/mL and you had 922 mL of H2O) 
 
1150 g – 922 g = 228 g C12H22O11
 
mol C12H22O11 = 
228 g
342.0 g/mol  = 0.667 mol = 0.667 M (since we prepared 1.00 L of solution)

Advanced Molarity Problems 
1. Here is the “grind out the answer” approach: 
 
mol HCl = (6.0 mol/L)(0.050 L) = 0.30 mol HCl 
0.30 mol
0.100 L  = 3.00 M 
 
Now compare the insightful approach: 
 
Since we are doubling the volume of the solution from 50 mL to 100 mL without adding any 
additional HCl, the new concentration will just have to be half the original concentration. 
2. mol NaOH required = (1.00 mol/L)(0.500 L) = 0.500 mol NaOH 
0.500 mol
3.25 mol/L  = 0.154 L = 154 mL 
3.
A. mol HC2H3O2 required = (0.50 mol/L)(0.500 L) = 0.250 mol H2C3O2
0.250 mol
17.4 mol/L  = 0.0144 L = 14.4 mL 
B. You would take a 500-mL volumetric flask, pour 14.4 mL of the glacial acetic acid into the 
flask, and then add water until the volume of the entire solution reached the 500 mL etch 
mark on the neck of the flask. 
4. mol HCl coming from the first solution = (1.88 mol/L)(0.125 L) = 0.235 mol HCl 
 
mol HCl coming from the second solution = (0.63 mol/L)(0.722 L) = 0.455 mol HCl 
 
Total mol HCl in final solution = 0.235 + 0.455 = 0.690 mol HCl 
 
Total volume = 125 mL + 722 mL = 847 mL = 0.847 L 
 
[HCl] = 0.690 mol
0.847 L  = 0.815 M 
5. AgCl = 143.5 g/mol 
9.00 g AgCl
143.5 g/mol  = 0.06272 mol AgCl 
 
Since all coefficients are 1, we also have 0.06272 mol AgNO3 in this reaction, and therefore:

0.06276 mol AgNO

Therefore, SnCl4 is the limiting reactant. 
B. Sn3(PO4)4 = 3(118.7) + 4(31.0) + 16(16.0) = 736.1 g/mol

(0.1387 mol)(736.1 g/mol) = 102.1 g Sn3(PO4)4
130

11. There are three ions in excess when the reaction is complete. 
Two ions, K+ and Cl do not take part in the reaction, so they remain in the solution after the 
reaction is complete. 
Since SnCl4 was the limiting reactant (see answer to problem 10), some K3PO4 will remain when 
the reaction is complete, which means there will still be some PO4
3 present in the solution when 
the reaction is over. 
Since K+ and Cl do not take part in the reaction, their final concentrations can be determined by 
simply calculating how many moles of each of these ions were present initially and then dividing 
by the final total volume of the solution. 
From problem 10 we know that the initial #mol SnCl4 = 0.4162 mol. 
Since SnCl4  Sn4+ + 4Cl
Mole Cl = (4)(0.4162) = 1.6648 mol Cl
Final total volume = 225 mL + 350 mL = 575 mL = 0.575 L 
Final [Cl] =  
1.6648 mol
0.575 L = 2.89 M
From problem 10 we know that the initial #mol K3PO4 = 0.6195 mol 
Since K3PO4  3K+ + PO4
3
Mole K+ = (3)(0.6195) = 1.8585 mol K+
Final [K+] =  
1.8585 mol
0.575 L = 3.23M
To find the #mol of PO4
3 first determine how many mol of K3PO4 remain when the reaction is 
complete. To find this, subtract the number of mol of K3PO4 that reacted from the number of mol 
of K3PO4 that were present initially. 
The equation for the reaction that occurs (see problem 10) tells us that for every mol of SnCl4 that 
react
4
3  mol of K3PO4 are consumed. 
So mole K3PO4 consumed = (0.4162)( 4
3 ) = 0.5549 mol 
#mol K3PO4 remaining = 0.6195 – 0.5549 = 0.06457 
Since K3PO4  3K+ + PO4
3
[PO4
3] =  
0.06457 mol
0.575 L
= 0.112 M

Lecture Twenty-Two 
Basic Concepts of Chemical Equilibrium 
1. This means that for all practical purposes, the reaction only runs in 1 direction. The reactants just 
keep reacting until at least 1 of them is completely consumed. 
2. A reversible reaction is basically a reaction that has at least a reasonable tendency to go in either 
direction—admittedly a somewhat ambiguous and nonrigorous definition, but one that hopefully 
helps to clarify the concept. 
3. A, B, and E are true. 
4. A, B, C, D, and F are true.  
For C, the ratio of how many moles per liter of A are consumed and of D are produced is 
determined by their coefficients in the balanced chemical equation. For example, suppose we 
started with 10 mol of A and 3 mol of D. If 1 mol of A were consumed, then 2 mol of D would be 
produced—period. The total number of moles of A and D in the container would end up being 9 
and 5 respectively, but these two numbers are in no direct way related to the coefficients of A and 
D in the balanced chemical equation.  
 
For D, since no C or D was initially present, they will be produced in a mole ratio the same as 
their coefficients in the balanced chemical equation.  
 
For F, again, the ratio at which A and B are consumed is determined by their coefficients in the 
balanced chemical equation and is in no way related to the amounts of these substances initially 
present in the container. 
5. The coefficients tell you the mole ratio in which the substances react with each other. 
6. This is really a stoichiometry problem. It does not have anything to do with equilibrium. 
 
mol C = (1.50 mol D)( 4 mol C
2 mol D ) = 3.00 mol C 
 
mol A consumed = (1.50 mol D)( 3 mol A
2 mol D ) = 2.25 mol A  
 
mol A remaining at equilibrium = 7.00  2.25 = 4.75 mol A 
 
mol B consumed = (1.50 mol D)( 1 mol B
2 mol C ) = 0.75 mol B  
 
mol B remaining at equilibrium = 2.00  0.75 = 1.25 mol B 
132

Lecture Twenty-Three 
An Introduction to the Equilibrium Constant 
1. B is the only true statement. C is false because although you will produce 3 times as much C as 
D, you already had 1 mol C and 1 mol D to begin with. So, for example, if you were to actually 
produce 3 mol C and 1 mol D (an impossibility, since that would use up all of B, which is not 
allowed, since this is an equilibrium system, but let’s keep the math simple), you would end up 
with a total of 4 mol C and 2 mol D at equilibrium.

3. The lines represent how the concentrations of all the reactants and products are changing with 
time. A straight line says that the concentrations just keep changing at a constant rate until 
equilibrium is achieved and then abruptly stop changing and remain constant—not too sensible, 
when you think about it. What actually happens is that as the rates of the forward and reverse 
reactions get closer and closer to being equal as you approach equilibrium, the rate at which all 
the concentrations are changing will become smaller and smaller. Think about that. Let’s say we 
start with only reactants; their concentrations will be falling rather rapidly at the start, and the 
concentrations of the products will be rising rather rapidly. But as time passes, 2 things happen. 
First, as the concentration of the reactants decreases, we would expect the rate of the forward 
reaction to decrease. In addition, once we produce some products and the reverse reaction starts 
to take place, we will also be producing some reactants as well as consuming them. This means 
that the net rate at which the reactants are being used up will be decreasing. A similar argument 
applies to the rate at which the products are going to be produced. The slope of these lines will 
have to “flatten out,” eventually becoming the horizontal lines that indicate that an equilibrium 
state has been achieved. 
133

Lecture Twenty-Four 
Interpreting an Equilibrium Constant 
1. A silly question, since the answer is obviously zero. But students often tend, quite logically, to 
misspell this word as “equalibrium.” 
2. When working an equilibrium problem, you need someplace to start—something that you can 
write down and use as the focal point of your solution. In stoichiometry problems, we knew that 
the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation told us the mole ratios in which the reactants 
and products were related. In the case of equilibrium problems, this is often the equilibrium 
constant expression and the fact that, at equilibrium, its numerical value will be equal to the 
equilibrium constant for the reaction. 
3. Because for an equilibrium constant to be negative, at least 1 of the concentrations of the 
reactants or products would have to have a negative concentration, which is impossible. 
4. It can vary from essentially zero virtually to infinity. They are among the smallest and largest 
numbers you encounter in nature. 
5.
A. Probably false. A large value for K would actually tend to indicate that you would most likely 
have a lot more products than reactants at equilibrium. As shown in the lecture, it is possible,
by using outrageously large and small concentrations, to end up with more reactants than 
products, but using “normal” starting concentrations you would certainly not have more 
reactants than products if K is large. 
B. Probably true. When K for a reaction is very large, it is certainly true that at equilibrium you 
will most likely have more products than reactants, but again, if we use outrageously large 
and small concentrations of individual reactants and/or products, it is mathematically possible 
to end up with more reactants than products (see the example in the lecture). But again, if we 
start with “normal” concentrations, we will most likely end up with more products than 
reactants at equilibrium. 
C. A reasonable but somewhat ambiguous interpretation. The word “favored” does not have a 
clear, specific meaning. 
D. Likewise, a reasonable but somewhat ambiguous interpretation. The phrase “lies to the right” 
does not have a clear, specific meaning. 
6.
A. Reaction 1. 
B. Reaction 3. 
C. Reaction 2. The extremely large value for the equilibrium constant tells us that this reaction 
essentially goes to completion. The concentration of O2 remaining at equilibrium would be 
0.50 M. You started with 1.00 mol of both H2 and O2. The reaction essentially goes to 
completion. The stoichiometry of the reaction says that the entire 1.00 mol of H2 would be 
consumed, and at the same time 0.50 mol of O2 would be consumed, leaving you with 0.50 
mol of O2 in the system after the reaction has essentially gone to completion.  
7.
A. K = 
1
4.00  = 0.25. This is true because when you reverse the equation, the new K = [A][B]
[C][D] , which 
is just the reciprocal of the equilibrium constant expression for the forward reaction. 
B. K = 16.00. The original K was [C][D]
[A][B] . The new K is 
2
2
2
2
[C] [D]
[A] [B] , which is just equal to the original 
equilibrium constant expression squared. 
134

C. K = 
1
2
1
4.00
(
)  = 0.50. You have reversed the equation, so the new K will be the reciprocal of the 
old K, but you also have multiplied the equation by 1
2 , and following what we learned above, 
this would mean that we now have to take the new K to the 1
2  power (the square root).

Lecture Twenty-Five 
Le Chatelier’s Principle—Concentration 
1. If a stress is applied 
to a system at equilibrium, 
the system will shift, 
if possible, 
in the direction 
that completely, 
or at least partially, 
alleviates the stress. 
2. Stress is defined as a change in the concentration of one of the reactants or products, a change in 
pressure, or a change in temperature. 
3.
A. Left 
B. The concentrations of C6H6 and O2 would increase. 
 
The concentration of H2O would decrease. 
 
There would be a net increase in the concentration of CO2. It would decrease as the system 
shifts but would not be able to get back to where it was originally. You would not be able to 
completely alleviate this concentration stress. 
C. Nothing 
4.
A. Right

B. The concentration of OH would decrease. 
 
There would be a net increase in the concentration of H+.
 
The concentration of H2O would not change, because it is a pure liquid. The amount of water 
would increase, but not its concentration. 
C. Nothing 
7. The molarity of anything is simply the number of moles of that substance contained in 1 L. A liter 
of water would weigh 1000 g. Since the molar mass of water is 18.0 g/mol, 1 mol water would 
contain
1000 g
18.0 g/mol  = 55.5 M. 
137

Lecture Twenty-Six 
Le Chatelier—Pressure and Temperature 
1. A, B, C, D, and E. F is false because for some substances you can only determine what happens 
to the amount of the substance, not its concentration, since the pressure change was brought about 
by changing the volume of the system, which also has an influence on the final concentration. G 
is false because Le Chatelier’s principle can only be applied to a system that has already achieved 
a state of equilibrium. If a system has not yet achieved equilibrium, there is no way to apply the 
principle to determine which direction the reaction will proceed.
2.
A. Right 
B. The concentrations of CO2 and H2O would increase. 
 
The concentration of C6H6 would decrease. 
 
There would be a net increase in the concentration of O2. It would decrease as the system 
shifts but would not be able to get back to where it was originally. You would not be able to 
completely alleviate this concentration stress. 
C. Nothing 
D. Right. If pressure were decreased, the system would want to do the opposite, or increase the 
pressure. If the system shifts to the right, the number of gaseous molecules in the container 
would increase, since there are 17 molecules of gaseous reactants but 18 molecules of 
gaseous products. More gaseous molecules will exert more pressure. 
E. The amounts of CO2 and H2O would increase. 
 
The amounts of C6H6 and O2 would decrease. 
F. Nothing 
G. Left. If temperature is increased, the system would want to decrease the temperature. The 
reaction as written is exothermic, as indicated by the negative sign in front of H. When an 
exothermic reaction occurs (like burning a candle in a sealed bottle), the temperature 
increases, so when an endothermic reaction occurs (like ice melting inside a container), the 
temperature inside the system will decrease. The reverse reaction is endothermic, so the 
system would shift to the left. 
H. The concentration of both reactants would increase, while the concentration of both products 
would decrease. 
I. Decrease. If the system shifts to the left, the concentration of the products (the numerator in 
the expression for K) would decrease and the concentration of the reactants (the denominator 
in the expression for K) would increase. 
3.
A. Right 
B. The concentrations of CO and hydrogen would both decrease. 
 
The concentration of CH4 would increase. 
 
There would be a net decrease in the concentration of H2O(g). 
C. Nothing 
D. Right 
E. The amounts of both reactants would decrease, while the amount of both products 
would increase. 
F. Nothing 
138

G. Left 
H. The concentrations of both reactants would increase. The concentrations of both products 
would decrease. 
I. It would decrease. 
4.
A. It would not shift, because we had not changed the volume. When applying Le Chatelier’s 
principle, we only consider pressure changes brought about by a decrease or increase 
in volume. 
B. It would shift to the left. The helium itself has nothing to do with the shifting, but if you are 
going to inject helium into the container but are going to keep the total pressure at 1.88 atm, 
you are going to have to increase the volume of the container. If you do not, the pressure 
inside would increase due to the presence of the additional helium gas. Increasing the volume 
would constitute a decrease in pressure in the Le Chatelier game rules. If the pressure were 
decreased, the system would want to increase the pressure, so it would shift to the left, where 
there are more gaseous molecules.

Lecture Twenty-Eight 
The Self-Ionization of Water 
1. The purpose was to show the difference between strong electrolytes, weak electrolytes, and 
nonelectrolytes. Solutions of nonelectrolytes do not conduct electricity. Solutions of strong 
electrolytes, assuming they are soluble, are excellent conductors of electricity. Solutions of weak 
electrolytes conduct electricity, but nowhere near as well as an equivalent solution of a strong 
electrolyte. In addition, the demonstration showed that pure water is essentially a nonelectrolyte. 
Any conductivity detected in water is due to substances that are dissolved in the water, typically 
minerals, which are ionic solids. 
2. Electricity is the movement of electrical charge.  
3. In a solid material that conducts electricity, like a metal, the moving charges are electrons. In a 
solution, the moving charges are ions. 
4. 2H2O  H3O+ + OH
 
H2O  H+ + OH
 
There is no “correct” equation. Both are commonly used. The first probably more accurately 
represents what actually exists in solution, since it is not possible for just H+ to exist in water 
because H+ would just be a bare proton. A bare proton cannot exist in water. It would attach itself 
to a water molecule. 
 
The second is better for our purposes because it makes it easier to write equations for acid-base 
reactions and equilibrium constants for many reactions that we will be discussing. In addition, 
while H+ is not what actually exists in solution, it is doubtful that H3O+ is what actually exists 
anyway. The actual situation is probably quite complex. 
5. If we use the equation H2O(l)  H+ + OH

C. It is neutral, despite its pH being less than 7. There is nothing magical about a pH of 7. The 
only reason this number represents a neutral solution at room temperature is because at 25°C 
this is the pH at which the concentrations of hydrogen ion and hydroxide are equal to each 
other, both being equal to 107 M. At higher temperatures water is more highly ionized. This 
means that both the hydrogen and hydroxide ion concentrations are higher. This means that 
both the pH and pOH are lower than 7. But since the concentrations of these 2 ions are still 
equal to each other, the solution is still neutral.

9. The key ideas here are that the H+ comes from the HCl and the OH comes from the NaOH. Each 
mole of HCl will produce 1 mol H+ (HCl  H+ + Cl) and each mole of NaOH will produce  
1 mol OH (NaOH  Na+ + OH).

mol OH = (1.44 mol/L)(0.04500 L) = 0.06480 mol OH
 
Since H+ and OH react in a 1:1 mol ratio, the OH is in excess, and the amount of  
OH remaining after the reaction is as follows: 
 
0.06480  0.04636 = 0.01844 mol OH

7. This was a trick problem. You can completely ignore any H+ coming from the HC2H3O2.
HC2H3O2 is a weak acid. The amount of H+ coming from this acid will be negligible compared to 
the amount coming from the HCl. HCl is one of our 6 strong acids. Therefore, the concentration 
of H+ in the solution will just be about 0.50 M, since you end up with 0.500 mol of HCl in a total 
volume of 1.00 L. Consequently, pH = log0.50 = 0.30. If you actually wanted to do the 
calculation, you would just set up the equilibrium constant expression for HC2H3O2 as follows. 
Ka = 
+

You would let x = mol/L HC2H3O2 that ionize, but the total concentration of H+ in the solution 
would equal what came from the HCl, 0.50 M, plus what came from the HC2H3O2, x. The 
equilibrium constant expression that you would end up solving would be as follows. 
(0.50 + )( )
0.50

x
x

 = 1.8 × 105
 
When you neglect x compared to 0.50, and then solve for x, it just comes out to be 1.8 × 105.
Since the total [H+] = 0.50 + x, but x is so small you just get [H+] = 0.50 M—which is what we 
knew would be true without having to solve any equation.

Lecture Thirty-Two 
Titrating Acids and Bases 
1. When a strong acid reacts with a strong base, the reaction that occurs is just the hydrogen ions 
from the acid reacting with the hydroxide ions from the base. The equation for this reaction is just 
H+ + OH  H2O. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is just the reciprocal of the 
equilibrium constant for the ionization of water, so its numerical value would be  
14
1
1.00  10
×
 
or 1.00 × 1014. This is such a large value that we can say this neutralization reaction goes to 
completion for all practical purposes. 
2. The equivalence point is the point in the titration where you have added the correct amount of 
base to just neutralize the amount of acid present in the solution, or vice versa. The end point is 
typically the point in the titration where whatever indicator you are using changes color and you 
therefore end the titration.
3. The end point and the equivalence point typically differ from each other by an insignificant 
amount in a well-designed titration experiment. Ensuring that an experiment is well designed can 
at times be somewhat complex, depending on the actual titration being performed, but titration 
experiments found in commercial laboratory manuals are assumed to meet such a criterion. 
4. Although not the best definition, for the time being we have defined an indicator as a substance 
that is one color in an acidic solution and a different color in a basic solution. Two indicators 
commonly used in high school laboratories are litmus and phenolphthalein. Litmus is red (more 
like pink) in an acid and blue (or something kind of like blue) in a base. Phenolphthalein is 
colorless in an acid and red (usually looking more pink) in a base. 
5.
A. After you wash a burette, there is water on the inside. If you just filled the burette with the 
solution it was going to hold, this solution would be diluted by the water left inside the 
burette. This would alter the concentration of the solution of acid or base you were using in 
the titration. In the case of the acid, you would end up determining the concentration of this 
diluted acid rather than the acid whose concentration you were actually trying to determine. 
In the case of the base, which would be your standard solution, you would be titrating with a 
base whose concentration was different from the concentration value you would be using in 
your calculations. 
B. If you do not drain a bit of the solution out of the burettes, the first little bit of solution that 
you think you are adding to the reaction vessel is used to just fill the tip of the burette and 
never actually makes it into the reaction vessel. This makes you think that you have added 
more of the solution to the reaction vessel than you actually have. 
C. The reason you add some distilled water to the reaction vessel is simply to give you a larger total 
volume of solution in the vessel. The titration will work if you do not do this, but the volume of 
acid and base used in a titration is usually so small that you end up with just a relatively small 
volume of solution in a rather large vessel. It is easier to mix, swirl, and so forth if you make the 
volume of the solution a bit larger. That is the only reason you add the distilled water. 
D. You need to keep the solution thoroughly mixed. As you add the base, local areas of the 
solution will be completely neutralized, changing the color of the indicator in these areas. But 
you need to neutralize the entire solution, so it must be thoroughly mixed, which is usually 
accomplished by swirling the solution, since the reaction vessel is typically an Erlenmeyer 
flask, which lends itself to swirling. 
150

E. Although our original plan was to carefully add base until a good end point is achieved, you 
can “back-titrate” if you should overshoot the end point, and if you then overshoot the end 
point going in the opposite direction, you can add more base. It does not matter how the end 
point is arrived at. An end point is an end point. Just remember to take the new “final” 
reading on your acid or base burette. 
6.
A. Volume of acid used = 44.25  1.55 = 42.70 mL 
 
Volume of base used = 32.50  0.75 = 31.75 mL 
 
The acid is less concentrated than the base, so its molarity will be less than 0.383 M. 
 
We know this because at the end point (equivalence point, we assume), the number of moles 
of HCl is equal to the number of moles of NaOH we added. This is true because the 
molecular equation for the reaction is HCl + NaOH  NaCl + H2O. Since the number of 
moles of acid was contained in a larger volume than the base (42.70 mL versus 31.75 mL), 
the acid must be less concentrated than the base. 
B. mol NaOH = (0.383 mol/L)(0.03175 L) = 0.01216 mol NaOH 
 
mol HCl = 0.01216 mol (moles of acid and base are equal) 
 
[HCl] = 0.01216 mol
0.04270 L  = 0.285 M 
7. The catch in this problem is that sulfuric acid has 2 hydrogens that must be neutralized. The 
balanced equation for the reaction that occurs is as follows: 
 
H2SO4 + 2NaOH  Na2SO4 + 2H2O
 
Consequently, the number of moles of acid present in the unknown solution is only half the 
number of moles of NaOH that were added. 
 
Volume of H2SO4 used = 22.25  0.15 = 22.10 mL 
 
Volume of NaOH used = 46.50  1.05 = 45.45 mL 
 
mol NaOH used = (0.558 mol/L)(0.04545 L) = 0.02536 mol 
 
mol H2SO4 used = 0.02536
2
 = 0.01268 mol 
 
[H2SO4] = 0.01268 mol
0.02210 L  = 0.574 M 
8.
A. It works because when you multiply the molarity of a solution times the volume of the 
solution (in liters), you get the number of moles of acid or base, and at the equivalence point 
the moles of acid and base must be equal to each other. In actual practice, the volumes are 
typically plugged in units of milliliters, for convenience, which is fine, since we have the 
same volume units on both side of the equation, so converting them to liters would not 
accomplish anything. 
B. It will not work if you have a reaction like the one in the previous problem, where the mole 
ratio between the acid and base is not 1:1. In cases like this, the number of moles of acid and 
base are not equal to each other at the equivalence point. 
C. It is not needed. Why use a special formula rather than just think through and understand 
what you are doing, especially when the special formula does not always work anyway?

Lecture Thirty-Three 
Titration Curves and Indicators 
1. B, E, F, H, and I 
2. An indicator is a weak acid or base whose molecular form is one color while its ionic form is a 
different color. 
3. Indicators do not have any kind of special property that causes them to change color rapidly 
around the equivalence point of a titration. The reason they change color so rapidly is simply 
because the ratio of the 2 forms of the indicator—the molecular form and the ionic form—
depends on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. At the equivalence point of a 
titration, the concentration of hydrogen ions changes dramatically, perhaps by a factor of about 1 
million, which in turn causes the ratio of the 2 forms of the indicator to also change by this factor. 
This is what causes the dramatic and abrupt color change, not some special property of the 
indicator itself. 
4. Different indicators change color over a small pH range on either side of the numerical value for 
logKa for that indicator. Since different indicators have different values for their ionization 
constants, they will change color over different pH ranges. 
5. It should change color around a pH = log(8.3 × 106), or 5.08. 
6. When you titrate a strong acid with a weak base, the solution at the equivalence point is still 
somewhat acidic, and vice versa. 
7. We want to select an indicator that will change color at or close to the equivalence point of 
the titration.
A. b, Litmus: When we titrate a strong acid like HNO3 with a strong base like NaOH, the 
equivalence point will occur at a pH of 7, so we select an indicator like litmus, which changes 
color at a pH of about 7. 
B. c, Alizarin yellow: When we titrate a weak acid like HC2H3O2 with a strong base like KOH, 
we expect the pH at the equivalence point to be above 7 (“me weak acid; ME STRONG 
BASE”). Alizarin yellow changes color over a pH range from 10.0 to 12.0. 
C. a, Methyl red: When we titrate a weak base like NH3 with a strong acid like HCl, we expect 
the pH at the equivalence point to be below 7 (“me weak base; ME STRONG ACID”). 
Methyl red changes color over a pH range from 4.4 to 6.2. 
8. Student B had better not agree with Student A. It will take both students 50.0 mL of NaOH to 
reach the equivalence point of their titrations. Although there is very little H+ in a solution of a 
weak acid like HClO, as pointed out in the lecture, as you neutralize the H+ that is present in the 
solution, more of the HClO will ionize to try to replace the H+ that was consumed, as is predicted 
by Le Chatelier’s principle. The better plan is to just to have each student neutralize 25.0 mL of 
their respective acids. Each student will then only require 25.0 mL of the NaOH, so there will be 
enough for both of them, assuming they do not mess up the titration. 
9.
A. False. Since our starting solution was a weak acid and therefore not as highly ionized, the 
concentration of H+ in our initial acid solution would not be as great as it would be in a strong 
acid, so the starting pH would be a bit higher. 
B. True 
C. False 
152

D. True. The old “ME STRONG BASE; me weak acid” thing. 
E. False

10. The first thing to realize is that the equation given only shows the essential reacting species. The 
K+ and Na+ really have nothing to do with the actual reaction that takes place between the KHP 
and the NaOH. The next thing to realize is that KHP and NaOH react with each other in a 1:1 
mole ratio. For every mole of KHP you have, you need 1 mol NaOH to neutralize it. Then you 
have to realize that even though the K+ has nothing to do with the reaction, it must be included 
when you determine the molar mass of the KHP, since it is present in the KHP when you weigh 
out the 4.878-g sample.

10. No. This would be true if they had the same general form for their solubility product expressions, 
but if the 2 compounds have formulas with differing subscripts, the concentration terms in their 
solubility product expressions would have different exponents. This means that it could turn out 
that the product with the smaller value for Ksp might actually have a higher molar solubility. You 
would not know until you did the numerical calculations.

Lecture Thirty-Five 
Solubility Equilibria—Common Ion Effect 
1. The common ion effect refers to the shifting of an equilibrium system caused by the addition or 
presence of a ion contained in the system from a source other than the equilibrium system itself. 
Le Chatelier’s principle predicts this effect. If, for example, you were to add some Cl or Ag+ to a 
saturated solution of AgCl(s), AgCl(s)  Ag+ + Cl, from a source separate from the AgCl itself 
(like NaCl or AgNO3), Le Chatelier’s principle predicts that since this would cause an increase in 
the concentration of either the Cl or the Ag+, and since the system would want to undo this 
stress, it would shift to the left, precipitating out some AgCl. This means that less AgCl remains 
dissolved, which of course means that its solubility is less than it was in pure water.

There are 2 sources of F in this problem. The 2x mol/L come from the MgF2, but we must also 
include the F that comes from the KF, which is completely soluble: KF(s)  K+ + F. We get 
another 0.666 mol/L F from the KF, so the total concentration of F is equal to 0.666 + 2x.
 
[Mg2+][F]2 = 3.7 × 108
 
(x)(0.666 + 2x)2 = 3.7 × 108

The real problem is to find the equilibrium concentrations of all 3 substances, which is really a 
stoichiometry problem. 
 
[C] = 0.38 M (given) 
 
[D] = 3(0.38) = 1.14 M 
 
For A and B, you must subtract what is consumed from what you started with to find their 
equilibrium concentrations.

Again, the real problem is to find the equilibrium concentrations. We need to find out how much 
A is consumed. This will allow us to determine how much C and D are formed and how much B 
is consumed. 
 
mol A consumed = initial mol  final (equilibrium) mol = 1.75  1.26 = 0.49 mol/L  
 
Now let’s find all of the equilibrium concentrations. 
 
[A] = 1.26 M (given) 
 
[B] = 2.75  3(0.49) = 1.28 M 
 
[C] = 0.65 + 2(0.49) = 1.63 M 
 
[D] = 0.49 M 
K =

(1.63) (0.49)
(1.26)(1.28)  = 0.49 
Wow! It came out to be the same number as the number of moles per liter of A consumed! Was 
there a reason for that? No, it truly was just a coincidence.

mole ratio to just neutralize each other. 
factor-label method: A conversion process by which the quantity being converted is multiplied by a 
conversion factor (fraction) with units in the appropriate place (numerator/denominator). This process 
is also referred to as dimensional analysis or the unit factor method. 
formula unit: One empirical formula of an ionic solid. 
gram: A unit of mass equal to the mass of 1 cm3 of water at its point of maximum density, which 
occurs at a temperature of about 4°C. 
halogens: The next-to-last column of elements in the periodic table, consisting of the elements  
F, Cl, Br, I, and At. 
HONClBrIF: A mnemonic device for remembering the diatomic elements. It is pronounced  
“hon-kil-brif.”
inner transition elements: The 2 rows of elements typically placed at the bottom of most periodic 
tables and separated from the rest of the table. 
ion: A charged particle formed when an atom or group of atoms has gained or lost one or  
more electrons. 
ionic compound: A compound that consists of positively and negatively charged ions held together 
by electrostatic attraction. 
ionization constant: An equilibrium constant for the dissociation of an acid, a base, or water into 
ionized components. 
isotopes: Atoms of the same element that differ in the number of neutrons in their nuclei. 
joule: The SI unit of energy. 
Kelvin: The SI base unit for temperature. 
kilogram: The SI base unit for mass. 
Le Chatelier’s principle: If a stress is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will shift, if 
possible, in the direction that completely (or at least partially) alleviates the stress. 
172

limiting reactant (a.k.a. limiting reagent): The reactant in a chemical reaction that will limit the 
amount of product that can be produced. 
mass: The amount of matter something contains. 
mass number: A number that is equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus of 
particular atom and/or the mass of that isotope rounded off to the nearest whole number. 
metal: An element that generally will have the properties of being shiny when its surface is polished, 
being malleable, being ductile, and being a good conductor of heat and electricity; it will tend to form 
positive ions when taking part in a chemical reaction. 
metalloids (a.k.a. semimetals): Elements located near the staircase-like line that separates metals 
from nonmetals in the periodic table. Metalloids exhibit properties of both metals and nonmetals. 
meter: One of the 7 SI base units of measurement. It is equal to the distance that light travels in a 
vacuum in 
1
299,792,458  s. 
milliliter (abbr. mL): A relatively small unit of volume equal in size to a cubic centimeter (cm3).
molar mass: The mass of 1 mol of a substance.  
molar volume: The volume or space occupied by 1 mol of a substance. At STP, 1 mol of any gas

Bibliography
Textbooks
One major problem with high school textbooks (and textbooks in general) is their expense,  
which usually will be considerably greater than the cost of this entire Teaching Company  
course. Another somewhat more subtle problem is that there is a strong tendency to stay with  
what has proven to sell in the past, a fact that often makes all the texts very similar to each other  
in content and style. In particular, as far as I have been able to determine, all texts use the  
factor-label approach to solving problems, since this is an approach that is easily and  
“clearly” presented and obviously works, at least in the short term. This is an approach I have 
recommended that you not rely on, although learning it and using it as a check on your reasoning is 
something that has value. 
I’ve perused many (but not all) of the commonly used high school chemistry texts. None of them 
stand out from the rest as being significantly better or more useful. But there are a few choices that I 
can at least suggest as being appropriate for the majority of students taking a first-year high school 
chemistry course. 
Bishop, Mark. An Introduction to Chemistry. http://preparatorychemistry.com. This is clearly written, 
nicely illustrated, and most importantly is both reasonably priced and can be downloaded from  
the Internet with only a shareware payment requested—but not required. Unfortunately, there are  
also significant gaps in the content coverage (particularly those connected to equilibria, both  
general and specific) that prevent me from recommending it overall. For other topics, however, it may 
prove useful.
Davis, Raymond E., Regina Frey, Mickey Sarquis, and Jerry L. Sarquis. Modern Chemistry. Orlando, 
FL: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 2009. This is one of the standard textbooks that is widely used and 
has been around for a very long time. I have a very high regard for one of the authors, with whom I 
have worked in the past on unrelated projects. Whatever the edition, it is a textbook that almost 
certainly is a sound and safe choice, although like many texts, its approach to problem solving is 
perhaps too mechanical. Additional information and study materials can be obtained at 
http://go.hrw.com/hrw.nd/gohrw_rls1/pKeywordResults?HC6%20STUDENT. 
General Chemistry. http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/General_Chemistry. Coverage in this free WikiBook, 
in my opinion, was not always that thorough, at least as of 2009. 
Wilbraham, Antony C., Dennis D. Staley, Michael S. Matta, and Edward L. Waterman. Prentice Hall 
Chemistry. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2007. This is a traditional text from a 
major publisher. While not significantly different from other traditional texts, I liked it a bit more  
than most. It has excellent visuals and contains a large number of interesting connections  
between chemistry and the “real world.” I thought it emphasized concepts to a greater extent  
than most texts. For example, the section on density begins with the statement, “Perhaps someone  
has tricked you with this question, ‘Which is heavier, a pound of lead or a pound of feathers?’”  
It does, unfortunately, slightly misstate Le Chatelier’s principle, and it is weak on solubility  
product problems and the common ion effect, but these weaknesses are common in other high school 
texts as well.

Websites 
There obviously is an incredible amount of information that can be accessed on the Internet. Taking 
terms from a lecture, such as stoichiometry, acids and bases, pH, solubility equilibria, balancing 
equations, etc., will result in anywhere from several thousand to several million hits. The problem, 
sometimes, is that websites vary greatly in both their overall quality and accuracy; in addition, a 
website that is here today may be gone tomorrow. 
That said, some of the more useful links that you might want to take a look at include the following. 
Balancing Chemical Equations. http://www.chemistry-drills.com/balance.html. This site offers 
hundreds of trivial, easy, intermediate, and expert problems for practice balancing equations. Note 
that this page also includes links to sites that I do not recommend regarding stoichiometry. 
General Chemistry Online! http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/index.shtml. This site 
includes tutorials, a searchable glossary, answers and hints for 400 frequently asked questions, 
simulations, and an exam survival guide. 
General Chemistry Starting Points for Students. http://www.chem1.com/chemed/genchem.shtml. 
This is a multipurpose site with numerous links to other sites. Most of the links connect to sites that 
are not particularly useful for high school students, but some may prove valuable. For example, the 
section on acids and bases (under “Tutorials by Topic”) has links that might prove useful. The value 
of a particular site may depend on the academic level of the course you are taking and your particular 
style of approaching problem solving and learning.  
General Chemistry Virtual Textbook. http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/virtualtextbook.html. 
Perhaps too comprehensive and aimed at a college general chemistry course, this site still has many 
relevant and useful links. 
Story Problems. http://www.av8n.com/physics/ill-posed.htm. This really will not provide much 
specific help with the course, but I love the problem-solving philosophy espoused here, as well as 
many of the specific problems presented. Just kind of a fun site. 
Experiments 
Any laboratory activity, no matter how benign, always involves some small risk. An activity as simple as 
boiling water can result in an accident. Always follow directions when performing any activity you might 
find useful and educational, and any home experiment should be performed with adult supervision. 
If you are enrolled in a high school course, your laboratory manual should probably serve as the 
foundation for your laboratory work. If you do not have access to a laboratory, the following 
references might prove beneficial. 
Many home experiments are designed to be fun more than purely educational—not necessarily a bad 
thing, but not necessarily the best thing either. Choose whatever kinds of experiments appeal to you, 
hopefully some of both types.
Try to find experiments that directly relate to what was discussed in the lectures. I hesitate to 
recommend any particular website, as so many are available. My recommendation would be to use 
appropriate search words and then select those sites that appear to be most closely connected to your 
goals and needs. That said, a couple of sites that you might want to look at are as follows.
