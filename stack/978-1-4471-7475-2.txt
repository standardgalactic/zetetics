Introduction to the First Edition
This is a book about the people who shaped an idea – that to make sense of the 
complexity of the world, we need to look at it in terms of wholes and relationships 
rather than splitting it down into its parts and looking at each in isolation. In this 
book we call that idea systems thinking, although others have called it by other 
names (such as systems theory or systems sciences). Within this idea we include a 
number of areas which have independent origins but have tended over time to 
become interlinked while retaining their distinctiveness – general systems theory, 
cybernetics, complexity theory and system dynamics among others.
Our focus in the book is on people and how their personalities, lives and links 
with each other shaped these ideas. Other books have been written on the ideas as 
such, describing and classifying them in various ways, presenting a history of the 
ideas or arguing for the importance of one perspective or another. By focusing on 
the creators of the ideas, and by taking a broad look at a range of areas, we aim to 
shed a different light on systems thinking.
The people we write about are all fascinating, although in quite different ways. 
Some are widely known as the originators of one or another systems approach; 
some are very well known within the systems community but less so outside it; 
while others are well known figures who are less widely acknowledged as systems 
thinkers. Some are associated with a particular academic discipline, such as man-
agement, sociology or environmental studies, while others ranged widely across 
disciplines.
Each of the 30 authors in this book is discussed in a separate chapter, comprising 
two parts: first, a discussion of their life and work, and second, an extract from their 
writing. The extract, necessarily short (just a few pages) is intended to be a ‘taster’ 
to show the author’s style of writing, their concerns and interests, and to encourage 
you to read more of their work. In many cases, we have edited it to bring out the 
author’s main argument, while preserving their unique voice. It is not intended as a 
comprehensive guide to their key ideas – it is unlikely that by reading the extract in 
this book, you will be able to apply the author’s ideas, but we hope it will give you 
a sense of why the ideas are so significant, and which of the authors you might want 
to find out more about.

xiv
Defining Boundaries
One of the key concepts in many approaches to systems thinking is the boundary: 
how do you define what is within the system and what is outside of it? So it is per-
haps no surprise that we have spent a considerable amount of time defining our own 
boundaries for this book.
Our goal in the book is to describe a set of thinkers whose work has been pro-
foundly influential, and who collectively shaped the field of systems thinking. Our 
choice of thinkers is personal and partial, but it has been taken with great care and 
consideration. Inevitably you will find some exclusions that you may find puzzling 
or annoying, but we believe you will find that the thinkers we have included to be 
interesting and thought-provoking.
We are not seeking here to produce some sort of definitive canon of ‘great sys-
tems thinkers’. Any such list would be flawed and necessarily incomplete, and 
would have to arise from a widespread effort rather than the work of a small group.
Two constraints affecting our choice were that we limited ourselves to 30 think-
ers (for reasons of space) and that we made a deliberate choice to focus on individ-
ual authors rather than specific articles, schools of thought, or approaches. Our basic 
criteria for inclusion were that an author:
	1.	 Explicitly identified themselves with one or more of the major traditions in sys-
tems thinking, by citing the works of previous authors within those traditions 
and/or working directly with earlier thinkers
	2.	 Advanced systems concepts through their work and/or advanced another field 
through their application of systems concepts
	3.	 Expressed their ideas in print
The first criterion is the most important. It required us to be explicit about our 
definition of ‘systems traditions’. Initially, we took two major schools of thought as 
our starting point – general systems theory (GST) and cybernetics. Each has a single 
figure who can be identified as its founder (Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Norbert 
Wiener, respectively), as well as a number of others who made significant contribu-
tions to the field; each also has a clear historical point of creation as an explicit 
movement (the founding of the Society for General Systems Research in 1956 and 
the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics, 1946–1953).
There are few bodies of thought within systems thinking that cannot be explicitly 
traced back to one or both of these traditions. There are two exceptions to this, how-
ever. First, systems engineering, which essentially arose independently of general 
systems theory; however it later took on much of GST’s language. Second, system 
dynamics, which despite its intellectual similarity to cybernetics (with its focus on 
feedback loops), does not pay any direct homage to that field in its official histories 
(e.g. Forrester 2007) – however it too has gradually taken on much of the concerns 
and language of both cybernetics and GST.
Introduction to the First Edition

xv
We see complexity theory as falling within our first criterion, with its strong links 
both to cybernetics and GST (as well as other sources); but operational research, 
with its somewhat different intellectual tradition, as falling outside of it.
The second criterion is intended to be relatively loose, simply stating our inten-
tion that the author should have developed the field of systems thinking, or applied 
systems thinking to another field in such an innovative way that that field has been 
significantly advanced. We take ‘advance’ to imply a significant contribution to the 
body of knowledge. With this criterion, we are explicitly excluding those who have 
used systems concepts in their work, often excellently and in very interesting ways, 
but have not fed back into the academic field. It is fair to say that the majority of 
those who have made significant contributions to systems thinking have simultane-
ously applied their contributions to other fields, although in a small number of cases 
the authors were sufficiently strongly self-identified with systems thinking (or one 
of its parts) that their main contribution has largely been within systems thinking.
The third criterion is intended to allow us only to include those who have explic-
itly described their contribution in a printed form. This does not necessarily include 
only academics – there are a number of practitioners on our list who participated in 
the various intellectual communities around systems thinking but wrote their ideas 
in a form others could use. It certainly does not include only academic-style writing: 
many of the authors we found most helpful are those who have written for a more 
popular audience. However, it does exclude those practitioners who have not pub-
lished their work.
Inclusions and Exclusions
Some issues in boundary setting arise from the choices discussed above and are 
worth exploring in further detail. First, our identified starting point of systems think-
ing as the explicit statements of GST and cybernetics by von Bertalanffy and Wiener, 
inevitably excludes those who preceded those authors. There are a number of impor-
tant thinkers from the first half of the twentieth century who take an explicitly holis-
tic line, in some cases explicitly discussing their work in terms of systems, such as 
Alexander Bogdanov and Jan Smuts; and philosophers who have influenced a num-
ber of major systems thinkers, such as John Dewey and Alfred North Whitehead. 
The same is true of thinkers from an earlier age, such as Aristotle (who first said that 
“the whole is greater than the sum of the parts”) and Heraclitus. While all might be 
considered relevant, none of these thinkers are part of the tradition that is explicitly 
self-identified as systems thinking.
A trickier issue arises with Gestalt psychology with its emphasis on the relation-
ship between wholes and parts; and indeed key people within the Gestalt movement, 
such as Wolfgang Köhler, were present at some of the Macy conferences. 
Nonetheless, given that Gestalt psychology arose prior to the founding of systems 
thinking, it is best thought of as a strongly-related precursor rather than explicitly 
part of the systems ‘movement’. However, we have made a different choice in the 
Introduction to the First Edition

xvi
case of the Gestalt-influenced thinker Kurt Lewin who was the originator of a num-
ber of ideas of great relevance to systems thinking including action research, the 
popular use of the term ‘feedback’, the founding of the field of organisational devel-
opment, and (via Kolb) the concept of learning as a cyclical process.
A gap in this book is the absence of practitioners who have not chosen to describe 
their methods, ideas or applications in written form. This is not to say that such 
practitioners do not advance the discipline, given that much work within systems 
thinking is grounded in the cyclical relationship between theory and practice, but 
our focus in this book is on systems thinking, as expressed in writing.
Two other under-represented groups in our list of thinkers are women and those 
from outside of the Anglo-American tradition. We regret the lack of many women 
in this book (only three of our 30 thinkers are female), but this sadly reflects the 
history of systems thinking as a discipline, which as with many scientific disciplines 
has been male-dominated. We made a decision not to hide this fact by skewing our 
criteria to include more female writers. There are many women currently doing 
highly important work in systems thinking, so it is to be hoped that this balance may 
be different in future work.
Most of our thinkers are either from North America or Europe, and indeed most 
of the mainland European thinkers have worked in North America (many as part of 
the large migration by academics from central Europe in the 1930s and 1940s due 
to Nazi persecution and post-war hardship). Our stance partly reflects our need (due 
to our own limitations) for authors to have written or been translated into English, 
but also reflects the intellectual tradition we have considered, which largely arose in 
the USA with a significant British connection. There are many interesting systemic 
thinkers from outside this group, and the systems thinking traditions we discuss 
would be richer for hearing their voices, but this is not something we have been able 
to do in this work.
It is striking to compare our choices to those of others who have attempted a 
similar task, such as the three collections of papers edited by Emery (1969), Beishon 
and Peters (1972) and Midgley (2003). From their statements and lists of authors, 
we can see a fairly similar set of choices to those we have made. The historical 
points at which they start their collections are similar to ours and to each other – 
Emery includes a paper by Köhler (on open and closed systems) and Midgley 
includes an extract from Bogdanov’s work on ‘tektology’ (and argues strongly in 
his introduction that it has as much right to appear there as von Bertalanffy’s work, 
despite Bogdanov’s weaker influence on the later systems thinking tradition); but 
otherwise the earliest major authors in each are von Bertalanffy and Wiener. Midgley 
(2003, p. xix) makes the useful point that “I do not believe it is possible to present a 
‘neutral’ account of either systems thinking or its history … interpretation is inevi-
table, and what appears central or peripheral depends on the purposes and assump-
tions of the person or people constructing the historical narrative”.
An important distinction in our approach from the collections of papers men-
tioned above is that we have focused on people rather than ideas or papers. This has 
led to some significant choices. We have included those with especially interesting 
lives, and in a few cases have not included influential authors whose lives we have 
Introduction to the First Edition

xvii
found less interesting. This has led us to omit certain areas important to the history 
of systems thinking which were not developed by clearly identifiable individuals, 
such as systems engineering. In a number of cases authors produced some of their 
most well-known works in collaboration with another author but we have chosen to 
focus on one of the authors – thus we write about Humberto Maturana but not 
Francisco Varela, about Howard Odum but not Eugene Odum, and about Eric Trist 
but not Fred Emery. A different book would include all of these authors.
There are many other authors we could have included in this book as well as 
those already mentioned, and have not, sometimes for the reasons discussed above 
but also simply for lack of space. These include Bela Banathy, Fritjof Capra, Bob 
Flood, Adam Kahane, David Kolb, Joanna Macy, James G. Miller, John Mingers, 
Ian Mitroff, Talcott Parsons, Gordon Pask, Anatol Rapoport and Ralph Stacey.
Groupings
We have grouped the thirty authors into seven categories (see Fig. 0.1). To some 
extent these groups exist simply as a device to make the book more manageable to 
read and understand. However they also reflect what to us are coherent groupings of 
authors. Some of them might be considered explicit schools of thought (such as 
system dynamics), while others group authors with connected ideas (such as learn-
ing systems).
The choices we have made are intended to show clear connections between 
authors, and a few are deliberately unusual to provoke thought. The groupings were

Introduction to the First Edition

xviii
created from the starting point of our chosen authors, rather than schools of thought, 
and thus they do not represent a comprehensive guide to a particular school of 
thought (for example, there are many more thinkers who have contributed to general 
systems theory than the four we cover). The seven groupings are: early cybernetics, 
general systems theory, system dynamics, soft & critical systems, later cybernetics, 
complexity theory, and learning systems, and we will briefly introduce each in turn.
Early cybernetics is a highly influential approach based on the concepts of feed-
back and information, and the parallels between human and machine behaviour, 
applying these ideas to a wide range of disciplines. This grouping contains some of 
the pioneers who shaped the field of cybernetics (Gregory Bateson, Norbert Wiener, 
Warren McCulloch, Margaret Mead and Ross Ashby). Most of them were core par-
ticipants in the Macy Conferences on Cybernetics (Ashby was not at most of these 
conferences, but his publication of the first textbook in the field had a deep influ-
ence). While Norbert Wiener coined the term ‘cybernetics’, and in many ways 
founded the field, we have chosen to write first about Gregory Bateson, as he repre-
sents the first flowering of cybernetics at its richest and broadest.
General systems theory is concerned with issues of open systems, emergence, 
boundary and hierarchy. The general systems movement championed interdiscipli-
narity long before it was widespread, with its goal of ‘science in the service of 
humanity’. Our grouping contains four thinkers, two of whom can rightly be said to 
be the founders of general systems (Ludwig von Bertalanffy and Kenneth Boulding) 
and two slightly later thinkers who explicitly identified their work as being within 
general systems (Geoffrey Vickers and Howard Odum).
System dynamics focuses on computer modelling of systems with a high degree 
of feedback and circularity. It has its origins largely in the work of one man, Jay 
Forrester, and our grouping includes Forrester along with two of his students who 
have had enormous influence, Donella Meadows and Peter Senge. System dynamics 
is hugely important and interesting, but has been historically slightly isolated from 
other systems approaches; this section of the book shows some of the similarities 
and differences between system dynamics and other approaches.
Soft and critical systems is a highly applied approach that arises from the use of 
techniques from systems engineering and operational research to human systems, 
especially in management and public policy, and a sense of dissatisfaction with the 
capacity of those techniques to take account of the reality of human systems. These 
experiences led the thinkers in this section (C. West Churchman, Russell Ackoff, 
Peter Checkland, Werner Ulrich and Mike Jackson) to create a new set of method-
ologies that explicitly considered issues such as multiple perspectives, power and 
intractable problems with no simple solutions.
Later cybernetics is a grouping of several different authors who all have their 
roots in the work discussed in the ‘early cybernetics’ grouping, and thus form a 
second generation of cyberneticians, but who have each taken that work in some-
what different directions. The thinkers in this group are Heinz von Foerster, Stafford 
Beer, Humberto Maturana, Niklas Luhmann and Paul Watzlawick. There is a con-
siderable overlap with the ‘second-order cybernetics’ approach described by Heinz 
von Foerster – which takes into account the observer as well as the observed – but 
Introduction to the First Edition

xix
not all of the thinkers in this group sit neatly into that approach. All the thinkers in 
the group fall within the category we have elsewhere described as ‘soft cybernetics’, 
but so do some of the early cybernetics group, so we have chosen to describe this 
group in purely historical terms.
Complexity theory is an approach to the modelling of highly complicated and 
interconnected systems using techniques derived from the physical sciences, with a 
focus on self-organisation, emergence and nonlinearity. It takes inspiration both 
from general systems theory and cybernetics. Our grouping contains three scientists 
who have done crucial work in developing this approach to complex systems: Ilya 
Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman and James Lovelock. This grouping is slightly wider 
than complexity science, an approach initially developed at the Santa Fé Institute 
(where Kauffman is based); Prigogine and Lovelock take a somewhat similar 
approach in terms of computer modelling of complex systems and a focus on self-
organisation, but the three thinkers developed their work largely independently of 
each other.
Learning systems is a broad group of thinkers with a common focus on the way 
people learn and the systems within which they learn. It begins with the important 
work of Kurt Lewin, who died young in the very early days of systems thinking but 
had a huge influence upon its developing work. The grouping continues with three 
thinkers who are strongly part of Lewin’s tradition (as well as being influenced by 
other systems work) – Eric Trist, Chris Argyris and Donald Schön. The group ends 
with Mary Catherine Bateson, who presents one of the most refined and complete 
examples of a unified systems approach to learning and to life.

Introduction to the Second Edition
You hold in your hand (or have on your screen) a collective love letter to some of 
the most remarkable people in academia and professional practice over the past 
century. Authoring the first edition of the book was an incredible privilege and joy 
in a long project that took around 7 years (see the Afterword at the back of this book, 
which is unchanged from the first edition). Ten years have passed since the original 
edition, and the success of the Masters programme which it supported has created 
the opportunity to update and refine our work. We have spent about a year on this 
second edition, and it has been just as much of a joy and a privilege to read more 
about these thinkers. The goals of the book have always been both to introduce these 
30 people to a wider audience and to encourage readers to find the works of these 
thinkers and read them in the originals.
I am more convinced than ever of the utter necessity of systems thinking to our 
world at this time. As I write this, the world is finally beginning to wake up to the 
climate emergency, finally listening to courageous young people on climate strikes 
and longer-established (but often ignored) climate scientists; yet real action to deal 
with the climate emergency is not yet happening. Meanwhile, the impact of the 
2008 financial crash still remains unresolved in many parts of the world and has 
metastasised in all too many places into nationalism and autocracy, even in liberal 
democracies long free of such menaces. Mobile communications with their ubiqui-
tous information and the nascent ‘Internet of Things’ are a great boon, but also risk 
creating societies where citizens’ every actions are tracked, leading to phenomena 
such as what Zuboff (2019) calls ‘surveillance capitalism’.
Many more examples could be given of issues in society which are characterised 
by deeply interconnected and highly complex amalgams of people, cultures, organ-
isations, technology, politics and physical environment. The thinkers in this book, if 
taken seriously, between them have much to offer to those seeking an understanding 
of these difficult and complex issues in the world.
The second edition of this book is extensively revised from the first edition. We 
have studied each chapter thoroughly and amended it in the light of new scholarship 
about the thinkers and their work. My intention was to read, at least briefly, every 
article or book written about our thinkers since the publication of the original book 

xxii
(so roughly the period from 2008, when we handed over the book to the publisher, 
until 2019). There have been many such sources. First, many of our thinkers are still 
alive and writing new material. In almost all cases, there has been significant use of 
the thinkers’ ideas by other authors, sometimes in ways that simply illustrate their 
importance and sometimes in ways that illuminate the original writings consider-
ably. In several cases, there have been full-length biographies of the thinkers (includ-
ing Warren McCulloch, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Kenneth Boulding and Eric Trist) 
or books which discuss one or more of our thinkers at length (such as Kline 2015). 
These have provided new perspectives and insights into our thinkers’ lives and 
ideas. Then, there have been anniversary conferences with published proceedings, 
such as the 50th anniversary of Norbert Wiener’s death in 2014 and the 100th birth-
day celebrations of James Lovelock in 2019. And lastly, sadly, three thinkers have 
died since the first edition was completed (Chris Argyris, Russell Ackoff and Jay 
Forrester), giving rise to new resources through obituaries and the like.
Taking all these resources together, we have revised the ‘narrative’ parts of each 
chapter (describing the life and work of the thinkers, as opposed to extracts from 
their work). The original chapters were crafted with care through numerous drafts, 
so we have tried to preserve the integrity of each. However, with the perspective of 
time and continuing scholarship, the balance of what is most significant or relevant 
has sometimes changed, leading us to remove small passages that have become less 
relevant, while adding new insights, quotes and developments. The publisher 
(Springer) kindly agreed to let us increase the length of the book a little, but not by 
a huge amount, so we have sought to prune as well as grow the chapters.
There are things that in a different kind of revision we might have amended but 
have chosen not to change here. We have left intact the existing readings from the 
thinkers – we considered each one carefully, and all represent the authors well.
We have also not changed the list of thinkers discussed in the book. We thought 
long and hard about this issue. I have frequently been asked at conferences why 
particular authors were not included, sometimes with considerable passion. In the 
introduction to the first edition, we mentioned a number of names who could have 
been included and would stand by all these. The authors we most often have been 
asked to add, or ourselves regret not including, are Joanna Macy, Gordon Pask, Bela 
Banathy, Edgar Morin, Donald Mackay and Ken Wilber. However, to incorporate 
further authors would have meant increasing the book significantly, potentially 
unbalancing the groupings of authors, and also a considerable amount of work, so 
we decided not to do so in this edition.
We also decided not to remove any of the authors from those in the first edition. 
We gave our rationale in the previous introduction as to why we included our origi-
nal authors. This rationale still stands good and still applies to all included. In each 
case, when reading the original chapter, we asked ourselves whether the author still 
had a place in the book and were very clear that this was the case for all 30 authors. 
All of the authors are important, and some are extremely relevant today, some even 
more so than when they first wrote, while some are not widely enough read (such as 
the work of Geoffrey Vickers and Donald Schön); others are more of their time and 
introduced important ideas which others have built upon.
Introduction to the Second Edition

Ten years have passed since the authorship of the original chapters, and as I have 
conducted most of the revision of the chapters, it may be helpful to know of my 
influences since that time. These have been fourfold.
First, I have spent much of the time focused on questions of information – the 
way in which multiple disciplines understand and conceptualise information differ-
ently. This has led to a number of academic conferences and workshops, an edited 
book (Ramage and Chapman 2011) and various special issues of journals.
Second, I spent more than 4 years as editor in chief of the long-established jour-
nal Kybernetes (working with three coeditors from The OU), which we had already 
cited a number of times in the book, and in that capacity spent a lot of time thinking 
about cybernetics and attending conferences of the American Society for 
Cybernetics.
Third, I have more recently been concerned with critical approaches to informa-
tional phenomena, working closely with colleagues who have a deep concern for the 
interaction between information technologies and race, gender and class (among 
other factors).
And fourth, I have written a number of papers which built on the scholarship that 
Karen and I gathered together for this book, and this has expanded my thinking 
about a number of the authors discussed here (Ramage 2009; Ramage 2011; Ramage 
and Shipp 2012; Ramage and Bissell 2015; Ramage 2017).
Each of these strands can be seen in places in the revisions of the chapters. We 
note two insights in particular. First, the multidisciplinary concept of information 
clearly has its roots in cybernetics but can be said to split into two broad forms 
(Ramage 2011) – a ‘soft’ view of information which emphasises the role of mean-
ing and the observer, arising from Bateson’s work, and a ‘hard’ view of information 
which treats information as a quasi-physical object removed from context, arising 
from Wiener’s work. Second, there are striking similarities in the way that the use 
of diagrams developed in several areas of systems thinking, in each of which, there 
was a ‘two-stage shift of technological to human modelling, and mathematical to 
qualitative modelling’ (Ramage and Shipp 2012, p.122), Forrester’s system dynam-
ics, Beer’s management cybernetics, Odum’s systems ecology diagrams and the 
diagrams used to teach systems thinking for more than 40 years at our own base, 
The Open University.
So I have learnt much about the people and ideas in the book since its original 
publication. I remain captivated by some of the images that the authors introduced 
me to, from Ilya Prigogine’s whirlpool of water (a dissipative structure) when emp-
tying a bathtub to the idea that the crashing of waves at the seashore represents not 
their culmination but their death, from Stafford Beer (which inspired the image on 
the cover of this edition). I hope you find your own insights in this book.
For many years, editorials of the journal Systems Practice (now Systemic Practice 
and Action Research) would end with the phrase ‘I wish you good systems prac-
tice’. We might close by wishing the reader of this second edition something simi-
lar – I wish you good systems thinking.
Lastly, I wish to add to the acknowledgements from the first edition. Thanks to 
those who have helped in the production of this edition at The Open University,

Chapter 1
Gregory Bateson
Gregory Bateson, anthropologist and philosopher, was a deeply original thinker 
who crossed multiple disciplines, always sitting on the edge between them. He 
began only late in life to attempt to synthesise his work, and eventually described 
his intellectual journey as: “from biology at the beginning, into anthropology, into 
systems of ideas, pathologies of systems of ideas, and then to systems of ideas 
which are how we all try and live together – and ‘we all’ includes the animals and 
the plants as well as you and me” (G.  Bateson speaking in 1976, quoted in 
N. Bateson 2011).
He was perhaps the most wide-ranging and profound thinker in early cybernet-
ics, and his work provides a foundation for much of the important work that fol-
lowed, and a still-challenging insight into the problems of the world today. 
Practically every discussion of Bateson’s work contains a different list of his disci-
plinary interests. He worked at one time or another in zoology, anthropology, cyber-
netics, communications theory, psychiatry, ethology (animal behaviour) and 
philosophy; and he also had a strong impact on family therapy, the environmental 
movement and organisational theory. His contribution to each of these fields was 
profound, but he was always ready to move on – as one biographer put it, he “posted 
himself to the margins of not one, but multiple disciplines from which he secluded 
and then absented himself” (Lipset 2005, p. 911).
Although he was an outsider in terms of disciplinary allegiance, he was part of a 
formidable intellectual dynasty. His grandfather, William Bateson, was a modernis-
ing Master of St Johns College, Cambridge. His father, also William, was a key 
early geneticist, who coined the word ‘genetics’ and brought the concepts of Gregor 
Mendel to wider attention. Gregory Bateson was married for more than a decade to 
the celebrated anthropologist Margaret Mead. Two of his daughters, by different 
mothers, Mary Catherine Bateson and Nora Bateson, have themselves become well-­
respected systems thinkers, drawing on their father’s life and legacy as well as going 
beyond his ideas (M. C. Bateson 2004; N. Bateson 2016).

Bateson’s relationship with his father was not an easy one – Gregory was William 
Bateson’s youngest son but both his elder brothers died (one in the First World War, 
the other through suicide) so that the considerable weight of his father’s expecta-
tions fell upon Gregory. He inherited a deep intellectual self-confidence as well as 
an admiration for influential outsiders (such as William Blake, a hero of both father 
and son). Toulmin (1984, p. 3) summarises this background as follows:
His strong physical presence – his great height and eagle profile – and the blend of intel-
lectual confidence and personal diffidence that he inherited from the Cambridge tradition of 
natural science (his father, William Bateson, was a founder of modern genetics) gave him 
the personal and intellectual power to move in quietly on virtually any debate and reshape 
it according to his own perspective. With his biological background, he was fully aware of 
current scientific orthodoxy, but he treated it as a theme on which to compose personal 
variations, and these, while sometimes eccentric, illuminated whatever they touched.
Bateson was born in 1904 in Cambridge and died in 1980 in San Francisco. His 
list of institutional affiliations is long, including St Johns College (Cambridge 
University), the University of California Medical School, the Veteran’s 
Administration Hospital in Palo Alto (California), the Oceanic Institute (Hawaii) 
and the University of California at Santa Cruz. He also held many visiting profes-
sorships at other institutions. His research was carried out in a wide variety of con-
texts – as an anthropologist, with peoples in New Guinea and Bali; during the war, 
with the US Office of Strategic Services (forerunner to the CIA); with psychiatric 
patients; with porpoises and dolphins; and on environmental issues.
However, perhaps Bateson’s strongest ‘institutional’ affiliation was to a different 
form of group: the Macy conferences on cybernetics, discussed in the chapters on 
Wiener and McCulloch. He was a member of the core group at these conferences, 
attending all ten conferences in the series and having a strong influence (along with 
Margaret Mead) as a social scientist who took seriously the concept of cybernetics 
as it unfolded. He had independently developed the concept of positive feedback, 
but the idea of negative feedback, and the general framework of cybernetic ideas, 
was of great importance to him. He later referred to the Macy conferences as “one 
of the great events of my life” (quoted by Brockman 2004) and there are frequent 
references to cybernetics in most of his subsequent writings.
Bateson’s contributions to knowledge are almost as hard to summarise as his 
disciplinary or institutional connections. Some of these can be found in specific 
ideas, which have been important in various fields: the anthropological concept of 
schismogenesis (positive feedback loops leading to increasing destruction of rela-
tionships); the psychotherapeutic concept of the double bind (patterns of interaction 
where people are required to behave in two mutually incompatible ways simultane-
ously); and the concept of levels of learning (observing that some forms of learning 
are at a higher logical level than others, and form various ways of learning how 
to learn).
To these we can add ideas which are widely quoted, such as his definition of 
information as the “difference that makes a difference” (G. Bateson 1972, p. 453) 
and his use of the phrase (borrowed from Alfred Korzybski) that “the map is not the 
territory” (G. Bateson 1972, p. 449). As Mead (1977, p. 171) summarised these

ideas, they “have all been about relationships between individuals or groups of indi-
viduals, elaborated and stylized by experience or culture”. These are important 
ideas, and they have had a significant impact – the concept of the double bind was 
the foundation for the field of family systems therapy, and that of levels of learning 
has directly contributed to organisational learning via the work of Argyris and Schön.
Bateson’s understanding of information in particular treats it as a form of 
meaning-­creation by human beings, rather than quasi-physical process, and is at the 
heart of a form of ‘soft cybernetics’ (Ramage 2009) that is somewhat different from 
the work on second-order cybernetics discussed later in this book. The phrase ‘the 
difference that makes a difference’ has inspired many subsequent thinkers about the 
nature of information (e.g. Hofkirchner 2011; Ramage and Chapman 2011).
However, if we were to take these concepts alone as an indicator of Bateson’s 
thinking or his impact, we would lose most of its essence. In the final decade of his 
life, Bateson came to realise that in fact all his ideas were closely linked – that he 
“had not been merely blundering from field to field but had been struggling to 
develop a way of thinking that would be transferable, systematically, from one 
subject matter to another” (M. C. Bateson 2004, p. 50). In 1970, he gave the annual 
Korzybski lecture under the title “Form, Substance and Difference”. This forms the 
most concise description of his thought as a whole, and our extract below is taken 
from it. Later he wrote that in preparing this lecture (G. Bateson 1972, p. xvi):
I found that in my work with primitive peoples, schizophrenia, biological symmetry, and in 
my discontent with the conventional theories of evolution and learning, I had identified a 
widely scattered set of bench marks or points of reference from which a new scientific ter-
ritory could be defined.
What was the nature of this new scientific territory? It had several aspects, 
summed up in his conception of an “ecology of mind”:
	1.	 He was concerned with issues of epistemology, which for him had become cor-
rupted by centuries of Cartesian dualism with its split between the physical and 
the mental, and which needed to be reformed around the unity of physical and 
mental processes.
	2.	 Secondly, Bateson was concerned with issues of cognition, which he viewed as 
a fundamental process in nature, spread across animals as much as humans, and 
even in humans not confined to events occurring in the brain.
	3.	 Lastly, he was concerned with the nature of relationship, of the patterns between 
mental and physical processes in different parts of nature. In referring to this as 
an ecology, he was writing as a biologist, and using the term to refer to a set of 
interacting entities in an environment, rather than the popular use of ecology to 
refer to issues around the survival of the natural environment.
This last aspect was summed up in his phrase “the pattern which connects”. In 
his book Mind and Nature (G. Bateson 1979) this concept was used to explore the 
patterns which connect all living creatures – that is, the relationship between their 
similarities and differences. This pattern, he observed, has two major features – first, 
it is a ‘metapattern’, that is to say a pattern of patterns, which exists at a higher level

of abstraction than simply the immediate similarities and differences between spe-
cies; and second, it is dynamic rather than static – the relationships are constantly 
changing, forming “a dance of interacting parts only secondarily pegged down by 
various sorts of physical limits” (G. Bateson 1979, p. 13). As an illustration of the 
importance of relationships, he liked when giving talks to ask audiences to look at 
their hands and observe that as well as having five fingers, they could just as well be 
said to have four relations between fingers, and that this perspective was just as use-
ful as the conventional one.
The range of different concepts that Bateson was able to draw patterns between 
in this way was quite dizzying, as described by Keesing (1974, p. 370): “What form 
of madness is it to see as similarly pattern the axial symmetry of marine organisms 
and Iatmul initiatory grades, or patterns of armament races and falling in love, or 
leaves and sentences, or mother-child interactions and a muddled telephone 
exchange, or the play of otters and Russell’s Theory of Logical Types?” All these 
situations were fundamental to Bateson’s interests – but so were the work of William 
Blake, the biblical Book of Job, the behaviour of people with schizophrenia, and the 
nature of thought and mind. He defied categories – although a lifelong atheist, his 
final work, completed posthumously by his daughter, was an investigation in the 
nature of spirituality and its connection to the natural world (Bateson and 
Bateson 1987).
Bateson’s eclectic mix of interests and his marginality led to a curious phenom-
enon during his life which has continued posthumously – he has been both lionized 
and ignored. Individual parts of his writing have had considerable impact upon a 
range of fields, but the whole pattern of his work has taken a long time to be under-
stood and appreciated. There are some signs that this is happening but it is still a 
work in progress. As one of his former colleagues argued in a celebratory confer-
ence on his legacy: “The professionalization of academia has not helped spread 
Bateson’s message. He had no patience for revisionists and his multidimensional 
mind does not fit into any discipline.” (Wilder 2013)
He was a teacher of many, and many former colleagues and students took him to 
their heart: his colleagues in the Palo Alto group where double-bind theory was 
developed; students at the New School in New York at the University of Santa Cruz 
in California; visitors to the Esalen Institute where he spent his final years; and 
many others. One of his students, later a distinguished improvisational violinist, 
wrote that:
Gregory taught by encouragement. Much of his subject matter – how pathology works, 
whether at an interpersonal level or at the level of human beings wrecking their own envi-
ronment – was not cheerful, but as a person and teacher he was full of jokes and stories. 
Gregory loved to laugh, that is probably the first thing I noticed about him. He encouraged 
me to keep exploring as an artist, he encouraged other students to be scientists and dig deep 
with good questions, he encouraged all of us to write and think. He did not say that these 
were futile gestures in the face of species doom. (Nachmanovitch 2013, p. 1444)
In the final decade of his life, Bateson’s work took on a new focus. In 1968, 
Bateson wrote that “it may well be that consciousness contains systematic distor-
tions of view which, when implemented by modern technology, become destructive

of the balances between man, his society, and his ecosystem” (G. Bateson 1972, 
p.  440). This formed the basis of a conference he organised on the “Effects of 
Conscious Purpose on Human Adaptation” (M. C. Bateson 1972). Through this 
conference, Bateson came to the conclusion that the danger of environmental 
destruction – the risks of which were by then already apparent – arose from the 
deep-seated Western worldview that it is possible to make a separation between the 
organism, or species, and its environment.
This is a call to a new form of epistemology, which understands humanity within 
its environment, and Bateson’s answer to it lay within his conception of an ecology 
of mind. As Mary Catherine Bateson (2000, p. xiv) wrote, “Bateson was haunted in 
his last years by a sense of urgency, a sense that the narrow definition of human 
purposes, reinforced by technology, would lead to irreversible disasters, and that 
only a better epistemology could save us”. Perhaps it is only now, as ecological 
disaster becomes more and more pressing, that Bateson’s originality and impor-
tance can begin to be fully appreciated.

We can now say – or at any rate, can begin to say – what we think a mind is. In 
the next 20 years there will be other ways of saying it and, because the discoveries 
are new, I can only give you my personal version. The old versions are surely wrong, 
but which of the revised pictures will survive, we do not know.
Let us start from the evolutionary side. It is now empirically clear that Darwinian 
evolutionary theory contained a very great error in its identification of the unit of 
survival under natural selection. The unit which was believed to be crucial and 
around which the theory was set up was either the breeding individual or the family 
line or the subspecies or some similar homogeneous set of conspecifics. Now I sug-
gest that the last 100 years have demonstrated empirically that if an organism or 
aggregate of organisms sets to work with a focus on its own survival and thinks that 
that is the way to select its adaptive moves, its “progress” ends up with a destroyed 
environment. If the organism ends up destroying its environment, it has in fact 
destroyed itself. And we may very easily see this process carried to its ultimate 
reductio ad absurdum in the next 20 years. The unit of survival is not the breeding 
organism, or the family line, or the society.
The old unit has already been partly corrected by the population geneticists. 
They have insisted that the evolutionary unit is, in fact, not homogeneous. A wild 
population of any species consists always of individuals whose genetic constitution 
varies widely. In other words, potentiality and readiness for change is already built

into the survival unit. The heterogeneity of the wild population is already one-half 
of that trial-and-error system which is necessary for dealing with environment.
The artificially homogenized populations of man’s domestic animals and plants 
are scarcely fit for survival.
And today a further correction of the unit is necessary. The flexible environment 
must also be included along with the flexible organism because, as I have already 
said, the organism which destroys its environment destroys itself. The unit of sur-
vival is a flexible organism-in-its-environment.
Now, let me leave evolution for a moment to consider what is the unit of mind. 
Let us go back to the map and the territory and ask: “What is it in the territory that 
gets onto the map?” We know the territory does not get onto the map. That is the 
central point about which we here are all agreed. Now, if the territory were uniform, 
nothing would get onto the map except its boundaries, which are the points at which 
it ceases to be uniform against some larger matrix. What gets onto the map, in fact, 
is difference, be it a difference in altitude, a difference in vegetation, a difference in 
population structure, difference in surface, or whatever. Differences are the things 
that get onto a map.
But what is a difference? A difference is a very peculiar and obscure concept. It 
is certainly not a thing or an event. This piece of paper is different from the wood of 
this lectern. There are many differences between them – of color, texture, shape, etc. 
But if we start to ask about the localization of those differences, we get into trouble. 
Obviously the difference between the paper and the wood is not in the paper; it is 
obviously not in the wood; it is obviously not in the space between them, and it is 
obviously not in the time between them. (Difference which occurs across time is 
what we call “change”.)
A difference, then, is an abstract matter.
In the hard sciences, effects are, in general, caused by rather concrete conditions 
or events – impacts, forces, and so forth. But when you enter the world of commu-
nication, organization, etc., you leave behind that whole world in which effects are 
brought about by forces and impacts and energy exchange. You enter a world in 
which “effects” – and I am not sure one should still use the same word – are brought 
about by differences. That is, they are brought about by the sort of “thing” that gets 
onto the map from the territory. This is difference.
Difference travels from the wood and paper into my retina. It then gets picked up 
and worked on by this fancy piece of computing machinery in my head.
The whole energy relation is different. In the world of mind, nothing – that which 
is not – can be a cause. In the hard sciences, we ask for causes and we expect them 
to exist and be “real”. But remember that zero is different from one, and because 
zero is different from one, zero can be a cause in the psychological world, the world 
of communication. The letter which you do not write can get an angry reply; and the 
income tax form which you do not fill in can trigger the Internal Revenue boys into 
energetic action, because they, too, have their breakfast, lunch, tea, and dinner and 
can react with energy which they derive from their metabolism. The letter which 
never existed is no source of energy.
1  Gregory Bateson

It follows, of course, that we must change our whole way of thinking about men-
tal and communicational process. The ordinary analogies of energy theory which 
people borrow from the hard sciences to provide a conceptual frame upon which 
they try to build theories about psychology and behavior – that entire Procrustean 
structure – is non-sense. It is in error.
I suggest to you, now, that the word “idea”, in its most elementary sense, is syn-
onymous with “difference”. Kant, in the Critique of Judgment – if I understand him 
correctly – asserts that the most elementary aesthetic act is the selection of a fact. He 
argues that in a piece of chalk there are an infinite number of potential facts. The 
Ding an sich, the piece of chalk, can never enter into communication or mental 
process because of this infinitude. The sensory receptors cannot accept it; they filter 
it out. What they do is to select certain facts out of the piece of chalk, which then 
become, in modern terminology, information.
I suggest that Kant’s statement can be modified to say that there is an infinite 
number of differences around and within the piece of chalk. There are differences 
between the chalk and the rest of the universe, between the chalk and the sun or the 
moon. And within the piece of chalk, there is for every molecule an infinite number 
of differences between its location and the locations in which it might have been. Of 
this infinitude, we select a very limited number, which become information. In fact, 
what we mean by information – the elementary unit of information – is a difference 
which makes a difference, and it is able to make a difference because the neural 
pathways along which it travels and is continually transformed are themselves pro-
vided with energy. The pathways are ready to be triggered. We may even say that the 
question is already implicit in them.
There is, however, an important contrast between most of the pathways of infor-
mation inside the body and most of the pathways outside it. The differences between 
the paper and the wood are first transformed into differences in the propagation of 
light or sound, and travel in this form to my sensory end organs. The first part of 
their journey is energized in the ordinary hard-science way, from “behind”. But 
when the differences enter my body by triggering an end organ, this type of travel is 
replaced by travel which is energized at every step by the metabolic energy latent in 
the protoplasm which receives the difference, recreates or transforms it, and 
passes it on.
When I strike the head of a nail with a hammer, an impulse is transmitted to its 
point. But it is a semantic error, a misleading metaphor, to say that what travels in 
an axon is an “impulse”. It could correctly be called “news of a difference”.
Be that as it may, this contrast between internal and external pathways is not 
absolute. Exceptions occur on both sides of the line. Some external chains of events 
are energized by relays, and some chains of events internal to the body are energized 
from “behind”. Notably, the mechanical interaction of muscles can be used as a 
computational model.
In spite of these exceptions, it is still broadly true that the coding and transmis-
sion of differences outside the body is very different from the coding and transmis-
sion inside, and this difference must be mentioned because it can lead us into error.

We commonly think of the external “physical world” as somehow separate from an 
internal “mental world”. I believe that this division is based on the contrast in cod-
ing and transmission inside and outside the body.
The mental world – the mind – the world of information processing – is not lim-
ited by the skin.

Norbert Wiener
Norbert Wiener, founder of cybernetics, was a unique personality, a larger-than-life 
character famous for his very wide interests, extremely incisive mind and personal 
warmth, but also for his absent-mindedness, low self-esteem, and severe mood-­
swings. He was born in midwestern USA (Missouri) in 1894 to a Jewish family – 
his father had emigrated from Russia and his mother from Germany. Although the 
family were descended from the great twelfth century philosopher Moses 
Maimonides, their Jewishness was hidden from Wiener during his childhood, and 
he practised no religion until late in life.
Wiener was a child prodigy: he learned his alphabet at 18 months, obtained his 
bachelors degree at age 14 (from Tufts), and his PhD at age 18 (from Harvard). This 
was partly due to his exceptional ability, but also to the teaching regime of his father. 
Leo Wiener insisted on absolute correctness in all of young Norbert’s work, respond-
ing indifferently to correct answers but with great anger to errors. When Norbert 
Wiener married in 1926, it was with much relief at gaining freedom from his father 
(Conway and Siegelman 2005). After postdoctoral work in Europe and a number of 
short-term jobs, Wiener took up a post as an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) in 1919. He stayed at MIT for the rest of his life, becoming a 
full professor in 1931.
At MIT, Wiener was famous as a walker. He would walk around the corridors 
endlessly, talking to everyone he met (regardless of status or academic discipline), 
or absorbed in his own thoughts. His route was known as the Wienerweg (the 
German weg means walk or route) and he always took the path he insisted upon, 
regardless of what else was happening on it. Many anecdotes are told of Wiener’s 
insistence on sticking to his route and his absent-mindedness. In one story, recounted 
by Heims (1980) among others, Wiener was said to have met a student around mid-
day. After a long conversation, Wiener asked the student “can you tell me which 
way I was walking when we met – towards the canteen or away from it?” It was only 
the student’s response that enabled Wiener to remember whether or not he had yet 
had lunch.

12
He was a traveller in many other ways, “a man in near perpetual motion” 
(Conway and Siegelman 2005, p.82). He was a visiting scholar at a number of uni-
versities outside his country, mostly notably in Cambridge (England), Göttingen 
(Germany) and Mexico City – in the 1920s in particular his mathematical work was 
better appreciated in Europe than in the United States. He also made significant 
academic visits to China, Russia and India, with big impacts on scientific work in 
each country. Indeed he died on an international visit, of a heart attack on the steps 
of the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, in 1964.
He was also an intellectual traveller. Although he always saw himself as a math-
ematician, he forged close working links with biologists, physiologists, engineers 
and social scientists. Two of his most important collaborations were with biologists, 
Arturo Rosenbleuth and Warren McCulloch, and these led directly to the develop-
ment of cybernetics. He became well-known as a public figure for his scientific and 
social statements, and also had a poetic side. Writing on the concept of homeostasis 
(the self-regulation of living things) and its link to personal identity, Wiener 
remarked that “We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not 
stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves.” (Wiener 1954, p.96).
As a summary of Wiener’s personality, one of his biographers (who worked with 
him on his later mathematical work) describes him as:
Proverbially absent-minded, amusingly quirkish and idiosyncratic, he was fundamentally a 
gentle and humane soul. He was, however, given to recurrent manifestations of petulance, 
egoism, emotional instability, irrational insecurity and anxiety. His moods could swing 
from euphoria to gloom or vice versa on slight provocation (Masani 1990, p. 16)
Wiener’s work can be approximately split into three areas: his mathematical 
work, his work in cybernetics, and his work as a social and political commentator, 
and we shall discuss each of these in turn.
It is tempting to think of Wiener largely as a cybernetician. This was not his own 
self-image, and indeed for the majority of his time at MIT, he was attached to the 
Department of Mathematics. Wiener’s doctoral work was an extension of the logic 
of Bertrand Russell, then recently published in the great Principia Mathematica 
(1911). Following his doctorate, and still less than 20 years old, Wiener obtained a 
2 year fellowship from Harvard to do postdoctoral work in England and Germany, 
with some of the great minds of his time within pure mathematics – Russell himself 
and G.H. Hardy in Cambridge, and David Hilbert in Göttingen.
His key mathematical work, however, was in the field of applied mathematics, in 
which area he made many important contributions in the 1920s and 1930s. Perhaps 
most notable was his work in extending the theories of Lebesgue, Gibbs and Einstein 
to construct a technique for the statistical analysis of wave patterns, still known as 
the Wiener measure. He began this work in relation to Brownian motion (the semi-­
random movement of particles), leading ultimately to the statistical analysis of con-
trol systems and of communication which would be so important in the development 
of cybernetics. This work was also a major contributor to the theory of stochastic 
process, the foundation of modern probability theory.

Wiener’s contribution to the founding of cybernetics cannot be overestimated, 
although many others played a part as well. He introduced the word ‘cybernetics’, a 
coinage from the Greek kubernētēs, ‘steersman’ (the navigator of a ship), as a term 
for “the entire field of control and communication theory, whether in the machine or 
in the animal” (Wiener 1948, p. 11). The term was also intended to refer back to the 
‘governor’, the portion of an engine that ensures its effective operation. The word 
‘governor’ is derived from a Latinized form of kubernētēs, and indeed the French 
physicist André-Marie Ampère used the term cybernétique to describe a theory of 
government in the nineteenth century, although Wiener was unaware of this when 
he coined the modern term. Through the publication of his book Cybernetics (1948) 
and the more popularly-focused The Human Use of Human Beings (1950), the con-
cept became known rapidly to a wide public audience.
Wiener’s definition of cybernetics contains two important paired concepts. He 
was clear that control (in physiological and engineering terms) and communication 
were highly related phenomena, and could be expressed in terms of feedback. He 
wrote that control and communication “centred not around the technique of electri-
cal engineering but around the much more fundamental notion of the message, 
whether this should be transmitted by electrical, mechanical, or nervous means. The 
message is a discrete or continuous sequence of measurable events distributed in 
time” (Wiener 1948, p. 8). This concept of the message was crucial to the early 
development of communications theory, formalised on similar lines by Shannon 
and Weaver (1949), as was Wiener’s definition of information as “a measure of [the] 
degree of organization” of a system (Wiener 1948, p. 11) and the mathematical 
negative of the entropy of that system – which he referred to as negentropy. Wiener 
regarded negative feedback as much more important and useful than positive feed-
back, leading to stability and effective control – he saw positive feedback as danger-
ous and unstable.
The other pair of concepts in Wiener’s definition of cybernetics were the machine 
and the animal. In the 1930s and early 1940s, Wiener had conducted two major 
research projects – with Arturo Rosenbleuth on feedback within human and animal 
physiology; and with Julian Bigelow on the building of control systems for anti-­
aircraft weaponry (during World War II), again based on feedback principles. 
Rosenbleuth et al. (1943) put these projects together with the statement that “all 
purposeful behaviour may be considered to require negative feedback” (p. 19). This 
article is one of the most important early documents of cybernetics, along with an 
article by McCulloch and Pitts (1943), discussed in the chapter on McCulloch.
The parallel between human and machine activities was particularly important to 
the development of digital computers, then in its early stages. For this reason, cyber-
netics became rapidly identified in the public mind with these new technologies – 
hence the modern use of the term ‘cyber’ in compound words such as cyberspace. 
As Hayles (1999, p. 7) has written, “humans were to be seen primarily as information-­
processing entities who are essentially similar to intelligent machines”. The equat-
ing of human and machine activities was to prove extremely important in a wide 
range of disciplines (including computing, psychology and management among 
2  Norbert Wiener

14
others) but then was an almost entirely new concept, and it was the field of cybernet-
ics which played a big part in making the concept widely known.
Wiener’s final crucial contribution to cybernetics was his central role in the Macy 
conferences. This conference series – 10 two-day conferences from 1946 to 1953 – 
is frequently regarded as the founding event of cybernetics. Wiener was “the domi-
nant figure at the conference series, in his role as brilliant originator of ideas and 
enfant terrible” (Heims 1980, p. 206). These conferences, organised and chaired by 
Warren McCulloch, at first had the rather clumsy (if descriptive) title of the 
Conference for Circular Causal and Feedback Mechanisms in Biological and Social 
Systems. This title in itself expresses Wiener’s range of concerns very clearly, and 
his role as the ‘founding father’ of the conferences and the field. This role became 
even clearer at the sixth Macy conference (in 1949) when, at the suggestion of 
Heinz von Foerster, the title of the conference series was amended to the Conference 
on Cybernetics, a decision that moved Wiener greatly (von Foerster and Poersken 
2002, p. 136).
Von Foerster’s later introduction of the term ‘second-order cybernetics’ – the 
inclusion of the observer as a component of the cybernetic system under study – is 
often taken to exclude Wiener, to cast him on the ‘wrong’ side of a conceptual 
divide. This is not accurate, as a number of commentators have discussed. In a con-
versation with Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead (both participants in the Macy 
conferences), discussing an input-output model with a box that encloses the feed-
back loops of a cybernetic system, Brand (1976) observed that “the engineer is 
outside the box … and Wiener is inside the box” – that is, considering himself to be 
part of the system. Bernard-Weil (1994) has similarly argued that a number of the 
concepts key to second-order cybernetics, such as autonomy, dialogue and self-­
organization, can be found in Wiener’s work, albeit not as central concerns.
Wiener later quarrelled with McCulloch for personal reasons, and never spoke to 
him again despite both working at MIT. This split in the founders of cybernetics 
impacted profoundly upon the discipline, leading to a lack of integration between 
the approaches of Wiener (mathematical and largely focused on analogue commu-
nications phenomena) and those of McCulloch (neurophysiological and increas-
ingly focused on digital communications).
Wiener’s technical work in cybernetics continued long after the end of the Macy 
conferences. Although he refused to accept government or military research fund-
ing, he was involved in significant work on prosthetics (hearing aids and artificial 
arms) which fitted closely with his conception of cybernetics. However, in the final 
years of his life, he was most prominent in spreading the ideas of cybernetics and in 
warning about its impact upon society.
Wiener devoted much of his time in the last 20 years of his life to discussing the 
social and political implications of cybernetics, automation and the modern role of 
science. Although he had been actively involved in military research during World 
War II, he refused to co-operate with military work after the war, writing in a public 
statement that “the experience of the scientists who have worked on the atomic 
bomb has indicated that in any investigation of this kind the scientist ends by putting 
unlimited powers in the hands of the people whom he is least inclined to trust with

their use” (Wiener 1947). From that point on, Wiener also refused to receive funding 
from military (and later government) sources and to participate in conferences spon-
sored by the military.
This stance gained him considerable public respect, but was a difficult one to 
take in the US of the late 1940s and early 1950s – not least because he was based at 
MIT, the bulk of whose research was funded by the military in that time. In the 
American political purges of the early 1950s led by Senator Joseph McCarthy, 
Wiener was investigated by the FBI but his public profile as an independent intel-
lectual protected him and he escaped any persecution. He also used this profile to 
promulgate a view of cybernetics somewhat different from its public image:
Wiener promoted cybernetics as a civilian science and tried to control its image by distanc-
ing it from the military and from fringe groups. To him, it was a means to bridge engineer-
ing and biology for peaceful purposes, not a Cold War science, science fiction, nor a 
scientific fad. (Kline 2015, p.83)
Wiener also commented frequently on the effects of cybernetics upon the fabric 
of society. His book The Human Use of Human Beings (Wiener 1954), from which 
our reading is taken, describes the nature of the forthcoming cybernetic develop-
ments for a popular audience but also tempers them with a moral humanism, con-
tinuing his view that technologies can never be neutral. Some of his writing has 
become still more relevant due to technological advances. As Hill (2015, p.72) 
observes:
One of the technologies that worried Wiener most was the one he was most directly respon-
sible for creating, automation. Today we are hearing a striking amount of public discussion 
and debate about the impact automation is likely to have on employment. That intelligent 
machines might be used by owners and managers to eliminate or demean jobs on a massive 
scale was a prospect that Wiener spoke of often.
Notwithstanding his concerns about the impact of his work, Norbert Wiener’s 
contributions had a ground-breaking and long-lasting effect in a huge range of 
fields, both theoretical and practical. He was a true pioneer.

In giving the definition of Cybernetics in the original book (Wiener 1948), I 
classed communication and control together. Why did I do this? When I communi-
cate with another person, I impart a message to him, and when he communicates 
back with me he returns a related message which contains information primarily 
accessible to him and not to me. When I control the actions of another person, I

communicate a message to him, and although this message is in the imperative 
mood, the technique of communication does not differ from that of a message of 
fact. Furthermore, if my control is to be effective I must take cognizance of any 
messages from him which may indicate that the order is understood and has 
been obeyed.
It is the thesis of this book that society can only be understood through a study of 
the messages and the communication facilities which belong to it; and that in the 
future development of these messages and communication facilities, messages 
between man and machines, between machines and man, and between machine and 
machine, are destined to play an ever-increasing part.
When I give an order to a machine, the situation is not essentially different from 
that which arises when I give an order to a person. In other words, as far as my con-
sciousness goes I am aware of the order that has gone out and of the signal of com-
pliance that has come back. To me, personally, the fact that the signal in its 
intermediate stages has gone through a machine rather than through a person is 
irrelevant and does not in any case greatly change my relation to the signal. Thus the 
theory of control in engineering, whether human or animal or mechanical, is a chap-
ter in the theory of messages.
Naturally there are detailed differences in messages and in problems of control, 
not only between a living organism and a machine, but within each narrower class 
of beings. It is the purpose of Cybernetics to develop a language and techniques that 
will enable us indeed to attack the problem of control and communication in gen-
eral, but also to find the proper repertory of ideas and techniques to classify their 
particular manifestations under certain concepts.
The commands through which we exercise our control over our environment are 
a kind of information which we impart to it. Like any form of information, these 
commands are subject to disorganization in transit. They generally come through in 
less coherent fashion and certainly not more coherently than they were sent. In con-
trol and communication we are always fighting nature’s tendency to degrade the 
organized and to destroy the meaningful; the tendency, as Gibbs has shown us, for 
entropy to increase.
Much of this book concerns the limits of communication within and among indi-
viduals. Man is immersed in a world which he perceives through his sense organs. 
Information. that he receives is coordinated through his brain and nervous system 
until, after the proper process of storage, collation, and selection, it emerges through 
effector organs, generally his muscles. These in turn act on the external world, and 
also react on the central nervous system through receptor organs such as the end 
organs of kinaesthesia; and the information received by the kinaesthetic organs is 
combined with his already accumulated store of information to influence 
future action.
Information is a name for the content of what is exchanged with the outer world 
as we adjust to it, and make our adjustment felt upon it. The process of receiving and 
of using information is the process of our adjusting to the contingencies of the outer 
environment, and of our living effectively within that environment. The needs and 
the complexity of modern life make greater demands on this process of information

than ever before, and our press, our museums, our scientific laboratories, our 
­universities, our libraries and textbooks, are obliged to meet the needs of this pro-
cess or fail in their purpose. To live effectively is to live with adequate information. 
Thus, communication and control belong to the essence of man’s inner life, even as 
they belong to his life in society. […]
For any machine subject to a varied external environment to act effectively it is 
necessary that information concerning the results of its own action be furnished to 
it as part of the information on which it must continue to act. For example, if we are 
running an elevator, it is not enough to open the outside door because the orders we 
have given should make the elevator be at that door at the time we open it. It is 
important that the release for opening the door be dependent on the fact that the 
elevator is actually at the door; otherwise something might have detained it, and the 
passenger might step into the empty shaft. This control of a machine on the basis of 
its actual performance rather than its expected performance is known as feedback, 
and involves sensory members which are actuated by motor members and perform 
the function of tell-tales or monitors – that is, of elements which indicate a perfor-
mance. It is the function of these mechanisms to control the mechanical tendency 
toward disorganization; in other words, to produce a temporary and local reversal of 
the normal direction of entropy.
I have just mentioned the elevator as an example of feedback. There are other 
cases where the importance of feedback is even more apparent. For example, a gun-­
pointer takes information from his instruments of observation, and conveys it to the 
gun, so that the latter will point in such a direction that the missile will pass through 
the moving target at a certain time. Now, the gun itself must be used under all condi-
tions of weather. In some of these the grease is warm, and the gun swings easily and 
rapidly. Under other conditions the grease is frozen or mixed with sand, and the gun 
is slow to answer the orders given to it. If these orders are reinforced by an extra 
push given when the gun fails to respond easily to the orders and lags behind them, 
then the error of the gun-pointer will be decreased. To obtain a performance as uni-
form as possible, it is customary to put into the gun a control feedback element 
which reads the lag of the gun behind the position it should have according to the 
orders given it, and which uses this difference to give the gun an extra push.
It is true that precautions must be taken so that the push is not too hard, for if it 
is, the gun will swing past its proper position, and will have to be pulled back in a 
series of oscillations, which may well become wider and wider, and lead to a disas-
trous instability. If the feedback system is itself controlled – if, in other words, its 
own entropic tendencies are checked by still other controlling mechanisms – and 
kept within limits sufficiently stringent, this will not occur, and the existence of the 
feedback will increase the stability of performance of the gun. In other words, the 
performance will become less dependent on the frictional load; or what is the same 
thing, on the drag created by the stiffness of the grease.
Something very similar to this occurs in human action. If I pick up my cigar, I do 
not will to move any specific muscles. Indeed in many cases, I do not know what 
those muscles are. What I do is to turn into action a certain feedback mechanism; 
namely, a reflex in which the amount by which I have yet failed to pick up the cigar 
Reading from Wiener’s work

18
is turned into a new and increased order to the lagging muscles, whichever they may 
be. In this way, a fairly uniform voluntary command will enable the same task to be 
performed from widely varying initial positions, and irrespective of the decrease of 
contraction due to fatigue of the muscles. Similarly, when I drive a car, I do not fol-
low out a series of commands dependent simply on a mental image of the road and 
the task I am doing. If I find the car swerving too much to the right, that causes me 
to pull it to the left. This depends on the actual performance of the car, and not sim-
ply on the road; and it allows me to drive with nearly equal efficiency a light Austin 
or a heavy truck, without having formed separate habits for the driving of the 
two. […]
It is my thesis that the physical functioning of the living individual and the opera-
tion of some of the newer communication machines are precisely parallel in their 
analogous attempts to control entropy through feedback. Both of them have sensory 
receptors as one stage in their cycle of operation: that is, in both of them there exists 
a special apparatus for collecting information from the outer world at low energy 
levels, and for making it available in the operation of the individual or of the 
machine. In both cases these external messages are not taken neat, but through the 
internal transforming powers of the apparatus, whether it be alive or dead. The 
information is then turned into a new form available for the further stages of perfor-
mance. In both the animal and the machine this performance is made to be effective 
on the outer world. In both of them, their performed action on the outer world, and 
not merely their intended action, is reported back to the central regulatory appara-
tus. This complex of behaviour is ignored by the average man, and in particular does 
not play the role that it should in our habitual analysis of society; for just as indi-
vidual physical responses may be seen from this point of view, so may the organic 
responses of society itself. I do not mean that the sociologist is unaware of the 
existence and complex nature of communications in society, but until recently he 
has tended to overlook the extent to which they are the cement which binds its fabric 
together.

Warren McCulloch
Warren McCulloch resembled an Old Testament prophet – he had a long beard, 
bright and intense eyes, great personal warmth but also great passion. Indeed 
Gregory Bateson (1991, p. 225) describes him as “like Moses, a leader who could 
and did bring us to the edge of the promised land, where he himself could never 
enter”. His prophetic status can also be seen in a remark he frequently made, “Don’t 
bite my finger, look where I am pointing” (quoted by Seymour Papert, introduction 
to McCulloch 1965, p. xxviii).
In very many ways McCulloch was, as Dupuy (2000, p. 112) says, “the leading 
figure of the cybernetics movement”. Although the term ‘cybernetics’ was Wiener’s, 
it was McCulloch who organised and chaired the celebrated Macy conferences, 
McCulloch who published the first logical model of the mind, and McCulloch who 
supported and acted as mentor to many of the key later figures of cybernetics. Yet as 
Dupuy (p. 111) also says, “McCulloch seems almost to have faded from view: even 
in the fields in which he made lasting contributions, many of the heirs to his legacy 
are unaware even of his name”. By looking at McCulloch’s intellectual and personal 
stances, we can learn just as much about the origins of cybernetics as by looking at 
those of Wiener. As McCulloch (1974, p. 13) characterised the distinction between 
the two, “he was a roundhead; I, a cavalier!” (The analogy is with the competing 
sides in the English Civil War – McCulloch was describing himself as flamboyant 
and easy-going, while Wiener was intense and serious.)
Warren Sturgis McCulloch was born in 1898 in New Jersey, and died in 1969. 
Although American himself, his family had Scottish roots, and he saw this connec-
tion as important to his personality. His initial training was in philosophy, psychol-
ogy, logic and neurophysiology. It was in this last field – the study of the physiology 
of the nervous system – that he made his first contributions, working at Yale on the 
cerebral cortex of monkeys, and from 1941  in the psychiatry department of 
University of Illinois. His core intellectual concern was a philosophical one, which 
he described in an anecdote about a conversation with an early mentor at the 
age of 19:

22
That winter Rufus Jones called me in. “Warren,” said he, “what is thee going to be?” And I 
said, “I don’t know.” “And what is thee going to do?” And again I said, “I have no idea; but 
there is one question I would like to answer: What is a number, that a man may know it, and 
a man, that he may know a number?” He smiled and said, “Friend, thee will be busy as long 
as thee lives.” I have been. (McCulloch 1965, p. 2)
This was indeed McCulloch’s preoccupation for the whole of his life. He fre-
quently characterised his work as ‘experimental epistemology’, the study of the 
nature of knowledge through understanding the nature of the brain within which it 
resides. He conducted this work at Illinois for 10 years, moving to MIT’s Research 
Laboratory for Electronics in 1952. Although a close colleague of Wiener’s in the 
1940s while cybernetics was becoming established, the two had fallen out by the 
time he moved to MIT, and they did not work together there.
In other ways, McCulloch can be described as an early founder of cognitive sci-
ence and the related field of artificial intelligence. We can see this in two ways.
First, he did significant work on the relationship between machines and minds – 
the process that Dupuy (2000), in the title of his book, calls the “mechanization of 
mind”. A view that minds and machines are equivalent (now fairly commonplace 
but then a radical departure from a view of mind as something quite separate from 
physical reality) was at the core of McCulloch’s thinking. In 1955 he wrote that 
“everything we learn of organisms leads us to conclude not merely that they are 
analogous to machines, but that they are machines. Man-made machines are not 
brains, but brains are a very ill-understood variety of computing machines” 
(McCulloch 1965, p. 163).
Second, McCulloch, working with Walter Pitts, constructed a logical model of 
the nature of mental activity, and in particular the computational behaviour of the 
neuron (McCulloch and Pitts 1943). This article proved important in the history of 
artificial intelligence (AI) research, as one of the first computational models of 
mind, although AI research took a different path for many years and it was not until 
the 1980s that neural networks became an important area within AI. By the time AI 
research became prominent, cybernetics was not very much in vogue and the con-
nection with McCulloch was not stressed. John McCarthy, who coined the term 
‘artificial intelligence’ in 1955, has written that “one of the reasons for inventing the 
term ‘artificial intelligence’ was to escape association with ‘cybernetics’ ” 
(McCarthy 1988, p. 227).
As a person he was warm, energetic, and highly supportive of others – “the most 
loose and spontaneous, least machinelike of men” (Heims 1991, p. 39). He was 
famous for his bohemian lifestyle, with large summer gatherings of family, col-
leagues and friends at his farm in Connecticut. At the farm he “undertook crazy 
schemes – from constructing a sizable dam (referred to as a ‘pond’), to building a 
quasi-cathedral (referred to as a ‘barn’)” (Beer 1999, p. 434).
McCulloch was a very generous man, both in practical terms (helping out stu-
dents and young colleagues financially and by having them stay at his house) and in 
the intellectual support he gave to younger colleagues. The list of people who later 
described him as their mentor is a long one. As well as Walter Pitts, his close col-
laborator and almost an adopted son, notable people in the systems field who he

influenced included Heinz von Foerster, Gregory Bateson, Stafford Beer and Stuart 
Kauffman. McCulloch’s influence can be strongly seen on the work of all four of 
these thinkers and through them on both cybernetics and complexity theory. As his 
biographer Tara Abraham (2016, p. 75) observes, he was always an “egalitarian 
mentor”, without a sense of status or hierarchy.
Despite this deep personal warmth, the mechanistic approach – the close analogy 
between humans and machines – remained important to McCulloch throughout his 
life. In the Hixon symposium in 1948, the founding conference of cognitive science, 
he used the vivid image that “for us in the biological sciences – or at least, in psy-
chiatry – we are presented with an alien, or enemy’s, machine. We do not know what 
the machine is supposed to do and certainly we have no blueprint of it” (Jeffress 
1951, p. 32).
This mechanistic approach was part of the reason for his vehement opposition, 
within psychiatry, to Freudian psychoanalysis – Blum (2016) referred to him as “the 
anti-Freud” (p. 39). His anti-Freudianism also came from his belief that psycho-
analysis was over-dominant in American psychiatry of his time – McCulloch said in 
1952 that “Psychoanalysts … formed a sect in psychiatry where there should be 
none. This sect so controls the teaching hospitals of our city [Chicago] that no one 
may be a resident of psychiatry unless he is approached by them for membership in 
their sect” (quoted by Abraham 2016, p. 118).
Notwithstanding McCulloch’s mechanistic approach, it was as a result of his 
work that the relativist approach to cybernetics which became known as second-­
order cybernetics began to form. This was partly due to his influence on Heinz von 
Foerster (the founder of second-order cybernetics) and on Gregory Bateson (with 
his work on communication, paradox and the distributed nature of mind). But 
McCulloch’s focus on experimental epistemology made it a possibility that his 
understanding of the nature of knowledge would shift with his results, and this in 
fact did happen with the paper “What the Frog’s Eye Tells the Frog’s Brain” (Lettvin 
et al. 1959). Although the experimental work for this paper was done by Jerome 
Lettvin and Humberto Maturana, it was conducted in McCulloch’s laboratory, he 
discussed its ideas as the paper was written, and he appears as a co-author. The 
paper argues that “the eye speaks to the brain in a language already highly organized 
and interpreted, instead of transmitting some more or less accurate copy of the dis-
tribution of light on the receptors” (Lettvin et al. 1959) – the frog’s eye is construct-
ing a model of reality as it views objects rather than reflecting an existing reality to 
the brain. These results would later form a key part of Maturana’s view of the biol-
ogy of cognition.
Perhaps McCulloch’s greatest contribution to cybernetics was institutional. He 
instigated and chaired all ten of the celebrated conferences on cybernetics funded by 
the Macy Foundation, running from 1946 to 1953. These are often associated with 
Norbert Wiener, but it was McCulloch who was at their core. The list of participants 
in the conferences is extraordinary: simply among the better-known ones are 
Gregory Bateson, Alex Bavelas, Heinz von Foerster, Ralph Gerard, Kurt Lewin, 
Margaret Mead and John von Neumann (with guests including Claude Shannon and 
Wolfgang Köhler). It was McCulloch who held this group together.

He was a strong chair of the conferences, who “exercised considerable control 
over who was allowed to speak and who was not” (Hayles 1999, p. 57). Indeed, 
Bateson and Mead in a dialogue remarked that “McCulloch had a grand design in 
his mind … on how the shape of the conversation would run over 5 years – what had 
to be said before what else had to be said. ... He was very autocratic.” (Brand 1976).
By McCulloch’s account, the early conferences were very argumentative: “The 
first five meetings were intolerable. Some participants left in tears, never to return. 
We tried some sessions with and some without recording, but nothing was printable. 
The smoke, the noise, the smell of battle are not printable” (McCulloch 1974, p. 12). 
The conferences were to lead to the foundation of more than one new discipline, and 
to a much greater understanding between participants of the possibilities and limits 
of interdisciplinarity: “we have learned to know one another a bit better, and to fight 
fair in our shirt sleeves” (McCulloch at the final conference in 1953, quoted by 
Heims 1991, p. 277). The conferences were celebrated even as they were happen-
ing, and were one of the chief reasons for the public awareness of cybernetics as a 
new (and mysterious) enterprise.
Of course, the Macy conferences did not happen in a void. As Heims (1991) 
discusses, it was no accident that they took place post-war, given the strong empha-
sis on team-working among scientists during the war (and consequent blurring of 
disciplinary boundaries). It was also a time in the United States of growing social 
and political conservatism, which made the social sciences vulnerable to colonisa-
tion by perspectives from biology, physics and mathematics.
From one perspective, McCulloch’s approach to cybernetics formed part of that 
colonisation –McCulloch’s transdisciplinarity was partly about boundary-crossing 
but also about taking over a wide set of domains with the approaches he champi-
oned. As Abraham (2016, p. 127) argues:
In [cyberneticians’] goal of applying mathematical and theoretical practices to problems in 
the life and human sciences, they were striving for transdisciplinarity—seeking to lay over 
a new way of looking at the world that would transform scientific practice across fields.
Political context proved important in the later stages of McCulloch’s life. In 1964 
(the same year as Wiener died), at the height of the Cold War, officers from the 
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became concerned that the United States was 
falling behind the Soviet Union in the field of cybernetics, which had been named 
and shaped in the US but was becoming central to Soviet science (Kline 2015). Part 
of their response was the establishment of the American Society for Cybernetics, 
which is still active today, and McCulloch was persuaded by the CIA to become its 
first president. This might seem shocking to contemporary observers, although as 
Guddemi (2015) has observed, CIA support of academic work that formed an alter-
native to Soviet approaches, was not unusual for the time.
McCulloch was a paradox: the humanist who advocated mechanism; the realist 
whose work led to relativism. He had a fascinating blend of intellectual ideas, and 
his influence lives on in very many ways. At the end of his life, he described himself 
as follows (M. C. Bateson 1972, p. 24):

I expected to be a theologian. I got seduced by mathematics. I got interested in the epistemic 
problems of all science, particularly mathematics. I majored in philosophy, minored in psy-
chology, went to medical school in order to get the workings of a machine called a brain. 
I’ve been at it ever since. I have lived among brilliant youngsters who keep turning up new 
ideas all the time. I am very happy, very puzzled, very hopeful.

As the industrial revolution concludes in bigger and better bombs, an intellectual 
revolution opens with bigger and better robots. The former revolution replaced mus-
cles by engines and was limited by the law of the conservation of energy, or of mass-­
energy. The new revolution threatens us, the thinkers, with technological 
unemployment, for it will replace brains with machines limited by the law that 
entropy never decreases. These machines, whose evolution competition will compel 
us to foster, raise the appropriate practical question: “Why is the mind in the head?”
Coming as I do between psyche anatomized and psyche synthesized, I must so 
define my terms that I can bridge the traditional gulf between mind and body and 
the technical gap between things begotten and things made.
By the term ‘mind’, I mean ideas and purposes. By the term ‘body’, I mean stuff 
and process. Stuff and process are familiar to every physicist as mass and energy in 
space and time, but ideas and purposes he keeps only in the realm of discourse and 
will not postulate them of the phenomena he observes. In this I agree with him. But 
what he observes is some sort of order or invariance in the flux of events. Every 
object he detects in the world is some sort of regularity. The existence of these 
objects is the first law of science. To detect regularities in the relations of objects 
and so construct theoretical physics requires the disciplines of logic and mathemat-
ics. In these fundamentally tautological endeavors we invent surprising regularities, 
complicated transformations which conserve whatever truth may lie in the proposi-
tions they transform. This is invariance, many steps removed from simple sensation 
but not essentially different. It is these regularities, or invariants, which I call ideas, 
whether they are theorems of great abstraction or qualities simply sensed. The rea-
son for excluding them from physics is that they must not be supposed to be either 
stuff or process in the causal sequences of any part of the world. They are neither 
material nor efficient. So, to my mind Newton, Planck, and Jeans sin by introducing 
God as a sort of mind at large in the world to account for physical effects, like the 
action of gravity at a distance.
But let us now compel our physicist to account for himself as a part of the physi-
cal world. In all fairness, he must stick to his own rules and show in terms of mass,

energy, space, and time how it comes about that he creates theoretical physics. He 
must then become a neurophysiologist (that is what happened to me), but in so 
doing he will be compelled to answer whether theoretical physics is something 
which he can discuss in terms of neurophysiology (and that is what happened to 
me). To answer ‘no’ is to remain a physicist undefiled. To answer ‘yes’ is to become 
a metaphysician – or so I am told.
But is that just? The physicist believes entropy to be somehow in or of physical 
systems. It may or must increase with time. But it is neither material nor efficient, 
in fact it is a number, namely, the logarithm of the probability of the state. It is, 
therefore, a measure of the disorder of an ensemble – or collection of systems. Now 
Norbert Wiener has proposed that information is orderliness and suggests that we 
measure it by negative entropy, the logarithm of the reciprocal of the probability of 
the state. Let us, for this argument, accept his suggestion. Ideas are then to be con-
strued as information. Sensation becomes entropic coupling between us and the 
physical world, and our interchange of ideas, entropic coupling among ourselves. 
Our knowledge of the world, our conversation – yes, even our inventive thought – 
are then limited by the law that information may not increase on going through 
brains, or computing machines. […]
Let me define ‘corruption’ as the ratio of information in the input to that in the 
output. Each eye has something like a hundred million photoreceptors, each of 
which in a given millisecond can emit one or no impulse. In other words, it is an 
ensemble which can be in any one of 2100,000,000 possible states, or the amount of 
information it has is a hundred million units per millisecond. […]
What becomes of all the rest of the information? To answer that, conceive neu-
rons as telegraphic relays. Each one may be tripped by some combination of signals 
provided these are very nearly synchronous. It detects the coincidence and only then 
emits a signal to subsequent relays. Now the threshold of the photoreceptors of the 
eye is always varying. At any one millisecond it may be tripped by a single photon, 
and, at another, fail to fire in response to many. By connecting many of these to a 
coincidence detector set to require a reasonable number of impulses simultaneously, 
we have a signal which corresponds to a statistically significant fraction of its recep-
tors and so we wash out the random variation of threshold. Thus using the relayed 
information that fails to agree with other information, we achieve a high probability 
that what goes on through the nervous system does correspond to something in the 
world. Perhaps it will be clearer to say it this way. The logical probability that a 
neuron will have an impulse in one millisecond is ½, that two neurons of an ensem-
ble in the same millisecond ½ × ½. The chance that both will fire by chance simul-
taneously is the product of their probabilities separately; that is, it is smaller; ¼. 
Therefore, in the nervous system, by repeatedly demanding coincidence we vastly 
increase the probability that what is in the output corresponds to something in the 
input. We pay for certainty with information. The eye relays to the brain about the 
hundredth part of the information it receives. The chance that what it does relay is 
due to chance is fantastically small, 2−100, a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a 
tenth of one per cent.

27
Here, then, is the first technically important difference between us and robots. In 
them we cannot afford to carry out any computations, no matter how simple, in a 
hundred parallel paths and demand coincidence. Consequently, no computing 
machine is as likely to go right under conditions as various as those we undergo. […]
A nervous impulse is also a signal. It is true if what it proposes is true, otherwise 
it is false. It is false if it arises from any cause other than the adequate, or proper, 
excitation of the cell. The threshold of the dark-adapted eye for light is about a pho-
ton in several seconds. Pressure applied to the eye will evoke impulses, but the 
energy required is many million times more. Press on the eye and you see light 
when there is no light. The signals are false. Thus nervous impulses are atomic sig-
nals, or atomic propositions on the move. To them the calculus of propositions 
applies provided each is subscripted for the time of its occurrence and implication 
given a domain only in the past. In terms of such a calculus applied to nervous nets, 
Pitts and I have been able to prove that even nets devoid of circles can realize any 
proposition which is a logical consequence of its input. As this is the most that any 
net can do it is obviously an adequate theory. We know, of course, that facilitation 
and extinction occur, and we showed that whatever these can effect can be done 
digitally, or discretely, by go, no-go devices. In our first essay, we were unable to 
obtain much more than the calculus of atomic propositions; but, by introducing 
circles in which a train of impulses patterned after some fact could circulate, we did 
get existential operators for time past. […]
There are other closed paths important in the origin of ideas, circuits which have 
‘negative feedback’. In terms of them reflexes were first defined as actions starting 
in some part of the body, setting up impulses to the central nervous system, whence 
they were reflected to those structures in which they arose, and there stopped or 
reversed the process that gave rise to them. All inverse feedbacks have this in com-
mon, that each establishes some particular state of the system, for they bring it back 
toward that state by an amount which increases with their deviation from that state. 
They are, as we say, error-operated. The state toward which they return the system 
is the goal, or aim, or end in and of the operation. This is what is meant by function. 
On these circuits Cannon founded his theory of homeostasis, and Rosenblueth and 
Wiener their theory of teleological mechanisms. […]
Neurons are cheap and plentiful. If it cost a million dollars to beget a man, one 
neuron would not cost a mill. They operate with comparatively little energy. The 
heat generated raises the blood in passage about half a degree, and the flow is half a 
liter per minute, only a quarter of a kilogram calorie per minute for 1010, that is, 10 
billion neurons. Von Neumann would be happy to have their like for the same cost 
in his robots. His vacuum tubes can work a thousand times as fast as neurons, so he 
could match a human brain with 10 million tubes; but it would take Niagara Falls to 
supply the current and the Niagara River to carry away the heat. So he is limited to 
about the thousandth part of man’s computer. He has to be very careful to specify in 
detail which relays are to be connected to a given relay to trip it. That is not the case 
in human brains. Wiener has calculated that the maximum amount of information 
our chromosomes can convey would fill one volume of the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica, which could specify all the connections of ten thousand neurons if that

was all it had to do. As we have 1010 neurons, we can inherit only the general 
scheme of the structure of our brains. The rest must be left to chance. Chance 
includes experience which engenders learning. Ramon y Cajal suggested that learn-
ing was the growing of new connections.
I do not doubt that the cerebral cortex may be the most important place in pri-
mates. But it is certainly the most difficult place to look for change with use. Think 
of it as a laminated felt of fibers which serve to associate neighboring rough col-
umns of cells nearly a hundred high and linked together vertically by their axons. 
These columns are then connected to distant columns by axons which dip into the 
white matter and emerge elsewhere into the cortex. These last connections I have 
studied for many years but have at best a general picture of how areas are related, 
certainly nothing that could give the detail necessary to distinguish between its con-
nections before and after learning. […]
This brings us back to what I believe is the answer to the question: Why is the 
mind in the head? Because there, and only there, are hosts of possible connections 
to be formed as time and circumstance demand. Each new connection serves to set 
the stage for others yet to come and better fitted to adapt us to the world, for through 
the cortex pass the greatest inverse feedbacks whose function is the purposive life of 
the human intellect. The joy of creating ideals, new and eternal, in and of a world, 
old and temporal, robots have it not.

Chapter 4
Margaret Mead
Margaret Mead was one of the most well-known and influential social scientists of 
the twentieth century. She worked as an anthropologist, carrying out fieldwork over 
a number of years on a number of south Pacific islands. Her fame arose from the 
clarity of her writing, from her ability to express anthropological ideas in a way that 
the public could appreciate, and from the way she analysed her own culture (the 
United States) based on fieldwork elsewhere. Mead is not widely known as a sys-
tems thinker, yet she was deeply involved in the birth of the systems movement, and 
her work shows clear systemic elements.
Margaret Mead was born in 1901, in Philadelphia, and died in 1978, in New York. 
She was educated at Barnard College and Columbia University (both in New York). 
As an undergraduate (initially studying psychology), she took a course in anthropol-
ogy with Franz Boas – the centre of a group working on a cultural approach to 
anthropology – and his student Ruth Benedict, and their ideas formed a basis for all 
her future work. Mead’s primary institutional affiliation, where she was based for 
50 years as assistant curator and then curator, was the American Museum of Natural 
History in New York.
Mead was an active member of the Episcopal Church throughout her adult life, 
and highly motivated by an idea of service to humanity. In persuading her to leave 
psychology and devote her career to anthropology, Benedict told her that “Professor 
Boas and I have nothing to offer but an opportunity to do work that matters” (Mead 
1972, p. 114), and this approach echoed throughout Mead’s life. The epitaph on her 
tombstone, a quote from her writing, reads “to cherish the life of the world”  
(M. C. Bateson 1984).
Mead saw little separation between her work and her personal life (Howard 
1984). Many of her deepest personal relationships were with people who she also 
worked closely with, both men and women. She was married three times (to Luther 
Cressman, Reo Fortune and Gregory Bateson) and also had long relationships with 
Ruth Benedict and Rhoda Metraux. She worked closely over a number of years with 
Fortune, Bateson, Benedict, Metraux and her daughter Mary Catherine Bateson.

32
Metraux (1980) has divided Mead’s working life into four key phases. From 
1925 to 1939, she was intensely involved in fieldwork, making five major trips and 
studying eight different peoples (all on the South Pacific islands). The first of these, 
which Metraux notes was her only solo field trip, was on Samoa, and resulted in her 
celebrated early book Coming of Age in Samoa (Mead 1928), which not only pre-
sented a detailed anthropological study in a way that was accessible to the general 
public but also formed a reflection on her own society (in relation to the status of 
young people). This style, of describing cultural patterns in another society with 
respect and in great detail, while relating these patterns to issues in American soci-
ety, was one that Mead repeated through several further works.
Her fieldwork led her to write extensively on the relationship between gender 
and sex, and the culturally-created nature of gender, arguing that “standardized per-
sonality differences between the sexes are … cultural creations to which each gen-
eration, male and female, is trained to conform” (Mead 1935, p. 48). This view of 
gender led her to be criticised by social conservatives (and was not always popular 
with later feminists such as Betty Friedan), but remains highly pertinent today. 
Visweswaran (1997) describes her work as a form of ‘feminist ethnography’ and 
argues that Mead “was possibly not the first social scientist to develop a distinction 
between biological sex and sociologically distinct gender roles, but she was cer-
tainly the first to use ethnography to do so” (p. 601).
From 1939 to 1948, she was involved in public life on a series of applied problems 
relating to American society during World War II (notably the Committee on Food 
Habits on which she served with Kurt Lewin), when she “grasped how essential 
interdisciplinary thinking was in approaching these problems” (Metraux 1980, 
p. 266). During this time she also became a mother, to Mary Catherine Bateson, and 
typically approached Catherine’s early life and upbringing in a spirit of inquiry, 
experiment and study. Mead (1972, p. 261) later wrote that “bringing up Cathy was 
an intellectual as well as an emotionally exciting adventure.”
In a third phase of her life, from 1948 to 1953, she established (with Ruth 
Benedict) a series of projects on national cultures, again explicitly interdisciplinary. 
They designed a series of comparative studies of seven cultures, carried out over a 
number of years by a team which Mead coordinated following Benedict’s death 
in 1948.
In the fourth phase of her life (1953–1978), Mead’s diverse interests came 
together in a range of public settings. She taught in a number of institutions, took 
part in many conferences, served on several public policy committees, and pub-
lished many books and articles accessible to both scholarly and popular audiences. 
She was a visiting professor at a number of universities. She also played a signifi-
cant part as a public intellectual, writing a regular column in the popular magazine 
Redbook (often with Rhoda Metraux), to influence the thinking of the general pub-
lic on a variety of cultural issues. As Sabloff (2011, p. 410) observes, she had an 
influence on public perceptions of anthropology which has subsequently become 
lost, and that she “may not have been beloved by all in the anthropological com-
munity, but she definitely had a significant, positive impact on public views of key 
issues”.

While Mead spent a large part of her early life as a participant-observer in many 
different South Pacific cultures, in her subsequent life her ongoing passion was 
conversation and action, through conferences and through campaigns. She was con-
stantly drawing together threads from these many conversations – as Mary Catherine 
Bateson (1984, p. 191) comments: “As Margaret moved around the world, engaging 
in conversation after conversation, she was a one-person conference. She carried a 
little notebook around in her purse at all times, writing down any new idea or infor-
mation she thought she might want to use.” The impact of this work was huge – as 
Elise Boulding (1995, p. 422) observed, “there is hardly a social movement of the 
post-World War II decades that she did not personally touch”.
Mead was very concerned with effecting positive large-scale social change, 
using the tools of anthropology to create harmony. Heims (1991, p. 270) remarks 
that she “treasured pluralism and diversity and abhorred the homogenization of cul-
tures. … Mead’s active image of harmony with diversity was ‘the orchestration of 
cultures’ ”.
Nonetheless, it must not be thought that Mead was concerned only with largescale 
change. To take one example from her religious life: at the large-scale she was 
closely involved in the World Council of Churches. However she was also involved 
in smaller scale church ventures such as Emmaus House in Atlanta, which works to 
overcome poverty and racial segregation in that city. Throughout her life there was 
a constant theme of personal networks and of ways to build nurturing relationships 
that do not necessarily follow traditional patterns. Mary Catherine Bateson writes:
Through my mother’s writing echoes the question “What kind of world can we build for our 
children?” She thought in terms of building. She set out to create a community for me to 
grow up in … and she built and sustained a network of relationships around herself, at once 
the shelter in which I rested and the matrix of her work and thought. (1984, p. 16).
We have already noted the criticism of some of her work that was made in 
response to her comparisons between American and other societies, some of this 
due to her socially liberal conclusions – as Schiffman (2018, p. 42) argues, “her 
writings were a brazen challenge to America’s conservative social values”. After her 
death, she was publicly criticised by the Australian anthropologist Derek Freeman, 
who argued that Mead’s methods in Samoa had been insufficiently rigorous. 
Freeman’s criticism was widely spread through the popular media, and to some 
extent tarnished Mead’s posthumous reputation. However, later anthropologists 
have argued strongly that “there is no compelling evidence that Mead was hoaxed” 
and that “Freeman repeatedly misrepresented and misinterpreted [Samoan] testi-
mony not simply to revise the ethnographic record but to damage Mead’s reputation 
in a deliberate and personal manner” (Shankman 2013, p. 62).
Despite the widespread awareness of Mead’s work in her own time and today, 
she is not widely known as a systems thinker – normally she is identified with her 
discipline, cultural anthropology. This is a curiosity: she played a big role in the 
establishment of systems thinking, and her work clearly demonstrates a strong sys-
temic awareness. Elise Boulding (1995, p. 421) observes that “studying microso-
cieties is an ideal way to get inside the dynamics of social process, and Mead made 
4  Margaret Mead

34
the most of her opportunities. She was always asking the questions: What makes 
things change? What makes things stay the same?”
Mead was deeply involved in the Macy conferences: she was one of a core group 
of social scientists (with Larry Frank and Gregory Bateson) who set them up along-
side the physical scientists developing the mathematics of cybernetics. Heims 
(1991) has described her role in the conferences at that of a “talking chief” (p. 53), 
a Samoan term for an influential spokesperson, and she clearly acted as a conduit 
and champion of the role of social sciences in the conferences. She edited the pro-
ceedings of the sixth to tenth conferences, with Heinz von Foerster and Hans-Lukas 
Teuber. It was clear to her before the conferences that the world of social science 
was ready for the concepts of cybernetics – she said (citing Robert Merton) that 
“there wasn’t a person in the country who was thinking hard about problems who 
didn’t have a folder somewhere marked something like ‘circular systems’” 
(Brand 1976).
Mead’s involvement in the organisation of the systems movement continued 
after the Macy Conferences. She attended the founding meetings of the Society for 
General Systems Research (SGSR) and the American Society for Cybernetics 
(ASC), in 1954 and 1968 respectively. She continued to attend meetings of the 
SGSR, which were held until the early 1980s in conjunction with the American 
Academy for the Advancement of Science (Hammond 2003, p. 248) of which she 
was also a keen member and president. She was president of SGSR in 1972, imme-
diately before her presidency of the AAAS. In the case of both the SGSR and the 
ASC she argued that the new society should apply its own principles to its organisa-
tion – “they [SGSR] could use their theory to predict the kind and size of society 
they wanted, what its laws of growth and articulation with other parts of the scien-
tific community could be. I was slapped down without mercy. Of all the silly ideas, 
to apply the ideas on the basis of which the society was being formed to ITSELF!” 
(Mead 1968, p. 10).
Her commitment to social change can readily be linked to the SGSR’s goal of 
“science in service of humanity”. One of Mead’s mostly widely-quoted phrases 
sums this up: “never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can 
change the world – in fact, it’s the only thing that ever has”. The source for this is 
unknown, as discussed by the Institute of Intercultural Studies (2009), but it bears a 
close resemblance to the ideas to be found in Mead (1964), where she discusses the 
dynamics of cultural evolution, and in particular argues that “our constructive imag-
ination must be focused upon creating the conditions within which clusters contain-
ing highly gifted people are likely to form and, if they do, will make it possible for 
them to function well” (p. xxi).
Furthermore, Mead was conscious of the way that the use of cybernetics drifted 
away from its early potential. She was particularly critical of the popular use of the 
word ‘feedback’ had been taken up in everyday language as “a jargon-catchall for 
any kind of report back to government, management, the subjects of an experiment, 
subjects during an experiment, and so on” (Mead 1964, pp. 272–273) – see the later 
chapter on Kurt Lewin.
4  Margaret Mead

35
Mead’s view, as described by Miller (1996), was that “the other social sciences 
… looked at only parts of a society but anthropology was concerned with the whole 
system so the emphasis on ‘wholes’ in systems theory was important”. Others have 
noted the importance of her systemic approach – Henshaw (2019, p. 77) writes of 
her insight that “human cultures are socially not biologically inherited systems of 
information”; and Varenne (2000, p. xxi) noted that her analysis of the United States 
during wartime was grounded in cybernetics – “America is approached as “teleo-
logical“ process, that is as a set of interactions through which miscellaneous partici-
pants react to each other as they struggle for a particular goal”.
However, it was unusual for her to explicitly use the language of systems in her 
scholarly writing. In essence, this seems to be because her anthropological under-
standing of holism was sufficient for her needs. She reflected at times on this lack 
of use of systems language, though she said it was common to most anthropological 
work. Commenting on cybernetics, she wrote that “anthropologists participated in 
the initial formulations and a few anthropologists have used the families of models 
that come from information and communication theory; but the use of such models 
has not penetrated the central core of the discipline” (Mead 1961, p. 479).
In closing, we can clearly see Mead’s overall view of the relation between 
anthropology and systems ideas in an article that was published during her time as 
president of the SGSR:
General systems theory has taken its impetus from the excitement of discovering larger and 
larger contexts, on the one hand, and a kind of microprobing into fine detail within a system, 
on the other. Both of these activities are intrinsic to anthropology to the extent that field 
work in living societies has been the basic disciplinary method. It is no revelation to any 
field-experienced anthropologist that everything is related to everything else, or that 
whether the entire sociocultural setting can be studied in detail or not, it has to be known in 
general outline. (Mead 1973, p. 8).

I suppose that one of the reasons that I am contributing to this endeavor is that I 
myself was at the small Josiah Macy Foundation Conference on cerebral inhibition–
in the middle of World War II – at which we began planning for the Macy Conferences 
which became the Conferences on Cybernetics (Mead et al. 1950–56). That first 
small conference was so exciting that I did not notice that I had broken one of my 
teeth until the conference was over.
I was a member of that first group as an anthropologist. The competence I had 
–and have – comes from the intensive analysis of very small, relatively isolated, and 
intimately known communities which serve as living models from which one can 
sometimes develop larger, more formal models. Besides the anthropologists’ 
Reading from Mead’s work

36
­experience with the small societies which are their laboratories, anthropologists 
have a second task: to interest themselves in what is happening in our own culture, 
to stand outside it and look at it as a whole.
As an anthropologist, I have been interested in the effects that the theories of 
cybernetics have within our society. I am not referring to computers or to the elec-
tronic revolution as a whole, or to the “implosion” and the end of dependence on 
script for knowledge, or to the way that dress has succeeded the mimeographing 
machine as a form of communication among the dissenting young. I specifically 
want to consider the significance of the set of cross-disciplinary ideas which we first 
called “feedback” and then called “teleological mechanisms” (Frank et al. 1948), 
and then called “cybernetics” – a form of cross-disciplinary thought which made it 
possible for members of many disciplines to communicate with each other easily in 
a language which all could understand. This was an important motive for those of us 
who worked in those first conferences at the end of the 1940s. We were impressed 
by the potential usefulness of a language sufficiently sophisticated to be used to 
solve complex human problems, and sufficiently abstract to make it possible to 
cross disciplinary boundaries. We thought we would go on to real interdisciplinary 
research, using this language as a medium. Instead, the whole thing fragmented. 
Norbert Wiener wrote his book Cybernetics (Wiener 1948). It fascinated intellectu-
als and it looked for a while as if the ideas that he expressed would become a way 
of thought. But they didn’t.
I would now like to consider cybernetics as a way of looking at things and as a 
language for expressing what one sees. We might look at the history of thinking 
about the relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. There was a 
time about 20 years ago when the two countries were so preoccupied with each 
other that they acted as if they were the only two countries with any political signifi-
cance on this planet. Specialists in each nation expended enormous energy trying to 
penetrate the secrets of the other system. The Soviets made a great many hypotheses 
about the way our system worked which were based on their own highly centralized 
form and which led to false conclusions, such as the assumption that both American 
political parties were run from “Wall Street” – a sort of capitalist counterpart of the 
Kremlin. This belief of theirs and our adverse views of the Kremlin have now 
coalesced in the present mythology of “the establishment” or “the industrial mili-
tary complex”. Twenty years ago, even 10 years ago, it was possible to think of the 
United States system and the Soviet system as two relatively self-contained and 
independent systems, coupled together by mutual suspicion, passionate attention, 
and intermittently successful espionage. It was even possible to propose – as I did a 
few years ago – that, if we wished for a more reliable form of knowledge and under-
standing between the two systems than espionage could provide, we should use 
cybernetics as a cross-cultural vocabulary for expressing the relevant differences 
between the two systems. I suggested this at a time when it seemed that cybernetics 
was ideologically free and was developing very rapidly in the Soviet Union. Many 
more young people there were learning about it than there were in this country, and 
it seemed that here was a possibility that two rival nations, with very different ideo-
logical premises, could develop a language in which their systems could be described 
4  Margaret Mead

37
in a way that was ideologically neutral. As there were many unadmitted occasions 
when the United States and the Soviet policy-makers did want to agree, such a lan-
guage would have been useful.
Today there are new developments which make me less hopeful that such a 
venture could succeed. We have now developed an interest – and interest in Soviet 
affairs always contains a certain element of fear – in the possibility that the Soviet 
system may become totally cyberneticized, in the technical sense, as a way of con-
trolling everything within its borders and possibly outside, with thousands of giant 
computers linked together in a system of prodigious and unheard-of efficiency. If 
this is so, or if we continue to discuss the computerization of the Soviet economy in 
terms of emulation and dread, cybernetics as a way of thought will cease to be ideo-
logically free. There has also, however, been a marked decrease in the extent to 
which the United States and the Soviet Union are exclusively preoccupied with each 
other. […].
As the world scene broadens, there is a continuing possibility of using cybernetics 
as a form of communication in a world of increasing scientific specializations. The 
possibilities are fascinating if we can only get a large enough number of welldefined 
elements in large enough systems. It is argued, e.g., that Lake Erie is not only dead 
because there was no agency equipped to think ecologically about what was 
happening to its waters, but that, in fact, Lake Erie and its environs is too small a 
system to have been dealt with if, in fact, there had been any group or agency 
charged with preventing the Lake Erie disaster. It is further argued that if, instead, 
the whole Great Lakes region is considered together, then it might be possible to 
make the kind of predictions which could be tested in advance. In such a plan it 
should be possible to introduce correctives for too much linear and too little lateral 
planning, and linear planning is the besetting difficulty of most of the planning in 
the world today. It is argued that with large, inclusive, and well-analyzed systems 
we might be able to do a better job. There we find, on the one hand, tremendous 
hope about our capabilities to deal with complex systems if we can only identify the 
right system of the right size with the right variables. Although these are a great 
many ifs, they are not serious ifs. For we are free now from the superstition of some 
sociologists in the 1950s that we would never be able to deal with more than seven 
variables at once. And we have also gotten out from under the tyranny of the law of 
parsimony so that we can’t be bullied quite so easily into thinking that the simplest 
solution to a problem is the best.
But, at the same time, I think we ought to look very seriously at the current state 
of American society within which we hope to be able to develop these very sophis-
ticated ways of handling systems that are, indeed, in dire need of attention. Problems 
of metropolitan areas, the growth of such areas, and the choice of areas appropriate 
for planning certainly represent one such field. The interrelations between different 
levels of government, the efficient redistribution of income through procedures like 
the negative income tax, and the linkages necessary among parts of large industrial 
complexes that are widely separated in space are cases where a systems analysis is 
necessary. But the new kind of analysis of these complex systems on which predic-
tions can be eased must be undertaken in a world which is made up of individuals 
Reading from Mead’s work

38
who hold a great variety of positions of power within the various bureaucracies, in 
government, in industry, in the armed services. And these powerful people – who 
must order, provide for, and utilize such system analysis – are living in a world in 
which there are a large number of breakdowns in thinking. These breakdowns are of 
an order that I think should concern those of us who hope to promote the ability to 
think in cybernetic terms. […].
Yet it seems that interest in the human components of complex automated and 
computerized systems is decreasing rather than increasing. First we looked at men 
and turned them into “human components”, and then we stopped looking at them at 
all. We are educating the future human components, upon whose precision and 
accuracy and sense of responsibility the operation of future systems will depend, by 
training them to be trigger-happy in multiple-choice tests, by out-educating from 
their minds the fundamental human quality of responsibility based on accurate rea-
soning. I recently attended a large, expensive, and important conference on a subject 
of interest to many millions of people. The young and enthusiastic organizers, when 
queried about some of the arrangements they were making, simply replied: “We 
have decided we just have to risk failure”. This is a form of ethical heroism appro-
priate perhaps in individual life but highly inappropriate in the design of national 
conferences on airport lighting, in fact in any of the increasing number of circum-
stances in which – as in parachute jumping – it is necessary to get it right the first 
time. We have not yet built into our educational system any recognition of the points 
where precision is essential, and yet we are living in a society where one mistake 
can dislocate the lives of thousands of people, wreck distribution systems, and dis-
tort life-history data, and subsequent career lines. […].
In World War II, anthropologists developed ways of thinking about old nations 
like Japan. Japanese culture was very easy to schematize in ways that were adequate 
for effective prediction. All that was needed was some hard work by experienced 
analysts. It was possible to probe and sample at anyone of many available points in 
order to get material for a systematic description. But new nations, amalgams of 
different cultures at different levels, within the present world framework, cannot be 
dealt with this way. We have no tools for doing a comparable analysis of Nigeria 
torn by civil war. We are dealing with new kinds of partial organization among areas 
of much higher and much lower organization which none of our theories take into 
account. In the past, it was possible to view opposing and organized systems in 
some degree of isolation. Today we are dealing with a sort of social metastasis in 
which there are fragments of formerly highly organized behavior which are unsys-
tematically related to each other. We have no way of thinking about this.
If we think of the steps through the early interdisciplinary development of 
cybernetic models, through general systems theory and our growing willingness to 
include more and more complex systems, I think that now we have to take another 
step and develop ways of thinking about systems that are still bounded but within 
which there are loci of very contrasting degrees of organization and disorganization. 
If we approach them with our former methods, if we treat some of these organized 
pieces in isolation, we may get something that can be treated as a system, but we

learn nothing about the way in which it is embedded in intractable ways in some 
larger and less organized context, and we may also do a great deal of harm.

W. Ross Ashby
Ross Ashby was a deeply original thinker, who produced innovative work in a num-
ber of different areas. He was a psychiatrist by training, and his core concern was in 
understanding how the mind and brain worked, to find “what principles must be 
followed when one attempts to restore normal function to a sick organism that is, as 
a human patient, of fearful complexity” (Ashby 1956, p. vii). The pursuit of this 
goal led him to advance the field of cybernetics very significantly. His influence on 
the field, both in his own time and to the present day, has been considerable.
Ashby was one of the first people to work explicitly in the field of cybernetics, 
and was at the heart of the distinctive British school of early cybernetics described 
by Pickering (2010). He produced one of the very earliest papers in cybernetics, 
wrote the first textbook in the field, developed a much-discussed working model of 
an electronic brain, and invented the term ‘self-organisation’. He formulated one of 
the most widely-accepted fundamentals of cybernetics, the Law of Requisite Variety. 
He was also closely involved in the General Systems movement and in work that 
would lead to the birth of complexity theory.
William Ross Ashby was born in 1903 in London. He was educated at Cambridge 
University and St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. He worked largely as a prac-
tising psychiatrist for the early part of his career, at psychiatric hospitals in London 
and Northampton, although he published a number of research articles on medical 
topics from 1930 onwards. He was deeply devoted to his wife Elsie Maud Thorne, 
known to him as ‘Rosebud’, from their marriage in 1931 until his death, and they 
had three daughters together (J. Ashby, 2008). In 1947, he became the director of 
research at Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester, where he remained until 1959 
and where much of his early work on cybernetics was conducted. After a brief spell 
as director of the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol, he moved in 1961 to the 
University of Illinois, to work as a professor in the Biological Computing Laboratory 
of Heinz von Foerster. He retired from Illinois in 1970 and returned to the United 
Kingdom where he died in 1972.
Ashby was a very private person. Stafford Beer, who admired his work greatly 
and drew upon it in a number of his own works, described Ashby as “very much his 

42
own man, and difficult to know” (Beer 1973, p. 2). He was a precise and rigorous 
thinker, who “could be infuriating in his habit of stopping people in mid-sentence to 
demand exact definitions, and he would not hesitate to declare that an utterance was 
a mere concatenation of words bearing no meaning whatsoever” (Beer 1973, 
pp. 1–2). Nonetheless, he could be highly enthusiastic and inspiring to those with 
whom he worked. Conant (1974), a former student, says that “his grave and some-
what forbidding demeanour gave way, when he was engaged in a conversation or 
lecture, to an animated style in which his unique keen wit and knack for viewing the 
commonplace from unusual perspectives would soon turn the discourse into a star-
tling stream of surprises”. Throughout his life (starting in 1928 and continuing until 
his death), he wrote a set of notebooks, in which he first developed all of his ideas, 
eventually amounting to 7189 pages which he carefully indexed (J. Ashby 2008). 
The entire text of these notebooks has been made available online by his family 
(Ashby 1928–1972).
Ashby’s first major contribution to the field of cybernetics can be seen in his 
paper “Adaptiveness and Equilibrium” published in 1940, 3 years before the two 
articles generally regarded as the founding papers of cybernetics (McCulloch and 
Pitts 1943; Rosenbleuth et al. 1943). In this paper, Ashby described the process of a 
chain of variables where one has an impact on the next (which he called a ‘func-
tional circuit’). He had a clear concept of both negative and positive forms of feed-
back, the results of which he referred to as stable and unstable equilibrium 
respectively – he remarked that “if we find that a system persists, in spite of the 
usual small disturbances which affect every physical body, then we may draw the 
conclusion with absolute certainty that the system must be in stable equilibrium” 
(Ashby 1940, p. 482). He went on to draw a close parallel between the concept of 
stable equilibrium (i.e. a system controlled by negative feedback) and adaptive 
behaviour of animal and humans to their environment – in effect, a model of learn-
ing which he would develop in later work.
That Ashby should have written in terms of feedback in 1940 is not entirely sur-
prising: as discussed in the chapter on Margaret Mead, the concept of circular sys-
tems was quite widespread in the period. Indeed, a decade later Ashby was to be a 
member of the Ratio Club, an informal group of young scientists whose member-
ship was limited to those “who had Wiener’s ideas before Wiener’s book appeared” 
(a phrase of the club’s founder John Bates, quoted by Husbands and Holland 2008, 
p. 92). Other members of the club included the great mathematician and computer 
scientist Alan Turing and W. Grey Walter who created an early robot known as the 
‘mechanical turtle’, among many others later influential in various scientific fields. 
Nonetheless, the clarity and explicitness with which Ashby discussed these ideas 
was unusual, as was his link to adaptive behaviour.
Ashby developed his model of stability and adaptation further through the build-
ing of an experimental machine which became greatly famous, the Homeostat. It 
was designed as an electronic model of the process of homeostasis in the brain, and 
the way in which a machine could achieve stability by its own activity. The 
Homeostat even featured in Time magazine, which referred to it as “the thinking 
machine”, and describing Ashby’s view as being that the machine “takes action on 
5  W. Ross Ashby

its own, according to any change in situation affecting it” (Time 1949). The 
Homeostat was not universally supported in the cybernetics community: when 
Ashby presented it at the ninth Macy conference in 1952, a number of participants 
criticised its model of the brain and the extent to which it actually could be said to 
be learning (Kline 2015, p. 53). Wiener, however, regarded the homeostat highly, 
calling it “one of the great philosophical contributions of the present day” (Wiener 
1954, p. 38).
The Homeostat and its design formed the basis of the first of Ashby’s two highly 
significant books, Design for a Brain (first published in 1952, with a much revised 
second edition in 1960). His goal in this book was to consider in more depth the 
question of adaptive behaviour, and its working in the brain, and “to show that a 
system can be both mechanistic in nature and yet produce behaviour that is adap-
tive” (Ashby 1960, p. 1). That is, he sought to create a mechanistic model of the 
brain and its ability to learn. The Homeostat formed the experimental evidence for 
this work, while cybernetics (and information theory) formed the theoretical basis. 
In many ways the book is now a historical curiosity – while there are still many 
theorists with the same goal as Ashby, especially within cognitive science, the meth-
ods they use have changed. However it influenced many scholars – the economist 
and cognitive scientist Herbert Simon wrote in his memoirs that he “stayed up all 
night to finish Design for a Brain” on its publication in 1952 (Kline 2015, p. 146).
The book also introduced his concept of ultrastability, a generalisation of the 
self-regulating property of the Homeostat. He describes this mechanism as ‘double 
feedback’, and argues that the mechanism must always be present in any system 
which has adaptive behaviour altered by interaction with its environment. This con-
cept would later form the basis of Argyris and Schön’s (1978) distinction between 
single- and double-loop learning.
Ashby’s second book, Introduction to Cybernetics, had a wider and more lasting 
impact than his first. For many years it was the major text in the field of cybernetics. 
He described cybernetics as a theory of machines, within which category he included 
living organisms and their brains as much as machines built by humans (a common 
view among many early cyberneticians). He argued that cybernetics is a general 
field of study of theoretical validity in its own right (see the reading from his 
work below).
The generality which Ashby applied to systems through his use of cybernetics 
was close in its goals to that of general systems theory (GST). Ashby became very 
interested in this approach, and was closely involved in the early days of the Society 
for General Systems Research – he attended its founding conference in 1955, and 
was president of the society from 1962 to 1964. However, his approach to general 
systems theory was somewhat at odds with that of many others within GST, notably 
Ludwig von Bertalanffy (whose work is discussed in the following chapter). As 
seen in the extract which follows, Ashby defined cybernetics as “the study of sys-
tems that are open to energy but closed to information and control—systems that are 
‘information-tight’” (Ashby 1956, p. 4). This contradicted Bertalanffy’s view that 
the openness of systems to external inputs was crucial to enable them to change 
radically, which to him was very important when studying social systems and which 
5  W. Ross Ashby

44
he felt was impossible with closed systems. At the time, the distinction between 
GST and cybernetics was not as strong as it later became, so this was a significant 
debate, albeit one arising partly from their different fields of interest leading them 
to focus on different levels of analysis (Ashby’s concerns being largely biological 
and related to individuals, Bertalanffy’s being more large-scale and social).
The tools which Ashby presents in Introduction to Cybernetics are largely math-
ematical, but at a level such that they are quite accessible. He treats cybernetics in 
terms of a theory of transformation – the identification of difference, “either that 
two things are recognisably different or that one thing has changed with time” 
(Ashby 1956, p. 9). The state of a system at any given time is a crucial part of this 
analysis – i.e. the present value of its variables, for Ashby required any system must 
be definable in terms of quantifiable variables.
Deriving from the concept of state, in Ashby’s work, is the concept of variety: the 
number of possible states that a system can have, which in a system with more than 
a small number of variables will be a very large number. As Beer (1974) argues, 
variety can thus be taken as a measure of the complexity of a system.
Ashby applied the concept of variety to the question of regulation (i.e. the con-
trol, governance or management of a larger system by a smaller system), consider-
ing the relationship between the variety in the regulator and in the system being 
regulated. He concluded, in his famous Law of Requisite Variety, that the regulator 
must contain as much variety as the system being regulated. That is to say, if there 
is insufficient variety in the regulator, the only solutions are either to increase the 
variety in the regulator or to decrease the variety in the system being regulated. It is 
not the case that the variety of the regulator must be identical to the variety of the 
system being regulated, but there is a strict mathematical (logarithmic) relationship 
between the two, and the regulator must contain sufficient variety to cope. Requisite 
variety has been one of Ashby’s most-used ideas and has been applied to problems 
as varied as content moderation at Facebook (Naughton 2019), safety management 
in nuclear power plants (Wahlström 2018) and industrial democracy in textile man-
ufacturing (Toprak and Torlak 2018).
Variety was not the only way in which Ashby was interested in complex systems. 
As he argues, cybernetics “offers a method for the scientific treatment of the system 
in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be ignored” (Ashby 1956, 
pp. 4–5). A key part of the modern understanding of complexity is the concept of 
self-organisation, a term coined by Ashby (1947), where he argues that “a machine 
can be at the same time (a) strictly determinate in its actions, and (b) yet demon-
strate a self-induced change of organisation” (p. 125), although in later work he 
argued that the concept is highly complex and needs great care if it is not to be 
interpreted glibly.
Most of the work described above was conducted while Ashby was working as a 
psychiatrist. In 1961, as described, he moved to full-time academia at the University 
of Illinois, a decade that “was in his own estimation the most fruitful period of his 
career” (Conant 1974). His work in that period, on detailed questions of the math-
ematics of cybernetics, has had considerable impact on his colleagues and students 
of the time (including Stuart Kauffman, who developed Ashby’s ideas in complexity 
5  W. Ross Ashby

45
theory) but less impact beyond those colleagues than did his earlier work. Ashby 
was an important part of the active research and teaching community at Illinois, but 
his role was not entirely obvious there. Pangaro (1988, p. 11) reports a story of 
Heinz von Foerster that “Ashby’s students came to him, Heinz, as head of the labo-
ratory, to complain of how simple the material was that their teacher, Ashby, was 
presenting. When Ashby was told this, his eyes lit up with pleasure as he replied, ‘It 
has taken me twenty years to make these ideas seem simple’.”
Ross Ashby laid the foundations for much of the later work in cybernetics and 
complexity theory, both as a theorist and as a builder of machines. Stafford Beer 
summarised his work as follows:
Ross Ashby had the great gift of continual innovation. Whenever he spoke, what he said 
was new. And always (for me at least) it was wildly exciting. He was in continual onslaught 
of the frontiers of knowledge until the last, and it will be many years until his latest work is 
disseminated and understood. (Beer 1973, p. 1).

Cybernetics was defined by Wiener as “the science of control and communica-
tion, in the animal and the machine” – in a word, as the art of steermanship, and it 
is to this aspect that the book will be addressed. Co-ordination, regulation and con-
trol will be its themes, for these are of the greatest biological and practical interest.
We must, therefore, make a study of mechanism; but some introduction is advis-
able, for cybernetics treats the subject from a new, and therefore unusual, angle. […] 
The new point of view should be clearly understood, for any unconscious vacilla-
tion between the old and the new is apt to lead to confusion.
The Peculiarities of Cybernetics
Many a book has borne the title “Theory of Machines”, but it usually contains infor-
mation about mechanical things, about levers and cogs. Cybernetics, too, is a “the-
ory of machines”, but it treats, not things but ways of behaving. It does not ask 
“what is this thing?” but “what does it do?” Thus it is very interested in such a 
statement as “this variable is undergoing a simple harmonic oscillation”, and is 
much less concerned with whether the variable is the position of a point on a wheel, 
or a potential in an electric circuit. It is thus essentially functional and 
behaviouristic.

Cybernetics started by being closely associated in many ways with physics, but 
it depends in no essential way on the laws of physics or on the properties of matter. 
Cybernetics deals with all forms of behaviour in so far as they are regular, or deter-
minate, or reproducible. The materiality is irrelevant, and so is the holding or not of 
the ordinary laws of physics. […] The truths of cybernetics are not conditional on 
their being derived from some other branch of science. Cybernetics has its own 
foundations. It is partly the aim of this book to display them clearly.
Cybernetics stands to the real machine – electronic, mechanical, neural, or eco-
nomic – much as geometry stands to a real object in our terrestrial space. There was 
a time when “geometry” meant such relationships as could be demonstrated on 
three-dimensional objects or in two-dimensional diagrams. The forms provided by 
the earth – animal, vegetable, and mineral – were larger in number and richer in 
properties than could be provided by elementary geometry. In those days a form 
which was suggested by geometry but which could not be demonstrated in ordinary 
space was suspect or inacceptable. Ordinary space dominated geometry.
Today the position is quite different. Geometry exists in its own right, and by its 
own strength. It can now treat accurately and coherently a range of forms and spaces 
that far exceeds anything that terrestrial space can provide. Today it is geometry that 
contains the terrestrial forms, and not vice versa, for the terrestrial forms are merely 
special cases in an all-embracing geometry.
The gain achieved by geometry’s development hardly needs to be pointed out. 
Geometry now acts as a framework on which all terrestrial forms can find their natu-
ral place, with the relations between the various forms readily appreciable. With this 
increased understanding goes a correspondingly increased power of control.
Cybernetics is similar in its relation to the actual machine. It takes as its subject-­
matter the domain of “all possible machines”, and is only secondarily interested if 
informed that some of them have not yet been made, either by Man or by Nature. 
What cybernetics offers is the framework on which all individual machines may be 
ordered, related and understood.
Cybernetics, then, is indifferent to the criticism that some of the machines it 
considers are not represented among the machines found among us. In this it fol-
lows the path already followed with obvious success by mathematical physics. This 
science has long given prominence to the study of systems that are well known to be 
non-existent – springs without mass, particles that have mass but no volume, gases 
that behave perfectly, and so on. To say that these entities do not exist is true; but 
their non-existence does not mean that mathematical physics is mere fantasy; nor 
does it make the physicist throw away his treatise on the Theory of the Massless 
Spring, for this theory is invaluable to him in his practical work. The fact is that the 
massless spring, though it has no physical representation, has certain properties that 
make it of the highest importance to him if he is to understand a system even as 
simple as a watch.
The biologist knows and uses the same principle when he gives to Amphioxus, or 
to some extinct form, a detailed study quite out of proportion to its present-day 
ecological or economic importance.

47
In the same way, cybernetics marks out certain types of mechanism as being of 
particular importance in the general theory; and it does this with no regard for 
whether terrestrial machines happen to make this form common. Only after the 
study has surveyed adequately the possible relations between machine and machine 
does it turn to consider the forms actually found in some particular branch of 
science.
In keeping with this method, which works primarily with the comprehensive and 
general, cybernetics typically treats any given, particular, machine by asking not 
“what individual act will it produce here and now?” but “what are all the possible 
behaviours that it can produce?”
It is in this way that information theory comes to play an essential part in the 
subject; for information theory is characterised essentially by its dealing always 
with a set of possibilities; both its primary data and its final statements are almost 
always about the set as such, and not about some individual element in the set.
This new point of view leads to the consideration of new types of problem. The 
older point of view saw, say, an ovum grow into a rabbit and asked “why does it do 
this – why does it not just stay an ovum?” The attempts to answer this question led 
to the study of energetics and to the discovery of many reasons why the ovum 
should change – it can oxidise its fat, and fat provides free energy; it has phosphory-
lating enzymes, and can pass its metabolises around a Krebs’ cycle; and so on. In 
these studies the concept of energy was fundamental.
Quite different, though equally valid, is the point of view of cybernetics. It takes 
for granted that the ovum has abundant free energy, and that it is so delicately poised 
metabolically as to be, in a sense, explosive. Growth of some form there will be; 
cybernetics asks “why should the changes be to the rabbit-form, and not to a dog-­
form, a fish-form, or even to a teratoma-form?” Cybernetics envisages a set of pos-
sibilities much wider than the actual, and then asks why the particular case should 
conform to its usual particular restriction. In this discussion, questions of energy 
play almost no part – the energy is simply taken for granted. Even whether the sys-
tem is closed to energy or open is often irrelevant; what is important is the extent to 
which the system is subject to determining and controlling factors. So no informa-
tion or signal or determining factor may pass from part to part without its being 
recorded as a significant event. Cybernetics might, in fact, be defined as the study of 
systems that are open to energy but closed to information and control – systems that 
are “information-tight”.
The Uses of Cybernetics
After this bird’s-eye view of cybernetics we can turn to consider some of the ways 
in which it promises to be of assistance. I shall confine my attention to the applica-
tions that promise most in the biological sciences. The review can only be brief and 
very general. Many applications have already been made and are too well known to 
need description here; more will doubtless be developed in the future. There are, 
Reading from Ashby’s work

48
however, two peculiar scientific virtues of cybernetics that are worth explicit 
mention.
One is that it offers a single vocabulary and a single set of concepts suitable for 
representing the most diverse types of system. Until recently, any attempt to relate 
the many facts known about, say, servo-mechanisms to what was known about the 
cerebellum was made unnecessarily difficult by the fact that the properties of servo-
mechanisms were described in words redolent of the automatic pilot, or the radio 
set, or the hydraulic brake, while those of the cerebellum were described in words 
redolent of the dissecting room and the bedside – aspects that are irrelevant to the 
similarities between a servo-mechanism and a cerebellar reflex. Cybernetics offers 
one set of concepts that, by having exact correspondences with each branch of sci-
ence, can thereby bring them into exact relation with one other.
It has been found repeatedly in science that the discovery that two branches are 
related leads to each branch helping in the development of the other. […] The result 
is often a markedly accelerated growth of both. The infinitesimal calculus and 
astronomy, the virus and the protein molecule, the chromosomes and heredity are 
examples that come to mind. Neither, of course, can give proofs about the laws of 
the other, but each can give suggestions that may be of the greatest assistance and 
fruitfulness. […] Here I need only mention the fact that cybernetics is likely to 
reveal a great number of interesting and suggestive parallelisms between machine 
and brain and society. And it can provide the common language by which discover-
ies in one branch can readily be made use of in the others.
The Complex System
The second peculiar virtue of cybernetics is that it offers a method for the scientific 
treatment of the system in which complexity is outstanding and too important to be 
ignored. Such systems are, as we well know, only too common in the biologi-
cal world!
In the simpler systems, the methods of cybernetics sometimes show no obvious 
advantage over those that have long been known. It is chiefly when the systems 
become complex that the new methods reveal their power.
Science stands today on something of a divide. For two centuries it has been 
exploring systems that are either intrinsically simple or that are capable of being 
analysed into simple components. The fact that such a dogma as “vary the factors 
one at a time” could be accepted for a century, shows that scientists were largely 
concerned in investigating such systems as allowed this method; for this method is 
often fundamentally impossible in the complex systems. Not until Sir Donald 
Fisher’s work in the 1920s, with experiments conducted on agricultural soils, did it 
become clearly recognised that there are complex systems that just do not allow the 
varying of only one factor at a time – they are so dynamic and interconnected that 
the alteration of one factor immediately acts as cause to evoke alterations in others, 
perhaps in a great many others. Until recently, science tended to evade the study of 
5  W. Ross Ashby

49
such systems, focusing its attention on those that were simple and, especially, 
reducible.
In the study of some systems, however, the complexity could not be wholly 
evaded. The cerebral cortex of the free-living organism, the ant-hill as a functioning 
society, and the human economic system were outstanding both in their practical 
importance and in their intractability by the older methods. So today we see psycho-
ses untreated, societies declining, and economic systems faltering, the scientist 
being able to do little more than to appreciate the full complexity of the subject he 
is studying. But science today is also taking the first steps towards studying “com-
plexity” as a subject in its own right.
Prominent among the methods for dealing with complexity is cybernetics. It 
rejects the vaguely intuitive ideas that we pick up from handling such simple 
machines as the alarm clock and the bicycle, and sets to work to build up a rigorous 
discipline of the subject. For a time (as the first few chapters of this book will show) 
it seems rather to deal with truisms and platitudes, but this is merely because the 
foundations are built to be broad and strong. They are built so that cybernetics can 
be developed vigorously, without the primary vagueness that has infected most past 
attempts to grapple with, in particular, the complexities of the brain in action.
Cybernetics offers the hope of providing effective methods for the study, and 
control, of systems that are intrinsically extremely complex. It will do this by first 
marking out what is achievable (for probably many of the investigations of the past 
attempted the impossible), and then providing generalised strategies, of demon-
strable value, that can be used uniformly in a variety of special cases. In this way it 
offers the hope of providing the essential methods by which to attack the ills – psy-
chological, social, economic – which at present are defeating us by their intrinsic 
complexity. [This book] does not pretend to offer such methods perfected, but it 
attempts to offer a foundation on which such methods can be constructed, and a start 
in the right direction.

Chapter 6
Ludwig von Bertalanffy
Ludwig von Bertalanffy was the creator of general systems theory (GST)  – he 
coined the term, developed it in detail in his many writings, and was a key part of 
the group which took it forward and spread the concept. Indeed, the systems move-
ment would not have taken the form it did without Bertalanffy – for while holistic 
thinking has arisen in many places, it was Bertalanffy’s language and concepts that 
took hold as the core of systems thinking. He was ahead of his time, always far 
beyond conventional views, and for the second half of his life never quite found a 
place where he fitted in. A fellow-founder of GST describes him as “kindly, shy, 
[with] a curious mixture of confidence that he was saying something important and 
diffidence that grew out of the lack of people to receive it” (Boulding 1983, p. 19). 
His first biographer described him as “the least known intellectual titan of the twen-
tieth century” (Davidson 1983, p. 9).
Bertalanffy was as much a biologist as he was a systems thinker. In the 1920s, 
when biology was very largely an experimental science, he championed the role of 
theoretical biology, and developed quantitative models for it. He was one of the key 
early advocates of an ‘organismic’ conception of biology (focusing on the whole 
system of an organism). He also later carried out crucial experimental work on the 
diagnosis of cancer via cellular screening. Bertalanffy’s work on GST arose as an 
extension of his ideas in biology, of the organism as a whole and its openness to its 
environment, and while it may be too strong to say that GST is a “biological meta-
phor in disguise” (Morgan 1986, p. 45), it clearly has its roots in Bertalanffy’s bio-
logical work.
(Karl) Ludwig von Bertalanffy was born in 1901 near Vienna to a Catholic fam-
ily, and died of a heart attack in 1972 in the United States. His roots were in the 
Hungarian nobility (von signifies nobility in German), and he could trace his origins 
back to the mid-sixteenth century. He grew up and had his education in Vienna, 
where he lived until 1948, experiencing both the deep benefits and troubles of 
Austria in the first half of the twentieth century. The Vienna in which he was reared 
was still the intellectual and cultural heart of Europe. On the other hand, his family’s 
savings were destroyed by the economic collapse of the 1920s, his country was 

54
annexed by Nazi Germany, and large parts of the city (including his home) destroyed 
at the end of the Second World War. He married Maria in 1924, and they remained 
devoted to each other until his death – “the story of Ludwig von Bertalanffy became 
the story of Ludwig and Maria from the time of their first meeting” (Davidson 
1983, p. 51).
Bertalanffy took his PhD in physics and philosophy at the University of Vienna. 
His supervisor was Moritz Schlick, founder of the celebrated Vienna Circle who 
developed and championed the theory of logical positivism (which argued that 
empirical science was the only valid form of knowledge, and that discussion of 
values had no place in science). The Circle was also committed to a ‘unified sci-
ence’ with a common language in which all scientific principles could be expressed. 
Bertalanffy came to reject the reductionism and value-neutrality of the Vienna 
Circle, but was strongly influenced by the goal of unified science. On receiving his 
PhD in 1926, he became a professor at the University of Vienna, where he remained 
until 1948.
Bertalanffy spent a year from autumn 1937 to 1938 in the US, where he gave his 
first public presentation on GST, at the University of Chicago. During his time in the 
US, the Nazis annexed Austria, and as the situation in Austria and Germany wors-
ened, American funds for visiting scholars were principally allocated to those expe-
riencing direct persecution, which did not apply to Bertalanffy. He tried to have his 
funding extended, but was unsuccessful and he therefore returned to Vienna, where 
he spent the war years as an academic.
He joined the Nazi party in 1938, largely for opportunistic reasons to enable him 
to continue his career. Bertalanffy was not an active member of the party and had no 
involvement in the military, though he did publish one article in 1941 that made a 
link between his theories and Nazi ideas. There is little doubt that his social conser-
vatism and dislike for the modern world sat well with the party, but David Pouvreau 
(2009), who has thoroughly researched Bertalanffy’s letters, concludes that, except 
in a very limited aspect of his organismic biology, “there was no contribution on his 
part to the ‘oeuvre’ of the Hitler regime” (p. 66). The impact of Bertalanffy’s Nazi 
links upon his later ideas, notwithstanding his strong humanistic approach, may yet 
require further exploration.
After the war, Austria’s economy was almost destroyed and Bertalanffy suffered 
considerable hardship. During the siege of Vienna at the end of the war, and the 
scorched earth policy practiced by retreating Nazi soldiers, most his possessions, 
including his library and several unpublished manuscripts were destroyed. Moreover, 
he was subject to a 2-year investigation during the ‘denazification’ programme, and 
while he was eventually exonerated, he returned to a lower academic status than he 
had previously held. As Pouvreau (2009, p. 93) observes, “Bertalanffy could not 
bear the humiliation that was imposed on him with the examination in the commit-
tee and the deterioration in his status, nor the relations within the university and the 
living conditions in Vienna”. This led him to seek an academic post outside Austria.
He moved in 1948 to Switzerland to complete his book Das Biologische Weltbild 
(Problems of Life), which was the fullest outline of his organismic biology. Through 
a biologist who had been highly influenced by his earlier work, Joseph Woodger, he

obtained a year’s stay at the University of London Medical School. While in London 
he received a grant to move to Canada as a professor of biology at the University of 
Ottawa, becoming a Canadian citizen in 1954. Crucially, he had a year’s fellowship 
in 1954–1955 at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Behavioural Sciences 
(CASBS) at Stanford, California, where he came together with the group who with 
him founded the Society for General Systems Research (the story of this founding 
is discussed further in the chapter on Kenneth Boulding). This society, later the 
International Society for the Systems Sciences, was never large but was highly 
influential in its development and propagation of GST. Bertalanffy co-edited its 
annual journal from the society’s inception in 1956 until his death.
After the CASBS, he moved every few years for the rest of his life to a different 
research institution – the Mt. Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles (co-director of biologi-
cal research) in 1955, at the Menninger Foundation (for psychiatry) in Kansas in 
1958, at the University of Edmonton (Alberta) from 1961 to 1969, lastly at the State 
University of New York. However, for all his life after leaving Austria, he was inse-
cure about where his next job would be found, and constantly looking for a position 
which he felt gave him sufficient esteem (Pouvreau 2009). He never let his col-
leagues in the systems movement know this: as Kenneth Boulding said, “if he had, 
some of us would have made an effort to get him a good, steady position … I don’t 
think anybody of my acquaintance ever knew the difficulties he was in” (quoted by 
Davidson 1983, p. 64).
Bertalanffy received considerable acclaim late in life, with a two volume 
Festschrift (celebration of his work), and a nomination for the Nobel Prize in 1972 
(though he died before the nomination could be considered). Posthumously he has 
been recognised in Vienna – a conference was held there in 2001 on the centenary 
of his birth, and the city now hosts the Bertalanffy Center for the Study of Systems 
Science, established in 2004 and site of a growing archive.
Bertalanffy’s organismic biology, on which he first published in the mid-1920s, 
“emphasises consideration of the organism as a whole or system, and sees the main 
objective of biological sciences in the discovery of the principle of organisation at 
its various levels” (von Bertalanffy 1973, p. 10). The key aspects of this definition – 
the importance of the whole system, and the idea that the distinction between a 
system and a collection of parts is that the system has some form of organisation of 
its parts – would recur many times in his work. Organismic biology stood against 
the prevailing mechanistic consensus in biology – treating biological phenomena as 
entirely explainable through physics and chemistry. However, it rejected the alterna-
tive theory of vitalism, which held that there was some mysterious underlying force 
to explain the complexity of life. Bertalanffy argued that vitalism was insufficient 
and still grounded in a reductionist worldview, although he drew upon some con-
cepts developed by the vitalist biologist Hans Driesch, notably equifinality which 
observes that the same end point (in the development of an organism) may be 
reached in various different ways from different starting points.
Bertalanffy’s work on organismic biology developed further in his use in 1932 of 
the concept of the organism as an open system, an idea he took originally from 
thermodynamics. An open system has a clear boundary, and thus a distinction 
6  Ludwig von Bertalanffy

56
between the inside of the system and the outside (its environment), but it is possible 
for both matter and energy to cross the boundary; by contrast, in a closed system it 
is only possible for energy to cross the boundary. von Bertalanffy (1950, p. 23) 
wrote that “living systems are open systems, maintaining themselves in exchange of 
materials with environment, and in continuous building up and breaking down of 
their components”.
Such a system is not in a traditional state of equilibrium, in that it is constantly 
changing, and yet it retains its basic form. Bertalanffy referred to this situation as 
‘dynamic equilibrium’ (the original German term was Fliessgleichgewicht), 
although in one of his mostly widely-read English-language articles on the subject 
(von Bertalanffy 1950), he used the term ‘steady state’. For Bertalanffy, the dyna-
mism and evolution of this state was the crucial part, but many critics (then and 
now) have connected this with conventional forms of static equilibrium, which 
emphasise continuity and conservatism. The concept of dynamic equilibrium – that 
a system needs to constantly change its component parts to maintain its basic form 
of organisation – is a highly important one. Bertalanffy developed this concept in 
very precise mathematical form, which has been used by a number of other authors, 
notably the complexity theorist Ilya Prigogine in his later work on non-equilibrium 
thermodynamics (discussed in the chapter on Prigogine).
It was the application of the idea of the open system to wider situations that led 
Bertalanffy to develop GST, his aim being “to determine principles that applied to 
systems in general, to classify logically different types of systems, and to work out 
mathematical models for describing them, with the ultimate aim of unifying sci-
ence” (Hammond 2003, p. 117). He initially presented these ideas in a seminar 
while visiting the University of Chicago in 1937; the cool reception to the ideas led 
him not to write them up for publication until 1945, and in fact it took until 1949 
before his ideas appeared in print. By this time, the concept of the whole system was 
much more common and acceptable, not least through the wide use of interdisci-
plinary teams in wartime.
The term ‘general system theory’ (the use of the plural ‘systems’ came later) was 
coined by Bertalanffy as a translation, with which he was later unhappy, of his 
German term Allgemeine Systemlehre. The German term implies a theory of sys-
tems which is applicable in many different fields, while the English term is more 
ambiguous and can be taken to imply that there is such an entity as a ‘general sys-
tem’ about which he was presenting a theory. In fact, his goal was a general theory 
of systems as opposed to a theory of general systems. This is not purely a semantic 
issue, but is in fact crucial to a common misunderstanding of Bertalanffy’s work: he 
was not seeking to present an all-encompassing theory of everything, but rather a set 
of common principles that could be applied in different places. As a result of these 
concerns, Pouvreau and Drack (2007) have proposed the term ‘General Systemology’ 
as a better term for Bertalanffy’s work, a phrase that has been endorsed by a number 
of other systems scholars (e.g. Rousseau et al. 2016).
Bertalanffy’s ideas, especially those of open systems, dynamic equilibrium and 
organisation, were applied by very many others working in biology, psychology, 
management and physics (see, for example, the chapters of this book on Eric Trist 
6  Ludwig von Bertalanffy

57
and Ilya Prigogine). More controversially, his ideas were picked up in the 1950s and 
1960s by the developers of techniques of systems analysis/engineering and made 
the intellectual foundation for that work, whose origins lay in military and industrial 
planning. As these techniques had considerable influence in ways that critics saw as 
dehumanising, Bertalanffy’s ideas gained a degree of negative association, such as 
in Robert Lilienfeld’s staunch critique of systems theory (1978).
In fact, this association was very unfair. Bertalanffy’s own worldview was 
strongly humanistic, and from his early days as a critic of the Vienna Circle he was 
a strong advocate of the role of values and ethics in science. He also did consider-
able work on applying his ideas to psychology, challenging what he referred to as 
the dehumanising ‘robot model’ of behaviourist psychology and functionalist soci-
ology, writing: “if the principle of homeostatic maintenance is taken as a golden rule 
of behaviour, the so-called well-adjusted individual will be the ultimate goal, this is 
a well-oiled robot maintaining itself in optimal biological, psychological, and social 
homeostasis” (von Bertalanffy 1973, p. 115).
This critique of homeostasis (negative feedback) was also central to Bertalanffy’s 
keenness to differentiate GST from cybernetics, which emphasised homeostasis and 
thus in Bertalanffy’s view did not have a model of social change. While this is 
undoubtedly true for some applications of cybernetics, other researchers have used 
cybernetic principles in the service of social change (such as Margaret Mead and 
Gregory Bateson). Indeed, Norbert Wiener himself had a highly humanistic out-
look, somewhat at odds with the mechanistic approach often taken by the movement 
he developed (as discussed in the chapter on Wiener). Bertalanffy acknowledged 
cybernetics and systems analysis as legitimate parts of a wider systems movement – 
essentially as special cases of GST – but felt the need to distance himself from some 
of their ideas.
As his work on GST developed, Bertalanffy became more aware of the wider 
philosophical implications of his ideas. Indeed, Rousseau et al. (2016) identify no 
less than sixteen ways in which Bertalanffy used the term GST in his writings, and 
as Thayer (2015) argues, “[GST] was less a theory and more a way of thinking 
about things” (p. 71). Ultimately, he argued that GST was best considered as a new 
paradigm in thinking, with profound epistemological implications. In particular, he 
believed that GST demonstrated the obsolescence of the logical positivists’ view 
that it is possible to reduce all knowledge to physics. He wrote that knowledge “is 
an interaction between knower and known, this dependent on a multiplicity of fac-
tors of a biological, psychological, cultural, linguistic, etc., nature. … This led to a 
‘perspective’ philosophy for which physics, fully acknowledging its achievements 
in its own and related fields, is not a monopolistic way of knowledge” (von 
Bertalanffy 1973, p. xxi).
It is hard to over-estimate the importance of Ludwig von Bertalanffy to the devel-
opment of systems thinking. He was one of the first thinkers to explicitly identify 
the importance of thinking in terms of systems, across all disciplines and all types 
of system. He gave the field its basic name, many of its core concepts and a common 
language (although more in terms of words than the mathematics he sought to use).

Bertalanffy was never an easy or comfortable man, but he was a profound and 
important thinker. Hammond (2003, p. 133) sums up his work as follows:
Bertalanffy’s GST was an attempt to articulate a more inclusive and global perspective. In 
his view, the most important characteristic of open, living systems was their capacity for 
creativity and self-transcendence. While seeking patterns of organisation that were appli-
cable at different levels of organisation, Bertalanffy still preserved a place for the individual 
and the particular as an essential component for social organisation.

Modern science is characterized by its ever-increasing specialization, necessi-
tated by the enormous amount of data, the complexity of techniques and of theoreti-
cal structures within every field. Thus science is split into innumerable disciplines 
continually generating new subdisciplines. In consequence, the physicist, the biolo-
gist, the psychologist and the social scientist are, so to speak, encapsulated in their 
private universes, and it is difficult to get word from one cocoon to the other.
This, however, is opposed by another remarkable aspect. Surveying the evolution 
of modern science, we encounter a surprising phenomenon. Independently of each 
other, similar problems and conceptions have evolved in widely different fields.
It was the aim of classical physics eventually to resolve natural phenomena into 
a play of elementary units governed by “blind” laws of nature. This was expressed 
in the ideal of the Laplacean spirit which, from the position and momentum of par-
ticles, can predict the state of the universe at any point in time. This mechanistic 
view was not altered but rather reinforced when deterministic laws in physics were 
replaced by statistical laws. According to Boltzmann’s derivation of the second 
principle of thermodynamics, physical events are directed toward states of maxi-
mum probability, and physical laws, therefore, are essentially “laws of disorder”, 
the outcome of unordered, statistical events. In contrast to this mechanistic view, 
however, problems of wholeness, dynamic interaction and organization have 
appeared in the various branches of modern physics. In the Heisenberg relation and 
quantum physics, it became impossible to resolve phenomena into local events; 
problems of order and organization appear whether the question is the structure of 
atoms, the architecture of proteins, or interaction phenomena in thermodynamics. 
Similarly biology, in the mechanistic conception, saw its goal in the resolution of 
life phenomena into atomic entities and partial processes. The living organism was 
resolved into cells, its activities into physiological and ultimately physicochemical 
processes, behavior into unconditioned and conditioned reflexes, the substratum of 
heredity into particulate genes, and so forth. In contradistinction, the organismic

conception is basic for modern biology. It is necessary to study not only parts and 
processes in isolation, but also to solve the decisive problems found in the organiza-
tion and order unifying them, resulting from dynamic interaction of parts, and mak-
ing the behavior of parts different when studied in isolation or within the whole. 
Again, similar trends appeared in psychology. While classical association psychol-
ogy attempted to resolve mental phenomena into elementary units – psychological 
atoms as it were – such as elementary sensations and the like, gestalt psychology 
showed the existence and primacy of psychological wholes which are not a summa-
tion of elementary units and are governed by dynamic laws. Finally, in the social 
sciences the concept of society as a sum of individuals as social atoms, e.g., the 
model of Economic Man, was replaced by the tendency to consider society, econ-
omy, nation as a whole superordinated to its parts. This implies the great problems 
of planned economy, of the deification of nation and state, but also reflects new 
ways of thinking.
This parallelism of general cognitive principles in different fields is even more 
impressive when one considers the fact that those developments took place in 
mutual independence and mostly without any knowledge of work and research in 
other fields.
There is another important aspect of modern science. Up to recent times, exact 
science, the corpus of laws of nature, was almost identical with theoretical physics. 
Few attempts to state exact laws in non-physical fields have gained recognition. 
However, the impact of and progress in the biological, behavioral and social sci-
ences seem to make necessary an expansion of our conceptual schemes in order to 
allow for systems of laws in fields where application of physics is not sufficient or 
possible.
Such a trend towards generalized theories is taking place in many fields and in a 
variety of ways. For example, an elaborate theory of the dynamics of biological 
populations, the struggle for existence and biological equilibria, has developed, 
starting with the pioneering work by Lotka and Volterra. The theory operates with 
biological notions, such as individuals, species, coefficients of competition, and the 
like. A similar procedure is applied in quantitative economics and econometrics. 
The models and families of equations applied in the latter happen to be similar to 
those of Lotka or, for that matter, of chemical kinetics, but the model of interacting 
entities and forces is again at a different level. To take another example: living 
organisms are essentially open systems, i.e., systems exchanging matter with their 
environment. Conventional physics and physical chemistry dealt with closed sys-
tems, and only in recent years has theory been expanded to include irreversible 
processes, open systems, and states of disequilibrium. If, however, we want to apply 
the model of open systems to, say, the phenomena of animal growth, we automati-
cally come to a generalization of theory referring not to physical but to biological 
units. In other words, we are dealing with generalized systems. The same is true of 
the fields of cybernetics and information theory which have gained so much interest 
in the past few years.
Thus, there exist models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems 
or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their ­component

60
elements, and the relations or “forces” between them. It seems legitimate to ask for 
a theory, not of systems of a more or less special kind, but of universal principles 
applying to systems in general.
In this way we postulate a new discipline called General System Theory. Its sub-
ject matter is the formulation and derivation of those principles which are valid for 
“systems” in general.
The meaning of this discipline can be circumscribed as follows. Physics is con-
cerned with systems of different levels of generality. It extends from rather special 
systems, such as those applied by the engineer in the construction of a bridge or of 
a machine; to special laws of physical disciplines, such as mechanics or optics; to 
laws of great generality, such as the principles of thermodynamics that apply to 
systems of intrinsically different nature, mechanic, caloric, chemical or whatever. 
Nothing prescribes that we have to end with the systems traditionally treated in 
physics. Rather, we can ask for principles applying to systems in general, irrespec-
tive of whether they are of physical, biological or sociological nature. If we pose 
this question and conveniently define the concept of system, we find that models, 
principles, and laws exist which apply to generalized systems irrespective of their 
particular kind, elements, and the “forces” involved.
A consequence of the existence of general system properties is the appearance of 
structural similarities or isomorphisms in different fields. There are correspon-
dences in the principles that govern the behavior of entities that are, intrinsically, 
widely different. To take a simple example, an exponential law of growth applies to 
certain bacterial cells, to populations of bacteria, of animals or humans, and to the 
progress of scientific research measured by the number of publications in genetics 
or science in general. The entities in question, such as bacteria, animals, men, books, 
etc., are completely different, and so are the causal mechanisms involved. 
Nevertheless, the mathematical law is the same. Or there are systems of equations 
describing the competition of animal and plant species in nature. But it appears that 
the same systems of equations apply in certain fields in physical chemistry and in 
economics as well. This correspondence is due to the fact that the entities concerned 
can be considered, in certain respects, as “systems”, i.e., complexes of elements 
standing in interaction. The fact that the fields mentioned, and others as well, are 
concerned with “systems”, leads to a correspondence in general principles and even 
in special laws when the conditions correspond in the phenomena under 
consideration.
In fact, similar concepts, models and laws have often appeared in widely differ-
ent fields, independently and based upon totally different facts. There are many 
instances where identical principles were discovered several times because the 
workers in one field were unaware that the theoretical structure required was already 
well developed in some other field. General system theory will go a long way 
towards avoiding such unnecessary duplication of labor.
System isomorphisms also appear in problems which are recalcitrant to quantita-
tive analysis but are nevertheless of great intrinsic interest. There are, for example, 
isomorphies between biological systems and “epiorganisms” (Gerard) like animal 
communities and human societies. Which principles are common to the several 
6  Ludwig von Bertalanffy

61
­levels of organization and so may legitimately be transferred from one level to 
another, and which are specific so that transfer leads to dangerous fallacies? Can 
societies and civilizations be considered as systems?
It seems, therefore, that a general theory of systems would be a useful tool pro-
viding, on the one hand, models that can be used in, and transferred to, different 
fields, and safeguarding, on the other hand, from vague analogies which often have 
marred the progress in these fields.
There is, however, another and even more important aspect of general system 
theory. It can be paraphrased by a felicitous formulation due to the well-known 
mathematician and founder of information theory, Warren Weaver. Classical phys-
ics, Weaver said, was highly successful in developing the theory of unorganized 
complexity. Thus, for example, the behavior of a gas is the result of the unorganized 
and individually untraceable movements of innumerable molecules; as a whole it is 
governed by the laws of thermodynamics. The theory of unorganized complexity is 
ultimately rooted in the laws of chance and probability and in the second law of 
thermodynamics. In contrast, the fundamental problem today is that of organized 
complexity. Concepts like those of organization, wholeness, directiveness, teleol-
ogy, and differentiation are alien to conventional physics. However, they pop up 
everywhere in the biological, behavioral and social sciences, and are, in fact, indis-
pensable for dealing with living organisms or social groups. Thus a basic problem 
posed to modern science is a general theory of organization. General system theory 
is, in principle, capable of giving exact definitions for such concepts and, in suitable 
cases, of putting them to quantitative analysis.

Kenneth Boulding
Kenneth Boulding was an economist and one of the founders of general systems 
theory. He led a long and varied life, being involved in the founding of peace studies 
as well as general systems, writing volumes of poetry as well as many academic 
books, and making a significant contribution to ecology and social theory as well as 
his original field of economics. He was a broad-minded and diverse thinker who did 
much both to embody a systems approach across his many disciplines, and to influ-
ence systems thinking through his work. Elise Boulding (1995, p. 259), his wife, 
wrote that:
Kenneth delighted in life. Nothing was too small to escape his absorbed attention. He 
always carried a tiny but powerful magnifying glass in his pocket so he could absorb details 
invisible to the naked eye of any object. By the same token, nothing was too large or too far 
away to escape his interest. At night he would mount his trusty telescope on the porch and 
lose himself in the stars. … Ironically, his way of seeing things was so unique that what 
people remember best about Kenneth was the unexpectedness of his observations, the 
unusual connections his mind was always making. Kenneth’s mind at work was a mind at 
play.
Kenneth Ewart Boulding was born in 1910 in Liverpool, growing up in a com-
paratively poor working-class family (Scott 2015). He was able to obtain scholar-
ships to school in Liverpool and then to university in Oxford, where he took a degree 
in Philosophy, Politics and Economics in 1931. Also in 1931, he joined the Religious 
Society of Friends (Quakers), of which he was an active member for the rest of his 
life, and which served as a focus and support for his deep religious faith, his convic-
tion of the worth of all people, and his pacifism. Obtaining a Commonwealth 
Fellowship, he studied economics for 3 years at the University of Chicago (initially 
towards a Ph.D., though he never gained that qualification). Returning to the UK, he 
taught for 3 years at the University of Edinburgh. In 1937 he was offered a job at 
Colgate University, in upstate New York, and never again lived in the UK, taking 
American citizenship in 1948.
In 1941, Boulding married Elise Biorn-Hansen, a Norwegian-turned-American, 
who herself became a very significant academic within sociology (of families) and 

64
peace studies. Kenneth and Elise were to have five children together, and they 
became key supporters of each others’ academic work – although as Boulding and 
Scott (2018) observe, they disagreed on issues of social and racial justice with 
Kenneth being more politically conservative and Elise more radical. Boulding was 
never a political partisan and drew inspiration from various parts of the political 
spectrum. He once said, about opposition to one of his academic appointments: 
“They thought I was a dangerous radical. Actually, I am a dangerous conservative.” 
(Mott 2000, p. F436). He was concerned with ‘human betterment’ (the title of one 
of his books), and had an unshakeable optimism about the human condition, as part 
of his pacifism – but also, as Galtung (1987) observed, he was somewhat oblivious 
to structural inequality and violence, issues of exploitation and repression through 
societal forces. A colleague from Boulding’s middle years (Singer 1998) remarks 
that he and Elise were:
towers of strength, whose goodness, integrity, generosity and energy sustained many of us. 
Their home was a little chaotic, with a steady flow of visitors, local friends of all stripes, 
professions, and ages, exciting discussions, frequent potluck suppers, and an irresistible 
mix of goodwill and serious purpose.
For most of the 1940s, the Bouldings moved around North America: to Princeton 
where Kenneth worked for a year with the economic and financial section of the 
League of Nations (from which he resigned during a controversy over a public state-
ment he wrote on disarmament); then to Fisk University for a year; and to Iowa 
State College from 1943–1949. In 1949, Boulding settled for almost 20 years at the 
University of Michigan, just then beginning to be an important centre for the social 
sciences. His main post was in Economics, but during much of the 1960s he also 
was director or co-director of the newly-established Centre for Research on Conflict 
Resolution. In 1968, Boulding moved to the University of Colorado, where he was 
based for the rest of his life. He retired in 1980, but was an emeritus professor at 
Colorado until his death in 1993.
As well as these full-time posts, he also had a number of visiting fellowships and 
chairs. The most important of these from a systems perspective was a year 
(1954–1955) at the Centre for Advanced Study in the Behavioural Sciences in 
Stanford, California, during which time the ideas which led to the founding of gen-
eral systems germinated. Other visiting positions included universities in Jamaica, 
Tokyo and Texas. After his retirement he held many visiting positions in universities 
around the world. He received honorary degrees from 36 universities; he was a fel-
low of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical 
Society, the (US) National Academy of Sciences, and the British Academy. Most 
unusually, he was nominated for Nobel prizes in both economics and peace, though 
he was not awarded either prize; Elise Boulding was also nominated for the Nobel 
prize for peace, on a separate occasion from Kenneth.
Boulding published a large collection of writing on many themes, publishing 30 
books (most of them single-authored) and so many articles that his Collected Papers 
runs into six volumes. His first book was published in 1941 (when he was 31), and 
his last after his death. Many of his books were dictated and then subsequently

typed with little revision, leading to a highly discursive writing style. As well as his 
academic writing, he published four books of sonnets and several pamphlets and 
books on religious themes; and a collection of his aphorisms, sketches and short 
poetry was edited by a former student (Beilock 1980).
His work in economics moved him from fairly conventional Keynsianism in the 
1930s to reject a mechanistic approach to economics based on theories of market 
equilibrium, and rather to develop an open systems and evolutionary perspective on 
economics. He was also a key founder of peace studies as a field of academic study 
(along with other pioneers of systems thinking, notably Anatol Rapoport), and of 
the Journal of Conflict Research in 1957 – indeed he published more in this field 
than any other area (Mott 2000).
Boulding always regarded himself as an economist, and his academic posts were 
always based in that discipline. Indeed in 1949 he received the American Economics 
Association’s highly prestigious Clark medal, awarded every second year to the 
most outstanding economist under the age of 40. However, his shift to general sys-
tems with its biological heritage in Bertalanffy’s work was treated with great suspi-
cion by the economics establishment. Boulding recalled meeting a young man at a 
conference who said, “my professor warned me about you – you sold your soul to 
the biologists” to which he replied, “well I didn’t sell it cheap” (Boulding 1985a, 
p. 4). He was president of the American Economic Association in 1969. However he 
was sidelined by the dominant approaches to economics, writing that:
In many ways I see myself as a voice crying in the wilderness, to which nobody 
has paid much attention. In spite of the fact that I see myself as not much of a radi-
cal, being closer to the ‘main line’ of economic thought that goes from Adam Smith 
to Ricardo, Mill, Marshall, and Keynes, in terms of the reception of my ideas I feel 
much closer to the heretics. (Boulding 1971, p. viii).
The rest of this chapter focuses on Boulding’s contributions to the development 
of general systems theory as a discipline. These can be thought of as fourfold: the 
importance of level, his part in founding general systems as a field, the addition of 
a phenomenological perspective, and work on the integration of the social sciences.
First, Boulding was the originator of the modern concept of the systems hierar-
chy, identifying a series of levels under which one could analyse systems, with the 
suggestion that systems at one level could be regarded as subsystems embedded 
within the higher levels (Boulding 1956a). In this paper, Boulding identifies nine 
levels of system – these are detailed in the reading in this chapter. While others 
would later create more comprehensive frameworks, notably the very detailed work 
of James G. Miller (1978), Boulding was the first to introduce the concept of a sys-
tems hierarchy and his approach had great influence in subsequent work in systems 
thinking. As Wilby (2006) observes, Boulding never directly returned to the same 
framework in his later writings, but many of his subsequent books look at the world 
at multiple levels.
Second, Boulding was a co-founder of the Society for General Systems Research 
(SGSR). He was one of the four people who met at a celebrated lunch in the autumn 
of 1954 at the Centre for Advanced Study in the Behavioural Sciences (the others 
being Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Anatol Rapoport and Ralph Gerard), which led to a 
7  Kenneth Boulding

meeting the following year at the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science (which 70 people attended) and in 1956 to the founding of the 
SGSR. Boulding was the Society’s president for its first 2 years. In fact, Boulding 
had corresponded with Bertalanffy for the previous 2 years, and Hammond (1995, 
p. 286) suggests that Boulding was responsible for Bertalanffy being asked to be a 
fellow at the Centre for Advanced Study. Hammond also describes a letter from 
Boulding to Bertalanffy in November 1953 asking “whether or not he though the 
time was ripe for the formation of a society to promote General System Theory”.
In the words of Banathy (1995, p. 257), the SGSR had two initial questions at its 
heart: “what would happen if science could be redefined by crossing disciplinary 
boundaries and forging a unified theory of scientific inquiry?” and “how can we 
place science in the service of society?” Both of these questions strongly reflect 
Boulding’s concerns up to that point, and “science in service of humanity” was the 
SGSR’s initial slogan.
Boulding’s third major contribution to systems thinking was his introduction of 
a phenomenological perspective. This was developed in his book The Image 
(Boulding 1956b), written at the end of his year at the Centre for Advanced Study 
in the Behavioural Sciences. In this book, he advances a theory of knowledge which 
says that all our experiences of the world are mediated through the mental filter of 
our understanding. He writes that: “for any individual organism or organization, 
there are no such things as ‘facts’. There are only messages filtered through a 
changeable value system” (Boulding 1956b, p. 14). His concern is not with the truth 
or otherwise of our mental images, rather the process by which they are built up – 
his work could thus be said to belong to the sociology of knowledge rather than to 
philosophy. However, his book discusses the way in which mental images are devel-
oped within the individual and the group across a range of fields (organizations, 
biology, society, economics, politics, history etc.). The book was widely read but 
had little direct impact at the time of its publication. However it has subsequently 
been one of Boulding’s most cited works and had considerable subsequent impact 
upon soft systems thinking through the work of Geoffrey Vickers.
A final systemic strand of Boulding’s work, which became particularly pro-
nounced in his later writing, concerned the integration of the social sciences. In 
Boulding (1985a, p. 3) he argued, half-jokingly, that “general systems divided into 
two branches just a little way up the trunk: one, special general systems, which went 
in for mathematical modelling; and the other, general general systems … with its 
interest in homology and the perception of structural similarities in different parts of 
the empirical world”. He suggested that his own work fell into the latter category 
and that it “comes out of ecology, economics and evolutionary theory, and looks at 
the world as a set of ecological interactions, populations of different species under 
conditions of constantly changing parameters”. In books such as Ecodynamics 
(Boulding 1978) and The World as a Total System (Boulding 1985b), he took a very 
broad perspective on systems behaviour at many levels and from many conceptual 
perspectives. In successive chapters of this latter book he considered the world vari-
ously as a physical, biological, social, economic, political, communication and 
evaluative system.

Within economics, this integrative work led him to be one of the key founders of 
two active sub-disciplines: ecological economics and evolutionary economics, both 
of which trace their origins partially back to Boulding’s work. It also led him to a 
sense of the finite nature of earth’s resources, considered as an economic system, 
writing a celebrated article entitled ‘The economics of the coming Spaceship Earth’ 
that a future would come when: “the earth has become a single spaceship, without 
unlimited reservoirs of anything, either for extraction or for pollution, and in which, 
therefore, man must find his place in a cyclical ecological system” (Boulding 
1966, p. 9).
The systemic economist Hazel Henderson (1995, p. 275) summarises his work in 
Ecodynamics as follows:
Boulding fearlessly attacks the central problems of epistemology and taxonomy: where to 
place boundaries in modelling systems, how to account for different system levels and 
dimensions and portray interdependencies; when to aggregate and when to dis-aggregate 
data, i.e. what are appropriate levels of detail in all such models – while recognizing that 
they all imply an observer with a specific position and vantage point in the universe.
In this way we can see Boulding’s work drawing together all its many strands – 
general systems, radical economics, phenomenology and peace studies. As 
Hammond (1995, p.  289) describes the combination: “his work highlights the 
importance of perception and his emphasis on integration is critical given the 
increasing fragmentation and polarization in the contemporary world”. Kenneth 
Boulding lived a life full of joy and optimism, a man whose focus on integration and 
the importance of focusing on whole systems was matched by his own integration 
and wholeness.

Two possible approaches to the organization of general systems theory suggest 
themselves, which are to be thought-of as complementary rather than competitive, 
or at least as two roads each of which is worth exploring. The first approach is to 
look over the empirical universe and to pick out certain general phenomena which 
are found in many different disciplines, and to seek to build up general theoretical 
models relevant to these phenomena. […].
A second possible approach to general systems theory is through the arrange-
ment of theoretical systems and constructs in a hierarchy of complexity, roughly 
corresponding to the complexity of the ‘individuals’ of the various empirical fields. 
This approach is more systematic than the first, leading towards a ‘system of sys-
tems’. It may not replace the first entirely, however, as there may always be impor-

68
tant theoretical concepts and constructs lying outside the systematic framework. I 
suggest below a possible arrangement of ‘levels’ of theoretical discourse.
	
(i)	 The first level is that of the static structure. It might be called the level of 
frameworks. This is the geography and anatomy of the universe – the patterns 
of electrons around a nucleus, the pattern of atoms in a molecular formula, the 
arrangement of atoms in a crystal, the anatomy of the gene, the cell, the plant, 
the animal, the mapping of the earth, the solar system, the astronomical uni-
verse. The accurate description of these frameworks is the beginning of orga-
nized theoretical knowledge in almost any field, for without accuracy in this 
description of static relationships no accurate functional or dynamic theory is 
possible. Thus the Copernican revolution was really the discovery of a new 
static framework for the solar system which permitted a simpler description 
of its dynamics.
	 (ii)	 The next level of systematic analysis is that of the simple dynamic system 
with predetermined, necessary motions. This might be called the level of 
clockworks. The solar system itself is of course the great clock of the universe 
from man’s point of view, and the deliciously exact predictions of the astrono-
mers are a testimony to the excellence of the clock which they study. Simple 
machines such as the lever and the pulley, even quite complicated machines 
like steam engines and dynamos fall mostly under this category. The greater 
part of the theoretical structure of physics, chemistry, and even of economics 
falls into this category. […]
	 (iii)	 The next level is that of the control mechanism or cybernetic system, which 
might be nicknamed the level of the thermostat. This differs from the simple 
stable equilibrium system mainly in the fact that the transmission and inter-
pretation of information is an essential part of the system. As a result of this 
the equilibrium position is not merely determined by the equations of the 
system, but the system will move to the maintenance of any given equilib-
rium, within limits. Thus the thermostat will maintain any temperature at 
which it can be set; the equilibrium temperature of the system is not deter-
mined solely by its equations. The trick here of course is that the essential 
variable of the dynamic system is the difference between an ‘observed’ or 
‘recorded’ value of the maintained variable and its ‘ideal’ value. If this differ-
ence is not zero the system moves so as to diminish it; thus the furnace sends 
up heat when the temperature as recorded is ‘too cold’ and is turned off when 
the recorded temperature is ‘too hot’. The homeostasis model, which is of 
such importance in physiology, is an example of a cybernetic mechanism, and 
such mechanisms exist through the whole empirical world of the biologist 
and the social scientist.
	 (iv)	 The fourth level is that of the ‘open system’, or self-maintaining structure. 
This is the level at which life begins to differentiate itself from not-life: it 
might be called the level of the cell. Something like an open system exists, of 
course, even in physico-chemical equilibrium systems; atomic structures 
maintain themselves in the midst of a throughput of electrons, molecular 
7  Kenneth Boulding

69
structures maintain themselves in the midst of a throughput of atoms. Flames 
and rivers likewise are essentially open systems of a very simple kind. As we 
pass up the scale of complexity of organization towards living systems, 
­however, the property of self-maintenance of structure in the midst of a 
throughput of material becomes of dominant importance. An atom or a mol-
ecule can presumably exist without throughput: the existence of even the sim-
plest living organism is inconceivable without ingestion, excretion and 
metabolic exchange. Closely connected with the property of self-maintenance 
is the property of self-reproduction. It may be, indeed, that self-reproduction 
is a more primitive or ‘lower level’ system than the open system, and that the 
gene and the virus, for instance, may be able to reproduce themselves without 
being open systems. It is not perhaps an important question at what point in 
the scale of increasing complexity ‘life’ begins. What is clear, however, is that 
by the time we have got to systems which both reproduce themselves and 
maintain themselves in the midst of a throughput of material and energy, we 
have something to which it would be hard to deny the title of ‘life’.
	 (v)	 The fifth level might be called the genetic-societal level; it is typified by the 
plant, and it dominates the empirical world of the botanist. The outstanding 
characteristics of these systems are first, a division of labor among cells to 
form a cell-society with differentiated and mutually dependent parts (roots, 
leaves, seeds, etc.), and second, a sharp differentiation between the genotype 
and the phenotype, associated with the phenomenon of equifinal or ‘blue-
printed’ growth. At this level there are no highly specialized sense organs and 
information receptors are diffuse and incapable of much throughput of infor-
mation – it is doubtful whether a tree can distinguish much more than light 
from dark, long days from short days, cold from hot.
	 (vi)	 As we move upward from the plant world towards the animal kingdom we 
gradually pass over into a new level, the ‘animal’ level, characterized by 
increased mobility, teleological behaviour, and self-awareness. Here we have 
the development of specialized information-receptors (eyes, ears, etc.) lead-
ing to an enormous increase in the intake of information; we have also a great 
development of nervous systems, leading ultimately to the brain, as an orga-
nizer of the information intake into a knowledge structure or ‘image’. 
Increasingly as we ascend the scale of animal life, behaviour is response not 
to a specific stimulus but to an ‘image’ or knowledge structure or view of the 
environment as a whole. This image is of course determined ultimately by 
information received into the organism; the relation between the receipt of 
information and the building up of an image however is exceedingly complex. 
It is not a simple piling up or accumulation of information received, although 
this frequently happens, but a structuring of information into something 
essentially different from the information itself. After the image structure is 
well established most information received produces very little change in the 
image – it goes through the loose structure, as it were, without hitting it, much 
as a sub-atomic particle might go through an atom without hitting anything. 
Sometimes however the information is ‘captured’ by the image and added to 
Reading from Boulding’s work

70
it, and sometimes the information hits some kind of a ‘nucleus’ of the image 
and a reorganization takes place, with far reaching and radical changes in 
behaviour in apparent response to what seems like a very small stimulus. The 
difficulties in the prediction of the behaviour of these systems arises largely 
because of this intervention of the image between the stimulus and the 
response.
	(vii)	 The next level is the ‘human’ level, that is of the individual human being 
considered as a system. In addition to all, or nearly all, of the characteristics 
of animal systems man possesses self consciousness, which is something dif-
ferent from mere awareness. His image, besides being much more complex 
than that even of the higher animals, has a self-reflexive quality – he not only 
knows, but knows that he knows. This property is probably bound up with the 
phenomenon of language and symbolism. It is the capacity for speech – the 
ability to produce, absorb, and interpret symbols, as opposed to mere signs 
like the warning cry of an animal – which most clearly marks man off from 
his humbler brethren. Man is distinguished from the animals also by a much 
more elaborate image of time and relationship; man is probably the only orga-
nization that knows that it dies, that contemplates in its behaviour a whole life 
span, and more than a life span. Man exists not only in time and space but in 
history, and his behaviour is profoundly affected by his view of the time pro-
cess in which he stands.
	(viii)	 Because of the vital importance for the individual man of symbolic images 
and behaviour based on them it is not easy to separate clearly the level of the 
individual human organism from the next level, that of social organizations. 
In spite of the occasional stories of feral children raised by animals, man iso-
lated from his fellows is practically unknown. So essential is the symbolic 
image in human behaviour that one suspects that a truly isolated man would 
not be ‘human’ in the usually accepted sense, though he would be potentially 
human. Nevertheless it is convenient for some purposes to distinguish the 
individual human as a system from the social systems which surround him, 
and in this sense social organizations may be said to constitute another level 
of organization. The unit of such systems is not perhaps the person – the indi-
vidual human as such – but the ‘role’ – that part of the person which is con-
cerned with the organization or situation in question, and it is tempting to 
define social organizations, or almost any social system, as a set of roles tied 
together with channels of communication. The interrelations of the role and 
the person however can never be completely neglected – a square person in a 
round role may become a little rounder, but he also makes the role squarer, 
and the perception of a role is affected by the personalities of those who have 
occupied it in the past. At this level we must concern ourselves with the con-
tent and meaning of messages, the nature and dimensions of value systems, 
the transcription of images into a historical record, the subtle symbolizations 
of art, music, and poetry, and the complex gamut of human emotion. The 
empirical universe here is human life and society in all its complexity and 
richness.

	 (ix)	 To complete the structure of systems we should add a final turret for transcen-
dental systems, even if we may be accused at this point of having built Babel 
to the clouds. There are however the ultimates and absolutes and the 
­inescapable unknowables, and they also exhibit systematic structure and rela-
tionship. It will be a sad day for man when nobody is allowed to ask questions 
that do not have any answers.

Chapter 8
Geoffrey Vickers
Sir Geoffrey Vickers was a lawyer and manager, and provides an outstanding exam-
ple of deep reflection after a long and varied career. He produced a series of impor-
tant and thought-provoking works in retirement, which had a strong influence upon 
the developing use of systems thinking in management, decision-making and poli-
tics. He had such an impact upon the work of the Systems group at the Open 
University that its seminar room for many years had a large photograph of Vickers 
gazing down upon all discussions. Many Open University course texts on systems 
thinking have begun with Vickers’ analogy between the lobster trap which creatures 
enter but cannot leave and thinking traps into which people fall: “a trap is a trap only 
for the creatures which cannot solve the problems it sets. Man traps are dangerous 
only in relation to the limitations of what men can see and value and do” (Vickers 
1972, p. 15).
The general systems pioneer Kenneth Boulding, who Vickers knew well and who 
had a strong influence on Vickers’ work, summed up his ideas as follows (Boulding 
1983, p. 8):
Vickers’ experience taught him that the real world is an endless dynamic flux, that all goals 
are transient, that equilibrium is a figment of the human imagination, even though a useful 
one, and that our images of facts and of evaluations are inextricably mixed and are formed 
mainly in an interactive learning process which he calls ‘appreciation’.
Sir Charles Geoffrey Vickers was born in 1894 to a family of Nottingham lace 
merchants – he grew up in Vickers St, named after an ancestor; and was educated at 
the public school Oundle and at the University of Oxford. Shortly after he arrived at 
Oxford, the First World War was declared and he was made an officer, fighting in a 
number of key battles and being awarded the Victoria Cross. He was even consid-
ered brave enough that his portrait appeared on a cigarette card. Curiously, a film in 
1936 named The Charge of the Light Brigade featured a fictional dashing young 
army officer by the name of Major Geoffrey Vickers (played by Errol Flynn), 
although there is no record of Vickers’ reaction to the film.

74
After the war, he trained as a lawyer and worked for 15 years as a partner in an 
influential London law firm, Slaughter and May. In the late 1930s he gradually 
become more interested in public affairs, launching a movement in the City of 
London called the Association for Service and Reconstruction, which Blunden 
(1984, p. 12) describes as ‘a move away from conventional liberalism towards a 
mild form of social democracy’ and subsequently joining a discussion group called 
The Moot concerned with education and social reconstruction, whose members 
included Karl Mannheim, T.S. Eliot, and Michael Polanyi.
It was only when the Second World War arrived that Vickers became a manager, 
as Director of Economic Intelligence at the Ministry of Economic Warfare. This was 
an important role in wartime Britain, and his leadership of the section of the minis-
try known as Enemy Branch transformed it “into a dedicated and effective intelli-
gence agency ranging across economic warfare in all its forms, and in the policy 
arena leading post-hostilities economic and industrial planning of civil administra-
tion of liberated Europe” (Davies 2016, p. 827). He was knighted for this work in 
1946, although Davies describes him as “the forgotten man of British intelligence”, 
not much celebrated after the war for his contribution.
Following the Second World War, Vickers spent 10 years as a director of the 
National Coal Board (NCB), first as legal adviser but for most of his time as “board 
member in charge of manpower, training, education, health and welfare” (Blunden 
1985, p. 108) – in modern terms, the director of human resources. At the time the 
NCB, then just established following the nationalisation of the coal industry in the 
post-war Labour government under Clement Attlee, was one of the largest employ-
ers in the UK, with nearly 800,000 staff. It was a time of great change in the indus-
try, which had been deeply divided by management and workers prior to 
nationalisation (Blunden 1985, p.  108). Vickers retired from the National Coal 
Board in 1955. The rest of his life was spent reflecting on his working life, building 
up a substantial body of ideas about management, governance and systems as a 
practitioner-turned-thinker. He was never formally affiliated to a university – his 
institutional affiliation on one paper (Vickers 1978) is simply shown as “Little 
Mead, Goring on Thames, Reading, Great Britain”, the house where he lived. 
However in his later years he had close connections with the Systems group at the 
Open University where he spoke at many summer schools and where his archives 
have been hosted since 2004 (Ison 2005); he also held a visiting professorship at 
Lancaster University. He received recognition from the systems community both 
during and after his life. He was president of the Society for General Systems 
Research in 1977 (now the International Society for the Systems Sciences), and 
their Vickers Memorial Award is still given annually to the best student paper at 
their conference. He received the first gold medal of the UK Systems Society. He 
died in 1982 – his last book (Vickers 1983) was completed in 1981 when he was 
aged 86, and published after his death.
His writing style is lucid but dense, very much the style of an educated Englishman 
of his time. Unlike many other prominent systems thinkers (though by no means 
all), he made little use of diagrams in his work, being entirely focused on words as 
a means of description and analysis. For someone who was so much part of the 
8  Geoffrey Vickers

75
British Establishment, he was a very approachable and humane person. Blunden 
(1985, p. 108) describes him as “a man of great personal charm and unusual class-
lessness, he once confessed to feeling more at home with the national executive of 
the National Union of Mineworkers than with his fellow Board members”. His 
grandson remembers him as follows (Miller 2005, p. 347):
My memories of Geoffrey are of someone who listened quietly and spoke with a careful 
choice of words. He was driven by an underlying feeling of wonder in the world, and saw 
himself as a modest part of an amazing whole. He was able to appreciate the very small and 
the very large and had an enormous appreciation of history and human experience.
Vickers’ work in systems thinking was always focused on the nature of human 
systems and decision-making, at many different levels: managerial, political and 
societal. He applied his ideas to many areas of human systems involving judgement, 
at organisational, social and global levels. His ideas were positive, open and demo-
cratic, as described by John Forester (1994, p. 72):
Sir Geoffrey Vickers never pretended that his analyses could be the last word. Rather, the 
remarkable freshness, insight, and productive and hopeful character of his writing lies pre-
cisely in its clear sense that here he is posing pressing questions for others to refine and 
pursue to enable further planning dialogue and the democratisation of policy-making.
In addressing these issues, he made a number of other important contributions to 
systems thinking. Three contributions stand out. First, he emphasises the key impor-
tance of relationships between people (or things) as a way of understanding sys-
tems. For Vickers, the heart of all human activity (especially in organisations) 
involves maintaining human relationships rather than seeking goals as in the tradi-
tional models of management. This was not intended as a soft or easy concept – he 
emphasised that individuals need to take personal responsibility for maintaining 
these relationships and for the stability of society, a view which as Adams et al. 
(1987) observe is at odds with the widespread idea of the ‘autonomous individual’. 
In an extraordinary letter written in 1924 to his son Burnell at the age of two (to be 
read to him later), Vickers argued that:
Human contacts are dangerous [because] they matter so much, and no one knows how 
much they matter. Even the most trivial meeting makes a difference, slight or lasting, to one 
or both. Intimate contacts make heaven and hell, they can heal and tear, kill and raise from 
the dead.
These contacts are the fields in which we succeed or fail. I believe that they matter far 
more than anything else in life. What we are is written on the people whom we have met 
and known, touched, loved, hated and passed by. It is the lives of others that testify for or 
against us, not our own. (quoted by Blunden 1984, p. 9)
Second, he argued that systems should be thought of as tools of understanding 
rather than a precise description of reality. It is only once we have a sense of the 
system as a device for understanding rather than a statement about the nature of the 
world, that it becomes possible to look at systems from multiple perspectives and to 
respect all of those perspectives as equally valid. Vickers was thus one of the first 
originators within systems thinking of the turn to a phenomenological perspective. 
Blunden (1985, p.  108) argues that “years before management thinkers such as 
8  Geoffrey Vickers

76
Checkland were to apply phenomenology to management, Vickers urged that it was 
not actions, but the meaning which men saw in actions, that was significant”. In 
doing this he drew explicitly upon the phenomenological work of Boulding (1956), 
but also upon his strong practical background in management and public life.
Vickers’ third and probably his most significant contribution was the concept of 
the appreciative system, a description of the ongoing process of sense-making over 
time. The individual has an understanding of the world which arises from their 
experiences and actions; this understanding feeds back into those experiences and 
actions, and changes over time as a result of the interaction of these. The concept of 
appreciation is hard to grasp, and as Blackmore (2005, p. 337) notes, Vickers “con-
textualized it differently in his different writings”. Nonetheless, in general he used 
the term to refer to a “combined judgement of value and fact” – “for facts are rele-
vant only by reference to some judgement of value and judgements of value are 
meaningful only in regard to some configuration of fact” (Vickers 1968, p. 198). 
This concept was important to Vickers because it formed an epistemological basis 
for the nature of ‘judgement’ (that is, of decision-making in organisations and social 
policy) which goes well beyond the rationalist approach to decision-making that 
was so prevalent in his time. An appreciative system is “a set of readinesses to dis-
tinguish some aspects of the situation rather than others and to classify and value 
these in this way rather than that … they seem to be organized as a whole, so inter-
related that a change in one part of the system is likely to affect and be dependent 
on changes elsewhere” (Vickers 1965, p. 67).
Appreciative systems had a considerable effect upon the development of the Soft 
Systems Methodology by Peter Checkland and others. Checkland and Casar (1986) 
discussed at length the importance of appreciative systems, and constructed a model 
of the process of appreciation (see Fig. 8.1). The flux of events and ideas (shown at 
the top of the model) unfolds and changes over time, and the process of appreciation 
is that of perceiving reality and making judgements about it, which leads to actions

that become part of the stream of events. They argue that in the process of apprecia-
tion, we are constantly perceiving reality and making judgements about it, although 
“the epistemology of the judgement-making will be one of relationship-managing 
rather than goal-seeking” (Checkland and Casar 1986, p. 5). This judgement-­making 
stems from standards about the nature of the world, and about values as to what is 
good and bad within it. These standards become modified as a result of previous 
acts of appreciation.
We have largely discussed in this chapter Vickers’ contribution to management 
and to systems thinking, as a practitioner and as an academic. He had many other 
aspects to his professional and intellectual life, notably in the area of law and public 
affairs – he wrote extensively on health issues and was chair of the research com-
mittee of the Mental Health Research Fund for 16 years. Just a decade after the 
formation of the National Health Service in the UK he wrote words that have proved 
very prescient:
At one point it was widely, if half-consciously, held that a health service was a self-limiting 
service. When the demands of health were fully met, there would be nothing more to do. 
Indeed, better preventive services might in time reduce the total resources needed to provide 
optimum health for all. It is clear, I think, that health services are not self-limiting in this 
sense. … Consciously or unconsciously we shall still have to decide what is to be the total 
volume of resources devoted to public health and how it is to be distributed between differ-
ent services, different needs, and different classes of beneficiary – for example, between the 
young and the old. These decisions will grow harder, not easier, with the passage of time. 
(Vickers 1958, p. 599)
Churchman (1984, p. v) argues that “the tradition he selected could be called ‘the 
law’, but with an emphasis on the ethical implications of legal processes”. As well 
as the ethical implications noted by Churchman, Vickers also had considerable con-
cern for the social implications of various legal and political processes. The range 
of his interests and the scope of his work can be sampled from the titles of some of 
Vickers’ papers in a posthumous collection edited at our own university (Open 
Systems Group 1984): “population policy, its scope and limits”; “the future of 
morality”; “violence, war and genocide”; “what sets the goals of public health?”; 
“ecology, planning, and the American dream”; “community medicine”; “industry, 
human relations, and mental health”; “the changing nature of the professions”.
Vickers’ work has similarly been applied in a wide range of fields after his death. 
In management and systems thinking his concept of appreciative systems has been 
especially influential, drawn upon by Checkland (2005) but also by Donald Schön 
(1984) and Eric Trist. His work has been taken up in a very broad range of fields, 
including learning and environmental decision making (Blackmore 2005); manage-
ment education (Dunlop and Radaelli 2016); city planning (Forester 1994); infor-
mation systems design (Boland and Lyytinen 2017); moral philosophy (Williams 
2005); and international conflict (Dando 1994). The breadth of fields to which 
Vickers’ work is applicable shows both his own wide range of interests and the 
general nature of his theories. Many of his ideas have grown still more relevant over 
time, such as his ideas around interdependence and the limits of individual action, 
summed up in the title of his book Freedom in a rocking boat (Vickers 1972).

Geoffrey Vickers was a remarkable man whose insights and interests continue to 
be highly relevant to today’s intellectual and practical problems. His personality and 
concerns were summed up in an introduction to another collection of his papers by 
American colleagues:
This was a man who cared – he cared about the concrete events and circumstances of the 
lived-in world of daily life, as well as the larger questions of the human enterprise. And he 
cared with a depth and exuberance and authenticity which was apparent, no doubt, to virtu-
ally everyone who spent any time in his presence. … It is fitting [that] his most durable 
intellectual legacy should be the concept of the appreciative system. His own appreciative 
system was one of the keenest, most refined, and most thoroughly integrated of any human 
being that we have had the pleasure to know. (Adams et al. 1987, p. xiii).

Extract from pages 12–17.
The most essential characteristic of an open system is that its form is more endur-
ing than the presence of the substances which constitute it at some moment of time. 
The Greek philosopher who said that we never step twice into the same river was, I 
think, being wilfully perverse in presenting an important truth. For he surely knew 
as well as anyone that a river is the name we give to a form; not to the water which 
happens to constitute it at some moment of time. All the other characteristics of 
open systems flow from this basic concern with form, rather than substance.
[…]
Of course the substances are conserved. The water which flows through the river 
will ultimately find its way back into the atmosphere through evaporation or transpi-
ration in the course of a passage in which it may have been part of many forms, 
including animal and vegetable forms. The forms, by contrast, are far from inde-
structible. On the other hand, if they survive, they tend to become more complex. 
The questions are how they endure long enough to earn a name; and how some of 
them elaborate their forms with the passage of time.
Some forms are imposed almost wholly by independent factors external to them-
selves – as the river is largely determined by the contours of its catchment area and 
the volume and distribution of its supply of water from rain and springs. Some 
sustain their form largely by internal directives and regulators, such as those which 
determine the growth and form of an animal and the levels of its internal heat and 
chemical constituents. Some owe their form to both factors, as where external fac-
tors are themselves changed by the behaviour of the form and react upon it to change 
it, as with men in a market place or on a battlefield. All these questions concerning 
the ways in which open systems preserve their form even through change are ques-
tions of regulation, the second focus of interest which naturally arises in the study 
of form.
8  Geoffrey Vickers

79
An open system seldom preserves its form absolutely unchanged even for a brief 
period. One major reason for this is that its regulation consists partly in correcting 
deviations from its ‘normal’ state and some deviation is usually required to signal 
the need for a regulatory act. But apart from this, no open system lasts for ever. Its 
stability can never be taken for granted; it fluctuates and it may at any time escape 
from even the minimal regulation needed to sustain it and dissolve or change into 
something else. The animal dies, the skater falls, the business goes into liquidation, 
the community is absorbed by another or scattered or destroyed by natural forces 
(like Pompeii) or more frequently by human forces (like Carthage). So the third 
focus of interest, a counterpart of the second, is stability, or rather the whole dimen-
sion from maximal stability to dissolution. With this we must associate a concern 
with growth. For growth involves change both within a system and in the relations 
between it and its surround and these changes are bound to affect stability unless the 
regulative process takes care of them. The growth of a human organism from a 
single cell into the immense complexity of its adult form could not be achieved 
except by a marvel of internal regulation including most refined timing. There is a 
radical difference between cancerous and organic growth.
Open systems, by definition, do not exist in isolation. They depend on complex 
exchanges with their surround; exchanges of matter, of energy, of information, and 
of other communications not conveniently included in the useful but very narrow 
concept of information. The variety and reliability of these exchanges vary vastly. 
The giant sloth does not ask much of its surround or offer much to it, by comparison 
with his human fellow creatures in cabinets and boardrooms.
The progress towards greater interdependence which comes with growth involves 
limitations as well as enlargements, for it involves both mutual and, far more, com-
plementary constraints and commitments. For example, the rights and duties of par-
ent to child, teacher to taught, even buyer to seller, are not identical with the converse 
rights and duties of the other members of each pair, except for a few, such as hon-
esty, respect, and compassion, which are regarded by the culture as the rights and 
duties of all. Moreover, as the individual and the systems to which he belongs 
become engaged in an increasingly complex net of interdependence, both the con-
straints and the commitments tend to impose more contradictory imperatives. 
Organization can mitigate this but not remove it. We must then add to our list of 
concerns the words interdependence, limitation and organization.
It is sobering to reflect that even three or four decades ago it was still possible for 
intelligent people to debate whether a ‘whole’ could possibly be more than the sum 
of its ‘parts’, and if so how. Today it is perfectly apparent, though not yet completely 
accepted, that every whole must necessarily be both more and less than the sum of 
its parts. It is less because its parts are constrained by being organized. They can no 
longer do some things which were open to them in their unorganized state. For 
example, the constituents of a dead body are free to combine in other forms, once 
the discipline of the living organism is relaxed. But they are also more than their 
sum because, when organized, they can do what they could not do alone or as an 
unorganized aggregate.
Reading from Vickers’ work

80
Thus the study of systems has validated the concept of organization and estab-
lished what was regarded as a heresy in the heyday of reductionism. At every new 
level of organization constraints and enablements emerge which could not have 
been detected or even predicted from a study of their constituent parts in isolation. 
Vitalism, the theory that the origin and phenomena of life are due to a vital principle 
or life force, as distinct from a purely chemical or physical force, was once a dreaded 
heresy; it is seen today as a name for one of the many steps in organization. 
Organisms do indeed behave differently from inorganic systems. They do not defy 
or elude or contradict the laws which govern their constituents but they add other 
and new regularities which are functions of their new level of organization. And this 
would remain no less true if we could synthesize them from their inorganic 
components.
Of what then do systems consist? They consist of relationships. Surely there 
must be objects, entities which support these relationships? It seems probable to me 
that the relationships are more basic than the entities related; that we abstract or 
infer these entities solely from our experience of relationships. To avoid such meta-
physical speculations let us agree that there are entities to be related. But they are 
curiously elusive and relative to the concerns which draw our attention to them. […]
Take a more elaborate example. To an architect a school is a building designed to 
accommodate and facilitate specified activities. Its siting is irrelevant except for 
physical features of the actual site. To a planner it is a service to a community and 
its location is important to its utility and convenience. To an educator it is a com-
munity of teachers and students assembled for a number of related purposes.
To an individual teacher it is a workplace, a responsibility, an opportunity, and a 
step in a teaching career. To the local sanitary engineer it is one among many gen-
erators of sewage of which he has to dispose. He is not concerned with what else 
goes on there. But his concern with sewage disposal may make him sensitive to 
some factor which is irrelevant to most or all of the others – for example, to its 
height above sea level relative to the contour on which his sewage disposal works is 
situated. And if this concern were anticipated, it might even have affected the activi-
ties of the planner in siting the school, through the medium of the local authority’s 
finance committee, concerned with the cost of providing services. How many kinds 
of fragmented entity is a school? Of how many wholes is it a part? How far is it itself 
a whole or many different wholes?
These are unreal problems, derived from our habit of attaching labels to ‘entities’ 
and thus exaggerating their integrity. It is, however, possible and important to draw 
a distinction between those internal relations which enable any assembly to sustain 
its ‘form’ (any of its forms) and those which enable it to act as a whole on its sur-
round. From the viewpoint of parents, teachers, and students the school remains not 
only a school but the familiar school so long as teaching, attendance and activities 
proceed ‘as usual’, even though teachers and students change. A host of internal 
relationships have to be maintained if this is to happen. Teachers must attend and 
teach; students must attend and keep their disruptive activities below whatever 
threshold has become acceptable. A host of external relationships must also be 
maintained between the school as a whole and its surround, the physical support

systems (including the drains already mentioned), the arrangements for recruiting 
trained teachers to replace those who leave or are promoted, the payment of salaries, 
the maintenance of structures, even the minimal good will of the parents (if they are 
to be regarded as wholly ‘external’, as in England they so often are). All these rela-
tionships, both internal and external, have limits beyond which they cannot be 
pushed without escalating instability which may result in irreversible change or 
even dissolution of the system. Within these limits change can be accommodated 
sometimes almost unnoticed, sometimes welcomed. Unhappily it is often difficult 
to predict where these limits lie until they have been passed.
So the relation between wholes and parts begins to become clearer. An organiza-
tion is a whole in so far as it acts as a whole on its surround. These external relations 
can be sustained only so long as its internal relations support them. This relation 
between inner and outer is not a simple dichotomy; for systems may be related hier-
archically. […]
One further important point remains to be noted. Forms are indeed often related 
hierarchically and it is this which encourages us to differentiate them as wholes and 
parts. Cells, each a complex marvel of organization, combine to form organs which 
together create organisms which support persons, which combine in societies. But 
relations are not necessarily arranged hierarchically, as the example of the school 
has shown. Many ‘entities’ form part of many different systems which are not them-
selves related in any hierarchic fashion, though events may raise one or other to a 
status of overriding importance. Few urban activities, for example, can continue for 
long if the sewage system stops working. Yet whilst it works, it is taken for granted 
as one of many physical support systems.
In the chapters which follow I will develop some of these ideas further; but I 
hope this introduction has made the basic ideas as I see them sufficiently clear to be 
summarized.
	1.	 Systems are nets of relations which are sustained through time. The processes by 
which they are sustained are the process of regulation. The limits within which 
they can be sustained are the conditions of their stability.
	2.	 Open systems depend on and contribute to their surround and are thus involved 
in interdependence with it as well as being dependent on the interaction of their 
internal relationships. This interdependence imposes constraints on all their con-
stituents. Organization can mitigate but not remove these constraints which tend 
to become more demanding and sometimes even more contradictory as the scale 
of organization rises. This places a limit, though usually not a predictable one, on 
the possibilities of organization.
	3.	 Open systems cannot, by definition, be ‘wholes’ if this is taken to mean systems 
wholly independent of their surround. But in so far as any open system acts as a 
whole in relation to its surround it is useful to distinguish the internal relations 
which enable it to do so from the external relations which it thus sustains. It is 
thus both legitimate and necessary to move freely from the consideration of a 
system as a whole to the consideration of it as part of a larger system; it is equally

82
legitimate and necessary to realize that its constituents may also be constituents 
of other systems.
	4.	 Systems are thus tools of understanding devised by human minds for under-
standing situations, including situations in which human beings appear as con-
stituents. They are not arbitrary constructs. They must include the minimum 
number of relationships needed to constitute the situation which is to be under-
stood. But this is defined by its relevance to the concerns of some human minds.

Chapter 9
Howard Odum
This is a tale of two brothers, Howard and Eugene Odum, and how they introduced 
ideas from general systems theory and cybernetics into the field of ecology, in the 
process coming to dominate ecology as an academic discipline for decades. While 
both drew on systems ideas, our focus is on the younger brother, Howard, as it was 
he who more explicitly brought these ideas into ecology and was more closely 
aligned with systems organisations. The importance of the Odum brothers’ contri-
bution has been summed up by a former student of Howard’s, who wrote that they 
“were not only among the first to educate generations of scholars and the public 
about ecology but also pioneers in uniting the human and social aspects of environ-
mental issues with their ecological and natural dimensions” (Gunderson et al. 2002).
Howard Thomas Odum was born in 1924 in North Carolina, USA and died in 
2002 in Florida. His father, Howard Washington Odum, was a distinguished soci-
ologist who worked on the regional characteristics of the American South, and was 
a notable early white proponent of black rights; his influence ensured that “under-
standing the relationship between humans and their immediate environment was 
something of a family tradition” (Madison 1997, pp. 209–210). Because he shared 
his father’s first name, Howard Thomas Odum was usually referred to as Tom or HT 
(the latter being his own preference). HT’s brother Eugene was 10 years older than 
him, born in 1913, and was a pioneer of ecology; he had a huge influence on the 
field through his textbook Fundamentals of Ecology (first published in 1953), which 
was the major textbook in the field for many years and appeared in several editions, 
most with HT’s involvement. Eugene Odum also died in 2002, just one month 
before his younger brother. In addition to his lifelong collaboration with his brother, 
HT also published a number of works with his second wife, Elisabeth, culminating 
in a book about routes out of ecological catastrophe, A Prosperous Way Down 
(Odum and Odum 2001).
HT Odum took his first degree in zoology, graduating in 1947 from the University 
of North Carolina. His studies were interrupted by the Second World War, and he 
spent the time in the US Air Force as a tropical meteorologist, which gave him early 

86
experience of modelling and the role of energy in natural systems, both of which 
would become major themes in his later work. He did his graduate work at Yale in 
the field of biogeochemistry, studying the global strontium cycle and completing his 
Ph.D. in 1951. His supervisor at Yale was G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a participant in the 
Macy conferences on cybernetics who was one of the first researchers to incorporate 
feedback concepts in ecology.
After his time at Yale, Odum moved to the University of Florida where he spent 
4 years. Between 1954 and 1970 he was based in four different universities – Duke 
University in North Carolina, and the universities of Texas, Puerto Rico and North 
Carolina  – each broadening his awareness of different types of ecosystems and 
deepening his theoretical work. In 1970 he returned to the University of Florida 
where he worked for the rest of his career, in the department of Environmental 
Engineering Sciences. He introduced several important concepts to ecology; and he 
developed a powerful set of diagrams mapping energy flows in a range of ecological 
systems. He was notable for the range of his fieldwork as an ecologist – freshwater 
springs, coral reefs, large ocean bays, tropical rain forests, agriculture, swamps and 
others. He was also a leader, along with others, in founding the fields of systems 
ecology, ecological economics and ecological engineering, each now major areas.
The Odum brothers were responsible for the widespread use of the concept of the 
ecosystem, a unit that includes all living organisms in a given location and their 
natural environment, under the view that these are “inseparably inter-related and 
interact upon each other” (E. P. Odum 1971, p. 8). The word ‘ecosystem’ has a 
history going back to 1935 when it was coined by the British biologist Arthur Tansley, 
but it was through the Odums’ work that it came to popular use. Their understanding 
of ecosystems was described clearly after their deaths by Gunderson et al. (2002):
In response to Aldo Leopold’s contention that we need to “think like a mountain” to 
understand ecology, the Odums would have argued that we need [to] think like a system. 
Their world view was one of systems, i.e., components, connections, and complexity. They 
fought long and hard to develop a science that was not just about dissecting and 
understanding parts, but about understanding and unraveling the dynamics of the whole.
HT Odum was a highly innovative thinker, who taught his many students through 
extensive experience of fieldwork as well as through theory. At his memorial ser-
vice, “many generations of his students spoke of his influence and stature as a 
genius” (Gunderson et al. 2002) while others described “his kindness, for his ability 
to bring out the best in everyone, his mentoring, and his care for the ‘underdog’ ” 
(Brown et al. 2004, p. 4). One student recalled an experience of being taught in a 
fieldwork setting by Odum:
“We’re trekking around the marshes at Cedar Key [in Florida] … the mosquitoes are really, 
really bad. HT has his head down in the root zone; someone comments on the mosquitoes 
that are getting to him. And, of course, he says: ‘the real issue is to ask and understand what 
the mosquitoes are doing for this system’. And that captures his gift: asking the key ques-
tion, at the key moment, and at the key scale that most of us don’t think about” (Gilliland 
1994, p. 89).
Odum wrote a number of important papers and books that took forward the field 
of ecology, perhaps most notably Environment, Power and Society (H. T. Odum 
9  Howard Odum

87
1971), described as “a book that changed the lives of many who read it” (Brown 
et al. 2003, p. 294); his significantly revised edition was published posthumously 
(H. T. Odum 2007). The development of systems ecology, set out in his book of the 
same name (H. T. Odum 1983), was perhaps the greatest single contribution that 
Odum made. It arose from the application of ideas from both general systems theory 
and cybernetics to the field of ecology. He described this approach as the use not of 
a microscope but rather a ‘macroscope’ and noted that:
Bit by bit the machinery of the macroscope is evolving in various sciences and in the 
philosophical attitudes of students. ... Whereas men used to search among the parts to find 
mechanistic explanations, the macroscopic view is the reverse. Men, already having a clear 
view of the parts in their fantastically complex detail, must somehow get away, rise above, 
step back, group parts, simplify concepts, interpose frosted glass, and thus somehow see the 
big patterns. (H. T. Odum 1971, p. 10)
This macroscopic approach, of studying large-scale systems of great complexity, 
was at the heart of systems ecology. As early as 1957, in a monograph describing a 
widely-read early study of a river ecosystem in Silver Springs, Florida, Odum 
described his goal as “the complete quantitative determination of the states and flow 
[in the situation] as well as the control mechanisms by which such a picture is 
sustained” (H. T. Odum 1957, p. 59) – a goal clearly influenced by cybernetics. 
Influenced by the biogeochemical approach of his doctoral work, HT Odum – and 
his brother Eugene – came to see energy as the most useful way of describing both 
ecosystems and their control mechanisms. In this they were heavily drawing on 
ideas from thermodynamics, in which field the concept of energy is central, just as 
Ludwig von Bertalanffy had done in forming the basic ideas of general systems theory.
The central method for Odum in understanding the behaviour of an ecosystem at 
any scale was to follow its energy flows: the way in which energy was transferred 
and transformed from one part of the system to another. This approach gave him the 
capacity to follow the behaviour of a system closely, and to create general principles 
about its behaviour.
Three of these principles stand out from his work. First was the maximum power 
principle, which states that ecosystems tend to evolve to a state that maximises their 
power output rather than their efficiency – his former student Charles Hall calls this 
idea “perhaps the most consistent concept that Odum thought about and developed 
[which] permeates most of his writings” (Hall 2004, p. 112). Second was his con-
cept of embodied energy (called emergy in his later writings as his use of the term 
differed from that of some other writers), “the work previously required to generate 
a product or service” (H. T. Odum 1996, p. vii) and which he argued must be taken 
into account to ascertain the true cost of something.
Third, he developed a detailed method for drawing energy systems diagrams, a 
highly stylised form of circuit diagram including elements such as energy sources, 
sinks and stores, which allowed for detailed modelling of ecosystems that did not 
require the user to have a knowledge of mathematics. There are clear parallels 
between Odum’s diagram work and the system dynamics modelling of Jay 
Forrester – each used quite similar symbols, drawing upon physical analogies to 
model social and natural systems. Odum was aware of these parallels but there has

been no significant collaboration between users of the approaches. Ramage and 
Shipp (2012) explored both Odum and Forrester’s models, along with those of 
Stafford Beer and the distinctive systems diagrams teaching at the Open University, 
arguing that each showed a two-stage shift from “technological to human model-
ling, and mathematical to qualitative modelling” (p. 122).
Based on his analysis of energy flows, Odum vividly argued that the agricultural 
revolution had been badly misunderstood as being driven by efficiency gains, when 
in fact it was very dependent on oil use, an idea which is still very relevant given 
today’s widespread concern about carbon emissions and the environmental impact 
of food production and transportation (H. T. Odum 1971, pp. 115–116):
The great conceit of industrial man imagined that his progress in agricultural yields was due 
to new know-how in the use of the sun. A whole generation of citizens thought that the car-
rying capacity of the earth was proportional to the amount of land under cultivation and that 
higher efficiencies in using the energy of the sun had arrived. This is a sad hoax, for indus-
trial man no longer eats potatoes made from solar energy; now he eats potatoes partly made 
of oil.
Odum held a profound commitment to radical societal change, as his critique of 
the agricultural revolution implies. In his later work referred to the dangers of 
‘imperial capitalism’ (H. T. Odum 2007, p. 276) and argued that “the exclusive 
dominance of large-scale capitalism can be replaced with an emphasis on cooperation 
with the environment and among nations” (Odum and Odum 2001, p. 146).
Odum understood his work as being in the area of general systems theory, writing 
in Systems Ecology, that “in this book we seek to understand the principles of 
general systems theory along with the reality of environmental systems” (H. T. Odum 
1983, p. 4). He was chair of the International Society for Systems Sciences (the 
successor to the Society for General Systems Research). While aspects of his work 
resemble other areas within systems thinking – his focus on feedback being close to 
cybernetics, and his diagram-based modelling being close to system dynamics – the 
systems community with which he was most closely connected was that of general 
systems theory.
In later life, both HT and Eugene Odum were to gain considerable recognition 
for their work. They jointly received several important international prizes, most 
significantly the Crafoord Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 
1987, considered to be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in a number of fields, 
including ecology, where Alfred Nobel did not establish an award.
The work of the Odum brothers was not uncontroversial, both in their time and 
to the present day – they have been criticised by ecologists, general systems theo-
rists and sociologists. From an ecological perspective, the Odums were seen as 
advocating a view that ecosystems necessarily exist in equilibrium (strictly speak-
ing, in what von Bertalanffy called dynamic equilibrium or a ‘steady state’). 
However, as Partridge (2005) has argued, while the Odums did focus on equilibrium 
in their early work, they shifted their position with the rest of the scientific com-
munity, and in late work Eugene Odum wrote (citing the work of Ilya Prigogine) 
that “an ecosystem is a thermodynamically open, far from equilibrium, system” 
(E. P. Odum 1992, p. 542).

From a general systems perspective the main criticisms have been twofold. First, 
they have been criticised for the reductionist step of representing all systems in 
terms of energy flows, thus “reinforcing a utilitarian and managerial view of the 
relationship between humans and nature” (Hammond 1997, p. 198), although in his 
defence we have seen that HT Odum with his macroscopic perspective saw this as 
essentially a form of abstraction. Second, they have been criticised for not taking 
multiple perspectives into account, in particular when they move from purely natu-
ral systems to those involving human beings – Kenneth Boulding wrote in 1977 of 
the Odums’ work that “the basic error is the failure to recognise that all values are 
human values created by human valuations. Social systems cannot be reduced to 
physical descriptions whether in terms of energy, entropy, or any other kind of phys-
ical or engineering efficiency concepts” (quoted by Hammond 1997, p. 202).
HT Odum has been criticised from a sociological perspective for his “technocratic 
optimism” (Taylor 2005, p. 53) – the view that all the problems of the world could 
be solved by technology, if it were only harnessed correctly by intelligent people. In 
fact, Odum was often against the introduction of technology into ecosystems (as we 
have seen in his criticism of oil use) – Taylor’s criticism relates rather to Odum’s 
modelling of ecosystems using tools from engineering such as circuit diagrams, and 
the rationality that goes with that.
Ecologists continue to discuss the impact of his work. Although Odum’s specific 
techniques have not become widely used, systems ecology has clearly made a sig-
nificant contribution to a widespread understanding of the interconnected nature of 
ecosystems. A group of his former students, introducing a journal issue on teaching 
systems ecology, argue that: “Given the enormous and complicated problems 
humans face with climate, energy, health, and so on, it is clear that systems ecology 
has a great deal to offer. In fact, some kind of a systems approach is used routinely 
in many of these issues (e.g., simulation modeling, and concepts of resilience). So, 
in a sense, systems ecology has become routine, even if not so named.” (Hall et al. 
2018, p. 10).
Howard Thomas Odum was a highly creative and influential thinker who did a 
huge amount to bring systems ideas into the field of ecology and the environment. 
His legacy was summed up during his lifetime as follows: “H.T. Odum sees nature 
in a fundamentally new and incredibly important way. His greatest gift has been to 
give biologists, ecologists and engineers a new set of eyes with which to view the 
living world. He is like a master painter confronting a huge blank canvas. … He is 
altering our perception of nature, design and the future” (Todd 1994, p. 104).

An environmental system is a network of component parts and processes on the 
scale of the environment. Environmental systems usually include some area of the 
earth’s land or water. Examples are forests, lakes, seas, farms, cities, regions, coun-
tries, and the biosphere as a whole. These tend to be comprised of living organisms, 
chemical cycles, water flows, components of the earth, and so on. The components 
often include humans and human-manufactured machines, units, or organization 
such as industry, cities, economic exchanges, social behavior, and transportation, 
communication, information processing, politics, and many others. Each of these 
components is a complex subsystem of the larger environmental systems. Biological 
community subsystems control the detailed performances of the many species of 
living organisms. What is a system, and what is a subsystem is an arbitrary charac-
teristic of one’s point of view. One person’s system is another person’s subsystem. 
There are apparently similar laws of function and mechanism operating at all levels 
of scale and size.
The word ‘ecosystem’ is a short expression for ‘ecological system’. To some 
people, ‘ecological system’ has become a synonym for ‘environmental system’. 
Others use the word ‘ecosystem’ only for those systems of nature that generally do 
not include humans. In this book we use the terms ‘ecosystem’ and ‘environmental 
system’ interchangeably. An organized system of land, water, mineral cycles, living 
organisms, and their programmatic behavioral control mechanisms is called an 
ecosystem.
Examples of large ecosystems are whole forested regions, the seas, and the 
biosphere as a whole. Examples of small ecosystems are such associations of 
organisms and microenvironments, as ponds, coral heads, and aquaria in school 
classrooms. Small ecosystems are subsystems within the larger ones. In the broad-
est modern usage, systems that include humans, such as farms, industries, and cit-
ies, are also regarded as ecosystems, and there is a growing recognition that humans 
are incomplete without the life support of self-maintaining natural ecosystems. All 
these systems develop structures and processes adapted to the environmental inputs 
available to them.
In time through the process of trial and error, complex patterns of structure and 
process have evolved, the successful ones surviving because they use materials and 
energies well in their own maintenance, competing well with other patterns that 
chance interposes. The parts of successful ecosystems are organized by exchanges 
of minerals, food chains, economic transfers, and other work services that act among 
the components. These pathways of work can be diagrammed to show the designs 
of ecosystems [e.g. Fig. 9.1]. The engineering of new ecosystems designs is a new 
field that uses systems that are mainly self-organizing. Ecosystems will require deli-
cate and intelligent measures for effective use.
With our growing knowledge of ecological design, management of the ecosystems 
by human interactions is one of the bright hopes for humans if their large, rich 
sources of energy supporting their present complex urban system begins to wane.

Example of an Environmental System
Figure 9.1 is a diagram of a typical environmental system that has several energy 
sources, each of a different quality and a coarse aggregation of components to show 
organization in the characteristic hierarchical pattern.
In qualitative translation into English, the diagram in Fig. 9.1 expresses energy 
inflows in (1) sunlight, (2) accompanying rain, and (3) geologic uplift. These 
develop soils and interact to operate production by environmental life support sys-
tems (natural areas without humans) and production by agriculture and forestry. 
These supply products and services to the urban areas along with imports that are 
obtained by purchases with money. The money for purchasing imports comes from 
sale of exports. The urban systems send wastes back to the environmental system 
and services of labor, fertilizer, equipment, and so on, to the agriculture and forestry 
sector. A switching unit controls the harvest of products for shipment to the urban

systems. The life-support systems help build soils. Outflows include the exports; the 
runoff; and the used, degraded energy.
Cycle of Materials
A characteristic of systems is their recycling of materials, especially those that have 
few inflows. Forests and plankton ecosystems recycle phosphorus, human econo-
mies recycle steel and aluminum, the biosphere recycles water, the mountain build-
ing systems recycle sediment materials, and so on. Diagrams of systems usually 
show this important feature; for instance, Fig.  9.1 shows a recycle of wastes 
(Lotka 1925).
Material Flows as Energy Flows
Sometimes there is confusion about the energy associated with flows of materials. 
Since any concentration of a substance relative to its environment constitutes a 
small potential energy storage, all recognizable flows of materials carry an energy 
content. The energy is sufficient to drive the degrading diffusion of that substance 
away from its concentrations.
Although the actual concentrations of energy are small, the embodied energy of 
successive work in developing the concentrations may be very large. For example, 
large solar energies are used to develop the food chains to guano birds, which in turn 
develop island phosphate deposits. The solar energy embodied in phosphate depos-
its is large. The energy transformation ratio is the ratio of solar calories per calorie 
of phosphate concentration. […] Generally, the more critical and important a mate-
rial is as a limiting factor, the more embodied energy it carries. The energy is of high 
quality. […]
Information Flows as Energy Flows
As one passes from abundant low-quality energy through successive transformations 
in chains or webs […] the actual calorie flows decline, but the embodied energy and 
energy quality increases as already described. Where the sequence of transformations 
is very long, only tiny fractions of the original quantity of calories is still contained, 
but the energy transformation ratios are very large. Customarily people don’t regard 
these flows as energy, but usually call them information. Flows of genes, books, 
television communications, computer programs, human culture, art, political 
interactions, and religious communications are examples of information. However, 
these all have very large embodied energies and high ratios of ­calories of solar 
9  Howard Odum

93
energy per calorie of information. It is still appropriate to consider the calories of 
potential energy in information, since this is what drives the depreciation and loss 
of information as with losses of other kinds of storage. Information cannot be stored 
without some concentration of substance or energy fields relative to the environment. 
For example, words on a page are concentrations of ink, memory on a computer 
disk is a concentration of magnetic field, and information in biological genes is a 
storage of DNA form relative to the environment.
The flows of information carry the most embodied energy and also have the 
greatest amplifier and control effects per calorie. They are the feedbacks of highly 
embodied energy that provide systems with specialized services, feeding back posi-
tive actions that ‘repay’ their webs for the energy dispersed in the development of 
the information. […] Information pathways are energy pathways also and are drawn 
in energy language as regular pathways, but usually feeding back from the far right 
side of the diagrams.
Money is a special kind of information flow that controls through its circulation 
as a countercurrent with exchange rates according to human behavior programs for 
reacting to prices. Energy circuit language uses dashed lines or color to help recog-
nize this component web.
Structure and Function
Understanding structure and function is an often stated objective of system sciences. 
Structure is in the pattern of connections and in the storages. To simplify models, 
the patterns of connections of complex diagrams may be combined as a single 
storage in aggregating detail. Functions are flows and changes of state as energy 
passes through network structure. Processes are located at points of energy 
transformation usually at intersections.

Jay Forrester
Jay Wright Forrester was an American engineer and management thinker. He 
founded System Dynamics, an approach based on computer modelling which argu-
ably has done more than any other method to provide a practical and realistic analy-
sis of change processes in systems. System Dynamics (SD) has been taken up across 
the world, initially by Forrester’s students and colleagues, but increasingly by a 
much wider community. It has had profound and influential applications in a range 
of fields, most prominently organisational management, urban planning and envi-
ronmental policy. Forrester summed up his concerns and his understanding of SD in 
an ‘elevator pitch’ (a statement short enough to be spoken in an elevator ride) on an 
email list:
System dynamics deals with how things change through time, which includes most of what 
most people find important. It uses computer simulation to take the knowledge we already 
have about details in the world around us and to show why our social and physical systems 
behave the way they do. System dynamics demonstrates how most of our own decision-­
making policies are the cause of the problems that we usually blame on others, and how to 
identify policies we can follow to improve our situation. (Forrester 1997)
Jay Forrester was born in 1918  in rural Nebraska, in the midwestern United 
States, and died in 2016 near Boston. He grew up on a cattle ranch where he had the 
experience that “in an agricultural setting, life must be very practical. It is not theo-
retical; nor is it conceptual without purpose. It is full-time immersion in the real 
world” (Forrester 2007a, p. 345). Although he considered continuing in agriculture, 
he took his undergraduate degree in electrical engineering at the University of 
Nebraska, graduating in 1939. This study gave him a further important lesson – in 
his view electrical engineering was “about the only academic field with a solid, 
central core of theoretical dynamics” (Forrester 2007a, p. 345).
These two aspects of his character – a focus on results and on being practical 
combined with a theoretical interest in dynamics – shaped his work throughout his 
life. Two colleagues described him after his death as “faultlessly courteous. He was 
direct and unambiguous with criticism and praise. He was also hospitable and 

98
­convivial, enjoying a good joke and quick to share humorous stories himself” (Lane 
and Sterman 2018, p. 96).
In 1939, Forrester moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he 
spent his entire career, formally retiring in 1989. His initial work was in the 
Servomechanisms Laboratory, founded by Gordon Brown who was to become his 
mentor over 50 years, “substantially responsible for helping me develop my career” 
(Forrester 1996, p. 350). Brown was Forrester’s employer as a research assistant 
during the years of the Second World War; he supervised Forrester’s Masters thesis 
(passed in 1945); and it was even through Brown that Forrester met his wife, Susan. 
Moreover, the “feedback system theory that I learned in his Servomechanisms 
Laboratory became the foundation for the field of system dynamics” (Forrester 
1996, p. 350).
Servomechanisms are mechanical devices which control the behaviour of a 
larger system through feedback. A classic example is the thermostat controlling the 
boiler of a heating system. During the war, Brown and Forrester worked on servo-
mechanisms to control the behaviour of radar antennae and gun mounts. Following 
the war, Forrester began work on the design of an early aircraft flight simulator. The 
simulator was intended to be based on an analogue computer, but ended up as one 
of the very first digital computers, Whirlwind, which in due course evolved into 
SAGE (Semi-Autonomous Ground Environment), an air defence system.
Whirlwind, for which Forrester was project leader (it began operation in 1951), 
was ground-breaking: it was the first digital computer to operate in real time and to 
use video displays for output. A further important innovation in the Whirlwind proj-
ect was Forrester’s invention of magnetic core memory, for many years the domi-
nant form of computer memory and for which he held the patent along with MIT, 
making him quite wealthy (Buck and Dey 2018). A key employee on this work was 
Ken Olsen, the founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, on whose board Forrester 
served for many years.
By 1956, Forrester felt that “the pioneering days in digital computers were over” 
(Forrester 1989, p. 4). He remained at MIT but moved to its School of Management. 
This was less of a large shift than it might seem – as head of the Whirlwind project, 
he had already experienced several years as a manager of a very large scale project, 
involving negotiation and contracting with several partner organisations. His initial 
goal in moving to the School of Management was to apply the lessons he had 
learned about technology to issues of management. In doing so he created the field 
of system dynamics.
Forrester’s first study involved fluctuations in levels of sales, inventory and 
employees in household appliances at General Electric (GE). The company was 
going through inexplicable cycles, apparently unrelated to normal business demand, 
where sometimes their workers would be terribly over-stretched and at other times 
the company would have to sack people. Forrester was able to model the cycles and 
observe that they created positive feedback loops arising from delays in interactions 
between different departments of the company. Initially he modelled these using 
paper and pencil, but he was convinced of the importance of computers for enhanc-
ing management decision-making, and as part of the project a colleague built a 
10  Jay Forrester

99
compiler that allowed the direct entry of the feedback equations into a computer. 
This compiler later developed into DYNAMO, which was used for many years as 
the basis of simulation models within system dynamics. The model of GE’s inven-
tory control, and especially the delay between different departments, was later re-­
expressed in terms of beer production by Forrester’s graduate students and became 
the basis of a classic simulation game used in many introductory courses, the MIT 
Beer Game.
Forrester published his first results as an article in the Harvard Business Review 
(Forrester 1958), later expanded to a book (Forrester 1961) – both with the title of 
‘Industrial Dynamics’ which served as the name of the field for its first decade. As 
he presented it, the work rests on four foundations: feedback control theory, an 
understanding of decision-making processes, simulation, and the use of digital com-
puters to enable mathematical modelling. Of these, he believed the first to be the 
most important, directly arising from work on servomechanisms. He wrote that 
from this theory we learnt about “the effect of time delays, amplification, and struc-
ture on the dynamic behaviour of a system … [and] that the interaction between 
system components can be more important the components themselves” (Forrester 
1961, p. 14).
The first 10 years of work on system dynamics resulted in a solid theoretical core 
which continues to be the basis of the field to this day. In 1968, Forrester published 
a textbook which outlined the main concepts and methods of system dynamics 
(Forrester 1968a). He was very clear that SD was driven by the structure of systems 
and that the structure was described by a set of interlocking feedback loops. 
Importantly, “a model of a system is formulated by starting with the loop structure, 
not by starting with components of loops” (Forrester 1968b, p. 407). The interaction 
between these loops produces the behaviour of the system.
SD’s strong emphasis on feedback and control suggests close parallels with 
cybernetics, and indeed the early development of both approaches was largely done 
at MIT. However, it is clear from Forrester’s account that he took his understanding 
of feedback from quite different sources, largely that of servomechanisms, and had 
no connection with cybernetics. Richardson (1991) identifies two parallel threads of 
the use of feedback ideas in social sciences (the servomechanisms thread and the 
cybernetics thread) with important distinctions, placing Forrester along with a num-
ber of economists who applied feedback in their work, most notably Herbert Simon 
who later won the Nobel prize for his work on management decision-making. In 
particular, Richardson argues that those in the cybernetics thread treat feedback as a 
“tool for controlling systems in the face of [external] disturbances” while those in 
the servomechanisms thread see feedback loops “as an internal aspect of the struc-
ture of social systems” (Richardson 1991, p. 164).
In the late 1960s, Forrester and his colleagues (by then a well-established group 
at MIT) began to branch out to other fields beyond management. This was espe-
cially inspired by the outgoing mayor of Boston becoming a 1 year visiting profes-
sor at MIT, with an office next to Forrester’s. Through this contact, Forrester became 
interested in the modelling of urban issues, and was able to assemble a group of 
those who understood the nature and problems of cities. The result was a detailed 
10  Jay Forrester

100
SD model of a city, published in the book Urban Dynamics (Forrester 1969). The 
book’s conclusion was controversial: “that all of the major urban policies that the 
United States was following lay somewhere between neutral and highly detrimen-
tal, from the viewpoint either of the city as an institution, or from the viewpoint of 
the low-income, unemployed residents” (Forrester 1989, p. 8). Its methodology was 
no less controversial – instead of drawing upon existing literature on urban plan-
ning, it worked entirely from a computer model. The book tended to polarise opin-
ions, some very positive and others very negative. The ideas in Forrester’s book 
were later taken up (in the late 1980s) as the basis for a highly successful computer 
game, SimCity, which simulated the behaviour of a number of cities and allowed 
players to control aspects of their design and management.
Forrester’s urban modelling also led directly to the most famous application of 
SD, the modelling of the world economy and ecosystem. This work was carried out 
through the Club of Rome, an informal and small group of influential people in 
business, academia and politics, founded by Aurelio Peccei, an Italian business 
executive. Learning of Forrester’s urban work, Peccei invited him to join the Club 
and to attend a meeting in Switzerland in 1970. The Club had been offered a grant 
from the Volkswagen Foundation if they could propose a clear research project to 
tackle what they called the ‘problématique humaine’: the interlocking issues of 
global population, crime, pollution, resource depletion, terrorism etc. (Kleiner 
1996). Forrester proposed the development of an SD model of these interlocking 
global issues, and invited the Club to visit MIT to explore the approach and its 
potential. The bulk of the modelling work was carried out within the MIT SD group 
by a team led by one of Forrester’s former students, Dennis Meadows. Forrester 
wrote a further book based on this work, World Dynamics (Forrester 1971) which 
was a surprise bestseller and highly controversial, even being reviewed on the front 
pages of some newspapers; the more popular book which followed, Limits to 
Growth (Meadows et al. 1972) sold still better and was still more controversial. This 
work is discussed in greater depth in the chapter on Donella Meadows. It was during 
the Club of Rome project that Forrester’s group started to use the term ‘system 
dynamics’ rather than ‘industrial dynamics’, given that the focus of the work was 
much broader than industrial applications (Meadows 2002).
The modelling work on the Club of Rome project was often criticised for the 
poor-quality data used to shape its conclusions. This was partly due, as Edwards 
(2010) argues, to a lack of availability of good-quality long-term data sources on 
issues such as pollution, industrial output and non-renewable resource use. However, 
more widely it relates to Forrester’s preference, as discussed earlier, for taking a 
structural rather than a statistical approach to modelling. In later work on a ‘National 
Model’ of the US economy, Forrester argued strongly that “inadequacies of eco-
nomic analysis can be substantially attributed to inappropriate and biased use of 
available information [such as] overemphasis on finding statistical relationships 
between economic variables and underemphasis on the internal causal mechanisms 
that produce economic behavior” (Forrester 1980, p. 555). This work on the National 
Model was the subject of a number of years of work and publications, but did not 
have the same influence as Forrester’s earlier work.

System dynamics has had considerable impact on practical issues in the areas of 
management, urban planning and environmental change. The approach often uses a 
deeply rigorous approach, but its practical impact has been less than might be 
expected, particularly in addressing social concerns. Forrester (2007b, p. 361) him-
self asked, 50 years after the start of his work, “Why is there so little impact of 
system dynamics in the most important social questions? It is because we have not 
yet taken the steps that would earn us a role in the great issues.” In a similar vein 
10 years later, Forrester’s successor as head of the SD group at MIT, John Sterman, 
argued that “impact that leads to sustained improvement requires both effective 
implementation methods and models that yield reliable, rigorous, evidence-based 
recommendations” (Sterman 2019, p. 40).
Towards the end of his working life and throughout his retirement, Forrester 
actively pursued the use of SD in education at all levels, with a particular interest in 
teaching it to school-children. He held the view that “if begun early enough, every-
one can gain an appreciation for the complex dynamics of natural and human sys-
tems, and then use those insights to create a better world” (Lane and Sterman 2018, 
p. 96), and this approach led to the successful teaching of system dynamic model-
ling in a number of school settings (Fisher 2018).
Two other aspects of Forrester’s further development of SD are especially inter-
esting. First, he actively led a large research group at MIT for almost 50 years, dur-
ing which time the group produced almost 5000 working papers. However, Forrester 
made no attempt to create an ‘official’ version of system dynamics to the exclusion 
of others’ ideas. In fact, the ownership of SD as a field is now held by the System 
Dynamics Society, founded as an international society in 1983 and now with more 
than 1100 members in 75 different countries (at time of writing). This society holds 
an annual conference and publishes a successful journal. Forrester was its founding 
president, and is recognised and honoured as the founder of the field, but his voice 
became only one of many.
The second striking aspect of Forrester’s later work was his treatment of models. 
Computer-based modelling is central to system dynamics, and the chief criticisms 
of the field often arise from this, assuming that the models are used in a simplistic 
way. Forrester took a realist position on model-building, explicitly positioning him-
self against Peter Checkland’s interpretivist view and arguing that “in system 
dynamics, we have a set of principles, incomplete as they may be, that I believe do 
represent the actual nature of physical and social reality” (Forrester 1994, p. 250). 
There are subtler issues involved, however. As SD has developed, it has become 
clear that the modelling process is as important as the resulting model. As Sterman 
(2002, p. 521) has written, citing a much earlier paper of Forrester’s, “because all 
models are wrong, we reject the notion that models can be validated in the diction-
ary definition sense of ‘establishing truthfulness’, instead focusing on creating mod-
els that are useful … we argue that focusing on the process of modelling rather than 
on the results of any particular model speeds learning and leads to better models, 
better policies, and a greater chance of implementation and system improvement”. 
Given this attitude to modelling, Lane has argued that it is meaningless to situate SD 
as a ‘hard systems thinking’ approach; rather it has a “much more participative and 
10  Jay Forrester

contingent relationship between a model and those working with it” (Lane 
2000, p. 18).
In creating system dynamics, Jay Forrester built more than a method or theory – 
he created a whole new form of thinking. While focused on computer-based model-
ling and thus expert-driven, it is highly practical and oriented towards real change 
in real situations. As Morecroft and Homer (2007, p. 20) have written, Forrester has 
“established for [system dynamics] an analytic paradigm that combines boldness 
and broad vision with rigor and depth”. In doing so he has made a great and long-­
lasting contribution.

Computer Models of Social Systems
People would never send a space ship to the moon without first testing prototype 
models and making computer simulations of anticipated trajectories. No company 
would put a new household appliance or airplane into production without first mak-
ing laboratory tests. Such models and laboratory tests do not guarantee against fail-
ure, but they do identify many weaknesses which can be corrected before they cause 
full-scale disasters.
Social systems are far more complex and harder to understand than technological 
systems. Why then do we not use the same approach of making models of social 
systems and conducting laboratory experiments before adopting new laws and gov-
ernment programs? The customary answer assumes that our knowledge of social 
systems is not sufficient for constructing useful models.
But what justification can there be for assuming that we do not know enough to 
construct models of social systems but believe we do know enough to directly rede-
sign social systems by passing laws and starting new programs? I suggest that we 
now do know enough to make useful models of social systems. Conversely, we do 
not know enough to design the most effective social policies directly without first 
going through a model-building experimental phase. Substantial supporting evi-
dence is accumulating that proper use of models of social systems can lead to far 
better systems, laws, and programs.
Realistic laboratory models of social systems can now be constructed. Such 
models are simplifications of actual systems, but computer models can be far more 
comprehensive than the mental models that would otherwise be used.

Before going further, please realize that there is nothing new in the use of models 
to represent social systems. Each of us uses models constantly. Every person in 
private life and in business instinctively uses models for decision making. The men-
tal images in one’s head about one’s surroundings are models. One’s head does not 
contain real families, businesses, cities, governments, or countries. One uses 
selected concepts and relationships to represent real systems. A mental image is a 
model. All decisions are taken on the basis of models. All laws are passed on the 
basis of models. All executive actions are taken on the basis of models. The question 
is not to use or ignore models. The question is only a choice among alterna-
tive models.
Mental models are fuzzy, incomplete, and imprecisely stated. Furthermore, 
within a single individual, mental models change with time, even during the flow of 
a single conversation. The human mind assembles a few relationships to fit the con-
text of a discussion. As debate shifts, so do the mental models. Even when only a 
single topic is being discussed, each participant in a conversation employs a differ-
ent mental model to interpret the subject. Fundamental assumptions differ but are 
never brought into the open. Goals are different but left unstated.
It is little wonder that compromise takes so long. And even when consensus is 
reached, the underlying assumptions may be fallacies that lead to laws and pro-
grams that fail. The human mind is not adapted to understanding correctly the con-
sequences implied by a mental model. A mental model may be correct in structure 
and assumptions but, even so, the human mind – either individually or as a group 
consensus – is apt to draw the wrong implications for the future.
Inability of the human mind to use its own mental models becomes clear when a 
computer model is constructed to reproduce the assumptions contained in a person’s 
mental model. The computer model is refined until it fully agrees with the percep-
tions of a particular person or group. Then, usually, the system that has been 
described does not act the way the people anticipated. There are internal contradic-
tions in mental models between assumed structure and assumed future conse-
quences. Ordinarily assumptions about structure and internal governing policies are 
more nearly correct than are the assumptions about implied behavior.
By contrast to mental models, system dynamics simulation models are explicit 
about assumptions and how they interrelate. Any concept that can be clearly 
described in words can be incorporated in a computer model. Constructing a com-
puter model forces clarification of ideas. Unclear and hidden assumptions are 
exposed so they may be examined and debated.
The primary advantage of a computer simulation model over a mental model lies 
in the way a computer model can reliably determine the future dynamic conse-
quences of how the assumptions within the model interact with one another. There 
need be no doubt about a digital computer accurately simulating the actions that 
result from statements about the structure and policies in a model.
In some ways, computer models are strikingly similar to mental models. 
Computer models are derived from the same sources; they may be discussed in the 
same terms. But computer models differ from mental models in important ways. 
Reading from Forrester’s work

104
Computer models are stated explicitly. The ‘mathematical’ notation used for 
describing the computer models is unambiguous. Computer simulation language is 
clearer, simpler, and more precise than spoken languages. Computer instructions 
have clarity of meaning and simplicity of language syntax. Language of a computer 
model can be understood by almost anyone, regardless of educational background. 
Furthermore, any concept that can be clearly stated in ordinary language can be 
translated into computer-model language.
There are many approaches to computer models. Some are naive. Some are con-
ceptually inconsistent with the nature of actual systems. Some are based on meth-
odologies for obtaining input data that commit the models to omitting major 
relationships in the psychological and human areas that we all know to be crucial. 
With so much activity in computer models and with the same terminology having 
different meanings in the different approaches, the situation is confusing to a casual 
observer. The key to success is not in having a computer; the important thing is how 
the computer is used. With respect to models, the key is not to computerize a model, 
but, instead, to have a model structure and decision-making policies that properly 
represent the system under consideration.
I am speaking here of system dynamics models – the kind of computer models 
that are only now becoming widely used in the social sciences. System dynamics 
models are not derived statistically from time-series data. Instead, they are state-
ments about system structure and the policies that guide decisions. Models con-
tain the assumptions being made about a system. A model is only as good as the 
expertise which lies behind its formulation. A good computer model is distin-
guished from a poor one by the degree to which it captures the essence of a sys-
tem that it represents. Many other kinds of mathematical models are limited 
because they will not accept the multiple-feedback-loop and nonlinear nature of 
real systems.
On the other hand, system dynamics computer models can reflect the behavior of 
actual systems. System dynamics models show how difficulties with actual social 
systems arise, and demonstrate why so many efforts to improve social systems have 
failed. Models can be constructed that are far superior to the intuitive models in 
people’s heads on which national social programs are now based.
System dynamics differs in two important ways from common practice in the 
social sciences and government. Other approaches assume that the major difficulty 
in understanding systems lies in shortage of information and data. Once data is col-
lected, people have felt confident in interpreting the implications. I differ on both of 
these attitudes. The problem is not shortage of data but rather inability to perceive 
the consequences of information we already possess. The system dynamics approach 
starts with concepts and information on which people are already acting. Generally, 
available information about system structure and decision-making policies is suffi-
cient. Available information is assembled into a computer model that can show 
behavioral consequences of well-known parts of a system. Generally, behavior is 
different from what people have assumed.

Counterintuitive Nature of Social Systems
Our first insights into complex social systems came from corporate work. Time after 
time we went into corporations that were having severe and well-known difficulties. 
The difficulties would be obvious, such as falling market share, low profitability, or 
instability of employment. Such difficulties were known throughout the company 
and were discussed in the business press.
One can enter a troubled company and discuss what people see as the causes and 
solutions to their problems. One finds that people perceive reasonably correctly their 
immediate environments. They know what they are trying to accomplish. They 
know the crises which will force certain actions. They are sensitive to the power 
structure of the organization, to traditions, and to their own personal goals and wel-
fare. When interviewing circumstances are conducive to frank disclosure, people 
state what they are doing and can give rational reasons for their actions. In a troubled 
company, people are usually trying in good conscience and to the best of their abili-
ties to help solve the major difficulties. Policies are being followed that they believe 
will alleviate the difficulties. One can combine the stated policies into a computer 
model to show the consequences of how the policies interact with one another. In 
many instances it emerges that the known policies describe a system which actually 
causes the observed troubles. In other words, the known and intended practices of 
the organization are sufficient to create the difficulties being experienced. Usually, 
problems are blamed on outside forces, but a dynamic analysis often shows how 
internal policies are causing the troubles. In fact, a downward spiral can develop in 
which the presumed solutions make the difficulties worse and thereby cause greater 
incentives to redouble the very actions that are the causes of trouble.
The same downward spiral frequently develops in government. Judgment and 
debate lead to a program that appears to be sound. Commitment increases to the 
apparent solution. If the presumed solution actually makes matters worse, the pro-
cess by which degradation happens is not evident. So, when the troubles increase, 
the efforts are intensified that are actually worsening the situation.

Donella Meadows
Donella Meadows – known as Dana to her many friends – was an environmental 
scientist and activist. She was a prolific writer, best known for a single book, The 
Limits to Growth (Meadows et al. 1972) which sold millions of copies, but she was 
also the author of several other books and a widely-read weekly newspaper column. 
As an activist, she lived the life she advocated, working as an organic farmer and 
living in a sustainable community.
Meadows was born in 1941 in Illinois. Her education was solidly scientific – she 
took a BA in chemistry from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1963, and a Ph.D. in 
biophysics from Harvard in 1968. She began work as a postdoctoral researcher in 
biophysics at Harvard, taking a year off for an overland trip through Asia. She 
returned from the trip to Harvard but shortly thereafter left to work at MIT for 
2  years on the Club of Rome world modelling project. In 1972, she moved to 
Dartmouth College where she taught environmental studies and system dynamics 
until she resigned her post in 1985 to concentrate on environmental activism. She 
founded several environmental institutes, wrote extensively, lived life as simply and 
close to the land as possible, and worked as a visiting scholar and fellow in a num-
ber of different academic and non-governmental organisations. She died from bac-
terial meningitis, after a short illness, in New Hampshire in 2001.
Her long trip to Asia in the late 1960s had a powerful impact on her personal and 
academic life. She visited a series of countries, including Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, 
Pakistan, and India – as she wryly commented much later, “in those days Americans 
were welcome in all those countries” (D. L. Meadows 2002, p. 109) – living as 
simply as the people in the villages they visited, consuming no meat or alcohol, cut 
off from television and newspapers for weeks at a time, even finding hot showers to 
be a luxury. Returning to the US was a major shock: “Looking with Asian eyes, we 
couldn’t believe how much stuff people had. We saw how little the stuff had to do 
with happiness. We also had strong memories of the poverty, the erosion, the 
deforestation, and the hunger we had seen. The world was very real to us. We 

108
resolved to live our lives in a way more consistent with the whole of it” (D. H.
Meadows 2002, p. 109). This experience led her to move to an organic farm in New 
Hampshire, and to embrace an idea of self-sufficiency. Meadows’ integrity, the 
consistency between her lifestyle and the ideas she advocated, was extraordinary – 
as one tribute following her death said:
More than anyone I have ever met, Dana lived by the famous systems credo, ‘Think 
Globally, Act Locally’. In her columns she wrote of the damage to the earth and its inhabit-
ants caused by pesticides, herbicides, and factory farming. At home she was an organic 
farmer. From her sheep came wool she carded, dyed, spun, and knit into beautiful sweaters, 
socks, mittens, and more. The farm yielded a bounty of the most delicious food; the waste 
made compost and fed the chickens; their eggs nourished the people; the chicken manure 
enriched the garden. She truly closed the loop. (Sterman 2002, p. 103)
She became involved in the project that made her famous almost by accident. 
After returning from Asia, her husband Dennis (who had taken his Ph.D. in the 
System Dynamics group at MIT) returned to MIT and quickly became involved in 
the Club of Rome world modelling project, whose origins are described in the chap-
ter of this book on Jay Forrester. Hearing about the project and noticing that “it 
sounded like a much more sophisticated version of the connections we had been 
making as we bumped over the roads of Asia” (Meadows 2007, p. 192), she post-
poned her return to her Harvard postdoctoral fellowship to attend the 2-week seminar 
Forrester ran for the Club of Rome members. Her enthusiasm for the project was so 
great that she resigned her Harvard fellowship and worked on it without pay for the 
next 2 years. The system dynamics model, based on Forrester’s original model, was 
known as World3. Each model was built up of five sectors – population, industry, 
agriculture, natural resources, and the environment. The project team consisted of 
seventeen researchers, led by Dennis Meadows. Donella’s role was to write the popu-
lation sector of World3, “integrating biological, social, cultural and economic factors 
in an endogenous account of fertility, aging, and mortality; in my view the best demo-
graphic model of its time, and still worthy of study today” (Sterman 2002, p. 102).
Eight months into the project, a meeting was held with the Club of Rome to pres-
ent the project’s initial findings. At that meeting, Jay Forrester argued strongly that 
the primary cause of the cluster of global problems being studied was growth, 
“exponential growth of energy use, material flows, and population against the 
earth’s physical limits. That which all the world sees as the solution to its problems 
is in fact a cause of those problems” (Meadows 2007, p. 193). Linking her experi-
ences in Asia with this argument, Meadows came to feel that “this fixation on growth 
… was a boastful, bullying, living thing, with its own malignant needs” (Kleiner 
1996, p. 212). The Club of Rome’s members heard this view and the initial results 
of the model respectfully, but their talk was still of different, albeit more benevolent, 
forms of growth as solutions to the world’s problems. Frustrated, Meadows felt that 
the best route was to express these ideas more clearly, with little recourse to techni-
cal data. She produced a short paper for the Club of Rome, which gradually grew 
over the course of 1971 in response to comments from Club members, and which 
11  Donella Meadows

109
was extended to a short book at the request of the Club of Rome’s president, Italian 
industrialist Aurelio Peccei.
The book was published early the following year, as The Limits to Growth 
(Meadows et  al. 1972). The effect of the book was extraordinary. It was 
­well-­publicised – the publisher was a think-tank, Potomac Associates, who as a mat-
ter of course sent copies of their publications to politicians and policy-makers 
around the world, and organised a 1-day symposium at the Smithsonian Institute in 
Washington DC, with several television crews present. Forrester’s earlier book on 
the world model (Forrester 1971) had already been a bestseller, and this new book 
was even more widely read. Limits to Growth went on to be published in 30 lan-
guages and to sell around ten million copies.
The book discussed the nature and problems of exponential growth, describing 
and drawing on the World3 model. It presented three major conclusions (Meadows 
et al. 1972, pp. 23–24):
	1.	 If the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, 
food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth 
on this planet will be reached sometime within the next 100 years. The most 
probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both popu-
lation and industrial capacity.
	2.	 It is possible to alter these growth trends and to establish a condition of ecologi-
cal and economic stability that is sustainable far into the future. The state of 
global equilibrium could be designed so that the basic material needs of each 
person on earth are satisfied and each person has an equal opportunity to realize 
his individual human potential.
	3.	 If the world’s people decide to strive for this second outcome rather than the first, 
the sooner they begin working to attain it, the greater will be their chances of 
success.
It is important to realise that these conclusions were established and backed up 
by very rigorous computer-based modelling. Of course, Limits to Growth was not 
the first widely-read book to argue that humanity was living beyond its collective 
means – that argument had been made by many authors, ranging from Henry David 
Thoreau to Rachel Carson. However, it was one of the first books to make this argu-
ment with such a strong scientific basis, and that added greatly to the book’s impact. 
As well as being widely read, the book was somewhat controversial – as Kleiner 
(1996, p. 214) puts it, “economists and economic writers turned on [it] throughout 
America and Europe, setting off a firestorm that would inflame the debate about 
economic growth for another 20 years”. Thirty years after the book was published, 
three of the original project team updated and re-ran the model and concluded that 
“the highly aggregated scenarios of World3 still appear, after 30 years, to be surpris-
ingly accurate” (Meadows et al. 2005, p. xviii).
Following the Club of Rome project, Meadows moved in 1972 to work at 
Dartmouth College, a prestigious but traditional university where she was the first 
11  Donella Meadows

110
woman ever to gain tenure. She was a well-regarded and influential teacher. One of 
her students was John Sterman, later Jay Forrester’s successor as head of the sys-
tem dynamics group at MIT, who moved into the subject specifically to learn 
from her.
Dennis Meadows later described her as “a brilliant teacher – dedicated, creative, 
caring, and effective” (D. L. Meadows 2002, p. 202) and also noted that she taught 
through her writing, calling it “a treasure chest for those of us trying to understand 
the field, increase our own mastery, teach our skills to others, or enhance our 
effectiveness in communicating our results to others” (D. L. Meadows 2002, p. 204).
While at Dartmouth, Meadows published a number of books on environmental 
issues and co-founded the Balaton Group, an international network of sustainability 
researchers and practitioners which she ran for many years and which still exists 
today. She also wrote a highly insightful book on the nature of modelling which 
examined in detail the nature and implications of several well-established computer 
models. She and her co-author concluded this book by arguing that:
Modellers can see themselves as well-meaning but basically powerless pawns in the system 
of political shoving, at the mercy of clients and funders who are bent on trivial purposes and 
who are not likely to follow any advice that is different from what they already thought. 
They can see themselves as removed, objective, purified by the truth as revealed within 
social statistics and high R2 values. … Or modellers can see themselves as responsible not 
to parochial, short-term interests, but to all humankind. They can see themselves as simpli-
fiers, clarifiers, and fellow-explorers. They can listen more than they talk, ask the questions 
people really want asked, draw forth visions, designs, and experiments. They can be com-
fortable with the fact that they have glands, hearts, values, beliefs, moral stands, and blind 
spots. They can be willing to be wrong, vulnerable, caring, and idealistic. They can hold the 
highest intellectual standards of scientific hypothesis-formation and disproof, along with 
the highest human standards of integrity, compassion, and truthfulness. (Meadows and 
Robinson 1985, p. 433)
In 1985, she left Dartmouth, although she remained an adjunct professor there 
and connected to other universities, receiving a Pew Scholarship and a MacArthur 
Fellowship, the latter being highly prestigious. One of her main roles for the rest of 
her life was as an environmental activist, constantly urging people to think and to 
live better. In particular, she began a weekly newspaper column, The Global Citizen, 
on environmental issues from a systems perspective, producing more than 800 col-
umns and published by newspapers throughout the United States. In her final col-
umn, published just 3 weeks before her death, she wrote that “if we believe that it’s 
effectively over, that we are fatally flawed, that the most greedy and short-sighted 
among us will always be permitted to rule, that we can never constrain our con-
sumption and destruction, that each of us is too small and helpless to do anything, 
that we should just give up and enjoy our SUVs while they last, well, then yes, it’s 
over” (Meadows 2001).
Meadows had a profound commitment to community building. On the farm she 
bought and established with her husband Dennis (who she later divorced while 
retaining a close working relationship), she welcomed many guests for long and 
short stays. In what turned out to be the final years of her life, she created a new 
11  Donella Meadows

111
intentional co-housing community, Cobb Hill, not far from her original farm. She 
also established the Sustainability Institute, based at the farm, with the vision that 
“the institute will work on the Big Picture; the community will work on the practical 
implementation of that picture in one particular place” (Meadows 1996). The insti-
tute is now part of a larger organisation, the Academy for Systems Change. Members 
of the institute have created many other organisations devoted to sustainable devel-
opment, and many have written of Meadows’ profound role as a mentor to their 
work (e.g. Sawin 2017).
While she emphasised the crucial importance of personal action in the face of 
environmental disaster, Meadows also took the view that this and related issues such 
as global poverty and war had to be addressed at a higher systemic level. She devel-
oped her ideas on the nature of systemic development into a coherent view that 
united individual and collective change. In particular she wrote a brilliant paper on 
places to intervene in a system (Meadows 1999), where she presents twelve possible 
‘leverage points’, from specifics such as transport networks or the structure of infor-
mation flows to more fundamental issues like the mindset underlying a system. She 
put all these ideas together into a book which she was working on at the time of her 
death and which was published posthumously, Thinking in Systems (Meadows and 
Wright 2009), a clear and coherent introduction to systems thinking as derived from 
system dynamics. This book has been read and used widely as a teaching text since 
its publication (e.g. Mobus 2018), preserving Meadows’ deep insights and powerful 
communication long after her death.
Donella Meadows spent decades living the life she felt was needed for the world, 
and inspiring others to live and work in ways that also would change the world. The 
hope she felt and displayed can be seen in much of her writing but vividly in the 
following passage:
It is difficult to speak of or to practice love, friendship, generosity, understanding, or soli-
darity within a system whose rules, goals, and information streams are geared for lesser 
human qualities. But we try, and we urge you to try. Be patient with yourself and others as 
you and they confront the difficulty of a changing world. Understand and empathize with 
inevitable resistance; there is some resistance, some clinging to the ways of unsustainabil-
ity, within each of us. Include everyone in the new world. Everyone will be needed. Seek 
out and trust the best human instincts in yourself and in everyone. Listen to the cynicism 
around you and pity those who believe it, but don’t believe it yourself. (Meadows et al. 
1992, p. 234)

People who are raised in the industrial world and who get enthused about sys-

here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the 
computer, here at last, is the key to prediction and control. This mistake is likely 
because the mindset of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction 
and control. I assumed that at first too. We all assumed it, as eager systems students 
at the great institution called MIT. […]
But self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. 
They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. 
The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealiz-
able. The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be 
achieved only temporarily, at best. We can never fully understand our world, not in 
the way our reductionistic science has led us to expect. […]
Systems thinking leads to another conclusion, however – waiting, shining, obvi-
ous as soon as we stop being blinded by the illusion of control. It says that there is 
plenty to do, of a different sort of ‘doing’. The future can’t be predicted, but it can 
be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but 
they can be designed and redesigned. We can’t surge forward with certainty into a 
world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even 
profit from them. We can’t impose our will upon a system. We can listen to what 
the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work 
together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our 
will alone.
We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!
I already knew that, in a way before I began to study systems. I had learned about 
dancing with great powers from whitewater kayaking, from gardening, from play-
ing music, from skiing. All those endeavors require one to stay wide awake, pay 
close attention, participate flat out, and respond to feedback. It had never occurred 
to me that those same requirements might apply to intellectual work, to manage-
ment, to government, to getting along with people.
But there it was, the message emerging from every computer model we made. 
Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to 
calculate. It requires our full humanity – our rationality, our ability to sort out truth 
from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.
I will summarize the most general ‘systems wisdoms’ I have absorbed from 
modeling complex systems and hanging out with modelers. These are the take-­
home lessons, the concepts and practices that penetrate the discipline of systems so 
deeply that one begins, however imperfectly, to practice them not just in one’s pro-
fession, but in all of life.
The list probably isn’t complete, because I am still a student in the school of 
systems. And it isn’t unique to systems thinking. There are many ways to learn to 
dance. But here, as a start-off dancing lesson, are the practices I see my colleagues 
adopting, consciously or unconsciously, as they encounter systems.
11  Donella Meadows

1. Get the Beat
Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it’s a piece of 
music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If 
it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around 
a long time to tell you what has happened. If possible, find or make a time graph of 
actual data from the system. Peoples’ memories are not always reliable when it 
comes to timing. […]
2. Listen to the Wisdom of the System
Aid and encourage the forces and structures that help the system run itself. Don’t be 
an unthinking intervener and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities. 
Before you charge in to make things better, pay attention to the value of what’s 
already there. […]
3. Expose Your Mental Models to the Open Air
Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, 
is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be shot at. Invite others 
to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a cham-
pion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as 
possible. Consider all of them plausible until you find some evidence that causes 
you to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence 
that rules out an assumption with which you might have confused your own 
identity. […]
4. Stay Humble. Stay a Learner
Systems thinking has taught me to trust my intuition more and my figuring-out 
rationality less, to lean on both as much as I can, but still to be prepared for sur-
prises. Working with systems, on the computer, in nature, among people, in organi-
zations, constantly reminds me of how incomplete my mental models are, how 
complex the world is, and how much I don’t know. […]
Reading from Meadows’ work

114
5. Honor and Protect Information
A decision-maker can’t respond to information he or she doesn’t have, can’t respond 
accurately to information that is inaccurate, can’t respond in a timely way to infor-
mation that is late. I would guess that 99% of what goes wrong in systems goes 
wrong because of faulty or missing information. […].
6. Locate Responsibility in the System
Look for the ways the system creates its own behavior. Do pay attention to the trig-
gering events, the outside influences that bring forth one kind of behavior from the 
system rather than another. Sometimes those outside events can be controlled (as in 
reducing the pathogens in drinking water to keep down incidences of infectious 
disease). But sometimes they can’t. And sometimes blaming or trying to control the 
outside influence blinds one to the easier task of increasing responsibility within the 
system. […]
7. Make Feedback Policies for Feedback Systems
[…] You can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting system cannot be governed by 
a static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to 
design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where 
there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but 
meta-feedback loops – loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies 
that design learning into the management process.
8. Pay Attention to What Is Important, Not Just What Is 
Quantifiable
Our culture, obsessed with numbers, has given us the idea that what we can measure 
is more important than what we can’t measure. You can look around and make up 
your own mind about whether quantity or quality is the outstanding characteristic of 
the world in which you live. […] No one can (precisely) define or measure justice, 
democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can (precisely) define or mea-
sure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren’t designed to pro-
duce them, if we don’t speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, 
they will cease to exist.
11  Donella Meadows

115
9. Go for the Good of the Whole
Don’t maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole. As 
Kenneth Boulding once said, don’t go to great trouble to optimize something that 
never should be done at all. Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as cre-
ativity, stability, diversity; resilience, and sustainability – whether they are easily 
measured or not. […]
10. Expand Time Horizons
The official time horizon of industrial society doesn’t extend beyond what will hap-
pen after the next election or beyond the payback period of current investments. The 
time horizon of most families still extends farther than that – through the lifetimes 
of children or grandchildren. […] When you’re walking along a tricky, curving, 
unknown, surprising, obstacle-strewn path, you’d be a fool to keep your head down 
and look just at the next step in front of you. You’d be equally a fool just to peer far 
ahead and never notice what’s immediately under your feet. You need to be watch-
ing both the short and long terms – the whole system.
11. Expand Thought Horizons
[…] Seeing systems whole requires more than being ‘interdisciplinary’, if that word 
means, as it usually does, putting together people from different disciplines and let-
ting them talk past each other. Interdisciplinary communication works only if there 
is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines 
are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They 
will have to go into learning mode, to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, 
by each other and by the system. It can be done. It’s very exciting when it happens.
12. Expand the Boundary of Caring
Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time 
horizons and thought horizons; above all it means expanding the horizons of caring. 
There are moral reasons for doing that, of course. And if moral arguments are not 
sufficient, systems thinking provides the practical reasons to back up the moral 
ones. The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either 
from other human beings or from the global ecosystem. It will not be possible in this 
integrated world for your heart to succeed if your lungs fail, or for your company to 
Reading from Meadows’ work

116
succeed if your workers fail, or for the rich in Los Angeles to succeed if the poor in 
Los Angeles fail, or for Europe to succeed if Africa fails, or for the global economy 
to succeed if the global environment fails. […]
13. Celebrate Complexity
Let’s face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and chaotic. It is 
dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not 
in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, 
not uniformity. That’s what makes the world interesting, that’s what makes it beauti-
ful, and that’s what makes it work. […]
14. Hold Fast to the Goal of Goodness
Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by 
the culture, as typical. […] The far more numerous examples of human goodness 
are barely noticed. They are Not News. They are exceptions. Must have been a saint. 
Can’t expect everyone to behave like that.
And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual 
behavior narrows. […] We know what to do about eroding goals. Don’t weigh the 
bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute. […]

Chapter 12
Peter Senge
Peter Michael Senge is a management academic and consultant. He has been prin-
cipally responsible for drawing together and popularising the concept of the learn-
ing organisation. Through his work he has brought systems thinking (or at least a 
particular form of it) to the attention of a very wide audience. His ideas were ini-
tially applied in business organisations, but they have encompassed an wider range 
of settings. He has described himself as an ‘idealistic pragmatist’, and his goal is 
idealistic: “how we can build the capacity to address the common systemic issues 
that are taking our society in directions no one really wants to go (Senge et al. 
2015, p.5).
Senge (pronounced Sen-gee) was born in 1947 in Los Angeles where he also 
spent his childhood. He attended university at Stanford, studying engineering, grad-
uating in 1970. As a student he “became interested in population growth, a topic that 
got him thinking about the world and big issues like overpopulation, hunger, and the 
environment” (Dumaine 1994). This concern led him to graduate study at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the system dynamics group, taking 
an MSc in social systems modelling in 1972. He continued at MIT as a researcher, 
completing his Ph.D. in 1978, on a comparison between an aspect of economic 
modelling through the System Dynamics National Model (see Chap. 10 on Jay 
Forrester) and neoclassical economic modelling. Although he was working in Jay 
Forrester’s group and regarded Forrester as his intellectual mentor, Senge’s Ph.D. was 
supervised by a rising young academic (a near contemporary) who later became an 
investment banker, Nathaniel Mass. Following his Ph.D., Senge began work as a 
lecturer at MIT, where he still works – he is currently a senior lecturer in the Sloan 
School of Management.
The first steps towards Senge’s conception of the learning organisation came in 
the mid-1970s. While still working on his Ph.D., Senge developed a training event, 
the Leadership and Mastery seminar, along with Charlie Kiefer (a management con-
sultant) and Robert Fritz (a composer and researcher). The seminar, intended to 
train senior managers in issues of system dynamics, personal mastery and shared 

120
vision, has been run many times – Senge has talked of having led the seminar more 
than 250 times (Scharmer 1996). This seminar formed the basis of Senge, Kiefer 
and Fritz’s consultancy firm Innovation Associates, where much of Senge’s key 
thinking developed.
His experience of modelling and management development crucially shaped his 
work on the learning organisation. The latter also arose from Senge’s personality. 
Senge has been a Zen Buddhist for many years, regularly meditates, and has studied 
with Buddhist teachers in the United States and China. In most of his writing his 
religious perspective is tacit and demonstrates itself in calls for personal mastery 
and the importance of discipline, although in his recent work, he has taken a more 
explicitly spiritual focus.
Through the 1980s, Senge developed his ideas further, through work both at 
Innovation Associates, and at MIT, where he became director of the Systems 
Thinking and Organizational Learning programme. As well as Forrester, his key 
intellectual influences were Chris Argyris (who had developed the concept of organ-
isational learning, along with Donald Schön), W. Edwards Deming (the founder of 
total quality management, strongly influenced by systems thinking) and David 
Bohm (a quantum physicist who worked extensively on the importance of dialogue). 
Through his consultancy, he also became highly influenced by a group of senior 
executives of considerable wisdom, whose ideas and experiences he draws on 
extensively in his work, including Arie de Geus and Joseph Jaworski, who both 
worked on strategy and scenario planning at the Royal Dutch/Shell group and 
William O’Brien, chief executive of Hanover Insurance (an American general insur-
ance company).
These elements in Senge’s work – system dynamics, his consultancy and espe-
cially the Leadership and Mastery seminar, his inspiration from a set of key aca-
demics, and his relationship with business leaders – came together in his conception 
of the learning organisation. He expressed that synthesis in a book: The Fifth 
Discipline, where he described a learning organisation as one where “people con-
tinually expand their capacity to create the results they truly desire, where new and 
expansive patterns of thinking are nurtured, where collective aspiration is set free, 
and where people are continually learning how to learn together” (Senge 1990, 
p. 3). It is hard to over-stress the importance of the book. It has sold over one million 
copies worldwide, it has launched a whole new industry in management develop-
ment and consultancy, and it is quoted by a high proportion of those subsequently 
writing on organisational learning.
The development of The Fifth Discipline as a book went through several phases. 
Originally, Senge planned to co-author a book with Arie de Geus, who in 1988 
wrote a celebrated article under the title ‘Planning as Learning’ in which he argued 
that “the ability to learn faster than competitors may be the only sustainable 
­competitive advantage” (de Geus 1988, p. 71). After 2 years of work Senge and de 
Geus decided to produce separate books. To complete his book, Senge turned for 
help to Art Kleiner, a journalist who acted as an editor and writing coach. Kleiner 
helped to clarify Senge’s ideas in one very important respect:
12  Peter Senge

121
“The idea of disciplines emerged in conversations with Art. He kept after me to express the 
essential message of the book in just one sentence. Finally I realized that everything in my 
life in which I had been deeply interested was a discipline, and that discipline was the 
thread that ran through everything I had to say in the book” (Senge, interviewed by Galagan 
1991, p. 38).
The five disciplines of the book are systems thinking, personal mastery, mental 
models, shared vision and team learning. Each of these rests upon important work 
carried out previously by others. The discipline of mental models draws on Argyris 
and Schön’s work on action science and reflective practice. Team learning draws on 
Argyris’ work on organisational defensive routines, and also the work of the physi-
cist David Bohm on ways of fostering dialogue within groups as a form of learning. 
The disciplines of personal mastery and shared vision come from Senge’s work 
with Innovation Associates in the Leadership and Mastery seminar. Finally, systems 
thinking in Senge’s book is a modified form of system dynamics based on describ-
ing systems with diagrams which show a series of interlocking feedback loops. 
These diagrams frequently fall into a set of standard patterns called system arche-
types. Systems thinking is described as the fifth discipline because it is “the disci-
pline that integrates the disciplines, fusing them into a coherent body of theory and 
practice” (Senge 1990, p. 12).
Senge’s use of the term ‘systems thinking’ in the book has proved controversial. 
The term was already in widespread use to refer to a large variety of systems 
approaches, but Senge restricts it solely to his modified form of system dynamics. 
The success of The Fifth Discipline has led to Senge’s use of the term becoming 
widespread, especially in the United States. As Lane (1995, p. 1160) puts it, the risk 
of Senge’s use of the term is that it “so easily leads people to believe that there is no 
difference between the works of Forrester and those of, say, Beer and Checkland”. 
The problem in this view is not that Senge uses the term ‘systems thinking’ but that 
he solely equates it to his particular approach, with no mention of other approaches. 
Wolstenholme (1999) suggested the term “qualitative system dynamics” for Senge’s 
approach, but this phrase has not gained popularity. In fact, Lane (1995, p. 1159) 
quotes Senge as having said to a system dynamics conference that “I gravitated 
naively to the term ‘systems thinking’ … I never intended to be disrespectful”, and 
in later books he refers to other forms of systems thinking as well as his own. 
However, the use of the term solely to refer to Senge’s qualitative system dynamics 
is still commonplace, causing some confusion.
In fact, the mainstream system dynamics (SD) community has been somewhat 
disquieted by the way that Senge has developed their ideas, and especially the fact 
that he presents lessons from SD without the use of simulation models. As Jay 
Forrester himself has written, “The danger comes from encouraging people to 
believe that systems thinking is the whole story. … It is only from the actual 
­simulations that inconsistencies within our mental models are revealed. Systems 
thinking can be a first step toward a dynamic understanding of complex problems, 
but it is far from sufficient” (Forrester 2007, p. 355). Nonetheless, it is clear that 
Senge has brought considerable publicity and interest to SD, and that many people, 
inspired by his work, have gone further into the more detailed simulation-based 
12  Peter Senge

122
approach – the success of Sterman’s (2000) thorough textbook on SD is one indica-
tion of this.
We have mentioned the extent to which Senge drew upon others’ ideas (giving 
them proper credit) in weaving together the different parts of The Fifth Discipline. 
Indeed, he has said explicitly that “the book was a by-product of about 15 years of 
working by several persons including me. The Western idea that a person owns an 
idea is bizarre – ideas are very much a product of our lifetime and of all the people 
who influence us directly and indirectly” (Senge, interviewed by Fulmer and Keys 
1998, pp. 34–5). As the popularity of the book spread, this community became more 
explicitly defined. Senge had worked for some years with senior managers at MIT, 
in what became the Organisational Learning Center (OLC), and with consultants at 
Innovation Associates. The OLC had close involvement from managers in 19 large 
companies, but was constrained by its being aligned to a particular university and in 
a single geographical setting. In 1997, the OLC became independent of MIT as the 
Society for Organisational Learning (SoL), an international organisation composed 
of academics, consultants and business leaders, with Senge as its founding chairper-
son. SoL was designed to enable organisational learning through its structures as 
well as its activities, and was intended to be distributed and decentralised in its 
power structures; it was inspired by the work of Dee Hock, founder of the highly 
distributed Visa credit card network (Fulmer and Keys 1998).
A further expression of the community of practitioners around Senge has been 
the publication of three books aimed at practitioners, which take further the ideas of 
The Fifth Discipline. Each of the three books has Senge has its lead author (and 
leader of the process which produced them) but was written by a large group of 
practitioners in the ideas discussed. The first of these, The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook, 
was intended for those who asked the question “This is great, but what do we do 
Monday morning?” (Senge et al. 1994, p. 5). It was constructed by Art Kleiner 
through writing up discussions with over 70 contributors (Kleiner 1998). The 
Fieldbook, which is full of short and practical articles, was highly successful among 
practitioners, with one describing the way he kept “two copies, one intact and the 
other separated into loose leaf form” (Godfrey 1999). Three further books followed 
using a similar multi-authored format – The Dance of Change (Senge et al. 1999) 
looked at ways to solve the consultants’ dilemma that so many well-meant change 
processes fail; Schools that Learn (Senge et al. 2012) applied the idea of the learn-
ing organisation explicitly to the needs of educational institutions; and The 
Necessary Revolution (Senge et al. 2008) presented techniques for transformation 
of business practices and models towards sustainability.
The last two of these books reflect the gradual widening of Senge’s interests 
beyond the business community. He has remarked that “business was always a vehi-
cle for me” rather than an end in itself (Senge and Crainer 2008, p.73). In this 
regard, he has focused his work increasingly on issues of elementary and high 
school education, observing that “organizations operate the way they do largely 
because we have been socialized into a non-reflective, linear, and submissive stance 
by virtue of our education … If we ever seek to bring about deep change to society, 
it’s a fantasy to think we’ll do it without deep change in education” (Eisler 2015, 
pp. 12–13).
12  Peter Senge

123
More fundamentally, Senge has become increasingly concerned with profound 
change in the world, both in spiritual terms and in terms of sustainability. In Presence 
(Senge et al. 2005), he and his co-authors address how fundamental change can 
occur in individuals and organisations. They equate this change, a deeper kind of 
organisational learning, with presence, “being fully conscious and aware in the 
present moment … deep listening, [being] open beyond one’s preconceptions and 
historical ways of making sense” (Senge et al. 2005, p. 13). They argue that this 
change is necessary both for individuals and for large organisations to enable the 
planet to survive in the face of climate change and environmental destruction. The 
book is quite explicitly spiritual in its focus, drawing on those religious traditions 
which emphasise mystical and holistic practices, especially Buddhism (the book is 
dedicated to the Buddhist cognitive scientist Francisco Varela, whose work is dis-
cussed in the chapter of this book on Maturana) but also other religions. Senge also 
continues to work with leaders of large organisations in building significant change 
in them as individuals and in the organisations they run.
An interesting question about Senge is the extent to which he can be called a 
‘management guru’ (as he is described by some). In many ways, he is a quintessen-
tial guru – he is an academic who has published bestselling books, given inspira-
tional speeches to large conferences (for large fees), worked comfortably with 
leaders of large companies, and drawn on his consultancy experiences to write fur-
ther works. Yet he is committed to a much deeper level of personal and organisa-
tional change than many of those called management gurus, and as Brad Jackson 
(2001, p. 155) argues, he “projects a studiously anti-guru persona through his soft-­
spoken, high-pitched voice and donnish attire”. Moreover, he has not sought an 
ongoing leadership role in the organisations he has established, and almost all his 
writing has been as a co-author within a large team. He commented that the success 
of The Fifth Discipline made some believe that the ideas belonged solely to him, 
rather than being a collective effort, and that “one reason I like the subsequent field-
books is that they clearly demonstrate that the work has always arisen from a com-
munity of practitioners, consultants, and researchers” (Senge et al. 2015, p.2).
Peter Senge has made extraordinary changes to individual and collective under-
standing of the way organisations learn, and the way that systems thinking can help 
this learning. He advocates profound change and is unafraid to exhibit it in his own 
way of working. In his interest in building learning communities, he has built an 
extensive community of practitioners and scholars working to help organisations 
learn and to change for the better.

Today’s Problems Come from Yesterday’s ‘Solutions’
[…] Often we are puzzled by the causes of our problems; when we merely need to 
look at our own solutions to other problems in the past. […] Police enforcement 
officials will recognize their own version of this law: arresting narcotics dealers on 
Thirtieth Street, they find that they have simply transferred the crime centre to 
Fortieth Street. Or, even more insidiously, they learn that a new citywide outbreak 
of drug-related crime is the result of federal officials intercepting a large shipment 
of narcotics – which reduced the drug supply, drove up the price, and caused more 
crime by addicts desperate to maintain their habit.
Solutions that merely shift problems from one part of a system to another often 
go undetected because [those] who ‘solved’ the first problem are different from 
those who inherit the new problem.
The Harder You Push, the Harder the System Pushes Back
In George Orwell’s Animal Farm, the horse Boxer always had the same answer to 
any difficulty: “I will work harder”, he said. At first, his well-intentioned diligence 
inspired everyone, but gradually, his hard work began to backfire in subtle ways. 
The harder he worked, the more work there was to do. What he didn’t know was that 
the pigs who managed the farm were actually manipulating them all for their own 
profit. Boxer’s diligence actually helped to keep the other animals from seeing what 
the pigs were doing. Systems thinking has a name for this phenomenon: 
‘Compensating feedback’: when well intentioned interventions call forth responses 
from the system that offset the benefits of the intervention. We all know what it feels 
like to be facing compensating feedback – the harder you push, the harder the sys-
tem pushes back; the more effort you expend trying to improve matters, the more 
effort seems to be required. […]
Behaviour Grows Better Before It Grows Worse
[…] Compensating feedback usually involves a ‘delay’, a time lag between the 
short-term benefit and the long-term disbenefit. […] In complex human systems 
there are always many ways to make things look better in the short run. Only even-
tually does the compensating feedback come back to haunt you.
The key word is ‘eventually’. The delay […] explains why systemic problems 
are so hard to recognize. A typical solution feels wonderful, when it first cures the 
symptoms. Now there’s improvement; or maybe even the problem has gone away. It 
may be 2, 3, or 4 years before the problem returns, or some new, worse problem 
arrives. By that time, given how rapidly most people move from job to job, someone 
new is sitting in the chair.

The Easy Way Out Usually Leads Back In
[…] We all find comfort applying familiar solutions to problems, sticking to what 
we know best. […] After all, if the solution were easy to see or obvious to everyone, 
it probably would already have been found. Pushing harder and harder on familiar 
solutions, while fundamental problems persist or worsen, is a reliable indicator of 
nonsystemic thinking – what we often call the ‘what we need here is a bigger ham-
mer’ syndrome.
The Cure Can Be Worse than the Disease
Sometimes the easy or familiar solution is not only ineffective; sometimes it is 
addictive and dangerous. […] The long-term, most insidious consequence of apply-
ing nonsystemic solutions is increased need for more and more of the solution. […] 
The phenomenon of short-term improvements leading to long-term dependency is 
so common, it has its own name among systems thinkers – it’s called “Shifting the 
Burden to the Intervenor”. […]
Shifting the Burden structures show that any long-term solution must, as 
[Donella] Meadows says, “strengthen the ability of the system to shoulder its own 
burdens” (Meadows 1982). Sometimes that is difficult; other times it is surprisingly 
easy. A manager who has shifted the burden of his personnel problems onto a 
Human Relations Specialist may find that the hard part is deciding to take the bur-
den back; once that happens, learning how to handle people is mainly a matter of 
time and commitment.
Faster Is Slower
[…] For most American business people the best rate of growth is fast, faster, fast-
est. Yet, virtually all natural systems, from ecosystems to animals to organizations, 
have intrinsically optimal rates of growth. The optimal rate is far less than the fastest 
possible growth. When growth becomes excessive – as it does in cancer – the sys-
tem itself will seek to compensate by slowing down; perhaps putting the organiza-
tion’s survival at risk in the process. […]
When managers first start to appreciate how these systems principles have oper-
ated to thwart many of their own favorite interventions, they can be discouraged and 
disheartened. The systems principles can even become excuses for inaction – for 
doing nothing rather than possibly taking actions that might backfire, or even make 
matters worse. The real implications of the systems perspective are not inaction but 
a new type of action rooted in a new way of thinking – systems thinking is both 
more challenging and more promising than our normal ways of dealing with 
problems.

Cause and Effect Are Not Closely Related in Time and Space
Underlying all of the above problems is a fundamental characteristic of complex 
human systems: ‘cause’ and ‘effect’ are not close in time and space. By ‘effects’, I 
mean the obvious symptoms that indicate that there are problems – drug abuse, 
unemployment, starving children, falling orders, and sagging profits. By ‘cause’ I 
mean the interaction of the underlying system that is most responsible for generat-
ing the symptoms, and which, if recognized, could lead to changes producing last-
ing improvement. Why is this a problem? Because most of us assume they are – most 
of us assume, most of the time, that cause and effect are close in time and space.
When we play as children, problems are never far away from their solutions – as 
long, at least, as we confine our play to one group of toys. Years later, as managers, 
we tend to believe that the world works the same way. […] The root of our difficul-
ties is neither recalcitrant problems nor evil adversaries – but ourselves. There is a 
fundamental mismatch between the nature of reality in complex systems and our 
predominant ways of thinking about that reality. […]
Small Changes Can Produce Big Results – But the Areas 
of Highest Leverage – Are Often the Least Obvious
Some have called systems thinking the ‘new dismal science’ because it teaches that 
most obvious solutions don’t work – at best, they improve matters in the short run, 
only to make things worse in the long run. But there is another side to the story. For 
systems thinking also shows that small, well-focused actions can sometimes pro-
duce significant, enduring improvements, if they’re in the right place. Systems 
thinkers refer to this principle as ‘leverage’.
Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage 
lies, a change which – with a minimum of effort would lead to lasting, significant 
improvement. […]
There are no simple rules for finding high-leverage changes, but there are ways 
of thinking that make it more likely. Learning to see underlying ‘structures’ rather 
than ‘events’ is a starting point. […] Thinking in terms of processes of change rather 
than ‘snapshots’ is another.
You Can Have Your Cake and Eat It Too – But Not at Once
Sometimes, the knottiest dilemmas, when seen from the systems point, of view, 
aren’t dilemmas at all. [They] appear in a whole new light once you think con-
sciously of change over time.

For years, for example, American manufacturers thought they had to choose 
between low cost and high quality. “Higher quality products cost more to manufac-
ture”, they thought. “They take longer to assemble, require more expensive materi-
als and components, and entail more extensive quality controls.” What they didn’t 
consider was all the ways the increasing quality and lowering costs could go hand 
in hand, over time. What they didn’t consider was how basic improvements in work 
processes could eliminate rework, eliminate quality inspectors, reduce customer 
complaints, lower warranty costs, increase customer loyalty, and reduce advertising 
and sales promotion costs. They didn’t realize that they could have both goals, if 
they were willing to wait for one while they focused on the other. […]
Many apparent dilemmas […] are by-products of static thinking. They only 
appear as rigid ‘either-or’ choices, because we think of what is possible at a fixed 
point in time. Next month, it may be true that we must choose one or the other, but 
the real leverage lies in seeing how both can improve over time.
Dividing an Elephant in Half Does Not Produce Two Small 
Elephants
Living systems have integrity. Their character depends on the whole. The same is 
true for organizations; to understand the most challenging managerial issues requires 
seeing the whole system that generates the issues. […]
Seeing ‘whole elephants’ does not mean that every organizational issue can be 
understood only by looking at the entire organization. Some issues can be under-
stood only by looking at how major functions such as manufacturing, marketing, 
and research interact; but there are other issues where critical systemic forces arise 
within a given functional area; and others where the dynamics of an entire industry 
must be considered. The key principle, called the ‘principle of the system bound-
ary’, is that the interactions that must be examined are those most important to the 
issue at hand, regardless of parochial organizational boundaries. […]
Sometimes people go ahead and divide an elephant in half anyway. You don’t 
have two small elephants then; you have a mess. By a mess, I mean a complicated 
problem where there is no leverage to be found because the leverage lies in interac-
tions that cannot be seen from looking only at the piece you are holding.
There Is No Blame
We tend to blame outside circumstances for our problems. ‘Someone else’ – the 
competitors, the press, the changing mood of the marketplace, the government – did 
it to us. Systems thinking shows us that there is no outside; that you and the cause 
of your problems are part of a single system. The cure lies in your relationship with 
your ‘enemy’.

Chapter 13
C. West Churchman
Charles West Churchman was a philosopher of systems and management, who did 
more than anyone to bring ethical considerations into the field of systems thinking. 
He was a pioneer in several academic fields, always driven by what he described as 
his “moral outrage” (Churchman 1982, p. 17) that the human intellect is capable of 
organising society to solve the great problems of the world, such as malnutrition, 
poverty and war, and yet humanity allows these problems to persist. This moral 
outrage drove him to establish new fields, develop a range of influential theoretical 
concepts, and to work as a consultant to a number of important organisations. He 
was also a highly gifted teacher and developed in his students an acute critical and 
ethical awareness in his approach to systems thinking. A decade before his death, a 
former student summed up his life and contribution as follows (Mitroff 1994, p. 98):
West Churchman is a moral and intellectual beacon of hope and inspiration to those who 
have been privileged to know and to work closely with him. He has taught us to think 
deeply about science and management. He has schooled us in the systems approach. He has 
shown us how to rise above the narrow and unethical concerns of the prevailing disciplines. 
He has annoyed us with his questions about the obvious. Even more, he has amazed us with 
his insights. Beautiful ideas flow from sources deep within him that contemporary manage-
ment and science cannot even begin to understand, let alone talk about.
Churchman was deeply religious. He was born in 1913 as a Catholic in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – a distant ancestor travelled to the United States on the 
same ship as the founder of the state, William Penn. Churchman attended a Quaker 
school, learning there that “you can have a life dedicated to humanity – that was the 
best thing one could do” (quoted in van Gigch et al. 1997, p. 732). His religious 
background contributed to his moral outrage and his belief that systems thinking 
should be “committed to ascertaining not simply whether the decision maker’s 
choices lead to his desired ends, but whether they lead to ends that are ethically 
defensible” (Churchman 1979, p. 65). Van Gigch and McIntyre-Mills (2006, p. xiii) 
describe his defining characteristics as “humility and compassion”.

132
At the age of 17, as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, 
Churchman recorded in his journal that his life would be dedicated to bettering 
humanity (van Gigch et al. 1997). The only question was what field would best 
allow him to do this. His initial answer was philosophy, as the subject that was at the 
heart of knowledge, and he took all his degrees in philosophy, at the University of 
Pennsylvania (graduating with his Ph.D. in 1938) where he then became a faculty 
member. He was strongly influenced at Pennsylvania by the work of Edgar Singer 
(who had been a student of William James, the founder of the American pragmatist 
school of philosophy). As Churchman (1979, p. 9) later wrote, “Singer’s philosophi-
cal position had the theme of comprehensiveness, so that all aspects of the natural 
world were to be ‘swept in’ … he undertook to include values in explicit ways”. In 
keeping with Singer’s focus on values, Churchman also became an opponent of the 
then widely-held philosophical doctrine of logical positivism which sought to deny 
the importance of values in science.
Soon after taking his Ph.D., the Second World War began, and he spent 5 years 
working on statistical methods for quality control at an arms factory, the Frankford 
Arsenal. This experience led him further in the direction of applied philosophy – as 
he later recorded, he felt that “the enemy was Hitler and his successful armies, and 
not the logical positivists. Hitler was highly dangerous, while the positivists just 
sounded silly. This philosophical mind began to realize that philosophy should be 
used to study serious problems like war, security, and human living” (Churchman 
1994, p. 100). During the war, he also began a long collaboration with Russell 
Ackoff, initially his Ph.D. student but subsequently a colleague – for a period of 
about 20 years they worked so closely together that letters were sometimes addressed 
to “C. West Ackoff and Russell L. Churchman” (Ackoff 1988, p. 355).
Following the war, he returned to the University of Pennsylvania, and with 
Ackoff proposed the establishment of an ‘Institute of Experimental Method’ to take 
forward the application of philosophy, especially Singer’s pragmatism, to social 
issues (such as urban planning and organisational management). This idea was 
rejected as “far too worldly” by the philosophy department, and he left in 1948 to 
work at Wayne State University in Detroit (Mason and Mitroff 2015, p.  41). 
Churchman received recognition for his philosophical work in 1948, becoming edi-
tor of a prestigious journal, Philosophy of Science, which he edited until 1958. 
Nonetheless, he felt increasingly isolated in the philosophical community – well-­
regarded but unable to carry out his work on social change, viewed by his col-
leagues as too far outside the mainstream of the field. This continued to be a problem 
at Wayne, and after 2 years he left to join a new department in a new field: opera-
tions research, at the Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio. He did how-
ever meet his wife Gloria while living in Detroit, and they married in 1954.
Churchman’s years at Case, from 1951 to 1958, were crucial in the establishment 
of operations research (OR) as an academic discipline. OR had developed during 
the war, as the application of scientific principles to the management of military 
operations. It quickly developed a body of practical techniques which proved to be 
highly useful, and after the war these began to be applied to industrial management. 
Despite its practical success, OR had little academic basis, and it was Churchman’s 
13  C. West Churchman

133
great contribution to develop the field academically. In his years at Case, Churchman 
(working closely with Russell Ackoff who had also moved to Case) established the 
first Masters and Ph.D. programmes in OR, ran a series of influential annual confer-
ences, built up a group which grew to twenty academic staff, and published the first 
textbook in the field, Introduction to Operations Research (Churchman et al. 1957). 
He was also involved in the establishment of the parallel field of management sci-
ence (MS), and founding editor of the journal Management Science. The success of 
the textbook led Churchman to a new post in 1958, as professor at the University of 
California, Berkeley, where he remained for the rest of his career (until 1996).
Despite Churchman’s clear success in establishing operations research and man-
agement science as academic disciplines, these fields gradually moved away from 
his vision of a life dedicated to humanity and towards an emphasis on the details of 
the mathematical methods used in the fields. In a thorough analysis of the literature 
in OR and MS, Paucar-Caceres (2011) noted that Churchman had seldom been cited 
in American journals, although he had been more cited in European journals, con-
cluding that Churchman’s work (and that of Ackoff) “has remained peripheral to 
American MS developments” (p. 1463). As Ulrich (2004, p. 211) described it, com-
paring the situation with Churchman’s experience in philosophy, the OR and MS 
community “honoured its pioneer but did not really hear him”.
As his work at Berkeley developed, Churchman thus gradually shifted from OR 
and MS towards general systems theory, although in many ways, a systems approach 
was already present in his work, with the influence of Singer’s concept of compre-
hensiveness combined with his own concern for practical action. He was later to 
refer to his approach as ‘social systems design’.
In the 1960s, many of the most widely-used systems methods (such as systems 
analysis and systems engineering) had exactly the same flaws as Churchman had 
previously found in OR and MS: too great a faith in the power of rational planning, 
too little concern for values and ethics, and an over-focus on mathematical models. 
Through Churchman’s work, many of these shortcomings were addressed, and he 
began a shift towards the approaches later called soft and critical systems. He early 
on introduced a scepticism towards the power of rational planning: in his first major 
book on systems thinking, published in 1968 and selling over 200,000 copies, he 
wrote that “however a systems problem is solved – by planner, scientist, politician, 
anti-planner, or whomever  – the solution is wrong, even dangerously wrong” 
(Churchman 1968, p. 229). He did, however, argue in the same book that “the sys-
tems approach is not a bad idea” (Churchman 1968, p. 232), intending both to imply 
that systems approaches can be helpful and that they can be ethical.
He took these ideas forward in two further major books, which between them 
form the basis for a critical and ethical approach to systems: The Design of Inquiring 
Systems (Churchman 1971) and The Systems Approach and its Enemies (Churchman 
1979). These books are so full of insights that they are hard to summarise. The first, 
which is deeply philosophical but has been found to be highly relevant to informa-
tion systems design, is a tour through the work of a number of key philosophers, and 
their implications for designing systems. Churchman’s approach is to consider sys-
tems design as being one of making ‘whole system judgements’ – of making deci-
13  C. West Churchman

134
sions as to what is part of the system and what is outside of it (an approach later 
termed ‘boundary judgements’ by Ulrich, discussed in Chap. 16). A key part of this 
judgement process is the Weltanschauung (worldview) of the person making the 
judgement, a concept Churchman (1971) introduced into systems thinking from the 
philosophy of Immanuel Kant and was later to be drawn upon by a number of others.
Reynolds (2004, p. 542) describes the process of making whole systems judge-
ments as follows: “after initially being concerned with the holistic attempt at sweep-
ing in all relevant values and perspectives pertaining to a systems design, a process 
of unfolding draws out the implications of making the necessary and inevitable 
boundary judgements required for further purposeful action”. These related activi-
ties of sweeping-in and unfolding, which derive from Singer’s ideas, have been 
taken up by a number of systems authors using a critical approach.
Although Churchman’s view of systems to this point was broad, it did not yet 
take the full critical perspective implied by his earlier concerns. He incorporated this 
perspective by considering the prevalent view of systems as a process of rational 
planning (similar to that which Checkland would later term ‘hard systems thinking’), 
which omits the consideration of four key areas he termed its ‘enemies’ – politics, 
morality, religion and aesthetics. He discussed the relationship between each of 
these and the rational systems approach as a dialectical process – one where the two 
opposing views are contrasted and then combined in a new approach, a process he 
referred to as “being one’s own enemy” (Churchman 1979, p. 204). As he puts it, 
“the resultant being is neither a loose dreamer nor a hard thinker; to be the enemy 
means to release the bonds of hard rationality” (Churchman 1979, p. 205). In this 
work we can see the basis for much that followed in the critical approach to systems 
thinking – although some scholars would argue that Churchman’s work does not go 
far enough in its consideration of issues of power and inequality, Churchman gave 
considerable impetus and background to later work in this area.
A further contribution that Churchman made to systems ideas was his naming of 
the now-widespread concept of ‘wicked problems’. The concept arose from a semi-
nar series that Churchman led at Berkeley, to which he invited the design theorist 
Horst Rittel who had recently started teaching at Berkeley. Rittel outlined the differ-
ence between problems that can be solved by technical means, and ones which are 
more intractable and ill-formulated. At the end of Rittel’s presentation, Churchman 
said “Hmm, those sound like ‘wicked problems’” (Skaburskis 2008, p.  277). 
Although the classic formulation of wicked problems came in a later paper by Rittel 
and Webber (1973), the term was first used in print by Churchman, who defined 
them (giving due credit to Rittel) as “that class of social system problems which are 
ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, where there are many clients 
and decision makers with conflicting values, and where the ramifications in the 
whole system are thoroughly confusing” (Churchman 1967, p. B-141).
While we have emphasised Churchman as a scholar, writing was not his only 
way of transmitting his ideas. Given his strong concern for social change, he worked 
with a number of government agencies and other organisations to improve their 
systems, including NASA, the Systems Development Corporation, the 
U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Office of Education and the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service. Perhaps the most notable of these was his work with NASA, for 
13  C. West Churchman

135
whom he directed a Social Science Programme at Berkeley from 1963 to 1971 to 
study its ways of working in the Apollo programme and to draw lessons for other 
organisations’ management. While these various consultancy appointments influ-
enced Churchman’s ideas considerably, he seldom presented them as complete case 
studies in his writing, instead concentrating on the ideas and illustrating them with 
examples from his consultancy work.
A further key way in which Churchman disseminated his ideas was through his 
teaching. Churchman taught for over 50 years, especially graduate students and 
working managers. Those who would go on to have a strong influence on systems 
thinking included his students Werner Ulrich, Ian Mitroff, Richard Mason, Russell 
Ackoff, as well as Peter Checkland who was influenced by Churchman early in his 
academic career, and who regarded Churchman as a mentor. His teaching radically 
changed the lives and careers of his students. His influence was broad and signifi-
cant, although as Mason notes: “Many students and followers tend to heap adoration 
on their mentors, especially when they are as charismatic and powerful as 
Churchman. West was uneasy with such adoration and generally reacted negatively 
to it. He wanted his students and audience to listen to his ideas and then go out and 
use them on their own.” (Mason and Mitroff 2015, p. 44).
West Churchman carried on working to secure improvements in the human con-
dition until the end of his life. When he reached the age of 70, instead of retiring he 
moved into an emeritus professorship at Berkeley in peace and conflict studies. He 
only finally left this post in 1996, aged 83, but even then carried on working on 
‘global ethical management’, and although seriously ill with Parkinson’s disease, he 
was writing until his death in California in 2004.
Mason has written that Churchman “both embodied and projected the field’s 
moral conscience” (Mason and Mitroff 2015, p. 37). His moral conscience shines 
through in all his work - in philosophy, operations research, management science, 
systems thinking, and peace and conflict studies. He had a true understanding of 
what it meant to understand the whole system in any situation, and to treat all 
aspects of it ethically and with respect.

On Design (Preliminary Statement)
The introductory remarks of this chapter themselves suggest some of the salient 
characteristics of design. First of all, design belongs to the category of behavior 
called teleological, i.e., ‘goal seeking’ behavior. More specifically, design is think-

ing behavior which conceptually selects among a set of alternatives in order to fig-
ure out which alternative leads to the desired goal or set of goals. In this regard, 
design is synonymous with planning, optimizing, and similar terms that connote the 
use of thought as a precursor to action directed at the attainment of goals.
Each alternative, ideally, describes a complete set of behavior patterns, so that 
someone equipped with the same thought processes as the designer will be able to 
convert the design into a specific set of actions. Consequently, as a first approxima-
tion, design has the following characteristics:
	1.	 It attempts to distinguish in thought between different sets of behavior patterns.
	2.	 It tries to estimate in thought how well each alternative set of behavior patterns 
will serve a specified set of goals.
	3.	 Its aim is to communicate its thoughts to other minds in such a manner that they 
can convert the thoughts into corresponding actions which in fact serve the goals 
in the same manner as the design said they would.
It will be noted that these specifications contain the phrases ‘attempts to’, ‘tries to’, 
and ‘aim’; the point is that the designer tries to do these three things, but may not 
succeed. If the phrases had been omitted, then we should have been caught in the 
awkward position of saying that design behavior occurs only when it is completely 
successful, i.e., never. Indeed, it is important at the outset to recognize that there are 
degrees of design, depending on a person’s interest in the three efforts, as well as the 
amount of success he attains in them.
There is a fourth characteristic of design behavior that is important for the sub-
sequent discussion. This is the goal of generality, or, as many would put it, method-
ology; the designer strives to avoid the necessity of repeating the thought process 
when faced with a similar goal-attainment problem by delineating the steps in the 
process of producing a design.
In a sense, this design goal consists in communicating with another designing 
mind faced with similar problems. Once the designer has had some success in this 
fourth effort, he can say that he can tell why a design is good, in addition to telling 
the what, when, and how, which the first three efforts attempt to accomplish. The 
broader the class of problems that a design methodology can be used to solve, the 
deeper the ‘explanation’ of the design.
It is evident that some ‘other mind’ is critical for the designer, whether it be his 
own mind later on or some different person. This other mind transforms thoughts 
into action (3) or into other designs (4). In understanding the design process it would 
be very convenient to have a standard ‘other mind’, which the student of design 
could use to test the effectiveness of various design processes. A recently developed 
mind, the digital computer, is a likely candidate. We can defer for later argument the 
question whether a computer ‘has’ a mind. For the present, it appears to be a good 
candidate for a standard because (a) its processes belong under the category of 
thinking, and (b) in principle one can test whether a set of ideas have been ade-
quately transmitted to it.
So our question is whether it is possible to tell a computer how to design an 
inquiring system, or, in other terms, teach a computer to conduct research. The pur-
13  C. West Churchman

pose is not to design an ‘automated’ researcher, but rather to discover what in the 
research process is truly the ‘lonely’ part, the part that cannot be designed, at least 
relative to a standard computer. […]
On the Design of Systems
We are specifically interested in the design of systems, i.e., of structures that have 
organized components. As we move into the discussion in greater depth, we shall 
have to say a great deal about the concept of a system, but one central problem of all 
systems design can easily be illustrated. For example, the designer of a home for a 
family is designing a system. Narrowly, he may think of a particular instance of a 
design as the specification of a physical house, designated by a complete set of 
architectural drawings and specifications. In this case, the components may be the 
rooms, and the relations between the components may be the geometrical scheme of 
the house in three-dimensional space. But the architect may ask himself a broader 
question: whether the house is not a component of a larger system, consisting of the 
family (or its activities) and the house. When he does ask himself this question, he 
may wonder whether his design task should include the design of a part of the fam-
ily’s activities. For example, he may wonder whether he can change the family’s 
typical way of using the kitchen facilities. Still more broadly, he may ask whether 
the house plus family is not a component of an urban social system, and whether he 
ought not to consider alternative designs of this entire community. If he perceives 
his task in the narrowest sense, then he tells himself that the larger system is not his 
concern; how the family behaves is entirely up to them, or how the community is 
planned is entirely up to the planners and politicians. In such a case, he believes that 
the maximum size of the system is the house (plus, say, its location on the land). He 
may believe that there is a larger system that may concern some other designer; such 
a larger system may be the city in which the house is to be placed. But as far as he 
is concerned, larger systems are not relevant to the effectiveness of his choices.
Thus, one system design problem of central importance is to decide how large 
the system is, i.e., its boundaries and environment. A closely related problem is one 
of determining the basic components, i.e., the components that do not contain sub-
components. For example, the architect may decide that there are ultimate choices 
he can make from a catalogue: he cannot or should not consider alternative ways of 
putting together the parts of a window, since this is entirely up to the window manu-
facturers. In this case, he regards the system to have a smallest component.
All men are system designers, and each man tries to determine what, in his world, 
is the largest system and the smallest. For each human, the system he designs is his 
life, i.e., his self. The question all of us face is what is the largest and smallest sys-
tem which constitutes the self? Where does self designing begin and end?
The trouble with such a question is that it is so confusing. The intent is clear 
enough in each specific case, however. A man must decide whether to pay attention 
to his own survival and welfare only, or his family’s, or his city’s, or his nation’s, or 
Reading from Churchman’s work

138
the world’s, or of ‘space’. He must decide whether to ‘take’ what is offered in terms 
of goods and money, or to create his own. In either direction he looks for the broad-
est and the deepest limits of his world of system design. But to translate these famil-
iar problems of human living into a form that can receive sensible general answers 
is the difficult task.
As we proceed in the discussion of the design of inquiring systems, we shall find 
that we must face the question of the largest and smallest system: what is the largest 
set of components the designer of inquiring systems must consider, and what are the 
fundamental components that cannot be further analyzed into systems? To illustrate, 
is it enough to consider just the acts of formulating hypotheses and testing hypoth-
eses? If this is essentially all that an inquirer can be expected to do, then such mat-
ters as generalizations from theories or the communication of results are taken to be 
outside the purview of the inquirer, and hence matters of concern to other systems. 
Likewise, if the human being is regarded as essential for inquiry but the process by 
which he creates new ideas is taken to be forever beyond the scope of analysis, then 
the human creator is regarded as a fundamental component, one lower bound of the 
hierarchy of components.
To the four characteristics of design given above, we must therefore add a fifth 
which is specific to the design of systems: the systems designer attempts to identify 
the whole relevant system and its components; the design alternatives are defined in 
terms of the design of the components and their interrelationships.

Russell Ackoff
Russell Ackoff (usually known as ‘Russ’) was a pioneer of the application of sys-
tems approaches to management, both through theoretical developments and 
through a deep and practical engagement with many different organisations. He was 
a strong advocate of the need for systems approaches to take full account of the 
complexity of inter-related problems and not simply to present glib technical 
solutions.
Ackoff was notable as a theorist, having been responsible for many key innova-
tions in operations research (a field to which he helped to give academic respectabil-
ity) and systems thinking. He was equally strong in working as a consultant, 
although he disliked the term (and even more the label of a ‘guru’), preferring to call 
himself an educator: “A consultant goes in with a solution. He tries to impose it on 
a situation. An educator tries to train the people responsible for the work to work it 
out for themselves. We don’t pretend to know the way to get the answer” (Stern 
2007). He also made significant innovations in formal university teaching, introduc-
ing radical new curricula in both operations research and systems thinking. He was 
a strong and able communicator, in speech and writing – his articles used many 
vivid devices, such as anecdotes, aphorisms (e.g. “a bureaucrat is one who has the 
power to say ‘no’ but none to say ‘yes’” – Ackoff et al. 2010, p. 36) and pithy, well-­
argued opinions. These were collected into a series of short books, under titles such 
as Ackoff’s Fables and Systems Thinking for Curious Managers.
Russell Ackoff was born in 1919 in Philadelphia and died in 2009 near the same 
city. His grandparents were Russian immigrants but had their children in the United 
States. He studied at the University of Pennsylvania – an interest in design pro-
cesses and an uncle who was an architect led him to take his BA in architecture, but 
during his final undergraduate year he fell under the spell of West Churchman and 
took his Ph.D. in philosophy with Churchman (and Churchman’s mentor, the 
­pragmatist philosopher E.A.  Singer), graduating in 1947. As was allowed by 
Pennsylvania’s rules, Ackoff’s Ph.D. dissertation was jointly authored by Ackoff 
and Churchman, and when asked which parts had been written by Ackoff they sim-

142
ply selected chapters at random. This led to Ackoff passing his Ph.D. but failing to 
have his teaching fellowship renewed.
As Ackoff was unable to get a position at Pennsylvania, he moved to Wayne State 
University in Detroit, where he spent 4 years, moving in 1951 to the Case Institute 
of Technology. At Case he co-founded, with Churchman, its Operations Research 
(OR) Group, the first in the world, and was a co-author of the first textbook in OR 
(Churchman et al. 1957). Ackoff directed the OR group after Churchman moved to 
Berkeley in 1958. He was also president of the OR Society of America in 1956.
In 1964, he returned to Pennsylvania as a professor at its business school (the 
Wharton School), along with many of the Case OR group; he stayed there until his 
retirement in 1986. In the mid-1970s, he devised and ran the Social Systems 
Sciences postgraduate programme at Wharton. On retiring from Wharton, he subse-
quently headed a consultancy firm, Interact: the Institute of Interactive Management. 
In 2000 the University of Pennsylvania established the Ackoff Center for 
Advancement of Systems Approaches in his honour. He has published more than 20 
books, both scholarly and popular, and numerous articles. He was friends with some 
of the most important American management thinkers of the twentieth century, 
including Peter Drucker and W. Edwards Deming.
Ackoff was a forceful and passionate thinker and practitioner. In describing their 
close collaboration, Churchman (1990, p. 130) wrote “if the story of my early years 
with Russ sounds like they were years of battle, then the sound is correct”. On the 
other hand, as his close colleague at Wharton and Interact, Jamshid Gharajedaghi 
(foreword to Ackoff et al. 2010, p. v) wrote after his death, “His uniqueness and 
multidimensionality defies conventional wisdom. He was forceful and yet kind; car-
ing but not compromising; fearsome but dependable. For me, he was the epitome of 
wholeness, bringing complementary opposites into a harmonious whole. … He 
seemed merciless in making you confront your weaknesses, expecting and accept-
ing nothing but the very best.”
He worked with a large number of organisations as a consultant-educator. Two of 
the most significant took very different forms. First, he worked for more than 
30 years as a consultant to the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, which had a 
strong influence on his thinking and the issues he considered. He conducted research 
for them in areas as diverse as logistics, marketing, corporate planning, environ-
mental issues, alcoholism and corporate organisation. In this time, the company’s 
market share of US beer sales grew from 7% to 41%, and “although it is impossible 
to trace precise causal relationships, it is a straightforward and relatively simple task 
to show that Ackoff’s contribution to this growth was real and considerable” (Busch 
1990, p. 146). His experiences with Anheuser-Busch fed directly into several of 
Ackoff’s books; they also supported his research projects financially for many years.
He had a very different, but equally important, experience in a project in a 
deprived black area of Philadelphia, Mantua which began in 1968. Based on com-
munity leaders’ slogan of “plan or be planned for”, the project involved the local 
community in planning for the future development of the neighbourhood, using the 
resources and skills of the university but clearly driven by the community. This was 
a highly participative view of research: “we, the researchers, designed a relation 
14  Russell Ackoff

143
with the ‘subjects’ in which the subjects conducted research on us. It was the com-
munity members’ task to find out how to use the University and our Center effec-
tively, and, by so doing, to solve the researchers’ problem of determining how to be 
useful” (Ackoff 1970, p. 768). Ackoff drew lessons from this project which influ-
enced his later work considerably, in particular the importance of OR taking social 
responsibility seriously and going beyond a technical perspective, and the need for 
widespread participation in planning processes. In an article discussing the project 
he contrasted this experience with planning in large organisations: “the effective 
ghetto leader has a knowledge of and concern with his environment that few govern-
mental or industrial leaders have … however limited his effect on the larger environ-
ment may be, the ghetto leader uses all his power to push it in a direction that is 
compatible with his aspirations for his neighbourhood. He believes in active inter-
vention in the larger community and its future because he knows that his neighbour-
hood cannot thrive unless the larger community thrives” (Ackoff 1970, p. 771). The 
Mantua project was also to form the inspiration for later British work in ‘commu-
nity OR’ (Jackson 1990). Ackoff continued to be involved with Mantua and was still 
attending community meetings there just weeks before his death (Morrison 2009).
Ackoff had a long and interesting relationship with the field of operations 
research. As already mentioned, Ackoff was involved very closely in the establish-
ment of OR as an academic discipline, in his work with Churchman at Case. His 
influence on the development of academic OR in Britain was also considerable, 
with several visits including acting as a “marriage broker” (Jackson 1990, p. 178) 
between the Tavistock Institute and the Operational Research Society, in the forma-
tion of the Institute of Operational Research at the Tavistock. He also became 
closely connected with both Eric Trist and Fred Emery of the Tavistock Institute – 
Trist later joined Ackoff at Wharton.
However, Ackoff became increasingly disillusioned with OR as a discipline. He 
had always been “concerned to widen the scope of the discipline far beyond the 
tactical problems of industry and commerce” (Kirby 2003, pp. 1131–1132), had 
made frequent critiques of the narrow technical nature of OR and written about its 
need for social responsibility (based on experiences such as the Mantua project). 
His dissatisfaction culminated in a famous pair of papers in which he argued that 
“Operational Research was once an outrageous idea. It no longer is. Today it is an 
idea dressed in a sombre dark suit, a bowler on its head, a black umbrella on its arm 
and an attaché case in its hand” (Ackoff 1979, pp.  198–199). The influence of 
Ackoff’s views was considerable in the UK, forming a key part of the drive towards 
a broader, more strategic form of OR known as ‘soft OR’; but in the US he was 
treated very differently and “his direct influence is now hard to find in the academic 
OR community … it is as if he has been written out of the official OR canon” (Kirby 
and Rosenhead 2005, pp. 133).
His frustration with OR led Ackoff, as it did Churchman, in the direction of sys-
tems thinking (particularly general systems theory). He argued that we have left the 
machine age, with its concept of the universe as a mechanism and its consequent 
focus on analytical thinking and reductionism; and instead are entering the systems 
age, with a focus on synthetic (systemic) thinking and expansionism, the idea “that 
14  Russell Ackoff

144
all objects, events, and experiences of them are parts of larger wholes” (Ackoff 
1974, p. 12). A crucial part of Ackoff’s approach to systems thinking was his intro-
duction of the concept of a mess: a system of problems recognising the fact that “no 
problem ever exists in complete isolation; every problem interacts with other prob-
lems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems” (Ackoff 1974, p. 21). In 
particular, it is insufficient and indeed counter-productive to break a mess down into 
its constituent elements, which can even lead to the mess becoming worse. A key 
example for Ackoff was the different aspects of urban life, such as health, crime, 
education, transport and racial tensions, which can only be made better if treated 
collectively (today’s list would be longer and perhaps include environmental issues 
and religious tensions, but the need for systemic thinking is the same). The concept 
of a mess is very close to Rittel and Weber’s idea of a ‘wicked problem’, discussed 
in the chapter on West Churchman, and it is striking that the two ideas were pub-
lished at almost the same time.
Instead of looking for simple-minded solutions, Ackoff argued that we need an 
effective process of what he called ‘mess management’. He suggested that the way 
to handle messes (in both community and organisational settings) is through plan-
ning, and specifically a participatory and systemic method he calls interactive plan-
ning (by contrast with three weaker, less systemic means of planning – inactive, 
reactive and proactive). This method, and the related concept of interactive manage-
ment, formed the basis of Ackoff’s work in systems thinking from the 1970s 
onwards. It derived partly from his experiences in the Mantua project and their 
slogan “plan or be planned for”, which forms the subtitle of the key book on the 
process (Ackoff 1981).
Interactive planning works on the principle of ‘idealized redesign’ of a system: 
“a design of the system with which the designers would replace the existing system 
now if they were free to do so” (Ackoff 1979, p. 191). Importantly, this redesign 
must consider the whole system, in all its parts, simultaneously; and it must involve 
the participation of all key stakeholders. Participation, crucial to the commitment of 
stakeholders to the change that is devised, is enabled by the democratic nature of 
this redesign process – it does not require experts. Ackoff (1981) identifies five 
stages of interactive planning: formulating the mess (understanding the problems 
and opportunities involved), ends planning (designing the desirable future), means 
planning (finding ways to reach the desirable future), resource planning (deciding 
what human, financial and other resources are required and how to obtain them), 
and design of implementation and control (the details of how to put the changes into 
place and check that they have actually happened).
He made many other contributions to ideas that had influence well beyond sys-
tems thinking. A notable example was his introduction of the idea that a hierarchy 
of progressive complexity can be seen in the terms data, information, knowledge 
and wisdom, often referred to as the ‘DIKW hierarchy’ (Rowley 2007) and widely 
used in knowledge management, but introduced in Ackoff’s presidential address to 
the International Society for Systems Sciences in 1988 (Ackoff 1989). A further 
example was his early work on the concept of stakeholders in management, a key 
part of his work from Ackoff (1974) onwards and a strong influence on Edward 
14  Russell Ackoff

145
Freeman, who worked at Wharton while developing the ideas that led to his highly 
influential book Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach (Freeman 1984) 
which clearly built on Ackoff’s work.
As well as the development of interactive planning/management, Ackoff made 
important contributions to teaching systems thinking. The Social Systems Science 
(S3) programme at Wharton, which he established in the mid-1970s along with oth-
ers disillusioned with OR, was designed on the principle that an effective degree 
programme should not be “made up of an aggregation of independently given and 
taken courses that leave the difficult task of their synthesis to be performed by the 
student alone; the principal instruments of education are Learning and Research 
Cells which are collective efforts at synthesis, not analysis” (Ackoff 1979, p. 197). 
S3 was highly successful, with large numbers, and highly effective in teaching sys-
tems ideas, although its methods were too unorthodox to make it popular with 
Ackoff’s colleagues at the Wharton School.
Ackoff was widely respected for the range of his innovations, the extent to which 
he has brought democratic principles to organisational and national planning via 
systems thinking, and his insistence on going beyond narrow technical solutions. He 
was a man of passion and vision. Ultimately, as a long-term colleague at Anheuser-­
Busch put it (Pritzker 1990, p. 152):
Russ has not been the model of the cool, aloof, dispassionate, and ‘objective’ scientist. 
Rather he has been intensely involved in the ‘messes’ and problems with which he has been 
asked to deal. He has been the model of the committed, partisan investigator.

For me there has never been an amount of money that makes it worth doing 
something that is not fun. So I’m going to recall the principal sources of the fun that 
I have experienced.
First, the fun derived from denying the obvious and exploring the consequences 
of doing so. In most cases, I have found the obvious to be wrong. The obvious, I 
discovered, is not what needs no proof, but what people do not want to prove. […]
Here is a very small sample of the obvious things I have had great fun denying.
•	 That improving the performance of the parts of a system taken separately will 
necessarily improve the performance of the whole. False. In fact, it can destroy 
an organization, as is apparent in an example I have used ad nauseam: installing 
a Rolls Royce engine in a Hyundai can make it inoperable. This explains why 
benchmarking has almost always failed. Denial of this principle of performance 
improvement led to a series of organizational designs intended to facilitate the 
Reading from Ackoff’s work

146
management of interactions: the circular organization, the internal market econ-
omy, and the multidimensional organization.
•	 That problems are disciplinary in nature. Effective research is not disciplinary, 
interdisciplinary, or multidisciplinary; it is transdisciplinary. Systems thinking is 
holistic; it attempts to derive understanding of parts from the behaviour and 
properties of wholes rather than derive the behaviour and properties of wholes 
from those of their parts. Disciplines are taken by science to represent different 
parts of the reality we experience. In effect, science assumes reality is structured 
and organized the way universities are. This is a double error. First, disciplines 
do not constitute different parts of reality; they are different aspects of reality, 
different points of view. Any part of reality can be viewed from any of these 
aspects. The whole can be understood only by viewing it from all the perspec-
tives simultaneously. Second, the separation of our different points of view 
encourages looking for solutions to problems with the same point of view from 
which the problem was recognized. Paraphrasing Einstein, we cannot deal with 
problems as effectively as possible by employing the same point of view as was 
used in recognizing them. When we know how a system works, how its parts are 
connected and interact to produce the behaviour and properties of the whole, we 
can almost always find one or more points of view from which better solutions to 
the problem can be found than can be found from the point of view from which 
the problem was recognized. For example, we do not try to cure a headache by 
brain surgery, but by putting a pill in the stomach. We do this because we under-
stand how the body, a biological system, works. When science divides reality up 
into disciplinary parts and deals with them separately, it reveals a lack of under-
standing of reality as a whole, as a system. […]
•	 That the best thing that can be done to a problem is to solve it. False. The best 
thing that can be done to a problem is to dissolve it, to redesign the entity that has 
it or its environment so as to eliminate the problem. Such a design incorporates 
common sense and research and increases our learning more than trial-anderror 
or scientific research alone can.
My second source of fun has been the revelation that most large social systems 
are pursuing objectives other than the ones they proclaim and that the ones they 
pursue are wrong. They try to do the wrong thing righter and this makes what they 
do wronger. It is much better to do the right thing wrong than the wrong thing right, 
because when errors are corrected it makes doing the wrong thing wronger, but the 
right thing righter. A few examples: […]
•	 The educational system is not dedicated to produce learning by students, but 
teaching by teachers, and teaching is a major obstruction to learning. Witness 
the difference between the ease with which we learned our first language without 
having it taught to us, and the difficulty with which we did not learn a second 
language in school. Most of what we use as adults we learned once out of school, 
not in it, and what we learned in school we forget rapidly – fortunately. Most of

it is either wrong or obsolete within a short time. Although we learn little of use 
by having it taught to us, we can learn a great deal by teaching others. It is always 
the teacher who learns most in a classroom. Schools are upside down. Students 
should be teaching, and teachers at all levels should learn no matter how much 
they resist doing so.
A student once asked me in what year I had last taught a class on a subject that 
existed when I was a student. A great question. After some thought, I told him 
1951. “Boy”, he said, “You must be a good learner. What a pity you can’t teach 
as well as you can learn.” He had it right.
•	 The principal function of most corporations is not to maximize shareholder 
value, but to maximize the standard of living and quality of work life of those who 
manage the corporation. Providing the shareholders with a return on their invest-
ments is a requirement, not an objective. As Peter Drucker observed, profit is to 
a corporation as oxygen is to a human being: necessary for existence, not the 
reason for it. A corporation that fails to provide an adequate return for their 
investment to its employees and customers is just as likely to fail as one that does 
not reward its shareholders adequately.
The most valuable and least replaceable resource is time. Without the time of 
employees, money can produce nothing. Employees have a much larger invest-
ment in most corporations than their shareholders. Corporations should be maxi-
mizing stakeholder, not shareholder, value.
My third source of fun derives from producing conceptual order where ambigu-
ity and confusion prevail. Some examples:
•	 Identifying and defining the hierarchy of mental content which, in order of 
increasing value, are data, information, knowledge, understanding, and wisdom. 
However, the educational system and most managers allocate time to their acqui-
sition that is inversely proportional to their importance. Few individuals, and 
fewer organizations, know how to facilitate and accelerate learning – the acquisi-
tion of knowledge – let alone understanding and wisdom. It takes a support sys-
tem do to so.
All learning ultimately derives from mistakes. When we do something right we 
already know how to do it; the most we get out of it is confirmation. Mistakes are 
of two types: commission (doing what should not have been done) and omission 
(not doing what should have been done). Errors of omission are generally much 
more serious than errors of commission, but errors of commission are the only 
ones picked up by most accounting systems. Then since mistakes are a no–no in 
most corporations, and the only mistakes identified and measured are ones 
involving doing something that should not have been done, the best strategy for 
managers is to do as little as possible. No wonder it prevails in American 
organizations.
•	 Identifying and defining the three basic types of traditional management: the 
reactive or reactionary, the inactive or conservative, and the preactive or liberal. 
Reading from Ackoff’s work

Then showing that a fourth type, the interactive or radical, denies the assump-
tions common to the three traditional types and, therefore, constitutes a radical 
transformation of the concept of management. The interactive manager plans 
backward from where he wants to be ideally, right now, not forward to where he 
wants to be in the future, or past.
The interactive manager plans backward because it reduces the number of alter-
native paths he must consider, and his destination is where he would like to be 
now ideally, because if he did not know this, how could he possibly know where 
he will want to be at some other time?
•	 Identifying and defining the ways we can control the future: vertical integration, 
horizontal integration, cooperation, incentives, and responsiveness. These are 
seldom used well. Corporations tend to collect activities that they do not have the 
competence or even the inclination to run well. They also tend more to adver-
sarial relationships with employees, to encourage competition between parts of 
the corporation and conflict with competitors. As Peter Drucker pointed out, 
there is more competition within corporations than between them, and it tends to 
be less ethical. In many cases managers unintentionally create incentives that 
result in activities diametrically opposed to their best interests – for example, 
rewarding themselves for short-term performance, ignoring the long term, or 
paying commission based on the amount of a sale rather than its profitability. 
This encourages the sale of underpriced, hence usually unprofitable, items.
Few organizations are ready, willing, and able to change in response to unantici-
pated internal or external changes; they lack the responsiveness of a good driver 
of an automobile, who gets to where he wants to go without forecasts of what he 
will encounter but the ability to cope with whatever occurs.
My fourth source of fun has been the disclosure of intellectual con men – for 
example, propagators of TQM, benchmarking, downsizing, process reengineering, 
and scenario planning. Management is incurably susceptible to panacea peddlers. 
They are rooted in the belief that there are simple, if not simple-minded, solutions 
to even the most complex of problems. And they do not learn from bad experiences. 
Managers fail to diagnose the failures of the fads they adopt; they do not understand 
them. Most panaceas fail because they are applied antisystemically. They need not 
be, but to do otherwise requires an understanding of systems and the ability to think 
systemically. The perceived need to learn something new is inversely proportional 
to the rank of a manager. Those at the top feel obliged to pretend to omniscience 
and, therefore, refuse to learn anything new even if the cost of doing so is success.
Finally, my fifth source of fun has derived from designing organizations that can 
avoid the kinds of traps I have described here, for example, the designs of a demo-
cratic hierarchy, an internal market economy, a multidimensional organizational 
structure, and learning and adaptation support systems. But I have derived the most 
fun working with others on the design of INTERACT, the Social Systems Sciences 
Graduate Program at The Wharton School, and the Operations Research Graduate 
Programs at Case and Penn.
I am indebted to all who have made my ‘work’ a continuous source of fun.

Chapter 15
Peter Checkland
Peter Bernard Checkland has had a huge influence on systems thinking, especially 
in the fields of management and information systems, although his ideas have been 
taken up in a wide range of fields. He is most notable for the development of Soft 
Systems Methodology (SSM), deriving from an action research programme lasting 
more than 30 years. As well as methodological innovations, Checkland introduced 
a number of key conceptual developments, in particular his distinction between 
‘hard’ and ‘soft’ systems thinking, and his championing of the soft approach. As 
Mingers (2000, p. 747) notes, “SSM has reoriented an entire discipline and touched 
the lives of literally thousands of people … [soft] thinking is now completely taken 
for granted within the systems discipline”.
Checkland was born in 1930 in Birmingham, where he also grew up and went to 
school. Following national service, he went to Oxford University to study chemis-
try, graduating with a first-class degree in 1954. He decided not to take a Ph.D., on 
the grounds that only four or five people around the world were actually likely to 
read his results. He remarks that “suddenly it seemed absurd to be devoting intense 
intellectual activity to something which only a tiny handful of people would care 
about” (Checkland 2000b, p. S61).
He resolved instead to dedicate himself to applied science, an approach he would 
follow throughout his career. He went straight from Oxford to ICI Fibres where he 
worked from 1954 to 1968 on the applications of nylon and polyester, progressing 
through various levels of management. As a scientist and a manager, he became 
aware of the field of management science, but was deeply disappointed by its 
­irrelevance to his practice, later remarking that “in 14 years as a manager, I person-
ally was continually puzzled by the irrelevance of text-book management science to 
my real problems” (Checkland 1980, p. 320).
He had made considerable use of systems ideas in his work at ICI, and in 1969 
moved to Lancaster University to apply these ideas to management problems, work-
ing in the department of Systems Engineering, which later changed its name simply 
to ‘Systems’. He remained at Lancaster until his retirement in 1997 and is still an 

152
emeritus professor there, although he has been a visiting professor at various other 
universities. He has received various awards and honorary doctorates from several 
universities, and was president of the Society for General Systems Research in 1986.
Peter Checkland married his wife Glenys in 1955, and remained married until 
her death in 1990; they have two daughters. Of Glenys, Checkland (2000b, p. S59) 
wrote: “Loving her for the forty-three years I knew her is the best thing that’s hap-
pened to me in my life; losing her, the worst. Since I lost her, whenever I’ve faced 
any dilemma I’ve asked myself what her advice would have been, and I’ve always 
known the answer”.
Flood (2000, p. 723) has described him as a “man of passion and structure”, not-
ing that “Checkland is a person with a love of English literature, jazz, and rock 
climbing. Both jazz and rock climbing involve passion and structure. These two 
qualities are key ingredients that readers of his books soon encounter” (Flood 2000, 
p. 724).
On joining Lancaster University, Checkland began a programme of action 
research “to see if systems ideas could help us to tackle the messy problems of 
‘management’” (Checkland 2000a, p. S11). This work was to last 30 years until his 
retirement, and carries on to the present day through his and others’ work. The 
Department of Systems Engineering had been established at Lancaster in 1966 by 
Gwilym Jenkins, the first Systems department in a UK university. The department’s 
teaching consisted of a 1 year Masters programme that included a five month proj-
ect applying systems ideas in a real-world setting. The annual cycle of these proj-
ects, along with consultancy work and doctoral research, formed the testing ground 
for successive iterations to the methodology being developed at Lancaster, that 
would eventually become SSM.
The basis for the work, systems engineering, developed in industry through the 
need to build large and complex physical systems (such as chemical plants or tele-
phone networks). Systems engineering was well developed when Checkland started 
on the research, involving a process of defining the problem, its surrounding system 
and constraints; building a model of the system (usually computer-based); using 
that model to investigate possible changes to the system; and implementing a rede-
signed system incorporating changes identified through the model. This approach 
had been seen to work well in a range of industrial settings, and continues to be 
crucial in such applications to the present day.
However, when applied to management problems, Checkland rapidly found that 
systems engineering was inadequate. It took for granted too much about the nature 
of the system and its objectives, whereas defining those things often proves to be 
highly problematic in complex social settings such as management. A key case 
study that informed this change was consultancy work for the British Aircraft 
Corporation on the Concorde project, running late and over-budget. Ostensibly, the 
objectives of the project were clear: to build an aircraft that met the technical speci-
fication within time and cost requirements and would gain safety approval. However, 
it was clear that a larger set of objectives also existed, notably political ones – the 
project, as an Anglo-French joint venture, could readily be seen as a means of dem-
onstrating British sincerity at a time Britain was applying for membership of the 
15  Peter Checkland

153
European Community despite the veto of President de Gaulle of France. This led to 
a clear and important lesson: that “it was necessary to declare both a world-view 
which made a chosen model relevant, and a world-view which would then deter-
mine the model content … there would always be a number of models in play, never 
simply one model purporting to describe ‘what is the case’ ” (Checkland 2000a, 
p. S15).
These lessons – the importance of worldviews (for which Checkland adopted the 
German term Weltanschauungen from West Churchman), and the related issue of 
multiple views of reality – would form the basis of the thinking behind SSM. After 
10 years of work, Checkland (1981) drew together the ideas in a book, Systems 
Thinking, Systems Practice, probably still the mostly widely cited of his works. He 
distinguished between two forms of systems thinking – hard and soft. As described 
in the 1981 book (as we will see later, his understanding of the distinction developed 
over time), hard systems thinking referred to approaches such as systems engineer-
ing and operational research, which take as given the problem or need; in soft sys-
tems approaches, the true nature of the problem arises from the process of the 
systems study.
Soft Systems Methodology was described in Checkland (1981) as a seven-stage 
process, an expression of the methodology he was later to drop for his own use but 
which is still widely used in secondary texts, especially for teaching purposes. It is 
important to note here that Checkland has never seen SSM as a method – a single 
set of steps which can be followed in order – but rather as a methodology, “a set of 
ongoing principles which can be adapted for use in a way which suits the specific 
nature of each situation in which it is used” (Checkland and Poulter 2006, p. 6). The 
seven stages form one expression of the methodology, and Checkland would later 
create other expressions (such as the set of principles found in the reading from his 
work below). The original seven stages were: (1) enter a problem situation, under-
stood in an unstructured way; (2) express the problem situation in a more formal 
manner, especially its structure and process; (3) formulate a set of “root definitions” 
of relevant systems (a clear statement of the nature of the system); (4) build a set of 
“conceptual models” of activities which fulfil those root definitions and form an 
ideal state of the system; (5) compare the conceptual models with the earlier descrip-
tion of the problem situation; (6) given this comparison, decide on possible changes 
which are both systemically desirable and culturally feasible to help reach this ideal 
state; and (7) take action to improve the problem situation through the implementa-
tion of these changes.
As well as introducing a methodology with the seven-step version of SSM, 
Checkland (1981) also brought to wide attention a set of tools that the Lancaster 
group had developed which were used at the different stages of SSM. In particular, 
rich pictures and root definitions have proved useful in many settings beyond the 
explicit use of SSM. Rich pictures are perhaps the most widely used: they are a 
pictorial representation (usually hand-drawn) of the key elements in a problem situ-
ation, including issues of structure and process but without expressing these in 
terms of systems, and have been used widely in group settings and community 
development (Bell et al. 2016). Root definitions are a means of defining the nature 
15  Peter Checkland

154
of a particular system, to express it as ‘a system to …’ – as part of deciding upon a 
root definition, the CATWOE framework (customers, actors, transformation, world-
view, owner, environment) serves as a mnemonic to ensure the most important ele-
ments are included.
Through the 1980s and 1990s, Checkland developed SSM and its related ideas 
considerably. Crucially, he came to express the distinction between hard and soft 
systems thinking in terms of whether systems were considered to be a part of the 
world (hard) or a part of our way of understanding the world (soft), which he later 
described as a “shift of systemicity (or ‘systemness’) from the world to the process 
of inquiry into the world” (Checkland 2000a, p. S17). This shift is a key part of 
Checkland’s highly influential reorientation of the field of systems thinking in line 
with the philosophical school of interpretivism, which looks at the social world in 
terms of multiple perspectives, rather than the previously-dominant approach of 
functionalism (or positivism) which holds that a single view of the world is the 
‘real’ one. Checkland was influenced by a number of others’ work in this regard, 
notably Geoffrey Vickers and his concept of appreciative systems, about whom he 
wrote that “I have never had contact with a finer mind than that of Sir Geoffrey” 
(Checkland 2019, p. 1221). However, Checkland was one of the first people to put 
into practice an interpretivist approach to systems thinking.
Related to the shift to interpretivism was Checkland’s developing argument that 
soft systems represented a shift from a focus on optimisation and goal-seeking to a 
focus on learning. Checkland increasingly came to view SSM as a learning system, 
and argued that “SSM is doubly systemic – it is itself a cyclic learning process; and 
it uses systems models within that process” (Checkland 1985, p. 764). This concep-
tion of SSM led Checkland to understand it in a much more abstracted form than the 
seven-step version – he described the seven-step version as ‘mode 1 SSM’ and out-
lined as well an internalised, situation-driven version of SSM, ‘mode 2 SSM’, which 
in use by expert practitioners drew on the same principles but used very differ-
ent steps.
We have largely described Checkland’s individual journey through soft systems, 
but an important aspect of his work was that it arose through collaboration with 
many other people at Lancaster – students, colleagues and fellow consultants. One 
of Checkland’s key contributions was to lead and to draw together this community 
who in many ways collectively developed SSM. As part of this role, he was an 
accomplished teacher, especially of students on Lancaster’s 1 year Masters pro-
gramme (as well as Ph.D. students). A significant proportion of present-day influen-
tial UK academics in systems thinking, information systems and operational 
research studied the Lancaster Masters programme. One former student wrote that 
“Peter’s lectures were some of the best I have ever experienced, both because they 
addressed my fundamental concerns and issues about people in organizations and 
because Peter was incredibly incisive and articulate, always peppering his lectures 
with provocative and stimulating insights” (Mingers 2000, p. 735).
The development of SSM has paralleled a number of other approaches which 
took techniques from systems engineering and operational research, and broadened 
them beyond mathematical and technical methods. We have discussed the parallel 
15  Peter Checkland

155
work of Churchman, and also Vickers, in previous chapters, and Checkland (2011) 
acknowledges Churchman as a mentor. These are collectively referred to as ‘soft 
OR’ (soft operational research), within which the group of techniques known as 
problem structuring methods includes SSM, the Strategic Choice Approach and 
Strategic Options Development and Analysis (SODA), among others (Rosenhead 
2009). Checkland has observed that soft OR represents “a welcome reluctance or 
refusal to surrender to reductionism” (Checkland 2019, p. 1221) and has argued for 
the use of Vickers’ appreciative systems as an overarching methodology for opera-
tional research which would use its techniques “in a broader frame, taking account 
of the wider social and political contexts at work in any given problematic situation” 
(Checkland 2019, p. 1223).
SSM has been applied to all sorts of organisations and to all sorts of issues, but 
it has had a particular applicability in the field of information systems (IS). From the 
earliest days of the development of the methodology, many of the case studies 
involved the development of some sort of information system, and for a time the 
Masters degree at Lancaster had a specific IS focus. The generic nature of the meth-
odology meant that it needed little explicit tailoring to work in this context, but it 
was clear that important lessons were learned from this process. Accordingly, 
Checkland and Holwell (1998a) devoted a whole book to exploring the use of SSM 
in information systems, with the aim of bringing greater conceptual clarity to a field 
which implies systems thinking in its title but is often deeply confused about the 
meaning and implications of this connection.
Checkland has long conceived of the programme of developing SSM and its 
related ideas as being one of action research, the approach first introduced by Kurt 
Lewin, and as part of this programme he has developed a clear understanding of the 
nature of action research. In Checkland (1985) he introduced a concept of inquiry 
as being in three parts: an intellectual framework (F), a methodology for using that 
framework (M), and an area of application (A) in which the methodology is used. 
Checkland and Holwell (1998b, p. 14) argue that “it is essential to declare in advance 
the elements FMA … without that declaration, it is difficult to see how the outcome 
of [action research] can be more than anecdotal”. It is undoubtedly the case that 
much work labelled as action research is lacking in intellectual rigour, and 
Checkland’s work provides a basis for treating action research in a rigorous manner.
His ideas are not without their critics. Most notably, the ‘critical systems think-
ing’ school of thought, discussed in the chapter on Michael Jackson grew out of a 
sense that SSM was inherently reformist, and in its recognition of multiple perspec-
tives did not allow for enough of a consideration of power and conflict between 
those perspectives. The result in SSM is said to be one that too often favours the 
powerful.
An equally fundamental, but quite different, criticism has been made by John 
Mingers, who has argued against Checkland’s stance on shifting systemicity from 
the world to the process of enquiry (as discussed above). By doing this, Mingers 
argues that Checkland “reduces the force of systems thinking” and notes that for the 
early systems thinkers, concepts such as system, feedback and the nature of equilib-
rium “were genuine explanatory concepts in that the existence of such systemic 
15  Peter Checkland

156
processes in the world was necessary to explain the phenomena that were observed; 
to deny reality to systems concepts is to reduce them to an essentially arbitrary lan-
guage game” (Mingers 2000, p. 749).
Peter Checkland has had a considerable and lasting impact upon the systems 
movement, as a thinker, practitioner, methodology builder and teacher. He has sug-
gested that a highly skilled practitioner of SSM has the following characteristics: 
“sensitivity to people and situations: a readiness to see the world through the eyes 
of another; an ability to think with clarity; above all, an ability to inspect and think 
about your own thinking” (quoted in Winter 2000, p. 383). Checkland’s own ability 
to think with clarity, his passion and structure, have led to long-lasting change in the 
way we think about systems.

•	 We all live in the midst of a complex interacting flux of changing events and 
ideas which unrolls through time. We call it ‘everyday life’, both personal and 
professional. Within that flux we frequently see situations which cause us to 
think: ‘Something needs to be done about this, it needs to be improved.’ Think of 
these as ‘problematic situations’, avoiding the word ‘problem’ since this implies 
‘solution’, which eliminates the problem for ever. Real life is more complex than 
that!
•	 Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) is an organized way of tackling perceived 
problematical (social) situations. It is action-oriented. It organizes thinking about 
such situations so that action to bring about improvement can be taken.
•	 The complexity of problematical situations in real life stems from the fact that 
not only are they never static, they also contain multiple interacting perceptions 
of ‘reality’. This comes about because different people have different taken-as-­
given (and often unexamined) assumptions about the world. This causes them to 
see it in a particular way. One person’s ‘terrorism’ is another’s ‘freedom fight-
ing’; one person sees a prison in terms of punishment, another sees it as seeking 
rehabilitation. These people have different worldviews. Tackling problematical 
situations has to accept this, and has to pitch analysis at a level that allows world-
views to be surfaced and examined. For many people worldviews are relatively 
fixed; but they can change over time. Sometimes a dramatic event can change 
them very quickly.
•	 All problematical situations, as well as containing different worldviews, have a 
second important characteristic. They always contain people who are trying to 
15  Peter Checkland

157
act purposefully, with intention, not simply acting by instinct or randomly thrash-
ing about – though there is always plenty of that too in human affairs.
•	 The previous two points – the existence of conflicting worldviews and the ubiq-
uity of would-be purposeful action – lead the way to tackling problematical situ-
ations. They underpin the SSM approach, a process of inquiry which, through 
social learning, works its way to taking ‘action to improve’. Its shape is as 
follows:
	1.	 Find out about both the problematical situation and the characteristics of the 
intervention to improve it: the issues, the prevailing culture and the disposition 
of power within the overall situation (its politics). Ways of doing these things are 
provided.
	2.	 From the finding out, decide upon some relevant purposeful activities, relevant 
that is to exploring the situation deeply, and remembering that the ultimate aim 
is to define and take ‘action to improve’. Express these relevant purposeful activ-
ities as activity models, each made to encapsulate a declared worldview, the 
model being a cluster of linked activities which together make up a purposeful 
whole. (For example, one model could express in terms of activities the notion 
‘prison’ as if it were only ‘a punishment system’, another could express it as ‘a 
rehabilitation system’.) Such models never describe the real world, simply 
because they are based on one pure worldview. They are devices, or tools, to 
explore it in an organized way. Techniques for building and using such models 
have been developed.
	3.	 Use the models as a source of questions to ask of the real-world situation. This 
provides a coherent structure to a discussion or debate about both the situation 
and how it might be changed, a discussion which will surface worldviews and 
generate ideas for change and improvement.
	4.	 In the course of the discussion, continually bring together the results of the ‘find-
ing out’ in (1) and the ideas for change in (3). The purpose now is to find changes 
which are both arguably desirable (given those models) but also culturally fea-
sible for these people in this particular situation with its particular history, cul-
ture and politics. This is a process of seeking accommodations between different 
worldviews. That is to say, it is a process of finding versions of the to-be-changed 
situation which different people with conflicting worldviews could nevertheless 
live with. (Don’t expect the worldviews to go away, nor wish that they would. 
Clashing worldviews, always present in human affairs, stimulate energy and 
ideas for change.)
•	 The elements (1) to (4) above constitute a learning cycle. They have necessarily 
been described linearly here but in use there is much iteration within the cycle as 
learning occurs. It is never followed in the flat-footed way in which it has been 
laid out here for explanatory purposes. Also it is apparent that it is essentially a 
group process leading to group learning. It is best carried out by people in the 
problematical situation itself, not left to an outside ‘expert’, though knowledge-
able people can facilitate the process.
Reading from Checkland’s work

158
•	 Taking action to improve a problematical situation will of course itself change 
that situation, so that the learning cycle could in principle begin again. In any 
case the changing flux of everyday life will itself bring new events and new 
ideas, so that no human situation could ever be rendered static. In this sense 
SSM’s learning cycle can be seen as never-ending. It ultimately offers a way of 
continuously managing any ongoing human situation. It does this by helping 
understanding of complex situations, encouraging multiple perspectives to be 
taken into account, and bringing rigour to processes of analysis, debate and tak-
ing ‘action to improve’.
The seven points made above are presented pictorially in Fig. 15.1.

Chapter 16
Werner Ulrich
Werner Ulrich is a pioneer of a critical approach to systems thinking. Most impor-
tantly, he has developed a highly useful method for applying this approach, Critical 
Systems Heuristics (CSH). He has carried out his work in both academia and in 
government, and applied his ideas to issues as diverse as public planning, evalua-
tion, reflective practice, the concept of citizenship and civil society, and environ-
mental discourse. While acknowledging a “personal bias towards a more 
philosophically based, critical kind of systems thinking” (Ulrich 2005a, p. 8), his 
work is deeply practical. His goal may perhaps be summed up by the title of one of 
his articles: “systems thinking as if people mattered” (Ulrich 1998).
CSH, Ulrich’s major contribution to the systems field, is especially notable in 
two ways. First, it is a practical working-through of some of the major ideas of West 
Churchman, in a form that is usable by many different kinds of people (including 
those with little awareness of the field of systems thinking). Second, it was one of 
the first methods to take an explicitly emancipatory approach and thus to advance 
the growing field of critical systems thinking.
Ulrich was born in 1948 in Bern, Switzerland. He holds two doctorates – firstly 
from the University of Fribourg (Switzerland) in 1975, in Economics and Social 
Science; then from the University of California at Berkeley in 1980, in Philosophy 
of Social Systems Design. As well as a deep immersion in the ideas of West 
Churchman, his time at Berkeley led him to study the philosophy of Immanuel 
Kant, especially Kant’s “critique of pure reason”. It was these influences taken 
together (as well as an interest in the work of Jürgen Habermas), which resulted in 
his book Critical Heuristics of Social Planning (Ulrich 1983), the core work on CSH.
On returning to Switzerland, Ulrich “decided to submit his work on critical sys-
tems heuristics to the double test of professional practice and of academic teaching 
and research” (Ulrich 2018). He became professor of social planning and evaluation 
research at the University of Fribourg, and also founder and head of the office of 
evaluation research within the Department of Public Health and Social Welfare in 

162
the Canton of Bern. He has been a visiting professor at the universities of Hull, 
Lincoln and the Open University in the UK and the university of Canterbury at 
Christchurch, New Zealand. His dual role as academic and practitioner can be seen 
in the nature of his writing, which is generally led by theory but also accessible. His 
ideas have also been shaped by the fact that his professional practice has been in 
government rather than private sector management. This has led him to a consider-
able awareness of social and political issues – among other areas, he has conducted 
research into poverty and citizenship. Many of the results of his evaluation and 
social research have only been published in German – his English-language publi-
cations tend to focus on more academic concerns – although his work has been 
applied to evaluation by a number of other scholars (e.g. Gates 2018; Reynolds 2015).
Ulrich’s work has been heavily shaped by the 5 years he spent working with West 
Churchman in Berkeley, although it is a mistake to suggest (as do some commenta-
tors) that Ulrich’s ideas are derived directly from Churchman with little amend-
ment – there are important differences of detail in their ideas and CSH also draws 
on other thinkers. Ulrich was deeply attracted by Churchman’s ideas in the early 
1970s and hoped to work with Churchman as a postdoctoral researcher. Unfortunately 
this was not to be: “West did not exactly invite me to come, though. I wrote several 
times, expressing my urgent wish to work with him at [Berkeley]. Alas, he did not 
care to respond. I had to find a different way of ‘convincing’ him” (Ulrich 2004, 
p. 203). His way of convincing Churchman was to apply to join his Ph.D. pro-
gramme, which is how he ended up taking a second Ph.D. at Berkeley. He writes 
that “five fascinating years followed, of learning and struggling to understand the 
implications of the systems approach for a critically tenable approach to applied 
disciplines such as planning and management” (Ulrich 2018).
Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH), sometimes referred to just as “critical heuris-
tics” in Ulrich’s early work on the approach, took two of its key concepts from 
Churchman’s work: the importance of boundary judgments, and a set of categories 
defining boundary judgments which form “a necessary set of conditions that must 
be fulfilled for a system S to be capable of purposeful activity” (Ulrich 1983, p. 245).
It is useful to look briefly at what Ulrich meant by the name ‘critical systems 
heuristics’, as this gives important indications as to his intentions and the ways in 
which his ideas are distinct from those of other systems thinkers. Ulrich states in his 
book that he intends all three words of the phrase ‘critical systems heuristics’ to be 
understood in the way they were used by Immanuel Kant. Thus by being critical, he 
means “to become self-reflective in respect to the presuppositions flowing into one’s 
own judgments” (Ulrich 1983, p. 20), a more reflective and less explicitly political 
concept than the forms of critical theory underlying many other approaches to criti-
cal systems thinking (see the following chapter on Mike Jackson’s work). Ulrich’s 
understanding of systems “does not presuppose that we can know ‘the whole 
­system’, but only that we can undertake a critical effort to reflect on the inevitable 
lack of comprehensiveness in our understanding of and design for (social) systems” 
(Ulrich 1983, p. 21) which as Ulrich has later observed is a quite different view of 
comprehensiveness from Churchman’s concept of ‘sweeping-in’ every possible 
perspective into a systems analysis.

Lastly, by referring to heuristics, Ulrich means approaches which “serve to iden-
tify and explore relevant problem aspects, assumptions, questions, or solution strat-
egies, in distinction to deductive (algorithmic) procedures, which serve to solve 
problems that are logically and mathematically well defined” (Ulrich 2002, p. 72). 
This use of the term heuristics is common in professional and technical fields, and 
has close parallels to soft systems approaches where understanding the nature of the 
problem is a key part of reaching a (partial) solution. However, Ulrich also observes 
that for Kant, heuristic approaches produce “a judgment whose empirical or theo-
retical validity is problematic and therefore remains in need of critical reflection … 
heuristics cannot serve as a source of discovery unless it is at the same time consid-
ered as a source of deception” (Ulrich 1983, p. 23).
Moving on to CSH as an approach, we will first discuss the important concept of 
boundary judgments. The idea that a system is defined by its boundary and the rela-
tionship between the inside and the outside of the boundary (the system’s environ-
ment), is a core one throughout the history of systems thinking. How we decide 
what should be the system’s boundary is a key issue, and very largely defines the 
nature of the system. Churchman (1970), himself drawing on the work of Kant, 
refers to these as “whole systems judgments”, a concept that formed the basis for 
Ulrich’s idea of the boundary judgment. Ulrich has taken the idea of boundary judg-
ments further with his concept of boundary critique, a larger process of reflection 
and critique upon boundary choices and their implications, which he discusses at 
length in the reading from his work which follows.
The major methodological tool of CSH in its process of boundary critique is a 
“systemic categorisation of boundary issues” (Ulrich 2005b, p. 7), derived closely 
from a set of categories developed by Churchman to help define boundary judg-
ments. This systemic categorisation is developed in a set of twelve ‘categories’, a 
concept Ulrich borrowed from Kant which refers to “a fundamental issue in the 
theory of knowledge” (Ulrich 2000, p. 256). The categories are: client, purpose, 
measure of improvement, decision-maker, resources, decision environment, profes-
sional, expertise, guarantee, witness, emancipation, world view. These categories 
represent four kinds of boundaries: sources of motivation, power, knowledge, and 
legitimation.
The twelve categories lead quite naturally to twelve boundary questions which 
form the ‘tool’ aspect of CSH. By systematically asking each of the questions in 
turn, we can question and critique the major issues around the boundary of a system. 
The questions are straightforward to use, by both experienced practitioners and 
ordinary stakeholders alike. The questions may take two forms, asking what is actu-
ally the case in the situation, or asking what ought to be the case. For example, for 
the decision-maker category, the questions are: “Who is (ought to be) the 
­decision-­maker? That is, who is (should be) in a position to change the measure of 
improvement?” (Ulrich 2000, p. 258).
CSH is often presented as an emancipatory method, i.e. one aiming to give power 
to the relatively powerless in a decision-making situation. It achieves this in two 
ways. First, it presents a tool which allows those without power to challenge those 
in power to justify their boundary judgments (i.e. why they have framed the terms 
16  Werner Ulrich

164
of debate in the way they have), and to work through the full implications for all 
stakeholder groups of those judgments. Second, because the twelve questions are 
fairly simple to use (despite their deep philosophical grounding), they do not require 
special expertise or training but can be picked up by ordinary citizens. The approach 
has been used in a range of practical situations – for example in conservation plan-
ning (Larsen 2011), information systems (Venter and Goede 2017) and community 
resilience (Helfgott 2018).
In fact, Ulrich (2002, p. 73) himself is keen to stress that the approach “should 
not be misunderstood and used as an emancipatory systems approach only; for its 
principle of systematic boundary critique is vital for sound professional practice in 
general, whatever importance may be attached to emancipatory issues”. Indeed, in 
further work he argues that “emancipatory reflection and discourse [are] require-
ments of all reflective practice” (Ulrich 2003, p. 339). This focus led him to found 
and co-edit (with D.P. Dash) the Journal of Reflective Practice which was published 
from 2005 until Ulrich’s retirement in 2018.
Ulrich’s view of the role of emancipation in his method is rather different to that 
of Mike Jackson and his colleagues at Hull. Jackson early on recognised the impor-
tance of CSH as almost the only systems method which explicitly built emancipa-
tion into its goals. However, in Jackson’s work, CSH is said only to be applicable to 
certain kinds of situations, those where issues of coercion (of those with less power) 
are at the fore. Ulrich has long argued that in fact most situations, in both the work-
place and society at large, carry such inequalities of power that these form the norm 
rather than the exception. Also, as we have already discussed, Ulrich sees a critical 
approach, based on boundary critique, as a necessary part of effective systems 
thinking. In fact, as Ulrich (2003) argues, the heart of critical systems thinking 
(CST) should be thought of as a process of “critically systemic discourse” (based on 
CSH) rather than the Jackson’s approach of methodology choice, which has tended 
to be dominant in most discussions of CST. This divergence of views has led to 
heated debate between Ulrich, Jackson and others.
One important difference between these approaches is that while Jackson and 
most of his colleagues (being based in business schools) focus largely on critical 
thinking within organisations, Ulrich’s has tended to focus on issues at the level of 
society. One of the first papers on CSH that Ulrich published after his 1983 book 
lists concerns such as “health care planning, city and regional planning, energy and 
transportation planning, environmental design” (Ulrich 1987, p. 276), and as already 
mentioned Ulrich worked for many years in evaluation within government. More 
recently, Ulrich (2000) has argued for critical thinking, via CSH, to be seen as a core 
tool for building civil society, and he has noted that even in coercive working set-
tings, “as citizens, we are all part of diverse social systems and fulfil in these 
­different systems various roles of a professional, private and public kind, which 
together offer a great variety of discursive chances” (Ulrich 2003, p. 330). There are 
undoubtedly genuine areas of theoretical difference between Ulrich and Jackson, as 
the two major thinkers within critical systems thinking, but at least some of this can 
be put down to their areas of concern.

Werner Ulrich is an important figure in the development of critical systems ideas. 
He presents an interesting combination of highly philosophical thinking with a 
strong and long-standing commitment to empowering those in large-scale practical 
situations. His method, CSH, is still among the most widely used approaches to 
critical systems thinking.

Boundary Critique – The Methodological Core Principle of CSH
The basic idea of CSH is to support boundary critique – a systematic effort of han-
dling boundary judgments critically. Boundary critique may take two main forms: it 
can aim at handling boundary judgments self-critically (reflective practice), or it 
can use boundary judgments for critical purposes against those who may not handle 
them so self-critically (emancipatory practice).
The methodological core idea consists in surfacing the unavoidable selectivity of 
claims, in the dual sense of ‘partiality’ explained above. Boundary judgments are 
the perfect target for this purpose, for unlike what one might think at first, they 
reflect a claim’s entire selectivity regarding both its empirical or normative content. 
It is important to understand that boundary judgments are not just one (perhaps even 
minor) among many other sources of selectivity – for example, in the sense that 
once the reference system is determined, it is then the specific content of our think-
ing or discussion which determines how ‘partial’ they are. Rather, any partiality can 
and needs to be understood as amounting to boundary judgments; for any content 
we do or do not consider, and the way we consider it, implies corresponding bound-
ary judgments. This consequence is the reverse side of the coin of ‘clear and valid 
thinking’, as it were; we cannot meaningfully talk about any aspect of a situation or 
an issue without implying boundary judgments. What a certain aspect means 
depends on what consequences we anticipate it to have, whose concerns we assume 
to be affected, what criteria of success or improvement we associate with it, and so 
on; and all these assumptions and associations embody boundary judgments as to 
what is to be part of the picture and what is not. Whether these judgments are con-
scious and deliberate or unintended makes no difference.
Likewise, the argumentative quality of a reflection or discussion reflects itself in 
boundary judgments. Wanting argumentation, say because we argue incoherently or 
fail to anticipate side effects and risks of a proposed action correctly, always amounts 
Reading from Ulrich’s work

166
to modifications of the reference system that we treat as relevant. Thus, if for exam-
ple we consider some aspect as relevant and perhaps even agree with others that it 
is important, but then fail to take it properly into account, due to lacking knowledge, 
to an error of judgment or some communicative misunderstanding or distortion, we 
have in fact excluded that aspect from our reference system. The same observation 
applies to the influence of power and other non-argumentative means of buttressing 
a claim: if those in control of a situation deliberately suppress or ignore some aspect 
of a problem situation at issue, they actually talk about something else than what 
they pretend. Those who understand the trick can then challenge them by uncover-
ing the circumstance.
In conclusion, both reflective and emancipatory practice can methodologically 
be grounded in a systematic process of boundary critique. The question is, can we 
offer people the conceptual tools they need to identify, discuss or challenge bound-
ary judgment systematically?
The Process of Boundary Critique
A systematic process of boundary critique faces the following tasks:
	1.	 It needs to identify the sources of selectivity that condition a claim, by surfacing 
the underpinning boundary judgments.
	2.	 It needs to examine these boundary judgments regarding their practical and ethi-
cal implications; what difference do they make to the way we see the situation in 
question?
	3.	 It needs to find options for determining the reference system that conditions a 
claim, by giving alternative answers to some of the boundary questions; for only 
in the light of alternative reference systems can we fully appreciate the selectiv-
ity of the present one.
	4.	 It needs to seek some mutual understanding with all the stakeholders concerned 
regarding their different reference systems. If in the process a shared notion of 
the relevant reference system can be achieved, so much the better; but even if no 
agreement can be reached, understanding the way reference systems differ still 
represents an important gain in communicative rationality. Misunderstandings 
can be avoided in this way, and mutual tolerance can grow. (Note that identifying 
the stakeholders to be consulted represents itself a boundary judgment in need of 
critique, although the previous steps should provide a tentative basis).
	5.	 Finally, when some of the parties handle their own boundary judgments uncriti-
cally, either because they take them for granted or try to impose them on others, 
it may become necessary to challenge their claims through the emancipatory use 
of boundary critique.
CSH offers some guidance for each of these tasks. However, it would be a mis-
take to conceive of boundary critique as a kind of step-by-step technique for ‘bound-
ary setting’, that is, as a method to determine ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ boundary 
16  Werner Ulrich

167
judgments and to settle conflicts. No kind of theory of methodology whatsoever 
could claim to know the ‘right’ answers to boundary issues. All that boundary cri-
tique can achieve is to help the parties in appreciating their own boundary assump-
tions and those of others, so that they can then articulate their concerns in a cogent 
way. The decision on what boundary judgments should underpin practical action is 
then a question of legitimacy rather than of validity; once the selectivity of claims 
has become transparent, democratically institutionalised processes of decision-
making can work in a meaningful way.
As a matter of principle, from a critical point of view we can never justify our 
claims by referring to the methodologies we use or to the theories we rely on. Only 
institutionalised processes of legitimate decision-making can justify the way our 
claims may affect the different parties concerned. Hence, boundary critique should 
be understood – and practised – primarily as a reflective attitude, rather than as a 
technique. That has both advantages and disadvantages: The advantage is that prac-
tising boundary critique does not depend on learning yet another problem-solving 
methodology (few professionals, much less ordinary people, are prepared to learn to 
master a large array of different problem-solving methodologies). It is quite good 
enough to understand the role that boundary judgments play and then to ‘translate’ 
this understanding into a Socratic attitude of self-reflection regarding one’s own 
claims, and of tolerance (combined with critical appreciation) regarding the claims 
of others. The disadvantage is that boundary critique is not a self-contained approach 
but is more useful in combination with other approaches to problem structuring and 
problem-solving.
Let us briefly characterise the kind of boundary-critical attitude that CSH 
proposes:
•	 Basically, from now on, when we refer to a ‘problem situation’ or to any kind of 
‘real-world’ circumstances, it should be clear that we always mean to refer to the 
perceived situation or circumstances as appreciated through a reference system 
of underpinning boundary judgments.
•	 Likewise, we understand that one of the most important qualities of a claim is its 
limitations, and hence, its self-limiting nature. Obviously, as soon as we recog-
nise the conditioned character of all our perceptions and claims, we can no lon-
ger articulate perceptions or raise claims in the same (unqualified) assertive 
mode that is so characteristic of everyday discussions as well as of the usual 
practice of ‘applied science’ and expertise. Rather, the question of how ‘scien-
tific’ the findings and conclusions of even the most professional application of 
scientific tools are, as well as how credible our everyday claims are, is now to be 
measured by the extent to which we make their conditioned character clear to 
ourselves and to everyone else concerned. Lest we be convicted of relying on 
undisclosed assumptions and hence, of claiming too much, an effort of clarifying 
and disclosing our boundary judgments is required. Furthermore, such a critical 
effort also makes sense lest we misunderstand the claims of others or let our-
selves be deceived by them.
Reading from Ulrich’s work

168
•	 A third and last important aspect of a boundary-critical attitude is this. Once we 
have understood that all our claims are conditioned by boundary judgments, the 
next step is to realise that this limitation holds just as much for the claims of well-­
trained experts and decision-makers as for those of ordinary people! The impli-
cation is that when it comes to boundary judgments, we basically meet as equals. 
Everyone can question the boundary judgments of others with equal right. This 
opens up a chance for everyone to acquire a new critical competence, one that is 
independent from any special knowledge or argumentative skills beyond those 
available to a majority of ordinary people. The mentioned Socratic attitude thus 
paves the way for an orientation towards emancipation and democratic 
self-determination.
Let us now look at the methodological core principle embodied in the concept of 
boundary critique. As we have understood, the basic requirement for developing the 
required critical competence is grasping the way judgments of fact as well as of 
value depend on boundary judgments and are connected through them. CSH 
explains this by means of the eternal triangle (Fig. 16.1). Whenever we propose a 
problem definition or solution or raise any other claim with a practical intent, we 
cannot help but assert the relevance of some facts and norms as distinguished from 
others. Which facts and norms we should consider depends on how we bound the 
reference system, and vice-versa; as soon as we modify our boundary judgments, 
relevant facts and norms are likely to change, too. We are thus caught in an argu-
mentative triangle.
CSH calls the process of thinking through the triangle systemic triangulation. It 
means to consider each corner of the triangle in the light of the other two. For 
example, what new facts become relevant if we expand the boundaries of the 
­reference system or modify our value judgments? How do our valuations look if we 
consider new facts that refer to a modified reference system? In what way may our 
reference system fail to do justice to the perspective of different stakeholder groups? 
Asking ourselves how the facts that we find relevant, the value considerations we

deem adequate, and the context (reference system) that we consider, mutually con-
dition one another is highly relevant for developing a sense of modesty regarding 
our claims, as well as tolerance regarding those of others who appear to have got 
their facts and values wrong!

Michael Jackson
Michael Jackson is a British management academic. He has made considerable 
advances in systems thinking and practice, especially in management and organisa-
tions, through his development of the Critical Systems Thinking (CST) approach. 
Jackson has been the main champion of CST since its inception, gave it its name, 
was one of the first to call for such an approach, and has been at the core of the main 
group developing the approach at the University of Hull. CST, in his most recent 
description, “sets out how the variety of systems methodologies, methods, and mod-
els that have been developed can be used in combination to promote more success-
ful interventions in complex organizational and social problem situations” (Jackson 
2019, p. 512).
Jackson is usually referred to as Mike Jackson (or Michael C. Jackson) to distin-
guish him from others of that name, not only the pop singer but particularly also the 
computer scientist Michael A.  Jackson who devised the Jackson Structured 
Programming and Jackson System Development methods. He was born in 1951, 
taking his first degree at Oxford University in Philosophy, Politics and Economics 
and graduating in 1973. He then spent 4 years working in the civil service as a tax 
inspector, spending his free time reading Marxist classics and the work of Habermas 
and Foucault. In 1978, he took the M.A. in Systems in Management at Lancaster 
University (the programme devised and run by Peter Checkland).
He started work as a lecturer in 1979 at the University of Hull, in its then 
Department of Operational Research (later Management Systems and Sciences), 
where he gained his Ph.D. He has remained at Hull since that time, becoming a full 
professor in 1989, except for 4 years (1994–1999) when he was a professor at the 
Lincoln campus of the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside (now the 
University of Lincoln). He served as dean of the Hull University Business School 
from 1999 until 2011, and retired in 2012. Since his retirement, Jackson has worked 
through a small consultancy, Systems Research Ltd., as well as being a director of 
an educational charity which provides learning experiences for deprived children, 
Hull and East Yorkshire Children’s University. He was diagnosed with neuroendo-

172
crine cancer, which is incurable, in 2011 and wrote in 2019 that “until recently, I did 
not think that I would survive long and writing a book seemed low on my list of 
priorities (give me Hull Kingston Rovers, Hull City, and Yorkshire cricket for enter-
tainment any day!)” (Jackson 2019, p. xxii). However his health has recovered suf-
ficiently to enable him to write a substantial book, Critical Systems Thinking and the 
Management of Complexity (Jackson 2019) which he wrote “is definitely my last 
book” (p. xxiii).
He has been highly active in the UK and international systems community – he 
has been president of the UK Systems Society, the International Society for the 
Systems Sciences and the International Federation for Systems Research, as well as 
for many years the editor of the journal Systems Research and Behavioral Science. 
Jackson was awarded an OBE in 2011 and a lecture series began in his name at Hull 
Universty in 2017 (the Annual Mike Jackson Lecture on Systems Thinking). He 
received the Operational Research Society’s prestigious Beale Medal in 2017, fol-
lowing it in 2019 with a lecture whose title ‘The future of Operational Research is 
present’ (OR Society, 2019) reflected the influential paper ‘The future of OR is past’ 
by Russell Ackoff (see chapter on Ackoff).
Mike Jackson has developed Critical Systems Thinking in a series of influential 
publications over a period of 30  years, starting with his M.A. dissertation at 
Lancaster in 1978, which “was an analysis of applied systems thinking from the 
point of view of social science and argued for a critical systems approach” (Jackson 
2001, p. 235). Several of his articles and books have been very widely read and 
cited. Following Jackson (2001), we can see the development of CST, mostly 
through the 1980s, as occurring in four stages: a critique of existing systems 
approaches; a call for the development of systems methodologies that took an 
explicitly emancipatory approach; work on a tool to classify the areas within which 
particular systems methodologies are appropriate; and the development of a meta-­
methodology for CST.
He first came to prominence through a strongly-worded article (Jackson 1982) 
criticising soft systems thinking and its three major advocates (Checkland, Ackoff 
and Churchman) in the same journal, published from Lancaster, where Checkland 
and others first outlined most of the major features of soft systems. His analysis 
drew upon a widely-read book by Burrell and Morgan (1979), who like Checkland 
were based at the business school at Lancaster University. Burrell and Morgan argue 
that all social theories used in organisational analysis can be divided into four para-
digms, sets of fundamental assumptions about the world – functionalist, interpre-
tive, radical humanist and radical structuralist. Checkland (1981) had argued that 
the approaches he labelled ‘hard systems thinking’, such as systems engineering 
and operational research, could be located in the functionalist paradigm. While 
Jackson accepted that argument, he in turn suggested that soft systems thinking 
could be located in Burrell and Morgan’s interpretive paradigm, which has two 
main characteristics: it views reality in subjective terms, saying that the social world 
is constructed by the actions, interpretations and perspectives of the people within 
it; and it is (at least implicitly) oriented towards consensus and the maintenance of 
17  Michael Jackson

existing social order, rather than focusing on conflict between groups and radi-
cal change.
This orientation towards social order arises implicitly, in Jackson’s view – it is 
not that soft systems approaches set out to maintain existing social order, and thus 
to be conservative, rather that their concern is “to understand the social world as it 
is … there is no interest in radically going beyond the status quo” (Jackson 1982, 
p. 18). While recognising that all three of Churchman, Ackoff and Checkland had a 
personal commitment to radical change in the world, Jackson felt that their method-
ologies did not allow for this change to occur and ultimately that “soft systems 
thinking is most suitable for the kind of social engineering that ensures the contin-
ued survival, by adaptation, of existing social elites” (Jackson 1982, p. 28). While 
these arguments were dismissed at the time by those being criticised, Jackson has 
continued to argue in later writing (e.g. Jackson 2003) that Checkland’s Soft 
Systems Methodology in particular has a limited domain of applicability due to its 
focus on building consensus among stakeholders rather than dealing with issues of 
conflict or coercion.
Jackson followed this critique of existing approaches with an explicit call to take 
a critical approach to Systems, in particular in “social systems where there are great 
disparities in power and in resources and which seem to ‘escape’ the control and 
understanding of the individuals who create and sustain them” (Jackson 1985, 
p. 146). By a critical approach, Jackson understood an approach grounded upon 
critical theory, the post-Marxist social theory associated with the Frankfurt school 
of sociology, and in particular the work of Jürgen Habermas. In his 1985 paper, 
Jackson suggests that it might be possible to apply Habermas’ theory of the way 
communication is distorted in the modern world through unequal power distribu-
tion, as a means of objectively identifying and correcting inequality within systems 
approaches. As we shall see later, different aspects of Habermas’ work were found 
to be more useful within CST, but the paper is notable for the strength of its call for 
a form of Systems based on critical theory and with a clearly emancipatory focus.
A more methodological approach to a critique of systems methodologies came 
around the same time, in collaboration with Jackson’s colleague at Hull, Paul Keys. 
Starting from the view that different methodologies were appropriate in different 
contexts, Jackson and Keys (1984) developed the first version of their System of 
Systems Methodologies (SOSM). This argued that the way systems methodologies 
understood problem situations could be classified on two dimensions – one con-
cerned with the nature of systems, running from simple to complex; and the other 
concerned with the relationship between participants, defined as unitary, pluralist or 
coercive (in later work, this latter dimension would roughly correspond to hard, soft 
and critical approaches). The SOSM, while imperfect in a number of ways, ­provided 
a straightforward tool for examining the relevance of different methodologies to 
problem situations. It also reinforced Jackson’s observation that soft systems 
approaches were not sufficient to cover all kinds of problem situations; and with its 
focus on multiple methodologies, acted as a starting point for Jackson’s later focus 
on pluralism as a key feature of critical systems thinking.
17  Michael Jackson

174
The next stage of Jackson’s work in developing CST involved work on a meta-­
methodology that would give practical shape to the concepts. This work was carried 
out between Jackson and Robert Flood over several years in the late 1980s. Flood 
was based at City University in London until 1988 when he joined Jackson at Hull. 
Flood (2001, p. 245) has written about their collaboration that “we experienced a 
personal and intellectual chemistry that brought together our interests in systemic 
thinking with our deep concern to improve organisational and societal affairs”. The 
result was a ‘meta-methodology’ (so called because it assists in the selection and 
use of other systems methodologies), Total Systems Intervention or TSI.
TSI, designed for assisting in problem situations within organisations was based 
on a critical perspective in that it “employed critique of different systems approaches, 
respected the possibility of ‘coercive’ contexts and was based upon a sophisticated 
form of pluralism in which methodologies adhering to different paradigms were to 
be used in the same intervention on the same problem situation” (Jackson 2001, 
p. 238). It consisted of three phases: creativity, choice and implementation. The 
methodology was backed up by a very thorough discussion and critique of a number 
of the major systems methodologies, so that the book which introduced TSI (Flood 
and Jackson 1991) also acted as a very useful text for understanding each of the 
methodologies in context.
Jackson (1991) set out five ‘commitments’ which formed the heart of CST: “it 
seeks to demonstrate critical awareness; it shows social awareness; it is dedicated to 
human emancipation; it is committed to the complementary and informed develop-
ment of all the different strands of systems thinking at the theoretical level; and it is 
committed to the complementary and informed use of systems methodologies” 
(pp. 184–185). These commitments formed the basis for both CST and TSI – for 
Flood and Jackson, it was necessary to be observing each to be properly following 
critical systems thinking and to be properly using the TSI meta-methodology.
We have already discussed most of Jackson’s five commitments, but comple-
mentarism is worth exploring further. Jackson argued no one systems methodology 
was sufficient to capture all relevant issues in a problem situation. All methodolo-
gies have their strengths and weaknesses, and all can be useful in the right setting. 
What is important is that the methodologies are used in a way that complements 
each other as appropriate. However, TSI encouraged the complete use of method-
ologies, arguing that they were designed as coherent wholes (and arose from clearly 
different paradigms), a matter which formed one of the main criticisms of the 
approach by subsequent authors. In particular, the multimethodology approach 
(Mingers and Gill 1997) argued that it was more productive to design meta-­
methodologies in ways that combined different parts of methodologies as appropri-
ate to the situation, rather than using the whole methodology.
A further important outcome from Jackson’s work in developing CST was the 
identification of three different types of systems approaches – hard, soft and criti-
cal – which continue to be the main groupings in which systems approaches are 
discussed in the UK. While this division clearly stems from and extends Checkland’s 
hard–soft distinction, it was given theoretical underpinning through its identifica-
tion with Habermas’ three forms of knowledge interests – technical, practical and 
17  Michael Jackson

175
emancipatory. Jackson (2019) argues strongly however that CST is concerned with 
human improvement across all three of these knowledge interests. Although CST is 
often equated with an emancipatory stance (including in the first edition of this 
book), Jackson argues that “emancipating individuals from oppressive social rela-
tions is essential but is not the only important aspect of helping people realize their 
full potential” (2019, p.523).
Jackson’s extension of CST and TSI was discussed at length in a book for prac-
titioners (Jackson, 2003) which presented an updated view of TSI, under the name 
of Critical Systems Practice (CSP). In this approach, Jackson shifted away from 
promoting emancipation as the primary goal of his work, and instead locates it as 
one of four paradigms. He updated this book in Jackson (2019), which is a detailed 
and authoritative overview of the field of systems thinking across its many different 
strands, building on the integrative work he started with his Systems of System 
Methodologies. In this later book he divides systems thinking into three groups – 
systems sciences (general systems theory, cybernetics, complexity theory), systems 
practice (which he further divides into six types according to the form of complexity 
they consider – looking at technical, process, structural, organizational, people and 
coercive complexity in turn), and critical systems thinking and practice. In each 
case, he discusses these approaches at length, presenting a critique of their strengths 
and weaknesses.
The breadth of Jackson’s scholarship and understanding of the field in these two 
works is impressive. It has been summed up by Buckle Henning and Chen, who 
mention the Indian story of a group of blind people feeling different parts of an 
elephant and arguing that the whole elephant must resemble the part they had 
touched. They argue that Jackson (2003) “comes closest to a view of the ‘entire 
elephant,’ presenting systems thinking as a plurality of different approaches, each 
with its own usefulness and shortcomings” (Buckle Henning and Chen, 2012, 
p. 473).
Mike Jackson’s work is much more focused on methodologies than many of the 
authors discussed in this book. He has made many important innovations in intro-
ducing and developing the concept of Critical Systems Thinking, and in very 
actively advocating and demonstrating the nature of such an approach. His work has 
done much to encourage emancipatory thinking in Systems, and to force those 
working in other traditions to be clearer about the way their methodologies can deal 
with issues of power and politics.

Creative Holism
The purpose of creative holism is to learn about and harness the various systems 
methodologies, methods and models so that they can best be used by managers to 
respond to the complexity, turbulence and heterogeneity of the problem situations 
they face today. It shares with critical systems thinking, generally, a basic philoso-
phy that can be described by three commitments – to ‘critical awareness’ (of the 
strengths and weaknesses of different systems approaches), ‘pluralism’ (the use in 
combination of different systems methodologies and methods) and ‘improvement’. 
This philosophy will not be discussed further here. The critical systems practice it 
embraces is an enhanced version of ‘total systems intervention’ (Flood and Jackson 
1991). It has four phases – ‘creativity’, ‘choice’, ‘implementation’ and ‘reflection’. 
These phases will be described in turn. […].
In order to appreciate the complexity and heterogeneity of problem situations, it 
is essential for the systems practitioner, in pursuing ‘creativity’, to bring to bear 
radically different views of the world derived from alternative paradigms. Creative 
holism suggests that the perspectives of four paradigms – functionalist, interpretive, 
emancipatory and postmodern – must be considered. In order to achieve this, man-
agers and analysts might explore the paradigms through the use of appropriate met-
aphors, or employ other creativity enhancing devices. The aim is to take the broadest 
possible critical look at the problem situation but gradually to focus down on those 
aspects most crucial to the organisation at this point in its evolution.
Having identified the crucial problems for the organisation, a ‘choice’ has to be 
made of suitable systems methodologies and methods to address the problem situa-
tion. This is done on the basis of a review of the strengths and weaknesses of the 
different methodologies and methods, conducted using paradigm analysis, meta-
phor analysis, past experience, etc. To ensure the broadest possible choice of meth-
odologies, creative holism provides ‘generic methodologies’, representing each of 
the four paradigms mentioned above. One advantage is that the theoretical link back 
to paradigms is made explicit so allowing us to operationalise better, and more obvi-
ously, the hypotheses of particular paradigms and to test these in real-world inter-
ventions. In practice, the difficulties associated with multi-methodology practice 
can be managed if an initial choice of ‘dominant methodology’ is made to run the 
intervention, with a ‘dependant’ methodology (or methodologies), reflecting 
­alternative paradigms, in the background. With regard to the methods, models, etc. 
chosen, creative holism encourages the maximum possible flexibility. It is happy to 
see existing methodologies ‘decomposed’ (Midgley 1997), giving the systems prac-
titioner access to the full range of methods to use in combination, as he or she feels 
appropriate, in support of the generic systems methodologies that are to be employed 
in the intervention. The existence of the generic methodologies ensures that the 
methods are not simply ‘cut-free’ – they can be evaluated as to their usefulness in 
support of methodology and related theory.
‘Implementation’ can then proceed by employing the chosen dominant method-
ology and methods. As intervention progresses, the problems that earlier seemed to 
17  Michael Jackson

177
be crucial may fade into the background and new ones emerge. This can be catered 
for by continually cycling round the phases of creative holism, with different sys-
tems methodologies (and chosen methods) assuming the role of ‘dominant’ and 
‘dependant’ in leading the intervention at particular times. Whichever methodology 
is initially chosen as dominant, the way ‘implementation’ proceeds will be continu-
ally critiqued through the lenses offered by alternative paradigms. Implementation 
should see highly relevant and co-ordinated change effected, which secures improve-
ment in the problem situation according to the concerns of the different paradigms. 
Switches in dominant methodology should be common.
‘Reflection’ seeks to judge how successful the intervention has been in bringing 
about improvement. It does this by taking into account what each paradigm rates as 
most significant. The functionalist paradigm prioritises goal-seeking and viability, 
judging in terms of efficiency and efficacy. The interpretive paradigm prioritises 
exploring purposes by enhancing mutual understanding, judging in terms of effec-
tiveness and elegance. The emancipatory paradigm seeks to ensure fairness, judging 
in terms of empowerment and emancipation. The postmodern paradigm values the 
promotion of diversity, judging in terms of exception and emotion. A highly suc-
cessful intervention should be able to demonstrate progress on all these fronts. 
Reflection also seeks to ensure that research, and the generation of new learning, 
receives the attention it deserves. Any use of creative holism is capable of yielding 
research findings about: how to manage the relationships between different para-
digms; the philosophy and theory that constitutes a paradigm underpinning any 
generic methodology used; the generic systems methodologies employed; the meth-
ods, models, techniques, etc. used; and about the real-world problem situation 
investigated.
I have, elsewhere (Jackson 2000), compared the critical systems practitioner 
with a holistic doctor. Confronted by a patient with pains in her stomach, the doctor 
might initially consider standard explanations, such as over-indulgence, period 
pains or irritable bowel syndrome. If the patient failed to respond to the usual treat-
ment prescribed on the basis of an initial diagnosis you would expect the doctor to 
entertain the possibility of some more deep-seated and dangerous malady. The 
patient might be sent for x-ray, body scan or other tests designed to search for such 
structural problems. If nothing was found, a thoughtful conversation with the patient 
might suggest that the pains were a symptom of anxiety and depression. Various 
forms of counselling or psychological support could be offered. Or, perhaps, a 
knowledge of the patient’s domestic circumstances, and bruises elsewhere on the 
body, might reveal that the patient was suffering at the hands of a violent partner. 
What should the doctor do in these circumstances? Finally, perhaps the patient just 
needs another interest – such as painting or golf – to take her mind off worries 
at work.
We would expect a ‘holistic’ doctor to be open to all these possibilities and to 
have appropriate responses and ‘treatments’ available. To my mind, the critical sys-
tems practitioner, probing with his or her functionalist (positivist and structuralist), 
interpretive, emancipatory and postmodern perspectives, is similarly taking a holis-
tic approach to organisational and societal problems.
Creative Holism

178
Conclusion
Creative holism, a new development in systems thinking, wants to provide manag-
ers with the joint benefits of holism and creativity so that they can do their jobs 
better. Holism by itself confers many advantages over traditional, reductionist 
approaches in dealing with complexity, change and diversity. As systems thinking 
has developed it has discovered a variety of different ways of being holistic, based 
upon different paradigms and metaphors. We are now able, therefore, to be creative 
in the way we approach being holistic. Creative holism enables us to use different 
systems approaches, reflecting alternative holistic perspectives, in combination. 
Perhaps we cannot use all the various systems approach at once, but they can be 
employed creatively, over time, to promote together overall improvement in the 
problem situations managers face. This is the essence of creative holism.
No doubt creative holism will seem ‘difficult’. But then, managerial work is 
becoming more complex, turbulent and diverse. Most managers are likely to find 
themselves, on a regular basis, confronted by ‘messes’ made up of interacting issues 
such as the need to increase productivity, become more market-centred, improve 
communications, adopt fairer recruitment and promotion strategies, and motivate a 
diverse workforce. They will also find themselves having to prioritise between the 
demands made upon them because of lack of time and resources. They cannot tackle 
them all at once. This all seems like common sense. Creative holism is in tune with 
this common sense. It recognises that excellent organisational performance depends 
on managers paying attention to improving goal-seeking and viability, exploring 
purposes, ensuring fairness and promoting diversity. And it offers critical systems 
practice, which provides guidelines on how to tackle in an holistic and balanced 
way, using various systems approaches, the ‘messes’ that managers so often con-
front. Creative holism responds to the everyday problem situations that managers 
have to deal with.
It is one of the satisfactions of systems thinking that its insights translate between 
levels. If we move beyond the organisational to the societal and world levels, we 
find that the same imperatives for improvement, highlighted by creative holism, 
continue to be crucial. We are unlikely to improve things unless we pay attention to 
efficiency and effectiveness, mutual understanding, fairness and diversity. And we 
need to understand the interactions between these and treat them holistically. Few 
of us will get the opportunity to practice our systems thinking on the world stage. 
Perhaps, though, if we pay attention to each and all of these things, as managers in 
organisations, our actions will have a resonance beyond our immediate environ-
ments and, in some way, contribute to global improvement. This is a nice thought. 
Most managers, as well as doing a good job, would like to make things better rather 
than worse for future generations.

Heinz von Foerster
Heinz von Foerster was a physicist and philosopher, who worked extensively in 
cybernetics, biology and family therapy, although he hated being categorised as 
belonging to a particular academic discipline. Indeed he once remarked that “I am 
Viennese. That is the only label that I have to accept. I come from Vienna; I was 
born there, that’s an established fact” (von Foerster and Poerksen 2002, p. 43).
The Vienna that Heinz von Foerster was born into in 1911 was a centre of con-
siderable culture and academic thought, where “in all fields there was a breakaway 
from the classic and from the standards of the nineteenth century perspective … 
everybody was connected and arguing about what art, politics, philosophy, should 
be” (in Franchi et al. 2005, p. 16). The young von Foerster grew up in a family of 
architects and artists (Glanville 2011) and was strongly influenced by the Vienna 
Circle of logical positivists (as was Ludwig von Bertalanffy, also from Vienna). This 
group excited him with their consideration of second-order questions: not just the 
study of mathematics and philosophy, but the study of the nature of those disciplines 
through the tools of those disciplines. The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, a dis-
tant relative and close friend of the family and was also a key early influence (with 
his focus on language and meaning), and von Foerster quoted passages from 
Wittgenstein’s Tractatus logico-philosophicus in much of his subsequent writing. 
As a teenager, von Foerster became interested in magic and joined the Magic Circle, 
a hobby which stayed with him all his life and which influenced his later focus on 
perception and paradox. Glanville (2011) argues that his early years in Vienna led 
von Foerster to approach academic life as an artistic endeavour, through design, 
music, the precision of his writing, and his performance as a lecturer.
Von Foerster trained as a physicist in Vienna, and worked in a German radar 
laboratory during World War II. As some of his relatives were Jewish, and his family 
were well-known in Vienna, when the Nazis came to Austria he moved to Berlin, 
and throughout the war managed to hide his non-Aryan status. After the war he 
returned to Vienna where he worked for a few years, but the extreme poverty of the 
city in that time led him to emigrate to the United States in 1949, where he lived and 
worked for the rest of his life. He died in California in 2002, followed the next year 

184
by his wife Mai, who he married in Vienna in 1939 and from whom he was 
inseparable.
While in Vienna after the war, he published a study of the nature of memory, 
using techniques from quantum physics, which hypothesised that memorising and 
forgetting worked rather like the quantum behaviour of large molecules. Shortly 
after he arrived in the US, this work came to the attention of Warren McCulloch, 
who invited von Foerster to Chicago to discuss the work. McCulloch invited von 
Foerster to the sixth Macy conference on cybernetics, where he presented his work 
in very faltering English (but as there were a number of German emigrants present, 
he was able to communicate). The conference’s reaction to his presentation was: 
“What you had to say was extremely interesting, but the way you expressed it was 
a disaster. In order to help you learn English as quickly as possible we hereby 
declare you the editor of the reports of our conference” (von Foerster and Poerksen 
2002, p. 136). Von Foerster (with help from Margaret Mead and Hans-Lukas Teuber) 
thus edited the proceedings of that conference and the four remaining Macy confer-
ences, and he became a core part of the Macy group.
In 1951, von Foerster took up a post at the University of Illinois, where he 
remained until his retirement in 1976. Initially he held a chair in signal processing 
and directed an electron tubes laboratory, working on microwaves. In 1958 he estab-
lished what was to be his primary institutional base, and a key centre for the devel-
opment of cybernetics in the US – the Biological Computing Laboratory (BCL).
The BCL can readily be seen as a continuation of McCulloch’s project of experi-
mental epistemology. Its major themes included “logic and epistemology, language 
recognition, and communication” (von Foerster and Poerksen 2002, p. 140). It arose 
at a time when cybernetics was bifurcating, into a comparatively ‘soft’ side focused 
on epistemology and biology, and a comparatively ‘hard’ side focused on computa-
tion. The harder side, centred around MIT, gradually dropped the term cybernetics 
in favour of artificial intelligence. As Krieg (2005, p. 552) describes it, BCL became 
“the rallying point for the ‘soft’ side of cybernetics”.
The staff and visitors of BCL included many of the key thinkers in cybernetics in 
the 1960s and 1970s, including Humberto Maturana, Ross Ashby, Francisco Varela, 
Gordon Pask and Stafford Beer. Many of these thinkers developed some of their key 
ideas while at the BCL (especially Maturana and Ashby). Von Foerster, as its direc-
tor, was closely involved in all of the different strands of BCL’s work, although he 
sometimes presented himself simply as a promoter of others’ ideas – “it often felt as 
though the impresario role was the more important one to him, and he would often 
hide his own achievement behind the work of others who he had promoted” 
(Glanville 2002, p. 157). He also interacted with thinkers outside the BCL, such as 
Niklas Luhmann who was very influenced by his ideas (Clarke 2011).
The BCL was dependent on a series of ongoing research grants, mostly funded 
through the US military, which was a major source of research funding in the 1950s 
and 1960s to a range of projects with no particular military connection or applica-
tion. However, protests over the Vietnam war led to growing public concern over the 
influence of the military on American academia, and the passing of a law in 1970 
that the US Department of Defence only fund projects with a specific military

impact (Umpleby 2003). Von Foerster was not able to argue that BCL’s work had 
such an impact, and its defence funding was withdrawn. This resulted in the gradual 
decline of BCL, as it was no longer able to afford the kinds of researchers who had 
previously worked there, and it closed when von Foerster retired in 1976.
Throughout his time at Illinois, von Foerster’s concern and that of BCL was with 
issues of perception and epistemology, and a keenness to extend cybernetics to 
include the nature of the observer as well as the system being observed. These ideas 
gradually coalesced into his greatest intellectual contribution, the concept of second-­
order cybernetics. In a speech in 1974, he defined this as follows: “the cybernetics 
of observed systems we may consider to be first-order cybernetics; while second-­
order cybernetics is the cybernetics of observing systems” (von Foerster 2003, 
p. 285).
It is important to realise that this term ‘second-order’ is meant logically rather 
than historically. It is inaccurate to interpret the phrase in terms of progress, where 
the second-order is more important than, and drives out, the first-order. Rather, it 
refers to the taking of cybernetic principles of feedback, information and communi-
cation, and their application to the observer as much as to the system being 
observed – in Scott’s terms (2003), a reflexive cybernetics. The seeds of this reflex-
ivity can readily be found in Wiener and McCulloch’s work, and quite explicitly in 
that of Bateson, as discussed by Hayles (1999). Interestingly, von Foerster did not 
publicly name second-order cybernetics until quite late, shortly before the closure 
of BCL – the perspective of reflexivity and the role of the observer came before 
the name.
Von Foerster is frequently described as one of the founders of the constructivist 
approach to philosophy – the view that there is no independent reality, only our 
understanding of the world which we construct individually and may not match 
with that of any other individual. This is related to the social construction approach 
first expressed by Berger and Luckmann (1966), although it is more individualist. 
Second-order cybernetics, with its focus on the observer and on reflexivity (as well 
as the approach later described by Maturana as the “biology of cognition”) can 
clearly be seen as being involved with individual constructivism. Segal (2001) 
argues that von Foerster’s constructivism “is concerned with the convergence of two 
central themes: (1) how we know what we know, and (2) an abiding concern for the 
present state of the world and its humanity” (p. 1).
As well as his work at BCL, von Foerster made other organisational contribu-
tions to cybernetics and systems. He was strongly involved in the founding and 
early years of the American Society for Cybernetics (ASC) as chair of its board of 
directors, ensuring that it continued the legacy of the BCL and performing ‘bound-
ary work’ to exclude those who did not take a stance compatible with second-order 
cybernetics (Kline 2015, p.199). When the ASC became dormant in the 1970s, he 
joined the Society for General Systems Research (with a number of other key mem-
bers of the ASC), becoming chair of the SGSR in 1976.
A further contribution of von Foerster’s was that he organised the first major 
conference on self-organising systems, in 1959 at the BCL, with participants includ-
ing Warren McCulloch, Ludwig von Bertalanffy, Anatol Rapoport, the economist 
18  Heinz von Foerster

186
Friedrich von Hayek, Stafford Beer, Ross Ashby and Gordon Pask. Typically icono-
clastic, von Foerster (1960) argued at the conference that there was no such thing as 
a self-organising system. His paper did, however, introduce the concept of ‘order 
from noise’, later influential in complexity theory.
When he retired in 1976, he moved to California, from where he continued to 
write and give lectures until his death in 2002. He and Mai lived near the ocean, on 
a hill called Rattlesnake Hill from which he spent much time clearing undergrowth, 
and where they welcomed many visitors during the rest of their lives. Von Foerster 
was an inspiration and a dear friend to many people, not least because of his deeply 
ethical way of being, described by Bessie (2003, p. 199), as based on an attitude that:
One must always be open; the other is always interesting, a person, not a function. Charm 
there certainly was, but this was not charm, it was the quintessence of true courtesy, a wel-
coming of the world. … The most casual acquaintances seemed to sense a “specialness” in 
this man, not the effect of a wonderful mind, but the effect of an ethos that welcomed.
In his later work, he became interested in three closely-related topics: the impor-
tance of language, questions of ethics and the application of his ideas to family 
therapy.
Von Foerster’s concern for language had two main sources – an interest in preci-
sion and in dialogue. The former is perhaps inevitable given his early training 
through the Vienna Circle and the work of Wittgenstein. He argued that “it is vital 
that the entire language in second-order cybernetics changes. The references to a 
world that is independent of an observer are replaced by references to oneself” (von 
Foerster and Poerksen 2002, p. 110). Much of his later work was conducted via 
dialogue with one or two others, who would then publish the dialogue as an article 
or book. He related this closely to his interest in language: “Language for me is an 
invitation to dance. When we are dancing we are using language to suggest to each 
other what steps we would like to do. … Togetherness is the point in a dialogue. And 
language is an invitation to dialogue and not an invitation to monologue” (von 
Foerster in Waters 1999, p.  83). He was described by Poerksen (2003) as “the 
Socrates of cybernetics” but unlike the Socratic dialogues (as represented by Plato), 
where the dialogue partner’s role is simply to agree with the great man, von 
Foerster’s dialogue partners were active participants who disagreed with him and 
questioned him about his ideas.
Von Foerster took a strong interest in ethics, shaped by his constructivist world-
view. For him, ethical positions were essentially individual and were always shaped 
by the situation within which the ethical question arose: “you can’t discuss ethical 
questions while you are relaxing in your easy chair. They arise in a concrete situa-
tion rather than being abstract and being able to be discussed out of context” (von 
Foerster and Poerksen 2002, p. 148). His ethical stance was strongly based on the 
importance of enabling human beings to become the best they can be, not con-
strained by others’ negative choices, a view summed up in his saying “act always to 
increase the number of choices” (von Foerster 2003, p. 295).
Connected both to language and to ethics was von Foerster’s contributions in 
later life to family therapy. Especially in the US, this field has been strongly influ-
18  Heinz von Foerster

187
enced by the cybernetic work of Gregory Bateson on communication and paradox. 
Von Foerster’s second-order cybernetics (and his constructivism) was in many ways 
a natural extension of Bateson’s approach, and acted in the 1980s and 1990s as a 
strong impetus to change within family therapy. He had a strong influence on the 
Mental Research Institute in Palo Alto (California), on Paul Watzlawick who had 
worked with Gregory Bateson, and on the school of family therapists in Milan. 
Cecchin et  al. (2005, p.  332), members of the Milan school, summed up von 
Foerster’s influence as follows, in a way very close to his constructivist and dialogic 
position:
a family comes to you, you talk, and from the questions you ask they construct a set of pos-
sibilities, or fantasies. These are maps of unknown territory that are valid for as long as 
people talk about them. … If, as a therapist, you become embroiled in a model that claims 
to have some direct relationship with the ‘truth’, the model becomes reality, and reality pins 
you down. The model is useful only until it becomes reality.
In many ways, Heinz von Foerster’s contributions to systems parallel those of 
Peter Checkland. He gave a name to an emerging realignment of the field, ran the 
main institutional setting for that realignment, and acted as an inspiration to succes-
sive colleagues and students. Both were concerned with an epistemological shift, 
from positivism to phenomenology, and both turned the spotlight on to the observer 
as well as the observed. In Checkland’s case that project resulted in soft systems 
methodology (at the Systems Department, University of Lancaster); in von Foerster’s 
the result was second-order cybernetics (at the BCL).
Heinz von Foerster had a crucial influence upon cybernetics, shaping its current 
form through his own research and his support for others’ research. Krippendorf 
(2003, p. 195) described von Foerster as
asking questions that others had not thought of; turning conventional beliefs into puzzling 
opposites; leading his audiences to consider alternative ways of thinking … Heinz’ greatest 
strength undoubtedly was his ability to encourage others to be audacious as well, to have 
the courage to ponder radical questions. Doing this was his cybernetics and it has now 
become ours.

Ladies and gentlemen – As you may remember, I opened my remarks at earlier 
conferences of our Society with theorems which, owing to the generosity of Stafford 
Beer, have been called “Heinz von Foerster’s Theorems Number One and Number 
Two”. This all is now history (Beer 1975; von Foerster 1972). However, building on 
Reading from von Foerster’s work

188
a tradition of two instances, you may rightly expect me to open my remarks today 
again with a theorem. Indeed I shall do so but it will not bear my name. It can be 
traced back to Humberto Maturana (1970), the Chilean neurophysiologist, who a 
few years ago, fascinated us with his presentation on ‘autopoiesis’, the organization 
of living things.
Here is Maturana’s proposition, which I shall now baptize “Humberto Maturana’s 
Theorem Number One”:
Anything said is said by an observer.
Should you at first glance be unable to sense the profundity that hides behind the 
simplicity of this proposition let me remind you of West Churchman’s admonition 
of this afternoon: “You will be surprised how much can be said by a tautology”. 
This, of course, he said in utter defiance of the logician’s claim that a tautology says 
nothing.
I would like to add to Maturana’s Theorem a corollary which, in all modesty, I 
shall call “Heinz von Foerster’s Corollary Number One”:
Anything said is said to an observer.
With these two propositions a nontrivial connection between three concepts has 
been established. First, that of an observer who is characterized by being able to 
make descriptions. This is because of Theorem 1. Of course, what an observer says 
is a description. The second concept is that of language. Theorem 1 and Corollary 
1 connect two observers through language. But, in turn, by this connection we have 
established the third concept I wish to consider this evening, namely that of society: 
the two observers constitute the elementary nucleus for a society. Let me repeat the 
three concepts that are in a triadic fashion connected to each other. They are: first, 
the observers; second, the language they use; and third, the society they form by the 
use of their language. This interrelationship can be compared, perhaps, with the 
interrelationship between the chicken, and the egg, and the rooster. You cannot say 
who was first and you cannot say who was last. You need all three in order to have 
all three. In order to appreciate what I am going to say it might be advantageous to 
keep this closed triadic relation in mind.
I have no doubts that you share with me the conviction that the central problems 
of today are societal. On the other hand, the gigantic problem-solving conceptual 
apparatus that evolved in our Western culture is counterproductive not only for solv-
ing but essentially for perceiving social problems. One root for our cognitive blind 
spot that disables us to perceive social problems is the traditional explanatory 
­paradigm which rests on two operations: One is causation, the other one deduction. 
It is interesting to note that something that cannot be explained – that is, for which 
we cannot show a cause or for which we do not have a reason – we do not wish to 
see. In other words, something that cannot be explained cannot be seen. This is 
driven home again and again by Don Juan, a Yaqui Indian, Carlos Casteneda’s men-
tor (Castaneda 1969).
It is quite clear that in his teaching efforts Don Juan wants to make a cognitive 
blind spot in Castaneda’s vision to be filled with new perceptions; he wants to make 
18  Heinz von Foerster

189
him ‘see’. This is doubly difficult, because of Castaneda’s dismissal of experiences 
as ‘illusions’ for which he has no explanations on the one hand, and because of a 
peculiar property of the logical structure of the phenomenon ‘blind spot’ on the 
other hand; and this is that we do not perceive our blind spot by, for instance, seeing 
a black spot close to the centre of our visual field: we do not see that we have a blind 
spot. In other words, we do not see that we do not see. This I will call a second order 
deficiency, and the only way to overcome such deficiencies is with therapies of sec-
ond order.
The popularity of Carlos Castaneda’s books suggest to me that his points are 
being understood: new paradigms emerge. I’m using the term ‘paradigm’ in the 
sense of Thomas Kuhn (1962) who wants to indicate with this term a culture spe-
cific, or language specific, stereotype or model for linking descriptions semanti-
cally. As you may remember, Thomas Kuhn argues that there is a major change in 
paradigms when the one in vogue begins to fail, shows inconsistencies or contradic-
tions. I however argue that I can name at least two instances in which not the emer-
gent defectiveness of the dominant paradigm but its very flawlessness is the cause 
for its rejection. One of these instances was Copernicus’ novel vision of a heliocen-
tric planetary system which he perceived at a time when the Ptolemaeic geocentric 
system was at its height as to accuracy of its predictions. The other instance, I sub-
mit, is being brought about today by some of us who cannot – by their life – pursue 
any longer the flawless, but sterile path that explores the properties seen to reside 
within objects, and turn around to explore their very properties seen now to reside 
within the observer of these objects. Consider, for instance, ‘obscenity’. There is at 
aperiodic intervals a ritual performed by the supreme judges of this land in which 
they attempt to establish once and for all a list of all the properties that define an 
obscene object or act. Since obscenity is not a property residing within things (for if 
we show Mr. X a painting and he calls it obscene, we know a lot about Mr. X but 
very little about the painting), when our lawmakers will finally come up with their 
imaginary list we shall know a lot about them but their laws will be dangerous 
nonsense.
With this I come now to the other root for our cognitive blind spot and this is a 
peculiar delusion within our Western tradition, namely, ‘objectivity’:
The properties of the observer shall not enter the description of his observations.
But I ask, how would it be possible to make a description in the first place if not 
the observer were to have properties that allows for a description to be made? Hence, 
I submit in all modesty, the claim for objectivity is nonsense! One might be tempted 
to negate ‘objectivity’ and stipulate now ‘subjectivity’. But, ladies and gentlemen, 
please remember that if a nonsensical proposition is negated, the result is again a 
nonsensical proposition. However, the nonsensicality of these propositions either in 
the affirmative or in their negation cannot be seen in the conceptual framework in 
which these propositions have been uttered. If this is the state of affairs, what can be 
done? We have to ask a new question:
What are the properties of an observer?
Reading from von Foerster’s work

190
Let me at once draw your attention to the peculiar logic underlying this question. 
For whatever properties we may come up with it is we, you and I, who have to make 
this observation, that is, we have to observe our own observing, and ultimately 
account for our own accounting. Is this not opening the door for the logical mischief 
of propositions that refer to themselves (“I am a liar”) that have been so successfully 
excluded by Russell’s Theory of Types not to bother us ever again? Yes and No!
It is most gratifying for me to report to you that the essential conceptual pillars 
for a theory of the observer have been worked out. The one is a calculus of infinite 
recursions (Weston and von Foerster 1973); the other one is a calculus of self-­
reference (Varela 1975). With these calculi we are now able to enter rigorously a 
conceptual framework which deals with observing and not only with the observed.
Earlier I proposed that a therapy of the second order has to be invented in order 
to deal with dysfunctions of the second order. I submit that the cybernetics of 
observed systems we may consider to be first-order cybernetics; while second-order 
cybernetics is the cybernetics of observing systems. This is in agreement with 
another formulation that has been given by Gordon Pask (1969). He, too, distin-
guishes two orders of analysis. The one in which the observer enters the system by 
stipulating the system’s purpose. We may call this a ‘first-order stipulation’. In a 
‘second-order stipulation’ the observer enters the system by stipulating his own 
purpose.
From this it appears to be clear that social cybernetics must be a second-order 
cybernetics – a cybernetics of cybernetics – in order that the observer who enters the 
system shall be allowed to stipulate his own purpose: he is autonomous. If we fail to 
do so somebody else will determine a purpose for us. Moreover, if we fail to do so, 
we shall provide the excuses for those who want to transfer the responsibility for 
their own actions to somebody else: “I am not responsible for my actions; I just 
obey orders.” Finally, if we fail to recognize autonomy of each, we may turn into a 
society that attempts to honor commitments and forgets about its responsibilities.
I am most grateful to the organizers and the speakers of this conference who 
permitted me to see cybernetics in the context of social responsibility.

Chapter 19
Stafford Beer
Stafford Beer was a consultant, manager and cybernetician. He was the first person 
to apply cybernetics to management problems. He combined theory and practice in 
a highly integrated way, always working as a practitioner but making a number of 
important contributions in both methodology and theory. His writing was highly 
inspirational as well as academically rigorous, and he had a profound impact upon 
those with whom he worked as a consultant and colleague. As Rosenhead (2006, 
p. 581) has written, “he explored in his work the implications of a holistic approach 
to organizational and social problems, and exemplified this approach in his own life”.
Beer’s single greatest contribution to systems thinking was the creation of man-
agement cybernetics – the application of cybernetic principles to the management 
of large organizations. As a manager working within several large organizations, he 
had a clear professional need for this work, but it also derived from his own poly-
math nature. His longest academic association was with the Manchester Business 
School, where he was visiting professor for 24 years, although he was a visiting 
professor at many other universities. He never took a first degree, leaving university 
after a year to join the army, though he subsequently gained an M.B.A. and a D.Sc. 
(higher doctorate) as well as several honorary degrees. A number of consultancy 
firms were established around his ideas and with his involvement. Anthony Stafford 
Beer was born in 1926 in the UK and died in 2002 in Canada. He came early to 
management, appointed at age 18 as a captain in the Gurkha Rifles in India, where 
he served for 3 years, and then as an army psychologist in the UK for a further 
2 years. Leaving the army in 1949, he went to work at a branch of United Steel (then 
the UK’s largest steel company) where he set up the company’s operational research 
and cybernetics group. In 1960 he left to set up the UK’s first operational research 
consultancy, SIGMA, where he worked until 1966, after which he spent 4 years as 
development director of International Publishing Corporation, then the largest pub-
lishing company in the world. From 1970 onwards he worked as an independent 
consultant and visiting academic. As well as working with commercial organisa-
tions, he worked with the governments of a number of Latin American nations, 

194
including Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela, but most famously that of Chile during 
the Allende government of the early 1970s, discussed in detail below.
He learned yoga in India and practiced and taught it subsequently, was a pub-
lished poet, and had a number of exhibitions of his paintings. He spoke a number of 
languages, with particular interest in Sanskrit, Greek and Latin (as well as more 
modern languages including Hindi and Spanish). Beer married twice and subse-
quently was the partner of Allenna Leonard, herself a cybernetician and president of 
the American Society for Cybernetics. He had eight children, one of whom, the 
artist Vanilla Beer, drew covers for a number of his books. Rosenhead (2006, p. 580) 
described him as follows:
Stafford Beer was a larger-than-life character. He was tall, broad and brimful of energy, and 
in later years bearded like an Old Testament prophet. His enthusiasm for life in its many 
aspects could be over-powering and quite non-Anglo-Saxon. The world of those who 
encountered him tended to polarize between those who were distrustful of what they saw as 
his showmanship, and those who were converted into lifelong admirers and supporters. He 
himself was deeply loyal and affectionate to his friends. It was typical that Stafford spent 
the year following the Pinochet coup concentrating on helping to find safe places outside 
Chile for members of the project team.
Beer was a contributor to the systems movement throughout his life. He was the 
collaborator and friend of many of the key people in systems thinking (notably 
Warren McCulloch, who he regarded as a mentor, Ross Ashby, Gordon Pask, Heinz 
von Foerster and Russell Ackoff). He was president of a number of prominent inter-
national associations: the Society for General Systems Research, the Operational 
Research Society, and the World Organisation of Systems and Cybernetics. Although 
he was not at the Macy conferences, he did attend the first international conference 
on cybernetics in Namur, Belgium in 1956 and many subsequent important 
conferences.
The basis of Beer’s management cybernetics was a strong belief that both com-
mercial organisations and society as a whole needed to become significantly more 
flexible and able to change, as reflected in the reading below. As described by 
Pickering (2004, p. 499), as early as 1959 Beer argued that “the important thing for 
organisations was that they should be adaptive – light on their feet and ready to 
accommodate themselves to the new situations which would arise faster and faster 
as time passed”. This strikingly modern view was one found among a number of 
other systems thinkers of the time (including Donald Schön and Eric Trist) but not 
prevalent in wider management circles until several decades later. Adaptability to 
change has been emphasised as a key theme of cybernetics (and later of complexity 
theory) since the work of Ross Ashby, and Beer’s work was crucial in demonstrating 
how adaptability could work in practice for the design of organisations and society.
Management cybernetics was centred around Beer’s development of the Viable 
System Model (VSM). The purpose of this model is “to explain how systems are 
viable – that is, capable of independent existence … [and] to elucidate the laws of 
viability in order to facilitate the management task” (Beer 1984, p. 7). The model 
was at first developed in mathematical terms (using set theory), secondly in neuro-
physiological terms, and latterly in more simple mathematics using a topological 
19  Stafford Beer

195
version of the original set-theoretic model – that is, a set of rigorous diagrams mod-
elling the nature of a viable system.
The VSM is based on the principle of recursion, “that any viable system contains 
and is contained in a viable system” (Beer 1984, p. 8). This is important because it 
means that a system can be viable whatever level it exists at (individual, group, 
organisational, or societal). Beer’s concept of a viable system, whatever its level, 
contains five subsystems, with the functions of implementation, coordination, con-
trol, planning and policy-making (Espejo 1989). These five roles do not necessarily 
belong to different people, and it is important they not be mapped on to a hierarchi-
cal model of the organisation, but Beer defines a clear set of communication and 
monitoring channels between the five subsystems. The VSM can be seen as a way 
of designing the organisational adaptability discussed earlier. However, as Harwood 
(2019, p. 1200) argues, it does not fix the nature of organisations that it designs: “the 
VSM, as a model, can be viewed, not as a representation of reality, but as a device 
to support the handling of reality”.
The VSM continues to be used widely in systems research and practice. It has 
been widely discussed in the management and systems literature, and is viewed 
both positively and negatively. Jackson (1989) sums up the debate:
Its advocates would claim that it is of immeasurable value to managers trying to design and 
operate goal-seeking, adaptive systems. It provides a sophisticated organisational model 
which embodies great explanatory power and is readily applicable. … To its critics, how-
ever, the VSM is of dubious value even as a tool for increasing efficiency and effectiveness. 
The emphasis it places on organisational design may preclude proper attention being given 
to the generation of shared perceptions and values; to ‘organisational culture’. Further, the 
imposition of a particular design may become fixed and prevent necessary adaptation.
Beer’s experiences in Chile demonstrate his ideas and values clearly. In 1970, the 
democratically-elected Marxist government of Salvador Allende came to power in 
Chile. One of Allende’s ministers (Fernando Flores, a professor of management sci-
ence) invited Beer to Chile in November 1971. Over the next 2 years, Beer became 
intimately involved in the governing of the country, using an early version of the 
Viable Systems Model.
Through working with a small group within Chile, and talking to a wide range of 
influential people, after 8 days of work he formulated a “plan for the cybernetic 
regulation of the social economy of Chile” (Beer 1981, p. 248). The plan would 
have two key features – it would regulate the social economy in real time, and it 
would support the decentralised decision-making that distinguished Allende’s form 
of Marxism from the Soviet model. The project to do this was called Cybersyn 
(from ‘cybernetic synergy’) in English – Proyecto Synco in Spanish – and the inten-
tion was to implement “a preliminary system of information and regulation for the 
industrial economy” (Beer 1981, p. 251) by March 1972 – four and a half months 
after the plan was formulated. The problem was large: there were insufficient 
resources to make computing power available locally, so computation of the cyber-
netic model was carried out centrally; but the only telecommunications system 
available was a basic telex system that ran down the length of the country

(3000 miles). Before Beer left Chile at the end of his first visit, he met with Allende, 
and discussed with him a model of the Chilean industrial economy as a viable system.
The preliminary design of the Chilean industry economy using the VSM was 
completed by Beer following his return to London, along with a group based in 
Chile. In due course, Project Cybersyn was widened to cover the whole country, and 
Beer was appointed as Scientific Director of the project, working largely in Chile. 
The project was partially completed, although the political instability meant con-
tinual change in the nature of the system being used. However, the effect was short-­
lasting, since in September 1973, there was a military coup, Allende was killed, and 
the government fell. Cybersyn has been the subject of a number of significant stud-
ies of its role as a sociotechnical system combining technology, organisation, design 
and politics, notably a book by Eden Medina who describes the project as “one of 
the most ambitious applications of cybernetics ideas in history because of its 
national scope and because it formed part of a larger project for economic, social, 
and political transformation” (Medina 2011, p. 219).
Beer was working in London at the time of the Chilean coup, so escaped its 
physical impact, but its effect on him was considerable. He renounced his material 
possessions in 1974 and moved to a small remote cottage in mid-Wales where he 
lived alone for 10 years. Subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he divided his time 
between mid-Wales and Toronto, the home of Allenna Leonard. The political impli-
cations of Beer’s work have been widely discussed – it has been described both as a 
form of ‘socialist cybernetics’, because of his Chilean experiences (Eaton 2018) and 
as a key foundation for the ‘anarchist cybernetics’ which Swann (2018) advocates 
while acknowledging that Beer was not himself an anarchist.
Beer’s writing ranged from the highly technical to the extremely readable, with 
real passion and poetry in his works, and various experimental styles of presenting 
complex multi-layered ideas. He published a number of books – one of his first, 
Decision and Control (Beer 1966) was awarded the Operations Research Society of 
America’s prestigious Lanchester Award and remained in print for decades. His tril-
ogy of books on the Viable System Model, Brain of the Firm (Beer 1981, 2nd edi-
tion), Heart of Enterprise (Beer 1979) and Diagnosing the System for Organisations 
(Beer 1985), remain the central works on that approach. He also published a number 
of collections of shorter works.
Beer was an early advocate of Humberto Maturana’s work, having met him both 
through Heinz von Foerster and while working in Chile, and wrote a preface to his 
key book Autopoiesis and Cognition (Maturana and Varela 1980). Beer used the 
concept of autopoiesis (see the chapter on Maturana) in a management context in a 
most interesting way. He coined the term “pathologically autopoietic” to refer to 
organisations (such as hospitals and universities) where “the staff slides into the 
error of paying more and more attention to those matters that explicate relationships 
than to healing or teaching – so that in the end a cured patient or an educated student 
were only the product of self-help and good luck” (Beer 1987).
In the final years of Beer’s life, his chief interest was a methodology for effective 
and democratic group processes, Team Syntegrity, described in his last major book, 
Beyond Dispute (Beer 1994). Using a mixture of mathematics, cybernetics and 
19  Stafford Beer

197
architecture, the process specifies the way that groups of 30 people can make col-
lective decisions on complex topics that involve all of them. The process is based on 
Buckminster Fuller’s designs for very large, highly stable domes using the icosahe-
dron (a shape with 20 faces and 30 edges) and the observation that if the edges of 
the icosahedron are taken to represent the members of a team, then each team mem-
ber will be connected equally to every other team member. Around this model Beer 
and his collaborators have built up a process that allows a group connected in such 
a way to make decisions.
Team Syntegrity clearly illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of Beer’s work. 
It derives from well-developed concepts from a range of different disciplines, espe-
cially cybernetics, and it exists because of Beer’s deep concern for the state of the 
world and the importance of democracy. Team Syntegrity has both theoretical rigour 
and strong practical validity – as Pickering (2004, p. 515) argues, it is “a practical 
sub-political set-up in which democratic deliberation and planning could be con-
ducted in a completely open-ended fashion developed through practice”. On the 
other hand, it is very complex and rather prescriptive in the requirements it places 
on both facilitators and clients – it is not hard to argue that the organisation must 
conform to the model rather than the other way around. It also requires both great 
skill from the facilitators and a high degree of technological back-up.
Stafford Beer was a prolific writer, highly-skilled practitioner and consultant, 
and originator of many important concepts within management cybernetics. He was 
a man of deep learning, considerable practical ability, and great passion. Allenna 
Leonard (quoted in Cullen 2003) described him as:
a true pathfinder; curious about almost everything and under no illusions about the implica-
tions of our accelerating rate of change. He read widely and sought out people to learn from 
to educate himself in intellectual matters; he pursued spiritual development all his life; at 
first in the context of the church and later by study and meditation.
Leonard also noted Beer’s fondness for the poetry of Antonio Machado, whose 
work he often quoted. In particular, the following lines sum up Stafford Beer’s intel-
lectual journey and his understanding of the importance of adaptability, both by 
individuals and by structures:
Walker, there is no road
The road is made as you walk.

green sea under a winter sun. It is for me a time of peace, a time to clear the head, a 
time to treasure.
For after all, such times are rare events for today’s civilized man. We spend our 
days boxed in our houses, swarming in and out of office blocks like tribes of ants, 
crammed into trains, canned in aeroplanes, locked solid in traffic jams on the free-
way. Our unbiblical concern for what we shall eat, what we shall drink, and what we 
shall put on is amplified and made obsessional by the pressure to consume – way, 
way beyond the natural need. All this is demanded by the way we have arranged our 
economy. And the institutions we have built to operate that economy, to safeguard 
ourselves, protect our homes, care for and educate our families, have all grown into 
large and powerful pieces of social machinery which suddenly seem not so much 
protective as actually threatening.
Mankind has always been in battle with his environment. But until quite recently 
in history his battles were on a reasonable scale, a human scale. He could alter his 
house, if he would brave the weather: he did not have to take on the whole city plan-
ning department and the owners of his mortgage and his overdraft. He could dress 
his children as he pleased, teaching them what he knew and how to learn: he was not 
flattened in this natural enterprise by educational authorities, attended by boards of 
experts. When he fought with danger, he matched his strength and skill with another 
animal of similar size to his: he was not unexpectedly knocked flying by two tons of 
steel travelling at sixty miles an hour. And if he faced the fact of death, that also was 
a personal encounter, win or lose: he did not live under the stress of a remotely 
threatened genocide or nuclear extermination. Bur this is how it is for us. We do not 
think much about it. When things go badly, there is all of this to blame, and not 
ourselves: perhaps that is some sort of consolation.
Do we indeed even want to think about such things? I believe that people increas-
ingly do begin to question the assumptions of our society – and not because of any 
characteristic that I have so far mentioned. Most people alive today in urban societ-
ies settled long ago for the role of pygmy man amidst the giants of his own institu-
tions, and for the reason that it meant apparent advance – a higher standard of living, 
as measured by the gross national product per head. But in the last decade or two 
something has come through to public consciousness. It is the doubt as to whether 
the whole apparatus of our civilization actually works any longer. Is it beginning 
to fail?
The evidence for this suspicion is plentiful. I instance the decay of previously 
rich and healthy cities from the centre outwards, creating ghettos and all the social 
frightfulness that goes with them, stark inequalities, private penury, social squalor, 
a rise in crime, a rise in violence. I instance pollution on a world-wide scale: the 
poisoning of the atmosphere, of seas and lakes and rivers. Then there is the widen-
ing chasm between luxury and starvation, whereby we somehow manage to concen-
trate more wealth with the already wealthy, and more deprivation with the already 
deprived. I will not go on with this baleful list, because conscientious people are 
already aware of these problems. The question I would like us to address in these 
lectures is just why? Because if we can fathom that, maybe we can also conduct a 
fruitful search for answers.

The first point to establish is the most difficult; and it is the most difficult because 
it sounds so easy. It is to say that all these institutions we have been contemplating – 
the homes, the offices, the schools, the cities, the firms, the states, the countries – 
are not just things, entities we recognize and label. They are instead dynamic and 
surviving systems. Well, I did say it sounds so easy. Obviously these entities are 
systems; because they consist of related parts, and the relations – the connexions – 
between those parts. Obviously, too, they are dynamic. No-one believes that these 
institutions are just sitting there brooding; they are all ‘on the go’. Finally, if they 
were not surviving, they would not be there. And having taken the point that we are 
talking about such systems, it is too natural to pass it by – to pass over the point, 
pass around the point, pass through the point – without ever grappling with the real 
meaning of the point at all.
Although we may recognize the systemic nature of the world, and would agree 
when challenged that something we normally think of as an entity is actually a 
system, our culture does not propound this insight as particularly interesting or 
profitable to contemplate. Let me propose to you a little exercise, taking the bay I 
am looking at now as a convenient example. It is not difficult to recognize that the 
movement of water in this bay is the visible behaviour of a dynamic system: after 
all, the waves are steadily moving in and dissipating themselves along the shore. 
But please consider just one wave. We think of that as an entity: a wave, we say. 
What is it doing out there, why is it that shape, and what is the reason for its happy 
white crest? The exercise is to ask yourself in all honesty not whether you know 
the answers, because that would be just a technical exercise, but whether these are 
the sorts of question that have ever arisen for you. The point is that the questions 
themselves – and not just the answers – can be understood only when we stop 
thinking of the wave as an entity. As long as it is an entity, we tend to say well, 
waves are like that: the facts that our wave is out there moving across the bay, has 
that shape and a happy white crest, are the signs that tell me “It’s a wave” – just as 
the fact that a book is red and no other colour is a sign that tells me “That’s the 
book I want”.
The truth is, however, that the book is red because someone gave it a red cover 
when he might just as well have made it green; whereas the wave cannot be other 
than it is because a wave is a dynamic system. It consists of flows of water, which 
are its parts, and the relations between those flows, which are governed by the natu-
ral laws of systems of water that are investigated by the science of hydrodynamics. 
The appearances of the wave, its shape and the happy white crest, are actually 
outputs of this system. They are what they are because the system is organized in 
the way that it is, and this organization produces an inescapable kind of behaviour. 
The cross-section of the wave is parabolic, having two basic forms, the one domi-
nating at the open-sea stage of the wave, and the other dominating later. As the 
second form is produced from the first, there is a moment when the wave holds the 
two forms: it has at this moment a wedge shape of 120°. And at this point, as the 
second form takes over, the wave begins to break – hence the happy white crest.
Now in terms of the dynamic system that we call a wave, the happy white crest 
is not at all the pretty sign by which what we first called an entity signalizes its 
Reading from Beer’s Work

200
existence. For the wave, that crest is its personal catastrophe. What has happened is 
that the wave has a systemic conflict within it determined by its form of organiza-
tion, and that this has produced a phase of instability. The happy white crest is the 
mark of doom upon the wave, because the instability feeds upon itself; and the cata-
strophic collapse of the wave is an inevitable output of the system.
I am asking “Did you know?” Not “did you know about theoretic hydrodynam-
ics?” but “did you know that a wave is a dynamic system in catastrophe, as a result 
of its internal organizational instability?” Of course, the reason for this exercise is 
to be ready to pose the same question about the social institutions we were discuss-
ing. If we perceive those as entities, the giant monoliths surrounding pygmy man, 
then we shall not be surprised to find the marks of bureaucracy upon them: sluggish 
and inaccurate response, and those other warning signs I mentioned earlier. That is 
what these entities are like, we tend to say – and sigh. But in fact these institutions 
are dynamic systems, having a particular organization which produces particular 
outputs. My contention is that they are typically moving into unstable phases, for 
which catastrophe is the inevitable outcome. And I believe the growing sense of 
unease I mentioned at the start derives from a public intuition that this is indeed the 
case. For people to understand this possibility, how it arises, what the dangers are, 
and above all what can be done about it, it is not necessary to master socio-political 
cybernetics. This is the science that stands to institutional behaviour as the science 
of hydrodynamics stands to the behaviour of waves. But it is necessary to train our-
selves simply to perceive what was there all the time: not a monolithic entity, but a 
dynamic system; not a happy white crest, but the warning of catastrophic instability.
So far we have spoken a little of the nature of dynamic systems; but the other 
qualification that I used at the start was the word ‘surviving’. The wave is not a 
surviving dynamic system, because its destruction is built into its organization. 
However we certainly regard our institutions as survival worthy. After all, they have 
survived until now, because they are capable of a trick we call adaptation, which 
waves are not. So why should there now be a fuss about instability and impending 
catastrophe?
Our institutions have already proven that they can survive, says the argument, 
and we can have confidence that they will continue to adapt successfully to change. 
Indeed, we insist that they must – for our institutions enshrine everything we hold 
most dear. Beginning with the family unit, based on love and mutual support; 
extending through the school – and perhaps that alma mater the university; bound 
together in the cohesion of the neighbourhood, the community, and the churches; 
ramifying into business and the growth of prosperity for all; exemplified, protected, 
and projected by the state; this – our society – is an entity that survives, albeit by 
adaptive change. And if this society embodied in its institutions is threatened by too 
rapid change, then the answer that many serious and concerned people give is to 
reinforce the rules of the societary game, strengthen the institutions, tighten up the 
criminal, social, and moral laws, and weather the storm. That is the conservative 
attitude. It is not mine. It is not going to work much longer.
Indeed, we ought to face the fact that this theory does not work now. People 
convince themselves that it does, because they see society as an entity, and its main 
19  Stafford Beer

201
characteristic is to be held most dear. Then they grit their teeth and declare that 
whatever is wrong with it must and can be put right again. Broken barriers, swept 
away by permissive morality, can be repaired. Departed children can be summoned 
home to eat the fatted calf. The majority of people, who do not attend a church, are 
still (surely to goodness?) fundamentally Christian. The starving two-thirds of the 
world will eventually be fed (well, not those two-thirds dying right now, but their 
descendants). And somehow a finite planet, with exhaustible resources, will be 
made indefinitely to support more and yet more growth. Oh no: this only even looks 
possible if we are dealing with a fixed entity, a society or a way of life that is held 
to enshrine eternal values, a golden ideal. If this has become rather tarnished, then 
it can be reburnished with a little elbow grease. So some people, and especially 
some politicians, seem to think.
But if society is a dynamic system all these phenomena are not simply blem-
ishes – they are its outputs. These unpleasing threats to all we hold most dear are 
products of a system so organized as to produce them – to produce them, and not 
their contraries. These are not accidental; and they are not mistakes. They are the 
continuing output of a systemic conflict which is due to specific modes of organiza-
tion. And those modes of organization have currently arrived at a stage in their 
inexorable pattern of behaviour which, like the wedge-shaped wave of 120°, is 
incipiently unstable – on the verge of catastrophic breakdown. Or so I think.
These dire predictions I am making have to come about, which is why I said they 
were inexorable, if – but only if – we continue to support modes of organization into 
which these outcomes are inbuilt. We do not have to do that. We really can change 
the whole thing. But to succeed, we must first perceive the nature of dynamic sur-
viving systems, and the conditions they must meet to remain stable yet adaptive.

Humberto Maturana
What is the nature of life? How do our cognitive processes relate to our perception 
of the world? These are big questions of both biology and philosophy, and answer-
ing them is the life-work of Humberto Romesín Maturana. His work has been mas-
sively influential in systems thinking, and has been applied to many other fields. It 
is deeply philosophical in its implications, but has a strong biological grounding. 
Although Maturana’s name is most closely associated with the theory of autopoiesis 
(self-producing systems), work that he carried out with his student and close col-
laborator Francisco Varela, his work is more general than the ideas of autopoiesis. It 
can best be summed up in the title of an early paper (reprinted in Maturana and 
Varela 1980) – the biology of cognition.
Maturana’s work is not easy. His writing style is complex, the ideas he describes 
are complex, and their implications are significant for our understanding of life and 
cognition. They have been described and applied by a number of other writers in 
systems thinking, but also in areas as diverse as law, sociology, family therapy, arti-
ficial intelligence, organisational theory and environmental change. John Mingers, 
who has written extensively on the theory of autopoiesis and its applications, argues 
“I believe that it will stand as an example, if not the example, of outstanding work 
in the field of systems per se. It is founded on genuine knowledge of the relevant 
domains – biology and neurophysiology – but this is molded within a strong sys-
tems perspective which supplies genuinely new insights” (Mingers 1995, p. 4).
Humberto Maturana was born in 1928 in Santiago de Chile, where he has lived 
and worked for most of his life. His parents separated when he was a small child, so 
he was brought up solely by his mother and was taught domestic tasks that at the 
time in Chile were considered only suitable for women (Garcia 2018). His initial 
degree from the University of Chile was in medicine (as it was not then possible to 
study biology, his preferred subject, at degree level in Chile). He spent a brief time 
in England in 1954, at University College London, and then moved to the United 
States. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in 1958, subsequently working at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He returned to the University of 
Chile in 1960, where he has remained since, running a research centre on the 

204
Biology of Knowledge. He was a visiting professor at the University of Illinois from 
1968–1969. He continues to be an active researcher, and is currently the codirector 
(with his long-time colleague Ximena Dávila Yáñez), of the Escuela Matríztica de 
Santiago, focusing on the “interplay of biology and culture on human living” 
(Dávila Yáñez and Maturana 2013, p. 76). Maturana has been married twice, first for 
20 years to Maruja with whom he had two children, in a marriage that ended in 
divorce; the second time for 35 years to Beatriz Genzsch, who died in 2013.
Maturana was present in Chile for the great political events of the early 1970s – 
the government of Salvador Allende and subsequent military coup and dictatorship. 
Following the 1973 coup, Maturana decided to remain in Chile during the period of 
the Pinochet dictatorship (unlike many academics who fled the country in fear of 
persecution), feeling a responsibility to stay and represent a democratic way of 
life – because he had not actively participated in the Allende government he himself 
was not at risk of persecution. He also sought to know what it meant to live under a 
dictator (in the way that his close colleague Heinz von Foerster had previously 
done), and to observe how it was possible in a dictatorship to “retain one’s own 
capabilities of vision and perception” (Maturana and Poerksen 2004, p. 168).
Maturana has been concerned with issues of life and cognition for the whole of 
his career. His inspiration for this work came while he was a medical student. He 
was seriously ill with tuberculosis and confined to a sanatorium with very little 
reading material, so was put in the position of reflecting upon his condition and the 
nature of life. While at the sanatorium, he “realized that what was peculiar to living 
systems was that they were discrete autonomous entities such that all the processes 
that they lived, they lived in reference to themselves … whether a dog bites me or 
doesn’t bite me, it is doing something that has to do with itself” (Maturana 2002, 
p. 6). This concept of autonomy and self-reference (an unusual perspective in bio-
logical sciences) has formed the foundation of his work ever since.
His first piece of experimental work to advance this concept was conducted at 
MIT, where he worked with Jerry Lettvin (one of the group inspired by Warren 
McCulloch), which resulted in the celebrated paper “What the frog’s eye tells the 
frog’s brain” (Lettvin et al. 1959). Studying the retinal cells of frogs, they discov-
ered that the information given from the frog’s eye does not describe the world as 
such, but only such aspects of the world as are relevant to the frog at a particular 
moment. In particular, the frog does not see flies (its foodstuff) but only patterns of 
moving shadows which enable it to catch flies. Applied to humans, this leads inexo-
rably to the conclusion that our understanding of the world is partial, that we take 
only from the world that information which we need at the time. The work was 
­carried out in the traditional scientific paradigm, but was widely regarded as highly 
important at the time. As Hayles (1999, p. 135) puts it, the article “blew a frog-sized 
hole in realist epistemology”. Moreover, Kline (2015, p. 196) argues that the article 
was the “starting point for second-order cybernetics”.
The further development of the theory of autopoiesis came as the 1960s pro-
gressed. In 1963, Maturana demonstrated the “circular closed dynamics of molecu-
lar productions that make living systems discrete autonomous molecular systems” 
(Maturana 2002, p. 7). In 1965, studying the colour vision of pigeons, he concluded 
20  Humberto Maturana

205
that it was not possible to view colours as objective external features of the world, 
but rather as internal experiences of the world – which for him meant that he had to 
abandon “the notion that there was an external independent world to be known by 
the observer” (Maturana 2002, p. 5).
In 1968, Maturana spent most of a year at the Biological Computing Laboratory 
at the University of Illinois, working closely with Heinz von Foerster with whom he 
became close friends and ‘play-mates’ (Maturana 2011b, p. 129). It was at the BCL 
that these ideas began to coalesce into a formal theory. The work Maturana pub-
lished there appeared under the title of “Biology of Cognition” (originally 1970, 
republished in Maturana and Varela 1980). Early in this paper can be found a phrase 
which has become emblematic for Maturana’s work: “anything said is said by an 
observer” (Maturana and Varela 1980, p. 8). This focus on the observer as a vital 
part of the system has been crucial both in Maturana’s work and more generally in 
second-order cybernetics. To be aware of the role of the observer (who for Maturana 
can only be a human being), and to identify them as a clear part of the system, is to 
deny the concept of objectivity. It transfers the focus of scientific study from the 
object being observed, which in the traditional realist paradigm is unchanging 
regardless of the observer, to the combination of object plus observer, which will 
necessarily change according to the observer.
In the article “Biology of Cognition”, Maturana outlined his theory of cognition 
based on the “self-referring circular organization of the living system” and of living 
systems which are “capable of making descriptions and of generating, through ori-
enting interactions with other, similar, systems and with itself, both a consensual 
linguistic domain and a domain of self-consciousness” (Maturana and Varela 1980, 
p. 48). At this stage, however, Maturana did not have a fully worked-out description 
of the processes involved, nor did he have a name for this phenomenon. It was when 
he returned to Chile, and was joined in his laboratory by his younger compatriot 
Francisco Varela that these ideas were formalised and given a name: the theory of 
autopoiesis.
The word ‘autopoiesis’ was coined by Maturana, and means ‘self-making’ or 
‘self-producing’. It refers to the phenomenon that Maturana had earlier identified – 
that living systems are “organised in such a way that their processes produce the 
very components necessary for the continuance of these processes” (Mingers 1995, 
p. 11). This circularity is crucial: the nature of the autopoietic system is that it main-
tains itself solely through its own activities. Autopoiesis, argues Maturana (2002, 
p. 8), is “the necessary and sufficient condition for the constitution of living sys-
tems”. Maturana and Varela initially applied this theory to the dynamics of cells, 
observing that the processes of the cell continually act to recreate the boundary of 
the cell (its membrane) that separates it from its environment, but it has been applied 
by them and others to other levels of living system (Mingers 1995; Capra 1996). 
Maturana coined the phrase in conversation with a philosopher, who mentioned an 
occasion in the novel Don Quixote which contrasts the path of praxis or action (spe-
cifically, the military life) with the path of poiesis or creation and ‘it occurred to me 
that I might create a new word, autopoiesis, as the correct expression to capture and

convey what I was connoting in talking of the circularity of the organization of the 
living’ (Maturana 2011a, p. 299).
The concept of autopoiesis brings with it several important implications. If an 
autopoietic system is self-producing and maintains its own boundary from the envi-
ronment, it may sound as if autopoiesis is only at work in closed systems. This is not 
so. Maturana and Varela distinguish between the organisation and the structure of 
systems. The former refers to the relationships between components which are nec-
essary to define that system as part of a particular class of systems; the latter to the 
particular physical form which those components take.
An autopoietic system (such as a cell) is one that can be considered as organisa-
tionally closed – it retains its organisation regardless of changes from its environ-
ment – but structurally open to the flow of energy and matter in and out of the 
system. Capra (1996, p. 167) argues that “this organizational closure implies that a 
living system is self-organizing in the sense that its order and behaviour are not 
imposed by the environment but are established by the system itself”.
Organisational closure is important because it is a criterion of life – for a living 
(autopoietic) system to remain alive it must retain its basic organisation. However 
there must be a process by which the living system relates to its environment, and in 
the theory of autopoiesis this is termed structural coupling. As changes occur in the 
system’s environment, the structure of the system changes to match the environ-
ment. This is different from the organism adapting to its environment, because “the 
environment does not specify the adaptive changes that will occur – they either will 
occur, and thus maintain autopoiesis, or they will not, and the system will disinte-
grate” (Mingers 1995, p. 35).
We have largely described autopoiesis so far as a physical phenomenon, applying 
to cells in the first instance and more generally to other living systems. This is the 
way that Maturana himself understands the theory – he clearly states that “autopoi-
esis occurs only in the physical domain” (Maturana 2002, p. 8). However, the theory 
has been very attractive to writers in a range of domains with an interest in circular, 
self-referential systems.
It is a controversial question whether it is legitimate to apply autopoiesis to social 
systems, in particular. The attempt has been made by a number of authors, but gen-
erally by extending the concept, regarding it as a metaphor, or by applying it to 
abstract ideas such as messages or communications (the approach taken by Niklas 
Luhmann, as discussed in the chapter on that author). The concept has been success-
fully applied to family systems therapy, however, as an extension of the work of 
Gregory Bateson.
While Maturana is resistant to the application of autopoiesis to social systems, 
his more general theories on cognition clearly apply to individual human beings and 
as a collection of human beings, to social systems. In particular, he has written at 
length of the importance of language. He has extended his celebrated remarks on the 
observer to note that “we human beings operate as observers, that is, we make dis-
tinctions in language” (Maturana 1988, p. 26). Language is crucial to our process of 
observing and interacting with the world – and it is an active process, one that 
20  Humberto Maturana

207
Maturana calls ‘languaging’. Indeed, Maturana refers to a “network of conversa-
tion” (Maturana 1988, p. 53) which form the dynamics of social systems.
In many ways, Maturana’s work is that of philosopher as much as biologist. He 
is very clear that he sees himself as a biologist, and that that is the foundation of his 
work. Nonetheless, his ideas have strong philosophical implications, with their 
focus on the nature of reality. Because of this background as a biologist, Maturana 
has chosen not to engage directly in philosophical debates, and few references to the 
philosophical literature can be found in his work. This makes it difficult to situate 
his ideas in philosophical traditions, a problem exacerbated by his writing style 
which he himself describes as inherently circular. Maturana describes an occasion 
where Heinz von Foerster and a colleague attempted to translate his paper ‘Biology 
of Cognition’ and removed what they saw as repetition, but in the process “trans-
formed all my circular sentences into linear sentences [and] destroyed my article” 
(Maturana 2011b, p. 132).
His work is often described as forming a foundation for the theory of constructiv-
ism (the idea that we do not observe the world as it is but rather mentally construct 
the world we inhabit through our observations and actions). This is given credence 
through statements such as “every act of knowing brings forth a world” (Maturana 
and Varela 1987, p. 26). However, Maturana is clear that he does not regard himself 
as a constructivist: “I do not consider myself a representative of constructivism, 
even if I am called a constructivist over and over again” (Maturana and Poerksen 
2004, p. 34).
Maturana’s view instead is of an active process by which we observe and con-
struct our way of making sense of the world: “our world, as the world which we 
bring forth in our coexistence with others, will always have that mixture of regular-
ity and mutability, that combination of solidity and shifting sand, so typical of 
human experience when we look at it up close” (Maturana and Varela 1987, p. 241). 
It is not appropriate, Maturana argues, to talk of an objective reality – we should 
look instead at what we do in observing and acting in the world.
This sense of active engagement in the world is crucial to Maturana’s work and 
his understanding of cognition and human life. As Bunnell (2004, p. 7) argues: 
“what Maturana has to offer this world is not another way of living in reality, nor the 
foundations of constructivism, nor a biological argument, but a whole world of 
awareness of the manner of our living which alters the manner of our living”.

How do I know when a being is living? What are my criteria? Throughout the 
history of biology many criteria have been proposed. They all have drawbacks. For 
instance, some have proposed as a criterion chemical composition, or the capacity 
to move, or reproduction, or even some combination of those criteria, that is, a list 
of properties. But how do we know when the list is complete? For instance, if we 
build a machine capable of reproducing itself, but it is made of iron and plastic and 
not of molecules, is it living?
We wish to give an answer to this question in a way radically different from the 
traditional listing of properties. This will simplify the problem tremendously. To 
understand this change in perspective, we have to be aware that merely asking the 
question of how to recognize a living being indicates that we have an idea, even if 
implicitly, of its organization. It is this idea that will determine whether we accept 
or reject the answer given to us. To prevent this implicit idea from entrapping and 
blinding us, we must be aware of it when we consider the answer that follows.
What is the makeup or organization of anything? It is both very simple and 
potentially complicated. ‘Organization’ signifies those relations that must be pres-
ent in order for something to exist. For me to judge that this object is a chair, I have 
to recognize a certain relationship between the parts I call legs, back, and seat, in 
such a way that sitting down is made possible. That it is made of wood and nails, or 
plastic and screws, has nothing at all to do with my classifying it as a chair.
This situation, in which we recognize implicitly or explicitly the organization of 
an object when we indicate it or distinguish it, is universal in the sense that it is 
something we do constantly as a basic cognitive act, which consists no more and no 
less than in generating classes of any type. Thus, the class of ‘chairs’ is defined by 
the relations required for me to classify something as a chair. The class of ‘good 
deeds’ is defined by the criteria that I establish and that must apply between the 
actions done and their consequences for considering them good.
It is easy to point to a certain organization by naming the objects that make up a 
class; however, it can be complex and hard to describe exactly and explicitly the 
relations that make up that organization. Thus, as regards ‘chairs’ as a class, it may 
be easy to describe the organization of a ‘chair’; however, it is not so with the class 
of ‘good deeds’, unless there is a considerable amount of cultural agreement.
When we speak of living beings, we presuppose something in common between 
them; otherwise we wouldn’t put them in the same class we designate with the name 
‘living’. What has not been said, however, is: what is that organization that defines 
them as a class? Our proposition is that living beings are characterized in that, liter-
ally, they are continually self-producing. We indicate this process when we call the 
organization that defines them an autopoietic organization. Basically, this organiza-
tion comes from certain relations that we shall outline and view more easily on the 
cellular level.
First, the molecular components of a cellular autopoietic unity must be dynami-
cally related in a network of ongoing interactions. Today we know many of the 
specific chemical transformations in this network, and the biochemist collectively 
terms them ‘cell metabolism’.
20  Humberto Maturana

209
Now, what is distinctive about this cellular dynamics compared with any other 
collection of molecular transformations in natural processes? Interestingly, this cell 
metabolism produces components which make up the network of transformations 
that produced them. Some of these components form a boundary, a limit to this 
network of transformations. In morphologic terms, the structure that makes this 
cleavage in space possible is called a membrane. Now, this membranous boundary 
is not a product of cell metabolism in the way that fabric is the product of a fabric-­
making machine. The reason is that this membrane not only limits the extension of 
the transformation network that produced its own components but it participates in 
this network. If it did not have this spatial arrangement, cell metabolism would dis-
integrate in a molecular mess that would spread out all over and would not consti-
tute a discrete unity such as a cell.
What we have, then, is a unique situation as regards relations of chemical trans-
formations: on the one hand, we see a network of dynamic transformations that 
produces its own components and that is essential for a boundary; on the other hand, 
we see a boundary that is essential for the operation of the network of transforma-
tions which produced it as a unity (Fig. 20.1).
Note that these are not sequential processes, but two different aspects of a unitary 
phenomenon. It is not that first there is a boundary, then a dynamics, then a bound-
ary, and so forth. We are describing a type of phenomenon in which the possibility 
of distinguishing one thing from a whole (something you can see under the micro-
scope, for instance) depends on the integrity of the processes that make it possible. 
Interrupt (at some point) the cellular metabolic network and you will find that after 
a while you don’t have any more unity to talk about! The most striking feature of an 
autopoietic system is that it pulls itself up by its own bootstraps and becomes dis-
tinct from its environment through its own dynamics, in such a way that both things 
are inseparable.
Living beings are characterized by their autopoietic organization. They differ 
from each other in their structure, but they are alike in their organization.
Autonomy and Autopoiesis
By realizing what characterizes living beings in their autopoietic organization, we 
can unify a whole lot of empirical data about their biochemistry and cellular func-
tioning. The concept of autopoiesis, therefore, does not contradict these data. Rather, 
it is supported by them; it explicitly proposes that such data be interpreted from a 
specific point of view which stresses that living beings are autonomous unities.

boundary in relation

We use the word ‘autonomy’ in its current sense; that is, a system is autonomous 
if it can specify its own laws, what is proper to it. We are not proposing that living 
beings are the only autonomous entities. Certainly they are not. But one of the most 
evident features of a living being is its autonomy. We are proposing that the mecha-
nism that makes living beings autonomous systems is autopoiesis. This character-
izes them as autonomous systems.
The question about autonomy is as old as the question about the living. It is only 
contemporary biologists who feel uncomfortable over the question of how to under-
stand the autonomy of the living. From our standpoint, however, this question is a 
guideline to understanding the autonomy of living beings: to understand them, we 
must understand the organization that defines them as unities. Being aware that liv-
ing beings are autonomous unities helps to show how their autonomy – usually seen 
as mysterious and elusive – becomes explicit, for we realize that what defines them 
as unities is their autopoietic organization, and it is in this autopoietic organization 
that they become real and specify themselves at the same time.
Our intention, therefore, is to proceed scientifically: if we cannot provide a list 
that characterizes a living being, why not propose a system that generates all the 
phenomena proper to a living being? The evidence that an autopoietic unit has 
exactly all these features becomes evident in the light of what we know about the 
interdependence between metabolism and cellular structure.
That living beings have an organization, of course, is proper not only to them but 
also to everything we can analyze as a system. What is distinctive about them, how-
ever, is that their organization is such that their only product is themselves, with no 
separation between producer and product. The being and doing of an autopoietic 
unity are inseparable, and this is their specific mode of organization.
Like any organization, autopoietic organization can be attained by many differ-
ent types of components. We have to realize, however, that as regards the molecular 
origin of terrestrial living beings, only certain molecular species probably possessed 
the characteristics required for autopoietic unities, thus initiating the structural his-
tory to which we ourselves belong. For instance, it was necessary to have molecules 
capable of forming membranes sufficiently stable and plastic to be, in turn, effective 
barriers, and to have changing properties for the diffusion of molecules and ions 
over long periods of time with respect to molecular speeds. Molecules from silicon 
layers, for instance, are too rigid for them to participate in dynamic unities (cells) in 
an ongoing and fast molecular interchange with the medium.
It was only at that point in the Earth’s history when conditions were right for the 
forming of organic molecules such as proteins, which have enormous complexity 
and pliancy, that conditions were right also for the forming of autopoietic unities. In 
fact, we can assume that when all these sufficient conditions were present in the 
Earth’s history, autopoietic systems formed inevitably.
That moment is the point we can refer to as the moment when life began. This 
does not mean that it happened in one instance and in one place only; nor can we 
specify a date for it. All the available evidence leads us to believe that once condi-
tions were ripe for the origin of living systems, they originated many times; that is, 
20  Humberto Maturana

211
many autopoietic unities with many structural variants emerged in many places on 
the Earth over a period of perhaps many millions of years.
The emergence of autopoietic unities on the face of the Earth is a landmark in the 
history of our solar system. We have to understand this well. The formation of a 
unity always determines a number of phenomena associated with the features that 
define it; we may thus say that each class of unities specific a particular phenome-
nology. Thus, autopoietic unities specify biology phenomenology as the phenome-
nology proper of those unities with features distinct from physical phenomenology. 
This is so, not because autopoietic unities go against any aspect of physical phe-
nomenology – since their molecular components must fulfill all physical laws – but 
because the phenomena they generate in functioning as autopoietic unities depend 
on their organization and the way this organization come about, and not on the 
physical nature of their components (which only determine their space of existence).
Thus, if a cell interacts with molecule X and incorporates it in its processes, what 
takes place as a result of this interaction is determined not by the properties of mol-
ecule X but by the way in which that molecule is ‘seen’ or taken by the cell as it 
incorporates the molecule in its autopoietic dynamics. The changes that occur 
therein as a result of this interaction will be those changes caused by the cell’s own 
structure as a unity. Therefore, inasmuch as the autopoietic organization causes bio-
logical phenomenology by bringing about living beings as autonomous unities, a 
biological phenomenon will be any phenomenon that involves the autopoiesis of at 
least one living being.

Chapter 21
Niklas Luhmann
Niklas Luhmann was a theoretical sociologist, who built a unified theory of society 
based on systems theory. He particularly drew upon the tools of second-order cyber-
netics, notably the theory of autopoiesis. He was extremely prolific, publishing over 
50 books and several hundred articles, ranging across many areas of social theory 
with an exceptional combination of both breadth and depth. His research pro-
gramme, as stated when he took up his professorship in 1969, was “the theory of 
society; term: thirty years; costs: none” (Luhmann 2012, p. xi). As he died in 1998, 
having published a theory of modern society the previous year, he achieved this 
programme almost precisely.
Luhmann was born in 1927 in Lüneburg, northern Germany. His initial education 
was in law (at Freiburg in 1949), following which he became a lawyer and then a 
civil servant. His work allowed him plenty of time for intellectual reading, and 
eventually led him in 1960 to take a year-long sabbatical at Harvard University 
where he worked with the American sociologist Talcott Parsons. On returning to 
Germany, Luhmann moved into an academic career, holding several positions 
before being appointed as professor of sociology at the newly-formed University of 
Bielefeld, where he remained until his retirement in 1993 and (as an emeritus pro-
fessor) until his death in 1998. He was married to Ursula von Walter from 1960 until 
her death in 1977; they had three children.
An obituary by a colleague summarised key aspects of his personality 
(Hornung 1999):
He was a sharp observer of minute differences. No wonder he embraced the theory of the 
organization of the living of Maturana and Varela, in which the concept of the observer 
plays a key role. Combined with his precise and complex reasoning trained in legal science 
he further developed this theory and transferred it to sociology, where it became soon a 
cornerstone of his own monumental construction of theory. … But beyond being a great 
theorist, he was a great person. He had a lot of patience, towards his topics of study as well 
as towards his students and friends. Many friends and colleagues appreciated and enjoyed 
his sense of humour and his contagious smile.

214
Luhmann’s work is highly regarded in German social science, and continues to 
be widely read and cited today. On his death, a large number of obituaries were 
published in mainland European newspapers and magazines, describing him as “the 
most important social theorist of the 20th century” (Bechmann and Stehr 2002, 
p. 67). Yet in English-speaking countries his work is not nearly as well known. This 
is complicated by language. His two most important books were published in 
German in 1984 and 1997. One took 10 years to appear in English (Soziale Systeme, 
translated as Social Systems, Luhmann 1995); the other, widely described as 
Luhmann’s greatest work and the culmination of his efforts to produce a theory of 
society, took 15 years (Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft, translated as Theory of 
Society – Luhmann 2012, 2013).
However, even without the issue of language, his work is highly complex. In the 
introduction to the English translation of Social Systems, he himself acknowledges 
that “the theory’s design resembles a labyrinth more than a freeway off into the 
sunset” (Luhmann 1995, p. lii). Part of the reason for this labyrinthine structure was 
the way his theory developed, on a very large collection of cross-referenced file-­
cards (his Zettelkasten). Luhmann said that he “spent more time arranging and rear-
ranging his system of file cards than writing books” (Vandenberghe 1999, p. 54), 
and the non-linear, hypertextual, nature of this way of working can be seen in his 
ideas, where one flows into another with few breaks.
A scholar of Luhmann’s work, Hans-Georg Moeller, who regards the ideas as 
extremely important, nonetheless describes his writing as “extremely dry, unneces-
sarily convoluted, poorly structured, highly repetitive, overly long, and aesthetically 
unpleasing” (Moeller 2012, p. 10). He suggests that this is partly due to the circular 
writing style that arises from the use of the Zettelkasten, but also because German 
academia prizes difficulty of writing style and he wanted his theory to be taken seri-
ously. Moeller also argues that Luhmann’s ideas were sufficiently radical that within 
the ideologically cautious German academic culture of the time, “he needed to con-
ceal them within the awkward Trojan horse of a largely unassuming and inaccessi-
ble language” (Moeller 2012, p. 4).
Luhmann’s body of work divided into two distinct phases, separated by the pub-
lication of Soziale Systeme in 1984. Prior to this book, his major influence within 
systems theory came from Parsons’ work (although in a modified form). After this 
publication, while he still used Parsons’ ideas, he was much more strongly influ-
enced by autopoiesis and other concepts connected with second-order cybernetics, 
especially the work of the logician George Spencer Brown (1969) on the concept of 
distinction. For reasons of space and its difficulty, we will not discuss Luhmann’s 
use of distinction here. It is well summarised by Seidl and Becker (2006).
In this discussion, we shall largely focus on the post-1984 Luhmann (and espe-
cially his use of autopoiesis). He regarded the earlier work as simply a starting point 
for these later developments, seeing Soziale Systeme as his first “real publication, 
whereas the previous would merely constitute a ‘zero-series of theory production’” 
(Moeller 2012, p.  124). Nonetheless, it is worth briefly mentioning his use of 
Parsons’ ideas. Talcott Parsons, an American, was the first sociologist to make sys-
tems theory the centre of his work, with his structural-functionalism. While very

influential in the 1950s and early 1960s, Parsons’ theory was later widely rejected 
by sociologists for its lack of account of individual choice and its conservatism. 
Luhmann retained the concept of function – the division of society into a number of 
subsystems with different purposes – but replaced Parsons’ focus on the conserva-
tion of the structure of society with a focus on the conservation of the relationships 
within society. While some sociologists still see Luhmann’s work as tainted with the 
technocratic notion of system found in Parsons, for many others Luhmann has reha-
bilitated systems thinking within sociology.
Luhmann drew on the long Germanic tradition of sociology and social philoso-
phy from Kant onwards. In particular, the work of the phenomenologist Edmund 
Husserl was crucial to Luhmann’s work, especially the centrality he placed on the 
concept of meaning – our understanding and interpretation of ideas. For Luhmann, 
meaning was the “basic concept” of sociology (Luhmann 1990, p. 21) and indeed of 
the social sciences and humanities more generally. Strikingly, however, he argued 
that meaning applies to social systems as well as to individual human beings, as 
distinct from most social theorists who would argue that only individuals can pos-
sess meaning.
This feature of ‘meaning’ is important given a further key, and controversial, 
feature of Luhmann’s theory. As with many systems thinkers, he makes a clear dis-
tinction between different types of systems, and in particular distinguishes four 
types  – machines, organisms, social systems and psychic systems. (The last of 
these, with its slightly odd sound to the English-speaking reader, refers to the indi-
vidual human being as a system, as understood through their mind – their ‘psyche’.) 
Social and psychic systems, while highly interdependent, are separate and nonover-
lapping – each sits in the environment of the other. As Luhmann (1995, p. 59) put it, 
“persons cannot emerge and continue to exist without social systems, nor can social 
systems exist without persons”. Nonetheless, it is crucial that they are treated as 
different, and that individuals are not seen as a constituent part of social systems. 
Luhmann strongly denied that this was an anti-humanist step, but along with his use 
of Parsons’ theories it has led to some of the criticisms of his work.
When Luhmann began to use autopoiesis in his work, Luhmann’s approach was 
not crudely to apply autopoiesis (in Maturana and Varela’s original, biological, 
form) to social systems but rather first of all to abstract the concept of autopoiesis 
away from the biological realm and then to apply this abstracted concept to social 
systems. Luhmann argued that living systems are only one form of autopoietic sys-
tem; others include social and psychic systems. In each case the basic element of the 
system – that which it continually reproduces to preserve its fundamental organiza-
tion (the key criterion for autopoiesis) – will vary. For psychic systems, Luhmann 
argues, this will be thought; for social systems, it will be communication. That is, 
Luhmann treats communication as the fundamental aspect of any kind of social 
system. He described communication as the operation that “produces and repro-
duces this system [society] whenever it occurs … society cannot be conceived of 
without communication, nor can communication be conceived of without society” 
(Luhmann 2012, p. xiii).
21  Niklas Luhmann

216
Communication is an unusual basis for a theory of society, and indeed the only 
other major social theorist to have used it is Jürgen Habermas (whose debates with 
Luhmann we will discuss later), although it is the basis of the work of two of the 
thinkers in this book, Gregory Bateson and Paul Watzlawick. It fits with two of 
Luhmann’s concerns – the importance of meaning (which any communication both 
creates and is sustained by), and the recasting of Parsons’ work away from structure 
and towards relationship. Any social system, Luhmann argues, exists to communi-
cate and maintains its existence by communicating – when it ceases to communicate 
it ceases to exist.
In the classical use of the term (that of Claude Shannon), communication refers 
to the process by which a sender transfers information to a receiver. Luhmann 
instead used a definition involving three parts: the information (the ‘what’, the con-
tent of the message), the utterance (the ‘how’ and ‘why’ – the manner in which it is 
sent and the intention behind the message), and the understanding (the meaning 
attributed to it by the receiver). These three parts cannot be separated, and all three 
must be present for a communication to be said to be occurring.
Luhmann’s definition of communication does not include either the sender or the 
receiver as elements of the communication, although it presupposes the existence of 
such individuals. Indeed, because both the intention behind the message and the 
meaning that is understood by the receiver are parts of the communication, more 
than one individual must be involved in a communication. As Seidl and Becker 
(2006, p. 19) argue, drawing upon Luhmann (2012) in its German original, “com-
munication constitutes an emergent property of the interaction between many (at 
least two) psychic systems”.
Luhmann had a number of critics, within both sociology and systems thinking. 
His most prominent opponent in sociology was Jürgen Habermas, the key advocate 
of critical social theory from the late 1960s onwards. Habermas and Luhmann had 
much in common – similar in age, both highly theoretical, both deeply embedded in 
the German tradition of sociology with its strong links to two centuries of philoso-
phy. Their initial disagreement arose from Habermas’ suspicion that the use of sys-
tems concepts would entail a technocratic form of social engineering, as reflected in 
the title of their initial volume of debates (never translated into English), “Theory of 
Society or Social Technology?” (Habermas and Luhmann 1971).
There was also a political element to their debates – Habermas’ critical theory 
was clearly left-wing, while Luhmann’s work, argues Arnoldi (2001, p. 2) was “very 
far from being critical theory. It is often described as dispassionate or neutral, and at 
times tends towards the conservative”. This was partly related to the conservatism 
that we have already discussed in Parsons’ ideas but also from Luhmann’s own 
stance on the maintenance of society. Luhmann was not part of the political right 
either, however, and became increasingly interested in environmental issues: his 
work on ecological communication (Luhmann 1989) had a big influence on the 
Green Party in Germany, and as Alexander and Blum (2016) argue, Luhmann’s 
work is deeply relevant to modern debates around sustainability.
The debates between Luhmann and Habermas had a strong influence on the 
thinking of both. Habermas shifted his position to incorporate some aspects of sys-
21  Niklas Luhmann

217
tems theory in the second volume of his greatest work (Habermas 1987). For 
Luhmann’s part, the Parsonian view of systems theory reflected in their debates was 
already one that Luhmann was moving away from, and the dialogue with Habermas 
helped him to move further, until he reached the stance reflected in Social Systems. 
Given Habermas’ fame, especially in the English-speaking academic world, the 
debates also brought Luhmann to the attention of a wider public.
Luhmann’s use, and adaptation, of autopoiesis has also brought criticism from 
within the systems community. Humberto Maturana once said to Luhmann, “thank 
you for having made me famous in Germany … but I disagree with the way in 
which you are using my ideas” (Maturana and Poerksen 2004, p. 106). Specifically, 
he disagreed with Luhmann’s use of communication as a central concept and his 
treatment of the psychic system as separate from the social system, arguing that 
“autopoiesis takes place in a domain in which the interactions of the elements con-
stituting it bring forth elements of the same kind … communications, however, 
presuppose human beings that communicate” (Maturana and Poerksen 2004, 
p.  107). Luhmann’s partial reply to this was that communication “is genuinely 
social in that, although it presupposes a multiplicity of participating consciousness 
systems, it cannot (for this very reason) be attributed to any individual conscious-
ness” (Luhmann 2012, p. 42).
It is clear from the above criticisms that Luhmann’s work was somewhat contro-
versial in places, and that his project to create a complete theory of society based on 
systems concepts was not seen as successful by everyone. His work was theoretical, 
difficult, and deeply original. Nonetheless, he reached further in the field of social 
systems than any thinker before him, and left a set of highly important ideas for 
understanding society. Referring to Luhmann’s 30 year research programme with 
which this chapter begins, Khan (2014, pp. 50–51) observes:
Ambitious and immodest, nonetheless this is what Luhmann sought. His writings gradually 
built such a theory, with books on law, art, love, mass-media, distinction, education, ecol-
ogy, risk, and countless other topics that have not been translated into English … Theory of 
Society [Luhmann 2012] is proof that Luhmann’s answer [in 1969] was not arrogant bluster, 
but the project of a dedicated unique mind.

I have used recent developments in systems theory, particularly those ideas asso-
ciated with how a system produces and reproduces itself in order to achieve an 
understanding of society. A system does not have an own essence; it should not be 
treated as an object exhibiting its own peculiar characteristics. Rather, it should be 
seen as something which, through its own operations, produces and reproduces a

difference between the system and an environment. It continues to produce this dif-
ference by using the distinction itself, which allows it to distinguish what is internal 
to the system and what is external. By using this approach it is possible to rewrite 
the theory of evolution by explaining those systems that emerge and, in the course 
of achieving this, are able to maintain themselves successfully. One such system is 
life itself. The biochemistry of life can reproduce life within a living cell or within 
a living organism, using its own components to produce continually those compo-
nents and constitute in the space where they exist the boundaries of the system. Life 
is indeed a good example. The biochemistry of life forms the operation which makes 
a difference between an organism and its environment.
With this theoretical structure in place, the nagging question becomes ‘Are we 
able to find a similar type of operation which produces a social system?’ It is my 
opinion that only communication can be considered as a serious candidate account-
ing for the production and reproduction of social systems. We cannot rely on the 
concept of action because this depends too much on the process of attribution and 
constantly sees the individual as a determinant actor. Communication, on the other 
hand, is inherently social and thus it follows that society is composed of communi-
cations among human beings.
We can define society as the all-encompassing social system that orders all pos-
sible communications. This necessitates that we must exclude everything but com-
munications from our concept of society. This means the exclusion not only of such 
natural facts as islands, oceans, and technologies, etc., but also of human beings, 
i.e., concrete individuals and their conscious processes. These aspects all belong to 
the environment of the social system of society. They must remain aspects of the 
environment; otherwise we could not formulate communication as the fundamental 
social operation which accounts for the production and reproduction of society. If 
we are going to analyze the environmental relations of the system of society, we 
cannot include psychical processes and individual conscious activities as definitive 
parts of society. Nor is this particularly necessary since communication can take 
place without us knowing what is happening in the minds of those with whom we 
choose to communicate.
Social systems use communications by highly selective processes. With the use 
of communications, we can question and answer, understand and misunderstand. 
Again, this type of thinking has links with research in neurophysiology and research 
concerning the biochemistry of cells. If we consider the concept of operational clo-
sure which has been explained in cognitive theory, we can appreciate that opera-
tional closure is an achievement of system building. This is not to say that operational 
closure allows us to isolate a system so as to study it and generalize about its regu-
larities through the observation of its inputs and outputs. We might have cause to 
attribute many different regularities and causal relations, but only the system itself 
can produce its own operations. The system is sovereign with respect to the con-
struction of identities and differences.
My next step in this argument requires a decisive conceptual innovation because 
we have to ask, ‘How under the conditions described above can we think about the 
relationship between a system and an environment?’ There is a concept in the writ-
21  Niklas Luhmann

219
ings of Humberto Maturana (1982) which allows us to appreciate the relationship 
between a system and its environment. It is the very technical concept of structural 
coupling. It is vital because it can explain how organisms are able to survive given 
the physical conditions imposed by the earth. For instance, if temperatures were 
slightly different, or if the planet was either very large or very small, then we could 
not survive. This way of thinking should not imply that our movement is determined 
by physical forces in a deterministic way. Certainly, we can decide where to go so 
long as it satisfies the condition of structural coupling. And it follows that if we 
drastically change the nature of this structural coupling, then we might endanger 
ourselves to the point where we are unable to survive. This is roughly what 
Maturana’s work tells us, and I would like to add the important dimension that 
structural couplings are highly selective, including but also excluding influences of 
the environment on the system.
If this type of thinking is applied to ideas about communication, it prompts the 
question – What are the structural couplings of communication? We have already 
argued to the effect that psychical and conscious activity is not part of the social 
system. This allows us to reformulate a theory of society in terms that dictate that 
the processes of societal communication depend upon structural coupling with con-
sciousness. To reiterate, consciousness is not part of the system; it is an essential 
environmental condition. We can certainly acknowledge that conscious activity 
operates in all communications, but it does not determine communication – it can 
only irritate communication processes.
Normally we think that conscious activity tells us what to say and what not to 
say, but the theory I am proposing here suggests that communication itself decides 
what can be communicated. The human conscious aspect exists to irritate or to 
make problems for the system. It forces the system to adapt or preadapt to potential 
irritations. For instance, I have to adapt my argument to the possibilities of it being 
understood. There may indeed be difficulties in being understood, but the system 
somehow arranges itself in view of these irritations provoked by consciousness. It is 
difficult to assume that a human can communicate as an actor; for example, you 
might consider that the way in which I am now communicating to the reader would 
definitively make me the communicating subject. But to explain the process of com-
munication in this way is unsatisfactory. It makes use of a rather artificial and causal 
assumption, adjudging me as the communicating actor. This is difficult because the 
recipient of communication knows nothing of my personality and can tell little of 
what I am actually thinking. Nevertheless, we can continue to communicate, and 
during 
this 
process 
we 
will 
inevitably 
produce 
understandings 
and 
misunderstandings.
So far there are two important aspects to this evolving theory. First, I mentioned 
that structural coupling can explain why consciousness can irritate but not deter-
mine communication processes. And second, because we know that communication 
is structurally coupled with consciousness, this tells us something about selectivity. 
It suggests that there is a vast environment which has no access to communicative 
processes. In fact there are only two accessible routes by which communication can 
be accessed or ‘changed’. One, of course, is through the idea of irritation; the other

is destructive of possible communications. For instance, we can spill ink on a manu-
script, but this does not create any new text; it just makes existing text illegible. 
Similarly our libraries might be burned down but in the ashes we do not find any 
new messages. It seems that there is a great deal that can destroy communication 
processes, though we still have recourse to the irritation of such processes via struc-
tural couplings with consciousness.
With this theory in place, we can see how society might possibly react to such 
areas of concern as ecological problems. I have explained how society organizes 
and restricts itself to particular communications. Individuals have the opportunity to 
irritate these societal communications, but bearing in mind that the population of 
the planet amounts to some five billion people, we need to understand something of 
the content of these communications and who actually communicates them. 
Evidently it is a question of how an individual can communicate the communica-
tions that he or she sees. At this juncture I will elaborate a little more on the notion 
of structural coupling and the implications of operational closure.
Consciousness can be said to be coupled tightly to the brain. The brain constantly 
requires living cells, and these in turn require a working organism to continue, and 
so the organism is structurally coupled with its environment, and so on. The point is 
that these relationships are highly selective and are the result of evolution. In point 
of fact, the relationships between systems and their environments are much more 
complex and much more artificial or improbable. This is of course a long way from 
the conventional idea that human beings can get together and talk about action and 
then reflect on the quality of this action.

Paul Watzlawick
Paul Watzlawick made significant advances in applying a systems approach in a 
number of related fields: family therapy, communications theory, and change man-
agement. His ideas were firmly rooted both in theory and in practical experience, 
especially as a psychotherapist. His many writings included several books which 
are highly engaging and easily read. A colleague summed up his work and personal-
ity as follows (Ray 2007, p. 416):
Through his writings and countless teaching seminars, this gentle man brought a clear and 
unequivocal message about the relational and contextual nature of human behaviour. 
Articulate and charming with old-school bearing, this brilliant yet unassuming man was the 
ideal ambassador to the world for the interactional view pioneered by the Palo Alto Group.
Watzlawick was born in 1921 in Villach, Austria, studying philosophy and mod-
ern languages at the University of Venice, where he gained his Ph.D. in 1949. He 
then moved to Zürich where he studied psychotherapy at the C.G. Jung Institute and 
subsequently worked as a therapist. From 1957 to 1960 he taught psychotherapy 
and psychiatry at the University of El Salvador and at Temple University in 
Philadelphia. In 1960, he met Don Jackson, who had founded the Mental Research 
Institute (MRI) in Palo Alto, California in the previous year, and Watzlawick moved 
to work at MRI, where most of his major ideas developed. He continued to work 
with MRI until shortly before his death. From 1967, he was also professor of psy-
chiatry (later emeritus) at Stanford University. Watzlawick died in 2007 in Palo 
Alto. Ray (2007, p. 415) describes that:
On the evening of his death, after a dinner with his wife Vera, drinking a glass of wine and 
eating his favorite Linzer Torte, he declared ti amo to Vera, thanking her once more for her 
affection and patience with him. And after talking intimately, laughing and joking about 
something they were watching on TV, he died suddenly of cardiac arrest.
The Mental Research Institute was formed as an offshoot of the projects led by 
Gregory Bateson on human communication and schizophrenia. Many of the key 
staff from Bateson’s projects were involved in the forming of MRI – Don Jackson, 

224
its founder, had been Bateson’s clinical consultant. Bateson played no formal part in 
MRI, although his ideas were foundational to its work.
The work of the MRI on family therapy, with a very strong systemic orientation, 
was to become extremely important in the field, and is often referred to as the stra-
tegic school (or simply the Palo Alto school) of family therapy. The term strategic 
refers to “any therapy in which the clinician actively designs interventions to fit the 
problem” (Hoffman 1981, p. 271). Those working at MRI approached this form of 
therapy with the tools of cybernetics, especially in the forms discussed by Bateson, 
such as information, communication, feedback and homeostasis. As Wilder (1979, 
pp. 172–173) notes, contrasting the approach with the individualistic perspective of 
Freudian psychoanalysis, “the focus of [MRI’s] model is interactional, i.e. it consid-
ers the individual within the nexus of his or her most important relationships, most 
typically the interactional system of the family”.
It is important to note that while Watzlawick was one of the key members of 
MRI, he was by no means its only important member. Other staff of MRI who made 
an important contribution to family therapy, communications theory and psycho-
therapy in general included Richard Fisch, Jay Haley, Virginia Satir, Janet Beavin 
Bavelas and John Weakland, as well as Don Jackson. Watzlawick has made many 
important contributions, but it would be misleading to suggest that he is the sole 
originator of some of the ideas we will discuss on family therapy. The importance 
of the MRI was not apparent at first – as Janet Bavelas comments, “MRI was really 
marginal. When people do this kind of historical interview, where I serve as their 
historical artefact, they always think it was really important, as important as it 
became and is now – but we were really, really off the beaten track” (interviewed by 
McKergow 2013, p. 95).
Family therapy is also a wider movement than the work of the MRI. Many thera-
pists have had the idea that if they are to understand and improve an individual’s 
psychological problems, then they need to investigate that individual’s key relation-
ships, especially their family. This concept crystallised into a movement in the 
1960s in the United States, and from its start has been tied up with the use of sys-
tems ideas. In particular, the family is treated as an open system (Jones 1993), with 
the characteristics of wholeness (interdependence between family members), non-­
summativity (that the whole is great than the sum of the parts), feedback (behaviour 
from members of a family feeding into future behaviour of the family) and equifi-
nality (where the same endpoints can be reached from many different starting 
points).
Two major schools of family therapy that are frequently identified in addition to 
the strategic school of MRI are the structural school and the Milan school. We will 
discuss the Milan school below, as it has interesting similarities and differences to 
Watzlawick’s approach. The structural school, associated with the therapist Salvador 
Minuchin of Philadelphia, considers the structure of the family as a system (its 
boundaries, key subsystems and hierarchies) and looks for weaknesses in that struc-
ture. There are also many approaches associated with individual therapists and their 
immediate colleagues which we will not consider here.
22  Paul Watzlawick

225
Returning to Watzlawick’s own work, it can be summed up in three themes, each 
associated with some of his major publications (often co-authored) – human com-
munication, change management and brief therapy, and constructivism.
His work on communication theory, summarised in the book Pragmatics of 
Human Communication (Watzlawick et al. 1967), was ground-breaking and widely 
read. It presents an approach to the understanding of human communication, derived 
explicitly from Bateson’s work (and thus cybernetics) but also with a strongly thera-
peutic background. It emphasises the importance of ‘metacommunication’, our 
communication about communication  – that all human communications have 
aspects of relationship built into them as well as the ostensible message we are con-
veying. Thus “one cannot not communicate” (Watzlawick et al. 1967, p. 51) as all 
human interaction, even ignoring someone, sends a message to other people.
Watzlawick and his co-authors argued that family interactions are ongoing open 
systems; this resembles the definitions of Jones (1993) discussed above but with a 
stronger emphasis on the role of feedback and of homeostasis (the goal of maintain-
ing the system in a steady state). They also emphasised the importance of paradox – 
putting an individual in a state where they are required to simultaneously believe in 
two or more mutually contradictory items of information, at different levels, and to 
act accordingly. A clear example of a paradox is the injunction to ‘Be Spontaneous!’ 
which if obeyed explicitly invalidates itself (as to obey would not be a spontaneous 
act) – see the reading below from Watzlawick’s work. Paradox is considered, in the 
MRI approach, to be the source of much that is harmful in the dynamics of family 
systems. Identifying and ‘solving’ paradoxes is one of Watzlawick’s key themes 
across a number of his works, although in Pragmatics of Human Communication 
and later work he emphasises that paradox can also be used by the therapist as a 
form of intervention.
The Palo Alto group were not seeking simply to discuss communication in situ-
ations where it was not working, but rather to discuss communication is general. As 
Wilder (1979, p. 171) notes, “the emphasis on pathologies serves primarily to gain 
an understanding of the process by focusing upon the extremes”. It is also striking 
that, while the work of Pragmatics of Human Communication draws quite explicitly 
on Bateson, and credits him on many occasions, it was not at all to Bateson’s liking. 
This was partly because the book was published before Bateson had published simi-
lar ideas and it went on to become a standard text in communication theory. However 
it took a more limited view of communication than him, as Catt (2014, p. 213) 
recounts:
Bateson was particularly upset to see communication narrowly defined as the pragmatic 
level of discourse, excluding his careful work to include the syntactics and semantics of 
discourse that inhere in every human gesture. Though they expanded the application of 
communication concepts, Watzlawick and his comrades reified the unfortunate and lasting 
impression that communication is an instrument, a mere tool.
The second major theme of Watzlawick’s work concerned change and how to 
handle it effectively. This work arose in the context of brief therapy, the idea of 
creating short (a small number of sessions) but effective psychotherapeutic inter-
22  Paul Watzlawick

ventions. Brief therapy was pioneered at MRI by Richard Fisch, one of Watzlawick’s 
co-­authors on the book Change: principles of problem formation and problem reso-
lution (Watzlawick et al. 1974) which first reported and extended lessons learnt 
from brief therapy that apply to a wide range of change situations.
Drawing on Russell and Whitehead’s theory of logical types (as did Bateson for 
his work on levels of learning), Watzlawick et al. distinguish between two types of 
change: “one that occurs within a given system which itself remains unchanged, and 
one whose occurrence changes the system itself” (Watzlawick et al. 1974, p. 10). 
They refer to these two types as first- and second-order change. There is also a clear 
parallel with Ashby’s two types of feedback loops, which formed the basis for the 
work of Argyris and Schön on double-loop learning, and Watzlawick et al. briefly 
discuss links to Ashby’s work.
For Watzlawick et al., second-order change is much more important in therapeu-
tic situations. They argue that it “is applied to what in the first-order change perspec-
tive appears to be a solution, because in the second-order perspective this ‘solution’ 
reveals itself as the keystone of the problem whose solution is attempted” 
(Watzlawick et al. 1974, p. 82). However, second-order change can only occur from 
a perspective outside the system (as it changes the rules of the system) and it “usu-
ally appears weird, unexpected, and uncommonsensical” (Watzlawick et al. 1974, 
p. 83). One of the key techniques they draw upon for second-order change is refram-
ing: changing the fundamental ways in which a situation is understood, intellectu-
ally and emotionally, so that the assumptions of those involved become quite 
different. These concepts of second-order change and reframing are useful in many 
different interventions beyond therapy, and are applicable in any kind of change 
management situation – they have been widely used for organisational change.
The third major theme of Watzlawick’s work has been that of constructivism – 
the concept that reality, or at least all the ways human beings can approach it, is 
constructed through human perceptions, sense-making and interaction. This con-
cept, which is also discussed in the chapters on Heinz von Foerster and Humberto 
Maturana, is highly philosophical. In Watzlawick’s use, it is also very practical, and 
strongly linked to therapy. In the foreword to How Real is Real? (Watzlawick 1976, 
p. xi), he talks of “the way in which communication creates reality” and argues that:
our everyday, traditional ideas of reality are delusions which we spend substantial parts of 
our daily lives shoring up … the most dangerous delusion of all is that there is only one 
reality. What there are, in fact, are many different versions of reality, some of which are 
contradictory, but all of which are the results of communication and not reflections of eter-
nal, objective truths.
He expanded upon this theme through an exploration of how confusion (involun-
tary breakdowns of communication) and disinformation (deliberate withholding of 
information) can lead people to understanding the world in ways that lead to bizarre 
or harmful results. His approach in this book, as in a number of his later books, is 
anecdotal and very readable: he tells stories and recounts relevant passages of litera-
ture. He developed these therapeutically into what he described as “the therapy of 
the as-if”, drawing on the early twentieth century philosopher Karl Vaihinger, who 
22  Paul Watzlawick

227
argued that we generally work on the basis of a large set of interrelated assumptions 
about the world – as if the world were a particular way. In an interview, Watzlawick 
described his method as:
I always assume that a person coming to see me lives in a [personal] reality, which has, for 
some reason or other, become a source of suffering. All of a sudden, the world has lost its 
meaning, the personal constructions have collapsed or are no longer functioning. I try to 
change these distressing constructions by interventions and to replace them by less painful 
or even pleasant or joyful ones. (Poerksen 2004, p. 183)
As well as his own development of constructivist ideas, Watzlawick played an 
important role in bringing together others involved in this perspective. His edited 
book The invented reality (Watzlawick 1984) was one of the first collections of 
papers on constructivism and is still widely cited. It was also through Watzlawick 
that Heinz von Foerster, after having retired from the University of Illinois and 
moved to California, became involved with MRI and with family therapy more 
widely. Von Foerster’s work was to have considerable influence in family therapy, 
and for this reason he often said in later life (only semi-flippantly) that he “was an 
invention of Paul Watzlawick” (Broecker 2005, p. 323).
We have already mentioned the Milan school of family therapy, the work of 
which makes for interesting comparisons with that of Watzlawick. This school, 
originally consisting of four therapists led by Mara Selvini Palazzoli, began its work 
in the mid-1970s, and has been very influential in Europe, especially the UK. It 
originally stressed issues of paradox, communication, circularity and the neutrality 
of the therapist – ideas developed both from and in reaction to those of the Palo Alto 
School. As the 1980s progressed, the Milan school split into a number of groups 
with different views, some of whom became more influenced by the work of von 
Foerster and Maturana, drawing explicitly upon second-order cybernetics (with a 
focus on the observer and on subtle interventions) instead of the first-order cyber-
netics of the early Palo Alto work (with its focus on maintaining homeostasis). 
Some of this group have been very critical of the early Palo Alto work, and espe-
cially the early books of Watzlawick. In fact, Watzlawick’s later views, with their 
strongly constructivist flavour, became much closer to those of the Milan school.
Paul Watzlawick consistently sought to ask questions about the nature of com-
munication between individuals (both healthy and pathological), the ways in which 
people understand the world; and to help people through the many interesting 
answers he discovered to those questions. While his intent was deeply serious and 
humanistic, his means of expressing it was highly accessible. Through a description 
of his Austrian compatriots, he described his own understanding of the world and 
way of working as follows (Watzlawick 1983, p. 9):
In the heart of Europe there was once a great empire. It was composed of so many and so 
widely different cultures that no commonsense solution to any problem could ever be 
reached, and absurdity became the only possible way of life…. The great empire is now a 
tiny country, but absurdity has remained its inhabitants’ outlook on life, and the author of 
these pages is no exception. For all of them, life is hopeless, but not serious.

Reading from Watzlawick’s work
From How Real is Real? By Paul Watzlawick, copyright ©1976 by Paul Watzlawick. 
Extract from pages 15–21.
Sometimes confusion is inherent in the structure of the message itself. This is 
best introduced by examples:
	1.	 According to a very ancient story, which has vexed philosophers and theologians 
alike, the devil once questioned God’s omnipotence by asking Him to create a 
rock so enormously big that even God Himself could not lift it. What was God to 
do? If He cannot lift the rock, He is no longer omnipotent; if He can lift it, He is 
unable to make it big enough.
	2.	 When asked what he thought that Mona Lisa smiled about, an 8 year-old is sup-
posed to have said, “Well, one evening when Mr. Lisa came home from work, he 
asked her, ‘What kind of a day did you have, dear?’ And Mona Lisa smiled and 
said, ‘Imagine, Leonardo da Vinci came and painted my portrait.’”
	3.	 There is a popular bumper sticker that reads: “My convictions are not for public 
display”.
	4.	 “I’m glad I don’t like cauliflower, because if I did, I’d eat it, and I hate the stuff.” 
(Anonymous)
	5.	 The philosopher Karl Popper claims, tongue in cheek, that he once sent the fol-
lowing letter to a colleague:
Dear M.G.,
Kindly return this card to me, but make sure to write “Yes”, or to put some other 
mark of your choice, in the blank rectangle to the left of my signature if, and 
only if, you feel justified in predicting that, upon its return, I shall find this 
space still empty.
Yours sincerely,
K. R. Popper (1963)
If by now the reader feels a strange paralysis creeping into his mind, he has 
already had a direct experience of this form of confusion. Let us look at still another 
example, this one from Mary Poppins, by Pamela L. Travers. Mary Poppins, an 
English nanny, has taken her two little charges, Jane and Michael, to a gingerbread 
shop owned by Mrs. Corry, a tiny, witchlike old woman with two large, sad daugh-
ters, Fannie and Annie. The following conversation develops:
“I suppose, my dear” – she turned to Mary Poppins, whom she appeared to know very well
– “I suppose you’ve come for some gingerbread?”
“That’s right, Mrs. Corry”, said Mary Poppins politely.
“Good. Have Fannie and Annie given you any?” She looked at Jane and Michael as she said 
this.
“No, Mother”, said Miss Fannie meekly.
“We were just going to, Mother –” began Miss Annie in a frightened whisper.
At that Mrs. Corry drew herself up to her full height and regarded her gigantic daughters 
furiously. Then she said in a soft, fierce, terrifying voice:
22  Paul Watzlawick

229
“Just going to? Oh, indeed! That is very interesting. And who, may I ask, Annie, gave you 
permission to give away my gingerbread?”
“Nobody, Mother. And I didn’t give it away. I only thought –”
“You only thought! That is very kind of you. But I will thank you not to think. I can do all 
the thinking that is necessary here!” said Mrs. Corry in her soft, terrible voice. Then she 
burst into a harsh cackle of laughter. “Look at her! Just look at her! Cowardy-custard! 
Crybaby!” she shrieked, pointing her knotty finger at her daughter.
Jane and Michael turned and saw a large tear coursing down Miss Annie’s huge, sad face, 
and they did not like to say anything, for, in spite of her tininess, Mrs. Corry made them 
feel rather small and frightened. (Travers 1934).
Within half a minute Mrs. Corry has managed to block poor Annie in all three 
areas of human functioning: acting, thinking and feeling. She first implies that to 
give the children some gingerbread would have been the right thing to do. When her 
daughters are about to apologize for not having done this yet, she suddenly denies 
their right to take that action. Annie tries to defend herself by pointing out that she 
did not actually do it, but only thought of doing it. Mrs. Corry promptly lets her 
know that she is not supposed to think. The way the mother expresses her displea-
sure leaves no doubt that this is an important matter and her daughter had better be 
sorry about what happened. With this she manages to drive Annie to tears and then 
immediately ridicules her feelings.
Let us not make the mistake of shrugging off this story because it is fiction, and 
children’s fiction to boot. Research into the communication styles of families with 
a member who has been diagnosed as psychiatrically disturbed or into larger human 
conflicts shows that this pattern appears very frequently (Bateson et al. 1956). It is 
called a double bind. What a double bind and the earlier examples have in common 
is that they are all structured like the paradoxes, or antinomies, in formal logic. But 
while for most of us formal paradoxes are merely amusing recollections from our 
school days, the paradoxes contained in communication are of stark practical impor-
tance. Very much as in the Mary Poppins story, there are three basic variations of the 
paradoxical theme:
	1.	 If an individual is punished for correct perception of the outside world or of 
himself by a significant other (e.g., a child by a parent), he will learn to distrust 
the data of his senses. A predicament of this kind arises when, say, an alcoholic 
father demands that his children see him as a gentle, loving parent, even or espe-
cially when he comes home drunk and threatens them all with violence. The 
children are then forced to perceive reality not as it looks to them, but as their 
father defines it for them. A person who has repeatedly been exposed to this kind 
of confusion will find it very difficult to behave appropriately in many life situa-
tions and may spend inordinate amounts of time trying to find out how he 
‘should’ see reality. Examined out of its interpersonal context, his behavior 
would satisfy the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia.
	2.	 If an individual is expected by a significant other to have feelings different from 
those he actually experiences, he will eventually feel guilty for being unable to 
feel what he is told he ought to feel in order to be approved of by the other per-
son. This guilt may itself be labeled one of the feelings he should not have. A 
Reading from Watzlawick’s work

230
dilemma of this kind arises most frequently when a child’s occasional normal 
sadness (or disappointment or fatigue) is construed by a parent as a silent impu-
tation of parental failure. The parent typically reacts with the message “After all 
we have done for you, you ought to be happy”. Sadness thus becomes associated 
with badness and ingratitude. In his fruitless attempts not to feel unhappy, the 
child displays behavior which, examined out of context, satisfies the diagnostic 
criteria of depression. Depression also occurs when an individual feels, or is 
held, responsible for something over which he has no control (e.g., marital con-
flict between his parents, the illness or failure of a parent or sibling, or his own 
inability to meet parental expectations that exceed his physical and/or emotional 
resources).
	3.	 If a significant other gives injunctions that both demand and prohibit certain 
actions, a paradoxical situation arises in which the individual (again, notably a 
child) can obey only by disobeying. The prototype of this is: “Do what I say, not 
what I would like you to do”. This is the message given by a mother who wants 
her teen-age son to be both law-abiding and a daredevil. The likely result is 
behavior that, examined out of context, satisfies the social definition of delin-
quency. Other examples are parents who place great value on winning by any 
means, fair or foul, but tell the child that “one should always be honest”; or a 
mother who begins to warn her daughter at a very early age of the dangers and 
ugliness of sex, but insists that she be “popular” with boys.
There is a fourth variation of this theme, and it is probably the most frequent in 
human interaction. It occurs whenever somebody demands of another person behav-
ior that by its very nature must be spontaneous but now cannot be because it has 
been demanded. ‘Be spontaneous’ paradoxes, as they are called, range in intensity 
from mild nuisances to tragic traps, depending on the importance of the need 
expressed through them. It is one of the shortcomings of human communication that 
there is no way in which the spontaneous fulfillment of a need can be elicited from 
another person without creating this kind of self-defeating paradox. A wife who 
needs a sign of affection from her husband eventually tells him, “I wish you would 
sometimes bring me flowers”. The request is quite understandable, but by making it, 
she has irreversibly ruined her chances of getting what she wants: if her husband 
disregards her request, she will feel dissatisfied; if he now brings her flowers, she 
will also be dissatisfied, because he did not do it of his own accord.
Very much the same impasse arises between a child and his parents when they 
think he is not assertive enough. In one way or another they signal: “Don’t be so 
obedient”. Again this leaves only two alternatives, both unacceptable: either the 
child remains unassertive (in which case the parents will be dissatisfied because he 
is not obeying them) or he becomes more assertive (in which case they will be dis-
content because he is doing the right thing for the wrong reason – that is, he is obey-
ing them). A person in this situation cannot win, but neither can the originator of the 
paradoxical request.
(A variation of the ‘Be spontaneous’ theme, or rather its converse, considered a 
‘nice touch’ by certain hotel managers, is shown on the opposite page [a drawing of

an unhappy waitress wearing a badge expressing pleasure at the customer’s pres-
ence]. Not only is the welcome expressed by the lapel button disqualified (contra-
dicted) by the waitress’s facial expression, but the statement itself, “We’re glad 
you’re here”, is further disqualified by the way it is communicated. A welcome is 
meaningful only if it is given individually and spontaneously. But as a written mes-
sage, worn by every employee of the hotel as part of the uniform, it is not simply 
meaningless, it gives the guest a good idea of the kind of ‘personalized’ service he 
can expect. Here the paradox is contained not in a demand for spontaneous behav-
ior, but in the indiscriminate, blanket offer of such behavior.)
The ‘Be spontaneous’ pattern is a universal paradox. As recent advances in logic, 
especially in the computer sciences but also in pure mathematics, have shown, many 
seemingly unambiguous concepts are ultimately paradoxical (e.g., computability, 
provability, consistency, probability). The same holds true for more general con-
cepts, such as spontaneity, trust, sanity or even power.

Ilya Prigogine
Ilya Romanovich Prigogine was a chemist and physicist. He made enormous 
advances in the field of thermodynamics, historically the study of the behaviour of 
energy, heat and work in physical systems. His theory of dissipative structures, 
which describes the self-organising activity of systems ‘far from equilibrium’, has 
been foundational in complexity theory. He both drew upon systems theory and 
advanced it in important ways, particularly regarding systems in the physical world. 
His ideas have also been applied to human systems in several disciplines. McMillan 
(2004, p. 27) describes his work as follows: “Instead of a world where systems ran 
down and were subject to an ongoing deterioration, he showed that systems were 
essentially non-linear, dynamic and able to transform themselves into new states 
of being.”
Prigogine was born in January 1917 in Moscow, shortly before the Russian revo-
lution. His family “had a difficult relationship with the new regime” (Prigogine 
1977), being both Jewish and merchants, and left Russia in 1921, initially for 
Germany but settling in Belgium in 1929. Prigogine was educated and lived the rest 
of his life in Brussels, becoming a Belgian citizen in 1949. During World War II, he 
was imprisoned by the Nazis for 10 weeks in 1943 but released due to the efforts of 
his father-in-law; although universities were shut in Belgium he taught privately and 
illegally for the duration of the war, for which he was awarded the Resistance Medal 
(Vdovichenko 2017, p. 297). His university education was at the Université Libre de 
Bruxelles (Free University of Brussels), where he took his Ph.D. in chemistry in 
1941, and where he became a professor for the rest of his life. He died in 2003 in 
Brussels, at the age of 86.
Prigogine had two major academic affiliations for most of his working life. He 
was director of the International Solvay Institutes for Chemistry and Physics in 
Brussels from 1959 onwards. He was also based in the USA, as professor of physics 
and chemical engineering at the University of Texas in Austin, where in 1967 he 
founded the Centre for Statistical Mechanics. He continued to direct both institutes 
until his death. He was active in many scientific societies, and in 1988 served as 
president of the International Society for Systems Sciences.

236
He received many awards. Most notably, he was awarded the Nobel prize for 
chemistry in 1977, for his work on dissipative structures. This led to enormous 
popularity in Belgium – it is said that “no restaurant in Brussels would allow him to 
pay for a meal” (Brennan 2003) – and he was granted the title of Viscount in 1989 
by the King of Belgium. He also received many other scientific and political awards 
from countries including the UK, Sweden, Spain, France, Japan, Italy, and his native 
Russia where he was an overseas member of the USSR (later Russian) Academy of 
Sciences. He was awarded the Norbert Wiener Gold Medal by the World Organisation 
of Systems and Cybernetics in 1999.
Prigogine had wide interests beyond natural sciences or indeed academic work 
in general. He was a keen piano player, following his mother Yuliya who was a 
pianist, and until he went to university had largely studied the humanities and only 
moved to the sciences through an interest in psychology (Vdovichenko 2017). In 
later life, he became a keen collector of art (especially ancient Chinese and pre-­
Columbian American). A colleague writing an obituary called him “a modern 
equivalent of a humanist of the Renaissance period” (Goldbeter 2003, p. 259), and 
in his autobiography for the Nobel prize, he wrote that:
as I left [high school], my interest was more focused on history and archaeology, not to 
mention music, especially piano. According to my mother, I was able to read musical scores 
before I read printed words. And, today, my favourite pastime is still piano playing, although 
my free time for practice is becoming more and more restricted. (Prigogine 1977)
Prigogine’s work was extensive and wide-ranging within the physical sciences, 
and this discussion will only touch on aspects of it which are most relevant to sys-
tems ideas. His contribution to systems thinking was very significant: he carried on 
the scientific tradition of general systems theory, and gave this respectability through 
his Nobel prize. Just as Ludwig von Bertalanffy was strongly inspired by thermody-
namics in the formulation of general systems theory, so Prigogine’s work on ther-
modynamics drew upon and extended Bertalanffy’s theory of open systems.
Most important for our purposes is the theory of dissipative structures. Classical 
thermodynamics deals with the behaviour of energy in closed systems in a state of 
equilibrium (or close to it). It is in this context that the second law of thermodynam-
ics – that entropy (disorder) always increases through the dissipation of energy – 
was described. However, many physical systems are open to energy entering and 
leaving from beyond the system; and many are in a non-equilibrium state. These 
were studied by a number of scientists in the first half of the twentieth century, nota-
bly by Théophile de Donder, Prigogine’s mentor and Ph.D. supervisor.
Prigogine’s interest was in the thermodynamics of systems that are ‘far from 
equilibrium’ – those where the energy levels are constantly changing and which are 
characterised by instability rather than stability. Open systems that are far from 
equilibrium are constantly dissipating energy to their environment, which leads to 
their self-organisation into complex forms of order (as opposed to increasing disor-
der as happens with dissipation in a classic thermodynamic closed system). This 
combination of constant change with emerging order, which might seem paradoxi-
cal, is summarised by the term ‘dissipative structure’. As Capra (1996) observes, 
23  Ilya Prigogine

237
this combination of terms in many ways resembles Ludwig von Bertalanffy’s coin-
ing, in general systems theory, of the key term Fliessgleichgewicht (usually trans-
lated ‘dynamic equilibrium’, but literally ‘flowing balance’) which similarly puts 
together concepts of flux and constancy. Prigogine and Stengers (1984, p. 12) com-
ment that:
In far-from-equilibrium conditions we may have transformation from disorder, from ther-
mal chaos, into order. New dynamic states of matter may originate, states that reflect the 
interaction of a given system with its surroundings. We have called these new structures 
dissipative structures to emphasise the constructive role of dissipative processes in their 
formation.
An example of a dissipative structure from everyday life is given by Capra 
(1996): the ‘whirlpool’ caused when a bathtub is emptying. Water is constantly 
flowing out of the whirlpool down the drain, yet a consistent structure is maintained. 
In fact the structure (the classic whirlpool shape) arises because of the outflow of 
water through the structure, and arises spontaneously as a result of complex feed-
back processes that have their origins in the rotational velocities of the water (as 
well as other factors such as air currents and the exact shape of the drainpipe). There 
are many similar phenomena in nature which are also dissipative structures (albeit 
with much greater complexity and many more forces in operation)  – examples 
include tornadoes and the Great Red Spot, the continually changing storm system 
on the planet Jupiter.
Some living systems can also be described as dissipative structures, notably 
cells. In Kauffman’s words (1995, p. 21), “cells hum along as complex chemical 
systems that persistently metabolize food molecules to maintain their internal struc-
ture and to reproduce. Hence cells are nonequilibrium dissipative structures”. 
Indeed, Capra (1996) links the behaviour of a cell quite explicitly to that of the 
whirlpool, but with the key difference that the instabilities which lead to the dissipa-
tive structure of the whirlpool arise from mechanical causes, based on the rotary 
motion of the water, but the instabilities in cells which lead to their structures arise 
from chemical processes.
The constantly changing state of a dissipative structure is crucial to understand-
ing its nature. It is not the case that such a system reaches a particular structure and 
then remains in that structure. Rather, a dissipative structure is constantly maintain-
ing its current form and/or changing into different forms. Prigogine describes it as 
going through a series of ‘bifurcation points’, where the system can either stay as it 
currently is, move to a new form, or collapse altogether into chaos. It is not possible 
to predict in advance what will happen at any given bifurcation point, and the behav-
iour of the system is extremely sensitive to very small changes in its environment.
Dissipative structures remain an important topic in the physical sciences. Fifty 
years after Prigogine first published the theory, and also to mark the centenary of his 
birth, a workshop was held in Chile on ‘instabilities and non-equilibrium struc-
tures’, at which a series of papers were presented describing the way in which the 
theory had developed since its original formulation. Introducing a journal issue of 
papers from this workshop, Tlidi et al. (2018, p. 1) wrote about Prigogine:
23  Ilya Prigogine

238
The resounding progress he reported has been described as marking the end of the tyranny 
of equilibrium in thermodynamics. He not only increased our knowledge of the fundamen-
tal laws governing the evolution of matter but also announced future advances that he 
foresaw.
The concept of dissipative structures has great application beyond the physical 
sciences to a variety of other situations, in particular human systems. Prigogine and 
his collaborators applied the concept directly to traffic patterns in urban settings and 
to the activities of termite mounds. It has been used as part of the opening up of 
family therapy to complex dynamic settings far beyond the equilibrium sought by 
early therapists (Elkaïm et al. 1982).
As with many concepts linked to complexity theory, dissipative structures have 
also found considerable application in organisational theory. Sice and French (2006, 
p. 858) argue that managers “can exploit the chaotic characteristic of behaviour by 
looking for conditions that will allow small efforts to produce a significantly vari-
able spectrum of appropriate behaviours”. Mitleton-Kelly and Papaefthimiou (2000, 
p. 2) discuss the importance of bifurcation points in organisations:
In human systems, far-from-equilibrium conditions operate when a system is perturbed 
away from its established norms, or away from its usual ways of working and relating. 
When it is thus disturbed (e.g. after restructuring or a merger) it may reach a ‘bifurcation’ 
point and either degrade into disorder, loss of morale, loss of productivity, etc., or create a 
new order and organisation – i.e. find new ways of working and relating – and thus create a 
new coherence.
While dissipative structures are an important concept in their own right, they also 
form a key mechanism by which self-organisation – the “spontaneous emergence of 
order” (Capra 1996, p. 84) – occurs in a range of systems. This concept is at the 
heart of complexity theory, which examines the way in which highly complex phe-
nomena arise from apparently simple rules along with tiny fluctuations in initial 
conditions. Stacey (2003, p.  226) clearly describes the link between the two 
concepts:
self-organisation is a process that occurs spontaneously at certain critical values of a sys-
tem’s control parameters and it involves the system organising itself to produce a different 
pattern without any blueprint. … The different pattern that emerges is a dissipative structure 
in that it easily dissolves if the system moves away from critical points in its control param-
eters. An equilibrium structure requires no effort to retain its structure and great effort to 
change it, while a dissipative structure requires great effort to retain its structures and rela-
tively little to change it.
The concept of self-organisation is generally attributed to Ross Ashby and was 
further developed by Heinz von Foerster and Stuart Kauffman, as described in the 
chapters of this book on each author, and thus has its roots in cybernetics. Although 
Prigogine makes considerable use of the concept of self-organisation, he does not 
draw upon the cybernetics tradition at all (his few brief references even to Wiener 
are often critical), and his basis for discussing self-organisation comes instead from 
the physical sciences. This can be said to strengthen the concept of self-­organisation, 
as it can be seen to have two independent sources from quite different traditions. 
Given his work on self-organisation, it is appropriate to regard Prigogine as one of 
23  Ilya Prigogine

the key founders of modern complexity theory, and indeed the subject of complexity 
was of considerable interest to him and his collaborators (e.g. Nicolis and Prigogine 
1989, has the title Exploring Complexity). Malaina (2015), following the work of 
Edgar Morin, places Prigogine in the category of ‘general complexity’ as opposed 
to the ‘restricted complexity’ developed at the Santa Fe Institute among other places.
Prigogine was keenly aware that his work had significant philosophical implica-
tions, both for the nature of science and for the relationship between science and 
society. These stemmed from the importance he placed on the role of time in physi-
cal science (inspired by the work of the philosopher Henri Bergson). In much of the 
traditional physical sciences (especially Newtonian physics and classical thermody-
namics), he argued, time is irrelevant: the focus has been on phenomena which are 
reversible, in principle able to occur in the opposite direction. However, many phe-
nomena can be observed, especially in chemistry, which are irreversible: if we mix 
together two liquids (say by pouring milk into a cup of coffee and stirring it), it is 
not subsequently possible to separate them. This applies equally strongly to dissipa-
tive structures.
By concentrating on irreversibility, Prigogine argues that we are able to intro-
duce the concept of time – and thus related concepts of evolution and fluctuation – 
into physical science. This is the major theme of Prigogine’s popular work Order 
out of chaos, co-authored with Isabelle Stengers: “where classical science used to 
emphasise permanence, we now find change and evolution” (Prigogine and Stengers 
1984, p. 214). We have noted above that the second law of thermodynamics (entropy 
always increases) is only applicable to closed systems close to equilibrium. By con-
trast, Prigogine sought to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the princi-
ples of evolution (increasing order) and entropy (increasing disorder), by using this 
to introduce the concept of evolution into physics, in discussing “open systems that 
evolve to higher and higher forms of complexity” (Prigogine and Stengers 1984, 
p. 298).
As mentioned above, Prigogine had a strong interest throughout his life in the 
arts; he also valued the application of his theories to social systems – his ideas had 
a profound influence on the world-systems approach of the sociologist Immanuel 
Wallerstein among others (see Wallerstein et al. 2013). By focusing on time and 
irreversibility, he hoped to bring together the physical and human sciences. Prigogine 
and Stengers (1984, p. xxvii) begin their book by arguing that “our vision of nature 
is undergoing a radical change toward the multiple, the temporal, and the complex”, 
and that this change is much more amenable to the human sciences than the deter-
ministic approach usually emphasised in the physical sciences. The original French 
title of their book (published in 1979) was La Nouvelle Alliance, the new alliance, 
to reflect this hope. In his autobiographical summary, Prigogine (1977) wrote that:
All these problems have a common element: time. Maybe the orientation of my work came 
from the conflict which arose from my humanist vocation as an adolescent and from the 
scientific orientation I chose for my university training. Almost by instinct, I turned myself 
later towards problems of increasing complexity, perhaps in the belief that I could find there 
a junction in physical science on one hand, and in biology and human science on the other.

Prigogine’s work was scientifically and philosophically radical in many areas. As 
one might expect with such radicalism, he received criticism from a number of oth-
ers for his ideas and the way he expressed them, both in terms of the science itself 
and his application of the science to philosophical contexts. One reviewer summed 
up these criticisms in discussing Order out of chaos: “while this book contains 
much that is new and correct, all too often that which is correct is not new and that 
which is new is not correct” (Pagels 1985, p. 97).
Nonetheless, his ideas have been widely accepted and applied across a range of 
disciplines, and are highly important in our understanding of both physical and 
human systems. In an obituary, Goldbeter (2003, p. 259) wrote:
In his last public lecture, given in Brussels in November 2002 on the occasion of a celebra-
tion of the 25th anniversary of his Nobel prize, he simply declared: “Astonishment leads to 
creativity”. These words sum up well his relentless, creative questioning of the world.

The word ‘instability’ has a strange fate. It is sometimes used with a slightly 
negative connotation, as if it is something which must be transcended. In fact, its 
usage is quite recent. The word is used occasionally in physics, where it describes 
an elementary phenomenon: if I swing a pendulum, holding it so that the weight is 
at the bottom, it will eventually stop with its centre of gravity as low as possible – 
this is a stable phenomenon. But it is common knowledge that if I hold it upside 
down it could fall to the right or the left, and very small vibrations will be sufficient 
to make it fall one way rather than the other.
This phenomenon is obviously very elementary and has probably been known 
for thousands of years; indeed, early work in mechanics shows that everyone stud-
ied the movement of the pendulum in great detail. Very little, however, has been 
written about the upside-down pendulum. The notion of instability has in some way 
been ideologically suppressed, for the phenomenon of instability leads naturally to 
very important, serious problems.
The first of these is the problem of forecasting. Clearly, if I take a stable pendu-
lum and agitate it, I can predict what will happen: it will return to a minimum swing. 
If, on the other hand, I hold it upside down, it is very difficult to predict whether it 
will fall to the right or to the left – this depends on fluctuations. So we have on one 
hand something that is forecastable, and on the other something that is not. This is 
where the problem of determinism comes in. The pendulum on its minimum swing 
is a deterministic object: we know what will happen. In contrast, the problem of the 
pendulum turned on its head involves a non-deterministic object.

Man and Nature
Firstly, there is the question of why in science today the talk is of instability, whereas 
previously people talked about determinism. Instability has in some way replaced 
determinism. The introduction of instability allows us a clearer view of human 
activity within nature, and hence enables us to incorporate humankind more fully 
into nature. The introduction of instability and non-forecastability, and hence ulti-
mately of time as the essential variable, is highly significant in reducing the cultural 
fragmentation which currently exists between social science and pure science.
Why does this concept change man’s relationship to nature? In a deterministic 
world nature is controllable, it is an inert object susceptible to our will. If nature 
contains instability as an essential element, we must respect it, for we cannot predict 
what may happen.
Secondly, in introducing the concept of instability, we arrive at a more global 
concept of science, embracing more of the cultural context of the seventeenth cen-
tury when Western science was born. In this way, science leads to a more universal 
message, more respectful of the cultural traditions of other civilizations.

Order and Disorder
Today, we know that increase in entropy is not an increase in disorder, for order and 
disorder are created simultaneously. If we take two containers and put two gases in 
them, for example hydrogen and nitrogen, and if we heat one and cool the other, we 
find that there is more hydrogen in one container and more nitrogen in the other, due 
to the difference in temperature. Here we have a dissipative phenomenon which cre-
ates disorder, while the flow of heat also creates order: hydrogen on one side, nitro-
gen on the other. Order and disorder are intimately connected – one implies the 
other. This is the change we are witnessing in our perception of the universe today.
Our view of the universe has long been partial. It has been like the view we have 
from the aeroplane when we arrive in, say, Venice; we see the magnificent buildings 
and squares, and say: ‘What an extraordinary structure’. But when we are in Venice, 
we see that there is also pollution, and mosquitoes – we see both aspects. Interestingly, 
in contemporary cosmology the universe is to a large extent – I would even say 
essentially – formed by disorder, in which order floats.
We know today that for every billion thermal photons in disorder, there is one 
elementary particle supposed to be able to transmit ordered structures. Our percep-
tion of the universe has become dualistic – the two aspects of order and disorder 
coexist and give us a different vision of the universe. Not only does non-equilibrium 
lead to both order and disorder, but it also leads to events, because more possibilities 
appear than do in a state of equilibrium. In a situation far from equilibrium, equa-
tions become non-linear, and non-linear equations usually have more than one solu-

242
tion. We now know that at any given moment, new solutions are emerging; it is the 
phenomenon of bifurcation which leads to new solutions which imply a new spatio-
temporal organization. For example, a chemical clock is something in which all the 
molecules become blue at the same time, then red a little later, then blue, then red.
So molecules can communicate. Coherence far from a state of equilibrium 
acquires huge dimensions in comparison with what happens in a state of equilib-
rium. In equilibrium each molecule can see only its immediate neighbours. Out of 
equilibrium the system can see the totality of the system. One could almost say that 
matter in equilibrium is blind, and out of equilibrium it starts to see. Hence there are 
events, fluctuations which prepare for an event, amplification, sensitivity to the 
external world, historical perspectives due to other successive forms of organiza-
tion, and the appearance of a series of new categories of phenomena, called 
attractors.
If we pick up a pendulum which has been left to itself, it returns to one point – 
this is a punctual attractor; but in the case of chemical clocks, we are talking about 
periodic attractors. Subsequently much more complicated attractors have been dis-
covered, strange attractors which correspond to numerous points. The system moves 
from one point to another – it is a mixture of stability and instability. What is curi-
ous, and central to the interest of many physicists, chemists, meteorologists and 
ecologists, is that our environment, our climate, our ecology, and even our nervous 
system can only be understood in the light of such systems, which are both stable 
and unstable. They are determined by strange attractors and hence by a mixture of 
stability and unstability; it is therefore difficult to forecast what will happen.
Respect, Not Control
Of course, this does not mean that these systems elude science; we have not chosen 
the world we describe, we are born into a certain world and we must take account 
of this world as it is, reducing as far as possible our a priori feelings. This world is 
unstable  – this is not a capitulation, but on the contrary an encouragement to 
­combine new experimental and theoretical research which takes account of this 
unstable character. The world is not a victim offered up for us to dominate; we must 
respect it. The world of unstable phenomena is not a world which we can control, 
any more than we can control human society in the sense that extrapolation in clas-
sical physics led us to believe. […]
We need to be aware that our knowledge is still a limited window on the uni-
verse; because of instability we must abandon the dream of total knowledge of the 
universe. From our window, we must extrapolate and guess what the mechanisms 
could be. An unstable world means that although we may know the initial condi-
tions to an infinite number of decimal points, the future remains impossible to 
forecast.
There is a close analogy with a work of literature: in its first chapter a novel 
begins with a description of the situation in a finite number of words, but it is still

open to numerous possible developments and this is ultimately the pleasure of read-
ing: discovering which one of the possible developments will be used. Similarly, in 
a Bach fugue, once the theme has been given it allows a great number of develop-
ments out of which Bach has chosen. This world is very different from the classical 
world, and it extends to all of physics and cosmology. Instability leads to a new 
rationality, which puts an end to the idea of absolute control, and with it an end to 
any possible idealization of a society under absolute control. The real is not control-
lable in the sense which science claimed.
[…]
Risk and Responsibility
Obviously there is no risk in a deterministic universe. There are risks in a universe 
which we see differently, particularly in a human universe. I will not discuss this 
problem in more detail here, but it is clear that in going back to the very foundations 
of science from this viewpoint, humankind necessarily has choices, and choice 
means ethical responsibility. Valéry wrote: “Time is construction”. I believe this is 
precisely right. Time is not something already made, which would appear unfolded 
before a supra-human consciousness. It is something which is constructed at each 
moment. Humankind can participate in this construction.

Chapter 24
Stuart Kauffman
Stuart Kauffman is a theoretical biologist and one of the founders of complexity 
theory. Through a series of highly detailed computer models, he has explored the 
nature of evolution and self-organisation – the ways in which order and organisation 
can spontaneously arise in biological systems. His research is driven by the goal to 
prove a hypothesis he first felt intuitively at the age of 24: “there is ‘order for free’ 
out there, a spontaneous crystallisation of order out of complex systems, with no 
need for natural selection or any other external force” (quoted in Lewin 1999, p. 25). 
His work on this hypothesis has led to many important advances.
Kauffman, an American whose father was a wealthy Romanian immigrant, was 
born in 1939. He had a strong teenage interest in science and was very inspired by 
Einstein’s view of science as a quest for God. This led him initially towards a study 
of human nature, first briefly as a playwright and then as a philosopher. He took 
degrees in philosophy first at Dartmouth College and then, via a Marshall scholar-
ship, at Oxford, specialising in the philosophy of science and mind.
Kauffman is very articulate and creative, “like a composer whose mind was end-
lessly aboil with melody … [and] a very high ratio of talking to listening” (Waldrop 
1992, p. 101), but he distrusted these qualities in himself. This led him to attend 
graduate school in medicine, reasoning that “I figured somewhere I had to learn a 
bunch of facts, and if I went to medical school, the bastards would make me learn a 
lot of facts” (quoted by Regis 2000). He graduated from medical school in 1968, but 
only worked as a hospital doctor for a year before entering academia as a theoretical 
biologist, initially in mathematical biosciences at Chicago. In 1975 he moved to the 
University of Pennsylvania, where he became professor of bioscience and biophys-
ics until his retirement in 1995. While at Pennsylvania, he became a founding 
­member of the Santa Fe Institute (discussed further below), of which he remains an 
external faculty member. Following a period as an entrepreneur after he founded the 
consultancy Bios Group, he re-entered academia in 2004 and spent time at a number 
of universities, moving in 2013 to the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, 
where he is currently based.

246
While he was still a medical student, Kauffman became interested in the question 
of how order arose in biological systems. Using recently-published work that 
showed how certain genes acted as regulators of other nearby genes, and switched 
on or off in a binary fashion, he was able to model a series of binary genetic net-
works and show order spontaneously arising above a certain level of complexity in 
the network. He wrote about this work to Warren McCulloch at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology, as it bore a strong resemblance to McCulloch’s own early 
work in neural networks, and McCulloch invited him to spend the summer of 1966 
at MIT. As with many others previously, Kauffman was inspired, supported by and 
introduced to many important contacts by McCulloch. He would later say that 
“Warren literally catapulted me into the world that I’ve lived in ever since” (quoted 
in Waldrop 1992, p. 116); and McCulloch in turn said that he “regarded Kauffman 
as his most important collaborator since [Walter] Pitts” (Hayles 1999, p.  241). 
McCulloch’s influence on Kauffman demonstrates the way in which Kauffman has 
served as a bridge between cybernetics and complexity theory.
The cybernetic concept of feedback and the use of computer modelling were to 
become vital in Kauffman’s subsequent work. He has continued to use binary net-
works as the basis of his models – a series of nodes which can take the values of ‘on’ 
or ‘off’, each connected to a number of other nodes. The number of nodes and the 
ways in which they are connected vary, as do the rules which govern the behaviour 
of the network – whether a node should switch on or off according to the value of 
its connected nodes. By varying these different aspects, Kauffman has built net-
works which can model many kinds of highly complex and interconnected situa-
tions. The model starts with a set of initial values at the nodes, but the rules for 
switching lead to changing patterns across the network, exhibiting many different 
kinds of emergent behaviour. Because the key parameters of the network are the 
number of nodes (N) and the average number of inputs to each node (K), Kauffman 
refers to these models as NK networks.
He has particularly used these networks to model fitness landscapes – a map of 
the evolutionary strength of particular organisms (or other kinds of agents), where 
the peaks of a landscape represent high ability to survive and the valleys represent 
low survival. NK networks are also the basis of Kauffman’s theory of autocatalytic 
sets  – interlinked collections of objects (such as living cells), forming a self-­
reinforcing network, which act to catalyse the formation of the other objects in the 
network. In particular, Kauffman has applied autocatalytic sets to the question of the 
origins of life, and argued that life “is the natural accomplishment of catalysts in 
sufficiently complex nonequilibrium chemical systems” (Kauffman 1995, p. 51).
In 1986, Kauffman became one of the founding members of the Santa Fe 
Institute, in New Mexico, USA, perhaps the most important centre for the develop-
ment of complexity theory. The Institute arose from two related sources  – an 
­awareness by a number of eminent physical scientists that there was a growing 
convergence of research in a range of fields into nonlinear dynamics and self-organ-
isation, for which traditional reductionist and disciplinary methods were inadequate; 
and the growing power of computer technology with the capacity to model highly 
complex problems.
24  Stuart Kauffman

247
The Santa Fe Institute was largely established by researchers connected to the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory, the major research centre for nuclear weapons in 
the US, who wanted to pursue issues of nonlinearity and complexity in a highly 
interdisciplinary environment and were also keen to carry out work that was not 
connected to the military. The Institute’s work is characterised by the use of detailed 
computer models of large numbers of adaptive agents, where simple rules are estab-
lished as to the interactions of the agents and complex behaviour is seen to emerge 
with no further intervention from the model’s designers. Kauffman’s NK networks 
are one example, along with a number of other models such as cellular automata. 
These models display such high levels of emergent self-organisation that they have 
led to the creation of a field, related to artificial intelligence, known as ‘artificial life’.
Although Kauffman had originally intended to spend perhaps a month in each 
year at the Santa Fe Institute, personal circumstances led to him spending much 
more time in Santa Fe, and becoming one of the key people in the Institute. He 
described the Institute as
a brand new enterprise comprised of an interdisciplinary group of extremely smart people 
who started a new science called complexity. None of us knew exactly what this new sci-
ence was but we all knew it was very important … our mixture of passion and utter confu-
sion drove our creativity for a decade as we struggled to invent this new area of science. 
(quoted in Boucher 2005)
The work of the Santa Fe Institute has led to many important developments in 
complexity theory, particularly the concepts of complex adaptive systems and the 
edge of chaos, both of which Kauffman helped to develop. It has also drawn on, and 
made popular, the general systems theory concept of emergence (and related it 
closely to self-organisation), which Kauffman (2007, p. 907) describes as the view 
that “new entities with their own properties and causal powers arise and are part of 
the furniture of the universe”.
Complex adaptive systems are systems which are made up of many intercon-
nected parts that are constantly self-organising and adapting in response to their 
environment. The concept has been applied widely to natural systems such as the 
brain and insect colonies, to organisations and societies, and to economies. The 
adaptiveness which they exhibit has been the subject of much of Kauffman’s model-
ling work, drawing quite explicitly on Ross Ashby’s research within cybernetics in 
the 1950s on adaptive behaviour (discussed in the chapter on Ashby).
A further major contribution which Kauffman has made to complexity theory is 
his work on the concept of the ‘edge of chaos’ (which he and a number of other 
researchers at Santa Fe, notably Chris Langton who is a pioneer of ‘artificial life’, 
independently discovered). This concept observes that in many systems, there is a 
narrow zone between total order (which is stagnant and lifeless) and total disorder 
(which is chaotic and uncontrollable). It is within this zone – the edge of chaos – 
that life and creativity can exist, as Kauffman vividly describes in the reading which 
follows. This concept has been applied by Kauffman and many others in a wide 
range of fields including business, economics, and social science.
24  Stuart Kauffman

248
Kauffman has developed many other concepts in his work which are highly 
applicable to other fields. Especially notable in this regard is his idea of the ‘adja-
cent possible’, the possible future ways that the world could develop from its cur-
rent state. He originally defined this in relation to molecular biology, defining it in 
relation to the ‘actual’, the current state of the world as “all those molecular species 
that are not members of the actual, but are one reaction step away from the actual” 
(Kauffman 2000, p. 142). Extending this concept to human innovation, Johnson 
(2010, p. 31) describes it as “a kind of shadow future, hovering on the edges of the 
present state of things, a map of all the ways in which the present can reinvent 
itself”.
Kauffman has applied his ideas quite widely in practical settings. For 7 years he 
led a consultancy company, Bios Group, to assist business problems through com-
plexity modelling. For example, Kauffman and his colleagues worked with Procter 
& Gamble, observing that the company’s intuitively sensible policy that all trucks 
leaving distribution warehouses should be full was creating bottlenecks in their sup-
ply chain which could be removed if trucks were allowed to leave warehouses with 
only partial loads. Similar techniques were applied to a number of other organisa-
tions in various sectors.
Kauffman’s work has significant philosophical implications as well as purely 
scientific ones. In relation to the origin of life, he has used phrases such as “we the 
expected” and “at home in the universe” (Kauffman 1995) to indicate the impor-
tance of self-organising living systems within the world, as distinct from the neo-­
Darwinian view of natural selection occurring at random. Indeed he has argued that 
“natural selection cannot be the sole source of the order we see in the world” 
(Kauffman 1995, p. viii). In the highly-charged context of contemporary America, 
this view has drawn him into the debates on ‘intelligent design’, the quasi-­creationist 
argument that some kind of designer must be necessary to explain the complexity of 
the universe. While Kauffman agrees with the intelligent design advocates in argu-
ing that neo-Darwinism is insufficient, his solution of self-organisation is quite dif-
ferent, and he has very publicly distanced himself from intelligent design 
(Kauffman 2006).
The philosophical aspect of Kauffman’s work has also led him to consider the 
nature of agency, the capacity for organisms to act on their own behalf and to attri-
bute meaning to their actions and those of others. This is a key concept both in biol-
ogy and in sociology. In his view, agency is present in very tiny organisms – he has 
suggested that “a minimal molecular agent is a system which can reproduce itself 
and carry out at least one work cycle in the thermodynamic sense” (Kauffman 2007, 
p. 909). If this is true, it would mean that the capacity for independent action, and 
therefore to some extent thought, would be present not just in humans and the higher 
animals but even in many bacteria, something that has profound philosophical 
implications.
Kauffman has never been religiously observant, and once described himself as “a 
Jewish fruit fly geneticist who doesn’t believe in God” (Ireland 2009), yet his recent 
writings have often been theological in character. Ultimately, he suggests, his under-
standing of the universe is essentially a spiritual one, that “points to a new vision of 
24  Stuart Kauffman

249
our co-creating reality, that it invites precisely an enhancement of our sense of spiri-
tuality, reverence, wonder, and responsibility” (Kauffman 2007, p. 914). He has 
written in a number of works of the importance of ‘reinventing the sacred’, of find-
ing a form of science which goes beyond reductionism and incorporates emergence, 
to experience awe and reverence before “the natural creativity in the universe” 
(Kauffman 2008, p. xii), which he refers to as God although distinguishing this from 
the personal God found in many religions.
He argues that this view of the sacred can lead to “the construction of a global 
ethic, and help us to create a vision and reality of an emerging global civilization 
forever diverse, creative, and tolerant—a new Eden, a new Enlightenment” 
(Kauffman 2008, p. 282), which as Nürnberger (2011) observes is very close to the 
interfaith ethical framework promoted by the Christian theologian Hans Küng. In 
his most recent work, Kauffman has built upon his idea of the adjacent possible and 
the tension between religion and science to build a model of the way humanity 
coexists with the world and to seek “the fullness of life in a creative universe … 
[hoping to] rethink ourselves and our world and feel invited to co-create and evolve 
toward a new interwoven civilization beyond our own” (Kauffman 2016, pp. 
xii–xiii).
Stuart Kauffman has made enormous contributions to the way we view complex 
systems and evolution. His work has far-reaching consequences, and his methods of 
modelling intricate networks of interacting agents are useful in a wide range of set-
tings. His is a truly original and innovative mind.

The vast mystery of biology is that life should have emerged at all, that the order 
we see should have come to pass. A theory of emergence would account for the 
creation of the stunning order out our windows as a natural expression of some 
underlying laws. It would tell us if we are at home in the universe, expected in it, 
rather than present despite overwhelming odds.
Some words or phrases are evocative, even provocative. So it is with the word 
emergent. Commonly, we express this idea with the sentence, The whole is greater 
than the sum of its parts. The sentence is provocative, for what extra can be in the 
whole that is not in the parts? I believe that life itself is an emergent phenomenon, 
but I mean nothing mystical by this. [Later], I shall be at pains to give good reasons 
to believe that sufficiently complex mixes of chemicals can spontaneously crystal-
lize into systems with the ability to collectively catalyze the network of chemical

reactions by which the molecules themselves are formed. Such collectively auto-
catalytic sets sustain themselves and reproduce. This is no less than what we call a 
living metabolism, the tangle of chemical reactions that power every one of our 
cells. Life, in this view, is an emergent phenomenon arising as the molecular diver-
sity of a prebiotic chemical system increases beyond a threshold of complexity. If 
true, then life is not located in the property of any single molecule – in the details – 
but is a collective property of systems of interacting molecules. Life, in this view, 
emerged whole and has always remained whole. Life, in this view, is not to be 
located in its parts, but in the collective emergent properties of the whole they cre-
ate. Although life as an emergent phenomenon may be profound, its fundamental 
holism and emergence are not at all mysterious. A set of molecules either does or 
does not have the property that it is able to catalyze its own formation and reproduc-
tion from some simple food molecules. No vital force or extra substance is present 
in the emergent, self-reproducing whole. But the collective system does possess a 
stunning property not possessed by any of its parts. It is able to reproduce itself and 
to evolve. The collective system is alive. Its parts are just chemicals.
[…]
The network within each cell of any contemporary organism is the result of at 
least 1 billion years of evolution. Most biologists, heritors of the Darwinian tradi-
tion, suppose that the order of ontogeny is due to the grinding away of a molecular 
Rube Goldberg machine, slapped together piece by piece by evolution. I present a 
countering thesis: most of the beautiful order seen in ontogeny is spontaneous, a 
natural expression of the stunning self-organization that abounds in very complex 
regulatory networks. We appear to have been profoundly wrong. Order, vast and 
generative, arises naturally.
The emergent order seen in genomic networks foretells a conceptual struggle, 
perhaps even a conceptual revolution, in evolutionary theory. In this book, I propose 
that much of the order in organisms may not be the result of selection at all, but of 
the spontaneous order of self-organized systems. Order, vast and generative, not 
fought for against the entropic tides but freely available, undergirds all subsequent 
biological evolution. The order of organisms is natural, not merely the unexpected 
triumph of natural selection.
[…]
This is a massive and difficult theme. We are just beginning to embrace it. In this 
new view of life, organisms are not merely tinkered-together contraptions, brico-
lage, in Jacob’s phrase. Evolution is not merely “chance caught on the wing”, in 
Monod’s evocative image. The history of life captures the natural order, on which 
selection is privileged to act. If this idea is true, many features of organisms are not 
merely historical accidents, but also reflections of the profound order that evolution 
has further molded. If true, we are at home in the universe in ways not imagined 
since Darwin stood natural theology on its head with his blind watchmaker.
Yet more is presaged by self-organization. I said we must encompass the roles of 
both self-organization and Darwinian selection in evolution. But these sources of 
order may meld in complex ways that we hardly begin to understand. No theory in 
physics, chemistry, biology, or elsewhere has yet brokered this marriage. We must

think anew. Among the progeny of this mating of self-organization and selection 
may be new universal laws.
It is perhaps astonishing, perhaps hopeful and wonderful, that we might even 
now begin to frame possible universal laws governing this proposed union. For what 
can the teeming molecules that hustled themselves into self-reproducing metabo-
lisms, the cells coordinating their behaviors to form multicelled organisms, the eco-
systems, and even economic and political systems have in common? The wonderful 
possibility, to be held as a working hypothesis, bold but fragile, is that on many 
fronts, life evolves toward a regime that is poised between order and chaos. The 
evocative phrase that points to this working hypothesis is this: life exists at the edge 
of chaos. Borrowing a metaphor from physics, life may exist near a kind of phase 
transition. Water exists in three phases: solid ice, liquid water, and gaseous steam. It 
now begins to appear that similar ideas might apply to complex adapting systems. 
For example, we will see that the genomic networks that control development from 
zygote to adult can exist in three major regimes: a frozen ordered regime, a gaseous 
chaotic regime, and a kind of liquid regime located in the region between order and 
chaos. It is a lovely hypothesis, with considerable supporting data, that genomic 
systems lie in the ordered regime near the phase transition to chaos. Were such sys-
tems too deeply into the frozen ordered regime, they would be too rigid to coordi-
nate the complex sequences of genetic activities necessary for development. Were 
they too far into the gaseous chaotic regime, they would not be orderly enough. 
Networks in the regime near the edge of chaos – this compromise between order and 
surprise – appear best able to coordinate complex activities and best able to evolve 
as well. It is a very attractive hypothesis that natural selection achieves genetic regu-
latory networks that lie near the edge of chaos. Much of this book is bent on explor-
ing this theme.
Evolution is a story of organisms adapting by genetic changes, seeking to 
improve their fitness. Biologists have long harbored images of fitness landscapes, 
where the peaks represent high fitness, and populations wander under the drives of 
mutation, selection, and random drift across the landscape seeking peaks, but per-
haps never achieving them. The idea of fitness peaks applies at many levels. For 
example, it can refer to the capacity of a protein molecule to catalyze a given chemi-
cal reaction. Then peaks of the landscape correspond to enzymes that are better 
catalysts for this reaction than all their neighboring proteins – those in the foothills 
and, worst of all, those in the valleys. Fitness peaks can also refer to the fitness of 
whole organisms. In that more complex case, an organism with a given set of traits 
is fitter – higher on the landscape – than all its near variants if, roughly speaking, it 
is more likely to have offspring.
We will find in this book that whether we are talking about organisms or econo-
mies, surprisingly general laws govern adaptive processes on multipeaked fitness 
landscapes. These general laws may account for phenomena ranging from the burst 
of the Cambrian explosion in biological evolution, where taxa fill in from the top 
down, to technological evolution, where striking variations arise early and dwindle 
to minor improvements. The edge-of-chaos theme also arises as a potential general 
law. In scaling the top of the fitness peaks, adapting populations that are too method-

ical and timid in their explorations are likely to get stuck in the foothills, thinking 
they have reached as high as they can go; but a search that is too wide ranging is also 
likely to fail. The best exploration of an evolutionary space occurs at a kind of phase 
transition between order and disorder, when populations begin to melt off the local 
peaks they have become fixated on and flow along ridges toward distant regions of 
higher fitness.
The edge-of-chaos image arises in coevolution as well, for as we evolve, so do 
our competitors; to remain fit, we must adapt to their adaptations. In coevolving 
systems, each partner clambers up its fitness landscape toward fitness peaks, even as 
that landscape is constantly deformed by the adaptive moves of its coevolutionary 
partners. Strikingly, such coevolving systems also behave in an ordered regime, a 
chaotic regime, and a transition regime. It is almost spooky that such systems seem 
to coevolve to the regime at the edge of chaos. As if by an invisible hand, each 
adapting species acts according to its own selfish advantage, yet the entire system 
appears magically to evolve to a poised state where, on average, each does as best 
as can be expected. Yet, as in many of the dynamical systems we will study in this 
book, each is eventually driven to extinction, despite its own best efforts, by the col-
lective behavior of the system as a whole.
As we shall see, technological evolution may be governed by laws similar to 
those governing prebiotic chemical evolution and adaptive coevolution. The origin 
of life at a threshold of chemical diversity follows the same logic as a theory of 
economic takeoff at a threshold of diversity of goods and services. Above that criti-
cal diversity, new species of molecules, or goods and services, afford niches for yet 
further new species, which are awakened into existence in an explosion of possibili-
ties. Like coevolutionary systems, economic systems link the selfish activities of 
more or less myopic agents. Adaptive moves in biological evolution and technologi-
cal evolution drive avalanches of speciation and extinction. In both cases, as if by an 
invisible hand, the system may tune itself to the poised edge of chaos where all 
players fare as well as possible, but ultimately exit the stage.
The edge of chaos may even provide a deep new understanding of the logic of 
democracy. We have enshrined democracy as our secular religion; we argue its 
moral and rational foundations, and base our lives on it. We hope that our heritage 
of democracy will spill out its abundance of freedom over the globe. And in the fol-
lowing chapters we will find surprising new grounds for the secular wisdom of 
democracy in its capacity to solve extremely hard problems characterized by inter-
twining webs of conflicting interests. People organize into communities, each of 
which acts for its own benefit, jockeying to seek compromises among conflicting 
interests. This seemingly haphazard process also shows an ordered regime where 
poor compromises are found quickly, a chaotic regime where no compromise is ever 
settled on, and a phase transition where compromises are achieved, but not quickly. 
The best compromises appear to occur at the phase transition between order and 
chaos. Thus we will see hints of an apologia for a pluralistic society as the natural 
design for adaptive compromise. Democracy may be far and away the best process 
to solve the complex problems of a complex evolving society, to find the peaks on 
the coevolutionary landscape where, on average, all have a chance to prosper.

Chapter 25
James Lovelock
James Lovelock is an unusual figure in the sometimes rather homogeneous world of 
science. In a scientific community founded on team working and institutions, he 
works alone from his rural home. While many start from others’ work and are con-
tent to make advances through small steps, he is deeply committed to starting from 
experimental data and drawing his own, often radical, conclusions. Lovelock writes 
in a highly accessible, almost poetic fashion, and is famous for his adoption of a 
vivid metaphor (Gaia) to describe his ideas; yet he has worked for decades carrying 
out detailed experimental science and even designing and building innovative 
instruments for his experiments. He is one of the UK’s most eminent scientists, has 
been a Fellow of the Royal Society since 1974 and received several prestigious 
international awards, yet he is regarded sceptically by some of the scientific estab-
lishment. He is deeply involved in the environmental movement and has inspired 
many people in it, but he is also held in considerable suspicion by many 
environmentalists.
Lovelock’s greatest contribution is in the development of Gaia theory – that the 
Earth (including the physical planet and all living organisms) can be considered as 
a single self-organising system. He has derived the theory from studies of the behav-
iour of the Earth’s atmosphere, by comparisons with other planets, and backed it up 
by computer modelling. He has applied this theory to how humans need to behave 
to preserve conditions that make life possible on Earth, describing himself as “a 
planetary physician whose patient, the living Earth, complains of fever” (Lovelock 
2006, p. 1).
Lovelock’s work is an excellent example of applying a systems approach to a 
very large-scale situation, resulting in both a well-founded theory and clear recom-
mendations for action. In its blend of cybernetics and physical science, and its focus 
on self-organisation, it has clear connections with complexity theory. Indeed, in his 
book on complex biological and ecological systems, Capra has described Gaia the-
ory as “perhaps the most surprising and most beautiful expression of self-­
organisation” (Capra 1996, p. 100). Capra also draws a close parallel between Gaia 
theory and autopoiesis, arguing that Gaia is self-bounded, self-generating and self-­

perpetuating, as did Lovelock’s colleague Lynn Margulis (1997, p. 280), who wrote 
that “life does not ‘adapt to’ a passive physiochemical environment, as the neo-­
Darwinists assume; rather, life actively ‘produces and modifies’ its surroundings”.
James Ephraim Lovelock was born in 1919 in Letchworth, UK, and grew up in 
Brixton, south London, at the time an area of heavy pollution from coal fires, some-
thing that would shape his later environmental awareness. On leaving school, he 
initially worked as an apprentice to a firm carrying out chemical work under con-
tract to a range of organisations, during which he learned many experimental skills 
and a sense of himself as a problem-solving scientist. He took a degree in chemistry 
at Manchester University, graduating in 1941. During the Second World War, he 
was a registered conscientious objector. After graduating, he started work for the 
Medical Research Council at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, 
where he worked for the next 20 years (apart from a spell of 5 years at the Common 
Cold Research Unit in Salisbury and two sabbatical years in the USA). During this 
time he took his Ph.D. at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in 
1948; he also later gained a D.Sc. degree from London University.
Lovelock’s work as a medical researcher was concerned with many topics, nota-
bly the effects of air pollution and the preservation of blood cells through freezing. 
A constant theme, however, was his development of scientific equipment – a large 
range of instruments to detect various chemicals in the air and elsewhere. Most 
notable of these was the electron capture detector (ECD), the development of which 
he has described as “perhaps the most important event in my life as a scientist” 
(Lovelock 2000, p. 191).
The ECD is small, easy to build, and when developed in the late 1950s, it was 
thousands of times more sensitive than other available detectors in its field of gas 
chromatography. It is especially sensitive to the presence of certain polluting chemi-
cals, such as DDT and CFCs. This device had a crucial impact upon the establish-
ment of a sound scientific basis for the environmental movement. Data collected 
using the ECD (by Lovelock and others) was foundational in establishing the case 
put forward in the 1960s by Rachel Carson in her book Silent Spring (Carson 1962) 
for the banning of DDT as a pesticide, and later for establishing the effect of CFCs 
on the ozone layer and the subsequent worldwide ban of CFCs in aerosols and 
refrigerators. Lovelock however was sceptical for some years about the impact of 
CFCs and even acted as a consultant to the chemical industry during the 1970s when 
scientific debates on the ozone layer were at their height. Despite the ECD’s consid-
erable success, Lovelock received no money from its patent, as he developed it in its 
final form and first published a paper on its working while on sabbatical at Yale 
University, and the US government demanded that he assign the patent rights 
to them.
On leaving the National Institute for Medical Research in 1961, Lovelock was 
based for 3 years in the USA, at Baylor University in Houston, while conducting 
much of his research in California, at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). He 
saw his time in Houston as a stepping-stone to the practice of independent science, 
and he has worked independently from his own home since then (he has lived for 
many years in small villages in the south-west of England, valuing their combina-

tion of isolation and community). His work has been funded through a series of 
consultancies, with organisations including NASA, the Chemical Manufacturers 
Association, Shell (for whom he was a scientific consultant for 30 years), Hewlett-­
Packard (who develop many scientific instruments and were interested in his ECD 
work), and the UK Ministry of Defence (for whom he worked on chemical detectors 
used for tracking by the security services).
He has described as his motivation for working as an independent scientist that 
“science was and is my passion and I wanted to be free to do it unfettered by direc-
tion from anyone, not even by the mild constraints of a university department or an 
institute of science” (Lovelock 2000, p. 2). He did, however, keep close academic 
links, in particular as a visiting professor at the Department of Cybernetics at 
Reading University for 25 years, and also at the University of Houston, and Green 
College, Oxford. Independent working and a fiercely independent mind go hand-in-­
hand for Lovelock; both have allowed him the freedom to challenge long-held 
beliefs and come to radical conclusions. His independence of mind has served him 
well in very many ways and allowed him to express issues, invent devices and for-
mulate theories far beyond the accepted norms, although it may have contributed to 
distrust from those who are used to judging scientists based on their membership of 
particular research institutions.
Lovelock spent much of his time at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory working on 
instruments for planned NASA missions to the Moon and Mars. It was while he was 
working on the detection of life on Mars that he had the initial insight that led to the 
development of Gaia theory. One afternoon in the autumn of 1965, he was given 
new data giving a detailed analysis of the chemical composition of the atmospheres 
of Mars and Venus. These atmospheres exist in a state of complete chemical equi-
librium – in the absence of life, all possible chemical reactions have already hap-
pened. The atmosphere of the Earth, by contrast, is very different. Much later, 
Lovelock described his initial perception in poetic language:
Chance favoured me with a view of the Earth from space and I saw it as the stunningly 
beautiful anomaly of the solar system…. I saw it as a planet that has always, since its origins 
nearly four billion years ago, kept itself a fit home for the life that happened upon it and I 
thought that it did so by homeostasis, the wisdom of the body, just as you and I keep our 
temperature and chemistry constant. In this view the spontaneous evolution of life did more 
than make Darwin’s world: it started a joint project with the evolving Earth itself. (Lovelock 
2000, p. 2)
Lovelock’s initial perception was that the Earth formed some kind of self-regu-
lating system with organisms on the planet forming a key part in the process of regu-
lation – in his early formulation, the Earth is “a cybernetic planetary system with 
homeostatic tendencies” (quoted in Sagan and Margulis 1997, p. 202). It took a 
number of years for this initial concept to develop further, through his own studies 
of the atmosphere and through his work with the biologist Lynn Margulis, who 
contributed a deep understanding of life on earth, especially micro-organisms. 
Putting these insights from biology and chemistry together enabled Lovelock and 
Margulis to form what was referred to as the Gaia hypothesis: that “the temperature, 
oxidation state, acidity, and certain aspects of the rocks and waters are at any time 
25  James Lovelock

kept constant, and that this homeostasis is maintained by the organisms at the 
Earth’s surface” (Lovelock 1995, p. 19).
The Gaia hypothesis was initially published in a series of papers in fairly obscure 
scientific journals. It became widely known when Lovelock published the work in a 
book, Gaia (Lovelock 1979), which was read both in scientific circles and more 
broadly by environmentalists and the general public. The concept became quickly 
taken up and widely accepted by the environmental movement, for whom it was a 
way of describing the Earth as a whole entity, deeply interconnected – an equivalent 
of the image of the planet from space that had appeared from early space missions 
(and which had also inspired Lovelock).
In the scientific community, the Gaia hypothesis was very controversial. Although 
it has many respectable scientific antecedents, beginning with the pioneering eigh-
teenth century geologist James Hutton, it was seen as very radical. The biologists 
Ford Doolittle and Richard Dawkins published very strong attacks on Lovelock’s 
book, although Doolittle (2017) has more recently sought to reconcile Darwinism 
and Gaia theory. This was partly due to the holistic nature of the theory, so very dif-
ferent from the reductionism that was at the core of the then-dominant strands in 
biology – neo-Darwinism and molecular biology. It also reflected what Lovelock 
was later to acknowledge as an error in the hypothesis, which sought to locate the 
regulatory part of the planetary system (that is, its control system) solely in the liv-
ing parts of the Earth. As Lovelock later wrote, “the worst thing that can happen to 
a new theory is for it to be ignored … [these criticisms] hurt at the time – 1979 to 
1982 – but they made me think and tighten what had been a loose hypothesis into a 
firm theory” (Lovelock 2000, p. xii).
The controversy over the Gaia hypothesis led Lovelock and Margulis to develop 
Gaia theory in two important ways. First, through further experiments they widened 
the scope of the control system so that it included the wider planetary environment, 
such as the atmosphere and rocks, in a series of richer and more complex feedback 
loops. Second, Lovelock constructed a computer model, Daisyworld, of a planet 
where life consists only of white and black daisies existing on various zones of the 
planet and evolving in tandem with the planetary ecosystem. Daisyworld resembles 
closely the computer models of complex systems built at the Santa Fe Institute 
(described in the chapter on Stuart Kauffman) and clearly demonstrates the way in 
which complex interactions between life and the physical aspects of a planet can 
arise as an emergent property from very simple initial starting conditions.
An important aspect of the scientific, and wider, reaction to Gaia theory has been 
the name. Gaia was the name of the Greek goddess of the Earth, and the commonal-
ity of names has led some to believe that Lovelock is claiming that the Earth should 
be regarded as divine, or at least as having a personality. For some in the New Age 
movement, this is seen as positive and inspiring; for others, including many scien-
tists, it is somewhat disturbing. The name is intended to be a metaphor, and was 
suggested to Lovelock by his friend and one-time neighbour, the novelist William 
Golding, who while walking with Lovelock said that “for so grand an idea you need 
a grand name. You must call it Gaia” (quoted in R. Lewin 1999, p. 113). Partly due 
to dissatisfaction with the name, and partly due to the incorporation of other con-
25  James Lovelock

259
cepts, Gaia theory is now often known as Earth System Science (Lenton 2016), or 
sometimes as geophysiology.
Gaia theory  – or at least the concept of the complete Earth forming a self-­
regulating system – has become increasingly respected within the scientific com-
munity. Indeed, the prominent French sociologist of science Bruno Latour, who has 
written extensively on Gaia theory, argues that “Lovelock’s theory holds equal place 
in the history of human knowledge to that of Galileo” (Latour 2018). Moreover, 
Latour argues that Lovelock’s work rests on an approach where “the distinction 
between the inside and the outside of any given entity will be erased” (Latour 2017, 
p. 72), i.e. that the distinction between a system and its environment is removed. 
Likewise, the philosopher of science Mary Midgley argued strongly for the impor-
tance of Gaia theory as a way of bringing a key epistemological shift into scientific 
discourse – the removal of the individual entity as the central figure, in favour of 
relationships and wider systems. As she vividly writes, “wholes and parts are 
equally real” (Midgley 2001, p.186).
Lovelock has a very mixed relationship with the environmental movement. As 
discussed above, both Gaia theory and the ECD have inspired a number of impor-
tant and successful environment campaigns. However, he holds views that are at 
odds with many environmentalists, in particular his advocacy of nuclear power as 
being less damaging than fossil fuels. And yet he is firmly devoted to environmental 
change. In his recent writing, he has embraced the concept of the Anthropocene 
(that the Earth is in a new geological age where human activity is central) and com-
bined it with a form of technological optimism, to argue for humanity’s “irreplace-
able value to the Earth, to Gaia … preserving life on earth in some form is the 
challenge for, and responsibility of, humankind now” (Lovelock 2014, p. xvi).
Many of the thinkers in this book have been celebrated upon their 100th birthday, 
but almost all posthumously. Lovelock was present at his 100th birthday conference 
at the University of Exeter in July 2019. He published a book the same year arguing 
for the harnessing of artificial intelligence towards the continuance of life on earth, 
writing that:
Gaia must continue her work of cooling the planet, because it is now old and frail. With age, 
as I am all too well aware, we become more fragile. The same is true for Gaia. She could 
now be destroyed by shocks to her system which, in previous ages, she would have simply 
shrugged off. I am pretty sure that only Earth has incubated a creature capable of knowing 
the cosmos. But I am equally sure that the existence of that creature is imperilled. We are 
unique, privileged beings and, for that reason, should cherish every moment of our aware-
ness. (Lovelock 2019, p. 5)

In 1925 the American scientist Alfred Lotka published a small but important 
book, Physical Biology. In it he wrote: “It is not so much the organism or the species 
that evolves, but the entire system, species and environment. The two are insepara-
ble.” As a follower of Lotka, I want to consider extinction in the context of an evo-
lutionary science that is as much about the rocks and oceans as about the living 
things that inhabit them. In this view what evolves is an ‘Earth system’ that can 
move gradually for long periods under an ever-warming sun. But as it evolves, sud-
den changes punctuate its gradual evolution: such as the appearance of oxygen, a 
glaciation, a species like humans, or the impact of tiny planets. Whether internally 
or externally driven, these events change the whole system.
Lotka’s view of evolution passed almost unnoticed in his time and it was not until 
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in the 1960s began 
exploring our planetary neighbourhood that this broader, transdisciplinary, view of 
the Earth was revisited. As part of NASA’s exploration team, it led me to propose, 
in a paper in Nature in 1965, that life and its environment are so closely coupled that 
the presence of life on a planet could be detected merely by analysing chemically 
the composition of its atmosphere. This proposal is now part of NASA’s astrobiol-
ogy programme and they aim to use it in the search for life on extra-solar planets.
When we look at the Earth we see an atmosphere that, apart from the noble 
gases, has a composition almost wholly determined by the organisms at the surface. 
If some catastrophe removed all life from the Earth without changing anything else, 
the atmosphere and surface chemistry would rapidly – in geological terms – move 
to a state similar to those of Mars or Venus. These are dry planets with atmospheres 
dominated by carbon dioxide and close to the chemical equilibrium state. By con-
trast, we have a cool wet planet with an unstable atmosphere that stays constant and 
always fit for life. The odds against this are close to infinity.
Science is about probabilities, so we are forced to consider the difficult but more 
probable alternative: something regulates the atmosphere. What is it? It has to be 
something connected with life at the surface, because we know that the atmospheric 
gases, oxygen, methane and nitrous oxide, are almost wholly biological products, 
while others, nitrogen and carbon dioxide, have been massively changed in 
­abundance by organisms. Moreover, the climate depends on atmospheric composi-
tion and there is evidence that the Earth has kept a fairly comfortable climate ever 
since life began, in spite of a 30% increase in solar luminosity. Together these facts 
led me to propose, in a 1969 paper in the JAAS (Journal of the American 
Astronautical Society), that the biosphere was regulating the atmosphere in its own 
interests. Two years later I started collaborating with Lynn Margulis and we pub-
lished a paper in Tellus where we stated: “The Gaia hypothesis views the biosphere 
as an active adaptive control system able to maintain the Earth in homeostasis”.
This idea was so contradictory to the views of evolutionary biologists that it was 
not long before Ford Doolittle, Richard Dawkins and other biologists challenged it. 
They pointed out that global regulation by the organisms could never have evolved, 
because the organism itself was the unit of selection, not the Earth. In time I found 
myself agreeing with them. They were right: there was no way for organisms by 
themselves to evolve so that they could regulate the global environment. But, I won-

dered, could the whole system, organisms and environment together, evolve self-­
regulation? In 1981 I redrafted the hypothesis as an evolutionary model, 
‘Daisyworld’, that was intended to show that self-regulation can take place on a 
planet where organisms evolve by natural selection in a responsive environment. 
Following the model, the Gaia hypothesis was restated as follows: “The evolution 
of organisms and their material environment proceeds as a single tight-coupled pro-
cess from which self-regulation of the environment at a habitable state appears as an 
emergent phenomenon”.
At about the same time, Andrew Watson, Mike Whitfield and I discovered the 
first mechanism for climate control by the Earth system, namely the biologically 
assisted reaction between atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and calcium silicate in 
soil and on rocks. This process can regulate both climate and CO2 at a level com-
fortable for plants. Soon other putative regulation mechanisms were discovered, 
such as the connection between ocean algae, dimethyl sulphide gas, clouds and 
climate. By the end of the 1980s there were sufficient evidence and models of the 
hypothetical system to justify calling it Gaia Theory.
Despite this, in the biological community Gaia Theory was almost wholly 
rejected, and Earth system science was ignored so far as evolution was concerned. 
Then in the mid-1990s William Hamilton became interested in Gaia theory. He 
accepted what was by then the strong evidence that the environment was regulated 
at a state comfortable for the biota. He saw it as a challenge to explain how this 
could be a consequence of evolution through natural selection. He published (with 
Tim Lenton) one paper on the cloud algal system, and his colleague Peter Henderson 
continues to model systems of biological evolution that include the material 
environment.
So what bearing does this new view of evolution have on the current mass extinc-
tion and what practical use is it?
	1.	 It draws our attention to the biological infrastructure of the Earth, namely the 
micro-organisms. Lynn Margulis first pointed out their significance and that they 
still play an important, if not major part, in planetary regulation. Bacteria were 
the whole biosphere for 3 billion years before multi-cellular organisms such as 
humans and trees came on the scene.
	2.	 In the real world, organisms grow in a material environment where growth is 
strongly constrained by the laws of physics and chemistry. When these con-
straints are included in evolutionary biology models, it becomes possible to build 
a wide range of stable model systems. These models offer insight into the nature 
of the Earth system and into the need for biodiversity. Biodiversity is usually 
valued for its aesthetic or human medicinal qualities; we think that biodiversity 
is an important part of planetary self-regulation.
	3.	 We see the interglacial period that we are now in as a pathological state of the 
Earth system and see the ice ages as the normal state of the Earth system. In the 
present interglacial, all of the regulation systems we have so far discovered 
appear to be in positive feedback towards climate change. This means that any 
change, either to hotter or colder, is amplified not resisted. This is true of the

mechanisms for pumping down CO2 from the atmosphere, for cloud production 
by algae, and for the Daisyworld-like behaviour of the boreal and tropical for-
ests. In addition, geophysical feedbacks, such as the effect of ice cover, are posi-
tive. An interglacial like now is a period when regulation has temporarily failed 
and is certainly no time to add more greenhouse gases or deplete biodiversity.
We are living in the midst of a great extinction, where the number of species is 
declining at a rate comparable in intensity with the extinctions that punctuate the 
geological record, such as that when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. 
There is concern about the disappearance of plant and animal species from the equa-
torial regions, which are sometimes taken as representative of the natural state of the 
Earth. These tropical regions are indeed biodiverse, but I wonder if, instead of 
regarding this as a natural state, we should regard biodiversity as an indication that 
the Earth itself is continuously, but gently, perturbed. Even the single environmental 
variable, temperature, is perturbed on the short timescale of diurnal change, and 
through the yearly march of the seasons, to the alternation of glaciations with warm 
periods like now.
Models that Stephan Harding and I have made suggest that biodiversity is a 
symptom of perturbation during a state of comparative health. What seems impor-
tant for sustenance is not so much biodiversity as such, but potential biodiversity, 
the capacity of a healthy system to respond through diversification when the need 
arises. In tropical forest and other regions under threat, destroying diversity will 
reduce the numbers of rare species. Among them may be those able to flourish and 
sustain the ecosystem when the next large environmental change takes place. It is 
the loss of diversity and the loss of the potential of the region to sustain biodiversity, 
that makes the large-scale replacement of natural ecosystems with farmland so 
dubious an act.
Gaia theory is not contrary to Darwin’s great vision; it is like neo-Darwinism, a 
new look at Darwin’s evolutionary theory. I suspect it will be some time before 
biologists and geologists collaborate closely enough for us to see the emergence of 
a truly unified Earth system science. William Hamilton, in a television interview, 
referred to the Gaian view of evolution as Copernican, but he added, “We await a 
Newton to explain how it works.”

Chapter 26
Kurt Lewin
Kurt Lewin was a visionary and deeply original thinker. He was highly committed 
both to social change and to developing theories about human behaviour, summing 
up the connection between the two in writing that “there is nothing so practical as a 
good theory” (Lewin 1951, p. 169). The list of ideas that he originated is long, nota-
bly including group dynamics and action research; he also had a huge impact 
through institutions he founded, projects he worked on, and students he taught. 
Lewin can also been seen as a key bridge between Gestalt psychology and several 
early traditions in systems thinking. He is often described as the founder of social 
psychology, although as Billing (2015) observes, while textbooks in that field fre-
quently credit his work, they often over-simplify his ideas. Burnes (2004, p. 981) 
has summed up his interests and values as follows:
Lewin was a humanitarian who believed that only by resolving social conflict, whether it be 
religious, racial, marital or industrial, could the human condition be improved. Lewin 
believed that the key to resolving social conflict was to facilitate learning and so enable 
individuals to understand and restructure their perceptions of the world around them.
Lewin was born in 1890 in the village of Moglino, then part of Germany but now 
in Poland; his family moved to Berlin when he was 15. He was Jewish, at a time 
when anti-Semitism was growing within Germany. His personal experience of anti-­
Semitism gave him a lifelong passion for minority rights and also instilled in him a 
desire for social change. As a student he became involved in the socialist movement, 
working for stronger rights for Jewish people and women and for the ­democratisation 
of German institutions. At this time he also became involved in adult education for 
working-class men and women. Many of these concerns would stay with him for the 
rest of his life.
Most of Lewin’s university studies were in psychology at the University of Berlin 
(following studies at the Universities of Freiburg and Munich in medicine and biol-
ogy). He graduated with his Ph.D. in 1916, although his studies were interrupted by 
the First World War – he served the whole war in the German army, during which 
time he was injured and was awarded the Iron Cross.

268
Lewin’s Ph.D. supervisor was Carl Stumpf, founder of the Psychological Institute 
at the University of Berlin and a pioneer of experimental psychology, and Lewin 
carried on to teach and research at the Psychological Institute. Among Stumpf’s 
other doctoral students were the founders of Gestalt psychology – Max Wertheimer, 
Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Köhler – all of whom were working in Berlin at the same 
time as Lewin.
Gestalt psychology emphasised the patterns (Gestalten in German) through 
which psychological phenomena  – notably perceptions  – were organised in the 
mind. The Gestalt theorists held that these patterns of organisation were much more 
important than the individual elements, that when we perceive (say) a collection of 
dots we see the pattern of the dots more readily than the individual dots. Gestalt 
psychologists demonstrated these phenomena experimentally, using tools such as 
the famous ‘figure-ground’ images which shift back and forwards between two dif-
ferent interpretations (e.g. a vase and two faces in profile). Gestalt theory can read-
ily be taken as a precursor to systems thinking, with its emphasis on the whole 
rather than the parts and on the organisation of the whole (a theme later taken up at 
length by Ludwig von Bertalanffy). Indeed, Koffka (1935, p.  176), building on 
Aristotle’s famous saying that the whole is greater the sum of its parts, wrote that “It 
has been said: The whole is more than the sum of its parts. It is more correct to say 
that the whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing up is a 
meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.”
Lewin worked closely with the Gestalt theorists, and is often considered among 
their number, but had somewhat different interests from the mainstream of Gestalt 
theory. While he shared their basic view of the importance of pattern and organisa-
tion, he was more interested in human needs and motivations than perception, and 
in the application of psychology to practical problems rather than studies for their 
own sake. As early as 1920, Lewin wrote an article on the ‘socialization of the 
Taylor system’ (the highly mechanistic work of Frederick Taylor on workplace effi-
ciency, later called scientific management), arguing in favour of the involvement of 
workers in the planning of their work; and in the mid-1920s he carried out two 
lengthy field studies, in a wallpaper firm and in a textile mill (John et al. 1989). 
While Lewin continued to carry out laboratory-based experiments as well through-
out the 1920s, the use of studies in real settings was firmly established in his work.
The result of Lewin’s early work was the development of his highly innovative 
approach to psychological dynamics, known as field theory. A field is “the totality 
of coexisting facts which are conceived of as mutually interdependent” (Lewin 
1951, p. 240) – all the factors in the environment of an individual or group which 
influence their behaviour. Lewin saw individual behaviour as a function both of the 
person and of the environment in which it occurred, expressed in his celebrated 
formula B = f(P,E). A key aspect of field theory is its use of detailed diagrams, 
derived from the mathematical principles of topology, to represent the different 
regions of an individual’s personality. More broadly, Lewin referred to the combina-
tion of the individual and the environment affecting their personality and behaviour 
as their life space. Lewin also used diagrammatic forms – force-field diagrams – to 
represent the forces relating to change in a given situation, both ‘driving forces’ and 
26  Kurt Lewin

269
‘resisting forces’. Force-field analysis, the approach of analysing driving and resist-
ing forces in a change situation, has been used considerably in management consult-
ing, forming one of the key elements of scenario planning. It is notable that, as 
Burnes and Bargal (2017, p. 93) argue, “at the time of his death, the most developed 
area of his work was field theory and his primary focus was not organizational 
change per se, but the broader aim of resolving social conflict”.
Although Lewin’s quasi-mathematical use of formulae and diagrams has largely 
fallen out of favour in social psychology, many of the concepts he introduced 
through field theory, including his use of boundary, dynamics and life space, have 
become widely used. An important and influential aspect of field theory was its 
holistic research method: to start from a description of the whole situation (such as 
in a diagram) and progressively to analyse the parts of that description, as opposed 
to the more traditional scientific method of building up from an analysis of the indi-
vidual parts to a synthesis of the whole. Lewin described this method as being one 
“that seeks truth by successive approximations” (Argyris 1989, p. 97).
As the 1920s moved into the 1930s, Germany became an increasingly difficult 
place to be Jewish, and following a brief sabbatical in the United States, Lewin 
moved there in 1933 (the year Hitler became Chancellor). He was initially based as 
a refugee scholar at Cornell University, but moved in 1935 to Iowa University as 
professor of child psychology, where he was to spend the next 10 years and where 
he would develop some of his most influential work.
While at Iowa, he became increasingly concerned with applying field theory to 
the behaviour of groups as much as of individuals, an approach to which he gave the 
name group dynamics. This was a logical extension of his earlier observation of the 
importance of the environment upon an individual’s behaviour. Taking as an exam-
ple the position of Jews in various countries, Lewin observed that “it is not similar-
ity or dissimilarity of individuals that constitutes a group, but rather interdependence 
of fate” (Lewin 1948, p. 165). Group dynamics was also strongly connected for 
Lewin with the development of democracy in groups: one of the most famous stud-
ies carried out in his time at Iowa (along with his students Ronald Lippitt and Ralph 
White) demonstrated that children in play groups learnt and behaved much better 
under democratic styles of adult leadership as opposed to autocratic or laissez-faire 
styles (White and Lippitt 1960).
The rise of group dynamics reflected Lewin’s preferred way of working as well 
as his research interests. In both Berlin and Iowa, he gathered around him a group 
of students with whom he worked in a highly collaborative manner based on free 
discussion of research ideas, usually at a local restaurant or café. In Berlin, this 
group was known as the Quasselstrippe, from the German for ‘rambling strings’; in 
Iowa, it was called the Hot Air Club. As Pratkanis (1989, p. 565) notes, “often 
research ideas and proposals would emerge, prompting Lewin to frequently claim 
that he could think only in a group”. In this context, rather than in a formal lecture, 
he was a highly popular and influential teacher, and many of his students in both 
Germany and the United States were themselves later at the forefront of social psy-
chology. Schellenberg (1978, pp.  77–78) observes that this way of working 
“expressed as well a key element in his personal belief system. He had a profound 
26  Kurt Lewin

270
faith in democracy, which to him was … a way of life, based on mutual participation 
and continual interaction in decision making.”
Three factors in the conditions of the time in the United States led Lewin to for-
malise his lifetime goal of social change through social research: the difficult status 
of minorities (notably Jewish and black people) in a society so keen to espouse 
democratic values; the high value placed in American culture on applied research, 
in both society and industry; and the involvement of social theorists in a range of 
applied, interdisciplinary, projects in the Second World War. Notable projects in this 
area, among many others, included work (with Margaret Mead who was a friend of 
Lewin’s) on changing food habits to discourage eating of scarce foods during the 
war; the training of leaders in inter-group relations (especially involving minority 
ethnic groups) on behalf of the Connecticut State Inter-Racial Commission; and the 
setting up of the Commission of Community Interrelations on behalf of the American 
Jewish Congress, to study and influence racial and religious prejudice.
It was from these experiences that Lewin coined the term ‘action research’. 
Projects of this kind could be characterised, Lewin (1947, p. 150) argued as “a com-
parative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action, and 
research leading to social action – research that produces nothing but books will not 
suffice”. Thus theory led to action, and action led to theory. The research involved 
was not necessarily field-based – it could and even should involve laboratory experi-
ments – but it was clearly the case for him that “the problem of our own values, 
objectives, and of objectivity are nowhere more interwoven and more important 
than in action-research” (Lewin 1947, p. 153). Indeed, he summed up the basic 
conception of action research in the saying that “you cannot understand a system 
until you try to change it” (quoted by Schein 1996).
The cycle of activities that Lewin outlines for action research was later taken by 
David Kolb as the basis for his learning cycle, widely used in education. This model 
describes learning as a four-stage feedback cycle: concrete experience, observations 
and reflections, formations of abstracts concepts and generalisations, and testing 
implications of concepts in new situations. While this basic model is often referred 
to as the Kolb learning cycle, Kolb (1984, p. 21) himself refers to it as “the Lewinian 
experiential learning model”.
Lewin’s concern for social change led to the later development of a three-step 
model for how to change the behaviour of a group or organisation: unfreeze the 
group from its current ‘quasi-stationary equilibrium’ (Lewin’s term for the current 
state of a field with its driving and restraining forces); move the group to a new state 
through action research; and refreeze it at a new quasi-stationary equilibrium so it 
cannot return to its original state. This model became widely applied in organisa-
tional change, although later widely criticised as too simplistic and not reflective of 
organisational complexity. In fact, as Cummings et al. (2016) observe, the model is 
a much later derivation from Lewin’s ideas and he never wrote it in this form; thus 
the criticisms apply more to the later use of this model by other authors.

Lewin died suddenly of a massive heart attack, aged 57, in 1947. The final 2 years 
of his life were an extremely busy time of institution building and consolidation of 
his ideas. In 1945, he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he 
founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics (which continued and moved to 
the University of Michigan after his death, although the harsh political climate in 
the US in the late 1940s and early 1950s made social action much harder for his 
successors). He was very supportive of the founders of the Tavistock Institute of 
Human Relations in London (notably Eric Trist): “at least in the minds of the initial 
staff, Kurt Lewin was a ‘shadow founder’ of the Institute” (Neumann 2005, p. 119); 
plans were in place for him to spend the academic year 1947–1948, its first full year 
of operation, at the Tavistock. With colleagues at the Tavistock, he co-founded the 
important interdisciplinary journal of social science, Human Relations, although the 
first articles by him in that journal appeared posthumously.
The work he led at the Connecticut State Inter-Racial Commission in 1946 led to 
a breakthrough – the concept of leadership training incorporating reflective feed-
back sessions, based on dialogue between training staff and group participants, on 
the experience of being in the group. Drawing on the Connecticut experience, Lewin 
was involved in the design and planning for a National Training Laboratory in 
Group Development, which took place in Bethel, Maine in the summer of 1947 
(although Lewin himself had died by the time the event began). The success of this 
laboratory led to the formation of the National Training Laboratories (NTL) as an 
institute, through which many important innovations in organisational development 
took place, such as the ‘T-group’ (based directly on the training groups in 
Connecticut) and even the invention of the flipchart! Lewin’s influence and inspira-
tion can clearly be seen throughout the development of the NTL. The involvement 
of Chris Argyris with NTL and the inspiration he took from Lewin are described in 
the chapter on Argyris.
Lewin attended the first two Macy conferences on cybernetics in 1946, and was 
influenced by the developing concept of feedback. His formulation of action 
research (which first appeared in print in 1946) has a strongly cybernetic flavour. 
Indeed, Lewin’s use of the term feedback in the group dynamics work that led to the 
NTL was the source of the popular, somewhat inaccurate use of the term (as in ‘I 
must give you some feedback’).
Kurt Lewin was an extraordinary innovator both in terms of theoretical and 
methodological development, and of social change. His twin passions were summed 
up by his wife, in an introduction to a posthumous collection of his papers (G. Lewin, 
in Lewin 1948, p. xv):
Kurt Lewin was so constantly and predominantly preoccupied with the task of advancing 
the conceptual representation of the social-psychological world, and at the same time he 
was so filled with the urgent desire to use his theoretical insight for the building of a better 
world, that it is difficult to decide which of these two sources of motivation flowed with 
greater energy or vigour.

In the last year and a half I have had occasion to have contact with a great variety of 
organizations, institutions, and individuals who came for help in the field of group 
relations. They included representatives of communities, school systems, single 
schools, minority organizations of a variety of backgrounds and objectives; they 
included labor and management representatives, departments of the national and 
state governments, and so on.
Two basic facts emerged from these contacts: there exists a great amount of 
good-will, of readiness to face the problem squarely and really to do something 
about it. If this amount of serious good-will could be transformed into organized, 
efficient action, there would be no danger for inter-group relations in the United 
States. But exactly here lies the difficulty. These eager people feel themselves to be 
in the fog. They feel in the fog on three counts: (1) What is the present situation? (2) 
What are the dangers? (3) And most important of all, what shall we do?
We have been conducting an interview survey among workers in inter-group 
relations in the State of Connecticut. We wanted to know their line of thinking, their 
line of action, and the major barriers which they encounter. Not a few of those 
whose very job is the improvement of inter-group relations state that perhaps the 
greatest obstacle to their work is their own lack of clarity of what ought to be done. 
How is economic and social discrimination to be attacked if we think not in terms 
of generalities but in terms of the inhabitants of that particular main street and those 
side and end streets which make up that small or large town in which the individual 
group worker is supposed to do his job?
One of the consequences of this unclearness is the lack of standards by which to 
measure progress. When the inter-group worker, coming home from the good-will 
meeting which he helped to instigate, thinks of the dignitaries he was able to line up, 
the stirring appeals he heard, the impressive setting of the stage, and the good qual-
ity of the food, he cannot help feeling elated by the general atmosphere and the 
words of praise from his friends all around. Still, a few days later, when the next 
case of discrimination becomes known he often wonders whether all this was more 
than a white-wash and whether he is right in accepting the acknowledgment of his 
friends as a measuring stick for the progress of his work.
This lack of objective standards of achievement has two severe effects:
	1.	 It deprives the workers in inter-group relations of their legitimate desire for sat-
isfaction on a realistic basis. Under these circumstances, satisfaction or dissatis-
faction with his own achievements becomes mainly a question of temperament.
	2.	 In a field that lacks objective standards of achievement, no learning can take 
place. If we cannot judge whether an action has led forward or backward, if we 
have no criteria for evaluating the relation between effort and achievement, there 
is nothing to prevent us from making the wrong conclusions and to encourage 
26  Kurt Lewin

273
the wrong work habits. Realistic fact-finding and evaluation is a prerequisite for 
any learning. Social research should be one of the top priorities for the practical 
job of improving inter-group relations.
Character and Function of Research for the Practice 
of Inter-­group Relations
The research needed for social practice can best be characterized as research for 
social management or social engineering. It is a type of action-research, a compara-
tive research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action, and 
research leading to social action. Research that produces nothing but books will not 
suffice.
This by no means implies that the research needed is in any respect less scientific 
or ‘lower’ than what would be required for pure science in the field of social events. 
I am inclined to hold the opposite to be true. Institutions interested in engineering, 
such as the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have turned more and more to 
what is called basic research. In regard to social engineering, too, progress will 
depend largely on the rate with which basic research in social sciences can develop 
deeper insight into the laws which govern social life. This ‘basic social research’ 
will have to include mathematical and conceptual problems of theoretical analysis. 
It will have to include the whole range of descriptive fact-finding in regard to small 
and large social bodies. Above all, it will have to include laboratory and field experi-
ments in social change.
Integrating Social Sciences
An attempt to improve inter-group relations has to face a wide variety of tasks. It 
deals with problems of attitude and stereotypes in regard to other groups and to 
one’s own group, with problems of development of attitudes and conduct during 
childhood and adolescence, with problems of housing, and the change of the legal 
structure of the community; it deals with problems of status and caste, with prob-
lems of economic discrimination, with political leadership, and with leadership in 
many aspects of community life. It deals with the small social body of a family, a 
club or a friendship group, with the larger social body of a school or a school sys-
tem, with neighborhoods and with social bodies of the size of a community, of the 
state, a nation and with international problems.
We are beginning to see that it is hopeless to attack any one of these aspects of 
inter-group relations without considering the others. This holds equally for the prac-
tical and the scientific sides of the question. Psychology, sociology, and cultural 
anthropology each have begun to realize that without the help of the other neither 
Reading from Lewin’s work

274
will be able to proceed very far. During the last 5 years first timidly, now very 
clearly, a desire for an integrated approach has become articulated. What this inte-
gration would mean specifically is still open. It may mean an amalgamation of the 
social sciences into one social science. It may mean, on the other hand, merely the 
co-operation of various sciences for the practical objective of improving social 
management. However, the next decade will doubtless witness serious attempts of 
an integrated approach to social research. I am of the opinion that economics will 
have to be included in this symphony if we are to understand and to handle inter-
group relations more effectively.
[…]
The Function and Position of Research Within Social Planning 
and Action
At least of equal importance to the content of the research on inter-group relations 
is its proper placement within social life. When, where, and by whom should social 
research be done?
[…]
Rational social management [proceeds] in a spiral of steps each of which is com-
posed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action.
With this in mind, let us examine for a moment the way inter-group relations are 
handled. I cannot help feeling that the person returning from a successful comple-
tion of a good-will meeting is like the captain of a boat who somehow has felt that 
his ship steers too much to the right and therefore has turned the steering wheel 
sharply to the left. Certain signals assure him that the rudder has followed the move 
of the steering wheel. Happily he goes to dinner. In the meantime, of course, the 
boat moves in circles. In the field of inter-group relations all too frequently action is 
based on observations made ‘within the boat’ and too seldom based on objective 
criteria in regard to the relations of the movement of the boat to the objective to be 
reached.
[…]
The idea of research or fact-finding branches of agencies devoted to improving 
inter-group relations is not new. However, some of them did little more than collect 
newspaper clippings. The last few years have seen a number of very significant 
developments. About 2 years ago the American Jewish Congress established the 
Commission on Community Interrelations. This is an action-research organization 
designed primarily to function as a service organization to Jewish and non-Jewish 
bodies in the field of group interrelations. It is mainly interested in the group 
approach as compared to the individual approach on the one hand and the mass 
approach by way of radio and newspaper on the other. These latter two important 
lines are the focus of attention of the research unit of the American Jewish 
Committee.
26  Kurt Lewin

275
Various programs try to make use of our educational system for betterment of 
inter-group relations. […] I cannot possibly attempt to discuss the many projects 
and findings which are emerging from these research undertakings. They include 
surveys of the methods which have been used until now, such as reported in Watson 
(1946); studies of the development of attitudes in children; studies of the relation 
between inter-group attitudes and such factors as political belief, position in one’s 
own group; experiments about how best to react in case of a verbal attack along 
prejudice lines; change experiments with criminal gangs and with communities; the 
development of many new diagnostic tests; and last but not least, the development 
of more precise theories of social change.

Eric Trist
One of the greatest contributions made to a humanistic approach to work organisa-
tion started with a coal mine. In the late 1940s, Eric Trist, social psychologist and 
deputy chairman of the Tavistock Institute in London was supervising a postgradu-
ate industrial fellow called Ken Bamforth, a former miner. The fellows were encour-
aged to return to their former industries and report on developments. When Bamforth 
did this, Eric Trist later said, “he came back to London very excited and said, ‘You 
must come and see what is happening up there, because I think it has something to 
do with us.’ So I went up with him to Yorkshire, went down the mine, and came up 
a different man” (Fox 1990, p. 260).
The research that Trist carried out in the light of his Yorkshire coal mine experi-
ence was to become known as the sociotechnical systems approach, and it had con-
siderable impact on the way work is organised in a number of countries. It reflected 
Trist’s personality: passionately committed to social justice and to being active in 
the world, but also deeply grounded in academic knowledge and in the detail of the 
situation he was studying. As one former colleague recalled, he displayed “a tre-
mendous sense of fun, a tremendous sense of seeing the enjoyment in life – and 
really engaging with real life in a personal way and not only, as it were, in thinking 
or in conceptual terms” (Bridger et al. 1994, p. 21).
Trist both pioneered and embodied action research – an interplay between his 
deep interaction with real problems in organisations, and the forefront of academic 
thought in social science. In each of his many projects – from jute mills in Dundee 
through coal mines in Yorkshire to an entire manufacturing town in New  York 
State – he was an active contributor to both theory and practice. He said that “I used 
to look with longing at what I called the ‘white-coated peace’, the tranquillity of the 
white-coated scientists working in the lab. But that was not for me. I didn’t have a 
white lab coat. I was in the messy, ambiguous, problematic stuff that you have to 
endure if you are going to be a psychologist” (Fox 1990, p. 263).
Eric Lansdown Trist was born in 1909 in Dover, UK and died in 1993 in Carmel, 
California. He studied English and psychology for 5 years at Cambridge University, 
graduating in 1933 (Trahair 2015). His most significant influences at Cambridge 

278
were the important scholar of literary criticism I.A. Richards (who later attended 
one of the Macy conferences on cybernetics) and the psychologist Frederick Bartlett, 
who developed a highly active theory of memory that continues to be important. He 
was a contemporary and close friend at Cambridge of Grey Walter, who later became 
a prominent brain researcher and cybernetician, and who influenced Trist’s shift 
from literature to science.
Towards the end of his time at Cambridge, Trist became interested in the work of 
the social psychologist Kurt Lewin. One afternoon, he shared his deep excitement 
over an article of Lewin’s on scientific method with his professor, Frederick Bartlett, 
which “went against me – young Trist had shown himself guilty of enthusiasm, of 
being uncritically over-impressed, not detached enough, too involved” (Trist 1993). 
He met Lewin briefly at Cambridge (while Trist was showing him around the city, 
Lewin almost missed his train because he was too excited by the statue of Isaac 
Newton at Newton’s own college, Trinity), and later for a longer period in the United 
States. Trist became deeply influenced by Lewin’s work, and indeed Evered (1994, 
p. 8) argues that “Lewin’s principle that behaviour is a function of both the person 
and the environment is brought to fruition in Trist’s work. Eric Trist is surely the 
true heir of Kurt Lewin’s life work”.
After Cambridge, Trist was awarded a Commonwealth Fellowship and went to 
Yale University. While there, he was particularly inspired by Edward Sapir, the 
great linguistic anthropologist who argued that personality and culture were strongly 
intertwined (a view he shared with fellow-anthropologist Margaret Mead). Sapir’s 
concept of culture as something active, which each person interacts with individu-
ally, was greatly important to Trist’s developing sense of the importance of the envi-
ronment (the context in which they live) on the individual, and he later described 
Sapir as “the biggest influence on my intellectual life, ever” (Trist 1993). His time 
in the US confirmed his identity as a social psychologist.
However, British psychology of the time did not favour the social view, and Trist 
found it hard to obtain a job when he returned to the UK in 1935. Eventually he 
found a research post based at the University of St Andrews, studying the psycho-
logical effects of long-term unemployment in the nearby city of Dundee. This work 
built on and enhanced his growing social consciousness, also gained in the US 
through observing the terrible effects upon people of the Depression. This project 
was one of the very first examples of an action research approach, with Trist living 
in the community he was studying and establishing with them in advance that there 
would be mutual benefit both for the researchers and for the community.
Trist’s career took a new turn with the outbreak of the Second World War, as a 
clinical psychologist at the Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital in London, which gave 
him considerable new experience of clinical psychology and of psychoanalysis. His 
experience at the Maudsley led him, after 2 years, to move into the British army to 
join the work being carried out by a group of psychiatrists from the Tavistock Clinic 
who were working on the effective use of human resources in the army. With Jock 
Sutherland and Wilfred Bion, psychiatrists strongly aligned with psychoanalysis, 
Trist developed the form and methods of the War Office Selection Boards, the direct 
antecedents of the ‘assessment centres’ widely used in recruitment. Trist’s final 
27  Eric Trist

279
main work in the war, again with the Tavistock group, was as chief psychologist to 
the Civil Resettlement Units, therapeutic communities for prisoners of war return-
ing to the UK, which he described as “probably the most exciting single experience 
of my professional life … a tremendous success and broke very new ground” 
(Trist 1993).
The successes of the Tavistock Clinic and its associates in the war led them to an 
awareness that the methods they had developed would have a role in the post-war 
world well beyond that of individual psychiatry. This led to the formation of the 
Tavistock Institute of Human Relations as a distinct entity in 1946, of which Trist 
became the deputy chairman. The Tavistock was strongly influenced by psycho-
analysis, particularly the work of Melanie Klein, and all their staff were required to 
enter training analysis. However, Klein’s interest in the impact of the environment 
on the individual was waning while the Tavistock “paid major attention to the envi-
ronment, and became interested in social applications of psychoanalysis” 
(Trist 1993).
The importance of the environment, and the interdisciplinary nature of the work 
it required, was to become quickly important for the nascent Tavistock Institute: 
while it had initially received project funding from the Medical Research Council, 
and seed funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, both ran out at the end of the 
1940s. The Institute therefore had to fund itself by industrial consultancy, with cli-
ents including Unilever (for whom they applied the work on War Office Selection 
Boards to their management development programme) and Mars (for whom they 
carried out consumer studies). The Tavistock’s industrial and interdisciplinary focus 
made it hard for them to publish in traditional academic journals, so in 1947 they 
established the journal Human Relations along with Kurt Lewin and his colleagues 
(the journal continues to this day and has published many important articles).
It was in this context that Trist had his revelation at the Haighmoor coal mine in 
Yorkshire. What he saw there was that technological developments had enabled 
miners to work in small autonomous groups, with each person responsible for a 
range of tasks, rather than the highly specialised and routinised production-line 
approach then common in industry. Further studies in coal mining and in other 
industries over the next few years revealed similar experiences with autonomous 
work groups enabled by new technologies, although the Tavistock group experi-
enced considerable resistance from industry, due to “resistance on the part of mine 
owners to allowing workers to share in operational control” (Pasmore et  al. 
2019, p.69).
During the early 1950s, Trist began a research collaboration with Fred Emery 
that would last the rest of their lives and shape both of their ideas considerably. 
Emery was an Australian who began as a natural scientist, became a psychologist 
during his doctorate, and made great contributions to organisational development 
and to systems thinking (working later with Russell Ackoff as well as with Trist), 
notably through the ‘Search Conference’ workshop design for looking at desirable 
futures for an organisation (which he developed with Trist). He was attracted to the 
Tavistock because he wanted to “do real science in important practical social mat-
ters” (quoted by Heller 1997, p. 1212), and worked there for a decade.

In due course, Trist and Emery put together a solid theoretical perspective from 
the Haighmoor experiences. They built on Bion’s and Lewin’s different theories of 
group dynamics, which both “emphasised the capacity of the small group for self-­
regulation, an aspect of systems theory which received increasing attention as 
cybernetics developed” (Trist 1981). They also drew extensively on von Bertalanffy’s 
(1950) work on open systems, with its emphasis on the importance of the role of the 
environment in the development of a system. Taken together, this work became the 
sociotechnical systems approach.
The basic goal of sociotechnical systems design is one of “the joint optimization 
of the social and technical systems” (Emery, quoted in Trist 1981). Strongly linked 
with this goal has been the development of a theory of work design that is based on 
the study of the whole work system, organised in terms of self-regulating groups 
and multi-skilled individuals. This approach developed through a large number of 
international projects at the Tavistock, largely led by Trist. Perhaps the most notable 
was the Norwegian Industrial Democracy Project in the early 1960s which ulti-
mately led to legislation in Norway (later emulated throughout Scandinavia) which 
“gave workers the right to demand jobs conforming to sociotechnical principles of 
good work practice – variety, learning opportunity, own decision power, organiza-
tional support, social recognition and a desirable future” (Mumford 2006, p. 325). 
The focus on industrial democracy became increasingly important in sociotechnical 
systems through the 1960s, although discomfort with the particular phrase in some 
large corporations, especially American, led to the rebranding of this approach as 
‘quality of working life’ at a conference in 1972.
Trist carried out many other research projects at the Tavistock, notably on group 
dynamics with Wilfred Bion. He became chairman of the Tavistock in 1956 (when 
the founding chairman, Tommy Wilson, left to join Unilever) and continued in that 
role for 10 years. Under Trist’s leadership, the Tavistock began important work in 
group relations training (the Leicester conferences which were later developed by 
Ken Rice but were initially led by Trist), family therapy (which led to the semi-­
autonomous Institute of Marital Studies) and operational research (which again led 
to a semi-autonomous Institute of Operational Research, with the considerable 
involvement of Russell Ackoff). In each of these pieces of work (and many others), 
Trist was more than a manager – he was deeply involved in their conceptualisation 
and their practical implementation. Building effective institutions, often taking a 
networked form, was something very important to him.
In 1966, Trist left the Tavistock Institute and moved to California, partly due to 
the health of his wife Beulah and partly because of splits and differences within the 
Tavistock (Trahair 2015). He was based in North America for the rest of his life – 
for 3 years at the University of California at Los Angeles, from 1969 until 1978 at 
the University of Pennsylvania (where he worked closely with Russell Ackoff) and 
from 1978 until 1985 at York University in Toronto. Although ill health forced him 
to retire from his active university post (at the age of 76), he carried on working on 
a three-volume anthology of papers from the Tavistock.
Trist’s work in North America continued to be strongly focused on action 
research, “which expresses the social engagement of social science, compels the 
27  Eric Trist

281
research worker to make interdisciplinary combinations in order to understand the 
many-sided real life situations being dealt with” (Trist 1990, p. 539). Notably, he 
carried out a sociotechnical project on a whole town in Jamestown, New York State, 
allowing him to go up a systemic level and look at a much larger work system.
His later work took him to a further systemic level, though building on many of 
the same principles. Working with Fred Emery again, Trist also expanded his work 
to cover what they the termed ‘social ecology’ – the changing nature of the environ-
ment around systems (unrelated to the ecology of the natural world). It arose from a 
set of projects carried out in the early 1960s with very large organisations working 
in rapidly changing situations, such as the National Farmers Union and a manufac-
turer of aircraft engines. Emery and Trist argued in a classic paper that it was neces-
sary to go beyond general systems theory, and consider not just the elements of a 
system’s environment that impact upon the system but the processes of change 
within the environment which will in future come to affect the system. In particular, 
they identified a certain class of environments as ‘turbulent fields’, with rapid 
change and significant interdependencies between elements in the environment: 
“the dynamic properties arise not simply from the interaction of the component 
organizations but also from the field itself – the ‘ground’ is in motion” (Emery and 
Trist 1965, p. 26).
This led Trist and Emery to a series of further studies and publications around the 
ways organisations need to behave in turbulent fields (published as Emery and Trist 
1972). In industrial societies, organisations have succeeded through structuring 
themselves mechanistically, competing with each other, and controlling their envi-
ronments. In a more turbulent post-industrial world, organisations need to learn to 
plan for the long term, work in a co-ordinated and co-operative way, and structure 
themselves organically around networks. This also led Trist into future studies, the 
role of flexibility in organisations and the use of methods such as action learning 
and ‘Search Conference’ workshops. In the 1990s and 2000s, an awareness of tur-
bulence, complexity and the deeply interconnected globalised environment, and the 
consequent use of techniques such as scenario planning and organisational learning 
have become widespread. It shows Trist’s extraordinary farsightedness that he was 
able to see the need for these approaches, from working closely with real organisa-
tions, 30 years before they become common.
Eric Trist made an enormous set of contributions to organisations, systems and 
psychology. He developed many important new ideas and techniques; he founded 
several significant organisations; and he was passionately committed to social 
change. He achieved a great deal with his life, and was never afraid to go beyond 
accepted wisdom. It is not really possible to sum up all of Trist’s contributions, but 
his values were clear, and those stand as his greatest tribute and lasting impact, as 
one colleague recalled (Evered 1994, p. 7):
His life stands as an example of what is possible in working with others. He was a collabo-
rator, someone whose power was working with others as colearners and cocreators. He has 
shown us all how to do social science that has real human consequences, that both makes a 
difference to people’s lives and provides us with the means to more richly understand the 
nature of organisational life.

The sociotechnical concept arose in conjunction with the first of several field 
projects undertaken by the Tavistock Institute in the British coal-mining industry. 
The time (1949) was that of the post-war reconstruction of industry in relation to 
which the Institute had two action research projects. One was concerned with group 
relations in depth at all levels (including the management-labor interface) in a single 
organization, an engineering company in the private sector. The other project 
focused on the diffusion of innovative work practices and organizational arrange-
ments that did not require major capital expenditure but which gave promise of 
raising productivity. The former project represented the first comprehensive appli-
cation in an industrial setting of the socioclinical ideas concerning groups being 
developed at the Tavistock. For this purpose a novel action research methodology 
was introduced. The book describing the project became a classic (Jaques 1951). 
Nevertheless, it approached the organization exclusively as a social system. The 
second project was led, through circumstances described below, to include the tech-
nical as well as the social system in the factors to be considered and to postulate that 
the relations between them should constitute a new field of inquiry.
Coal being then the chief source of power, a plentiful and cheap supply of it was 
important for industrial reconstruction. But the newly nationalized industry was not 
doing well. Productivity failed to increase in step with increases in mechanization. 
Men were leaving the mines in large numbers for better opportunities in the facto-
ries. Among those who remained, absenteeism averaged 20%. Labor disputes were 
frequent despite improved conditions of employment. Some time earlier the 
National Coal Board had asked the Institute to make a comparative study of a high 
producing, high morale mine and a low producing, low morale, but otherwise equiv-
alent mine. Despite nationalization, however, our research team was not welcome at 
the coal face under the auspices of the Board.
There were at the Institute at that time six postgraduate Fellows being trained for 
industrial field work. Among these, three had a trade union background and one, the 
late Ken Bamforth, had been a miner. After a year, the Fellows were encouraged to 
revisit their former industries and report any new perceptions. Bamforth returned 
with news of an innovation in work practice and organization taking place in a new 
seam in the colliery where he used to work in the South Yorkshire coalfield. The 
seam, the Haighmoor, had become possible to mine ‘shortwall’ because of improved 
roof control. I can recall now the excitement with which I listened to him. I lost no 
time in going up to visit this colliery where, since we were introduced by him, the 
local management and union readily agreed to our researching their innovation with 
a view to its diffusion to other mines. The Area General Manager, who managed 
some 20 mines, welcomed the idea. The technical conception of the new scheme 
27  Eric Trist

283
was his, though the men, with union support, had proposed the actual working 
arrangements.
The work organization of the new seam was to us a novel phenomenon consist-
ing of a set of relatively autonomous groups interchanging roles and shifts and regu-
lating their affairs with a minimum of supervision. Cooperation between task groups 
was everywhere in evidence; personal commitment was obvious, absenteeism low, 
accidents infrequent, productivity high. The contrast was large between the atmo-
sphere and arrangements on these faces and those in the conventional areas of the 
pit, where the negative features characteristic of the industry were glaringly appar-
ent. The men told us that in order to adapt with best advantage to the technical 
conditions in the new seam, they had evolved a form of work organization based on 
practices common in unmechanized days when small groups, who took responsibil-
ity for the entire cycle, had worked autonomously. These practices had disappeared 
as the pits became progressively more mechanized when ‘longwall’ working had 
been introduced. This had enlarged the scale of operations and led to aggregates of 
men of considerable size having their jobs broken down into one-man-one-task 
roles, while coordination and control were externalized in supervision, which 
became coercive. Now they had found a way at a higher level of mechanization, of 
recovering the group cohesion and self-regulation they had lost and of advancing 
their power to participate in decisions concerning their work arrangements. For this 
reason, the book which overviewed the Tavistock mining studies was subtitled “The 
Loss, Rediscovery and Transformation of a Work Tradition” (Trist et al. 1963).
The transformation represented a change of direction in organizational design. 
For several decades the prevailing direction had been to increase bureaucratization 
with each increase in scale and level of mechanization. The organizational model 
that fused Weber’s description of bureaucracy with Frederick Taylor’s concept of 
scientific management had become pervasive. The Haighmoor innovation showed 
that there was an alternative.
Those concerned with it had made an organizational choice (Trist et al. 1963). 
They could, with minor modifications, have extended the prevailing mode of work-
ing. They chose instead to elaborate a major design alternative. It was not true that 
the only way of designing work organizations was to conform to Tayloristic and 
bureaucratic principles. There were other ways, which represented a discontinuity 
with the prevailing mode. The technological imperative could be disobeyed with 
positive economic as well as human results. As became clearer later, what happened 
in the Haighmoor seam gave to Bamforth and me a first glimpse of “the emergence 
of a new paradigm of work” (Emery 1978) in which the best match would be sought 
between the requirements of the social and technical systems.
Some of the principles involved were as follows:
	1.	 The work system, which comprised a set of activities that made up a functioning 
whole, now became the basic unit rather than the single jobs into which it was 
decomposable.
	2.	 Correspondingly, the work group became central rather than the individual 
jobholder.
Reading from Trist’s work

284
	3.	 Internal regulation of the system by the group was thus rendered possible rather 
than the external regulation of individuals by supervisors.
	4.	 A design principle based on the redundancy of functions rather than the redun-
dancy of parts (Emery 1967) characterized the underlying organizational phi-
losophy, which tended to develop multiple skills in the individual and immensely 
increase the response repertoire of the group.
	5.	 This principle valued the discretionary rather than the prescribed part of work 
roles (Jaques 1956).
	6.	 It treated the individual as complementary to the machine rather than as an exten-
sion of it (Jordan 1963).
	7.	 It was variety-increasing for both the individual and the organization rather than 
variety-decreasing in the bureaucratic mode.
Conceptually, the new paradigm entailed a shift in the way work organizations 
were envisaged. Under the old paradigm, engineers, following the technological 
imperative, would design whatever organization the technology seemed to require. 
This was a rule accepted by all concerned (Davis et al. 1955). The ‘people cost’ of 
proceeding in this way was not considered. […].
The idea of separate approaches to the social and the technical systems of an 
organization could no longer suffice for one who had experienced, as I had, the 
profound consequences of a change in social-technical relations such as had 
occurred in the Haighmoor development. Work organizations exist to do work – 
which involves people using technological artifacts (whether hard or soft) to carry 
out sets of tasks related to specified overall purposes. Accordingly, a conceptual 
reframing was proposed in which work organizations were envisaged as sociotech-
nical systems rather than simply as social systems (Trist 1950). The social and tech-
nical systems were the substantive factors, that is, the people and the equipment. 
Economic performance and job satisfaction were outcomes, the level of which 
depended on the goodness of fit between the substantive factors.
[…]
From the beginning the sociotechnical concept has developed in terms of sys-
tems, since it is concerned with interdependencies. It has also developed in terms of 
open system theory, since it is concerned with the environment in which an organi-
zation must actively maintain a steady state. von Bertalanffy’s (1950) paper on 
“Open Systems in Physics and Biology” became available at the time that the socio-
technical concept was being formulated. It influenced both theory-building and field 
projects, compelling attention alike to self-regulation and environmental relations.

Chris Argyris
Chris Argyris was a theorist and practitioner of organisational development. For 
more than 50 years, he wrote, taught and acted as a consultant in helping people and 
organisations to learn. He published over thirty books and a large number of arti-
cles, written with a high degree of scientific rigour, but always with a focus on 
research that can be applied within organisations – a strong “commitment to the 
development of actionable knowledge” (Argyris 2003, p. 1190). He described the 
starting point of his work as follows:
I began my career with a dedication to reducing injustices. The injustices that intrigued me 
were those that inhibited the expansion of liberating alternatives. Soon I narrowed my focus 
even further to those injustices created by human beings when they were acting to reduce 
the injustices. The more that I studied these phenomena, the more I found myself studying 
processes that were self-sealing, compulsively repetitive, and non-interruptible and change-
able by the very people who created them. (Argyris 2003, p. 1178).
Argyris was born in 1923 in New Jersey, USA, of Greek-American origin. He 
took his B.A. degree (1947) in Psychology at Clark University, where he met Kurt 
Lewin, the founder of group dynamics and action research (two of Argyris’ greatest 
interests), who had a huge influence on his work (Woodell 2003, p.  67). His 
Ph.D. (1951) was from Cornell University in Organizational Behaviour, where his 
supervisor was William Foote Whyte, author of the classic ethnography of urban 
life, Street Corner Society (Whyte 1943). He largely worked at two universities – 
Yale, from 1951 to 1971 as a professor of Administrative Science; and Harvard from 
1971, as a professor of Education and Organizational Behaviour. For a number of 
years, he was a fellow of the National Training Laboratories (NTL), which carried 
on the work of Lewin after his early death and founded the field of organisational 
development through its T-group method. He died in 2013, active until just before 
the end of his life – he published his last book in 2010, took long walks daily until 
he was 89, and was married to his wife Renee for 63 years.
Early in his academic career, Argyris shifted his concern from studying individu-
als to studying organisations. His first widely-read work (Argyris 1957) discussed 
the impact of hierarchical organisations with their classic pyramid structures upon 

288
the people who worked in them. He concluded that “if hierarchies had their way, 
they would create work worlds for human beings that were consistent with the fea-
tures of infancy … those workers who valued adult-like work settings would likely 
experience a conflict and would likely be frustrated” (Argyris 2003, p. 1182).
This led him to look for ways to change this situation but he “could find no 
approach, at that time, which was both powerful and efficient enough to do the job – 
after all, you can’t put thousands of employees through therapy” (Woodell 2003, 
p. 68). It was only through working as a trainer with NTL that he “felt that I had 
finally found a way to integrate the individual and the organisation” (Woodell 2003, 
p. 68). Argyris was particularly effective in working with T-groups, the intensive 
training groups developed at NTL based on Kurt Lewin’s work on feedback and 
participant observation. Kleiner (1996, p. 230) describes Argyris’ work with NTL:
The [T-]group confronted people with the direct record – Argyris called this the ‘data’ – of 
their own conversations, so that they could see how they had been locked into destructive 
ways of thinking and relating. Nobody could confront a group with its ‘data’ the way 
Argyris could. He was fearless in the facilitator’s role; he seemed oblivious to whether 
people might be offended or have their feelings hurt, as long as they were learning. Listening 
to the conversation, his eyes would brighten and intensify until he was like a bird of prey, 
perching at the edge of the table, alert to the nuance in every phrase. Then, suddenly, he 
would pounce.
In 1971, Argyris moved from Yale to Harvard and stopped working with 
NTL. Although Argyris was based jointly in the graduate schools of education and 
business, and initially preferred to work on effective learning within schools, he 
found that schoolteachers were not receptive to his ideas, and thus moved to work 
with business executives (Crossan 2003). He was never afraid to challenge those 
executives: in his first published book at Harvard, he wrote of ethnographic research 
he conducted at the New York Times (whose identity he disguised although it was 
later named by other authors), where he “discovered a sclerotic, toxic management 
culture, based on tradition and the management’s beliefs that what they were doing 
must be working” (Lerner 2018, p.278).
It was also at Harvard that his long collaboration began with Donald Schön, of 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), with whom several of his major 
academic contributions developed. For 15 years, they worked closely together in 
teaching, researching and consultancy about the nature of effective organisational 
learning. Their collaboration led to two major joint books, Theory in Practice 
(Argyris and Schön 1974) and Organizational Learning (Argyris and Schön 1978, 
1996). The latter was the first published use of the term organisational learning 
(Fulmer and Keys 1998), at a time when it was not of obvious interest to academics 
or managers, despite its later importance through the works of Peter Senge and oth-
ers on the learning organisation. Argyris and Schön each brought important contri-
butions to this joint work, as discussed in the chapter on Schön, and they later took 
their joint ideas forward in different ways.
28  Chris Argyris

289
Argyris and Schön’s first piece of joint research was a study of educational 
administrators. Their starting point was around theories of action: “a set of rules that 
individuals use to design and implement their own behaviour as well as to ­understand 
the behaviour of others” (Argyris 1991, p. 103). They distinguished between two 
forms of theories of action: espoused theories, which people believe in, advocate, 
and claim to be those which govern their actions; and theories-in-use, which in real 
situations actually govern a particular individual’s actions. The former are explicit 
and articulated, the latter are implicit and can only be inferred from an individual’s 
behaviour. There is frequently a discrepancy between the two forms of theory – that 
is, we frequently behave in ways other than our self-image or the image we project 
to others. This discrepancy is not a matter of hypocrisy, but it is important for an 
individual to understand that the two theories of action may be different, and to be 
able to make sense of their own theory-in-use.
Argyris and Schön (1974) defined theories-in-use according to three linked ele-
ments: governing variables (the assumptions we make in our theories and the things 
we seek to keep at acceptable levels), action strategies (the ways we act in order to 
keep our governing variables within our appropriate levels), and consequences (the 
results of actions, both intended and unintended). It is the relation between these 
three elements that leads to their distinction between single-loop and double-loop 
learning (see Fig. 28.1 below). This concept derives from a long antecedence in 
cybernetics. Argyris and Schön explicitly credit Ross Ashby (1960) for this distinc-
tion – as discussed in the chapter on Ashby, he referred to the process of ‘double 
feedback’ – as well as drawing on Gregory Bateson’s work on levels of learning.
The distinction between single-loop and double-loop learning is thus concerned 
with what changes as a result of a mismatch between the expected and actual con-
sequences of one’s actions. If observing those consequences just results in changes 
in future actions (better to meet the sought-for values of the governing variables), 
that is single-loop learning; if observing the consequences of actions results in 
changes in assumptions about what outcomes are desirable, that would be double-­
loop learning.
It is not the case that single-loop learning is necessarily inferior to double-loop 
learning. Argyris and Schön (1996, p. 22) observe that single-loop learning is “con-
cerned primarily with effectiveness: how best to achieve existing goals and objec-
tives, keeping organisational performance within the range specified by existing 
Fig. 28.1  Single- and double-loop learning. (From Argyris (1992) with permission

values and norms”, and this is frequently both appropriate and necessary. However, 
it is clear that double-loop learning brings about results which are not possible with 
single-loop learning, and that any sort of significant transformation within organisa-
tions requires this deeper form of learning.
Double-loop learning is hard for both individuals and organisations – and espe-
cially for successful ones – in that it appears to challenge the very factors that led to 
their success. This creates a form of defensive behaviour which has been the subject 
of much of Argyris’ work. He has observed it operating within organisations 
(Argyris 1990), among highly-skilled professionals (Argyris 1991) and even among 
researchers studying the nature of defensive behaviour (Argyris 2003).
The source of this defensive behaviour is found in Argyris and Schön’s (1974) 
work on theories-in-use. They distinguish between two typical patterns of theories-­
in-­use. The first of these, Model I, is closely linked to single-loop learning: its val-
ues include being in unilateral control of situations, striving to win rather than 
losing, suppressing negative feelings in oneself and others, and acting rationally. By 
contrast, Model II behaviour is linked to double-loop learning: its values include 
utilizing valid information, promoting free and informed choice, and assuming per-
sonal responsibility to monitor effectiveness (Fulmer and Keys 1998, p. 25).
Argyris observed through a number of studies that “the use of Model I is consis-
tent, regardless of gender, race, culture, education, wealth, and type of organization” 
(Argyris 2002, p. 212). He acknowledges that both espoused theories and the way 
that theories-in-use are actually implemented vary widely, but that when theories-­
in-­use are examined, Model I behaviour is extremely prevalent. Recent work has 
questioned the universality of Model I (Raaijmakers et  al., 2018), arguing that 
Model I is more prevalent among male white-collar workers and that while they 
championed the more ‘feminine’ Model II, the bulk of Argyris & Schön’s data came 
from male workers which gave a skewed view of the prevalence of different mod-
els in use.
Model I behaviour creates the phenomenon of defensive reasoning: “individuals 
keep their premises and inferences tacit, lest they lose control; they create tests of 
their claims that are self-serving and self-sealing” (Argyris 2002, p. 212). In turn 
this defensive reasoning creates a set of additional negative phenomena – skilled 
incompetence, where skilful people act below their capabilities in order to maintain 
patterns of comfortable behaviour; and organisational defensive routines, which act 
in the same manner at an organisational level: “any action, policy, or practice that 
prevents organizational participants from experiencing embarrassment or threat 
and, at the same time, prevents them from discovering the causes of the embarrass-
ment or threat” (Argyris 2002, p. 213). The use of Model I behaviour inhibits the 
capacity of organisations and individuals towards double-loop learning.
It is important to realise that Argyris did not blame those who exhibit defensive 
routines for their behaviour, although he was highly critical of those defensive rou-
tines and their effects. Rather, he sought to help individuals and organisations shift 
towards Model II theories-in-use, those he refers to as “productive routines” (Argyris 
28  Chris Argyris

291
2002, p.214). How to enable this shift to Model II has been the subject of much of 
Argyris’ work – he has worked on the question theoretically but also worked with 
many people through his teaching and consultancy to enable them to achieve this 
shift themselves. One of his former graduate students wrote that:
Prior to the first class, each student completed an exercise, the famous X–Y case, that pro-
vided ‘directly observable data’ about our reasoning and action in giving advice to someone 
else. During the first class, Chris illustrated to us—through analysis, role playing, and 
reflection—that not a single one of us was capable of actually putting our own advice into 
practice. He also pointed out that we were violating our own values. We were shocked and 
defensive, but he was right. Chris skilfully brought us face to face with our limits and he 
also showed us exactly how we could move beyond them. (Friedman et  al., 2014, 
pp. 110-111).
Chris Argyris made many contributions to theories about the effective working 
of organisations. He wrote that his goal was “to emphasize the importance of theory 
and to connect the theory with my deepest feelings” (Argyris 2003, p. 1190). His 
work focused on the relationship between the individual and organisations, the 
importance and difficulty of real learning, and the ways in which research must be 
applicable to be considered valid. He exhibited a deep congruence between the way 
he thought and the way he acted, and demanded that congruence of others. Tsoukas 
(2002) summarised these strands and related them to other systems work:
Argyris invites knowledge workers to undertake a primarily moral, not just technical, task: 
to be open to criticism, to be willing to test their claims publicly against evidence, to accept 
that they too are partly responsible for the problems they are confronted with. … In that 
sense, as well as being an influential organisational psychologist and an implicit moral 
philosopher, Argyris is a systemic theorist, not too different from his own hero Gregory 
Bateson: we partly create the problems we face, he says, and we have a responsibility for 
this.

How professionals avoid learning
For 15 years, I have been conducting in-depth studies of management consultants. I 
decided to study consultants for a few simple reasons. First, they are the epitome of 
the highly educated professionals who play an increasingly central role in all orga-
nizations. Almost all of the consultants I’ve studied have MBAs from the top three 
or four U.S. business schools. They are also highly committed to their work. For 
Reading from Argyris’ work

292
instance, at one company, more than 90% of the consultants responded in a survey 
that they were “highly satisfied” with their jobs and with the company.
I also assumed that such professional consultants would be good at learning. 
After all, the essence of their job is to teach others how to do things differently. I 
found, however, that these consultants embodied the learning dilemma. The most 
enthusiastic about continuous improvement in their own organizations, they were 
also often the biggest obstacle to its complete success.
As long as efforts at learning and change focused on external organizational fac-
tors – job redesign, compensation programs, performance reviews, and leadership 
training – the professionals were enthusiastic participants. Indeed, creating new sys-
tems and structures was precisely the kind of challenge that well-educated, highly 
motivated professionals thrived on.
And yet the moment the quest for continuous improvement turned to the profes-
sionals’ own performance, something went wrong. It wasn’t a matter of bad atti-
tude. The professionals’ commitment to excellence was genuine, and the vision of 
the company was clear. Nevertheless, continuous improvement did not persist. And 
the longer the continuous improvement efforts continued, the greater the likelihood 
that they would produce ever-diminishing returns.
What happened? The professionals began to feel embarrassed. They were threat-
ened by the prospect of critically examining their own role in the organization. 
Indeed, because they were so well paid (and generally believed that their employers 
were supportive and fair), the idea that their performance might not be at its best 
made them feel guilty.
Far from being a catalyst for real change, such feelings caused most to react 
defensively. They projected the blame for any problems away from themselves and 
onto what they said were unclear goals, insensitive and unfair leaders, and stupid 
clients.
[…]
Defensive reasoning and the doom loop
What explains the professionals’ defensiveness? Not their attitudes about change or 
commitment to continuous improvement; they really wanted to work more effec-
tively. Rather, the key factor is the way they reasoned about their behavior and that 
of others.
It is impossible to reason anew in every situation. If we had to think through all 
the possible responses every time someone asked, “How are you?” the world would 
pass us by. Therefore, everyone develops a theory of action – a set of rules that indi-
viduals use to design and implement their own behavior as well as to understand the 
behavior of others. Usually, these theories of actions become so taken for granted 
that people don’t even realize they are using them.
28  Chris Argyris

293
One of the paradoxes of human behavior, however, is that the master program 
people actually use is rarely the one they think they use. Ask people in an interview 
or questionnaire to articulate the rules they use to govern their actions, and they will 
give you what I call their ‘espoused’ theory of action. But observe these same peo-
ple’s behavior, and you will quickly see that this espoused theory has very little to 
do with how they actually behave. For example, the professionals on the case team 
said they believed in continuous improvement, and yet they consistently acted in 
ways that made improvement impossible.
When you observe people’s behavior and try to come up with rules that would 
make sense of it, you discover a very different theory of action – what I call the 
individual’s ‘theory-in-use’. Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, 
unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, 
between the way they think they are acting and the way they really act.
What’s more, most theories-in-use rest on the same set of governing values. 
There seems to be a universal human tendency to design one’s actions consistently 
according to four basic values:
	1.	 To remain in unilateral control
	2.	 To maximize ‘winning’ and minimize ‘losing’
	3.	 To suppress negative feelings
	4.	 To be as ‘rational’ as possible – by which people mean defining clear objectives 
and evaluating their behavior in terms of whether or not they have achieved them
The purpose of all these values is to avoid embarrassment or threat, feeling vul-
nerable or incompetent. In this respect, the master program that most people use is 
profoundly defensive. Defensive reasoning encourages individuals to keep private 
the premises, inferences, and conclusions that shape their behavior and to avoid 
testing them in a truly independent, objective fashion.
Because the attributions that go into defensive reasoning are never really tested, 
it is a closed loop, remarkably impervious to conflicting points of view. The inevi-
table response to the observation that somebody is reasoning defensively is yet more 
defensive reasoning. [In one case study], for example, whenever anyone pointed out 
the professionals’ defensive behavior to them, their initial reaction was to look for 
the cause in somebody else – clients who were so sensitive that they would have 
been alienated if the consultants had criticized them or a manager so weak that he 
couldn’t have taken it had the consultants raised their concerns with him. In other 
words, the case team members once again denied their own responsibility by exter-
nalizing the problem and putting it on someone else.
In such situations, the simple act of encouraging more open inquiry is often 
attacked by others as ‘intimidating’. Those who do the attacking deal with their feel-
ings about possibly being wrong by blaming the more open individual for arousing 
these feelings and upsetting them.
[…]

Learning how to reason productively
If defensive reasoning is as widespread as I believe, then focusing on an individual’s 
attitudes or commitment is never enough to produce real change. And [neither] is 
creating new organizational structures or systems. The problem is that even when 
people are genuinely committed to improving their performance and management 
has changed its structures in order to encourage the ‘right’ kind of behavior, people 
still remain locked in defensive reasoning. Either they remain unaware of this fact, 
or if they do become aware of it, they blame others.
There is, however, reason to believe that organizations can break out of this 
vicious circle. Despite the strength of defensive reasoning, people genuinely strive 
to produce what they intend. They value acting competently. Their self-esteem is 
intimately tied up with behaving consistently and performing effectively. Companies 
can use these universal human tendencies to teach people how to reason in a new 
way – in effect, to change the master programs in their heads and thus reshape their 
behavior.
People can be taught how to recognize the reasoning they use when they design 
and implement their actions. They can begin to identify the inconsistencies between 
their espoused and actual theories of action. They can face up to the fact that they 
unconsciously design and implement actions that they do not intend. Finally, people 
can learn how to identify what individuals and groups do to create organizational 
defenses and how these defenses contribute to an organization’s problems.
Once companies embark on this learning process, they will discover that the kind 
of reasoning necessary to reduce and overcome organizational defenses is the same 
kind of ‘tough reasoning’ that underlies the effective use of ideas in strategy, finance, 
marketing, manufacturing, and other management disciplines. Any sophisticated 
strategic analysis, for example, depends on collecting valid data, analysing it care-
fully, and constantly testing the inferences drawn from the data. The toughest tests 
are reserved for the conclusions. Good strategists make sure that their conclusions 
can withstand all kinds of critical questioning.
So too with productive reasoning about human behavior. The standard of analy-
sis is just as high. Human resource programs no longer need to be based on ‘soft’ 
reasoning but should be as analytical and as data-driven as any other management 
discipline.
Of course, that is not the kind of reasoning the consultants used when they 
encountered problems that were embarrassing or threatening. The data they col-
lected was hardly objective. The inferences they made rarely became explicit. The 
conclusions they reached were largely self-serving, impossible for others to test, 
and as a result, ‘self-sealing’, impervious to change.
How can an organization begin to turn this situation around, to teach its members 
how to reason productively? The first step is for managers at the top to examine 
critically and change their own theories-in-use. Until senior managers become 
28  Chris Argyris

295
aware of how they reason defensively and the counterproductive consequences that 
result, there will be little real progress. Any change activity is likely to be just a fad.
Change has to start at the top because otherwise defensive senior managers are 
likely to disown any transformation in reasoning patterns coming from below. If 
professionals or middle managers begin to change the way they reason and act, such 
changes are likely to appear strange – if not actually dangerous – to those at the top. 
The result is an unstable situation where senior managers still believe that it is a sign 
of caring and sensitivity to bypass and cover up difficult issues, while their subordi-
nates see the very same actions as defensive.
The key to any educational experience designed to teach senior managers how to 
reason productively is to connect the program to real business problems. The best 
demonstration of the usefulness of productive reasoning is for busy managers to see 
how it can make a direct difference in their own performance and in that of the 
organization. This will not happen overnight. Managers need plenty of opportunity 
to practice the new skills. But once they grasp the powerful impact that productive 
reasoning can have on actual performance, they will have a strong incentive to rea-
son productively not just in a training session but in all their work relationships.

Donald Schön
Donald Alan Schön was a pre-eminent scholar of professional practice and learning. 
He is most celebrated for his work on the reflective practitioner and on organisa-
tional learning. He made significant contributions to the fields of education, man-
agement, urban planning, and design. His original intellectual home, however, was 
philosophy and throughout his career he regarded himself as a “displaced philoso-
pher” (Waks 2001, p.  37). He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the philosopher John 
Dewey’s theory of inquiry, and as Sanyal (1998, p. 6) notes, “the Deweyian notion 
that all knowledge derives from practice remained at the heart of Don’s formulation 
of the epistemological foundation of effective practice”.
Schön was born in Boston in 1930 and lived in the city most of his life. Schön 
was educated in philosophy at Yale University (undergraduate) and Harvard 
University (Ph.D.), and in the clarinet at the Paris Conservatoire. After his Ph.D. and 
a short spell in the army, he worked for 15 years as a practitioner: in new product 
development at the consultancy Arthur D. Little, in government at National Bureau 
of Standards, and in a small enterprise as the co-founder and director of the 
Organization for Social & Technical Innovation (OSTI). In 1972, Schön became 
professor of Urban Studies and Education at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT), where he remained until his death in 1997.
Schön blended practice and theory throughout his life, as an academic, consul-
tant and practitioner. While working as a practitioner, he made significant contribu-
tions to theory: three of his eight major books were written outside academia, and 
his invitation to give the BBC Reith Lectures in 1970 (the prestigious annual lecture 
series of ideas at the forefront of current thought) came when he was working at 
OSTI. When he became an academic, he remained involved as a consultant (as well 
as a researcher into professionals of many kinds).
Three facets of Schön’s character stand out. First, he felt a close affinity with a 
giraffe: “long-necked, graceful, curious, aloof” (Warsh 1997, p. F1). Waks (2001, 
p. 37) describes the comparison as insightful, observing that “he also looked down 
upon the world of practice – learning its ways and assisting its denizens to make life 
a little better – from the inquisitive but distanced perspective of the philosopher”. 

298
After his death his wife Nancy created a set of sculptures called “The Reflective 
Giraffe” in his honour (pictures of which can be seen on her website, N. Schön n.d.).
Second, he was a highly accomplished musician. Trained in the clarinet, he 
played daily, both chamber music and jazz. Both these forms had a profound influ-
ence on his thinking. As Smith (2001) remarks, “this interest in improvisation and 
structure was mirrored in his academic writing, most notably in his exploration of 
professionals’ ability to ‘think on their feet’”. Music was crucial throughout Schön’s 
life, right up to the moment of his death. Sanyal (1998, p. 7), drawing on accounts 
by Don’s son Andrew, writes that “it was a fitting farewell for his family to stand 
surrounding his bed holding hands and singing rounds of songs … as Don’s eyes 
closed for the last time, the family members lowered their voices in sorrow only to 
be urged by Don who raised his right palm to request them to continue singing so he 
could listen to his favourite Brahms as he gently embraced death”.
Third, he was devoted to his family. He was married to sculptor Nancy Schön, 
and they had four children and many grandchildren. At the time of his death, he was 
preparing one grandson for his bar mitzvah (Schön was Jewish) and building a pup-
pet theatre for his grandchildren, “who he taught the essence of reflection by having 
them critically conceive a theory of how a puppet theatre ought to work” (Richmond 
1998, p. 3).
Schön’s many contributions can be viewed in three interconnected major areas.
The first of these areas was his work on change. Schön’s second book, Technology 
and change (1967), was subtitled The New Heraclitus. Schön took inspiration from 
Heraclitus, the Greek philosopher of change from the sixth century BC, who dis-
cussed the constancy of change and argued that stability is a temporary phenome-
non. The phrase “one can never step in the same river twice” is often attributed to 
Heraclitus (in fact it is a later paraphrase of his words) to indicate his view that 
stability in one area of the world – the river – only occurs through rapid change in 
another area – the water that flows in it. In the same way, Schön argued from early 
in his career that change, partly delivered through technology and partly through 
society, is an ever-present feature in today’s world.
Schön’s clearest expression of his understanding of change came when he was 
invited to give the BBC Reith Lectures in 1970, at the time the youngest-ever person 
to have done so. The lectures were the basis of his book Beyond the stable state 
(Schön 1971), which was highly innovative when written but remains very relevant 
to the turmoil in today’s society. Starting from the widespread belief in a ‘stable 
state’, of unchangeability and constancy in key areas of life, he argued that this was 
insufficient and unrealistic, and that “the loss of the stable state means that our soci-
ety and all of its institutions are in continuing processes of transformation” (Schön 
1971, p. 30). This requires us to understand and guide the transformations in our 
society and institutions, but also to transform them in a different way: “we must 
invent and develop institutions which are ‘learning systems’, that is to say systems 
capable of bringing about their own continuing transformation” (Schön 1971, p. 30).
Schön applied his concept of a learning system both to business organisations 
and to society and governments – the basis both for his later work on organisational 
learning but also for the concept of a ‘learning society’. However, as he discussed, 
29  Donald Schön

organisations have a significant tendency to fight to preserve their structures and 
identity  – that is, they exhibit ‘dynamic conservatism’, in Schön’s term. As he 
observed, “social systems resist change with an energy roughly proportional to the 
radicalness of the change that is being threatened” (Schön 1971, p. 38). Dynamic 
conservatism is not entirely negative – it is the process “through which social sys-
tems keep from flying apart at the seams … our systems need to maintain their 
identity, and their ability to support the self-identity of those who belong to them, 
but they must at the same time be capable of transforming themselves” (Schön 
1971, p. 60).
This work on change led to Schön’s second major contribution, on learning. 
Much of this research was conducted with Chris Argyris, and is discussed in more 
detail in the chapter on Argyris. In their two major books, Theory in Practice 
(Argyris and Schön 1974) and Organisational Learning (Argyris and Schön 1978), 
they introduce a number of major concepts as well as that of organisational learning, 
notably the idea of a theory of action, the distinction between espoused theory and 
theory-in-use, and the concepts of single and double loop learning.
Much of the concept of organisational learning was present in Schön’s work 
predating his collaboration with Argyris, although the idea in its mature form arose 
from the combinations of the ideas of both – Schön’s philosophical and industrial 
experience, and Argyris’ work in social psychology and group dynamics. As a for-
mer student of the two described his contributions to organisational learning, 
Schön’s “big picture orientation … helped keep the fledgling field from becoming 
mired in micro-issues (analysis of linguistics and conversational patterns)” 
(Tomasko 1997). The same author comments on the differences in styles of interac-
tion between Schön and Argyris, from a time when they were jointly teaching: “his 
warm and nurturing nature served as a great foil to Chris’ sometime prickliness 
[although] … Chris could certainly be extremely warm and generous, and Don rig-
orous and judgmental when the situation called for it” (Tomasko 1997).
Schön’s third major contribution, arguably the most influential, was the concept 
of reflective practice (and its parallel concept of the reflective practitioner). The 
starting point for this work was a study of professionals and their learning, and the 
observation of a “crisis of confidence in professional knowledge” (Schön 1984, 
p. 3). This crisis arises from a mismatch between the needs of professionals working 
in real situations, and the skills they learn through traditional education processes. 
In a vivid image (Schön 1984, p. 42), drawing on Russell Ackoff’s use of the term 
‘mess’, he wrote that:
In the varied topography of professional practice, there is a high, hard ground where prac-
titioners can make effective use of research-based theory and technique, and there is a 
swampy lowland where situations are confusing ‘messes’ incapable of technical solution. 
The difficulty is that the problems of the high ground, however great their technical interest, 
are often relatively unimportant to clients or to the larger society, while in the swamp are 
the problems of greatest human concern.
However, Schön argues, professional education is ill-suited for the problems of 
the ‘swamp’ – it is dominated by a model of “technical rationality”, which stresses 
“instrumental problem solving made rigorous by the application of scientific theory 
29  Donald Schön

and technique” (Schön 1984, p. 21). The importance of this approach to profes-
sional education arises from a lack of self-confidence in university departments 
educating professionals – especially applied professions such as social work, educa-
tion, architecture and town planning. Comparing themselves with the certainties 
and academic groundedness of traditional university disciplines and long-­established 
professional schools in medicine and law, these professions seemed at their found-
ing less rigorous and well-founded. The Faustian bargain that resulted was that the 
education of these professionals would stress first the scientific foundations of the 
field, then a set of rigorous and instrumental techniques derived directly from those 
foundations, and only finally issues of the practice of these techniques and their 
relation to real-world situations. Thus in the process of trying to become more aca-
demically acceptable, these professional educators have removed themselves a long 
way from the skills which will be valuable to professionals following their education.
The solution which Schön put forward followed on from his earlier work with 
Argyris on theories of action, as well as a number of other bodies of ideas, including 
his earlier interest in Dewey’s understanding of knowledge, Vickers’ appreciative 
systems (described in the chapter on that author), among others. He observed that 
much of what we know is only exhibited when it is enacted, which he referred to as 
knowing-in-action – a form of knowledge that is distinct from that which is learnt in 
the classroom and later applied. This knowledge leads to the process that Schön 
described as reflection-in-action: that when professionals act, and are faced with an 
unfamiliar situation, they improvise on the basis of past experience and their 
knowing-­in-action. Someone who reflects-in-action “is not dependent on the cate-
gories of established theory and technique, but constructs a new theory of the unique 
case” (Schön 1984, p. 68).
A reflective practitioner, therefore, is one who habitually reflects-in-action, and 
who cultivates their ability to do so. This latter process may well involve reflection-­
on-­action, that is reflection on the action taken, after the event (post-hoc). However, 
these two processes are quite distinct. This is important to stress because it is post-­
hoc reflection which is the more familiar form – the quiet minutes at the end of the 
day, or the use of a journal. Some of those who have taken up Schön’s call for reflec-
tive practice have stressed post-hoc reflection as the key activity for the reflective 
practitioner, and it clearly has a role, but it is not the heart of the concept as expressed 
by Schön, who stresses reflection in the midst of action. Schön frequently used jazz 
as an image of reflection-in-action: the process of improvisation in the moment 
based on a response to the situation (what other musicians are playing, the audi-
ence’s response etc.), to the established rhythm and melody of the piece, and also on 
one’s own abilities and enthusiasms.
Schön’s work has been criticised by a number of authors for being too individu-
alistic, having a weak focus on power and politics. As Kotzee (2012) argues, this 
applies both to Schön’s concept of reflection and that of practice. Although it is true 
that Schön did not have an explicit model of power in many of his writings, he none-
theless had a deep concern for social and political issues: “Don was deeply inter-
ested in issues of power – not the power of holding a gun over someone, but a subtle 
form of intellectual power that grips us and forces us to act in particular ways … in 
29  Donald Schön

301
its consequences it is as dangerous as more conventional forms of power. It can 
marginalise, dominate, and force particular outcomes.” (Verma 1998, p. 9).
Later in his life, Schön did apply concepts of reflection to questions of public 
policy – in one of his last major books he discussed the concept of frames (“underly-
ing structures of belief, perception and appreciation” – Schön and Rein 1994, p. 23) 
created within an institutional context. They ask the question to what extent is it 
possible to change frames in a manner akin to reflection-in-action, observing that 
“policies are sometimes reframed in action, and their reframing sometimes results 
from the actors’ reflection on frame conflicts that arise in the evolving, politically 
coloured process of policy design” (Schön and Rein 1994, p. viii).
Although Schön is very widely read and cited, in a range of fields including plan-
ning, design and education among many others, this is sometimes at quite a super-
ficial level. Fischler (2012, p. 322) writes of “the widespread diffusion but limited 
impact of Schön’s ideas” in planning theory; and in design science, Schön’s work is 
used by authors as backup for their ideas but there is seldom “critical engagement 
with (or building on) Schön’s ideas” (Beck and Chiapello 2018, p. 206). Many of 
his original works are still deeply relevant and accessible, and deserve to be read in 
greater depth.
Schön’s major focus was on change in many forms and settings. As his colleague 
Jeanne Bamberger (2000, p. 10) summed up his concerns: “Don’s persistent and 
abiding belief in the permanence of change, of evanescence, and transience was, I 
think, an underlying, moving force – it was the foundation upon which the multi-­
faceted puzzle of his several lives-in-one was built, and in its paradox, also knit 
together a life that worked as one vibrant whole.”

When we have learned how to do something, we can execute smooth sequences 
of activity, recognition, decision, and adjustment without having, as we say, to 
‘think about it’. Our spontaneous knowing-in-action usually gets us through the day. 
On occasion, however, it doesn’t. A familiar routine produces an unexpected result; 
an error stubbornly resists correction; or, although the usual actions produce the 
usual outcomes, we find something odd about them because, for some reason, we 
have begun to look at them in a new way. All such experiences, pleasant and unpleas-
ant, contain an element of surprise. Something fails to meet our expectations. In an 
attempt to preserve the constancy of our usual patterns of knowing-in-action, we 
may respond to surprise by brushing it aside, selectively inattending to the signals 
that produce it. Or we may respond to it by reflection, and we may do so in one of 
two ways.
Reading from Schön’s work

302
We may reflect on action, thinking back on what we have done in order to dis-
cover how our knowing-in-action may have contributed to an unexpected outcome. 
We may do so after the fact, in tranquility, or we may pause in the midst of action to 
make what Hannah Arendt (1978) calls a ‘stop-and-think’. In either case, our reflec-
tion has no direct connection to present action. Alternatively, we may reflect in the 
midst of action without interrupting it. In an action-present – a period of time, vari-
able with the context, during which we can still make a difference to the situation at 
hand – our thinking serves to reshape what we are doing while we are doing it. I 
shall say, in cases like this, that we reflect-in-action.
Recently, for example, I built a gate out of wooden pickets and strapping. I had 
made a drawing and figured out the dimensions I wanted, but I had not reckoned 
with the problem of keeping the structure square. As I began to nail the strapping to 
the pickets, I noticed a wobble. I knew the structure would become rigid when I 
nailed in a diagonal piece, but how could I be sure it would be square? There came 
to mind a vague memory about diagonals: in a rectangle diagonals are equal. I took 
a yardstick, intending to measure the diagonals, but I found I could not use it with-
out disturbing the structure. It occurred to me to use a piece of string. Then it became 
apparent that, in order to measure the diagonals, I needed a precise location at each 
corner. After several trials, I found I could locate the centre point at each corner by 
constructing diagonals there […] I hammered in a nail at each of the four centre 
points and used the nails as anchors for the measurement string. It took several min-
utes to figure out how to adjust the structure so as to correct the errors I found by 
measuring. And then, when I had the diagonals equal, I nailed in a piece of strapping 
to freeze the structure.
Here, in an example that must have its analogues in the experiences of amateur 
carpenters the world over, my intuitive way of going about the task led me to a sur-
prise (the discovery of the wobble), which I interpreted as a problem. In the midst 
of action, I invented procedures to solve the problem, discovered further unpleasant 
surprises, and made further corrective inventions, including the several minor ones 
necessary to carry out the idea of using string to measure the diagonals. We might 
call such a process ‘trial and error’. But the trials are not randomly related to one 
another; reflection on each trial and its results sets the stage for the next trial. Such 
a pattern of inquiry is better described as a sequence of ‘moments’ in a process of 
reflection-in-action:
•	 There is, to begin with, a situation of action to which we bring spontaneous, 
routinized responses. These reveal knowing-in-action that may be described in 
terms of strategies, understandings of phenomena, and ways of framing a task or 
problem appropriate to the situation. The knowing-in-action is tacit, spontane-
ously delivered without conscious deliberation; and it works, yielding intended 
outcomes so long as the situation falls within the boundaries of what we have 
learned to treat as normal.
•	 Routine responses produce a surprise  – an unexpected outcome, pleasant or 
unpleasant, that does not fit the categories of our knowing-in-action. Inherent in 
a surprise is the fact that it gets our attention. For example, I might not have been 
29  Donald Schön

303
surprised by the wobble in my gate because I might not have attended to it; the 
structure might not have ended up square, and I might not have noticed.
•	 Surprise leads to reflection within an action-present. Reflection is at least in 
some measure conscious, although it need not occur in the medium of words. We 
consider both the unexpected event and the knowing-in-action that led up to it, 
asking ourselves, as it were, “What is this?” and, at the same time, “How have I 
been thinking about it?” Our thought turns back on the surprising phenomenon 
and, at the same time, back on itself.
•	 Reflection-in-action has a critical function, questioning the assumptional struc-
ture of knowing-in-action. We think critically about the thinking that got us into 
this fix or this opportunity; and we may, in the process, restructure strategies of 
action, understandings of phenomena, or ways of framing problems. In my 
example, the surprise triggered by my observation of the wobble led me to frame 
a new problem: “How to keep the gate square?”
•	 Reflection gives rise to on-the-spot experiment. We think up and try out new 
actions intended to explore the newly observed phenomena, test our tentative 
understandings of them, or affirm the moves we have invented to change things 
for the better. With my measuring-string experiment, I tested both my under-
standing of squareness as equality of diagonals and the effectiveness of the pro-
cedures I had invented for determining when diagonals are equal. On-the-spot 
experiment may work, again in the sense of yielding intended results, or it may 
produce surprises that call for further reflection and experiment.
The description I have given is, of course, an idealized one. The moments of 
reflection-in-action are rarely as distinct from one another as I have made them out 
to be. The experience of surprise may present itself in such a way as to seem already 
interpreted. The criticism and restructuring of knowing-in-action may be com-
pressed into a single process. But regardless of the distinctness of its moments or the 
constancy of their sequence, what distinguishes reflection-in-action from other 
kinds of reflection is its immediate significance for action. In reflection-in-action, 
the rethinking of some part of our knowing-in-action leads to on-the-spot experi-
ment and further thinking that affects what we do – in the situation at hand and 
perhaps also in others we shall see as similar to it.
The distinction between reflection- and knowing-in-action may be subtle. A 
skilled performer adjusts his responses to variations in phenomena. In his moment-­
by-­moment appreciations of a process, he deploys a wide-ranging repertoire of 
images of contexts and actions. So a baseball pitcher adapts his pitching style to the 
peculiarities of a particular batter or situation in a game. In order to counter an 
opponent’s changing strategies, a tennis player executes split-second variations in 
play. We can say, in cases like these, that the performer responds to variation rather 
than surprise because the changes in context and response never cross the boundar-
ies of the familiar.
However, in a kind of process that may look from the outside like the ones 
described above, a skilled performer can integrate reflection-in-action into the 
smooth performance of an ongoing task. I recently heard the story of a cellist who 
Reading from Schön’s work

304
had been called to join in performing a new piece of chamber music. Because of 
illness, he missed the first few rehearsals and finally put in an appearance the day 
before the performance was to take place. He sat down with the other musicians and 
sight-read his way through the difficult part, playing it so well that the conductor 
had no need to reschedule the performance. As the cellist sight-read the score, he 
could not have known for certain where the piece was heading. Yet he must have 
sensed at each moment the direction of its development, picking up in his own per-
formance the lines of development already laid down by others. He must have 
encountered surprises in response to which he formed, online, an interpretation 
guided by his emerging sense of the whole. And the execution of this feat left him 
with a newly developed understanding of the piece and how to play it that he would 
reveal as knowing-in-action on the day of the performance.
When good jazz musicians improvise together, they similarly display reflection-­
in-­action smoothly integrated into ongoing performance. Listening to one another, 
listening to themselves, they ‘feel’ where the music is going and adjust their playing 
accordingly. A figure announced by one performer will be taken up by another, 
elaborated, turned into a new melody. Each player makes on-line inventions and 
responds to surprises triggered by the inventions of the other players. But the collec-
tive process of musical invention is organized around an underlying structure. There 
is a common schema of meter, melody, and harmonic development that gives the 
piece a predictable order. In addition, each player has at the ready a repertoire of 
musical figures around which he can weave variations as the opportunity arises. 
Improvisation consists in varying, combining, and recombining a set of figures 
within a schema that gives coherence to the whole piece. As the musicians feel the 
directions in which the music is developing, they make new sense of it. They reflect-­
in-­action on the music they are collectively making – though not, of course, in the 
medium of words.
Their process resembles the familiar patterns of everyday conversation. In a good 
conversation – in some respects predictable and in others not – participants pick up 
and develop themes of talk, each spinning out variations on her repertoire of things 
to say. Conversation is collective verbal improvisation. At times it falls into conven-
tional routines – the anecdote with side comments and reactions, for example, or the 
debate – which develop according to a pace and rhythm of interaction that the par-
ticipants seem, without conscious deliberation, to work out in common within the 
framework of an evolving division of labor. At other times, there may be surprises, 
unexpected turns of phrase or directions of development to which participants 
invent on-the-spot responses.
In such examples, the participants are making something. Out of musical materi-
als or themes of talk, they make a piece of music or a conversation, an artifact with 
its own meaning and coherence. Their reflection-in-action is a reflective conversa-
tion with the materials of a situation.

Mary Catherine Bateson
Mary Catherine Bateson is a social anthropologist and linguist. She has written 
about topics including cross-cultural issues, social and individual learning, wom-
en’s life patterns, ageing, family dynamics, AIDS, and the nature of knowledge. Her 
writing is suffused with systems ideas, especially a highly-developed form of cyber-
netics. It is deeply humanitarian, and combines a strong respect for the individual 
with an awareness of wider forces to which they relate. She exhibits what might be 
called ‘documented embodiment’, as an individual who has taken systems ideas so 
deeply into herself that they influence all of her thinking and writing, and who has 
written at length about that process.
Her work is broad but she has characterised it as all being connected with 
learning, writing that “the underlying challenge [of her work] has to do with 
becoming aware of the process that defines our humanness: we are not what we 
know but what we are willing to learn” (Bateson 2004, p. 8).
Catherine Bateson – she is usually known by her middle name – is the daughter 
of two of the other thinkers in this book, Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead. She 
has written on several occasions about the lives of her parents, worked on a number 
of projects with her father in particular, and remains the literary executor of both her 
parents. Her experience with having two very interesting parents made some of her 
early writings particularly notable, but she also has much important work of her 
own and is by no means in her parents’ shadows. She has written that “if you’re 
going to have a famous parent, have two” (Bateson 2014), and she clearly has attri-
butes and research areas taken from each of her parents. She has also observed that 
“in my family, we never simply live, we are always reflecting on our lives” (Bateson 
1984, p. 11). This constant reflection is clearly a pattern of living that she shares 
with both her parents, and demonstrates to great effect – many of her publications 
draw upon her own life experiences.
Bateson was born in 1939 in New York, and is still an active researcher. Her early 
childhood was characterised both by the frequent absences of her parents on war 
work, and by the extent to which her childhood was studied by them – they recorded 

308
and photographed her in great detail. This partly reflected their anthropological 
experience, and partly Margaret Mead’s keenness to innovate with childrearing 
methods. Catherine’s paediatrician was Benjamin Spock – she was the first on-­
demand breastfed baby he had encountered, an approach he was later to make 
famous in his books on childcare. Her parents separated in 1947 (divorcing in 1950), 
and Catherine grew up in a series of households shared with other families and 
children: “I had a rich and unusual childhood, with many adult caretakers, and I 
made my own synthesis from the models offered by my parents and the others I saw 
around me” (Bateson 1989, pp. 12–13).
Mary Catherine Bateson’s adult life has been characterised by a series of 
encounters with other cultures. She had her first encounter with life in another 
country in her final year of high school, which she spent in Israel. She took her 
degrees at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts (B.A. in Semitic 
languages in 1960) and Harvard University (Ph.D. in linguistics in 1963, specialising 
in Arabic poetry), became an instructor in Arabic at Harvard and wrote a number of 
books and articles on Arabic. After 3 years teaching at Harvard, her husband, Barkev 
Kassarjian (whom she married in 1960) took a job in Manila in the Philippines and 
Bateson moved there with him. As she later wrote, “that was the end of that career, 
like getting a degree in tropical medicine and going to Siberia. Arabic linguistics 
just didn’t hack it in Manila. This is a very common situation of women who move 
following their husbands’ careers” (Bateson 2004, p. 328). This might be considered 
ironic in the light of her later insightful writings on developments in women’s lives, 
but in another sense it reflects precisely a theme of much of her work – that “women 
suffer a great many interruptions and discontinuities, and have to start again” 
(Bateson 2004, p. 328).
Because of the lack of demand for her linguistic skills, she took a job in Manila 
teaching anthropology, something she had initially resisted given her parents’ fame 
in the field but a logical enough step given the close connection between linguistics 
and anthropology. She has worked as an anthropologist rather than a linguist since 
that time: she has never written a traditional ethnography (a large-scale monograph 
describing another culture in great detail) but follows the anthropological tradition 
of being a participant observer in that she has written at length about the several 
different cultures in which she has lived and worked. She has written of her many 
experiences of living overseas that each “was followed by a period of considering 
American society with new eyes, realizing that the same lessons were available 
here, for a rapidly changing society embracing many cultures and traditions – mul-
tiple systems of meaning – is a school of life” (Bateson 1994, pp. 238–239).
On leaving Manila in 1968, she returned to the United States, where she taught 
until 1971 at Northeastern University in Boston. She then followed her husband’s 
career again, moving in 1972 to Iran, where she was based until the Islamic 
Revolution of 1979, working at a number of Iranian universities, culminating in her 
appointment as dean of social sciences and humanities at a university in northern 
Iran. After the revolution (when Westerners were generally expelled from Iran), she 
returned to the United States, where she spent 3 years as dean of the faculty at 
Amherst College, moving in 1987 to George Mason University where she was pro-

fessor of anthropology and English until her retirement in 2001. Her further shift of 
subject reflected her increasingly narrative and personal writing style, developed in 
a series of books, which had as much a literary as a social scientific flavour.
Our discussion of Bateson’s major contributions to systems thinking will consider 
three main areas (in many ways interlocking): her parents’ legacy, her work on life 
histories, and her work on learning. Most of our focus will be on her books, of 
which she has written many and in which she has developed her ideas clearly and 
at length.
She worked on a number of projects with her father during his life. She appears 
as the ‘daughter’ character in Gregory Bateson’s celebrated metalogues (collected 
in G. Bateson 1972). Her first adult collaboration with her father was her role as 
rapporteur for the major conference on the ‘Effects of Conscious Purpose on Human 
Adaptation’, on the theme of environmental change, human systems, and epistemol-
ogy, that Gregory Bateson organised in Austria in 1968. Her book discussing the 
conference, Our Own Metaphor (M. C. Bateson 1972), is one of the most readable 
accounts of an academic conference ever produced, focusing on the people and their 
emotions (including her own) rather than providing a set of papers. In this it is 
sharply different from the much more conventional proceedings of the Macy 
conferences, in which both Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead were participants, 
as Hayles (1999, p. 76) remarks:
Catherine assumes that of course the observer affects what is seen, so she takes care to tell 
her readers about her state of mind and situation at that time …. She takes care to tell her 
readers not only what ideas were exchanged but also how the people looked and her inter-
pretation of how they were feeling.
Bateson was to continue to work with her father in shaping his final two books 
(G. Bateson 1979; Bateson and Bateson 1987), in the latter explicitly bringing out 
her own voice while respecting that of her father. After her parents’ death, she pro-
duced a memoir of their lives, and her life with them, With a Daughter’s Eye 
(Bateson 1984), which is one of the best accounts of both of her parents’ lives. The 
memoir also further developed Mary Catherine Bateson’s use of her own life and 
emotions as anthropological data.
Bateson has taken forward her parents’ legacy in other ways. She was president 
of the Institute for Intercultural Studies (IIS), set up by Margaret Mead in 1944 to 
advance intercultural relations, from 1980 until its dissolution in 2009. Through the 
IIS, she organised celebrations of the work of both parents in the centenary years of 
their birth (2001 for Mead, 2004 for Bateson), including many events and publica-
tions such as special issues of journals. She is keen, however, that her championing 
of her parents’ work not be over-protective: about her father’s work, she has writ-
ten that.
I decided very early on that I was not going to accept the position of Anna Freud, a woman 
of undoubted brilliance and conscientiousness, who became protector and arbiter of ortho-
doxy for the work of her father, Sigmund Freud. The creation of an orthodoxy around 
Freud’s work was a misapprehension of the way he wove ideas and of the way he developed 
and expressed them, which has had a negative effect on psychoanalysis (Bateson 2008, 
p. 17).

The second major strand of her work has concerned issues of age and gender, 
specifically by focusing on life histories. This approach was especially prominent in 
her book Composing a Life, which discusses the way that five women (herself and 
four friends) have shaped their lives: “each of us has worked by improvisation, dis-
covering the shape of our creation along the way, rather than pursuing a vision 
already defined” (Bateson 1989, p. 1). This concept of improvisation is core to the 
book, as a way of describing the lives of modern women, “constantly trying to make 
something coherent from conflicting elements to fit rapidly changing settings” 
(Bateson 1989, p. 3), constantly involved in new beginnings and changes, where 
“fluidity and discontinuity are central to the reality in which we live” (Bateson 
1989, p. 13) and yet we must make sense of those discontinuities and weave together 
a pattern as we live our lives. She draws analogies between living life and creating 
portmanteau works of art, such as jazz and quilt making, that entail improvisation 
(as does Donald Schön). The book is rich and powerful, and again takes Bateson’s 
own life trajectory (especially her unhappy exit from the deanship at Amherst 
College) as a key part of its story. It is one of her most widely read books, used by 
many readers going through major life changes as a way of reflecting upon their 
own life journey, and cited by academics in a range of human-centred fields such as 
nursing, social work, education, psychoanalysis and organisation studies (e.g. 
Kimble Wrye 1994; Weick 1998). She has noted that she was deliberately challeng-
ing society’s preconceptions by focusing on women’s lives:
our society tends to regard women as exceptions to the full human condition and men as 
representative, so it was somewhat mischievous of me to write a book about human beings 
in the form of a book about women, and some men have complained that they gained valu-
able insights about themselves from the book but would not have read it on their own 
(Bateson 1994, p. 239).
The success of Composing a Life, together with her writings on her parents’ 
lives, has led Bateson to take this approach further. At George Mason University, 
she taught for several years a course on life histories. She also taught this course at 
a historically black women’s college in Atlanta, Spelman College, in 1996, at the 
invitation of its president, Johnetta Cole (one of the women that appear in Composing 
a Life). This experience led to a further book about the life histories of some of the 
participants in that course (all black women of various ages), focusing on experi-
ences of race and age as well as gender, Full Circles, Overlapping Lives 
(Bateson 2000).
In her most recent development of this work, she has focused on the lives of older 
people, in a book entitled Composing a Further Life (Bateson 2010). She observes 
that active adulthood has split for many people into two stages preceding old age, 
Adulthood I which includes child-rearing and the building of careers, and a later 
stage of Adulthood II characterised by “active wisdom” in which “you have done 
much of what you hoped to do in life but it is not too late to do something more or 
different” (Bateson 2010, p. 19). A highly systemic emphasis of the book is that of 
interdependence as opposed to a dichotomy between dependence and indepen-
dence, that “we need to compose our lives in ways that we both give and receive, 
30  Mary Catherine Bateson

311
learning to do both with grace, seeing both as part of a single pattern rather than 
antithetical alternatives” (Bateson 2010, p. 7).
As we mentioned at the start of this chapter, Bateson sees all her work as being 
concerned with learning throughout life, but some of her writing is quite explicitly 
focused on this issue, and forms the third major strand of her work. She has espe-
cially done this in two books. The first was Peripheral Visions, a book about learn-
ing from experience (again, with many illustrations from her own life in different 
cultures), of which she observes: “each person is calibrated by experience, almost 
like a measuring instrument for difference, so discomfort is informative and offers 
a starting point for new understanding” (Bateson 1994, p. 17). The second book was 
Willing to Learn (Bateson 2004) in which she collects together articles, speeches 
and some book excerpts from throughout her career which cover the broad theme of 
learning. In a newspaper article discussing this theme, she has argued that “willing-
ness to learn demands respect for others across difference. Puzzling and even dis-
turbing ideas are invitations to curiosity, and the greater the difference the more 
there may be to be learned …. willingness to learn is a form of spirituality. It is a 
stance of humility, because there is so much to be learned” (Bateson 2005).
An aspect of her work on learning which has been present throughout her career 
but particularly appears in Willing to Learn is a focus on epistemology – ways of 
thinking and knowing the world, a favourite theme of her father’s which she has also 
taken up. She considers many issues within this theme – participation, transcen-
dence, multiple ways of knowing, ambiguity, ethics, and the implications for our 
consciousness of AIDS. It is by no means a purely philosophical issue for her, but 
relates deeply to the way we live our lives, organise society, and (through its relation 
to environmentalism) manage our world.
Mary Catherine Bateson is a wise and compassionate thinker and writer, who 
“communicates a strong sense of optimism, hope and multiculturalism” in her writ-
ing (Janesick 2005, p. 2). She lives a life that has been examined in depth by herself 
and others from her earliest childhood, and has served as data for her highly sys-
temic form of anthropology. She writes that “my background has led me to a life-
long search for pattern and its recurrence in different contexts … this has meant a 
lifelong rhythm of introspection, connecting personal experiences to more distant 
phenomena, exploring and testing metaphors and analogies to see what new insight 
they might reveal” (Bateson 2004, p.  3). This approach has brought many new 
insights, and exemplifies a mature, self-aware and deeply rooted form of systems 
thinking at its best.

We have always shared, we human beings, some portion of the nomadic pattern. 
We evolved in Africa, standing upright and foraging for food, moving on as resources 
dictated. Mobility demands continuing learning, since the survival of migrants 
depends on the capacity of adults to cope with the unfamiliar. Mobility also engages 
one of our most basic characteristics, curiosity. We developed the capacity to learn 
and the skill to teach that made it possible to travel from continent to continent, 
adopting new behaviors adapted to every kind of environment. Over time, humans 
made the inventions that allowed them to settle and to support ever larger numbers. 
Yet movement – and the idea of movement – have remained part of the human rep-
ertoire even among the most adamantly settled of peasants. Few groups have been 
so profoundly isolated that the notion of learning from strangers is entirely absent – 
even when the last outsiders are so obscured by time that they are remembered as 
visiting gods.
We learn from difference, but difference often triggers hostility. A pattern of 
interdependent adaptations, linked by exchange and trade, recurs on every continent 
and often alternates with conflict. The nomadic tribes of Arabia, for instance, moved 
to find water and grazing for their animals – camels, sheep, or horses – but main-
tained a symbiotic relationship with settled farmers with whom they traded animal 
products for grain. When populations have exceeded carrying capacity, large num-
bers have spilled out into surrounding areas, often arriving as invaders but gradually 
learning to live with new neighbors and blending cultural traditions. The planet is 
now effectively peopled and interconnected, but surges of migration continue. The 
search for living space and resources for our elaborate forms of subsistence results 
in conflict of many kinds as well as learning. And as always, we make war with 
elaborate rhetoric and refer to different beliefs to underline our separations.
We are a single species with a common origin, but we are not notably good at 
putting it all back together. In the course of their migrations, local populations of 
human beings lived for millennia largely cut off from one another, developing the 
variations in physical characteristics that are referred to as race and building up 
complex learned systems of language and culture and belief. We remain very much 
attached to the distinctive traditions that continue to keep us apart, yet we are 
attracted by both novelty and the idea of uniformity, while curiosity is often at odds 
with loyalty. So people ask, sometimes in hope and sometimes in horror: Will all 
human beings eventually speak the same language? Will everyone accept a single 
religion? Will there be so much intermarriage that everyone will look the same? 
Probably none of the above.
Today we are nomads of the imagination, increasingly familiar with other 
cultures. In huge numbers, we travel the globe for recreation as often as for survival. 
And we are nomads in another sense, constantly moving on in our lives and adjust-
ing to new circumstances even in the place called home, abandoning familiar con-
stancies. Ruth Benedict, an anthropologist who often felt like an outsider in her own 
culture, imagined that for every temperament there might somewhere be a society 
that would be hospitable in a distinctive way. Even so, her vision was based on 
homogeneity within a given society and on the expectation of continuity and consis-
tency over a lifetime. Today, we can begin to live in a world where individuals are

313
able to sojourn with the cultures or religious expressions that most nearly match 
their deepest longings. That match might vary at particular stages of the life cycle, 
however, guiding choices that need not be irreversible, just as we are finding time in 
extended lives for changes in careers and marriages and sexual orientations. Perhaps 
we will learn to live in a shifting and multicultural world by building on the ancient 
human patterns and skills of nomads.
[…]
We are perhaps becoming nomads in what we care about, so that change and 
novelty have come to seem more important than continuity and tradition. If values 
once learned are to be kept flexible and adaptable, there is a need to learn to modify, 
question, and reintegrate existing values, not simply to discard them. The experi-
ence of learning some new value could be used to provide models for integrating 
new understandings into existing ones in other new situations. Many Americans can 
remember that the handicapped were invisible to them until they learned to include 
them in their thinking; can that memory help them to listen and respond differently 
to some newly recognized excluded group, and how far can the concept of access be 
generalized? Is there then deutero-learning (learning to learn) in the area of values? 
Something that is good in a given context can be a danger when the context changes. 
Today in particular, we live in a world of change, so that our values or the way they 
are configured or the way we interpret and implement them must be flexible and 
changeable.
Everyone has some skills for dealing with the kinds of differences that always 
exist, even in so-called homogeneous societies, like the interaction across difference 
that obviously happens between adults and children and leads to learning, but often 
the adults do not recognize that they too are learning and changing.
Thinking about multicultural societies or societies in the process of change 
would be less threatening if we would re-examine the assumptions we make about 
continuity in ourselves. I have argued that we need to reflect on the most intimate 
kinds of diversity and strangeness – strangeness in the self and strangeness in those 
we love most. We need to question assumptions about the degree of uniformity 
needed for society to function also. Honing the skills of dealing with diversity 
means listening and learning as well as making do. There is a whole history of 
inventions that make limited mutual understanding tolerable, lingua francas and 
pidgins for dealing with practical needs, forms of translation like monetization, or 
seeing everything in zero-sum terms. Sometimes working alliances based on differ-
ent goals and crude approximations fall apart, but sometimes they mature and deepen.
A multicultural society does require some metavalues, such as those that are 
embedded in the American Constitution, which has allowed for growth and adapta-
tion. One of these metavalues is what we call ‘pluralism’. Pluralism essentially 
means that, whatever I believe at a moment in time, it is valuable – not just tolera-
ble – to me that there are people around me whose beliefs are different. The concept 
of a democracy, in which you understand that you benefit from the presence and 
often success of people with whom you disagree, is analogous to the concept of an 
ecosystem. Different species, after their order, sometimes compete, some times 
cooperate, and sometimes live right past and hardly encounter each other. Still, they

are present and in the broadest sense interdependent, not each on each but throughout 
the system. There are interior or spiritual aspects of pluralism. Empathy makes it 
possible to bridge differences, but one is changed in that process. In fact, if we 
visualize a continual diverse interaction of points of view and a habit of trying to 
understand the ideas of others, this becomes a definition of lifelong learning and 
changing in which the teacher is necessarily a learner, because there is no fixed truth 
in this fluid world, and the learner is necessarily a teacher, as of course newborn 
infants are teachers who train their mothers and fathers in the art of being parents.
It’s confusing, but we have a right to be confused. Perhaps even a need. The trick 
is to enjoy it: to savor complexity and resist the easy answers; to let diversity flower 
into creativity. Politicians again and again try to wean people from the effort to 
understand complexity. They know, for instance, that war is the great simplification 
that makes it possible to silence dissonant opinions and to decide once and for all 
that guns are more important than butter instead of seeking a more complex balance.

Afterword to the First Edition: The Story 
Behind This Book
Let me tell you how this book arose. When Magnus and I joined the systems group 
at the UK’s Open University in September 2000, the group was in the midst of a 
‘meta project’. The idea was that instead of re-writing all our basic systems teaching 
each time a new course was written, the group would work together on a set of basic 
systems materials which would be shared by all our systems courses. The hope was 
that this would lead to a better quality of teaching on these core topics, alleviating 
both the pressures on our own time, and the confusion of our students.
Three texts had already been created but the fourth – a set of pieces by key sys-
tems thinkers – was missing. I was interested in the omission because – being rela-
tively new to systems thinking, having come into the group primarily as a teacher 
and practitioner – I was longing to read this fourth text. Like many of our students, 
I was familiar with basic systems ideas and approaches, but felt lost without a sense 
of the history and geography – the territory – of the field I was now working in.
While we worked as members of the same course team, the case of the unwritten 
text remained an issue in the systems group. There had been conversations, attempts 
to make a start, but nothing had followed. Two problems were mentioned. One was 
the embarrassing absence of celebrated women writers in the field: you couldn’t 
produce such a text without drawing attention to this, and it didn’t sit well with our 
image of ourselves or of the field. The more intractable problem was the impossibil-
ity of reaching agreement on which authors should be included in the book. The 
introduction has already covered some of the reasons for this, but there was another: 
we were a group where everyone spoke, everyone had their say. And if everyone had 
their say about who should or shouldn’t be included, the conversation would go on 
for ever without resolution.
Magnus and I did some preliminary work on the project, thinking about who 
might appreciate such a collection of readings, and what they might get out of it. We 
became excited at the idea of a book which would bring together the various strands 
of systems thinking, so that readers familiar with one systems tradition could dis-
cover a breadth in the field that they had perhaps been unaware of, encountering 
other authors they would value and enjoy.

316
We also felt it was important that students of systems could begin to gain a sense 
of ownership of the field – of knowing their way around what can otherwise seem a 
mysterious and almost unbounded domain – and that such a book could address 
this need.
Somewhat tentatively we decided to take the project on. We designed a learning 
process for working together on the book: taking one author a fortnight, finding a 
good representative piece of their work, studying it and discussing it, before writing 
a short piece describing the author’s contribution to the field. But explicitly with 
myself in the role of learner and Magnus in the role of guide. It was a neat design: 
putting together two distinct needs – mine for knowledge and Magnus’s for motiva-
tion – to create a solution.
We needed the group’s agreement to proceed. But when we told them of our 
plans we were dismayed to find that everyone else wanted to join in. If Magnus was 
going to do the work of finding the extracts, they too wanted to read them, and to 
have their say. We knew that if this became a whole-group project the book would 
never get written. Alongside the issue of reaching agreement on which authors to 
include, and the politics of deciding who would write what, it raised questions about 
motivation and quality. We knew that we would be distracted and discouraged if the 
audience for our early drafts was too wide or too voluble. So we went away to 
devise a process which would allow everyone to be involved but which would 
enhance rather than derail the project. Our solution was the systems study group.
The study group, which Magnus and I co-facilitated, met once a fortnight over a 
period of two and a half years. During that time we studied 50 key systems thinkers. 
We had expected interest in the project to wane after the first few meetings, but to 
our surprise a good proportion of the systems group attended, and the numbers 
remained fairly stable. Given the group’s tendency to stray from the topic in hand 
onto questions of process, and our desire to create a democratic forum where every-
one’s view was respected, we designed a simple structure for meetings, and chaired 
them fairly tightly to this structure. This may have frustrated one or two more domi-
nant members, but we felt that the inclusive structure was one of the reasons that 
interest was sustained over such a long period.
This is how it worked: Magnus made a working list of authors, roughly grouped 
by school or application area. We didn’t publish this in advance because we expected 
the list to evolve over time; and we found that people seemed to enjoy the suspense 
of seeing who would come next. For each author in turn, Magnus would painstak-
ingly assemble as much of their work as possible. From this collection we would 
select a reading, and e-mail details of the author and reading to the group. The proj-
ect secretary made copies which people could pick up from her office, and everyone 
had about a week to read it before we met. We had a regular lunchtime slot, lasting 
an hour and a half.
The meeting would start with Magnus explaining why he’d chosen the author, 
and a few words about their work and context. Then someone would volunteer to 
start, and each participant would have a turn to say anything they wanted to: perhaps 
their thoughts on or reactions to the reading, perhaps making connections and com-
parisons with other authors, perhaps sharing insights or anecdotes about the author. 
Afterword to the First Edition: The Story Behind This Book

317
Once everyone had spoken, people would be itching to respond to points others had 
raised, and we would go into open discussion – generally animated, stimulating and 
playful, with widely divergent views.
We had arguments with colleagues about the idea of providing any sort of ‘map’ 
of the territory. Of course there is no ‘true’ map – an individual might lay out the 
connections between these authors in any number of ways, to reveal a different pat-
tern. By providing a model we emphasise certain connections, but underplay others. 
Yet to offer no map at all – no structure – is to deny the explorer a vital aid to their 
journey. Without some sort of map, the learner cannot even start to lay down the 
interconnections in memory. This map, which over time they will refine, extend, 
amend, embellish, and colour with their own experiences, preferences and insights 
can only ever be an approximation, a starting point from which the individual can 
set out. The categories by which we have grouped our thirty thinkers provide such a 
structure, represented graphically in the diagram at the start of the book (Fig. 0.1).
Magnus and I knew from the start that we were interested in the individual 
authors themselves, as well as their work. The study group demonstrated that this 
interest was echoed in others; we found that discussions dwelled as often on the 
character and behaviour of the author, their relationships with others or the context 
of their life, as on their contribution to the field. We felt that developing a sense of 
ownership of the field entailed having a sense of knowing the significant individuals 
in the field, as well as knowing what they had written.
By offering insights into an author’s life, I think we wanted to support the sense 
of relationship that a reader can experience after studying an author in depth when, 
arriving at powerful new understandings which change the way that individual 
looks at the world, they can feel an enduring connection the author, almost a sense 
of gaining a mentor or guide they can converse with in imagination.
When Magnus presented a paper on this project at the UK Systems Society con-
ference in 2006, one of the listeners commented with some frustration that it 
sounded as if it would be a book of ‘the dead and the nearly dead’. It seems to me 
that the learning to which academia aspires moves forward in leaps and dribbles. 
Most published research doesn’t supersede what precedes it, but adds to it by very 
small steps. Occasionally an idea emerges which is profoundly original, and which 
sets everyone off in a new direction. This is followed by a period of consolidation, 
where others draw on the idea, refine it perhaps, relate it to other theory, and put it 
to practical use.
Of course there is a case for reinterpreting such significant thinking for a new 
generation – translating it into the language of the day. But there is also a case for 
returning to the original work to ensure that you have understood the thinking pre-
cisely and in all its subtlety, and to search for other nuances and conceptions which 
may yet remain undiscovered.
And besides, to label a piece of writing uninteresting or irrelevant simply because 
it is old is to dismiss the whole of academic endeavour. Every fresh and exciting 
piece of work will be old in a few years time; is all of it then ultimately worthless?
As I write this I’m reminded of a pattern of behaviour I commented on in the 
study group. Author after author would express – perhaps in a later edition of a 
Afterword to the First Edition: The Story Behind This Book

318
seminal work – great frustration that people hadn’t properly understood what they 
had meant. Followers had grasped the gist of it, but hadn’t absorbed the full idea in 
its richness and depth, or with all its implications. This underlined for me the impor-
tance of studying the original authors, rather than assuming their ideas could be 
picked up by reading only more recent writers.
The study group concluded in summer 2005, after which we were able to begin 
work on the book itself. This required a second cycle of assembling and studying 
each author’s work, together with various secondary materials. In fact we cycled 
through our set of 30 thinkers at least four more times, as Magnus wrote and revised 
drafts and I reviewed them. We were often seen in one or other of the campus cafes, 
absorbed in discussion of the current week’s draft.
In all our work, I have tended to be an advocate for the less expert reader, while 
Magnus has been the one to uphold academic values and to do the painstaking 
research necessary to construct each chapter. Sometimes I like to think that my 
name on the cover stands for every unnamed collaborator who has contributed to the 
thinking attributed to our celebrated authors. Magnus and I have had so many dis-
cussions about how ideas evolve in an academic community; about the strangeness 
of saying that an idea ‘belongs’ to one individual. We’ve puzzled over this, trying to 
understand the nature of the communities and families these thinkers worked 
amongst. We’ve tried out stories – based on glimpses from documented comments 
and conversations, or the personal experience of study group members – of how the 
relationships may have worked between these individuals and their fellows; this 
based also on our own experiences of how things go in academia. So much thinking 
evolves through conversation. And for these conversations to take place there have 
to be listeners as well as speakers. There have to be meeting organisers, process 
designers, chairs and facilitators. There have to be believers and promoters. There 
have to be teachers and communicators to translate the original thinker’s dense aca-
demic text into a form that can be digested and promulgated more widely. I see these 
stretched out like a child’s cut-out paperchain of figures, hand in hand, passing the 
potent ideas along  – transforming them, playing with them, showing how they 
might be understood or applied.
We hope that our book will play its part in this chain of communication, with 
your participation. The material above gave you a taste of the writing, and an insight 
into the person, of thirty key systems thinkers. You may have arrived here because 
you were already familiar with some of them. Our hope is that you have found oth-
ers to excite and inspire you. And perhaps that by encouraging readers to return to 
some of these ‘original source’ authors, and to venture across the boundaries 
between traditions, the field of systems will be strengthened and enriched, ulti-
mately providing solid ground for the development of powerful new thinking.
