Abstract
We investigate the gauge/gravity duality between
the N = 6 mass-deformed ABJM theory with Uk(N) ×
U−k(N) gauge symmetry and the 11-dimensional supergrav-
ity on LLM geometries with SO(2,1)×SO(4)/Zk ×SO(4)/Zk
isometry, in terms of a KK holography, which involves
quadratic order ﬁeld redeﬁnitions. We establish the quadratic
order KK mappings for various gauge invariant ﬁelds in order
to obtain the canonical 4-dimensional gravity equations of
motion and to reduce the LLM solutions to an asymptoti-
cally AdS4 gravity solutions. The non-linearity of the KK
maps indicates that we can observe the true purpose of the
non-linear KK holography of the LLM solutions. We read
the vacuum expectation value of conformal dimension two
operator from the asymptotically AdS4 gravity solutions.
For the LLM solutions which are represented by square-
shaped Young diagrams, we compare the vacuum expec-
tation value obtained from the holographic procedure with
the result obtained from the ﬁeld theory, which is given by
⟨O(=2)⟩=
√
kN

2 f(=2) + O(N), where f is indepen-
dent of N. Based on this result, we examine the gauge/gravity
duality in the large N limit and ﬁnite k. We also show that
the vacuum expectation values of the massive KK graviton
modes are vanishing as expected by the supersymmetry.

1 Introduction
AdS/CFT correspondence [1–3] and its various deformations
have been a central paradigm for the past two decades in the-
oretical physics. Among the deformations, we consider the
supersymmetry preserving mass deformation [4,5] of the 3-
dimensional N = 6 Uk(N) × U−k(N) Aharony-Bergman-
Jafferis-Maldacena(ABJM)theorywithChern–Simonslevel
k [6], which is dual to the 11-dimensional supergravity on the
Lin–Lunin–Maldacena (LLM) geometries [7] with Zk orb-
ifold and SO(2,1)×SO(4)/Zk×SO(4)/Zk isometry. The cor-
respondence between the supersymmetric vacua of the mass-
deformed ABJM theory (mABJM) and the LLM geometries
with Zk orbifold was reported in [8].
Recently, we have disclosed more evidence for the
gauge/gravity duality between the mABJM theory and the
11-dimensional supergravity on the LLM geometry with
SO(2,1) ×SO(4)/Zk×SO(4)/Zk isometry [9,10]. We cal-
culated the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of a chiral
primary operator (CPO) of conformal dimension  = 1,
from all supersymmetric vacua of the mABJM theory in
the large N limit and from the LLM solutions in the 11-
dimensional supergravity in terms of the gauge/gravity dic-
tionary [2,3]. In order to show the duality, we deﬁned the
4-dimensional dual scalar modes obtained from the proce-
dure of the Kaluza–Klein (KK) holography [11–13] for the
11-dimensional supergravity. We found an exact dual rela-

tion between the two results for all possible supersymmetric
solutions in both sides in the large N limit.
In the case of the CPO of conformal dimension  = 1,
linearized Einstein equations and asymptotic expansion of
the LLM solutions upto the linear order were sufﬁcient to
read the vev. In that case, the KK maps between the 4-
dimensional ﬁelds and 11-dimensional ﬁelds are trivial. In
this paper, we extend to the case of CPO of conformal dimen-
sion  = 2, which requires non-linear KK maps. We start
with the compactiﬁcation on S7/Zk of the 11-dimensional
gravity equations in which the dynamical ﬁelds are writ-
ten as a sum of the AdS4 × S7/Zk background and ﬂuctua-
tions. To obtain the vevs of the CPO of conformal dimension
 = 2, it is sufﬁcient to write the equations of motion up
to the quadratic terms in ﬂuctuations. After some manipula-
tions for equations of gauge invariant ﬂuctuation modes, we
ﬁnd that the quadratic terms contain higher derivatives, and
thus we need to introduce some non-trivial ﬁeld redeﬁnitions
(the KK maps) to obtain the canonical equations of motion
for the 4-dimensional ﬁelds. The asymptotically AdS4 solu-
tions to the resulting 4-dimensional equations of motion are
obtained from the asymptotic expansion of the LLM solu-
tions and combining various ﬁelds in the expansion, accord-
ing to our well established non-linear KK maps. Using the
holographicrenormalizationandasymptoticexpansionofthe
LLM geometries, we read the vevs of the CPO of conformal
dimension  = 2 and also conﬁrm that the vevs of some
massive KK graviton modes are vanishing as required by
supersymmetry.1 On the ﬁeld theory side, we use the dis-
crete Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory to determine the
vev of the CPO of conformal dimension  = 2 in the large
N limit. Due to computational difﬁculty, we focus on the
case of the LLM solutions which are represented by square-
shaped Young diagrams and we show that, in the large N
limit and ﬁnite k, the vev obtained from both the ﬁeld theory
side and the gravity side is ⟨O(=2)⟩=
√
kN

2 f(=2), where
f is independent of N.
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. In
Sect. 2, we apply the KK reduction to 11-dimensional super-
gravity equations and obtain the equations for 4-dimensional
gauge invariant ﬁelds. We also establish the non-trivial KK
maps for some 4-dimensional gauge invariant ﬁelds. In
Sect. 3, we obtain the CPO of conformal dimension  = 2
in the mABJM theory and determine its vev from the dis-
crete Higgs vacua. In Sect. 4, we rearrange the asymp-
totic expansion of the LLM solutions according to our KK
maps to obtain the asymptotically AdS4 solutions of the 4-
dimensional gravity equations of motion. From these solu-
tions, we read the vevs of various 4-dimensional KK modes,
using the gauge/gravity dictionary. In Sect. 5, we compare the
gravity and the ﬁeld theory results for the vevs of the CPOs
1 See [16] for results of zeroth KK graviton modes.
and determine the values of some normalization factors. In
Sect. 6, we draw our conclusions. In the Appendix, we give
some details about the construction of CPO of conformal
dimension  = 2.
2 KK reduction of 11-dimensional gravity
In this section, we discuss the compactiﬁcation of 11-
dimensionalgravityon S7/Zk.Thecompactiﬁcationinvolves
expansion of the 11-dimensional ﬂuctuations in terms of
the spherical harmonics on S7/Zk and then projecting the
equations of motions on those spherical harmonics to obtain
the equations of motion for various KK modes. The result-
ing equations contain higher derivatives of those KK modes
and the necessary KK maps are introduced for obtaining the
canonical equations of motion of the 4-dimensional dynami-
cal ﬁelds. The non-linear KK maps established in this section
are used in Sect. 4 to obtain the asymptotically AdS4 solu-
tions of 4-dimensional gravity equations of motion from the
KK reduction of the LLM solutions. The vev of the CPO of
conformal dimension  = 2 is read from such asymptotic
solutions.
2.1 Field equations at quadratic order
In [16], we have written the 11-dimensional gravity equa-
tions of motion up to quadratic order in the ﬂuctuations by
perturbing the ﬁelds around the AdS4 × S7/Zk background
as
gpq = gpq + h pq,
Fpqrs = Fpqrs + f pqrs,
(2.1)
where p, q, · · · = 0, · · · , 10. For clarity, we summarize
those quadratic order equations. The quadratic order equa-
tions are obtained by inserting (2.1) into the 11-dimensional
gravity equations of motion and keeping all the terms up to
quadratic order in the ﬂuctuations h pq and f pqrs. The results
are

The KK reduction of the 11-dimensional gravity to 4-
dimensional gravity involves the expansion of the ﬂuctua-
tions h pq and f pqrs in terms of the spherical harmonics on
S7/Zk, with the metric

(2.6)
where L is the radius of S7. Later, we will identify the ﬂuc-
tuations h pq and f pqrs with the deviations of the LLM solu-
tions from the AdS4 × S7/Zk solutions. Keeping in mind the
SO(2,1)×SO(4)/Zk ×SO(4)/Zk isometry of the LLM solu-
tions, we consider expansions in terms of the spherical har-
monics with SO(4)/Zk × SO(4)/Zk symmetry. Since those
spherical harmonics depend only on the τ coordinate, they
are not affected by the orbifolding. This implies that expan-
sions of the ﬂuctuations h pq and f pqrs in terms of these
spherical harmonics are the same, irrespective of the orb-
ifolding. Therefore, in this section, we treat the expansion
of the ﬂuctuations h pq and f pqrs in terms of the spherical
harmonics on S7 and reintroduce the Chern–Simons level k
in the following sections.
In [9,10], we have written a complete form of these expan-
sions whereas we have argued in [16] that many of the
KK modes do not contribute to the equations of motion at
quadratic order. Therefore, we use the following truncated
expansions,
hμν(x, y) = hI1
μν(x)Y I1(y),
hρρ(x, y) = hI1(x)Y I1(y),
h(ab) = sI1(x)∇(a∇b)Y I1(y),

abc(y),
fabcd(x, y) = 4t I35(x)∇[aY I35
bcd](y),
(2.7)
where In = 0, 1, 2, . . ., we have split the 11-dimensional
indices into the AdS4 indices (μ, ν, · · · = 0, · · · , 3) and the
S7 indices (a, b, · · · = 4, · · · , 10), x denotes the AdS4 coor-
dinates and y denotes the S7 coordinates. The notation (ab)
means symmetrized traceless combination, while [ab · · · ]
denotes complete antisymmetrization of indices. Here, Y I1
and Y I35
abc are the scalar and antisymmetric 3-tensor spherical
harmonics on S7, respectively.
Plugging (2.7) into the (μν) component of (2.2) and then
projecting on the scalar spherical harmonics Y I1, we obtain

2.2 Quadratic order equations for KK modes
The quadratic order equations we listed in the previous sub-
section lead to the quadratic order equations of motions for
various 4-dimensional gauge invariant KK modes. In general,
the 4-dimensional gravity spectrum, which is obtained from
the KK reduction of the 11-dimensional gravity, is composed
of three towers of scalar modes, two towers of pseudoscalar
modes, two towers of vector modes, one tower of pseudovec-
tor modes, and one tower of spin-two modes [9,10]. Here,
we follow the gauge choice of the LLM solutions in which
hμa and fμνab are zero and as a result some of the KK towers
are absent. In addition, in this paper, we are interested in the
gravity ﬁeld which is dual to the CPO of conformal dimen-
sion  = 2 in the mABJM theory. Such dual gravity ﬁeld is
a part of the three KK towers of scalar modes with I1 = 4.
Therefore, from now on we focus on the equations of motion
for the KK modes with I1 = 4.
Setting I1 = 4 in (2.8)–(2.15) and rearranging the equa-
tions, we obtain the following set of equations,

μ , hI1, φI1, uI1, s I1, t I35 and their derivatives, with
inﬁnitesummations over I1 and I35. TheLLMsolutionsolves
the 11-dimensional equations of motion order by order in
the mass parameter μ0 of the LLM geometries [9,10,16]. In
the above equations of motion, we have kept only up to the
quadratic terms in the ﬂuctuations and they are expected to
be solved by the LLM solution only up to quadratic order
in μ0. On the other hand, except for the modes with I1 = 2
and I35 = 1, the asymptotic expansions of the other modes
are non-linear in the expansion parameter μ0. Thus, the rel-
evant quadratic terms in the above equations are built only
by the modes with I1 = 2 and I35 = 1. In addition, we note
that for the spherical harmonics on S7 with SO(4) × SO(4)

ics. In that case, the terms involving t I35=1 are also absent and
the quadratic terms depend only on h2
μν, t2
μ, h2, φ2, u2, s2
and their derivatives. Combining the four scalar ﬁelds
h2, φ2, u2, s2, we obtain two gauge invariant physical mode,
ˇφ2 =

70(7 ˆψ2 + 18 ˆφ2), ˇψ2 =

70(7 ˆψ2 −162 ˆφ2), which
are mass eigenstates. The other potentially relevant gauge

mode, which is given by

In general, our quadratic terms depend on the two physical
scalar modes ( ˇφ2, ˇψ2) and the second KK massive graviton
mode ˇh2
(μν). However, the leading order terms in the asymp-
totic expansions of ˇh2
(μν) and ˇφ2 are μ3
0-order, and they are
irrelevant for quadratic order equations. As a result, the oth-
erwise very complex quadratic terms are composed of only
ˇψ2, and are given by

This shows that the usual compactiﬁcation of the 11-
dimensional supergravity on S7 results in the ﬁeld equations
which contain higher derivative terms. In order to obtain
the canonical 4-dimensional gravity equations of motion, we
need to introduce some ﬁeld redeﬁnitions to absorb those
higher derivative terms [11,14–16]. For instance, for some
scalar KK mode whose equation of motion contains up to
four derivatives, the ﬁeld redeﬁnition is of the form
SI = s I + KI J1 J2t J1t J2 + L I J1 J2∇μt J1∇μt J2,
(2.27)
where KI J1 J2, L I J1 J2 are some numerical coefﬁcients, s I
represent a gauge invariant 11-dimensional ﬁeld and SI is
thecorresponding4-dimensionalﬁeld.Thet Ji ’srepresentthe
gauge invariant 11-dimensional ﬁelds that appear in higher
derivative part of the equations of motion of s I. In Sect. 5,
we will use the asymptotic expansion of the 4-dimensional
ﬁeld SI to read the vev of the dual operator. Then, the non-
linearity of the ﬁeld redeﬁnition (2.27) shows that the vev
gets contributions from terms which are non-linear in the
11-dimensional ﬁelds.
The 4-dimensional gravity equations of motion should

4-dimensional ﬁelds (4, 4).
2.2.2 Spin-two ﬁeld equations
The equation of motion for the fourth KK massive graviton
mode is a linear combinations of the Eqs. (2.16)–(2.19). Let
us deﬁne the spin-two mass eigenstate as

tion (2.17) to eliminate ˆJ 4

The last equation is the KK map for the fourth KK graviton
mode in quadratic order in the mass parameter. The non-
linear KK maps for the scalar and tensor modes given in
(2.29) and (2.41), respectively, are crucial in holographic
determinationof the vevs of gaugeinvariant operators, which
are dual to these KK modes. See Sect. 4.
3 Gauge invariant operators and Vevs in mABJM
theory
In the previous section, we deﬁned the physical modes in
4-dimensions using various non-linear KK maps including
higherderivatives.Thesephysicalmodeshavecorresponding
operators by the gauge/gravity dictionary. In this section, we
discuss possible operators with conformal dimension  = 2
in the ABJM theory and read the vevs of those operators in
the large N limit from the vacua of the mABJM theory.
3.1 Vacua in the mABJM theory
The mass term in the mABJM theory breaks the SU(4) global
symmetry of the ABJM theory to SU(2) × SU(2) × U(1).
According to the reduced global symmetry, we split the
four-complex scalar ﬁelds in the ABJM theory as Y A =
(Za, W †a), where A = 1, 2, 3, 4 and a, b = 1, 2. Accord-
ingly, the vacuum equation in the mABJM theory is written
as
Za Z†
b Zb −ZbZ†
b Za = −μk
2π Za,
W †aWbW †b −W †bWbW †a = μk
2π W †a,
Wa ZbWb −WbZbWa = 0,
ZbWbZa −ZaWbZb = 0,
(3.1)
where μ is a mass parameter. The solutions of those vac-
uum equations have been obtained in [5] and are presented
by a direct sums of two types of irreducible n × (n + 1)
matrices M(n)
a
(a = 1, 2) and their Hermitian conjugates,

3.2 Gauge invariant operators in the ABJM theory

M2
 I1 = I1(I1−6)

and conformal dimensions  = I1
2 , {I1 =
2, 4, 6, . . .} [9,10]. The dual gauge invariant operators for the
other KK towers of scalar modes are the descendent of these
CPOs, which are obtained by applying the supersymmetry
generators of the N = 6 mABJM theory to O(). In partic-
ular, the gauge invariant operators dual to the scalar modes
I1 are obtained by applying six supersymmetry generators
to the CPO and thus they are given by

where ψ†a with a = 1, 2, 3, 4 are the four complex fermionic

mine the form of the O(=1) was explained in the Appendix
A.4 of [9,10]. However, we ﬁx the normalization factor N1
in a different way, which matches the GKP-W relation [2,3]
in the gauge/gravity dictionary. We will explain the details
later.
In this section, we consider the CPO with  = 2, which
reﬂects the global SU(2)×SU(2)×U(1) symmetry of the

4 Asymptotic behavior of LLM geometries and

where the ˜gi(z, τ) represent the deviation of the LLM metric
from the AdS4×S7 background. See [9,10] for details. Simi-
larly, the 4-form ﬁeld strength of the LLM geometries can be
split into the background and the ﬂuctuations. The values of
the various KK modes (hI1
μν, φI1, . . .), introduced in Sect. 2,
are read from the asymptotic expansion of ˜gi(z, τ) and the
similar functions in 4-form ﬁeld strength. In [9,10], we have
listed the full result for all the KK modes up to μ2
0 order.
As mentioned in the previous section, here we focus on the
equations of motion for the fourth KK scalar and graviton
modes. For the quadratic parts in the equations of motion
and in the KK maps discussed in the previous section, we
also need the asymptotic expansion of ˇψ2. Then we take the
following results for the 11-dimensional modes from [9,10]

Since all the terms in (4.6) are already at least quadratic in μ0,
the above coordinate transformation only amounts to replacing
z by ˜z in those terms.

ambiguity in the deﬁnition of the one-point function, which comes from
the deﬁnition of the source term in the generating functional of the n-
point functions. In order to ﬁx this ambiguity denoted as N1,2 in our
case, one has to compare the values of the one point functions in the ﬁeld
theory and those in the supergravity. For the detailed discussion for this
issue, for instance, see (5.19)–(5.21) in [11], where the normalization
factors were ﬁxed from the values of two point correlation functions.

In order to ﬁx the normalization factor N2 in (3.10), we con-
sider a symmetric droplet case with k ̸= 1. The corresponding
droplet and Young diagram representations in the LLM geome-
tries are depicted in Fig.1. In this case, we set k = a
n , N = na,
and A = kN = a2. Then by ﬁxing the coordinate of the Fermi
level as ˜x2 = ˜xF = 0,6 we obtain
C1 = C3 = 0,

We examine validity of the holographic renormalization (5.9)

In general the normalization factors of operators in the
gauge/gravitydualityareﬁxedintermsoftwopointfunctions
in conformal ﬁeld theory, by comparing the quantities in ﬁeld
theory side and the corresponding ones in gravity side [11].
However, in our case the forms of operators (for instance, see
(3.10)) are too complicated, and so, it is a non-trivial problem
to calculate the corresponding two point function in gravity
side. It will be interesting if one can calculate the two point
function for O(=2) in gravity side in the future and check
the validity of the normalization factor in (5.13), which was
ﬁxed by the calculation of the one-point function.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we obtained the vevs of gauge invariant opera-
tors up to μ2
0-order in terms of the holographic renormaliza-
tion in the mABJM theory. We found that the vevs of gauge
invariantoperatorsarevanishinguptoμ2
0-orderexpectforthe
case of the CPOs with conformal dimension  = 1, 2. For
the latter cases, the vevs were obtained using the KK holog-
raphy in the large N limit. In order to show validity of the
holographic relation, we compared the vevs from the super-
symmetric vacua of the mABJM theory with those from the
LLM solutions. Our results for the CPO of conformal dimen-
sion  = 2 are limited to the cases of the LLM solutions,
which are represented by a square-shaped Young diagrams.
We showed that the vevs obtained from the mABJM theory
with an appropriate normalization of the CPO of conformal
dimension  = 2 approach those obtained from the holo-
graphic renormalization at large N.
The result we obtained in this paper is a further con-
ﬁrmation of the claim in [9,10] about duality between the
mABJM theory and the 11-dimensional supergravity on the
LLM geometry. However, in the present case the procedure
is highly non-trivial. In order to read the vevs of the CPO
of conformal dimension  = 2 from the asymptotic expan-
sion of the LLM solutions, we need to carry out the KK
reduction of the 11-dimensional supergravity and then con-
struct a 4-dimensional gravity on the asymptotic AdS4 back-
ground. Unlike the case of the CPO of conformal dimen-
sion  = 1, we need to establish the KK maps in the
quadratic order between the 4-dimensional ﬁelds and the 11-
dimensional ﬁelds. The KK maps include the non-trivial ﬁeld
redeﬁnitions, which are required to absorb higher derivative
terms and result in the canonical equations of motion for
the 4-dimensional ﬁelds. Identifying the 4-dimensional ﬁelds
obtained from the KK maps with the ﬂuctuations obtained
from the asymptotic expansion of the LLM solutions, we
read the asymptotically AdS4 solutions in the 4-dimensional
equations of motion. We read the vevs of the CPO of con-
formal dimension  = 2 from those asymptotic solutions in
4-dimensions. We also conﬁrm that the vevs of other gauge
invariant operators which are not CPO as well as those of the
massive KK graviton modes are vanishing.
In the previous work [9,10], we showed that the vevs of
O(=1) for any LLM solutions in the holographic renormal-
ization method are exactly the same as those of the mABJM
theory in the large N limit, i.e., ⟨O(=1)⟩HR = ⟨O(=1)⟩m.
This result heavily depends on the fact that the curvature
in the asymptotic limit (μ0z ≪1) becomes weak for any
LLM solutions [32]. Since the vev ⟨O(=1)⟩HR is completely
determined by the asymptotic expansion of the LLM solu-
tions in μ0-order [9,10], one can expect that the relation
⟨O(=1)⟩HR = ⟨O(=1)⟩m in the large N limit is satisﬁed
for all LLM solutions. However, by increasing the μ0z-value
in the LLM geometry, we notice that some LLM geometries,
which include short edges in the Young diagram representa-
tion, become strongly curved even in the large N limit [32].
Therefore, in order to obtain the correct holographic rela-

tion ( ̸= 1) for LLM geometries including strongly curved
regions, one needs quantum corrections from the gravity side
in the large N limit,
⟨O()⟩m = ⟨O()⟩HR + quantum corrections.
(6.1)
In other words, the LLM geometries with square-shaped
Young diagrams do not include any short edges in the large
N limit and thus these geometries are weakly curved over
all transverse regions. For these LLM geometries, we expect
that the holographic relation (6.1) is satisﬁed without quan-
tumcorrectionsinthegravityside.Inthispaper,weexamined
validity of the vevs of O(=2) in the holographic renormal-
ization for the square-shaped Young-diagrams in the LLM
geometries, and showed that ⟨O(=2)⟩HR is approaching the
value of ⟨O(=2)⟩m in the ﬁeld theory side by increasing N.
This result matches our expectation. It is also intriguing to
examine the relation (6.1) for other Young diagrams in the
LLM geometries.

A C I1=4 and C(=2)
In this Appendix, we determine the coefﬁcients C I1=4
i1···i4 which
deﬁne the fourth scalar spherical harmonics on S7 and the
coefﬁcients C A1 A2
B1B2 which deﬁnes the CPO of conformal
dimension  = 2. To that end, we start from the deﬁnition
of the fourth scalar spherical harmonics on S7,
Y 4 = 1

(A.2)
The coefﬁcients Ci jkl are traceless under the contraction of
any two indices and also are totally symmetric. Here we
are interested in the scalar spherical harmonics on S7 with
SO(4) × SO(4) symmetry,
Y 4 = #
N4

1 −5τ 2
,
(A.3)
where #
N4 is a normalization factor. Subsequently inserting
(A.2) into (A.1), using the tracelessness and the symmetric
conditions, and comparing with (A.3), we obtain
3C1133 = 3C1144 = C3333 = C1111 = 4 #
N4,
3C5577 = 3C5588 = C7777 = C5555 = 4 #
N4,
C1166 = C1177 = C1188 = C3355 = C3366
= C3377 = C3388 = C1155 = −2 #
N4,
the others = 0.
(A.4)
In order to determine the coefﬁcients C A1 A2
B1B2 of the CPO
of conformal dimension  = 2, we need to rewrite the
scalar spherical harmonics in terms of C4 coordinates y A =
x2A−1 + ix2A as
Y 4 = 1

The coefﬁcients #
CABC D satisfy the same conditions as Ci jkl
and the values of the former are determined from the values
of the later as follows
#
C1111 = 3
8C1111 + 3

8C2222 = C1111 = 4 #
