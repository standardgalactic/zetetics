Abstract 
10 
The replay of patterns of activity related to past experiences and memories is a striking 
11 
manifestation of brain spontaneous activity. So is the coherent activation of sets of brain areas 
12 
during rest, in particular, the default mode network (DMN). We propose that these two phenomena 
13 
are strongly intertwined: their potential functions overlap, encompassing the reinstatement, 
14 
reprocessing, and consolidation of memories, and the simulation of potential outcomes of actions. In 
15 
our cascaded memory systems model, we hypothesize that the DMN forms the backbone for the 
16 
propagation of replay, mediating interactions between the hippocampus and the whole neocortex 
17 
for consolidation of new memories. The DMN may independently ignite replay cascades, which 
18 
support reactivation of older memories, or high-level semantic representations. Transient cortical 
19 
activations, inducing long-range correlation across the neocortex, are a key mechanism supporting a 
20 
hierarchy of representations, from simple percepts, to semantic representations of causes, to whole 
21 
episodes.

Introduction 
24 
The brain is dominated by spontaneous activity. Activity related to perception and behavior changes 
25 
brain energy consumption (which accounts for a very large proportion – 20% – of the total energy 
26 
budget of the human body) only to a very limited degree compared to the resting state1. These facts 
27 
led some theorists to view brain activity as mostly internally generated, with sensory stimuli acting 
28 
to perturb a “ground state” of spontaneous activity that (to a large extent) determines the outcome 
29 
of stimulus processing 2. However, the detailed structure and function of this spontaneous activity 
30 
remains somewhat mysterious. 
31 
In recent years, two major experimental findings have highlighted the significance of intrinsic brain 
32 
dynamics. At the level of neural ensembles and codes, memory replay — the spontaneous 
33 
reactivation of activity configurations that occurred during previous, active experience — has been 
34 
discovered 3–8. At the global brain dynamics level, resting-state networks have been identified as sets 
35 
of brain areas whose activities are markedly correlated during periods in which the subject performs 
36 
no active task. One such network, the default mode network (DMN) 9, defined as a set of areas that 
37 
are jointly deactivated during active cognitive tasks, attracted much interest due its association to 
38 
mentation and memory processes.   
39 
These two findings originated from very different fields and communities in neuroscience; those of 
40 
hippocampal neurophysiology (mostly working on rodents) on one side, and of human cognitive 
41 
neuroimaging on the other. In this paper, we propose that there is an important link between replay 
42 
and (amidst all networks identified from functional connectivity) the DMN, supported by anatomical, 
43 
functional and theoretical arguments. The spatiotemporal scales and the applied analysis techniques 
44 
are radically different between the two phenomena, as are the questions typically asked in the two 
45 
fields. From the functional point of view, the DMN has mainly been linked to recollection of past 
46 

 
 
experiences or self-referential mental activity10, whereas memory replay has been seen as 
47 
supporting systems memory consolidation11,12, i.e., the rearrangement of memories onto new 
48 
anatomical and connectivity substrates for long-term storage, and the formation of general 
49 
knowledge abstracted from related experiences (semantic memory13). However, recent 
50 
methodological approaches and results suggest a link between the two phenomena, including 
51 
similarities in their function, in the anatomical networks involved, and in their dynamics. Taking this 
52 
evidence into account, we here suggest that replay and DMN activity may actually be part of the 
53 
same memory processing system, viewed through different lenses.  
54 
The proposed link between replay and DMN has important theoretical consequences, in that it calls 
55 
for an update to the standard "indexing" model for systems memory consolidation 14,15. In 
56 
Complementary Learning Systems Theory14, the brain holds two specialized learning and memory 
57 
systems, one in the hippocampus (which acquires new information rapidly) and the other in the 
58 
neocortex (with a vastly larger storage capacity), which gradually merges the new information into 
59 
the schematic knowledge base by some (yet to be clarified) gradient descent optimization algorithm. 
60 
The assumption is that the hippocampus generates a unique output code for each unique 
61 
experience, which serves as a direct, associative, link to lower-level cortical assemblies distributed 
62 
widely in the brain, which encode the experience’s attributes. 
63 
The role of replay is then to enable exchange between the two memory systems, slowly “blending 
64 
in” new information into the neocortical storage, therefore preventing catastrophic interference16 
65 
during learning of new material, that is, the complete loss of previously stored information due to 
66 
synaptic connections being overwhelmed by new memories. To achieve this, replay of new 
67 
information (originating in the hippocampus) and of old information (originating in neocortex) must 
68 
be interleaved14,17. 
69 
In this updated version, which we refer to as the cascaded memory systems model (CMS), we 
70 
attribute the role of index code creation and ignition of replay to a larger network, encompassing 
71 
the DMN in addition to the hippocampus. Hippocampal replay of index codes would ignite brain-
72 
wide, attribute-rich representations of experience more indirectly, cascading through a set of stages 
73 
of which the DMN constitutes the first and most important one. This set of stages would form a 
74 
hierarchical indexing system in which each level has spontaneous, autoassociative dynamics and 
75 
which may then both index representations stored on lower nodes (top-down) and also lead to more 
76 
global retrieval by triggering reactivation of higher-level indices (bottom-up), resulting in spreading 
77 
activation. We see the DMN, including the hippocampus, as the hub of this cascaded replay and as a 
78 
more general, flexible and bidirectional way to link indices and attributes. Another novel ingredient 
79 
in CMS is the emphasis on a feature of cortical dynamics known as 'criticality' as the carrier of 
80 
information across the multiple levels of the model’s hierarchy, both ascending and descending. By 
81 
criticality (as more extensively explained in Box 2) we indicate a condition in a dynamical system in 
82 
which long range correlations are maximal, and the system exhibits maximally complex behavior, or 
83 
example in terms of number of possible states. The emerging picture from CMS explains a number of 
84 
new experimental observations and makes new testable predictions about brain activity and 
85 
memory.  
86 
 
87 
Memory replay, and the spontaneous regeneration of memory representations 
88 
Memory replay was first discovered, and has been described in most detail, in the rodent 
89 
hippocampus during sleep 6,18. The hippocampus holds spatially selective neurons termed 'place' 
90 
cells where different cells display different preferred firing locations as the animal moves in an 
91 
environment 19. The  activities of place cells, however, are also modulated by other immediate 
92 
sensory inputs 20–22 and 'spontaneous' internal states such as reward expectation 23,24 working 
93 
memory and action plans25, resulting in output patterns that are unique to the current global 
94 
experience. The reactivation of simultaneous 6 and temporally ordered 8 activity in pairs of 
95 

 
 
hippocampal place cells during sleep was first described in recordings of large ensembles of 
96 
hippocampal neurons. This was followed by the description of replay of more extended sequences, 
97 
involving larger state trajectories and a larger number of hippocampal cells 7 (Fig. 1a) and requiring 
98 
the use of place decoding 26 to characterize replay 27.  
99 
Place decoding is a statistical procedure through which researchers aim to extract the current 
100 
position of the animal from the activity of recorded neuronal ensembles. Typically, with Bayesian 
101 
approaches26, the position of the animal can be decoded with approximately 10 cm accuracy by 
102 
processing the activity of around 100 hippocampal neurons and using the mean, binned population 
103 
rate vectors 28. By applying a mean-rate decoder that was obtained from the neuronal activity 
104 
recorded as the animal ran along a maze to subsequent sleep recordings, it was shown that 
105 
spontaneous activity in sleep replays maze trajectories on a fast timescale 7. That is, hippocampal 
106 
activity during sleep recapitulates sequences of place cell activations in the same order as they 
107 
occurred during maze traversals 29. Consistent with the idea that the hippocampus encodes an index 
108 
for past experience, other variables, such as head direction, have also been decoded from 
109 
hippocampal sleep data 30.  
110 
In the hippocampus, this memory replay occurs preferentially during sharp waves 31, large 
111 
population bursts in which a substantial number of hippocampal neurons fire together and that are 
112 
accompanied by high frequency (200 Hz) oscillations 32,33 in the local field potential (LFP), termed 
113 
ripples (together termed sharp wave-ripples, SWRs). SWRs are generated by excitatory feedback in 
114 
the hippocampal subfield CA3, which is rich in recurrent connections 34,35. The increased probability 
115 
of observing replay during SWRs (Fig. 1a) suggests that recurrent excitation may trigger retrieval of a 
116 
memory trace encoded in the synaptic matrix, as suggested by attractor neural network models 36–38. 
117 
Recent data show that similar, feedback-driven phenomena are widespread in the cortex 39–41.

Figure 1 Memory reactivation as a brain-wide phenomenon 
121 
Although initially thought to be a strictly hippocampal phenomenon, replay signals from the 
122 
hippocampus also engage neocortical areas, such as areas belonging to the DMN. Moreover, DMN 
123 
areas can generate ripple oscillations independently and are linked to neocortical replay, 
124 
demonstrating that reactivation processes are found throughout the brain with a privileged role of 
125 
the DMN. 
126 
a) Sequence replay in the rodent hippocampus and its occurrence during sharp-wave ripple (SWR) 
127 
oscillations. Left: During awake behavior, spatially selective cells in the hippocampus fire in an 
128 
ordered sequence as the animal moves along the track. Each tick represents one action potential, 
129 
with its color indicating the cell it was emitted from across multiple laps. Right: During 
130 
subsequent sleep, the same sequence of cells can become reactivated in a time-compressed 
131 
manner. This replay often occurs together with hippocampal SWRs (white traces and arrows), 
132 
but it remains an open question whether all SWRs during NREM sleep reflect replay. Figure 
133 
adapted from ref. 7  
134 

 
 
b) Hippocampal SWRs (which are correlated with replay activity) are accompanied by a concurrent 
135 
increase in activity in the neocortex, in particular areas of the DMN. i) Left: The extent of the 
136 
macaque DMN as characterized by resting state functional connectivity in ref. 42 (red). Right: 
137 
Anesthetized rhesus monkey fMRI recordings, demonstrated that hippocampal SWRs (80-180 Hz; 
138 
zero on x-axis denotes onset of SWR) coincided with heightened activity in areas of the DMN. The 
139 
other traces correspond to activation of the DMN and VSN (another neocortical resting-state 
140 
network) during hippocampal sigma (8-22 Hz) and gamma (25-75 Hz) oscillation activity. VSN, 
141

142 
(measured using a voltage-sensitive dye) in the neocortex at the time of hippocampal SWRs in 
143 
mice. Warmer colors denote a larger increase in activity relative to baseline when no SWRs were 
144 
present. The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) showed the highest degree of peri-SWR activation. V1, 
145

146 
c) The neocortex also generates ripple activity. 500 ms trace showing SWRs in posterior parietal 
147 
cortex (PPC) in rats during sleep preferentially co-occurred with hippocampal SWRs (purple 
148 
shading), but could also occur independently (orange shading). The blue trace shows control 
149 
activity from a white matter tract where no ripples are expected to be generated. Figure adapted 
150 
from ref.40. 
151 
d) Sequence replay in the neocortex coincides with activation of the DMN. Left: Participants had to 
152 
learn a sequence of visual items, with the order in which they were represented shown left to 
153 
right along the horizontal axis of the image. By performing decoding on activity recorded from 
154 
the neocortex with a number of MEG sensors, replay of the item sequences could be detected 
155 
during subsequent rest. Right: These replay bursts coincided with activity in resting state 
156 
networks (RSN), of which the DMN (orange) showed the strongest concurrent increase. The other 
157 
traces denote other RSN. Inset shows results from a second data set. Figure adapted from ref.45.

160 
Hippocampal sleep replay was first linked to memory processes in the framework of Marr’s 46,47 and 
161 
McClelland et al.’s 14 models of how the brain learns and stores information. Subsequently, multiple 
162 
lines of evidence from neurophysiological, neuropsychological and behavioral studies have 
163 
illustrated the dynamic nature of memory, whose substrate and organization changes with time 48–50. 
164 
These findings lead to the formulation of systems consolidation theory which identifies two memory 
165 
systems, one based in the hippocampus, which facilitates initial memory acquisition, and one in the 
166 
cortex where long-term memory storage takes place 14,51,52. Replay was identified as a potential 
167 
mechanism for information exchange between the two systems and indeed suppression of SWRs or 
168 
replay activity leads to memory deficits (Box 1). In its original and simplest formulation 51,52 systems 
169 
consolidation theory posited a verbatim transfer of memory from hippocampus to neocortex during 
170 
memory consolidation, explaining some findings (for example, anterograde amnesia following 
171 
hippocampal damage 53–55). However, the aforementioned indexing theory, which was formulated 
172 
later, does not assume that memory attributes per se are stored in the hippocampus in a self-
173 
contained fashion at any time 56. Rather, it is suggested that the memory consists of the linkage 
174 
between the hippocampus output patterns and widely distributed cortical attribute representations. 
175 
According to this idea, consolidation entails the maturation of cortical-cortical connectivity, thereby 
176 
reducing the importance of the hippocampal index 48,50. Memory replay would be the driver of these 
177 
plasticity processes, acting as a “teaching signal” of sorts for cortical plasticity.   
178 
A further significant advancement in the replay field took place when SWRs and replay were found 
179 
to also occur outside sleep, during periods of wakefulness, and in brain areas other than the 
180 
hippocampus. Awake SWRs and accompanying replay occur sporadically during periods of task 
181 
engagement, typically when the animal briefly pauses task-related behavior at goal areas or choice 
182 
points 57–59. Reinstatement of stored information is not only important for memorization but also for 
183 
reflecting on past and planning of future events. Thus, the discovery that replay can occur outside 
184 

 
 
the resting state and the fact that awake replay can progress in both the ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’ 
185 
order 57 led to more functions being ascribed to replay. Besides playing a role in memory 
186 
consolidation, it has been suggested that hippocampal replay and possible recruitment of cortical 
187 
areas (Fig. 1b) during task periods may serve to recall memories, providing the building blocks for 
188 
mental simulation, planning and evaluation60 (Box 1). The synchronous firing of many hippocampal 
189 
neurons during SWRs provides a potent, synergistic signal that may help convey information to, or 
190 
retrieve it from, other brain areas. Indeed, areas such as the prefrontal 61,62, retrosplenial 63, parietal 
191 
64, visual 65 and auditory 66 cortex also exhibit replay activity and this neocortical replay is often 
192 
coordinated with hippocampal SWRs. As mentioned above, SWRs have also been recently reported 
193 
in the neocortex (Fig. 1c) 40,41. Recent data suggest that these cortical SWRs are linked to replay as 
194 
well 41. Taken together, these data indicate that memory processes are not purely hippocampal, but 
195 
involve the brain as a whole. 
196 
 
197 
Box 1 – The different functional roles of awake and sleep replay 
198 
 
199 
Hippocampal replay can occur during two very different behavioral states, which likely also define its 
200 
function. Hippocampal replay during sleep has been tied to consolidation of memories67,68 that are 
201 
then recalled at a later time point. Strong evidence for this comes from a study that suppressed 
202 
hippocampal replay of only one of two spatial memories in rats, resulting in selective memory deficits 
203 
of the perturbed memory and leaving the other intact 69. Different functions have been attributed to 
204 
hippocampal replay during awake periods. For example, in rodents, awake hippocampal replay 
205 
during pauses in navigation has been shown to predict the next path taken and has thus been linked 
206 
to prospective planning 60. Interestingly, awake memory replay does not only progress forward, in the 
207 
same order as originally experienced, but can also play in the reverse order. Thus, awake 
208 
hippocampal replay may also serve retrospection or online memory consolidation when trajectories 
209 
are replayed in reverse, starting from the current position of the animal and ending at previous 
210 
goals57. Reverse replays increase in frequency with increases of reward, possibly leading to an 
211 
enhancement of memory for important events 70. DMN areas such as anterior cingulate show similar 
212 
activity as well71 
213 
 
214 
Neocortical replay can most likely also be functionally divided into events that occur during sleep or 
215 
awake periods. A role for cortical replay during sleep in memory consolidation has not been clearly 
216 
demonstrated yet; however, there are also several lines of evidence highlighting a behavioral role for 
217 
neocortical awake replay 72–75. For example, on a plus-maze flexibility task the prefrontal cortex 
218 
replayed sequences of maze positions recapitulating entire maze trajectories 72. This reactivation 
219 
occurred during awake immobility periods such as at the choice point or goal area, and the frequency 
220 
of sequence replay positively correlated with rule-switching performance on the task. Furthermore, 
221 
reverse replay occurred more often at the maze center before making correct choices, and at the goal 
222 
after an error was made, suggesting that these prefrontal cortex events may have a role in planning 
223 
upcoming and evaluating past choices. 
224 
 
225 
The large body of findings coming from rodent studies that linked SWRs and replay with memory 
226 
processes lead to discoveries of similar phenomena in the human brain. In humans, SWRs were also 
227 
first demonstrated in the hippocampus and adjacent areas of the medial temporal lobe and are 
228 
positively associated with memory performance 76,77. Since invasive single neuron recordings in 
229 
humans are often not feasible, multivariate analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging 
230 
(fMRI) voxels is often used to test for reactivation of learning-related activity patterns. Indeed, 
231 
hippocampal replay, including replay of activity sequences, has been detected in humans in both 
232 
sleep and wakefulness 78–81. Replay studies in humans, however, not only confirm many findings 
233 
made in rodents, but also provide strong support for the idea that cortical replay signals can occur 
234 

 
 
independently of the hippocampus. Besides serving memory processes within the cortex and 
235 
permitting interleaving of new and consolidated memories 39, autonomously triggered replay in the 
236 
neocortex may be particularly important for remote memory retrieval. Evidence hinting at 
237 
independent cortical replay comes from humans, where ripples can be found across the neocortex 
238 
both during sleep and wakefulness, and can occur simultaneously in many cortical locations39,45 . 
239 
Furthermore, successful delayed memory recall was associated with increased hippocampal-cortical 
240 
and cortico-cortical co-occurrence of SWRs  39,41,82.  
241 
 
242 
The Default Mode Network and the spontaneous generation of simulated, projected 
243 
representations 
244 
Distributed brain areas are thought to form a functional network when they show temporally 
245 
correlated activity patterns. Whilst simultaneous responses to a stimulus can lead to correlated 
246 
activity between brain areas, spontaneously generated correlations have been observed during the 
247 
resting state in the absence of a task or stimulus. Neuroimaging studies have identified several 
248 
systems that show coherent spontaneous activity, including the somatomotor, visual, auditory and 
249 
the attentional systems 83. 
250 
The spatially distributed brain areas of the DMN also display coherent activity during the resting 
251 
state. The DMN, however, is unique compared to the other resting-state networks in that it reduces 
252 
its activation when the subject is engaged in an active task and is thus anticorrelated with the 
253 
attentional network84,85. DMN areas show significant positive functional connectivity, as measured at 
254 
the slow (seconds) time scale of blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals. As first 
255 
characterized in humans with positron emission tomography (PET), and later with fMRI methods, the 
256 
DMN 9,86 includes cortical subdivisions in the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, posterior 
257 
cingulate (retrosplenial), precuneus and lateral parietal cortex. The medial temporal lobe and the 
258 
hippocampus have also been included 87 or linked 83,88,89 with the DMN. For example, spontaneous 
259 
activity in the main areas of the DMN correlates with that of the hippocampus 90. The functional 
260 
correlation structure  between those key DMN areas is partially preserved during sleep 91 and under 
261 
light anesthesia. The stability of this correlation pattern across wakefulness, sleep and anesthesia 
262 
suggests that it is at least to some extent state-independent and consistent with known anatomical 
263 
connectivity. fMRI experiments under anesthesia provided evidence for the existence of a similar 
264 
DMN in other mammals including mice, rats, cats and monkeys89,92–94.  
265 
A clear consensus on the function of the DMN is still lacking. Since the DMN was first discovered as a 
266 
set of areas that increase their activity when individuals are left to their own without a specific task 
267 
at hand, it was initially suggested to reflect unconstrained thoughts, in the absence of monitoring of 
268 
the external environment 95. Such untethered activity can include mental simulation of scenarios, 
269 
reflection about the past and imagining the future. Whilst externally oriented tasks typically lead to 
270 
BOLD deactivations, it is now accepted that the DMN is not only active during idle states but that 
271 
tasks that rely on internally constructed information actually increase DMN activations and that 
272 
activity in the DMN during active tasks reflects the level of detail in subjective experience97.  For 
273 
example, studies that asked participants to recall personal past experiences, highlighted that brain 
274 
areas activated by this type of episodic memory recall show a substantial overlap with areas of the 
275 
DMN98,99, which was more precisely delineated by meta-analysis100. Interestingly, other studies have 
276 
shown that the brain regions that are involved in remembering the past are similar to those involved 
277 
in envisaging the future101 (typically probed using tasks that involve the presentation of a word cue 
278 
(e.g.“Birthday”) and a request to envision a personal event related to this cue 102,103). This might be 
279 
because, in both cases, a simulation is enacted independently of current inputs to the brain. This 
280 
mental simulation enables the evaluation of these situations, which is required for making future 
281 
choices. It is also to be noticed that the notion that the DMN is a ‘task-negative’ network relies on 
282 
BOLD correlation, sensitive mostly to the slow (seconds) temporal features of the activity. Replay 
283 

 
 
mostly take place in bursts 62 that last for a few hundreds of ms at most and may be not detected by 
284 
human neuroimaging techniques. Indeed, DMN activation during replay was detected with MEG, 
285 
which can register fast transients45  
286 
An animal correlate of these functions can be seen in the generation of activity sequences in the 
287 
hippocampus that depict possible future trajectories60. Whether such activity reflects planning per 
288 
se, or merely a mnemonic function is still debated 104. In fact, both functions may be subserved at 
289 
different times during awake replay105 
290 
Mental simulations are often rich in details and can therefore be hypothesized to depend on the link 
291 
between index and attribute codes. As introduced earlier, the hippocampus is the site where the 
292 
highest order index codes are presumed to be generated and stored. We therefore propose that, 
293 
within the DMN, the hippocampus may provide index codes pointing to episodic memory content, 
294 
which is assembled out of the high-order attribute representations contained in other DMN 
295 
structures (index-attribute connectivity), whereas horizontal interactions within the DMN may 
296 
reflect the organization of semantic knowledge (attribute-attribute connectivity). Such a layout 
297 
could enable realistic mental simulations. In fact, a study that analyzed brain activity during different 
298 
types of internal thoughts found that autobiographical remembering (“Remember a time you went 
299 
out with your family”) and imagining a future scenario (“Imagine a time when you will go out with 
300 
your family”), both processes relying on memories for events, engaged the hippocampal formation 
301 
more than other types of internal mentation 106. 
302 
Finally, the DMN has not only been linked to the recall of memories, but also to their storage for the 
303 
long term. Baseline functional connectivity within the DMN including the hippocampus was 
304 
positively correlated with long-term episodic memory retention several weeks after learning107. This 
305 
relationship was not present for short-term memory recall. Whether this relationship results from 
306 
increased memory reactivation in individuals with higher DMN functional connectivity remains to be 
307 
investigated. Furthermore, in the same study, human subjects that showed better long-term 
308 
episodic memory retention also showed stronger baseline decoupling of the DMN from perceptual 
309 
and external attention networks. 
310 
In summary, there is accumulating evidence that the DMN is not only active during passive states, 
311 
but also implicated in memory processes such as recall of specific episodic memories (index-
312 
attribute connections) as well as the imagination of possible, but not yet experienced, scenarios 
313 
(attribute-attribute connectivity). Whilst cerebral blood flow-based imaging methods (such as PET 
314 
and fMRI) enable the entire brain to be imaged simultaneously, the temporal resolution is 
315 
considerably lower than that achieved with electrophysiology. Interestingly, 
316 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies adopting innovative analyses, showed transient activations 
317 
108,109 at a time scale (50-100 ms), much faster than the fluctuations in blood flow signals from which 
318 
the DMN functional connectivity was first mapped, that spanned specific networks of brain areas. 
319 
Two of these networks overlapped very closely with the anterior and posterior part of the DMN as 
320 
derived from BOLD results, indicating that DMN dynamics can express at both fast and slow time 
321 
scales. 
322 
 
323 
The Default Mode Network as the backbone of hippocampal-cortical interaction and 
324 
cortical replay 
325 
Besides facilitating replay, SWR bursts are likely an important conduit for interactions between 
326 
hippocampus and neocortex. During NREM slow wave sleep, neurons in multiple brain areas 
327 
increase their firing activity coincidently with hippocampal SWRs 110,111 . Also during wakefulness,  
328 
hippocampal SWRs induce increases or decreases in cortical activation, albeit in a fairly stable set of 
329 
neurons within a given recording session 112. Furthermore, during NREM sleep, SWRs are correlated 
330 

 
 
with cortical sleep spindles 113,114, 9-20 Hz cortical activity oscillations that have been linked to 
331 
memory consolidation 115–117.  
332 
While associated with widespread overall brain activation during NREM sleep, SWR-related 
333 
activations also retain a degree of specificity. A study combining resting state fMRI with 
334 
electrophysiology in anesthetized monkeys and rats revealed an overall increase in activation in 
335 
most neocortical areas during SWRs compared to baseline periods but a decrease in subcortical 
336 
structures, and interestingly also in primary visual cortex 118. Importantly, re-analysis of the same 
337 
data set showed that during anesthesia the DMN as a whole activates specifically and coherently 
338 
with hippocampal SWRs 42 (Fig. 1bi). Voltage-sensitive imaging data from mice provided a similar 
339 
picture, but with a much better time resolution (hundreds of milliseconds) and suggested that DMN 
340 
(in particular the retrosplenial cortex) activation can both lag as well as lead hippocampal SWRs on 
341 
relatively short timescales 44 (Fig. 1bii). Furthermore, the hippocampus has direct anatomical 
342 
connections to DMN areas119,120 and out of the resting state networks, functionally connects 
343 
preferentially with the DMN (with only the somatomotor network also showing correlations with the 
344 
hippocampus) 88. These findings therefore support the conclusion that the DMN has a privileged 
345 
connection with the hippocampus and places SWRs as one potentially critical mechanism for this 
346 
interaction.  
347 
A recent MEG study has shown that cortical replay bursts coincide with activations of the DMN at 
348 
the time scale of transients lasting tens of milliseconds 45 (Fig. 1d). It is thus tempting to speculate 
349 
that DMN activity may itself represent replay that was previously undetected due to the lower time-
350 
resolution of methods typically used in DMN research. In fact, ensemble neurophysiology studies in 
351 
rodents found evidence for replay in a number of DMN nodes. The medial prefrontal cortex is one of 
352 
the main cortical recipients of hippocampal afferents and replay in this area was first detected 
353 
during sleep 61,62. In the medial prefrontal cortex, similarly to the hippocampus, this replay takes the 
354 
form of time compressed, transient bursts of 30-100 ms, recapitulating recent behavior-related 
355 
activity sequences. Furthermore, prefrontal replay transients preferentially co-occurred with 
356 
hippocampal SWRs 62, supporting the idea that SWRs contribute not just to dynamical 
357 
synchronization, but also to information exchange between the hippocampus and the neocortex 121. 
358 
Replay has also been demonstrated, among other structures, in the retrosplenial 63 and parietal 
359 
cortex 64,122, all forming part of the DMN, and in medial temporal lobe structures other than the 
360 
hippocampus such as the entorhinal cortex 123,124. 
361 
However, whilst the DMN may be strongly coupled to SWRs and associated with replay, other 
362 
cortical areas that are not part of the DMN also exhibit replay. The decoding procedure employed in 
363 
the study that reported coincident DMN activations and cortical replay bursts 45 (Fig. 1d), detected 
364 
replay involving all MEG sensors, including areas other than those encompassed by the DMN. In fact, 
365 
replay in visual 65, auditory66, and motor125 cortex was observed in rodent studies as well. It is 
366 
therefore possible that the DMN is the interface between hippocampal-cortical interactions that 
367 
enables replay to cascade throughout the brain and become a brain-wide (or at least a cortex-wide) 
368 
phenomenon. Indeed, cortical voltage imaging reveals an SWR associated spread of activation from 
369 
the retrosplenial cortex to other 'lower' cortical areas 44. A prediction from this hypothesis is that 
370 
replay in DMN structures is best correlated with hippocampal replay, and that the link between 
371 
activity in the hippocampus and sensorimotor cortices depends on the DMN mediation, which can 
372 
be tested with disconnection or inactivation techniques. 
373 
 
374 
Memory, imagery, mental simulation and the Cascaded Memory Systems model  
375 
Taken together, the foregoing results and concepts make it enticing to see replay and DMN 
376 
activation as expressions of the same mechanisms of spontaneous activity, subserving common 
377 
computations. This assumption would have important consequences for our theoretical 
378 
understanding of memory, and of the role played by spontaneous activity and replay.  
379 

 
 
As introduced earlier, hippocampal replay was first linked to memory processes in the framework of 
380 
systems memory consolidation theory. In a seminal paper McClelland, McNaughton and O’Reilly 14 
381 
proposed the dual memory systems model, an embodiment of standard systems consolidation 
382 
theory in a computational model with a deep (two-layer) neural network. In this picture, the 
383 
hippocampus represents the lower layer, encoding memories as they are acquired and in the form of 
384 
unitary representations of events or percepts. The upper “cortical” layer learns to detect the 
385 
different components of the percepts and categorizes them. In the theory, the main purpose of 
386 
replay was to prevent “catastrophic interference”, the sudden loss of all memory in the neocortical 
387 
system if new information is learned too rapidly, in particular, if outlying new members of categories 
388 
are encountered. Offline, after an experience, the hippocampal system would drive replay of the 
389 
newly stored information. This would enable more gradual, less intrusive training of the neocortical 
390 
system, provided that the cortex itself can autonomously generate replay of older, already 
391 
consolidated items, allowing new and older memories to become associated. Accordingly, the 
392 
hippocampus acts as an index serving linkage of the distinct attribute representations that make up 
393 
an event and that are stored in different neocortical areas, enabling their concurrent reactivation 
394 
15,46,47,126.  
395 
It remains unclear, however, how a hippocampal index code that points to anatomically distributed 
396 
attributes would propagate throughout the brain and induce correlations between distant cortical 
397 
areas. During memory formation, these correlations are initially generated by simultaneous bottom-
398 
up activations induced by common causes. For example, the approach of a predator may cause 
399 
perception of a running, fleeing group of conspecifics in the left visual field, a dark, threatening 
400 
shadow in the far-right visual field, and a fox odor. These three distant representations need to be 
401 
reactivated in a coordinated fashion to become consolidated as one experience or integrated into a 
402 
predictive schema. Correlated activation states are also necessary to encode statistical regularities in 
403 
the world which often crucially include long-range correlations. Besides the distance constraints, 
404 
from the dynamical point of view those correlative states may be difficult to reach and sustain. This 
405 
is because of the relatively limited degree of inter-area connectivity in the neocortex, compared to 
406 
local connections127,128. We here seek to address these issues with the CMS model. 
407 
As outlined above, the DMN is anatomically and functionally strongly connected. Amongst the 
408 
resting-state networks, the DMN has a privileged functional link with the hippocampus Finally, the 
409 
DMN activates concurrently with brain-wide replay transients and many of its nodes show replay. 
410 
This makes it enticing, from the standpoint of systems consolidation theory, to see the DMN as a 
411 
conduit for interactions between the hippocampus, seen as the main generator of replay of new 
412 
episodes, and the remainder of cortex. That is, the DMN may act as a scaffolding for the 
413 
reinstatement and consolidation of cortical memory representations, even autonomously indexing 
414 
and igniting replay of older episodes. This would provide the dual memory systems model with a 
415 
solution for the “sparse connectivity” problem outlined above. We can see the DMN as the second 
416 
tier in a hierarchy of brain areas already recognized by Marr 47 and others 129–131 . 
417 
However, such placement of the DMN in the brain wiring diagram still does not answer the question 
418 
of how representations involving long-range interactions between cortical areas may be learned in 
419 
the first place and later updated. These representations are not only complex, in that they span, for 
420 
example, multiple sensory modalities. They typically also reflect the statistics of rare, but significant, 
421 
occurrences. Their rarity would make it very difficult for learning processes to tune connections and 
422 
associate the different representations.  
423 
A better solution would require an update to the dual memory systems model, which we propose 
424 
here as the CMS model, where replay is instead spontaneously and independently generated at 
425 
multiple, hierarchically organized places in the cortex. The anatomical blueprint for this updated 
426 
model is provided by a seminal set of studies by Margulies and colleagues 129 showing that much of 
427 
the cerebral cortex fMRI functional connectivity data from humans may be explained by a principal 
428 
gradient (Fig. 2a). This principal gradient sees DMN structures involved in autobiographical memory 
429 

 
 
and semantic thought at one end, and primary sensory areas involved in action and sensory 
430 
perception at the other. Therefore, although the DMN was originally described as a single network, 
431 
it might be better understood as a gradient, where DMN regions further up this gradient process 
432 
increasingly integrated and associated forms of information. A very similar principal gradient can be 
433 
extracted from mouse fMRI functional connectivity data 132. Suggestively, in the mouse, a given brain 
434 
area’s position on the principal gradient strongly correlates with its geodesic distance on brain 
435 
surface from the hippocampus. Importantly, the DMN has dynamical features that would favor 
436 
allowing replay to propagate to other parts of the cortex, as its areas are capable of reverberating 
437 
activity on long time scales (Fig. 2c-d), facilitating temporal integration, and large activations 
438 
(resembling a near-critical regime) that enable spatial integration (Box 2) 133–135,135–138. Also relevant 
439 
for our hypothesis, is that the hippocampus strongly connects to the DMN (Fig. 2e) and appears to 
440 
lie next to the DMN in a continuation of the principal gradient88,132 
441 
To update the classic systems consolidation model with a cascaded memory systems (CMS; Fig. 3) 
442 
model, we make the following key assumptions, and discuss some testable predictions for each of 
443 
them.  
444 
 
445 
Replay propagates from the hippocampus along the principal connectivity gradient  
446 
Data supporting propagation of replay signals from the hippocampus to DMN nodes such as medial 
447 
prefrontal, retrosplenial and posterior parietal cortex already exist 62,64,72,122,139. Replay has also been 
448 
observed in primary sensory cortices found at the other end of the principal gradient, such as the 
449 
visual 65 and auditory 66 cortex. In these cases, a link to hippocampal replay activity has been shown, 
450 
even though the intermediate steps, in the likely multi-synaptic pathway from hippocampus to these 
451 
cortices are not known. Imaging studies that show that cortical activity correlates with hippocampal 
452 
SWRs are strongly suggestive of the propagation of replay activity along the principal gradient42,118. 
453 
In addition, MEG studies suggest that DMN activation precedes and possibly causes activation in 
454 
other cortical networks 109. CMS predicts that while replay is a widespread phenomenon in the 
455 
cerebral cortex (and beyond), DMN replay will be maximally correlated to hippocampal activity. 
456 
Areas just downstream of the DMN will be maximally correlated with the DMN, and so on. In other 
457 
words, correlations between replay in different brain structure is a decreasing function of their 
458 
distance on the principal gradient.

Figure 2 Cortical gradients: connectivity and characteristic time scales.  
461 
Cortical area organization induced by connectivity shows a prominent hierarchical structure and is 
462 
mirrored in the distribution of neural temporal scales.  
463 
 
464 
a) Illustration of the gradient based organization of cortical functional connectivity first formulated 
465 
in an early study by Mesulam130 (left), and reflected in a meta-analysis of fMRI functional 
466 
connectivity129 (right). Left: Based on the analysis of monkey cortical synaptic organization 
467 
Mesulam130 proposed that cortical areas (represented as dots) distribute along two principal 
468 
axes, respectively spanning along and through different synaptic levels (concentric rings). The 
469 
structure resulting from such two-dimensional alignment has distinct unimodal regions 
470 
(represented on the schematic in green and blue) at one end and transmodal regions largely 
471 
overlapping with the Default Mode Network (represented on the schematic in red) at the other, 
472 
resulting in a hierarchy of processing stages. Here, we augment this scheme by adding the 
473 
hippocampus as the top tier in this hierarchy above the DMN  V1 – primary visual cortex, A1 – 
474 
primary auditory cortex, Pf – prefrontal cortex, P – parietal cortex, L – limbic cortex, HC – 
475 
Hippocampus. Right: Resting functional connectivity (from fMRI) meta-analysis reveal equivalent 
476 
organizational principles. When plotted against the first two functional connectivity embeddings, 
477 
cortical voxels are shown to cluster along the same gradients proposed by Mesulam130 
478 
(histograms of the distribution of values are presented on the respective axis). Each dot 
479 
represents a brain voxel, colored according to brain region. Connectivity Gradient 1 is found to 
480 
extend between primary sensorimotor and transmodal regions (red), while connectivity Gradient 
481 
2 separates somatomotor and auditory cortex (green) from visual cortex (blue). Figure adapted 
482 
from ref.129 
483 
b) In monkeys the number of dendritic spines on pyramidal cells in a cortical area increases with the 
484 
position of the area in a cortical hierarchy (as obtained from connectivity tracing analysis in 
485 
monkeys and closely related to the principal gradient from Fig. 2a). Inset: Two-dimensional 
486 
organization of areas from the same connectivity tracing analysis, resulting from taking into 
487 
account both the strength of their long-range anatomical connectivity (angular distance) and 
488 
their hierarchical position (distance from the edge). Figure adapted from ref.133 
489 

 
 
c) Time scale of neural dynamics increases when ascending a cortical hierarchy from sensory to 
490 
associative and DMN areas. i) Single neuron intrinsic timescales, governing activity fluctuations 
491 
not locked to stimulus onset, and measured with spike-count autocorrelation, increase gradually 
492 
along a visual-prefrontal hierarchy in monkeys (each line is a separate experiment/dataset). MT 
493 
– middle temporal area, LIP – lateral interparietal cortex, LPFC – lateral prefrontal cortex, OFC – 
494 
orbitofrontal cortex, ACC – anterior cingulate cortex. Figure adapted from ref.138 ii) Neural 
495 
temporal scales as measured in human with ECoG (Electrocorticography) using an audiovisual 
496 
task. Temporal receptive windows (TRWs), measured for each channel as an increased response 
497 
reliability to the extended temporal structure of a stimulus, were found to be shorter near 
498 
primary sensory areas, while they became progressively longer further away from sensory areas 
499 
(reference locations labelled in white). Figure adapted from ref.137  
500 
d) A network model reproducing cortical connectivity characteristics generates a spectrum of 
501 
increasing neural timescales. Left: Responses of cortical areas in the model to a pulse of input to 
502 
area V1. Areas in the model are arranged according to a connectivity scheme obtained from 
503 
tracing studies in monkeys: as the input is propagated along the modeled anatomical hierarchy, 
504 
cortical areas display increasing decay times. Right: Average temporal autocorrelation of 
505 
modelled area activity in response to an input pulse in V1. The temporal autocorrelation 
506 
demonstrates a functional hierarchy ranging from area V1 at the bottom to prefrontal areas at 
507 
the top. In all images, areas are arranged (and colored) by position in an anatomical hierarchy. 
508 
Figure adapted from ref.133  
509 
e) The hippocampus forms strong functional connections with regions of the DMN. Colors mark 
510 
areas that show reliable co-activity with the hippocampus during the resting state and include 
511 
cingulate, precuneus and medial frontal areas (only left hemisphere shown). These data lend 
512 
further support to the scheme in a). Figure adapted from ref.88 
513 
 
514 
 
515 
Index codes exist at different levels  
516 
In the CMS model, not only hippocampal activity, but also activity in DMN nodes (and nodes down 
517 
the gradient) provide index codes, which refer to and can activate activity configurations 
518 
downstream. Indeed, in fMRI experiments, the multi-voxel pattern of activity in DMN areas provides 
519 
information about the global brain activity state 140,141. The model suggests that index codes in 
520 
different areas will encode conjunctions of attributes encoded in other areas by means of indirect 
521 
association. These index codes may also link to lower order index codes in other brain areas in a 
522 
chain of referral links. Whereas the hippocampal index codes refer to unique episodic memories, 
523 
DMN index codes reflect knowledge of the potential “causes” and implications of a given percept. 
524 
That is, they represent the statistics of the world in terms of disentangled, or factorized, 
525 
representations 142, which in turn index the corresponding attributes they are composed of and that 
526 
are stored in lower cortices. The prediction here is that it should be possible to predict, from activity 
527 
patterns in one area, the state and activity of areas downstream from it on the principal gradient, 
528 
including long-range correlations between downstream areas. This could be tested in fMRI with 
529 
multi-voxel decoding techniques, and with high resolution invasive techniques in animals.  
530 
Replay can be independently ignited in a multitude of cortical areas  
531 
Replay is thought to be initiated and shaped by positive feedback induced by recurrent connectivity 
532 
(for example in the hippocampal CA3 area) amplifying inputs and spontaneous activity fluctuations 
533 
143. Replay initiation is however not restricted to the hippocampus, as many cortical areas (possibly 
534 
all 133) have sufficient intrinsic connectivity to support self-sustained activity. Top-down influences, 
535 
for example from the hippocampus, are responsible for some, but not all, replay events in 
536 
downstream areas. Most replay events were observed in the prefrontal cortex in the absence of a 
537 
corresponding hippocampal replay event 72 and only a small fraction of replay events in the visual 
538 
cortex coincided with events in the hippocampus 65. Replay in the absence of hippocampal top-down 
539 

 
 
influence may reflect generative reprocessing of correlations at lower hierarchical levels of the 
540 
cascade and/or older, more consolidated memories, whose traces are stronger and can be 
541 
reactivated independently of the hippocampus. We are here suggesting that (representational 
542 
complexity made equal) newer memories will require activations at higher levels in the principal 
543 
gradient than lower-level ones (Fig. 3).  
544 
Based on this, the spontaneous initiation of replay in multiple foci may be tested experimentally, 
545 
including manipulations inactivating the hippocampus or DMN structures. According to the CMS 
546 
model, the complexity of the replayed information in a given event would be limited by the position 
547 
of the highest involved area on the principal gradient. Also, smaller replay events with a substrate 
548 
low on the principal gradient should reflect older information, with a lesser integrative character.  
549 
 
550 
 
551 
Box 2 - A theory for cortical dynamics: the role of criticality 
552 
 
553 
The concept of criticality has been borrowed from physics where it has been developed to identify the 
554 
collective behavior of systems comprising a large number of entities144. It can be understood as 
555 
describing a regime balanced between complete disorder and perfect coherence among all the 
556 
components145. The hallmark of systems working at a critical point is the presence of long-range 
557 
correlations between system components146. Importantly, in a critical regime, long-range correlations 
558 
are achieved even with minimal or no long-range connectivity. Phenomenologically, these systems 
559 
are characterized by spatio-temporal cascades of activity, called avalanches, whose probability 
560 
decrease slowly with their size or duration (their scaling is well described by a power-law distribution, 
561 
see central panel in the illustration)147, so that large events account for a preponderant part of the 
562 
total energy in all events . Thus, the temporal dynamics of the system end up being dominated by 
563 
large events: that is, most of the cumulative total activity is concentrated in relatively rare, large 
564 
events148.  
565 
This description of system dynamics has gained traction in neuroscience thanks to a combination of 
566 
computational results, showing how neural networks can approach a critical state through various 
567 

 
 
forms of plasticity 149–151, and an accumulation of experimental evidence pointing to the presence of 
568 
signatures of criticality (that is, power-law scaling of probability) in the statistical properties of 
569 
activity obtained from various types of cortical preparations 152–155. The analogy with critical systems 
570 
may help to explain a host of findings such as propagation of traveling waves originating in the 
571 
DMN156. 
572 
Moreover, reaching criticality is considered a desirable target for networks as it has been shown to 
573 
maximize a number of properties considered favorable for neural computations such as 
574 
responsiveness to external stimulation, information transmission and information storage 157–160. 
575 
More recently, the degree of tuning to criticality of cortical neural populations was reassessed. These 
576 
studies have shown that neural populations are best described as being in a ‘reverberating’ state, 
577 
slightly below criticality. Thus, they potentially achieve a balance between the aforementioned 
578 
positive effects of criticality while mitigating the less desirable ones, such as reduced specificity and 
579 
reliability 161–166. 
580 
Growing experimental evidence points to the existence of a relationship between such near-critical 
581 
dynamics and the underlying static connectome structure 167,168. In particular, the set of cortical hubs 
582 
comprising the DMN may play a prominent role in maintaining critical-like network dynamics and in 
583 
promoting the efficient spread of avalanche events through macroscopic brain networks 134,169. 
584 
Though not well understood, this relationship between the connectome and near-criticality is thought 
585 
to be mirrored by a hierarchy of time-scale fluctuations in neural activity 137,138,170–173, in which hub 
586 
regions (such as the DMN) integrate and regulate the network dynamics largely operating at slow 
587 
frequencies 171,174,175.  
588 
 
589 
 
590 
Local, top-down, and bottom-up influences on spontaneous activity 
591 
At each site in the brain, spontaneous activity reflects three different factors: first, locally generated 
592 
activity, that is, reactivation of that area’s index code, second, influences from higher level index 
593 
codes, generating correlations spanning multiple brain areas, and third, influences from areas 
594 
further down the principal gradient, which can trigger higher level pattern completion and thus drive 
595 
the refinement and updating of the local index code. Locally generated activation would favor 
596 
consolidation of the local memory trace and send messages both up- and downstream. Top-down 
597 
influences would help to shape inter-area connections and establish the link between the index code 
598 
and the lower-level codes it refers to. Bottom-up influences may bias the re-activation of index 
599 
codes, providing feedback useful for learning processes 121. These assumptions may be tested for 
600 
example by observing replay in a given area while inactivating areas either upstream or downstream, 
601 
and characterizing changes in statistical features and information content. For example, inactivating 
602 
a hub area should, in our view, disrupt the connectivity between upstream areas. For example, 
603 
inactivating the hippocampus may prevent a replay event started in auditory cortex to spread to 
604 
visual cortex, integrating the multi-modal aspects of the memory of an episode. The effect should be 
605 
stronger for a recent memory. Inactivation of DMN effects should produce similar effects, but for 
606 
older memories. 
607

Seen at the global level, replay takes the form of transient widespread activations  
609 
Replay-related  activations propagate as neuronal avalanches and show the statistics of near-critical 
610 
phenomena (a power-law distribution of avalanche sizes). In the scenario depicted above, the 
611 
hippocampus and cortex form one system dominated by feedback. Intra-area and inter-area 
612 
feedback together generate widespread waves of activity, in some cases involving most of the brain. 
613 
These waves are supported by relatively modest inter-area connectivity. The brain solves this 
614 
problem by working at a near-critical regime (Box 2), which is known to maximize long-range 
615 

 
 
correlations and therefore to “amplify” the sparse, multi-synaptic connectivity between distant 
616 
areas. In this arrangement, avalanches may induce correlations between areas that are far apart on 
617 
the principal gradient. The computational consequence of that is that codes are linked that are not 
618 
immediate “superiors” or “inferiors” in the index hierarchy. We speculate that this could induce a 
619 
massive acceleration of learning of complex representations. Areas that are higher up in the 
620 
principal gradient would have the ability to generate larger avalanches (as suggested by 
621 
computational studies taking anatomical connectivity and spine density into account 133133) (Fig. 2). 
622 
To test the role of avalanches in learning and memory, a possible experiment would involve 
623 
manipulation of activity in brain regions closer or further from the “critical point”, for example 
624 
through closed-loop stimulation, and testing how memory consolidation and neural activity is 
625 
affected.  
626 
 
627 
Conclusion 
628 
 
629 
The CMS theory delineated above synthesizes a large number of observations into a new functional 
630 
view. It provides a framework to understand increasingly wider scale data on global brain activity (as 
631 
well as single-cell resolution data). For example, it could explain how brain-wide spatial 
632 
representations 176, coordinated by the hippocampus 177 , arise, and the role of mixed selectivity 
633 
representations that appear in primary sensory cortices 178. In addition, it could explain the 
634 
emergence of semantic representations which may constitute the building blocks for simulations of 
635 
complex situations. Finally, it has the potential to facilitate reconciliation between data from human 
636 
subjects (where mesoscopic data from e.g., fMRI or MEG combined with complex cognitive 
637 
challenges is readily available) and animals (where information about neural codes at the 
638 
microscopic level can more easily be collected). 
639 
Clearly, it makes a number of hypotheses and predictions that still need to be tested experimentally 
640 
and examined theoretically. We have seen in the previous sections how three kinds of experiments 
641 
will be key to evaluate our theory. First, functional inactivation and disconnection experiments may 
642 
be used to investigate the bottom-up and top-down flow of information during replay, to see if it fits 
643 
our framework. Second, linking data (on DMN activity for example) at the BOLD level and the single 
644 
neuron ensemble (through magnetoencephalography, local field potentials and other mesoscopic 
645 
techniques) is still difficult and results are not always unambiguous. Therefore, whether co-
646 
activations in the DMN reflect replay, at least partly coordinated by the hippocampus, and whether 
647 
that information is propagated to other cortical subnetworks is still a matter for experimental 
648 
investigation. Experiments involving multiple readout modalities (micro and mesoscopic) linking the 
649 
activity of ‘hub’ areas (using e.g. decoding techniques) may address this. Third, a question for both 
650 
theoreticians and experimentalists is whether critical-like dynamics actually facilitate learning and 
651 
consolidation. There are some models that start addressing that (see e.g. ref.179). Experiments that 
652 
modulate the critical state of the brain, either locally or globally may help supporting or disproving 
653 
that idea. 
654 
There are also limitations in our theory that will need to be addressed, the cortical ‘desynchronized’ 
655 
regime of the awake brain does not show the same critical state180 and thus it is unclear whether our 
656 
theory could also apply to the awake state, when memories are encoded. It is possible that criticality 
657 
is still present but limited to transient events or subsets of neurons, or that altogether different 
658 
dynamical principles are at play in the awake state. Finally, a major function of DMN is planning and 
659 
simulation and awake replay (described in Box 1) is likely to play a role there too. While a theory for 
660 
that may present close links to our memory model, significant adaptations are also likely to be 
661 
needed.  
662 

 
 
In sum, we have here connected two research fields that, for the most part, have been treated as 
663 
separate neural phenomena and are studied with the help of different species and techniques. By 
664 
highlighting the commonalities in anatomy, function and activity dynamics present in DMN and 
665 
replay processes, we hope to foster new insights and open up collaborations between these fields, 
666 
with the perspective of providing a unified mechanistic account of memory, planning and simulation 
667 
processes.

Figure 3: Modes of cortical activations in the CMS model.  
671 
We represent cortical networks in the hierarchical formalism of Mesulam130 and Margulies129 (see 
672 
Fig. 2). Color background depicts the principal gradient from Margulies from DMN areas (yellow) to 
673 
unimodal sensory areas (green) augmented with the hippocampal formation (red) at the DMN end. 
674 
Color of neurons denotes order of activation (red – yellow – green – cyan) during a transient event. 
675 
Red and gray lines denote, respectively, connection pathways that are, or are not, activated during 
676 
the transient event.  
677 
a) For simple percepts, local transients involving a few unimodal or heteromodal areas are 
678 
observed, as in the case of the visual percept of the peasant’s foot (left) or of the music (right). 
679 
Cortical ripples likely indicate transient activation and are interestingly also observed in primary 
680 
sensory areas 39. The activations are probably supported by strong local recurrent connectivity 
681 
(inset to the right).  
682 
b) Transients limited to sectors of the DMN and areas downstream along the principal gradient 
683 
correspond to (re)activation of factorized142 representations of independent causes or agents 
684 
making up the episode. These factorized representations depend on previously acquired 
685 
knowledge. For example, the representation of a dancer (left) may include information about the 
686 
identity of the dancer, the steps in the peasant dance, the role that that dancer plays in that 
687 
traditional celebration. Another cortical network, ignited by another subset of the DMN would be 
688 

 
 
responsible for the activation of the representation of the bagpipe, including attributes such as 
689 
the shape of the instrument, its sound, the tune being played. Thus, in this scheme, episodic and 
690 
semantic consolidation are part of the same dynamical process and correspond to activations at 
691 
different scales.  
692 
c) Left: For a recently experienced episode (here symbolized by “The Peasant Dance” by Pieter 
693 
Bruegel the Elder), consolidation, and retrieval of the whole episode are supported by global 
694 
cortical transient activations. In this case, activations include the hippocampus, which likely plays 
695 
a key role in initiating the transients. Right: For a remote episode (here, “Peasant Wedding 
696 
Feast”, also by Pieter Bruegel the Elder), retrieval is likely ignited by DMN structures. 
697 
Hippocampal activation may follow. This layout parallels dual memory systems theory14,48 with 
698 
the additional assumptions that activations are transient, dependent on the cortex’s near-critical 
699 
dynamical regime and initiated by the hippocampus for recent memories (and DMN areas for 
700 
remote ones).
