Abstract 
 
In this thesis an Eulerian two-phase Computational Fluid Dynamics 
(CFD) model for modelling bubble columns is presented. The model is 
able to predict bubble size with the use of an Interfacial Area 
Concentration Equation (IACE) coupled to the dispersed phase as a 
scalar transport equation. The IACE model is able to predict bubble 
coalescence and breakup and a resulting Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) in 
the computational domain. 
The bubble size distribution in a square bubble column is measured with 
the non-intrusive optical laser based method Interferometric Particle 
Imaging (IPI) and the bubble velocity is measured with Particle Tracking 
Velocimetry (PTV). The measurements are done for three superficial gas 
velocities in a plane in the middle of the bubble column. The IPI 
measurements show a bubble SMD of approximately 6.0mm in the entire 
field of view, which is also observed visually. Local bubble size 
histograms are presented in order to gain data for comparison of 
computational and experimental data. The experimental SMD seems to 
be constant in the axial direction, whereas it is decreasing radially toward 
the wall. It also seems that the experimental SMD is decreasing with 
increasing superficial gas velocity.  
A computational analysis of the flow pattern in the square bubble column 
is done without employing the IACE model. Different interfacial forces 
and turbulence models are tested, and simulated velocity profiles are 
compared with experimental PIV data from the literature. Excellent 
agreement with the experimental data is obtained. It is observed that the 
lift force is essential for modelling the fluctuating behaviour of the 
bubble plume. 

iv 
 
Two different kernels for bubble coalescence and breakup are 
implemented in the IACE model. Both kernels are tested on the square 
bubble column at three superficial gas velocities. The simulations show 
some agreement with experimental IPI data. The simulated SMD is 
decreasing in the axial direction, whereas the experimental SMD seems 
constant. In the radial direction the simulated SMD is decreasing toward 
the walls just like the experimental SMD. The simulated SMD is 
increasing with increasing superficial gas velocity. This is not seen in the 
experimental IPI data, where the SMD seems constant or even decreasing 
with increasing superficial gas velocity. Overall the kernels by Moilanen 
et al. (2008) seem to perform better than the kernels by Wu et al. (1998). 
The inclusion of bubble size dependent lift force does not yield good 
results, which is quite surprising. 
A flat pseudo-2D bubble column is modelled with the IACE model and 
compared with experimental data from the literature. The kernels by Wu 
et al. (1998) are not able to predict the SMD satisfactorily. The SMD is 
decreasing axially, which is the opposite trend seen in the experiments. 
The kernels by Moilanen et al. (2008) do a better prediction of the axial 
SMD. Especially when employing both bubble size dependent lift and 
bubble induced turbulence. For the latter case the trend of the 
experimental SMD is captured, although the simulated SMD is about 
50% higher than the experimental SMD.

Synopsis 
 
I denne afhandling præsenteres en Eulerisk tofaset numerisk fluid-
dynamik model til modellering af boblekolonner. Modellen kan beregne 
boblestørrelse ved brug af en grænsearealskoncentrationsligning (IACE), 
der er koblet til den spredte fase som en skalær transportligning. IACE-
modellen kan beregne sammenklumpning og opbrydning af bobler, 
hvorved en Sauter gennemsnitsdiameter (SMD) beregnes i domænet. 
Boblestørrelsesfordelingen måles i en kvadratisk boblekolonne med 
”Interferometric Particle Imaging” (IPI), som er en ikke-indtrængende 
optisk laserbaseret metode. Boblehastigheden måles samtidig med 
”Particle Tracking Velocimetry” (PTV). Målingerne udføres for tre 
superficielle gashastigheder i en plan i midten af boblekolonnen. IPI-
målingerne viser en SMD på omkring 6.0mm for hele måleområdet, 
hvilket også er observeret visuelt. Lokale boblestørrelseshistogrammer 
præsenteres for at få data, der kan sammenlignes med beregningerne. 
Den eksperimentelle SMD synes at være konstant lodret gennem 
boblekolonnen, men faldende fra midten ind mod væggen horisontalt. 
Den eksperimentelle SMD synes også at falde med stigende superficiel 
gashastighed. 
En beregningsanalyse af flowmønstret i den kvadratiske boblekolonne er 
udført uden brug af IACE-modellen. Forskellige grænsefladekræfter og 
turbulensmodeller er testet, og simulerede hastighedsprofiler er 
sammenlignet 
med 
eksperimentelle 
PIV 
data 
fra 
litteraturen. 
Simuleringerne viser god enighed med eksperimentelle data. Det er 
observeret at løftekraften er essentiel for at modellere den fluktuerende 
opførsel af den opstigende boblekaskade.

To forskellige kerner, der kan beregne sammenklumpning og opbrydning 
af bobler er implementeret i IACE-modellen. Begge kerner er testet på 
den kvadratiske boblekolonne ved tre forskellige superficielle 
gashastigheder. 
Simuleringerne 
viser 
nogen 
enighed 
med 
de 
eksperimentelle IPI data. Den simulerede SMD falder med stigende 
højde i boblekolonnen, hvor den eksperimentelle SMD synes at være 
konstant. Fra midten af boblekolonnen ud mod væggene viser den 
simulerede SMD en faldende tendens, hvilket den eksperimentelle SMD 
også gør. Den simulerede SMD stiger med stigende superficiel 
gashastighed. Dette er ikke observeret ud fra de eksperimentelle IPI data, 
hvor SMD synes at være konstant eller endda faldende med stigende 
superficiel gashastighed. Alt i alt synes kernen fra Moilanen et al. (2008) 
at give bedre resultater end kernen fra Wu et al. (1998). Inkludering af 
boblestørrelsesafhængig løftekraft giver ikke gode resultater, hvilket er 
ret overraskende. 
En flad psudo-2D boblekolonne modelleres med IACE-modellen, og 
resultaterne er sammenlignet med data fra litteraturen. Kernen fra Wu et 
al. (1998) er ikke i stand til at beregne en tilfredsstillende SMD. SMD 
falder med stigende højde i boblekolonnen, hvilket er den modsatte 
tendens sammenlignet med eksperimentelle data. Kernen fra Moilanen et 
al. (2008) er bedre til at beregne SMD i boblekolonnen sammenlignet 
med eksperimentelle data, især hvis den boblestørrelsesafhængige 
løftekraft samt bobleinduceret turbulens er inkluderet i modellen. Med 
disse indstillinger viser simuleringen den samme tendens i SMD som de 
eksperimentelle data med stigende højde i boblekolonnen, dog er den 
simulerede SMD ca. 50 % højere end den eksperimentelle værdi.

Introduction 
1.1 
Bubble columns 
Bubble columns are used in a variety of industrial processes as reactors, 
absorbers or strippers etc. Bubble columns have distinct advantages when 
compared to other gas-liquid contactors. Two of these are the simple 
construction and the absence of moving mechanical parts. Therefore the 
bubble column is easy to construct and maintain.  
The optimal configuration of a bubble column can be determined 
experimentally or computationally. Experimental determination of an 
optimal configuration requires a series of steps. Typically a lab scale 
model is set up and experiments are done. A pilot scale plant is then built 
based on the findings on the lab scale and further experiments are done. 
In the end the full scale bubble column is built into an existing plant from 
the experiences obtained with the pilot plant using scale-up laws. This 
process is time consuming and quite expensive. 
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) can provide data which is not 
obtainable from traditional experimental techniques in less time and with 
fewer costs. Because of the dramatic increase in computing power over 
the last few decades, the usage of CFD for designing and optimizing unit 
operations has increased immensely. CFD should however be used with 
caution as the mathematical closures implemented in CFD codes are 
seldom universal. It is of great importance to validate mathematical 
closures against experimental data to see if the closures can be used for a 
small or large range of applications.

CHAPTER 1  
Detailed review papers on modelling of bubble columns using CFD are 
available from Jacobsen et al. (1997) and Rafique et al. (2004). 
 
1.2 
Experimental data 
It is of interest to conduct experimental studies of the flow pattern and 
Bubble Size Distribution (BSD) in a variety of bubble columns because 
of the need for validation of theoretical models. Experimental data on the 
flow pattern in bubble columns are available from different studies. Some 
of these are mentioned in the following.  
Becker et al. (1994) measured the flow in a flat rectangular bubble 
column with Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and measuring probes 
and anemometers. The inlet was located 10cm to the left of the centre in 
the bottom plate.  
Borchers et al. (1999) studied the flow in a flat rectangular bubble 
column and measured the liquid velocity with LDA. The inlet was 
located in the centre of the bottom plate.  
Becker et al. (1999) studied the time dependent flow behaviour of the 
liquid phase in a flat rectangular bubble column with focus on the 
dynamics of circulation flows. The measurement method was LDA. The 
inlet was located in the centre of the bottom plate.  
Delnoij et al. (2000) employed a new ensemble correlation multiphase 
flow Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) technique in a flat bubble 
column. The technique featured a single camera setup compared to the 
known two-camera PIV setup. The inlet was located near the right wall in 
the bottom plate.  
Bröder & Sommerfeld (2000) employed a two camera PIV/PTV (Particle 
Tracking Velocimetry) system to measure the flow in a circular bubble 
column. Fluorescent particles were added to the continuous phase to be 
able to measure the liquid velocity.  

INTRODUCTION

Deen (2001) measured the flow in a square bubble column with PIV and 
LDA. The inlet of the bubble column was placed in the centre of the 
bottom plate. 
Bubble size has bee measured with a variety of measuring techniques in 
different bubble columns. A few studies are presented in the following. 
Lage and Espósito (1999) measured bubble diameters of air bubbles in 
aqueous isopropanol photographically in a bubble column at different 
superficial gas velocities. The diameter of the bubbles was determined 
manually and BSDs were fitted from the data.  
Laín et al. (1999) used a two-component Phase Doppler Anemometer 
(PDA) to measure bubble size distribution and velocities of both phases 
in a circular bubble column.  
Magaud et al. (2001) used a dual optical probe technique to measure void 
fraction, bubble size and bubble velocity in a vertical rectangular 
channel. The technique is based on changes in the optical index of the 
medium located at the probe tip.  
Van den Hengel (2004) used a shadow imaging technique to measure the 
bubble size in a flat rectangular bubble column. The  
Majumder et al. (2006) used a shadow imaging technique to determine 
the BSD and the gas-liquid specific interfacial area as a function of axial 
location, nozzle diameter and superficial gas and liquid velocities in a 
modified bubble column. 
This work is a continuation of the work done on a square bubble column 
by Deen (2001). Since the flow pattern in the square bubble column is 
already mapped, the emphasis should be on measuring the bubble size 
distribution in the square bubble column.

CHAPTER 1  
1.3 
Flow modelling 
Besides measuring the flow pattern in the square bubble column with 
LDA and PIV, Deen (2001) also did a computational analysis of the flow 
pattern with CFD. Deen (2001) compared computations, which showed 
good agreement with experimental data.  
Deen et al. (2001) found that the standard k-ε turbulence model was not 
able to capture the dynamic behaviour of the bubble plume inside the 
column. Therefore a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) sub-grid approach 
proposed by Smagorinsky (1963) was employed, which was able to 
simulate the large scale fluctuations and thereby the dynamic behaviour 
of the bubble plume, provided that essential interfacial forces were also 
employed. Zhang et al. (2005) successfully predicted the dynamic 
behaviour in the square bubble column using a k-ε turbulence model 
extended with Bubble Induced Turbulence (BIT). 
It was also found by Deen (2001) that careful choice of the interfacial 
forces was important. It was observed that the lift force was an essential 
interfacial force. Zhang et al. (2006) did a more thorough study of 
different interfacial forces on the square bubble column. Zhang et al. 
(2006) also observed that the lift force plays a critical role for capturing 
the dynamic behaviour of the bubble plume. 
 
1.4 
Modelling bubble size 
Bubble size plays an important role in a gas-liquid contactor such as a 
bubble column. The mass transfer between phases is directly related to 
the surface area of gas bubbles. Therefore it is important to know the 
BSD. A bubble column is a dynamic system, where bubbles collide with 
walls and other bubbles, resulting in bubble coalescence and bubble 
breakup. Bubble coalescence and breakup can also be induced by 
turbulence which complicates matters significantly. The resulting bubble 
size distribution in a bubble column as a function of operating conditions 
is therefore difficult to describe computationally.  

INTRODUCTION 
 
5 
A number of different approaches to modelling bubble size exist. A few 
are mentioned in the following. 
Wu et al. (1998) used an Interfacial Area Concentration Equation (IACE) 
to model one dimensional vertical bubbly flow. Here the IACE is solved 
by a scalar transport equation in the dispersed phase of a two-phase flow. 
Ishii and Kim (2001) used the latter IACE model to predict one 
dimensional bubbly flow in round pipes. Moilanen et al. used a modified 
version of the latter IACE model to predict bubble size and mass transfer 
in an aerated vessel. 
Sanyal et al. (2005) compared the performance of Population Balance 
Equations (PBE) in bubble columns. The PBEs were the Classes Method 
(CM) and the Quadratic Method Of Moments (QMOM). With CM the 
BSD is divided into N classes, and the number density equation is solved 
for each class. With QMOM 2N moments are tracked and a pd-algorithm 
is used for obtaining the BSD, which is represented by N size classes. 
Bove et al. (2005) use a PBE approach to model the bubble size in 
bubble columns. The PBE was split into a convective part and a 
coalescence-breakage part. The convective part was solved with the 
Parallel Classes Approach (PCA) and the coalescence-breakage part was 
then solved with the Parallel Parent and Daughter Class (PPDC) 
approach. 
Cheung et al. (2007) used a PBE approach with the MUSIG model and 
three different IACE models by Wu et al. (1998), Hibiki & Ishii (2002) 
and Yao & Morel (2004) to predict bubble size in isothermal vertical 
bubbly flow. 
Krepper et al. (2008) modelled the BSD with a generalized 
inhomogeneous MUSIG model. Here the dispersed phase was divided 
into N velocity groups each having its own velocity field, and the overall 
BSD was represented by dividing the bubble diameter range within each 
of the velocity groups. 
Bannari et al. (2008) used a Classes Method PBE to model bubble size in 
bubble columns. Here the BSD was represented through a finite number 
of bubble classes.

Objectives of the current work 
The objectives of this study are to determine the bubble size distribution 
in a square bubble column experimentally and computationally, and to 
compare the computations with the experimental data. Furthermore the 
computational model should be tested on a different bubble column and 
compared with experimental data.

Organization of the thesis 
In Chapter 2 the experimental work done on a square bubble column is 
presented for three superficial gas velocities. IPI and PTV are used for 
determining bubble size and bubble velocity respectively. 
The theory behind CFD for multiphase flow is presented in Chapter 3. 
Also the specific models for modelling the flow and bubble size in the 
bubble column are presented. 
In Chapter 4 the numerical simulations of the flow pattern in the square 
bubble column are presented. The simulations are run with different 
turbulence- and interfacial forces presented in Chapter 3. Furthermore the 
simulations are run with two different inlet conditions. The results are 
compared with a selected simulation by Deen (2001) and the PIV 
experiments by Deen (2001). 
Numerical simulations of bubble size in the square bubble column are 
presented for three superficial gas velocities in Chapter 5. The bubble 
size is calculated with the IACE model. Two different kernels for 
coalescence and breakup are used in the simulations. The simulated 
bubble size is compared to experimental IPI data from Chapter 2 and 
velocity profiles are compared to PIV data by Deen (2001).

2.1 
Introduction 
In this chapter the theory behind the Interferometric Particle Imaging 
with Particle Tracking Velocimetry (IPI/PTV) optical laser based 
measurement technique is presented. Furthermore the experimental setup 
and the results from the experiments are presented. 
IPI is a relatively new imaging technique for determining the diameter of 
spherical transparent particles and its origins can be traced back to König  
et al. (1986) who focused a single laser beam onto a stream of 
monodispersed droplets and measured the resulting fringe pattern in the 
out-of-focus field (Albrecht et al., 2003). The possibility of combining 
the method with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was then discussed by 
Glover et al.  (1995). 
The strength of the IPI technique is its ability to measure the 
instantaneous bubble diameter and velocity of spatially distributed 
bubbles (Madsen, 2006). Furthermore the IPI sizing technique is readily 
implemented in the standard and well known Particle Image Velocimetry 
(PIV) setup by employing an extra camera, which means that it is 
possible to do instantaneous whole-field measurements of the particle 
diameter instead of point measurements as for Phase Doppler 
Anemometry (PDA). 
The whole-field measurements will not only yield the size of the bubbles, 
but also the position because the bubbles are registered individually. By 

10 
CHAPTER 2  
using double exposure imaging, the velocity components of the bubble 
can then be evaluated with PTV (Dantec, 2003). 
 
2.2 
Interferometric Particle Imaging (IPI) 
When focusing a camera on a transparent bubble that has been 
illuminated by a coherent laser sheet, the scattered light will produce two 
bright spots or glare points on a Charged Coupled Device (CCD) chip (as 
seen from the receiver). One glare point represents the reflected ray and 
the other glare point represents the refracted ray. This is shown in Figure 
1. 
 
Figure 1 
Glare points on the CCD chip generated by the reflected and 
refracted light respectively (Dantec, 2003). 
The existence of both glare points is dependent on the light scattering 
properties of the particle-medium and the off-axis angle of the receiver. 
By defocusing the camera with respect to the particle the two glare points 
will interfere to produce measurable fringes on a CCD array, which is 
illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 
Generation of fringes by moving the focus plane of the 
camera away from the plane of the light sheet and particle 
(Madsen et al., 2003). 
From the frequency of the fringes it is possible to determine the distance 
between the glare points and thereby the size of the particle. In order to 
get good image quality (contrast), the relative refraction index (m) should 
be below 0.8 or above 1.2 (Dantec, 2003). Since this study deals with air 
bubbles in water (m=0.75), this condition is satisfied.  
The sphericity of the particles is important, because of the orientation of 
the fringes. A particle with a sphericity of unity will yield horizontal 
fringes, whereas a particle with sphericity below unity will angle the 
fringes relative to the horizontal position. This means that the angle is a 
good measure for validation of the particle diameter. 
The size of the out-of-focused particle image is independent of particle 
size, but rather on particle position in the light sheet and the amount of 
user applied defocusing.

straight, so a more reasonable requirement is three or four pixels per 
fringe (Madsen, 2006). 
 
Figure 3 
Optics schematics (Albrect, 2003). 
The maximum particle size that can be measured will depend on the size 
of the out-of-focus particle image, the optic configuration, and the 
camera resolution (Madsen, 2006). From the equations for κ and dmax 
there are a number of parameters that need to be determined in order to 
define dmin and dmax. However in practice there are only a few parameters 
that are adjustable (not defined by the measurement equipment) such as 
z, φ and nx, where z and φ are used for defining both dmin and the field of 
view and nx is used for defining dmax. When φ and z and thereby dmin has 
been chosen, dmax can only be increased by user controlled defocusing. 
There is however a trade-off between defocusing and image contrast. 
When defocusing the number of detectable fringes increase, but the 
signal to noise ratio will become lower. Therefore it is important to select 
a suitable dmin, so that the level of defocusing can be kept to a minimum. 
A representative image of fringes from an out of focus image is shown in 
Figure 4. The range of fringes present can be seen to range from 
approximately 2 to 30.

2.3 
Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) 
Particle tracking Velocimetry (PTV) is used for determining the velocity 
of the particles. PTV is used instead of PIV when the number of particles 
in the image is sparse. 
In an IPI setup, an out of focus camera is recording the bubble size and 
the in focus camera is recording the position of the particle. By using 
double exposure on the in focus camera, the displacement of the particle 
between bursts is recorded. It is therefore possible to calculate the 
velocity of the particle, which is done with PTV. 
PTV is done in four steps. First a cross-correlation is done for double 
exposure images. This generates vectors that represent the flow direction 
of particles in local areas. For each of the particles in frame 1 a 
comparison is done for each of the particles in frame 2 using the cross-
correlation. Thereby matching each particle in frame 1 with likely 
candidates in frame 2. Statistics are then employed to determine, which 
of the candidates is most likely the perfect match. The velocity is then 
determined from the pixel displacement of the particle and the time 
between the double exposure (Dantec, 2003). This is illustrated in Figure 
5. 

EXPERIMENTS 
 
15 
 
Figure 5 
Illustration of PTV (Dantec, 2003). 
When doing PTV an optimal time between bursts (double exposure) is 
important. If the time is too short, the pixel displacement will be none for 
some of the particles and the velocity will be zero. If the time between 
exposures is too long, the cross-correlation and statistics will fail to 
predict the matching pair of particles between frame 1 and 2. The time 
between exposures is found by doing tests before acquiring data. When 
the data is acquired it is obviously not possible to change the exposure 
time in order to produce better PTV results. 
 
2.4 
Experimental setup 
Measurements were done on a square bubble column with dimensions 
0.15m x 0.15m x 1m (water level at 0.45m). The column is built in 
Plexiglas and raised from the ground in a steel skeleton, so that optical 
access is possible. A sketch of the square bubble column can be seen in 
Figure 6. 

16 
CHAPTER 2  
 
Figure 6 
Sketch of the square bubble column. 
The inlet of the square bubble column is a distributor plate with 49 holes 
with diameter of 1 mm at a square pitch of 6.25 mm (see Figure 7). The 
plate is expected to yield bubbles with a mean diameter of 4mm (Deen, 
2001). The inlet is centred in the bottom of the column.

The experimental setup is a Dantec FlowMap Particle Sizer system at 
Aalborg University Esbjerg, which consists of a laser, two cameras, 
traversing unit, a Dantec Flowmapper and a PC. The cameras were 
placed parallel to one another and directed onto a common viewing area 

EXPERIMENTS 
 
17 
at an angle to the light sheet. The laser source was a 120 mJ double-
pulsed Nd:YAG laser at λ = 532 nm with a repetition frequency of 15 
Hz, and a laser sheet thickness of about 1.0mm. The laser light was 
polarized perpendicular to the laser sheet. The cameras used were 8-bit 
Kodak MegaPlus ES1.0 digital CCD cameras with a resolution of 1008 × 
1016 pixels. For both cameras a 60mm objective lens was used. The 
cameras and laser head were mounted on a 3D traversing unit, so it was 
possible to access almost the entire column. The size of measurement 
area was approximately 0.15m × 0.12m. Double images were acquired in 
order to be able to measure velocities of the dispersed phase with PTV. 
Dantec Dynamic Studio software was used for the post-processing of the 
acquired data. In Figure 8 a schematic representation of the experimental 
setup is shown.

CHAPTER 2  
Distilled water and air at room temperature was used in all experiments. 
Following the work by van den Hengel (2004), a small amount of 
Octanol (10-4 kmol/m3) was added in order to obtain almost spherical 
bubbles. When the Octanol was added, a significant visible effect was 
seen. The column looked like it was boiling erratically as soon as the 
Octanol was added, but after a while the bubble plume went back to 
normal behaviour and the bubbles were significantly more spherical than 
before. 
The measurements were done at a single location in the bubble column, 
where the centre of the camera was fixed vertically at y = 0.25m and the 
measurement plane (field of view) was fixed at a depth of z = 0.075m. 
This is shown in Figure 9.

Sketch of the measurement location. The centre of the 
rectangular field of view is located at a height of 0.25m. The 
plane of measurement is located at a depth of 0.075m. 
Deen (2001) recorded PIV data in the bubble column at a superficial gas 
velocity of 4.9 mm/s, so this velocity is naturally chosen as the starting 
point for obvious comparison reasons. Two other superficial gas 
velocities were also planned, and it was observed that with a superficial 
gas velocity above 6.6 mm/s the bubble plume started to act differently in 
the column. This velocity was chosen as the upper limit. The lower limit 
was then set to 3.2 mm/s, so that the velocity 4.9 mm/s was right in the 
middle of the limits. Measurements were then done at three different 
superficial gas velocities: 3.2 mm/s, 4.9 mm/s and 6.6 mm/s. 

EXPERIMENTS 
 
19 
The aim of the measurements was to be able to measure the width of the 
bubble column in every picture, and that a sufficiently large bubble 
diameter could be detected. The adjustable parameters in the 
experimental setup z, φ and nx were chosen accordingly. 
The distance to the light sheet, z, was determined together with the off-
axis angle φ. For bubbles in liquid, the off-axis angle φ should be 
positioned below 45° as can be seen from the example in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Example of minimum and maximum diameter as a function of 
observation angle with z = 0.9m (Hansen et al., 2007). 
It is observed from Figure 10 that with z = 0.9m, φ should be less than 
40° as the slope of dmin increases rapidly with φ > 40°. nx is set to 90 
pixels in Figure 10 in order to show the maximum detectable diameter. 
After multiple tests and considerations φ is set to 35° and nx,max was set to 
90, which was regarded as being the maximum value, as the noise level 
began to dominate.  
The number of samples was set to 10,000 image pairs per run. It was 
found during the initial test runs that every image pair yielded 
approximately 10 validated bubbles, which gives 105 bubbles per run. If 
the field of view (0.15m × 0.13m) is divided into a 7 x 6 grid, only 

20 
CHAPTER 2  
approximately 2300 validated bubbles will be found in each grid cell on 
average. This is regarded as being appropriate for statistical analysis on 
the data.

Post processing of acquired experimental data 
After acquiring the data, it was processed using Dantec Dynamic Studio 
software. Here the IPI and PTV processing was done simultaneously. 
The processing of a single measurement with 10,000 image pairs took 
approximately 60 hours on an AMD 2.1 GHz CPU from 2007. 
 
2.5.1 IPI processing 
The IPI processing is done in several steps. First a bubble is spotted on 
the focused image. The location of the bubble in the focused image is 
then used for finding a matching defocused bubble in the defocused 
image. If a match is found, the circle size of the defocused bubble is 
determined.  

EXPERIMENTS 
 
21 
If the bubble is overlapping with another bubble, the overlap is masked 
(ignored), and the remaining measurable area is calculated (Dantec, 
2003). This is shown in Figure 11. 
 
Figure 11 Defocused bubble images are overlapping. The overlapping 
areas are masked (Dantec, 2003). 
A 2D FFT and a 2D Gaussian interpolation are then employed to 
determine the dominant frequency peak, from which the diameter of the 
bubble can be determined using Eqs. 3 and 4. 
In Figure 12, the influence of the overlap on frequency determination is 
shown. The error in the frequency calculation of an overlap of 46% and 
92% is 3% and 5% respectively (Dantec, 2003). 

22 
CHAPTER 2  
 
Figure 12 Influence of the overlap on frequency determination (Dantec, 
2003). 
Before doing IPI on the raw images it can be a good idea to do filtering 
on the images with the built-in Image Processing Library (IPL). When 
experiencing weak fringes or fringes varying in intensity on the 
defocused image, it is recommended to use a high pass filter to remove 
the low frequency information. Also one can use a low pass filter to 
remove extraneous background noise (Dantec, 2003). In Figure 13 a 
defocused image with and without IPL filtering is shown. 
        
 
Figure 13 Left: defocused image of two detected bubbles showing fringe 
patterns. Right: With IPL filtering. (Hansen et al., 2007). 

EXPERIMENTS 
 
23 
In the left image, two detected bubbles are showing fringes of different 
quality. The bubble on the left is clearly showing a fringe pattern, 
whereas the bubble on the right is not showing a clear fringe pattern. 
Using IPL on the raw defocused image with a high pass and a low pass 
filter yields the image on the right. It is now possible to see a fringe 
pattern in the bubble on the right. The high pass filter removes the low 
frequency information, so that the fringes are easy to spot, whereas the 
low pass filter removes the background noise. 
The bubble on the left was validated and the bubble on the right was 
rejected by the software. The rejection is either due to peak level 
validation or frequency ratio validation. The quality of the fringe pattern 
in the bubble on the right is simply too poor. 
 
2.5.2 IPI validation 
When doing the IPI analysis a number of validation parameters have to 
be determined. There are four important settings: frequency ratio, peak 
level, overlap and image brightness (Dantec, 2003). 
• A frequency ratio threshold is set in order to reject bubbles with 
no or poor fringe definition. As the frequency in the x-direction is 
more dominant than in the y-direction for IPI measurements an 
Fx / Fy ratio threshold is employed. 
• A peak level threshold rejects bubbles with a peak level lower 
than a percentage of the maximum peak determined. 
• An overlap threshold is employed to ensure that the error in the 
frequency determination is kept at a minimum. 
• A bubble detection threshold on the focused image ensures that 
faint bubbles, detected on the focused image, will be matched on 
the defocused image, as a faint bubble will not yield fringes on 
the defocused image. 
 

24 
CHAPTER 2  
2.5.3 PTV validation 
The most important parameter of the PTV analysis is the size of the 
interrogation area. The entire field of view of the camera is divided into 
smaller interrogation areas. The size of the interrogation area varies from 
16 (4x4) to 256 (16x16) pixels in Dantec Dynamic Studio. When doing 
PTV on flows with few bubbles the interrogation area should be as large 
as possible. As a rule of thumb there should be a minimum of 10-11 
bubbles present per interrogation area (Dantec, 2003). 
 
2.5.4 IPI/PTV settings 
The IPI/PTV post processing settings are listed in Table 2.

The effect of IPL filtering was investigated on the defocused images, but 
as the number of bubble counts increased with approximately 50%, this 
filtering method was discarded.

Results 
In this section the results from the experiments are presented. The section 
is divided into two parts, bubble size distribution and bubble velocity. 
Bubble size histograms along with statistics and profiles of bubble 
velocities are shown for all three superficial gas velocities (3.2, 4.9 and 
6.6 mm/s). 
 
2.6.1 Bubble size distribution in the bubble column 
 
Entire field of view 
In Figure 14 - Figure 16 bubble size distributions (BSD) are shown for 
the entire field of view (Figure 9) for all three superficial velocities.

As expected Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16 show a Poisson 
distribution. The highest number of bubble counts is in the range 1.2-
2.4mm. From this point the number of counts decreases potentially with

increasing diameter. The d10 and d32 is approximately 2.3mm and 6.0mm 
respectively and the total diameter count is approximately 85000. During 
the experiments the diameter was observed visually to be around 5-6mm, 
which is in good agreement with the measured d32. The number of bubble 
counts, the mean bubble diameters d10 and d32 and the standard deviation 
for all three superficial gas velocities measured are listed in Table 3.

Local bubble size distributions 
Instead of looking at the entire field of view it would be interesting to see 
if local variations occur in the field of view. Therefore five different 
locations of 2x2 cm2 in the field of view are investigated. The five 
locations are shown in Figure 18.

From the results in Table 4, the difference in d10 is observed to be small 
with respect to location for all three superficial gas velocities. The 
difference in d32 is a bit larger. The number of counts in location 4 is 
noticed to be low compared to the other locations in all three 
measurements. 
In Figure 22 the average d32 from Table 4 is plotted in the axial direction.

Figure 22 Sauter mean bubble diameter at the axial centreline at a 
depth of 0.075m. 
It is observed that the average d32 decrease with increasing superficial gas 
velocity except for location 3 (y = 0.30). The maximum d32 is found in 
location 1 for all three superficial gas velocities, which seems a little 
strange as an increasing, decreasing or even steady mean bubble diameter 
is expected with increasing height (y). 
In Figure 23 the average d32 from Table 4 is plotted in the radial 
direction. It is observed that the average d32 is decreasing toward the 
walls for all three superficial gas velocities. The maximum diameter for 
all three measuring locations is found with the lowest superficial gas 
velocity. It is not evident here that the average d32 is indeed decreasing 
with increasing superficial gas velocity.

2.6.2 Bubble velocity 
The bubble velocity is calculated with PTV. Vector plots and line plots 
are shown for all three superficial gas velocities and the measurement 
with uG,sup = 4.9 mm/s is compared with experimental data by Deen 
(2001). 
Vector plots of velocity magnitude for the entire field of view are shown 
in Figure 24 for all three superficial gas velocities.

The velocity vectors seem to be pointing in the axial direction as 
expected. There are however two certain locations in all the plots, where 
all neighbouring vectors are pointing toward each other. This unphysical 
behaviour is believed to be due to mirroring effects in the column.  
In Figure 25 the velocity vectors from Figure 24 are shown without the 
radial component for all three superficial velocities.

It is observed that the there are both positive and negative vectors in the 
vicinity of the two “mirroring” locations. This is expected from the plots 
in Figure 24. 
Velocity profiles of the axial velocity are shown in Figure 26 for all three 
superficial gas velocities. Because of the “mirroring” effect at y = 0.25m 
the profiles are shown at y = 0.275m.

The core velocity is noticed to be decreasing with increasing superficial 
velocity. This was not expected. This trend was also discovered by 
Dillerop (2000), who did PIV experiments on the bubble column. 
Velocity profiles from the study by Dillerop with different superficial gas 
velocities are shown in Figure 27.

CHAPTER 2  
 
Figure 27 Time averaged axial gas velocity for different superficial gas 
velocities in y = 0.352m and z = 0.075m. Superficial gas 
velocities are reported in cm/s in the legend (Dillerop, 2000). 
The results from Figure 27 show that the time averaged gas velocity is 
decreasing with increasing uG,sup, this is however only the case when 
uG,sup is above 9.7 mm/s. When uG,sup is below 9.7 mm/s, the velocity 
profile is not changing. It should be noted that the results in Figure 27 are 
at a height of 0.352 m, so they are not directly comparable with the PTV 
data in Figure 26. It is however believed that the trend from Figure 27 
will be the same in a height of 0.25m. 
Since the superficial gas velocities in this thesis are smaller than 9.7 
mm/s, a different reason for the decreasing gas velocities must exist. The 
time between bursts may have been set too large in the experiment, 
resulting in bad correlation of data. If this is the problem it may explain 
why the bubble velocity is decreasing with increasing superficial gas 
velocity, as the bubble displacement grows larger with increasing 
superficial gas velocity. The time between bursts can only be changed by 
repeating the experiment

4.9 mm/s in y = 0.275m and z = 0.075m Experimental data 
by Deen (2001) is in y = 0.025m. 
From Figure 28 it is evident that the PTV data is not in very good 
agreement with the PIV data by Deen (2001). The core velocity is too 
low and the velocity toward the walls is a bit too high.  
 
Interpolated PIV data 
In addition to the PIV measurements at a superficial gas velocity of 4.9 
mm/s, Deen (2001) also did PIV measurements at superficial gas 
velocities of 2.4 mm/s and 7.3 mm/s. The PIV data from all three 
superficial velocities (2.4, 4.9 and 7.3 mm/s) are therefore interpolated to 
yield pseudo experimental data at superficial gas velocities of 3.2 mm/s 
and 6.6 mm/s. In Figure 29 the interpolation is shown for superficial 
velocity 3.2 mm/s.

Deen (2001) and interpolated PIV data for a superficial gas 
velocity of 6.6 mm/s at a height of y = 0.25m and a depth of z 
= 0.075m. 
It is observed that the liquid and gas core velocity are more or less 
constant for superficial velocities of 2.4 and 4.9 mm/s. The significant 
difference in the velocity profiles between the two measurements is 
found for the fluctuations, which decrease with decreasing superficial 
velocity. In the work by Dillerop (2000) it was observed with PIV that 
the axial gas velocity was constant for superficial gas velocities between 
2.4mm/s and 7.3 mm/s at a height of 0.352m, which is also seen at y = 
0.25m in the PIV data by Deen (2001). It was also observed by Dillerop 
(2000) that the axial liquid velocity was significantly lower with a 
superficial velocity of 2.4 mm/s at a height of 0.352m. This is not seen in 
the PIV data by Deen (2001) at y = 0.25m. 
In Figure 30 the interpolation of PIV data is shown for superficial 
velocity 6.6 mm/s.

From Figure 30 it is observed that the axial gas velocity is a little bit 
lower with a superficial velocity of 7.3 mm/s compared to a superficial 
velocity of 4.9 mm/s when looking at the core velocity. The opposite is 
seen for the axial liquid velocity. It is also observed that the velocity 
fluctuations are higher with a superficial velocity of 7.3 mm/s compared 
to a superficial velocity of 4.9 mm/s especially when looking at the axial 
velocity fluctuations. 
In Figure 31 the PTV data for superficial gas velocities 3.2 mm/s and 6.6

and higher respectively when compared to the interpolated PIV data. This 
was expected when looking at Figure 26 and taking the findings by Deen 
(2001) and Dillerop (2000) into consideration.

Summary 
In this chapter the bubble size distribution and bubble velocity in a 
square column has been experimentally measured by Interferometric 
Particle Imaging (IPI) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) 
respectively. The experiment was done for three superficial gas velocities 
in one plane in the middle of the bubble column. 
An introduction to IPI and PTV and a description of the experimental 
setup and post processing techniques have been presented.  
The IPI results from the experiment have been presented in bubble 
diameter histograms, profile plots and tables and the PTV data has been 
presented as vector plots and profile plots along with a comparison with 
experimental and interpolated Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data 
from Deen (2001). 
 

EXPERIMENTS 
 
43 
Bubble size 
From the experimental IPI results it is found that the mean d10 and d32 are 
approximately 2.3mm and 6.0mm respectively. The mean diameter was 
observed visually to be approximately 5-6 mm, which is in excellent 
agreement with the measured value of d32. When looking at bubble 
diameter histograms at different geometric locations in the bubble 
column it is not possible to distinguish between two arbitrarily selected 
bubble diameter histograms. They all show the same trend.  
When looking at mean bubble diameter profiles in the axial direction in 
the bubble column it seems that the Sauter mean bubble diameter, d32, is 
decreasing with increasing superficial gas velocity. The maximum d32 is 
however found in the middle for all three superficial gas velocities. This 
seems a little strange as an increasing, decreasing or even steady average 
d32 is expected axially. 
The mean bubble diameter profiles in the radial direction show that the 
average d32 is smaller near the walls when compared to the average d32 at 
the axial centreline. This is also expected as large bubbles are migrating 
toward the middle or core region of the bubble column, whereas smaller 
bubbles migrate toward the wall according to the experimental 
observations by Tomiyama (2004). It is not evident here that d32 is 
decreasing with increasing superficial gas velocity. 
 
Bubble velocity 
The experimental PTV results are not in good agreement when compared 
to experimental PIV data from Deen (2001). The core velocity is too low 
and the velocity toward the walls is a bit too high. Also a wrong trend in 
the velocity is observed when compared to the discoveries by Dillerop 
(2000). When increasing the superficial gas velocity, the bubble 
velocities in the axial direction decrease significantly. It is believed that 
this is due to a too large time between bursts, which is essential for the 
quality of the PTV data. Furthermore a mirroring effect is believed to be 
present at two distinct locations in the field of view, which distorts the 
data, so that the data is unusable in the vicinity of those locations.  

44 
CHAPTER 2  
Deen (2001) performed a number of PIV experiments with different 
superficial gas velocities. The data from these are interpolated to obtain 
pseudo experimental PIV data at the two superficial gas velocities 3.2 
mm/s and 6.6 mm/s. The axial gas and liquid velocity profiles at these 
superficial velocities are almost identical to the velocity profiles with a 
superficial gas velocity of 4.9 mm/s. A significant difference in the 
velocity profiles is however observed when looking at the axial and 
radial liquid velocity fluctuations.

CFD for Multiphase Flow and 
Bubble Size Prediction 
3.1 
Introduction 
In this chapter the theory behind CFD for multiphase flow is presented. 
Also the specific models for modelling the flow and bubble size in the 
bubble column are given. 
 
3.2 
Multiphase flow modelling 
The models for solving multiphase flow can generally be divided into 
three classes: 
• Interphase tracking models 
• Eulerian-Lagrangian models 
• Eulerian-Eulerian models 
The interphase tracking models include among others level-set methods 
and Volume Of Fluid (VOF) methods. These methods accurately 
describe the interface between two phases, which is important for 
properly modelling for example the change in the shape of a rising 
bubble in quiescent liquid. The drawback is however that these methods 
require a high level of resolution both in grid and modelling in order to 
describe the interface properly, which requires large computational 

46 
CHAPTER 3  
efforts. These methods are therefore not suitable for solving dispersed 
bubbly flows. 
The Eulerian-Lagrangian models are used for modelling dispersed flows. 
In this method the primary phase is treated as a continuum and the 
dispersed phase particle trajectories are tracked individually. This means 
that each particle has a velocity and very distinct properties, which 
allows for a detailed description of the flow of the individual particles. 
The drawback is that the computational effort increases as the total 
number of particles to be tracked increases. This method is therefore only 
suited for solving dilute flows.  
The Eulerian-Eulerian models are used for modelling any type of 
multiphase flows. In this method all phases are treated as separate 
interpenetrating continua, and all equations with interaction terms are 
averaged and solved for each phase. This means this method is able to 
model large scale multiphase flows. The drawback is, however, that 
detailed modelling of the interphase interactions have to be supplied. 
All the modelling in this thesis is done with the Eulerian-Eulerian 
approach, as this is regarded as being the most suitable method for 
modelling flow and bubble size distribution in the bubble columns. 
 
3.3 
Eulerian multiphase model1 
As already mentioned, all phases in the Eulerian multiphase model are 
treated as separate interpenetrating continua. In bubble columns the water 
phase is treated as the continuous or primary phase and the air bubbles 
are regarded as the dispersed or secondary phase(s). The primary and 
secondary phases are characterized by volume fractions, which all per 
definition sum up to unity:

where αL is the liquid volume fraction, αq is the volume fraction of the 
qth gas phase and N is the total number of gas phases.  
In the following, the fluid in each phase is assumed to be incompressible 
and isothermal. Therefore energy balances are not required. Also the 
interfacial mass transfer between the water and gas phase(s) is zero.  
 
3.3.1 Governing equations 
By conditionally ensemble averaging of the local instant conservation 
equations of single-phase flow, the governing equations of the 
multiphase model can be derived (Drew, 1983; Drew and Passman, 
1999). The continuity equation for phase k is given by:

Bubble size prediction 
In the present work the bubble size in the square bubble column is 
modelled with the One-Group Interfacial Area Concentration Equation 
(IACE).  
3.4.1 Interfacial Area Concentration Equation (IACE) 
Reyes (1989) proposed a population balance approach to develop a 
particle number density transport equation for chemically non-reacting, 
dispersed, spherical particles, or in this case bubbles. This model was 
then generalized for the purpose of interfacial area transport by 
Kocamustafaogullari and Ishii (1995), which lead to the following 
equation:

1998) 
The above equation is however too complicated to use in fluid dynamics 
because of dependence on the bubble volume. Therefore the integral 
form of the bubble number density transport equation is used instead:

to modify the integral form of the bubble number density transport 
equation into the one-group interfacial area concentration transport 
equation:

Here the interfacial area concentration ai is defined as total surface of the 
dispersed fluid particles per unit mixture volume. Sn,j is the source/sink 
rate for the interfacial area due to coalescence and breakup, Sn,ph is the 
source/sink rate for the interfacial area due to phase change. The second 
term on the right hand side represents the effects of the variation in 
bubble volume (Wu et al., 1998).  
If the gas phase is considered incompressible without phase change, the

The closure, Sn,j can be modelled in different ways. Two different closure

the following. 
Closure approach by Wu et al. 
The first approach to model the closure in the IACE transport equation is 
adopted from the work of Wu et al. (1998). The kernels have been 
developed for one dimensional bubbly flows in vertical round pipes 
relevant for nuclear engineering. Here the interfacial area and ∑

The source terms Sa,RC, Sa,WE and Sa,TI are the net rates of change of 
interfacial area per unit mixture volume, and these three mechanisms are 
considered to be dominant in one dimensional vertical two-phase bubbly 
flow (Wu et al., 1998). 
Sa,RC represents bubble coalescence from random collisions due to 
turbulence and is given by:

Numerical Simulations of Flow in 
the Square Bubble Column 
4.1 
Introduction 
In this chapter the numerical simulations of the flow pattern in the square 
bubble column are presented. Numerical simulations have already been 
done on the flow pattern in the bubble column by Deen (2001). These 
simulations were compared with experimental data, and excellent 
agreement between experiments and simulations was found (Deen, 
2001). The purpose of repeating the simulations is to validate the flow 
model from chapter 3.3, as this flow model forms the basis for all the 
remaining simulations in this thesis. Also Deen (2001) performed 
simulations in CFX-4.3, whereas the simulations in this thesis are done in 
Fluent 6.3. 
The simulations with the flow model will be compared with a selected 
CFX-4.3 simulation by Deen (2001) and the PIV experiments by Deen 
(2001). 
 
4.2 
Simulation settings 
In this section the simulation settings for the flow pattern simulations are 
presented.  

58 
CHAPTER 4  
4.2.1 Grid and boundary conditions 
The grid used in the simulations is a 0.15m x 0.45m x 0.15m square 
volume meshed with hexahedral cells. The number of cells in the x-, y- 
and z-direction for case 1 is 32, 45 and 32 respectively, which gives a 
total of 46080 hexahedral cells. The grid is the same as used by Deen 
(2001). The geometry with and without mesh can be seen in Figure 33. 
 
    
 
Figure 33 Geometry of the square bubble column with and without 
mesh. 
The inlet of the bubble column is a perforated distributor plate, which has 
7 x 7 (49) holes with a diameter of 1mm and a pitch length of 6.75mm. 
The inlet can either be modelled as a fully open inlet as in the work of 
Deen (2001) or as a perforated plate like in the work of Bove (2005). 
Both inlet approaches are tested in this chapter. 

FLOW SIMULATIONS 
 
59 
Deen inlet 
The inlet boundary condition is modelled as a velocity inlet in Fluent 6.3, 
where the velocity and volume fraction of the fluid are to be specified. 
The inlet is modelled with 8x8 cells, which gives an inlet area Ainlet of 
0.0375 x 0.0375m2. With a superficial gas velocity of 4.9mm/s, the inlet 
velocity normal to the inlet will be 0.0784m/s with a gas volume fraction 
of unity. The diameter of gas bubbles is set to 4mm as in the work by 
Deen (2001). 
 
Bove inlet 
Again the inlet boundary condition is modelled as a velocity inlet with 
8x8 cells, an inlet area of 0.0375 x 0.0375m2 and a superficial gas 
velocity of 4.9mm/s. The diameter of gas bubbles is set to 4mm. The 
inlet is modelled as a perforated plate. The porosity of the plate is:

Outlet and walls 
The outlet is modelled as a pressure outlet in Fluent 6.3, where the air 
backflow volume fraction is specified to be zero and the walls are 
modelled as no-slip boundaries for both phases. 
 

60 
CHAPTER 4  
4.2.2 Other settings 
The simulations are 1st order implicit transient in three dimensions. The 
time step size is set to 0.005s, and the simulation time is set to 200s with 
averaging done on the last 150s. Third order spatial discretisation 
schemes are employed (QUICK). This is done in order to compare with 
Deen’s results. A simulation was typically run on 3 AMD Athlon XP 1.4 
GHz nodes and took approximately 8 days. 
 
4.3 
Results 
In this section the results of the simulations will be presented. The results 
are compared with the experimental data from Deen (2001) and the 
simulations by Deen (2001). 
This section is divided into two parts. In the first part, the simulations 
with the Deen inlet conditions (αG,inlet = 1) are presented. In the second 
part the simulations with the Bove inlet (αG,inlet ≠ 1) are presented. 
 
4.3.1 Deen inlet condition 
The simulations with the Deen inlet condition are done in order to 
compare the results from Fluent 6.3 with the results from Deen (2001), 
who used CFX-4.3. Simulations with different interfacial forces settings 
and with or without BIT are run. All simulations are run with the drag 
model by Ishii & Zuber (1979) and the LES sub-grid approach proposed 
by Smagorinsky (1963).  
Interfacial forces 
In the work by Deen (2001) a plot of the different interfacial forces was 
presented. An exact replica of this can be seen in Figure 34.

liquid velocity for different interfacial forces, at a height of 
0.25m and a depth of 0.075m. D: drag force, L: lift force, 
VM: virtual mass force (from Deen, 2001). 
Evidently the lift force is an important interfacial force for capturing the 
liquid velocity profile.  
 
Drag force only 
A simulation with drag as the only interfacial force has been run in 
Fluent 6.3, and the result is shown in Figure 35.

CHAPTER 4  
 
Figure 35 Profiles of time averaged simulated and measured axial 
liquid velocity at a height of y = 0.25m and a depth of z = 
0.075m. Drag force is the only interfacial force employed. 
Experimental data is from Deen (2001). 
It is evident that the drag force alone is not able to capture the liquid 
velocity profile. The bubble plume is not fluctuating radially, when only 
using drag to describe the interfacial forces, as can be seen in Figure 36. 
In the following, the lift force is therefore always included in the 
simulations.

The highest magnitude of the signals corresponds to a frequency of 
0.0206 Hz or a period of 48.5 seconds. This period must be large scale 
fluctuations that cannot be determined from looking at Figure 39. 
Profiles of time averaged axial liquid velocity are shown in Figure 41 for 
the simulations in Table 5. Also the experimental PIV data and a 
simulation from Deen (2001) are included.

From Figure 41 it is evident that the core velocity is simulated 
satisfactorily with drag and lift force (CL = 0.5). Addition of virtual mass 
force and removal of BIT lowers the core velocity prediction. The 
addition of the Tomiyama lift coefficient results in a severe over 
prediction of the core velocity.  
Profiles of time averaged axial gas velocity are shown in Figure 42 for 
the simulations in Table 5. Also the experimental data and a simulation 
from Deen (2001) are included.

From Figure 42 it is evident that the core velocity is simulated 
satisfactorily with drag, lift force (CL = 0.5), virtual mass force and no 
BIT. All other cases over predict the core velocity. Again the addition of 
the Tomiyama lift coefficient results in a severe over prediction of the 
core velocity.

Figure 43 for the simulations in Table 5. Also the experimental data and

From Figure 43 it is observed that all the different cases capture the 
fluctuations satisfactorily except for case D-D+TL. 
Profiles of time averaged radial liquid velocity fluctuations are shown in 
Figure 44 for the simulations in Table 5. Also the experimental data and 
a simulation from Deen (2001) are included.

From Figure 44 it is observed that all cases show very good agreement 
with the experimental data. 
 
4.3.2 Bove inlet condition 
The simulations with the Bove inlet condition are run because of the need 
to use an inlet with αG,inlet ≠ 1 for the bubble size prediction simulations 
later in this thesis. The simulations will be compared with the results 
from Deen (2001). As in the latter chapter, simulations with different 
interfacial forces settings and with or without BIT are run. Again all 
simulations are run with the drag model by Ishii & Zuber (1979) and the 
LES sub-grid approach proposed by Smagorinsky (1963). 
In Table 6 the simulations with different interfacial forces are listed.

Figure 45 shows that case B-D+L is closest to the experimental data. The 
interesting thing here is however that added virtual mass force results in 
severe over prediction of the core velocity. This was exactly the opposite 
for the Deen inlet simulations, where added virtual mass force resulted in 
severe under prediction of the core velocity.

From Figure 46 it is evident that case B-D+L-BIT is predicting the gas 
velocity satisfactorily. All other cases over predict the core velocity quite 
severely. Again the added virtual mass force results in the most severe 
over prediction.  
Profiles of time averaged axial liquid velocity fluctuations are shown in

the radial liquid velocity fluctuations a bit. All other cases show excellent 
agreement with the experimental data. 
 
4.4 
Summary 
In this chapter the flow pattern in the bubble column has been modelled 
with different interfacial forces along with two different inlet boundary 
conditions.  
It has been shown that the flow pattern in the bubble column can be 
modelled satisfactorily with the distorted drag model by Ishii & Zuber 
(1979), LES sub-grid approach as proposed by Smagorinsky (1963), a 
constant lift force with CL = 0.5 and bubble induced turbulence (BIT) as 
proposed by Sato and Sekoguchi (1975). The added virtual mass force 
and especially the Tomiyama lift coefficient (Tomiyama, 2004) failed to 

FLOW SIMULATIONS 
 
75 
predict the flow pattern satisfactorily for both inlet boundary conditions, 
especially the core velocity was either severely under- or over predicted. 
In the work of Zhang (2007) the same problem with the Tomiyama lift 
coefficient was observed in the square bubble column. 
When looking ahead in this thesis, the results from the Deen inlet 
simulations are not that interesting, as the inlet boundary condition for 
the coming bubble size predictions demand that αG,inlet ≠ 1. The Deen 
inlet simulations were included in this thesis to show that it was possible 
to reproduce the simulations by Deen (2001) in Fluent 6.3. 
The Bove inlet simulations are however essential for the further work in 
this thesis, as they form a basis for the bubble size predictions in the next 
chapter. It has been shown in this chapter that the choice of interfacial 
forces and turbulence model is essential for correct prediction of the flow 
pattern in the bubble column.  
On the basis of the observations done in this chapter, it is concluded that 
case B-D+L-BIT should form the base case for bubble size predictions, 
as this case captures the axial gas velocity and the liquid fluctuations 
satisfactorily in the bubble column when comparing with the 
experimental data by Deen (2001).  
It should be noted that Zhang (2007) reported the following:  
“Recent Front Tracking results by Dijkhuizen et al. (2007) reveals that 
the lift coefficient also depends on the shear rate in the liquid phase, 
which may vary as a function of applied column geometry” 
This could explain why simulations the Tomiyama lift coefficient is not 
predicting the velocity profile satisfactorily. However a varying bubble 
size will probably have some effect on the flow pattern. The Tomiyama 
lift coefficient should therefore not be ignored as it is sensitive to bubble 
size. Also the viscosity will change with varying bubble diameter when 
employing BIT.

Numerical Simulations of Bubble 
Size in the Square Bubble Column 
with the IACE Model 
5.1 
Introduction 
In this chapter, numerical simulations of bubble size in the square bubble 
column are presented for three superficial gas velocities. The bubble size 
is calculated with the interfacial area concentration equation (IACE) 
presented in Chapter 3.4. Two different kernels for coalescence and 
breakup are used in the simulations, which gives a total of six different 
base case simulations. 
In the first part of this chapter the simulation settings for the six base case 
simulations are presented. 
In the second part of this chapter the results from two base case 
simulations with a superficial velocity of 4.9 mm/s are presented. The 
cases are set up with the recommendations from Chapter 4 and the two 
different IACE closure approaches presented in Chapter 3.4. 
In the third part of this chapter the results from the remaining four base 
case simulations are presented.  
In the last part of this chapter a parameter study on the six base cases are 
presented.  

78 
CHAPTER 5  
All simulations are compared with experimental IPI data, PIV data by 
Deen (2001) and interpolated PIV data from Chapter 2.6. 
 
5.2 
Simulation settings 
In this section the simulation settings for the six base case bubble size 
simulations on the square bubble column with the IACE model are 
presented.  
 
5.2.1 Grid and boundary conditions 
The grid used in the simulations is a 0.15m x 0.45m x 0.15m square 
volume meshed with hexahedral cells. The number of cells in the x-, y- 
and z-direction are 32, 45 and 32 respectively, which gives a total of 
46080 hexahedral cells. The geometry with and without mesh can be 
seen in Figure 33. 
 
Inlet 
The inlet of the bubble column is modelled as a velocity inlet with 8 x 8 
cells, an area of 0.0375 x 0.0375m2 at superficial gas velocities of 3.2, 
4.9 and 6.6mm/s like in the work of Bove (2005). αG is set to 0.0274. 
The initial diameter of the bubbles is to be determined. In an article by 
Bhavaraju (1978), a number of different calculation methods have been 
found. A relation by Davidson & Schuler (1960) suggests the following:

Where QG,o is the gas rate per orifice. With a superficial gas velocity of 
4.9mm/s, the gas rate per orifice becomes 2.25e-6m3/s, and dB is 3.9mm.

With a superficial gas velocity of 4.9 mm/s, the gas rate per orifice 
becomes 2.25e-6m3/s, ReL,o is 2853, Fro equals 516 and dB is 5.4mm. 
As the bubble column is designed with the purpose of yielding 4mm 
bubbles (Deen, 2001), it is chosen to set the inlet bubble size to 4mm in 
the base case simulations. 
 
Outlet and walls 
The outlet is modelled as a pressure outlet in Fluent 6.3, where the air 
backflow volume fraction is zero. The walls are modelled as no-slip 
boundaries for both phases. 
 
5.2.2 Turbulence modelling 
All simulations are run with the LES sub-grid approach proposed by 
Smagorinsky (1963). In Chapter 4.4 it was concluded that BIT should not 
be included when modelling the flow in the square bubble column. 
However since BIT will introduce a change in the contribution to the 
viscosity with varying bubble size, BIT should be tested. 

80 
CHAPTER 5  
5.2.3 Interface models 
In Chapter 4.4 it was concluded that case D_D+L-BIT was the better 
choice when modelling the flow in the square bubble column. Therefore 
the following interfacial forces are included in the base case: distorted 
bubble drag model by Ishii & Zuber (1979), constant lift (CL = 0.5) and 
no added virtual mass. It should be noted that since the lift coefficient 
proposed by Tomiyama (2004) will vary with varying bubble size it 
should be tested, as the lift coefficient has a great influence on the overall 
flow pattern. 
 
5.2.4 Bubble size prediction 
The simulations are run with two different models for coalescence and 
breakup. The kernel proposed by Wu et al. (1998) and the kernel 
proposed by Moilanen et al. (2008). Both are described in detail in 
Chapter 3.4. 
 
5.2.5 Other settings 
The simulations are 1st order implicit transient in three dimensions. The 
time step size is set to 0.0025s, and the simulation time is set to 200s 
with averaging done on the last 150s. The time step is halved compared 
to the flow simulations in Chapter 4 because of convergence problems 
with the IACE model. Third order spatial discretisation schemes are 
employed (QUICK). A typical simulation was run on 4 AMD Athlon XP 
1.4 GHz nodes and took approximately 12 days. 
 
5.3 
Base case simulation results with uG, sup 4.9 mm/s 
In this section the results from two of the six base case simulations are 
presented. The simulation settings, which are similar for both simulations 
are shown in Table 7.

5.3.1 Results with the Wu et al. IACE kernels 
Contour plots of instantaneous Sauter mean diameter, d32, are shown in 
Figure 49. It is observed that the Sauter mean diameter is observed to be 
very high in the lower third of the column just above the gas inlet.  
Contour plots of instantaneous gas volume fraction, αG, are shown in 
Figure 50. The contour plots of αG are very similar to the contour plots of 
d32 in Figure 49, which is to a certain degree expected as the bubble 
diameter is only dependant on αG and interfacial area.

Contours of instantaneous interfacial area, ai, are shown in Figure 51. 
Note the range of the scalar bar. It is observed that the change in ai is 
very small, which explains why the contour plots of d32 and αG are so 
similar. 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 51 Contour plots of instantaneous interfacial area in a z-plane 
where z = 0.075m at 10s intervals from 170s to 200s. 
The change in ai is due to coalescence and breakage. Contour plots of 
coalescence source terms, SRC and SWE, are shown in Figure 52 and 
contour plots of breakage source term, STI, and Weber number, We, are 
shown in Figure 53. It is observed that the coalescence source terms are 
quite small, which explains the small decrease in ai through the column. 
Furthermore it is observed that the breakage source term is zero in the 
plane of view. This is due to We being less than the critical Weber 
number, Wecr, of 6.0 in the plane of view.

averaged d32 are compared with the experimental IPI data.

CHAPTER 5  
 
Figure 55 Simulated and measured axial profiles of time averaged d32 
along the axial centreline. 
It is observed that the simulated time averaged d32 is decreasing with 
increasing column height, whereas the measured time averaged d32 is 
fairly constant. It is also noticed that the simulated time averaged d32 is 
smaller than the experimental value.

It is observed that the simulated time averaged d32 is decreasing toward 
the walls, a trend that is supported by the IPI measurements. Again the 
simulated time averaged d32 is smaller than the experimental average d32. 
In Figure 57 and Figure 58 velocity profiles of time averaged axial gas 
and average liquid velocity are shown.

velocity at a height of 0.25m and a depth of 0.075m.

It is observed that the velocity profiles are in good agreement with the 
experimental PIV data. This was expected as the lift constant is held 
constant and BIT is not employed.

profiles of velocity fluctuations are in good agreement with the 
experimental PIV data.

CHAPTER 5  
5.3.2 Results with the Moilanen et al. IACE kernels 
In Figure 61 contour plots of instantaneous Sauter mean diameter, d32, 
are shown. It is observed that d32 is very high not only above the gas inlet 
but also in the top half of the column when compared to the results with 
the Wu et al. closure approach.  
   
 
 
 
 
Figure 61 Contour plots of instantaneous d32 in a z-plane (z = 0.075m) 
at 10s intervals from 170s to 200s. 
In Figure 62 contour plots of instantaneous gas volume fraction, αG, are 
shown. As with the Wu et al. closure approach the contour plots of αG 
are quite similar to the contour plots of d32 in Figure 61. However when 
looking at contour plots of instantaneous interfacial area, ai, in Figure 63 
it is evident that the change in ai is much larger than with the Wu et al. 
closure approach. Note the range of the scalar bar.

CHAPTER 5  
Instantaneous contour plots of coalescence source term, SCO and 
breakage source term, SBR, are shown in Figure 64. It is observed that the 
coalescence is much higher (approximately a factor of 100) than when 
compared to the results with the Wu et al. closure approach. Also it is 
observed that breakage occur in a few small areas in the plane of view.

In Figure 65 contour plots of instantaneous Weber number are shown. In 
the right plot the areas which are not turquoise coloured represent a 
Weber number above 1.5, which is the threshold for breakage to occur. 
In Figure 66 contour plots of time averaged d32 and αG are shown. The 
plots are very similar, which is also expected.

CHAPTER 5  
The time averaged interfacial area and coalescence and breakage source 
terms are shown in Figure 67. It is observed that SCO is much larger than 
SBR and that significant breakage is only located just above the inlet in the 
bottom third of the bubble column.

In Figure 68 and Figure 69 simulated axial and radial profiles of time 
averaged d32 are shown and compared with experimental IPI data. It is 
observed that the simulated average axial d32 is decreasing with 
increasing column height until approximately 0.33m. From then on the 
d32 is more or less constant. It is also noticed that the simulated d32 fits 
the experimental d32 quite well except at the point y = 0.2 m. It is noticed 
that the simulated radial d32 is decreasing toward the walls. Although the 
simulated d32 is larger than the experimental value in x = 0.075m, the 
simulated values near the walls are more than 50% smaller than the 
experimental values.

latter section. 
In Figure 71 profiles of time averaged simulated axial liquid velocity are 
shown. Again, it is observed that the liquid velocity profile is in good 
agreement with the experimental PIV data.

Results with a superficial gas velocity of 3.2 mm/s 
In this section the results from the two base case simulations with a 
superficial gas velocity of 3.2 mm/s are presented and compared with 
experimental IPI data and interpolated PIV data from Chapter 2.6. 
 
5.4.1 Bubble size 
In Figure 74, both predictions of axial profiles of time-averaged d32 are 
compared with experimental IPI data. 
 
Figure 74 Axial profiles of simulated time averaged d32 versus 
experimental d32 along the axial centreline. 
It is observed that the time averaged d32 is decreasing with increasing 
column height until y = 0.3m, where the d32 becomes more or less 
constant. This trend was also observed with uG,sup 4.9 mm/s. It is also 
evident that the simulation with Wu et al. kernels predicts a too low 
average d32 when compared to the IPI data. The simulation with kernels 
by Moilanen et al. gives a better prediction of d32 even though it may be 
a bit low compared to the IPI data. 

100 
CHAPTER 5  
In Figure 75 both predictions of radial profiles of time averaged d32 are 
compared with experimental IPI data.  
 
Figure 75 Radial profiles of simulated time averaged d32 versus 
experimental d32 at a height of 0.25 and a depth of 0.075m. 
It is observed that both simulations yield too low average d32 values 
when compared with the IPI data, especially toward the walls. The 
simulation with Moilanen et al. kernels however does a better prediction 
of the average d32 than the simulation with Wu et al. kernels. 
 
5.4.2 Velocity 
Profiles of simulated time averaged axial gas velocity and axial liquid 
velocity are shown in Figure 76 and Figure 77 respectively. It is noticed 
that the simulations are in good agreement with the interpolated PIV data 
except for the prediction of axial gas velocity with kernels by Moilanen 
et al., where the core velocity is slightly over predicted. 
In Figure 78 and Figure 79 profiles of simulated time averaged axial and 
radial liquid fluctuations are shown respectively.

compared with experimental IPI data, and in Figure 81 radial profiles of 
time averaged d32 for both simulations are compared with experimental 
IPI data.

It is noticed that the simulated average d32 with the Wu et al. kernels is in 
good agreement with the experimental data. 
 
Figure 81 Radial profiles of simulated time averaged d32 versus

It is observed that the simulations again predict the maximum average d32 
in the core and a lower average d32 toward the walls as is the case for the 
IPI results. Both simulations are in somewhat agreement with the IPI 
data. 
 
5.5.2 Velocity 
Profiles of simulated time averaged axial gas velocity and axial liquid 
velocity are shown in Figure 82 and Figure 83 respectively for both base 
cases. The simulated profiles are compared with interpolated PIV data. It 
is observed that the simulation with the Moilanen et al. kernels is in 
better agreement with the axial gas and liquid velocity profiles.

simulations. The changes relative to the base cases are listed in Table 8.

It was observed in Chapter 4.3 that simulations with the Tomiyama lift 
coefficient from Eq. 14 predict a too high core velocity in the column. 
This is also the case for the IACE simulations, which can be seen in 
Figure 86.

Figure 86 Profile of simulated time averaged axial gas velocity versus

versus IPI data (left) at a height of 0.25m and a depth of 
0.075m. Superficial gas velocity 4.9 mm/s. IACE kernels by 
Wu et al (1998). 
It is observed that the simulated average radial d32 is severely over 
predicted in the middle of the column and severely under predicted 
toward the walls. This behaviour is observed in all the simulations. 
Therefore the simulations with the Tomiyama lift coefficient are not 
reported in this parameter study. 
In Chapter 4.4 it was chosen not to include BIT in the base case flow 
model. In Figure 87 it is shown what generally happens when including 
BIT in the simulations. 
The simulated time averaged d32 in the radial direction is severely over 
predicted in the core region of the bubble column. This results in an over 
prediction of the time averaged axial gas velocity in the core region. It 
was observed that the simulations with BIT showed an erratic behaviour, 
which resulted in random crashes. With a simulation time of 14 days per 
simulation it was not possible to gain usable results for this parameter 
study. The simulations with BIT are therefore not reported in this 
parameter study.

CHAPTER 5  
From the figures in this section it is observed that the velocity profiles for 
all cases are quite similar and in good agreement with experimental PIV 
data. The significant difference between the cases is seen in the 
prediction of average d32. Here the average d32 predicted by cases “Base 
case”, “VM” and “NGV” is quite similar, but when changing the inlet 
diameter the average d32 changes dramatically. The trend in both axial 
and radial direction in the column is however the same in all cases with 
different dB,inlet. 
 
5.6.2 Superficial gas velocity 3.2 mm/s 
In this section the parameter studies with a superficial velocity of 3.2 
mm/s are presented. 
Predictions of axial and radial profiles of time averaged d32 are compared 
with experimental IPI data in Figure 94 and Figure 95. 
Predictions of profiles of axial time averaged gas and liquid velocities are 
compared with interpolated PIV data in Figure 96 and Figure 97. 
Predictions of time averaged axial and radial liquid velocity fluctuations 
are compared with experimental PIV data in Figure 98 and Figure 99. 
From the figures in this section it is observed that the velocity profiles for 
all cases are quite similar and in good agreement with interpolated PIV 
data except for the “VM” case with the Moilanen et al. kernels, which is 
slightly over predicting the average axial gas and liquid core velocity, 
while slightly under predicting the average radial liquid fluctuations. The 
significant difference between the cases is again seen in the prediction of 
average d32. The average d32 predicted by cases “Base case”, “VM” and 
“NGV” is quite similar, although the average d32 in the core region is a 
little higher with the “VM” case. Again, when changing the inlet 
diameter the average d32 changes significantly. The trend in both axial 
and radial direction in the column is again the same in all cases with 
different dB,inlet.

Note that case “NGV” with kernels by Wu et al. is not reported due to 
convergence problems. Again, when changing the inlet diameter the 
average d32 changes significantly, but the trend in both axial and radial 
direction in the column is again the same in all cases with different 
dB,inlet.

CHAPTER 5  
5.7 
Summary 
In this chapter numerical simulations of bubble size in the square bubble 
column have been presented for three superficial gas velocities and two 
different sets of kernels for coalescence and breakup. 
 
Base case simulations with a superficial gas velocity 4.9 mm/s 
The results for two base case IACE simulations with a superficial 
velocity of 4.9 mm/s have been presented and compared with 
experimental IPI data and PIV data by Deen (2001).  
The simulation with kernels by Moilanen et al. (2008) performed better 
than the simulation with kernels by Wu et al. (1998) regarding the 
prediction of bubble size when compared to the experimental IPI data in 
the axial direction.  
In the radial direction both simulations are under predicting the time 
averaged d32 near the walls quite severely compared to the experimental 
data. It is observed visually during the experiments that the bubbles form 
a plume, which fluctuates from left to right quite randomly. In this plume 
the majority of the bubbles are present. This fluctuating behaviour and 
plume forming is also observed in the simulations. The averaging of 
simulated d32 is done for every time step in every cell of the 
computational domain. This is probably not a problem when averaging 
the simulated d32 along the axial centreline of the column as the bubble 
plume is located in the axial centreline or passing the axial centreline of 
the column most of the time. It is probably a significant problem when 
averaging d32 in the cells near the walls, as the bubble plume is present 
quite rarely near the walls compared to the axial centreline. Therefore it 
would be a good idea to introduce conditional averaging, where the 
averaging of d32 in a cell is only done, when a condition is satisfied. This 
condition could in this case be a volume fraction threshold, which would 
be the natural choice for determining when the bubble plume is present in 
a computational cell. 

IACE SQUARE BUBBLE COLUMN

The change in interfacial area was seen to be minimal for the simulation 
with the Wu et al. (1998) kernels, as the coalescence source terms and 
especially the breakup source term were very small compared to the 
simulation with the kernels by Moilanen et al. (2008). The breakup 
source term for the simulation with the Wu et al. (1998) kernel was 
observed to be zero in the plane of view due to low Weber numbers, 
which are used as a threshold for breakage to occur. The velocity profiles 
for both cases were in good agreement with the experimental PIV data by 
Deen (2001) as was expected since the lift coefficient was constant and 
bubble induced turbulence (BIT) was not employed. 
 
Simulations with superficial gas velocity of 3.2 and 6.6 mm/s 
The results from the remaining four base cases with superficial gas 
velocities of 3.2 m/s and 6.6 m/s have been presented and compared with 
experimental IPI data and interpolated PIV data from Deen (2001). It was 
observed that the simulated time averaged d32 is very sensitive to 
superficial gas velocity. The simulated average d32 was increasing with 
increasing superficial velocity as can be seen from Figure 106. 
 
Figure 106 Profiles of simulated time averaged axial d32 for different 
superficial gas velocities with the Wu et al. kernel (left) and 
the Moilanen et al. kernel (right) in the axial centreline.  
This trend was not observed in the experimental IPI data, where the 
bubble diameter seemed constant.  

132 
CHAPTER 5  
It was also observed that the velocity profiles for all four remaining base 
cases were in good agreement with the interpolated PIV data from Deen 
(2001). 
 
Parameter study 
A parameter study on the six base cases has been presented and 
compared with experimental IPI data and PIV data by Deen (2001).  
It was observed that the introduction of a varying lift coefficient 
(Tomiyama, 2004) did not yield good results both regarding simulated 
average d32 and velocity profiles. The simulated average d32 along the 
axial centreline and the simulated average axial velocity in the core 
region were severely over predicted. It was quite surprising that the 
introduction of the varying lift coefficient would result in such a poor 
prediction, since the varying lift coefficient introduces a physically 
correct behaviour in the sense that small bubbles migrate toward the 
walls and larger bubbles migrate toward the centre or core of the column 
as was observed by Tomiyama (2004). The failure is probably due to the 
high values of d32 observed in the bottom of the column just above the 
inlet. The lift coefficient in this region is negative, which means that the 
simulated bubbles in that region migrate toward the centre of the column 
and introduce a high axial gas velocity in the core region. The IACE 
kernels especially the breakup kernels are probably not tuned for 
handling this region with high values of d32 just above the inlet and a jet-
like flow in the middle of the column occurs.  
It was also observed that bubble induced turbulence (BIT) introduced an 
over prediction of the core velocity and core d32 in most of the 
simulations. In other cases the simulations grew unstable because of 
added BIT and crashed randomly. The simulations with BIT were 
therefore not reported in the parameter study. 
The parameter study revealed that predictions of average d32 from the 
simulations with added virtual mass (VM) or laminar gas viscosity 
(NGV) were very similar to the predictions with the base case 
simulations.  

IACE SQUARE BUBBLE COLUMN 
 
133 
A significant change in the simulated average d32 is however observed 
when changing the inlet bubble diameter. The inlet bubble diameter was 
set to 2mm, 4mm (base case), 6mm or 8mm. It was observed that the 
trend of the d32 line plots both axially and radially was similar for all 
simulations with different inlet diameter for all three superficial gas 
velocities. However the steepness of the curves was growing with 
increasing inlet diameter axially and toward the walls radially. It is 
noticed that the difference in average d32 in the middle of the column at a 
height of 0.25m is almost the same as in the inlet for all superficial gas 
velocities. 
The simulated velocity profiles from all cases in the parameter study 
were in good agreement with experimental PIV data by Deen (2001) and 
interpolated PIV data. Especially the simulated axial and liquid velocity 
fluctuations were in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Also 
the simulated axial liquid velocity was in good agreement with the 
experimental data. However the simulated axial gas velocity was slightly 
over predicted by almost every case in the parameter study.  
It is noticed that the velocity profiles from the cases with different inlet 
bubble diameter are not the same. This is a bit strange, as the flow field 
should be completely decoupled from the bubble size, since varying lift 
force and BIT is not included.

Numerical Simulations of Bubble 
Size in a Pseudo-2D Bubble 
Column with the IACE Model 
6.1 
Introduction 
In this chapter additional bubble size simulations on a flat pseudo 2D 
bubble column with the IACE model are compared with experimental 
data by van den Hengel (2004). 
 
6.2 
Simulation settings 
In this section the simulation settings for the bubble size simulations on 
the pseudo 2D bubble column with the IACE model are presented.  
 
6.2.1 Grid and boundary conditions 
The grid used in the simulations is a 0.20m x 1.40m x 0.03m square 
volume meshed with hexahedral cells. The number of cells in the x-, y- 
and z-direction are 40, 140 and 8 respectively, which gives a total of 
44800 hexahedral cells. The geometry with and without mesh can be 
seen in Figure 107. 

136 
CHAPTER 6  
                 
 
Figure 107 Sketch of the pseudo 2D column with and without mesh. 
 
Inlet 
The inlet of the bubble column is modelled as a velocity inlet with 4x4 
cells, an area of 0.02 x 0.015m2 and a superficial gas velocity of 
5.56mm/s. The porosity of the distributor is set to 50%, which gives an 
inlet velocity of 0.22m/s. The diameter of the initial bubbles is set to 
2mm as in the work by Bove (2005). 
 
Outlet and walls 
The outlet is modelled as a pressure outlet in Fluent 6.3, where the air 
backflow volume fraction is specified to be zero. The walls are modelled 
as no-slip boundaries for both phases. 

IACE PSEUDO-2D COLUMN 
 
137 
6.2.2 Turbulence modelling 
The simulations are run with the LES sub-grid approach proposed by 
Smagorinsky (1963). Bubble induced turbulence is not employed. 
 
6.2.3 Interface models 
The following interfacial forces are employed: distorted bubble drag 
model by Ishii & Zuber (1979), constant lift (CL = 0.5) or varying lift 
coefficient proposed by Tomiyama (2004). Added virtual mass is not 
employed. 
 
6.2.4 Bubble size prediction 
The simulations are run with the two different models for coalescence 
and breakup described in Chapter 3.4.  
 
6.2.5 Conditional averaging 
In Chapter 5 it was concluded that it would be a good idea to introduce 
conditional averaging in the simulations because of the fluctuating 
movement of the bubble plume. It was proposed that the averaging 
should be dependent on the volume fraction, since this would be a good 
measure of the presence of a bubble plume. An initial simulation was 
run, and the time history of αG at a height of 0.5m can be seen in Figure 
108.

CHAPTER 6  
 
Figure 108 Time series of simulated gas volume fraction at the axial 
centreline at the height of 0.5m. The simulation is run with 
constant lift (CL = 0.5), dB,inlet = 2mm and kernels for the 
IACE model by Moilanen et al. (2008). 
It is observed that the highest gas volume fraction peaks are 
approximately in the range 4% to 7% and the majority of peaks are 
approximately in the range 1.5% to 3%. The simulated average gas 
volume fraction is predicted to be 0.85%. In Figure 109 a look at the last 
20 seconds from Figure 108 is shown. Note the scale on the y-axis. 
It is observed that the low local minima of the gas volume fraction range 
from close to zero to approximately 0.4%. 
From these observations it is chosen to set the threshold of αG to 0.5%. 
This means that averaging of d32 is only done when αG > 0.5%. This 
threshold is approximately one tenth of the maximum αG values observed 
at the sampling location.

6.2.6 Other settings 
The simulations are 1st order implicit transient in three dimensions. The 
time step size is set to 0.0025s, and the simulation time is set to 200s 
with (conditional) averaging done on the last 150s exactly as for the 
IACE simulations on the square bubble column. Third order spatial 
discretisation schemes are employed (QUICK). A typical simulation was 
run on 4 AMD Athlon XP 1.4 GHz nodes and took approximately 14 
days. 
 
6.3 
Results 
In this section the results from the IACE simulations on the pseudo 2D 
column are presented and compared with the experimental shadow 
imaging data by van den Hengel (2004). Since van den Hengel (2004) 

140 
CHAPTER 6  
only measured the bubble size, no velocity data is available only bubble 
size data.  
 
6.3.1 Simulation with Wu et al. kernels 
In Figure 110 the simulated conditional time averaged d32 is compared 
with experimental data by van den Hengel (2004) along the axial 
centreline. 
 
Figure 110 Axial profiles of simulated conditional time averaged d32 
versus experimental data by van den Hengel (2004) along the 
axial centreline of the column. The Wu et al. kernels are 
employed. 
It is observed that the simulated conditional time averaged d32 along the 
axial centreline is decreasing rapidly within the first 15cm above the 
inlet. Through the remaining part of the column the simulated average d32 
is more or less steady at 0.1mm. The simulated average d32 does not fit 
the experimental data at all.

Figure 111 Plots of simulated average d32 versus experimental data by 
van den Hengel (2004) in the axial centreline of the column. 
The Moilanen et al. kernels are employed. 
It is observed that none of the simulations are in excellent agreement 
with the experimental data. The simulated average d32 is lower than the 

142 
CHAPTER 6  
experimental data for all simulations in the lower half of the column 
except for case BIT+TL. In the upper half of the column the simulations 
with the Tomiyama lift coefficient predict a higher average d32 than the 
experimental values.  
It is noticed that the simulated profiles of d32 with constant lift have the 
same slope as the experimental data in the upper part of the column. This 
is not the case for the simulations with the Tomiyama lift coefficient.  
When employing BIT the trend of the curves changes quite dramatically. 
The case BIT+TL is the only case that shows an increasing average d32 
up through the column. The trend of the experimental data also seems to 
be captured with BIT+TL. Case BIT+TL seems to be in better agreement 
with the experimental data. 
Contour plots of conditional time averaged d32, αG, ai and uG,axial are 
shown for the cases “CL” and “TL” in Figure 112. It is observed that the 
flow is almost channelling for the case “TL”, and more spread toward the 
walls for the case “CL”. This is probably due to the magnitude of the lift 
coefficient in the two cases.

144 
CHAPTER 6  
Even though the flow is almost channelling for the case “TL”, the 
conditional time averaged d32 in the radial direction is not decreasing as 
expected when the Tomiyama lift coefficient is applied. It is observed 
from Figure 113 that the instantaneous d32 for case “TL” is seldom above 
4.4mm, which is the approximate threshold, where the Tomiyama lift 
coefficient decreases from a constant value of 0.29 towards zero and 
further on toward a negative value for d32 > 5.8mm (Figure 32). 
 
Figure 113 Time series of simulated d32 for case “TL” in the axial 
centreline at a height of 0.5m. 
Since the instantaneous d32 is below 5.8mm most of the time, the lift 
force is positive, and all the bubbles are sent toward the walls. 
 
Effect of conditional averaging 
The effect of conditional averaging is shown in Figure 114. It is observed 
that the difference in d32 along the axial centreline is rather small when 
changing the threshold for conditional averaging. In the radial direction 
the difference is much more significant toward the walls.

Summary 
In this chapter the IACE model with kernels by Wu et al. and Moilanen 
et al. has been employed to simulate the bubble size distribution in a flat 
pseudo 2D column. The results have been compared to the experimental 
data by van den Hengel (2004). 
The simulations with the Wu et al. kernels under predicted the 
conditional time averaged d32 severely and the trend of the experimental 
data along the axial centreline was not captured. It was observed that d32 
was decreasing along the axial centreline with increasing height. The 
experimental data show the exact opposite. 
The simulations with the Moilanen et al. kernels under predicted the 
conditional time averaged d32 except for the simulation with BIT and 
Tomiyama lift, which over predicted d32. It was observed that the trend of 
the experimental data along the axial centreline from a height of 0.5m 
and upwards was captured when employing a constant lift force of 0.5. 
When employing a varying lift force as proposed by Tomiyama (2004) 
without BIT, the increase in d32 was very steep compared to the 
experimental data. The simulation with BIT and Tomiyama lift showed 
an increasing average d32 along the axial centreline, and the slope of the 

146 
CHAPTER 6  
curve matched the slope of the experimental data. This case showed the 
better agreement with the experimental data. 
The effect of conditional averaging was examined with respect to 
simulated average d32, and the effect is highest in the radial direction 
toward the walls as expected. 
The flow in the column was observed to spread toward the walls when 
employing a constant lift coefficient of 0.5. When using the lift 
coefficient proposed by Tomiyama (2004) the flow was observed to be 
almost channelling along the axial centreline. This was concluded to be 
due to the difference in magnitude between the two lift coefficients and 
not because of the ability of the Tomiyama lift coefficient to become 
negative, which results in migration of the large bubbles toward the 
middle of the column.

Conclusions and Future Work 
In this thesis the bubble size distribution (BSD) in a square bubble 
column has been measured with Interferometric Particle Imaging and 
Particle 
Tracking 
Velocimetry 
(IPI/PTV). 
Computational 
Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) has been employed to model the flow and bubble size 
in the square bubble column and a flat pseudo-2D bubble column. 
 
7.1 
Experiments 
From the experimental IPI results on the square bubble column it was 
found that the bubble Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) was approximately 
6.0mm in the field of view. This was supported by visual observations. 
The SMD seems to be constant in the axial direction, whereas the bubble 
diameter profiles in the radial direction show that the SMD is smaller 
near the walls when compared to the SMD at the axial centreline. This 
was also expected as large bubbles migrate toward the middle or core 
region of the bubble column and smaller bubbles migrate toward the 
wall, which is in accordance with experimental observations. The SMD 
seems to be decreasing with increasing superficial gas velocity when 
looking at both axial and radial diameter profiles. 
The experimental PTV results were not in good agreement when 
compared to experimental Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) data from 
Deen (2001). The core velocity was too low and the velocity toward the 
walls was a bit too high. It is believed that this was due to a too large 

148 
CHAPTER 7  
time between bursts, which is essential for the quality of the PTV data. 
Furthermore a mirroring effect was observed at two distinct locations in 
the field of view, which distorted the data, so that the data was unusable 
in the vicinity of those locations.  
 
7.2 
Flow modelling 
The flow pattern in the square bubble was simulated with Fluent 6.3 and 
compared with experimental PIV data by Deen (2001). The diameter of 
the dispersed phase was kept at a constant value of 4mm. 
Excellent agreement with experimental data were obtained by employing 
the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) sub-grid approach as proposed by 
Smagorinsky (1963), the distorted drag model by Ishii & Zuber (1979) 
and a constant lift force with CL = 0.5. It was concluded in Chapter 4.4 
that Bubble Induced Turbulence (BIT) and bubble size dependent lift 
force should not be used when simulating the flow pattern in the bubble 
column with a constant diameter of the dispersed phase. 
 
7.3 
Bubble size modelling 
The mean bubble size in the square bubble column was modelled with an 
Interfacial Area Concentration Equation (IACE) approach and compared 
with experimental IPI data. Kernels by Wu et al. (1998) and Moilanen et 
al. (2008) were employed to account for coalescence and breakage.  
It was observed with a superficial gas velocity of 4.9 mm/s that the 
simulation with kernels by Moilanen et al. (2008) performed better than 
the simulation with kernels by Wu et al. (1998) regarding the prediction 
of bubble size in the axial direction when compared to the experimental 
IPI data. In the radial direction both simulations are under predicting the 
time averaged SMD, d32, near the walls quite severely compared to the 
experimental data. It is believed that by introducing conditional 
averaging with a volume fraction threshold this under prediction can me 
minimized or even eliminated.  

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
149 
The simulated time averaged d32 was observed to be increasing with 
superficial gas velocity. This trend was however not seen in the 
experimental IPI data, where the bubble size seemed constant or even 
slightly decreasing with increasing superficial velocity. 
Through a parameter study it was observed that introduction of a bubble 
size dependent lift force and bubble induced turbulence did not yield 
good results as the bubble diameter was severely over predicted along the 
axial centreline of the bubble column. Also it was seen that the inlet 
bubble diameter has a significant influence on the time averaged d32. 
The mean bubble size in the flat pseudo 2D bubble column was modelled 
and compared with experimental data by van den Hengel (2004). Kernels 
by Wu et al. (1998) and Moilanen et al. (2008) were employed in the 
IACE model. 
The kernels by Wu et al. under predicted the SMD in the column when 
compared to the experimental data and the trend of the axial SMD was 
not captured. The Moilanen et al. kernels did a better prediction of the 
axial SMD, but none of the simulations were in excellent agreement with 
the experimental data. It was observed in Chapter 6.3 that when 
employing BIT and a bubble size dependent lift force, the trend of the 
experimental data was captured. 
The two different kernels used for predicting bubble size were not 
specifically developed for bubble columns. The kernels by Wu et al. 
(1998) were developed for one dimensional area-averaged vertical 
bubbly pipe flow for nuclear engineering and the kernels by Moilanen et 
al. (2008) were developed for stirred tanks. Even though the kernels, 
especially the Moilanen et al. (2008) kernel, in some cases show good 
agreement with experimental data, it is also seen that when including 
physically correct effects such as a bubble size dependent lift force or 
bubble induced turbulence, the kernels fail to predict the mean bubble 
size satisfactorily. 
The lift force is essential for correct modelling of flow pattern in bubble 
columns, as this interfacial force is the main driving force in achieving a 
fluctuating behaviour of the bubble plume. Since the IACE model only 
yields one single bubble size in every cell of the computational domain, 

150 
CHAPTER 7  
the effect of the bubble size dependent lift force is diminished, which 
could explain why the jet-like flow in the core region of the bubble 
column occur. Bove (2005) clearly showed with three bubble size classes 
that the smaller bubbles were located near the walls and the larger 
bubbles were confined to the core region of the bubble column. 
 
7.4 
Future work 
On the basis of the conclusions drawn, some future work considerations 
are presented in the following. 
 
Experimental work 
The time between bursts should be optimized by repeating the 
experiment, so that the PTV data could be compared with experimental 
PIV data by Deen (2001). 
A different approach to measuring the bubble size in the square bubble 
column could also be employed. The shadow imaging technique used by 
van den Hengel (2004) would be an obvious choice, since the technique 
is quite simple. This would allow for comparison of BSD from the two 
different techniques.  
 
Computational work 
Bove et al. (2004) showed that the discretisation of the momentum 
equations and volume fraction equations is essential for correct 
prediction of the flow field. A fluctuating bubble plume using 2nd order 
flux corrected central differencing was obtained without employing lift 
force. In this work the lift force was essential for obtaining bubble plume 
fluctuations using third order discretisation (QUICK). It would therefore 
be interesting to conduct a study on the discretisation schemes. 

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
151 
In the present work the kernels for the IACE model were not 
manipulated. Even though the IACE modelling approach might not be 
suitable for bubble columns it should be investigated what effect a simple 
tuning or modification of kernels would have on the simulation results. It 
would also be interesting to search and implement different kernels for 
coalescence and breakage into the IACE model. 
Instead of using the two-phase IACE approach for modelling bubble size 
in bubble columns, it would be interesting to use multiphase approaches 
as the Quadrature Method Of Moments (QMOM), the Direct Quadrature 
Method Of Moments (DQMOM) or the method of Parallel Parent and 
Daughter Class (PPDC). In these approaches the dispersed phase is 
usually divided into two to four separate phases, each having its own 
diameter size and velocity field. This would probably increase the 
accuracy of the bubble size and flow field predictions, but the 
computational cost will also increase quite dramatically.
