Quantum Numbers
Klaus Hentschel
Within the context of the  atomic model by Niels Bohr (1885–1962), observ-
able spectrum lines of frequency ν are described as  quantum jumps of bound
 electrons between quantized energy levels En according to the rule: νnm =
(En −Em)/h, with h = a quantum of action,  Planck’s constant. With the
small correction for the so-called reduced mass, the energy En of each electron
orbit around the atomic core is given as:
En = 2π2e4mM
h2(m + M) · 1
n2
m = the mass of the electron; M = the mass of the atomic core; n is the ﬁrst (or
“main” quantum number) mainly determining the energy level of each electron,
aside from small corrections mostly relevant to precision  spectroscopy and de-
scribed by other subsequently introduced quantum numbers.
As the analogy between the planetary orbits around a massive sun and electron
orbits around the positively charged nucleus already implies, these electron orbits
would generally not be circles but ellipses. However, within the framework of classi-
cal mechanics, all ellipses generated from the circle by adiabatic transformations are
energetically equivalent to the circle, so Bohr initially thought that other orbit forms
would be reducible to simple circular orbits. But Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951),
a theoretical physicist trained as a mathematician and familiar with Einstein’s the-
ory of relativity, noted that electrons on highly eccentric orbits increase speed when
approaching the nucleus. Relativistically, this leads to a slight increase in their mass
and thus to a slight drop in energy of the respective orbit against a circular orbit.

In order to describe this, Sommerfeld introduced another azimuthal quantum
number l (sometimes also called k or nϕ), describing the degree of eccentricity of the
