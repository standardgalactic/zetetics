Violation of Bell inequalities through the coincidence-time loophole

Physics Department, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.†
The coincidence-time loophole was identiﬁed by Larsson & Gill (Europhys. Lett. 67, 707 (2004));
a concrete model that exploits this loophole has recently been described by De Raedt et al. (Found.
Phys., to appear). It is emphasized here that De Raedt et al.’s model is experimentally testable.
De Raedt et al.’s model also introduces contextuality in a novel and classically more natural way
than the use of contextual particle properties, by introducing a probabilistic model of a limited set
of degrees of freedom of the measurement apparatus, so that it can also be seen as a random ﬁeld
model. Even though De Raedt et al.’s model may well contradict detailed Physics, it nonetheless
provides a way to simulate the logical operation of elements of a quantum computer, and may
provide a way forward for more detailed random ﬁeld models.

De Raedt et al.[1, 2, 3] (hereinafter RRMKM) con-
struct a computer model that violates Bell-type inequal-
ities, which can be used to simulate elements of a quan-
tum computer at an event by event level. Although the
RRMKM model can be understood as a computing sim-
ulation, not as a Physics model, it is a local model that
can be said to exploit the “coincidence-time” loophole[4],
which was identiﬁed by Larsson and Gill as “signiﬁ-
cantly more damaging than the well-studied detection
problem”[5]. The RRMKM model is more concrete and
less general than the models discussed in [5]. Such mod-
els would be of little interest to most Physicists were it
not for the fact that the RRMKM model, if it is consid-
ered as a Physics model, is experimentally testable, and
is a prototype for more detailed random ﬁeld models.
The coincidence of events is part of the conventional
deﬁnition of 2-particle states in quantum mechanics:
if we observe two events at time-like separation, they
may or may not be caused by the same particle; if we
observe two events at space-like separation, they can-
not be caused by a single particle, there must be a 2-
particle state (or a 3-particle state, ...). For an archety-
pal experiment that measures a 2-particle state, we may
turn to Weihs et al.’s measurement of a violation of
Bell inequalities[6]. In this experiment, two computers
recorded the times at which events occurred at each of
the two ends of the experiment, then the two datasets
were compared (on a third computer, although this is
logically inessential) to determine when there were ap-

proximately matched events, “Coincidences were identi-
ﬁed by calculating time diﬀerences between Alice’s and
Bob’s time tags and comparing these with a time window
(typically a few ns)”[6, p 5041]. The storage of two sepa-
rate datasets followed by subsequent analysis is logically
equivalent to a hardware coincidence circuit, but very
usefully allows the retrospective analysis of the coinci-
dences we would have observed if we had used diﬀerent
hardware coincidence circuits.
The RRMKM model can be understood on two lev-
els: as a computer simulation of individual events; and
as a probabilistic model that captures the properties of
the simulation. The empirical adequacy of an event by
event simulation model is established by comparison of
statistics of the computer generated events with statis-
tics of experiments, no reference to a probabilistic model
is necessary, so a simulation approach to Physics is not
necessarily parasitic on a probabilistic approach, but the
presentation of computer simulations is not yet, to this
author, transparent as Physics. Here, only the proba-
bilistic approach will be discussed, because it is more
appropriate as a conventional Physics model.
In brief, the RRMKM model understood in a prob-
abilistic way depends on a probability density of the
time at which a single event is observed, p(t|a.S), hav-
ing a non-trivial dependence on the polarization of a light
source[3, §6]. In quantum theory, a rotationally invariant
2-photon quantum state (which we will say — unrealis-
tically, but for the sake of simplicity — has already been
determined not to require helical polarization in its de-

2
scription) is a mixture of a pure state,
ρp = ψpψ†
p, ψp =
1
√
2 (|HS⟩1 |VS⟩2 −|VS⟩1 |HS⟩2) ,
(1)
which is invariant under rotation of the polarization vec-
tor S, and a rotationally invariant mixed state,
ρm = 1
2π
Z
dS |HS⟩1 |VS⟩2 ⟨VS|2 ⟨HS|1 .
(2)
Characterization of an optical source requires us to deter-
mine a range of such mixtures that model the source to
a chosen empirical accuracy. A dependence of p(t|a.S)
on the polarization of the light source, if observed, re-
duces our ability to limit the range of such states that
are empirically adequate. One conclusion of this letter is
therefore that the description of any experiment that de-
pends on coincidences of events for diﬀerent polarizations
should include a characterization of the dependence of
detector delay on diﬀerent polarizations, because future
experimentalists will have to reproduce that dependence
to obtain the same results.
The RRMKM model understood in a probabilistic way
works by constructing a familiar separable hidden vari-
able model in terms of polarization vectors S1 and S2,
p(x1, x2, t1, t2|a1, a2) =
1
4π2
ZZ
dS1dS2p(x1|a1.S1)p(t1|a1.S1)p(x2|a2.S2)p(t2|a2.S2)p(S1, S2),
(3)
where x1, x2 ∈{−1, +1}, depending on which detector triggers behind a polarizing ﬁlter aligned at angles a1, a2,
respectively, at the two ends of the experiment. To model coincidence as it is described in the Weihs et al. experiment,
we suppose that |t2 −t1| must be less than a length of time W, and integrate over all time, to obtain
p(x1, x2|a1, a2) =
ZZ
dS1dS2p(x1|a1.S1)p(x2|a2.S2)w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W)p(S1, S2)
ZZ
dS1dS2w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W)p(S1, S2)
,
(4)
where the weight function w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W) is
w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W) =
ZZ
dt1dt2p(t1|a1.S1)p(t2|a2.S2)Θ(W −|t2 −t1|)
(5)
= 2W
Z
dtp(t|a1.S1)p(t|a2.S2) + O(W 2).
(6)
Eq. (5) is an integral on a line of width W
√
2, centered
on t1 = t2, leading to Eq. (6) when W is small. With an
appropriate choice of p(t|a.S), p(x1, x2|a1, a2) is not sep-
arable and may violate Bell inequalities[3, §6], so a local
model can be constructed that reproduces the logical op-
eration of a quantum computer (the logical operation of
a quantum computer being independent of the detailed
Physics, the usefulness of this approach will to some ex-
tent survive if further experiment invalidates them as
Physics models).
In particular, [3, §6] uses a pseudo-
random model for the polarizer that reproduces Malus
law, for which
p(x|a.S) = 1 −x
2
+ x(a.S)2 = 1
2(1 + x cos 2ζ),
(7)
where cos ζ = a.S, introduces a uniform distribution
ansatz,
p(t|a.S) = Θ(t)Θ(T (a.S) −t)
T (a.S)
,
where T (a.S) = T0

4(a.S)2(1 −(a.S)2)
d/2
= T0 |sin 2ζ|d ,
(8)
and chooses p(S1, S2) so that S1 and S2 are orthogo-
nal, to construct a model that matches the predictions of
quantum theory for the pure rotationally invariant state
of Eq. (1) when d = 4 and W ≪T0 is small. When d = 0
or W > T0 is large, the model satisﬁes Bell inequalities.
The uniform distribution ansatz of this model is inessen-
tial to the violation of Bell inequalities, and the weight

3
function w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W) does not determine p(t|a.S),
so there is an inﬁnite class of functions that violate Bell
inequalities.
The RRMKM model is experimentally testable, pro-
vided we assume that after passing through a polar-
ization ﬁlter the unobservable polarization vector S is
aligned with the polarization ﬁlter (this assumption is
required in conjunction with Eq.(7) to reproduce Malus
law; the simplest quantum mechanical modeling of polar-
ization ﬁlters is, comparably, as a projection of the state
to the same alignment as the polarization ﬁlter).
We
can measure the delay dependency function p(t|a.S) for
a given detector by directing a source of known polariza-
tion through a brieﬂy open gate and observing whether
there are timing diﬀerences for diﬀerent relative orienta-
tions. Then we can compute the resulting weight func-
tion, w(a1.S1, a2.S2, W), which establishes how much vi-
olation of the Bell inequality can be accounted for by
detection delay. It is plausible from the classical optics
of crystals that there will be such timing dependencies[7,
§14.3.2,§14.4.1], but the extent of the timing dependen-
cies required is considerable, since the violation of the
Bell inequalities in Weihs et al.’s experiment only dimin-
ishes to zero as W is increased beyond 300ns[3, Fig. 3],
corresponding to an eﬀective path length diﬀerence of
100m. If the whole violation of the Bell inequalities by
an experiment can be accounted for by the delay depen-
dency of the detectors used, then there is a sense in which
we have so far failed to characterize the state of the light
source as deﬁnitely ρp, deﬁnitely ρm, or as one of the
continuum of intermediate mixtures. Provided we consis-
tently use detectors that have the same delay dependency
and we use the same procedure to determine event coinci-
dences, however, we can continue to use ρp to describe a
light source (supposing that the measurement results —
on the (false) assumption that we are using detectors for
which p(t|a.S) is independent of a.S — support ρp as a
model), but if we use diﬀerent detectors or diﬀerent event
coincidence criteria we must reassess the empirical eﬀec-
tiveness of ρp. If ρm successfully models an experiment
when detectors are modelled accurately, this of course
does not mean that an experiment is classical.
If detectors generally prove to have nontrivial depen-
dencies of p(t|a.S) on a.S, we can retain a relatively
straightforward conceptual position by insisting that an
ideal quantum detector has no such dependency. This is
a reasonable position to adopt even if all detectors have
nontrivial dependencies on a.S, provided it can be proven
that there is no limit to the reduction of such dependen-
cies. Dependence of p(t|a.S) on a.S in both the detec-
tors is an engineered nonlocal correlation between the
measurement apparatuses, because the detectors have
the same internal structure. Together with the nonlo-
cally deﬁned determination of coincidence of events at
space-like separation, this nonlocal correlation is enough
to introduce a nondynamical nonlocality into this clas-
sical model.
Seen in this way, the construction of the
experimental apparatus is an example of what is pejora-
tively termed “conspiracy”.
Modeling the dependence of p(t|a.S) on a.S eﬀectively
introduces a small, critical part of the experimental ap-
paratus into the experimental model, so we should also
understand the model to be “contextual”. The contextu-
ality of the RRMKM model accommodates the Fine and
Accardi discussion of Bell inequalities[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
without, however, introducing contextual particle prop-
erties, which are rightly anathema to classical particle
physics. Noting that the discussion of classical models
for quantum mechanical systems has always stalled on
whether the necessary modiﬁcations of classical physics
are natural rather than whether they are possible, the
RRMKM model moves classical models one more step to-
wards naturalness. Details of the experimental apparatus
have a subtle impact on how we model the experiment,
making it increasingly diﬃcult to understand the experi-
ment as a “measurement” of “the system we are measur-
ing”. As we consider experiments in progressively more
detail, we are forced to introduce more details of the ex-
perimental apparatus, so we cannot conﬁne our quantum
models to small numbers of electrons and photons, with
the experimental apparatus represented only by a mea-
surement operator. In eﬀect, as we include more of the
experimental apparatus, and increasingly ﬁner details,
we move the Heisenberg cut outwards into the world,
making our experiments more and more capable of be-
ing modeled by classical random ﬁeld methods[14, 15].
The signiﬁcance of the RRMKM model is that it moves
a small characteristic property of the measurement ap-
paratus into our detailed discussion of the measurement,
without requiring a perfect description of the whole mea-

4
surement device. Thanks to the arguments in [14], we
know that if we move enough of the measurement appa-
ratus into a model for an experiment, a classical model
can violate Bell inequalities. Even if the RRMKM model
is ruled out by measurement of p(t|a.S), nonetheless it
gives a novel way to introduce contextuality into classical
models, in a classically acceptable way, without introduc-
ing contextual particle properties.
Note that the above discussion is not aﬀected by the
critique of Hess and Philipp’s discussion[16, 17] by Gill
et al.[18, 19]. Here, timings and coincidences of events
are explicitly at issue in a diﬀerent way than highlighted
in those papers, as noted by Larsson and Gill[5].
Quantum mechanics is not under threat as an engi-
neering discipline — it is much too useful to separate
the world into “the measurement apparatus” and “the
system that is measured”; into “the measurement ap-
paratus” and “the preparation apparatus”; or even into
“the Universe” and “ideal quantum measurement”; all of
which allow the mathematical tools of quantum theoret-
ical measurement operators and Hilbert spaces of states
to be used. This splitting of the world into two parts
seems to be always possible For All Practical Purposes,
but the choice is always pragmatic. This is of course the
arbitrariness of the Heisenberg cut: the way in which we
split the world into two parts is not a perfect truth about
the world. This is a fundamental limitation of the math-
ematical tools of quantum theory. The immediate alter-
native, however, a classical holistic model that explicitly
models quantum ﬂuctuations[14, 15], is no better, since
there cannot be a model of the whole universe: there is al-
ways a separation of the world into what is in the model
and what is not in the model, so classical modeling is
equally pragmatic. I therefore make no claims that we
should construct classical models, but, pragmatically, it
might sometimes be useful to do so, and we can better un-
derstand quantum (ﬁeld) theory by better understanding
the relationship between quantum and classical models.
In particular, as quantum theoretical models increasingly
introduce more details of the measurement apparatus, in
a constant pursuit of more accuracy, contextual classical
models will increasingly become alternatives of compara-
ble complexity.
