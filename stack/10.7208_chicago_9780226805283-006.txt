CHAPTER 4
Loss of Planetary Atmosphere
4.1
Maxwell Distribution
The starting point of a discussion about particle loss from the
atmosphere is the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of veloci-
ties for the particles of an ideal gas at temperature T. That
distribution, with the integral over all velocities normalized
to one, is (Mandl 1971)
f(v)d3v = π−3/2U−3e−v2/U2d3v,
(4.1)
where
U ≡
p
2kT/m,
m is the particle’s mass, and k is equal to Boltzmann’s con-
stant, a constant that is related to the perfect gas constant
R by a factor of Avogadro’s number, R = NAk. The mean-
ing of U is that it is the most probable magnitude for the
particle velocity. Fermi uses the parameter c, which is the

70
CHAPTER 4. ATMOSPHERIC LOSS
root-mean-square velocity. The two are related by
c =
r
3
2U,
(4.2)
so Eq. (4.1) for f(v) is the equivalent to Fermi’s expression.
The average kinetic energy of a particle in an ideal gas is
expressed in terms of c2 by
(1
2mv2)ave = 1
2mc2 = 3
2kT.
(4.3)
4.2
Escape Velocity
Gas particles with suﬃcient velocity may escape from the
atmosphere. A naive formulation says this will occur if the
overall particle energy, the sum of its kinetic and potential
energy, is greater than zero, so the particle is able to overcome
the Earth’s gravitational pull. This requires
mv2/2 −GMem/r ≥0,
(4.4)
where G is Newton’s constant, Me is the Earth’s mass, r is the
particle’s distance from the Earth’s center, and the particle’s
velocity is directed radially away from the Earth.
This is overly simplistic, for the gas particles in the high-
velocity tail of the Maxwell distribution will in general rescat-
ter and therefore not escape from the atmosphere because
their velocity will be redirected many times by rescattering.
For example, the mean free path of an air molecule at sea level
is approximately 65 nm, so small that in traveling 1 mm, the
molecule will undergo over ten thousand collisions. It there-
fore makes no sense to calculate an “outward ﬂux” at sea level.
However, the mean free path of a molecule steadily increases
as the density of the atmosphere decreases. At the “top” of

4.2. ESCAPE VELOCITY
71
the atmosphere, the mean free path is very large and an out-
going molecule has little chance of being scattered before it
escapes.
The situation is illustrated in Fig. (4.1), which shows the
velocity vector (bold arrow) of an escaping particle at angle θ
relative to a vector from the center of the Earth (thin arrow).
The outer shaded layer in the ﬁgure represents the lower
layers of the Earth’s atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere,
mesosphere, thermosphere). We deﬁne the “top” of the at-
mosphere to be the lower edge of the exosphere, commonly
known as the “exobase,” a region located between 500 km and
1000 km above the Earth’s surface. The mean free path of a
molecule there is thousands of meters. We call rc the critical
distance from the center of the Earth at which the particle is
within a mean free path of the “top” of the atmosphere, and
Tc the atmosphere’s equilibrium temperature at this radius.
For deﬁniteness, in the following, we take rc to correspond to
an altitude of 1000 km, and Tc = 1000 K.
The value of the escape velocity at distance rc is
vc =
p
2GMe/rc.
(4.5)
Denoting the density of particles at rc by nc, the British as-
trophysicist Sir James Jeans deﬁned what is called the Jeans
particle escape ﬂux, the number of particles expected to es-
cape per second per unit of area (Jeans 1916); (Gross 1974).
We denote this quantity by F. The outward ﬂux for particles
with given velocity v is proportional to the component of
the particle’s velocity along the outward direction, given by
ncv · ˆr = ncv cos θ, where for outgoing particles v · ˆr > 0, or
0 ≤θ ≤90◦. Multiplying the Boltzmann distribution by this
quantity, and integrating over outgoing particles with veloc-
ities greater than vc, we obtain the following expression for

showing that F involves the natural prefactor ncUc, multi-

Fermi introduces an interesting way of parameterizing (vc/Uc)2.
Begin by deﬁning a local acceleration due to gravity,
gc = GMe

(4.11)
At an altitude of 1000 km, and taking 6371 km for the Earth’s
radius, the value of gc is
gc = (6371
7371)2(9.8 m/s2) = 7.3 m/s2,
(4.12)
about 75% of g at the Earths’s surface. Then using Eq. (4.5)

or equivalently,

(4.15)

CHAPTER 4. ATMOSPHERIC LOSS
Now consider the gravitational potential energy of an atom
of mass m located at rc+h. Assuming h is much smaller than
rc, we can work to ﬁrst order in h/rc. We have
−GMem
rc + h ≈−GMem
rc
+ m(GMem

)h = −GMem
rc
+ mgch,
(4.16)
so mgch is the potential energy at h of an atom of mass m,
relative to its value at rc.
At an altitude of 1000 km and a temperature of 1000 K,
h turns out to be 1132 km for a hydrogen atom. Rewriting
Eq. (4.10) in terms of rc/h, we have
F = Ucnc
2√π (1 + rc
h )e−rc
h ≈Ucnc
2√π (rc
h )e−rc
h .
(4.17)
From here on, we will use the expression on the extreme right
of Eq. (4.17) for F. The exact form of the factor multiplying
the exponential in Eq. (4.17) plays an insigniﬁcant role com-
pared to the exponential. For hydrogen,
rc/h = (7371/1132) = 6.51.
(4.18)
The quantities nc, h, and Uc all vary from atom to atom, so
to denote atom a, we write nc(a), h(a), Uc(a), and Fa. Given
the dampening due to the exponential, h(a) can also be inter-
preted as the eﬀective depth for the layer of the atmosphere
from which the particle with mass ma can be emitted. For
an atom a of mass ma, the value of rc/h is that of hydrogen
multiplied by the ratio of atomic masses, ma/mH. Due to
the exponential dependence of F(a) on rc/h, this means that
F(a) decreases quite rapidly in going from hydrogen to the
heavier atoms in the atmosphere.

Lifetime of Atmosphere for
Various Atoms
Let Na denote the total number of atoms (or molecules) of
type a in the layer of the Earth’s atmosphere of thickness
h(a). Likewise, dNa/dt is the rate at which particles of type
a are being lost from the atmosphere. It is obtained by mul-
tiplying Fa by the area, 4πr2
c,

cFa.
(4.19)
We may estimate a lifetime τa for species a by the following
simple equation;
Na = dNa
dt τa,
(4.20)
or
τa = Na(dNa
dt )−1.
(4.21)
From Fa and Eq. (4.19), we have a deﬁnite expression for
dNa/dt. We estimate Na by multiplying the density nc(a) by
the volume of a spherical shell of thickness h(a),
Na ≈4πr2
ch(a)nc(a).
(4.22)
Using this approximation, we arrive at a picture of how life-
times vary as we vary the type of atom. From Eqs. (4.17) and
(4.22), we obtain the following expression for τa;
τ(a) = 2√π h(a)

To proceed, we use the the same parameters as above; Earth
radius of 6371 km, the “top of the atmosphere” altitude of

1000 km, and rc = 7371 km. Taking account of the factor of
1/
p
m(a) in the prefactor and multiplying rc/h(a) by the ra-
tio m(a)/m(H), it is straightforward to generate Table (4.1).
It is evident from the numbers in the table that atoms heavier

than helium have lifetimes for Jeans escape which are much
larger than the age of the Earth. While the escape velocity is
independent of the mass of the escaping particle, the needed
kinetic energy grows linearly with mass and becomes larger
and larger vs. kTc.
4.4
Magnitude of Particle Losses
As we said earlier, most of the particles escaping will do
so from the “top” of the atmosphere, the zone within one
mean free path of free streaming.
For Earth, this zone is
known as the exosphere, its bottom lying at approximately
1000 km above sea level. The temperature there is estimated
at roughly 1000 K though values of both Tc and rc within a
factor of two are often considered.
At rc = 7371 km, the escape velocity, as deﬁned in Eq. (4.5),
is vc = 10.4 km/s. It is of course the same for all particles,
while Uc, the most probable velocity at Tc, is inversely propor-
tional to the square root of the particle’s mass. Jeans escape

4.4. MAGNITUDE OF PARTICLE LOSSES
77
is usually parameterized using the rms velocity Urms (Fermi’s
c,) related to Uc by Urms = (
p
3/2)Uc. A rough rule of thumb
(Catling and Zahnle 2009) for estimating Jeans escape loss is
that the loss is only signiﬁcant if
λ = vc/Urms ≤6.
At the temperature of 1000 K, we have Urms = 4.98 km/s for
a hydrogen atom, so λH ∼2. Consequently we expect the
Jeans mechanism to be signiﬁcant for atomic and molecular
hydrogen and possibly even for helium, which has a λ of only
4, still below the limit of 6. On the other hand, the mecha-
nism does not lead to a loss of heavier gases such as oxygen
and nitrogen.
In detail atmospheric escape is more complicated than Jeans
escape for a number of reasons. One is that the Jeans mecha-
nism is an overestimate of particle loss because it assumes the
tail of the Maxwell velocity distribution from which the par-
ticles escape is replenished as fast as, or faster than particles
escape. This does not seem to be the case. A second reason is
the existence of other mechanisms (Gross 1974; Catling and
Zahnle 2009) for particle escape that play an important role
in hydrogen loss and are dominant for heavier atoms. A de-
tailed discussion of them is outside the scope of Fermi’s notes,
but we will mention one that is known to play an important
role for hydrogen and for helium. A chemical reaction in the
upper atmosphere can produce a rapid ion. The Earth’s mag-
netic ﬁeld normally acts to prevent such an ion from escaping,
but the ﬁeld’s lines of force loop back toward the Earth near
the poles so the ion may avoid there the constraining force
the ﬁeld imposes. This phenomenon is known as polar wind.
Alternatively an ion, e.g., a fast hydrogen ion produced in
a chemical reaction, may strip away an electron from a slow
hydrogen atom, which now neutral, may proceed without suf-
fering much loss of velocity.

78
CHAPTER 4. ATMOSPHERIC LOSS
Another eﬀect leading to escape is the solar wind, the
stream of charged particles emitted at the Sun’s corona. It
is largely deﬂected by the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, except near
the poles, but it can certainly act in that region to attract and
then drag away positively charged ions present in the upper
atmosphere. Hydrodynamic escape, in which a strong ther-
mal escape of lighter particles drags along heavier particles
by collision is yet another example.
4.5
Helium
We present here a few facts about helium, present at approx-
imately 5 ppm (parts per million) in the atmosphere at stan-
dard conditions of pressure and temperature (STP). Since
helium is such a light atom, it is at ﬁrst sight surprising that
it exists at all as a component of the lower atmosphere. The
explanation is that there is a constant inﬂux into the atmo-
sphere of helium atoms produced in the Earth’s crust. They
originate through the emission of alpha particles (helium nu-
clei) in radioactive decay, principally caused by uranium and
thorium isotopes. The alpha particles then attach to elec-
trons and form atomic helium.
Helium escapes from the atmosphere at approximately
1.5 × 106 kg/year, (Catling and Zahnle 2009), a much larger
rate than the Jeans mechanism predicts. Our present under-
standing is that whereas the Jeans mechanism accounts for
almost half of atmospheric hydrogen’s escape, atmospheric
helium escape is almost entirely due to other mechanisms,
principally polar wind and chemical exchange.
The helium fraction in the atmosphere appears to be sta-
ble, although there is no fundamental physics requirement
that this be so. A stable fraction would imply that the rate

4.6. SPEED OF SOUND
79
at which helium escapes from the lower atmosphere is bal-
anced by the rate at which helium from radioactive decays is
emitted into the lower atmosphere. Neither of these rates is
known with great precision although both have been intense
subjects of research in the recent years.
Helium has many practical applications: in medicine, com-
puter chip manufacture, high-speed internet cable manufac-
ture, welding, and fundamental physics research, to name just
a few. This has led to a helium extraction industry, whose
main source is the small fraction of helium in natural gas.
The rate at which industrial helium is produced is usually
quoted in cubic meters at STP per year. Fermi quotes a ﬁg-
ure of 15×106 m3/year for the amount of helium produced in
the United States. The present ﬁgure, approximately 40% of
the world’s total, is closer to 70 × 106 m3/year. At STP, the
density of helium is 0.179 kg/m3, so the US production of he-
lium is roughly 13 × 106 kg/year. This is several times larger
than the amount of helium that escapes the atmosphere in
a year. Since helium is a nonrenewable resource, there have
been recent concerns about the world’s supply of this gas be-
ing exhausted. Helium stockpiling, new extraction methods,
and helium recycling are all being pursued to ensure a steady
supply of helium for the foreseeable future.
4.6
Speed of Sound and
Atmospheric Altitude
Fermi brieﬂy illustrates how the speed of sound varies with
altitude as sound waves propagate through the atmosphere
at diﬀerent altitudes. Sound waves are caused by successive
compressions and rarefactions of the medium through which
the disturbance is propagating. The speed of the longitudinal

80
CHAPTER 4. ATMOSPHERIC LOSS
wave therefore depends on the relation between the pressure
P that is exerted and the density ρ of the medium.
The
square of the sound speed is given by
vs2 = (∂P
∂ρ )ad.
(4.24)
The subscript ad means that the compressions and rarefac-
tions take place adiabatically; pressure and volume are re-
lated, as discussed in Sec. (3.4), by
P = const.ργ.
Isaac Newton was the ﬁrst to evaluate the speed of sound
but he erroneously assumed that the successive compressions
and rarefactions took place isothermally. Pierre Laplace later
realized that the heat ﬂow from one region to another is negli-
gible as long as the wavelength is long compared to the mean
free path in the medium. Computing the partial derivative
of Eq. (4.24) gives
vs2 = γP
ρ .
(4.25)
For an ideal gas of molecular weight M, we have
P
ρ = RT
M ,
(4.26)
so
vs2 = γRT
M .
(4.27)
Though not providing the formulas we have just shown, Fermi
illustrates graphically how the velocity of sound ﬁrst decreases
with increasing altitude in the atmosphere and then increases
as we transition from the troposphere to the stratosphere, fol-
lowing the same pattern of temperature versus atmospheric
altitude we have already displayed in Fig. (3.2).

4.6. SPEED OF SOUND
81
In the troposphere, using M = 28.97g for the molecular
weight of air, γ = 7/5, and taking T = 373 K, the speed of
sound waves is
vs =

γRT
M
= 343 m/s.
(4.28)
The corresponding result for the rms velocity Urms is
Urms =

3RT
M
= 502 m/s.
(4.29)
We see that the sound velocity is somewhat smaller than the
rms velocity. The ratio is independent of temperature and is
