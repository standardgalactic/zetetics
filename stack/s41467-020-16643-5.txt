Precise gene editing aims at generating single-nucleotide modiﬁcations to correct or model
human disease. However, precision editing with nucleases such as CRIPSR-Cas9 has seen
limited success due to poor efﬁciency and limited practicality. Here, we establish a ﬂuor-
escent DNA repair assay in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to visualize and
quantify the frequency of DNA repair outcomes during monoallelic and biallelic targeting. We
found that modulating both DNA repair and cell cycle phase via deﬁned culture conditions
and small molecules synergistically enhanced the frequency of homology-directed repair
(HDR). Notably, targeting in homozygous reporter cells results in high levels of editing with a
vast majority of biallelic HDR outcomes. We then leverage efﬁcient biallelic HDR with mixed
ssODN repair templates to generate heterozygous mutations. Synergistic gene editing
represents an effective strategy to generate precise genetic modiﬁcations in human iPS cells.

uman induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells are being
widely employed to study human diseases, including
inherited disorders, due to their ability to maintain a
normal diploid karyotype through serial passages and differ-
entiate into multiple derivative cell types. In general, genetic
modeling consists of modifying a target site, either by deleting,
inserting or replacing a speciﬁc DNA sequence1. More speciﬁ-
cally, precision gene editing aims to make modiﬁcations in the
genome to correct or recreate pathogenic variants at single-
nucleotide resolution2. The CRISPR-Cas9 system is the most used
tool to generate targeted DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the
genome3,4, which are subsequently resolved by endogenous cel-
lular
DNA
DSB
repair
pathways.
Predominantly,
non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) results in insertion and dele-
tion (indel) mutations, while microhomology-mediated end
joining (MMEJ) makes predictable deletions5. NHEJ and MMEJ
are referred to collectively as mutagenic end joining (MutEJ) as
both repair outcomes can lead to a loss or gain of DNA sequence.
In order to generate single-nucleotide changes, the homology-
directed repair (HDR) pathway is leveraged in combination with
a customized repair template such as a donor plasmid or single-
stranded donor oligonucleotide (ssODN)6–9. However, recent
approaches have met limited efﬁciency and applicability that are
largely due to a lack of direct selection10 and the predominance of
MutEJ outcomes over precise repair11,12. Base editors combining
deaminases with Cas9 nickase present a strategy to generate
single-nucleotide substitutions with minimal MutEJ, but show
restricted editing to a ﬁxed 5-bp window and high risk for
bystander editing, as well as a limited range and number of
possible nucleotide substitutions13 and risk for off-target deami-
nase activity14. Thus, HDR editing with custom ssODN templates
warrants further optimization.
Low HDR/MutEJ ratios15–17 have spurred efforts to improve
precision editing by inﬂuencing DNA repair. Approaches shown
to improve HDR rates include the modulation of DNA repair
components by targeted NHEJ inhibition18–21, ectopic expression
of HDR factors22–24 or the direct fusion of HDR-promoting
proteins to Cas925–27, and conjugation of ssODN repair templates
to Cas928,29. Inducing cold shock by a moderate reduction in
incubation culture temperature was shown to increase the protein
half-life and targeting efﬁciency of zinc ﬁnger nucleases (ZFN)
and transcription activator-like effector (TALE)-nuclease chi-
meras (TALENs) in K562 and HeLa cells30,31 and more recently
to improve HDR rates using Cas9 in iPS cells32,33, although the
mechanisms in iPS cells remain unknown.
DNA repair pathway choice is closely tied to the cell cycle to
safeguard genomic integrity during mitosis, and cell-cycle syn-
chronization has been linked to improved HDR rates in various
cell lines34–36. HDR is limited to the S and G2 phase, concurrent
with the availability of homologous sequence that is used as a
repair template during genomic insult37,38. On the other hand,
NHEJ is active throughout the cell cycle39. Individually, strategies
aimed to either control DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, or the
availability of nuclease reagents and homologous repair templates
have resulted in improved HDR rates. Yet despite continued
efforts, no clear evidence of synergistic effects on gene editing
efﬁciency has been reported to date35,40,41.
In this study, we show synergy between DNA DSB repair and
the cell cycle in favoring the generation of ssODN-mediated
single-nucleotide changes. Establishing a ﬂuorescent DNA DSB
repair assay based on GFP to BFP conversion42 in iPS cells, we
screen compounds and culture conditions to evaluate their effects
on DNA repair outcomes at the single-cell level by ﬂuorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. HDR rates and HDR/
MutEJ ratios are improved when modulating DNA repair path-
way choice by single or dual inhibition, and HDR rates are further
improved by modulating cell-cycle progression with cold shock or
pharmacological
inhibition.
However,
high-frequency
HDR
editing predominantly leads to the generation of homozygous
mutants in a biallelic reporter system. In order to generate het-
erozygous mutants under these conditions, we employ a strategy
using mixed ssODN repair templates to protect one allele with a
silent mutation. We then apply synergistic gene editing at
endogenous autosomal loci and improve several-fold the precise
generation of heterozygous and homozygous mutations com-
pared to baseline HDR levels. These results show that controlling
cell-cycle progression and DNA repair synergistically improve
ssODN-mediated gene editing, as demonstrated through the
generation of various isogenic models of genetic disease.
Results
Fluorescent DNA repair assay in human iPS cells. Fluorescent
reporters provide a means to visualize and quantify gene editing
outcomes. GFP and BFP share high sequence homology, and a
single tyrosine to histidine (Y66H) amino-acid change in the
ﬂuorophore region is sufﬁcient to convert GFP to BFP ﬂuores-
cence emission42. We generated an iPS cell line heterozygously
targeted at the AAVS1 locus in the 1383D6 parental background
(Supplementary Fig. 1) with a stably expressing GFP ﬂuorescent
reporter following our previously published method43. A Cas9-
mediated DSB in GFP was repaired using a 100 bp ssODN
template designed to make four nucleotide changes resulting in
conversion of GFP to BFP (Y66H), insertion of a PAM blocking
mutation to prevent Cas9 recleavage and stabilize the BFP protein
(T65S), and creation of a NcoI restriction site for genotyping by
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (Fig. 1a).
Three possible ﬂuorescent outcomes reﬂect DNA repair choices:
BFP, loss of ﬂuorescence (Δ), and GFP, corresponding to HDR,
MutEJ, and unmodiﬁed alleles, respectively (Fig. 1b). Due to
uniform expression of the reporter from the AAVS1 locus, these
three outcomes could be clearly discriminated and quantiﬁed
following nuclease treatment (Fig. 1c–e; Supplementary Fig. 2).
Cell-cycle control favors HDR outcomes. Considering the link
between cell-cycle phase and DNA repair pathway choice, we
aimed to synchronize cells using various culture conditions and
chemical inhibitors. Mild hypothermia has been shown to cause
cell-cycle arrest and slow cell metabolism in vitro44. We observed
that applying a 32 °C cold shock for 48 h directly following
electroporation (EP) improved HDR frequency 1.4-fold (30.1% vs
21.3%) and the HDR/MutEJ ratio 1.6-fold compared to normal
culture conditions at 37 °C (Fig. 2a, b; Supplementary Fig. 3a, b),
conﬁrming previously published results32,33.
In order to elucidate the effect of cold shock on iPS cells, we
performed cell-cycle analysis using a 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine
(EdU) proliferation assay combined with propidium iodide (PI)
staining for total DNA content, and quantiﬁed the cell-cycle
phase after EP and cold shock treatment (Fig. 2c). Cells
undergoing cold shock for 48 h after EP showed 25.5% of cell-
cycle phase accumulation in the G2/M phase compared to 6.0%
under normal culture conditions. In addition, the mean intensity
of EdU incorporation was reduced 2.4-fold in S-phase cells in the
cold shock condition, indicating a reduced DNA synthesis rate.
We tested the effect of cell-cycle synchronization in late G2/M
phase by pretreating cells with Nocodazole for 16 h before EP but,
in disagreement to previous reports34,35, we observed no increase
in HDR efﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. 3c–e). This might suggest
that slowed cell-cycle progression in the presence of nuclease is
more important than G2/M synchronization prenuclease. Noco-
dazole inhibits microtubule polymerization, activating the spindle
assembly checkpoint and arresting cells in prometaphase, likely

causing cells to immediately complete mitosis upon nocodazole
release.
Since HDR is most active in S/G2 phase, we investigated the
effect of synchronizing cells using the CDC7 inhibitor XL413,
which halts S-phase progression and arrests karyotypically
normal cells in G1/S45,46. As expected, EdU/PI staining revealed
accumulation of >90% of cells in G1 and early S phase after 24 h
treatment with XL413 after EP (Fig. 2d–f). XL413 increased the
HDR frequency 1.7-fold (33.7% vs 19.4%), and the HDR/MutEJ
ratio
2.2-fold
compared
to
the
untreated
control.
When
combining XL413 treatment for 24 h with cold shock for 48 h,
the HDR frequency was increased further by 2-fold (39.4% vs
19.4%) and the HDR/MutEJ ratio by 2.7-fold (0.86 vs 0.32), such
that HDR events became nearly as frequent as MutEJ. Interest-
ingly, pretreatment of cells with XL413 before EP did not improve
HDR (Supplementary Fig. 3f–h). These results indicate that
chemical
and
environmental
factors
modulating
cell-cycle
synchronization and progression can individually and synergis-
tically affect DNA repair pathway choice in favor of higher HDR
outcomes.
Modulating DNA repair pathways to bias HDR outcomes. To
further improve precise gene editing, we treated cells with various
small molecules (Fig. 3a) reported to inhibit particular DNA
repair pathway components: KU-5593347, VE-82148, NU744149,
Mirin50, PFM0151, TDRL-50552, and SCR753; or enhance HDR
rates: RS-154 and L75550755. Human iPS cells were treated with
small molecules for 4 h before and 48 h following EP, in addition
to 48 h cold shock. Among screened compounds, NU7441
(a DNA-PKcs inhibitor) and SCR7 (a ligase IV inhibitor)
increased the HDR frequency 1.6-fold and 1.4-fold (35.5% and
32.3% vs 22.6%; Fig. 3b) and were the only two compounds with
an HDR/MutEJ ratio > 0.5. Interestingly, compared to NU7441,
SCR7-treated samples also showed a larger fraction of MutEJ,
resulting in a reduced HDR/MutEJ ratio increase (1.4-fold vs 2.2-
fold for NU7441) despite similar proportions of HDR (Fig. 3c).
When combined, NU7441 + SCR7 (N + S) had a cumulative
effect further improving HDR frequency by 1.8-fold (49.6% vs
27.3%) and the HDR/MutEJ ratio by 2.7-fold compared to
untreated control (1.11 vs 0.41), resulting in a majority of HDR
events (Fig. 3d, e). On the other hand, previously reported HDR
enhancers such as RS-1 and L755507 showed only a modest
change in HDR frequency. These data suggest that inhibiting
several molecular targets within the NHEJ repair pathway can
have an additive effect, further promoting the use of HDR for
DSB repair.
We next combined chemical cell-cycle synchronization with
XL413 and NHEJ repression with N + S treatment, in order to
verify possible additive effects improving HDR rates (Fig. 3f–h).
Under normal culture conditions, treatment with XL413 (XL) or
N + S alone increased HDR frequency by 1.8-fold and 2.3-fold
(30.5 and 39% vs 17%), respectively, while combining XL413 with
N + S further increased the HDR frequency by 2.7-fold (45.7% vs
17%) compared to an untreated control. Under cold-shock
conditions, comparable changes in HDR frequency were observed
for individual treatments, but the combination of XL413 with
N + S did not show improvement in HDR frequency compared
to N + S treatment alone. In brief, we show evidence for the

existence of synergistic gene editing enhancing HDR outcome
frequencies when combining modulation of DNA repair with
cold shock, or with cell-cycle synchronization in G1/S phase.
Highly efﬁcient biallelic gene editing. In diploid iPS cells, both
paternal and maternal alleles are candidates for editing. In order
to recapitulate this scenario, we generated a homozygous GFP
reporter iPS cell line in the 1383D6 parental background
(Supplementary Fig. 1) and evaluated biallelic gene targeting
outcomes (Fig. 4a). We ﬁrst compared monoallelic and biallelic
targeting efﬁciencies and DNA repair outcome frequencies
between heterozygous and homozygous GFP reporter lines
(Fig. 4b) and found comparable HDR frequencies in both lines
(24.3% and 29.2%). In the homozygous context, we gated cells
having at least one BFP allele as HDR outcomes, and cells having
at least one GFP allele as unmodiﬁed, which results in a reduced

fraction of MutEJ cells and a 1.4-fold higher HDR/MutEJ ratio
compared to the heterozygous cell line (Fig. 4c). Surprisingly,
there was no detectable double-positive population that repre-
sents heterozygote mutants bearing one HDR allele (BFP) and
one unmodiﬁed allele (GFP), referred to as HDR* (Fig. 4a). To
further explore the cause, we deconvolved all possible biallelic
repair outcomes to estimate individual allele repair efﬁciencies
(Fig. 4d). Here, we obtained 16.1% BFP/BFP precise biallelic
editing, and a predominant fraction of MutEJ alleles distributed
across BFP/Δ (13.1%), Δ/Δ (44%), and GFP/Δ (2.1%) repair
outcomes. In summary, this data revealed that both alleles are
mostly coedited or unmodiﬁed, as shown by the low frequency of
monoallelic editing in GFP/Δ (2.1%) and BFP/GFP (0.3%) repair
outcomes.

fold increase in HDR frequency (48.9% vs 12.2%) and a 3.7-fold
increase in HDR/MutEJ ratio (1.73 vs 0.49) compared to
untreated control (Fig. 4e, f). Deconvolution of biallelic repair
outcomes showed 30.5% BFP/BFP biallelic repair outcomes when
using N + S treatment, 5.7-fold higher than the untreated
condition (5.3%) (Fig. 4g). These results demonstrated high
biallelic targeting efﬁciency when combining cold shock treat-
ment and DNA repair pathway inhibitors, leading to the effective
generation of homozygous mutants containing single-nucleotide
modiﬁcations. Interestingly, under the conditions we tested, the
proportion of heterozygous BFP/GFP outcomes was consistently
low (0.7% and 0.5% with and without N + S treatment) indicating
that although homozygous outcomes are frequent, an alternative
targeting strategy would be required to efﬁciently generate
heterozygous mutations.
Generation of heterozygous mutations. In order to resolve low
monoallelic editing rates while retaining high overall HDR fre-
quencies, we adopted a mixed ssODN repair template strategy.
Herein, we leveraged high biallelic modiﬁcation rates to generate
HDR-mediated compound heterozygous mutations composed of
one edited allele and one protected allele bearing a silent blocking
mutation, thereby preventing subsequent Cas9 recleavage and
indel formation at the target site (Fig. 5a). Along with the Y66H-
mutant ssODN (ssODN ‘M’), we designed an ssODN carrying a
silent T65T blocking mutation (ssODN ‘B’), and a wild-type
(WT) ssODN identical to the GFP target sequence (ssODN ‘W’)
as a control. HDR-mediated editing of T65T with ssODN B
destroys the PAM sequence at the target site, resulting in a Cas9-
protected GFP allele (pGFP) (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Alleles
incorporating ssODN W were expected to be susceptible to
recleavage. Biallelic HDR repair outcomes were expected to result
in the generation of homozygous BFP/BFP and pGFP/pGFP cells,
as well as a fraction of desired compound heterozygous BFP/
pGFP cells referred to as HDR*.
Single ssODN templates and ssODN combinations were tested
(Fig. 5b, c). ssODN B showed a 1.5-fold increase in GFP-positive
cells (57.2%) suggesting the generation of pGFP alleles by HDR,
while ssODN W showed a 1.8-fold decrease (22.2%) compared to
ssODN M (39.1%), suggesting that WT GFP alleles generated
through HDR are subject to recleavage as predicted. Combina-
tions of ssODN M + B and ssODN M + W yielded similar total
repair frequencies. Nonetheless, among all ssODN conditions
only the combination of ssODN M and B resulted in a population
of heterozygous BFP/GFP double-positive cells, with an efﬁciency
of 3.6% (Fig. 5d, e), 12-fold higher than using ssODN M alone
(0.3%) and 20-fold higher than using a combination of ssODN M
and W (0.18%). When applying N + S treatment in addition to
cold shock, the efﬁciency of compound heterozygous BFP/pGFP
generation retained a similar fold-enrichment over ssODN M
(12.4-fold) or ssODN M + W (16.2-fold) alone but increased to
11.2% of the total population (Supplementary Fig. 4c–f). These
results suggest that under conditions of high HDR efﬁciency,
protection of one allele against Cas9-mediated recleavage is
required in order to obtain heterozygous mutant alleles without a
mutagenic indel in the second allele.
Consequently, we veriﬁed the applicability of this approach
to endogenous loci. First, we targeted ATP1A1 (Supplementary
Fig. 5a) that is known to cause 2000-fold increase in dominant
cellular resistance to the cytotoxic inhibitor ouabain when
introducing Q118R and N129D missense mutations compared
to making in-frame indel mutations56. Selecting for HDR
clones under high ouabain concentration, we observed a 1.8-
fold increase in colony number with combined cold shock and
N + S treatment, indicating synergistic increase in frequency at
an endogenous locus (Supplementary Fig. 5b). Next, we aimed
to edit nonselectable endogenous loci. We independently
generated the N588K (c.1764C > A) mutation in KCNH2 and
G201V (c.602 G > T) mutation in PSMB8, either using an
ssODN carrying the mutation (ssODN M) or a combination of
ssODN M and an ssODN carrying a silent blocking mutation
(ssODN M + B) and performed clonal analysis (Supplementary
Fig. 5c, d). Under optimal cold shock and drug treatment
conditions, we obtained 14 out of 96 homozygous clones edited
at KCNH2 and 18 out of 91 at PSMB8 when using KCNH2 or
PSMB8 ssODN M only, corresponding to biallelic HDR events
(Supplementary Fig. 5e, f). Moreover, we could only obtain
compound heterozygous clones at KCNH2 (4/92) or PSMB8 (4/
95) when using the ssODN M + B combination, corresponding
to biallelic HDR events incorporating mutant ssODN M and
silent blocking ssODN B at cognate alleles. These results
conﬁrm that our approach is highly effective to generate both
homozygous and heterozygous clones at endogenous loci in
human iPS cells.
Synergistic gene editing enhances HDR at endogenous loci.
Finally, in considering the application of gene-edited iPS cells for
cell therapy, we tested our deﬁned conditions using a transfection
instrument approved for GMP cell applications. We compared
DNA repair outcome frequencies in normal culture, cold shock,
and combined cold shock and N + S conditions in heterozygous
and homozygous GFP iPS cell lines generated in two different
donor genetic backgrounds (Supplementary Fig. 6). In the
1383D6 genetic background, HDR efﬁciency increased 1.2-fold
with cold shock and 1.6-fold with combined cold shock and N +
S treatment both in heterozygous (59.1% and 75.6% vs 47.9%)
and homozygous (64.6% and 84.1% vs 52.9%) cell lines compared
to an untreated control. When editing homozygous GFP iPS cells
with ssODN M and B, the efﬁciency of compound heterozygous
BFP/pGFP editing increased by 1.5-fold with cold shock and 2.5-
fold with combined cold shock and N + S treatment (14.4% to
24.1% vs 9.8%). Similar results were obtained in the 409B2 genetic
background.
Furthermore, cell-cycle synchronization with XL413 and DNA
repair modulation with N + S treatment again showed evidence
of synergistic gene editing enhancing HDR frequencies (Fig. 6).
Remarkably, HDR outcomes reached 83.3% during monoallelic
editing of heterozygous GFP iPS cells (Fig. 6a, b), and 96.6%
during biallelic editing of homozygous GFP iPS cells when
combining XL413 and N + S treatment under cold shock
conditions (Fig. 6c, d; Supplementary Fig. 7a, b), including
84.8% biallelic HDR editing outcomes. Moreover, 32.2% of cells
became compound heterozygotes when editing homozygous GFP
iPS cells with mixed ssODN M and B repair templates (Fig. 6e, f;
Supplementary
Fig.
7c,
d).
We
ultimately
veriﬁed
HDR
frequencies of synergistic gene editing at endogenous loci
(Supplementary Fig. 8), using combined XL413 and N + S (XL
+ N + S) or combined cold shock and N + S (32 °C + N + S)
compared to untreated (−) baseline HDR levels (Fig. 6g, h). HDR
outcomes included clones with template-mediated repair events
on one or both alleles, while MutEJ outcomes included clones
with an indel on at least one allele. Overall, synergistic gene
editing resulted in several-fold increase in HDR frequencies at all
targeted loci, conﬁrming broad applicability of this strategy to
targeting the human genome (Fig. 6g). At 5 loci (KCNH2 N588D/
N588K, APRT M136T, HES7 R25W, and PSMB8 G201V), we
obtained from 18 to 23 out of 32 clones with HDR alleles under
XL + N + S treatment, representing 56 to 72% total HDR
efﬁciency. Interestingly, cell-cycle arrest with XL413 had a
stronger effect on HDR rates than cold shock, when combined

with N + S treatment. At the other 5 loci (KCNE1 D85N, KCNH2
N45D, SCN5A A1428S, and KCNJ11 T293N/T294M), total
editing efﬁciency was low as shown by the greater proportion
of unmodiﬁed wild-type clones, suggesting poor gRNA activity.
In this case, between 0 and 8 out of 32 HDR clones or 0 to 25%
HDR efﬁciency was achieved. Similarly, HDR/MutEJ ratios were
improved with synergistic gene editing, with a stronger effect
observed in most cases for XL413 compared to cold shock
(Fig. 6h). In summary, these results conﬁrm that synergistic gene
editing via cell-cycle synchronization and DNA repair pathway
modulation is transferrable between electroporation instruments
and to other iPS cell lines, resulting in the efﬁcient clonal
generation of homozygous and compound heterozygous muta-
tions at multiple endogenous loci.
Discussion
In this study, we sought to bias DNA repair outcomes towards
HDR during ssODN-mediated gene editing in human iPS cells,
using chemical and cell-culture condition interventions (Fig. 7).
Cold shock was shown to have various effects on cellular
function under severe (4–16 °C), moderate (16–25 °C), and
mild (25–35 °C) hypothermia, such as slowed metabolism,
activation of apoptotic pathways, changes in gene expression
and cell-cycle arrest44,57. Mild cold shock of 32 °C is char-
acterized by peak levels of cold-inducible RNA-binding protein
(CIRP) and RNA-binding motif protein 3 (RBM3) that have
important functions in cellular protection against various
endogenous and environmental stresses58–60. In the context of

efﬁciency32,33, yet the mechanism remains unclear. Here we
showed that cold shock slowed cell-cycle progression, accu-
mulated cells in G2/M phase, and reduced DNA synthesis rates.
Alternatively, cold shock could manifest through other non-
cell-cycle-dependent effects such as nuclease stability30, gRNA
association or DNA cleavage kinetics and stabilization of repair
intermediates, post-translational regulation, and cell viability.
These additional effects of cold shock may explain the synergy
observed in combination with the XL413-induced cell-cycle
arrest in G1/S phase.

Regulation of the cell cycle is an ongoing area of interest in the
ﬁelds of DNA repair and gene editing. It has been proposed that
increased CDK activity in S phase stimulates phosphorylation of
key HDR proteins such as CtIP, promoting DSB end resection
and HDR61. Cell-cycle synchronization at the G1/S boundary
with Aphidicolin and in late G2/M phase with Nocodazole was
shown to enhance HDR frequency34,35. Furthermore, simulta-
neous promotion of G1/S transition by Cyclin D1 (CCND1)
overexpression and cell-cycle synchronization in G2/M phase
with nocodazole was reported to further improve HDR efﬁ-
ciency41. Here, we report enhanced gene editing by the CDC7
inhibitor XL413 in iPS cells. XL413 was reported to accumulate
cells in S/G2/M phases in cancer cell lines46, while arrest in G1/
early S phase was reported in karyotypically normal cells45, in
agreement with our observations in iPS cells. It is also known that
human iPS cells, similar to embryonic stem (ES) cells, have an
abbreviated G1 phase of ~2.5 h and enter S phase ~4 h after
nocodazole-induced synchronization in G2/M phase62,63. During
CRISPR-Cas9 targeting, RNP activity is initiated within 4 h of
delivery and is mostly completed after ~24 h due to RNP
degradation64, leaving a limited time window for DSB formation
and recruitment of the HDR pathway in S/G2 phase. Therefore,
cell-cycle retardation in G2/M or synchronization in G1/early S
phase at a time when nuclease activities are high might ensure
rapid cell-cycle entry in S phase, which is in any case the pre-
dominant cell-cycle state in iPS cells and favors HDR repair.
While it is interesting that nocodazole failed to enhance iPS cell
gene editing in our experiments, XL413 had a clear positive effect,
warranting further exploration.
We found that the NHEJ inhibitors NU7441 and SCR741,49
individually improve HDR efﬁciency in iPS cells, and further
improve HDR efﬁciency when combined. DNA-PKcs is speciﬁ-
cally activated upon DSB formation61 and recruits protein com-
ponents of the NHEJ pathway including DNA ligase IV, which
acts to join DNA ends. We suspect that inhibition of DNA-PKcs
with NU7441 might circumvent NHEJ complex assembly and
allow for alternative DNA repair pathway choices, whereas for
downstream inhibition of DNA ligase IV with SCR7, cells may
already be committed to NHEJ or some alternative MutEJ repair.
This may explain the higher HDR efﬁciency with NU7441
compared to SCR7 treatment. Interestingly, we did not observe
enhancement of HDR by RS-1 or L755507. With regard to the
speciﬁc type of HDR we are aiming to induce, recent reports
speculate that ssODN-mediated DSB repair undergoes synthesis
dependent strand annealing (SDSA)65–67, which is a RAD51-
independent process and thus might explain the limited effect of
HDR enhancers RS-1 and possibly L755507 in our system.
Previous studies attempted to combine cell-cycle synchroni-
zation with NHEJ inhibition but did not observe improved HDR
efﬁciency compared to individual conditions. This may be due to
the use of karyotypically abnormal cell lines as HEK293T cells40
or because of the low efﬁciency of the SCR7 inhibitor alone in
pluripotent stem cells35. In addition, HDR activity peaks in mid S
phase and decreases in G2 phase in karyotypically normal
cells16,17, which might indicate the limited efﬁciency we observed
in iPS cells with late G2/M phase synchronization by Nocodazole.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that different condi-
tions simultaneously modulating cell-cycle phase and DNA repair

Fig. 7 Summary of synergistic gene editing effects favoring HDR
outcomes. Synchronization and release of cells into the HDR permissive S
and G2 phases of the cell-cycle synergizes with DNA repair inhibition to
improve HDR rates. Additional non-cell-cycle-dependent effects of cold
shock may also play a role. Leveraging these mechanisms, homozygous
mutations are generated at high efﬁciency, while heterozygous mutations
may be generated without indels by using a combination of mutant and
blocking ssODN templates.

pathway choice synergistically improve HDR frequency. To our
knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to report synergistic effects of cell-
cycle synchronization and DNA repair pathway modulation on
precise gene editing.
Using this approach, we obtained up to 96.6% of cells with
HDR alleles during biallelic editing, including 84.8% biallelic
HDR editing when generating homozygous mutations. Surpris-
ingly, high editing efﬁciencies were associated with nearly non-
existent heterozygous mutant cells. Single HDR alleles formed by
precise monoallelic editing were predominantly paired with an
indel in the second allele, in agreement with previous reports11,12.
Therefore, we adopted a mixed ssODN strategy to create com-
pound

mutant
alleles
protected
from
Cas9-
recleavage8,12, and generated up to 32.2% compound hetero-
zygous mutants at the GFP reporter. Considering endogenous
targets for disease modeling, we generated homozygous and
compound heterozygous mutations at multiple loci and demon-
strated that synergistic gene editing consistently improves HDR
outcome frequencies several-fold compared to baseline HDR
levels. Eventually, obtaining heterozygous mutants without silent
mutations protecting the second allele may require a second
round of editing8,68, or use of a two-step donor vector targeting
and excision process such as the MhAX method2. Other strategies
could leverage haplotype speciﬁcity69, conversion tract8,66, or
nuclease titration to bias towards monoallelic editing, but these
approaches will be locus-dependent and come at the cost of lower
editing efﬁciency. We expect that synergistic gene editing will
improve ssODN-based strategies for introducing and removing
blocking mutations using two-step targeting.
In conclusion, we established a biallelic reporter system capable
of resolving allele-speciﬁc DNA repair outcomes and deﬁned
synergistic gene editing conditions improving HDR and HDR/
MutEJ rates using cold shock, cell-cycle synchronization and
DNA repair modulation. Leveraging high efﬁciency biallelic
modiﬁcation, we demonstrated a strategy to generate compound
heterozygous iPS cell lines. We expect that improving the relia-
bility of biallelic editing outcomes will greatly facilitate the gen-
eration of dominant and recessive genetic disease models and
possibly even therapies using human iPS cells.
Methods
Human iPS cell culture. Human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines, namely
409B2 (RIKENBRC #HPS0076) and 1383D6 (RIKEN BRC #HPS1006) were
maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in commercially available StemFit AK02N
medium (Ajinomoto, Cat. No. RCAK02N) on 0.5 mg/mL silk iMatrix-511,
Recombinant Human Laminin-511 E8 Fragment (Nippi, Cat. No. 892021) coated
tissue culture plates with daily medium exchange. Cell passage was performed
every 7 days during maintenance. Cells were ﬁrst dissociated with Accumax
(Innovative Cell Technologies, Cat. No. AM105-500) and 10 min incubation at
37 °C, then washed in StemFit AK02N medium supplemented with 10 µM ROCK
inhibitor Y-27632 (Wako, Cat. No. 253-00513) and seeded onto iMatrix511-coated
plates at a density of 1 × 103 cells/cm2 in StemFit AK02N medium with ROCK
inhibitor for 48 h after seeding, and then cultured without ROCK inhibitor. All the
cell lines were routinely tested as negative for mycoplasma contamination.
AAVS1 targeting. Cell lines targeted heterozygously or homozygously to the
AAVS1 safe-harbor locus with a CAG-driven GFP cassette were established in two
distinct human iPS cell genetic backgrounds, 409B2 and 1383D6. GFP hetero-
zygous (317-A4) and homozygous (317-D6) clones generated in the 409B2 parental
iPS cell line were previously reported43. GFP heterozygous (073-1-3) and homo-
zygous (073-1-2) clones were generated in the 1383D6 parental iPS cell line as
previously described43, employing the Neomycin (E182) donor vector and TALE
nucleases. Genotyping was performed in targeted clones with Southern blotting
using SphI digestion of genomic DNA, internal transgenic or genomic DIG-labelled
probes (GFP or 5′ probe), and chemiluminescent detection for 2.5 h.
iPS cell gene editing. An equimolar amount of crRNA and tracrRNA sequences
(IDT, Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 crRNA and tracrRNA) was hybridized for 5 min at 95 °
C to form functional crRNA:tracrRNA duplexes (gRNA). For each electroporation
(EP), 30.5 pmol gRNA was mixed with 30.5 pmol Cas9 nuclease (IDT, Alt-R S.p.
Cas9 Nuclease V3) (1:1 gRNA:Cas9 ratio) to form RNP complexes, and incubated
for 30 min at room temperature (RT). Immediately before EP, 82 pmol ssODN
repair templates (IDT, Ultramer DNA Oligonucleotides) was added to the pre-
formed RNP complexes, or equal amounts of mixed ssODN repair templates
totaling 82 pmol were added to the RNP when generating compound heterozygous
mutants. gRNA and ssODN sequences are listed in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2,
respectively. Cells were harvested with Accumax, washed, counted and resus-
pended at a density of 5 × 105 cells/10 µL in Opti-MEM I reduced-serum medium
(Life Technologies, Cat. No. 31985-062). 5 × 105 cells were added to the RNP and
ssODN mixture and a total volume of 25 µl was electroporated in a Nepa Elec-
troporation Cuvette 1 mm gap (Nepa Gene, Cat. No. EC-001) using the NEPA21
Electroporator (Nepa Gene) instrument (Poring pulse: 125 V voltage, 2.5 ms pulse
length, 50 ms pulse gap, 2 pulses, 10% pulse decay, +orientation; Transfer pulse:
20 V voltage, 50 ms pulse length, 50 ms pulse gap, 5 pulses, 40% pulse decay,
±orientation). Electroporated cells were then transferred to an iMatrix511-coated
plate in StemFit AK02N medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and incu-
bated at 37 °C, or at 32 °C for 48 h for cold shock treatment and then incubated at
37 °C. Medium exchange was performed after 48 h with StemFit AK02N without
ROCK inhibitor, and cells were maintained normally until FACS analysis on day 8.
When editing endogenous loci in 409B2 iPS cells, RNP complexes were formed
using 61 pmol gRNA and 61 pmol Cas9 (maintaining 1:1 gRNA:Cas9 ratio), an
equal amount of 82 pmol ssODN repair templates was added to the RNP before
EP, or alternatively 41 pmol of either mixed ssODN repair templates when gen-
erating compound heterozygous mutants. Then, 1 × 106 cells were added to the
RNP and ssODN mixture and a total volume of 40 µl was electroporated in a Nepa
Electroporation Cuvette 1 mm gap on the NEPA21 Electroporator under the same
electroporation conditions as outlined above.
In the case of plasmid-based delivery, a target-speciﬁc gRNA sequence
(GFPx199 gRNA: caccGCTGAAGCACTGCACGCCGT sense and
aaacACGGCGTGCAGTGCTTCAGC anti-sense oligos) was cloned into the
pX459v2 vector (a gift from F. Zhang, Addgene #62988)70. Then, 3 µg of targeting
vector and 3 µg (98 pmol) of ssODN repair templates were mixed, 1 × 106 cells
resuspended in Opti-MEM were added to the mixture and a total volume of 100 µl
was electroporated in a Nepa Electroporation Cuvette 2 mm gap (Nepa Gene, Cat.
No. EC-002) using the NEPA21 Electroporator (Poring pulse: 125 V voltage, 5 ms
pulse length, 50 ms pulse gap, 2 pulses, 10% pulse decay, +orientation; Transfer
pulse: 20 V voltage, 50 ms pulse length, 50 ms pulse gap, 5 pulses, 40% pulse decay,
±orientation). Electroporated cells were then transferred to an iMatrix511-coated
plate in StemFit AK02N medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and treated
with 1 µg/mL puromycin (Merck, Cat. No. P7255-25MG) 24 h post-EP for 48 h.
Medium exchange was then performed using StemFit AK02N without ROCK
inhibitor, and cells were standardly maintained until FACS analysis on day 8.
For gene editing experiments performed on the MaxCyte STX (MaxCyte)
instrument, cells were ﬁrst harvested 1 day before EP and plated at a density of
1.5 × 106 cells on iMatrix511-coated 6-well plates in StemFit AK02N medium
supplemented with ROCK inhibitor, as recommended by the manufacturer′s
instructions. On the day of electroporation, RNP complexes were formed in
individual 1.5 mL tubes by mixing 61 pmol gRNA with 61 pmol Cas9 nuclease (1:1
gRNA:Cas9 ratio), and 328 pmol ssODN repair templates. Cells were harvested,
counted and resuspended in MaxCyte buffer (MaxCyte, Cat. No. EPB-1) at a
density of 2 × 106 cells/100 µl, then 1 × 106 cells were added to the RNP and ssODN
mixture and a total volume of 50 µl was electroporated in an OC-100 (MaxCyte,
Cat. No. SOC-1) or OC-100 × 2 (MaxCyte, Cat. No. SOC-1 × 2) processing
assembly on the MaxCyte STX (Optimized protocol 8). After electroporation,
processing assemblies were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, then electroporated cells
were transferred to an iMatrix511-coated plate in StemFit AK02N medium
supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and incubated at 37 °C, or at 32 °C for cold
shock treatment. Medium exchange was performed after 48 h with StemFit AK02N
without ROCK inhibitor, and cells were standardly maintained until FACS analysis
on day 8.
Small molecule treatment. For screening and optimization purposes, 5 µg Cas9
(30.5 pmol) was set as a standard editing condition, although higher Cas9 amounts
resulted in higher editing efﬁciency. All small molecules were dissolved in dime-
thylsulfoxide (DMSO) as recommended by the manufacturer′s instructions, except
for XL413 that was dissolved in water. Small molecules were supplemented in
StemFit AK02N medium at a ﬁnal concentration of 3 µM for KU-55933 (Selleck
Chemicals, Cat. No. S1092), 1 µM for VE-821 (Selleck Chemicals, Cat. No. S8007),
2 µM for NU7441 (Tocris Bioscience, Cat. No. 3712), 3 µM for Mirin
(Sigma–Aldrich, Cat. No. M9948-5MG), 10 µM for PFM01 (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat.
No. SML1735-5MG), 20 µM for TDRL-505 (Calbiochem, Cat. No. 530535), 10 µM
for RS-1 (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat. No. R9782-5MG), 1 µM for SCR7 (Xcess Bioscience,
Cat. No. M60082-2S) and 5 µM for L755507 (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat. No. SML1362-
5MG), which are the maximum non-toxic concentrations in iPS cells deﬁned by a
titration curve and colony count after 48 h treatment. XL413 (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat.
No. SML1401-5MG) was supplemented at a ﬁnal concentration of 33 µM, and
Nocodazole (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat. No. M1404-2MG) at 100 ng/mL. When com-
bining several small molecules, the concentrations were equivalent to individual
treatments. The DMSO control was supplemented at a volume equal to the largest
volume of individual or combined small molecules used in treated conditions. For

gene editing, cells were pretreated for 4 h before EP and for 48 h after EP (pre) with
each small molecule, or when speciﬁed only for 48 h after EP without pretreatment
(post). Pretreated cells were harvested and resuspended in medium supplemented
with small molecule during cell counting, before being resuspended in Opti-MEM
medium for electroporation. After EP, cells were transferred to an iMatrix511-
coated plate in StemFit AK02N medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and
small molecule and incubated at 37 °C, or at 32 °C for 48 h for cold shock treatment
and then incubated at 37 °C. Medium exchange was performed 48 h after EP with
StemFit AK02N medium, and cells were standardly maintained until FACS analysis
on day 8. For cell-cycle synchronization and gene editing, XL413 treatment was
performed for 24 h after EP, replaced by StemFit AK02N medium supplemented
with ROCK inhibitor for 24 h and then by StemFit AK02N medium without ROCK
inhibitor. Nocodazole treatment was applied 16 h before EP, supplemented during
cell harvest and counting, and replaced by StemFit AK02N medium supplemented
with ROCK inhibitor after EP.
Cell-cycle analysis. Using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay
Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Cat. No. C10424), cells were ﬁrst incubated for 2 h 15
min with 10 µM 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) in addition to the small molecule
or culture condition being tested. Cells were then harvested, counted, and an equal
number of cells was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube. According to the manufacturer′
s instructions, cells were washed with 1% BSA in 1X DPBS, ﬁxed with Click-iT
ﬁxative (4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS), incubated for 15 min at room temperature
(RT) and protected from light, and washed with 1% BSA in DPBS. Cells were then
permeabilized in 1X Click-iT saponin-based permeabilization and wash reagent. The
Click-iT labelling reaction was performed by adding a mixture of Alexa Fluor 647
azide ﬂuorescent dye, 2 mM CuSO4 and 1X Click-iT EdU buffer additive to the
samples, incubating the reaction mixture for 30 min at RT and protected from light,
and then washing and resuspending the samples in 1X Click-iT saponin-based per-
meabilization and wash reagent. Finally, a propidium iodide (PI) (Wako, Cat. No.
169-26281) staining solution composed of Triton-X 100 (Nacalai Tesque, Cat. No.
282-29) at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.1%, RNase A at 0.2 mg/mL (Invitrogen, Cat. No.
12091-021) and PI at 20 µg/mL in DPBS was mixed to the samples and incubated for
30 min at RT, protected from light.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting. Measurement of ﬂuorescence intensities was
performed using 5 × 105 cells resuspended in FACS buffer (2% FBS in DPBS) on a
BD LSRFortessa Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDiva software (BD
Bioscience), and raw data were analyzed with FlowJo (FlowJo LLC). For editing
experiments in GFP iPS cells, cells were acquired using the Paciﬁc Blue (450/50
nm) and FITC (530/30 nm) ﬁlters. Cells stained with EdU and PI were acquired
using Alexa Fluor 647 (660/20 nm) and PE-Tx-Red-GR ﬁlters. For characterization
of DNA repair outcomes, BFP+, BFP−/GFP−, and GFP+ populations were sorted
from edited heterozygous GFP iPS cells, and for the clonal isolation of compound
heterozygous cells, the BFP+/GFP+ population was sorted from edited homo-
zygous GFP iPS cells targeted with mixed ssODN repair templa/cates. Cells were
harvested in FACS buffer at a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL and ﬁltered through a
cell-strainer for dissociation. Sorting gates were set for singlets, and the desired
populations were collected on a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience) into
StemFit AK02N medium containing 10-20 µM ROCK inhibitor.
HDR quantiﬁcation assay. Ouabain octahydrate (Sigma–Aldrich, Cat. No.
O3125-250MG) was dissolved in water. Cells targeted at the ATP1A1 locus and
being tested for small molecule or culture conditions were treated 48 h after EP
with 1 mM Ouabain in StemFit AK02N medium supplemented with ROCK
inhibitor until day 6, in order to selectively obtain HDR-edited colonies. Cells were
then maintained normally with StemFit AK02N medium until day 13, and forming
colonies were stained with crystal violet. Tissue culture plates were placed on ice,
washed twice with ice-cold 1X DPBS, ﬁxed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, then
cells were removed from the ice and incubated with 0.05-0.1% Crystal Violet
(Nacalai, Cat. No. 09804-52) in 25–100% methanol for 10 min at RT. Excess
Crystal Viotel was removed by washing with water, and the plates photographed
for manual colony counting.
Clonal analysis. For characterization of DNA repair outcomes of single clones,
cells were harvested on day 7 after EP and 5 × 105 cells were used for genomic DNA
extraction (described below), two cryogenic tubes with 5 × 105 cells each resus-
pended in STEM-CELLBANKER GMP grade (TAKARA BIO, Cat. No. CB047)
were frozen down for total population stocks, and 300–600 cells were plated in
iMatrix511-coated 6 cm dishes. Ten days after plating, colonies ~1 mm in diameter
were picked in 5 µl of media under the microscope and transferred to a 96-well
PCR plate. Afterwards, 10 µl of QuickExtract DNA Extraction Solution (Epicenter,
Cat. No. QE09050) was added, and plates were incubated for 6 min at 65 °C then 2
min at 98 °C before being stored at −30 °C.
Genotyping. For genomic DNA extraction, 0.5–1 × 106 cells were washed with 1X
DPBS, DNA was puriﬁed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Cat. No.
69506) as recommended by manufacturer′s instructions, and puriﬁed DNA was
resuspended in 100 µl of water. Target sequences were ampliﬁed using KAPA HiFi
HS ReadyMix (Kapa Biosystems, Cat. No. KK2602) polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), enzymatic PCR product cleanup was performed with ExoSAP-IT Express
reagent (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Cat. No. 75001), and Sanger sequencing was
performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 CS Kit (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc,
Cat. No. 4337456) according to the manufacturer′s instructions. Genotyping pri-
mers are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Reactions were then puriﬁed by ethanol
precipitation and acquired on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence alignments were analyzed with Snapgene (GSL Biotech LLC), and
sequence trace ﬁles with low base calling conﬁdence were excluded from analyses.
RFLP analyses. ssODN-mediated modiﬁcation of the GFP target sequence was
veriﬁed by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) of a newly created
silent restriction site. The target sequences were PCR ampliﬁed from puriﬁed
gDNA using KAPA HiFi HS ReadyMix, then amplicons were cleaved with Fas-
tDigest NcoI (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Cat. No. FD0573) restriction enzyme in
FastDigest Buffer (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, Cat. No. B64) and incubation for 30
min at 37 °C. Cleaved amplicons were then resolved by gel electrophoresis,
acquired on an AE-9000N E-Graph (Atto) gel documentation system and quan-
tiﬁed with the ImageJ software.
TIDE analysis. TIDE analysis was performed on mixed sequences using the online
tool at https://tide.nki.nl/71. Sequence data from 409B2-derived heterozygous GFP
iPS cells were used as a reference. The deletion size window was extended to 50 bp
to visualize larger deletions, while other parameters were kept as default.
Fluorescent microscopy. Cells plated on iMatrix511-coated 6-well plates with
StemFit AK02N medium were directly imaged using an LSM 710 (ZEISS) confocal
microscope and LSM Software ZEN 2009 (ZEISS). Images were obtained with a
×10 objective, and GFP and DAPI ﬁlters with appropriate gain and exposure times.
