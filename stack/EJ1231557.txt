ABSTRACT
Today, more and more working adults are opting for the Open Distance Learning (ODL) mode to pursue 
their tertiary studies as it offers them the flexibility to study anywhere, any time and at one’s own pace. But 
studying at a distance can be problematic for many learners, with the absence of regular traditional face-to-
face sessions. Some find it difficult to adapt to this new learning environment and become easily isolated. 
Collaborative Learning (CL) can help overcome this isolation and boost learning performance. To investigate 
the implications of CL in the ODL environment, a study was conducted with 155 learners at the Open 
University of Mauritius. The study revealed that at least one third of the respondents were not participating 
in CL and were thus missing on the benefits of “learning together”. The others had adopted CL to understand 
the course content, discuss assignments and get better marks. This study also showed that tutors’ role was 
vital in encouraging learners delve in CL. Respondents deplored the lack of appropriate infrastructure and 
meeting places to hold CL meetings. They also reported lack of awareness of the benefits of CL and difficulty 
in finding time due to family and professional commitment as some of the obstacles to CL.

INTRODUCTION
The concept of Collaborative Learning (CL) has much been privileged in the distance mode of learning 
and thus elicits interest for research. According to Colbeck, Campbell and Bjorklund (2000), Jacobs, Power 
and Loh (2002), Yazici (2005), Laal & Laal (2012), CL is an activity in which two or several learners learn, 
share ideas or attempt to learn collectively to better understand a subject. Sprouting number of research 
concentrates on learning in group settings and in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) 
settings in conventional universities, but few empirical studies have examined Open Distance learners’ 
satisfaction and performance in Collaborating Learning in a blended learning environment. Many scholarly 
works such as those of Johnston, James, Lye and McDonald (2000), Ellis (2003), Maesin, Mansor, Shafie 
and Nayan (2009); Jiang (2009), Laal and Ghodsi (2012), and Sansivero (2016) highlight the benefits of 
collaborative learning, which amongst others include learner motivation, better marks, promotion of social 
interaction, critical thinking, and combatting isolation which is germane to distance education. In Mauritius, 
there is no empirical research which has been conducted to investigate these issues in a collaborative blended 
learning environment. This paper considers a case study of the Open University of Mauritius, a young but 
fast growing University offering thousands of learners, principally working adults, the opportunity to embark 
into tertiary education or pursue further studies for professional advancement. The study should unveil 
salient information about what motivates or hinders learners from engaging in Collaborative Learning. The 
findings of this study will fuel the debate around the concept of Collaborative learning at the University and 
provide the necessary guidelines for a conducive collaborative learning environment. This should help the 
university combat dropout which is common across all universities, but particularly distinctive for learners 
who are enrolled in a blended program. 
LITERATURE REVIEW
Collaborative Learning Theory: ODL Perspective
The term collaborative describes a situation where leaners of more or less the same academic performance 
can do similar activities and work towards a common goal (Muuro, Wagacga, Oboko, & Kihoro, 2014). 
Two theories namely, motivational theory and socio-constructivism, provide a comprehensive theoretical 
framework that might explain why learners adopt the collaborative learning in an ODL environment. 
Collaborative learning is a cordial interaction that involves both learners and teachers in the acquisition 
and sharing of experience and knowledge (Zhu, 2012). Learners show greater interest and participate 
more actively in a constructivist learning context which promotes critical reasoning and in-depth inquiry 
(Mayes, 2001). In collaborative written assignments, group discussions and debates, learners can strengthen 
knowledge construction. Social learning theories aid us to learn from each other and also teach us how to 
construct active learning community (Brame, 2016).
In the pedagogy of teaching, learners are given the liberty to learn from one another as pointed out by 
Vygotsky (1978). He explored the causal relationships between social interaction and individual learning 
providing a grounded context of social constructivist theory of learning. He mentioned that learning 
unfailingly happens and cannot be separated from a social context. “From a teaching philosophy perspective, 
CL is compatible with constructivism basically owing to the function of social interaction. Eggen and 
Kauchak (2001) reported that in a CL environment, learners co-construct more powerful understandings 
than if they were to construct alone. In addition, other researchers highlighted how the learning theories of 
connectivism and constructivism might conformingly be used in education technology for the new generation 
(Mattar, 2010). Consequently, pedagogical strategies that nurture the sharing of expert knowledge where 
learners collaboratively conduct research, share their results, and produce a final project, help to create a 
collaborative community of learners. Collaborative learning in fact involves joint construction of meaning 
through interaction with other learners (Law & Wong, 2003). Van Merrienboer and Paas (2003) added 
that accomplishing a task while working together breeds a powerful conducive learning environment to 
facilitate the active construction of knowledge. Because previous studies have mostly examined learner’s 
performance and satisfaction in a conventional set up (Stansfield, McLellan, & Connolly, 2004) there is a 
need to investigate what ODL learners opine of such a learning paradigm.

Tools/Techniques in Collaborative Learning
Emerging technologies are altering the ways learners communicate, collaborate and learn through social 
interaction. According to Laal and Laal (2012), learners form small groups to help each other to complete 
some tasks such as their assignments. Learners conduct the face to face meetings either before or after 
the sessions. In some cases, learners conduct the meetings during the sessions with the approval of their 
respective tutors. In collaborative learning, learners are able to acquire knowledge through discussions and 
exchange of opinions among themselves (Brindley, Walti, & Blaschke, 2009).
Common tools which are currently used during collaborative learning are WhatsApp, Skype and Moodle. 
The latter is commonly used in most universities and Cole (2005) observed that Moodle can be defined as a 
facilitator in collaborative learning, whereby tutors can create several activities for learners to discuss or even 
share their ideas. Tutors act as moderators while learners discuss among themselves. Learners can use the 
chat function to create a group and discuss their assignments. Rabbany, Elatia, Takafolli and Zaiane (2013) 
confirmed that Moodle indeed enables learners to participate in collaborative learning. 
Another very popular tool used by learners is Skype which according to Zygouris-Coe (2012) is used to 
conduct group discussion. The author found that learners create their own group on Skype and set up their 
own ways of conducting collaborative learning. Some learners form a learning group on Skype to complete a 
task which was allocated to them (Lan, Sung, & Chang, 2007). Authors like Hrastinski and Aghaee (2012) 
explained the advantage of using Skype in collaborative learning, like getting instant feedback from other 
learners on a subject of discussion or still catching up with another learner for a missed tutorial or discussion 
session. 
Because of its popularity learners have found WhatsApp convenient to be integrated in collaborative learning. 
Amry (2014) identified several ways in which learners use WhatsApp allowing them to create specific groups 
in which they exchange messages, pictures, documents and videos. Chan (2005) added that WhatsApp 
provides opportunities for learners to cooperate and collaborate together to share ideas and knowledge. 
Preston, Phillips, Gosper, McNeill, Woo and Green (2010) also found out that more than 50% of learners 
prefer to learn on groups such as WhatsApp group where they are able to discuss freely their academic 
problems.
A famous technique of collaborative learning is the use of group work to learn a task. Learning is more 
effective when peers come together to share ideas about a problem (Johnson & Johnson, 1989). Lin (2015) 
posits that group work is a precondition for effective CL. Learners develop effective cognitive learning 
strategies through group discussion and social interactions. Group discussion is one of the key activities of 
collaborative learning (Zhu, 2012). Garrison and Cleveland-Innes (2005) confirmed that the activity of 
group discussion is indeed effective in helping learners perform better. CL can thus help learners to gain 
more knowledge while working on their assignments if they work together rather than working alone. 
But group work has its own challenges. One group member may not master learning as quickly as the others 
and can be left behind and ultimately not be able to learn anything from the group work. Consequently, the 
whole group might end up falling apart. Svolik (2009) also drew attention to the balance of power as one of 
the biggest problems of a group situation, where dictatorship is recurrent. Moreover conflicting personalities 
might interpose with each member’s chance to fully participate in collaborative group learning. 
Perceived Satisfaction from ODL Learners on CL Practices
Dewiyanti, Brand-Gruwel, Jochems and Broers (2007) describe learners’ satisfaction with collaborative 
learning “as the degree to which a learner feels a positive association with his/her own collaborative learning 
experiences.” Nurmela, Palpen, Lehtinen and Hakkarainen (2003) said that effective learning occurs if 
learners are actively involved, rather than being passive listeners. Previous studies highlighted that learners 
who delved in online collaborative tasks were more satisfied with their learning compared to those who 
abstained from CL (Jung, Choi, Lim, & Leem, 2002). Learners in CL conditions demonstrate more 
constructive learning processes (Eichler, 2003). 

14
Role of Tutors in Collaborative Learning (CL)
Although the concept of collaborative learning is about learners learning by themselves, tutors do have 
several roles to play in these situations. Laal and Laal (2012) stated that a tutor can facilitate the learning 
process of learners and help them to tackle their issues by frequently asking them questions. While some 
learners can work independently on their CL sessions, others depend on a facilitator to conduct their group 
sessions for such tasks as planning and preparing the group sessions, listening to the discussions being 
held and providing feedback and encouragement. Additionally, the tutor is also present to deal with any 
divergence taking place and to monitor the discussion. 
This is in no way contradictory to the idea of learner autonomy that requires learners to be independent and 
become lifelong learners. Lin (2015) views CL as a means of moving learners “away from their dependence 
on their teachers and learn on their own”. But, as pointed out by Katz and O’Donnell (1999), the role of the 
tutor in CL is to intervene during negative situations and to correct the problems which arise. Lentell (2003) 
explained that a tutor should facilitate and guide learners so that they can understand the subject they are 
studying and also gain more knowledge through collaborative learning. 
Benefits and challenges of Collaborative Learning
Research has shown that there is a lot of benefits related to collaborative learning. The potential level of 
progress is increased when a learner works collaboratively with more capable peers. Lin (2015) stated that 
a learner’s cognition is increased by actively communicating with more efficient peers and thus expanding 
conceptual potential. During the CL process, learners have the chance to both receive input and as well as 
produce output. 
Learning does not only necessitate cognitive skills but also involves aspects of how learners feel about learning 
(Jiang, 2009). Motivation is considered as an important factor that determines learner’s achievement and 
attainment through collective aims (Dornyei, 2001; Schreiber & Valle, 2013). Brindley et al. (2009) proposed 
different methods to inspire learners to confront the value of CL by creating study group experiences that are 
motivating and fruitful. The rationale of the CL structure implies that if learners understand group success, 
they will be motivated to help one another to achieve a better result (Zhang, 2010).
CL also breeds a positive learning climate environment where learners feel much closer and more at ease 
without being watched by the whole class or the teacher. Delucchi (2006) highlighted that they have the 
possibility to express their own opinions, the environment being more conducive, thus enabling effective 
learning. There is firm empirical ground that learners who are more satisfied with the online learning 
experience are less likely to drop out and derive higher motivation to continue, but, it is harder if the 
educational technology is not exploited by learner in a fully online environment (Joo, Lim, & Kim, 2011; 
Lee & Choi, 2013).
CL participation boosts learners in critical thinking through problem-solving process, enhancing them more 
in drill-practice skills (Maesin et al., 2009). CL contributes to learners’ performance and improves their 
learning process as well (Rovio-Johansson and Lumsden, 2012). In addition, CL can also help learners to 
prepare for their exams with more confidence as stated by Picou (2011). CL is proved to be more effective 
for problem-solving experiments or worked examples than individual learning. Retnowati, Ayres and Sweller 
(2017) further supported that collaboration is more beneficial and effective when learners learn under 
problem solving conditions. 
Web-based technology no longer posits a challenge in an online learning environment as long as the 
accessibility, usability and support of the course technology platform are available to facilitate learners (Sun, 
2016). In the context of ODL, a technology tool is considered as effective for learning if a learner is using 
and associating a positive attitude in a way that is helpful in reaching his/her learning goal. Therefore, 
a tool allowing collaborative learning, may achieve the learning goal as highlighted by Weidlich and 
Bastiaens (2018). There is further support from De Jong, Krumeich and Verstegen (2016) that the blended 
model-based CL in a Small Private Online Course (SPOC) environment with proper design, facilitation 
and face-to-face interaction groups provided opportunities to learners to engage in learning in order to 
improve their achievements. On the other hand, researchers (Curtis & Lawson, 2001; Brindley et al., 2009; 
Weidlich & Bastiaens, 2018) have also highlighted several hindrances to CL and which include time and 

15
work constraints, family and personal commitments, lack of learners’ readiness to work in groups and time 
differences for members of the group from different regions. Many issues emerged from ODL learner’s point 
of view: finding it difficult to communicate with people whom they do not know well, difficulty of time 
delays in the communication process (asynchronous rather than real-time), members in the collaborative 
group do not maintain an agreed or expected work schedule, need to rely on others to complete the entire 
tasks and finally collaboration as a learning activity itself is time consuming. Learners do not always find 
it easy to take part actively in CL sessions; shy learners can feel overwhelmed when the focus is totally put 
on them and it takes time, patience and skills to hold them as confident contributors especially in group 
activities (Pearson, 2010).
Moreover there is also the issue of the interface design to ease collaboration in an online environment. 
Additional instructional material on the effective use of the software dedicated for collaborative learning is 
at times costly for most institutions in higher education. Another important factor propounded by Sanders 
(2008) and Brindley et al. (2009) is that learners are at times “ill-equipped through their previous learning 
experiences to collaborate or peer-review and often see friends as rivals.” 
Research Questions
To meet the objectives of this study the following research questions will be addressed:
• What are the current Collaborative Learning practices of learners at the Open University of Mauritius?
• What are the factors promoting or hindering CL practices?
• Which measures can be implemented to enhance CL practices?
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
A mixed-method approach was adopted whereby both quantitative and qualitative data were collected to 
provide a holistic understanding of the research problem. An online questionnaire was designed to collect data 
from learners who were either still pursuing or who had just completed their studies at the Open University 
of Mauritius. The questionnaire comprised 84 items divided into 6 sections. The set of items present in the 
questionnaire was guided and developed based on the conceptual elements in the literature review. Before 
finalizing the questionnaire, a pilot testing was undertaken during one week among 10 randomly identified 
learners of the institution and changes were brought based on their feedback. The survey was administered 
over a period of 3 weeks and responses were analysed using SPSS.
DATA ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS
Descriptive Analysis
One hundred and fifty-eight ODL learners responded positively to the call to fill out the online questionnaires. 
After data screening, 155 questionnaires were retained. There was a higher percentage of female respondents 
(66.9%). The respondents’ age varied mostly between 18 to 50. Half of them were married. Most of them 
rated their IT skills as good or very good, using tools like laptops, mobile phones, PCs and tablets on a 
regular basis. The first item of the questionnaire filtered out 37% of the respondents who did not participate 
in collaborative learning (CL). This implies that slightly more than one third of the respondents were not 
availing themselves of an important tool, that of collaborative learning, which as per numerous authors 
(Ellis, 2003; Jung et al., 2002; Laal and Laal, 2012) a vital component of online and, open and distance 
learning. Further data analysis was thus based on the 97 respondents who participated in CL during their 
studies.

16
Preferred Tools for CL Activities
Most of the collaborative groups consisted of 3-7 people, hence showing that they preferred small-size 
groups, probably to be more organized and effective. Two thirds of them were having meetings at least once a 
week and the most common tools utilized during CL sessions were face to face meetings, emails, WhatsApp, 
mobile phones and the Moodle platform. Figure 1 shows on a scale of 1-4 (never use- most preferred), the 
responses for use of such tools.

Figure 1. Preferred tools during CL.
Moodle is the primary online learning platform at the Open University of Mauritius. This study revealed 
that nearly half of the learners were not making regular use of this platform in their studies. This calls 
for urgent attention as learners were missing the benefits of this tool, where learning materials, videos of 
tutorial sessions and lectures, assignments and submission deadlines are posted and important information 
communicated. The platform Moodle in the ODL environment has been widely appraised for its benefits 
(Cole, 2005) and not availing themselves of such benefits therefore deprived learners of the University of a 
prime avenue to enhance their learning.
Regarding the timing, most of those who opted for CL chose to do so right after tutorial sessions normally 
held on Saturdays as this proved to be more convenient and practical, helping to save on travelling time.

Figure 2. Preferred place for CL meetings.
Figure 2 depicts the most preferred place for collaborative learning. The University campus at Curepipe, where 
most of the tutorial sessions are held, was the most favorite place of learners to hold the CL sessions. This is in 
line with the data obtained from learners where they affirm that they schedule their CL sessions mainly after 
tutorial sessions on Saturdays. The second preferred mode for facilitating collaboration was the virtual/online 
platforms such as emails, WhatsApp and Moodle as outlined in figure 2. This preference for online meeting 
platforms reflects today’s trend towards e-learning, where both synchronous and asynchronous interaction 
makes learning a more dynamic, interactive and engaging process (Amry, 2014; Kuo, Belland, & Kuo, 2017).
One item of the questionnaire collected tutors’ role in encouraging learners to delve in CL. While data 
revealed that most tutors did encourage learners to get involved in CL, less than half of them did that on a 
regular basis.

Figure 4. Tutor encouragement.
Tutors can play a vital role in the adoption of collaborative learning. They do not only act as mediators 
who support learners maximize their ability to assimilate difficult concepts, but they are also responsible 
for structuring group interaction and assigning cognitive roles to them (Lin, 2015). Sixty-two percent of 
learners stated that their tutors did not get involve at all in collaborative learning, while 26.8% admitted that 
they sometimes participated. Learners reported that the tasks of those tutors who were involved in CL were 
principally to encourage learners to interact with each other (62.3%) and guide the discussions (60.7%). 
This shows the need for tutors to be empowered to communicate the benefits of CL to learners, motivate 
them to get involved in such activities and be involved in the process.

Various factors contributed to learners’ involvement in CL. The main ones were to understand the learning 
materials and obtain better marks. From a social point of view, learners also got involved in CL to avoid 
loneliness and interact with peers. They also confirmed that the availability of technological tools was an 
important factor contributing to their participation in CL as revealed in studies by Zhu (2012) and Amry 
(2014). Moreover, only 40% of respondents felt that tutors contributed to their CL, hence confirming the 
previous findings.

Figure 6. Benefits of CL.
Most of the respondents gave high ratings to the different benefits they derived from collaborative learning. 
CL encouraged learning through group discussions, making the whole process more interesting. Learners 
were of the opinion that CL enabled them to share course materials and improve exam scores. Because 
the ODL mode is a relatively new concept, learners valued CL as an enabler in the adaptation process, 
promoting at the same time socialization and peer tutoring. Quite a number of respondents (62%) believed 
that involvement in CL can help avoid drop out. Research shows that in the ODL environment, dropout 
rates are higher than those for on-campus courses and range from 20 to 50 % for distance learners (Frankola, 
2001). So, the promotion of CL can help ODL institutions curb down their drop rates (Pedro & Scott, 
2004).

Figure 7. Description of learning style.
One item of the questionnaire investigated the respondents’ learning style and helped to triangulate data about 
those participating in CL or not. Figure 7 shows that around 60% of respondents were involved in working 
groups and this indicates good triangulation and confirmed responses to a previous item which revealed that 
slightly less than two thirds of respondents were involved in CL. Thirty-six percent did not attend any tutorials 
which offer learners the opportunities to meet each other, and hence plan and organize CL activities. Data 
show that those who attended the tutorials were more likely to participate in CL. Universities might suggest 
compulsory attendance of a certain percentage of tutorials to foster learners’ involvement in CL. 
Planning of CL Activities
For CL to be fruitful, it must be properly organized and planned so that meeting time is maximized. 
Three sections of the questionnaire investigated issues dealing with the planning of CL and the activities 
taking place during and after (De Jong et al., 2016). Figure 8 shows that more than half of the respondents 
considered the planning stage of CL as inadequate. Meeting place was not always convenient. The duration 
of the meeting and the contribution of each participant were not defined. Pre-planning tasks were not set 
before the meetings were held. In most cases (72%) there was no group leader to coordinate the activities. 
This lack of planning can be a deterrent to the conduct of CL and even jeopardize its outcomes.

Respondents reported that during the meetings, a number of fruitful activities like sharing of notes and 
discussion of assignments took place. CL was also a popular learning platform for more than half of them 
to study the learning materials together and conduct revision before exams. But figure 9 also shows that a 
significant percent of learners was either not convinced of the worth of the CL meetings (neutral or disagree) 
or did not see much happening in these meetings. This speaks of the efficiency of CL which though attended 
by a number of learners did not seem to bring the expected outcomes. Learners should probably be provided 
with more guidelines as to how to organize and plan their CL sessions.

Figure 9. During CL.
One section of the questionnaire collected information about what happened after the CL sessions, to assess 
if the purpose of these sessions has been met and if future sessions were anticipated. While data revealed 
overall positive responses (figure 10), attention is drawn to the significant percentages of disagreement for all 
the items of this section. For example, some 30% were not willing to meet again were not sure if objectives 
were met or still if they had understood the materials better. Data therefore showed that the proper planning 
of CL is an important factor contributing to effective interaction and learning.

This study showed that opinions about the outcomes of these sessions were mitigated. While the majority 
found them quite useful to boost their understanding of the learning content and obtain better exam results, 
there was still a minority who found the sessions unproductive and some even mentioned their unwillingness 
to attend future sessions.
Challenges to Participating in CL
While CL presents numerous benefits, its adoption and implementation can pose a number of challenges 
which have been reported by (Nyerere, Gravenir, & Mse, 2012; Curtis & Lawson, 2001). One section of 
the questionnaire captured learners’ responses in that regard. Around 40% of the respondents reported work 
and family commitments and the logistics around the conduct of CL, like, transport problem and lack of 
appropriate meeting places as the most common challenges to participating in CL. Such issues were also 
reported by researchers like Pedro & Scott (2004) and Lin (2015).
Respondents considered that off-topic discussions could also jeopardize the success of CL, especially when 
there is restricted involvement of the tutor and other peer learners. While educational institutions have no 
control over the external factors like family and professional commitments, they can review policies and 
put in place such facilities that can address a number of the challenges mentioned in this study and which 
corroborate with the findings of Dirkx and Smith (2008).

Differentiation by Gender, Age and Marital Status
When further analysis was carried out to investigate any bias in terms of gender, age group and marital 
status, no significant differences were observed for most of the cases under consideration. For example, there 
was no gender bias with regard to responses about obstacles to participation in CL and to styles of leaning. 
The only significant difference worth reporting (U= 740, p= 0.031) is that more matured learners, that is 
those in the age group 31-50 mentioned they enjoyed group work more than the younger ones and that was 
probably a motivating factor for them to take part in CL.

Qualitative Analysis
Three open-ended questions allowed the collection of qualitative data from the respondents. Despite the 
numerous benefits that CL adds to the learning process, especially in the ODL setup, 37% of learners at 
OU indicated that they did not participate in CL. One open-ended question was used to capture the several 
reasons behind this reluctance. Learners mentioned that time was a crucial factor for not participating in CL 
(Dirkx & Smith, 2008) (figure 12).
Most importantly, course design in the ODL context should enable enough time for more collaborative 
learning activities in terms of scheduling, planning and organizing and subsequently more time is needed for 
discussion and changing ideas which are crucial to deeper learning (Brindley et al., 2009). 
Figure 12. Factors affecting participation in CL
The following comments testify of the views of learners on that issue:
“Working and learning make it difficult to find time for collaborative learning”
“I don’t have much time to interact with others”
“I would like to participate in CL, but the majority are working people and barely have time for this”
This trend probably results from the profile of the learners who were mostly working adults with tight 
personal and professional commitment. What emerged as another major factor from the responses is the 
tendency to favour individual work, and the difficulty in finding or joining an appropriate working group. 
“PhD is more of a personal journey” 
“Learners still believe that if they study alone, they will get more marks. They are not willing to collaborate 
and work together. They keep their knowledge and notes for themselves, even if someone asks for a help.”
Moreover, meeting opportunities were also scarce. Lack of awareness of the benefits of CL was also pointed 
out as an obstacle to participation in CL. Learners remarked that tutors were not motivating them enough 
to delve in CL activities.
“I was never aware of it”
“Some tutors do not involve learners in group work”
The emerging themes from the commentaries confirmed the findings revealed from analysis of items from 
previous sections of the questionnaire: What needs to be retained is that some ODL learners found it 
difficult to integrate CL in their learning and lack of time and involvement of tutors and other peers were 
the major obstacles identified.

To boost up enthusiasm and motivation to participate in CL activities, learners suggested that the institution 
provides appropriate meeting places to hold group meetings (figure 13). As already suggested by Nyerere et 
al. (2012), convenient meeting locations are an important factor to organize CL activities. Other suggestions 
include access to an enhanced interactive online platform, improved Wi-Fi facilities and access to the library 
premises. In relation to the previous open-ended question, learners suggested that tutors should not only 
encourage them to get involved in CL but should also act as facilitators in the process. Some of them also 
raised the importance of being informed right at the beginning of the semester about such activities and their 
benefits. The responses below testify of some of these suggestions.
“Provide a special corner for learners willing to participate in collaborative learning”
“Tutors should discuss about collaborative learning and encourage learners to participate”
“Conduct an awareness campaign based on facts (coming from studies/research) whereby the benefits of 
collaborative learning are passed on to learners and tutors”
Figure 13. Word cloud describing measures to facilitate CL.
Responses to a third open-ended question lead to some valuable reasons that can encourage ODL learners 
get involved in CL. These include the benefits of knowledge sharing and helping each other in understanding 
and assimilating course content (figure 14). The other benefits mentioned by respondents are socialization, 
group discussions and obtaining better results in both assignments and exams. Respondents also indicated 
that successful collaborative learning can be facilitated by the presence of tutors who can guide the discussions 
and help address emerging issues. 
“Sharing is caring. By sharing you gain more”
“It encourages learners to get fully involved in the content of the particular module and prepare them to 
answer exam questions more easily”

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The take-away lessons from this study are numerous. Not all ODL learners participate in CL. In this study 
one third of the respondents were not availing themselves of the benefits of CL and were thus depriving 
themselves of an important tool that could have helped them boost their learning performance. Half of 
them made scarce use of Moodle, hence did not have regular access to online course content, assignments 
submission instructions and the posted class videos. However, those who participated in CL mentioned a 
number of learning benefits, thus confirming findings from previous studies (Cole, 2005; Rabbany et al., 
2013; Dornyei, 2001; Lentell, 2003; Pedro & Scott, 2004; Zhang, 2010). The three main ones highlighted 
in this study include understanding the learning content, discussing the assignments and obtaining better 
marks (Delucchi, 2006; Muuro et al., 2014). Three quarters of the respondents also mentioned that 
CL helped them to adapt to the ODL mode. However, they also highlighted a number of obstacles to 
participating in CL and the major ones include lack of (i) time due to family and professional commitments, 
(ii) encouragement from tutors and peers and (iii) facilities and logistics to conduct CL meetings. As many 
learners were not taking advantage of the functionalities of the Moodle platform, they should constantly 
be reminded, during induction sessions and tutorials of the importance and benefits of mastering this tool 
for enhancing learning. Tutors too should be sensitized about the benefits of CL and must be trained to 
impart appropriate skills to learners so that they can participate in CL activities. Their personal involvement 
in the CL sessions proved to be vital. Tutors’ personal involvement in the CL sessions proved to be vital. 
ODL institutions should allocate adequate meeting places for learners to conduct their CL meetings. They 
should also provide online platforms as this study confirmed that respondents resorted to this mode for 
collaborating and exchanging information. This helped them to address the difficulties of finding meeting 
places and travelling. 
Those embarking on the ODL or online learning mode can easily become isolated and miss the benefits of 
“learning together”. CL can be a great contributor to help such learners overcome this isolation and boost 
their learning experience. However, this study shows that the conduct of CL lacks a structural framework 
and learners rely on their own initiatives. It is imperative therefore for open and learning institutions to 
provide learners with an efficient learning framework that enhances learning performance and promotes 
critical thinking through structured socialization.
